        "text": "Philadelphia 76ers general manager Elton Brand answers a press conference question. (AP/Matt Rourke)\n\nElton Brand\n\nYes, I watched the 76ers blow away the Lakers on Sunday and score 143 points in the process. (Not that Process.) And yes, Tobias Harris has fit in seamlessly in his first two appearances for the Sixers since Elton Brand pushed all-in and acquired the rising star from the Clippers.\n\nAnd yes, I certainly noticed when he somehow hoodwinked Orlando into handing over a couple of draft picks, one a first-rounder (via Oklahoma City) for the walking clinical psychiatry study that is Markelle Fultz. How did he pull that off? Magic.\n\nThe applause for new Philadelphia general manager Brand has been standing and extended. Everyone seems to agree that what he’s done before the NBA trade deadline was proactive, even courageous, and certainly dynamic. It’s always a crowd-pleaser when a GM does a cannonball off the high dive.\n\nWell, I wanna go on-record here with the risk of wiping egg off my face in June: I'm not all-in on the Harris deal.\n\nI think it cost too much and was executed too soon. The Sixers gave away too many assets for a reward that I don’t believe can be seized this year. I don’t think the Warriors are vulnerable enough to be beaten yet. And I think retaining Harris in the summer will be tough and expensive.\n\nThis is basically a big risk to win now and I think it’s foolhardy. Unless, that is, you’re the type to get excited about the Eastern Conference trophy.\n\nHere are five reasons Sixers fans should not get their hopes up for an NBA title:\n\nHighlights of the Sixers' 117-110 win over the Denver Nuggets on Saturday.\n\n1. This is now a really exciting offensive team. That doesn’t make it a champion.\n\nBoy, that 143 against Los Angeles was some juice, right? The preceding 117-110 win over the Nuggets might’ve been more impressive. It’s gotten everyone dreaming. The Sixers zipped the ball around and found each other. Joel Embiid was unstoppable on the blocks. And now J.J. Redick has somebody on the opposite wing to pull bodies away from him on the arc. It seemed like every time Harris got the ball with a good look, he knocked it down. Ben Simmons noticed and got him the ball.\n\nEmbiid has matured into one of the 8 or 10 best players in the league and he’s still a kid. He might be as good a modern pop-center as there is in the game by the time he’s done.\n\nBut he got pushed around a little last year in the Celtics series. So did all the 76ers. It was their first taste of playoff basketball. Which brings us to the crux of whether all of Brand’s transactions are worth it to take one big postseason roll right now.\n\nHighlights of the Sixers' 143-120 win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday.\n\n2. The Sixers are going to be a lot of fun to watch. But are they any playoff-tougher?\n\nIn case you haven’t checked the calendar, it’s February. The brand of basketball being played currently is parallel to February hockey. The good teams are conserving energy to an extent and simply expending enough to consolidate their playoff positions. A lot of games simply don’t hold urgency. The Nuggets, current 2-seed in the West, are a perfect example.\n\nWhile it’s true that multiple offensive options often win close games, especially playoff games, what concerns me a little about the Sixers is, we still won’t know what they really have until May. I honestly don’t see the tough-minded role players on this roster that you have on the Celtics (Al Horford, Marcus Smart) and I think you do this year on the Raptors (Serge Ibaka, Fred VanVleet and now aging but resolute and versatile Marc Gasol). We will see, but nobody jumps out at you on the Sixers as the kind of guy who’ll outfight an equal playoff opponent.\n\nHighlights of Tobias Harris with the Clippers earlier this season.\n\n3. Harris is not a defensive answer. That’s what the Sixers lacked last May.\n\nTobias Harris is a really good-looking offensive player. At a solid 6-8, he has a strong, ripped-up body and his base looks so sturdy as he rises for shots. That matters. I never remembered him looking this good when he played for Bruce Pearl at Tennessee. It’s like the difference between Kawhi Leonard at San Diego State and after a few years in San Antonio.\n\nI do remember Harris tearing up Michigan for 19 points in the first half of a 2011 NCAA tournament game, then disappearing completely and going scoreless in a 75-45 loss. He was a freshman trying to lead a team that didn’t look very interested in playing defense that day. And Pearl was about to get fired for recruiting violations.\n\nThing is, Harris still doesn’t exactly play D with his hair on fire. He’s one of those guys who might get over a screen and might not. And if he goes underneath, he might fight through and he might not. That’s a little bit why the Lakers’ kid winger Kyle Kuzma went off for 23 points in the first quarter on Sunday. Harris was guarding him a lot of the time.\n\nI’ll just throw a couple facts out here:\n\n1. The Sixers are Harris’ 5th team in 7 ½ NBA seasons. Why is that? Why are clubs not only willing but apparently eager to part with him?\n\n2. The Long Islander has played 8 complete seasons of college and pro ball and has yet to be a part of a single postseason win. Not a series. A game. Some of that has been beyond his control. But after 8 years on 6 teams, you have to wonder how much?\n\nHighlights of the Warriors' 141-102 win over the Spurs on Feb. 6.\n\n4. The Warriors will eventually become vulnerable. But they aren’t yet.\n\nIf you think you’ve located cracks in Golden State’s façade, lemme know. It’ll happen eventually. Maybe if the Warriors try to short their best 2-way player Klay Thompson and, against all odds, he takes off in free agency this summer. Maybe if, much more likely, Draymond Green decides in 2020 he’s had enough of accepting discounted contracts.\n\nBut it ain’t happening this spring. Barring key injuries, this is the best basketball team ever constructed, playing at an optimum level. You can never say never. But it’s hard to imagine anyone beating them in the 2019 playoffs.\n\nSo, why is Brand making all these moves to apparently attempt to win now? His star players are quite young. He has time. Why not aim the big swing for 2020?\n\nIt’s going to be awfully tough and prohibitively expensive to keep the core four together. Jimmy Butler is likely to walk, which is not a disaster. But Harris’ will demand a max contract in the off-season. Why not shop for the big fish next year when the Warriors could start to quake a bit and the Sixers are another year more mature?\n\nA compilation of Ben Simmons' 3-for-13 day against the Lakers from Heat Check.\n\n5. Ben Simmons still can’t shoot a jumper. That’s going to bite the 76ers again in the playoffs.\n\nPlayoff defense is so much more attentive and intense than what you see in the basic mid-season NBA game that it’s practically a different sport. That’s what the Sixers discovered last year in their first splash in the postseason pool. While their penchant for careless turnovers did not hurt them inordinately, their inability to run set-piece stuff when quarters got tight absolutely did.\n\nPart of what every team needs in its arsenal during the playoffs is an effective pick-n-roll game. But with Simmons running the show, too often defenders simply slough off him and dare him to loft a jumper. LeBron James did it on Sunday. This hurts one of Embiid’s primary weapons. He’s so dangerous at the pick-n-pop that everyone simply shows on him and denies it. They don’t have to worry about Simmons using the screen to shoot the 18-foot jumper, let alone a trey. He can’t.\n\nI think people will increasingly find that Simmons is one player during the regular season and entirely another one during the playoffs. He’s still terrific at seeing teammates and finding them with laser passes. He’s still a handful when he can get southbound to the rim. But those opportunities are harder to come by in the playoffs. I cannot see the Sixers beating anyone really good in the playoffs until Simmons fixes this glaring flaw in his game. That goes for this year and any year."
