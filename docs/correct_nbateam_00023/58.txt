The Philadelphia 76ers have named Elton Brand as their new GM. Brand takes the General Manager position after serving as Philadelphia’s Vice President of Basketball Operations. Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN broke the news.

Wojnarowski is also reporting that Brand’s promotion will occasion a large-scale reshuffling of the Sixers front office.

Brand played in the NBA for 17 seasons, from 1999-2016. He spent four of those years in Philadelphia, plus a final 17 games in 2015-16 before his retirement.
