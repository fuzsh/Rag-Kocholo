        "text": "2. METHODS\n\n2.1. Subject overview\n\nThe CHP curriculum was developed for a 12‐week semester. Each week students were introduced to essential health promotion education topics – health promotion planning frameworks, project management, partnerships and networks, project evaluation, community building and development, social marketing, consumer participation, settings for health promotion and health policy and advocacy. In preparation for weekly workshops, students worked through the curriculum by engaging independently in self‐guided, asynchronous learning activities delivered via the Learning Management System. 12 At the live synchronous skills‐based workshops facilitated by teaching staff students worked in teams on their project implementation tasks. 12 Figure shows an example of curriculum design for 1 week of learning in CHP.\n\nThe subject's intended learning outcomes focused on critical appraisal and application of health promotion frameworks and community development models, for example, the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion, 13 the Victorian Department of Health Integrated Health Promotion (IHP) Resource Kit 14 and the Assets‐Based Community Development model. 15 Students were expected to attend the workshops with lessons designed to examine theories and concepts which were applied during group work as students' progressed in their health promotion projects.\n\nAs this was a project‐based subject, the program planning cycle was introduced to students so they could comprehend the four main stages of the cycle – needs assessment, planning, implementation and evaluation. 16 At the outset, students were allocated to project teams of three‐to‐five people and their first task related to needs assessment was to select a specific group from among tertiary education students (eg, international, Indigenous, disabled, LGBTIQA+), identify the health issues affecting this group and the key factors (social, environmental, economic determinants) contributing to the health issue. Over the course of the planning stage, the teams articulated the project aim, objectives, strategies, timeframe, resources needed, collaboration with sponsors/partners and link the project premise to the Ottawa Charter. The student's projects were implemented at the La Trobe University Bundoora (Melbourne) and Bendigo (regional) campuses.\n\nTo bridge academic content and project practicalities the Victorian government's IHP Resource Kit 14 was used as a foundational teaching resource. Students were provided with a program logic template based on the IHP framework to plan their projects. The project implementation and evaluation stages occurred during Weeks 9 to 11.\n\nKey to the applied component of CHP was providing students with avenues to engage with stakeholders, in this case, prospective supporters (sponsors) located within the University as well as external health‐related organisations. In previous years, various University non‐academic departments such as Student Wellbeing, Sports at La Trobe, Accommodation Services and Environment and Sustainability have been invited by the Subject Coordinators to propose projects and offer mentorship to students. Staff from these departments would “pitch” their project idea at the start of the semester and students could choose to work with the units or develop their projects. Collaborating with a department's staff offered students the opportunities to be mentored, engage with university personnel and understand their roles, experience a workplace setting and learn professional behaviour. Previous projects have included delivering online health education sessions to staff and students, undertaking a waste audit across campus, running a men's health night with male students living on residence and producing low‐cost healthy eating meal plans for students.\n\nOn occasion, these departments have provided resources including funding (up to $1,500), printed health‐related material and venue and equipment for project use. Project teams who conceived their projects were encouraged to approach entities such as not‐for‐profit organisations to seek their assistance as project supporters. As an example, one team that planned a sexually transmitted infections awareness forum on campus contacted a local family planning branch and was invited to present their project plan. Subsequently, the organisation provided in‐kind contributions of print material, prophylaxis and a resource person to deliver a presentation.\n\nIn addition to the assistance offered by the University's units and external agencies, the Public Health Student Association (PHSA) initiated a peer‐to‐peer mentoring arrangement to support CHP students. The PHSA members were third‐year students who had completed CHP the previous year and were willing to share their experiences and offered guidance based on their lessons learned in project implementation.\n\n2.2. Assessments\n\nThe IHP Framework was used as a basis to develop the subject assessments. There were three assessments that students completed individually and as a project team. Table provides an overview of assessments and links assessment to competencies.\n\nTABLE 1\n\nAssessment HP competency domainCompetency statement\n\nAssessment 1 – Health Promotion Intervention Proposal\n\nIndividually and in small‐groups students develop a project proposal.\n\nPart A – Individually. Student focuses on the vision setting, priority setting and problem definition and solution generation aspects of the IHP planning framework. Students are required to:\n\nIdentify a health or social issue (done in consultation with the group)\n\nUndertake a review of the literature to identify who is most affected, the key factors contributing to the issue and a discussion and critique of health promotion approaches that have been used in the past to address this issue.\n\nPart B – In a small group students use Part A to develop a project. As group students are required to articulate the following:\n\nProject goal\n\nProject objectives\n\nProposed strategies\n\nOttawa Charter Action Areas\n\nTimeframes and resources\n\nNetworks and partnerships\n\nKnowledge and skills required to implement project\n\nEnable change\n\n1.2 Use Health Promotion approaches which support empowerment, participation, partnership and equity to create environments and settings which promote health\n\n1.4 Facilitate the development of personal skills that will maintain and improve health\n\nMediate through partnerships\n\n3.1 Engage partners from different sectors to actively contribute to Health Promotion action\n\n3.2 Facilitate effective partnership working which reflects Health Promotion values and principles\n\nCommunication\n\n4.1 Use effective communication skills including written, verbal, non‐verbal, listening skills and information technology\n\n4.2 Use electronic and other media to receive and disseminate Health Promotion information\n\n4.3 Use culturally appropriate communication methods and techniques for specific groups and settings\n\n4.4 Use interpersonal communication and groupwork skills to facilitate individuals, groups, communities and organisations to improve health and reduce health inequities\n\nLeadership\n\n5.1 Work with stakeholders to agree a shared vision and strategic direction for Health Promotion action\n\n5.2 Use leadership skills which facilitate empowerment and participation (including team work, negotiation, motivation, conflict resolution, decision‐making, facilitation and problem‐solving)\n\n5.4 Incorporate new knowledge and ideas to improve practice and respond to emerging challenges in Health Promotion\n\nAssessment\n\n6.3 Collect, review and appraise relevant data, information and literature to inform Health Promotion action\n\n6.4 Identify the determinants of health which impact on Health Promotion action\n\nPlanning\n\n7.1 Mobilise, support and engage the participation of stakeholders in planning Health Promotion action\n\n7.2 Use current models and systematic approaches for planning Health Promotion action\n\n7.3 Develop a feasible action plan within resource constraints and with reference to existing needs and assets\n\n7.4 Develop and communicate appropriate, realistic and measurable goals and objectives for Health Promotion action\n\n7.5 Identify appropriate Health Promotion strategies to achieve agreed goals and objectives\n\nAssessment 2 – Implementation and Evaluation Presentation\n\nBuilding on Assessment Task 1, students work in their group to finalise their project plan, implement and evaluate one or more health promotion strategies proposed in Part B of Assessment 1. Students are required to implement at least one strategy from their project plan and use this experience as the basis for the completion of this Group Presentation.\n\nIn their presentation, students are required to address the following:\n\nRationale for the project\n\nGoal, objectives and strategies\n\nModels and framework used\n\nProject implementation\n\nResources, partnerships and skills\n\nEvaluation and dissemination\n\nStrengths, limitations and recommendations\n\nCommunication\n\n4.1 Use effective communication skills including written, verbal, non‐verbal, listening skills and information technology\n\n4.2 Use electronic and other media to receive and disseminate Health Promotion information\n\n4.3 Use culturally appropriate communication methods and techniques for specific groups and settings\n\n4.4 Use interpersonal communication and groupwork skills to facilitate individuals, groups, communities and organisations to improve health and reduce health inequities\n\nImplementation\n\n8.1 Use ethical, empowering, culturally appropriate and participatory processes to implement Health Promotion action\n\n8.2 Develop, pilot and use appropriate resources and materials\n\n8.3 Manage the resources needed for effective implementation of planned action\n\nEvaluation and research\n\n9.1 Identify and use appropriate Health Promotion evaluation tools and research methods\n\n9.2 Integrate evaluation into the planning and implementation of all Health Promotion action\n\n9.5 Contribute to the development and dissemination of Health Promotion evaluation and research processes\n\nAssessment 3 – Critical Reflection Report\n\nIndividually, students reflect on the subject content covered throughout PHE2CHP and their involvement in the group project. Students respond to two critical reflection prompts using the Gibbs Reflective Practice Model.\n\nCritical reflection 1 – Students select a topic, health issue and vulnerable population group and reflect on how the topic can be applied to health promotion practice in relation to the health issue among the vulnerable group chosen\n\nCritical reflection 2 – Students use Gibbs' model to reflect on what they have learnt from their involvement in planning, implementation and evaluating their group project\n\nCommunication 4.1 Use effective communication skills including written, verbal, non‐verbal, listening skills and information technology Leadership\n\n5.2 Use leadership skills which facilitate empowerment and participation (including team work, negotiation, motivation, conflict resolution, decision‐making, facilitation and problem‐solving)\n\n5.6 Contribute to team and organisational learning to advance Health Promotion action\n\nAssessment 1 was a health promotion intervention proposal. Students were provided with a program logic template based on the IHP framework to plan their group project. 14 This template included vision setting, priority setting and problem definition, solution generation, capacity building and planning for evaluation and dissemination. Individually, students undertook a review of the literature on an agreed priority issue affecting a specific tertiary student group to define the problem and establish a priority area for their group project. Once the group have established the priority, they then collectively developed a project plan.\n\nAssessment 2 required students in their group to present their project. In their presentations, students detailed the rationale for the project, the goal, objectives and strategies, models and frameworks that informed their project. They also detailed how the project strategies were implemented including the resources required, their partnerships and the theory/frameworks/ models which informed implementation. Finally, they presented an evaluation plan which included the purpose of their evaluation, the strategies they evaluated and how they were evaluated and their recommendations for future practice.\n\nAssessment 3 was a critical reflection. In this assessment students used Gibbs' reflective cycle 17 to undertake two reflections, one on a topic covered in this subject and the other on their learning from their involvement in planning, implementing and evaluating their group project (Figure ).\n\n2.3. Subject evaluation\n\nThe CHP student satisfaction data were collected using the centralised and standardised University “Student Feedback on Subjects” (SFS) instrument. This online survey included eight 5‐point strengths of agreement quantitative items (see Table ). The quantitative mean score analysis comprised: 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = undecided, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree, 0 mean score = not applicable or no response. Three qualitative questions were asked: “What were the best aspects of this subject?”, “What aspects of this subject were most in need of improvement?” and “What online experiences have worked well and should be continued?”\n\nTABLE 2\n\n201920202021Students enrolled627038Response rate43.55%27.14%50%Student feedback of subjects question1.

Overall I was satisfied with the quality of this subject4.044.163.89Overall mean score4.064.113.95\n\nStudents were invited by the Surveys, Data and Analytics Team to anonymously complete the SFS using a link provided in an email or via the Learning Management System. After the SFS survey period ended, the Survey, Data and Analytics Team distributed the results of the descriptive statistics for the SFS and raw qualitative responses to subject coordinators. Subject coordinators were provided with trend data against each item to show whether student satisfaction was stable, increasing or decreasing across each item. Qualitative data relevant to experiential learning were extracted and analysed by the subject coordinators.\n\nEthics approval was granted by the La Trobe University Human Ethics Committee (HEC21435) for the use of CHP Student Feedback Survey (2019‐2021) data in publications about this subject.\n\n3. RESULTS\n\nQuantitative data from the SFS survey is presented in Table . The SFS quantitative score for each item was measured on a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 representing the highest possible level of satisfaction (ie, strongly agree). Overall, the quantitative data suggest that the student satisfaction was strong and remained constant over the 3‐year period 2019 to 2021.\n\nDue to the COVID‐19 outbreak in 2020, CHP face‐to‐face classes were replaced with online learning. The change in lesson delivery mode did not appear to adversely impact overall satisfaction with the subject; the overall mean score was 4.06 in 2019 and 4.11 in 2020. By 2021 the second year of the pandemic and lockdowns in Melbourne overall satisfaction for CHP decreased (this cohort of students completed their first year of university studies, in 2020, during lockdown). In 2021, on the SFS indicator, “Overall I was satisfied with the quality of this subject” CHP achieved a score of 3.89 (out of 5). This was a drop in satisfaction from 4.16 in 2020, however, the 2021 Student Feedback Survey obtained a higher response rate (50%) compared with the 2020 Student Feedback Survey (27.14%).\n\nThe qualitative feedback from students indicated they found the applied and hands‐on approach enhanced their learning and skills development. Students reported that curriculum and assignments were closely aligned and enabled them to practically apply their learnings, for example:\n\n“The assignments were applicable with what we will need to do within our discipline. The freedom we had to make our own health promotion projects gave us an understanding on what we needed to consider and how to improve. The was great association between workshop material and assignments.”\n\n“By far the best aspect was the development and implementation of our group projects. It really gave me a chance to take the theory and make it real.”\n\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nFor most students, CHP was the first subject they undertook that focused on the theory and practice of the program cycle and having to complete an original project within the timeframe of a semester. While students were familiar with classroom modalities, they were unaccustomed to their learning being faciliated and enhanced through engagment with stakeholders and sponsors in a small scale, real world project. At the start of the semester, students expressed trepidation about having to develop and implement a health promotion project that entailed engaging with external parties and translating theory to practice; not an uncommon occurrence among students unexposed to practise‐based learning. These concerns eased as students progressed through step‐by‐step activities that prepared them to effectively communicate their intended project to and seek support from prospective project sponsors as well as to apply appropriate theory to specific elements of the program planning cycle, as highlighted through students' feedback in Section 3. The use of experiential learning in combination with assessments was designed to step students through the program planning cycle and to enable them to meet the IUHPE Core Competencies and Professional Standards 6 (see Table ). Furthermore, the IUHPE Core Competencies and Professional Standards were used as a guide for assessing curriculum content and as a quality assurance tool for course reviews and accreditation purposes. 18 , 19 , 20\n\nThe working principles of experiential learning 21 were directly embedded in the development and delivery of CHP. Students were exposed to both academic content and processes for applying new knowledge, engaged in meaningful learning free from excessive judgement, reflected on and developed their values, had opportunities to engage with the more complex systems and broader perspectives and were pushed beyond their comfort zones. The experiential learning component that necessitated interactions and collaboration with agencies, peers and university professional staff allowed students to build workplace attributes, professional behaviour and identity, acquaint themselves with and explore the health promotion sector and strengthen teamwork abilities. This corroborates with evidence that hands‐on learning in real‐world settings benefits students academic development, relationship building with peers, academics and community stakeholders while strengthening problem‐solving and decision‐making skills. 1 , 22 , 23 , 24 The set of knowledge and skills CHP students obtained are further applied when students undertake the third‐year subject “Health Promotion Planning and Evaluation” and field placement in the final semester of their course.\n\nAcademics engaged in developing health promotion curriculum may like to consider integrating experiential learning modalities to expand the student experience and support building their health promotion competencies in preparation for the workplace. For instance, creating opportunities to incorporate learning that reflects practice (eg, project‐based activities) enables students to identify the link between their practical experience to the competency domain of “implementation” and understand the alignment with the subject's intended learning outcomes. The experiential exercise could be initiated through academics leveraging their existing links with community agencies to establish project collaborations such as engagement of students to develop resources to support real‐world projects in partnership with project sponsors and field visits to observe community‐based project implementation. Field practitioners from these community agencies could also be recruited as mentors to guide students as they work through the project cycle.\n\nCHP is the first subject students undertake that is specific to health promotion practice, therefore there is a strong emphasis on building program planning knowledge and skills while instilling health promotion values such as empowerment, equity and community participation. Students develop competence in communication and leadership, project implementation, evaluation and research, all with an emphasis on professional and ethical behaviours 6 in preparation for their final year subjects. Furthermore, embedding the IUHPE Core Competencies into CHP provides students with greater recognition and validation of health promotion as a profession that enables them to articulate the knowledge and skills they have acquired from their hands‐on learning experience when constructing job applications. 25 The practical hands‐on experience in health promotion projects also contributes to students forming a professional identity as future health promotion practitioners. 26 , 27 Students' experiential learning experience could be expanded by facilitating students' participation in professional associations such as the Australian Health Promotion Association and the IUHPE Student and Early Career Network to introduce students to the association's goals, the profession's standards, ethical principles and code of conduct. Practically, these associations are platforms for students to engage in projects, volunteer opportunities and conferences that would contribute to their professional development in this field.\n\nThe outbreak of COVID‐19 in Australia in early 2020 severely impacted the tertiary education sector. Higher education institutions, including La Trobe University, made drastic adjustments to ensure their core business of teaching continued. Almost overnight academics pivoted from face‐to‐face teaching to delivering lessons online, restructuring curriculum and assessments. As CHP was developed as a blended subject much of its content was already available online (eg, pre‐workshop activities on the LMS) and required minimal change. The major disruptions were twofold – (i) change to an online teaching and learning setting and (ii) students projects had to be implemented online.\n\nThe adjustment to virtual learning for CHP students was particularly demanding as the familiar environment of a classroom that facilitated peer‐to‐peer learning and group work was unavailable. In addition, with pandemic lockdown restrictions in place, students were constrained in the type of projects they could implement and there were scarce project sponsors able to offer face‐to‐face project opportunities, thus online projects were the only viable option. This posed challenges for several students. To mitigate the impediments that arose, online technologies such as MS Teams and Zoom, were incorporated to facilitate communication among students and between students and tutors in progressing project planning and implementation, resources sharing, as well consultations with project sponsors and peer mentors. Providing students with the opportunity to build their skills in utilising online technology is an early step in preparing them to achieve competency in delivering digital health promotion as future practitioners. 28 , 29 Despite the disruption, the experiential learning component continued without major change and students had the full benefit of engaging in activities outside the classroom (albeit online), including working with external stakeholders.\n\nA broader benefit to CHP students, through their project efforts, was they could assert their contribution to promoting the health of the campus community. This is in recognition that universities are an ideal setting to promote health and an opportunity for students to link concepts and theories on settings‐based approaches to practice as outlined in the Okanagan Charter 30 ; La Trobe University is a member of the Australian Health Promoting Universities Network. Using the University as a setting for projects provides students with hands‐on experience in a setting that is safe, familiar and where they can be supervised by academic staff."
