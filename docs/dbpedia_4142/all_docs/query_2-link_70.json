        "text": "If we look at the range of practices called experiential learning we see everything from farming to conflict resolution; from assessment to youth development; and from practical skill training to theoretical models. All are labelled “experiential learning” - all are presented as part of the experiential learning family. Using the metaphor of a tree I wish to explore the roots and branches of this family. The roots being the underpinning theoretical traditions of experiential learning and the branches being the forms of practice we find ourselves working within. The roots of experiential learning will be examined using some of the traditional philosophical roots of adult education - progressive, humanist and radical. I will highlight the key values of each and their support of experiential learning. The branches will be explored using the “four-village” model proposed by Weil and McGill (1989). We will discern forms of practice emerging from the tree of experiential learning which often differ so much from each other that the practitioners sitting on one branch don’t recognise the other branches as experiential learning at all. Then I will look at the branches as seen through the eyes and work of organisations to show how the practice of experiential learning draws on these roots and branches. Finally I will examine whether the experiential learning tree is healthy and what new branches or sprouts are appearing. I will sound a warning about the need to lop off old wood to stop rot setting in and I will suggest that the roots need ongoing nourishing (fertilising) through new ideas, theories and challenges to old perspectives.\n\nThe learning experience is conducted by teachers in school to help students understand more about the subject concept during teaching and learning. This literature reveals the experienced-based learning that previously discussed by the figurative person as contained in the theory introduced by John Dewey, Kurt Lewin, Jean Piaget, William James and David Kolb. Among the biggest contributions of these five figures is to discuss how children's learning development is based on their environment and absorbing information in the environment as their knowledge. Nevertheless, the learning theory introduced by Kolb helps more in the education system to understand the environment and learning process. As the constructivist theory introduced by Piaget also believes that the sharing of the sculptor between students can help further in developing the student learning. In conclusion, these five learning theories are symbolized and interspersed with each other according to the student's learning environment and situation."
