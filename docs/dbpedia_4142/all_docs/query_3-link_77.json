Kolb said such rooms will serve children and adolescents in crisis, a real need in the community. The facility is expected to open next September.\n\nHaving cut the cord with the former Creighton University Medical Center, which is being converted to apartments, the hospital near 30th and California Streets is in the midst of renovating its clinic space and creating a more recognizable and accessible front entrance off 30th Street, including more parking.\n\nThose renovations include a new pediatric clinic and a new pediatric ophthalmology space. With the opening of a clinic in late August that provides primary care for adults, the hospital now can provide primary care for the whole family.\n\nKolb said that means the health system can serve residents of The Atlas apartment complex next door. A pedestrian bridge also connects the location to the Creighton University campus.\n\nThe health system also is looking for opportunities to expand its pediatric clinic services.\n\n“Boys Town is a great organization with a great history,” he said. “I’m really proud to be a part of that. We’ve built a special place with a special culture that I’m excited to be a part of and help continue.”\n\nKolb has been a member of Boys Town Hospital’s executive leadership team since 2006, when he joined the hospital as medical director of Boys Town National Research Hospital-West. He was appointed chief medical officer for the hospitals and clinics in 2011 and named vice president of hospital operations in 2015.\n\nKolb will continue to work as a physician. He is board-certified in pediatrics and in anesthesiology, with a subspecialty certification in pediatric anesthesiology.\n\nAmong his positions with the health system, he also has served as director of its international adoption clinic. He continues to direct its craniofacial-cleft lip and palate team.\n\nKolb said he has cut back his work with the adoption clinic. Pediatricians now have a much fuller understanding of the challenges faced by children coming from other countries. About 50 of the 500 patients followed by the craniofacial team were born in China. Kolb’s family, which includes three birth daughters, adopted two children from Romania and five from China.\n\njulie.anderson@owh.com, 402-444-1066\n\ntwitter.com/julieanderson41\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nJulie Anderson\n\nGet email notifications on {{subject}} daily!\n\nYour notification has been saved.\n\nThere was a problem saving your notification.\n\n{{description}}\n\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\n\nFollowed notifications\n\nPlease log in to use this feature\n\nLog In\n\nDon't have an account?
