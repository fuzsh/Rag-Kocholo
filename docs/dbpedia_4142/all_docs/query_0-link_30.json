        "text": "Dear editor,\n\nWe thank the referee for their positive appraisal of our white paper\n\nand recommendation to publish. We also appreciate their valuable\n\ncomments that we address below.\n\n----\n\nREFEREE\n\nThe detection sections focus on model-independent bounds on heavy dark\n\nmatter, which looks decoupled from the production mechanism. Some\n\ndiscussion is given in the direct detection section but less in the\n\nindirection part. The paper could benefit greatly from more\n\ndiscussions on detecting ultra-heavy dark matter for several\n\nmechanisms presented in Sec 2.\n\nOUR RESPONSE\n\nWe agree. The DM decay signatures we had discussed are agnostic to the\n\nexact cosmological production mechanism so long as particle DM (as\n\nopposed to PBHs, etc.) is produced.\n\nAccordingly, we have now added to the introductory paragraph of the\n\nindirect detection section the following text.\n\n\"Ultraheavy DM models in this category may be generically produced in\n\nthe early universe by a number of mechanisms discussed above,\n\nincluding freeze-out, freeze-in, gravitational production, and\n\ninvolving phase transitions.\"\n\n----\n\nREFEREE\n\nThe signatures of heavy dark matter models could also be detected by\n\ncosmological observations. The authors may consider adding some\n\ndiscussions on this.\n\nOUR RESPONSE\n\nWe appreciate the suggestion. To the end of the indirect detection\n\nsection we have added the following text.\n\n\"Finally, cosmological observations could also constrain ultraheavy\n\nDM. CMB anisotropies would carry imprints of DM scattering with SM\n\nmatter, which may be exploited to probe a wide range of DM\n\nmasses~\\cite{Dvorkin:2013cea,Gluscevic:2017ywp,Buen-Abad:2021mvc,Nguyen:2021cnb}.\n\nMoreover, ultraheavy DM produced gravitationally is accompanied by\n\nprimordial non-Gaussianities that may be enhanced and observed in the\n\nCMB power spectrum~\\cite{Li:2019ves,Li:2020xwr}.\"\n\n----\n\nREFEREE\n\nFor gravitational particle production through inflation, the authors\n\nwrote that the production is efficient when dark matter mass is\n\ncomparable to the inflationary Hubble scale. But I think the\n\nproduction is efficient when the mass is much smaller than the Hubble\n\nscale.\n\nOUR RESPONSE\n\nAs we had noted, there may be exceptions, however gravitational\n\nproduction as in WIMPzilla models is indeed generically most efficient\n\nwhen the particle mass is comparable to the Hubble scale at the end of\n\ninflation. This is stated, e.g., at the end of page 1 in\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9802238.\n\n----\n\nWith these changes we hope our manuscript will now be taken up for publication."
