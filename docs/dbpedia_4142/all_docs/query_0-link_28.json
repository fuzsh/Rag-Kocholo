This hypothetical matter is therefore called dark matter.\n\nThere are various astronomical observations that suggest the existence of dark matter\n\ngalaxy rotation curves – the speed of rotation of galaxies as a function of the distance from their center cannot be explained by the observed visible matter, but an explanation of this dependence by gravitating matter requires the presence of plenty of dark matter;\n\ncosmic microwave background fluctuations – the measured fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background are very well fitted by the standard model of cosmology with cold dark matter (CDM) included. (see also Resonaances, 18 Jan 2013).\n\nSimulations of structure formation in the universe seem to require existence of dark matter in order to reproduce results compatible with observation.\n\nAny further details about the nature of this hypothetical dark matter remain elusive to date. Possible classes of candidates go by various names. For instance “weakly interacting massive particles” (“WIMP”s), hence massive particles that interact via gravity and the weak nuclear force, but not via electromagnetism. Certain neutrino-dark matter scenarios are being discussed (Neutrino White 16) In supersymmetric theories with R-parity imposed, the lightest supersmmetric particle (LSP, such as the gravitino or the neutralino?) is traditionally regarded as a natural candidate for dark matter (EHNOS 84, reviewed in Ellis-Olive 10).\n\nOn galactic scales\n\nThe cold dark matter paradigm always worked excellently on cosmic scales, while seemingly facing problems with reproducing various observations on the scale of galaxies. But various recent computer simulations (e.g. with FIRE, see the references below) point to these problems all going away when the complex dynamics of star-formation feedback/back-reaction on galactic structure formation (see there for more) is taken into account. We discuss this for:\n\nThe cusp-core behaviour\n\nGalactic rotation profiles\n\nMissing satellites\n\nCusp-core behaviour\n\nEarly numerical simulation of dark matter exhibited dark matter halos around galaxies with a sharp density maximum at the center of the galaxy – called a “cusp” in the density profile – while observation on actual galaxies tends to favour a noticeably smoother density distribution at the center – called a “core” of the density profile.\n\nThis discrepancy between theory and experiment is (or was) known as the cusp-core problem for dark matter models (see the references below). It is (or was) one of several issues that the dark matter model has (or had) on the scale of galaxies and smaller.\n\nThere are two potential resolutions to this problem: a) Either dark matter is more “exotic” than assumed in these simulations, such as being fuzzy dark matter or similar. Or, b), more mundanely, the existing simulations do not properly resolve a subtle effect shown already by more ordinary dark matter.\n\nRecent investigations support possibility b), indicating that the density cusps seen in previous simulations are but an artifact of overly simplified numerical models, and that would-be cusps are diluted and hence smoothed out by bursty star formation leading to dark matter heating (Pontzen-Governato 14, Read-Walker-Steger-18) and/or by dynamical friction in the interstallar medium (ESH 01). See Read 19 for review.\n\nFrom Justin Read 22 Aug 2018 on Read-Walker-Steger 18:\n\nOn large scales, the standard cosmological model (LCDM) gives an excellent description of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the growth of structure. However, on small scales, in our cosmic backyard known as the Local Group, there have been long-standing puzzles. The oldest of these is the “cusp-core” problem. Gas rich dwarf galaxies have much less dark matter (DM) in their inner regions than early numerical models predicted. This could point to more exotic DM models, or to a failure of the cosmological model.\n\nHowever, there is a simpler solution. The early numerical models, above, considered a universe that contains only DM. Recent models that include gas cooling, star formation, and gas blow-out due to exploding stars find that star formation in dwarfs is bursty.\n\nThis bursty star formation occurs due to repeated cycles of gas inflow and outflow. These cause the inner gravitational potential of the dwarf galaxy to fluctuate, kinematically “heating up” the dark matter and lowering its inner density (Pontzen-Governato 14).\n\nA key prediction of such models is that, at a fixed dark matter halo mass, more star formation leads to more dark matter “heating” and, therefore, a lower inner dark matter density, at least in dwarf galaxies. This is the prediction we set out to test in Read-Walker-Steger 18.\n\nGalactic rotation profile\n\nComputer simulation (FIRE) of galactic structure formation using the standard cold dark matter model qualitatively reproduces the peculiar galactic rotation curves that motivated dark matter (or MOND, for that matter) in the first place (Hopkins et al. 17, Figure 4, Figure 5):\n\ngraphics grabbed from (Hopkins et al. 17)\n\nand also reproduces well the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (El-Badry et al. 18, Figure 4) which used to be an issue in the standard cold dark matter model:\n\ngraphics grabbed from (El-Badry et al. 18)\n\nMore in detail, galaxy rotation curves exhibit a close correlation between angular velocity and total visible enclosed math at any given radius, called the radial acceleration relation (RAR) or mass-discrepancy acceleration relation. This, too, is reproduced in cold dark matter-model (in theoretical physics) computer simulation (Santos-Santos et al. 15, Cintio-Lelli 15, Keller-Wadsley 16, Ludlow et al 16). These early simulations were not found conclusive in Lelli et al 16, section 8.2. But more detailed analysis (PSF 18) and more refined simulation (Dutton-Maccio-Obreja-Buck 19) has then been claimed to confirm the statement.\n\nA conceptual explanation of the mechanism by stellar feedback is discussed in GBFH 19.\n\nMissing satellites?\n\nOn the apparent resolution of the missing satellite problem:\n\nGarrison-Kimmel et al. 17, see Garrison-Kimmel 18\n\nRelated concepts\n\nbullet cluster\n\nfuzzy dark matter\n\ndark energy, dark radiation\n\nstandard model of cosmology\n\nMOND\n\nReferences\n\nGeneral\n\nReview:\n\nJaan Einasto, Dark matter (arXiv:0901.0632) 2009\n\nSyksy Räsänen, Dark matter cosmo 2015 lecture notes (pdf)\n\nWikipedia, Dark matter\n\nMatthew Strassler, Current hints of dark matter\n\nResonaances, How many neutrinos in the sky\n\nGianfranco Bertone, Dan Hooper, A History of Dark Matter (arXiv:1605.04909)\n\nDaniel Hooper, In Defense of Dark Matter, 2018 (web)\n\nA comprehensive review (on 510 pages):\n\nMarco Cirelli, Alessandro Strumia, Jure Zupan, Dark Matter &lbrack;arXiv:2406.01705&rbrack;\n\nDiscussion of possible matter representations that could serve as dark matter:\n\nMarco Cirelli, Nicolao Fornengo, Alessandro Strumia, Minimal Dark Matter, Nucl.
