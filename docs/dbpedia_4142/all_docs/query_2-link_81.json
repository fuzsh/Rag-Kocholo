        "text": "2024 Recipient\n\nRobert J. Gamgort '84, P'16\n\nBob Gamgort '84, P'16 credits the Bucknell community for being a catalyst for his success. He cites Bucknell's liberal arts foundation for having enabled him to study in a wide variety of classes that guided him on the path toward a rewarding career. The approachability of Bucknell professors brought the classroom content to life, and he gained valuable leadership experiences as a teaching assistant in economics and at his fraternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon. Gamgort traveled internationally for the first time when he studied abroad at the London School of Economics. He made numerous friendships, including his most important relationship: his spouse Suzanne (Sue) DeMent Gamgort '84, P'16.\n\nAfter graduating from Bucknell with a BA in economics, Gamgort earned an MBA in marketing and finance at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. From there he kicked off his 38-year career in consumer products and entertainment, leading a wide range of iconic brands and blue-chip companies.\n\nGamgort's career has been marked by brand and company turnarounds, new business creation and more than 15 merger and acquisition transactions of scale. Gamgort progressed through a series of marketing, sales, corporate strategy and general management roles before earning his first CEO position in 2009. More recently, he became Keurig Green Mountain's CEO when the company was taken private with a coalition of investors, later merging the company with the publicly traded Dr Pepper Snapple Group to create Keurig Dr Pepper, one of North America's largest beverage companies. He will move into the role of executive chairman in 2024. In addition, Gamgort is a director for Chobani and NVA & Ethos Veterinary Health companies.\n\nGamgort is a regular visitor to Bucknell's campus where he engages with students in the management classroom. He previously served as a member of the Bucknell Board of Trustees and the Bucknell Business Advisory Board. He and Sue financially support the Gateway Scholars Program, which provides first-generation college students with access to a Bucknell education. They recently celebrated their 35th wedding anniversary and have two children, Brian '16 and Kevin."
