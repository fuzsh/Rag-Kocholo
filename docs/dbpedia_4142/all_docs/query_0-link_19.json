        "text": "Alida Bouris is an Associate Professor in the University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration (SSA). Her primary research focuses on the relationship between social context and adolescent health, with a particular emphasis on understanding how parents and families can help prevent HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and unplanned pregnancies among marginalized youth aged 10-24 years old. The overall goal of Dr. Bouris’s research agenda is to develop effective interventions that capitalize on the strengths of families and other supportive persons in the lives of young people. In addition, she studies the social-contextual factors associated with poor mental health among LGBT youth of color, and how structural inequalities and co-occurring psychosocial problems are linked to health.\n\nAt SSA, Professor Bouris teaches courses on social work practice and cognitive-behavioral therapy. In 2013, she was the recipient of the William Pollak Award for Excellence in Teaching. In 2015, she received the Award for Excellence in Doctoral Student Mentoring.\n\nI specialize in the history of modern Russia and the Soviet Union, with particular interest in Soviet culture, society, and their international context. Currently, I am completing my first book, a comprehensive history of the Soviet opening to the West during the 1950s and 1960s. This project brings together the ideas that justified cultural exchange and the diplomatic negotiations that made it possible, the secrets of museum storage rooms and the publicity of radio broadcasts, lavish international film festivals and backwater countryside screenings, enormous print runs and home-made books, state-sponsored travel and emigration. I analyze the reception of Western texts, paintings, cinema, and melodies, following them as they spread to the remotest corners of the Soviet Union. Interpreting the significance that these imports acquired, I highlight translation – as a mechanism of transfer, a process of habituation, and a metaphor for cultural interaction. The book examines what happened in this encounter to entrenched ideas of class morality and cultural supremacy, familiar ways of looking at paintings, as well as the established languages of literature and cinema.\n\nFuture projects include Stalinist culture through the prism of the tango and Russia’s port cities, littoral subsystems, and maritime engagements over the past three hundred years.\n\nBefore coming to the University of Chicago, I taught at New York University.\n\nFaith Hillis is an historian of modern Russia, with a special interest in nineteenth- and twentieth-century politics, culture, and ideas. Her work explores how Russia’s peculiar political institutions—and its status as a multiethnic empire—shaped public opinion and political cultures. It also interrogates Russia’s relationship with the outside world, asking where the Russian experience belongs in the broader context of European and global history. In addition, she is interested in the theory and practice of the digital humanities.\n\nHer most recent book, Utopia’s Discontents: Russian Exiles and the Quest for Freedom, 1830–1930, was published by Oxford University Press in 2021. The book provides the first synthetic account of Europe’s “Russian colonies”—boisterous and politically fractious communities formed by exiles from the Russian empire that emerged across the continent in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The book treats the “Russian colonies” as utopian communities in which radical activists worked to transform social relations and individual behavior, and it explores how these unique spaces influenced Russian political imaginaries as well as the culture of their host societies. Ultimately, the project offers a bold reassessment of Russia’s relationship with Europe, the origins of the Russian revolution, and the creation of the Bolshevik regime.\n\nHer first book, Children of Rus’: Right-Bank Ukraine and the Invention of a Russian Nation, was published by Cornell University Press in 2013 and released in paperback in 2017. Children of Rus’ argues that it was on the extreme periphery of the tsarist empire—a region that today is located at the very center of the independent nation of Ukraine—that Russian nationalism first took shape and assumed its most potent form. The book reconstructs how nineteenth-century provincial intellectuals came to see local folk customs as the purest manifestation of an ancient nation that unified all the Orthodox East Slavs, and how they successfully propagated their ideas across the empire through lobbying and mass political mobilization. In addition, it reconceptualizes state-society relations under tsarism, showing how residents of a diverse and contested peripheral region managed to shape political ideas and identities across Russia—and even beyond its borders. Children of Rus’ was named a Choice Outstanding Academic Title for 2013.\n\nHer current research is enriched by technology, and she is interested in thinking through how historians can use digital tools to open new avenues for exploration and to communicate their findings to other scholars and the general public. She is particularly interested in using geo-spatial analysis to analyze flows of people, ideas, and commodities over time and across space. For examples of her (ongoing) work in digital cartography, see her Utopia’s Discontents website in development and her study of émigré publications.\n\nShe has held research fellowships at Columbia, Harvard, and the Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library. Her research has been funded by ACLS, IREX, Fulbright-Hays, and the NEH.\n\nRochona Majumdar is a historian of modern India with a focus on Bengal. Her writings span histories of gender and sexuality, Indian cinema, especially art cinema and film music, and modern Indian intellectual history. Majumdar also writes on postcolonial history and theory.\n\nMajumdar started out as a historian of gender and arranged marriage in colonial and postcolonial Bengal that resulted in her book Marriage and Modernity: Family Values in Colonial Bengal. Her interest in postcoloniality as an intellectual standpoint led to her second work, Writing Postcolonial History, where she analyzed the impact of postcolonial theory on a variety of historical fields. Her interests in the culture and aesthetics of mass democracy led Majumdar to study cinema, in particular Indian cinema. Currently, she is finishing a monograph entitled Art Cinema in India: Aesthetic and Political Histories and The Indian New Cinemas Reader: Texts, Debates, Histories (co-edited) with Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Moinak Biswas.\n\nFor several years, Majumdar has been interested in the question of whether certain key concepts can be translated across cultures. She has published a few essays on concepts such as “samaj” (society) and “sabhyata” (civility/civilization). This is a long-term project that will map the emergence of these and other concepts over the long nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in order to write a global history of Indian social thought.\n\nMajumdar’s work has been supported by the American Institute for Indian Studies and the Harry Frank Guggenheim foundation. She has been a visiting scholar at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Emotions, Berlin and IWM, Vienna.\n\nMajumdar also writes for The Indian Express, Outlook and Anandabazar Patrika (in Bengali).\n\nMichael Rossi is Associate Professor of the History of Medicine, the Conceptual and Historical Studies of Science, and the College at the University of Chicago. A historian of medicine and science in the United States from the nineteenth century to the present, his work focuses on the historical and cultural metaphysics of the body: how different people at different times understood questions of beauty, truth, falsehood, pain, pleasure, goodness, and reality vis-à-vis their corporeal selves and those of others.\n\nHis first book manuscript traces the origins of color science—the physiology, psychology, and physics of color—in the late-nineteenth-century United States to a series of questions about what modern America ought to be: about the scope of medical, scientific, and political authority over the sensing body; about the nature of aesthetic, physiological, and cultural development between individual and civilization; about the relationship between aesthetic harmony, physiological balance, and social order.\n\nHis second project looks at how linguists, anatomists, and speech pathologists moved, over the course of the twentieth century, from viewing language as a function of sound-producing organs (tongue, lips, palate, larynx, etc.) to searching for a notional “language organ” within the brains of all human beings. Such interpretative shifts in understanding human anatomy are neither an ancient phenomenon nor one limited to extreme medical specialization, but rather are ongoing issues, providing a window on the social, political, and philosophical understanding of modern bodies, medicine, and science.\n\nPrior to Chicago, Michael was a postdoctoral fellow in the Groupe Histoire des sciences de l’homme at the Ecole Normale Superieur de Cachan in France. He received a PhD in the history and anthropology of science, technology, and society from MIT and an AB from Columbia University.\n\nCaleigh Bell-Rosof (they/them) is the Program Advisor for the Master of Liberal Arts (MLA) program at the Graham School. In this role, they help manage outreach and advising for the Graham School’s educational programming, specifically serving as the lead advisor to and recruiter of prospective students considering enrollment in the MLA at the Graham School. You can contact Caleigh at cbellrosof@uchicago.edu.\n\nOriginally from New York, Caleigh graduated from Northwestern University with a B.A. in American Studies and a minor in Legal Studies. While at Northwestern, they worked in the admissions office as a tour guide, and they completed an interdisciplinary honors thesis examining radical imagination, queer politics, and prison abolition through a media studies lens.\n\nCaleigh was also a member of the Northwestern University Sailing Team, and in their free time, weather permitting (which it hardly does), they try to spend as much time as they can outside and around Lake Michigan.\n\nMillie Rey guides students through the process of conceiving of and executing their academic and professional projects through the medium of writing instruction and by collaborating with other instructional partners at the University. She designs and implements instruction that aims to remove obstacles that adult learners face, helps them develop critical thinking skills and leads them to gain a better understanding of what they aim to achieve. Contact Millie: merey@uchicago.edu\n\nMillie is committed to using writing instruction to empower others to confidently pursue their mission. She created a non-profit organization that supported teachers in becoming leaders and better instructors by coaching them on reflective practice. As a consultant, she supports various organizations in helping their professionals and students think more critically and write more incisively. Millie earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history with a minor in French from Bates College, and a master’s degree in TESOL/applied linguistics from Teachers College, Columbia University. She is currently ABD in sociology at The University of Chicago.\n\nSeth Green was appointed Dean of the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies on July 1, 2021.
