        "text": "The Edward Zlotkowski Faculty Service Learning Award\n\nThe Edward Zlotkowski Faculty Award for Service-Learning annually recognizes a faculty member for innovations in engaged scholarship that integrate service into the curriculum and for efforts to institutionalize service-learning in his/her discipline, school, college and the university.\n\nDeadline for Nominations for the prestigious Edward Zlotkowski Faculty Service Learning Award for the 2022 - 2023 academic year is, Monday, March 20, 2023. The award annually recognizes a faculty member for innovations in engaged scholarship that integrate service into the curriculum and for efforts to institutionalize service-learning in his/her discipline, school, college and the university.\n\nShould you have questions or need additional information, please feel free to contact Dr. Ricardo Gonzalez, Director-Ettling Center for Civic Leadership & Sustainability at (210) 832-3208 or rigonza4@uiwtx.edu.\n\nNomination Form\n\nRead about previous recipients of the award below. A person may only receive the award once.\n\nEdward Zlotkowski is a nationally recognized scholar and author in the field of engaged scholarship and service-learning. Read about Dr. Zlotkowski and his 21-volume Series on Service-Learning in the Disciplines. His work was a positive influence at the University of the Incarnate Word starting in the late 1990s and helped establish faculty practice here. UIW faculty realized that service had been a part of student learning since our beginnings with Incarnate Word Sisters teaching nursing and that more formal structures of service learning were needed.\n\nExamples of engaged scholarship, community service, and service-learning embedded in our Incarnate Word history can be seen in this overview. Recent examples and stories can be seen in the booklets and postings for the annual Service Learning and Engaged Scholarship Showcase which began in 2017.\n\nIn 1996, Ernest Boyer wrote about “The Scholarship of Engagement” in the Journal of Public Service and Outreach: “…[T]he academy must become a more vigorous partner in the search for answers to our most pressing social, civic, economic, and moral problems, and must reaffirm its historic commitment to what I call the scholarship of engagement.”\n\nAs a way of encouraging service and scholarship about it, the Edward Zlotkowski Faculty Award for Service-Learning was established in 2002. The founding of the Ettling Center for Civic Engagement in 2013 gave firmer support for faculty to use service-learning and engage scholarship. Please see the Faculty Resources page for a broad overview and especially consider Service and Service Learning Guidelines and Faculty Resources for Assistance and Scholarship.\n\nOne may nominate any faculty member or one's self. The criteria: A faculty person who gives examples of “innovations in engaged scholarship that integrates service into the curriculum and for efforts to institutionalize service-learning in his/her discipline, school or college, and the university.” Please include about 500 words about this person's contributions."
