We then assess how field-based engagement contributes to student learning by providing valuable opportunities for engaging holistically, skills development and critical thinking, social and emotional learning, and reflective practice. An example of a field-based course is presented in detail. A subsequent section reviews the models for engaged learning courses and their variations, including online versions. Field-based learning and teaching can pose significant challenges to students and instructors, who may feel stretched outside their comfort zone. In reviewing these challenges, including the difficulty of assessing student learning in the field, we highlight the need to foreground ethics and engage in reflective practice to ensure a successful field-based experience and thus deepen student learning and instructor satisfaction, especially in situations of conflict.",
