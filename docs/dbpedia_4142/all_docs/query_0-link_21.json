Unfortunately that idea itself now seems to have a few holes.\n\nIn 1998, astronomers found that distant supernovae were dimmer, and thus farther away, than expected. According to the standard model of cosmology, which assumes that the universe is homogenous on large scales, this suggested that the expansion of the universe was speeding up.
