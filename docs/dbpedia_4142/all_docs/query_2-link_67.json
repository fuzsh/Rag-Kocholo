We connect students with our local not-for-profit partners so they can collaborate on projects that will sharpen their skills and broaden their worldviews.\n\nSUNY Oswego is one of the 119 U.S. colleges and universities to receive the Carnegie Community Engagement Classification, and has received recognition for our service-learning programs."
