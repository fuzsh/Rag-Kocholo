        "text": "The aim of this paper is to answer the following two questions: (1) Given cosmological observations of the expansion history and linear perturbations in a range of redshifts and scales as precise as is required, which of the properties of dark energy could actually be reconstructed without imposing any parameterization? (2) Are these observables sufficient to rule out not just a particular dark energy model, but the entire general class of viable models comprising a single scalar field? This paper bears both good and bad news. On one hand, we find that the goal of reconstructing dark energy models is fundamentally limited by the unobservability of the present values of the matter density Omega_m0, the perturbation normalization sigma_8 as well as the present matter power spectrum. On the other, we find that, under certain conditions, cosmological observations can nonetheless rule out the entire class of the most general single scalar-field models, i.e. those based on the Horndeski Lagrangian.\n\nThis comment on the Big Bang and universal expansion claims they don't exist - reflecting the doubts of Albert Einstein and, perhaps surprisingly, the lifelong doubts of Edwin Hubble who is usually credited with discovery of that expansion. For supporting details, the commentary draws on quantum entanglement and its possible extrapolation to macroscopic or macro-entanglement. It also replaces cosmological redshift – due to the supposed expansion of spacetime - with gravitational redshift because of General Relativity's statement that gravity is the curves and warps in space-time and space-time (the universe) therefore is a continuum of gravitational waves - some large, powerful and presently detectable; most tiny, weak and undetected. It also presents a novel, but very simple, mathematical approach called \"vector-tensor-scalar geometry\" which may help explain, with Stephen Hawking’s assistance, the “mass from gravity” concept, gravitational-electromagnetic unification, the Higgs boson, the particles of the nuclear forces, planet formation and black holes.\n\nIn these lectures I examine some of the principal issues in cosmology from a particle physics point of view. I begin with nucleosynthesis and show how the primordial abundance of the light elements can help fix the number of (light) neutrino species and determine the ratio $\\eta$ of baryons to photon in the universe now. The value of $\\eta$ obtained highlights two of the big open problems of cosmology: the presence of dark matter and the need for baryogenesis. After discussing the distinction between hot and cold dark matter, I examine the constraints on, and prospect for, neutrinos as hot dark matter candidates. I show next that supersymmetry provides a variety of possibilities for dark matter, with neutralinos being excellent candidates for cold dark matter and gravitinos, in some scenarios, possibly providing some form of warm dark matter. After discussing axions as another cold dark matter candidate, I provide some perspectives on the nature of dark matter before turning to baryogenesis. Here I begin by outlining the Sakharov conditions for baryogenesis before examining the issues and challenges of producing a, large enough, baryon asymmetry at the GUT scale. I end my lectures by discussing the Kuzmin-Rubakov-Shaposhnikov mechanism and issues associated with electrical baryogenesis. In particular, I emphasize the implications that generating the baryon asymmetry at the electroweak scale has for present-day particle physics."
