        "text": "For billions of years, our planet was nothing like Earth. It was Earth, of course. But if you looked at it from space, it kind of resembled a giant orange jawbreaker.\n\nMost people don’t realize that Earth’s atmosphere wasn’t always the one we have right now. Its first atmosphere presumably had a lot of hydrogen gas, which was very quickly (relative to the planet’s 4.5-billion-year history) stripped away by solar wind. Earth regenerated a new atmosphere of primarily carbon dioxide, and maybe some water vapor and nitrogen, but no oxygen.\n\nYet there was life on the planet — anaerobic organisms to which oxygen was poisonous. Eventually, though, the cyanobacteria present in huge numbers on Earth’s surface began to produce oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, and it built up in the atmosphere, causing a mass extinction. Life shifted into a different phase. Fueled by that oxygen, it evolved, became more complex. Advanced life on Earth, the air that we breathe, we owe to cyanobacteria from more than 2.5 billion years ago.\n\nJacob Bean, an astronomer and astrophysicist at the University of Chicago, is explaining all this to me in his fifth-floor office in the William Eckhardt Research Center, a gleaming glass building at 56th and Ellis. He speaks with a round and genial Southern accent that sounds like Matt Damon playing a farmer. Standing 5-foot-9, Bean, 43, has a strong jaw, a shaved head, and the posture of a cactus. Wearing a cream-colored sweater, dark jeans, and lime-aqua Hoka sneakers, he looks like a personal trainer, not someone who cocreated a pioneering astronomical instrument called MAROON-X, a much-flashier name than what it stands for: “M dwarf Advanced Radial velocity Observer Of Neighboring eXoplanets.”\n\nFor now, ignore what any of that means except for the last word. “Exoplanet” is short for “extrasolar planet,” denoting any planet outside our solar system — that is, not orbiting our sun. Astronomers estimate there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone, nearly all orbited by at least one planet, and 100 billion galaxies in the known universe. That’s a lot of planets! And endless avenues of inquiry for Bean, whose specialty is exoplanets. “It’s called job security,” Bean says.\n\nFor a long time, exoplanet science was a fringe sector of astrophysics. When Bean was a graduate student in the mid-2000s, virtually no one wanted to concentrate in it. Since then, however, aspiring astrophysicists have come to realize that exoplanets are the key to understanding not just the nature of planets but the evolution of Earth’s atmosphere, helping us fill in the gaps of our knowledge about our planet’s past and even its future. Today, Bean surmises that exoplanet specialists make up roughly 25 percent of the field. And within that community, he’s on the forefront. “He’s one of the world leaders in the field, without question,” says Sara Seager, an astrophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nIn addition to running the university’s Bean Exoplanet Group, a nine-person research team, Bean coleads the Early Science Release Program on the James Webb Space Telescope, the trailblazing, paradigm-shifting instrument that launched in late 2021. That means he’s one of some 300 scientists who get the first look at data generated by the telescope, which he analyzes for atmospheric characterization of exoplanets.\n\nIt’s a good position to be in, because the telescope promises to revolutionize our understanding of these mysterious worlds. Astronomers have identified more than 5,000 exoplanets, but they don’t know all that much about them. With Webb, Bean and his colleagues will be able to observe these far-flung planets in greater detail than ever, allowing them to uncover new truths about how planets, including our own, form and evolve — and someday, perhaps, to discover other habitable worlds beyond our solar system. Maybe even another planet like Earth.\n\n“The technology that we have has opened this window to the universe that we didn’t have before,” Bean says. “There’s a whole lot of questions that I think are really interesting that are answerable.” But he isn’t getting too far ahead of himself. “I’m living in the moment, and the moment is the planets that we’re able to study right now.”\n\nThat may be true. But because there’s still so much to learn, there’s also tremendous opportunity to make the kinds of discoveries that land scientists not just in textbooks but in the history books. And the biggest question for those who study exoplanets is perhaps the biggest question there is for humankind: Is anybody else out there?\n\nEdward “Rocky” Kolb, who was the chair of the astronomy department at the U. of C., hired Bean in 2011. He had many reasons for selecting him, but Kolb makes sure to single out one in particular: “He had a goal in mind.”\n\nAnd what was that goal?\n\n“For people in the field, the thing that they really want to do, the big prize, the ring that you grab, how you go to Stockholm, is to discover life someplace else in the universe,” Kolb shouts, waving his hands in the air in an outward arc. “I think it will be done in our lifetime. And it’s going to happen once in human history. Jacob wants to do it. There’ll be a lot of people who play a role, but somebody’s going to do it.”\n\nIf Bean ends up discovering life elsewhere in the universe, I can’t imagine a more mundane place to do it from than his office. Even though he spends a lot of time sitting at his computer, there isn’t a stray piece of paper or a loose pen anywhere. The room feels less like the overstuffed library of a science nerd and more like the antiseptic domicile of a serial killer. To break the ice, I ask Bean if he was into The X-Files when he was younger. He just responds, “No,” without laughing. (This happened after he announced, unprompted, “I’m after the truth.”) “I’m a boring guy,” he says falsely.\n\nHe has a noticeable scar above his left eye, which he won’t talk about. “It’s not interesting,” he says.\n\nWhy not?\n\n“Because it’s not interesting,” he says, twice, sternly.\n\nHowever the mark originated, Bean asserts that it has nothing to do with rock climbing, a sport he pursues with near-monastic devotion. He climbs three days a week, which explains why he’s in incredible shape. When I ask what he loves about Chicago, he says, “It has an amazing number of climbing gyms.”\n\nIt’s a fitting hobby, because Bean is a flinty guy. “When I talk to people about Jacob or when they tell me about him, some people describe being kind of intimidated by meeting him, because he’s very straightforward and intense,” says Andreas Seifahrt, his longtime colleague. “That kind of approach, rough edges, there’s not a lot of social niceties.”\n\nBean rarely makes eye contact. And if he ever gets excited — by which I mean his voice rises a fraction of an octave — it’s invariably when he’s discussing science.\n\nA simple question about astrophysics typically yields a 10-minute answer, a conversational map of his brain bouncing around among his joys, frustrations, and formidable knowledge of the discipline. His responses often end with a series of rhetorical questions, such as the ones that followed my query about the possibility of detecting a planet like Earth: “What’s the star like? What’s the high-energy output from the star now? What was it in the past? How would that interact with an atmosphere that probably formed? Can we say anything about the composition of that planet — and thus what kind of atmosphere it outcasts? What’s the chemistry in the atmosphere right now? Does that have any telltale clues about how lighter gases were lost over time?”\n\nBut the most animated I ever see Bean is when he’s talking about the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nDo you remember when NASA released the first images captured by the Webb telescope on July 12, 2022? I do. It felt like only one word could describe the pictures that appeared all over the news: Whoa.\n\nLook no farther than — actually, scratch that. Look very far: at the Carina Nebula, a star-forming region in the Milky Way that’s about 7,500 light-years from Earth. Images of it already existed before Webb, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. They are undeniably gorgeous, emanating the oceanic blue of a Chagall stained-glass window. But the Webb images are positively mind-blowing: cliffs of caramel clouds covered by a mist of Egyptian blue dappled with diamond twinkles, a nighttime backdrop in a cyborg-crafted psychedelic Disney cartoon.\n\nThe Webb images of exoplanets, however, aren’t especially ornate or spectacular — in fact, they’re pretty unimpressive. A rendering of WASP-39b, a Jupiter-like planet about 700 light-years from Earth, shows a sliver of a gaseous purple planet lit by a distant star. OK, kind of cool. But it lacks the stunning detail of Webb’s first transmissions. It looks a little like the cover of a bad dubstep album.\n\nBut that doesn’t make what’s pictured any less wondrous. Actually, it represents a groundbreaking discovery: In August 2022, a team co-led by Bean definitively detected carbon dioxide on the planet. It was a finding with enormous significance, because carbon dioxide had never before been conclusively found in an exoplanet’s atmosphere. And since carbon dioxide is a gas made up of one carbon atom bonded to two oxygen atoms, it meant the atmosphere contained oxygen. So why is that a big deal? After all, oxygen is the third-most-abundant element in the universe, right? Well, on Earth we have both carbon dioxide and molecular oxygen, or O2 (a molecule composed of two oxygen atoms bound together). The presence of oxygen doesn’t guarantee there’s life, but molecular oxygen might. “That’s the stuff we breathe produced by plant life on Earth, and we think that’s the smoking-gun evidence for life on a planet,” Bean says.\n\nThat’s not to say Bean and his colleagues can assert that life has ever existed on WASP-39b, or even that it has O2. But with each step in pinpointing chemical compounds that are the same as the ones we have on Earth, the nearer scientists get to determining if life has ever existed on those planets.\n\nWhen I ask Bean how many discoveries like this are happening right now because of Webb, he shoots back, “I’ve got so much to say about that.” And he does. He begins by addressing something many exoplanet researchers have noted, which is that Webb’s performance has exceeded even their highest expectations. Bean references the throughput, or the amount of light that a telescope’s sensors can register. Earlier telescopes like Hubble had less throughput, so they could provide astronomers only limited data about a planet’s atmosphere.\n\nTo explain the shortcomings of working with such data, Bean uses the parable of the blind men and the elephant. “It was like you’d see the toe, and scientists would infer, ‘It’s got a trunk, it’s gray.’ But still, all I’m seeing is a toe. I don’t know how big the elephant is. I can’t even say if the rest of it’s gray.” With Webb, you can now see the whole elephant.\n\nSeeing the whole elephant introduced a new problem, though Bean is quick to say it’s a good one. After the WASP-39b breakthrough, Bean and his team later spotted carbon dioxide in other giant exoplanets similar to Jupiter. But since the amount of carbon dioxide is so different between these planets, it’s probable that they didn’t all form the same way, upending what astrophysicists believed they knew about them. “We’re struggling to separate out plausible scenarios,” Bean says. “These planets are not as homogeneous as we thought they were. And maybe we should have known better. The complexity is higher than what we anticipated, and that adds additional uncertainty.” In other words, with each new discovery, astrophysicists somehow get both closer to and further away from truly understanding how planets form and evolve.\n\nA telescopic transmission comes back as pure data, incomprehensible to anyone outside the field . (It resembles what you’d see on an EKG monitor or a chart drawn by an old computer program — which is then mapped onto a graph before it’s handed over to artists for renderings.) The Webb data on exoplanets initially produced a flood of big revelations, but now comes the slow and painstaking process of sifting through the nuances and statistical imperfections, which may shift our knowledge of planets yet again.\n\nJust as Earth wasn’t always the planet it is now, the exoplanets we’re studying weren’t always the way they are when they’re captured by a telescope. When something like Webb transmits data from a star, it’s not recording the present moment. As Bean reminds me, we’re seeing galaxies from the very beginning of the universe; Webb’s First Deep Field — the first image the telescope captured and the deepest ever view of the cosmos — is an image of galaxy cluster SMACS 0723 as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago, because of the time it takes for light to travel. By and large, astronomy is a snapshot of an object at one moment in its vast history. Even though Webb is extraordinarily powerful, it’s rare to see a planet change during observation.\n\nWe’re only beginning to scratch the surface. From Kepler, a space telescope launched in 2009 as part of NASA’s first planet-hunting initiative, we learned that sub-Neptune-size planets, which are larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune (whose radius is 3.88 times that of Earth), are the most common in the galaxy. Roughly half of all sun-like stars have sub-Neptune-size planets close to them. No one knows why. We don’t even know all that much about our own solar system’s Neptune.\n\nIdentifying more planets is still a significant chunk of exoplanet science. Of the 5,000 planets that astrophysicists can currently confirm, only a few hundred are feasible for atmospheric characterization, at least right now. And remember: There are 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone, to say nothing of the universe, all of them with their own planets yet to be discovered.\n\nIn the astronomy community, there’s a distinction between an observer, who collects data, and a theorist, who speculates about what that information means. Bean is classified as an observer, and he owns the label, though he’s a little uncomfortable with its implications. “The observers, you’re not allowed to be wrong at all, ever,” he says. “But the theorists, all you have to do is be right once.” He claims this in jest, but it clearly bothers him. Bean admits that he has a huge chip on his shoulder: “I’m convinced that most people who are successful in science are driven by that. They have something to prove to themselves and to everyone else because it takes so much persistence to do this.”\n\nYou can trace this scrappiness to his upbringing in Chatsworth, a small city in northeast Georgia. “I like to say it’s so rural that I have a hard time saying ‘rural,’ ” he quips. Bean’s parents both taught middle school science and math and often took their only child out to look at the night sky through a telescope. “I wasn’t one of those kids that was very precocious and said, ‘I’m going to do astronomy research.’ I just remember being cold as the dickens.”\n\nInstead, Bean’s childhood excursions encouraged a lifelong interest in the outdoors. His family took trips to Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming. “Most people where I grew up, outdoor stuff to them meant going hunting,” he says. Bean was a Boy Scout well into high school, where he excelled at math. He was accepted into the Governor’s Honors Program, a six-week residential summer program for gifted students. “There were kids from all over the state,” Bean recalls. “The smartest kids were only there because they didn’t get into the MIT summer program. They were so much more knowledgeable about math than I was. Honestly, if you asked people who knew me when I was growing up, they would probably use the word ‘genius’ for me, which is completely insane. I was a smart kid, but they had no idea what a real genius was.”\n\nHe went to Georgia Tech intending to be an aerospace engineer, but he grew disillusioned with the field during a summer internship at Raytheon. He didn’t like the idea of being beholden to a big company, and he found the work boring. He wanted to do something more creative and was determined to ask bigger questions. “At the time, the big questions in astrophysics were focused on cosmology, which is the origin and evolution of our entire universe,” he says. “You can’t ask a bigger question than that. And I wanted to be more in control of my own destiny. Academia could offer me a chance to be my own boss sooner rather than later in life, and that was really important. I didn’t want to be a cog in a wheel. I wanted to be the wheel itself.”\n\nIt would take a long time before Bean would become a wheel, or even a spoke or a hubcap. He applied to numerous doctoral programs and was rejected from all but one, at the University of Texas at Austin. When he arrived there, Bean already knew he was going to focus on exoplanets. In 2002, his senior year in college, he attended an American Astronomical Society conference and saw presentations on extrasolar planets. “In Star Trek, they were always traveling to different planets,” he says. “I was like, Holy cow, in astronomy, you can find planets around other stars and study them? And somehow it hit me.”\n\nAt UT Austin, Bean was confronted with an astrophysics faculty that, frankly, thought he was a dud. “In my candidacy examination, the main person in the department pretty much told everybody I was never going to amount to anything and everybody was just wasting their time with me.” He characterizes himself as a “so-so” grad student who was constantly banging his head against the wall. The problem was that Bean had immediately sought to do the impossible.\n\nIn exoplanet study, stars are crucial because they can tell us about the planets orbiting them. Bean’s dissertation was on the metallicity of M dwarf stars, essentially the smallest stars in the universe. Metallicity refers to the proportion of an object’s elements that are heavier than hydrogen and helium, a measurement that is easy to conduct on sun-like stars. But since M dwarfs are so cold, the atoms in their atmospheres combine to form molecules, making them much more difficult to understand. Bean boldly thought he could be the person to parse this issue, but he underestimated how much data he’d get back — “a forest of a mess” of it, he says. “Decoding that is basically impossible, but I tried.”\n\nBean was nearly done for when an opportunity arose from an unlikely place. Toward the end of his doctoral program, Bean heard from his adviser, who had made a planet discovery with a team that no longer wanted to work together. He passed the initial findings on to Bean, who then wrote the software — writing software is a big part of being an astronomer — to finish the work. The program Bean created applied the radial velocity method, a popular strategy for exoplanet detection based on the movement of the star a planet orbits. (Astrophysicists rarely detect planets through direct imaging; the telescope is usually trained on a star, and the planet is identified by observing the motion around its host.)\n\nWhen it came to postdoc work, Bean was, once again, turned down by every program but one: the Institute for Astrophysics in Göttingen, Germany. That’s where he met Seifahrt, an astronomical instrument builder who’d recently completed a doctorate at the European Southern Observatory near Munich. While there, Seifahrt worked on an instrument that more precisely measured the signals of planets around M dwarf stars. Bean and Seifahrt immediately saw how their interests, research, and dispositions were similar, and the observer and instrument builder knew they’d make a formidable team.\n\nBean and Seifahrt set out to create a calibration system for the ESO telescope. Their device conducted radial velocity measurements in the spectrum of a planet called the near infrared, something astronomers hadn’t thought possible. With this innovation, Bean and Seifahrt made their first real breakthrough, not by detecting new planets, but rather by showing that because astrophysicists had been misreading host star signals, the planets they thought they had observed didn’t actually exist. Between 2008 and 2010, Bean wrote a number of papers proving people wrong. While he debunked just two planets, it was a big deal at a time when few exoplanets had been discovered. Nature, one of the world’s leading scientific journals, published a story about how Bean and Seifahrt were killing other people’s planets.\n\n“The establishment wasn’t so established at the time,” Bean says. “The exoplanet people in 2010 were outsiders already. And we were outside those people.”\n\nYou’d think that trash-talking the bogus planets of other astrophysicists would draw their ire, but it had the opposite effect. Suddenly major institutes wanted to work with Bean, in particular the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, where the findings he challenged originated. “A key thing about exoplanets at the time is there were no instruments,” Bean says. “Most people were trying to use standard astronomy tools in a really weird way, and they saw me as this guy who’s figured out how to use this instrument that wasn’t supposed to do [exoplanets]. They loved it.”\n\nIn 2010, Bean started another postdoc fellowship at Harvard, studying the exoplanet he’s perhaps most famous for: GJ 1214b, a Neptune-like planet, whose host star is 48 light-years from the sun, that was first spotted in 2009. He was able to secure around 90 hours of observational time on the Hubble telescope to study this one exoplanet, venturing that it would serve as an archetype for Neptune-like planets. Even so, Bean and his team could find no trace of molecules in its atmosphere. From that intensive observation, though, they were able to establish that GJ 1214b has clouds extremely high in its atmosphere that don’t allow starlight to get through, making it impossible to ever figure out what molecules exist there, no matter how long and hard telescopes train on it. Bean calls it “the most famous flatline in astronomy.”\n\n“It was spectacular observational work,” says Nikku Madhusudhan, an astrophysicist at the University of Cambridge. “It was a major advancement in saying, ‘What is the error bar? What is the sensitivity you can get from those sorts of observations?’ ” Bean and his team didn’t just expose a new kind of planet — they provided astrophysicists a new road map for how intensive observations need to be in order to draw a conclusion from them. Madhusudhan praises Bean’s observations as “art.”\n\nBetween his planet-killing papers and innovative instrument building, Bean was a promising catch for the University of Chicago, which sought enterprising postdocs to build an exoplanet group from scratch. And when Bean came to the school, he brought Seifahrt with him. They spent much of the 2010s working on the aforementioned MAROON-X, a planet detection device that’s now attached to the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii.\n\nIt was a prestigious appointment, but Bean nevertheless saw it as a continuation of a pattern of rejection. “People who’ve been in this career, they got into a bunch of grad schools and they picked one. They got a bunch of postdoc offers and they picked one. They get a bunch of faculty offers and they pick one. I applied for a number of jobs that year and interviewed at a few places, but the only place I got an offer was from UChicago.” I have to remind him: It’s not a bad offer.\n\nExtraterrestrial life, if it’s out there somewhere, probably doesn’t look as you’d expect. It is almost certainly not, Bean stresses, an intelligent form — it won’t be little green men — but rather like those microbial bacteria that were the longest-existing life forms on Earth. “Intelligent life would be fascinating to discover, but astronomers are probably not the people who would do that,” he says. “The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, SETI [a nonprofit institute spun out of a NASA effort], they’re using radio telescopes to look and try to receive signals. That’s the shortcut to finding an unambiguous signal of intelligent life out there. Most astronomers are doing it in a more step-by-step way: Let’s find a planet that could have liquid water.” As Bean explains, all life on Earth needs two things: DNA and liquid water. And you can’t have DNA without liquid water. So if you’re searching for life somewhere else in the universe, liquid water is where you’d look.\n\nBean feels like astrophysicists are looking a little too purposefully and not hard enough. Madhusudhan, for example, made a monumental discovery in September when a team he led detected methane in the Neptune-like exoplanet K2-18b. Since oceans require methane in the atmosphere, Madhusudhan theorizes that such bodies of water might exist beneath the atmosphere of the planet.\n\nBean has a hard time stomaching Madhusudhan’s theory. Unless it’s empirically undeniable that there’s water on K2-18b, Bean isn’t willing to speculate. “I just don’t believe it,” he says. “Are his models wrong? No. Is he making bad assumptions? Perhaps. Or overinterpreting? Yes.”\n\nMadhusudhan laughs after I read him this quote. “When he says he does not believe, that makes me smile. Because as scientists, we don’t believe, we just work with observational constraints. So you either use the constraints and make a cogent argument, or you don’t.”\n\nAstronomy isn’t an adversarial field, and, as Madhusudhan points out, any heated arguments arise because of the epochal advances being made in astrophysics today. “This is the nature of the cutting edge,” he says. “When you have a cutting-edge observation, you have to realize this is the first time such observations have ever been possible in the history of humanity.”\n\nBean would be thrilled to be able to prove the existence of life on an exoplanet, but ever the realist, he’s dubious it will happen. “I wish I could fly, but I can’t,” he says. “It’s just the limitations of the technology that we have. We’re waiting another 20 years or so for the telescope that will really do this.”\n\nEven so, for four years Bean taught a course at the U. of C. called the Search for Extraterrestrial Life. Describing it, he launches into an extremely long and unwieldy explanation that encompasses the existence of liquid water on Mars, whether the impact of a large asteroid could launch molecules from one planet to another, and “water interacting with rock causing a disequilibrium chemistry that life could get energy from and exist.” I decide not to ask him if Close Encounters of the Third Kind could happen in real life.\n\nHis larger point is that the search for extraterrestrial life is a great crash course in learning about the cosmos: “There’s a lot of science that underlies the properties of planets, the objects in our solar system, understanding how we find and characterize exoplanets, and what the status of exoplanet science is.”\n\nAll of this speaks to a pattern in Bean’s work, a degree of rigor that’s nearly ruthless. He isn’t on a maniacal search for aliens — he’s simply a very disciplined and accomplished astrophysicist set on using evidence and reason to learn incrementally more about space. (“Precision, not accuracy” is a maxim he invokes often about his work.) Nothing is definitive in his mind unless all alternative scenarios have been disproved. In astrophysics, this is both Bean’s strength and his weakness. “Some people have seen things in their data recently that turned out to be real and were really interesting discoveries,” he says. “When I look at it, I’m like, ‘I would’ve never believed that.’ And that’s a problem for me because I need to keep an open mind.”\n\nI ask Bean if he’s ever daunted by the scale of space, the innumerable planets beyond our galaxy. He mentions his romantic partner’s 12-year-old daughter. “She is more artistic, more creative, and it’s scary for her. For me, it’s just reduced down to equations and graphs and stuff like that. For her, she pictures this emptiness above her head. I can write down a set of equations on this blackboard that describes how the universe works: ‘That’s it, right?’ ”\n\nPerhaps I should have considered my own fears of space before I spoke with Bean. After our meeting in his office, I spent the next few days anxious and agonized, constantly turning over the information I’d absorbed. “Did you know our atmosphere isn’t even the first one Earth had?” I asked a group of people at dinner out of nowhere. Suddenly I’d become an amateur astrophysicist, drunkenly unloading on an Uber driver: “Do you realize how improbable it is that you even exist? We are just a freak occurrence in nature!” Then I told him, haphazardly and loudly, how terrestrial planets (those like Earth or Mars that are made up mostly of silicate rocks or metals) aren’t even the most common type of planet in the known universe, as if I were playing Matthew McConaughey’s character in True Detective, without an aura of mystique, freakishly good looks, or a charming Southern accent.\n\nWhatever confidence I had in my understanding of astrophysics after I left Bean’s office was dispelled when I sat in on his course at the U. of C. This winter quarter, he taught only one undergraduate course, simply titled Exoplanets. On the day I visited, a gray and wet morning in late January, the room was packed, four rows of tables shaped in a semicircle completely occupied by close to three dozen bleary-eyed undergrads. It was two days before the midterm exam, and Bean stressed that information from this lecture would be on the test. He spoke about something called gravitational microlensing, which he described as “the craziest exoplanet detection technique there is.”\n\nI wish I could tell you what gravitational microlensing is, but I found it virtually impossible to comprehend. My notes say it involves a change in brightness and the dynamics of movement and light — but they also say: “Einstein radius, various measurements. I’m totally lost.” I have to assume the students were geniuses, especially the one I sat directly behind, who must absorb information through osmosis because he spent the entire class looking at sports gambling sites on his laptop.\n\nBean seems optimistic, and maybe even a bit threatened, by the new astrophysicists entering the field. “I have a postdoc who is a real whiz with computers,” Bean says. “He said AI has solved the protein-folding problem in biology. I barely understand how it works, but this is a real growth area in astronomy.”\n\nBean admits that he feels like an old man in the field (again, he’s 43): “My best creative years are probably behind me. My role now is, I think, much more about supporting the younger people in my group who come in with their ideas and helping them sharpen those ideas, flesh them out.”\n\nThis is in line with Bean’s current duties, which involve more management, and his preference for working collaboratively. He relishes overseeing large teams, like Webb’s Early Science Release Program, where he keeps projects on track, facilitates resources for other astrophysicists and researchers, and lobbies for observation time. “I would’ve thought scientific management is just pushing paper and making sure everyone gets paid,” he says. “But there’s a real reason why you have managers in these kinds of projects, to keep an eye on the science that ultimately you want to achieve. And to make decisions about what’s good enough, what problems are worth pursuing, what problems could be solvable, what problems are important, and what things are just a nuisance.”\n\nOf maximum importance is trying to gather more information about exoplanet surfaces, a relatively new frontier. Recently, through Webb, astrophysicists have observed infrared light emitted from the surface of a terrestrial exoplanet, allowing scientists to detect its temperature — the first detection of light from an exoplanet resembling our own solar system’s rocky worlds. And they’ve detected the surface of a different terrestrial exoplanet with no atmosphere around it whatsoever. These are huge developments, simply because they further our knowledge of planetary evolution.\n\nBean and his team at the U. of C. are also studying rocky exoplanets that are colder than expected. His group is busy trying to figure out what it is about their atmospheres, or lack thereof, and surfaces that causes this. He returns to the elephant analogy: “I want to see all the animals on the savanna. It’s my personality to go more toward the sure thing and then also to spread out and try to see the whole picture.”\n\nThe first time I met Bean was at Movement, a gym in Lincoln Park. When I arrived at 11 a.m., Bean, who was outfitted in a climbing belt, a gray T-shirt, and black athletic shorts, had already been climbing for an hour.\n\nThe climbing walls at Movement can reach 56 feet. In a typical session, Bean will do 12 to 15 full climbs, starting with the most challenging and working his way down.\n\nI watched as Bean pivoted and grabbed with ease, contorting his body into a pretzel, bending sideways, his legs at times forming a 90-degree angle. He moved with the backboneless fluidity of a centipede, going so high it nearly gave me a panic attack. But there was an efficiency and joylessness to his routine that made it feel like he was merely exercising, rather than doing the thing he claims to love more than anything outside of work. And this carried over to our discussions: Though they were thorough and wide-ranging, I’d always sensed Bean was holding something back.\n\nBut at the end of one long interview, I started to see him differently when I noticed a melancholic undertone to his voice. He was talking about Seifahrt, who left the U. of C. in January for a job at the National Science Foundation in Tucson, Arizona. “I met him 17 years ago,” Bean said. “This is closing a chapter in my life with him leaving.”\n\nWhen I mention this to Seifahrt, he’s visibly touched. “I know a much more personable side to him,” he says. “He’s very straightforward about the things he’s passionate about.” I name them: It’s astrophysics and rock climbing. Then Seifahrt adds a third: “He’s also passionate about his kids.”\n\nBean was careful to avoid discussing his family in depth with me. But here’s what he would say: He’s divorced and has two children, ages 15 and 13. At the moment, he’s splitting his time between Hyde Park and near where his romantic partner, an astrophysicist at the University of Maryland, works. In our last conversation, Bean and I spoke over Zoom from his home there. After I turned the tape recorder off, I said that as a fellow father, I could relate to how hard being away from his children must be. He got choked up.\n\n“Everything I do is for them,” he said. “It’s complicated. What you’re seeing is a persona I’m presenting. My family is not something I like to bring up. I’m conscious there’s another part of me that I’m not showing.”\n\nUntil that point, Bean came across as an X-Files character whose sweatless rock climbing, robotic approach to science, and encyclopedic knowledge of astrophysics signaled, perhaps, an extraterrestrial being in my midst. But now I find all of it — his exactitude, indefatigable work ethic, constant questioning, and protection of his family; his precision, not accuracy — to be deeply human.\n\nThe universe is overwhelmingly vast and fear inducing, but isn’t it incredible how much more of it there is to explore? If Bean or any other astrophysicist can discover extraterrestrial life, it won’t be the end of observing the cosmos. In the search for truth, the important thing is to never stop looking.\n\nBean’s Big Breakthroughs\n\nHe led or worked on teams that made these significant exoplanet discoveries.\n\n1 Gliese 486b\n\nPlanet type: Super Earth\n\nMass: 2.8 Earths\n\nDistance from Earth: 26 light-years\n\nThe discovery: Its atmosphere contains water vapor, marking the first time scientists were able to identify an atmosphere of a rocky exoplanet.\n\nWhy it matters: It’s a huge step toward discovering a life-sustaining planet elsewhere in the galaxy, since a habitable world will likely be rocky and contain water.\n\n2 WASP-39b\n\nPlanet type: Gas giant\n\nMass: 0.3 Jupiters\n\nDistance from Earth: 700 light-years\n\nThe discovery: Its atmosphere contains carbon dioxide — the first time an exoplanet was definitively found to have that compound.\n\nWhy it matters: The finding showed the potential of the Webb telescope to decode the atmospheres not just of gas giants but of smaller, cooler planets, where it’s more likely we’ll find life.\n\n3 GJ 1214b\n\nPlanet type: Neptune-like\n\nMass: 8.4 Earths\n\nDistance from Earth: 48 light-years\n\nThe discovery: The planet’s murky, metal-rich atmosphere — too hazy to observe in detail before the Webb telescope — likely contains water vapor.\n\nWhy it matters: Astronomers had long been trying to decode the planet’s atmosphere, and the breakthrough showed the potential to do the same for other “sub-Neptunes” — the most common kind of exoplanet."
