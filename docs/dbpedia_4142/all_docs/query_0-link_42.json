        "text": "From various cosmological, astrophysical and terrestrial requirements, we derive conservative upper bounds on the present-day fraction of the mass of the Galactic dark matter (DM) halo in charged massive particles (CHAMPs). If dark matter particles are neutral but decay lately into CHAMPs, the lack of detection of heavy hydrogen in sea water and the vertical pressure equilibrium in the Galactic disc turn out to put the most stringent bounds. Adopting very conservative assumptions about the recoiling velocity of CHAMPs in the decay and on the decay energy deposited in baryonic gas, we find that the lifetime for decaying neutral DM must be > (0.9-3.4)x 10^3 Gyr. Even assuming the gyroradii of CHAMPs in the Galactic magnetic field are too small for halo CHAMPs to reach Earth, the present-day fraction of the mass of the Galactic halo in CHAMPs should be < (0.4-1.4)x 10^{-2}. We show that redistributing the DM through the coupling between CHAMPs and the ubiquitous magnetic fields cannot be a solution to the cuspy halo problem in dwarf galaxies.\n\nThe nature of the dark matter in the Halo of our Galaxy remains a mystery. Arguments are presented that the dark matter does not consist of ordinary stellar or substellar objects, i.e., the dark matter is not made of faint stars, brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, or neutron stars. In fact, faint stars and brown dwarfs constitute no more than a\n\nThis paper contributes an extensive analysis of Dark Matter (DM) along with associated materials regarding the interpretation of its evidence from &#39;cosmic microwave background radiation’, ‘gravitational lensing’, ‘galactic mergers and collisions’, ‘evolution and formation of galaxies’, ‘galactic clusters’, ‘Lambda-CDM models of the observable universe. Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs), Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP’s), Strongly Interacting Massive Particles (SIMPs), along with hot, warm, and cold DM, shedding an extensive overview of the γ_elastic of the cold DM after the chemical equilibrium is reached and kinetic decoupling happens earlier for γ_(in-elastic) accounting for 85% of the dominated matter in the universe. Scaler-Vector-Tensor (SVT) Gravity, MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MONDs), and Gravity of Entropy (GoE) have emerged as a supplement of the modified General Relativity (GR) as a source of non-baryonic DM scenarios in the universe. Obs...\n\nWe consider a self-gravitating ideal fermion gas at nonzero temperature as a model for the Galactic halo. The Galactic halo of mass ~ 2 x 10^12 Msol enclosed within a radius of ~ 200 kpc implies the existence of a supermassive compact dark object at the Galactic center that is in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium with the halo. The central object has a maximal mass of ~ 2.3 x 10^6 Msol within a minimal radius of ~ 18 mpc for fermin masses ~ 15 keV."
