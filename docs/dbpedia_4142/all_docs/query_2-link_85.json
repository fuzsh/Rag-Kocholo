        "text": "A proud husband, father, and grandfather, Joe spends his time reading, writing, fishing, playing the trumpet, letting the dogs outside, pleading with them to come back in, and praying his neighbor’s leaf blower breaks. He serves on the boards of the Salvation Army, Heartland Theatre Company, and in 2023 joined the Heartland Community College Foundation board. When not in Bloomington/Normal, Joe can most likely be found in Montana’s Madison River Valley flyfishing and enjoying cigars with an accompanying beverage.\n\nThis year is Joe’s tenth as master of ceremonies. He is humbled by the opportunity to support the outstanding work done by the Heartland Community College Foundation, and broaden his joke telling audience beyond his pets, long suffering family and friends, and the occasional delivery driver.\n\nJoe appreciates your support for both tonight’s comedians and Heartland Community College. Legendary comedian Milton Berle said, “Laughter is an instant vacation.” Enjoy tonight’s trip.\n\nDr. Ed Kolb\n\nDr. Ed is an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in the funny bone only secondary to the humerus. His jokes are only slightly less sloppy than his signature.\n\nPlease give your informed consent before entering FunnyRaiser — these jokes are not covered by your insurance policy."
