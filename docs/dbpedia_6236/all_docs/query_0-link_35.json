        "text": "Mark Wahlberg stars in this remake of James Caan‘s 1974 original about a compulsive gambler in over his head. He stars alongside Jessica Lange, Brie Larson and a very good John Goodman. It was indeed, as I say in my video review above, a bit of a gamble to remake the movie 40 years later, and this Christmas Day debut doesn’t quite pay off at the window.\n\nThe film is directed by Rupert Wyatt from a script by William Monahan based in James Toback‘s 1974 original. Producers are Wahlberg, Irwin Winkler, David Winkler, Robert Chartoff and Stephen Levinson. Chartoff and Irwin Winkler produced the original as well. Paramount is distributing the film.\n\nWill you go see the film? Let us know."
