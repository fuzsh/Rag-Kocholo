        "text": "In the\n\nwake of the mammoth commercial and critical success of his last film, the 2011\n\nfranchise reviver “Rise of the Planet of the Apes,” British filmmaker\n\nRupert Wyatt was in a position where he presumably could have signed on to any\n\nsure-fire tentpole epic guaranteed to become a cash cow. He chose to take a\n\ngamble with a smaller and riskier proposition with his latest effort, the dark\n\ndrama “The Gambler.” In this loose remake of the 1974 film directed\n\nby Karel Reisz from a powerful debut screenplay from perennial iconoclast James\n\nToback, Mark Wahlberg (in a role previously essayed by James Caan) stars as Jim\n\nBennett, a man who seems to have everything one could possibly ask for—wealth, privilege and a respected position as a literature—and yet is compelled by some self-destructive urge to\n\nliterally throw it all away via a\n\nfascination with high-stakes gambling that finds him betting (and often losing)\n\nthe equivalent of an average yearly salary on a single role of the roulette\n\nwheel. As a result of this habit, he is now permanently alienated from his rich\n\nmother (Jessica Lange), owes huge sums of money to a gangster (MIchael K.\n\nWilliams) who will not hesitate to kill him if he is not repaid tries to\n\nconvince another loan shark (John Goodman) to loan him even more money to keep\n\ngoing. His self-destructive urges even spill over into his personal life when\n\nhe begins a relationship with a student (Brie Larson) who knows of his secret\n\nlife and who just might be able to help him find himself at last–presume that\n\nhe hasn’t already destroyed himself before then.\n\nRecently,\n\nWyatt came to town to promote “The Gambler” (which opens December 25)\n\nand sat down to discuss the film, the aspects that separate this version from\n\nthe original and the challenges of getting an adult drama through the\n\ncontemporary studio apparatus.\n\nAfter having done a film like “Rise of the Planet of\n\nthe Apes,” which was a large-scale work with tons of visual effects, did\n\nyou deliberately set out to find something on a smaller and more personal scale\n\nlike “The Gambler” as your follow-up project?\n\nRUPERT\n\nWYATT: Yeah, of a sort. It is funny because making “Apes,” even\n\nthough it was technically a big studio movie, was actually a small movie in\n\nmany ways—very often, we were shooting a\n\nfather and son in this house or just Caesar for most of the first two acts. As\n\npart of the filmmaking process, I was keen to try something that would\n\nchallenge me as a filmmaker and do something that was less genre-driven, less\n\ncause-and-effect and more character driven. For better or worse, I felt as a\n\nfilmmaker that I needed to do that rather than to go right into another\n\ntentpole. Making a film like this allows you to focus on the character and the\n\nsituation and tell the story in that way.\n\nI had\n\nsort of left the “Apes” franchise with the idea of doing something of\n\nmy own like I had done with my first movie, which I co-wrote with Daniel Hardy.\n\nWe had ambitions to do something but it was taking a while to get going. This\n\nscript, I knew about and had heard about through my agent and Mark’s agent, who\n\nkept telling me that I had to read the script. Eventually I read it and fell in\n\nlove with the writing. The way that Bill Monahan writes is really unique for a\n\nstudio movie because he writes about situations and character and it was great\n\nfor me as a filmmaker to try and bring my genre sensibilities. I love taking high-concept genre filmmaking\n\nand trying to subvert it.\n\nHow familiar were you with the original version of\n\n“The Gambler” before signing on to do the remake?\n\nI was\n\nvery familiar with James Toback’s work and that of Karel Reisz, who I think is\n\na really underrated and under-appreciated filmmaker, but I never came to this\n\nproject with the notion of remaking the original. I read the script early on\n\nand realized that this was a film that was less about a man’s addiction, which\n\nis what I think the original one was about in coming from James Toback’s\n\npersonal experiences. I never wanted to emulate that because I didn’t feel\n\nequipped to do that—I am not an addictive\n\npersonality nor am I much of a gambler. When I read Bill’s script, I saw that\n\nit was not about addiction—this was the story of a man\n\nwho was using gambling as a means for getting out of his existence and to strip\n\naway the gilded cage in which he was brought up. Society had placed a set of\n\nrules upon him and he uses gambling to blow all that up and go back to zero. I\n\nthought that was an interesting notion and very different from the original.\n\nThat is the the key difference that I noticed while\n\ncomparing the two films. In the original, James Caan goes from one bet to the\n\nnext and hardly seems to notice whether he is winning or losing. Here, the Mark\n\nWahlberg character is far more consciously self-destructive and not just in\n\nregards to gambling–he goes out of his way to alienate the mother who appears\n\nto be his only familial contact and initiates a relationship with one of his\n\nstudents that could ruin his career if it was ever discovered. Was all of that\n\nin the script that you were initially presented with or did this aspect develop\n\nover time?\n\nThere\n\nwere a couple of scripts that had come my way that I was thinking about and had\n\nactually entertained and I saw an opportunity to do something interesting that\n\nwasn’t quite there in the scripts, as far as I was concerned. The trouble with\n\na lot of studio movies is that when they are green-lit, no one wants to change\n\nthem because then the green light can change to a red light. As a filmmaker, I\n\nkind of promised myself that if I did someone else’s script, I really needed to\n\nsee it as I wanted to make it. When I read Bill’s work on “The\n\nGambler,” it was like buying a house—I could see all the rooms. I\n\ndidn’t set out to change anything.\n\nYou know\n\n“Le Samourai,” the Jean-Pierre Melville film? To me, I always related\n\nit to that—the idea of a samurai choosing\n\nthe place of his death. With Mark’s character, the opening scene is of him\n\nseeing his grandfather on his deathbed and being asked “I need to know\n\nwhat you would be worth if I leave you nothing.” In a way, that challenge,\n\nthat quest, is what sets Mark off on his path of self-destruction and that is a\n\ntough sell for an audience. We are all conditioned, especially in moviemaking,\n\nto get behind a character and root for him in the “Rocky” sense of\n\nbeing an underdog but this is the story of an “overdog” who wants to become an underdog. That is not necessarily\n\nthe easiest guy to empathize with or support and it goes a long way to have\n\nsomeone like Mark Wahlberg as the character because he is really such an\n\nempathetic actor, which is what makes him a movie star, I guess. That was very\n\nmuch a predestined journey that he chose to take rather than just being an\n\naddict circling the drain who can’t help himself and who destroys the people\n\naround him.\n\nHow difficult was it to try to get a project like this\n\nthrough the contemporary big studio filmmaking process that tends to frown on\n\nthe very things that the film seems to be embracing?\n\nIt is all\n\nabout marketability and bankability. The honest answer to that is Mark Wahlberg—he is the guy who has a great deal of value. From my\n\nperspective as a filmmaker, his value to me is his power and ability to play\n\nhis character and that is why I signed on. In terms of getting a green light\n\nfor this movie, he is a movie star and the budget for this movie combined with\n\nhis value as a star made it a worthwhile investment. You only have to look at\n\npeople like George Clooney or Brad Pitt, who are intelligent actors who use\n\ntheir value well in the sense that they will do mainstream movies in order to\n\nbuild up their value and then take it and put it into interesting projects that\n\nare not necessarily easy sells. Mark did exactly that—he fell in love with the script, which is not what one\n\nwould consider to be a four-quadrant movie with a story for multiple\n\ndemographics, and decided to get behind it.\n\nSo Wahlberg was already involved with the project before\n\nyou signed on?\n\nYes. He\n\nactually approached me. I had always wanted to work with him and that is\n\nultimately what got me to read the script. Like I said, I was focused on my own\n\nthing and in order to get anything done, you have to stay true to your thing\n\nand as a result, I was pissing other things away. Then I heard that he was\n\ninsisting that I read the script and I finally took a look at it. He was the\n\ninstigator of all of this.\n\nAnother key difference between the two versions is the\n\ncharacter played by Brie Larson. In the original, there was a girlfriend character\n\nplayed by Lauren Hutton but she was just kind of there. The Larson character,\n\non the other hand, plays a more direct part in the proceedings in the sense\n\nthat she represents perhaps the one hopeful aspect of Wahlberg’s life and at\n\nthe same time, by being a student of his, she also has the potential to destroy\n\nhis life at the same time.\n\nThat is\n\none of the few characters from the movie that might have fallen through the\n\ncracks. I think in the original, and this is just my perception of it, she is\n\njust kind of this superficial arm candy. In our version, Amy is a very\n\ndifferent character—she is the cornerstone for his\n\nredemption and is also blessed with this extraordinary talent that he alone\n\nrecognizes, hence the scene when he calls her out in class. They are kindred\n\nspirits, you could say, so it is less of a Lolita relationship, even though she\n\nis half his age, and more a case of someone who sees the world in the same way\n\nthat he does. If I had the time to do it again, I would have probably spent more\n\ntime focusing on making her character more understandable in that context but\n\nwhen you have an actor like Brie Larson, it is amazing because she can take\n\nwhat is pretty much a two-dimensional role and really make it into something.\n\nTwo of the most striking performances in the film are the\n\nones by Jessica Lange and John Goodman as, respectively, Wahlberg’s embittered\n\nmother and a loan shark—they are only on\n\nthe screen for a few minutes each but their appearances are so vivid that it\n\nfeels as if their parts are larger than they actually are.\n\nWell, the\n\nthing that I learned is that when you are dealing with an ensemble or with any\n\nsupporting roles is that the better actor that you get, the more often you have\n\nto flesh out the character in order to take advantage of their intelligence and\n\nabilities as an actor so that they can take a small role and make it into\n\nsomething much bigger just because of their very presence. With Jessica and\n\nJohn and Michael Williams, they became the front-and-center characters in their\n\nparticular scenes. The way Bill wrote it, they always had the floor while Mark\n\nwas more passive and receptive in the situations that he found himself in with\n\nthem. It is an amazing opportunity as a filmmaker to work with actors like that\n\nand the actors are drawn to it because of the writing.\n\nWhat has the reaction been from the audiences at the\n\nscreening that you have been attending? As you alluded to earlier, the film is\n\nabout a character who is not the most easily empathetic person imaginable and I\n\ncan imagine that some might find it hard to accept someone that\n\nself-destructive, especially when he is casually throwing away an average\n\nperson’s yearly salary on one roulette spin.\n\nI don’t\n\nknow. I am the worst person to ask this question. I think you are right—when you are watching a character doing things that, at\n\nleast in the western sense, are really stupid and selfish and senseless by\n\ntaking something that could really change a person’s life and just tossing it\n\naway so thoughtlessly, I can understand that people might turn away from him. I\n\nthink that what we tried to do is make sense of why this character was doing\n\nthat by showing that none of it meant anything to him–that it actually meant\n\nsomething negative to him and that all of the wealth and privilege felt\n\ninherently corrupt. I think that is something that is not necessarily a bad\n\nthing–at the end of the day, this is only a movie and not a documentary–but I\n\nthink that it is a representation of something that we should all look at in\n\nour lives at some time. Going for the more superficial aspects of our lives\n\ndoes not always bring happiness–that was my intention to show and that is why\n\nat the end of the film, he stands in front of a sign that says “Vacant\n\nLot.” He is a clean slate at the end, and, for me, that is quite\n\naspirational.\n\nAs we are talking towards the end of 2014, I was wondering\n\nif you had any particular favorite films from the past year you would care to\n\nmention.\n\nI saw\n\n“Force Majeure” recently, which I loved—I\n\nthought that was an incredible film. It is funny because I think, more often\n\nthan not, that the filmmaking is so diverse and that is what was so wonderful\n\nabout it—it was the pauses and the\n\nspaces in-between in that film that gave it such resonance. It really took its\n\ntime and it was really an amazing film. The sound design in that film was\n\ngreat."
