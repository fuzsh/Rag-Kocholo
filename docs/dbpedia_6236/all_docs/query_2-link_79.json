        "text": "By the end, it's difficult to care about Jim as Wahlberg represents him.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Jul 13, 2022\n\nWants to be a philosophical look at life's big issues, using Bennett's fall from grace as a backdrop, but in the end delivers Hollywood cynicism.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Feb 2, 2021\n\nUltimately, it's an examination of addiction and the largely alienating effects this particular one imparts - the kind infrequently touched upon by mainstream cinema.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 7/10 | Dec 4, 2020\n\nNo matter how finely feathered the hair or slim and trim the figure, Wahlberg is simply one of the glossy mistakes Wyatt's film trips over.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/5 | Sep 19, 2019\n\nwill leave you out of pocket and feeling cheated for watching\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Jun 5, 2019\n\nThanks to the presence of Goodman, Larson and Lange we're presented with a stacked deck, so how come it feels like we spend two hours holding the bridge rules card?\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | May 17, 2019\n\nThe dreamlike imagery, editing, and soundtrack invoke the haze of addiction, but the writing never follows through with the message, leaving us unstirred, with little to take home and think about.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 6/10 | Mar 20, 2019\n\nTHE GAMBLER doesn't amount too much, except a story of a walking existential crisis looking for his pacifier, which is conveniently located at a blackjack table.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: C- | Dec 8, 2018\n\nYou're just going to spend the two hours annoyed by all of the stupid decisions Bennett makes.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Dec 2, 2017\n\nDirected by Rupert Wyatt (Rise of the Planet of the Apes), the film is glossy and shiny, giving it a superficial sheen that doesn't make any sense.\n\nFull Review | Oct 17, 2017\n\nSome casting decisions should never happen-Shaq as Tinkerbell-hmm... actually that might be fantastic, scratch that. But Mark Wahlberg as a professor of literature? Just no.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Jun 11, 2016\n\n'The Gambler' is just shy of a great movie - it doesn't quite add up like it should - but it is a reminder that there's a very fine actor lurking in Mark Wahlberg.\n\nFull Review | Jun 7, 2016\n\nThis remake not only fails to justify its own existence, it very nearly calls into question the necessity of the material in any form.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/5 | Apr 12, 2016"
