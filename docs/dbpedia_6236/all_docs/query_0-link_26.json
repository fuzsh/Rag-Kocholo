The failure of the remake lies in its near-complete failure to dive into a gambler’s psychology. In the Toback/Reisz film, it is clear that the reason James Caan (despite being from an incredibly wealthy family, having a beautiful blonde girlfriend, and a reasonably good job) is willing to risk losing everything — money, girlfriend, even his life — is precisely because he is in love with the sensation of risk that comes with the gamble. For that reason, it’s telling that, in one of his university lectures, Caan speaks about how William Carlos Williams reaches the conclusion that George Washington is not really the ideal American because what Washington fears most is risk. Or, perhaps, he is the ideal in that what we want is to lead lives that reduce risk to a zero, where everything is planned and we feel in control of our own fate. For Caan’s gambler, however, this is the ugly antithesis of what it means to be alive; he finds intoxication in the moments before the card flips over or the ball comes to rest on the roulette wheel — the moment before all is revealed, when fate could still swing either way.\n\nno one associated with this film knows a lick about gamblers or addiction"
