        "text": "“You see that room in there?” my father asked. “That’s where the schmucks go.” We were in Atlantic City, walking from the buffet to a show, and he was pointing at a casino.\n\nAnyone with half a brain knows that gambling is for suckers. Yet the vibe of a casino (especially an illegal one in a gated mansion or in labyrinthine Koreatown basement) certainly has its allure. An unexpected shade of Rupert Wyatt’s The Gambler – and it’s felt even more here than in Karel Reisz’s 1974 version starring James Caan – is that Mark Wahlberg’s Jim Bennett has precious little lust for the typical high-rollers’ lifestyle. Any thrills felt when the cards turn in Bennett’s favour, as they do on occasion, is on you. This is not about the rush of addiction. Jim Bennett is a man on a mission: he has to get down to nothing, so that maybe he can build himself back up. That is, if he’s still alive.\n\nDespite the film’s title, Bennett frequently reminds us that he isn’t a gambler. Maybe he’s suicidal, or maybe he’s just a whiny rich brat. But he hates himself, coming as he does from wealth, privilege and education. By day he’s a college literature professor, browbeating his students with nihilism. Screenwriter William Monahan gifts Wahlberg with cement blocks of text about the pains of mediocrity. There are three in his class who know of his life outside of the lecture hall. One is an ace tennis player Dexter (Emory Cohen) who tutors Bennett’s millionaire mother (Jessica Lange). Another is working-class Amy (Brie Larson), a waitress at an underground gambling parlour, who Bennett claims is the only one in the whole school including himself who can write worth a damn. Finally, there is a Lamar (Anthony Kelley), the star basketball player whose seeming lack of interest in literature leads to a friendship that may offer Bennett his only chance at survival.\n\nMirroring this triumvirate are three different men who smell blood in Bennett’s desperation. He owes more than $200,000 to the gambling ring owned by Mr Lee (Alvin Ing), a medium-sized grifter (Michael Kenneth Williams) and a beast of a loanshark played by John Goodman. We first meet Goodman’s Frank in a Grecian bathhouse, blubber spilling out from beneath his robes as he barks a cruel economic philosophy that, when you set aside all the profanity, actually makes a great deal of sense. He’s the most frightening character in a film full of gangsters, but he’s the only one offering advice. Despite his bluster, he seems to care a little bit about Bennett, the grandson of an industrialist from an age of unrivalled American exceptionalism. Goodman’s extended cameo can sit alongside Ned Beatty’s in Network, and his scenes are some of the most exhilarating you’ll see in a movie this year.\n\nThe film is framed with a ticking clock, but does Bennett even want to get out of his hole and pay these men back? Somewhere in the chunky monologues and all-over-the-map music cues there’s the understanding that what Bennett really wants is to call their collective bluffs. They come to realise that threatening him or his family won’t get any traction, but they may get some movement threatening his new friends, particularly Amy. Sure, it’s a little obvious to present the love of a good (and young and brilliant) woman as the reason to give up a death wish, but pretty much everything in The Gambler is meant to be seen as big and metaphorical; there’s an entire sequence devoted to discussing Albert Camus’s The Stranger."
