In each “breakdown” we’ll take a look at what a film’s marketing led us to believe, how the movie actually played, and then what we learned from it all. Read on!\n\nThe Impression:\n\nMark Wahlberg is The Gambler. The trailers have made the movie look like a gnarlier version of Rounders. I approve.\n\nThe Reality:\n\nI’m not at all sure why Rupert Wyatt’s latest film is titled The Gambler, as it doesn’t contain any actual gambling. Sure, Mark Wahlberg stares a dealer or four in the eye and makes some bets, but these moments happen so quickly that his character doesn’t even bother with sitting down. No, the movie should have been called The Rambler since that’s just about the only thing Wahlberg or anyone else does. Personally, I love a good ramble, but I couldn’t make heads or tails of anything that was thrown my way. I think Wahlberg is sad and/or angry because he is or isn’t a gambler? Also, one of the “bad guys” is tired, so he would like to start an avocado farm? And what about the basketball player that keeps saying he has a knee? I don’t know. I went for high stakes gambling and all I got was a bunch of people incoherently talking about their lives and how they may or may not matter. Don’t see The Gambler unless you have “fuck you” money and time.\n\nThe Lesson:\n\nInsert witty pun about gambling."
