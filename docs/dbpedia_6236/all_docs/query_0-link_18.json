        "text": "The Gambler is the most well-made bad movie I have seen thus far. What exactly does that mean though? In this statement, there are two main aspects, both of which must be looked at individually. In doing so, hopefully you will have a better understanding of what I mean exactly. It’s needless to say, but this analysis does contain spoilers.\n\nWe’ll begin by asking what causes a movie to be well-made? It should be noted a well-made film does not necessarily mean the movie itself will be good. (Obviously, that’s kind of why I have to explain it.) There are many components which go into making a film, and when they are done well, typically the movie ends up being good. However, it is when one or more them fall short, that line to goodness fails to be crossed.\n\nWhat exactly are these components? In no particular order they are- the directing, the acting, the cinematography, the music, the plot, the writing, the editing, and usually the choice of actor as well. If you want to know why we don’t have many masterpieces in film, it’s because it is extremely difficult to get every single one of those elements correct.\n\nOf course no movie will ever get everything exactly perfect, but a few have gotten very close. One example is the 2008 film, The Dark Knight, by Christopher Nolan. It is easily regarded as the best super hero movie to have come out, and it is one of the best movies of the last few decades.\n\nTake a look at this scene from the movie. Right after Harvey Dent falsely confesses to being the Batman, he is arrested and is being escorted away. During this, in an attempt to bring out the real Batman, the Joker attacks! The real Batman then comes to the scene to protect Gotham’s white night.\n\nFirst off, this scene alone had more plot than the entirety of The Gambler. Second off, it order to understand why this scene works well (and in turn the entire movie) we have to break it down.\n\nFirst, the dialogue. Not much at all is said through these four minutes. There’s the officer at the beginning talking to the trucker, the other officer making the realization of the obstruction, Harvey making sure he’s safe and his escort reassuring him, the driver’s partner says a few cheesy lines and then the Joker mutters off a few lines as well. Even then, the dialogue says a lot about the characters. If you’ve never seen the film before, the Joker’s line, “Scuse me, I wanna drive.” Is enough to show you what type of person he is. Not many movies can say that about their own characters. It also serves to show how dialogue, especially in movies, is not needed to drive the plot forward.\n\nWith minimal dialogue, the acting is still really good. When the garbage truck shows up, you can see the scared reaction of the cop and it feels genuine. No one is supposed to be down there with them, yet here’s a truck ramming into his back and soon taking him off the road. Again Heath Ledger has small mannerisms including a curious ‘hmm’ when the real Batman appears, and even the workers at the end look worried and confused when the Batmobile (aka the Tumbler) comes crashing over the wall. (Though I find it interesting how only the noise of the Batmobile crashing caught their attention, and not any of the other commotion which was going on.) Every person in this scene made it feel like it was really happening.\n\nIt goes even further because the editing is also very well done. No matter what, you can always tell exactly what is going on in this scene. You may not know the meaning of what is happening, but there is no shaky-cam, or quick cut editing. Everything is presented in a way that is easy to see.\n\nWhen the Joker is shooting at the armored van, we see him take the shots, the reaction of the drivers, and then the perspective from inside the armored van where the bullets are hitting. When he switched weapons the same exact sequence takes place, with an added shot of the garbage truck ramming the armored van forward.\n\nBut something else can also be seen here. The Joker’s power. He’s not the one driving the vehicle, someone else is. He’s not the one loading the guns, someone else is. He shoots, and when the bullets are gone, someone else is handing him a gun ready to go. There are at least four or five other henchmen with him, and though never said, they’re all doing exactly what he says and needs.\n\nThen comes the cinematography. The scene starts with a low nighttime shot of the convoy coming towards the screen, and it pulls back following the lead car as if we were barely in front of it. We get a few quick shots of Harvey and his escort exchanging concerned glances before cutting to an overhead view showing the entire convoy, including the police helicopter overhead. We see the cars turn and cut to another low angle shot of the semi truck.\n\nThrough a few quick cuts we then see the driver from the perspective of the officer, and the officer from the perspective of the driver, then bam! Surprise! It’s the Joker! We don’t see the officer die, even though we know he did. We then cut back to overhead view of the convoy as it slowly moves forward. This pan reveals the burning fire truck (irony, but also message sending) at the top of the screen.\n\nTell me that’s not a beautiful shot. All that takes place in the first thirty seconds of the scene, and it sets the mood perfectly. If I were to analyze the entire scene, we’d be here for a quite a while. Basically, everything is shown in a really cool way. The small details like showing the driver from below signifying the officer’s point of view, those are simple tricks which really add to the movie. It subtly shows the Joker in power as he’s the higher figure. Most of his shots are from above while the shots showing the other characters are all at even level.\n\nFinally, so we’re not here all day, the music. Watch this scene again and try to focus on the music. You’ll notice it slowly builds when the convoy makes the first turn, increases when the Joker is revealed, and then cuts completely once the garbage truck enters the scene. As soon as the Joker’s attack begins, there is no music and the scene is allowed to speak for itself. I’m willing to bet you didn’t notice that the first time around. A lot of movies make the mistake of thinking music adds to a scene, when sometimes it would have been better off without it. Fortunately this film uses music near perfectly throughout. So when I say music is important, I don’t just mean the music itself, I also mean the choices made of when to play it and when not to play it.\n\nAll these elements combined made for an amazing 8 minutes sequence (As the linked video is only half of the entire scene) in the Dark Knight, and it continues throughout the entire film. You forget you’re watching a movie and feel like you’re watching actually events take place. That’s why the Dark Knight is a well-made good film, because the pieces come together and they work. The immersion this film brings is the key to any movie. Small mistakes can really take you out of the film, so when that doesn’t happen, you tend to have a good movie on your hands.\n\nWhat about a movie that’s not well-made? What about a truly bad film? When I say a film is bad, I am not talking about a movie I didn’t enjoy. For instance you may have not liked The Dark Knight, but that doesn’t stop it from being a masterpiece of our time. I am talking about a film which I think is truly a bad movie, one that has no redeeming factors outside of laughing at it. In this case, M. Night Shamalamadingdong’s The Last Airbender.\n\nFortunately I don’t need to go into a whole analysis as to why this film is bad. If you really want to see a full analysis, there are several available on YouTube. To show you why this film is bad, I only need to share this twenty second scene. For a better understanding of what’s going on, you must know in this film’s universe, people can control the four elements. Each element has a nation of its own and the Fire Nation has started a war with the rest of the world. Here, we see Earth Kingdom prisoners fighting back against the firebenders.\n\nOk, really quick. These are Earth Kingdom prisoners. These are people who can control the earth and the rock in the world. You know, that stuff which is COMPLETELY surrounding them in the prison. It’s literally all around them. Moving on…\n\nIn order to control (bend) an element, there are martial art styled moves required to make it happen. This is because the bending techniques are taken from real world martial arts styles. So those two men at the beginning of the scene aren’t just flailing around, they’re actually trying to firebend. The scene then cuts over to 5 men seemingly practicing a haka only to see a tiny pebble float across the screen.\n\nWhy does this scene not work? First off, the choreography is absolutely terrible. It doesn’t look like these men are controlling the elements, it just looks like they’re dancing, and badly at that. After seeing the five men finish their dance routine, we see that small rock come across the screen. Problem is, they aren’t the ones moving that small rock. In fact we don’t actually get to see what they moved. Supposedly they made the wall that stopped the fire from hitting their friends at the beginning, but even that doesn’t make sense from what we see. (Why would their routine need to continue after the wall has been made?)\n\nThe acting in the film is actually worse than the dance routines. Here’s a short example of what I mean, and yes, this scene was actually released in the movie. By the way, no, this film is not meant to be a comedy. There are certainly much longer videos showing the extent of the acting, but I’d rather not waste your time. It’s pretty clear these kids can’t act, and it’s well known they weren’t chosen for their acting. When you combine that with a poor director and weak plot, you have a film ready for disaster. (And what a disaster it was.)\n\nHopefully you now have a better understanding of what causes a movie to be well-made, and how when those same aspects fail, the movie can end up being terrible. So how does all that apply to The Gambler? Let’s start by taking a look at what this film promised to be in its trailer. Of course like any movie, there was more than one trailer, but for this instance I am using the only one I personally saw.\n\nThe trailer begins with our main character Jim and his mother, played by Mark Wahlberg and Jessica Lange respectively, as they are at a bank asking to withdraw $260,000 in cash. The tone is immediately set when the cashier asks if everything is alright and the mother responds with, “When someone needs that amount of money in cash, nothing’s ok.”\n\nThe trailer then cuts to the shot of a casino as we see Mark Wahlberg win again and again at blackjack, but his luck run outs when he switches to roulette and loses everything. Over this we hear a narration from John Goodman saying how he’s seen Mark be up half a million dollars. He’s then corrected as Mark say’s he been up two and half million dollars. The music kicks in and we see a couple quick shots, including one not shown in the movie at all.\n\nAnd then this is where the trailer really lies to us. We see Mark in his classroom which is followed with a quick cut over to Brie Larson’s character, Amy. Mark says the line, “If you take away nothing else from class, desiring a thing cannot make you have it.” Get it? Because it’s interlaced with pictures of Brie Larson indicating that he wants her, but can’t have her. Funny thing, that’s not how the line goes and the real line is fairly significant to the film. Obviously a trailer should never give everything away, however by cutting the trailer in this way, it made me believe the film would have a much heavier romantic evidence than it did.\n\nA few more quick shots and more narration setting up Mark’s predicament, a false subplot is set up and then the music cuts out as John Goodman says a line made for the trailer. They make it seem like Mark gets in a lot of trouble and to continue to make it seem like he and Brie Larson will have a romantic relationship, and then it hits us with the line, “When you get a second chance…” This is followed with Mark saying a line he will repeat many times throughout the film, “What if I told you I’m not a gambler?”\n\nThe end of the sentence comes up, “…A risk is worth taking.” Because get it? Gambling is a high risk game. The trailer then ends by showing Mark return one last time to gamble and hopefully solve all his problems.\n\nThis is the type of movie where you can already guess how it will end. The suspense and entertainment comes in getting to that point. You already know he’s going to be ok and get the girl at the same time, but it’s a matter of seeing how it all goes down.\n\nThe problem with this trailer is it sets up a completely different movie. Line’s like “Whatever did happen to dad?” are completely useless as the father does not exist, and outside of that single line, nothing involving him ever happens. It’s a silly question Mark says in an insulting way to his mother and nothing more.\n\nFurthermore, the romantic plot line is almost non-existent, an entire subplot is left out of the trailer (which isn’t necessarily a bad thing and it sets up important plot points), and it fails completely to show how arrogant and uncaring Mark really is.\n\n-Quick side note, I will be calling the actors by their names and NOT by their character names. The reason for this is simply because the character names aren’t really used in the film. Jim is said one time, and Amy only during one scene, but even then she’s referred to by her last name. In fact, the only character whose name we really know is the one Anthony Keller plays, Lamar. Even one of the most important characters in the film is simply known as ‘The Korean.’ (Though his name is used a few times early on) For that reason I will continue to call the actors by their real names-\n\nSince the trailer does not adequately portray what happens in this film, what does actually take place in The Gambler? The movie begins with thirty-six seconds of logos, including Paramount and some company called ‘Closest to the hole/Leverage entertainment’. Not sure who this group was, I decided to try and figure that out in order to see what else they have worked on. However, there were only two relevant pages of information available. The first being the IMDb page showing the company is heavily affiliated with Mark Wahlberg, and the second showing Mark Wahlberg is actually in charge of the company. In fact they’ve only ever been involved with two other films, both which also starred Marky Mark.\n\nWhat’s interesting though is this company doesn’t seem to actually exist. While I was trying to see what else they had worked on, I came across the show Boardwalk Empire. On their Wikipedia page it shows Closest to the Hole as a production company, yet when you click on the link to Closest in the Hole, it only sends you to Mark Wahlberg’s page. Wahlberg’s page has no information about Closest to the Hole. In other words, Mark Wahlberg is the company. I guess this really shouldn’t be surprising though. Just look at the cover to the bluray. Mark Wahlberg’s name is barely smaller than the movie title, it is the first thing you see, and it’s put in such a place it makes it seem like it is part of the movie title. ‘Mark Wahlberg: The Gambler.’ In a sense it’s true.\n\nNow that we know who funded the film, what about those who got it to that point? Who wrote this thing? Credit for the screenplay is given to William Monahan, most well known for writing the screenplays to movies like The Departed, Kingdom of Heaven, and Body of Lies. Even though The Departed has received positive reviews, the other two are sitting comfortably at about 6.5/10 each. The Gambler, when averaging the scores, does a little bit worse sitting at 5.8/10. He’s never really worked on anything too significant or any movie with a rating of 8 or higher.\n\n(Super quick, films rating 6-7/10 are usually considered average/good, while films 8 or higher are considered great)\n\nSo we have someone who writes screenplays, but isn’t necessarily the best at doing so. (And oh boy does that explain a lot!) However, he’s not the only accredited writer. Alongside him we have James Toback who to my surprise, wrote the original version of The Gambler. Yup, that means the 2014 movie starring Mark Wahlberg, is actually a remake of a 1974 movie by the same name starring James Caan. Who can? James Caan!\n\nFrom what I can tell there aren’t too many differences in the two films. The two movies follow the same basic plot, down to the subplot left out of the trailer and the biggest difference comes from there being no love story in the original. The names are different and the amount owed is too. (Even with inflation the $44,000 dollars in Caan’s version would only be $216,000 today.) For the most part, it’s basically the same film.\n\nKnowing this film is a remake only makes Monahan’s work worse. The original is not a bad movie. In fact, it actually has a higher rating than the remake. Even though that’s common amongst most remakes, it’s safe to say not many people have heard of the original in this case. All Monahan needed to do was take the original screenplay and modernize it and in many ways he did. Thanks to him instead of Axel and Hips, we now have Jim and Amy. However his modernization doesn’t go much further.\n\nYou know what the biggest difference in the two films is? The plot in the original is simple. In the original, Axel Freed is an English professor and an author, who also happens to have a gambling addiction. At school he inspires his students and outside the classroom he has the admiration of his family, including his mother. When she finds out he owes $44,000, she gives it to him. Axel then goes to Vegas and gambles it, making a small fortune, however, he loses it all.\n\nAxel’s only way to lose the debt is to convince one of students, who happens to be a basketball star, into accepting a bribe into not winning the game by more than a certain number of points. (Meaning he would have to win the game by 7 or less points. Or he could just lose the game.) The plan carries out, Axel leaves and gets into a fight with a pimp and the film ends as he studies himself in a mirror and smiles enigmatically at the blood coming from the wound.\n\nIn the remake, most of that is still there. Jim is still an English professor and a writer who likes to gamble. At one point in the film he does receive money from his mom – as shown in the trailer – and he does lose it all as well. The basketball game bet also plays a crucial role and that’s the end of the similarities.\n\nJim is not inspirational in the classroom. I don’t think the filmmakers were trying to make him be as the way he speaks to his students is more harsh than it is anything else. This film starts with him already owing money, having the money, and then losing it. He then takes out a loan from a loan shark, and in order to settle that debt, the basketball bet takes place. But since he still owes money to the first, he has to take out a third loan from yet another person. Because remember, the money his mom gave him was all lost. I this version it is clear the mom does not admire him, nor does it seem anyone does. Anyways. After taking out this other loan he goes to the casino, and bets it all on roulette. (Seriously Monahan, all you had to do was modernize it!)\n\nThis film is much more complicated and unnecessarily so. I did not even include any of the other interactions with the mother, nor the romantic relationship attempting to take place throughout. There’s a not-so-subtle, subtle idea shown and with everything jumbled together, it’s hard to understand at points. So let’s finally see why!\n\nAs the logos play, we hear the sound of a roulette wheel spinning, shortly followed by a quiet, yet audible, ticking noise. The shot fades into Mark Wahlberg sitting alone on a chair and crying. A single tear drops down his face and we soon find out it’s because he’s in the hospital, and someone close to him is dying. Here, ten seconds in, we actually see a little bit of cleverness.\n\n‘See’ isn’t quite the right word in this case. ‘Hear’ would be the better choice. I’ll admit, when I saw the film for the first time, I did not catch this. It was partly due to not caring for the opening logos, and partly because of how the scene plays out. With the movie called The Gambler and the sound of dice being rolled, I didn’t put much thought into the ticking sound, even as the scene transitioned to show the old man on his death bed. After watching it again, I realized the sound was the ticking of a clock.\n\nWe don’t ever actually see a clock in this entire scene. It’s only Mark and (As we later learn) his grandfather. That slight ticking sound in the background just serves as a way to add tension. It reminds you of time as you watch someone who has just run out of it.\n\nThe grandfather acknowledges he is going to die and asks what Mark thinks about it. Mark replies with ‘I’m going to miss you.’ I honestly cannot tell if this is meant to be a genuine response or not. The way the line is delivered makes it seem like he’s saying it to say it. However, just moments ago he was crying and choking up, showing he really does care.\n\nThe grandfather doesn’t like the response. He says he won’t know about Mark missing him, which is a good point, and instead wants to know what Mark is worth when left nothing. Mark yet again gives a response in a way which makes it seem like he just wants to get it all over with. Yes his grandfather is dying, but he’s not showing sadness in these scenes. He just doesn’t seem to care. We later learn his character is like this in general, but I still find it odd he would continue such a persona when the person closest to him is dying.\n\nIt could easily just be bad acting. Mark Wahlberg certainly has had his moments. (Of course the whole movie is terrible) I just don’t think that is the case. Wahlberg’s acting in the rest of the film is pretty decent so I truly believe he just kept the same persona for this scene. It just doesn’t work. He didn’t forge the tears, he’s not pretending to cry, yet the way he is speaking makes it seem like he doesn’t really care.\n\nThe grandfather tells Mark ‘You are me know, if you’ll have it” Which Mark nods and seemingly accepts to. The music swells to a sad song as the grandfather has now passed and we see many people at his funeral. The opening credits play, more so, the opening credit plays as only Mark Wahlberg’s name is shown. At the funeral Mark and his mother exchange a quick glance before he simply walks out. This is only seems to reassure my belief that he really didn’t care. His face his blank at the funeral, he seems bored. As soon as his mother sees him, he just walks out.\n\nAnd then what happens? The music changes to an upbeat song, and THE GAMBLER flashes on the screen. I guess we weren’t supposed to care about the grandfather after all. We follow a car driving down the road at night as the rest of the opening credits begin to play. It’s actually a bit unclear when exactly this takes place. I’m going to assume it happens right after the funeral though.\n\nIs it me or does Mark Wahlberg really seem…full of himself?\n\nThis film was produced by him, and written by those who have worked with him before, and of course he’s the star. Since he’s the star, it makes sense for him to get first billing. However, I have never seen it where the star’s credit is separated from the rest. I’ve never seen opening credits be separated at all. Yet Mark Wahlberg wanted to have himself be all alone, to make it stand out. When you see it, you read it, and though you’re expecting more, they don’t come. So you remember it. No one ever remembers the opening credits. No one ever pays attention to them because there isn’t really a point to. Knowing this, Wahlberg put himself alone to stand out.\n\nAs Mark is driving he continuously looks down at his phone which is shown to be broadcasting a basketball game. The effects here aren’t that good. It’s quite obvious the video was added in later, and it shows. For one, the quality is way too high. He’s obviously not using wifi, yet the picture is perfect and with no delay whatsoever. Also, there’s no ambient light from the phone. Again, this scene takes place at night. We see the light from the streetlamps passing by, but there’s no ambient light from the phone. It’s as if a wall was placed around it.\n\nTo further show what kind of character Mark is playing, he doesn’t use his turn signal, he’s speeding, and he’s weaving in and out of traffic. Am I supposed to like this guy? He’s our main character, the guy we’re going to follow throughout the entire film. Yet, in the first two minutes we have him seemingly not caring about his grandfather’s death, and then being an idiot on the road.\n\nFor a few more seconds we continue to follow him as he drives somewhere. He pulls up somewhere and parks the car, and suddenly the music stops. We cut inside the car to see Mark has an absolutely uncaring look on his face. It might be a look of dread, but it really seems like he could not be bothered by anything right now.\n\nI always find it interesting when the music in a film is the music the characters are hearing. A film which does this beautifully is my all-time favorite film, Another Earth. Several times throughout the film, we as the audience will be hearing music that the characters are listening to on the radio or through some other means of doing so. I believe this scene perfectly captures the entire movie, and it does so in a single minute. Even the narration in the scene is from a radio broadcast taking place. Incredibly well made film I’ll analyze another time.\n\nThe Gambler also does this a few times, like in the scene I just talked about. For this scene, I don’t think it works though. I understand what they were trying to do, but at least to me, it failed. To go from the sad music at the funeral, to Mark carelessly driving while listening to an upbeat song is such a change, it caught me off guard. Obviously they are attempting to capture Mark’s character, but as I already do not like him, this really doesn’t help.\n\nThe film continues as we see Mark carrying a briefcase into a building. He’s scanned for weapons, and as he exchanges money for chips, we realize he’s at a casino. He walks in, and what’s this? Brie Larson works here? She gives him a surprised look, clearly not expecting to have seen him there, but he says nothing and moves on. Of course we know from the trailer the two already know each other, but this is meant to just give a hint as to who she is. We don’t know Brie’s character yet or what involvement she has in the plot. All we know is this woman somehow knows Mark, and happens to work at the place he went gambling.\n\nThe music slowly starts to build, giving a good amount of tension as Mark goes further and further into the casino. He walks up to a blackjack table and puts down $10,000. The music quiets a bit, still trying to keep the tension. Mark wins the first hand. He doubles his bet. The music builds again. Mark wings again. He gives a quick look to the camera as he puts down $40,000. Brie Larson watches on. The music continues to grow. He’s at 15, and stays. He wins again. The music is now speeding up.\n\nMark demands to go again at $40,000, but the dealer is hesitant, causing Mark to repeat himself a bit more forcefully. He has 14, he hits, and he goes over. He throws down the $40,000 from the last hand and demands it be doubled. $80,000. The dealer again looks hesitant, and glances over to his side. Mark tries to stay in control, claiming the dealer must be new as he knows ‘Mr. Lee’ covers a lot more than that. The dealer glances over to a watcher who approves doubling the money.\n\n$80,000. We see Mark is being watched and the game begins again. He’s at 9, and hits. An Ace comes out, and the dealer gets blackjack. Mark loses everything. The music stops, and the tension is gone. We see him drink alone at a bar, and here we are introduced to a new character, Neville, played by Michael Kenneth Williams.\n\nHe tells Mark he hopes he paid his rent, and Mark replies saying he doesn’t pay rent. Of course he could be lying, but someone who just lost $120,000 probably doesn’t have to. Neville asks Mark if he has some sort of problem. Mark semi-jokingly insults the man’s hat, and a quick glance over shows us Neville has bodyguards. Mark gets up to leave, and Neville makes sure they’ll talk again soon, but as Mark is walking away he asks if Neville is a gambler?\n\n“Not like you.” Very interesting for a few reasons. We learn Neville is not only powerful, but smart with his money. It also sets up the line Wahlberg repeats. “I’m not a gambler.”\n\nWe then cut to Brie Larson looking over at Mark, and Neville joins him again. They make a bet where Mark wagers $ 5,000, but Neville puts up $10,000. They do acknowledge how this is uneven, but Mark decides to go through with it anyways. They pull out a deck of cards, lay down the money, and Neville pulls up a Kind of Spades. Mark laughs and thinks it is some kind of joke, Neville says, “I thought you wanted my business card.”\n\nNot gonna lie, I have no idea what this means. I think the game was simple. Each player picked a card and whoever had the highest card won. Aces would be low, kings high. Spades are usually seen as the ‘best’ suite, so the King of Spades would be the best card. Automatic loss for Mark. No idea what the business card thing meant though. All that really happens in this scene is Neville offers Mark a stake, or basically a loan.\n\nMark seems to say no and Neville walks away. Then though, we see Mark head up some stairs into a heavily monitored and guarded room. Mr. Lee is in here, watching TV. Here, he points out the problem with this entire opening scene.\n\n“You came in with $10,000 in cash and you didn’t give it to me?” Wait. Mark owed Mister Lee the money. The very money he had on him. The very money he had on him as he went into the place Mister Lee lives, and he didn’t give it to him? Surely not even someone as idiotic as Mark would do that stupid? Right?\n\n“Well this is a gambling establishment.” Oh dear… I understand if he were to have given the money, we wouldn’t have a movie, but when logic fails, I cannot ignore it. (Not to mention the original still exists and it didn’t do this!)\n\nEvery movie will have its own set of rules. Every movie will require you to suspend some disbelief. It happens. You can’t go into a Star Wars movie and say it’s unrealistic, of course it is! But it’s a movie based in a universe where the force exists, and there are entire armies of droids and whatnot. So when you see a ship flying in space, it makes sense. It superhero movies, you have to except super powers exist. The Gambler is set in the real world. It should follow real world rules.\n\nSo when the entire premise of the film is based around Mark Wahlberg needing to payback money, then you cannot have him walk into the place he needs to go with the money he needs to have, and be stupid enough to lose it. Not only that, but then the movie proceeds to setup/show Mark getting TWO more loans of money.\n\nHe enters the scene owing money, he leaves the scene owing money, what was the point? To establish characters? Brie Larson is completely useless in this scene. She and Mark never actually say anything to each other at all. It’s just to show they somehow know each other, and considering that, they could have just kept her as the student and it would be the same.\n\nSo obviously it is to setup Mister Lee and Neville. Ok, that’s fine, we need to know who they are somehow. So why then the stupidity? They could have this same exact scene play out, with one minor difference, and it would be much better. The $10,000 he walked in with no longer belongs to Mister Lee. It’s just $10,000 he had. Out of money, he now gets approached by a loan shark, but he knows Mister Lee. So he goes up and asks him for money. That money, is then the money this movie should be based around.\n\nIn a way it is, along with the original $10,000 now. This scene only made me like Mark even less. He was uncaring when his grandfather dies, drives like an idiot, and now he is an idiot. Not only for losing the money, but because he had $40,000 on him. We soon learn he owes a lot more than that, so I can understand the want to get more money. After losing the $40,000 the first time though, he should have stopped, given Mister Lee a good cut of it, and kept some to try again another day. But nope, he lost it all because remember, ‘he’s not a gambler.’\n\nMark then asks if he’s ever not paid Mister Lee, which the answer is obviously yes, as Mister Lee tells him he owes $240,000 and he wants it in seven days. There’s where the plot to the movie kicks in. Again, even after this, I still find the gambling scene a little useless. For the average person $10,000 is still a lot of money. Of course $240,000 is a lot more, but at that point the number itself really doesn’t matter much. The point is, Mark owes a lot of money.\n\nSo don’t have the amount be $240,000. Keep my version of the scene as I wrote it above. Mark goes to Mister Lee, asks for $10,000 and Mister Lee gives it to him. Some time passes and Mister Lee wants his money back, giving Mark 7 days to do. There, everything that just happened, but simplified down a bit to make a little more sense.\n\nThat’s the first 10 minutes of this film. Obviously there are more parts to come, but this seems like a good place to stop for the moment."
