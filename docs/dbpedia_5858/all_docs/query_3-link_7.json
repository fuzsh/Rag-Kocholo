        "text": "On June 17, 1920, in a town located near the northwest border of the Dominican Republic, a group of approximately fifty guardiansFootnote 1 and community leaders listened intently to a presentation made by local school inspector.Footnote 2 In his address to the citizens of Guayubín, L. T. Lithgow boasted about recent improvements in the local school and compared them with what had previously existed. Since the start of the US occupation in 1916, the school in Guayubín had become co-educational and graded, teaching over two hundred students a variety of subjects that included history, geography, writing, arithmetic, and Castellano (Spanish), as well as health, hygiene, and physical fitness across three different grades. In addition to highlighting the expanded student body and school curriculum, Lithgow emphasized the importance of school discipline and urged families to continue the work initiated by school leaders through home education.\n\nAlthough Lithgow's speech encouraged Dominican caretakers to become involved in their children's education, these guardians had already played active roles in the Guayubín school. They elected to enroll their children and made sacrifices to ensure they attended daily, oftentimes traveling long distances from a neighboring town. In addition to making choices that affected their immediate families, guardians also participated in decision-making on a higher level by engaging with local and regional school officials in school meetings and through letter writing. In those instances, guardians articulated their beliefs about education and advocated for the needs of their children and those in their community.\n\nThis article examines the actions of guardians in supporting and creating schools during the US military occupation of the Dominican Republic that lasted from 1916 to 1924. Drawing primarily from sources from the Department of Public Instruction in the Dominican Republic, I argue that Dominican guardians were pivotal to the expansion of the Dominican school system and key actors in shaping the educational landscape during this period. Not only did guardians construct and maintain a majority of the schools opened during the US occupation, but they also influenced school policy. Throughout the eight-year period, guardians influenced external aspects of schools, like their location, in addition to internal ones, such as their staffing or whether schools would be co-educational. Most significantly, through their grassroots efforts and collective advocacy, guardians and other volunteers ensured that schools in the Dominican Republic continued to operate during the financial crisis of 1921 that bankrupted the school system. Thus, between 1916 and 1924, Dominican guardians were vital to both the physical and financial maintenance of their local schools, even in the midst of the financial collapse of the public school system.\n\nDespite being directly involved in schools, Dominican parents and caretakers have often been left out of histories of education during this period. Much of the literature on the US occupation of the Dominican Republic has centered US officials and their use of schools to create a democracy compatible with US interests in the country.Footnote 3 These accounts discuss how education reforms served US foreign policy in regions such as the Pacific and Caribbean. In his work, A. J. Angulo highlights the fundamental role played by guardians in the Dominican Republic through their work in Sociedades Populares de Educación (Popular Education Societies) by establishing and maintaining schools across the country when the national school system was in the midst of a financial crisis.Footnote 4 Most other histories of the occupation, however, have emphasized the significant increases in the number of schools established and percentage of students enrolled during the occupation without contextualizing how these changes occurred.\n\nWhile there have been accounts written about rural resistance to the US military government more broadly, we know far less about the agency of non-elite Dominicans within schools or their perceptions regarding the education reforms during the occupation.Footnote 5 This is partially because there are so few histories of Dominican education. Within those that exist, they briefly discuss school reforms during the occupation and tend to highlight the role of the US military government in expanding rudimentary schools into the Dominican countryside and increasing attendance.Footnote 6 Much of this literature has overlooked patterns of self-determination, focusing instead on how, in 1916, 90 percent of the population in the Dominican Republic was illiterate.Footnote 7 Frequently cited illiteracy rates have reinforced the scholarly assumption that non-elite Dominicans made little or no significant contributions to education policy during the occupation. Emphasizing illiteracy rates without examples of agency in the education system advances the notion that either non-elite Dominicans were powerless against the US military regime, or they were not educated enough to be involved in the debates of the period. This study revisits this assumption by examining the actions of Dominican guardians and their direct contributions to the educational landscape. Their voices, engagement, and agency complicate standard treatments of Dominican guardians as inactive or ineffective sources of change who were confined by their illiteracy or the structures of the military government.\n\nWhile there has generally been a focus on US efforts in the literature on education during the twentieth-century US military occupations, silences around local agency are not distinct to this scholarship.Footnote 8 Similar gaps can be found in historical studies of schooling and educational policy in the US and Latin America as well as in other contexts. As a result, historians of education have often grappled with how difficult it is to retrieve the perspective of those affected by school reforms, particularly the voices of parents and children.Footnote 9 Scholars face these limitations mostly because the documents preserved in the archive tend to be official documents generated by upper-level administrators or school-based principals and teachers. The focus on preserving official documents has edged out other documents, voices, and experiences and has privileged those who interacted through memos, reports, and correspondence with members of the government. Additionally, the reliance on written evidence also benefits those who were literate or who had access to someone who was, and were thus able to leave traces of their thoughts and experiences through the written record. As a result of imbalances in archival collections, histories tend to rely on the documentary evidence available and to leave out significant contributions to education that other involved stakeholders made at the time.\n\nTo address this problem, many historians of education have turned to oral histories and documents outside of official government archives, including yearbooks and student newspapers. They also have analyzed official documents “against the archival grain” and through a critical lens to identify and understand the experiences of others discussed or mentioned in passing.Footnote 10 Drawing on this scholarship, I used this methodology to read the official documents of the Department of Public Instruction held in the Archivo de la Nación (National Archive) and constructed a narrative from the “margins” of the official record. This article illuminates the role of guardians in the occupation by examining the few letters written by guardians to government officials, along with other indirect references to the actions and contributions of guardians in letters written by school officials.\n\nDoing so provides access to underexamined local views on education that reveal how guardians built and maintained schools for their children and those in their community. By piecing together brief moments and mentions of these ordinary citizens through their interactions with the occupation government that eventually became part of the archival record, this study offers an alternative account using limited source material written by the guardians themselves.Footnote 11 Highlighting the contributions and perspectives of guardians—which at times aligned with and at other times opposed US-backed educational reforms—provides an added significance, given that the US military government imposed gag laws to limit public criticism in newspapers and books.Footnote 12 While no single article can offer a comprehensive analysis, as many guardians who participated in the reforms were not captured in these documents, this article provides a first step in tracing the impact of guardians on the education system during the US occupation.\n\nThis article also extends our understanding of local agency in schools. From choosing to bring their child to school daily to advocating for substantial shifts in policy, the Dominican case makes evident how schools have historically been spaces where local actors negotiated policies and exerted their influence on decisions that directly affected their communities. Since guardians operated under the conditions of a military occupation, we must consider power dynamics and examine a range of actions the guardians took as examples of local agency on the basis of their scope of influence. And while it is important to recognize how these examples can help broaden notions of local agency, this situation is also distinct, as it illuminates a case of how actors on the ground created their own schooling opportunities and maintained a national system when the government could no longer support it."
