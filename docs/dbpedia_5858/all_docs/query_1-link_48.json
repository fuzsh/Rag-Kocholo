        "text": "Late January – Fiestas Calle San Sebastian (St. Sebastian Street Festival)\n\nUsually held between the 2nd and 3rd week of January.\n\nThis once-a-year event is known as the biggest party on the island and marks the end of Christmas in Puerto Rico.\n\nDuring the festivals, Old San Juan’s streets are filled with music, gastronomy, and local art.\n\nIt is not at all out of the ordinary to find people dancing and singing in the streets, after all, it is the biggest block party on the island!\n\nBelow is a video of the San Sebastian Street Festival:\n\nBe sure to find your accommodations in advance if you are visiting the island during this festival, and read up on the 30 Best Hotels In Puerto Rico before you book your stay.\n\n18th February – Luis Muñoz Marín’s Day\n\nLuis Muñoz Marín was the first elected governor of Puerto Rico.\n\nHe participated in the drafting of the constitution of Puerto Rico, which was approved by the United States Congress in 1952.\n\nLuis Muñoz Marín helped change the island’s status from U.S. territory to a commonwealth.\n\nThis public holiday celebrates his lifetime achievements.\n\nIf you want to know more about Puerto Rico’s commonwealth status, check out our article Is Puerto Rico Part of the United States?\n\n18th April – José de Diego’s Day\n\nJosé de Diego Martinez was a journalist, lawyer, and advocate for the

in our article Aguadilla – All You Need To Know.\n\n2nd Sunday of May – Mother’s Day\n\nThis is a special holiday for Puerto Ricans and is celebrated on the second Sunday of May.\n\nDuring this day, the whole family gathers — usually in the home of the matriarch of the family.\n\nPuerto Ricans celebrate this day by bringing gifts for the mothers of the family.\n\nSome families bring cooking ingredients or ready-made food to serve during the day.\n\nOther families celebrate by cooking outdoor “BBQs.”\n\nIf you are celebrating Mother’s Day In Puerto Rico, take a look at our guide to the 30

family.\n\nIt’s fair to say that for Puerto Ricans cooking outdoors on Father’s Day is pretty much an unspoken rule.\n\nBut there are many families that bring the food to serve and eat during the day.\n\nIf you are visiting the island for Father’s Day, you could take him on one of the 3 Best Local Food Tours In Puerto Rico to celebrate.\n\n23rd June – Noche de San Juan (St. John’s Night)\n\nThis celebration takes place every June 23.\n\nWhile in many other countries this celebration is in memory of Saint John the Baptist, the locals in Puerto Rico have a somewhat different tradition — a beach party!\n\nSince June 23 is not only the eve of the birth of Saint John the Baptist but also the week of the summer solstice, Puerto Ricans gather at different beaches before midnight to perform the St. John’s Night ritual against bad luck.\n\nBelow is a video of St. John’s night in Puerto Rico:\n\nAccording to tradition, you are supposed to go into the water at the beach (at midnight) and take three backward plunges (though some people do up to 12 dives) to clear out all negativity and bad luck.\n\nRead up on the area in our article San Juan – All You Need To Know.\n\n25th July – Commonwealth Constitution Day\n\nThis is the commemoration of Puerto Rico’s constitution day.\n\nThis Puerto Rican holiday is the celebration of the historic moment when Governor

the Republican party of Puerto Rico.\n\nHe was the first Puerto Rican, and one of the first men of African descent to receive a medical degree.\n\n31st October – Halloween\n\nHalloween is one of the favorite holidays of Puerto Ricans.\n\nPhoto credit: @she.ann03\n\nOn this day, children visit their neighborhood houses for trick-or-treating, but in recent years kids in costumes invading the malls became the most popular Halloween activity.\n\nBelow is a video of the mall in San Juan on Halloween:\n\nPuerto Rico also offers a wide variety of haunted houses for the somewhat more daring.\n\nBelow is a video of the House of Phobia, one of the most visited haunted houses in Puerto Rico:\n\n19th November – Discovery of Puerto Rico Day Observed\n\nThis day commemorates the day when Spanish settlers first landed in Puerto Rico.\n\nAccording to history, on November 19, 1493, Christopher Columbus landed in Puerto Rico where he was received by the native Taíno islanders.\n\nTo this day Puerto Rico commemorates November 19 as the Discovery of Puerto Rico.\n\n4th Thursday of November – Thanksgiving\n\nThanksgiving is a family holiday for Puerto Ricans.\n\nThis is the day when Puerto Ricans show off their cooking skills!\n\nThanksgiving dinner usually consists of arroz con gandules (rice and baby peas), baked turkey, baked ham with pineapple, potato salad, Puerto Rican macaroni salad, and more.\n\nCheck out the traditional Thanksgiving in Puerto Rico in the following video:\n\nDuring Thanksgiving, the whole family gathers and spends the day together putting up the Christmas tree and decorations before dinner is served.\n\nFor Puerto Ricans Thanksgiving is when Christmas officially starts!\n\nOn the Island, Christmas lasts around 45 days, beginning on Thanksgiving up to the middle of January.\n\n24th December – Christmas Eve\n\nDecember 24 is another family gathering holiday.\n\nOn Christmas eve, Puerto Ricans gather with family for a party with music and food.\n\nOne of the ways Puerto Ricans celebrate Christmas is with “parrandas” — which is the Puerto Rican version of caroling.\n\nPuerto Ricans gather in front of a house with instruments like tambourines, maracas, cuatros, and more to sing aguinaldos (traditional Christmas songs).\n\nThe difference is that a parranda is more like surprise caroling, usually after midnight. The parranderos assemble as quietly as possible before breaking into song and waking up the household.\n\nBelow is a video of a Puerto Rican parranda:\n\n25th December – Christmas Day\n\nPretty much like every other holiday, this is a family gathering day. On this day Puerto Ricans spend it as a family exchanging and enjoying gifts.\n\nSome families visit Old San Juan to enjoy the decorated streets.\n\nPhoto Credit: @lentedemapy\n\n31st December – New Year’s Eve\n\nThe 31st of December is also a day of gathering with family and close friends.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve, as midnight approaches, Puerto Ricans gather (usually with relatives) to reminisce about the year.\n\nThis is also the time of the year for Puerto Ricans to demonstrate their cooking skills and eat traditional food.\n\nIf you want to know more about Puerto Rican food, check out this article about 30 Best Puerto Rican Street Foods.\n\nFAQ section\n\nDoes Puerto Rico have special holidays?\n\nPuerto Ricans consider all of Christmas special holidays.
