The Cuban-born dancer, of mixed Spanish and African heritage, came to prominence in the early 1990s while still in his teens, and esteemed dance companies in both North America and Europe began offering him lead romantic roles over the next decade. After a stint in Houston, Acosta joined England’s Royal Ballet in 1998. With his fabled grace and athleticism, he has earned comparisons to Mikhail Baryshnikov or Rudolf Nureyev. A writer for London’s Independent newspaper described Acosta as “a dancer who slashes across space faster than anyone else, who lacerates the air with shapes so clear and sharp they seem to throw off sparks.” Born in 1973, Acosta was the eleventh and last child in an impoverished Havana family whose home was in one of the rougher quarters of that city. His father was a truck driver, and his mother often suffered from health problems. The island nation of Cuba had become a socialist state after the 1959 victory by Marxist guerrilla leader Fidel Castro, but remained overwhelmingly poor. Acosta grew up with no toys, sometimes went shoeless, and did not even have a birthday cake\n\nuntil he turned 23. The streets of his neighborhood provided plenty of entertainment, however, and he spent his time playing soccer, break-dancing, and raiding nearby mango groves with his friends. He was an overly energetic child, and Pedros Acosta, his father, felt that his youngest son would soon land in serious trouble. Dance training at one of the state-funded schools, his father decided, would teach the boy discipline and provide him with a free lunch every day.\n\nHad Early Troubles With Ballet Image At the age of nine Acosta entered a school that served as a feeder for Cuba’s National Ballet School. He had to wake at five a.m., then take three buses to get to after-school ballet class; sometimes he fell asleep on the bus, however, and missed his stop. Moreover, he found the ballet training very dull compared to Havana’s lively streets, and worried what his friends would think. He began to skip classes outright, recalling that “I started to have problems because I thought ballet was sissy,” Acosta told a writer for London’s Independent newspaper. When his father learned of this, he punished him harshly. “He beat me with a belt, one time with a\n\n2 • Contemporary Hispanic Biography • Volume 4\n\nAt a Glance . . .\n\nB\n\norn in 1973, in Havana, Cuba; son of Pedro\n\nAcosta (a truck driver) and Maria Quesada. Edu-\n\ncation: Attended ballet school at Pinar del Río, Cuba, and the National Ballet School of Cuba, Havana. Career: English National Ballet, principal dancer,\n\nlevel, an excellent training ground, for many of its teachers had benefited from rigorous Russian schooling—a legacy of the cultural ties between the former Soviet Union and Cuba. Acosta was able to travel outside of Cuba for the first time, taking part in an exchange program in Italy at the age of 16, and winning the 1990 Prix de Lausanne in Switzerland, one of ballet’s most coveted honors.\n\nRose to Fame in Ballet World\n\n1991-92; National Ballet of Cuba, principal dancer, 1992-93; Houston Ballet, principal dancer, 1993-98; Royal Ballet of England, principal dancer, 1998–; American Ballet Theater, New York City, guest dancer, 2002; guest dancer with companies in Munich, Stuttgart, St. Petersburg, and Athens, 2000s. Awards: Prix de Lausanne, 1990.

I wanted to quit, but my father wouldn’t listen. One time I told him, ‘I want to be a normal person.’ He took me to the balcony of our apartment and pointed to the people on the street below. ‘You want to be like them, with no future?’” Acosta was finally ejected from the school at age 13, but his teachers suggested another place that might take him; when he and his father arrived in the city of Villa Clara, there had been a mistake, and there was no chance of enrollment in its school. He and his father were forced to sleep in the bus station for two nights while waiting for the next bus home. Still determined, Acosta’s father found a ballet school in Pinar del Río that would take his son, and it was a boarding school as well—which would make it harder for him to miss class. Moreover, some of his siblings lived in the city, so he could stay with them on the weekends. Teachers at the Pinar del Río school gave him a one-month tryout, and in those first weeks alongside other students, Acosta suddenly realized that he had a natural affinity for ballet. He began working much harder than he had before, and teachers were pleased with his steady progress. The school also took a field trip to see a performance of the National Ballet of Cuba, and Acosta was surprised at how athletic the dancers were. “I realized I could touch people with ballet,” he told New York Times journalist Anna Kisselgoff. “That’s when I started to like it.” He gained entrance into the prestigious National School of Ballet when he was 14, and quickly emerged as one of its most promising students. The school was considered, even on an international\n\nIn 1991 Acosta was offered a slot with the English National Ballet, but a bone spur injury in his ankle hampered his performance time in London. After surgery in Cuba, he joined the National Ballet of Cuba for its 1992-93 season. While on a tour of Spain, Acosta was approached by Ben Stevenson, director and choreographer of the Houston Ballet, and Stevenson offered Acosta—just twenty years old—to join what was one of leading companies in the United States. Acosta made his debut in Houston in November of 1993. Stevenson became an important mentor to Acosta, working with him to develop his repertoire in several lead roles, and the novice dancer thrived under the tutelage and came into his prime. He appeared in Don Quixote, Dracula, and The Nutcracker, and traveled to Europe for special guest performances. Invited for a stint as principal dancer in fall of 1997 season with London’s Royal Ballet, Acosta was slightly disappointed that he did not dance as much as he had hoped. After appearing in just eleven performances in one three-month span, he reflected in an interview with Houston Chronicle writer Molly Glentzer that the London scene was a far different one from the nurturing corps de ballet environment in Houston under Stevenson. “Who said ballet is easy?” Acosta reflected. “And sometimes it’s not fair. You find there’s a lot of politics. They don’t give you the right part sometimes. But you keep pushing. You just have to show the right attitude.” Still, Acosta did make enough of an impression on international balletomanes that some began deeming him the next Baryshnikov or Nureyev, perhaps the best known male ballet dancers of the twentieth century. In a 1997 article, Dance writer Putnam asserted that Acosta “has polish, power, and ease when launching himself into the air with apparently no preparation, tossing off yet-to-be-named steps that leave audiences dazzled. His turns are marvels, both for their number of revolutions and their control: After speeding up at will, he often slows the ending in an insolent display of cool.” As his repertoire widened, Acosta also won praise for his acting abilities. A fellow dancer, Paloma Herrera, told WWD’s Robert Haskell that Acosta’s “presence is unbelievable when he goes onstage. He has a very powerful personality, but at the same time his dancing is clean and pure, so there’s a wonderful contrast. As a ballerina, you feel very secure with him.” Acosta has said that his biggest fear is dropping a ballerina during\n\nAcosta • 3 one of their lifts, and reportedly does a thousand push-ups daily in order to maintain the necessary upper-body strength.\n\nSurprised by Success\n\nnow, you’ll be doing this or that,’ I would have said, ‘Nah.’ Everything happened so fast.” Modestly, he dismissed comparisons to the other great male dancers before him, but did concede in the Houston Chronicle article that with “Baryshnikov and all the biggest stars ѧ it’s not about one thing,” Glentzer quoted him as saying. “It’s about everythingѧ. When I think of Baryshnikov, I don’t think how many pirouettes he can do or how high he jumps. It’s the charisma: how he does it. You really have to enjoy dancing. Every time I perform, I have fun.”\n\nIn 1998 Acosta joined the Royal Ballet permanently, after an emotional farewell performance in Houston. He toured Japan and China with the Royal Ballet, appeared in Brazil, and still danced with the National Ballet of Cuba on occasion. The source of financial support for his family back in Cuba, Acosta once bought himself a new German luxury automobile—but realized that it cost more than his parents’ Havana home and traded it in for a used one. He remains grateful that his father pushed him so hard, as he told Putnam in the Dance interview, “He means everything to me.” Acosta declared, “He never gave up on me.”\n\nSources\n\nIn June of 2002 Acosta delighted New York City audiences with an appearance with the American Ballet Theater in a run of Le Corsaire. He has started to write his autobiography, and will premiere a new dance project, Tocororo (A Cuban Tale) in London in the summer of 2003. “It’s about a woman who separates two gangs, and tells them that we don’t learn from the past if we make war,” Acosta explained to the New York Times’s Kisselgoff. “Tocororo is the national Cuban bird, and the music has drums and salsa: Cuban rhythms.” He remains an ardent salsa dancer himself, and still owns the first trophy he ever won—at age nine, for break-dancing. “I never thought I was going to get this far,” Acosta told the Houston Chronicle’s Glentzer. “If somebody had told me, ‘Five years from\n\nBack Stage, June 14, 2002, p. 11.

These are nonphotosynthetic, primarily microscopic organisms that drift in the upper layers of salt water and form the base of the marine food chain. Much of Alvariño’s research has focused on the zooplankton of fish spawning grounds. Over a career spanning more than 50 years, Alvariño has discovered 22 new marine species. Since her retirement from the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) in La Jolla, California, as an emeritus scientist, Alvariño has been researching the biological collections made by early marine expeditions.\n\nAs an undergraduate Alvariño attended the Lycee Concepcion Arenal in El Ferrol. There she studied the natural sciences, physics, chemistry, and mathematics, as well as languages, world literature, history, geography, philosophy, psychology, logic, and art history. In 1933 Alvariño received her baccalaureate degree, summa cum laude, from the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain, after passing her final examinations and submitting dissertations in both sciences and letters—on social insects, bees, and ants, and on the women in Don Quixote.\n\nAngeles Alvariño was born on October 3, 1916, in El Ferrol, Spain. Her parents, Antonio Alvariño Grimaldos and Maria del Carmen Gonzáles Díaz-Saavedra de Alvariño, encouraged her early interest in natural history. From a very young age, she read the volumes on zoology in her father’s library. Alvariño studied piano throughout her childhood until she entered the university; but from the age of four, she was determined to become a physician like her father. However, her father vehemently opposed this choice because he did not want her to experience the pain and suffering associated with patients whose conditions were untreatable.\n\nAlthough her ambition to study medicine remained strong, Alvariño’s father continued to object. Therefore she entered the University of Madrid (now University Complutense) in 1934 to study the natural sciences, a curriculum that shared several subjects with the medical course. However, the university closed in 1936 and remained closed for the duration of the Spanish Civil War. During this period Alvariño improved her French and began studying English. When the university reopened in 1939, she resumed her studies, earning a master’s degree with honors in natural sciences in 1941. During her years at the University of Madrid,\n\nAlvariño • 5\n\nAt a Glance . . .\n\nB\n\norn Angeles Alvariño on October 3, 1916, in El\n\nFerrol, Spain; daughter of Antonio Alvariño\n\nGrimaldos and Maria del Carmen Gonzáles DíazSaavedra de Alvariño; married Sir Eugenio Leira Manso, 1940; children: Angeles Leira Alvariño.

In 1940 Alvariño married Sir Eugenio Leira Manso, an officer in the Royal Navy of Spain and a Knight of the Royal and Military Order of Saint Hermenegild. After earning her degree Alvariño taught biology, zoology, botany, and geology at various colleges in El Ferrol until 1948, when she moved to Madrid with her husband and daughter. There she joined the Department of Sea Fisheries, as a fishery research biologist. Between 1948 and 1952 she also worked as a histologist at the Superior Council of Scientific Research. Alvariño wanted to continue her studies at the Spanish Institute of Oceanography in Madrid. However, women were officially barred from the institute because research in marine biology was conducted on vessels belonging to the Spanish Royal Navy and a law, dating back to Charles III, prohibited women from staying on navy ships. Nevertheless, based on her academic qualifications, Alvariño was admitted to the institute’s courses in biological, physical, and chemical oceanography and she was allowed to begin conducting research there. Simultaneously pursuing her studies at the University of Madrid, Alvariño earned her doctoral certificate in chemistry in 1951 with three separate dissertations: a study of personality for a thesis in experimental psychology, a study of phosphates in the ocean for a chemistry thesis, and a study of the distribution, uses, and commerce of seaweeds for a plant ecology dissertation. In 1952, as a result of a competitive examination, Alvariño won an appointment as a biologist and oceanographer at the Spanish Institute of Oceanography. Since the institute was a part of the Spanish navy, Alvariño was given an honorary military rank of captain.\n\nSan Diego, associate professor, 1982-84; National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico, visiting professor, 1982-86.

There she immersed herself in an international intellectual environment that included students from\n\nBecame Zooplankton Expert The following year Alvariño was awarded a British Council Fellowship to study zooplankton at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Plymouth, England. There she worked with the prominent English marine biologist, Dr. Sir Frederick Stratten Russell, an expert on zooplankton, particularly the medusae or jellyfish. Thus Alvariño began her lifelong study of the Chaetognatha, Siphonophora, medusae, and fish larvae. Very little was known about these animals in the 1950s. Chaetognaths, a phylum of about 50 species of marine plankton, also called arrowworms, are abundant, tiny carnivores that feed on other zooplankton. Their responses to small chemical and physical characteristics of sea water make them important biological indicators of water type. Siphonophores and other hydrozoans are colonial, swimming or floating animals of the phylum Cnidaria (coelenterates), including Physalia, the Portuguese man-of-war. These organisms are made up of zooids, colonial cells that are specialized for floating, sensing, feeding, or reproduction. The gastrovascular canals of all of the zooids in a colony are contiguous. New colonies bud from the stem of the siphonophore.\n\n6 • Contemporary Hispanic Biography • Volume 4 Siphonophores, like the chaetognaths, are predators that feed on other plankton, including fish larvae and krill (small shrimp-like crustaceans). Medusae are the free-swimming forms of the hydrozoan cnidarians. Alvariño studied all of the zooplankton groups that were found in collections from the Bay of Viscay and the English Channel. She discovered Sagitta friderici in plankton samples of the chaetognatha. This is a species normally found in the shallow, warm or temperate waters of the eastern Atlantic coast. She also found abundant eggs and larvae of Sardina pilchardus in samples from herring fishery areas. Her discovery of these organisms off the British coast indicated the abnormal northward movement of warm water that was displacing the herring fisheries. Returning to Spain in 1954, Alvariño began designing and manufacturing plankton nets, which she gave to Spanish fishing boats and research ships for collecting samples. This enabled her to study zooplankton collected from the Iberian Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. In 1956 Alvariño was awarded a Fulbright Fellowship to work with Dr. Mary Sears at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts. Sears, a well-known expert on zooplankton, especially the Siphonophora, and chair of the First International Congress on Oceanography, was so impressed with Alvariño’s research and the breadth of her knowledge, that she recommended her to Dr. Roger Revelle, director of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California in La Jolla. From 1958 until the end of 1969, Alvariño worked as a biologist at Scripps, examining the chaetognaths, siphonophores, and medusae in plankton collected off the coast of California and from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. During those years she was a grantee of the U. S. Office of the Navy and the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations. Between 1961 and 1969 she also held grants from the U. S. National Science Foundation. Alvariño also became a United States citizen in 1966. An expert on taxonomy and zoogeography, Alvariño’s discoveries included 12 new species of Chaetognatha, nine new species of Siphonophora, and a new medusa. She also established the worldwide three-dimensional distribution of various species of chaetognaths and siphonophores. Alvariño’s research at Scripps earned her a doctor of sciences degree summa cum laude in 1967 from the University of Madrid.\n\nJoined the SWFSC In 1970 Alvariño accepted a position as a fishery research biologist at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC), a division of the newly formed National Marine Fisheries Service, a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA). Alvariño’s research focused on the geographic distribution and ecology of zooplankton, especially the\n\ndistribution of chaeognath and siphonophore species in the Pacific and Antarctic Oceans and on the relationships between zooplankton and the ocean environment. She examined the effects of plankton predation on fish larvae survival and the impact on fisheries and the biotic environment of fish spawning grounds. She identified zooplankton that are indicator species, based on their associations with specific ocean currents and other forms of ocean dynamics or with other types of organisms, such as spawning fish, eggs, and larvae. She also studied the artificial transport of plankton into new areas of the ocean, via pollution and ship bilge tanks, and the effects of these exotic organisms on the biotic environment. Between 1977 and 1979 Alvariño coordinated oceanic research for Hispano-American countries. She held Antarctic research grants between 1979 and 1982 and grants from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Alvariño directed doctoral theses candidates at various universities in the western hemisphere and served on thesis committees in the United States and abroad. Her concurrent university appointments included associate professorships at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in 1976, San Diego State University between 1979 and 1982, and at the University of San Diego between 1982 and 1984. She held visiting professorships at the Federal University of Paraná in Brazil in 1982 and at the National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico between 1982 and 1986. Alvariño has published more than 100 original scientific books, book chapters, and journal articles. On July 23, 1993, King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sophia of Spain awarded her the Great Silver Medal of Galicia. She is an emeritus fellow of the American Institute of Fishery Research Biologists and a fellow of the San Diego Society of Natural History. She is a member of the Biological Society of Washington and the HispanoAmerican Association of Researchers on Marine Sciences. In addition to Spanish and English, Alvariño is fluent in French and Portuguese and speaks some German. A lover of art, classical music, and literature, Alvariño and her husband, a retired naval captain, have one daughter, Angeles Leira Alvariño, who is an architect and city planner. Angeles Alvariño has continued her scientific work on plankton and other subjects since her official retirement from the SWFSC as an emeritus scientist in 1987. The first woman scientist to work on a British research vessel, she has continued to participate in expeditions on the research vessels of various countries. In recent years Alvariño has conducted historical research focusing on early oceanography, including the explorations of Spanish navigators who discovered the oceans of the world and the main oceanic currents and the First Scientific Oceanic Expedition that sailed the western Atlantic Ocean and all of the Pacific Ocean between 1789 and 1794.

His extraordinary novels, flush with magical realism and sensual detail, won several prestigious awards abroad. Interview magazine wrote, “[Arenas’s] writing is so exquisitely evocative and truthful and free it’s as though his words have wings that could take him—artistically, sexually, and even politically—anywhere on a physical or emotional level.” Yet, under the totalitarian regime of Communist Cuba, Arenas couldn’t travel anywhere. For twenty years he endured harassment, surveillance, and imprisonment. Arenas finally escaped to New York in 1980.\n\ncompelling. He died in relative obscurity; barely a dozen people attended his funeral. Yet, a writer often finds immortality through his words, and Arenas, whose work resonated with viscerally wrenching imagery, was no exception. Following his death Before Night Falls was published to critical acclaim and turned into a 2000 film of the same name. The film brought Arenas’s work to a wider audience and helped prompt his posthumous rise to take his place as “one of the truly great writers to come out of Latin America” according to the Chicago Tribune. His work is currently widely available and is required reading in several university programs. However, in Cuba it remains banned.\n\nBy the time of his death in 1990, Arenas had completed nine novels, an autobiography, scores of poems, plays, and short stories, as well as dozens of political and literary essays. However, he had long-since gone out of literary favor. As he noted in his autobiography, Before Night Falls, “Ironically, while I was in jail and could not leave Cuba, my chances of being published were better because I was not allowed to speak out.” As an exile in the United States, he was much less\n\nEscaped Poverty Through Stories Reinaldo Arenas was born in rural Cuba on July 16, 1943. Abandoned by his father, Arenas was raised by his mother on her parents’ farm. At the time Cuba was ruled by the dictator Fulgencio Batista and Arenas recalled to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, “The situation under Batista in the countryside was terrible.” Poverty was ever-present and hunger a constant companion.\n\nArenas • 9\n\nAt a Glance . . .\n\nB\n\norn on July 16, 1943, in the Oriente province of\n\nCuba; died on December 7, 1990, in New York,\n\nNY; son of Oneida Fuentes.

His only solace was nature. “I think the splendor of my childhood was unique because it was absolute poverty but also absolute freedom; out in the open, surrounded by trees, animals ѧ,” he wrote in Before Night Falls. It was there that he began his literary career, composing songs and stories to keep himself company. “I would perform them in those lonely fields as if they were theater pieces,” he wrote. By the time Arenas reached his teens, his family had sold their farm and moved to the dreary town of Holguín. About this time Arenas took a job at a guava paste factory, working 12 hour shifts for one peso a day. The work was mind-numbingly boring and Arenas began channeling that boredom into stories he churned out on a small typewriter. Eventually the boredom of Holguín, as well as the continued hardships under Batista, convinced the 14 year-old Arenas to join Fidel Castro’s rebel forces. However, his youth—and more importantly his lack of a rifle—kept him from fighting. Nevertheless, when Castro took control of the island in\n\n1959 Arenas was swept up in the revolutionary fervor. “I believed, or wanted to believe, that the Revolution was something noble and beautiful,” he wrote. However, he soon began to notice that the new government was wrought with hypocrisy. It would not be long before he would come to believe that he had helped overthrow one dictator only to replace him with another. Arenas received a scholarship to study agricultural accounting and was assigned to work on a government chicken farm after graduation. It was a tedious job and Arenas leapt at the chance to move to Havana when he was offered a scholarship to study economic planning at the University of Havana in 1961. Not long after arriving in Havana Arenas began to immerse himself in the then-thriving gay subculture of the city. He had realized he was homosexual when he was still a child, but during his years in school he hid his feelings because of the persecution that gays were subjected to by the government. Many were fired from their jobs, kicked out of school, or sent to concentration camps to be rehabilitated. One of Arenas’s earliest boyfriends was taken to such a camp. “I never saw him again, nor have I heard of him since my exile,” he wrote in Before Night Falls. In Havana Arenas entered a storytelling contest sponsored by the National Library and won. However, the judges were less interested in his storytelling ability than in the story he had told. Rather than read a well-known tale, he had written his own. The library directors, impressed with his literary skill, immediately offered Arenas a job at the library. “My transfer there was decisive for my literary education. My job consisted in looking for the books people requested, but there was always time to read,” he wrote in Before Night Falls. There was also time to write, and his first book, Singing from the Well, was written in the library. The story of a mentally-impaired child growing up in rural Cuba won an award from the Cuban Writers and Artists Union (UNEAC) in 1965 and became the only one of Arenas’s books to be published in Cuba. According to an article in the Village Voice Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes called the book, “One of the most beautiful novels ever written about childhood, adolescence, and life in Cuba.” Arenas’s next book was Hallucinations: Being an Account of the Life and Adventures of Friar Servando Teresa de Meir. It was a fantastical rewriting of the autobiography of a revolutionary Mexican friar who defied the Spanish conquest of his country and was mercilessly persecuted for it. It was also an almost eerie foreshadowing of the fate that was to befall Arenas.\n\nImprisoned For His Books Though Hallucinations also won an award from UNEAC, it was banned by the government for its antirevolutionary tone. The following year, with the help of French friends, Arenas smuggled Hallucinations out\n\n10 • Contemporary Hispanic Biography • Volume 4 of the country. It was published to acclaim in Mexico and Spain; in France it was named the best foreign novel of 1969. “If I had been living in the free world, this would have served me well,” he wrote in Before Night Falls. Instead, “in Cuba, the official impact ѧ was for me absolutely negative.” For publishing abroad, without the consent of the government, Arenas was labeled a counterrevolutionary. “By the year 1969 I was already being subjected to persistent harassment by State Security, and feared for the manuscripts I was continually producing.” In 1970 Arenas—along with many other young intellectuals—was sent to work on a sugarcane plantation. “Unless you have lived through it, you could not possibly understand what it means to be in a Cuban sugar plantation under the noon sun, and to live in barracks like slaves,” he wrote in Before Night Falls. It inspired his long poem El central, which was smuggled out and published in Spain. Meanwhile Arenas was working on Farewell to the Sea, one of five novels to make up his Pentagon series detailing the history of Cuba. Set at a beach resort, the novel reveals the inner thoughts of a Cuban couple and the way Castro’s revolutionary government damaged their lives. That the book was written is a testament to Arena’s determination. The original manuscript was lost when he placed it in hiding with friends. He rewrote the book, only to have it confiscated by the police. Finally, he was able to smuggle his third rewrite of the book to France in 1980. Other books in the Pentagon included Singing From the Well; The Palace of the White Skunks, which was also smuggled to France; The Color of Summer; and The Assault. The latter two were written in the United States. In 1973, after an altercation on a beach, Arenas was arrested and charged with “ideological deviation.” While out on bail he made a daring escape and eluded police for several months. During that time he attempted to leave the country several times. When that failed, he tried to commit suicide by slicing his wrists with a broken bottle. When that also failed, he resorted to his oldest companion—writing. He wrote an open letter to international agencies and free governments. “I wanted to report all the persecution I was being subjected to,” he wrote in Before Night Falls. The letter was smuggled out by a French friend and was published in France and Mexico. When Arenas was finally captured he was sent to El Morro prison— coincidentally the same prison where Friar Servando had been incarcerated. The prison was loud, hot, and overcrowded. Excrement piled in corners, urine flowed like rancid rivers, bugs were everywhere. Murder was common and vicious. Food was scarce and barely edible. In addition, Arenas was subjected to intense interrogation. The government wanted him to confess to being a counterrevolutionary and a homosexual and to vow to change. Arenas eventually gave in. It was a bitter, demoralizing defeat for him. “Before my confession I had a great companion, my pride,” he wrote in\n\nBefore Night Falls. “After the confession I had nothing; I had lost my dignity and my rebellious spirit.” Though Arenas was released from prison in 1976, he continued to live in fear. He was regularly visited by the police and his room was occasionally ransacked. He had to write in secret and could trust no one. “That was my life in early 1980; surrounded by spies and seeing my youth vanish without ever having been a free person,” he wrote in Before Night Falls. In 1980 Arenas decided he had had enough and, after doctoring his identity card, joined the over 130,000 Cubans who were allowed to leave the island during the Castro-sanctioned Mariel Boat Lift. On May 4, at one in the morning, Arenas boarded a boat for Key West. “When officials in the government realized I was gone, I discovered later, they sent a boat after me, but it was too late,” he told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. By the end of the year Arenas was living in New York City, 37 years old, and free for the first time in his life.\n\nWrote Furiously in Freedom In New York Arenas entered a creative frenzy. He completed the Pentagon series and wrote Journey to Havana, Mona and Other Tales, and The Doorman. He also completed Before Night Falls which he had begun during his days as a fugitive hiding from the police. When it was published three years after his death it made The New York Time’s top ten list. Along with other exiled Cuban writers he founded the shortlived literary magazine Mariel. When not writing, he taught Cuban poetry and lectured at universities including Cornell, Princeton, and Georgetown. In 1982 Arenas won a Guggenheim Fellowship and in 1987 a Woodrow Wilson Center Fellowship. In addition he relished his new freedom, traveling throughout Europe and road tripping across the United States. He wrote of his travels in Before Night Falls: “for the first time we were able to enjoy the sense of freedom and the thrill of adventure without feeling persecuted; in short, the pleasure of being alive.” Despite his hard-won freedom, Arenas continued to suffer. His foreign publishers either refused to pay him for his books or paid him a pittance after much hassle. “None of this surprised me: I already knew that the capitalist system was also sordid and money-hungry,” Arenas wrote in Before Night Falls. He continued, “In one of my first statements after leaving Cuba I had declared that ‘the difference between the communist and capitalist systems is that, although both give you a kick in the ass, in the communist system you have to applaud, while in the capitalist system you can scream. And I came here to scream.’” His screaming did not win him a lot of friends. The intellectual left tended to side with Castro without really knowing what the Cuban people suffered. Other exiled Cubans were busy building wealthy new lives. It was suggested that Arenas forget his past and go on. “But after twenty years of repression, how could I keep silent about those\n\nArenas • 11 crimes?” he asked in Before Night Falls. At the same time he longed for Cuba and loathed his exiled state. He wrote, “I ceased to exist when I went into exile.”\n\nOtra vez el mar, 1982, translated as Farewell to the Sea, Viking, NY, 1986.

Each time he recovered, crediting his works for his returns to health. “Writing those books kept me alive,” he told the author of A Sadness as Deep as the Sea. “Especially the autobiography. I didn’t want to die until I had put the final touches. It’s my revenge.” On December 7, 1990, not long after completing the manuscript, wholly debilitated from the disease, Arenas took an overdose of pills. In his suicide note, reprinted in Before Night Falls, he wrote, “Due to my delicate state of health and to the terrible emotional depression it causes me not to be able to continue writing and struggling for the freedom of Cuba, I am ending my life.” He went on to blame Castro for his life’s sufferings and concluded with the type of defiant hope that had allowed him to create brilliant art despite the darkest oppression: “Cuba will be free. I already am.”\n\nSources\n\nSelected writings\n\nInterview, January-April 2001, p. 46. St. Louis Post-Dispatch, February 23, 2001, p.

Arrarás was given a plum spot at Telemundo, and her arrival coincided with news that the National Broadcasting Company (NBC)’s $2.7 billion acquisition of the Spanishlanguage news and entertainment provider had just won U.S. government approval. Arrarás, an attractive and admired media celebrity in the Latino world, was to host her own Telemundo show, but would also file English-language reports for Dateline, NBC’s toprated prime-time newsmagazine. Arrarás’s hire—and the Telemundo/NBC venture—was seen as a sign of an increased Hispanic presence in mainstream media news organizations, and New York Times journalist Mirta Ojito called the new, lucrative contract for this popular journalist “NBC’s first coup in the Latino media.” Arrarás was born in 1960 in the city of Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, but spent most of her youth in the country’s capital, San Juan. Her father was a university chancellor who became a politician, serving as Puerto Rico’s housing secretary and minority leader in the\n\nHouse of Representatives. Arrarás recalled in an interview with Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service reporter Judy Hevrdejs that she and her family were well-known in Puerto Rico because of her father’s career. “I hated it. ѧ whatever we would do, we would get interruptions constantly.” She told Hevrdejs that as a child she vowed to lead a quieter life, one out of the public eye.\n\nFound Career in Television Journalism Arrarás grew up in an achievement-oriented family, and earned good grades. She was also a talented swimmer, and at the age of eleven took a gold medal at the 1971 Central American Games in Cuba. After qualifying for a spot on Puerto Rico’s Olympic team for the 1976 Summer Games in Montreal, the teenaged Arrarás was forced to quit when she was diagnosed with mononucleosis. Sensing a need for a new challenge for his daughter, Arrarás’s father suggested that she begin writing a column for a newspaper he owned. She was pleasantly surprised to realize she liked journalism. “It was like ‘click,’” she told Ojito in the New York Times. “A light went on.” Fluent in English, Arrarás attended Loyola University in New Orleans, where she earned her 1982 honors\n\nArrarás • 13\n\nAt a Glance . . .\n\nB\n\norn on September 27, 1960, in Mayaguez, Puerto\n\nRico; daughter of Jose Enrique (a university chan-\n\ncellor, politician, and newspaper publisher); married Guillermo (divorced); married Manny Arevesu; three children.

Soon, Univision’s New York City affiliate hired her as its news anchor, and the WXTV job in Manhattan was considered a career-making post. Yet Arrarás was forced to give up the job when station executives deemed her not glamorous enough. It was a tough lesson, she remembered during a New York Times interview. “He said, ‘I’ve handed you a bag of lemons. You can either get sour or make lemonade.’ I chose to stay and make lemonade.” Arrarás went on to other slots at the network, serving as Univision’s bureau chief in Los Angeles and anchor of the weekend newscast in Miami. In time she was given a co-anchor spot with a wellknown Univision personality, Myrka Dellanos, on the show Noticias y Mas. That news and feature-story show eventually became the hugely successful Primer Impacto, which would launch Arrarás’s career in earnest. Airing in several U.S. markets and in 15 Latin American countries, with a total viewership of 100 million, Primer Impacto offered news and entertainment stories and even an astrology report. Arrarás was the host and reported on special events, such as the U.S. presidential conventions and the Olympics; she also interviewed top political leaders of the Latin world. The\n\nshow’s impressive ratings brought in lucrative advertising dollars for Univision, and one prime-time special edition of the show earned the second-highest rating— ever—in the Nielsen Hispanic Index. For many, though, Arrarás was the draw, and she seemed to hit her stride on the show. She loosened up her wardrobe and her hairstyles, and began making jokes. “For the first time, I could smile on the air,” she recalled in an interview with Ojito. “It was refreshing and different, and it suited my personality better.” She was also becoming a well-known figure in the South Florida Hispanic community, and found that she was a news story herself: every detail of her personal life was avidly chronicled by the local press. By this time she had wed a Miami attorney and had three children. The larger national Hispanic media in the United States also liked to run stories about her, and she became a popular cover personality. Deemed a role model for working mothers, Arrarás returned after one maternity leave to Primer Impacto and the show pulled in a record number of viewers. During her tenure at Primer Impacto, Arrarás attained an important coup when she landed an exclusive interview with Yolanda Saldivar, the woman convicted of slaying Tejano singing star Selena in 1995. Saldivar had been a business associate of the star’s family, and founder of the Selena fan club. Arrarás interviewed her from prison, and Saldivar hinted that there was a “secret” behind the tragic slaying. Arrarás pursued the story further and wrote a book, Selena’s Secret: The Revealing Story Behind Her Tragic Death, that was published in 1997 in Spanish and English editions. The resulting press helped land Arrarás on People magazine’s annual “Most Intriguing People of 1997” list.\n\nLeft Univision for Telemundo and NBC In 2001, when Arrarás’s contract with Univision expired, she chose not to renegotiate. Instead, she jumped ship to rival network Telemundo, and her decampment was made public the same week that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced its approval of NBC’s bid to acquire Telemundo. Arrarás’s bold move was considered such a coup for Telemundo that her hire was announced at a press conference in April of 2002 by NBC president Andrew Lack and Telemundo president Jim McNamara. NBC announced its intention to give her a show as well as reporting assignments for NBC news shows like Dateline and the Today Show. Arrarás, Lack told Ojito in the New York Times, “is a star, along the lines of talent like Diane Sawyer and Jane Pauley. I have confidence that she will bring her enormous talent to some of our programs in NBC.” Arrarás’s new show was slated to debut that spring as well. The name Al Rojo Vivo con María Celeste was concocted by her best friend, she explained to Hevrdejs in the Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service report, and\n\n14 • Contemporary Hispanic Biography • Volume 4 meant loosely “red hot”; it was also a pun on her middle name, Celeste, or “sky blue” in Spanish. “You can say, ‘Oh my God! That interview was al rojo vivo.’” she told Hevrdejs. “Why? Because that person spoke out. They said everything. A confession.” As both host and managing editor, Arrarás wanted Al Rojo Vivo to serve as a kind of “‘paella noticias,’ like a news paella,” as she told Hevrdejs. “You have chicken, you have fish, you have sausage, you have rice and vegetables. And what happens is, in one hour, you have news from everything that is going on in the afternoon.” Al Rojo Vivo was a ratings success for Telemundo right from the start, but Arrarás’s debut on Dateline was, again, a news story in itself. In August of 2002 she filed a report on ten-month-old conjoined twins from Guatemala who came to the United States for surgery that would separate them. “Wearing a blue sanitary paper hat and a matching UCLA Medical Center gown,” noted Los Angeles Times writer Dana Calvo, “the glamorous María Celeste Arrarás made her NBC debut on Dateline and in the process made herself into the most prominent player in a blossoming media experiment.” The Los Angeles Times article noted that Arrarás and other journalists who file stories for both networks would need to be extremely fluent in both languages. NBC president Lack, it was reported, had been a bit nervous about Arrarás’s Dateline debut and her bilingual skills, but Lack told Calvo that Arrarás “was credible, so I didn’t think viewers were sitting around thinking, ‘Why is this Spanish-accented person doing this story?’ I think they thought, ‘This person knows the place, knows the story, and it’s important and authoritative.’ She’s a serious, smart journalist.”\n\nNews Star for Twenty-First Century A Los Angeles Times article discussed the inherent differences in the Telemundo and NBC networks, from how a breaking news story is written to the amount and style of accessories its female journalists are allowed to wear on the air. But after just a few months on the job, Arrarás herself was surprised at how little a difference there was between the Spanish-language broadcasting stalwarts and a well-established, deep-pocketed news source like NBC. She said that as a Univision reporter, she and her colleagues had often dreamed of working in the “majors,” as she called them. “We had this big myth that it would be a different ballgame—that it would be awesome, bigger and better,” Arrarás told Calvo. “But, to my surprise, it was very similar. The only difference is there were more resources. You can pre-plan and take things at a more normal pace. In Spanish TV, we have less resources, so we are more aggressive. We are hungrier.”\n\nDespite the tremendous attention given to her debut Arrarás was frank about her talents. “I’m not the greatest anchor in the world,” she told Ojito in the New York Times, “but what I lack in talent I make up with honesty.” Arrarás is the first Latina celebrity spokesperson for PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and is working to ban circuses in Puerto Rico that use animals. Her high-profile job landed her on People en Espanol’s “10 Most Intriguing People of the Year” in 2002. With her own agent at entertainmentindustry powerhouse William Morris, Arrarás was, in the end, still surprised by her choice of career—given the fact that she often disliked being in the public eye as a youngster. “I said I’ll never do that,” she said in the Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service interview, “and little did I know—I ended up doing the same thing.”\n\nSelected works Books Selena’s Secret: The Revealing Story Behind Her Tragic Death, Simon & Schuster, 1997.

She was elected to the state house of representatives in 1974 and the state senate in 1984. Baca’s life has been marked by a passion for public service. As a young woman she worked as an editor for trade journals; she combined this experience with her passion for politics and activism throughout her career. Although much of her focus has been Hispanic issues, her strong belief in the value of multiculturalism has been a key element of her life inside and outside politics. The oldest of four children, Polly Baca was born in 1941 (some sources say 1943) in Greeley, Colorado. Her parents, Jose Manuel and Leda Sierra Baca, were migrant farmers who worked hard to support their family. Baca remembered in particular that her mother instilled a deep sense of pride in her—pride in her heritage and in her ability to succeed.\n\nShowed Early Interest in Politics As a teen-ager, Baca became an orphan; her father was killed in an accident and her mother died not long afterward. She was suddenly faced with the responsibility of caring for her three younger brothers—but she\n\nwas determined to stay in high school and finish her studies. A bright student, she won a scholarship to Colorado State University and planned to major in physics, even though she was more interested in political science and had aspirations of becoming a politician. Part of her decision to major in physics came from a science teacher who told her that a science career would be better for her because as a Hispanic and a woman her chances of success in public life were twice as slim. This was something that Baca would remember throughout her career. Knowing that as a Hispanic and a woman she would have a harder time achieving success was hardly a detriment; actually it gave her the impetus to try harder. It was perhaps not surprising that although she did enter college as a physics major, before long she had switched to political science. While in college Baca became active in campus politics, serving as freshman class secretary. She also became active in her campus chapter of Young Democrats (a group she had been involved with in high school), becoming vice-president and then president. She did volunteer work for the Democratic Party and helped with the campaigns of local candidates; she was also active in the Viva Kennedy clubs that promoted John F. Kennedy to the Hispanic electorate.\n\n16 • Contemporary Hispanic Biography • Volume 4\n\nBegan Political Career At a Glance . . .\n\nB\n\norn in 1941 (some sources say 1943), in Greeley,\n\nCO; married Miguel Barragán, 1968 (divorced);\n\nchildren: Monica, Michael.

In addition to giving her valuable experience in writing and editing, these jobs also gave her the chance to see how public policy was made both within the union and the federal government.\n\nIn 1967 Baca landed a job in the White House, working as a public information officer in the Cabinet Committee on Opportunities for the Spanish Speaking. This job involved research and speechwriting, but it also required her to help coordinate events and speeches that were brought to Hispanic communities. A year later, she became national deputy director of the Hispanic division of Robert F. Kennedy’s presidential campaign. Kennedy’s assassination that summer left Baca and so many of his supporters feeling shocked and lost. Baca took a two-month tour through Latin America, and when she returned she resumed her career, this time as research and information director for the National Council of La Raza in its Phoenix office. She was married briefly to Miguel Barragán, a Chicano activist and former priest. The couple had a son and a daughter. In 1970 she moved back to Colorado and opened up a small public relations business in Denver, Bronze Publications, which she operated for the next 14 years in addition to her many other commitments. Bronze specialized in publicity materials—everything from brochures to press materials to annual reports. Among the organizations she worked with were the National Institute of Mental Health, the Chicano Mobile Institute, the Colorado State University Chicano Studies Program, the National Institute of Education, and VISTA. Those commitments were drawing her closer to a run for public office. From 1971 to 1972 she served as director of Spanish speaking affairs for the Democratic National Committee. In 1974, the state representative seat in her district (Adams County, Colorado) became vacant, and Baca decided to take a chance and seek the nomination. She won the nomination and was elected that November. Baca’s experience with both politics and communication served her well during her tenure as a state representative. In her first year there, she introduced nine house bills and brought six senate bills into the house. This was a surprise to the legislators; usually laws were introduced by members with more seniority. Baca felt that as a public servant she had a greater obligation to her constituents than to political tradition. Of the nine house and six senate bills she brought before the legislators, five were passed by both houses and signed into law. During her term in the house, Baca served as chair of the house Democratic Caucus (the first woman to hold the position), and she sat on a special joint study committee on school finance. In 1978 Baca made a bid for a seat in the state senate and won, making her the state’s first Hispanic senator. As senator, she was responsible for numerous pieces of legislation, including a 1985 bill to allow the state district courts to enforce subpoenas, a 1985 bill regulating the operation of non-state post-secondary schools, and a 1986 bill to protect deposits of public\n\nBaca-Barragán • 17 money held by state and national banks. In 1985 Baca was elected chair of the senate Democratic Caucus. She was the first Hispanic woman to hold that position in the state. In fact, she was the first Hispanic woman in the United States to hold a leadership position in a state senate. During her state senate tenure, Baca also interacted with the international community. She was one of eight state legislators chosen by the American Council of Young Political Leaders to visit the Soviet Union for a study tour. In 1981 the German Marshall Fund selected Baca and 14 other Americans to participate in a “Successor Generation” seminar in Brussels.\n\nCreated Strong Ties as Politician Part of Baca’s success as a politician was her visibility among her constituents and throughout her state. Another element was her good relationship with the Democratic party leadership in Washington, D.C. Her years in Washington, coupled with her hard work and her expertise in public relations and communication, made her one of the best connected Democratic politicians in Colorado. From 1981 to 1989 she served as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, and she was co-chair of the 1980 and 1984 Democratic National Conventions. The Denver Post went so far as to suggest that Baca had more influence in Washington than then-governor Richard Lamm. In 1986 Baca decided it was time to try for the U.S. Congress. She fought a hard battle and was defeated despite her popularity and track record. She decided to retire from politics and devote her time to Sierra Baca, a management consulting firm she had begun in 1985. Sierra Baca focused on many of the same issues that Baca had tackled while in politics: education reform, the role of women and minorities in society, understanding public policy. She ran the company until 1989 when she accepted a position as executive director of the Colorado Hispanic American Institute. The Institute’s mission was to develop multicultural leadership and develop programs that would benefit Hispanics and other minorities. One of the projects she worked on during her five years at the Institute was the\n\ndirection of Visiones, a leadership development program that brought community leaders from different racial and ethnic groups together and helped them to understand one another’s cultures more completely. In February of 1994 Baca was back in Washington briefly. This time she was a special assistant to President Bill Clinton and director of the Office of Consumer Affairs. As part of her duties, she chaired the U.S. delegation to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Committee on Consumer Policy conference. From November of 1994 to May of 1999, Baca was regional administrator for the Rocky Mountain Region of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA). In that capacity she oversaw GSA activities for an area covering six states and 48,000 government employees working in 43 government agencies. In 1999 she went back to her consulting business, Sierra Baca. Her civic activities include serving as executive director of the Latin American Research and Service Agency (LARASA), an advocacy group for the Hispanic community; and InSites, a nonprofit organization that conducts research and evaluation programs for educational organizations.\n\nSources Books Meier, Matt S., Mexican American Biographies: A Historical Dictionary, 1836-1987, Greenwood Press, 1988.

Baird became one of the highest-ranking Hispanic women in the U.S. Justice Department when she was appointed U.S. attorney for the Central District of California in 1990. The post involved supervising cases in a jurisdiction that was the largest in the United States at the time, comprised of seven counties with more than 12 million citizens. During her time in office, Baird played a role in the Justice Department’s civil trial against the Los Angeles police officers who assaulted Rodney King. In 1992 she left the job for a federal judgeship with the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court, where she has continued her involvement in high-profile legal challenges in the Los Angeles area. Baird was born on May 12, 1935, in Quito, Ecuador. Her father moved the family of seven children to Los Angeles a year later, where she attended Roman Catholic parochial schools in the city not far from the family home on Van Ness Avenue. She remembered her female-only high school, Immaculate Heart, as a particularly encouraging environment. “There’s something in retrospect that was great about going to an all-girls high school,” she told Henry Weinstein in a Los Angeles Times interview years later. Weinstein noted\n\nthat the school “was run by a highly independent order of nuns, who later clashed with the Los Angeles Archdiocese,” and Baird affirmed this. “Those nuns were so independent, even in the 1950s,” she told the newspaper.\n\nAppointed U.S. Attorney by Republicans Baird attended secretarial school for a time before marrying William T. Baird, a businessman, at age 21. They couple had three children, and Baird was a homemaker living in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles when she decided to return to school. She began taking classes at Los Angeles City College on a parttime basis, and it took her five years to earn an associate of arts degree. From there she transferred to the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), and earned her sociology degree in 1973. She applied to and was accepted at UCLA’s law school, and did well despite the hardship of a 1975 divorce. After graduating a year later, she took the state bar exam and passed it. Baird began her career as an attorney at the age of 41.

As Weinstein noted, the former judge “assumes her post at a time when the area is considered one of the major national centers of drug crime, money laundering, savings and loan scams and defense contracting fraud, four principal areas of concern to federal prosecutors,” the Los Angeles Times article noted. When she took over, there was even a federal grand jury investigation at her office of Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley for his possible links to a banking scandal.\n\nCareer: United States Attorney’s Office, Los Angeles, CA, prosecutor, 1977-83; Baird, Munger and Myers, partner, 1983-86; East Los Angeles Municipal Court, judge, 1986-87; Los Angeles Municipal Court, judge, 1987; Los Angeles Superior Court, Juvenile Court division, judge, 1988; California’s Central District, U.S. attorney, 1990-92, district court judge, 1992–.

Six years later, in 1983, she went into private practice as partner in Baird, Munger and Myers. In 1986 she accepted an appointment as a municipal court judge in Los Angeles, and two years later became a juvenile-court judge in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Baird’s legal acumen attracted the attention of U.S. Senator Pete Wilson, a Republican, and he proposed her name for a soon-to-be vacant U.S. attorney post in the Los Angeles area; the nomination was somewhat unusual because of Baird’s Democratic political affiliation. Her name was seconded by U.S. President George H. W. Bush, and her appointment was confirmed a few months later by Senate vote. When she was sworn into office in July of 1990, Baird became one of a few U.S. attorneys in history to be appointed during a political administration not of his or her own political affiliation. “Baird will become one of only five female U.S. attorneys in the country and one of the few who speaks Spanish fluently,” wrote Weinstein of the Los Angeles\n\nConfronted With Variety of High Profile Cases In 1991 Baird’s office became involved in the Rodney King case. In March of that year, King, an AfricanAmerican motorist, was stopped by Los Angeles police officers; a subsequent beating was filmed surreptitiously from a nearby apartment building, and released to the media. The tape ignited a firestorm of controversy, and a criminal case against the officers ended in their acquittal. The announcement of that verdict caused Los Angeles’s black community to erupt in anger, and several days of rioting ensued in April of 1992. The federal courthouse that housed Baird’s office was even targeted. Noting her importance as “the top Justice Department official in town,” Los Angeles Times writer Jim Newton went on to describe the scene. “The federal courthouse had come under attack during the early hours of the rioting, and when Baird and other lawyers showed up for work on Thursday morning, the smell of smoke from torched palm trees hung in the elegant entryway, and broken glass carpeted much of the building’s first floor.” By then Baird was part of another investigation into the King incident, after Justice Department officials in Washington launched a probe into whether or not King’s civil rights were violated. “Amid the uproar, Baird moved calmly to choose the attorneys who would represent her office in the case,” Newton wrote. The trial ended with guilty verdicts for the officers, with a jury agreeing that they violated King’s constitutional right to be free from the intentional use of unreasonable force. By that time, however, Baird had moved on to a seat on the bench of the Central District of California’s District Court in September of 1992. There she went on to play a role in several other important cases, including a 1996 lawsuit filed by U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) agent Jorge Guzman, who claimed that he had been unduly harassed at his job because of his Hispanic heritage. Some two dozen internal investigations of him had taken place, but he was never reprimanded, nor did they hinder his subsequent promotions. Guzman “alleged the existence of pervasive anti-Latino sentiments in the inspector general’s office\n\n20 • Contemporary Hispanic Biography • Volume 4 and the INS, especially among old-line officers in high positions,” explained Los Angeles Times writer Patrick J. McDonnell. “As a senior supervisory agent, Guzman is one of the highest-ranking Latinos in the INS’ Los Angeles district.” The final straw was a raid on his home by plainclothes officers with weapons, who frightened the nanny for Guzman’s daughter and his sister, and allegedly made sexual advances toward one of the women; they became co-plaintiffs in his suit. After a trial presided over by Baird, the Justice Department agreed to pay Guzman $400,000 in damages. Baird also put an end to a legal challenge to block California’s controversial Proposition 227, approved by voters in June of 1998. It ended three decades of bilingual-education programs in the California public school system, specifying that all classes be taught “overwhelmingly” in English. Supporters of bilingual education asked Baird’s court to block it just before it was set to go into effect, but she refused. The following year, she heard sides in a case against three banks in Mexico suspected of money-laundering by the U.S. Customs Service. She also agreed with plaintiffs in 1999 that the use of a special restraining chair by sheriffs’ authorities in Ventura County violated the constitutional rights of detainees. In 2000 she reversed a record $143 million award given to a British computer-chip maker for lost pets called Trovan. The suit was brought against pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, who made and marketed an antibiotic also called “Trovan” that was linked to liver failure in animals. Pfizer lost the first round, and was ordered to pay the $143 million—the largest trademark infringement verdict in U.S. history at the time—but then allegations surfaced that the lawyers for Trovan had falsified evidence, including spurious letters by pet-owners confused about the news about the antibiotic and its dangers. In 2003 Baird decided in favor of a group of farm laborers from Mexico, who had come to Ventura County at the invitation of a labor contractor under the\n\nprovisions of a federal guest-worker program known as H-2A. The workers helped harvest the county’s lemon crop during a farm-labor shortage, but alleged that they were not paid in full, nor allowed proper breaks and lunch periods as specified by law. The defendant moved to have the case transferred to federal court, since the guest-worker program was a federal one, but Baird disagreed and returned the case to the Ventura County Superior Court. In her written ruling, she pointed out that the workers from Mexico were still protected under California statutes. “In creating a new system for the admission of H-2A workers ѧ there is no evidence that Congress intended to eliminate these workers’ state law remedies,” she was quoted as saying in her decision by Los Angeles Times journalist Fred Alvarez. Baird has numerous professional ties to the legal community in Southern California and beyond. She belongs to the California Women Lawyers Association, the Mexican American Bar Association, the Latino Judges Association, and the National Association of Women Judges.\n\nSources Books Dictionary of Hispanic Biography, Gale, 1996.

Her career seemed off to a promising start, but she took a break from the fast-paced fashion world to study acting and become a mother. She and her husband, former Miami Heat player Rony Seikaly, became parents to daughter Mila in 2003. Born in 1977, Benitez is a native of Hermosillo, capital city of the northwest Mexican state of Sonora, about an hour’s drive from the Gulf of California. Hermosillo, which lies on the Sonora River, is home to a Ford Motor Company manufacturing plant where the Escort model was once made, and is a thriving agricultural center as well. Growing up, Benitez idolized one of the top models of the 1980s, Linda Evangelista. As a young woman, she reached five feet, ten inches in height, and won a model-search contest in Costa Rica in 1995. She soon began finding work in Latin America, and then signed with Elite Model Management, the agency founded by John Casablancas and later run by Evangelista’s husband, Gerald Marie. Benitez first came to international attention modeling in Europe, and her nascent career was boosted im-\n\nmensely when influential photographer Steven Meisel began working with her. In 1996 she appeared on three covers of Italian Vogue. She also became a favorite of Italian designers Dolce e Gabbana, and appeared in their spring/ summer collections shown in Milan in October of 1996. Stefano Gabbana told a writer for London’s Observer newspaper, Roger Tredre, that he and Domenico Dolce felt that Benitez “embodies the Mediterranean woman,” Gabbana enthused. “Her beauty reminds us of the actresses of the neo-realist Italian cinema, like Anna Magnani.” At the time of the interview, Benitez still spoke just rudimentary English. Benitez went on to work for designers Oscar de la Renta, Valentino, and Rena Lange; she has appeared in ad campaigns for Episode, J. Crew, and Nine West. Her biggest career coup, however, came early in 2001 when she appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated’s annual swimsuit issue. Under the heading “Goddesses of the Mediterranean,” the model’s sultry photo was captioned, “Elsa Benitez Heats Up Tunisia.” The issue—a February tradition—is centered around an immense promotional blitz, and sales ordinarily hit the $50-million mark. Some of the world’s top models had\n\n22 • Contemporary Hispanic Biography • Volume 4\n\nAt a Glance . . .\n\nB\n\norn in 1977, in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico;\n\nmarried Rony Seikaly (a professional athlete),\n\n1999; children: Mila Seikaly.

Launched in 1964 as a way to lure readers during a slow sports-story month, the swimsuit issue grew racier over the years, and the exotic locales of its shoots are usually kept top-secret. “No matter where the magazine drapes its models, though, the issue manages to do one thing no other feature can: it gathers sports fans of every stripe beneath a single umbrella,” noted a Financial Times report. “With the swimsuit issue in hand, no one complains that baseball lacks action, that hockey is too violent, that football is for those too fat or too dumb to play hockey.” Benitez’s career for the rest of the year seemed promising: she became the spokesperson for Budweiser and Bud Light, and also appeared in ads for the Taco Bell fast-food chain and its new stuffed burrito menu item. One television commercial for the product featured a dream sequence of her walking past two men, who are enamored of the burrito she is carrying, not her. “Agency creatives said the Mexican-born Benitez will help the product earn quick recognition with fickle fast-food customers,” wrote Justin M. Norton in ADWEEK Western Edition. A representative of the San Francisco-based advertising agency involved, Tom O’Keefe, told the trade journal that Benitez “is the ideal spokesperson, because she perfectly embodies the essence of the product.”\n\nBenitez appeared again in the 2002 SI swimsuit issue.
