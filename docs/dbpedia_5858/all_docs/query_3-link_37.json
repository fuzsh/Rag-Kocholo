In some cases, where I have determined that a term, phrase, sentence, or full passage is noteworthy (either for its originality, its nuance, or its intertextuality), I have included the original in the body of the text alongside the translation. My hope is that this method, though it may distract some, will allow for substantive engagement with the original materials by both Anglophone and Francophone readers.\n\nxi\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis book begins where so many others conclude: 1804. On January 1, 1804, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, general of the Armée Indigène, proclaimed the independent state of Haiti, marking the triumphant end to thirteen years of revolutionary fighting and over three centuries of colonial rule. The year 1804 also marked the end of the redemptive possibilities of a utopian revolution and the beginning of the fraught project of postcolonial, antislavery statehood.1 Recent scholarship has begun to explore the challenges that Atlantic world powers posed to Haitian sovereignty and legitimacy during the Age of Revolution,2 but there existed an equally important internal challenge to Haiti’s post-independence sovereignty: a civil war between those who envisioned an anticolonial, antislavery empire and those who wished to establish a liberal republic. Yet this post-1804 context of empire and civil war remains shrouded, silenced in North Atlantic scholarship on Haiti in part because of what we desire 1804 to be: a radical, liberal, universal revolution.3 The authoritarian nature of the post-1804 state troubles that narrative from its very first moments, acts, words, and texts. I argue that this civil war context is central to understanding Haiti’s long postcolonial nineteenth century: the foundational political, intellectual, and regional tensions that constitute Haiti’s fundamental plurality.4 Considerable work has been dedicated to unearthing the uneven and unequal production of historical narratives about Haiti in the wake of Michel-Rolph Trouillot’s groundbreaking Silencing the Past, but many more narratives—namely, those produced from within Haitian historiography and literary history—remain to be questioned and deconstructed. In this book, I unearth and continually probe the conceptually generative possibilities of Haiti’s postrevolutionary divisions, something the current historiographic framework on Haiti’s long postcolonial nineteenth century fails to fully apprehend. Through close readings of original print sources (pamphlets, newspapers, literary magazines, ge1\n\n2\n\n| Introduction\n\nographies, histories, poems, and novels), I shed light on the internal realities, tensions, and pluralities that shaped the aftermath of the Haitian Revolution to reveal the process of contestation, mutual definition, and continual (re)inscription of Haiti’s meaning throughout its long nineteenth century. *** We need only consider the persistent slippage in North Atlantic scholarship between 1804 and 1806, between the foundation of an anticolonial, antislavery state and the foundation of a republic, to see the need for such a study. Historians regularly mislabel 1804 as a republican revolution when in fact it ushered in a postcolonial state, then empire.5 Not only that: the secretaries and military leaders behind the textual performance of Haitian independence in the nation’s foundational documents did their best to avoid referring to the events of 1804 as a “revolution” altogether. It was the 1806 assassination of Jean-Jacques Dessalines and overthrow of his empire, orchestrated by a faction of pro-republican military leaders, that cast itself as the true republican revolution. A similar clarification is in order for Haiti’s label as the “first black republic”: the problematic part of this formulation is not “first black,” but “republic.” Haiti was incontestably the first independent anticolonial black state in the hemisphere, but it was also a self-proclaimed empire. Civil war between republicans and Christophean monarchists divided the independent nation from 1807 to 1820, until Haiti finally unified under a republican form of government. Even then, the republic was far from inevitable: for nearly a century it remained embroiled in civil war, secessionist regimes, and the threat—and briefly, reality—of a return to empire. To begin to make sense of the unrelenting obscurity in the naming and meaning of one of the decisive world historical events of Western modernity, we must start at the beginning of the postcolonial state: its civil war, ideological inscriptions, and partisan narrative constructions that were ultimately emplotted into the myth of the inevitable republic after 1820. My exploration of the discursive “making” of the Haitian Republic and its myth(s)—the stories that get told about it and the beliefs that result from them—is in no way intended to dim the project of Haitian independence and the very real material, political, and embodied\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n3\n\ntransformations that the Haitian Revolution brought about. Instead, I take aim at the received notions and teleological narratives that lead us to confound the republicanism of 1806 with the radical anticolonial gesture of 1804, which belonged to a different set of political beliefs. That is: North Atlantic scholars’ conflation of 1804 and 1806 is not a repeated slip-up, but the result of a blind spot created by the myth of the inevitable republic. The problem of 1804/1806, of empire/republic, reveals something profound about the way scholars read, write, and ultimately (mis)understand Haitian history: a failure to account for the foundational tensions at work in the postrevolutionary civil war and their reverberations throughout Haiti’s long nineteenth century. I begin this work by disentangling the multiple meanings of liberté in contestation—and mutual constitution—at work in Haiti’s postindependence civil wars between the nation’s foundational, oppositional ideological factions: republicans and Dessalineans. Through a close reading of the print production of each, I reveal two very different conceptions of Haiti’s place within the progressive universalist claims of the Enlightenment—conceptions in tension that shaped the politics and writing of Haiti’s long nineteenth century. Writing and, indeed, the very meaning of literature were central to the political contests that unfolded between these two factions. Literature and literariness were concepts self-consciously and politically deployed—and resisted—in the guerre de plume, or paper war,6 in post-independence Haiti. Paper itself became the battleground upon which the civil war was waged. While this book destabilizes the monolithic or homogeneous idea of Haiti through a long-view immersion in its archive, the discoveries I unlock in the process have consequences for a much wider set of fields, including Francophone and world literary studies, studies of the postcolonial Global South, and black radical studies. My reading of post-independence Haitian writing reveals key insights into the nature of literature, its relation to freedom and politics, and how fraught and politically loaded the concepts of “literature” and “civilization” really are. The competing ideas of liberté, writing, and civilization at work in postcolonial Haiti have consequences for the way we think about Haiti’s role—as an idea and a discursive interlocutor—in the elaboration of black radicalism and black Atlantic, anticolonial, and decolonial thought. For what could be more transparent than the idea of liberty in\n\n4\n\n| Introduction\n\nthe context of the Haitian Revolution? Yet once we look past the idea of Haiti and embrace its plurality, we begin to grasp the plurality of the seemingly monolithic, self-evident concept of liberté.\n\nThe Many Meanings of Liberty: Dessalinean Critique of Western Episteme In early post-independence Haitian writing, we see two drastically different versions of postcolonial statehood vying for hegemony: possible futures for an abolitionist black state that differed precisely according to their conceptions of liberté. To be sure, the leading political factions of the period—Dessalineans and republicans—agreed that liberté meant freedom from chattel slavery. They nevertheless differed on the meaning of liberté as it related to rights, especially individual rights, and on the best political program for the future postcolonial state. Did liberté mean independence from colonial rule, or did it mean freedom from arbitrary government and the guarantee of individual rights? What differed— indeed, what was fundamentally at odds between the two—were the intellectual and philosophical bases upon which this conception of liberté was constructed and performed. In many ways they were mutually exclusive, constituted in dialogic opposition in the civil war and guerre de plume in the first two decades of independence (1804–1820). These very different conceptions of liberté were crucial to each faction’s self-imagining and self-representation within Haiti and the wider revolutionary Atlantic. Republicans wanted liberté to encompass the meaning associated with political liberalism and Enlightenment universalism. Liberté meant individual rights, political equality, and the active contestation of any arbitrary government (though it often fell short of these ideals in practice). Haitian republicans embraced the revolutionary language of France’s short-lived First Republic, and saw an opportunity to make independent Haiti into the last remaining site of liberal republicanism after it faltered in France. For republicans, humanity—universal equality—was guaranteed by the philosophy of Enlightenment liberalism taken to its most radical, egalitarian conclusion. Conversely, Dessalineans meant liberté primarily as independence from colonial rule and not as a guarantee of individual rights,\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n5\n\nvery much akin to the liberté générale maintained by Toussaint Louverture.7 Dessalines’s state-turned-empire placed anticolonial independence above all else, such that individual liberties had to be sacrificed to the greater cause of sovereign statehood. Dessalineans flexed their radical anticolonialism and actively worked to put that political agenda out into the Atlantic world. Thus, theirs was an antiliberal liberté, in the sense that they directly questioned the utility of political liberalism in their fledgling anticolonial, antislavery state and challenged the putative universalism of the Enlightenment. For Dessalineans, humanity was guaranteed through their own act of self-liberation, wresting it from those who purported to grant it by defining it through their own words, acts, and terms. By insisting on these internal tensions at work in Haiti’s early postindependence intellectual and political project, I aim to add further complexity and precision to the vital question of Haiti’s Enlightenment critique.8 In her superb conception of Black Atlantic humanism, Marlene Daut theorizes a Haitian intellectual project that worked to “disrupt the Enlightenment philosophies that undergirded colonial slavery and colonial racism” by countering the European discourses of black dehumanization that underwrote slavery.9 She casts Haitian independence and the foundational texts that narrated it as a radical assertion of black humanity and a critique of the systems of oppression that underwrote Enlightenment humanism. Crucially, however, I argue that this radical critique was achieved by a faction of Haitian post-independence writers and thinkers—Dessalineans—who elaborated it as much in opposition to the republican faction within Haiti as to the larger Atlantic world. I am insisting that we see a more complex and complicated picture of factionalism and intellectual formation in tension: between a republican faction that performed itself as the purest and most radical instantiation of Enlightenment humanism (colorblind, antislavery, pro-equality) in the Western Hemisphere, and a Dessalinean faction whose members critiqued Enlightenment universalism because they saw it as fundamentally flawed. By foregrounding these internal tensions, I reveal civil war factionalism as generative for the Dessalinean critique of the Western tradition, and of the republican performance of its purest instantiation. That is: the black humanistic tradition that Daut defines was born out of these two strands\n\n6\n\n| Introduction\n\nof Haitian thought—the critique of Western Enlightenment liberalism and the embrace of its most radical possibilities—that were mutually constituted in opposition. What is more, these tensions around Enlightenment thought (the meaning of humanity, civilization, liberty) produced conversation and conflict throughout Haiti’s long nineteenth century, with various intellectual and political factions continuing to evoke, repurpose, and deploy them within a larger set of Atlantic connections. In many ways, my book traces the long postrevolutionary history of what Lyonel Trouillot has termed the “modèle Dessalines”: the continual return by various political regimes and intellectual projects to the radical heritage of Dessalinean critique cut short in 1806.10 My book’s emphasis on the specifically Dessalinean contours of Haiti’s Enlightenment critique has important consequences for the study of black radical political and intellectual thought.11 If, as Anthony Bogues has argued, black radical thought serves as a “counterpoint” to the “progressive universalist claims” of modernity, Dessalinean thought goes a step further.12 As Grégory Pierrot has recently argued, Dessalinean political thought was “a bold attempt at lighting a beacon beyond the confines of white Western thoughts.”13 Dessalinean thought challenged— critiqued—the progressive universalist claims of the Enlightenment in real time, as they were being put into practice in the revolutionary Atlantic. Dessalinean thought instantiated an anticolonial, antislavery state and a people that challenged the Enlightenment’s putatively universal self-framing by positing—and living—alternative epistemologies and ontologies. We find a critical, negative idea of French republican liberty at work in the Dessalinean 1804 Acte de l’indépendance. We see a similar critique of Enlightenment universalism in Article 14 of Dessalines’s 1805 imperial constitution, which proclaimed all Haitians under the general denomination “Noirs.”14 Sibylle Fischer has argued that Article 14 “both asserts egalitarian and universalist intuitions and puts them to a test.”15 By insisting on color, Dessalines’s imperial constitution rejected the notion of color-blind republicanism born, at least in part, out of the fight for equality among lettered, propertied free men of color in Saint-Domingue. We might go further still: Dessalines’s imperial constitution recognized the limits—perhaps even the trap—of Enlightenment universalism for black, unlettered, and unpropertied men in the Atlantic world. This critique was not limited to Dessalines’s short-lived gov-\n\nIntroduction\n\n| 7\n\nernment, but found purchase under those who took up his ideological mantle. This book thus unearths the obscured intellectual tradition that troubles republicanism and the putative universalism of Enlightenment liberalism throughout Haiti’s long nineteenth century. Dessalineans founded an anticolonial, antislavery state, and then an empire, all the while resisting the only other viable anticolonial state formation in the hemisphere: the republic. It nevertheless bears repeating: Dessalineans challenged and resisted Enlightenment universalism not because they were “premodern,” “uncivilized,” or any other teleological term that has been retroactively applied to the imperial state and its aberrance within the liberal order. Dessalineans challenged and critiqued the liberal bourgeois order—political liberalism, republicanism, and Enlightenment humanism—because of its basis in chattel slavery. It was always already flawed: its exclusionary conception of white, European normativity placed clear limits on a black polity. Dessalineans initiated—and embodied—what Anthony Bogues calls the “heresy” of the black radical intellectual: “becoming human” by “overturning white/ European normativity.”16 Following both Daut’s powerful notion of a genealogy of Black Atlantic humanism and Deborah Jenson’s presentation of “Dessalines’s documents” as a “dialogic foundation in a longer chain of radical African diasporan thinkers,” the archive of Dessalinean counterhegemonic texts offers one—though certainly not singular— discursive origin point of radical black thought.17 The textual and discursive practices of vindication and refutation, key aspects of black radical writing, are already instantiated in Dessalinean writing, as we shall see in this book.18 The spirit of Dessalinean critique of Western episteme translated and traveled to contexts outside Haiti, as we can see in the form, style, and rhetoric of many radical black thinkers.19 By placing Dessalinean thought within the context of black radical thought, I aim to clarify the notion that early Haitian intellectual thought “anticipates” or should be seen as “prophetic” of the postmodern condition.20 Dessalinean thought and political action constituted a radical critique that revealed the abstractions upon which Enlightenment thought relied, and how these abstractions denied the forms of oppression the project itself depended upon.21 As a scholar firmly ensconced in a system of valuation and legibility dictated by Western episteme, I have often found myself reaching for Derrida or Butler as a\n\n8\n\n| Introduction\n\nuseful shorthand (and a “valuable,” legible one in the Western academy) to index a praxis and a political project that Haitian writers had already established.22 Dessalinean thought unmasked, deconstructed, and decentered the Western tradition in formation at the turn of the nineteenth century. Indeed, I would argue that this is why the idea of Haiti is so useful and its revolution such a central event for artistic reimagining in black radical thought: as a subject, it carries with it the full weight of its Enlightenment critique. Haiti’s very existence questioned Western episteme: the first Haitian words, the first Haitian acts pointed out the system’s fundamental structural flaws. From the very beginning, Haiti resisted organizing itself according to Western principles.23 Perversely, it is for these same reasons that Haiti is also a near-obsession for nativists and white supremacists throughout the world who instrumentalize Haiti’s “failed state” status as proof of the impossibility of a nonwhite, non-Western black state.24 It is also because of its challenge to Western episteme that radical Dessalinean thought was rendered “unthinkable” in Haitian national history, internally by those Haitians committed to casting the nation within the dominant Western norms of civilization and humanism, and externally by those foreign powers whose own systems of oppression depended upon silencing Haiti’s radical critique of the West. As Bogues argues, black radical intellectual production is unthinkable only insofar as it challenges “the epistemic limits established by the Western intellectual tradition.”25 In the case of the revolution, scholars have overlooked or been unable to assimilate Dessalinean critique precisely because of the extent to which it challenges and refuses Western political modernity.26 In contrast, republicans did not fundamentally change the terms of the debate set out by Enlightenment universalism—they did not refute Western episteme, but rather sought to perform their revolution within the hegemonic terms of Western Enlightenment: individual reason, autonomy, civilization, perfectibility. Thus, the republican elements are “seeable,” thinkable, and able to be recuperated within a Western paradigm. In these terms, we see why scholars and histories have privileged the republican faction, pushing the Dessalinean faction to the margins of history. Dessalineans questioned the terms of the debate set out by Enlightenment universalism, and insisted on a system of thought that could hold both their fundamental blackness and their\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n9\n\nfundamental humanity. This set them upon a different path, working to subvert and deconstruct the dominant Western paradigm with the creation of a black antislavery empire. There is also a logic in this choice of state formation: to serve a majority-illiterate population of former slaves, recalling the traditions of African kingdoms and performative, symbolic public power made a lot of sense.27 The choice made more sense, in many ways, than republicanism, which by 1804 was an embattled ideology in the Atlantic world and would remain so for much of the nineteenth century. But once we recognize and move beyond the limiting, silencing domain of the Western tradition, Haiti’s long nineteenthcentury heritage of Dessalinean critique becomes legible once more. As we shall see in this book, Haitian writers like Emile Nau defined Haitians’ humanity and civilization not by their ability to measure up to Atlantic standards, but by their act of resistance—of reclaiming their human rights through violence against an inherently violent world system. Louis Joseph Janvier returned to Dessalinean critiques to point out the forms of oppression that were always at work in putatively liberal systems, and to define an idea of Haitian civilization that was forged in concert with, in opposition to, and as a constant challenge to the ideals of Enlightenment liberalism. The stakes of what I’m proposing here are high. Let me address them head-on by returning to scholars’ “desire” to see Haiti as a utopian or redemptive republic that I mentioned in my opening gambit. What does it mean to assert that a faction—perhaps a majority—of Haitian intellectual and political thought engages in an antiliberal critique of the Enlightenment? What difficult, thorny questions does this bring up for our own investment in the universal Enlightenment and in Western political modernity? What does it mean to give full due to the discomfiting realities of violent antislavery anticolonialism in Dessalines’s independence, which privileged an imperial government that assured freedom from chattel slavery but eschewed any sense of individual rights? In my work, this has meant confronting the specter of anti-Enlightenment integral nationalism and fascism within Haiti. It raises with it the very real histories of Haitian intellectuals’ alignment with the anti-Enlightenment thought that gained prominence in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in Europe (especially in Francophone spheres of influence), and ultimately, the Duvalier dictatorship, which co-opted the long\n\n10\n\n| Introduction\n\nheritage of Dessalinean critique of Western episteme into the service of a fascist, anti-Enlightenment political regime. Here, I am offering an alternative to what Robert Fatton has labeled Haiti’s “authoritarian habitus” to explain the roots of the Duvalier dictatorship in Haiti.28 In my analysis, there is something much more complex, and indeed tragic, at work in Haiti’s 150 years of political and intellectual history. The tragedy, it seems to me, is how Duvalier co-opted and converted Haiti’s radical Enlightenment critique in the service of his fascist dictatorship. Duvalier marshalled the pathbreaking, radical, brilliant critiques of racism and systems of oppression instantiated in Haiti’s anticolonial independence, and used them to systematically oppress, terrorize, and dehumanize his own people for a generation.\n\nBeyond the Bourgeois Public Sphere The concept of “literature” is equally bound up in the transformations of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries that shaped Haiti’s divergent meanings of liberté. Once we evoke the radical critique of Enlightenment liberalism, we can no longer assume the category of “literature” itself to be static or politically neutral. Raymond Williams has long cautioned us against taking “literature” naïvely at face value. In his woefully underutilized socio-historicization of the concept, Williams reminds us that literature is a “specific sociohistorical development of writing,” a process of development that engages “a powerful and often forbidding system of abstraction, in which the concept of ‘literature’ becomes actively ideological.”29 Prior to the Enlightenment era, the term literature simply denoted “a condition of reading: of being able to read and of having read.”30 During the eighteenth century the concept of “literature” developed from its previous, broader meaning of “literacy,” toward the more specialized—and exclusive—notion of “‘creative’ or ‘imaginative’ works” of quality that were distinct from utilitarian or nonimaginative writing.31 The concept of “criticism” emerged alongside this modern form of “literature” to mean “the conscious exercise of ‘taste,’ ‘sensibility,’ and ‘discrimination.’”32 Writers and actors at the time were making these distinctions and engaging with the emergent concepts of literature and criticism. When we disentangle our contemporary definitions and valuations of the\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n11\n\nconcept of literature and actually historicize it, we see how invested it is in the transformations of the period and the political work it does as a category. My reflection here builds on recent scholarship that directly addresses this question of literature and authorship in early Haitian writing, particularly Chris Bongie’s vital critique of Francophone postcolonial literary criticism.33 Yet where previous scholars have endeavored to recuperate early Haitian writing as literary, my work makes no such claims.34 Instead, I prefer to point out the problem with this kind of “question” in the first place, which is bound up in the practice of literary criticism and the bourgeois public sphere.35 Put otherwise, if cultural studies theory has come to terms with the limits and possibilities of Jürgen Habermas’s bourgeois conception of the public sphere, the notion of an all-encompassing rational, “modern,” yet narrowly defined bourgeois public sphere nevertheless remains unchecked and unmarked in our literary critical praxis. Let me first rehearse briefly Habermas’s arguments about the structural transformations of the public sphere and bourgeois society before engaging some recent debates in world literature and hermeneutics that reveal the limits of the Habermasian modern literary paradigm.36 Habermas establishes the putative rupture between “premodern” (pre-Enlightenment) and “modern” (post-eighteenth-century) practices of textual production and consumption. The Enlightenment-era emergence of a bourgeois public sphere broke with what he deemed the “monarchical” and “feudal” (but also religious) practices of textual production and hermeneutics based in performance, memorization, recitation, symbolic representation, and the mystique of authority.37 The emergence of a literary public sphere, based in individual reason, judgment, critical reflection, and debate between private citizens, made possible the emergence of a political public sphere. Habermas’s autonomous subject exercised private reason, critique, and judgment with other such private individuals to make meaning and create a shared opinion, which led to the self-reflection of an individual’s role in society and the emergence of rationally constituted public opinion that challenged the authority of the state. Critical interrogations of Habermas’s concept of the public sphere have long insisted on the exclusions of this white, male, propertied sphere as well as the myth of its singularity.38 Despite the nonbourgeois\n\n12\n\n| Introduction\n\n“alternative” counterpublics that various post-Habermasian critics have highlighted, few, if any, have attended to counterpublics that reject the liberal, putatively modern practices of textual production and hermeneutics that Habermas establishes as dominant.39 Here, we can look to some recent critical engagements with world literature and hermeneutics questioning this narrow conceptualization of reading and writing practices that obscures many other uses of texts.40 Specialists in nonWestern literatures reveal the degree to which “literature” as concept is never neutral, casting in its shadow “textual forms and modes of experience no longer thinkable in a modern literary paradigm.”41 From this perspective, what Pascale Casanova has identified as the “world republic of letters” begins to look quite reductive for its privileging of a bourgeois, liberal conception of secular, autonomous, reasoned critical reading practices to the exclusion of many other kinds of texts and readings. If indeed the practice of literary criticism and bourgeois liberal modernity are mutually constitutive, then these scholars’ call for alternative hermeneutics is especially urgent. Put in these terms, we begin to see the problem of applying Williams’s “abstract retrospective concept” of literature, devoid of its context or its ideological content, to early post-independence Haitian writing that emerged precisely during the period in which literature, liberalism, and even liberty itself were highly contested and debated terms within postindependence Haiti. Building on these post-Habermasian critiques, I am interested here in the way that a faction of Haiti’s print sphere was elaborated precisely in critique and refusal of the bourgeois literary public sphere and its “modern” praxis of textual production and hermeneutics. That is, I am working against the notion of some Habermasian rupture that accompanied Haiti’s revolution in the practice and politics of writing (from a putatively “premodern” symbolic or performative writing to a putatively “modern,” rational, liberal, autonomous notion of textual creation and hermeneutics). Quite the opposite: these conceptions and uses of writing remained hotly contested in both civil war and paper war between a republican, bourgeois faction (which touted individual reason, private subjectivity, and communicative rationality) and a monarchical state that relied upon symbolic representation, public performance, collective textual production, and the mystique of authority to define its political project within Haiti and the larger Atlantic sphere.\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n13\n\nLet us see the bourgeois public sphere and its limits at work in early post-independence Haitian writing. In colonial Saint-Domingue, free men of color enjoyed some access to the emergent spaces of private deliberation and critical discourse in the early part of the eighteenth century, and then were excluded as the colonial state worked to create a unified white colonial public in the 1760s and 1770s.42 It was precisely because of these race-based exclusionary tactics that free men of color in the colony led the fight for equality during the early years of the French Revolution. In many ways, they constituted the Habermasian bourgeois public sphere in the colony par excellence: they engaged in reasoned, critical debate of the colonial state and its exclusionary policies, and were foundational to the emergence of public opinion for the equality of men of color as citizens of the republic. As we shall see in this book, post-independence Haitian republican writing constituted itself very much in the heritage of this bourgeois public sphere, writing within a nascent Francophone lettered sphere and performing the fruits of liberal republicanism to a wider Atlantic audience. While this Habermasian bourgeois public sphere continued among a certain political faction in early post-independence Haiti, it was not the only sphere to emerge during the period. There was a sphere of writing, print, and critique that emerged in early post-independence Haiti that was highly critical of political liberalism and the bourgeois liberal order. We might call this the “Dessalinean sphere,” which dominated late-revolutionary Haiti and the first years of independence. Dessalinean and later Christophean writing was first and foremost a weapon of antislavery, anticolonial resistance. It was writing based on utility and defense: the performance of violent anticolonialism or the refutation of pro-colonial discourse from France through the publication of written texts. The print production in this sphere was decidedly antiliberal and antibourgeois: it was not the private, autonomous, liberal bourgeois reason that existed apart from the state, but a collective, collaborative textual production from a militarized secretarial corps that swore an oath to defend the monarchy. Indeed, the Dessalinean sphere embraced—and performed—many of the practices that Habermas considered “premodern”: public symbolic representation, the mystique of power, memorization and recitation, all in service of the state. Crucially, Dessalinean textual production and consumption encompassed decidedly more\n\n14\n\n| Introduction\n\nHaitian voices outside the narrow, property-owning, literate, educated sphere of the republicans. As we shall see in this book, Dessalinean and Christophean spheres insisted on the public practice of textual creation and performance and gave voice to those who otherwise lacked the “right” or the ability to enter into print: insurgent slaves, illiterate or uneducated free men of color, and even the dead. Having demonstrated the overdetermined, abstract retrospective concept of “literature,” I would like to describe my approach to generic, formal, and discursive structures that coded the Dessalinean and later Christophean sphere—beyond the bourgeois public sphere. I am basing my approach on a few basic assumptions. First, I assume that the process of writing is always citational and intertextual; it draws upon already existing language and structures in a process of citation and iteration that is never new. I thereby distance my approach from the either/or proposition of radical newness or colonial borrowing, derivativeness or “imitation” (which are bound up in anachronistic judgments of value that have much less to do with the textual production of the period itself) and move toward a more thorough accounting of the norms, practices, and mechanisms of print culture in early post-independence Haiti. Second, I approach published writing (that is, writing that actively sought a public) as determined by a set of implicit and sometimes explicit codes, language, syntax, and forms that determine a text’s legibility and meaning in a given time.43 This involves a considerable amount of modeling, adapting, and (re)iterating existing genres, forms, and language.44 What is more, the Haitian writing of independence was produced literally on the ground, often in the fog of war, by men (alas, no women!) with varying degrees of French-language schooling and in an entirely multilingual context: French, Kreyòl, which was the lingua franca, and Niger-Congo languages among the insurgent slaves. Dessalines’s 1804 Acte de l’indépendance provides a prime example of these codes and structures. While the radical, anticolonial gesture of 1804 was performed by other means and in other mediums (the symbolic naming of “Ayti,” the burning of plantations, and the massacre of the remaining French colons on the island), Haitians nevertheless instantiated their radical newness in the French language, in the textual act of a declaration of independence. They wrote in French to render legible— and legitimate—their radical claims to statehood and independence in\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n15\n\nan Atlantic public sphere hell-bent on not recognizing those claims. It is both radically new and entirely the same, through a process of modeling, adaptation, and iteration. Finally, my approach to early post-independence writing emphasizes the performativity at work in the production of text, and more specifically the performative speech acts by which formerly colonial subjects and the enslaved seized the means to (re)define themselves as human, independent, postcolonial, black writing and publishing subjects.45 I understand this form of performativity in early post-independence Haitian writing as related to a specific generic form: printed polemics, or pamphlets. The form and practice of polemical pamphleteering are central to questions of legitimacy, subjectivity, authority, authorship, and authorization; pamphlets were consecratory speech acts that created space for legitimatizing speech that was not otherwise “legally” granted to them. As Katie LaPorta’s research on early modern anti-absolutist pamphlets shows, writers contested authority and staked a claim to the public sphere even as they lacked the “right” to do so, and deployed the written word against established power in order to forge new subjectivities and construct new publics.46 Thus the notion of performativity we see theorized in Derrida’s “performative speech acts” and Butler’s “political performativity” is, as LaPorta points out, endogenous to the early modern sphere of political pamphleteering—despite the fact that we assume it to be a contemporary theoretical term.47 I would argue that we can trace Dessalinean and Christophean performative pamphleteering, as well as Faustin Soulouque’s later use of portraiture, to a longer tradition of reformist and anti-absolutist pamphlet writing of the early modern period. Indeed, we must consider their claims to sovereignty, legitimacy, and humanity via the pamphlet form as part of a longer early modern context of challenging absolutist and statist discourses and claiming authority and subjectivity. In the spirit of sixteenth-century Protestant Monarchomach pamphlets, seventeenthcentury anti-absolutist “bad books” (mauvais livres), and eighteenthcentury pasquinades and libelles, Dessalinean and Christophean writing challenged the legitimacy of colonialist and pro-slavery discourses by performing its own authority in print. What is more, its activation of this polemical form repairs—and renders moot—Habermas’s putative rupture between “premodern” and “modern” writing. To be sure, I con-\n\n16\n\n| Introduction\n\nsider performativity across the civil war divide, and reveal the extent to which bourgeois liberal texts in Haiti’s southern republic were themselves performing a political project to an Atlantic world audience. Their new literary and political journals (revues) were performing their own political liberalism, individual reason, and private and autonomous subjectivity in opposition to what they deemed the premodern, politically complicit texts of Dessalinean and Christophean monarchism.\n\nCivil War and the Myth(s) of the Republic My interest in the myth of Haitian republicanism is grounded in deeper reflections on the French republican myth and its paradoxes.48 I have found Jean-Clément Martin’s historiographic method in his work on revolution and counterrevolution in France of particular use. Martin works against the teleology of republicanism, or “against historiographic memory,” by focusing on the internal tensions and specifically the “semantic struggles” of different factions vying for discursive hegemony in the revolutionary period. Ultimately, Martin argues that revolution and counterrevolution must be considered mutually constitutive: fed by their “shared source” and exacerbated by their rivalry against one another, they participated in the cultural and political process that created the nation.49 David Armitage’s recent shift in thinking about civil war in the Age of Revolution offers additional clarity on new methodologies beyond revolution. Armitage shows how civil war is “paradoxically fertile”: highly destructive but also “conceptually generative,” a process that polarizes groups as they seek to define and claim legitimacy over concepts of freedom, authority, or sovereignty, which themselves become sites of “ferocious contestation.”50 I adapt Martin and Armitage’s approach to trouble the republican teleology at work in the historiographic memory of Haiti’s early post-independence history, focusing on the ideologies in tension during the Haitian civil war and their mutually constitutive role in creating the Haitian nation. Through close readings of fiction and nonfiction texts, I endeavor to emphasize the narrative constructions and discursive “making” at work in the production of Haitian history from within, while recognizing the stakes these local histories had for the larger Atlantic story that would be told. Republican historiography sought to nationalize\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n17\n\nthe republican narrative of the revolution, papering over the imperial and military authoritarian nature of Haiti’s revolutionary foundation. Such writing has shaped the way that scholars, both within and outside Haiti, have conceptualized the goals of the Haitian Revolution and the agendas at play in the post-independence civil war. While I performed considerable archival research and work with original sources, readers will note that I privilege one work of Haitian historiography: Thomas Madiou’s eight-volume Histoire d’Haïti (1847– 1848; 1989).51 Simply put, for want of a chronological guide to the events of the revolution and early post-independence period, I determined Madiou’s history to be more neutral than the other possibilities in early Haitian historiography: Baron de Vastey, Hérard Dumesle, Beaubrun Ardouin, and Joseph Saint-Rémy.52 Ardouin in particular is highly ideological in his account of the early post-independence civil war, despite his reliance on a greater amount of archival and documentary evidence. Of particular importance for me is Madiou’s method, which relied on oral testimonies from revolutionaries and insurgent slaves who had lived through the early post-independence civil war. Here, I follow Colin Dayan’s incisive assessment of Madiou’s utility: “Madiou’s interest in preserving the stories told by those who had not been educated in French, who did not share in the mastery of the text, results in those contradictions for which he has been condemned, but which help us to get closer to a history shot through with ambiguity.”53 In order to foreground regional factionalism and civil war in Haiti, I privilege locally produced Haitian texts, which maintain the regional detail, the internal tensions, and the complexities of civil war that tend to get flattened by Atlantic world scholarship.54 I draw specifically on printed matter (including visual culture) published on the ground, by Haitian presses, which I argue offers access to a discursive self-fashioning and performance of statehood that are less mediated than writing published in Paris or other capitals of the world republic of letters.55 My focus on marginal writers and less-studied texts is not, however, an attempt to redeem forgotten heroes or write a redemptive counternarrative. This book has no heroes, to borrow a phrase from Michel-Rolph Trouillot.56 Rather, I am recovering marginalized texts in order to explain precisely why they have been overlooked in historiography and literary histories of Haiti. They are texts that are marginal and illegible\n\n18\n\n| Introduction\n\nto the world republic of letters because they actively wrote against the dominant, normative concepts of “civilization” and “literature.”57 While my corpus of locally produced Haitian print culture reveals the discursively bounded debates about the meaning of liberty between Dessalineans and republicans, these textual debates must be seen in contrast to the embodied practice of liberté that a multitude of other Haitian political factions fought for.58 My corpus reveals much about the competing ideas for how best to self-fashion post-independence Haitian politics, identity, and culture, but cannot give voice to those factions that did not engage in (or have access to) the same self-representative print practices. The northern insurgent slaves who rallied around Sans Souci and Macaya, or the former slaves in the Grand Doco mountains led by Goman (Jean-Baptiste Perrier), produced little in the way of print and are therefore only briefly accounted for in my book. Moreover, nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Haitian print was controlled by literate men and those illiterate men who had the power to command them. Many other ideological camps operated throughout Haiti’s long nineteenth century while existing between the lines of print—namely, the peasantry and women.59 Finally, I take plurality as a guiding principle to unlock deeper discoveries about Haitian agency and political ideology in postcolonial Haiti. In order to reach a more capacious and inclusive understanding of Haiti in all of its iterations, I embraced a specific understanding of “regionalism” that stands apart from its customary use in Caribbean studies. Because Caribbean populations have been defined, since their inception, in relation to a European metropole, their “marginal” status makes them always already “regional” in the larger Euro-Atlantic context. The Caribbean as marginal to the metropole thus masks or obscures the complex realities within this vast, diverse “region.” How, then, to address the local realities of connections, circulations, and (im)mobilities within and across national, linguistic, and geographic boundaries, on the margins of the margin, as it were?60 My new regionalism allows us to acknowledge—and disabuse ourselves of—the tendency to allow Caribbean capital port cities to stand in for the entirety of the island nation. In the case of Haiti, it was only really in the mid-twentieth century that the capital city became the Republic of Port-au-Prince (Repiblik Pòtoprens): a highly centralized state bureaucratic machine that reached its comple-\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n19\n\ntion under the Duvalier dictatorship.61 By privileging the diversity and plurality of Haiti’s regional existence, my work provides a more fulsome accounting of the rich history of Haiti’s long nineteenth century and its writing from the margins of the world republic of letters. Indeed, the foundational regional tensions in early post-independence Haiti are central to understanding the continued civil war, secessionist regimes, and regional conflicts that persisted in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Haiti, and even to the present day. More important for our purposes here, the revolutionary and post-independence civil wars provide crucial context for making sense of the battles over national identity and cultural legitimacy that have marked Haitian writing since independence. For, while I place great importance on the historical and political context here, my book is ultimately about writing, how it became the primary battleground upon which the internal conflict and guerres de plume were waged, and the heritage of these regional and ideological tensions in Haiti’s long nineteenth century, the Duvalier dictatorship, and even today. Through a sustained synchronic and diachronic engagement with the plurality of Haiti’s textual existence since 1804, we grasp the internal battle over the nature of freedom, civilization, and the meaning of literature that fundamentally shaped Haiti from its founding to our present day.\n\n1\n\nDessalines’s Empire of Liberty Il faut par un dernier acte d’autorité nationale, assurer à jamais l’empire de la liberté dans le pays qui nous a vu[s] naître; il faut ravir au gouvernement inhumain qui tient depuis long-tems nos esprits dans la torpeur la plus humiliante, tout espoir de nous réasservir; il faut enfin vivre independans ou mourir. (We must, in one final act of national authority, forever ensure the supremacy of liberty in the country where we were born; we must take away all hope of reenslaving us from the dehumanizing government that has kept our minds in the most humiliating torpor; we must, at last, live free or die.) —Acte de l’indépendance\n\nThe Haitian Republic was not founded in 1804. In fact, the secretaries and military leaders behind the textual performance of Haitian independence did their best to avoid referring to the events of 1804 as a “revolution” or the state a “republic” in the nation’s foundational documents.1 The first declaration of independence, proclaimed on November 29, 1803, by Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Henry Christophe, and Augustin Clerveaux, notably refers to “disturbances” (désordres), “excesses” (excès), “turbulent times” (temps orageux), and a “terrible war” (guerre affreuse), but avoids calling the proclamation of Haitians’ humanity, rights, and anticolonial independence a révolution. Although contemporary American English translations of the November 29 declaration do use the term “revolution,” within Haiti it was not until 1810, under Christophe, that writers would consistently begin to refer to the events of 1791–1804 as a revolution: “the birth of our revolution,” “our immortal revolution,” “the phases of the revolution,” “the tormented revolutionar21\n\n22\n\n| Dessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\nies,” and so on.2 Further still, Dessalines’s January 1, 1804, declaration encouraged Haitian citizens and countrymen not to export the events of Haitian independence to neighboring colonies in the Caribbean. He uses the term “revolution” only to refer to what independent Haitians should not be—revolutionary incendiaries or firebrands (boutes-feu): “Let us not, as revolutionary firebrands, declare ourselves the lawmakers of the Caribbean and let our glory consist in troubling the peace of our neighboring islands.”3 The orchestrators of the 1806 overthrow and assassination of Dessalines, on the other hand, billed their actions explicitly as a republican revolution. The republican opposition selfconsciously deemed themselves “révolutionnaires” engaged in a Haitian campaign “against tyranny” (contre la tyrannie)—inscribing their liberal revolution in the heritage of 1789 and even casting Haiti as the lone remaining instantiation of the values of Enlightenment liberalism and republicanism that metropolitan France had failed to secure. If 1804 often gets confused for the 1806 foundation of a republican state, it is worth considering the aftermath of Haiti’s radical anticolonial gesture in further detail. What happened in the first years after Haitian independence? As we shall see, the early post-independence period is marked not by national or political unity, but rather by tension between those who wanted a republic and those who wanted a military authoritarian state, and by many other actors outside the print public sphere who envisioned other iterations of post-independence Haiti. This simple fact, all too often overlooked in scholarship, raises a number of questions. How and why did newly independent Haitians become divided between supporters of Dessalines’s authoritarian state and the republican opposition? How did this foundational tension shape the Empire of Hayti and the 1805 imperial constitution? Why did men like Juste Chanlatte and Louis Félix Mathurin Boisrond Tonnerre rally around Dessalines? Why did they want to proclaim an empire? And finally, how did these early divisions spill into the 1807–1820 civil war between North and South?4 To begin to answer these questions, we must first understand the political and rhetorical strategies that defined Dessalineanism. Dessalineans believed that the best—perhaps the only—way to secure freedom from slavery and independence from French colonial rule was through violence: the performance of violence in written and spoken rhetoric,\n\nDessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\n|\n\n23\n\nand the act of violence in the sanctioned massacre of French colonists from February to April 1804. These writers, thinkers, and military men embodied the principle of Haitian independence: their freedom was conditioned on the negation of French colonial power, accomplished via the same weapons the French had wielded against them; they were, in Thomas Madiou’s words, “barbarians against colonial barbarity.”5 Thus, Dessalineans did not just reverse “the terms of the colonialist binary of civilization and savagery,” they engaged in a radical, violent anticolonialism—a zero-sum game whose ultimate aim was to annihilate the very premise that the wayward island could be retaken.6 In addition to battling an external enemy—France and other European colonial powers—Dessalineans also constantly negotiated an internal threat: the republic. While we are not yet witnessing the full-blown civil war guerre de plume that we will see in later chapters, this early period offers an important prelude to later divisions. I am aware that this is not the way we are used to thinking about early post-independence Haiti. Yet what I want to suggest here is that our assumptions about this period—namely, of an internal unity set against the threat of an inhospitable, external Atlantic sphere—have made it difficult for us to see the political fault lines that fractured early postindependence writing.7 What I am suggesting here is that the political and ideological divisions that shaped Haiti’s long nineteenth century of post-independence writing were already present in the 1804–1806 period, which, I will argue, was marked by a constant internal tension between Dessalineans and republicans,8 with each group vying to define the post-independence future of Haiti according to its own ideology and political agency, which performed for the dominant Atlantic world powers in starkly different ways. Although the various factions in revolutionary Saint-Domingue united in the war for independence under the banner of Dessalines’s Armée Indigène, as soon as the war was over, the newly independent state of Haiti divided again along the same lines of disagreements, antagonisms, and suspicions that were present during the revolutionary period. The republicans were primarily former Rigaudins from the South who had fought against Toussaint in the War of Knives, among them Alexandre Pétion, Nicolas Geffrard, Laurent Férou, Jean-Louis François, Elie Gérin, Guy Joseph Bonnet, Bruno Blanchet, David Troy, Yayou, and Guillaume\n\n24\n\n| Dessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\nVaval. According to Thomas Madiou, the republicans (or “constitutionalistes,” as he refers to them) were especially concerned with the title of “gouverneur-général” assigned to Dessalines and the murmurings of monarchy, fearing that they were participating in a process of “legalizing despotism.”9 They expected Dessalines’s title to be changed once the new government was structured, preferring that he be named president accompanied by a democratic constitution. Among the Dessalineans, the important work of organizing the new state was undertaken by Louis Félix Mathurin Boisrond Tonnerre, Louis Laurent Bazelais, JeanJ. Dominique Diaquoi (Diaquoi Aîné), and Carbonne; Juste Chanlatte served as “secrétaire générale du gouvernement,” alongside secretaries Alexis Dupuy, Carbonne, and Jean-Jacques Charéron, who with Diaquoi Aîné made up the emperor’s “counseil privé.”10 Other leading Dessalineans included Joseph Balthazar Inginac, François Capois (Cappoix), Corneille Brelle, and later Etienne Victor Mentor and Charles Victor Rouanez. According to Madiou, the Dessalineans were less concerned with the form the government took, so long as Dessalines remained leader: “It mattered little that the head of state call himself king, emperor, or president.”11 This chapter traces the print culture of the immediate postindependence period leading up to Dessalines’s assassination on October 17, 1806, recasting Haiti’s earliest post-independence writing within the context of political and ideological divisions that shaped the period. Dessalines’s empire of liberty was a military government with a single powerful executive, committed to order, discipline, and duty as the only way to ensure lasting independence from French colonial rule. Under Dessalineanism, individual rights and liberties had to be sacrificed to the greater cause of sovereign statehood. The republicans disagreed: they sought to found a state according to liberal Enlightenment ideals, embracing the revolutionary language of individual liberties and radical democracy that characterized France’s short-lived First Republic. They wanted to talk about virtue, talents, the rights of man, laws and a constitution, citizens and sharing of power, but were overpowered by the Dessalinean faction—until 1806, when they would revolt against the “tyrannie” of Dessalines’s arbitrary rule and found the southern republic. I begin by focusing on how Dessalineans consolidated and codified Haitian anticolonial independence through writing, which asserted itself\n\nDessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\n| 25\n\nexternally as an anticolonial weapon and internally as a force of unity against the enemy within. Next, we consider the republican opposition’s mobilization of the language, ideals, and symbolism of French republicanism to overthrow Dessalines’s empire and their subsequent disavowal of this foundational act of parricide-regicide.\n\nDessalinean Writing: Une Arme Anticoloniale Kreyòl pale, kreyòl konprann. —Haitian proverb\n\nDessalines formed the intellectual core of his empire by bringing writers, intellectuals, and generals together in a secretarial corps—a key branch of his Armée Indigène. He began assembling his secretarial corps in the summer of 1803, when it became clear that the French were likely to lose the war.12 While Dessalines had not wanted for soldiers, he needed men of letters to transition to an independent state that was legible—and legitimate—in a wider Atlantic sphere. There were many fewer men of letters in the country; most had left during the revolutionary tumult of the 1790s. Dessalines thus began methodically recruiting talented writers and thinkers into his service. The corps was a heterogeneous group: from North and South, of black and mixed-race parentage, from the army and from planting backgrounds, of wealthy and modest means. He started by courting Boisrond Tonnerre, a native of Les Cayes from a wealthy and well-connected planting family, who had spent time in France during the revolution before returning to the colony.13 Boisrond Tonnerre was working as a secretary to the commander of the South, Nicolas Geffrard, when Dessalines selected him to be part of his growing “secretariat” in July 1803.14 Dessalines soon extended his reach outside revolutionary Saint-Domingue to find lettered men to join his cause, most notably Juste Chanlatte and Etienne Mentor. Both Chanlatte and Mentor had been living outside Saint-Domingue during the revolutionary tumult and made plans to return in 1803 to join Dessalines. Mentor had been in France since 1797, having accompanied the French commissioner Sonthonax into exile after Toussaint expelled him.15 Yet news of the success of the Armée Indigène drew him back to the island, much as it did for Chanlatte.16\n\n26\n\n| Dessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\nIt is important to note here that while Chanlatte and Mentor answered Dessalines’s call, many other exiled Saint-Dominguans did not. The most staunch Rigaudins, supporters of French republican rule in the colony, remained in exile in France or joined revolutionary movements in neighboring Caribbean territories before finally returning to the island in 1815–1816 (see chapter 3). Dessalines’s focus on amassing an army of secretaries and lettered men over the course of 1803 and 1804 reveals the importance of discourse and the printed word to the Dessalinean independence project. Writing was a weapon of anticolonial independence. Just as Dessalines brought together his fiercest, most trusted generals to secure and preserve Haitian independence, he assembled a secretarial corps to wage that battle on the discursive front. And just as he armed his soldiers with weapons to disassemble the mechanisms of the colonial machine, he armed his secretaries with rhetoric and printing presses.17 Indeed, Dessalines’s secretarial corps collaborated with military leaders in support of their common goal. Deborah Jenson has pointed to the process of “technological and lettristic partnering” in early post-independence writing between military leaders and secretaries, involving “dictation, discussion, and editing and refinement of the product,” which was common practice among print publics throughout Europe and North America.18 I would add further that this collaborative, collective nature of textual practice extended to the secretarial corps itself: its members shared text, language, and talking points to create a fascinating discursive, citational network that we can trace through all of the documentation from the period. Collectively, they established the lines of argumentation, key phrases, and tone of the text. In this sense, I am not considering Dessalines’s role within postindependence writing as “author” but rather as general: he was in charge, he chose the strategy (in conversation with his trusted counselors), and he gave orders—in Kreyòl—to be executed by his generals and his secretarial corps.19 I want to stress that I am not eschewing concepts of authorship or literature because I think Dessalinean writing is unworthy of such denominations. On the contrary, Dessalinean writing is brilliant, complex, and innovative. Rather, I am attending to precisely what this writing intended to do: to perform Haiti’s anticolonialism legibly in an Atlantic world. As Jenson rightly puts it, Dessalinean writing formulated\n\nDessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\n| 27\n\n“an anticolonial poetics in the service of the representation of former slaves’ experience and subjective claims, leading to or protecting the establishment of their subversive dominance over colonial authority.”20 As I argued in the introduction, the mechanism through which Dessalineans achieved this anticolonialism is radically new in the colonial context. At the same time, Dessalinean writing draws upon the strategies of vindicationism and refutation—at work in the French print sphere as early as the sixteenth century and widespread in eighteenth-century revolutionary pamphlets—in order to displace and destabilize the authority of French colonial discourse through reiterative speech acts. Dessalinean writing relied upon taking existing language and generic forms from the former colonizer, and making them its own through a process of citation, iteration, and ultimately, deconstruction.21 The point of entry into Dessalinean anticolonial writing is the January 1, 1804, Acte de l’indépendance: a three-part text that includes Dessalines’s proclamation of independence, the act and oath of independence, and the official nomination of Dessalines as “Gouverneur-Général, à vie, d’Hayti.”22 Therein, we find all of the ideas, metaphors, and vocabulary that furnish early Dessalinean writing: the importance placed on language; the need for violence to expiate the horrors of French colonialism and protect Haitian independence (that is, antislavery liberté); and the danger of the enemy within. First and foremost, we note the centrality of discourse and the power of the word to the performance of anticolonial independence. As the Acte makes clear, words matter. It was not merely force of arms that kept the enslaved from achieving independence, but the deceptive words of France’s colonial agents: the enslaved had been “victims of our own gullibility and our own leniency for fourteen years; vanquished not by French forces, but by the deceptive eloquence [pipeuse éloquence] of their agents’ proclamations.”23 The deceptive, dishonest, or misleading eloquence with which the French colonists and administrators—like Pierre Victor Malouet—wrote in defense of slavery and the colonial system was designed to obscure the inhumane, barbaric treatment of the enslaved.24 I insist here on the meaning of the French pipeuse (deceptive, dishonest, misleading) because recent scholars have assumed that the term is a misprint or misreading of the more common piteuse (sad, pitiful). Such an assumption fails to account for the power and significance of\n\n28\n\n| Dessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\nthe term pipeuse and the Dessalinean strategy it deploys: to portray European colonial discourse as masking truth, veiling insidious motives, and covering with flowers the abyss of slavery25—in short, to call out Western civilization for its hypocrisy. I would like to expound briefly here on the problem of the assumption of “misprinting,” which fails to see the radical critique at work in Dessalines’s original text.26 Or rather, it is because of the assumption that Dessalinean language was operating squarely within Western episteme that scholars have assumed that the word was a misprint or a mistake. Critics assume that Dessalinean writers were trying to embarrass or heckle French colonists by making literary judgments on the quality of French writers’ eloquence: it was bad eloquence, pitiful, sad, not worthy. This takes us back to my discussion in the introduction of the anachronistic assignment of the bourgeois liberal codes of “literariness” (taste, finely wrought style) to the period, when indeed Dessalinean writing was actively resisting these codes. When we recognize that Dessalinean writers were operating in a different sphere, the critical assumption of misprinting appears quite problematic. Critics are literally imposing a bourgeois literary hermeneutic back onto a Dessalinean text that was actively challenging it. The assumption of a misprint becomes even more tenuous when we consider that the second letter p in pipeuse is clearly printed in each version of the document and that the term itself was in common usage in the eighteenth century. If we take my proposition that Dessalinean writing was a weapon of anticolonial independence, then Dessalinean secretaries and printers treated it as a priceless resource—as they would the arms and gunpowder that they used to fight the enemy.27 What is more, by putting this term into its rightful context—the Dessalinean sphere—we see a much clearer strategy at work, and its lasting heritage in Haitian discourse throughout the long nineteenth century to our present day. The Dessalinean denunciation of “pipeuse éloquence” is at the origin of the proverb “Kreyòl pale, Kreyòl konprann,” which is translated literally as “Kreyòl spoken, Kreyòl understood” but is used to indicate honesty and candor: “Speak plainly and do not deceive” or “Speak honestly and be understood.” If the deceptive treachery of French colonial discourse—French words—had the power to enslave and dehumanize the inhabitants of Saint-Domingue, then Dessalinean writing deployed French words to\n\nDessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\n|\n\n29\n\nequally powerful ends. Dessalinean writers sharpened, wielded, and deployed discourse to claim their own freedom by force in the Atlantic print public sphere. Dessalinean writing is a way for independent subjects to fight back and correct their own naïveté (“victims of their own credulity”)—an inward-looking focus that sought to rally Haitians by placing their fate in their own hands.28 In order to neutralize France’s colonial discourse and to protect against European nations’ desire for dominance over other human beings, Dessalineans argued that it was not sufficient merely to expel the French colonial army from Haiti’s shores. The Dessalinean rhetoric of Haitian independence sought to render Haiti un-colonizable by “stealing” or “robbing” (ravir à) France of the idea, the hope, that it could ever resubjugate the Haitian people, as cited in the epigraph at the beginning of the chapter (il faut ravir au gouvernement inhumain).29 The only way to achieve this goal, to become human subjects of their own, was to strike fear into the French and other nations through an act of violent, blood-filled vengeance: “Know that you will have accomplished nothing if you do not show the nations a fearsome, but just, example of the vengeance that a people, proud of having regained their liberty and intent upon maintaining it, must exercise; let us terrify all those who would dare try to steal [ravir] it away from us again.”30 The repetition of “ravir” here is quintessentially Dessalinean writing: highly constructed, but also playing with language. Haiti’s foundational national act is to steal away the idea of reenslaving Haitians, and to strike fear into any country that might try to “steal” Haiti’s just, legitimate independence.31 In this sense, I see Dessalines’s foundational act of anticolonial vengeance—the massacre of French planters and soldiers—and his strategy of discursive or rhetorical violence that I have been sifting out here as different implementations of the same strategy, one of Haiti’s “first acts of sovereignty.”32 It was a multi-front political strategy to maintain antislavery, anticolonial independence at all costs. Moreover, the memory of French imperial violence remained fresh: Leclerc’s expeditionary forces had engaged in spectacular violence during the War of Independence, and the general had even called for the extermination of all black men, women, and children over the age of twelve in the colony.33 Further, David Geggus has pointed out that the massacre of the former colonists was understood as a message to Haiti’s would-be foes: “A ‘terrible but just’ act of retribution would\n\n30\n\n| Dessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\nsend a message to France and the outside world that the Haitians would not surrender the freedom they had won.”34 Dessalinean writing was thus an anticolonial weapon on two levels: a discursive sabre rattling to keep France and other would-be colonizers at bay, and a disarming or defusing of textual weaponry the French might use in retaking the island. Haiti’s act of anticolonial vengeance is written into the foundational documents of independence. The act of stealing away the idea of reenslavement through violence (the massacre of the French) and terror (the fear of violence) is a necessary precondition to the creation of an “empire of liberty” in Haiti. Though the Empire of Haiti would not be proclaimed until many months later (as I discuss below), it is worth considering briefly here Dessalines’s use of the phrase “empire of liberty” (empire de la liberté) in the foundational document of Haitian independence. First, though the phrasing might seem like the soldering together of two seemingly discordant concepts—empire and freedom— Dessalines defined liberté as antislavery independence from colonial rule and not the guarantee of individual rights. Indeed, as I translated it in the epigraph above, the phrase “empire de la liberté” in the Acte de l’indépendance does not refer to a specific government form, but rather ensures the supremacy of freedom—from chattel slavery and from colonial rule (l’empire de la liberté dans le pays qui nous a vu[s] naître). Dessalines’s anticolonial, antislavery state was just that: an independent authority that ensured Haiti’s control of its own liberty, independence from colonial rule, and eternal freedom from chattel slavery through the act of vengeance/self-liberation. Second, I believe that there is a good argument to be made for Dessalines’s use of the phrase as an iteration and adaptation of Thomas Jefferson’s earlier use of the phrase “empire of liberty” (as early as 1779) in his republican, expansionist project to create new liberal subjects and spaces of liberty.35 Scholars of Jefferson argue that he used the phrase in order to create a productive tension between the two terms of the comparison: the unlikely joining of the idea of imperium with the idea of individual liberties that the republican leader valued above all else. Dessalines’s “empire of liberty” understood imperium as the means to reclaim, secure, and protect the freedom and humanity denied to the colonial enslaved. What is more, it did not seek expansion: its principles\n\nDessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\n|\n\n31\n\nof non-intervention, and thus non-expansion, were made explicit in the Acte. Independent Haiti did not seek to embody Jefferson’s phrase, but rather to critique it. According to these same Dessalinean principles of adaptation and iteration, it performed the Jeffersonian idea of “empire of liberty” to delegitimize and subvert it. Anthony Bogues has shown how black radical critique reveals the paradox of Jefferson’s universal Enlightenment idea. Jefferson’s “empire of liberty” was based on the refusal of freedom to slaves and to Native American tribes, “a project in which the possibility of total domination was the horizon.”36 Here again, Dessalinean thought provides a useful origin point for black radical critique of the paradoxes—and hypocrisy—of Enlightenment liberalism. By claiming the legitimacy of an empire of freedom—one that performed the opposite of Jefferson’s expansionist project and proclaimed radical antislavery—independent Haiti laid bare the paradoxes at the core of Jeffersonian ideals of liberty. Haiti’s claiming of the empire of liberty is yet another example of Dessalinean rhetoric: rescripting dominant terms that circulated in the eighteenth-century Atlantic print public sphere to perform and legitimize Haitian statehood while simultaneously calling into question the putative legitimacy of those dominant systems. Is it so strange to think that Dessalineans intended to create an empire from the start? Scholars’ desire for a redemptive revolution has translated into a lack of engagement with Dessalines’s discomfiting empire. What little analysis there is of Dessalinean imperium places it within the paradigm of Napoleonic imperialism.37 But the empire in Haiti was also designed to safeguard against the political faction that challenged Dessalineans’ hold on power: republicanism. Dessalines warned that Haitians would not truly be free until they rid themselves of the “mark of the French” (empreinte française), which in the Acte de l’indépendance is linked directly to a republican form of government: “The French name still haunts our lands. Everything here revives the memory of the cruelties of this barbaric people; our laws, our customs, our cities, everything still bears the mark of the French; nay, there are still Frenchmen on our island and you believe yourself free and independent of that Republic that fought all nations, it is true, but that never defeated those who wanted to be free.”38 Here again, as before, Dessalines contrasts the putative liberalism of France’s revolutionary republicanism and Haiti’s radical, anticolonial self-liberation. Dessalineans also sought to coun-\n\n32\n\n| Dessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\nter the threat of liberal republicanism from within Haiti—the claims to equality and individual rights, but not necessarily a strong anticolonial, antislavery stance—by establishing an anticolonial, antislavery empire.\n\nThe Enemy Within At the very end of Dessalines’s address to the independent people of Haiti, he calls upon his generals to join in the oath that will eternalize their glory and their independence: to die rather than live under France’s domination. He also issues an important warning: “If there be a tepid heart among us, may he stand back and tremble to utter the oath that will unite us.”39 And once more after the oath is repeated, he warns his generals: “And if ever you were to refuse or begrudgingly receive the laws dictated to me by the spirit40 who watches over your future and your happiness, you would deserve the fate of ungrateful people.”41 These threats are far from veiled, taking aim not only at those who would refuse his orders, but also at the lukewarm generals who might grumble under their breath instead of vehemently proclaiming their desire to renounce the French. Those who dissent, those who are only halfhearted in their support—they will receive the treatment reserved for the ungrateful. Dessalines concludes his address by saying, “But be it far from me this terrible idea,” which serves both to expose and threaten his internal dissenters, gesturing to the dreadful idea of what might befall those who moderated their support of their leader.42 It would be useful here to imagine the effect of this address on the revolutionary generals assembled in Gonaïves. Dessalines was publicly calling out those who disagreed with his designs for the post-independence Haitian state. Did they look to their allies, recognizing the threat against them? Did they look to the ground, hoping not to catch the attention of the Dessalineans? And who were these lukewarm, grumbling resisters? Dessalines was targeting primarily, and perhaps only, his remaining source of opposition after 1804: the republicans. Indeed, Madiou notes that while republican generals such as Pétion, Gérin, and Bonnet signed the proclamation elevating Dessalines to “Gouverneur Général à vie,” they expressed concern for the way other members of the independence movement were speaking about power, government form, violence,\n\nDessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\n| 33\n\nand vengeance.43 Recall from the introduction that during the War of Independence, northern insurgents such as Jean-Baptiste Sans Souci and Macaya were a great source of internal dissension for Dessalines— what Michel-Rolph Trouillot calls the “war within the war.”44 Dessalines largely quashed that threat by having Christophe and other northern generals assassinate the insurgents, consolidating his power and unifying the North under the Armée Indigène. While followers of Sans Souci, Macaya, and others continued to foment uprisings in the North, the main power centers in post-independence Haiti were held by Dessalineans and republicans. These divisions played out along geographic lines: Dessalines’s power was strongest in the first division of the West, but also in the North in Gonaïves and Cap-Haïtien. The South remained mostly out of his reach: he negotiated power there primarily through the southern generals, and, as Madiou has noted, generals like Elie Gérin operated autonomously most of the time. In many ways, tension with the republicans and the potential for civil war was a constant through line from the earliest days of the revolutionary tumult in the colony. Even with pro-republican André Rigaud’s loss and exile after the War of the South, the southern peninsula—a bastion of pro-French republicanism—continued to operate autonomously from Dessalines’s Armée Indigène, only capitulating to his rule in July 1803. And the role of the pro-republican faction within the Armée Indigène was not seamless: in September 1803, Dessalines criticized Geffrard in the South for being too accommodating to the French, openly trading with them in the port of Les Cayes and treating them with a “moderation” that Dessalines disapproved of.45 The transition from the November 29, 1803, proclamation of independence by Christophe, Dessalines, and Clervaux to the official, ceremonial Acte de l’indépendance of January 1, 1804, reveals these factional divides within the revolutionary government and the very different futures these groups envisioned. During the intervening month, the politics of Dessalineanism, and the language and imagery through which it would be communicated, were decided among Dessalines’s generals and his secretarial corps. The January 1 document reveals their choice: that violent anticolonialism coupled with a military authoritarian state enforcing order, unity, and obedience was the best strategy to move forward as an independent black abolitionist state in the Atlantic world.\n\n34\n\n| Dessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\nMadiou notes that the secretarial corps set out collectively to draft the text of the official Acte de l’indépendance that would put forth Haiti’s politics into the world.46 The well-known, possibly apocryphal story that Dessalines rejected a first attempt at the Acte de l’indépendance by Charéron, a French-educated member of his secretarial corps, in favor of the unbridled violence of Boisrond Tonnerre’s version is not wrong, so much as it is incomplete.47 That Dessalines would reject versions lacking the requisite tone and imagery is entirely consistent with his view of writing as an anticolonial weapon. But Charéron’s version may also have been too in line with the republican faction, especially if he modeled it on the US Declaration of Independence. What is noticeably absent from the January 1, 1804, proclamation is the language of individual rights and the idea of liberté associated with those rights, the pursuit of happiness, talents, virtue, parliamentarism or the sharing of power, democracy, or a constitution.48 The fact that the final and ultimate version of the proclamation so clearly refuses these elements suggests that Dessalines commanded a document that more fully embodied the spirit of anticolonial independence and addressed the internal threat of republicanism. Juste Chanlatte performed a similar anti-republican anticolonialism in his Dessalinean writing.49 His first published text in independent Haiti was his “Hymne haytiène,” performed on January 21, 1804, which included the signature “Ch . . .” found in many of Chanlatte’s other texts.50 The identification of the author only by the two letters of his last name affirm that Dessalinean writing was a collective and performative endeavor: it was not meant to glorify the individual author or praise his lyric genius, but to glorify Dessalines, the great military hero of Haitian independence, and to unify under him in order to preserve Haitian order and liberty. Chanlatte participates in the multi-generic, multi-platform promotion of Dessalinean anticolonial antislavery, in proclamations, pamphlets, broadsides, poems, and songs. Chanlatte’s hymn rehearses the same themes, imagery, and political positions as the Acte, but through a different form: the ceremonial song of praise. Such poems commonly accompanied ceremonial occasions, and also appear in the pages of Dessalines’s official government paper, the Gazette politique et commerciale, published in Cap-Haïtien in 1804. These poems were sung and performed aloud for an audience—in the case of Chan-\n\nDessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\n|\n\n35\n\nlatte’s “Hymne haytiène,” reiterating and anchoring in oral performance the content of the Acte de l’indépendance. I want to look closely at Chanlatte’s song because he constructs it as a complement to the Acte de l’indépendance and specifically its antirepublicanism and the threat of the enemy within, made evident in the first lines of Chanlatte’s hymn. He addresses the lukewarm Haitians whom Dessalines called out, asking incredulously why anyone would remain silent in the face of Dessalines’s glorious proclamation: “What? You are staying silent, Indigenous People? / When a Hero, by his feats, / Avenging your name, breaking your chains / Has forever ensured your rights?”51 Given the radical anti-French and anti-republican tenor of the Acte, it is notable that Chanlatte’s “Hymne” is directed to be sung to the tune of “Allons enfants de la patrie” as a parody or contrafactum.52 Chanlatte is pointing here of course to Rouget de Lisle’s “Chant de guerre pour l’Armée du Rhin,” which later became known as the “Hymne des Marseillais,” and was declared the French Republic’s national anthem on July 14, 1795.53 But why pen a contrafactum to this particular tune, one of the many symbols of French republicanism? In the spirit and rhetoric of Dessalinean writing, Chanlatte’s hymn highlights and critiques the paradox of French republican liberté enshrined in this foundational text of the French First Republic. More than thumbing his nose at a French readership or listening public, though, I believe, Chanlatte’s contrafactum also had an internal Haitian audience in mind: the pro-republican faction. Chanlatte’s parodic hymn was aimed at those Haitians who had wished to create a republic, and who continued to grumble from the southern peninsula while buying themselves time to make independent Haiti into the radical instantiation of French liberté that they believed it should be: Gérin, Pétion, Yayou, Vaval, Bonnet, and many others, who would eventually overthrow the empire and assassinate the emperor in 1806. Let us look briefly at the two songs together, to see how Chanlatte cites and adapts the French original, ultimately subverting the republican ideal of liberté it promoted. Chanlatte’s hymn follows the same organization of fourteen-line stanzas, each composed of nine lines (with the fourth and fifth lines repeating), followed by a shorter five-line refrain that repeats in each stanza. Here are the first stanzas of each:\n\n36\n\n| Dessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\nAllons enfants de la Patrie, Le jour de gloire est arrivé! Contre nous de la tyrannie, L’étendard sanglant est levé, (bis) Entendez-vous dans les campagnes Mugir ces féroces soldats? Ils viennent jusque dans vos bras Egorger vos fils, vos compagnes! Aux armes, citoyens, Formez vos bataillons, Marchons, marchons! Qu’un sang impur Abreuve nos sillons!54\n\nQuoi? tu te tais Peuple Indigène! Quand un Héros, par ses exploits, Vengeant ton nom, brisant ta chaine, A jamais assure tes droits? (bis) Honneur à sa valeur guerrière! Gloire à ses efforts triomphants! Offrons-lui nos cœurs, notre encens; Chantons d’une voix mâle et fière, Sous ce bon Père unis, A jamais réunis Vivons, mourons, Ses vrais Enfants, (bis) Libres, indépendants.\n\n(Arise children of the Fatherland, The day of glory has arrived! Against us tyranny’s Bloody flag is raised! (twice) Do you hear in the countryside, The roar of those ferocious soldiers? They’re coming right into your arms To cut the throats of your sons, your companions!! To arms, citizens, Form your battalions, Let’s march, let’s march! Let impure blood Water our furrows!)\n\n(What? you keep silent, Native People! When a Hero, with his feats, Avenging your name, breaking your chains Forever ensures your rights? (twice) Honor to his military might! Glory to his triumphant efforts! Let us offer him our hearts, our heady praise; Let us sing strongly and proudly, United under this good Father, Forever joined together, We live, we die, His true Children, (twice) Free, independent.)\n\nDessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\n|\n\n37\n\nIf we ignore Chanlatte’s second indication to repeat the lines in the refrain (“Vivons, mourons, ses vrais Enfants, / Libres, indépendants”), the rhythm and disposition of syllables, caesurae, and rhyme follow exactly the refrain in Rouget de Lisle: “Marchons, marchons! / Qu’un sang impur / abreuve nos sillons!” with even the third-person imperative “-ons” ending matching up in the refrains. Chanlatte’s hymn also draws on many of the same images and terms from de Lisle’s original, remaking them in the service of the Dessalinean imagery established in the Acte de l’indépendance. For example, where de Lisle calls upon “children of the fatherland” (enfants de la patrie), Chanlatte calls upon independent Haitians to live and die as Dessalines’s “true Children” (vrais Enfants), replacing the republican fatherland in France with the imperial father of independent Haiti. The poignant image in de Lisle’s refrain of the invaders’ blood irrigating France’s fields is taken up later by Chanlatte, again infused with Haitian revolutionary and Vodou imagery: “With the blood of a cruel horde, / Yes, when you water their bones, / These words can be heard, / Deep from within the land of the dead” (Du sang d’une horde cruelle, / Oui, quand vous arrosez leurs os, / Elles font entendre ces mots, / Du sein de la nuit éternelle).55 The blood of the “cruel horde,” here taken to mean the French expeditionary army and the other colonists massacred after independence, irrigates the bones of “victims”—those earlier inhabitants of the island who perished under slavery and at the hands of the French forces, but also the much longer heritage of Amerindian victims of colonial dominance—a key element in the justification of Dessalines’s foundational act of vengeance. Just as the Acte evoked the bones of the enslaved ancestors and the need to avenge their spirits, Chanlatte evokes the act of watering these ancestors’ bones with blood to allow them to speak. The words voiced by these ancestors—Amerindian and African— are a reprisal of the refrain “Vivons, mourons, ses vrais Enfants” (quoted above), this time transformed from the first-person imperative, “nous,” to the second-person imperative, “vous” command: “Vivez, mourez, ses vrais Enfants” (Live, die, his true Children).56 Here, we have the voices of the island’s dead—slaves, Amerindians—commanding their progeny to rally under Dessalines and avenge their death. The act of giving voice to the voiceless victims of slavery, African and Amerindian is a central part of the Dessalinean anticolonial critique of Enlightenment universalism and with deep ties to Vodou mythology. We mistake and misrepresent\n\n38\n\n| Dessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\nthese critiques when we assume that Dessalinean writers like Chanlatte are operating purely within Western episteme.57 The terror of metaphoric slavery—slavery to arbitrary rule—abounds in Rouget de Lisle’s hymn, which he describes using the language of chattel slavery.58 He rallies the French revolutionary army to fight against an enemy that threatened to “reenslave” them by depicting the soldiers of Prussia, Austria, and other European armies as a “horde of slaves” (horde d’esclaves) because they are subjects of arbitrary rule. By contrast, he describes the French soldiers’ resistance to “vile chains” (ignobles entraves) and “irons” that other European countries were preparing for them: “It is us that they dare plan / To return to ancient slavery [l’antique esclavage]!” Elsewhere, de Lisle warns that the French will labor under the yoke of another master: “By chained hands / Under the yoke [sous le joug] our brows would bend! / Vile despots would become / The Masters of our future!” How can Haitian revolutionaries have heard this, the French Republic’s official anthem, and not seized upon the deafening silence on the actual practice of African, chattel slavery? Again, Chanlatte’s choice of tune for his contrafactum is a significant one: he evokes the paradox of “slavery” in French revolutionary republican discourse and its ultimate failure to ensure the universal project of liberty from chattel slavery. Here again, we are at the heart of Dessalinean critique and the paradox of the Enlightenment idea of liberté. Where Rouget de Lisle’s hymn is a collective song to rally troops, Chanlatte’s hymn is closer to a religious song of worship and thanks to the great liberator of the slaves, who will ensure the Haitian people’s collective future and continued freedom from chattel slavery and French colonial rule. Where de Lisle offers the hypothetical possibility of metaphoric, political reenslavement if the French republican army does not fight European monarchs (“Under the yoke our brows would bend!”), Chanlatte uses a similar phrasing to describe Dessalines’s actual, historical liberation of Saint-Domingue’s enslaved masses. It is Dessalines the African eagle who materializes from the sky (echoing his proclamation in the Acte “I sacrificed everything to fly to your defense”), to lift Haitians from their subjection and rid the island of the French: “To lift up our weary brows / Jacque appears, they vanish.”59 Where there is a collective element to the French Republic’s fight against tyranny in de Lisle’s hymn, in Chanlatte’s there is a clear glorification of Dessalines and his role in the\n\nDessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\n|\n\n39\n\nliberation and humanization of the colony’s enslaved, and thus a call to unity under the great liberator. The penultimate stanza returns to the indignant, aggressive nature of the first, and rehearses the full weight of Dessalines’s warning about internal discord and the enemy within: Quel est cet indigne Insulaire, Ce lâche cœur, ce vil soldat Qui, désormais sous sa bannière N’affronterait point le trépas? (bis) Qu’il parle; au défaut du Tonnerre, Pour expier cet attentat, Nos bras levés contre l’ingrat, Sauront le réduire en poussière. (Who is this unworthy Islander, This cowardly heart, this worthless soldier Who, henceforth under his banner Would not face death? (twice) May he speak; in the absence of a Thunderbolt,60 To atone for this attack, Our arms raised against the ingrate, Will reduce him to dust.)\n\nHere, like the Acte de l’indépendance, Chanlatte’s song seeks to identify those who do not commit fully to Dessalines’s anticolonial independence. The stanza serves as an open call to ferret out the “unworthy Islander” (indigne Insulaire) who shuns his duty to renounce the French and live and die under Dessalines’s paternal authority. The assonance in the letter i links the “indigne Insulaire” with the adjective “ingrat,” in a direct reference to the Acte, which warned those who refused or begrudgingly received Dessalines’s orders (tu mériterais le sort des peuples ingrats). The internal dissenter is all of these things (an unworthy islander, an ingrate), but he is surely not a Haitian—not worthy of this name that Dessalines chose to symbolize Haiti’s Amerindian ancestors and their brave fight to the death against the conquistadores. It is more than simply being an islander (insulaire) that makes one Haitian: one\n\n40\n\n| Dessalines’s Empire of Liberty\n\nmust be committed to Dessalines’s radical regime. Chanlatte demands that this ingrate (ce lâche cœur, ce vil soldat, here linking back to the cœur tiède of the Acte) make himself known. He asks: who is this dissenter who shies away from confronting death, from taking the oath that Dessalines delivered—to live free and independent, to choose death for all those who would seek to reenslave Haiti? May he speak (“Qu’il parle”) and may a thunderbolt strike him down right then. Only if this divine intervention does not come will his own brothers strike him down, reducing him to dust (an image that picks up on the image of ashes in both Rouget de Lisle’s original and the Haitian Acte). The song ends on a note of religious worship that serves to transform the revolutionary fervor of 1802–1804 into a consolidation of the empire and Dessalines’s imperial rule. Chanlatte takes the famous rallying cry of "
