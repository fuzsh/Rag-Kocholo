        "text": "Celebrating a life in perfect balance.\n\nEugenio María de Hostos (1839–1903) was an educator, philosopher, intellectual, lawyer, sociologist, novelist, and Puerto Rican independence advocate (and more! See Wiki ).\n\nHis name and fame resonate all over his natal island: many buildings, schools and streets — and statues like the one above — honor him. He is revered throughout the Americas, including the U.S. where Hostos Community College in New York City is named for him.\n\nWhen the U.S. took possession of Puerto Rico in 1898 he moved to the Dominican Republic, determined not to return — nor be reinterred after his death — until Puerto Rico gained its independence.\n\nThrough his vast bibliography, it is easy to find virtually everything about him. What has not been easy (for me) is finding information about this curious statue (and its sculptor) in the center of Plaza de la Beneficencia in Old San Juan. If you can find a link, please post it in the comments!"
