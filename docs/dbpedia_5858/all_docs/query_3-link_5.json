        "text": "My Dear Colleagues and Students,\n\nAs I open the pages to our Spring 2021 Semanario Hostosiano/Hostos Weekly, I am moved by many thoughts about our grief shared as a nation for the COVID losses and uncertainty. Yet there is power in hope and in knowing the value of generosity, determination, persistence and belief in the future. The seasons teach us that spring is just around the corner and life regenerates with beauty, grace and predictability in this the most hopeful of seasons. Let that thought be with us even as we work harder than ever to reach out to our returning students to ensure that they are registered and ready to engage in a semester of learning and hope for a better future for us all.\n\nI had a very good meeting with our SGA students recently where transition of power, the outgoing President Muiz Agbaje could not have been more supportive and eloquent about incoming President Brian Carter. I told them that they model behavior for others, elsewhere and welcomed newly elected President Brian Carter in his new role.\n\nA few weeks ago, our students in the Digital Animation Class provided a talented and generous display of short animations; their visions of moving forward in the pandemic: A great tribute to their talent, hope and faith, and to the generous, dedicated and professional education they receive from very caring professors.\n\nI breathe with relief as I consider the powerful display of order and democracy this past Wednesday. We are looking forward to the possibility of a more engaged, equitable, diverse and better future for all of us, including our DACA students and our immigrant populations. We also concentrate and place our expectations on the distribution of vaccines, and on the possibility of having a safe and joyous gradual return to normalcy next academic year.\n\nOur colleagues in Behavioral and Social Sciences shared some very powerful reflections on inauguration day which you will find proudly included in the Semanario.\n\nI wish you a successful and enjoyable semester. Mil gracias y bendiciones, Daisy.\n\nDaisy Cocco De Filippis, Ph.D.\n\nInterim President\n\nWE ARE HAPPY TO SHARE REMARKS ON THE JANUARY 6, 2021 INSURRECTION DISTRIBUTED ON JANUARY 11, FOR OUR REFLECTION:\n\nJanuary 6, 2021 was a day marked by historic extremes.\n\nDemocrat candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff were declared the winners of Georgia’s run-off elections, signaling a powerful and major shift in political thought and demographics in the Peach State, the greater South and the composition and power structure in the U.S. Senate.\n\nAnd, in Washington, D.C., homegrown terrorists— empowered by the President’s baseless claims of election fraud— stormed the Capitol in an attempt to disrupt and invalidate the Electoral College’s certification of Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and Kamala Harris as the next President and Vice President of the United States. Such rampant and illegal activity is a grave insult to the democratic process, which must reflect the will of the people and not the misguided wishes of an entitled subgroup.\n\nThe world was shocked and appalled by the spectacle of such lawlessness. Shocking as well was the lack of response on the part of local and federal law enforcement. The hypocrisy is staggering: peaceful protests by Black Lives Matters advocates have been treated with unnecessary force and unjustified violence, but a mob bent on subverting the will of the American people was, in many instances, given a free pass to do as they pleased.\n\nThe destruction wrought upon the Capitol Building and the threat to the safety and well-being of the members of Congress did not come out of nowhere. The nation has no choice but to address the divisive and destructive elements that have long existed in our society. Systemic racism, economic and social inequality, a degraded level of political discourse: these and other issues must be dealt with. These attitudes are the product of fear, greed, and ignorance.\n\nThe task facing America’s educators is clear, and I believe community colleges provide an example and serve as a vehicle for the kind of thought and action required in this troubled day and age.\n\nOn any given day on a community college campus, a marvelously diverse student body gathers to learn through dialogue and interaction with their instructors and fellow students. People of all ages, ethnicities, socioeconomic status, and genders are included— and all welcome. Ideas are exchanged, projects are collaborated upon, means of solving problems are tried and tested. Preconceived assumptions and misconceptions fall by the wayside in the light of knowledge.\n\nHostos’ dedication to justice on all levels, in every sphere, is as strong as it was when the College was founded in 1968. The institution is committed, as part of its goal of equal access for all, to providing the communities it serves with a forum to examine the critical issues we face.\n\nWhile acknowledging the gravity of the riot and insurgence at the Capitol, I am impelled to point out the fact that the attempt to derail Biden and Harris’ certification failed. They will assume office later this month and initiate what we all hope will be a newer and brighter era in the nation’s political life.\n\nLet us all strive to play a part in continuing to foster the civil, respectful, diverse, inclusive society we wish to live in. Change is never easy. But it is inevitable. And it is happening now.\n\nWE ARE PROUD TO SHARE WITH YOU REFLECTIONS ON INAUGURATION DAY BY COLLEAGUES IN THE BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES DEPARTMENT:\n\nKristopher Burrell, Ph.D.\n\nThe inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden is taking place in the midst of numerous social, economic, and public health crises. There will be much to contend with as a country during Biden’s term in office. Coming just two days after the federal birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., it is necessary to utilize the prophetic wisdom of Dr. King in developing a democratic legislative vision for our country in the next four years and beyond. In 1963 in Birmingham, Alabama, responding to criticisms over the direct-action protests of Black residents in opposition to Jim Crow segregation, King argued that social tension was necessary for societal growth. The tension certainly exists in our country. We cannot be afraid of this tension. Neither can the incoming Biden administration. Our country can no longer prefer “order” over justice. Breaking down systemic racism, eradicating poverty, and reversing environmental degradation are extremely uncomfortable. However, it will be necessary for the new administration and us all as Americans to do the necessary work to address these issues in constructive ways.\n\nHelen Chang, Ph.D.\n\nPolitical scientist Maurice Duverger (1984) believed that “electoral mechanisms are strange devices—simultaneously cameras and projectors. They register images which they have partly created themselves.” As we learn from the last four years and look to the next four years, we must remember that our democratic institutions are not immutable. American voters and our elected leaders are not simply constrained by the rules governing our political system, but together, we also have the ability to shape these rules and expand on who they work for.\n\nSarah Hoiland, Ph.D.\n\nDr. Jill Biden will make history by keeping her faculty position at Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA) while serving as First Lady of the United States (FLOTUS), which mirrors her decision to teach at NOVA while serving as Second Lady from 2008-2017. With these choices, she is modernizing the role of First Lady, asserting the importance of her profession, our profession, and maintaining her commitment to debt-free community college. In August, she tweeted from @DrBiden, \"Teaching is not what I do. It's who I am.\"\n\nHer use of \"Dr.\" has ruffled feathers; most notably in Joseph Epstein's December 11th, 2020 WSJ Opinion in which he questioned her use of \"Dr.\" saying it \"sounds and feels fraudulent, not to say a touch comic.\" Thousands have since critiqued Epstein's paternalistic and sexist tone as well as the basis for his argument while others supported the attempt to reduce her status and earned doctorate. Women and people of color constantly fight to be afforded the same respect white men are given with or without a title inside and outside academia.\n\nI have many hopes for the next four years, but what I will demand is debt-free community college and full investment in our community college students, staff, and faculty as restitution for disinvestment from the communities in which we teach, and a commitment to a more just and equitable society. For inspiration, we don't have to look any farther than the Hostos giants who fought to keep our College open 50 years ago.\n\nErnest Ialongo, Ph.D.\n\nMy only thought on the inauguration is that it cannot come soon enough.\n\nWhat these past four years have shown us, and what January 6, 2021 made abundantly clear, is that the democratic form of government is a fragile thing. Ours is a government of laws, but it is also a commitment to adhere to those laws, and not to give in to the desire to foment change through violence. The storming of the capitol reminded us that all the processes we have in place for a democratic election can be overturned in an instant when a determined group of people seek to impose might over right. The insurrection was the culmination of 4 years of civil discord which had been enflamed by President Trump in an attempt at undermining faith in democratic institutions and focusing the attentions of the frustrated minority onto him as the savior of a purportedly failed system.\n\nAllusions to Trump’s fascistic tendencies have been legion since he came to office: the press as the enemy of the people, the identification of the cult leader as the state itself, a demand for unswerving loyalty by the leader, a hyper-masculine ethos that seeks to humiliate and obliterate the political opposition, a pronounced nationalism and militarism, xenophobia, and a far too comfortable tendency to encourage violence against one’s enemies. Scholars of fascism pointed to these connections between Trump and Hitler and Mussolini early on. They were not taken seriously. Yet, as the years passed, and rhetoric became political action and legislation, and the violence at the heart of this rhetoric led to actual violence on January 6, 2021, such scholars are now being taken very seriously.\n\nThe inauguration of President-elect Biden and Vice-President-elect Harris will bring the country back to its best ideals, will put us back on the course where we continue to form ‘a more perfect union’, and where we confidently face the challenges that lay ahead.\n\nCUNY Scholars Weigh in on a Historic Inauguration\n\nWe Asked CUNY Experts What This Moment Means to Them, Our Country, and How We Move Forward. Read more.\n\nHappy new year to you all. I hope you had a wonderful holiday and got to spend time with your families and loved ones. 2020 was a very challenging year, but thankfully we are alive to witness the beginning of a new year. For all the lives and souls lost in 2020, may their souls rest in perfect peace and for all of you that lost a loved one over the last year, you have my warmest condolences and my encouragement to kick into the new year with a positive mindset. This year I pray for our wealth and success in everything you pursue and most importantly mental stability.\n\nAs of December 2020, I officially graduated from Hostos Community College while serving as the President of the Student Government Association. It has been both an honor and a privilege to uphold the standards and serve this prestigious organization. There are a lot of emotions to be set and a lot of words to write but I am not able to express how much joy and sadness I feel at the same time leaving the school. In my time as President, a lot of work has been done, but I want to take this time to acknowledge and thank everyone that helped me to this point. My senators have been an amazing group of individuals that kept pushing throughout the semester. As you know, we had to run an organization for the first time virtually due to the pandemic and it wasn’t an easy task but the SGA came flying high. I’ve done everything possible to represent the students of the college and for that I am grateful. I am grateful for all the support that I got from faculty members, staff and the administration, without you all, this wouldn’t have been a success.\n\nIt is now time for me to move on to the next phase of my life, it is time for me to find who I am and to continue my academic success. This college continues to be a huge part of my life and a family, a home where I am always welcome. There will be a new administration, one that I am confident will continue to serve the students of the college and provide opportunities that benefit the students. The new administration is focused on the progress of the college and advocacy for the students with the help of the college administration. It’ll be an honor to introduce you to the leader of this new administration, Mr. Brian Carter. Brian is a friend, colleague and most importantly a brother that’ll help the Hostos family. He has displayed strong leadership over the years that I have known him and I am more confident to hand over the Presidency to him. He’s friendly, very outspoken and most importantly he has the first of the students’ interest at heart. Here are a few words from Mr. Brian Carter;\n\n“Thank you for acknowledging me as the incoming President. I would like to also thank the previous administration for all of their hard work and effort in these trying times we have experienced thus far. I completely understand and fully accept responsibility going forward. I am excited about the responsibility and opportunity for this upcoming semester in which I plan to follow tradition and continue to lead by example through my experiences as being a diligent student leader going forward”.\n\nNow that you have heard from Mr. Carter, I encourage you all to be supportive, to help guide and provide him with all the necessary help that you have provided for me to succeed. I am confident Brian will do well with the support of the college, the administration and the students.\n\nThis is the hard part; the part when I say goodbye, as this will be my last communication with the college as the President of the SGA. I will forever remain a student of the college and a part of the family. I am terrible at goodbyes so I would say to the students, faculty and staff instead, see you soon!\n\nSubmitted by Assistant Dean for Institutional Effectiveness, Strategic Planning and Assessment | OIERA, Babette Audant, Ph.D | Drafting Institutional Advisement Outcomes\n\n“The best way of doing things is doing things”*\n\nThe role of advisement services at Hostos, as it is across higher education, is multi-vectored. By engaging with advisement services, students gain information, they are provided with guidance, and they develop self-efficacy— all of this in a supportive, safe/brave space between student and advisor.\n\nThere are numerous ways of assessing the outcome of advisement services. For example, we can measure the link between a certain number of interactions between student and advisor and student outcomes such as retention and graduation— always acknowledging the limitations of the research. Another approach to assessing advisement outcomes is focusing on student learning outcomes, or SLOs.\n\nThrough interactions with advisement services, Hostos students learn about college policies, they learn about degree programs, and how to navigate resources such as Degree Audit. They learn how to ask for assistance, and how to contact faculty about their concerns. Students learn how to advocate for themselves. Assessing a common set of student learning outcomes across all advisement services is a national best practice, and one the AES Assessment Committee (AESAC) and the Cross-Divisional Advisement Committee (CDAC) will implement at Hostos this spring.\n\nThe first step is identifying student learning outcomes that reflect the goals of advisement services at Hostos. On December 11th, a group of more than twenty representatives of CDAC, AESAC and Hostos’ advisement units (including SSCU, ASAP, CD and CUNY Start/Math Start) participated in a workshop led by Dr. Meredith Reitman, assessment consultant. After introductions, participants worked in small groups to identify what they, as frontline staff, managers and directors, do every day, and what students will be able to do as a result of these daily activities. After a break, we reviewed the collective efforts as a large group and sorted the responses, using the CAS (the Council for the Advancement of Standards in Higher Education) Standards for Advisement as a framework.\n\nThe CAS framework has six domains, or categories of academic advisement outcomes including ”knowledge acquisition, integration, construction, and application” and “intrapersonal development.” These outcomes resonated with workshop participants who are familiar with the CAS framework, and whose work is already informed by these national standards. Aligning ground level input with the CAS domains was a way of adding local dimension to a nationally recognized framework. The resulting advisement student learning outcomes, or Institutional Advisement Outcomes (IAOs), is currently in draft form. Once it is reviewed by CDAC members, and the workshop participants, the IAOs will be shared with the Hostos community. Echoing Maestro Hostos’ apt aphorism that the “best way of doing things is doing things,” we will implement systematic assessment of the IAOs this spring. While premature (the IAOs have not been finalized), the energy and enthusiasm exhibited during the workshop warranted a public celebration of participants’ optimism, and readiness to take on the next phases of this work.\n\nAdvisors know students learn through their interactions with advisement services. Assessing whether that learning is achieved well, or whether it is not, will inform continuous improvement. By acknowledging that advisement is a college-wide service provided at multiple sites, having shared Institutional Advisement Outcomes provides a platform for talking together about how to ensure our students are getting what we promise them. Without erasing the qualities that make our multiple advisement units distinct, the IAOs provide a common ground, and statement of shared commitment.\n\n*January 11th marked the birthday of our college’s namesake, Eugenio María de Hostos. In addition to be in an impassioned and unwavering advocate for social justice, women’s right, access to education and democracy, he was also a practical man. A collection of his aphorisms, translated by Professor Orlando Jose Hernández, can be found here: Eugenio María de Hostos 50 Aphorisms-50 Aforismos including the ones cited above."
