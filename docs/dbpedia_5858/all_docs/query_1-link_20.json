        "text": "(1839–1903). An educator, writer, and political leader, Eugenio Maria de Hostos y Bonilla was an early advocate of self-government for the island of Puerto Rico. The author of many essays and treatises on social-science topics, Hostos was one of the first systematic sociologists in Latin America. He was an important advocate for the rights of Chinese laborers in Peru and women in Chile; his work for the latter group played an important role in helping them gain admission to professional schools.\n\nHostos was born near Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, on Jan. 11, 1839. After receiving his elementary education in San Juan, he traveled to Spain for his secondary and university studies, becoming active in the republican politics of that country. He left Spain in 1869 when its new constitution refused to grant autonomy to Puerto Rico, and went to New York City, where he became editor of the Cuban independence journal La Revolución.\n\nIn 1870, Hostos began to travel widely throughout South America, advocating for the abolishment of slavery and the formation of a federation of nations among the islands of the Antilles. He also championed the development of a trans-Andean railway. Turning his energies to education, Hostos spent the years from 1875 through 1888 teaching and helping to reform the educational systems of Chile and the Dominican Republic.\n\nAfter returning to the United States in 1898, Hostos became active in the Cuban independence movement. However, his hopes that Puerto Rico would be allowed to govern itself after the Spanish-American War (1898) were disappointed when the U.S. government rejected his proposal for autonomy and instead established its rule over the island as a territory. Hostos returned to the Dominican Republic in 1900, where he remained for the rest of his life. He died on Aug. 11, 1903, in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic."
