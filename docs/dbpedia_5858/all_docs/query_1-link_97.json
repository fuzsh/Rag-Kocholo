        "text": "by Besanya Santiago\n\nNational Hispanic Heritage month has arrived! We all know what means, right? Well, if you’ve lived anywhere near us, you should already know this. But let me just say it for my people in the back: NOT EVEN COVID-19 WILL STOP US FROM CELEBRATING ALL MONTH LONG. Punto y se acabó! This is the time to communicate with each other in a way we never have before. The New York City local community needs our support now more than ever. We may not be able to be there physically but we can still be there. Aaaaaand, might I add, we can be there in the comfort of our own home, wearing our pajamas, fuzzy slippers, hair going sixteen different directions with a piña colada in hand and a margarita in queue. I don’t even drink and that sounds fabulous. Vamos allá.\n\nSo, what is National Hispanic Heritage Month? A month long celebration in the United States, this is a time period where we honor the cultures and contributions made by Latin Americans throughout the country. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed this legislation put forward by Los Angeles Representative Edward R. Roybal. Originally, it was Hispanic Heritage Week but, lets be real, have you met us? Our birthdays alone last an entire month. One week was not enough time to properly pay homage to the list of accomplishments Latin Americans have made. Therefore, in 1988 new legislation was introduced to extend the week into a month from September 15 to October 15. The date was chosen for being the independence day anniversary of five Latin American countries: Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala. And thanks to George H. W. Bush, as of 1989 we have an entire month paying tribute to those who deserve it most. Albeit Puerto Rico’s political status remains undetermined, this should not diminish the numerous contributions Puerto Ricans have made in this country. From independence advocate Ramón Emeterio Betances to Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Puerto Ricans have traveled far to get to where we are today. And yes, there is still progress to be made. But for now, lets take a pause to reflect, recognize and celebrate the accomplishment of some pretty inspiring Boricuas. And don’t forget that piña colada.\n\nTake A Salsa Class\n\nAlthough salsa music didn’t technically originate in Puerto Rico, it is an immense part of the culture. The roots of salsa came from Eastern Cuba from the Cuban Son as well as Afro-Cuban dance. During the 1950s, it traveled to New York City where it continued to develop within the Puerto Rican community. So, if there is one thing New York City is not short of, it is salsa dance classes. Founded by dancer and choreographer Tina Ramirez, the Ballet Hispánico is a dance company representative of Hispanic culture in the United States. They perform all over the world while offering a variety of dance classes for ages 3+ that are now available online. Salsa Tuesdays is just one of the many awesome virtual dance courses on the schedule.\n\nUpcoming Events: Wepa Wednesday performances feat. Bombazo Dance Company\n\nLearn To Cook Mofongo\n\nA must try staple of Puerto Rican cuisine, Mofongo is even better when made at home. And if you have dietary restrictions, this is a simple way to fearlessly enjoy a new culinary culture by substituting ingredients as you see fit. Two exceptional channels are Sweets and Beyond and Cooking Con Omi for teaching Puerto Rican recipes. They’re also a useful tool for Spanish learners to get an additional benefit by learning to cook a new recipe while mastering new vocabulary without even realizing it. One of the most popular videos? Making mofongo. And let me just go ahead and co-sign that the recipe is on point.\n\nLocal Restaurants for Mofongo: Casa Adela and The Freakin’ Rican Restaurant\n\nPick up a Book\n\nLiterature may not be the first thing that comes to mind when people think of Puerto Rico but it’s actually about as old as the country itself. It was officially born in 1843 when a book of short stories and poetry named El Aguinaldo Puertorriqueño was published by a group of young authors. Since then, many incredible writers such as Eugenio Maria de Hostos, Lola Rodriguez and Julia de Burgos continued to shape the foundations of Puerto Rico’s literary movement, making it what it is today. A few must-read contemporary books include When I Was Puerto Rican by Esmeralda Santiago, War Against All Puerto Ricans by Nelson Denis and We Fed An Island by José Andrés.\n\nLocal Bookstores: Mil Mundos Books, Cafe Con Libros and Libreria Barco de PapelMil Mundos Books\n\nWatch Musical Performances\n\nThe Hostos Center for Arts and Culture has been an integral part of the artistic community since 1982. Part of the CUNY network, it was the first college named after a Puerto Rican (yep, the same Eugenio Maria de Hostos previously mentioned here). They are a name well worth knowing as they are constantly giving the Latin American community a voice. Another great organization is The Puerto Rican Traveling Theater. Founded by iconic Puerto Rican actress Miriam Colón, their main focus is to exhibit works that promote cultural awareness, all while opening up artistic opportunities to those within their own community. And luckily for us, both institutions have made all their performances available online.\n\nUpcoming Events: BomPlenazo 2020 and The Greater Good Theater Festival\n\nListen To Podcasts\n\nLiving in New York City, listening to podcasts is an an essential part of any commute. And as much we just love the eclectic variety of live performances on the metro, sometimes we could use a change of scenery. Podcasts are an ideal way to learn about Latin American culture in addition to keeping up with current events. Latino USA produced by NPR and hosted by Maria Hinojosa is popular due to its cross cultural nature in discussing political and social topics. Up for a language challenge? Directly from Puerto Rico, Siempre es Lunes is a fun, light hearted podcast that will submerge you headfirst into the Puerto Rican dialect. If you’re simply looking to have a good laugh, check out Latinos Out Loud and Bodega Boys.\n\nNoteworthy Episodes: Bobby Sanabria Reimagines West Side Story and Death of a Blood Sport"
