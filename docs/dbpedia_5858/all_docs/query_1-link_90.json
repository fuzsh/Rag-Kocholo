        "text": "— Dayra Rivera saw the letter as a slap in the face for Puerto Ricans: No, Apple Inc. told her, you cannot have the free iPhone case promised to U.S. customers.\n\nApple, which was giving out plastic cases because of problems with dropped calls, said it would not ship to an “international” destination. Never mind that Puerto Rico’s 4 million residents are American citizens, and that it is closer to the mainland than Hawaii.\n\n“I felt like I was being treated like a second-class citizen,” said Rivera, a 46-year-old manager of a clothing store near the capital, San Juan.\n\nApple, as it turns out, is hardly alone in considering the island 1,000 miles southeast of Florida a foreign land. Other businesses, politicians, entertainers and even Puerto Ricans themselves are not quite sure what to make of a place where highway distances are in kilometers but road speeds in miles per hour.\n\nFor now at least, the most Puerto Rican thing about Puerto Rico could be its identity problem.\n\nPuerto Ricans cannot decide whether they want to go for statehood, have some sort of in-between commitment or break up altogether. They have voted on the issue three times to date, in 1967, 1993 and 1998, and each time decided to keep the status quo.\n\nThe issue may come up again in 2011: The pro-statehood movement, which now controls the Legislature and the governor’s office, hopes to hold another vote. And the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill that would allow Puerto Rico’s government to ask its residents if they want to change the island’s commonwealth status.\n\nBut most exasperating of all is that, even as Puerto Rico is preoccupied with its status, much of the United States doesn’t seem to know or care.\n\nSeveral months ago, House candidate Vaughn Ward, a Republican from Idaho, called Puerto Rico a “country” in a political debate. When corrected, he said, “I really don’t care what it is. It doesn’t matter.”\n\nPuerto Rico has been under U.S. jurisdiction since 1898, its people citizens since 1917.The island is home to 150,000 military veterans, and three quarters of its National Guard troops have been deployed overseas since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The island shuts down and shoots off fireworks on the Fourth of July, American Independence Day.\n\nYet Puerto Ricans cannot vote for president, and their representative in Congress cannot vote either. They pay Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes that finance the government’s retirement and principal medical programs; they do not pay federal income tax (they pay Puerto Rican income tax instead, so it is no paradise).\n\nAnd The Associated Press considers its reporters in Puerto Rico foreign correspondents.\n\nBoth Spanish and English are official languages, although you will hear much more of the former. The island has a holiday in honor of Eugenio Maria de Hostos, a figure associated with Puerto Rican independence. It puts up its own Miss Universe contestant and its own Olympic team.\n\nConfused? So is Congress. Members of the U.S. Congress have wondered if they need passports to travel to Puerto Rico, according to an anecdote often told by New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, son of Cuban immigrants. And Joachim de Posada, an author and business consultant who lives in Puerto Rico, gets the passport question all the time, most recently in Germany. (Answer: U.S. citizens do not need passports.)\n\n“It is amazing the level of ignorance I find, not only in the U.S. but all around the world,” de Posada said.\n\nThere are other U.S. territories, such as Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands, but none has near the population of Puerto Rico and the huge cultural effect on the mainland that comes with it.\n\nThe question of what exactly the island is lingers even among Puerto Ricans in the United States, who outnumber those in Puerto Rico. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor has called her parents immigrants, but they are not from another country; they are from Puerto Rico. Sotomayor herself in recent years has been careful not to come down publicly on one side or the other of the statehood issue.\n\nThat is not the case with resident commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, the nonvoting representative in Congress.\n\n“The question about the statehood for Puerto Rico is not whether it’s going to happen, it’s when,” he said. “I have no doubt that’s where we’re headed.”\n\nPierluisi said the growing Hispanic population in the United States will compel Congress to support statehood if islanders demand it.\n\nHector Pesquera, co-chairman of the National Hostos Independence Movement, has a very different take. To him, Puerto Rico would be obliterated by statehood.\n\n“People who vote in favor of statehood are like chickens voting for Kentucky Fried Chicken,” he said.\n\nBut Rivera sees it as injustice all the same. She fired off a note to popular consumer rights advocacy blog Consumerist.com, which publicized her cause, as did several other online forums.\n\n“A lot of people were really upset over this situation,” she said. “They weren’t treating Puerto Rico right.”\n\nRivera said she generally stays out of the status debate, but the iPhone saga has pushed her toward statehood. “I want Puerto Rico to be a state so this situation gets fixed,” she said.\n\nShe may not have to wait. An Apple spokesman said the cancellation of Rivera’s iPhone case had been a mistake, although she would not say why or how it was made. And in August, Rivera got a follow-up: another e-mail that her case was en route.\n\nThis time the e-mail was in Spanish."
