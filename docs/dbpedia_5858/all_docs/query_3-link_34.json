I first got my feet wet in what was for me the new field of performance studies thanks to Diana Taylor and to the participants of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics’ Encuentro held at UNIRIO, the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2000. I went on to use the word translocas and to write a paper about Puerto Rican drag performance during my fellowship year in the seminar on performance led by Carolyn Williams and Elin Diamond at the Center for the Critical Analysis of Contemporary Culture (CCACC), now known as the Center for Cultural Analysis at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, in 2002. I wish to thank my former Rutgers colleagues Ben. Sifuentes-­Jáuregui, Yolanda Martínez-­San Miguel, Camilla Stevens, and César Braga-­Pinto for their unwavering support. I also benefited from the intellectual stimulation and collegiality of the Global Ethnic Literatures Seminar led by Tobin Siebers at the University of Michigan in 2004 and from a 2006 Woodrow Wilson Career Enhancement Fellowship. My first scholarly publication from this project appeared in Spanish in 2005. I thank Alberto Sandoval-­Sánchez and Frances R. Aparicio for the encouragement to write about Jorge B. Merced for their special issue of Revista Iberoamericana on Latinx literature and culture, and for their support over the years. I also wish to thank Susan Stryker, Paisley Currah, and Lisa Jean Moore for publishing an English-­language version of my essay in their special issue of WSQ: Women’s Studies Quarterly on “Trans-­” in 2008. Subsequently, Jill Lane had me submit my article “Translocas: Migration, Homosexuality, and Transvestism in Recent Puerto Rican Performance” to the peer-­reviewed, multilingual electronic journal emisférica, where it appeared in 2011 in English, Spanish, and Portuguese with the translation assistance of Pablo Assumpção Barros Costa, while Marcial Godoy\n\nx Acknowledgments\n\nencouraged me to submit a preliminary version of my work on Freddie Mercado for emisférica’s special issue on Caribbean rasanblaj, edited by Gina Athena Ulysse in 2015. ¡Gracias Jill! ¡Gracias Marcial! Before realizing this would be a book, and before I was even using the word “transloca,” I started publishing performance and theater reviews about some of the artists featured in Translocas in the Puerto Rican weekly newspaper Claridad in 1996, and have never stopped. I reprinted many of these early pieces in my more recent volume Escenas transcaribeñas: Ensayos sobre teatro, performance y cultura (2018), published by Isla Negra Editores in Puerto Rico, notwithstanding the challenges of Hurricanes Irma and María. I wish to thank Rafah Acevedo, Lowell Fiet, Alida Millán Ferrer, and Carlos Roberto Gómez Beras for their support. I also thank all of the readers in Puerto Rico and the diaspora who have encouraged me to write about our national culture. The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College, CUNY, has also been crucial in this respect; special thanks to Xavier Totti, editor of CENTRO Journal, for more than ten years of collaborations. Additional research for this book was conducted at the University of Michigan Library (Special Collections Research Center). At the University of Michigan Press, I am particularly thankful to LeAnn Fields for her friendship, professional encouragement, and support, and to Anna Pohlod and Melissa Scholke for their editorial assistance. I have presented numerous versions of these chapters at colleges, universities, and international professional conferences. I particularly wish to thank Marisa Belausteguigoitia, Lucía Melgar, Stephany Slaughter, and Hortensia Moreno for the positive reception I received at the Programa Universitario de Estudios de Género at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and for publishing my work in the unfortunately short-­lived, no longer available electronic journal Revista Re-­d: Arte, cultura visual y género and in the anthology Representación y fronteras: El performance en los límites del género, both in 2009. I also wish to thank Diego Falconí Trávez, Santiago Castellanos, and María Amelia Viteri, who published “Epistemología de la loca: Localizando a la transloca en la transdiáspora” in their anthology Resentir lo queer en América Latina: Diálogos desde/con el Sur, which appeared with Editorial Egales in Spain in 2014, and for their warm reception during my trips to Ecuador and Catalonia. More recently, I benefited from the welcome of Grace Dávila at Pomona College, where I spoke about Kevin Fret, and of Mabel Cuesta (University of Houston) and of Jorge L. Chinea and the staff of the Center for Latino/a and Latin American Studies at Wayne State University, who invited me\n\nAcknowledgments xi\n\nto speak about Javier Cardona. These are but some of the many generous interlocutors and invitations I have had for this project over the last seventeen years, which have also included Erika Almenara and Rachel ten Haaf (University of Arkansas); Arlene Dávila and María Josefina Saldaña Portillo (New York University); Theresa Delgadillo (while at the Ohio State University); Walfrido Dorta (Susquehanna University); Lowell Fiet and Rosa Luisa Márquez (Universidad de Puerto Rico, Río Piedras); Claire F.

I especially want to thank the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts at the University of Michigan for granting me Associate Professor Support Funds and a Michigan Humanities Award, as well as the National Center for Institutional Diversity for a Think-­Act Tank Grant for our Queer/Cuir Américas Work Group. Thank you to Kerry White for reading this manuscript during the COVID-­19 quarantine, and to Gregory E. Dowd, Enrique García Santo-­Tomás, Alejandro Herrero-Olaizola, Cristina Moreiras-­Menor, and Alexandra Minna Stern for reading earlier drafts. Perhaps my biggest debt is to the drag, trans, and otherwise queer or cuir Puerto Rican artists, filmmakers, activists, and writers who so generously have helped me in many occasions, and who have given all of us the gift of their work. Thank you.\n\nIntroduction\n\nTranslocas piss people off, but sometimes they also make us laugh and even cry. They (or should I be saying we, us Puerto Rican and Caribbean translocas) are upsetting and exhilarating but also dreadful, redundant, and passé. Hilarious but simultaneously boring. Gorgeous except when absolutely hideous or simply plain. Political except when we are not. Alive except when we are dead: assassinated, like the homeless trans woman Alexa Neulisa Luciano Ruiz in 2020 or the young Puerto Rican trap singer Kevin Fret in 2019, or burned and dismembered like the adolescent Jorge Steven López Mercado in 2009, or lost to AIDS like Lady Catiria in 1999, or swept up by the winds of a hurricane and left to die by the side of the road. Stuck in the past with fake Lee Press-­On Nails and clichéd jokes, boomeranging audiences into the future, snapping the present out of its complacency, challenging its teleological insistence on narratives of progress, modernity, and integration. Puerto Rican, Latinx, and Caribbean translocas (whether gay or straight, transgender or cisgender, dead or alive, male or female or simply fabulous) shatter molds in different colonial languages and geographies, but especially in the multiple transatlantic and trans-­Caribbean crossings between English and Spanish, dragging our bilingual cultural legacies like bright flowers or exotic birds in the tropics or as carcasses at the slaughterhouse, highlighting and subverting the negative connotations of the term “travesty” (a false, absurd, or distorted representation) embedded at the heart of the word “transvestism,” at least in its Spanish variant of travestismo.1 Disreputable, cross-­dressing, effeminate, and transgender translocas transubstantiate, vomit, and sometimes even clean ourselves up, engaging with abjection as much as glamour.2 We are dirty and messy, undesirable and offensive, except when we are bright and shiny like jewels or so nondescript or dainty that we make others and ourselves fall asleep. Translo-\n\n2 translocas\n\ncas, whether insane women, effeminate homosexuals, drag performers, or transgender subjects, are way too many things in an ever-­expanding transgeographic rhizomatic map that inhabits and pushes out from the tropics and engulfs other spaces and locales. We are central and unacknowledged parts of the Caribbean and its diaspora, as the Puerto Rican writer Mayra Santos-­Febres (2005, 2013) has noted, in a context in which transvestism can be a strategy of survival.3 We are also nothing, like queers, like Puerto Rico, like dead or dismembered bodies, like wilted flowers, like me. For effeminate locas, like “sissies,” “nellies,” “fairies,” “faggots,” “pansies,” “queens,” and “queers” in English and bichas (or bixas) and veados and travestis in Brazilian Portuguese and folles in French and massisi in Haitian Kreyòl and batty bwoys and battymen and buller men in Jamaican Patois and West Indian English and maricas and maricones and mariquitas and mariposas and muxes and patos and pájaros and putos and vestidas in a variety of dialects of Spanish, seem to wreak havoc just by existing, but other times simply irritate, upset, and bore.4 We are like the maricas, faeries, pájaros, jotos, sarasas, apios, cancos, floras, and adelaidas that the murdered Spanish poet Federico García Lorca invoked and condemned in his renowned “Oda a Walt Whitman” (“Ode to Walt Whitman”) of 1930, where Lorca hyperbolically accused those of our kind of having “pensamiento inmundo” (filthy thoughts) and of being “murderers of doves! / Slaves of women, bitches of their dressing tables,” contrasted to the masculine camaraderie and rugged bearded persona embodied by the canonical nineteenth-­century American poet Walt Whitman: a more palatable, gender-­conforming, homosexual role model.5 Transloca disruption, geographically specific but also diasporically promiscuous, happens particularly when we don a wig, makeup, breast forms, hip and buttock pads, feminine clothes, jewelry, and high heels, or when we transform our bodies and have gender reassignment surgeries or other cosmetic procedures that change our appearance and bring forth new identities, especially when we throw ourselves onto the street, on a stage, on a movie screen or television or computer or typewritten page or into cyberspace. But it can also happen as part of casual, everyday life, simply by feigning a limp wrist, applying some lip gloss, sparkling a cheek with glitter, or speaking and singing in falsetto or in an affected way. Translocas: The Politics of Puerto Rican Drag and Trans Performance is precisely about this discomfort, about the shock we create or the banal acceptance we receive: the politics of transformation, whether as an art\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nform, a cultural representation, an embodied personal experience, or a social movement for the recognition of our basic human rights. In spite of being the object of frequent hatred and antipathy, translocas survive and carry on; we perform our lives and enjoy the performances and company of others. At times a career, an arts practice, a survival strategy, or part of the expression of a gay, queer/cuir, nonbinary, or transgender identity, the Puerto Rican loca, drag, and trans theatrical, film, literary, activist, and cabaret/nightclub performances that I am invoking with the neologism “transloca” do myriad things. Transloca performances are quite similar to but also unlike the effeminate embodiments and drag and trans performances of other groups, ethnicities, and nationalities across the globe: some absolutely shocking, other times surprisingly nondescript, as scholars such as Esther Newton ([1972] 1979), Marjorie Garber (1992), and Laurence Selenick (2000) have discussed, but here refracted through a Caribbean or “Caribglobal” lens, to use the term Rosamond S. King (2014, 1–­7) has proposed in her book Island Bodies: Transgressive Sexualities in the Caribbean Imagination, highlighting local specificities in a global context. Translocas echo the stigma and anxiety clearly expressed by Lorca and maintain the potentially dangerous edge of the word loca in Spanish, what the Argentine poet and scholar Néstor Perlongher called “loca sex” (2019, 19–­25), identified by the Chilean activists and performers Pedro Lemebel and Víctor Hugo Robles as the loca’s rupture, questioning, and destabilization of dominant norms: the oblique look that challenges hegemonic conventions (Robles 2015, 274); a practice that at times violates the law and social and religious orthodoxies and that has been met with violence and even death. Translocas also partake of what the queer Brazilian artist Hélio Oiticica called “tropicamp,” a term inspired by the Puerto Rican drag performer Mario Montez’s Caribbean-­inflected (tropical, Latin American) camp performance: a culturally specific, decidedly not Anglo-­American queer sensibility and practice that invokes a different universe of significations marked by glamour, humor, and Latin American referents.6 Translocas are also “signifying queens,” as the Cuban American scholar Oscar Montero (1998) has called Latinx queer subjects who wreak havoc and turn things upside down. This paradoxical tension between irrelevance and danger leads to simultaneous dismissal and overinvestment: swept aside because of our supposed frivolity yet simultaneously demonized as horrendous threats. Contradictions, or rather paradoxes, rule this book. While transloca\n\n4 translocas\n\nperformances (principally, acts of transformismo) are typically understood as lighthearted, inconsequential, and humorous performative gender practices, frequently those of effeminate cisgendered gay or queer/ cuir men who at times dress or perform as women or in a feminine way, referred to in Puerto Rico as transformistas, travestis, and dragas, appearing on mainstream television and theatrical stages practically every day, these embodiments can also be those of transgender or gender-­nonconforming individuals and of cisgendered women dressing in theatrical hyperfeminine attire (what Laura G. Gutiérrez [2010, 118] refers to as “same-­sex masquerade and gender parody”), or who dress in a masculine way, and are occasionally seen as highly charged, biased, or controversial representations (threatening, misogynistic, illegal, immoral, confusing, debased).7 At the simplest level, transloca performance frequently challenges hetero-­, homo-­, and transnormative gender narratives, particularly when we question expectations and social conventions about masculinity and femininity, although we are simultaneously at risk of reinscribing hegemonic models of gender and sexuality and of assimilating into neoliberal models of consumption and commercialization (Berlant 1997; Duggan 2003; Lopes 2002, 102–­3; Puar 2007; Snorton and Haritaworn 2013; Vaid 1995), for example through the uncritical participation in or reception of cultural products such as the television reality competition RuPaul’s Drag Race, a major space for Puerto Rican drag and trans representation.8 At the same time, as Latin American, Caribbean, and diasporic, colonial, queer-­and trans-­of-­color subjects, Puerto Rican translocas also negotiate local, regional, national, and transnational specificities, marked by particular histories and contexts similar to the ones explored in the rich Latin American scholarship on this topic, for example in Jean Franco’s (1999) and Nelly Richard’s articulation of a politics of difference in the performances of Francisco Casas and Pedro Lemebel, also known as the Yeguas del Apocalipsis (Mares of the Apocalypse) in Chile, or in Denilson Lopes’s (2002), Ben. Sifuentes-­Jáuregui’s (2002), Héctor Domínguez Ruvalcaba’s (2007), Laura G. Gutiérrez’s (2010), Vek Lewis’s (2010), Giuseppe Campuzano’s (2008, 2013), Miguel A. López and Fernanda Nogueira’s (2013), and Antonio Prieto Stambaugh’s (2000, 2014, 2019) nuanced discussions of the cultural representation of Latin American transvestism over many decades, but also highlighting questions of race, particularly of Blackness and of African descent.9 In its specificity and particularity, transloca performance partakes of the ser marica (being or becoming faggot) and of the inflexión marica\n\nIntroduction 5\n\n(faggot inflection) that Paco Vidarte ([2007] 2010) and Diego Falconí Trávez (2018) propose as a radical challenge to the imperialist reach of the Anglo-­American category of “gay,” similar to how Marlene Wayar (2019) and others posit travesti (and not transgénero, or transgender) as a vernacular Latin American category and critical framework, or as Wayar proposes, following D. W. Winnicott, “una teoría lo suficientemente buena” (a good-­enough theory).10 In this sense, translocas are more cuir than queer, if we understand cuir as a variant spelling of “queer” in Spanish that emerged as a way to mark a distance from the English language and from global North activist and theoretical frameworks; similarly, translocas are more travesti than transgender, following the usage of the term travesti in Latin America.11 Drag and trans performance matters to the nation and to our conceptions of Puerto Ricanness and Latinidad. In his landmark book Performance in America: Contemporary U.S. Culture and the Performing Arts (2005), the queer Latino scholar David Román highlights the centrality of drag and of other types of performance in US national debates and conceptualizations. Through varied examples, Román demonstrates the multiple ways the performing arts grapple with complex social issues that affect Americans and allow for myriad subject positions and community stances. Similarly, in his book Performing Queer Latinidad, the queer Puerto Rican scholar Ramón H. Rivera-­Servera illustrates how “performance played a critical role in the development of Latina/o public culture in the United States at the dusk of the twentieth and the dawn of the twenty-­first centuries” (2012, 6), a gesture that builds on, expands, and dialogues with José Esteban Muñoz’s (1999, 2009, 2020) and Juana María Rodríguez’s (2003, 2014) key insights on queer-­and trans-­of-­color performance and identity. Muñoz in particular was interested in drag performance as a space for the contestation of racism and nationalism, as in the work of the Chicana / African American artist Vaginal Davis (1999, 93–­115), and for challenging ethnic and sexist chauvinism, as in the Cuban American Carmelita Tropicana’s (Alina Troyano’s) drag king impersonation of the suave bus driver and ladies’ man Pingalito Betancourt (1999, 128–­35). Meanwhile, Rodríguez highlights the ways individuals are obliged to perform in certain ways for the state (for example, during asylum proceedings) or online (2003), and how artists such as the Chicana Xandra Ibarra (La Chica Boom) radically challenge conventions through their performance (2014, 148–­51). Following these scholars’ leads, I argue that Puerto Rican transloca\n\n6 translocas\n\npractices and drag and transgender performances and representations, whether on the page, stage, street, or screen, are key to understanding translocal Puerto Rican, American, Latin American, and Caribbean national imaginaries and social processes, for example, by serving as a mechanism for historical memory and for intergenerational transmission of knowledge, as when a transloca or drag performer embodies a historical figure from the past, what David Román refers to as “archival drag” (2005, 137–­78).12 Yet, as I suggested earlier through my inclusion of violent, perhaps unsettling and abject, references, the translocas I focus on also move complexly between the acknowledgment of, critical engagement with, or experience of violence, bodily decay, death, and lack of futurity (the lack of a positive envisioning of the future to come, a critical position that I do not necessarily subscribe to), counterpoised by a more utopian bent, mediated through camp humor, a political engagement with abjection as a strategy of empowerment, and an explicit acknowledgment of Puerto Rican coloniality through a queer-­and trans-­of-­color and queer and trans diasporic lens.13 Similarly, if we take the queer (or Latin American variant cuir) and trans disruptions of marica and travesti seriously, transloca performance must be understood as a political practice that challenges the status quo. Translocas: The Politics of Puerto Rican Drag and Trans Performance is an effort to apprehend this multiplicity through the exploration of very specific artistic practices (some better known, others less) in the context of translocal Puerto Rican culture, understood as one marked by colonial politics, geographical displacements, and translation. This book entails the documentation and analysis of the lives and work of a select group of cisgender and transgender artists and activists to show the very different uses they make of drag or trans performance and cultural or activist representation in Puerto Rico and in the United States. It is also about the reception of this work and its multiple meanings for diverse audiences, as well as the crónica, testimonio, or auto-­ethnographic reflection of a self-­ identified Puerto Rican transloca (a queer man, myself) who is a fan of transloca performance and who has performed in drag for over a decade. As it happens, while I was conducting this research, I was invited by the Puerto Rican drag performer, performance artist, and podcaster Fausto Fernós to appear with him and his husband Marc Felion in Cooking with Drag Queens, a user-­generated drag queen cooking show filmed in Chicago and circulated on YouTube.14 While I had painted my fingernails black and blue as an undergraduate and even worn a plaid skirt on\n\nIntroduction 7\n\noccasion, I had never really dressed in drag before, except perhaps (rather unremarkably) for a Halloween drag ball at Harvard College. The fact that I ended up performing as Lola von Miramar (my drag persona) as I wrote about drag as a recently tenured professor at the University of Michigan is not that unusual: numerous researchers, including Esther Newton (1972), Jack Halberstam (1998, 231–­66), and Leila Rupp and Verta Taylor (2003) also describe being integrated into the drag performances they were writing about, a reflection of the highly participatory nature of this art form and of its embrace of amateur practitioners; the diasporic South Asian scholar Kareem Khubchandani (2015), also known as LaWhore Vagistan, is an example of a drag queen whose performance practice is directly tied to their research and pedagogy on diasporic queer nightlife. Other scholars such as the Peruvian Giancarlo Cornejo (2019) describe a rather different case: being invited to dress in feminine clothes and accompany a female trans sex worker, or travesti, to a site of street prostitution in Lima, where a near run-­in with the police created enormous tension and put the young ethnographer’s life at risk. My drag practice has entailed similar scares, as I describe below. Practicing drag as an art form allows for a different, more nuanced appreciation, an embodied experience that can complement, expand, or transform perceptions and understandings, as I discuss in chapter 6 in relation to Jorge B. Merced. While it can make the research process more fun, it creates its own challenges, particularly given the stigma attached to drag performance in certain professional contexts, the potential transphobic violence one is exposed to, and the ways it can lead practitioners (or audiences) to question a subject’s sexual and gender identity. I have experienced these advantages and disadvantages personally, which has made the experience of appearing as Lola von Miramar enjoyable but also at times challenging. It is precisely this tension, between joy and fear, elation and violence, that is at the heart of transloca performance and of transloca lives. Translocations, Displacements, Disciplinary Fields What do transloca performances, entailing loca subjectivities, drag and trans embodiments, and varied multimedia, theatrical, and literary representations, mean in Caribbean and diasporic Puerto Rican and Latinx contexts at a moment of profound social and economic crisis, increased\n\n8 translocas\n\nmigration, transgender hypervisibility, quickly shifting public perceptions, intensified media coverage, and legal reforms?15 How do Spanish-­ language and Spanglish, Latin American, Hispanic Caribbean, and Latinx vernacular categories such as loca, draga, travesti, transformista, and vestida and neologisms such as transloca, translatina, and cuir relate to broader conceptualizations of gay, queer, drag, and transgender practices and identities in English, Spanish, and other languages such as Portuguese and French? How are all of these terms translated, if this is even possible?16 What are the limits and potentialities of cultural and linguistic translation? And how do artists, activists, and scholars fail or succeed?17 Furthermore, how do these transloca conceptualizations fit in, challenge, or dialogue with the longer tradition of scholarship on nonnormative gender identities and drag and trans performance by pioneering researchers in LGBTQ, queer of color, queer migration, queer diaspora, and Latin American and Caribbean cuir studies and with new disciplinary knowledge in the quickly expanding field of transgender studies, marked by anthologies such as the two-­volume Transgender Studies Reader published in 2006 and 2013 and by innovative peer-­reviewed journals such as TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly, established in 2014?18 And how do Puerto Rican, Nuyorican, Diasporican, and AmeRícan artists, activists, artivists, and scholars reenvision the meanings and uses of stigmatized categories such as loca, the practices of drag, and the multiplicities of “trans” as a prefix and as a noun, be it regarding the transgender, transsexual, transnational, translational, translocal, transglobal, or transglocal, a neologism that bridges the transnational, the global, and the local?19 In this book, I focus on an idiosyncratic group of Puerto Rican artists, activists, and performers who have been active since the 1960s, particularly Sylvia Rivera, Nina Flowers, Freddie Mercado, Javier Cardona, Jorge B. Merced, Erika Lopez, Holly Woodlawn, Monica Beverly Hillz, Lady Catiria, and Barbra Herr. I engage their lives and work through the lens of transloca performance in order to show how they destabilize or, to the contrary, reify dominant notions of gender, sexuality, and race, while also engaging issues of class, national identity, migratory displacement, and social justice. I also discuss a small number of transloca literary representations, including a short story by Manuel Ramos Otero; documentary films such as Paris Is Burning (1990), The Salt Mines (1990), La aguja / The Needle (2012), and Mala Mala (2014); and the murders of Jorge Steven López Mercado in 2009 and of Kevin Fret in 2019. My scholarship is enriched and in dialogue with the valuable analysis of other key\n\nIntroduction 9\n\nPuerto Rican translocas such as the flamboyant astrologer and television personality Walter Mercado (Barradas 2016; Colón-­Zayas 2012; Hedrick 2013; Taylor 2003), greatly celebrated for his style, baroque excess, and discourse of love and inclusion, who has been described as an “extravagant Puerto Rican astrologer, psychic, and gender nonconforming legend” and as a “gay Latinx icon” (Dry 2020), but also criticized for his conservative, pro-­US statehood (pro-­annexation) political views, for abusing his white privilege, and for his solidarity and friendship with right-­wing anti-­ Castro Cubans in Miami and San Juan such as Julito Labatut, who has been linked to extreme acts of violence; the astrologer is the subject of a major Netflix documentary, Mucho Mucho Amor: The Legend of Walter Mercado (Costantini and Tabsch 2020), which points, precisely, to the complex negotiations required to succeed (and survive) as an effeminate Puerto Rican entertainer, and to the ways in which a transloca performer uses costume, makeup, hairstyle, jewelry, movement, voice, and persona to create an intense relationship with audiences, who feel utterly transformed by their embrace of the artist and strive to touch him in the flesh. I also refer to the leading cabaret and theatrical drag performer Antonio Pantojas, whose work has been discussed by scholars such as Félix Jiménez (2004), Javier E. Laureano (2007, 2016), and Carlos Manuel Rivera (2014) and who served as a mentor and inspiration to contemporary performers such as Barbra Herr.20 Pantojas is a particularly interesting case as a committed leftist travesti who suffered homophobic exclusions from the pro-­independence movement (Rodríguez Martinó 1990) and who eventually stopped performing in drag due to his frustration with his limited employment opportunities (Del Valle 1995). This book is not a thorough or comprehensive history of Puerto Rican queer male effeminacy or of drag and trans performance, but rather a theorization based on historical events and on the works of very specific individuals who shed light on a broader phenomenon. These particular artists’ and activists’ lives and cultural productions allow me to reflect critically on the uses of nonhegemonic, antihomonormative, and antitransnormative queerness and of drag and trans performance for varied personal, communitarian, aesthetic, political, cultural, educational, pedagogical, and social purposes. My selection of artists, activists, and representations has to do with my own experiences meeting specific individuals and attending their performances or interacting with available documentation, be it recordings, films, works of literature, or television programs, an ephemeral and fragile archive (a “living archive of desire”) of queer and\n\n10 translocas\n\ntrans Puerto Ricanness and Latinidad (Roque Ramírez 2005, 2008); the specificities of their work; and my interest in challenging universalizing discourses that see English-­language terms such as “gay” and “queer” and even “trans” as generalizable symbols of progress and modernity, eclipsing local, vernacular conceptions.21 It also has to do with my desire to present loca and “transloca” and other terms such as marica, travesti, and cuir as unstable and dangerous categories of meaning or as optics, epistemologies, or types of praxis that can challenge and hopefully not reinscribe myriad orthodoxies and essentialisms. I bring together Puerto Rican drag and trans femininities and, on occasion, masculinities under the term “translocas” and, in some cases, transmachos and transmachas, extremely aware of how drag and trans performance are overlapping yet distinct cultural formations that should not be simply conflated. I am particularly interested in loca, drag, trans, and for that matter, transformista and travesti as temporally marked concepts that reflect particular historical moments. I am also interested in the terms’ complex relationship and contiguity, for example, how a leading figure such as the New York Intralatina Puerto Rican / Venezuelan Stonewall pioneer and community activist Sylvia Rivera self-­identified early in her life as a “drag queen,” “street queen,” and “street transvestite” (indexing her homelessness and poverty), particularly in the 1960s and early 1970s, and came to self-­identify as a trans woman by the late 1990s and early 2000s, shortly before her death.22 While not a traditional artist, Rivera’s political performances as a highly visible trans activist of color fully inform this book; Rivera is a STAR (a street transvestite action revolutionary), as in the name of the organization that she coestablished in 1970 with her friend and coconspirator, the African American Marsha P. Johnson, a light in the firmament that has led my way.23 Originally perceived as an alcohol-­ and drug-­consuming, homeless rabble-­rouser and firebrand, Rivera has come to be recognized as a national symbol in the United States, becoming the first transgender person featured at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC, where she appears in a photo by the gay Puerto Rican photographer Luis Carle with two additional trans women: Rivera’s partner Julia Murray and the Puerto Rican Stonewall veteran Cristina Hayworth, who originated the first LGBTQ march in San Juan in 1991 (see figure 1).24 Sylvia Rivera’s movement between “drag queen,” “street queen,” “transvestite,” and “trans” anticipates that of other performers I discuss, such as Holly Woodlawn and Barbra Herr. It also reflects how someone might\n\nFig. 1. Cristina Hayworth, Sylvia Rivera, and Julia Murray in New York City. Photo by Luis Carle, 2000.\n\n12 translocas\n\nhave initially presented as a drag queen in RuPaul’s Drag Race, such as the Puerto Rican Peruvian American Carmen Carrera in 2012, or as Monica Beverly Hillz did in 2013, only to eventually disclose a different self-­identification as a trans woman.25 The contiguities and confusions of drag and trans that I negotiate through the category of transloca performance are historically grounded, socially constructed, and theoretically productive and should not be simply dismissed; it is impossible to discuss drag performance without acknowledging the centrality of trans experience to this art form.26 It is also important to acknowledge how some Puerto Rican cisgender or gender-­nonconforming women, for example the San Francisco–­based Erika Lopez and Marga Gomez (who is Cuban Puerto Rican), have occasionally embraced female drag, that is to say, the campy, exaggerated, theatrical representation of femininity, as a strategy of empowerment, not to mention the phenomenon of “drag kings,” which I do not discuss at length in this book, making our conceptualization even more complex.27 Parsing Prefixes, Scrutinizing Words There is a fundamental link between sexual and gender enactments, spatial location or geography, and queer migrations and diasporas.28 In this context, the “trans-­” in transgender, transvestite, transformista, and transsexual can be productively linked to the “trans-­” in translocal, transglocal, and transnational, following Meg Wesling’s (2002) provocation in relation to the drag queens portrayed in the Cuban documentary Mariposas en el andamio (Butterflies on the Scaffold), directed by Margaret Gilpin and Luis Felipe Bernaza (1996), an earnest, low-­budget, yet very engaging film that proposes the revolutionary potential of openly gay, working-­class drag performers in Havana—­what we could call “Communist Caribbean locas”—­showcasing their everyday integration into social and cultural practices of the Cuban Revolution.29 This film led Wesling to ask, “Is the ‘trans’ in transsexual the same as the ‘trans’ in transnational?”—­a question that she reformulated in her essay “Why Queer Diaspora?” (2008).30 More recently, modernist scholar Jessica Berman (2017) has also explored this question in greater detail in her essay “Is the Trans in Transnational the Trans in Transgender?,” focusing on Virginia Woolf ’s Orlando, on the case of the Danish transsexual Lili Elbe, on US passports, on feminist science fiction, and on diasporic Indian literature, among other examples, while\n\nIntroduction 13\n\nthe trans scholar C. Riley Snorton has demonstrated how “the ‘trans-­’ in ‘transatlantic’ is not only about movements across space but also about movements across time and being, and concomitantly about movements across blackness,” particularly “the degree to which the ‘trans-­’ in transatlantic literature bears a resemblance to the ‘trans-­’ that modifies conceptions of gender,” as seen in his analysis of Three Negro Classics by Booker T. Washington, W. E. B. Du Bois, and James Weldon Johnson (2017, 107).31 Translocas: The Politics of Puerto Rican Drag and Trans Performance works through the spirit of these questions, at times directly, at others more obliquely, in the multiple and constantly shifting, variable iterations of trans vocabularies and displacements, particularly by joining the prefix “trans-­” (across, beyond, through) to the vernacular Spanish-­language sociolinguistic category of loca as a political gesture that marks multiplicity and complexity, a move that is similar to and in dialogue with the multiple (transnational, translational) examples highlighted by the scholars included in the 2016 special issue of TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly titled “Translating Transgender” and in the 2019 special issue “Trans Studies en las Américas,” coedited by Claudia Sofía Garriga-­López, Denilson Lopes, Cole Rizki, and Juana María Rodríguez.32 Historically, the prefix “trans-­” has enabled multiple key Latin American, Caribbean, and Latinx theoretical terms that account for cultural fusion and negotiations, albeit not necessarily in relation to gender and sexuality. Some of these terms include Fernando Ortiz’s ([1947] 1995) “transculturation,” Juan Flores and George Yúdice’s (1990) “transcreation,” Enrique Dussel’s (2012) “transmodernity,” Laurietz Seda’s (2009, 2018) “trans/actions” and “trans/acting,” and Guillermo Gómez-­Peña’s “transculture” (1996, 10–­12), a concept that Gómez-­Peña is actually critical of, preferring to embrace the notion of the hybrid. In counterpoint, reflections on the prefix are also at the heart of contemporary analyses of gender and sexuality, a privileged site of transgender studies, for example, the thirteen keyword essays on terms beginning with “tran-­” or “trans-­” in the inaugural issue of TSQ, including my contribution on “Translatinas/os.”33 While “trans-­” indicates a type of movement or displacement, loca, the second term that structures the title of this book, stands in its most common etymological sense for “madwoman” in Spanish, but also means “effeminate man” or “queer,” similar to English-­language usages such as “pansy,” “nelly,” “fairy,” “Mary,” and “queen” and to other Spanish-­language terms such as marica, mariquita, and maricón, which are diminutive and augmentative variations of the proper name María. Loca is a common,\n\n14 translocas\n\neveryday word, used as an insult but also in some very specific contexts as a term of endearment; while potentially disparaging and at times offensive, it also used occasionally as an in-­group marker of identity and recognition, and can also be a radical signifier of political consciousness.34 It is also a Puerto Rican folkloric category, alluding not only to every neighborhood’s or town’s effeminate man (la loca del barrio or la loca del pueblo), but also to one of the four characters in one of the archipelago’s most famous religious celebrations, las Fiestas de Santiago Apóstol (the Feast of St. James the Apostle) held annually in Loíza in late July, where the character of la Loca has traditionally been played by ostensibly masculine, heterosexual Afro–­Puerto Rican men in blackface who cross-­dress for the occasion and aggressively tease passersby, a practice that has expanded over the last several decades, to the chagrin of some, as effeminate gay men and trans women also enact the role.35 The loca is also a character in other Puerto Rican festivities such as the Ponce carnival, held before Lent, as the important folklorist Teodoro Vidal has documented (1982, 2003). “Loca” is also the name of the protagonist of Manuel Ramos Otero’s ([1980] 1992) short story “Loca la de la locura” and of the main character in Ángel Lozada’s (2006) novel No quiero quedarme sola y vacía, a hallucinating narrative in which the protagonist has a relationship with another loca and constantly verges on the precipice of madness.36 Loca is a very particular word, in a context where words matter. And, as the queer Filipino-­American anthropologist Martin F. Manalansan IV (2003) incisively demonstrated in his discussions of the transnational, diasporic traveling of queer Tagalog and English-­language terms such as bakla, beauty, and diva, words are not necessarily translatable; they acquire new and shifting meanings in their transoceanic crossings and carry a specific universe of queer significations. With the neologism “transloca,” I link the stigmatized category of male homosexuality and effeminate male behavior and, with greater care, female transgender performance, to that of women’s madness or subversion, as well as to geography and space, especially to contemporary discussions of translocality.37 I differ in some ways from the Cuban American scholar Sonia E. Alvarez (2014), who summarized the work of a group of researchers working in translation who also used the term “transloca” in their anthology Translocalities/Translocalidades to self-­identify as transnational Latin American and US Latina feminists; as I explain in more detail in chapter 1, my effort is closer to that of the queer Chicano scholar Lionel Cantú Jr., who first proposed its use to the Transnational Feminist Politics of Translation research group with a queer camp feminist inflection.38\n\nIntroduction 15\n\nIn my conceptualization, translocas and translocura (transmadness, transqueenness, transfaggotry) can be seen as new social formations and identity positions and as a radical (ludic) performance modality, but also as the site of violence, social marginalization, and death. I have used the word “transloca” since 2002 to make sense (or nonsense) and to organize (or disorganize) the rather different and multiplying iterations of Puerto Rican drag, transgender, and loca experience and performance, here and elsewhere, across boundaries and genres and historical timeframes. Numerous artists and activists have used drag and transgender performance to challenge, reconceptualize, and transcend gender roles and sexual identities in the Americas, to present new forms of masculinity and femininity, and to envision non-­gender-­binary identities and practices. Drag and trans performance has also served as a form of employment. Others have used drag and trans performance as a way to create a crisis of interpretation that confuses and destabilizes expected ideals, and leads to different realms, such as the nature of androgyny; the relationship of the large body and of excess to femininity; the blurring or hypervisibilization of racial distinction; the issue of racial and class prejudice; the role of art and audience participation; and the question of what is human, what is animal or nonanimal, and what is divine. Transnational and Translocal Puerto Rican Contexts The Puerto Rican “transnation,” seen as a sociopolitical and cultural sphere, extends well beyond the geographic confines of the Caribbean—­ that is to say, beyond the Puerto Rican archipelago, including the island of Puerto Rico and the smaller inhabited island municipalities of Vieques and Culebra—­to include the diaspora, where the bulk of the Puerto Rican population currently resides.39 Currently, there are over eight million Puerto Ricans, including more than five million in the diaspora, constituting the second-­largest Latinx group in the United States. Historically, Puerto Rican diasporic populations settled mostly in the US Northeast, extending from Boston to Philadelphia, particularly in the metropolitan areas of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, but also including sites in the Midwest such as northeastern Ohio and the Chicago region, as well as more distant locations such as California and Hawaii. More recently, this diaspora has centered primarily in Florida, especially in the Orlando and Tampa metropolitan regions, with continuing migration to historic sites as well as to Texas, the US Virgin Islands, and the Dominican Repub-\n\n16 translocas\n\nlic.40 This scenario has only been amplified recently as a result of a profound and long-­standing economic crisis and of natural catastrophes such as Hurricanes Irma and María in 2017; multiple devastating earthquakes in 2020; and the coronavirus pandemic (Rosa and Robles 2020).41 As Juan Flores, Jorge Duany, and other scholars have shown, the links of continuity between these multiple spaces are numerous, although it is also important to recognize the particularities and differences of each.42 Inversely, as Duany (2002) and Yolanda Martínez-­San Miguel (2003) have argued, migration to Puerto Rico from other countries, especially from Cuba and the Dominican Republic, but also from Latin America, the United States, and the French-­and English-­speaking Caribbean, and reverse or return migration of US Puerto Ricans back to the island have historically made the island itself a multiethnic and, to a limited extent, multilingual and multidialectal society. Thus, when one speaks of Puerto Rican as well as of global culture, it is necessary to account for this translocal condition, that is to say, the knowledge and experience of inhabiting different spaces and of being in intimate contact with diverse communities at multiple locations.43 Scholars such as Elizabeth M. Aranda, César J. Ayala, Rafael Bernabe, Jorge Duany, Ramón Grosfoguel, Agustín Lao-­Montes, Frances Negrón-­ Muntaner, and Mayra Santos-­Febres have highlighted the historical, political, and affective framework for contemporary Puerto Rican translocality.44 Lao-­Montes (1997, 176), for example, invokes Benedict Anderson’s (1992) concept of “imagined communities” and Henri Lefebvre’s (1991) notion of “social space” as a way “to imagine the Puerto Rican community as a translocal social space (a transnation),” recognizing the dense interconnections of Puerto Ricans who live dispersed across geographical locations due to colonial processes and the specific structures that anchor these connections. Expanding Lao-­Montes’s analysis, I contend that the drag and trans embodiments that I read under the optic of transloca performance create, challenge, and disorganize these translocal “imagined communities” (envisioned as cohesive groups based on shared affinities and experiences) and social spaces (that is to say, spaces constituted through social relations and conceptualizations). Translocality can be defined as the interlinked experiences of persons in diverse geographic locations, whether in the country of origin or in the diaspora, who nevertheless are in complex and constant daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly contact, be it through travel, migration, communications, or other forms of exchange; who live in the intimacy of these inter-\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nactions and of the knowledge they generate; who might not even be living in different sovereign nations, but rather in different locations marked by profound linguistic and cultural differences in the same nation-­state, for example as diasporic metropolitan subjects vis-­à-­vis colonial, insular ones.45 Translocality entails a multiplicity of knowledges, family and other personal connections, economic and cultural remittances (Flores 2009), and actual physical displacements. It is a more intimate form of connection than what we usually associate with the transnational, closer to what we could call transcolonial, perhaps similar to what Yolanda Martínez-­ San Miguel (2014) has termed, following Aníbal Quijano, “coloniality of diasporas,” referring to the recurrent and complex exchanges between present and former colonies and their colonial metropoles, a situation that emulates Ramón Grosfoguel’s (2003) analysis of Puerto Rico following a world-­systems theory model. Theater, performance, film, literature, music, and other arts have been profoundly affected by this translocal reality and have reflected this phenomenon extensively. Theater scholar Lowell Fiet (1997), for example, has referred to Puerto Rican dramatic arts as a “puente aéreo entre ambas orillas” (an air bridge between both shores).46 The development of queer Puerto Rican sexualities has also been deeply marked by this experience, as Puerto Ricans have become part of a much broader wave of queer and trans diasporas, and Puerto Rican social formations have been caught up in processes of globalization, including gay or LGBTQ liberation, queer tourism, capitalist commodification, and rising transgender visibility.47 In Translocas, I link traditional and innovative conceptions of performance, place, gender, and sexuality and bring them together with migratory spatial analysis as a way to question and rethink the meanings of these concepts. In fact, the very terms “gay,” “queer,” and “transgender” already assume unstable positions and categories within the wide range of that which is understood as masculine, feminine, androgynous, nonbinary, indeterminate, or in between; of hetero-­, homo-­, bi-­, and pansexual attractions; of perversions and the most commonly accepted stereotypes and assumptions within the sphere of the sexual. More importantly, we must consider the particularities of Boricua or Puerto Rican sexuality, with its ample repertoire of terms in English and Spanish entailing greater or lesser pejorative connotations, which include standard and nonstandard vernacular terms such as pato (literally a duck, but used figuratively to refer to a homosexual or effeminate man), pata (lesbian or masculine woman), maricón, afeminado, ponca, loca, travesti, vestida, bugarrón,\n\n18 translocas\n\nmarimacho, marimacha, tortillera, bucha, papi chulo, banjee, butch queen, femme queen, and thug.48 The term “transloca” engages with and complicates this list. What (or Who) Are Translocas? Translocas are many things, contradictory ones, to be sure: performers, innovators, marginals, exiles, eccentrics, troublemakers, lovers, loners, and friends who live in a transnational/translocal context marked by cultural, racial, and linguistic mixtures and juxtapositions.49 To be a transloca is to tread a dangerous ground, to make and break allegiances, and to redefine meanings and sensibilities. It is potentially to disidentify as an active practice of cultural and political contestation in the sense advanced by José Esteban Muñoz (1999), who argued that the disidentificatory practices of queer persons of color entail complex, strategic negotiations of power through the selective adscription and rejection of normative identities and practices. As Muñoz stated, “Disidentification is the third mode of dealing with dominant ideology, one that neither opts to assimilate within such a structure nor strictly opposes it; rather, disidentification is a strategy that works on and against dominant ideology” (1999, 11). Translocas also operate in the realm of “queer futurity,” the spaces of possibility for envisioning a potential world to come or utopia: “Queerness is that thing that lets us feel that this world is not enough, that indeed something is missing” (Muñoz 2009, 1).50 They also engage the “theories in practice” of home, hope, utopia, and friction that Ramón H. Rivera-­Servera (2012) presents as part of the daily lives and strategies of resistance that queer Latinxs engage in as part of convivencia diaria (daily encounters and shared experiences), a term Rivera-­Servera borrows from the ethnographers Milagros Ricourt and Ruby Danta (2002). Finally, translocas negotiate the “politics of representation, identity, location, and affinity” that Alberto Sandoval-­ Sánchez and Nancy Saporta Sternbach (2001, 4) identify as crucial to Latinx theater and performance, particularly when viewed through the lens of Latin American theories of transculturation. What do the many performers, artists, and activists that I bring together in this book think of the label “transloca”? There is no doubt that these individuals could not be more different from one another and that, in fact, some are not thrilled by this neologism. For this reason, it might be more useful to think of transloca performance (a type of action) as a cuir,\n\nIntroduction 19\n\nmarica, or travesti modality, one that is not necessarily bound to specific (racially or nationally marked) bodies, more than to think of transloca as an identity; it is a praxis that can account for contradiction, hybridization, and resistance. Hopefully, “transloca” is a mutable and expansive or capacious concept that can account for variations and different national contexts; for example, the American scholar Jacqueline Loss (2013, 51–­60) has found the term useful to discuss the work of the Cuban writer and drag performer Pedro Manuel González Reinoso, also known as Roxy and as La Rusa Roxana Rojo (the Russian Roxana the Red), and the American scholar Camilla Stevens (2019, 94) frames her analysis of the Dominican performer Waddys Jáquez’s P.A.R.G.O.: Los pecados permitidos (2001) in relation to translocas, while the Brazilian photographer Evna Moura (2013) has used the word to title her series of photos about Brazilian drag queens and queer people at the “Festa da Chiquita,” a LGBTQ event that forms part of the annual Círio de Nazaré religious procession in Belém do Pará.51 At times, I have felt that my theorization might be more a critical-­ interpretive fantasy of mine, that of the transloca scholar and artist: Lola von Miramar’s delusions. Nevertheless, I have found it useful to compare multiple artists and activists in relation to the historically important but also culturally and geographically specific concept of transculturation. For the Cuban ethnographer Fernando Ortiz ([1947] 1995), cultures that come in contact do not necessarily erase or substitute each other, but rather find a dynamic balance—­at times mediated through profound violence—­in which elements of each persist but, more importantly, are transformed and coexist as a new formation; transculturation, seen as “the merging and converging of cultures,” serves as an alternative or corrective to the American sociological term “assimilation” (Ramírez 2017, 16). While Ortiz was most interested in the particular situation of Cuba, specifically in the coming together of European and African influences that he symbolized through the metaphor of ajiaco (a rich stew with many diverse ingredients), I will focus on a translocal Puerto Rican context in which transnational Indigenous, African, Hispanic, and Anglo-­American elements predominate, and where new notions of sexuality and space have radically transformed people’s understandings of self.52 And while the Cuban ethnographer clearly felt that European (and, need we say, heterosexual) culture was superior and would dominate the mix, I have the suspicion that in the Puerto Rican case, all bets are off. I propose that we see the prefix “trans-­” at the core of transformation—­ change, the power or ability to mold, reorganize, reconstruct, construct—­\n\n20 translocas\n\nand transgeographical, as in the transcontinental, transatlantic, transhemispheric, and transarchipelagic, but also transversal, oblique, and not direct. This transgeneric transitoriness implies several challenges to dominant notions of Puerto Ricanness that do not accept migration—­the migrant diasporic community and/or immigrants in Puerto Rico—­or queer sexualities and alternative gender identities. It can also be associated with the transgression of mediums or artistic genres that Francisco José Ramos (1998) identified as part of the “poetics of experimentation” that marks the artistic production of a number of contemporary visual artists such as Freddie Mercado, a modality of experimentation that the art historian Haydee Venegas (1998) referred to as travestismo (transvestism). It also has to do, as previously mentioned, with the conceptual and terminological instability Meg Wesling (2002) has hinted at and with queer ethnographer Marcia Ochoa’s (2008) playful theorization of loca-­lization as the confluence of queer sexuality, space, and place among Venezuelan drag queens and transgender women in Caracas. Loca, in its own right, also suggests a form of hysterical identity, pathologized at the clinical level, scandalous at the popular one, constitutive of the individual lacking sanity, composure, or ascription to dominant norms: effeminate homosexuals, madwomen, rebels for any cause; marginalized categories that in an ironic and playful gesture I wish to resemanticize in the style of and in resistance to the Anglo-­American term “queer”: loca, as maricón (faggot) friends calls one another, as a sign of complicity and understanding, of being entendidos (those in the know, in the life), and not necessarily as a hostile insult, joke, or putdown, although perhaps that too, if one is to do justice to cruelty as an art or strategy for survival, or simply, as an acknowledgment of self-­hatred; loca as the felicitous yet critical, perhaps decolonial coming-­together of Susan Sontag’s “Notes on Camp” (1964), Esther Newton’s Mother Camp: Female Impersonators in America (1972, 1979), and Denilson Lopes’s “Terceiro manifesto camp” (2002, 89–­ 120), with the good graces of Judith Butler (1990), Marjorie Garber (1992), Arnaldo Cruz-­Malavé (1995), and Ben. Sifuentes-­Jáuregui (2002), as a high-­camp extravaganza, or as a homage to the drag house system portrayed in the documentary Paris Is Burning (1990) as well as in the television reality competition RuPaul’s Drag Race (2009–­2021) and in the more recent TV series Pose (2018–­2019), all with a cuir Latin American loca and marica inflection (Falconí Trávez 2018; Perlongher 2019). The performative character of this transloca condition is reflected in\n\nIntroduction 21\n\nthe transvestic game, which occurs with greater ease in the sphere of social interaction but also extends into theory and literature, as the Cuban writer Severo Sarduy (1982) demonstrated in his essays on simulation and in his multiple experimental 1960s and 1970s novels, populated by drag queens as they were.53 By performative, I am referring to verbal and bodily enactments brought forth through public repetitions in real life and on the stage or space of artistic representation, following Judith Butler’s elaborations in Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (1990), where the feminist philosopher expanded J. L. Austin’s theorizations of linguistic performative utterances, which is to say, of words that do things, to account for the social construction of gender via naturalized, reiterative everyday practices.54 “Transvestic game,” in turn, accounts for the knowledge of the artificiality, or more correctly, the arbitrary nature of the classification of signs, whether racial, ethnic, sexual, gender, class, or motile, and the possibility for their manipulations and reinventions or contestations, at least according to a writer such as Sarduy. The performers, artists, activists, and artivists in question, in different ways and at different moments, allude to or incarnate this sphere, as gendered and sexed bodies marked by race, ethnicity, class, age, and unorthodox desire, and located voluntarily or involuntarily in varied geographical contexts. Becoming Lola: Self-­Reflexivity and Drag I too have now become a diasporic, translocal, and exaggeratedly bilingual Midwestern transloca, a writer and college professor who occasionally performs in drag on stage and online. While I have lived in Michigan since 2003, it is fair to say that I was already a loca long before I ever donned my first wig. My first appearance as Lola von Miramar at the behest of Fausto Fernós and Marc Felion of the Feast of Fun podcast in 2010, specifically for their Cooking with Drag Queens YouTube series, has led me to learn a lot more about the practice of drag than I ever envisioned, ranging from the intricacies of makeup, feminine clothing, and jewelry to the subtleties of girdles, padding, hosiery, and wigs, not to mention lip-­synch, choreography, and onstage humor.55 As I am not an ethnographer or professionally trained as a theater practitioner, I initially approached drag and transgender performance strictly as an audience member, reader, film viewer, and critic—­a privileged white or light-­skinned Latinx loca one, to be sure;\n\n22 translocas\n\nFig. 2. Marc Felion, Lola von Miramar, and Fausto Fernós on the set of Cooking with Drag Queens, Chicago, 2015. Photo by Fausto Fernós.\n\none who was initially taught to conduct literary and cultural analysis, who later became immersed in performance studies and who appraised performances, trying to understand what went into them. While it is certainly not necessary to practice an art form in order to understand it or to relate to it psychically and to internalize it as constitutive of one’s subjectivity (Lopes 2002, 67–­88), there are some advantages, and I hope that my explicitly and implicitly performative experiences enrich the discussions that I offer in the pages to come. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, there is a long tradition of having the researcher “drag it up,” whether by dressing or performing in drag or assisting with the drag show, at least since the appearance of Esther Newton’s pioneering Mother Camp in 1972. Similarly, in Female Masculinity, Jack Halberstam (1998) describes attending and being invited to compete in drag king contests in New York City, while lesbian feminist scholars Leila Rupp and Verta Taylor (2003) describe performing in drag as part of the research process for their ethnography of the 801 Cabaret in Key West, Florida. The sociologist Joshua Gamson (1998, 139–­40), on the other hand, begins a chapter on transgen-\n\nIntroduction 23\n\nder participation on television talk shows by discussing a personal experience in which his dressing in drag with seven friends in San Francisco created significant anxiety for those who encountered them in public. And in their master’s thesis “‘Estar perra es la onda’: Arte, escena y miradas drag en la Ciudad de México,” the Puerto Rican scholar Jaime Géliga Quiñones (2016) describes the process of becoming-­drag (devenir draga) as one of going “De Jaime el investigador a Juanita Caminante la drag tropical” (From Jaime the researcher to Juanita the Wanderer, Tropical Drag Queen) (48–­51), including photo documentation of their transformation. A different example is that of African American gay or self-­described “butch queen” ethnographer Marlon M. Bailey (2013), who made walking a category in a ball in search of a prize a central focus of his methodological approach to exploring the Black LGBTQ and drag ballroom scene, as described in his book Butch Queens Up in Pumps: Gender, Performance, and Ballroom Culture in Detroit. In this case, Bailey performed in professional masculine business attire and envisioned himself as an insider/ outsider, highlighting his embrace of Dwight Conquergood’s concept of “coperformative witness” (a dynamic relationship between researcher and the subjects traditionally identified as informants or ethnographic subjects), also identifying scholar and performer E. Patrick Johnson (2003) as a role model for engaged and participatory critical performance studies scholarship; Rivera-­Servera (2012, 19) also embraces Conquergood’s term. I too have become a coperformative witness of sorts, as well as an occasional “butch queen up in pumps” (a queer-­of-­color man in drag), at times more actively involved in actual performances, on other occasions as an audience member that shares his enthusiasm and joy, frequently through a notably loud, disruptive laugh. The exhilaration of performance is addictive; the pleasures of audience interaction are extremely fulfilling. Performing in drag, perhaps all performance, entails becoming an/other, embodying a self-­projection that is different from oneself, where the self is temporarily suspended or intensified, similar to donning a mask and truly transforming into the character, falling into a performative trance that displaces regular subjectivity with a heightened, alternative one. This book is a reflection on drag and transgender performance as an artistic practice, a form of entertainment, a catalyst for community growth, and a mechanism of self-­expression; it is a reflection that surges from the experience of being a devout fan of drag and trans performance (one who adores the artists on the dance floor or stage or screen, and who performs the quite dramatic, over-­the-­top iden-\n\n24 translocas\n\ntity of a fan) as much as from the experience of becoming a bona fide performer. It is also a chronicle of the fear of violence and rejection, of the anguish produced by the possibility that one will be attacked for dressing in drag (Cornejo 2019) or for being a trans person or an effeminate man or a loca, and of paranoid anxiety regarding difficult or challenging personal and professional relations with femmephobic or transphobic individuals. I have experienced these fears firsthand, for example in Buenos Aires in 2013, when anonymous individuals (apparently hotel employees) aggressively harassed me late at night on the phone inquiring about a transcomunicador (transcommunicator), perhaps believing I was a trans sex worker, after I returned from an event in full costume, which led me to barricade myself in my room and to relive in my mind anti-­loca dictatorship-­era-­like scenes of violence of the type that Néstor Perlongher (2019) has described, and that I associated with the gay political thriller Apartment Zero (1988, dir. Martin Donovan). Ironically, I was staying at the Bauen Hotel, a site recuperated by workers after the Argentinean financial collapse of 2001, to attend the ninth biennial meeting of the International Association for the Study of Sexuality, Culture and Society (IASSCS), and had just performed at the conference’s party held at the historic Club Español, an ornate art nouveau-­inspired Catalan modernist-­style building located on Bernardo de Irigoyen Street in the historic center region. It seems that having hundreds of hotel guests who researched topics related to sexuality was not advantageous for this Puerto Rican drag queen, who got clocked and intimidated when she got home. This anecdote is trivial compared to the physical aggression and lethal violence routinely experienced by effeminate men and trans women across the globe, but my fear was real and has marked my research process. This and other experiences (for example, having a senior colleague in the profession, now deceased, feign surprise at seeing me dressed in masculine clothes, when he assumed I was now transgender; or having to explain to a gay, masculine-­oriented potential sexual partner that I perform in drag; or shaving my facial hair off and seeing how it changes and demasculinizes my appearance, an awkward experience for someone who is attracted to bearded gay men referred to as “bears”) have led me to embrace the Chicana lesbian writer Cherríe Moraga’s conceptualization of “theory in the flesh,” a critical practice grounded in personal experience and life history.56 “Theory in the flesh” implies recognizing that knowledge is created from lived experience as much as from scholarly research and philosophical reflection. As Moraga indicates, “A theory in the flesh\n\nIntroduction 25\n\nmeans one where the physical realities of our lives—­our skin color, the land or concrete we grew up on, our sexual longings—­all fuse to create a politic born out of necessity” (Moraga and Anzaldúa 1983, 23).57 It suggests a very particular type of investment in knowledge that recognizes its everyday impacts and social and political ramifications. It signals a deep commitment that comes from phenomenological experience (knowledge filtered through the body and the senses) or from what the Chicana scholar Stephanie Fetta describes as a somatic transaction or corporeal process engaging the “soma—­the perceptive and expressive body” (2018, 2) as much as from analytic thought. My book is foremost an argument for Puerto Rican transloca performance or translocura as an epistemology, a way of seeing the world, and a cause for shifting the way we see: a potentially radical tool for expanding perception and understanding. It is also a discussion of an art form and practice that I have come to embody and better understand, and the nuanced appraisal of very specific individuals with very concrete artistic, political, and cultural experiences. Book Structure In the chapters that follow I trace the heterogeneity of Puerto Rican transloca performance. In chapter 1, I engage queer and feminist theoretical debates on the term loca, particularly in the social sciences and in creative literature, as a way to contextualize how the broader fields of Latin American, Latinx, LGBTQ, and women’s, gender, and sexuality studies have focused on these issues, highlighting the profound disagreements about the term’s usefulness, paying particular attention to complex recuperations of the word. Given the stresses of anti-­Black racism, misogyny, ableism, xenophobia, femmephobia, transphobia, and homophobia, not everyone is excited to recuperate or engage the term loca. In chapter 2, I go on to posit Puerto Rican transloca performance as an epistemology or critical and experiential method that oscillates between joy and death, highlighting three examples: the transnational success of the light-­skinned drag performer Nina Flowers (Jorge Flores), who appeared on RuPaul’s Drag Race in 2009; the brutal murder of the aspiring young fashion designer and makeup artist Jorge Steven López Mercado that same year; and the songs and videos of the assassinated trap singer Kevin Fret, who was known for his fearless celebration of loca alterity and\n\n26 translocas\n\nwas killed in 2019. Here, I contrast Nina Flowers’s joyful recuperation of loca and her effusive transloca performance to the radical violence that marked the end of López Mercado’s and Fret’s lives, but also to López Mercado’s and Fret’s differential articulation of self. Subsequently, in chapter 3, I document how drag and trans performance became a strategy for combating the violence of poverty and the stigma associated with the phrase “welfare queen” in the work of the Afro-­ Puerto Rican writer and performer Erika Lopez, the light-­skinned actress and cabaret star Holly Woodlawn, and the Black trans performer Monica Beverly Hillz, juxtaposing their experiences to the life and activism of Stonewall veteran Sylvia Rivera. I posit the transloca drag of poverty as a tactic of resistance that embraces humor, anger, glamour, parody, and political discourse to overcome social marginalization and impoverishment, frequently marked by anti-­Black bias. Additional chapters home in on specific performers. In chapter 4, I analyze drag as a sociocultural and cognitive disruption and historical archive (the ultrabaroque drag of rasanblaj), focusing on the light-­skinned performance artist Freddie Mercado through the framework of rasanblaj (reassembly) and the ultrabaroque. I highlight Mercado’s visual arts practice (painting, sculpture, installation, and performance art) and his historical reenactments of the famous mayor of San Juan, doña Fela (Felisa Rincón de Gautier), and of the renowned singer, composer, and television host Myrta Silva, as well as his hybrid, comical, and at times grotesque, abject, or monstrous creations, emphasizing the centrality of collaboration, improvisation, and recycling in his work. I am particularly interested in Mercado’s questioning and challenging of the borders of race, ethnicity, gender, sex, and the human in relation to nonhuman animals, monsters, and divinities, including his critical approach to matters of Afrodiasporic life and experience, and the artist’s negotiations of poverty and bias. In chapter 5, I propose the transloca drag of race as a framework to understand the dancer and actor Javier Cardona’s political intervention denouncing anti-­Black racism, reading his piece You Don’t Look Like . . . (1996) as a rescripting of the Snow White fairy tale in which Cardona becomes the Evil Queen as a means to challenge the exclusions of Afro–­ Puerto Ricans from the media industry. I see Cardona engaging and questioning folkloric transloca traditions and using popular music, parodic blackface, mirrors, photographic images, performative objects, audience interaction, confessional storytelling, and choreography to make a crucial antiracist statement.\n\nIntroduction 27\n\nIn chapter 6, I highlight transloca performance, drag embodiment, and music (particularly the genre of the bolero) as tools of identity building and community building in the diaspora. Here, I focus on the light-­ skinned actor and director Jorge B. Merced and the Pregones Theater of the Bronx’s 1997 play El bolero fue mi ruina (The Bolero Was My Downfall), an adaptation of Manuel Ramos Otero’s short story “Loca la de la locura” (“The Queen of Madness”). I contend that Merced’s life experiences, particularly his processes of transloca approximation and transloca incorporation (a type of “theory in the flesh”), are crucial elements that determine the success of this theatrical production, in which storytelling and lip-­synching boleros serves to affirm cuir and travesti diasporic Latinx identity and community. Finally, in chapter 7, I take a slightly different approach, highlighting two light-­skinned New York–­based Puerto Rican transgender performers: Lady Catiria and Barbra Herr. I see the hormonally and surgically modified body of Lady Catiria and her 1990s weekly performances at La Escuelita nightclub in New York City as works of art, highlighting the artistic value of lip-­synch and of burlesque performance and their potential for creating community. I also discuss Lady Catiria’s 1996 embrace of AIDS activism, particularly as a participant in the Miss Continental Pageant in Chicago. I then focus on the language-­and music-­centered cabaret and theatrical enactments of Barbra Herr, particularly Herr’s one-­woman show Trans-­mission (2017), highlighting her impassioned plea for social transformation and acceptance. In the epilogue, I reflect on this journey and offer additional thoughts on the current status of transloca representation and performance.\n\none\n\nTheorizing la Loca Feminist and Queer Debates ¿Qué le falta a lo queer para que se convierta en locura, al estilo latinoamericano, estilo Perlongher, Lemebel o Arenas? Le hace falta raza, clase, le falta realidad social y política, y, al parecer, le falta amor. —­Paola Arboleda Ríos (2011)\n\nLocas produce drama, disagreement, and anger, and suffer social exclusion and marginalization, even when they can also entertain audiences and challenge authority.1 While key queer Latin American writers such as the Argentine Néstor Perlongher, the Chilean Pedro Lemebel, and the Cuban Reinaldo Arenas provocatively recuperated and deployed the term loca in their essays, fiction, and poetry as a term of radical alterity in the late twentieth century, others have been more resistant, notwithstanding the (at the time closeted) Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin’s 1999 exhortation for us to embrace “Livin’ la Vida Loca.”2 Some rebellious gender-­ nonconforming women have also claimed the term. For example, multiple women graffiti writers in the Americas identified as “graffiti grrlz” by Jessica Nydia Pabón-­Colón (2016, 2018) proudly call themselves locas at the same time that they resist the label of “feminists” and engage in women-­ centered praxis. In her essay “To(o) Queer the Writer—­Loca, escritora y chicana,” the woman-­of-­color feminist Gloria Anzaldúa ([1991] 2009) indicates how the word loca is closer to her experiences as a working-­class, South Texas Chicana than the term “lesbian,” which is monopolized by white women who are not attentive to the particularities of race, language, and class. And in his Locas comics (part of the Love and Rockets series), the Chicano artist Jaime Hernández (2004) carefully conveys the lives of complex Chicana gender-­nonconforming queer women.3 28\n\nTheorizing la Loca 29\n\nThere are complex and wide-­ranging tensions regarding the uses of loca or la loca in Latin American, Caribbean, and Latinx feminist and gender and sexuality studies, where scholars have expressed mixed feelings about its efficacy, and concerns about its disappearance, eclipsed by the global adoption of English-­language terms such as “queer” and “gay.” In this chapter, I work through these productive tensions, analyzing cases from diverse academic fields and from a range of countries and regions, as a way to situate and better understand the Puerto Rican artists and activists I discuss in the rest of the book. Normative Spanish-­language sources such as the Diccionario de la lengua española of the Real Academia Española (RAE) indicate the challenges and ambiguity of loca.4 While the signifier clearly has a queer meaning—­ concretely, the current tenth entry as hombre homosexual afeminado, or “effeminate homosexual man,” a 2018 revision to the former rather incomplete definition as hombre homosexual, or homosexual man (RAE 2001), which conflated the effeminate gender expression that characterizes the loca with same-­sex sexual activity—­Puerto Rican translocas undoubtedly contaminate ourselves with the term’s additional significations: que ha perdido la razón (one who has lost the use of reason); de poco juicio, disparatado e imprudente (of little judgment, crazy and reckless); que excede en mucho a lo ordinario o presumible (that far exceeds the ordinary or presumed); mujer informal y ligera en sus relaciones con los hombres (a woman who is informal and light in her relationships with men); prostituta (prostitute)—­that is to say, assuming that the queer or cuir loca has not evacuated her locura or lost her Spanish-­language or Latin American specificity, whether because of migration or normativization. Locas preoccupy, cause concern, and disconcert, similar to the way Anglo-­American, Latinx, queer-­of-­color, and Canadian faggots do, as the writer and activist Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore (2012) brilliantly demonstrates in Why Are Faggots So Afraid of Faggots?, a volume in which a variety of contributors challenge mainstream, assimilationist LGBTQ conceptions. As the title page indicates, Sycamore’s book poses “flaming challenges to masculinity, objectification, and the desire to conform.” Sycamore describes their volume as “an emergency intervention” edited by “a genderqueer faggot and a queen with a certain amount of notoriety [who is] incredibly inspired by the politics and potentials of trans, genderqueer, and gender-­defiant culture” (2012, 2). The recuperation of the term “faggots,” also visible in Larry Mitchell’s 1977 fable/manifesto The Faggots and Their Friends between Revolutions (but strongly resisted in\n\n30 translocas\n\nLarry Kramer’s 1978 sex-­negative novel Faggots), is linguistically specific, temporally marked, and meaningful in the United States (and Canada) in very particular contexts in the late 1970s and early 2000s but also in the 2017 “Faggot Manifesto” presented by the SPIT! (Sodomites, Perverts, Inverts Together!) collective formed by the artist Carlos Motta, the writer and curator John Arthur Peetz, and the artist Carlos María Romero, which seeks to reclaim the term, affirming: “A faggot is not a corporation. A faggot is not a polite citizen. A faggot is not a commodity to be traded. A faggot is not sanitary. A faggot is not just a rich white gay man” (SPIT! 2017, 6). In France, it is folles (the French equivalent of locas, referring to madwomen and effeminate male homosexuals) as a term and an identity or practice, as in the celebrated play, musical, and film La Cage aux Folles, who disquiet and who have been recuperated as transgressive signifiers of queer political resistance, as Jean-­Yves Le Talec (2008) explores in his very insightful and carefully researched Folles de France: Repenser l’homosexualité masculine. In his book, Le Talec highlights the French liberationist group Les Gazolines as well as the political and cultural interventions of the Sœurs de la Perpétuelle Indulgence, the French equivalent of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a street performance group that uses drag and religious attire as part of its social critique (Fitzsimons 2019). Meanwhile, in some Spanish-­speaking contexts, the term that has been mobilized as a sign of queer/cuir alterity and activism is marica. For example, in the introduction of his Ética marica (Marica Ethics), the Spanish cuir philosopher and activist Paco Vidarte expresses his desire that his book serve as “un interruptor. Un dispositivo que corta la corriente,” that is to say, as a switch or device that cuts off electric power ([2007] 2010, 9); he understands the marica subject as one who rejects the fascist legacy of Franco’s dictatorship and who questions and challenges assimilationist gay imperatives under democracy.5 For Vidarte, the anarchic power of marica as a posture, which he invokes together with bollos (lesbians) and trans subjects, is to disrupt and serve as an anticapitalist, antibourgeois cog in the system, engaging in a type of “política perra” (bitch politics) that wanders, nomad-­like, as if inspired by the radical theorists Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari (1986b), without a clear destination in mind. In his Nación marica: Prácticas culturales y crítica activista (Marica Nation: Cultural Practices and Activist Critique), the Chilean author Juan Pablo Sutherland references the American direct-­action group Queer Nation and invokes Néstor Perlonguer’s essay “Matan a un marica” (“They Kill a Marica”),\n\nTheorizing la Loca 31\n\nreading the sign marica as a “lugar de castigo, privilegio de asesinato y genocidio permanente en una identidad bastarda” (a site of punishment, an entitlement to permanent murder and genocide in a bastard identity) (2009, 23). Fellow Chilean Pedro Lemebel, meanwhile, appealed to a mariconaje guerrero or warrior faggotry (quoted in Arboleda Ríos 2011, 114–­ 16). Finally, in the anthology Inflexión marica: Escrituras del descalabro gay en América Latina (Marica Inflection: Writings of Gay Breakdown in Latin America), the Ecuadorian lawyer and literary scholar Diego Falconí Trávez identifies loca, marica, and lo cuir as some of the diverse fragmented and localized ways of signifying sex-­gender difference in Latin America, indicating that they are “tres muestras de la imposibilidad (incluso el peligro) de pensar una América Latina uniforme desde la política sexual” (three samples of the impossibility—­in fact, the danger—­of thinking a uniform Latin America in relation to sexual politics) (2018, 10). It is not only faggots, fairies, sissies, folles, maricas, and queers, or rather, homonormative, assimilationist gays and transnormative individuals who fear or distance themselves from locura (referring to madness or queerness); some feminists also reject this position, particularly when understood as a pathology or stigmatizing status that marks women. Divided or mixed assessments also appear within Latin American and Latinx queer studies, where loca has mostly received a positive valorization from scholars such as Marcia Ochoa, Horacio Federico Sívori, María Amelia Viteri, Susana Peña, and Salvador Vidal-­Ortiz, but also been labeled as a problematic or undesirable term. Ultimately, Perlongher’s, Lemebel’s, and Arenas’s commitment to loca and its use by countless others substantiate broader claims to the relevance and value of this word. Latina Feminist Concerns and the Queer Feminist Origins of “Translocas” There is an inherent tension in the way the Spanish-­language term loca circulates among Latin American and Latinx women and among some feminists, and this tension affects queer deployments. In contrast to the partial recuperation of the literary character of the madwoman as a symbol of feminist resistance explored in the North American second-­wave feminist classic The Madwoman in the Attic by Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar (1979), a widely influential scholarly volume named after a character in Charlotte Brontë’s novel Jane Eyre, some Latina scholars have been more wary of engaging the radical potential of locura (mad-\n\n32 translocas\n\nness), seeing it as linked to mental illness and not as a poetic trope or as a sign of radical revolt. One example is Marta Caminero-­Santangelo’s (1998) scholarly monograph The Madwoman Can’t Speak, or, Why Insanity Is Not Subversive, where the critic rejects literary madness as liberatory; as she states, “My theoretical starting point is the suggestion that a search for the subversive madwoman in literature not only involves some violent repressions of its own . . . but also is fundamentally misguided, since the symbolic resolution of the madwoman as an alternative to patriarchy ultimately traps the woman in silence” (4). Caminero-­Santangelo’s critical stance is echoed by Lyn Di Iorio Sandín (2004) in her Killing Spanish: Literary Essays on Ambivalent U.S. Latino/a Identity, where the Puerto Rican scholar points to the problems with the insistence on the madness of Latina women, particularly in the context of contemporary novels published in the United States in which the female protagonists consistently die. Other scholars such as Vilma Santiago-­Ortiz (2001), Patricia Gherovici (2003), and Christopher Christian (2019) have also focused on Puerto Rican women and mental health issues in the diaspora through the lens of the medical and social sciences, including analyzing the ataque de nervios, also referenced as the “Puerto Rican syndrome.”6 The threat of madness, of losing one’s judgment and falling into the marginalized and excluded condition of she who does not have the use of reason, is anathema to many. For example, the Puerto Rican–­Cape Verdean American feminist Caridad Souza (2001) rejects the term loca in her essay “Esta risa no es de loca” (“This Laughter Is Not That of a Madwoman”), included in the anthology Telling to Live: Latina Feminist Testimonios. The title of Souza’s piece, as suggested by its epigraph, is a feminization of renowned Puerto Rican salsa singer Héctor Lavoe’s verse “Esta risa no es de loco” (This laughter is not that of a madman) (Souza 2001, 114), the opening line of the song “Vamos a reír un poco” (“Let’s Laugh a Little”) from his 1976 album De ti depende.7 In her testimonio, Souza discusses the all-­too-­present risks that she faces as the daughter of working-­class immigrants, specifically as an Afro-­descendant colonial subject in a context in which the unequal relations of power between the United States and Puerto Rico and the problems of poor women of color are not recognized. For Souza, the silence that dominates gendered and racialized colonial relationships of exploitation (that of the unspeakable, what people prefer to downplay or not discuss in informal contexts) threatens to provoke madness, particularly given the effort to negotiate the cultural, social, and\n\nTheorizing la Loca 33\n\npolitical contradictions of her life. In this context, the author affirms the power of laughter as an antidote, insisting that “laughter has always been a part of my survival mechanism” (2001, 122). Here Souza’s performative laughter coincides with that of the French Algerian feminist Hélène Cixous as articulated in Cixous’s classic essay “The Laugh of the Medusa” (1976), a laughter meant to empower women and resist phallogocentrism, racism, and colonialism through writing, but also through the physical and auditory gesture of a body that gives in to a powerful emotion and makes it tangible, visible, and audible; a somatic response to racialization (Fetta 2018). Souza’s testimonial narrative, which also includes a black and white photo of her family dancing, posits writing as a tool of transformation and bridges Blackness and womanhood as sites of resistance, a key conceit of Cixous’s essay. For the Puerto Rican literary scholar Lisa Sánchez González (2001), the marginalization of Puerto Rican and Latina feminists in the United States affects everything.8 In her book Boricua Literature the critic decries this situation in a bilingual and contestatory way, moving freely between English and Spanish, destabilizing dominant monolingualism and ideologies of linguistic purity. As Sánchez González writes, “Speaking from this contradictory space renders the Latina feminist quite painfully global, local, and ultimately, loca en la boca, transforming experience into an escritura both capable and incapable of ‘competing with food’ in our mouths (Deleuze and Guattari 1986)” (2001, 139).9 This condition of being loca en la boca (mad or crazy in the mouth), in which the affect of anger or the pathology of madness is gendered feminine, marked by the linguistic tensions between English and Spanish, creates the paradox of simultaneous intelligibility and confusion. In this way, the Puerto Rican feminist critic attempts to capture and transform Deleuze and Guattari’s meditation on Franz Kafka’s writing, that is to say, their conceit regarding the tension of a mouth that alternates between speaking and eating, which is mediated by the possibilities of writing; a mouth that is caught between basic instincts for nutrition and language’s ability for symbolization, but particularly one negotiating the situation of the German language in Prague (initially as part of the Austro-­Hungarian Empire, and then in Czechoslovakia) in contact with Czech and Yiddish, as was Kafka’s case. The Puerto Rican critic argues that the challenges of this multilingual framework can also help us to understand the Latinx experience in the United States. In her text, Sánchez González also affirms the need to speak of a femi-\n\n34 translocas\n\nnism that is full of specificities, those of Latina feminism (Cotera 2017), a loca-­lized feminism that challenges hegemonic feminism (that is to say, Anglo-­American feminism written with an uppercase F) and that takes advantage of the pioneering decolonial Chicana feminist Emma Pérez’s concept of “un sitio y una lengua (a space and language) that rejects colonial ideology” (Pérez 1991, 161), even when this project will be belittled. As Sánchez González writes, “Loca-­lizing theory is often construed as a hysterical project, since speaking to and from a collective, radicalized, and unapologetically Latina-­centric lengua y sitio (tongue and location) (Pérez 1991) means upsetting the Feminist establishment, only, in the end, to be dismissed, forgotten, or plagiarized” (2001, 139–­40).10 This sentiment echoes Pérez’s own self-­referential theoretical ruminations and the kinds of anecdotes she presents in her earlier piece. Not all Latin American or Latinx self-­identified feminists reject the utility of self-­affirmation as locas; some advocate for the embrace of the term “translocas” as a sign of critical resistance. For example, the women who published the anthology Translocalities/Translocalidades: Feminist Politics of Translation in the Latin/a Américas (Alvarez et al. 2014) adopted the neologism “translocas,” using the plural locas with the capitalized prefix “trans-­,” written with emphasis in the original. The Cuban American feminist scholar Sonia Alvarez has summarized this group’s views, emphasizing “how feminist discourses and practices travel across a variety of sites and directionalities to become interpretive paradigms to read and write issues of class, gender, race, sexuality, migration, health, social movements, development, citizenship, politics and the circulation of identities and texts” (2014, 1).11 As Alvarez points out, Because our transit across multiple boundaries disrupts the prevailing common sense in many of the localities through which we move in ways that sometimes make us seem outright mad (in a double sense), we early on adopted the nickname Translocas for the cross-­disciplinary, cross-­border research group of Latina and Latin American(ist) feminists who brought this edited collection into being. (2014, 3) This double sense of mad (as angry and crazy) and of performing madness negotiates forces that can empower but also stigmatize. While “translocas” is not used in their case principally in relation to homosexuality or to the transgression of male gender, Alvarez does indicate that “we embrace the transgressive, queer, transgendered sense of the term as well” (2014, 4).\n\nTheorizing la Loca 35\n\nIn an endnote, Alvarez credits the deceased Chicano gay scholar Lionel Cantú Jr., a specialist on Mexican gay male migration to the United States, for coining the term: Lionel Cantú was the first to call our group Translocas and was among the most enthusiastic and insig"
