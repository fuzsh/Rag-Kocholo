The book’s, which is essentially Melendez’s memoir, a recollection of the events, activities, and achievements of the Young Lords. The author effectively presents to the reader a fascinating account of the formation of the Young Lords which was a group of college students from Puerto Rico who came together in a bid to fight for some of the basic rights. As Melendez sums it up, “You either claim your history or lose authority over your future” (Melendez 23). The quote is in itself indicative of the book’s overall\n\nPuerto Rican Identity and Spanish Colonial Rule\n\n1399 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThe debate on Puerto Rican Identity is a hot bed of controversy, especially in today’s society where American colonialism dominates most of the island’s governmental and economic policies. The country wrestles with the strong influence of its present day colonizers, while it adamantly tries to retain aspects of the legacy of Spanish colonialism. Despite America’s presence, Puerto Ricans maintain what is arguably their own cultural identity which seems largely based on the influence of Spain mixed with customs that might have developed locally.\n\nSocial Inequity in 'The Motorcycle Diaries' and 'The Great Gatsby'\n\n854 Words | 2 Pages\n\nOn the one hand, in Ernesto Guevara’s diary social injustice is easily detected, and portrayed in a quite moving way, both through some key incidents that were responsible for Ernesto’s new understanding of the world, and Ernesto’s words when narrating his own reflections about these episodes. Firstly, when Ernesto went to visit the sick old woman in Valparaiso, who suffered asthma and a heart condition, is a situation that gives a clear view of the poor reality that some people had to face everyday because they did not have even the minimum conditions to survive with dignity, and on top of that, the sadness of people turned themselves into a nuisance for their family just for the fact of being sick. Secondly, Ernesto’s encounter with the couple of communist workers harassed by their political ideas in Baquedano, who did not have a single blanket to protect themselves from the freezing cold of the desert night, enable us to see, as Ernesto wrote, the representation of the proletariat of the world. Moreover, this couple showed him the ruthless reality of so many people in Chile who were pursued, tortured and disappeared for their...\n\nLetters Of Insurrection Analysis\n\n1281 Words | 3 Pages\n\nThese letters reveal how the rebellions were able to weaken the Spanish empire and they display how they aided the destabilization of the Spanish government and the faith the people had in it. They also offer the indigenous view of the functions of colonial Andean society. The native Andean society created a structure in these reducción towns that had an immense role in constructing the opposition to colonial rule. The Andean communities were able to maintain their own traditions and community organization while they adopted the structures thrust upon them by the colonial\n\nMexican Colonialism Essay\n\n914 Words | 2 Pages\n\nAfter three hundred years of suffering and oppression by the Spanish crown, and inspired by the fire of revolution sweeping over the world in places such as United States and France, the Mexican population finally decided that they could endure no more, it was time for a change!

That's how old Rachel is. She is also ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one. In Eleven by Sandra Cisneros, the teacher finds a red sweater and asks whose it is. There was a pause of silence until Sylvia Saldivar said it was Rachel’s, and she tried to deny it but the teacher believed what Sylvia said. I think Rachel needs to learn how to stand up for herself. I think Rachel gets overly emotional and sensitive. Secondly I think she is lonely. And last I think she is very negative about some things.\n\nSpanish Colonialism and Puerto Rican Identity\n\n1667 Words | 4 Pages\n\nIn order to understand the current situation of Puerto Ricans one must look at their history and retrace the sequence of events that led to the current formation of the Puerto Rican people. An important component of this history is the time Puerto Rico spent under Spanish rule. Studying this portion of Puerto Rican history forces us to acknowledge the contribution the Spaniards, European immigrants, and African slaves had on Puerto Rican identity as we consider it today. This also addresses contemporary debates on Puerto Rican identity. An example of this is evident in an essay written by Jose Luis Gonzales entitled \"Puerto Rico : Th Four Storied Country\". In the article Gonzales points out what he feels is a disregard toward the African contribution to the Puerto Rican identity. He argues that the first Puerto Ricans were black , based on his interpretation that Africans were the first group to come to Puerto Rico and reproduce who did not have ties to a \"motherland\" because they were slaves. This is unlike the Spaniard elites and Criolles that demonstrated their commitment and loyalty to Spain. Since they had no other place to go, Puerto Rico was their motherland. Gonzalez also points out that the culture of a region is always the culture of the elite, not the popular culture.\n\nAnalysis Of 'In The Time Of The Butterflies' By Julia Alvarez\n\n842 Words | 2 Pages\n\n“The secret of happiness is freedom, and the secret of freedom is courage.” In America, Americans are blessed to have the right to freedom. Unlike other unfortunate countries, their freedom is limited. In many Latin American countries, the government’s leader has all power of the Country. Citizens have no rights to freedom, they are trapped in a cruel country where innocent people are killed each day. Civilians fear to speak out to the regime of leader; However, there were a few courageous citizens enough to speak out against the government. For example, “The Censors” by Luisa Valenzuela and the historical fictionalized account, “In The Time Of The Butterflies” by Julia Alvarez reveal individual 's role in overcoming oppression.\n\nRole Of Honor In Colonial Latin America\n\n860 Words | 2 Pages\n\nA question arises whether they felt “coerced” to use the court system because the judicial system was the only avenue, other than violence, in trying to right perceived wrongs. A careful examination of “Scandal at the Church: José de Alfaro Accuses Doña Theresa Bravo and Others of Insulting and Beating His Castiza Wife, Josefa Cadena (Mexico, 1782),” illustrates the surprising role of an elite court system as an equalizer within a socially-stratified society. More specifically to this case, the court acted as a vehicle to restore honour in an attack from an upper class society member to someone in a class lower. The chapter chronicled a criminal proceeding initiated by the plaintiff because of the injury and insult inflicted upon his wife by the defendant and her family. The physical injuries inflicted on José de\n\nMarela Zacarias Analysis\n\n984 Words | 2 Pages\n\nIf I were to ask you what is art, and how can one find it? What would you say? Well if it were me being asked those question, I would simply say that art to me is a form of a picture; a visual painting or model of some design and it could be found all among us.

She also mentioned that art gives us a way to be creative and express ourselves. [1]\n\nBenito Cereno Analysis\n\n653 Words | 2 Pages\n\n\"Benito Cereno,\" written by Herman Melville, is a novella that portrays Melville’s views on slavery during a time of great political turmoil over the issue of slavery, (six years before the Civil War). The narrator, Amasa Delano, is the captain of a Massachusetts whaling ship called the Bachelor’s Delight. Through out the story, Melville portrays certain situations, which bring attention to the ideas of slavery, and leadership. “Benito Cereno” is a story that depicts the historical incident that occurred in 1805, where black slaves had overthrown the Spanish Sailors. The film La Amistad, produced by Steven Spielberg, was based upon this historical incident. The slave owners are depicted as brutal human beings that want to sell the slaves as quickly and as effortlessly as possible. On the other hand, the slaves want to return to their homes and live the life of a regular human being. Because of the fact that many African Americans were enslaved at this time, many revolts occurred, often even under extremely difficult situations.\n\nPuerto Rican Poets: Julia De Burgos\n\n990 Words | 2 Pages\n\nAccording to Tompkins and Foster, “Apart from the respect for her poetry, her situation as a lonely and suffering woman, her solidarity, and her will to struggle mirror the collective conscience of thousands of Puerto Ricans outside the island” (pg. 59).

Juan Preciado, who was born in an urban city outside of Comala, “came to Comala because [he] had been told that [his] father, a man named Pedro Paramo lived there” (1). He initially was unaware of the general dislike that his father was subjected to in that area of Mexico. Pedro was regarded as “[l]iving bile” (1) by the people that still inhabited Comala, a classification that Juan did not expect. This reveals that it was not known by those outside of the patron’s dominion of the cruel abuse that they levied upon their people. Pedro Paramo held..."
