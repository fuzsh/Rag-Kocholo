The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:30 p.m., in room SD-106, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Pete V. Domenici, chairman, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PETE V. DOMENICI, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO The Chairman. Please come to order. Thank you, everyone. Mr. Marshall, are you all alone? You're alone at the table, but are you otherwise? There is nobody that will sit with you? I'm just kidding. It just looks kind of strange, but we'll see what happens here. Thank you to everybody for coming. We're glad to have you here in the U.S. Senate. I'm sorry we don't have one of our new rooms, but this is the best we have and we hope that it is adequate. With that, let me open, and let me then go to Senator Bingaman and then to Senator Martinez, recently honored with an appointment by the President as chairman of the Republican National Committee, for which we congratulate you. With that, let me suggest that we are here at a hearing on a report from the President's task force on Puerto Rico's status. The committee shall come to order. The purpose of the hearing is to receive testimony on the December 2005 report from the President's task force on Puerto Rico's Status. I am pleased to convene this important hearing to discuss the White House report. I appreciate the attendance of our witnesses and that many elected public officials from Puerto Rico have traveled long distances to join us here today. Thanks to all of you. Before beginning, I want to express my gratitude for all those serving in the Armed Forces from Puerto Rico. I also want to commend those living in Puerto Rico that make their voices heard in local referenda, dealing with their political status. As I understand it, it is not uncommon to have more than 75 percent of the populous vote on referenda dealing with options of political status. Puerto Ricans deserve an opportunity to be consulted regarding their future and its relationship--their relationship with the U.S. and I will work as closely as I can with all parties involved prior to proceeding with any status change. I am pleased that the White House issued the task force report. This is an important first step in understanding the non-territorial forms of government for Puerto Rico. No matter how we proceed, we ultimately need to be assured that the majority of the people of Puerto Rico will have their voice heard. I want the witnesses, who have come here today, I want them to know how grateful we are and I look forward to hearing their testimony. Now, before I introduce the witnesses that are going to testify, let me yield to who today is the ranking member but will be chairman in a couple of weeks, 3 or 4 weeks. But we'll go as it is and we'll yield to the ranking member. That's Senator Bingaman, my co-colleague from New Mexico. Senator Bingaman. STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF BINGAMAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO Senator Bingaman. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you having this important hearing. I'm pleased that the committee will have the opportunity here in the final days of this 109th Congress to receive testimony on the report of the President's task force on Puerto Rico's Status. Over the years, this committee has put many hours into hearings and the consideration of legislation, but enactment has often been frustrated by a lack of consensus in the Congress and in Washington and in Puerto Rico. In recent years, there have been developments that may have changed that political dynamic. For example, the United States has dramatically reduced its military presence on the island. Second, the possessions tax credit has been fully phased out. And third, the free association relationships have been established with three nations in the Pacific. More recently, this report, that Mr. Marshall is going to testify about, from President Bush's task force has reaffirmed legal positions which seem to me well founded and that were provided to the committee several years ago by the Clinton administration. In two of those findings in particular I would allude to, the current relationship with Puerto Rico is based on the territorial clause and second, that the mutual consent provisions in the new commonwealth proposal cannot be accommodated under the U.S. Constitution. However, with respect to the report's recommendations for legislation, I think it is too early to determine if there is sufficient consensus in the House and the Senate and also whether there is a commitment by this administration to move forward with legislation. This is an issue of great importance to the people of Puerto Rico. They deserve an opportunity to be consulted. Today is an opportunity to hear what the prospects for consensus are and I will continue to work with you and consult closely with others here on the committee and officials from Puerto Rico and the administration before we proceed. So thank you again for having the hearing. I look forward to hearing the witnesses and continuing to work with you on this issue. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator Bingaman. Now we have some additional members of the panel who have arrived. On our side, we have distinguished Senator Martinez and it's noteworthy that we have two additional Senators on the Democratic side, one a new member--not the newest, but a new member from Colorado, Senator Salazar. It's always a privilege. I'm sure we will hear some insightful questions from you about this situation. And then we have Senator Menendez. He's newly elected also, so we congratulate you, for the record, on your election and we're glad that you were able to make it here with us today, Senator. Thank you very, very much. I think the rules would now say we go to Senator Martinez, and then to the Democratic side, to Senator Menendez. Please proceed, Senator. Whatever time you want is yours. STATEMENT OF HON. MEL MARTINEZ, U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA Senator Martinez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you so much for holding this very important hearing today. I want to express to you my real personal gratitude for making time for this, for the diligent work of the staff. I also want to thank Ranking Member Bingaman for his work on making this hearing possible. I also just want to take a moment to recognize de una calidad bienvenida to so many people who have traveled here from Puerto Rico to be with us today; most of all, and first and foremost, Governor Acevedo, but also, of course, our Congressman, Luis Fortuno, and the many other elected officials. Mayor O'Neil I know is here and I'm sure there are many others that represent the people of Puerto Rico in different elected offices. So I welcome all of you and look forward to continuing this discussion on this very important issue. When considering Puerto Rico's status, it is clear that we have been left in an untenable circumstance regarding what the future will hold for the citizens of Puerto Rico. This hearing is critical in answering many of the questions that have, for too long now, gone unanswered. Although it isn't likely that we will hear all the answers today, we are certainly moving in the right direction. This hearing will give us an opportunity to review our Nation's policy toward Puerto Rico--how we got it where we are--and it will also give us an opportunity to discuss where we are heading. However, first and foremost, we should start by clarifying one point: Puerto Rico is undoubtedly a territory of the United States. Puerto Rico is subject to the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution and, therefore, a territory of the United States since 1898. That has not changed in the last 108 years. Federal authorities including GAO, CRS, DOJ, State, the Supreme Court, the U.S. House of Representatives and successive U.S. Presidents, including the legislative history of Law 600, which provided Puerto Rico to write a local constitution, and the record of this committee, all make clear that the status of Puerto Rico remains under the Territorial Clause since 1898. It is for this reason that, as we begin our debate on Puerto Rico's future, we do not forget the obvious--that Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. What does this mean? Practically, it means that our Federal laws are applicable in Puerto Rico, yet the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico do not have adequate or proportionate representation to decide those laws. And a government based on representative democracy clarifying this situation is an absolute necessity. Mr. Chairman, in order to begin the process of resolving this matter, we need to start by asking one important question: Why is Puerto Rico the only territory in the United States to be granted U.S. citizenship by Congress, while at the same time not being put in a position to establish a permanent relationship with the United States? When the Congress conferred U.S. citizenship for the territories of Alaska and Hawaii, the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted it to mean that the U.S. Constitution applied and those territories were incorporated into the Union. When Congress conferred U.S. citizenship for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Supreme Court deviated from the Alaska and Hawaii precedents and ruled that the Constitution did not apply. This meant that Congress could govern the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico under the same unincorporated territory doctrine that applied to non-citizens in the Philippines when it was in transition to independence. Although Congress has been active on this issue, it has not taken the necessary steps to resolve Puerto Rico's status. As a result, some U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico have created a number of unconventional status ideologies and doctrines that combine features of statehood, territorial status and independence. The ideologies and doctrines may be ill-advised or even legally flawed in some respect but they are a direct result of U.S. citizens simply trying to fill the void left by the U.S. Congress. These doctrines, which now complicate the issue of Puerto Rico's status, most likely would not have been created had Congress not overlooked its responsibility for a territorial status resolution. I mention this not to chastise previous Congresses but to urge my colleagues to take this matter up in an expeditious fashion, to address it fully and to resolve it finally. As I said earlier, this is long overdue and the people of Puerto Rico deserve their say. As a result, I have introduced legislation that would move this process forward. It would not dictate the status of Puerto Rico but it would begin a process whereby a resolution of this matter could be reached. This hearing is a critical step toward finding a workable solution and I'm pleased that both sides of this important debate are represented here today and will present testimony to our committee. While some people support the White House report, others oppose it. Both sides have valuable perspectives and are important to this debate, because both sides have the best interests of Puerto Rico at heart. It is with a tone of civility that we should open this hearing, because there is, I believe, a firm understanding that we are here today to determine what is in the best interests of all U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico and are here to better understand the constitutional options available to future generations of U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Senator Martinez follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Mel Martinez, U.S. Senator From Florida Mr. Chairman, I want to personally thank you for calling this important hearing. The issue of Puerto Rico's status is of great interest to me and many of my constituents in Florida, and it is an issue where a meaningful resolution is well overdue. When considering Puerto Rico's status, it is clear that we have been left in an untenable circumstance regarding what the future will hold for the citizens of Puerto Rico. This hearing is critical in answering many of the questions that have, for too long now, gone unanswered. Although it is unlikely that we will hear all the answers today, we are certainly moving in the right direction. This hearing will give us an opportunity to review our nation's policy toward Puerto Rico, how we got where we are, and will also give us an opportunity to discuss where it is we are heading.

The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator. Now it's the Senator from Colorado. STATEMENT OF HON. KEN SALAZAR, U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO Senator Salazar. Thank you very much, Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Bingaman, for holding this hearing on this very important issue. I also shout out my greetings to Governor Acevedo, as well as to Luis Fortuno and Ken McClintock and others who are here from Puerto Rico, who have traveled so far. Welcome here to your Nation's capital as well. When President Clinton signed Executive Order 13183, establishing the President's task force on Puerto Rico, to help answer the questions that the people of Puerto Rico have asked for years regarding the options for their future status and the process for realizing an option, I doubt that he or those advising him expected that the task force would take so many years to make a recommendation. However, now that the task force has acted, I believe that the 3.9 million people of Puerto Rico deserve a response from this Congress. With Capitol Hill buzzing from the election and the changes in the House and the Senate, I appreciate very much the attention that the Energy Committee is giving to this issue today. Not all issues are receiving this kind of attention in Washington on these days. I am very eager to hear from today's panels of leaders and experts on this issue of the future of Puerto Rico. I look forward to hearing from the Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Kevin Marshall, with respect to the task force report. Likewise, I am very interested in learning more about the thoughts and reactions to the report from representatives from Puerto Rico's political parties, Governor Acevedo, Resident Commissioner Fortuno and Ruben Berrios Martinez. All of you in Puerto Rico and those of us who are interested in the future of the island have lived with this issue for a very long time. Notwithstanding the status of Puerto Rico, the people of Puerto Rico have been great citizens of the United States and have contributed greatly to this Nation. I am sure you will use this forum to share your unique perspective. I believe that our committee will benefit very much from your views. I hope you can offer us clear and practical ideas for moving forward. I have come to learn more about the unresolved question of what is Puerto Rico's status through conversations with Puerto Rican leaders on different sides of this issue and by traveling, within the last year, to Puerto Rico with my friend, Senator Mel Martinez. I recognize the great responsibility that this committee placed in providing Puerto Ricans with the means to determine the ultimate status of their island. That is why, with 13 other Senators, we introduced the Puerto Rico Democracy Act. Our bill would implement the first step of the task force recommendations by authorizing a plebiscite that would ask Puerto Ricans to decide if they would like to remain in their current status as a U.S. territory or pursue some other permanent, non-territory option. In either case, Congress would be responsible for assisting with and respecting the desires of the people. If the people determine that they are satisfied with their current political situation, Congress may revisit the issue in the future. If, on the other hand, Puerto Ricans elect to pursue a permanent non-territory option, Congress would have to authorize a mechanism to ascertain that new status. My interest, very simply stated, is to provide the people of Puerto Rico with a voice in their future. For more than 100 years, the U.S. Government has allowed the question of Puerto Rico and its future simply to linger. As we look ahead to the 110th Congress, it is my hope that this committee will keep Puerto Rico on the agenda and that we can help the people of Puerto Rico in moving forward on this issue. Once again, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for today's hearing and I look forward to hearing from the panel today. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator. Let me see. Since there are so many people, I do want to be fair with the Senators and the people in terms of time consumed. The next one who would come up here would be you, Senator Menendez. I think what we'll do, if you don't mind, is go to you with an opening statement, but ask you in advance if you could tell us that it would be limited in how long that opening statement might be. Senator Menendez. Well, Mr. Chairman, I'll be, I think, within the timeframe that we normally would have here. The Chairman. Will you do that? Senator Menendez. Yes, sir. The Chairman. All right. We're going to do the same with you, Senator Burr. Do you want to even take less? You're going to do half the allowed? Well then, he agreed to that, now that's the order. Thank you. You will follow him with half the time allotted. Senator Menendez, you're next. STATEMENT OF HON. ROBERT MENENDEZ, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your kind wishes to our ranking member and soon-to-be-chair, as well. I appreciate him and our colleagues; Governor Anibal Acevedo, too; the Resident Commissioner, Congressman Fortuno; the President of the Puerto Rican Independence Party; and all who have come here. We welcome you. Now, many of you think we are here to talk about Puerto Rico and Puerto Rico policy, but what we are actually here to talk about today is not policy, but process. Every member of the Senate knows that process matters. Every member of the Senate knows that the process you set up to debate amendments and to vote on amendments can determine the outcome. That is why we spend hours debating about how we are going to debate. That is why members of the Senate, who know Senate procedure, can win on process even when they could lose on policy. So there is no group of people who should understand better than this group of Senators that when it comes to the future of Puerto Rico, process matters. And every American understands that a rigged vote creates a false outcome. I have always said that when it comes to Puerto Rico, we must have an unstacked and unbiased process that allows the people of Puerto Rico to determine their own future. And I would hope that every member of the Senate would support an unstacked and unbiased process, whether the outcome was statehood, independence or commonwealth. Unfortunately, the White House Task Force and certain legislation in both the House and the Senate create a process that in my mind, is designed to get a specific outcome. I know that for many people, the idea of a plebiscite or a referendum by the people sounds like a good idea. Why not let the people vote on the options to determine their future? But that is not actually what the White House Task Force proposes. Unfortunately, the process set up by the White House Task Force does not let the people of Puerto Rico hold a clear side-by- side vote on the three options: statehood, independence or commonwealth. And here is where we see, once again, that process matters. Rather than creating a process where all three options are voted on side-by-side, the White House Task Force sets up a rigged, two-step process designed to kill the commonwealth option in the first vote and then not allow it as part of a second vote. First, the voters will be asked to vote for or against moving to a permanent, non-territorial status. According to the White House Task Force, the people of Puerto Rico will be asked to say whether they wish to remain a U.S. territory subject to the will of Congress. Let me be clear. This is not a vote for or against the commonwealth as we know it. In fact, the definition of the commonwealth as described in the report is designed to scare people into voting against the commonwealth. The report gives the false impression that under the commonwealth, Puerto Rico is a colony and that people could lose their U.S. citizenship. The definition of commonwealth is so warped that even those who support the current commonwealth status would likely vote against it. So the first vote doesn't even allow the people of Puerto Rico to vote for or against a real commonwealth. In fact, the vote would be designed to get a commonwealth-sounding option voted down by scaring people. And by making the first vote a separate vote on commonwealth status, you increase the number of people voting against it by creating an alliance between those who might support independence and statehood. So after killing the commonwealth option, the second vote would only allow voters to choose statehood or independence. You may ask why the White House task force did not recommend a straight side-by-side vote of the three options. You may ask why the White House Task Force included a definition of commonwealth that is designed to scare Puerto Ricans. I cannot answer those questions, although I look forward to getting some answers today. It reminds me of the point I began with today, and this is where I'll end. Process matters. If you cannot win in an outright vote, then stack the process so your side wins. I say the people of Puerto Rico deserve better than a stacked process designed so one side can win. The people of Puerto Rico deserve to determine their own future. The people of Puerto Rico, as American citizens, have the right to a fair and unbiased process. That's why I support legislation that will bring the people of Puerto Rico together to build consensus in their own land. It puts the future of Puerto Rico in the hands of Puerto Ricans. It allows Puerto Ricans to tell Congress what they want rather than the other way around. And that, Mr. Chairman, is what I hope we would see. I would remind everyone that the issue here is not whether you support statehood, independence or commonwealth. The issue is creating a process that is fair. The bottom line is that a rigged process creates a false outcome and the people of Puerto Rico deserve a fair process and a true outcome. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator. Now, we're going to have Senator Burr for half the time allotted, so that means 2\\1/2\\ minutes. STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BURR, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA Senator Burr. I thank the Chair. I thank the ranking member. The Chairman. It's hard to breathe in 2\\1/2\\ minutes. Senator Burr. But this Senator can do it. The Chairman. All right. Let's go. Senator Burr. I thank the Chair and I thank the ranking member for the opportunity to have such a distinguished group of witnesses here today. The self-determination process for Puerto Rico must be a fair and transparent process. We have a very important responsibility to ensure that any process that leads to the consideration of the 51st State in the Union be conducted in a way that is fair to all involved. We owe it to our constituents and to our common citizens in Puerto Rico. The sanctity of the Union and our commitment to the democratic principles must guide how we treat this sensitive and significant process of self-determination. While I have concerns about the task force report that we are here to examine today, I do respect Puerto Ricans' right to self- determination. S. 2304 simply recognizes Puerto Rico's right to self-determination. Our founding fathers' belief in the importance of a Constitutional Convention led to the formation of the United States of America. Therefore, we must recognize their wisdom and move this process forward through local consensus first and for congressional consideration thereafter. I look forward to the hearing we are here to learn from. I pledge and look forward to working with the Governor and with the Resident Commissioner as further issues are explored in what I think is an extremely important issue about the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. I thank the Chair. [The prepared statement of Senator Craig follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Larry E. Craig, U.S. Senator From Idaho To give some context to today's hearing the record should include some relevant history of the Committee's oversight role in support of status resolution for Puerto Rico. On January 17, 1989, the Governor of Puerto Rico, acting as head of his political party, co-signed a letter with the heads of the other two major political parties in Puerto Rico, seeking federal support for and participation in a process to resolve the ``ultimate political status'' of Puerto Rico. In response, from 1989 to 1991 the U.S. Congress expended a significant amount of time and effort trying to help our fellow American citizens in Puerto Rico resolve the political status question for that U.S. territory. In 1994 the duly-constituted Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico formally petitioned the U.S. to approve a commonwealth proposal that garnered less than a majority of votes in a locally sponsored vote conducted in 1993. The 1994 petition asked Congress to define what status options it was willing to consider. In 1997 the local legislature renewed its petition and asked Congress to sponsor a federally recognized vote based on legally valid status definitions Congress would be willing to consider. In 1998 the House answered the petition when it debated and passed on a recorded vote legislation containing legally valid definitions of statehood, independence and commonwealth. However, the Senate never acted on similar bipartisan legislation I sponsored, and instead passed a resolution confirming the territorial clause power of Congress with respect to the status of Puerto Rico. At that point the local Puerto Rican government called a plebiscite based on the general principles of status options contained in the House passed bill. In that vote statehood received 46.5%, the highest vote of any political status option on the ballot. Independence received 2.5%, and separate nationhood with a treaty of free association like the compact for Micronesia received .02%. The commonwealth option on the ballot was based on governing U.S. Supreme Court rulings and federal law defining the current status as that of a U.S. territory, and this option received .01% of the vote. This represented a 99.9% rejection of the current commonwealth defined by federal law as a territory. That left only one option on the ballot, which was ``None of the Above'', and it received 50.2% of the vote. Thus, a ballot option that did not define any political status got the most votes, and we will never know what the vote would have been for the actual status options if ``None of the Above'' had not been on the ballot. What we do know is that the local pro-commonwealth Party in Puerto Rico rejected the House passed definition of commonwealth and the version thereof on the 1998 local plebiscite ballot. This was because both the House bill and 1998 ballot correctly stated that as a commonwealth Puerto Rico remains subject to the authority of Congress under the territorial clause in Art. IV, Sec. 3 of the U.S. Constitution. The reason the local commonwealth party rejected the House passed definition of commonwealth is that in 1998 the Governing Board of that party adopted its official platform confirming that party's long held ideology that commonwealth is not territorial but is instead a form of separate sovereign nationhood. The 1998 party platform asserts that: Puerto Rico is not a U.S. territory and therefore is not subject to the power of Congress under the territorial clause Puerto Rico is a nation which conducts relations with the U.S. on ``bilateral'' basis under a ``compact'' formed by approval of the local constitution in 1952 Commonwealth means Puerto Rico is a ``free associated state'' with separate national sovereignty that exists on a plane of international equivalence with the United States Commonwealth means Puerto Rico has its own separate international identity and can conduct its own foreign relations, including its own trade relations, even while it enjoys domestic status as a U.S. customs territory While not yet recognized by the United States, so that further development of the bilateral compact is required, federal powers in Puerto Rico are only those delegated by Puerto Rico or retained under the compact The compact is binding on the United States and cannot be altered without Puerto Rico's consent U.S. law applies in Puerto Rico only as provided consistent with the compact New federal laws do not apply unless consented to by Puerto Rico under the compact The compact guarantees federal programs, tax exemptions and U.S. citizenship in perpetuity under a political union that cannot be ended without consent of Puerto Rico On the basis of that platform the commonwealth party declared the House passed bill and the commonwealth option on the 1998 plebiscite ballot biased in favor of statehood. In other words, since the House bill and 1998 ballot accurately defined commonwealth as it exists under federal law rather than conforming to the local party's platform, the House language was seen as biased towards statehood by some. While I do not believe it is the job of Congress to choose sides in determining what form of political status the Puerto Ricans will decide, I do believe it is the responsibility of Congress to provide the legal framework for the decision they must make. defining status options Given this history, it is clear that defining status options under federal law and determining which of these Congress is willing to consider is the single most imperative requirement for status resolution. The territorial clause vests Congress with the primary authority and responsibility to define options and sponsor an orderly and informed process of self-determination. Unfortunately, in 1991 and 1998, Congress was not willing to sustain the effort required to fulfill its constitutional role. Congress has been determining the future status of territories since 1796, when the first U.S. territory outside of an existing state joined the union as a new state. After considering local status votes and petitions, the United States has subsequently admitted 32 territories as states, with one territory becoming an independent nation. Additionally, three U.S.-governed U.N. trust territories have become free associated states under a treaty with the United States. Yet in 108 years of U.S. administration, there has never been a Congressionally-sponsored status referendum in Puerto Rico. Congress has yet to recognize a Puerto Rican vote on status as a legitimate and informed act of self-determination among options compatible with the U.S. Constitution. The 1952 vote to adopt a local constitution did not present political status options to the voters and in fact was not a status vote at all. A 1967 vote favoring a now obsolete and non-viable commonwealth, the 1993 vote, and the 1998 vote, all failed to produce a majority for a status option that Congress would accept as compatible with federal law. executive branch initiatives Given this lamentable history of Congressional inaction, the efforts to resolve Puerto Rico's status advanced by President Bush in 1992, President Clinton in 2000, and President Bush in 2003, are to be commended. If these three Administrations had not provided leadership on this issue, we would not be as far along as we are building a record that provides a foundation for ultimate action by Congress. The Report by the President's task force on Puerto Rico's Status is a mercifully condensed but fully complete and adequate summarization of the Puerto Rico status process to date. It makes sound recommendations as to next steps for further progress. Accordingly, this hearing on the White House report is timely and important if for no other reason than it adds the White House report and the views of the witnesses about it to the record before this Committee in anticipation of future legislation. In addition to examining the White House report closely, we need to begin the process for considering legislation proposed to implement the recommendations in the Report, which was prepared by the Administration's senior officials responsible for policy relating to Puerto Rico's status. S. 2661, sponsored by Mr. Martinez and Mr. Salazar, represents a very restrained and even minimalist approach, essentially an up or down vote on continuing the current status or seeking a new status that is not territorial. Instead of the relatively comprehensive self-determination process contained in the 1998 House-passed bill, S. 2661 is essentially a measure favoring gradualism in order to enable the political process to take it one step at a time. That is appropriate because the first goal and highest responsibility of Congress is not to promote statehood, independence, or continued territory status, but to facilitate informed self-determination. Under this bill, there would never be the need for Congress or Puerto Rico to define or sponsor a vote on statehood, independence, or free association, unless there is first a majority vote to end the current status and seek a non-territory status. Since 1993, there has not been a majority vote for any political status option, and in 1998 virtually the entire population rejected commonwealth defined as territory status. So it is important to end minority rule on status, which refers to the 46.5% vote for statehood in 1998 or the 48.67% vote for an unrealistic and unconstitutional commonwealth option in 1993. Those pluralities in local votes can and should be replaced by majorities in votes recognized by the United States, and the proposal to determine if a majority favor the current status as defined by federal law or seek a non-territory status is fair to all three status options and all three major political parties in Puerto Rico. Of course, because the White House report and the Martinez-Salazar bill define the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as a territory, some in the commonwealth party argue that the intent of the Martinez-Salazar bill and the report are both biased in favor of statehood. As a cosponsor of the Martinez-Salazar bill, I reject that label of bias, and believe that this bill would simply provide a mechanism for the people of Puerto Rico to determine a legally acceptable political status. The local commonwealth party remains committed to the proposed development of commonwealth under the 1998 party platform described above. Indeed, on December 28, 2005, shortly after the White House report was issued, the Governor of Puerto Rico, in his capacity as head of the commonwealth party, stated that the 1998 platform for development of commonwealth ``reflects our aspirations for autonomous development . . . We are ready to undertake this development when the United States demonstrates the maturity to recognize that this type of relationship is what . . . both countries need.'' At a House hearing on the White House report conducted on April 27, 2006, the commonwealth party witnesses argued that a vote on remaining a territory or seeking a new non-territory status is biased in favor of statehood because supporters of statehood and independence could ``gang up'' and vote for a non-territory status. The commonwealth party witnesses also asserted that a vote on the current status as defined by federal law is unfair because the commonwealth party does not accept the definition of the current status under federal law, and so their definition of commonwealth is unfairly excluded from the process. To address these implausible arguments we begin with the fact that under Article VI of the U.S. Constitution federal law is the supreme law of the land. That includes federal law applicable to Puerto Rico as long as it is a territory under U.S. sovereignty. If federal law defines Puerto Rico as a territory, which it does, then a majority vote to seek a new non-territory status is a majority vote against the current status regardless of what new non-territory status the voters may prefer. Further, it is the responsibility of the federal and local government to ensure that commonwealth proposals the U.S. Department of Justice has labeled ``illusory'' and ``deceptive'' are not allowed to appear on self-determination ballots. What would be truly unfair and biased would be to include an unviable option on the ballot in a status vote. That is what happened in 1993, when a definition of commonwealth that was constitutionally unrealistic and legally invalid was presented to voters. This results in an ``artificial plurality'' for a commonwealth option that does not exist and is impossible. In the history of U.S. territorial law, statehood and independence are the normative options. Territorial status is normative as a temporary status until the territory is ready for statehood or independence. What is not normative is for a territory to be granted U.S. citizenship, develop internal self-government under a locally adopted constitution, but remain in that status for an indefinite period lasting decades, without any action by Congress leading to incorporation and statehood, or even independence. It is understandable that in the absence of a federal policy on status local political parties would begin to develop their own status definitions that would benefit their interests. At the same time, those definitions might not fit within U.S. federal law or under the constitutional definition of a territory. For example, the United Nations recognized free association as an alternative to integration with another nation or full independence, but in international law that is based on separate sovereign nationhood, and the retention by each party of the right to full independence through unilateral termination of the association. If a majority of voters in Puerto Rico want free association, that is a legally valid and politically realistic status option. The same is true of statehood, it is a well-defined legally valid status. federal responsibility for status resolution Historically, territory status was temporary until the conditions were right for statehood. That was the Northwest Ordinance incorporated territory model and it worked just fine for 30 territories that became states in that way. Then territorial law became a little more complicated when we acquired sovereignty over Alaska, the Philippines, Puerto Rico and Hawaii. The organic laws Congress enacted to govern these territories created a good deal of confusion and ended up in the U.S. Supreme Court. The court decided that Alaska and Hawaii were incorporated territories under the U.S. Constitution, based on Northwest Ordinance model, because Congress had conferred U.S. citizenship to the people of Alaska and Hawaii. However, the Philippines and Puerto Rico were to be governed by Congress without extension of the U.S. Constitution because Congress had not extended U.S. citizenship. Accordingly, Congress adopted and eventually implemented a policy leading to independence for the Philippines. However, in the meantime Congress extended U.S. citizenship to Puerto Rico. This should have triggered the same result it did earlier for Alaska and Hawaii, including extension of the U.S. Constitution and incorporation into the union under a policy leading to eventual statehood. However, instead of following its own precedent in the Alaska and Hawaii cases, the new Supreme Court justices who decided the Puerto Rico case ruled that Congress could extend citizenship but not the U.S. Constitution, and still govern Puerto Rico in the same manner as it did the Philippines when it had a non-citizen population and was on its way to independence. More than anything else, that flawed judicial ruling is the source of the problem Congress is having on resolving the matter of political status for Puerto Rico. The White House report on Puerto Rico's status correctly calls on Congress to establish a self-determination process that restores the historical integrity of federal territorial law and policy by enabling Puerto Rico to choose a path leading to statehood or separate nationhood, which now can include either independence or a status recognized under later U.N. decolonization standards and known as free association. In the meantime, we need to recognize that historically and legally Puerto Rico's status is a judicially imposed anomaly, and like most anomalies it has unintended consequences for the nation and the residents of Puerto Rico. Although ratified by Congress through statutory policies accepting the ``unincorporated territory'' doctrine created by court ruling, Congress has never come to grips with the fundamental question of what ordered scheme of liberty, what rights and duties, exist for U.S. citizens in an unincorporated territory. Instead, because the courts gave Congress permission to govern U.S. citizens in unincorporated territories without extending the U.S. Constitution, and to govern U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico the same way Congress governed non-citizens in the Philippines prior to its independence, Congress went ahead an extended U.S. citizenship to the populations of other unincorporated territories. And why not? The ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Puerto Rico made conferral of U.S. citizenship a consequence free activity. Or, did it? To understand what we have done by deviating from the Alaska and Hawaii precedents, to understand what Justice Taft did when he wrote an opinion based on his personal intellectual preferences instead of the doctrine of stare decisis embodied in the Supreme Court's ruling on Alaska and Hawaii, we need to look at exactly what we have wrought in Puerto Rico. If Puerto Rico chooses separate nationhood, then conferral of U.S. citizenship will end. But if the people of Puerto Rico choose to retain American citizenship, Congress must enable, and perhaps even require, the residents of Puerto Rico and the nation to complete the transition to full and equal status through statehood. I am pleased that the Chairman has called for this hearing today and I hope that we can move forward with legislation in the next Congress to address this difficult situation. The Chairman. Thank you very much. Senator Burr. Have it duly noted that I did not use all the time. The Chairman. You didn't do it in half the time, but we're not going to argue. See, it just shows you with 32 seconds left, so we used a lot more than half of 5. Oh, all right. Now, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to proceed now, in the following manner: Kevin Marshall, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, is going to testify now; and then he will be followed by the Honorable Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; and then there will be two witnesses with the Governor; and then the Congressman, two Congressmen will join together and they will become the next panel. So we might proceed, Mr. Marshall, how much time do you need to explain the position of the executive branch? Mr. Marshall. Five minutes, if I get it just right. The Chairman. Oh, you don't need to be in that much of a hurry. This is very important. We're going to give you 10 minutes and you talk slow. [Laughter.] The Chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Marshall. STATEMENT OF C. KEVIN MARSHALL, DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL, DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Mr. Marshall. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Bingaman, for inviting me to discuss the working report of the President's task force on Puerto Rico's Status. I'm a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. As the Attorney General's designee on the task force, I serve as its co-chair along with the Deputy Assistant to the President and Director for Intergovernmental Affairs, Ruben Barrales. The status of Puerto Rico and the options regarding that status have been issues for many years. President George H. W. Bush, in a 1992 memorandum, recognized that Puerto Rico's current commonwealth stature grants it significant self- government authority, described Puerto Rico as a territory, and directed that it be treated like a State. President Clinton, in establishing the task force in 2000, made it the policy of the executive branch to help answer the questions that the people of Puerto Rico have asked for years regarding the options for the island's future status and the process of realizing an option. The task force was required to consider and develop positions on proposals, without preference among the options, for the commonwealth's future status. Its recommendations are limited, however, to those options permitted by the Constitution. In establishing the task force, President Clinton also expressly recognized that Puerto Rico's ultimate status has not been determined and noted the different visions for that status within Puerto Rico. Although Puerto Rico held a plebiscite in 1998, none of the proposed status options received a majority. Indeed, none of the above prevailed because of objection to the ballot definition of the commonwealth option. Some in Puerto Rico have proposed a new commonwealth status. That, among other things, could not be altered without the mutual consent of Puerto Rico and the Federal Government. In October 2000, a few months before President Clinton established the task force, William Treanor, who held the same position in the Office of Legal Counsel that I now hold, testified that such a proposal was not constitutional. Seeking to determine the constitutionally permissible options and recommend a process for realizing one of the options, the task force considered all status options objectively, without prejudice. We sought input from all interested parties and met with anyone who requested a meeting. The task force issued its report last December and concluded that there were three general options under the Constitution for Puerto Rico's status: One, continue its current status as a largely self-governing territory; two, admit Puerto Rico as a State; or three, make Puerto Rico independent. The primary question regarding options is whether the Constitution allows a commonwealth status that could be altered only by mutual consent. Since 1991, the Justice Department has consistently taken the position the Constitution does not. The task force report reaches that conclusion as well. The report, of course, is not a legal brief, but it does outline the reasoning and includes, as appendixes, two extended analyses by the Clinton Justice Department, one of which was sent to this committee in 2001. Thus, the new commonwealth position, as the task force understands it, is not consistent with the Constitution. Any promises that the United States might make regarding Puerto Rico's status as a commonwealth would not and could not be binding on a future Congress. Puerto Rico may remain in its current status indefinitely, but it would remain subject to Congress's authority under the Constitution to regulate U.S. territories. The report provides additional details on the other two permissible options, statehood and independence. Additional copies of the report have been provided to the committee for your convenience. With regard to process, the task force sought to ascertain the will of the people of Puerto Rico in a way that provides clear guidance for future action by Congress. The key is to provide clear guidance, first to speak unambiguously about the constitutional options and second, to structure the process so that popular majorities are likely. The task force therefore recommends a two-step process. The first step is simply to determine whether the people of Puerto Rico wish to remain as they are. We recommend that Congress provide for a federally sanctioned plebiscite on this question. If the vote is to remain as a territory, then the second step would be periodic plebiscites to inform Congress of any change in views. If the first vote is to change Puerto Rico's status, then the second step would be another plebiscite in which the people would choose between statehood and independence. Consistent with our presidential mandate, this recommended process does not seek to prejudice the outcome, even though it is structured to produce a clear outcome. Puerto Ricans have before voted by a majority to remain as a commonwealth. They may do so again. In addition, the process does not preclude action by Puerto Rico itself to express its views. At the first step, the task force recommends a plebiscite to occur on a date certain. If Congress wished to ensure that some action occurred, but not preclude local initiative, it could allow a sufficient period before that date certain. Thank you for this opportunity to share the views of the task force. I have submitted my written statement for the record and I look forward to taking your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Marshall follows:] Prepared Statement of C. Kevin Marshall, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Bingaman, for inviting me to discuss the work and report of the President's task force on Puerto Rico's Status. President Clinton established the Task Force in December 2000, and President Bush has continued it through amendments of President Clinton's Executive Order. The Task Force consists of designees of each member of the President's Cabinet, and the Deputy Assistant to the President and Director for Intergovernmental Affairs, Ruben Barrales. I am a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. As the Attorney General's designee on the Task Force, I serve as its Co-Chair, along with Mr. Barrales. The status of Puerto Rico, and the options regarding that status, have been issues for many years. In 1992, for example, President George H.W. Bush issued a Memorandum that recognized Puerto Rico's popularly approved Commonwealth structure as ``provid[ing] for self-government in respect of internal affairs and administration,'' described Puerto Rico as ``a territory,'' and directed the Executive Branch to treat Puerto Rico as much as legally possible ``as if it were a State.'' He also called for periodically ascertaining ``the will of its people regarding their political status'' through referenda. President Clinton, in his order establishing the Task Force, made it the policy of the Executive Branch ``to help answer the questions that the people of Puerto Rico have asked for years regarding the options for the islands' future status and the process of realizing an option.'' He charged the Task Force with seeking to implement that policy. We are required to ``consider and develop positions on proposals, without preference among the options, for the Commonwealth's future status.'' Our recommendations are limited, however, to options ``that are not incompatible with the Constitution and basic laws and policies of the United States.'' On the same day that he issued his Executive Order, President Clinton also issued a Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies regarding the Resolution of Puerto Rico's status. That memorandum added that ``Puerto Rico's ultimate status has not been determined'' and noted that the three major political parties in Puerto Rico were each ``based on different visions'' for that status. Although Puerto Rico held a plebiscite in 1998, none of the proposed status options received a majority. Indeed, ``None of the Above'' prevailed, because of objection to the ballot definition of the commonwealth option. Some in Puerto Rico have proposed a ``New Commonwealth'' status, under which Puerto Rico would become an autonomous, non-territorial, non-State entity in permanent union with the United States under a covenant that could not be altered without the ``mutual consent'' of Puerto Rico and the federal Government. In October 2000, a few months before President Clinton established the Task Force, the House Committee on Resources held a hearing on a bill (H.R. 4751) incorporating a version of the ``New Commonwealth'' proposal. William Treanor, who held the same position in the Office of Legal Counsel that I now hold, testified that this proposal was not constitutional. Thus, the Task Force's duties were to determine the constitutionally permissible options for Puerto Rico's status and to provide recommendations for a process for realizing an option. We had no duty or authority to take sides among the permissible options. The Task Force considered all status options, including the current status and the New Commonwealth option, objectively and without prejudice. We also attempted to develop a process for Congress to ascertain which of the constitutional options the people of Puerto Rico prefer. We sought input from all interested parties, including Governor Acevedo-Vila. The members met with anyone who requested a meeting. I myself had several meetings with representatives of various positions, and also received and benefited from extensive written materials. The Task Force issued its report last December and concluded that there were three general options under the Constitution for Puerto Rico's status: (1) continue Puerto Rico's current status as a largely self-governing territory of the United States; (2) admit Puerto Rico as a State, on an equal footing with the existing 50 States; or (3) make Puerto Rico independent of the United States. As indicated in my discussion of the 1998 plebiscite and the origins of the Task Force, the primary question regarding options was whether the Constitution currently allows a ``Commonwealth'' status that could be altered only by ``mutual consent,'' such that Puerto Rico could block Congress from altering its status. Since 1991, the Justice Department has, under administrations of both parties, consistently taken the position that the Constitution does not allow such an arrangement. The Task Force report reiterates that position, noting that the Justice Department conducted a thorough review of the question in connection with the work of the Task Force. The report is of course not a legal brief. But it does outline the reasoning, and it includes as appendices two extended analyses by the Clinton Justice Department. The second of these is a January 2001 letter to this Committee, a copy of which was sent to the House Committee on Resources on the same date. The report also cites additional materials such as Mr. Treanor's testimony and the 1991 testimony of the Attorney General. The effect of this legal conclusion is that the ``New Commonwealth'' option, as we understand it, is not consistent with the Constitution. Any promises that the United States might make regarding Puerto Rico's status as a commonwealth would not be binding. Puerto Rico would remain subject to Congress's authority under the Territory Clause of the Constitution ``to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory . . . belonging to the United States.'' Puerto Rico receives a number of benefits from this status, such as favorable tax treatment. And Puerto Rico may remain in its current Commonwealth, or territorial, status indefinitely, but always subject to Congress's ultimate authority to alter the terms of that status, as the Constitution provides that Congress may do with any U.S. territory. The other two options, which are explained in the report, merit only brief mention here. If Puerto Rico were admitted as a State, it would be fully subject to the U.S. Constitution, including the Tax Uniformity Clause. Puerto Rico's favorable tax treatment would generally no longer be allowed. Puerto Rico also would be entitled to vote for presidential electors, Senators, and full voting Members of Congress. Puerto Rico's population would determine the size of its congressional delegation. As for the third option of independence, there are several possible ways of structuring it, so long as it is made clear that Puerto Rico is no longer under United States sovereignty. When the United States made the Philippines independent in 1946, the two nations entered into a Treaty of General Relations. Congress might also provide for a closer relationship along the lines of the ``freely associated states'' of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. The report explains, with a few qualifications, that, ``[a]mong the constitutionally available options, freely associated status may come closest to providing for the relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States that advocates for `New Commonwealth' status appear to desire.'' With regard to process, the Task Force focused on ascertaining the will of the people of Puerto Rico. In particular, we sought to ascertain that will in a way that, as the report puts it, ``provides clear guidance for future action by Congress.'' The keys to providing clear guidance are, first, to speak unambiguously about the options the Constitution allows and, second, to structure the process so that popular majorities are likely. The inconclusive results of the 1998 plebiscite, as well as an earlier one in 1993, did not strike us as providing clear guidance to Congress. We therefore have recommended a two-step process. The first step is simply to determine whether the people of Puerto Rico wish to remain as they are. We recommend that Congress provide for a federally sanctioned plebiscite in which the choice will be whether to continue territorial status. If the vote is to remain as a territory, then the second step, one suggested by the first President Bush's 1992 memorandum, would be to have periodic plebiscites to inform Congress of any change in the will of the people. If the first vote is to change Puerto Rico's status; then the second step would be for Congress to provide for another plebiscite in which the people would choose between statehood and independence, and then to begin a transition toward the selected- option. Ultimate authority of course remains with Congress. Two points about this recommended process merit brief explanation. First, consistent with our presidential mandate, it does not seek to prejudice the outcome; it is structured to produce a clear outcome. At least once before, Puerto Ricans have voted by a majority to retain their current Commonwealth status. They may do so again. But it is critical to be clear about that status. Second, our recommended process does not preclude action by Puerto Rico itself to express its views to Congress. At the first step, we recommend that Congress provide for the plebiscite ``to occur on a date certain.'' We did not, of course, specify that date. But if Congress wished to ensure that some action occurred but not preclude the people of Puerto Rico from taking the initiative, it could allow a sufficient period for local action before that ``date certain.'' If such action occurred and produced a clear result, there might be no need to proceed with the federal plebiscite. The Task Force knows well the importance of the status question to the loyal citizens of Puerto Rico and to the nation as a whole. We appreciate the Committee's commitment to this matter and the opportunity to share our views. Senator Craig [presiding]. Well, Kevin, thank you very much for that statement. I'm sure my colleagues have questions. Senator Domenici has stepped out and will be back in a few moments, but we'll continue to proceed through the panel and to build this record. Please describe the process involved in putting the task force together. Also, please describe what Federal agencies were involved and to what extent the political parties of Puerto Rico were involved in the process. Mr. Marshall. The composition of the task force is determined by the Executive Order establishing it, under which every cabinet agency has a representative on the task force. I'm the representative of the Attorney General. Every other cabinet agency was represented. I remember your second part, what was the third part of your question? Senator Craig. Political parties. Mr. Marshall. The members of the task force, particularly my co-chair and my predecessor in my current position, met with representatives of all the political parties in Puerto Rico. Senator Craig. And your sense is by doing that they felt they had adequate input into the process? Mr. Marshall. I can't speak for them, but they did provide input. Whether they consider it adequate or not, I don't know. Senator Craig. Some have argued that there is an ``irrevocable compact'' between the United States and Puerto Rico. Can you please discuss the validity of that statement? Mr. Marshall. The task force concludes that view is incorrect. That's a view that the Justice Department first took in 1959 and was repeated many times since then. I don't think that's a fair reading of what Public Law 600 tried to do, and as we also explained, even if it had tried to do that, it would violate the Constitution. Senator Craig. So your basis for finding or viewing that as different from the earlier status was you viewed it as a violation of the Constitution, to have it interpreted as irrevocable; is that correct? Mr. Marshall. We don't think it should be interpreted as irrevocable. If it were, that would violate the Constitution. Senator Craig. OK, I see. In your testimony--in his testimony, the Governor says that one of the disturbing conclusions of the report is that the U.S. citizens born in Puerto Rico may be deprived of their citizenship at any time because of the statutory nature of it. Would you comment? Would you please make comment on that observation? Mr. Marshall. The task force addresses citizenship of Puerto Ricans only in one context, which is if Puerto Rico were to become independent. If Puerto Rico became a State, I think it's pretty obvious that Puerto Ricans would be citizens, and if Puerto Rico remains as a territory, I don't think there is any likelihood that Congress would try to revoke that citizenship, so it wasn't something we even needed to address. Senator Craig. OK. The report makes findings regarding the mutual consent provisions of a new commonwealth. Was there an analysis made of other provisions of that proposal, and if so, would you please provide it to the committee? Mr. Marshall. I'm not sure what other provisions are in question. The focus of the task force was on the constitutionality of a mutual consent provision. Senator Craig. And that was the scope of your---- Mr. Marshall. That is what we were focusing on, is what options the Constitution allows. Senator Craig. Well then, please describe the current status, in reference to your report, of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, that the report finds. Mr. Marshall. Our view is that constitutionally, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is a territory, but it is a territory that has a large amount of self-government authority with regard to its internal affairs. Senator Craig. Thank you. Mr. Chairman. The Chairman [presiding]. Thank you very much, Senator. Now I yield to Senator Bingaman. Senator Bingaman. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Marshall, let me ask, is it your position that the report that you have helped co-chair here represents the views of the Bush administration? Do the recommendations in that report represent the views of the Bush administration or is there some difference between task force recommendations and what you believe the Bush administration supports? Mr. Marshall. The administration has not taken any public position on the task force report, but the Executive Order creating the task force didn't contemplate that the President would publicly approve or disapprove of the report. So a direct answer to your question--whether there is any difference between the administration and the task force report--I would just say I don't know. Senator Bingaman. So, at this time, we do not have a position by the administration; is that an accurate statement? Mr. Marshall. Yes. Senator Bingaman. I know in Governor Acevedo's testimony, he refers to a memorandum by Charles Cooper and Michael Reisman. Have you had a chance to review those? Do you have any response to those that you could provide, either for the record or a shortened response at this point? Mr. Marshall. Mr. Cooper, as I understood it, represented-- the Governor and I met with him and other lawyers at least twice and they provided me the memoranda in support of the new commonwealth position, particularly in support of its constitutionality. And I reviewed those and we considered those and our public response to those is the report itself. Senator Bingaman. So you disagreed with his conclusions? Mr. Marshall. Yes. Senator Bingaman. The report, the task force report, notes that the United States has established these successful free- association relationships with three new nations within the former U.S.-administered trust territory of the Pacific Islands. There are important differences, obviously, between the situation in Puerto Rico and in those areas, but I wonder if the U.S. model for free association should be more fully explored to see if it can help in developing a solution to Puerto Rico's status issue. Do you have a view on that? Mr. Marshall. What the report says is that the free association model seemed to us to come closest to what the new commonwealth position wants, within the constraints of the Constitution. As you suggest, there would be policy considerations as to whether and how that might work with regard to Puerto Rico. The one that the report flags is the large difference in population between Puerto Rico and those three Pacific territories. Senator Bingaman. OK. We have two bills that have been introduced here in the Senate, as I understand it, in response to the task force report. There is S. 2304, which would provide congressional authorization for a constitutional convention in Puerto Rico with the purpose of proposing to Congress a new compact of association or statehood or independence, and there is S. 2661, which would authorize the first plebiscite that is recommended by your task force. Could you give us any initial reaction to these proposals? Do you have any thoughts as to where Congress needs to go with these proposals? Mr. Marshall. Well, the administration hasn't taken position on either of those bills, so I don't think it would be proper for me to do that here. I would just say that to the extent the bills are consistent with what the report recommends, then the task force would think that they are good ideas. Senator Bingaman. So you would basically say that S. 2661 is consistent with the task force report? Is that what I would be led to believe? Mr. Marshall. I am not intimate enough with that bill to answer that question directly. Senator Bingaman. OK. All right. That's all I had, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator. Now I believe it's time to go to Senator Martinez, if you have questions. Let's sort of get ourselves organized here. It's 3:05 and we haven't gotten to the second panel, which consists of three people who want to talk. What do you think? Do you have questions? Senator Martinez. Not of Mr. Marshall. I don't have any questions for Mr. Marshall. The Chairman. No question of this? Senator Martinez. No. The Chairman. All right. Senator Salazar, do you have any questions of Mr. Marshall? Senator Salazar. No. The Chairman. You're welcome to now. I'm not trying to-- there is time. Senator Salazar. You scare me, Senator, so---- [Laughter.] Senator Salazar. I'm kidding. The Chairman. I didn't mean to scare him. Senator Salazar. No, no, Senator, I'm satisfied. I don't have any questions. The Chairman. OK. Senator Salazar. Thank you. The Chairman. We'll come to you, sir. Senator Salazar. I think the report is self-explanatory. My own view, frankly, is that the legislative proposal that we came up with was different from what the task force recommended. And that's with respect to the legislation that we introduced. But I think that at the end of the day, this dialog is important to begin with and I think that the task force report did initiate the beginning of this dialog and it's obviously a dialog that will continue into the next Congress. So thank you, Mr. Marshall. Mr. Marshall. Thank you. The Chairman. Thank you very much. The Senator from New Jersey, Senator Menendez. Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do have a few questions. The Chairman. Please, if you can keep the time to a minimum, I would appreciate it. Senator Menendez. Well, I will do my best, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you very much. Senator Menendez. Mr. Marshall, how many official visits to Puerto Rico did the task force, as a body, make? Mr. Marshall. As I indicated before, the co-chairman went to Puerto Rico at least twice. Senator Menendez. So the answer to my question is none? Mr. Marshall. As an entire task force, I believe the answer is none. Senator Menendez. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, are they not? Mr. Marshall. Yes. Senator Menendez. How many of them were on the task force? Mr. Marshall. None. Senator Menendez. None. Did the task force conduct any public hearings in Puerto Rico? Mr. Marshall. I don't believe it conducted formal public hearings. It met with representatives of the each of the political parties. Senator Menendez. And respecting the leadership of all those political parties, the people of Puerto Rico did not have a say? Did you not conduct any public hearings so that people in Puerto Rico could have a say? Mr. Marshall. Well, I believe the people of Puerto Rico select the leaders of those political parties. Senator Menendez. Do we not have public hearings where U.S. citizens can come and express their views on different matters? So the bottom line is, you had no public hearings? Mr. Marshall. I don't think so, no. Senator Menendez. I find it hard to take a report seriously when it has no participation of the Puerto Rican community, when it has no public hearings, and ultimately, it fails to listen to the views of the people whose destiny is ultimately going to be determined. I don't quite understand it. Let me ask you this: I know that your co-chair, Mr. Barrales, is not here testifying before us today, but he has largely been the public face of that task force, in terms of the trips that he took to Puerto Rico and speaking with others. Are you aware that, as the co-chair of the task force, in July 2004, he went to Puerto Rico and publicly expressed his support for Puerto Rico becoming the 51st State? Mr. Marshall. I'm not aware that he expressed public approval of statehood. I am aware that he made that trip. Senator Menendez. OK. If I were to give you a press report, would it improve your recollection? Mr. Marshall. It's not an issue of my recollection, Senator. I was not on the task force in 2004. I joined it in the spring of 2005. Senator Menendez. Oh, OK. Mr. Chairman, if I can, if we can have for the record a copy of a report that had Mr. Barrales going before a crowd of 40,000 and saying, as the head of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, that he would like to see Puerto Rico become a State. I think it is important for the record to reflect it. The Chairman. But what would the purpose be? I have no objection at all. Senator Menendez. The purpose is to--he was a co-chair of the task force. The question of the task force was, at the end of the day, to determine a process that isn't stacked. How is it that the co-chair goes and says that he is for a specific option of the three options? I think it is important for the record to reflect that. The Chairman. We're going to make--we're going to put it in the record. [The information follows:] Barrales Supports Statehood For Puerto Rico Puerto Rico Herald July 28, 2004 San Juan, July 27 (EFE)--A White House official expressed support for statehood for Puerto Rico at an event Tuesday in which thousands commemorated the 147th anniversary of the birth of pro-statehood leader Jose Celso Barbosa. Ruben Barrales, head of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, said he would like to see 51 stars on the U.S. flag. Barrales' speech before a crowd of more than 40,000 people on Barbosa square in Bayamon, a city next to San Juan, prompted approving shouts and prolonged applause. Michelle Cuevas, spokeswoman for the pro-statehood New Progressive Party, told EFE that Barrales attended the event in representation of President George W. Bush, and that his statements had the backing of the White House. She could not state categorically, however, whether Barrales spoke in Bush's name. Barrales said Puerto Rico would be better off if it had a permanent relationship with the United States to help it achieve its objectives. Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My last question is, one of the issues most concerning to me in this report states that the Federal Government may relinquish U.S. sovereignty by granting independence or by ceding the territory to another nation. Doesn't that statement create the potential for undue panic and fear by implying that Puerto Rico can be bartered or sold at whim? Mr. Marshall. I'm unaware of any panic that has occurred since the report came out. And I would think that, as a practical matter, given that Public Law 600 has operated for over 60 years, it's not likely to create panic simply to state what the law is. Senator Menendez. Well, you know, the bottom line is that clearly you don't believe that the United States would cede Puerto Rico to another nation, do you? Is that in any way the expression of this administration's view? Mr. Marshall. No. I would say that the--after I testified at the House and received some questions on that question, what we said is, there is a difference between what is technically legally permissible and what is desirable or wise or---- Senator Menendez. Let me ask you one last question. Do you really--just to clear the record, do you see any circumstances under which Puerto Ricans, as U.S. citizens, those who have worn the uniform of the United States for a long history, would, in fact, lose their citizenship, short of seeking a status of independence? Even in that case, would you see any way in which they would lose their citizenship in the United States? Mr. Marshall. Short of seeking independence, no. If there were independence, it would be a question that would need to be resolved in figuring out the details of independence. Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you very much. Senator, if you had any additional questions that you would like submitted to the witness for him to answer during the next 30 days-- Senator Menendez. I do, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. We will just do that. Let the record reflect if the Senator desires to ask additional questions of you, Mr. Marshall, you can have 30 days to do it and you'll have 10 days to return questions, if you would. Mr. Marshall. That sounds fair. The Chairman. If it's not fair, it's too bad. [Laughter.] The Chairman. Isn't that right? Senator Menendez. Absolutely. I'm with you. The Chairman. We've established the rules here. We don't ask questions. Senator Menendez. That's why I said they are fair. The Chairman. All right. So now, we're going to go to Senator Salazar. Senator, we haven't heard from you. Do you want to inquire? If you have any questions you might submit for him to answer---- Senator Salazar. I might have some written questions that I might submit, but I haven't had time. The Chairman. All right. Thank you very much, Mr. Marshall. You are excused. Mr. Marshall. Thank you. The Chairman. We'll have the next witnesses please come up and take your seats at the table. Panel No. 2. The Honorable Anibal Acevedo--is it Vee-yo or Villa? Governor Acevedo-Vila. It's Vila. The Chairman. Vila. The Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Honorable Luis Fortuno, U.S. Congressman, thank you, sir. And the third is the Honorable Ruben Berrios Martinez, President, Puerto Rican Independent Party, San Juan, Puerto Rico. Did I say your name correctly? Bueno. Gracias. Vayamos, adelante, no? Eso no es, esta bien, excusame, no puedo hablar muy bien, vamos a comenzamos con el govenador. The Chairman. Thank you very much for joining us and for all the time and trouble you've gone to come here today. Please proceed. STATEMENT OF HON. ANIBAL ACEVEDO-VILA, GOVERNOR OF PUERTO RICO Governor Acevedo-Vila. Muchas gracias. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Mr. Ranking Member and all the other members. For the record, my name is Anibal Acevedo-Vila. I am the Governor of Puerto Rico and also the President of the Popular Democratic Party. Along with my testimony, I am submitting, for the record, two legal studies that ought to be read carefully by all members of this Committee. One is a memorandum on the constitutionality of the commonwealth, prepared by Charles Cooper, the former head of the Office of Legal Counsel at the U.S. Department of Justice. The other is the Reisman Memorandum, prepared by Michael Reisman, Professor of International Law at Yale Law School and one of the most respected scholars on international law and relations. These two studies compliment each other and I urge you to read them carefully. When you compare the scope of these studies with the 1-page report by the President's task force on Puerto Rico's Status, you will understand why this report cannot be the basis for any serious self-determination process. This report cannot be the basis for the future. Volumes have been written on the legal and constitutional aspect of the status of Puerto Rico; however, the report, under the title of Legal Analysis, dedicates only four and a half pages to analyze the whole legal conundrum on Puerto Rico's status. The Cooper Memorandum had been submitted to the members of the President's task force several months before the report was issued. Together with the Reisman Memorandum, which was produced after the report, you can get an in-depth understanding of both U.S. constitutional law and international law applicable to the political status of Puerto Rico. Beyond the lack of depth and real analysis, there are four conclusions that are particularly disturbing in this report. No. 1, that Congress can directly legislate and change the island government structure unilaterally. The logical consequences of this conclusion is that this Congress can abolish the Puerto Rico legislation, fire the Governor, and tomorrow, appoint an emperor or whoever you want to rule Puerto Rico. That is the only logical consequences of this all-or- nothing view of the territorial clause of the Constitution that the report puts forth. Second, that the Federal Government may relinquish U.S. sovereignty by sending Puerto Rico to another Nation. And I heard Mr. Marshall respond to that question. Forget about the legal analysis--even legally, that's not possible. That's an interpretation that we are a piece of land with no political rights. We're not a piece of land. We're a people. And that report says that we can be given for some currency to China or maybe we might be the solution in Iraq. No. 3, that the U.S. citizens born in Puerto Rico may be deprived of their citizenship at any time because of the statutory nature of it. And I also heard a response to that, and actually, that was a clear contradiction of the principle that one Congress cannot buy the next one, because when he was pressed, he said, no, no, no, that's only in the case of independence. But Puerto Rico was a territory until 1917 with no U.S. citizenship. So if you think it is good, that report, that means that tomorrow--that report is telling you that you have the power, tomorrow, to pass another law saying that we are no longer U.S. citizens. I bet anyone to do that and see what the Supreme Court of the United States would do with that. Fourth, that the Constitution somehow prohibits the U.S. Government from entering into a relationship with Puerto Rico based on mutual consent. The Cooper Memorandum explains in great detail just how ridiculous and legally wrong is the mantra repeated in their report that Congress may not bind itself to a relationship based on mutual consent. The Reisman Memorandum discusses not only the applicable U.S. constitutional law, but also international law, and reaches similar conclusions. The authors of the report attempt to unjustifiably limit the options available to the people of Puerto Rico in order to create an artificial majority for its statehood. This report does not provide the basis of any legitimate process of self-determination. As of today, 11 months after the publication of the report, President Bush has not said a word about it. The President is silent and with good reasons. I respect the fact that many Puerto Ricans have legitimate reasons to favor full independence or statehood. I am willing to debate in any public forum why I think the autonomous alternative for commonwealth is the best choice today for Puerto Rico. I'm willing to let the people decide their future status to what is truly a democratic process, but no Puerto Ricans should be forced to accept the premises and conclusions of this report, no matter what political advantage they might think they can get out of it. What's the next step? The problem with the report is that they lay out a twisted process for a referendum that will unfairly stack the deck in favor of statehood. You need to understand, in every plebiscite with the three options, commonwealth has been the winner--46, 48, 49 percent--second, statehood, and in third place, independence. By laying out a process in which it is yes or no to commonwealth--not only using their ill-defined way to describe it, but even if it were in a definition acceptable to us--what you will be doing is adding the second and the third place to defeat the first place and then have a run of election between the second and the third one in which the winner takes all. That's not only undemocratic, that's un-American. And I am here to call this Senate to give the people of Puerto Rico a fair process. The bill introduced by Senator Burr, Senator Lott, Senator Menendez, and Senator Kennedy gives that to the people of Puerto Rico. It only says we, Congress, recognize that you have the self-determination right; that we, Congress, recognize that you can call a constitutional convention and once through that process, you make a decision, and we will respond. It's a fair process, it's an inclusive process, and it's a process that will start in Puerto Rico, not a process like the one recommended by this report in which Congress, if they are following that recommendation would basically be making that decision of the final outcome on behalf of the people of Puerto Rico. And that's a decision that should be all the time in the hands of the people of Puerto Rico. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Governor Acevedo-Vila follows:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Anibal Acevedo-Vila, Governor of Puerto Rico Mr. Chairman and Members of this Committee: My name is Anibal Acevedo-Vila. I am the Governor of Puerto Rico and President of the Popular Democratic Party. It is a pleasure to be back here. As you all know, I served in the U.S. House of Representatives as the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico from 2001-2004 and I am truly glad to be back. I appreciate the interest that this Committee has shown in dealing with such an important issue for all Puerto Ricans. Along with my testimony, I am submitting for the record two legal studies that ought to be read carefully by all the members of this Committee. One is a memorandum on the constitutionality of the Commonwealth prepared by Charles J. Cooper, a former head of the Office of Legal Counsel at the U.S. Department of Justice. The other is a recent memorandum prepared by W. Michael Reisman, Professor of International Law at Yale Law School and one of the most respected scholars on international law and relations. These two studies complement each other and I urge you to read them carefully. When you compare the scope and depth of these studies with the 14 page Report by the President's task force on Puerto Rico Status, you will understand why this report cannot be the basis for any serious self-determination process. It has been a long journey for the Puerto Rican people. This Report cannot be the basis for the future. I sincerely hope that this hearing is only the beginning of a broad and inclusive process, not limited to the political parties. The status of Puerto Rico is such a fundamental issue for us that I urge you to be as inclusive as possible. And more importantly, I hope that these efforts result in a true Self Determination process. The topic of this hearing is the Report issued by the President's task force on Puerto Rico's Status on December 22, 2005. First, let me focus on some-of the legal conclusions of the report that are most questionable. Volumes have been written on the legal and constitutional aspects of the status of Puerto Rico. The scholarly debate is rich, complex and extensive. However, the Report under the title of Legal Analysis, dedicates only 4 and a half pages to analyze the whole legal conundrum of Puerto Rico's status. If this was a college paper, it would get a grade of D^--and that from a lenient and merciful professor. It seems that the drafters of the Report were so eager to get to the conclusions that they forgot to support them and to discuss the applicable law altogether. The Cooper memorandum that I am submitting to the record had been submitted to the members of the President's task force several months before the report was issued. Together with the Reisman memorandum, you can get an in depth analysis of both U.S. Constitutional Law and International Law applicable to the political relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico. In light of the weight of authorities cited in these memos, it is perplexing that the Task Force Report does not even attempt to mount a legal defense of its conclusions. Some of these conclusions pretend to be supported by a 14 page Department of Justice memorandum on Guam, which as you will see is completely discredited by the thorough legal analysis in the Cooper and Reisman memoranda. Beyond the lack of depth and real analysis, there are 4 conclusions that are particularly disturbing of this Report. i. that congress can directly legislate and change the island's governmental structure unilaterally The logical consequence of this conclusion is that this Congress can abolish the Puerto Rico legislature, fire the Governor and appoint an Emperor. That is the only logical consequence of this formalistic-- all or nothing--view of the territorial clause of the Constitution that the report puts forth. ii. that the federal government may relinquish u.s. sovereignty by ceding puerto rico to another nation Another logical consequence of this conclusion is that maybe you can trade us to the People's Republic of China for some currency value concessions. It is embarrassing that in this day and age, Federal officials will put such a conclusion on paper. It really calls into question the seriousness of this entire exercise. iii. that the u.s. citizens born in puerto rico may be deprived of their citizenship at any time because of the statutory nature of it Here, I would like to see how the U.S. Courts will rule on an attempt to deprive Puerto Ricans in Florida and in New York of their U.S. citizenship. The analysis, or lack thereof, of the issue of citizenship is painful. The drafters of the Report adopt without discussion the legal position advocated by some that Congress can revoke the U.S. citizenship of the people of Puerto Rico because we are, allegedly, merely statutory citizens. They do this ignoring vast case law and legal scholars that sustain the contrary position. This report, at a time in which we are discussing immigration in America and the rights of foreign workers in this country, is outrageous. This report, issued in times of war when our brothers and sisters are sent into harms way in Iraq, is a shame. iv. that the constitution somehow prohibits the u.s. government from entering into a relationship with puerto rico based on mutual consent The Cooper memorandum explains in great detail just how ludicrous and legally wrong is the mantra repeated in the Report that the Congress may not bind itself to a relationship based on mutual consent. The Reisman memorandum discusses not only the applicable U.S. Constitutional Law, but also international law, and reaches similar conclusions. The task force report ignores over 200 years of precedent and current legal trends. It is our position that both, the Constitution of the United States and international law, allows the United States and the people of a territory to enter into a bilateral and binding political relationship. The authors of the Report attempt to unjustifiably limit the options available to the people of Puerto Rico in order to create an artificial majority for statehood. All of these conclusions, if adopted by the United States, would have tremendous political and legal repercussions. The Report also casts grave doubt as to the value of the commitments made by the United States to the world since in 1952 the United Nations removed Puerto Rico specifically from its list of non- self-governing territories based on representations from both the United States and Puerto Rico. General Assembly Resolution 748 (VIII) recognized ``that the people of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, by expressing their will in a free and democratic way, have achieved a new constitutional status'' and that ``in the framework of their Constitution and of the compact agreed upon with the United States of America, the people of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have been invested with attributes of political sovereignty which clearly identify the status of self-government attained by the Puerto Rican people as that of an autonomous political entity''. As Professor Reisman concludes in his memo, ``as a matter of international law . . . since 1952, Puerto Rico has ostensibly existed as a state freely associated with the United States of America.'' Puerto Rico, thereafter, attained a new status not only under international law, but also under U.S. constitutional law since it no longer could be treated as an unincorporated territory subject to the plenary powers of Congress under the Territorial Clause. Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick just couldn't make it more evident when in a recent New York Times Op-Ed stated ``quite unbelievably, the Task Force raised questions about Puerto Rico's status that reminded us of what we heard from the Cuban delegation and its communist allies'' 25 years ago. This Report does not provide the basis for any legitimate process of self-determination. As of today, eleven months after the publication of the Report, President Bush has not said a word about it. The President is silent and with good reasons. I respect the fact that many Puerto Ricans have legitimate reasons to favor full independence or statehood. I am willing to debate in any public forum why I think the autonomous alternative of the Commonwealth is the best choice today for Puerto Rico. I am willing to let the people decide their future status through a truly democratic process. But no Puerto Rican should be forced to accept the premises and conclusions of this report no matter what political advantage they may think they can get out of it. No American citizen should accept the implications of this report. Pro-statehood citizens should not favor statehood because they are threatened or scared by a purposefully biased report. Puerto Ricans should not be scared into voting for statehood because otherwise they may be ceded to Pakistan. what is the next step? The problem with the Report is that they lay out a twisted process for a referendum that would unfairly stack the deck in favor of statehood. What this report does is an outrageous mathematical exercise. In order to ignore the Commonwealth option, the proposed two- stage process adds all the possible votes against Commonwealth, to knock that option out in the first round. In every plebiscite held in Puerto Rico, Commonwealth has won. Statehood has never won. This report tries to change that by creating an artificial majority. The math is simple. If you add the second place--statehood-- to the third place--independence--then you can fabricate an artificial majority against the real majority, the Commonwealth. It is very simple, although perve"
