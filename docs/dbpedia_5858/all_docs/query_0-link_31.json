Rural speech patterns portrayed the Puerto Rican-born criollo view of the world and gave hope to the jíbaros, the rural poor, to attain education and gain employment, even in times of hardship.\" - Antonio's Will\n\nEl Gibaro (or El Jíbaro) are reprints of the original book by Dr. Manuel A. Alonso (1822-1889), a physician who was considered the first Puerto Rican writer of notable importance.\n\nP. de Bayoán (paperback in Spanish)\n\n​P. de Bayoán (e-book in Spanish)\n\nP. de Bayoán (hardcover in English)\n\nEugenio María de Hostos (1839–1903), known as \"The Great Citizen of the Americas\"), was a Puerto Rican educator, philosopher, intellectual, lawyer, sociologist, and Puerto Rican independence advocate. He wrote his most notable work, the novel \"La Peregrinación de Bayoán\" in 1963, which was initially censored by Spain. The book mirrors Hostos' own quest for value, purpose, and meaning of life.\n\nLa Cuarterona/The Quadroon (e-book)\n\nLa Cuarterona/The Quadroon (paperback)\n\n(Dual Language Spanish/English Edition)\n\nAlejandro Tápia y Rivera (1826–1882) was a Puerto Rican poet, dramaturg, essayist and writer. Considered to be the father of Puerto Rican literature, he was also an abolitionist and a women's rights advocate. He supports these causes in La Cuarterona, a three-act play about a romance forbidden by race and social class.\n\nThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer\n\n(paperback) (e-book)\n\nLas Aventuras de Tom Sawyer\n\n(paperback) (e-book)\n\n“Do you know who Samuel Langhorne Clemens is, Antonio?” Bessie asked.\n\n“No, chood I?” he said. ...\n\n“He is best known as Mark Twain, the author of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.” .. \"He worked as a brakeman on the Schoharie railroad station on D\n\nThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer\n\n(paperback) (e-book)\n\nLas Aventuras de Tom Sawyer\n\n(paperback) (e-book)\n\n“Do you know who Samuel Langhorne Clemens is, Antonio?” Bessie asked.\n\n“No, chood I?” he said. ...\n\n“He is best known as Mark Twain, the author of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.” .. \"He worked as a brakeman on the Schoharie railroad station on Depot Street the winter of 1879, three years after he wrote his famous book,” Bessie said.\n\n“Why would he do that, a famos author?” Antonio asked.\n\n“A self-published author, I should add.”\n\n- Antonio's Will"
