Among other things, I am interested in examining the process by which Dominican intellectuals at the turn of the twentieth century forged a common sense of purpose that befitted what they felt were new circumstances—hence their conviction that the time was ripe for sweeping change. This line of inquiry follows a long succession of theoretical explorations on the rise of nation-states and on the development of a sense of nationhood in the age of modernity. For the Latin American case specifically, scholars have asked: How did elites embrace the masses as part of the nation they set out to construct, once independence was achieved and the former colonies became states in their own right? In the Dominican Republic, this query becomes complicated by the fact that the state was formally inaugurated in 1844 with independence from Haiti, and yet political leaders compromised the island’s sovereignty repeatedly by inviting foreign powers to rule over the country until 1865. Moreover, elites did not engage in deliberate nation-building until much later—perhaps 1879, with the ascent of the Azul (Blue) brand of Liberalism to power, or as late as 1899, with the death of President Ulises Heureaux. The shaping of collective notions of national identity, then, involved the recasting of metropolitan representations of colonial (and postcolonial) Dominicans and the creation of useful self-images on the part of the country’s elite late in the course of state formation.∞ A number of assumptions underlie the statements above, and I must clarify my take on the processes scholars of nationalism have identified as central. It goes without saying that I am concerned with the socially constructed aspects of national identity—with the function of men of letters in the forging of a sense of nationhood, with the collaborations of men of state, and with those actions of their ‘‘inferiors’’ that contributed to this process.\n\nH\n\nEmphasizing as I do the subjective nature of nationalism, I see it also as an ongoing practice, one in which powerful (because educated) actors project an inevitably self-serving discourse meant to manipulate their subordinate (and illiterate) associates, who are themselves deploying their own notions of participation and fairness through daily interactions. As did Florencia Mallon when she enhanced our understanding of hegemony as both process and result,≤ I privilege the negotiated aspects of nation-building, as shaped by forces both internal to the Dominican Republic and outside the national territory.≥ In denying that any one actor had primacy in this eminently fluid context, I am also looking at the ‘‘articulations that support and fracture the nation,’’ at the several locations from which historical players sought to constitute the national community.∂ The working out of the ‘‘invention’’ that is Dominicanness, then, is for my purposes predicated on the material context in which human beings interacted and thus straddles the ideological plane that elites presumably inhabited and the lived experience that supposedly solely fueled the behavior of their lesser neighbors. In this book, nationalism is invented, always underway, both verbal and physical, and definitely political.∑ A secondary premise in this book is that the construction of the nation takes place at many levels, some—most—of which I only make a passing reference to. One such context that seems central to the Dominican case in the early twentieth century is the relationship between the Dominican Republic and the United States, between the political leadership of both countries, and between the ideologues of each. Having adopted Mallon’s notion of the process of nation-building in Latin America as a ‘‘struggle over citizenship and liberty’’ to gain ‘‘nationalism and democracy,’’ the looming presence of North American political and ideological interests in the region has to be taken into account. If, internally, states have erected a political edifice that they deploy as natural to dominate their citizens, the same process, I believe, was taking place internationally in this period as the United States installed in the Caribbean its own ideas of democratic government and citizen participation with the weight of universal principles. This is not to say that the United States imposed wholesale its vision of participatory politics and free market capitalism on the Dominican Republic. As is true of the state-level workings of hegemony, what gets elevated as a common project exists through coercion and consent, and negotiation and contention were part and parcel of the process of national anticolonial a≈rmation for Dominicans.∏ Dominican historiography has generally treated the development of national consciousness as a spontaneous process, activated in the heart of a xii\n\nT\n\npreface\n\ncommunity bound by territory, language, and culture; fixed in time and place; and hegemonic in its outcome. Several scholars have set out to determine precisely when and how Dominican national identity was formed. They have come up with numerous dates or historical moments and an even greater variety of events that promoted, until it was achieved, a sense of ‘‘lo dominicano’’ (that which is Dominican). For these authors, the sources of Dominicanness tended to be heroic occurrences in which the best of the national character was exposed and subsequently permeated the whole of society. In one familiar account, the sequence of events is strictly chronological. In the early nineteenth century, residents of the eastern part of the island disassociated themselves from the revolting slaves of the west and gravitated toward ‘‘civilized’’ Europe (France, and when possible, Spain). Rejecting annexation and finding that independence was a viable option, Dominicans turned their backs on Spain after 1865. Threatened by the United States in the early 1900s, a virulent nationalism, with renewed Hispanic roots, dominated the first half of the twentieth century.π Another current of thought has fixated on the geographical origins of Dominicanness. The leading candidate for the birthplace of the national character is the rich agricultural north, the Cibao, the prosperous land of moderate-sized tobacco holdings, owned by established families of Spanish descent, who were the mainstay of Liberal politics. Although José Joaquín Hungría Morell favors the inclusion of the capital, Santo Domingo, as a player in the process, interpretations that highlight the a∆uence, the whiteness, and the nonimmigrant origins of the inhabitants of Santiago and the surrounding countryside have to this day held more sway in popular conceptions of what is truly Dominican. A recent addition to the ‘‘geographical location’’ variety of a sense of nationalism has been Lauren Derby’s work, which pinpoints the Dominico-Haitian border as the cradle of national identity, ‘‘the site where power relations on the island have been measured throughout the centuries.’’ In her provocative article on the changing concept of raza (in its common usage, as nation) in the early twentieth century, Derby recounts the story of how Haitians became ‘‘foreigners’’ who threatened the Dominican nation precisely at the time dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo was beginning to include border Dominicans in the body politic.∫ A sizable group of writers leans toward broader cultural interpretations of the phenomenon, even if only at the theoretical level. They define ‘‘the nation’’ as a collectivity, attached to a particular geographic area, with common blood ties, values, beliefs, history, and goals. Oftentimes implicit in this interpretation is the notion, both current and attributed to previous generations, that Dominicans acquired a sense of self as a function of the proximity preface\n\nT\n\nxiii\n\nof Haiti, its racial, cultural, and national ‘‘other’’ for the entire nineteenth century.Ω A sense of nationhood that was based, as these explanations suggest, on intrinsic traits that either emerged at crucial points in time, were a function of geography, or simply evolved through accidents of time and place appears permanent and unchanging. In these broadly defined conceptions, national identity is constructed as an organic occurrence, prompted by popular events or reinforced by everyday practice and firmly in place. In this scheme, the initial sources of existing notions of lo dominicano are rarely questioned, and the functions of current conceptualizations remain unchallenged. There is a practical reason for this elaborate, and seemingly antiintellectual, search for the roots of Dominican national identity. Trujillo, the darkest political figure in Dominican history, and his minions were responsible in the 1930s for the most brilliant exposition of the essence of Dominicanness. Based as it was on a fabled Hispanic heritage and on a jingoistic rejection of Haitians, and deployed by Trujillo’s own intelligentsia, this brand of national consciousness succeeded in incorporating the generality of the population in a common discourse of progress and therefore installing Trujillo as the founder of the Dominican nation.∞≠ Progressive intellectuals, outraged by what they viewed as a flagrant rewriting of the past for Trujillo’s benefit, set out after his assassination to set the record straight for posterity. Marxists endeavored to discover traces of a national bourgeoisie in the early twentieth century that, if not willing to mobilize the common folk for a more equitable future, was capable of standing up to the United States, whose increasingly overbearing presence in Dominican economic, financial, and political a√airs threatened Dominican sovereignty.∞∞ More recently, writers have focused on the role of the intelligentsia at the turn of the last century in building the discursive apparatus of nationalism.∞≤ As did others in the past, including Trujillo’s ideologues, these authors constructed a national history that traced the development of Dominicanness through a series of momentous circumstances that shaped it until complete. In their writings, the process appears inevitable, and the historical actors that participated in key events play their parts as required. Perhaps unaware that they themselves had an agenda as they, too, constructed history, Dominican scholars since the 1960s have also created a notion of nationalism as instinctive (not artificial), disinterested (not for direct political application), generalized (not limited to a specific group), and static (unchanging). Two very recent contributions to the conversation about nationalism, modernity, and citizenship come from outside the Dominican Republic. Richard Lee Turits and Pedro San Miguel have each revisited the Trujillato with fresh eyes in search of both the discursive and the material bases for the xiv\n\nT\n\npreface\n\ndictator’s longevity in power. The inclusion of the peasantry in the polis and in the discourse of progress, both conclude, explains Trujillo’s long-lasting political appeal. The ‘‘poetic’’ national project of the early twentieth century received a ‘‘political injection’’ in the 1930s, and so, according to these authors, the largest component of the Dominican population that remained outside the formal political apparatus was brought into the fold—‘‘domesticated,’’ to use a word now part of the Dominicanist lexicon. According to these authors, it was Trujillo who succeeded in inserting the final piece into the national puzzle: the incorporation of the peasantry into the political life of the country.∞≥ Contrary to the foregoing, I argue in this book that a generation of men actively shaped Dominican turn-of-the-century nationalism by launching a comprehensive and forward-looking discourse, which they hoped would capture the imagination of the population as a whole at a critical juncture of Dominican political, economic, and social life. This intellectual elite, I maintain, found little inspiration in the events that punctuated the country’s past—the so-called Haitian domination, the flirtations with European states with a view to protectorate status, the return to the Spanish fold, the constant civil strife after the restoration of the republic—and concentrated instead on outlining a brilliant future, based on the far-reaching changes they promoted. Their definition of what constituted the nation was, moreover, inclusive, which is not to say that men of letters embraced indiscriminately the West Indian and Haitian migrants, the working class, and the bourgeois women, who made up the country’s lesser inhabitants. On the contrary, these communities were to be incorporated into the national project, first textually and then practically, once their loyalties were reorganized, their minds educated, and their behavior made to conform.∞∂ I concur with Dominican historians in the significance of the ‘‘common people’’ (el pueblo llano) in shaping the national discourse and in forging their own variants of political and cultural processes, but the conclusions I reach might appear unconventional by Dominican standards. I give proof in this book for a popular basis for nationalism, which I call in this manifestation ‘‘citizenship’’ and which I locate in the cities. It was urban centers that contained the combination of cultural accoutrements (the schools, the newspapers, the economic opportunities) and human material (some of it from the much-maligned countryside) necessary for ‘‘civilization’’ (read ‘‘citizenship’’). Independently of the existence of deliberate e√orts to incorporate or co-opt their interests by higher-ups, I submit, the urban underclasses persistently acted to preserve their well-being in the face of o≈cial or peer attempts, deliberate or unintentional, to limit their activity—these were preface\n\nT\n\nxv\n\nnothing if not exercises in participatory politics, rooted in an as yet undeveloped notion of entitlement. Ultimately, in viewing Dominican identity as a mutable (therefore inclusive) fellowship of values (and not an exclusive community of descent, based on fixed, distinguishing qualities, such as language, culture, and history), I deviate from the more common understanding of Dominicanness. I am studying here elite and popular struggles to gain ground within the power structure in a particular time and space, and not quintessential traits that endure unspoiled in the ageless Dominican character or impositions from above that determined the shape of the future.∞∑ Other elements in my analysis deserve explanation. I refer to the architects of the national project variously as an ‘‘intellectual elite,’’ ‘‘political thinkers,’’ ‘‘letrados’’ or ‘‘men of letters,’’ ‘‘the intelligentsia,’’ and other labels that seem to correspond to the processes under scrutiny. In all cases, I want to evoke the image of a self-proclaimed intellectual leadership, legitimated almost entirely by their possession of knowledge, and intent on contributing to the task of nation-building through their written and oral interventions on current debates.∞∏ Likewise, I use the terms ‘‘subaltern,’’ ‘‘the underclasses,’’ ‘‘the urban working class,’’ ‘‘the popular classes,’’ the elite’s ‘‘inferiors,’’ and similar ones for those groups that were denied citizen status, in the sense that they were excluded from participation in political and social intercourse and also were considered incapable of contributing to the national project.∞π The state apparatus, the third player in the construction of a modern national image, appears variously in the guise of the municipal authorities, the town council, the police, or the republican guard; that is, any position from which flowed the o≈cial discourse of law and order. This book comes back time and again to situations in which these groups colluded with each other, coopted one or several of the other players, and interacted directly or in passing to forge what we could call a common sense of purpose. The binding notion of the future as the e√ort of today’s citizens did not originate in the early twentieth century nor with Trujillo’s henchmen. Neither was it the creation of more recent scholarship, which, in deploying a glorious representation of the national self, concealed the hand of a new generation of men and women of letters in it. Rather, I believe, it is a work permanently in progress, fashioned by various social forces at di√erent times in Dominican history and in the writing of that history. Whether it calls upon fictional memories or insists on a total makeover, imports alien ideas or works at the grass roots, imposes or negotiates, it is a process that is ongoing and susceptible to human action. In reconstructing this undertaking by elite and subaltern in turn-of-thecentury Santo Domingo, I thus embrace the task of the historian, as underxvi\n\nT\n\npreface\n\nstood by Gail Hershatter. She holds that ‘‘reaching for the past is an interactive process that constitutes even as it purports to retrieve.’’ Recovering subaltern subjectivity, I am aware, is a form of political work. So is critiquing liberal, bourgeois, and modern conceptualizations of knowledge and projects as well as elite representations of the subaltern, as I try to do here. I am hoping that my work, as Ileana Rodríguez proposes in the introduction to The Latin American Subaltern Studies Reader, will o√er ‘‘new ways of approaching some of the riddles created by the incapacity of bourgeois culture to think about its own conditions of discursive production.’’∞∫ i a m pr ou d t o ha v e completed this book with inspiration from myriad sources—paper, electronic, and human. I have been collecting information and processing it since 1996, when I first spent a semester’s leave in the Dominican Republic. At that time and in subsequent visits, I had the good fortune of getting to know, to a greater or lesser degree, people whose knowledge, friendship, and assistance I am grateful for.

During all of these years, people in the Twin Cities saw me through good and bad times. I found my colleagues at Macalester College supportive, and my neighbors and friends patient, and vice versa. Mahmoud El-Kati, Rhonda Gonzales, David Itzkowitz, Herta Pitman, Peter Rachle√, Emily and Norman Rosenberg, Paul Solon, Yue-Him Tam, and Peter Weisensel encouraged me in the Department of History.

David Sisk, Mike Nelson, and Mark Lewis were always there for me when my computer misbehaved. And I always felt supported by Provost Dan Hornbach, whose integrity and hard work I value highly. Several students carried out top-quality work for me as this book came together.

The economic growth that political stability had stimulated, beginning in 1879, especially evident in the nascent sugar industry, inspired many to imagine a brighter future for the island. Dominicans of all walks of life, who had no choice but to concede that the hated dictator Ulises Heureaux was partly responsible for the country’s modernization, knew from experience that there were alternatives to the repression and venality that characterized his rule. Lilís, as the president was popularly known, was assassinated in 1899, making way for a core of highly committed political thinkers to promote their agenda. Already they had mapped out the blueprint for the island’s progress and had professed their allegiance to modern agricultural techniques, secular education, and political participation as the cornerstones of the new nation. Espousing Liberal principles like their precursors in the last twenty years, these advocates of reform endeavored to develop the notion of hardworking, peaceful, voting citizens as the key to the future. Progress, as they envisioned it, was the concerted e√ort of a political and intellectual elite, with regulated input from common people.∞ Neither the transformation experienced nor the ideology of progress was exempt from conflict. Sugar had brought, along with economic prosperity, the dispossession of peasants in some areas, the importation of workers from the West Indies, foreign investment, and other changes about which even the proponents of modernization were uneasy. The chance to redefine the political framework of the state was also compromised by the growing role of the\n\nI\n\nUnited States in Caribbean internal a√airs and its overpowering influence in Dominican fiscal policy. As I will argue in this chapter and the next, the ideology of progress and its practical application, the development of a list of traits that collectively defined the national character, were colored by these circumstances. As a result, the Dominican intellectual elite was careful to subsume and render neutral the thorny issues of race, class, and gender in their inventory of attributes necessary to renovate the country.≤ men of letters The self-proclaimed intellectual leadership that emerged in the Dominican Republic at the turn of the last century tried to follow the steps Angel Rama masterfully described for Mexico and Argentina in his seminal work, The Lettered City. In these countries, as in most of Latin America, the enlightened notion that an intellectual elite was best suited to run the country took root at independence. Along with the wholesale adoption of the most current social, economic, and political doctrines, this idea required major transformations in the material and ideological outlook of the former Spanish American colonies. A more accessible educational system and the widespread circulation of the printed word, nineteenth-century reformers believed, would set the stage for the appearance of the ‘‘total’’ intellectual, whose legitimacy rested on his knowledge alone (and not on wealth or family connections). Indeed, as reading publics increased, so too did the possibility of political dialogue and consequently of supporting oneself from written work, independent of government sinecures. Auspiciously, newspapers proliferated in the cities, even as most of the population remained illiterate, and ‘‘the philosophical development of a political opposition’’ was apparently becoming a reality. By the end of the nineteenth century, according to Rama, the class of men who had earlier combined wealth, political clout, and a university education to influence the course of events relied solely on their claim to higher learning to opine, direct, criticize, and propose.≥ Regardless of whether this process was as seamless in the more developed countries of Latin America as Rama would have us believe, it was certainly a more conflicted a√air in the Dominican Republic. Despite the aspirations of the local intellectual elite, the Dominican experience fits better Julio Ramos’s ‘‘desencuentros’’ (run-ins) scheme for plotting the activities of intellectuals in Latin America. Ramos correctly characterizes the region as unevenly modernized, so that the divorce of intellectual activity from economic life or political happenings was di≈cult at best, chimerical in most cases. Intellectuals in the Dominican Republic were not ‘‘continuously in control of written 2\n\nT\n\nintroduction\n\nexpression,’’ to use Ramos’s words, despite their best e√orts. They continued to rely on government appointments and do so even today, not only because their livelihood was ‘‘precarious’’ but also because the state was, after all, the medium through which some of their ideas could become a reality.∂ This does not mean, however, that the island’s educated elite did not see itself as what Nicola Miller calls an ‘‘intelligentsia’’ and adopted as a mission the development of a common sense of nationhood. Like its counterparts in the American continent, the intellectual class of the Dominican Republic believed itself to be especially capable of providing the theoretical underpinnings for a new social and economic order and felt compelled to set the standards for political conduct. As did Liberal governments all over Latin America, Dominican administrations began to treat universal secular schooling as a priority in the development contest. The political use of language would no longer be the prerogative only of those who could a√ord to attend private schools or learn from tutors, but of all those who could read the paper and so engage in political discourse. A contemporary, José Ramón López, called this phenomenon ‘‘corporatist elitism’’ to highlight both the collective aspects of the ‘‘civilizing’’ activity and the superior standpoint that legitimated it. The creation of ‘‘languages-of-power,’’ which acquired status by association that was ultimately politicized, occurred in the Dominican Republic at the end of this period, just as other circumstances intimated the promise of change.∑ Dominican literati utilized several media to disseminate knowledge, debate issues, and also amuse themselves. Beginning in the 1880s, a normal school as well as public primary and secondary schools for boys and girls emphasized the value of scientific, secular education, from which cohorts of young men and women, notably Salomé Ureña de Henríquez and her students, benefited. The advantages of associating with like-minded individuals had been recognized since the founding of the first sugar mills, and cultural, charitable, mutual-aid, religious, commercial, and sporting societies existed in Santo Domingo, the capital, and San Pedro de Macorís, a booming sugar town, throughout this period. Literary clubs organized ‘‘cultural evenings’’ in which local or visiting artists presented their work for discussion.∏ The establishment of newspapers and the publication of magazines presumably directed at a general readership interested in politics, the economy, literature, and social events created additional avenues for the circulation of ideas of national import. At the turn of the century, a plethora of publications—Nuevo Réjimen, Renacimiento, El Eco de la Opinión, Mireya (in San Pedro de Macorís), alongside the old-timer El Listín Diario—circulated in the capital and the larger cities. The editors of these publications, men such as José Ricardo introduction\n\nT\n\n3\n\nRoques, Raúl Abreu, Manuel Flores Cabrera (a Venezuelan political exile), Francisco Gregorio Billini, and Rafael Justino Castillo, and one woman, Petronila Angélica Gómez, were prominent figures in social circles and, in some cases, in public a√airs as well. In many instances, the same men who wrote reasoned editorials on the suitability of alternative political and economic arrangements for the emerging state also published moving fiction and poetry whose literary value was insignificant.π As was the case in the United States and Western Europe, the Dominican journalistic establishment became the instrument of the educated and the civic-minded to express their ideas, to influence others, and to entertain.∫ The men who jump-started the conversation regarding the country’s potential and so engaged in an ambitious exercise in self-reflection belonged to a growing class of families, which can be dubbed ‘‘middle class,’’ insofar as the priority of the parents was their children’s schooling, whether they had the economic resources or made every sacrifice to achieve that goal. In either case, the young men (and a few women) who became the intellectual cream of the Dominican Republic obtained a privileged education, in some cases advanced or professional degrees, which both facilitated their entry into the old-time elite circles that combined wealth, politics, and status and legitimated their voices in such spheres of influence. Out of this cadre of new professionals rose men of letters who were not distinguished gentlemen who read for leisure, but who were committed instead to writing on behalf of the majority of the population, increasingly called ‘‘the masses.’’Ω Eugenio María de Hostos (1839–1903), the Puerto Rican sage who inspired an entire generation of Dominican thinkers in the 1880s and beyond, received a liberal education in San Juan and Bilbao and a law degree in Madrid. He studied and traveled in the United States, France, and Chile before settling in Santo Domingo in 1875. He advanced many progressive causes (the rights of workers, equal educational opportunities for women, the abolition of slavery) but dedicated his life to the dream of an Antillean confederation, free from Spain. To this end, he wrote extensively, spoke publicly, and founded schools, newspapers, and literary societies. Francisco Henríquez y Carvajal (1859–1935) came from a well-to-do family and studied medicine in Paris after working closely with Hostos in setting up primary schools for boys and girls. He was outspoken against the Heureaux dictatorship and so left the country, later returning to become president shortly before the U.S. invasion in 1916. His brother Federico (1848–1952), another Hostos ‘‘collaborator’’ (they refused to be called disciples), participated both in the literary scene and in political circles. Among the posts he held were director of the normal school, rector of the university, member of 4\n\nT\n\nintroduction\n\nCongress, and president of the Supreme Court. He was a good friend of José Martí, the Cuban nationalist, and was o√ered the presidency of the Dominican Republic during one of the impasses prior to the U.S. occupation. Francisco Moscoso Puello (1885–1959), a physician and educator, wrote a seminal novel about the working class in the sugar industry and serialized his ‘‘Cartas a Evelina’’ (Letters to Evelina), identifying in them for his presumably European bride-to-be the qualities and flaws of the Dominican Republic and its people. Emiliano Tejera (1841–1923) was instrumental in establishing the Instituto Profesional in 1866 but is better known for his role as minister of foreign a√airs during Ramón Cáceres’s tenure as president (1905–11), when the Dominican Republic permitted the United States to set up a receivership general to collect customs duties for the purposes of foreign debt repayment. Tejera wrote extensively about the formation of the Dominican character vis-à-vis the despised Haitians. Pedro Francisco Bonó (1828– 1906) hailed from a rural middle-class northern family and served as a local judge in his home jurisdiction. Whereas he embraced many of the tenets of Liberalism and got involved in national politics, he evokes more often notions of civic integrity and selfless patriotism, especially as the author of sociological tracts in defense of the Dominican small landholder and in opposition to reckless modernization. Américo Lugo (1870–1952) was trained as a lawyer and wrote from this perspective about the duties of government toward the people it represents, the illegitimacy of the U.S. intervention, and the capacity of Dominicans to govern themselves. Federico García Godoy (1857–1924) combined, as many of these men did, fiction writing with a current political agenda. He wrote historical novels as well as newspaper articles, both of which sought to bring to light contemporary issues that merited public discussion. José Ramón López (1866–1922) might be the only one in the group who did not have a university education, as he had to work as a child to put himself through primary and secondary school. He was outspoken in newspapers and journals against Heureaux and had to leave the country from 1885 to 1887. In the early twentieth century, he entered public service, holding the posts of principal of the normal school, director of statistics, and senator, during which time he published treatises on the problem of political violence and the condition of the peasantry. These three men—Lugo, García Godoy, and López—much more so than the others, stand out for their pessimism when dissecting the potential of the country and its people for overcoming the obstacles to progress. Given their class backgrounds and their social contacts, one would assume that the Dominican intelligentsia spoke for the interests of a modernizing bourgeoisie and promoted its cause before the state. This would have introduction\n\nT\n\n5\n\nbeen the case in industrialized European countries at the time and earlier too. But the Dominican Republic, along with what Antonio Gramsci called the peripheral states of Europe, could not count on an organized bourgeois class whose interests the intellectual elite could respond to, because no such class existed. Rather, as Gramsci described the situation, the modern state had come from above and depended on foreign capital supported by a strong military, a construction not unlike the Dominican reality. It had been only recently that the island’s economy had produced a sustained output, and this—in the form of an agricultural export, sugar—was controlled by foreigners. The national bourgeoisie-to-be, if it could have been tapped at all, resided in the northern tobacco lands, whose residents had supported the Liberal governments earlier in the century. But it had never coalesced so as to have a coherent program of reforms or agenda for action. Dominican intellectuals, then, had no social base from which to act, no civil society to mobilize or in whose stead to exist in ‘‘productive tension’’ with the state.∞≠ The Dominican intelligentsia’s relationship with the state is in other ways less than precise. Although the integrity of their labor depended on their autonomy from the state, they continued to depend on the government for ‘‘employment,’’ in the sense that it was their function to critique it, either from within or at the margins. Several of the writers listed above accepted positions within administrations, and they did so in a particularly tumultuous period during which, presumably, they should not have risked compromising their ideals. The decision to collaborate made perfect sense, if one considers the context. The Liberal interventionist state was, after all, the sine qua non of the modernist project—it was the responsibility of the apparatus of government to correct the imbalances that the invisible hand inevitably produced. Intuitively, maybe, Dominican intellectuals perceived the state as a political actor with whom they shared goals, and they promptly surmised that the inchoate bourgeoisie had little to o√er by way of ideas or economic support. They might have been correct in their assessment but ignored the dangers of becoming the co-opted supporters or ritual opponents of a strong state. Thus, the notion of an independent thinker, an impartial social critic by virtue of his isolation—Gramsci’s ‘‘traditional’’ intellectual—was a fiction. As if having no social base were not bad enough, Dominican intellectuals could easily become ‘‘the accomplices of the ruling group in the battle of hegemony.’’∞∞ men of social action Unknowingly assisting the state in manipulating the citizenry, colluding with it to legitimize their social status, out of touch with social groups they should 6\n\nT\n\nintroduction\n\nhave spoken for, promoting the interests of a narrow band of self-seeking entrepreneurs—however they operated or whatever they thought they were achieving, Dominican intellectuals were of one mind regarding the philosophical tenets of their labor: they were Liberals, rational men, positivists. The Liberal agenda in Latin America repeated itself, with some local variations, across the continent and throughout the nineteenth century. The earliest manifestations of this modernizing trend were free trade, limited democracy, and their corollaries—secular education, administrative rationalization, infrastructure investment, and the more elusive nationalism, civic responsibility, individual liberties, property rights, and the like.∞≤ The Dominican Republic had already experienced a version of the practical application of these ideals on its own soil, with the Azul (Blue) administrations of Gregorio Luperón (1879–80), Father Fernando A. Meriño (1880–82), Francisco Gregorio Billini and Alejandro Woss y Gil (1884–86), and Heureaux himself (1882–84, 1887–99).∞≥ Hostos was the figure around whom these principles and their proponents converged, a stalwart defender of the most radical social transformations Dominicans had yet to come across. During the presidency of Luperón and Horacio Vásquez’s stint in the executive (1899–1903, first as vice president and then as president), Hostos single-handedly laid the foundations for the public school system, advocating a positivist education, one free from the strictures of Catholicism and committed to scientific methods. With the motto ‘‘civilización o muerte’’ (civilization or death), he stressed the importance of hard work, that is, of economic pursuits grounded on scientific study—a connection he and his followers continued to make throughout this period. Like others at the time, Hostos was suspiciously watchful of developments in the nascent sugar industry; his preferred developmental strategy was diversified agriculture, in medium-sized private holdings, worked by immigrant families acquainted with modern cultivation methods, under government auspices, and with state financial support. To that end, he proposed a number of bills to Congress, which were heatedly debated in the press as well, a practice consistent with Hostos’s own conviction regarding the benefits of informed discussions.∞∂ As did Hostos, Bonó advanced from early on the notion that many and diverse newspapers would serve to promulgate opinions regarding current rulers, existing or potential government programs, and other issues of importance for the general public. He blamed bad government for the backwardness of the country and, pinning his hopes on the integrity of political processes, advocated respect for minority voices on the part of the powerful. Placing his trust in the peasantry, he was convinced that, once the rural introduction\n\nT\n\n7\n\npopulation was educated, they could rightly participate in the political life of the country. He believed that the heart of the citizenry lay in the countryside and worried that divesting peasants of their communal lands, a position slightly at odds with the sacred Liberal principle of private property, was nothing short of eradicating the basis of nationhood.∞∑ These men and others like them were almost fanatical advocates of education and employment as fundamental to the regeneration of society. They also exhibited the characteristic Liberal enthusiasm for the potential of humankind. One writer captured the general outlook of the moment in a sentence intended to challenge Dominicans to rise to the occasion: ‘‘[It] is unfortunately true, very true, that when societies abandon the noble exercise of their rights, substituting them with the enervating resignation of serfs, and with the clumsy negligence of savages, they lose the habit and the duty, of cultured and civilized societies, of looking after their great interests and of imposing their legitimate will on the uncurbed appetites of recklessness and blind ignorance.’’∞∏ Conceivably, Dominicans were not among this group and, using reverse logic, were intellectually prepared and eager to work together for a propitious future. the economic base Economically, there was also much to be hopeful for, due to the success of the sugar industry in generating wealth, both for the treasury and for the population as a whole. Production for export rose sharply from 1880 to 1916 (see Table 1), and investments in sugar reached $11 million (pesos, not dollars) as early as 1893. The first mills were established between 1879 and 1882, under the sponsorship of Liberal governments intent on taking advantage of the tumult caused in Cuba by the Ten Years’ War. From that time onward, the vagaries of the market and the island’s own paucity of resources resulted in unpredictable ups and downs, until the industry stabilized in the 1890s. The drop in prices in 1884 resulted in bankruptcy for several mills, but those that survived modernized and spread the risks by contracting with cane growers rather than taking on the cultivation and manufacturing aspects of production themselves. With the low wages that sugar mills o√ered (fifty centavos a day) in the early days and the availability of land at that time, there was not much incentive for Dominican peasants to abandon their land and work in the sugar fields. Their demands to be paid by the job, in fact, were countered with a vigorous program of importation of workers from the nearby Britishowned islands, beginning in the 1880s. By 1893, with wages between two and three pesos per tarea (a unit of land equivalent to .16 acre), Dominican 8\n\nT\n\nintroduction\n\ntable 1 Sugar Exports from the Dominican Republic (in tons), 1880–1916 1880 1890 1905 1913 1916\n\n7,000 24,352 48,169 86,892 144,911\n\nsource: Roberto Cassá, Historia social y económica de la República Dominicana, vol. 2 (Santo Domingo: Editora Alfa y Omega, 1992), 136.\n\npeasants went in and out of sugar production irregularly to obtain cash. British West Indian workers, known derisively as cocolos, made up the majority of the labor force, especially during the harvest. Technological advances, mainly to save on labor costs, characterized the industry, and foreign capitalists, mostly Americans, increasingly invested in the Dominican Republic. Other signs of progress—such as railroads, the telegraph, electric lighting, and the like—accompanied or closely followed sugar. Without a doubt, the cane industry altered the relationship between land, labor, and capital and set the stage for further economic growth.∞π These transformations, however, could not reverse overnight the downward trend that had marked Dominican fiscal policy both during the Heureaux presidency and in the turbulent years following it. In order to keep his modernization program afloat, Heureaux borrowed nationally, first from the northern tobacco producers and then from the southern sugar planters, and abroad from various European creditors, the most important of which was the Westendorp Company, based in Amsterdam. Unable to pay back old loans, he borrowed from new sources, until he was forced in 1893 to allow a number of American individuals and companies, associated as the San Domingo Improvement Company, to administer the European debt. As was the case with the Westendorp firm, ‘‘la Improvement,’’ as Dominicans referred to the company, had control over the customshouse and in addition monopolized steamship service from New York to Santo Domingo and had enormous investments in the sugar industry. Lilís, having encumbered the country’s finances beyond the point of recovery, tried to conceal the muddle by printing worthless paper money, which was rejected by the population. By 1897, the treasury was bankrupt, which did not prevent the president from ransacking its vaults for personal gain.∞∫ The men that followed Lilís in o≈ce inherited an untenable situation that introduction\n\nT\n\n9\n\ncould hardly have been turned around. A feeble attempt to dislodge the Improvement Company from customs collection, and so repay European creditors directly, met with forceful opposition not just from the company but more important, from the U.S. government, which sought sole control of access to the Panama Canal area and thus feared that European lenders would collect what was owed them by force of arms.∞Ω By 1904, the Dominican government agreed to buy from the Improvement Company its numerous properties in the country, including the Ferrocarril Central (Central Railroad), from Santiago to Puerto Plata, for $4.5 million and to submit to the advice of a U.S. financial agent, without whose approval the island’s treasury could not disburse any funds. In 1905, the direction of U.S. intervention became irreversible—the U.S. government took charge of all obligations of the Dominican Republic and collected customs duties, 45 percent of which would go to the Dominican treasury and 55 percent to pay creditors and customs personnel. The Dominican government could not alter its tari√ structure nor enter into obligations without approval from the president of the United States. Although this agreement was not o≈cially approved by the U.S. Senate nor satisfactory to the Dominican Republic or its creditors, it was honored until 1907, when the Dominico-American convention ratified its stipulations, basically making the Dominican Republic a U.S. protectorate. The only change to the fiscal status of the country as a receivership was that the debt was reduced to $17 million through negotiations with creditors and was paid by a U.S. bank, from which the Dominican Republic borrowed $20 million for debt repayment and public works. The recent fiscal and financial history of the Dominican treasury left much to be desired. The country had given up more and more of its autonomy, first to a number of foreign creditors and then solely to the U.S. government. Sugar, although bringing much-needed revenues and the promise of renewed economic activity, came with strings attached in terms of both labor and capital. Still, precisely because private and public U.S. funds revitalized the Dominican economy, the expectation throughout all these years remained that the country would stand up on its own again. political aspirations The assassination of the reviled Heureaux made possible a political aperture that the Dominican intellectual class had been endeavoring to bring about for decades. Lilís was a Liberal positivist with authoritarian tendencies, not unlike his Mexican counterpart, Porfirio Díaz. He opened the country to foreign investment, showered upon his supporters concessions and public 10\n\nT\n\nintroduction\n\nposts, and modernized agriculture. In the manner of the more ruthless strongmen that he epitomized, he also persecuted his enemies, traded the island’s sovereignty for momentary financial gains, and made use of public monies as if they were personal funds. Although his administration was responsible for the installation of the sugar industry on Dominican soil and for the development of a local commercial sector, his elevation of personalized local and regional strongman rule and his tenacious suppression of other viable power bases virtually eliminated the prospect of participatory politics. With his death, however, the Liga de Ciudadanos (Citizens’ League) was founded with the objective of ‘‘inciting patriotism, civilization, civic commitment, and representative democracy.’’ The more humane version of Liberalism, resolutely respectful of private property, committed to economic development, and intent on rationalizing political processes, would enter the political arena, as Lilís had promised upon his initial accession to power and the intelligentsia had clamored for ever since.≤≠ The period that immediately followed Heureaux’s assassination did not conform to these auspicious plans. Soon after his demise and after a brief period of political stability, Dominican politics erupted again into personalistic strife. Historians have characterized this period quite negatively. Valentina Peguero finds that the period’s most prominent feature was ‘‘the alternation of provisional and constitutional governments, that follow[ed] each other in the midst of brusque and sudden changes.’’ Ernesto Sagás believes the country ‘‘fell back into a vicious circle of caudillismo, political instability, and economic indebtedness.’’ Roberto Cassá, dismissing the possibility of bourgeois democracy, is even more pessimistic: ‘‘In truth, the alternatives were articulated [as] caudillista disorder or [Lilisista] tyranny.’’ By reintroducing the specter of caudillismo to the Dominican political continuum, these authors are emphasizing the apparent lack of ideological content of the two parties that vied for power from 1899 to 1916, with a brief respite during Ramón Cáceres’s tenure as president (1905–11). Conceivably, Horacio Vásquez, Juan Isidro Jimenes, Desiderio Arias, Alejandro Woss y Gil, Carlos Morales Languasco, and others acquired their following because of ‘‘their fame, the[ir] social rank, the[ir] regional origin, and their personal attributes.’’≤∞ Without denying the political uncertainty that seventeen rulers in as many years can and did produce, it seems unfair to suggest that these men had no political program to o√er the country and that their supporters were after nothing but the spoils of power. Undoubtedly, there was a lot of the latter— the wrangle over the administration of the Ferrocarril Central in 1913 is only one of a number of disputes over moneymaking enterprises or o≈ce-holding among opposing party associates.≤≤ And perhaps the factions were, in fact, introduction\n\nT\n\n11\n\nMap of the Dominican Republic, 1873.

But to reduce the practice of politics to popular appeal, or worse yet, to greed, says very little about the reasons why people took up arms and died to put their candidate in power. The continuous political discourse that men of letters engaged in during this period strongly indicates that ideology was the moving force behind many of the actions that together marked these years as chaotic and 12\n\nT\n\nintroduction\n\ndisorganized.

The writings of the intelligentsia duly recognized the tension caused by the coexistence of terrenos comuneros (communal lands) and a capitalistic sugar industry. Newspaper editors, political essayists, and educators clamored for responsible government, attentive to popular needs and open to more than hegemonic interests. In the social sphere, some of these men insisted that respect for the common folk and state-sponsored education were essential in the construction of a cohesive Dominican nation. Some of the proponents of progress advocated the immigration of white settlers in family units, whose function was both to populate and make productive the vast expanses that remained unoccupied and to strengthen through miscegenation the ‘‘raza criolla’’ (Creole race), a term that underscored the national at the expense of the racial—the European and African mix that characterizes Dominicans, much to their dismay.≤≥ Although there were differences of opinion regarding the country’s endowment and the appropriate strategy for development, turn-of-the-century intellectuals agreed that education, employment, democratic government, national sovereignty, freedom of the press, and private property held the promise of progress for the nationin-the-making. The task ahead, then, consisted of forming citizens where the very notions of social responsibility, economic justice, and political participation had been systematically suppressed. In this sense, the national project was both forward-looking and inclusive. Political thinkers refused to dwell on the past and issued ahead a plethora of prescriptions and proposed methods of application to propel the necessary changes. They were equally intent on producing a national community of interests based on a shared set of values to which everyone would subscribe—conceivably, the citizenry’s commitment to progress. In the race for a functional nationalism, for a working definition of citizenship that embraced the entire Dominican population and projected their needs and aspirations to a higher plane, strategically political objectives prevailed over historically divisive racial, ethnic, class, or gender factors—at least for the intelligentsia.≤∂ Rodolfo Domingo Cambiaso reinforced this shift in direction in his brief pamphlet on history writing, Bosquejo sobre la historia (1913). In it, he appeals to young people, the current keepers of the materials that their descendants will use to write the history of the country. The responsibility of ‘‘the present generation,’’ he asserts, is to safeguard the historical record so that the next cohort, ‘‘already educated, conscious, impartial, will be able to relate to posterity really how the Dominican Republic was formed [se hizo], how great introduction\n\nT\n\n15\n\n[were] the struggles [qué de luchas], the injustices, and the vicissitudes that had to be endured so that it could become a Nation’’ (emphasis mine). In a modern concatenation of progress, fatherland, history, national heroes, and common people, he beseeched his readership: Engrave [the following words] in your memory, so that you will constantly have [them] in the eyes of the soul: ‘‘That all peoples undergo vicissitudes, some more than others, and that even at the edge of the abyss, apostles rise who teach a redemptive doctrine than cannot fade even though the preacher is crucified. The march of progress, therefore, is inevitable, a fact that no one can ever disrupt. The important [thing] is to know how to appreciate those who want to lift the Fatherland. . . . Because of that, now, full of faith and hope in the future, I conclude thinking: ‘That a small group of young people, well intentioned and conscious, proposed to reform the country, and to them [we] owe the redemption of the People, who were capable of establishing the dignity of the Fatherland’ ’’ [i a ellos se le debe la redención del Pueblo, que supo establecer la grandeza de la Patria]. Nothing short of an ‘‘invented tradition,’’ the history Cambiaso proposed would be written by men of letters, who would work with the historical symbols purposefully gathered for their use by their equally educated and politically committed predecessors, themselves the proponents of national progress and the servants of the fatherland.≤∑ The discourse of progress collected the binding tenets of European Liberalism and tried to apply them to the Dominican context. Finding the state of a√airs on the island wanting, the intelligentsia hurried to prescribe formulas to facilitate the process of modernization, part and parcel of which were the activation of the citizenry and the rehabilitation of the economy. To rebuild the country, Dominican men of letters realized, the hardworking, peaceful, and committed citizens who would be its building blocks had yet to be formed. The architects of the national project, then, included in their plans the controlled inclusion of groups that had only recently been recognized as part of the polity and suspended judgment regarding their full incorporation into Dominican society. At no point did Dominican intellectuals, even those who were wary of modernization, consider rethinking existing social hierarchies, nor did they draw inspiration from the Dominican Republic’s turbulent past. The intelligentsia deployed their schemes for progress with the assurance that education confers and constructed citizenship with the authority that political savvy facilitates.≤∏\n\n16\n\nT\n\nintroduction\n\nthe formation of the nation The architects of the ideology of progress, in their e√orts to mold the country’s first modern citizens, then, embarked on a more ambitious journey— the formation of the nation. Writings on Dominican nationalism have generally strung together a number of words and phrases and have used some interchangeably to describe aspects of the same process—the conception of national identity, the development of nationhood, the birth of the nation, the growth of patriotic sentiments, the ascendancy of a distinct cultural and ethnic community, a Dominican consciousness, racial solidarity, the national soul, Dominicanness, shared values, ‘‘lo nacional ’’ (that which is national), linguistic ties, national unification, and so on. The reason for this semantic diversity is the emphasis that historians and sociologists (and also psychologists and anthropologists) have placed on lived experience (economic or political events that motivated people to coalesce); on the coincidence of place, language, culture, ethnicity, or race that some believe bind people together; or on the capacity of the state to manipulate either collective memory or future prospects so that a social group builds its desire to cooperate around a common past or around an unfolding destiny. Scholars, then, notwithstanding the influence that they reputedly can exert on our understanding of the factors and circumstances that link people politically, disagree widely with respect to the correct weight given each. Dominican historians from the late nineteenth century onward have dedicated much e√ort to determining when and how a sense of nationalism developed. Manuel Arturo Peña Batlle and Pedro Troncoso Sánchez placed the moment as far back as the ‘‘devastaciones’’ of 1605, when the inhabitants of the northern part of the island rebelled against metropolitan instructions to evacuate the area to reduce contraband with the French. Hugo Tolentino Dipp, basing himself like Juan Pablo Duarte, the ‘‘father of the republic,’’ on the factors that held common people together—language, territory, economy, and psychology—conferred nationhood on Dominicans at the time of their independence from Haiti (1844). The same was true for Carlos Dobal, who added, only to dismiss, the element of race; according to him, ‘‘black Spaniards’’ (Dominicans) fought against the French first, then against the Haitians, and out of these battles emerged the Dominican nation, which, bound by virtue, transcended color. As might be expected, Pedro Francisco Bonó was wedded to the juridical apparatus and dated the nation to the creation of the constitutional state. Pedro Henríquez Ureña emphasized a longer intellectual process that occurred throughout the nineteenth century\n\nintroduction\n\nT\n\n17\n\namong literate groups and the bourgeoisie, who professed the island’s sovereignty as they fought for independence from Haiti and rejected foreign rule and its proponents. Roberto Cassá and Genaro Rodríguez examined a variety of elements from the sixteenth century onward to conclude that ‘‘in the nineteenth century, the emergence of the nation was conditioned by the leading role of the people in the struggle for self-determination.’’ Frank Moya Pons placed the realization on the part of Dominicans that they were a nation in 1865, after the war to restore the republic to island statesmen, when Dominicans finally recognized, to paraphrase Moya Pons, that they were not Spanish, or French, or Haitian. Américo Lugo, one of the masterminds of the national project himself, negated the capacity of Dominicans to form a nation up until the early twentieth century but reversed himself promptly when the United States invaded in 1916. The list of scholars and their positions is extensive.≤π The modern debate on the timing and the factors of Dominicanness, although seemingly an innocent intellectual pastime, was from the outset, as mentioned in the preface, a pointed political response to the discourse on nationhood deployed by the ideologues of the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas Trujillo. Claiming itself responsible for restoring the material and cultural well-being of the country after the U.S. occupation, the Trujillo regime produced a version of Dominicanness that set the eastern part of the island apart from its neighbor. Joaquín Balaguer and Manuel Arturo Peña Batlle, Trujillo’s deputies, gave the authoritarian state coherence by weaving an elaborate ‘‘o≈cial nationalist’’ tale of the development of nationalism, based on the cultural di√erences between Haitians and Dominicans. Vis-à-vis the historically fierce enemy and the more recent pathetic exploited worker, and for the benefit of their former imperial master, Dominicans declared themselves white (not black), Hispanic (not African), and Catholic (not Vodou practitioners). It was important for Trujillo to deploy a nationalist discourse that exalted Dominicans at the expense of Haitians. Claiming cultural (read ‘‘racial’’) superiority over his neighbors to the west facilitated his manipulation of Haitians as a cheap labor force; it also allowed him to more closely approximate Western notions of political order, economic organization, and social balance. Although many accepted, even embraced, this construction and still do today, others, respected scholars for the most part, have sought to qualify it, if not to debunk it.≤∫ It is not my intention to directly engage Dominican scholars and statesmen on the details of the source of a sense of nationhood. Rather, I seek to understand how the intellectual and political elite in the early twentieth century constructed the nation, which they approached, I believe, in typical 18\n\nT\n\nintroduction\n\nLiberal fashion, as ‘‘a broad vision for organizing society, a project for collective identity based on the premise of citizenship—available to all, with individual membership beginning from the assumption of legal equality.’’≤Ω The mechanism they used to create a sense of belonging, I maintain, was not a shared past, but rather a common destiny. The Dominican past, in fact, might not have been ‘‘usable,’’ as Louis Pérez points out for the Cuban case, in the sense that it could hardly inspire people to come together with a collective sense of purpose.≥≠ If anything, recalling the island’s history would only prove advantageous if it served to change the people’s ‘‘anachronistic way of being in the century of constant evolution and limitless progress,’’ the twentieth century.≥∞ Political writers, as pointed out, chose not to revisit the past but rather to dwell on the advantages of a change in outlook. Shortly after Heureaux’s assassination, for example, good citizens were judged by their active stance in favor of the fatherland. ‘‘Those who are interested in the future of the fatherland must work out of their space. The ones who write, the ones who work in factories, the ones who till the soil, must work, [and] not allow [themselves to be influenced] by those who want to lead them away from their labors. And when the moment comes to defend the fatherland from foreigners, then they must give their lives. But in the meantime, there’s work to do.’’≥≤ A more comprehensive list of citizen duties (including honoring the ‘‘usable’’ past) constituted the formula for nationalism as Dominicans in 1913 celebrated the Restoration: [S]etting in the befitting place of honor the great men who dismantled the yoke of colonialism; taking a dignified and discerning attitude as an independent state; not thrashing with [our] feet what we make with [our] hands and have conceived in the heart; worshipping reverently our historical artifacts as a memory of our past and stimulating the development of our private and public wealth, without alien [notions] of any kind, wanting to fit in our milieus what is not ours nor [is] appropriate, we will create a nationalism or we will recover it, because if at any time we had it [we have to] confess, with our contrite soul, that we have been gradually losing it, and the expansionist tentacles of the Northern octopus, acting as protector of its younger sisters, will end up sucking, if we do not thwart him in time, the last drop of blood of our dignity and our honor.≥≥ Anti-imperialism, disguised as love of the fatherland above all else or brazenly forged out of anti-American sentiment, was a powerful force in defining the future of the country, as is evident from the statement above. Beginning with suspicions that the San Domingo Improvement Company introduction\n\nT\n\n19\n\nwas acquiring the foreign debt that the Dominican Republic owed a number of European creditors, Dominicans pointed to the ‘‘unsaintly intention of North Americans,’’ about whom one writer commented, ‘‘once they clench [their fist], they don’t let go.’’ U.S. actions in Puerto Rico, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Panama alarmed some, but not others. As late as 1907, when the Dominico-American convention was signed, turning over customs collections and the management of debt service to the United States, Emiliano Tejera, minister of foreign relations, asserted that critics of the convention were wrong in thinking that the Dominican Republic was losing autonomy. Just the opposite, he argued; the island was protecting itself from continued indebtedness to other countries. Still, the weighty presence of the ‘‘American colossus’’ must have clued in Dominican intellectuals to the importance of ‘‘perform[ing] their capacity for civilization,’’ to use Ada Ferrer’s apt phrase for Cuba’s parallel process of achieving status as a nation. As was true for many countries occupied by the United States in the early years of the twentieth century, the Dominican Republic had to prove itself worthy of joining the ranks of civilized and modern nations without U.S. assistance—or become vulnerable to intervention. As occurred in Cuba, it must not have been lost on the ruling and enlightened classes that American intervention depended on whether or not they conformed to the formula for progress, which was, after all, shared with the United States.≥∂ the national character Dominican men of letters and men of state, then, were of one mind when it came to identifying the characteristics that the country needed to develop if it were to modernize. These ‘‘domestic virtues,’’ as Miriam Fernández Sosa calls them, grew out of a local blueprint for progress that associated civilization, education, culture, and moral worth.≥∑ Not surprisingly, given material circumstances and the espousal of Liberal principles, these men ultimately grounded economic and social advances in the rational cultivation of food crops and some export products by Dominican males—either the owners of small tracts of land or the industrious peasants already partially dispossessed by commercial agriculture. The intellectual and political class who imagined the island’s future did not include urban residents—merchants and workers alike—among the Dominicans who produced for the country. References to women were aesthetic (they were like flowers; they cultivated beautiful gardens) or reproductive (land, like women, was fertile; the motherland, a woman, sought the welfare of her progeny).≥∏ Sugar workers from nearby islands, and especially from 20\n\nT\n\nintroduction\n\nHaiti, were suspect insofar as it was believed they introduced diseases, consorted with Dominicans (especially women), and took their wages home after the harvest. Journalists and essayists, then, either embraced immigrants, women, and urban wage workers as contributors to the process of national development in predetermined roles or suspected their ability to participate in building a common sense of purpose. Interestingly, although the composite ideal Dominican was based in the countryside, there was no rural archetype, as existed in Cuba (the guajiro) or Puerto Rico (the jíbaro), that represented the nation, but rather a set of characteristics that conceivably qualified the common person as fit to contribute to the national project. The most important of these probably was, and still is, color. Dominicans, as other Hispanic-descent peoples of Latin America, had internalized the value of whiteness and had even cultivated it vis-à-vis their neighbor, Haiti. To accentuate this tendency, scientific racism had introduced the notion that progress and modernity depended on the appropriate racial mix.≥π Given these circumstances, it was incumbent upon the intelligentsia to claim nationhood on the basis of racial unity by subsuming blackness into the discourse and by erasing it through white immigration. Regardless of the actual racial composition of the population, the ideal Dominican was imagined to be of indeterminate race (the identifier was never mentioned), but undoubtedly conceived as more white than black, as befit the heir to the country’s future. Ironically, the more common racial mix in the Dominican Republic became popularly known as ‘‘indio,’’ not because of any attachment to or admiration for the indigenous past, but rather strictly as a way of minimizing the black contribution to the national configuration. The second important attribute of Dominicanness in this period, as it has remained, was its a≈nity with Europe and, logically, with Spain, the former colonial master. Although Hostos denigrated Spain’s actions as a colonial power, most writers in this period saw the need to connect to familiar attitudes and friendly nations. On Spain’s four-hundredth anniversary in the Antilles, one author proposed putting behind ‘‘four hundred years of civilized life and, with short interruptions, four hundred years of cruel and heartless su√ering.’’≥∫ The disagreement with Spain regarding the location of Columbus’s remains (Havana or Santo Domingo) is another example of the desire to establish a spiritual connection with the cultural matriarch of the region and the source, after all, of many recent immigrants. In a critique of Alma dominicana, a novel by Federico García Godoy, in which the protagonist, a young and uneducated peasant, takes up arms against Spain and dies fighting for the independence of the Dominican Republic, the reviewer introduction\n\nT\n\n21\n\nmade clear that the author’s intention was not to discredit Spaniards, because, he asserted, the ties between the two nations became only tighter with time. Renacimiento lauded the creation of a Centro Español in San Pedro de Macorís as contributing to the development of a national culture—intellectual and business rapprochement with the mother country was an admirable goal. This desire for figurative proximity to its European roots could be explained by the increasing need to set the Dominican Republic o√ from the orbit of influence of the United States through language or culture, as Puerto Rico was trying to do, or to align with the ‘‘Latin American race threatened by North American expansionism’’ on the basis of ‘‘the harmony in customs, the form of government, . . . the unity of religion, [and] practices and vices that necessarily tend to unify [the region] under the same ideal.’’≥Ω The third set of desired traits in the new citizens could be labeled ‘‘love of country.’’ For the fatherland, men died, worked hard, loved their children, were moral in their transactions, acted rationally for the welfare of their communities, and more. In one short story, the seed of liberty, although having fallen in loving soil, cannot germinate until the blood of a soldier, who had been fighting for the ideals of freedom and the law, flows into the seedbed.∂≠ Dominicans had also to work hard, which they did in the fields, whether as peasants or hired hands. Schools would provide the opportunity for the general populace to become educated, and as such, more productive. With all this in place, only the right conditions had to exist in order for the exercise in citizenship and nationalism to begin. Two significant conundrums flow out of this discussion. One is the realization that the national attributes are, in fact, a wish list that veils some very objective uncertainties. The other is the economy by which subalterns were to insert themselves practically into these ideological constructs.∂∞ With respect to the first, it is impossible to learn with any assurance how contemporaries reconciled the traits that defined the national character, whose source seems to be the ageless countryside, and the milieu in which these qualities would be developed, the modern city. Without a doubt, stringing together transparent honesty, love of work, intelligence, capacity to produce, political acumen, moral integrity, and the like was an e√ort to identify qualities essential to Dominicanness that responded to the anxieties of government authorities and the bourgeoisie, with whom the intelligentsia socialized, regarding a number of circumstances that marred the Dominican future. Rural areas were, after all, the recruiting ground for insurrections against the government, and writers identified the practice of indiscriminate conscription on the part of caudillos and of military service with the expectation of\n\n22\n\nT\n\nintroduction\n\nobtaining government posts as evidence of the backward state of political development. Still, it was a commonplace to find romantic references to rural practices or peasant ways when the subject was the generic ‘‘el dominicano’’ (the Dominican man, person, people), although the realities of the countryside were the thorn in the side of progressive thinkers. Certain historians have identified the dichotomy between the country and the city denounced by some contemporary writers as the running thread of Dominican twentieth-century history.∂≤ I have chosen, instead, to point out the contradiction between the elite’s low opinion of the political performance of peasants and its projection of a lofty future for the country based on their capacity for work as representative of the nation. In addition, it is pertinent to highlight the sublimation of these perceived di√erences, which is another way of looking at contemporary writings on the construction of nationality, in the context of the labor unrest that marked the sugar-producing areas in this period. In Costa Rica, racial-national solidarity was used to dilute class cohesion—black West Indian workers were made the outsiders against ladino Costa Rican managers and workers. In Puerto Rico, a similar phenomenon occurred, and the jíbaro, an innocuous white peasant figure, was created to assuage the fears of the national sugar aristocracy. In Guatemala, the national archetype became an urban artisan, to compensate for proletarianization in co√ee plantations. A similar case could be drawn for the Dominican Republic, whose sugar-producing areas since the early days had experienced worker agitation, presented then and still understood as anti-immigrant sentiment. Although no idiosyncratic figure arose that encapsulated all the national virtues or represented any one of them, it is certainly the case that the dedication to work and the love of land that the intellectual elite focused on as a national asset assuaged any fears of the restless rural laborer.∂≥ Likewise, the racelessness that was characteristic of the Dominican ideal type, if one can use a shortcut for the list of national traits, pointed to insecurities regarding the racial makeup of the country. Knowing full well that the legacy of Africa flowed in their blood, Dominicans declared themselves superior, by virtue of their color, to the West Indian and Haitian immigrants who crossed their borders. Undoubtedly aware of the reasoning behind the eugenics movement as it had traveled to Latin America, the Dominican intelligentsia followed the imperative of developing a national identity that resembled that of European nations. Unable to claim whiteness, they settled for directing attention to the racial mix that marked the population and playing down issues of race in political discourse. Their faith in the\n\nintroduction\n\nT\n\n23\n\nredeeming value of education served to multiply in their minds the chances for the hybrid population to regenerate and make good on their economic potential, despite their heterogeneous origins.∂∂ Two other traits—the implicit maleness of the national character, and its propensity for Western ways—were also a function of the uneasy circumstances in which the country found itself vis-à-vis the overwhelming presence of the United States in the area. As I will elaborate in chapter 4, nationalist writers have commonly portrayed foreign penetration qua violation of territory in sexual terms. To properly protect the virtue of the homeland, then, virility was of the utmost importance. Identification with the Spanish mother country can be easily explained, at least on the cultural plane, by the threat that the United States posed in the region. Although the North American neighbor was much admired for its economic system and its political stability, Dominicans knew it was perfectly within its power and will to impose by force its notions of economic well-being and political security in the area. As a result, identification with civilized Spain, and disassociation from savage Haiti, were in order. The second quandary is easier to navigate. Regardless of how deliberately the Dominican intelligentsia set out to impose their will, the people to whom they directed their e√orts had their own ideas about how they would insert themselves into the national story. By ‘‘buying into’’ the discourse of nationalism, internalizing it, appropriating its language for their own purposes, or injecting their own values and thus transforming it, they molded it to their specifications.∂∑ Because notions of political activism without citizens, or without people who think of themselves as such, are absurd, this book will revisit the roles of the intelligentsia, the state, and the people of early twentieth-century Santo Domingo and San Pedro de Macorís in conceptualizing the nation and writing its history.\n\n24\n\nT\n\nintroduction\n\nchapter one The National Project\n\n4 he resolute desire to ‘‘modernize’’ captured the minds and hearts of Dominican intellectuals at the turn of the century much as it did all of Latin America. In tandem with developments on the continent, the Dominican discourse of progress portrayed the country’s social, economic, and political trajectory in negative terms and yet hypothesized a favorable aftermath. Its grounding in the universal doctrines of European Liberalism provided for the ideology of progress a sense of common purpose that would be forged out of the joint will of government and civil society. The national project, though, was fraught with contradictions, which historians can easily identify with hindsight. At the time, however, the thrust to modernize was powerful enough to reconcile the disparities in goals and methods that only a few contemporaries could point to.\n\nT\n\npessimism and the national character Contrary to the impression given in the last chapter through the enthusiastic listing of the qualities innate to Dominicans, island intellectuals had serious misgivings about the country’s social capital. ‘‘Dominicans’’ (those fictional archetypes of the ‘‘national character’’), the intelligentsia proclaimed, were given to gambling, women, and alcohol. They were careless with their finances and generally spent more than they earned. Ranchers neglected their cattle, as did parents their children. The population in general displayed an atavistic propensity to abandon the tasks that were most significant to their well-being and remained apathetic to the political life of the country. It was ‘‘not easy to remove the farmer from his work to take him to the book, nor to convert the idler into a hardworking man by way of an education that he will\n\nnot seek nor apply’’—it was impracticable, in fact, and the only solution the minister of justice and public education could think of was training young people in agricultural tasks as part of the school curriculum. In the words of Américo Lugo, the most biting critic of the national character: Let’s not harbor any illusions about the moral worth of the Dominican people. Moral worth reaches always the limit of intellectual capacity, and our intellectual capacity is almost nil. An immense majority of citizens who do not know how to read nor write, for whom there are no real needs, but impulses and passions; barbarians, in short, who do not recognize any law other than instinct; any right other than force; any home other than a hovel; any family other than females [to party with; más familia que la hembra del fandango]; any schools other than the cockpit; a minority, a fleeting minority; who knows how to read and write, and [who knows] about duties and rights, among which stand out, it is true, figures that are worth [all the riches in the] world, such is the Dominican people, semisavage on the one hand, enlightened on the other, in general apathetic, bellicose, cruel, and uninterested.∞ These negative images of the country and its people, rightfully dubbed ‘‘pessimism’’ by twentieth-century scholars, alarmed the elite for two reasons. On the one hand, there was the fear that, just as the country was taking o√, the impression of Dominicans abroad was precisely that of a backward people, whose political stability and economic promise were chimerical. This concern pervaded o≈cial and public discourse on the island’s capacity for modernization in the last decades of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth, when the state sought capital investment from abroad as well as immigrants to both work the land and establish agricultural enterprises. The second reason for anxiety was the related and very real fear that Dominicans, or the Dominican Republic, was really not a properly constituted country and so was an illegitimate actor on the world stage. Lugo put it as bluntly as only he was capable of: Out of history’s careful lessons, we can deduce that the Dominican people are not constituted as a nation. It is certainly a spiritual community united by language, customs, and other ties; but its lack of culture does not allow it the political development necessary for a people to become a nation . . . The Dominican State reflects what it can, the fluctuating will of the popular masses; in no way a public will, which does not exist here. The Dominican people are not a nation because they have no consciousness of the community that they con26\n\nT\n\nthe national project\n\nstitute, because their political activity is not su≈ciently far-reaching. Not being a nation, the State that aspires to represent it is not a real State.≤ If Dominican intellectuals worried about the impression they gave abroad, high government o≈cials had every reason to suspect the underhanded compliments foreign travelers paid the country and its people. Otto Schoenrich, U.S. special commissioner in charge of assessing the Dominican Republic’s financial solvency in 1905, described Dominicans as robust and vigorous, but somewhat lazy, because the climate, nature, and the political situation encouraged them to postpone tasks. Culturally, he considered them Spanish, although, he remarked, the racial mix had produced a very dark population. He observed that patriotism and liberty were the two ideals in whose names Dominicans committed the most noble and the most perverse acts. Schoenrich believed that the men were womanizers and gamblers, while the women were virtuous, and he placed the out-of-wedlock birthrate at 60 percent. Ten years later, an analyst of the island’s tourism potential portrayed Dominicans as ‘‘simple and good-natured people’’—moderate in their drinking habits, honest, intelligent, hardworking, and happy. He predicted a bright future for the country, once its inhabitants laid down their arms and picked up instead agricultural tools. Later in the period, a Protestant evangelist depicted Dominicans as hospitable, pleasant, cosmopolitan (in their attitudes to race and nationality), hardworking, and fun-loving. He believed they would have achieved more had nature not been so prodigal. Compared to Haiti, which remained under U.S. scrutiny at all times during this period, the Dominican Republic shone for its hard work and organization, ‘‘a state of a√airs certainly unexpected in a republic governed by a black man [Heureaux].’’ At the end of this period, foreigners’ opinions of Dominicans were more or less the same as at the beginning—helpful, respectful, obliging, ‘‘a simple group, instinctive and innocuous, that preferred to live with indi√erence forgetting the duties and responsibilities of life.’’ These foreigners’ assessments of the general population were indeed condescending, but more dangerously, they implicitly measured Dominican achievement against American standards, already very familiar to the political and social elites, and pitted the eastern part of the island against its poorer neighbor to the west as the potential recipient of American favor.≥ Other writers found qualities in the Dominican people that they praised wildly, but they remained equivocal or qualified their statements to the point of retracting them. José Ramón López, whose claim to fame remains his doomsday forecast of the country’s inadequacies due to poor nutrition, de-\n\nthe national project\n\nT\n\n27\n\nclared that native peasants worked twice as hard as foreign laborers, despite being malnourished. Similarly, a newspaper columnist proclaimed Dominican ‘‘moral, political, and social superiority over the sectarians of Vodou [Haitians], and . . . equally superior standing, compared to them, . . . among civilized nations.’’ Pedro Francisco Bonó himself considered Dominicans, as individuals, to be ‘‘brave, bold, . . . generous, hospitable, simple, hardworking, intelligent, enterprising.’’ But collectively—he qualified his statement— ‘‘Dominican society does not have the cohesion that is indispensable for a human aggregate that seeks to be definitively independent, [to be the] absolute master of its destinies.’’ Dominicans, then, demonstrated satisfactory progress only as hard (and not necessarily good) workers, when compared to Haitians (the Dominican Republic’s most despicable enemy), and as individuals whose accomplishments were personal.∂ Various theories circulated that explained, but never justified, the negative traits Dominican intellectuals and foreign visitors identified in the general population. The first blamed an unfortunate racial mix between low-class Spaniards and savage Africans for the tragic result: a disparate collection of individuals, of mixed race, incapable of self-regulation, highly susceptible to influence from above, and hardly worth the appellative ‘‘nation.’’∑ Another explanation, frequently overlapping with the first, pointed to three hundred years of colonialism as the cause of the Dominican population’s deficiencies. The legacy of colonial rule—total domination by the imperial power and its representatives, pervasive economic dependence, and generalized use of force—continued to a∆ict the country. Even López, more given to natural explanations than social ones, agreed with this interpretation: ‘‘The monopoly of a few is a solvent for social ideas. The privilege of the few, based on abusive practices, destroys society.’’∏ Other thinkers presented a third theory for the insu≈ciencies of the Dominican people—a gentle climate, a fertile soil, poor nutrition, scarce resources, and inadequate education were responsible for the political limitations of individual citizens. López was convinced that hunger, and the mental and physical inertia it caused, directly a√ected national wealth, and in combination with civil unrest, diminished population and morality. This occurred not only in the countryside, to which most of his pamphlet appears dedicated, but in the cities as well, where degeneration was mostly psychological. An influential analyst listed as problematic several facts: there was no information about the geography and geology of the island, its people, and natural resources; the roads and ports were in poor condition; and there was a high rate of illiteracy. A short story recounted the tragic destiny of Reducindo Nicolás, who was born, not coincidentally the same year as the re28\n\nT\n\nthe national project\n\npublic, in 1844. He became an orphan at two and was able nevertheless to grow up strong. His field was the best in the area, much to the chagrin of his neighbors, who were ‘‘lazy, loafers, most of them eaten up by black envy’’ (clearly, Haitians). Boredom, ‘‘or perhaps destiny,’’ led him to war, and the hands that could have been tilling fields now carried a rifle. The ease with which Dominican existence almost constructed itself without any human e√ort was to blame for what intellectuals identified as the population’s political and economic deficiencies, for their propensity for war and aversion to work. The end result of genetic material, circumstance, and fate, however imagined, left much to be desired.π Although it may be transparent to us that these explanations, especially the attempt to treat acquired characteristics as inherited traits, were terribly flawed, writers at the time mixed and matched elements of each in order to give meaning to their reality. López blamed race and the environment for the Dominican people’s violent nature, carelessness, indolence, and distrust of others—despite finding workers generally ‘‘cheerful, hardworking, serious, and resistant.’’ Another example of the tendency to attribute negative traits to nature, nurture, and fortune is Francisco Henríquez y Carvajal’s zealous outburst at the turn of the portentous century: Do you expect a people that has lived in an atmosphere of public immorality and injustice, that is tainted with vices, with fundamental errors, that knows no other governmental practices than those which have been able to persist in this land, those [pertaining to] tyranny; that is always agitated by subversive ideas against the instituted governmental order, whether good or bad, it matters little; do you expect such a people, that lacks absolutely any practical tradition or education, turns overnight, rising from the night of horrors, wrecked, ragged, hungry, with wan and haggard visage, to the delicious morning of an unexpected awakening, to become, we repeat, an adult people, robust and healthy, full of moral vigor, with just ideas, with noble purposes, with political and social habits that permit it to produce in this new kind of life the same accomplishments as those countries, who like Switzerland, England, and the United States of America, not only needed centuries to get there, but also counted on ethnic elements evidently superior because of a preparation and a slow and natural adaptation to the geographic and international milieu?∫ Interestingly, racial inferiority, abuse by the colonizer, and lack of resources made the process of decline of the Dominican people understandable but did not excuse them from inaction. the national project\n\nT\n\n29\n\nThe Liberal intelligentsia was obviously in a bind. The entire edifice of the country’s prosperity lay in the capacity of its people to coalesce around a common sense of purpose. The ‘‘people,’’ however, seemed to have no inclination to rise to the occasion. This was dangerous, not only because states were judged by the quality of their institutions, which would be upheld, after all, by civil society, but also because the Dominican Republic had a history of seeing these insu≈ciencies jeopardize its sovereignty. The memory of the Haitian occupation, glorious as its denouement was, and subsequent attempts to obtain the protection of European powers against Haiti weighed down on the Dominican psyche. That other countries discounted the Dominican Republic as a contender in the economic race was merely a source of embarrassment; more serious for Liberals might have been compromising another of their cherished ideals: the participation of the majority in the political life of the country. economic obstacles to progress Another source of worry for the Dominican intelligentsia lay in the economic sphere. Here the spokesmen for progress also found the country lacking, as agricultural pursuits had not replaced cattle raising, the scientific method did not yet prevail over traditional farming practices, and private property had not asserted itself as the dominant form of landholding. Given that the cane industry had held the promise of modernizing the country’s economy in the early 1880s—through wage work, the use of technology, capital investment, and the like—most concerns about the island’s future revolved around sugar and were expressed in reference to it, although the more generic term ‘‘agriculture’’ was used instead.
