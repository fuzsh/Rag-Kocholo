        "text": "Originally Posted by AntonioR\n\nThe three countries are under different political/economic set ups, but historically there has been much interchange between the three islands plus Venezuela.\n\nDominicans were a huge influence in Cuba's war of independence, in fact one of Cuba's greatest national hero is Maximo Gomez, a Dominican. Dominicans also played a huge role in Puerto Rico's independence movement during the late 1800's, at least until the US influence arrived.\n\nCuba's traditional upper class (old money) are almost all of Dominican descent. A similar situation exist with Puerto Rico's traditional upper class but to a lesser extent, and also with Venezuela's traditional upper class, especially with the old families from Caracas, many of whom are cousins of many DR's, PR's, and Cuba's traditional upper class families.\n\nYou will also find many celebrated intellectuals and other types of people that distinguished themselves in one way or another from all three islands present in all three islands. For example, Narciso Foxa is often celebrated by Puerto Ricans as one of the greatest poets that island has produced and that distinguished himself on a continent-wide basis, but he was born to Dominican parents. The first historian of Cuba was born in Santiago, Dominican Republic. Eugenio Maria de Hostos had a major influence on Dominican public education, but he was born in Puerto Rico. Baldorioty, who was a major critic against slavery in Puerto Rico, was born to Dominican parents. The Cantor of Niagara by the last name of Heredia considered to be the first dramatist in America was a Cuban of Dominican parents.\n\nI wouldn't say that today there is a Spanish Caribbean solidarity, but among the intellectuals and well read people of all three islands, they are aware of the historical and cultural connection between the three islands. The further down the economic ladder you go, the greater the ignorance about this.\n\nOriginally Posted by AntonioR\n\nThe Antillean Confederation will never happen.\n\nCuba is closer to Venezuela for obvious reasons, Puerto Rico to the USA for also obvious reasons, and the Dominican Republic is integrating to Central America (minus Costa Rica and Panama). As long that the three countries are aiming towards different ideals, an alliance among the three will never take place.\n\nThe alternative is for the USA to take over all the two largest ones and turn them into larger versions of Puerto Rico.\n\nAnother alternative is for all three of them to return to Spain.\n\nAnyway, these are all impossibilities for now.\n\nOriginally Posted by AntonioR\n\nThe three countries are under different political/economic set ups, but historically there has been much interchange between the three islands plus Venezuela.\n\nDominicans were a huge influence in Cuba's war of independence, in fact one of Cuba's greatest national hero is Maximo Gomez, a Dominican.
