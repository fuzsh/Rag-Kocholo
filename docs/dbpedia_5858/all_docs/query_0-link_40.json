        "text": "1) Plaza Colon (Columbus Square)\n\nColumbus Square, originally known as Santiago Square, is one of the most important squares in San Juan, symbolizing progress and, at the same time, a testament to the old times. In the 17th century, the area marked the doorstep to the city, which was encircled by stone walls, from 1635-1641. The only way into the capital, back then, was through the five gates, the centermost of which was the Puerta de Santiago (or Land Gate), straddling the only highway linking the walled San Juan islet to the rest of Puerto Rico by land.\n\nBy 1772, the open space adjacent to Puerta de Santiago, while still unpaved, had taken the shape of Santiago Square. From 1862 to 1870, it was refurbished and the square finally started to take its current form. In 1893, the statue of Christopher Columbus was installed to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the discovery of Puerto Rico, following which the square itself was renamed Colón or Columbus Square.\n\nTo the south of it, today is the Tapia Theater, a true gem of Puerto Rican entertainment culture. Inaugurated in 1824, this lovely neoclassical structure was initially known as the San Juan Municipal Theater. Throughout the years, many notable performers have graced its stage. Outside the theater, along Fortaleza Street, there are a number of quaint restaurants and cute little cafes where one can sip some iced coffee outside whilst enjoying the sight of Columbus Square.\n\n3) Plaza de Armas (Arms Square) (must see)\n\nArms Square is the de-facto central square of San Juan. Over the years, it has changed several names relative to the functions it served. Initially, in 1521, it was called Vegetables Square. Then, during the 17th-19th centuries, it was known as Arms Square, for being the grounds for military drills. After that, in the early 20th century, it turned back to being called Vegetables Square once again, serving as a marketplace, before it finally re-assumed the Arms Square title.\n\nThe plaza is modeled on the classic squares of Madrid and Mexico City. Although it factually existed for centuries, it was not until 1840 that the city council approved its proper development, which started in 1851. It was at that time that the four bronze statues, oil-coated to simulate marble, representing Commerce, Industry, Science, and the Arts, arrived here (there were a total of eight statues to be installed, but the other four were lost). In 1872, the original statues were replaced with the new marble ones, representing the Four Seasons, put in the four corners of the square.\n\nIn 1955, two circular fountains and two lampposts in the center were added. The four statues were then configured in a circular fountain outside the Palacio de la Real Intendencia, which is the seat of the Department of State of Puerto Rico, on the western side of the square.\n\nA highlight of the northern side is the Casa Alcaldía – home of the San Juan City Hall. Built in 1789, this Spanish colonial-style edifice with twin turrets resembles its sister building in Madrid. The tinkling of the fountain, the comfortable seating in the shade of the trees, and the presence of several old-style coffee booths selling snacks have long attracted tourists as a good spot for a sightseeing break when you can stretch out your feet and soak up some of the everyday comings and goings.\n\nThe laid-back atmosphere of the place also made it a popular gathering venue with locals, offering a chance to buy kids some traditional treats (like sesame-seed lollipops or coconut candies), watch shows, play dominoes, or chit-chat with friends.\n\n4) Plaza de la Rogativa (Procession Square)\n\nPlaza La Rogativa is the most scenic square in San Juan, offering a 180-degree views of the San Juan Bay. From here, you can also get a clear view of the San Juan Gate and La Fortaleza, much as of the El Yunque national forest in a distance.\n\nThe name \"Rogativa\" means \"Procession\". According to a legend, during the 1797 attack by the British army, the governor of San Juan ordered a \"rogativa\" by a group of women, led by the bishop, to march through the city streets at night. Started from the San Juan Cathedral, the procession carried torches and crosses, while singing hymns along the way. The British mistook these sights and sounds for the arrival of Spanish Army reinforcement and gave up the attack. Commemorating that event are the four bronze statues in the center of the square.\n\nDue to its historic significance and scenic beauty, Plaza La Rogativa is also popular a spot for wedding ceremonies. If nothing else, come here in late afternoon to watch the sunset over the San Juan Bay."
