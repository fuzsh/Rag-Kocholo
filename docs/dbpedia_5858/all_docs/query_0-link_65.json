        "text": "Tazas y portadas Bookstore is hosting a book launch and presentation of En barco de papel: La aventura de María Angelina y su papá Eugenio María de Hostos, a new children’s book by writer and educator Linda M. Rodríguez Guglielmoni. Tazas y portadas is located at Suite 4, Bucare Street, Hormigueros, Puerto Rico. The tagline says, “A little girl embarks on a paper boat on a great adventure that leads her to understand the importance of family, home, kindness, and freedom.” The book is about María Angelina de Hostos Ayala and her relationship with her father—Puerto Rican intellectual, philosopher, lawyer, sociologist, and novelist, who advocated for the island’s independence. The book is based on an autobiographical account by Eugenio María de Hostos, En barco de papel, published in Paris, France in 1897.\n\nDescription: En barco de papel: La aventura de María Angelina y su papá Eugenio María de Hostos is an adaptation in six chapters of the autobiographical story, En barco de papel, published in Paris, France in 1897, by Eugenio María de Hostos, father of the ideal of the Antillean Confederation, bringing together Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Cuba. In this re-imagination, which reflects ecological issues and the dangers of the present climatic changes, the main character is María Angelina, Hostos’s youngest daughter, who would be about 5 years old when her father wrote the story. María Angelina—a dreamer and free thinker like her father—is a character with whom children and adults alike can identify and feel with the thrill of embarking on a seafaring adventure that will lead her to a better understanding of the importance of the family, home, kindness, and freedom. In addition, this book serves as an enjoyable introduction to the important historical figure, Eugenio María de Hostos, who not only modernized modes of teaching in schools, but also defended the rights of girls and women to receive a higher academic education and to be considered complete human beings in all societies of the world."
