        "text": "A cohort comprised of high school and college teachers met for one year to build understanding of the critical transition of high school students to college. The seminar analyzed how current reforms in both systems will impact student skill development and preparedness for college work. The discussions highlighted the need to clarify expectations for college freshmen regarding syllabus policies, deadline observations, and the importance of defining consistent classroom management strategies. This program also focused on the need to increase the dialogue between high school teachers and college professors as there exists reciprocal unawareness regarding curricular changes and the learning environment faced by students at both academic levels.\n\nThis 168-page research paper was written for tenure at City Colleges of Chicago. From 2011-2013, I conducted original research and took five doctoral level courses in pedagogy, in training and development, and in literacy education. The research paper reflects the findings of my project, as it relates to Literature Circles, curriculum development, as well as the history of African American Studies and Anthropology at Malcolm X College, City Colleges of Chicago. I was awarded tenure in February 2014 based on the approval of my original research, teaching, curriculum development, service to the college, and service to the community.\n\nSocial media refers to the means of interactions among people in which they create, share and exchange information and ideas in virtual communities and networks. It allows users to converse and interact with each other, to create, edit and share new forms of textual, visual and audio content. Social media has started creating a negative impact by permeating today's society with millions of us engrossed, unhealthy addiction, in the latest happenings via apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and so on. With technology booming rapidly from year to year and the younger generations are the ones caught in this rapid change, it is, therefore, crucial to throw more light on the impact of social media on the academic performance of students.\n\nAcademic burnout is an occupational health syndrome with both psychological and physiological symptoms. It manifests as a debilitating and sometimes life-threatening condition when the extremely educated are under excessive social and occupational stress. Recent studies demonstrate that societal and economic changes have induced metamorphosis of the professoriate from a low-stress to a high-stress occupation. Our knowledge about the nature and incidence of burnout among professors in the United States comes largely from studies confined to specific institutions, medical schools, and research universities. Publication is probably the most obvious and obtainable signal of reduced research productivity, and it is closely connected with academic burnout. I shed light on the potential incidence of academic burnout in university faculty by examining the productivity of 612 tenured life science faculty members from non-doctoral granting departments at 76 regional state universities and liberal arts colleges distributed among 13 randomly selected states. Anything claimed to be a publication on a faculty member's CV or webpage, or via a Google Scholar query was accepted. This definition inflated publication counts making unpublished faculty more difficult to identify. Despite this, about 37% of tenured faculty went unpublished from 2008-2012. State jurisdictions averaged from 19% to 52% of faculty without publications. Departments awarding masters degrees had more published faculty than non-masters awarding departments. The large numbers of unpublished faculty during this five-year window constitutes a smoking gun suggesting that academic burnout (a.k.a., adrenal exhaustion) may be a widespread problem in American regional state universities and public liberal arts colleges. However, supporting psychological and physiological tests are needed to rule out or support definitively the role of academic burnout in the revealed publication patterns of faculty at these mid-tier schools. Institutions with low faculty publication rates should screen faculty to evaluate the degree to which burnout is present, regardless of teaching load. These results beg to question if immediate need exists for strategic implementation of college-wide, self-help programs to reduce the occurrence of stress-related disorders like academic burnout which may threaten the stature of American higher education."
