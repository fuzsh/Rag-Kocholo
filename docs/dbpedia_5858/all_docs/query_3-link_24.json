demographic and socioeconomic conditions faced by this population. In various ways, the book summarizes many of the ideas and issues introduced in our previous individual research, adding new information and insights that we hope will inspire others to continue documenting different aspects of the Puerto Rican migrant experience. For us, this is a challenging, stimulating, and never-ending endeavor. This study is more than the product of intellectual labor; it also represents a labor of love and commitment to our community. Thus, we are hopeful that the book’s virtues and usefulness outweigh any shortcomings it may have. We recognize that there is still a great deal of work to be done to fully document the Puerto Rican experience in the United States, and new generations of Puerto Rican Studies scholars will undoubtedly rise to the challenge. Whenever a book is completed, there are many people to thank who made things easier along the way. First, we need to acknowledge each other for being able to combine our respective scholarly interests with our enduring enthusiasm to work together, which we have been doing for almost two decades as department colleagues and friends. Next, we must express our gratitude to several individuals who greatly facilitated our archival research and compilation of statistical data. These include Alba I. Castillo Blancovich, a now retired librarian at the University of Puerto Rico; archivists Nélida Pérez and Pedro Juan Hernández, and Christopher R. Medina, staff member of the Centro de Estudios Puertorriqueños Library and Archives. They all provided invaluable help in locating documents and photographs that enhanced our work. At the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, data and statistical support were provided by Virginia Carlson of the Department of Urban Planning and Terence Johnson and Peter Maier of the Center for Urban Initiatives and Research.

Our thanks go as well to Gabriel Aquino for his assistance with the design of some of the tables and figures, to Carmen Caamaño and Patricia McCarthy for their help with the References section, and to Librada Pimentel for lending a hand in many different ways throughout the process of completing the manuscript. A special mention to the Juan Antonio Corretjer Puerto Rican Cultural Center (PRCC) in Chicago; José E. López, its executive director; and Alejandro Luis Molina, secretary of its board of directors, for their generosity in giving us permission to use a photograph of the mural Sea of Flags by artists Gamaliel Ramírez and Eren Star Padilla on the paperback cover and in Chapter 7. Appreciation also goes to Juan Sánchez for his permission to include his artwork Conditions that Exist and A Puerto Rican Prisoner of War and Much More in Chapter 7; to Barbara R. Sjostrom for her insightful content and editorial suggestions; and to Susan Liberis-Hill for her valuable assistance with the English translations of some of the cited material. This book is part of Lynne Rienner Publishers’ new series Latinos: Exploring Diversity and Change. We are very pleased that this prominent Latin American and Caribbean Studies publisher is now promoting scholarly endeavors in the growing field of Latino Studies. Our gratitude to Lynne Rienner, Leanne Anderson, and Alan McClare for supporting our manuscript and for their helpful suggestions during the different stages of the publication process. Last but not least, we want to thank our respective families for their steady encouragement and patience during the time-consuming and occasionally trying process of finishing the manuscript. Christine E. Bose and Azara SantiagoRivera, especially, understand this process much too well, since they have experienced it so many times in their own research and writing. They also understand that the best creative sanctuary is found at home, surrounded by the people you love. Their many invaluable comments and suggestions made the book better. —Edna Acosta-Belén and Carlos E.

Thus it is not unreasonable to predict that before 2010 the number of Puerto Ricans living in the United States will surpass the total island population (see Chapter 4). In fact, some of the most recent population estimates are being used to support the claim that this has already happened (see Falcón 2004). Although more than half (58 percent) of the Puerto Rican diaspora was born in the continental United States, this fact does not change the reality that a large portion of this population remains strongly connected to the island of Puerto Rico. Consequently, the lives of Puerto Ricans from both shores seem to be inexorably intertwined; and more than ever before, the Boricuas “de la banda acá” and “de la banda allá” (Puerto Ricans from this shore here and that shore there) described in a popular plena (a type of folk music),1 are experiencing the diverse effects of reciprocal cultural and socioeconomic exchanges between the island and the US metropolis. They also experience those stemming from over one hundred years of a colonial relationship that lingers without any signs of a prompt resolution. Puerto Rican migration to the North American continent grew out of specific political and socioeconomic conditions, whether it happened under Spanish colonial rule or under the US regime. After the US invasion of Puerto Rico, a result of the Spanish-Cuban-American War of 1898,2 contract labor to Hawaii, New York, and other US localities, as well as to the Dominican Republic and Cuba, became a colonial government strategy for dealing with the island’s high rates of poverty and unemployment, and for satisfying the expanding North American industrial and agricultural sector’s need for low-wage labor. Nonetheless, to this day, migration has never been acknowledged as part of any official policy either by US or Puerto Rican government officials. The current association between the United States and Puerto Rico is the result of a set of economic and political circumstances that developed through1\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n2\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:35 PM\n\nPage 2\n\nPuerto Ricans in the United States\n\nout the nineteenth century, intensified during the twentieth, and still shape the present lives and conditions faced by the Puerto Rican people in both settings (see Chapters 2 and 3). This colonial relationship has brought forth both positive and negative consequences and changes for Puerto Ricans that continue to limit their possibilities of envisioning a future that responds to their national needs and self-interests rather than to those of the North American nation. In this sense, the situation of Puerto Ricans offers a compelling example of US government policies and actions in pursuit of its hegemonic ambition in the hemisphere that continue to influence the present. An obvious aftereffect of these policies and actions is the uninterrupted and overwhelming influx of Puerto Ricans and other Latino populations to the United States. Latinos, with a population in the United States that had reached 41.3 million in 2005, are now the largest and fastest-growing minority group in US society. Puerto Ricans represent over 9 percent of the total Latino population, and more than double that percentage, if one combines the US-based Puerto Rican population with that of the island of Puerto Rico.3 The dramatic growth in the number of US Latinos, which is projected to continue throughout the twenty-first century, is transforming the lives of almost every Latin American and Caribbean nationality—Puerto Ricans included—both in the United States and in their respective countries of origin. The Caribbeanization and Latinization of many major cities and localities are adding a new vitality to US society while challenging the melting pot or Anglo-conformity assimilation model, as new (im)migrant groups, most noticeably Latinos, are now more inclined than before to preserve their respective cultural and linguistic heritage, and are quite comfortable functioning in two cultures and languages. This pattern is common in many European countries, but was not so in the United States until the latter part of the twentieth century. When describing Puerto Rican migration, scholars have often referred to “a commuter nation” (Rivera-Batiz and Santiago 1994; Torre, Vecchini, and Burgos 1994) or characterized it as a “revolving door” or “circular” migration (Tienda and Díaz 1987; Meléndez 1993b). All these characterizations share the basic notion not only that Puerto Rican migration is a continuous occurrence but also that there is a great deal of back-and-forth movement of Puerto Ricans between the island and the US metropolis. These descriptions also imply that some Puerto Ricans migrate to the United States but do not necessarily stay there permanently and eventually return to the island. The reality is that although migration might have been originally envisioned by government officials as a one-way movement of people settling in the United States that would alleviate Puerto Rico’s severe unemployment and surplus labor problems, some workers saw this move as a temporary measure for economic survival. Many migrated to the United States to try their lot before deciding to uproot their families. Some returned to Puerto Rico, but a large number of those first-generation migrants established permanent residence in the United States.\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:35 PM\n\nPage 3\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nThere were those who kept alive the idea of sooner or later returning to the island, and some did and still do. But the research on return-migration patterns is not adequate to determine the magnitude of this incidence, and that research is already dated (Hernández Alvarez [1967] 1976; Meléndez 1993c). The studies that have shown that about two-thirds of Puerto Ricans who emigrate to the United States have lived there before and those returning to Puerto Rico also have lived there at some point have confirmed the presence of a circular migration pattern and of transnational processes than continue to fortify the connection between the island and the diaspora (Meléndez 1993c). Year after year, Puerto Rican workers in the blue-collar, professional, and business sectors, students, politicians, and others continue to move with relative ease between Puerto Rico and the United States in pursuit of their respective endeavors. It can be thoroughly documented that the great majority of Puerto Ricans who migrate settle and carry on productive lives in the United States, eventually producing new generations of US-born Puerto Ricans that develop or maintain different kinds of connections to Puerto Rico (see Chapters 4 and 5). Migration, which is not by any means a fortuitous process, and the unique status of Puerto Ricans as colonial migrants contribute to the demographic conditions described above, which are projected to continue in the decades ahead. The current “guagua aérea” (air or flying bus)—a metaphor invented by renowned Puerto Rican writer Luis Rafael Sánchez to characterize the back and forth migratory movement between the island and the United States—is making it unavoidable for Puerto Ricans from both shores to ignore each other anymore.4 Mass migration from Puerto Rico is closely linked to the advent of air travel (see Chapter 3). Therefore, the image of a commuter nation or a “nation on the move” (Duany 2002) is now more solidified, and this transnational migration pattern is influencing Puerto Rican lives in ways that make it no longer possible to ignore or downplay. Its socioeconomic, political, and cultural ramifications are ever present and are shaping discussions and decisions on major issues influencing the well-being and future of all Puerto Ricans. It is now quite common for US Puerto Ricans and Latinos serving in Congress to be sought out or lobbied by island politicians on issues related to federal funding for Puerto Rico’s social programs, or to rally them to exert pressure on political issues that have a bearing on some aspect of island life. A case in point occurred when island Puerto Ricans were trying to get the US Navy to cease its bombing-training practices in Puerto Rico’s island municipality of Vieques (see Chapter 8). Conversely, US Puerto Ricans have been making it clear that they want to be included in any future congressional discussions or decisions related to the process of seeking new alternatives to end the island’s current colonial status. Whether one refers to the “crossroads,” “dilemmas,” or “paradoxes” facing Puerto Ricans, these characterizations indicate that after more than a century of US domination, Puerto Rico remains “an unincorporated territory” of\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n4\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:35 PM\n\nPage 4\n\nPuerto Ricans in the United States\n\nthe North American nation; neither a state of the federal union nor a sovereign nation. It is a remnant of colonialism, a nation still wedged in an ambivalent political condition that keeps it a considerable source of profits for US corporate capital. Puerto Rico, although not so much as in the past, is a major strategic military site for US armed forces. At the same time, the island maintains a large degree of economic dependence and reaps the benefits of its association with the most powerful country in the world. Among those benefits is US citizenship, which Puerto Ricans have held since 1917 as a result of the Jones Act, a congressional decree that, paradoxically, also gave island Puerto Ricans a larger degree of self-government (see Chapter 3). The fact that Puerto Ricans do not enjoy the same equal treatment or benefits held by other US citizens living in the fifty states of the union is negligible to some island residents, although many, especially those who oppose the current Commonwealth status, still regard their US citizenship as “second class.” These feelings stem from the fact that island Puerto Ricans lack any representation in the US Congress besides the presence of a nonvoting “resident commissioner.”5 They do not vote in presidential or congressional elections, nor do they pay federal income taxes.6 However, Puerto Rico receives more than $13 billion annually in federal transfers from the US Congress to support its social programs and infrastructure. Programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment compensation, and a few others are extended to the island as if it were another state of the union. Concomitantly, US corporations make incalculable profits and receive substantial federal tax benefits from their investments in Puerto Rico, and they exert an overwhelming control over the island’s economy, which in reality is totally integrated into the US economy and thus, subject to its cyclical fluctuations and flows. All in all, Puerto Ricans frequently find themselves in the odd position of being treated by the US Congress—site of the ultimate decisionmaking power regarding island affairs—as an entity that is “foreign to the United States in a domestic sense.”7 What this paradoxical and ambiguous statement really means is that island Puerto Ricans are often treated like colonial subjects who happen to be the holders of US citizenship and who should be grateful for all the benevolence bestowed upon their nation by the United States but who are, in the end, culturally different foreigners and thus not considered “real” Americans. Underlying these contradictions is a deep-rooted reluctance on the part of the US Congress to contemplate either future statehood for Puerto Rico—an idea that often seems as insurmountable or unpalatable to some North American government officials as the idea of independence—or, for that matter, any of the other possible alternatives for removing some of the colonial limitations and enhancing the current Commonwealth. This political status is officially known in Spanish as the Estado Libre Asociado (Associated Free State) (see Chapter 3), a clear misnomer when one considers that Puerto Rico is neither a free nor a sovereign nation, and Puerto Rican citizenship is not legally recog-\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:35 PM\n\nPage 5\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nnized in an international context. The harsh reality is that resolving Puerto Rico’s colonial “association” with the United States is an issue that has a long history of being rejected or tabled by the US Congress almost every time it comes up for discussion.8 In addition, these same officials continue to pay lip service to the notion that “Puerto Ricans must make up their minds” about their future political status, and they do not miss an opportunity to boast about the nation’s generosity toward Puerto Rico or decry the island’s ceaseless dependence on federal funds. They also manage to downplay the fact that the US Congress, the only body empowered to change Puerto Rico’s present condition, has historically shown little interest in doing so. Perhaps the only certainties about what is often described as Puerto Rico’s “colonial dilemma” (Meléndez and Meléndez 1993) is that Puerto Ricans across the political spectrum have not been able to envision a future for their country without some kind of close relationship to the United States and that they continue to reaffirm passionately the integrity of their distinctive Caribbean/Latin American cultural connections and the Spanish language. Nor has the US government shown any compelling desire to support substantial changes in the island’s current status. In the meantime, the influx of Puerto Rican migrants into the United States continues unabated, maintaining a commuter or circular migration pattern between the island and the colonial metropolis. This transnational flow daily brings large numbers of Puerto Rican workers to the United States searching for better economic and professional opportunities and simultaneously allows the generations of Puerto Ricans born or raised in the United States to keep up their connections with the country of their ancestors. It is within the context outlined above that we approach this interdisciplinary portrait of Puerto Ricans in the United States as a commuter nation. This brief introduction is followed in Chapter 2 by an overview of the historical and cultural roots of the Puerto Rican people, with special emphasis on their colonial experience under both Spanish and US rule. A framework is provided for analyzing migration in terms of the dynamics of colonialism and capitalist development in Puerto Rico. Control of the island’s economy by US capitalist interests intensified after the 1898 takeover, making the Puerto Rican worker part of a flexible and movable labor reserve to satisfy the needs of North American companies both in the island and the metropolis. Early on, migration became an official tool or “safety valve” to deal with Puerto Rico’s widespread poverty and unemployment. Migration continued to grow throughout the twentieth century, especially after World War II, unleashing a process that is still a vital aspect of Puerto Rican life. The bulk of Chapters 3 and 4 is dedicated to a discussion of the factors that contributed to the various Puerto Rican migratory waves to the United States, including a comparative analysis of different phases and patterns of migration. Chapter 3 deals with the early settlements, or colonias, established in New York City and other US localities during the second half of the nineteenth\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n6\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:35 PM\n\nPage 6\n\nPuerto Ricans in the United States\n\ncentury and first three decades of the twentieth, and Chapter 4 focuses on the postwar “Great Migration” of the 1940s and 1950s and the migratory patterns that have developed since then. A demographic portrait of Puerto Ricans in the United States is provided in Chapter 5; census data from the year 2000 and other subsequent population reports are used to assess their current collective status. Relying on the most recent data, we analyze the changes that have occurred in the overall status of US Puerto Ricans, emphasizing population increases and geographic dispersion, labor force participation, income, as well as other socioeconomic and educational indicators. We also discuss some major differences in the demographic profile of US and island Puerto Ricans. In Chapter 6 we provide a detailed account of the diaspora’s social, political, and educational struggles during the civil rights era, inserting Puerto Ricans into a movement that is still largely identified with the African American population. We provide a profile of the most vital community organizations and of their different activities. Chapter 7 focuses on the diaspora’s creativity in literature, music, and the arts, emphasizing Puerto Rican efforts to build a distinctive cultural tradition within the United States. The voices and images of writers and artists represent another dimension of the contemporary portrait of US Puerto Rican life that we provide in this book. Chapter 8 features concluding observations that highlight the uniqueness of the Puerto Rican migrant experience and the present dilemmas and future challenges still confronting Puerto Ricans on the island and within the diaspora. The underlying thread of this book is twofold. First, in order to provide a contemporary portrait of Puerto Ricans in the United States, we document and analyze the historical, socioeconomic, and political factors that propel Puerto Ricans to migrate in large numbers. Second, we examine how Puerto Ricans adapt and forge their lives in the metropolis and the socioeconomic conditions and challenges they currently face. Due attention is given to the creative ways in which migrants adjust to a new environment, how they carry out their lives and create new communities, and how they contribute to US society, struggle for their rights, claim their cultural spaces, and negotiate their exposure to two different cultures and languages. Of special interest to the authors is the Puerto Rico–US back and forth transnational connection and how it shapes the construction of Puerto Rican identities and creates an enduring sense of cultural affirmation and resistance within the diaspora. US Puerto Rican writers and artists have found their own creative ways of asserting their differences from island Puerto Ricans by embracing new labels to identify themselves, such as Nuyoricans, Neoricans, or Diasporicans.9 Others have just adopted the term “Boricua,” which is a form of identification traditionally used by island Puerto Ricans. But unlike the popular term “Chicano,” adopted in the 1960s by a large portion of the population of Mexican descent in the United States to dif-\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:35 PM\n\nPage 7\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nferentiate itself from Mexico’s population and from more recent immigrants from that country, there is no adequate single term that has yet captured the imagination of most US Puerto Ricans in a similar way. Thus they continue to identify themselves primarily as Puerto Ricans, whether they are living on the island or in the metropolis. The authors have attempted to address and carefully document the information and issues included in the various chapters. Nevertheless, there is a great deal of research that still needs to be done in order to achieve a more complete picture of the collective lives and endeavors of Puerto Rican migrants in the numerous US localities where they have settled and in new emerging communities. In the early 1970s, Frank Bonilla, founder of the Centro de Estudios Puertorriqueños in New York City, in his essay “Beyond Survival: Por qué seguiremos siendo puertorriqueños” (Why We Will Continue Being Puerto Rican, 1974), deplored the negative portrayals of Puerto Ricans perpetuated in most of the social science literature. He argued then for the need to break away from the barrage of recurrent and confining negative images and from the internalized inferiority complex that dominated the discourses about the Puerto Rican people, and which were by-products of their subordinate colonial experience. Bonilla also stressed the urgency for “an unprecedented job of psychological and cultural reconstitution and construction” in order for Puerto Ricans “to grow affirmatively as a culturally integrated and distinctive collectivity” (363–364). This process would make it possible for them to move beyond the mere notion of survival as a community and engage in developing “a collective vision that reaches out to Puerto Ricans everywhere” (370). Bonilla was responding to basic shortcomings in the available scholarship on US Puerto Ricans, which was often shortsighted, misinformed, or full of problem-oriented or despairing representations. Little had been done to document the full history of Puerto Rican migration to the United States, and with few exceptions, the majority of the studies about the diaspora were markedly skewed or recycled prevalent myths or stereotypes. But, above all, there was the recognition that a great divide existed between island and migrant communities, and that those Puerto Ricans living on the island were largely indifferent to or ignorant about the lives and struggles faced by their compatriots in the United States. These statements stand out even more if one considers that migration continues to be part of the normal course of life and an acceptable condition for the Puerto Rican people. Despite these assertions, there is no question that for a long time the separation between island and US communities was palpable, and islanders tended to perceive of the Puerto Rican migrant as poverty ridden, welfare dependent, and culturally deprived. A great deal has changed since the 1970s thanks largely to the initiative and commitment of many US-based Puerto Rican Studies scholars and activists\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n8\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:35 PM\n\nPage 8\n\nPuerto Ricans in the United States\n\nwho, like Frank Bonilla, challenged old assumptions, rectified omissions, and produced new scholarship that depicts more accurately the wide range of experiences and contributions of a primarily working-class Puerto Rican diaspora. Now a legitimate and fairly institutionalized academic endeavor, the field of Puerto Rican Studies was first conceptualized in the United States and was shaped by the experiences and struggles of Puerto Ricans as a marginalized ethnoracial minority within US society.10 Part of the wider ethnic studies movement, and made possible by the advocacy and vision of intellectuals, students, and community activists, Puerto Rican Studies and other nontraditional fields made important strides in generating new scholarship and pedagogy that not only drew attention to the multiracial and multiethnic character of US society but also exposed some of the ethnocentric, racist, and sexist biases and normative assumptions of the traditional disciplines in their depictions of subaltern groups. Thus, since the early 1970s, both US-based and island researchers have been developing a more nuanced understanding of the historical roots, power relations, and colonial dynamics that explain Puerto Rican migration, including an analysis of the transnational links that exist between island and US communities. In this book we explore many different aspects of this transnational circuit. For many years, most studies of the Puerto Rican diaspora limited their scope to the larger and more established New York City community. But since the 1990s, geographic dispersion has become an important characteristic of Puerto Rican migration, and the New York population now represents about one-fourth of the total Puerto Rican population currently residing in the United States (see Chapter 4). This new reality is forcing scholars to pay more attention to the history and evolution of other communities, particularly the Puerto Rican presence in cities like Chicago (Padilla 1985), Hartford (Cruz 1998), Philadelphia (Whalen 2001), and the Hawaiian islands (Camacho Souza 1982, 1986; Rosario Natal 1983). Other growing communities, such as those in Orlando and Kissimmee, Florida (Duany and Matos-Rodríguez 2005), and several cities in Massachusetts and California are increasingly drawing the attention of researchers. We made an effort to synthesize some of the available research but also relied on primary sources of information, especially community newspapers and the records of several grassroots organizations largely overlooked in previous studies, as well as the most current US census data. At the same time, we hope that this study brings other researchers and readers new insights into the unfinished quest to advance knowledge about the realities, struggles, and enduring legacies of those Puerto Ricans who under a variety of circumstances made their lives away from their native island. These migrants are producing new generations that seek a more accurate understanding of their roots, the history of their respective communities, and their collective place in US society.\n\n01_Chap01.qxd\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:35 PM\n\nPage 9\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nNotes 1, The expression “Boricuas de la banda allá, Boricuas de la banda acá” comes from the lyrics of the plena “A los boricuas ausentes” (To the Boricuas Who Left) popularized by César Concepción and his Orchestra. “Boricua,” a word of Taino indigenous origin, was used during the Spanish colonial period to refer to the native inhabitants of Puerto Rico and is now a synonym for Puerto Rican. 2. Generally known as the Spanish-American War, some scholars have argued that when the United States invaded Cuba in 1898, there was a war going on between the Spanish and the Cubans that had started in 1895, thus making the name SpanishCuban-American War more appropriate. The United States declared war against Spain in retaliation for the explosion of the Maine at the port of Havana. The declaration of war was followed by the invasion of, first, Cuba and, a few months later, Puerto Rico. US intervention in the Spanish-Cuban War was magnified by the North American press’s mythification of the role of Teddy Roosevelt and the Rough Riders in defeating the Spanish and liberating Cuba. Thus the role of the Cuban rebel army was undermined in US official accounts of the war. We are in agreement with those scholars who argue that the name Spanish-Cuban-American War reflects more accurately the historical reality behind this conflict. This conflict is also often referred to as the War of 1898. See Philip Foner, The Spanish-Cuban-American War and the Birth of U.S. Imperialism (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1972); and Louis A. Pérez, The War of 1898: The United States and Cuba in History and Historiography (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1998). 3. The US census official definition of the Hispanic (Latino) population includes only the twenty nationalities from the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America, the Caribbean, and Spain, but excludes the Puerto Rican population residing in Puerto Rico. In other words, Puerto Ricans are not counted as part of the Hispanic population unless they reside in one of the fifty states. 4. See Luis Rafael Sánchez, La guagua aérea (San Juan: Editorial Cultural, 1994). 5. A nonvoting “resident commissioner,” elected by the voting residents of Puerto Rico, has represented Puerto Rico in the US Congress since 1900. Between 1993 and 1995, under the Democratic Party administration of President Bill Clinton, the resident commissioner was given voting rights in the US Congress. This practice was rescinded when the Republican Party won the congressional elections of 1994 and took control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. 6. Although island Puerto Ricans are not allowed to vote in US presidential or congressional elections, presidential primaries are held in Puerto Rico and both Democratic and Republican candidates actively campaign on the island for party convention delegates to support their nominations. 7. The statement “foreign to the United States in a domestic sense” is part of the Foraker Act, passed by the US Congress in 1900, which ended two years of North American military occupation and established a civil government in Puerto Rico. See Christina Duffy Burnett and Burke Marshall, eds., Foreign in a Domestic Sense: Puerto Rico, American Expansion, and the Constitution (Durham: Duke University Press, 2001). A more detailed discussion appears in Chapter 3 of this book. 8. For a detailed account of the long history of political status referenda or plebiscite bills introduced in the US Congress since the 1960s, see Juan Manuel García Passalacqua and Carlos Rivera Lugo, Puerto Rico y los Estados Unidos: El proceso de consulta y negociación de 1989 y 1990, 2 vols.

The term “Nuyorican” was adopted in the 1970s by New York–based Puerto Rican poets and artists. See Miguel Algarín and Miguel Piñero, eds., Nuyorican Poetry: An Anthology of Words and Feelings (New York: William Morrow, 1975); and Miguel Algarín and Bob Holman, eds., Aloud: Voices from the Nuyorican Poets Cafe (New York: H. Holt, 1994). Since the 1970s, the terms “Nuyorican” and “Neorican” have been frequently used, especially by island Puerto Ricans, to refer to US Puerto Ricans. The term “Diasporican” was introduced by poet Mariposa Hernández in her poem “Ode to the Diasporican.” In some of the literature about Puerto Rican migration the terms “mainland” and “stateside” Puerto Ricans are used to distinguish the population living in the United States from that of the island. In this book we refer to island and US Puerto Ricans to differentiate both populations. Whether hyphenated or not, the term “Puerto Rican Americans” has been used by some North American scholars to describe the migrant population, such as Joseph P. Fitzpatrick, Puerto Rican Americans: The Meaning of Migration to the Mainland (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1971). This term, however, did not have much appeal within the community and it is rarely used today. Some scholars argued that since Puerto Ricans are US citizens by birth the term was redundant. Others rejected it on political grounds as a sign of colonialism or cultural assimilation. 10. For example, the University at Albany’s Puerto Rican Studies Program was initiated in 1970, and it became a full-fledged academic department offering a major in 1974. The department later evolved into the current Department of Latin American, Caribbean, and U.S. Latino Studies (LACS).\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 11\n\n2 The Colonial Experience\n\nT\n\nhe Spanish accounts of the indigenous “people who discovered Columbus” (Keegan 1992) during his voyages to the Caribbean islands, later to be known as the West Indies or the Antilles,1 make a distinction between the peaceful Taino native inhabitants with whom they first came in contact and the reputedly warlike and cannibalistic Caribs, who frequently came to their coasts and raided their villages. However, some anthropologists have argued that the widespread dichotomy between the two Amerindian groups is the result of the colonizers’ imagination, and that the distinction they made between the two indigenous groups mostly reflected Spanish self-interests, their less successful attempts at conquering and converting the Caribs than the Tainos, and the Caribs’ fierce resistance to the European invaders (Sued-Badillo 1978). Notwithstanding, the questionable origin of the names attributed to each of the first two aboriginal groups mentioned in the European chronicles of the Spanish Conquest reaffirms the Manichean, or dualistic, nature of their initial characterization: the indigenous word “Taino,” said to mean noble or good (Keegan 1992), and “Carib,” standing for great warrior or referring to the group’s alleged cannibalistic practices (Boucher 1992). Some anthropologists have rejected the original Taino/Carib dichotomy altogether and maintain that despite the conflictive relationship between these two aboriginal groups, they were not significantly different from one another, at least ethnically (Sued-Badillo 1978; Hulme 1986). Two unfortunate circumstances limit our knowledge of these indigenous populations and their cultural practices. The first is that besides the symbols that appear in their stone carvings or petroglyphs, they did not leave a written historical record to rely upon. Second, their rapid extinction after the encounter with the Spaniards left little historical memory. Most anthropologists of the pre-Columbian era, however, have been in agreement that the Taino indigenous population that inhabited Puerto Rico and much of the West Indies at the time of the Spanish Conquest migrated from the northern shores of the South American continent.2 They have traced the ori11\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n12\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 12\n\nPuerto Ricans in the United States\n\ngins of the Taino to the Orinoco Valley in Venezuela. Despite the very different methodologies employed in these studies, Rouse (1986) argued that the following consensus seems to have emerged: From a geographical point of view, the ancestors of the Tainos could have entered the West Indies via either the east coast of Venezuela, Trinidad, or the Guianas. The historic evidence favors Trinidad and the Guianas; Arawakan speakers were concentrated there during the Historic Age. Nevertheless, archeologists and, to a lesser extent, linguists have focused upon Trinidad and the east coast of Venezuela in tracing the ancestors of the Tainos back to the mainland. Having failed in this endeavor, they are now turning their attention to the Guianas. (154–155)\n\nThere seems to be little doubt that Amerindians traveled frequently across the chain of islands that make up the West Indies and that significant movement occurred between continent and islands, within the Caribbean island chain, and the circum-Caribbean area. Indigenous groups settled the islands of the West Indies and traversed the Caribbean Sea with considerable regularity, as indicated by the dispersion of their cultural remains. For them, territory was limited only by the technology of sea transport at the time. Anthropologists have even found evidence of Mesoamerican influence on West Indian aboriginal cultures, suggesting contacts by sea among different groups from more distant regions (Fernández Méndez 1972). Regarding the Tainos, there has been a tendency to refer to them also as Arawaks, which is the name of an indigenous language family of South American origin, but some anthropologists (Rouse 1986, 1992; Keegan 1992) have contended that although there were linguistic similarities between Tainos and Caribs, they spoke a different language and exhibited some cultural differences from the South American Arawaks. Thus, Rouse (1986) suggested that when referring to the inhabitants of the West Indies at the time of contact with the Europeans, Tainos is more correct than Arawaks. In any event, there is at least sufficient evidence to establish that the Tainos occupied the islands of the Greater Antilles and that the Caribs settled in the Lesser Antilles; the latter were legendary for their frequent and belligerent incursions into the other islands, including Puerto Rico. The rudimentary descriptions and accounts that we have of the lives of the Tainos were made by the Spanish, so we are left with a portrait of the conquered provided by the conqueror. One of these accounts, that of Spanish missionary Fray Bartolomé de las Casas, from 1552 (see Casas 1951, vol. 2, 356), mentions the daily visits of inhabitants of the eastern tip of Hispaniola, where Columbus first landed, to Puerto Rico, across the Mona passage, a route that is now frequently traveled by some Dominicans seeking entry, albeit on an undocumented basis, into Puerto Rico. Even today, it is not uncommon for overturned yolas (small wooden boats) to wash up on Puerto Rico’s northwestern shores\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 13\n\nThe Colonial Experience\n\n13\n\nwith little evidence of any occupants. And yet, the Dominican-born population of Puerto Rico now stands at over 100,000, further evidence of a strong migratory route through Puerto Rico that often ends in the United States.3 The presence of the Taino legacy in contemporary Puerto Rico is best represented in the remains of their pottery, stone artifacts, and symbols found in archeological sites, in the names of numerous towns and places, and in many commonly used words that were adapted from their native language into Spanish (Malaret 1955; Hernández Aquino 1969; Fernández Méndez 1972; Alvarez Nazario 1977). The physical appearance of a small percentage of the racially mixed Puerto Rican population still reflects the indigenous influence. Legends and myths about the Tainos, including their rebellions and subjugation by the Spaniards, also appear in the chronicles of the colonial era and have been recreated in the writings of Puerto Rican creoles, particularly throughout the nineteenth century, although they have continued to inspire many contemporary writers as well.4 The symbols from Taino stone carvings, found largely in some of the towns around Puerto Rico’s Cordillera Central mountain range, usually find their way into the island’s visual arts, popular crafts, and tourist commodities. The island’s Taino heritage is frequently celebrated in local festivities, such as in the annual mountain towns’ Festival Indígena (Indigenous Festival) of the town of Jayuya and Festival Areyto (Indigenous Dance Festival) of the town of Villalba. The original Taino villages were headed by caciques (chieftains). Their social and political structure is interesting because of their matrilineal tradition: Some women could inherit land and political power, and a few are referred to as cacicas in the Spanish chronicles. According to anthropologist Sued-Badillo (1979), Taino women from the upper social strata played a significant role in the community’s political life, and there was a collective approach among the Tainos for incorporating women into many of their rituals and activities (41). Rituals such as the areyto were described in colonial writings as a mixture of dancing and oral recitation, a way of preserving and passing along the native population’s history and traditions. Taino religion was focused on worshipping nature and atmospheric phenomena: Guabancex, the great goddess of the earth; Yocahú, the god of heaven and father of life and death; and Huracán, who controlled the seasonal hurricanes that are so common in the Caribbean region.5 The mountains of Puerto Rico inspired the religious cemí, the small stone idols that guarded the spirits of their tribal ancestors. These deities and other artifacts have been recovered in large numbers from archeological sites. The myth about the docility of the Tainos contributed to the image of the “noble savage” that the Europeans frequently contrasted with that of the “barbaric” Caribs. Whether the Tainos were deserving of their peaceful reputation is subject to challenge, since there are some indications that they rebelled against the Spanish invader, as most indigenous groups did at some point. It is\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n14\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 14\n\nPuerto Ricans in the United States\n\ntrue that although colonization of Puerto Rico began in 1508, the Spanish could not establish control of the island until 1511, after subduing a major indigenous rebellion under the leadership of chieftain Agueybaná II. It was also recorded that the Taino population of the West Indies was almost extinct by the late 1500s. Even though the Spanish conquest brought about the extermination of the indigenous Tainos, a Taino revival movement gained popularity during the 1990s. The Taino imaginary, or the recovery of the memory of an indigenous past, has been an important component of Puerto Rican national identity since the nineteenth century, but it has taken a new life in contemporary Puerto Rico, as well as among Puerto Ricans in the United States. On the island, it represents an important component of Puerto Rican cultural nationalism celebrated and propagated through state institutions, the media and advertising, local festivities, arts and crafts, and educational curricula. Within the Puerto Rican diaspora in the United States, Taino images and symbols also are a vibrant aspect of its cultural expressions and activities. Haslip-Viera (1999) claimed that the contemporary Taino revival movement should be seen in a broader context as “part of a much larger phenomenon in which disaffected or alienated individuals are attracted to alternative cultures and lifestyles because of prejudice, discrimination, poor living conditions, and severely limited economic and social opportunities” (6). Those critical of this revival movement have argued that the mythification of a long past Taino heritage tended to undermine the stronger and more visible African roots of Puerto Rican culture, and was another manifestation of the underlying racism and reluctance on the part of the cultural elites to accept the mulatto character of the Puerto Rican nation (Jiménez-Román 1999). Other scholars validated the notion that emphasizing the indigenous Taino heritage was a sign of cultural resistance and a way of counterbalancing the harmful effects of Spanish and US colonialism on Puerto Rican history and culture.6 Despite this debate, it is clear that even after more than five centuries of the Spanish arrival in Puerto Rico, the influence of the Taino cultural roots is still a vital component of the Puerto Rican national imaginary and of any definition of the Puerto Rican nation put forth by the intellectual elites or other groups.\n\nThe Beginnings of Spanish Colonial Rule The first encounter between the Spanish and the Taino indigenous population took place on November 19, 1493, during Christopher Columbus’s second voyage to what became known as the New World. According to Spanish chronicles, the island’s Taino name, Boriquén, meant “tierra del altivo señor” (land of the valiant warrior), an indication of the gallantry and respect conveyed by the native caciques. Columbus named the island Isla de San Juan Bautista in\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n14\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 14\n\nPuerto Ricans in the United States\n\ntrue that although colonization of Puerto Rico began in 1508, the Spanish could not establish control of the island until 1511, after subduing a major indigenous rebellion under the leadership of chieftain Agueybaná II.

Columbus named the island Isla de San Juan Bautista in\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 15\n\nThe Colonial Experience\n\n15\n\nhonor of St. John the Baptist, who became the island’s patron saint. The indigenous name of the island was eventually adapted into Spanish as Borinquen, another name commonly used to refer to Puerto Rico. The terms “borinqueños,” “borincanos,” and “boricuas,” for the island’s native population, also appeared during the Spanish colonial period (Hernández Aquino 1969). The territory of the island of Puerto Rico is only around 3,500 square miles; nearby are a few even smaller islands, two of which—Vieques and Culebra—are currently populated. The Spaniards therefore focused their early colonizing efforts on the larger neighboring islands of Hispaniola (present-day Dominican Republic and Haiti) and Cuba. Serious efforts to colonize Puerto Rico did not begin until 1508, more than a decade and a half after Columbus’s arrival. It was then that Juan Ponce de León, who had accompanied Columbus during his second voyage, was sent to the island to lead the colonizing enterprise. Ponce de León established the island’s first settlement, the Villa de Caparra, not far from the country’s largest port, soon to be known as Puerto Rico. Early in the colonial period, the Spanish name of the island and that of its main port were interchanged. Spanish colonization of the Caribbean islands brought about the rapid decimation of the indigenous population; it was almost extinct by the end of the century after the first contact. The effects of the Spanish encomienda system of land concessions relied on forced indigenous labor. These exploitative conditions, along with warfare, new diseases, and suicide, all contributed to what Fray Bartolomé de las Casas described as “the devastation of the Indies” (1552, 1974, 1992). By 1594, just over a century after the Spanish arrival, Puerto Rico’s indigenous population, 1,545 inhabitants, had largely vanished (Sued-Badillo and López Cantos 1986, 85). According to estimates, this figure represents about 3 percent of the indigenous population at the time of the conquest.\n\nThe African Heritage Enslaved Africans, especially from the West Sudan and the Bantu regions, were brought to Puerto Rico beginning in the early years of colonization, later in larger numbers, as the colonizers needed to replace the rapidly declining Taino labor force in agricultural and mining tasks (Alvarez Nazario 1974). In addition, the slaves were used for domestic service and the construction of roads, buildings, and military fortifications. The population of African origin, however, did not surpass that of the indigenous Tainos until the 1590s, when it rose to around 2,281 (Sued-Badillo and López Cantos 1986, 85). This figure was not to increase in any significant way until the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, when Spain fostered immigration to Puerto Rico in order to promote economic development. The expanded economic activity increased the demand for enslaved labor. Thus, there was enough growth in the African-\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 15\n\nThe Colonial Experience\n\n15\n\nhonor of St. John the Baptist, who became the island’s patron saint. The indigenous name of the island was eventually adapted into Spanish as Borinquen, another name commonly used to refer to Puerto Rico. The terms “borinqueños,” “borincanos,” and “boricuas,” for the island’s native population, also appeared during the Spanish colonial period (Hernández Aquino 1969). The territory of the island of Puerto Rico is only around 3,500 square miles; nearby are a few even smaller islands, two of which—Vieques and Culebra—are currently populated. The Spaniards therefore focused their early colonizing efforts on the larger neighboring islands of Hispaniola (present-day Dominican Republic and Haiti) and Cuba. Serious efforts to colonize Puerto Rico did not begin until 1508, more than a decade and a half after Columbus’s arrival. It was then that Juan Ponce de León, who had accompanied Columbus during his second voyage, was sent to the island to lead the colonizing enterprise. Ponce de León established the island’s first settlement, the Villa de Caparra, not far from the country’s largest port, soon to be known as Puerto Rico. Early in the colonial period, the Spanish name of the island and that of its main port were interchanged. Spanish colonization of the Caribbean islands brought about the rapid decimation of the indigenous population; it was almost extinct by the end of the century after the first contact. The effects of the Spanish encomienda system of land concessions relied on forced indigenous labor. These exploitative conditions, along with warfare, new diseases, and suicide, all contributed to what Fray Bartolomé de las Casas described as “the devastation of the Indies” (1552, 1974, 1992). By 1594, just over a century after the Spanish arrival, Puerto Rico’s indigenous population, 1,545 inhabitants, had largely vanished (Sued-Badillo and López Cantos 1986, 85). According to estimates, this figure represents about 3 percent of the indigenous population at the time of the conquest.\n\nThe African Heritage Enslaved Africans, especially from the West Sudan and the Bantu regions, were brought to Puerto Rico beginning in the early years of colonization, later in larger numbers, as the colonizers needed to replace the rapidly declining Taino labor force in agricultural and mining tasks (Alvarez Nazario 1974). In addition, the slaves were used for domestic service and the construction of roads, buildings, and military fortifications. The population of African origin, however, did not surpass that of the indigenous Tainos until the 1590s, when it rose to around 2,281 (Sued-Badillo and López Cantos 1986, 85). This figure was not to increase in any significant way until the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, when Spain fostered immigration to Puerto Rico in order to promote economic development. The expanded economic activity increased the demand for enslaved labor. Thus, there was enough growth in the African-\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n16\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 16\n\nPuerto Ricans in the United States\n\norigin population throughout a good portion of the nineteenth century to begin altering the island’s overall racial balance and profile. Miscegenation was common in most of the Spanish colonies, and Puerto Rico was no exception. The Spanish mixed with the indigenous Tainos and enslaved Africans, producing through the years new generations of mestizos and mulattos that constituted the island’s creole population.7 The African heritage is often referred to as “the third root” (CEREP 1992) in the cultural and racial profile of the Puerto Rican nation. This important component of the island’s heritage was essentially understated in the initial nineteenth-century historical narratives. These early attempts at documenting the history of an emerging Puerto Rican nation tended to give preponderance to the Spanish heritage over all others. Even after the 1873 abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico, the Spanish peninsular and creole elites were far from seeing blacks and mulattoes as equal; therefore racial prejudice was common, and through the years a handful of segregated communities developed on the island around some coastal areas and barrios of the larger cities. It is unquestionable that during the course of the nineteenth century Puerto Rico became more Africanized, both racially and culturally. But these changes were not readily acknowledged by the Europeanized intellectual and political elites, which, for the most part, did not consider the African heritage a significant component in their definitions of an emerging Puerto Rican nation. Nineteenth-century creole intellectuals were not totally oblivious to the traditional folklore and traditions of the racially mixed peasant population, which at the time represented the majority of the island’s inhabitants, but they conceptualized the Puerto Rican nation from a Hispanophilic perspective, one that regarded the white Spanish-European component as representative of the essence of the island’s creole culture. Besides the obvious black and mulatto racial influence upon a substantial portion of Puerto Rico’s population, indicators of the African heritage are quite evident in many of the island’s cultural expressions—music, dance, literature, the visual arts, typical foods, and local festivities. The famous annual carnivals of the municipalities of Loíza, Ponce, San Juan, and Guayama recreate the traditional display of vejigante customs8 and masks, as does Hatillo’s Festival de las Máscaras (Festival of the Masks). The Spanish language of Puerto Rico reflects the African linguistic roots in some of its vocabulary and in the names of places and people (Alvarez Nazario 1974). The syncretism that took place between Catholicism and African religious traditions can be seen in the practice of santería and espiritismo among some Puerto Ricans. Santería rituals and invocations to Changó, the powerful god of fire, thunder, and lightning; to Oshún, the goddess of love; Yemayá, the goddess of the moon and seas; and many other deities still provide an expedient way of dealing with negative influences or evil spirits, or of ameliorating the whole gamut of human physical and spiritual ailments (González-Wippler 1973). Regarding the religious prac-\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 17\n\nThe Colonial Experience\n\n17\n\ntices of espiritismo, some researchers have documented its practitioners’ therapeutic psychological functions (Rogler 1972, 1985). After the Spanish Conquest of the Indies, Puerto Rico remained an island with important connections to a continent or “mainland,” in this case the European continent and the mainland of Spain.9 Increased migration of Spaniards to other parts of the Americas when the scant gold deposits in Puerto Rico were exhausted meant that enslaved Africans eventually made up a growing part of the local labor force. Racial mixture and cultural hybridity between Tainos, Africans, and the Spanish form the core of Puerto Rico’s creole population. These three groups make up the basic racial and cultural profile of the Puerto Rican people, with the subsequent incorporation of new immigrant groups that came to the island at different times. For a long time Puerto Rican cultural nationalism tended to emphasize the superiority and dominance of the Spanish heritage, but since the final decades of the twentieth century, more attention has been given to the island’s African roots and to its connections with other Hispanic and non-Hispanic Caribbean nations. Anthropologist Sidney Mintz noted that “a search for Africa in the Caribbean is among other things, an exploration of the nature of cultural disguise” (1974, 25). Without question, this statement applies to Puerto Rico, a nation where racism historically has been “camouflaged” by the myth of a racially harmonious society devoid of racism (Blanco 1942). Because of that, it has been said that Puerto Ricans suffer from “the prejudice of having no prejudice” (Betances 1972, 1973). Puerto Ricans are not by any means immune to racial prejudice, but it is also fair to say that racial conflict has not manifested itself in modern or contemporary Puerto Rico in the same polarizing ways that it has in the United States or other countries torn by a deeply ingrained system of apartheid and a long history of racial tensions and violence. One of the main differences is that racial definitions and perceptions among Puerto Ricans are not largely determined by biological factors, as tends to be the case in the United States, where the racial optic is dominated by the notion that one drop of nonwhite blood makes someone a person of color. Among Latinos, racial perceptions are influenced by social status, multiple gradations of skin color, and other physical features (see Rodríguez 1974, 2000a). The popular expression mejorar la raza, meaning to improve the race by whitening it, also implies the degree of desirability and privilege attributed to being white, but there is a wider spectrum of physical and social factors embedded in the way Puerto Ricans and other Latinos perceive racial differences and racially define themselves. The growing number of Puerto Ricans born or raised in the United States, the exacerbated forms of racial prejudice and discrimination they encounter, and the continuous back and forth migration between the island and the metropolis contribute to an increased awareness of race and racism among island Puerto Ricans. Simultaneously, the presence of Puerto Ricans and other Latinos in US\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n18\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 18\n\nPuerto Ricans in the United States\n\nsociety is changing its dichotomized black and white constructions of race by introducing new perspectives grounded in the racially mixed profile of Latinos and that of other groups frequently lumped into the “people of color” category.10\n\nThe Strategic but Neglected Spanish Colony Despite its geographic strategic location as the “entrance and key to the Antilles,”11 for almost three centuries Puerto Rico remained a neglected part of the vast Spanish New World empire. More attention was given to the larger colonies that could supply the precious mineral wealth and raw materials to support Spain’s imperial hegemony, mercantile economy, and competition with other European powers. The larger colonies sustained the mercantile economy that helped finance the empire’s religious and military ventures. Until the latter decades of the eighteenth century, Puerto Rico was not heavily populated, and the Spanish government received subsidies from the Viceroyalty of New Spain in Mexico to administer the colony. The island’s creole population relied mostly on subsistence agriculture and contraband trade with neighboring non-Hispanic Caribbean islands to satisfy their basic needs (Morales-Carrión 1971). The population of Puerto Rico remained very small during the first three centuries of Spanish colonization; the stagnant population growth was reflected in the subsistence nature of most of Puerto Rico’s agricultural productivity. The initial neglect from Spanish authorities did not alter the importance of Puerto Rico’s geographic location. In Spain’s quest to hold on to its imperial glory, Puerto Rico was strategically important to counteract the growing commercial interests of the British, the French, and the Dutch in the Caribbean region. Competing European powers also recognized the island’s strategic value and attempted to take it away from Spain. Puerto Rico was subjected to unsuccessful attacks from the British in 1595 and 1598 and the Dutch in 1625. The threat of foreign invasion motivated the Spaniards to build imposing military fortifications on the island and on its other Caribbean colonies. San Juan, the center of colonial administration and site of the country’s major port, was eventually converted into a walled city. The fortifications surrounding the capital contributed to a sharp separation between the locus of colonial administration, where most of the peninsular population and the army resided, and a large portion of the sparse creole population, scattered throughout the island and mostly disconnected from the ruling authorities. As late as 1797, the British were, once again, fended off by the Spanish in another unsuccessful attempt to take over Puerto Rico. Life in the colonies began to change after the modernizing French Bourbon dynasty came to occupy the Spanish throne in the early eighteenth century.

In took until 1765 for any reforms to reach Puerto Rico. That year, the Spanish Crown sent Field Marshall Alejandro O’Reilly to assess the island’s socioeconomic conditions and potential for economic growth. O’Reilly’s visit led to the implementation of wide-ranging reforms. These included relaxing the monopolistic Spanish trade, discouraging contraband, and promoting European immigration to increase Puerto Rico’s population base. In the late 1700s and early 1800s, Puerto Rico was to witness a large influx of immigrants from Spain (primarily from the Balearic and Canary Islands and the provinces of Cataluña and Valencia), French Corsica, Germany, Italy, Holland, England, Scotland, and the United States. Most of these immigrants were attracted by land grants and other Spanish colonial government incentives given to individuals with enough capital to invest in agricultural development in different parts of the country (see Cifre de Loubriel 1975; Scarano 1981). Other immigrants, especially from Venezuela, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic, sought refuge in Puerto Rico in the early 1800s after the political turmoil generated by those colonies’ respective wars of independence. In addition to building Puerto Rico’s defenses, the Spanish colonial government actively encouraged commercial agriculture, focusing on sugar, coffee, and tobacco production. These products became the island’s main exports to Spain and would continue to be important in Puerto Rico’s agricultural economy until the mid-twentieth century. More substantial progress in Puerto Rico’s conditions did not occur until the Spanish metropolis introduced the Real Cédula de Gracias (Royal Decree of Concessions) of 1815. The Real Cédula de Gracias was aimed at further expanding commerce and economic activity. Concurrently, it brought about the implementation of additional reforms to create an environment more favorable for cultural and social development, and less inviting for revolutionary insurgency at a time when the spirit of revolution was engulfing most of the European colonies in the Americas. Among the most significant economic changes were the introduction of new industrial machinery and the opening of trade between Puerto Rico and the United States. This period of economic development was also supported by an increase in the importation of enslaved African labor. These factors contributed to a striking pattern of population growth that began in the late 1700s and continued into the 1800s. Puerto Rico’s population almost tripled, from only 44,883 inhabitants in 1765 to 129,758 in 1795. Another significant population increase took place after the reforms implemented by the Real Cédula de Gracias. The island’s population grew from 183,211 inhabitants in 1807; to 185,000 in 1812; 235,157 in 1824; 302,672 in 1828; and 443,000 by 1846 (Silvestrini and Luque de Sánchez 1988, 240; Scarano 1993, 412). The majority of the Spanish New World colonies secured their independence in the years between 1808 and 1824, but revolutionary activity in Puerto Rico was largely discouraged by the repressive policies and authoritarian rule\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n20\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 20\n\nPuerto Ricans in the United States\n\nof the Spanish Crown’s appointed governors. In 1809, Puerto Ricans were permitted for the first time to be represented in the Spanish Cortes, the main parliamentary body under the ruling monarchy, but this representation completely ceased in 1837 and was not to be restored until 1870. Political conditions in Spain had been in turmoil since the Napoleonic invasion of 1808, which had forced the Spanish people to take up arms against the French invaders and produced the liberal Cádiz Constitution of 1812. However, the return of King Ferdinand VII to the Spanish throne two years later nullified the progressive constitutional reforms, restored absolutist rule, and set the stage for a political confrontation between conservative supporters of the monarchy and liberals seeking representative government and the establishment of a Spanish republic. It was during this politically unstable period that there was an outbreak of wars of independence in the New World colonies and Spain lost most of its empire. Conditions in the Spanish metropolis deteriorated even further after the death of King Ferdinand VII in 1833. Serious divisions about the succession to the Spanish throne gave impetus to several wars (Guerras Carlistas) between conservative royalists and liberals, and these struggles dominated the metropolitan political landscape throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century. Left with only the colonies of Cuba and Puerto Rico, Spanish officials ruled them with an iron hand. For many decades it was common practice for the Spanish colonial government to force advocates of liberal reforms or independence into prison or exile. A few clandestine revolutionary cells operated in Puerto Rico, trying to keep alive the separatist struggle and advocating the abolition of slavery, but the lack of freedom of expression and other political rights did not provide the necessary environment inside the island to incite revolution. On September 23, 1868, Puerto Rico claimed its independence with the Grito de Lares armed revolt, but the insurrection was rapidly crushed by the Spanish army only a few days after it began. In contrast, the rebellion that started in Cuba with the Grito de Yara, only a couple of weeks after the Grito de Lares, signaled the beginning of the neighboring island’s Ten Years’ War of independence (1868–1878). The war in Cuba and the movement to liberate the two islands was sustained by the activities of Antillean political expatriates living in cities in Europe, the United States, or other Latin American countries. Mounting a revolution in Puerto Rico, however, was a daunting and dangerous endeavor. First, local political and social divisions did not facilitate the development of a strong and unified creole revolutionary movement that could incite the population to take up arms against the Spaniards. Second, the repressive practices of the Spanish colonial government curtailed all freedom of expression and civil liberties. Thus, while other Spanish colonies carried out wars of independence and became sovereign republics, Puerto Rico remained under Spanish control throughout the nineteenth century. This was also the\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 21\n\nThe Colonial Experience\n\n21\n\ncase with Cuba, although the Cubans were able to keep their armed resistance alive during two separate wars of independence, the already mentioned Ten Years’ War, and the Spanish-Cuban War that began with the Grito de Baire of 1895 and ended in 1898 with the US invasion of Cuba and Puerto Rico. By the 1860s, liberals in Spain had again gained some political ground against supporters of the monarchy, which translated into a more open political climate in the colonies. In 1870 for the first time, Puerto Rico was given the right to form its own political parties, and nongovernment newspapers began to appear (Pedreira [1941] 1969). The first Spanish Republic was finally created in 1873; this major political change in the metropolis contributed to the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico and Cuba that same year. The liberalizing political environment quickly came to an end with the restoration of the Spanish monarchy less than a year later and the gradual return to authoritarian rule for the colonies during the decades that followed. Political instability engulfed the Spanish metropolis as the remaining two island colonies continued to establish their claims for more civil liberties and control of their own affairs. The political conditions described herein made it more difficult for the Puerto Rican creole propertied class to fulfill its ruling-class aspirations, which in the case of other colonies, was a key factor in galvanizing their respective struggles to rid themselves of colonial rule and secure their independence. Puerto Rico’s creole propertied class was largely composed of hacienda owners involved in export mainly to Spain and the United States. By the mid1800s the United States had become the island’s main trade partner. The growing trade between Puerto Rico and the United States was mostly based on the exportation of sugar and, to a lesser degree, coffee, tobacco and other island agricultural products, and the importation of manufactured goods from an expanding North American economy seeking new foreign markets. The sugar industry boomed between 1815 and 1870, while coffee production began to replace it as the main export product during the decades between 1870 and 1900 (Quintero Rivera 1976a; Scarano 1993). The economic influence of the hacendados (hacienda owners) in this export-oriented agricultural economy, however, was severely limited by peninsular control of commerce and banking. Although the hacendados owned most of Puerto Rico’s land, control of commercial transportation and financing was in the hands of Spaniards, who had the support of the colonial administrative structures. Acute class, racial, and political divisions within Puerto Rican society additionally impeded the emergence of a cohesive creole bourgeoisie and of a revolutionary consciousness capable of nourishing any claims for independence or of challenging the control of the ruling peninsular elites (see Quintero Rivera 1988; Picó 1990). The influx of new immigrant entrepreneurs in the late 1700s and early 1800s has been considered another obstacle to the development of a strong creole bourgeoisie. In the first place, this population did not have strong nationalist loyalties toward Puerto Rico. Second, the new immigrant investors\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n22\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 22\n\nPuerto Ricans in the United States\n\nand proprietors began to erode the already limited economic power of the creole propertied class. Immigrant newcomers gained more access than creoles to certain sectors of Puerto Rico’s economy, such as banking and financing, and even came to dominate the economic activity of certain regions of the islands. Together these factors contributed to thwarting the development of a strong creole national consciousness in nineteenth-century Puerto Rico. The growth of the economic relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States during the course of the nineteenth century was another factor in shaping the propertied class’s political views regarding the future of the island. It has been argued that the expanding commercial relationship between the two countries introduced Puerto Rico’s propertied class to the “bourgeois” values of their North American neighbors and fueled aspirations among some members of this class for a possible future annexation of the island to the United States. According to Quintero Rivera (1976a): El sueño dorado de los terratenientes puertorriqueños respecto a la expansión comercial era el acceso al amplio mercado norteamericano. Era así, no sólo entre aquellos cuya producción comercial era fundamentalmente la caña de azúcar, cuyo principal campo de exportación eran los Estados Unidos aún dentro del patrón comercial del momento, sino también entre los productores de café, que añoraban penetrar ese mercado, el mayor para café en el mundo. La evidencia tiende a demostrar que buena parte de la lucha anti-española en el siglo xix conllevaba la aspiración de una futura anexión a los Estados Unidos. (25) [The golden dream of Puerto Rican landowners regarding commercial expansion was access to the expansive North American market. That was the case not only for those whose commercial production was fundamentally based on sugar, a product that at the time found its main export market in the United States, but also among coffee producers yearning to penetrate that market. The evidence tends to demonstrate that a considerable part of the nineteenth-century anti-Spanish struggle involved a desire for a future annexation to the United States.]\n\nThere is no doubt that the expanding commercial connections between Puerto Rico and the United States opened the doors for a large number of businessmen, professionals, skilled and semiskilled artisans, students, white-collar workers, and their families to come to the metropolis (Haslip-Viera 1996). Another important factor to consider is that during this initial period of contact between Puerto Rico and the United States, the prevailing view of the North American nation in the hemisphere was that of a republic firmly grounded on democratic principles and a successful free enterprise system. The United States was regarded as a model of the kind of democracy and progress that the former colonies in the Americas envisioned for their own countries after securing their independence. The intellectual and political elites and the entrepreneurial sector of the emerging Latin American nations were particularly\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 23\n\nThe Colonial Experience\n\n23\n\ndrawn to the United States. The perception of a threat of North American imperialism did not really enter the Latin American discourse until the latter decades of the nineteenth century. North American democracy contrasted with the more repressive environment that was found again in the Puerto Rico of the late 1880s during the infamous administration of Spanish Governor Romualdo Palacio. Reacting to the growing support for political autonomy among island creoles and to a series of boycotts they organized against the businesses of peninsular merchants, the colonial government decided to crack down on any challenges to their authority or the interests of the Spanish ruling class. The abuses of Governor Palacio’s administration during the year 1887 came to be known as the régimen del componte (the “behave yourself” regime). Most of the prior modest gains that had been achieved in civil liberties, especially freedom of expression, were suspended. Nongovernment newspapers were closed, illegal searches became routine, and prominent liberal political leaders were arrested. The return to these despotic measures limited the political options of Puerto Rico’s creole propertied class. Even with the more liberal environment found again in the 1890s, the unpredictable and unstable nature of the political situation in Spain, along with the authoritarian rule practiced by most colonial governors, forced creole political leaders to seek a moderate course of action for getting political concessions from the Spanish metropolis. Creole leaders chose to fight for reforms that would eventually allow the island to achieve a considerable degree of self-rule without a total separation from Spain. The Partido Liberal Reformista (Liberal Reformist Party) had represented creole reform aspirations since its founding in 1870. Frustrations with the unpredictable and limited nature of Spanish colonial reforms eventually moved liberal creoles to claim political autonomy rather than independence. Under the leadership of Román Baldorioty de Castro, in 1887 the Liberal Reformist Party was replaced by the Partido Autonomista Puertorriqueño (Puerto Rican Autonomist Party). The new political entity sought a larger degree of administrative and economic decentralization with respect to the Spanish metropolis. Two years later, after Baldorioty’s death, the reins of the Autonomist Party were taken over by Luis Muñoz Rivera, a prominent creole politician and journalist of the propertied class. Puerto Rico’s Autonomists made a pact with Spain’s Liberal Party members to merge with them, if they managed to win control of the metropolitan government. In exchange, Spanish liberals promised to grant political autonomy to the island. When the Liberal Party came to power in Spain in 1897, a Charter of Autonomy was finally granted to Puerto Rico. This new government endowed Puerto Rican creoles with the right to elect a governing cabinet and enjoy the political autonomy experienced by other Spanish provinces. The Autonomist Cabinet, headed by Muñoz Rivera, included prominent members of the creole propertied class and its political and intellectual elites. Autonomy was a welcome experiment in self-government for Puerto\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n24\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 24\n\nPuerto Ricans in the United States\n\nRico, but also short-lived. The new government lasted less than a year; it came to an end with the US invasion of 1898. The US takeover freed Puerto Rico from Spanish rule, but it also ended the brief autonomous government and marked the beginning of a new but also restrictive colonial relationship for the island. The creole propertied class’s economic dependence on the United States and admiration of its achievements were major factors in this class’s initial welcoming response to the arrival of the invading North American troops. The creole propertied class did not anticipate, however, that the new regime would open the doors so quickly to US investors, weakening the position of both Puerto Rico’s landowning class and peninsular businessmen. US companies not only took control of Puerto Rico’s economic production in a very short period of time but also shifted its focus. Most of the new North American capital was invested in the establishment of more modern and larger sugar mills, or centrales, numerous cigar factories, and needle industries. Control of shipping, the setting of trade tariffs, and replacing the Spanish national currency with the dollar were some of the immediate changes introduced by the new colonial rulers that mostly benefited North American investors. At the time of the US invasion, agricultural production in the haciendas was dominated by coffee crops. With the new focus on sugar production and the control of the land in the hands of North American corporations, the local haciendas entered a stage of decline, being rapidly replaced by sugar as the main export product. The local hacendados’ economic decline was accelerated by a reduction in the demand for coffee exports and a drop in the price of this product in the international market. The effects of hurricane San Ciriaco in 1899, which destroyed most of that year’s coffee crop, only worsened the economic predicament of the hacendado class. It was clear once again that Puerto Rico’s economy was to serve the interests of a new colonial metropolis at the expense of its national interests and those of its creole propertied class.\n\nNotes 1. When Columbus first arrived at the New World islands in 1492, he believed he had reached parts of Asia or the Orient, then known as the Indies. Thus the term “Indies” has been used since Columbus’s first voyage. Later on, the word “West” was added to the name to differentiate the New World islands from those of East Asia. The name “Antilles” also was used early in the colonial period to refer to the islands. The name was taken from the classical myth of the lost cities of Antillia. 2. Rouse argued that many of the islands in the Caribbean were settled by 5000 B.C. (1986, 108). The direction of the migratory flow, from a northwesterly direction from the Lesser Antilles to the Greater Antilles, was dictated by the movement of the ocean currents.\n\n02_Chap02.qxd\n\n3/20/06\n\n3:32 PM\n\nPage 25\n\nThe Colonial Experience\n\n25\n\n3.

Nineteenth-century authors such as Alejandro Tapia y Rivera and Cayetano Coll y Toste frequently incorporated indigenous legends, myths, and historical events into their writings. For a compilation of these legends, see Cayetano Coll y Toste, Leyendas y tradiciones puertorriqueñas (Río Piedras, PR: Editorial Cultural, 1975). Alejandro Tapia y Rivera’s legend La palma del cacique, his poem “El último borincano,” and his opera script Guarionex all deal with indigenous themes. See Alejandro Tapia y Rivera, Obras completas (San Juan: Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña, 1968). 5. In Art and Mythology of the Taino Indians of the Greater West Indies (San Juan: Ediciones El Cemí, 1972), anthropologist Eugenio Fernández Méndez argued that Yocahú and Huracán might have been the same god. Sued-Badillo (1979, 25–26), however, believed that Huracán referred to the terrible storms and winds unleashed by the earth mother Guabancex as punishment for some violations of social norms. 6. The most complete analysis of different aspects of the Taino revival movement can be found in Gabriel Haslip-Viera, ed., Taino Revival: Critical Perspectives on Puerto Rican Identity and Cultural Politics (New York: Centro de Estudios Puertorriqueños, 1999). 7. The term “mestizo” has been used since the early years of the Spanish colonial period to refer to the racial mixture between white European and Indian. The term “mulatto” refers to the mixture between white European and African. 8. Vejigantes are the devilish masks used in Puerto Rican carnivals. The characters they represent often carry vejigas or filled animal bladders to strike anyone who bothers them. 9. The notions of island and mainland are curious, yet important. An island can be viewed as simply an extension of a larger continent that is divided by water. Yet islands are themselves peaks of larger land masses. While the geographical relationship between island and mainland can be fairly straightforward, it is the conception of the relationship on cultural, political, social, and economic grounds that is more relevant in terms of the colony-metropolis connection. 10. The label “people of color” is used mostly in the United States to refer to nonwhite or racially mixed populations or the populations of the Third World. This term is strongly contested, since, for instance, some Latinos are white, black, or racially mixed. 11. The island’s Spanish Governor Fernando de Lando described Puerto Rico as the “entrance and key to the Antilles” in a 1534 letter to Emperor Charles V (King Charles I of Spain).

It has served as the crossroads between the North and the South American continents, between old and new worlds, between memory and opportunity, and between native and newcomer. Puerto Ricans have always represented the emerging newness that arises from the blending and the synergy that occurs at a crossroads. This blending can be racial, a mixture of Amerindian, African, and Spanish. It is expressed in language, culture, religion, and civil society in the ways some Puerto Ricans “code switch” (switch languages) between Spanish and English and oscillate between the traditions, styles, and values of Puerto Rico and those of the United States. Political life is also part of this crossroads, as reflected by the back and forth swing of electoral mandates between the party that favors the current Commonwealth status and the proponents of statehood, and by the inability to reach a"
