        "text": "The Handbook of Critical Literacies aims to answer the timely question: what are the social responsibilities of critical literacy academics, researchers, and teachers in today’s world? Critical literacies are classically understood as ways to interrogate texts and contexts to address injustices and they are an essential literacy practice. Organized into thematic and regional sections, this handbook provides substantive definitions of critical literacies across fields and geographies, surveys of critical literacy work in over 23 countries and regions, and overviews of research, practice, and conceptual connections to established and emerging theoretical frameworks. The chapters on global critical literacy practices include research on language acquisition, the teaching of literature and English language arts, Youth Participatory Action Research, environmental justice movements, and more. This pivotal handbook enables new and established researchers to position their studies within highly relevant directions in the field and engage, organize, disrupt, and build as we work for more sustainable social and material relations. A groundbreaking text, this handbook is a definitive resource and an essential companion for students, researchers, and scholars in the field.

As the chapters suggest, this question is at the forefront of our minds. We five editors—living in Australia, Colombia, Singapore and the United States when we began our collaboration—met because of our ability as global academics to travel and present our research. Out of ongoing dialogues, we began the Transnational Critical Literacy Network (TCLN), aiming to bring researchers together from around the world to share perspectives and forge new alliances. At first, this consisted of inviting colleagues near and far to join the venture via a Google Docs (https://docs.google.com/document/d/19PK5Fz6I4x8u2CZMW6zQEIWLWjzi5rXzaeLNZf6Yuk/edit?usp=sharing). As the network grew in numbers and ideas, we began drafting a joint paper (with the entire network of over 100 scholars) as well as thinking of other shared projects. The Network now has over 140 members from about 20 countries including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, England, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Mexico, Palestine, New Zealand, Norway, Puerto Rico, Saudi Arabia, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Uganda, and the United States. Members are preservice teachers, classroom teachers, graduate students, new professors, and more established as well as emeritus professors. As members shared the occasional conference call, journal call, or began asking for potential research collaborators, we began to conceive of this project. The five of us decided on a handbook of critical literacies, an undertaking done both in homage to our own critical literacy mentors— Barbara Comber, Hilary Janks, Allan Luke, and Vivian Maria Vasquez—and in a deliberate attempt to broaden and diversify the scholars who might find intellectual homes under a revitalized critical literacy umbrella. We have called it the Handbook of Critical Literacies. When we put the invitation to help craft the handbook proposal to the Network/TCLN, we hoped to interest the members and garner potential authors; we generated an incredible amount of supportive and honest commentary that led directly to this book. Those who spoke against participating in a handbook project had different kinds of objections. They said that handbooks privilege those who can afford to access or buy them; handbooks are expensive and our aim in the future is to transform the chapters into more accessible and affordable platforms. Some members also said that handbook chapters mattered less in their retention, tenure, and promotion processes. This is changing in a lot of contexts as the value of various forms of publishing is accepted, but we acknowledge that this practice is often tied to privilege where those who are already well published and promoted can afford to deviate from the norm.\n\nx\n\nPreface\n\nHowever, for us, the book itself is a space like no other, and after weighing the pros and cons, we decided to proceed with the handbook as a way of bringing a host of experienced and emerging scholars together on a single, defining collaborative, generative project, one that would help emerging scholars gain recognition for their work. It is our hope that the handbook will also see critical literacy claim an important territory with a well-recognized publisher. We asked those who did want to participate—despite the real issues we’ve just discussed—to go far out of their comfort zones. We set up a Google Doc for chapter ideas we had, invited more ideas, and kept refining it until we felt we had a workable structure. This included a section of the handbook on established critical literacy traditions, which we originally referred to as the section on critical literacy over time; one on the different traditions and epistemological variations of critical literacy around the world; and a third area that asked authors to push the boundaries of critical literacy further out and further into the future. We took a partial table of contents, made another Google Docs, and asked network members to sign up for any and all chapters they wanted to work with/in/on. We tried to make every single chapter (all 50 of them) jointly authored so that no one person would be the sole voice of authority on a given topic, country, region, or emerging idea. We asked people to find authors who brought different perspectives than their own on the same problem, to find younger or older scholars, people from other countries, institutions, language backgrounds. If authors wanted help finding a coauthor, we helped; we also turned to the larger Network to ask for additional authors, ideas, and leads. We discussed the project with our mentors and asked their guidance about structure and content. We mention these linkages and these complicated flows to highlight that this really has been a group project, if not a collective one. None of us five editors feels we are qualified, capable, or arrogant enough to define critical literacy on our own, much less decide what topics should be included and what should not. We had to do it together, and together we have done it! From all of us to you, our readers, welcome to the conversation, welcome to the Network! Jessica Zacher Pandya, Raúl Alberto Mora, Jennifer Helen Alford, Noah Asher Golden, and Roberto Santiago de Roock\n\nxi\n\nINTRODUCTION TO AREA 1 Jessica Zacher Pandya\n\nIn Area 1, authors—delve into the antecedents and current configurations of critical literacy work. The area begins with the editors’ introduction (Chapter 1), which outlines the history of this collection and lays out some of our editorial hopes, fears, and dreams. Lina Trigos-Carrillo, Rebecca Rogers, and Miriam Jorge begin their exegesis of the global histories and antecedents of critical literacy in Chapter 2 with autobiographical poems that invite their readers to think creatively and with emotion about these deeply theoretical constructs. Like many chapters, this one ends with questions to push our own work in this field further, but authors also ask us to consider how we contribute to inequalities in the publishing and grant writing industries, perhaps at the cost of doing our own social justice work. In Chapter 3, Rohit Mehta, Csilla Weninger, and David MartínezPrieto methodically lay out connections between neoliberalism, ethnonationalism, and transnationalism, arguing that critical literacies are the antithesis of neoliberal literacies. They ask us to examine the impact of neoliberalism on literacy education, especially as it influences transnational flows of people, ideas, and literacy practices in online and in person spaces. Four chapters in this area take up issues of pedagogy and teaching directly. The first of these is Chapter 4, in which Chris K. Chang-Bacon, Nihal Khote, Robin Schell, and Graham V. Crookes take up the relationship between English language teaching (ELT) and critical literacies. They ask readers to consider two purposes for criticality in ELT, a pedagogical one to promote critical engagement with texts and lifeworlds in language classrooms and a larger one about English itself. They interrogate the global nature of English language teaching and ask us to ask: Why English? And, whose English? Betina Hsieh and Susan Cridland-Hughes describe the evolution of critical literacy work in teacher education and in K–12 classrooms in Chapter 6, discussing dispositions of teachers and teacher educators, then moving on to examples of critical literacy in practice. They ask us to reflect on the roles of our local school districts and partners, as well as teacher education programs, in making critical literacy practices not only sustainable but also more central to language arts education. Chapter 8 focuses our attention on queer critical literacies. Navan Govender and Grant Andrews draw on a dense body of past work to offer a pedagogical tool: a framework for queering and queer critical literacy. In Chapter 9, Anwar Ahmed and Saskia Van Viegen address the rich history of the relationship between writing and critical literacy. They argue that creating and maintaining a critical writing pedagogy can further critical literacy and move us toward equity and justice in classrooms around the world.\n\n1\n\nDOI: 10.4324/9781003023425-1\n\nJessica Zacher Pandya\n\nAnother three chapters focus on youth experiences of and with critical literacy. In Chapter 5, Robert Petrone, Nicole Mirra, Steve Goodman, and Antero Garcia outline the intersections of critical literacy work, youth activism, and civic participation. They define key terms, offer citations of landmark and more recent YPAR-related work, and ask us to question the boundaries and benefits of YPAR for youth and their communities. Chapter 7 describes past and present work in critical literacies from an embodiment perspective, considering the ways children’s and youth’s bodies as social texts are written and performed. Elisabeth Johnson, Grace Enriquez, and Stavroula Kontovourki review work on children remaking selves, engaging critically in their social worlds, and press readers to remember how much bodies and representations still matter in an increasingly post-humanist world. The last chapter in Area 1, Chapter 10, reviews work at the nexus of critical literacies and critical media production or critical media literacies. Olivia G. Stewart, Cassandra Scharber, Jeff Share, and Anne Crampton argue that as academics we need to continually teach criticality in media spaces and suggest that academics must do this as they create their own media and as they create spaces for children and youth to critically create and consume media.\n\n2\n\n1.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE HANDBOOK OF CRITICAL LITERACIES The Current State of Critical Literacy Around the World Jessica Zacher Pandya, Raúl Alberto Mora, Jennifer Helen Alford, Noah Asher Golden, and Roberto Santiago de Roock This is an expansive handbook on the past, present, and future of critical literacies on a transnational scale. Critical literacies, as they are classically conceived, offer people ways of interrogating texts and contexts and of writing and rewriting texts and realities to address injustices. They are, or ought to be, a key skill in any literate individual’s repertoire of literacy practices (cf. Comber & Simpson, 2001; Janks, 2010; Luke, 2014; Vasquez, 2005). We define them in this Handbook as literate practices individuals need in order to survive and thrive in the world, foregrounding the concept that information and texts are never neutral; they afford the ability to produce powerful texts that address injustices in our lived worlds. This formulation is sometimes known by other names in the Global South, particularly in Latin America and Africa. As chapters in Area 2 of the Handbook will show, it can be seen in research on language acquisition, the teaching of literature and English language arts, Youth Participatory Action Research, environmental justice movements, and more. As the notion of “critical” has become increasingly commonplace, we as editors fear that, without reflexivity, the term has sometimes become too diluted or misconstrued to mean much at all, especially as terms like “critical thinking” become part of the neoliberal educational vocabulary. We are also concerned that the deeply contextualized meanings of critical literacy in different places and spaces around the globe may be lost even before coming to light. In the Handbook, we intentionally draw on multiple critical epistemologies, including European, Black, and Indigenous thinkers from the Global South and the Global North. At a time when post-truth paradigms influence the ways education is understood and enacted, and misinformation and disinformation increasingly shape unfolding events and evolving structures of power, critical literacies feel more relevant and crucial than ever. Transnational issues of literacy are central to the resurgence of authoritarian forces and thus critical approaches have never been more important. As we write, we are experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, whose ravages highlight the very inequalities and power arrangements that critical literacies research highlights. The pandemic’s death toll is exacerbated by years of intensifying ethno-racialized notions of citizenship and nationhood across the world, which some among us see as resurgent fascisms. This has included strong anti-science discourses and right-wing populist support, all based on broad-based consumption of misinformation and disinformation (often called “fake news”) spurred on by the architecture of and people’s use of social media. Additionally, existential threats due to climate genocide and nuclear proliferation 3\n\nDOI: 10.4324/9781003023425-2\n\nJessica Zacher Pandya et al.\n\nare increasingly pressing, with significant repercussions for our biosocial and material worlds. Within education, we are also seeing increasingly narrow conceptualizations of literacy serving the interests of standardization, measurability, and accountability (Pandya, 2011) and a concomitant rise of edubusinesses that profit from literacy education. At the same time, the nature of texts and textual flows are rapidly transforming via media manipulation and the algorithms underlying digital platforms, altering the ways humans and nonhumans interact, produce, and consume knowledge, experience text(s), and experience racism (Benjamin, 2019; de Roock, 2021). If not for the everyday and collective resistance that is ongoing and necessary, such as the Black Lives Matter uprisings of 2020, or the recent protests taking place across Latin America or Asia, to name two regions, for the past two years, it would be easy to feel that critical literacies educators are losing the battle. In response to this complex confluence of change driving humanity toward homogenization in the name of control and profit, this Handbook provides a heterogeneity of current interpretations and applications of critical literacy by scholars from across the globe. We seek to demonstrate the diversity of uptake within critical literacy research communities; to strengthen our critical literacies praxis and international collaborations; and to present a stronger collective and heteroglossic front. We see a strong need for collaborations across borders and foresee the generative possibilities of such collaborations. As oppressive discourses, institutions, and forces are increasingly transnational, and as socioeconomic injustices grow and inequities widen, research and organizing that responds to oppression must also grow and diversify. We purposefully use the term “transnational” to signal our own perspectives on our places in the world and our own lived realities. Transnationalism as a term “came into existence at that moment in time when successful nation-state building ‘contributed to the creation of large numbers of people’ out of place-—that is, crossing over the national boundaries erected in the last two centuries” (Roudometof, 2005, p. 119). Attention has shifted “from state and macro-actors to the micro-level of globalization and to civil society movements” (Duscha, Klein-Zimmer, Klemm, & Spiegel, 2018, p. 3) creating opportunities for refocusing the loci of voice and power. The Handbook is an attempt to capture disparate voices about critical literacy as a kind of collective civil movement. This Handbook grew out of the Transnational Critical Literacies Network (TCLN), which was named to reflect our senses of being transnational academics and teachers, both in and out of place, and our awareness that our positionings allow us to decenter our own ways of knowing. As part of this commitment, we sought to highlight what counts as critical literacy work in diverse sociocultural contexts to counter the often-Eurocentric foundations of its academic lineage. In each of the chapters that follows, regardless of topic, area, or theme, we have asked authors to write about their social responsibilities as critical literacy researchers in this world. We decided early on that ideally no one person should write a chapter on their own, and that no one could write more than one. In the end, only three chapters are single-authored. Some authors knew each other before they began writing, while others were total strangers, connected through the TCLN and through their desire to write about this work. We took this approach to diversify the voices in these pages and to ensure that we had authors engaged in dialogue as they wrote. We have all reached far beyond our comfort zones to ask each other uncomfortable questions about whose voices should structure each section and how we should make decisions about inclusion and exclusion. One of our major preoccupations has been the languages we would use in this Handbook. We were not allowed to publish chapters in two languages—such as the authors’ preferred language and English—but as readers will see as they read the Handbook, we succeeded in arguing that many varieties of English were welcome. Readers will also encounter a wide variety within the structures we created; some authors chose to focus more on their home or adopted countries in a chapter on a geographic region, and some authors chose to focus on emerging instead of canonical work. Additionally, we have not required certain terms or acronyms (e.g., readers will see both “multilingual learner” and “emergent bilingual” in use in different places). The variation readers will encounter is intentional and reflects our vision for this Handbook as a space for diversity of experimentation, change, and intellectual rigor. 4\n\nIntro to Handbook of Critical Literacies\n\nForm and Structure of the Handbook As we hinted in the Preface, the Handbook is laid out in three Areas, allowing us to engage in three related projects mirrored in its areas: the antecedents and current state of critical literacies in Area 1; a global survey of critical literacy in praxis, examining work in 23 countries and geographical regions in Area 2; and finally, the chapters in Area 3 highlighting work that has pushed and continues to push the boundaries of critical literacies. We describe below some of the key concepts, theoretical frameworks, and areas of research in the three areas.\n\nArea 1: Critical Literacies Over Time: Antecedents and Current Configurations The first area addresses substantive definitions of critical literacies across fields and geographies, including historical surveys and deep theoretical dives. We have conceived of this first area as one about time; chapters describe and summarize critical literacy research over time in its different guises and subfields. Chapters also tackle critiques of critical literacy and questions about how it can be of use in neoliberal contexts and spaces. The authors of Chapter 1.2 experiment with the form and structure of the Handbook chapter. They begin by delving into critical literacy in action in three separate contexts, from the educational practices of a community of former guerilla members, through a “pedagogy of the earth” course in Brazil, to a U.S. grassroots teacher activist network. They trace connections between popular education—as Freire and others have described and enacted it—and our more current conceptions of critical literacies. What those authors do in poetry and prose, subsequent chapter authors take up more forthrightly, offering definitions of neoliberalism and ethnonationalism; English language teaching, bi/multilingualism, and translanguaging; youth, participatory, action, and research (as “YPAR”); embodiment, the disciplined body, the body as social text, the feeling/sensing body, the intra/acting body, and embodied literacies; identities, heteronormativity, practices of queering, and queering critical literacy; and critical media consumption and production. The authors in Area 1 draw on a wide range of historical and current theoretical framings, as befits the wide scope of the Handbook. Readers will engage with sociocultural, poststructuralist, and post-humanist approaches. They will be reminded of the contributions of systemic functional linguistics and critical discourse analysis and be asked to take up queer perspectives on literacies, writing, and the world. Multiliteracies, participatory culture, and connected learning are also referenced in these chapters. Reading across the chapters is a reminder of how we as researchers and teacher educators draw on widely different traditions and theories to make sense of the critical literacies in which we engage to make sense of our worlds. We asked authors to undertake reviews of and implications for research in their separate chapters. Reading across them shows the impact of neoliberal policies on literacy education, illuminating how such policies shape and exclude on a transnational scale (Chapter 1.3). It also shows us how children and youth can engage in critical literacies at all language levels, emphasizing the relevance of critical literacies to the lived realities of multilingual students (Chapter 1.4); we are reminded that critical literacy practices in the ELT classroom can facilitate language proficiency, motivation, and engagement, whether or not that is the original goal. Teachers are at the center of some chapters, where we see how teacher preparation contexts can be inimical to, or can foster, the uptake of critical literacy practices by teachers in preservice classes and their own classrooms (Chapter 1.6), and how teachers’ work facilitates critical literacies for English learners (Chapter 1.4). We are reminded of the ways Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) privileges youth identities, epistemologies, and literacy practices, and of how YPAR challenges formal classroom learning methods and practices, as well as how it may transform the ways teachers are educated 5\n\nJessica Zacher Pandya et al.\n\n(Chapter 1.5). These challenges are reiterated and viewed through the lens of embodiment in Chapter 1.7, where adult objectives for literacy learning are interrogated alongside youth’s own perspectives and goals, and where authors see critical engagement in the exploration of youth’s embodied literacy practice. We see how queering critical literacy entails the questioning of the representation of queer peoples’ experiences, as well as questioning how we police (a)gender and (a)sexuality through our literacy practices (Chapter 1.8). We are asked to consider the role of writing in critical literacy education (Chapter 1.9). We are introduced to competing, overlapping, and contradictory approaches to media literacy, from critical digital literacies to critical computational literacies to pedagogies of invention (Chapter 1.10).\n\nArea 2: Critical Literacies Across Space: A Global Survey of Critical Literacy Praxis The second area addresses the question: What does critical literacy pedagogy look and sound like around the world? We conceived of this area as a collection of critical literacies praxis across space. We brought together surveys of critical literacy work that cover all continents, blending research on long-standing and recognized traditions together with research in regions with emergent or less recognized traditions. We were specifically interested in exploring what it means to engage in transnational critical literacy work (both country- and region-specific), especially teasing out the tensions involved in indexing these global concepts and theories in local contexts. Contributions contest any monolithic sense of critical literacy, pushing for a more expansive and transnational critical literacy project. We were invested in highlighting countries or regions typically left out of discussions on critical literacy pedagogy, ultimately including both country- and region-specific surveys. The hope was to have all regions covered in some way. However, many regions are missing, not because there is not work being done there but due to a combination of limitations in our networks and lack of time for those we invited (especially given the COVID-19 pandemic). The term “critical literacy” also is far from universal, and even when similar work is being done, it more often than not goes by different names. The scope and organization of this area was far from straightforward, especially given our commitment to remain sensitive to the histories, politics, and tensions embodied in geographical divisions. The process illustrates the ways textual practices are always political. Puerto Rico, for example, is a colony of the United States rather than an independent country, but we have chosen to list it with countries. Similarly, there was a question of whether Hong Kong should have its own chapter or be grouped with Taiwan, Macao, and Tibet under a greater China chapter. There was debate about how to approach the Caribbean, especially given the ways languages at play (Spanish, French, English, Dutch) come with distinct histories, flows, and debates. In the end, these chapters (Chapters 2.11, 2.17, and 2.18) coalesced through conversations with the authors, who were best positioned to stake claims, especially given what they felt capable and qualified to write about. We remain aware, however, that these are clearly political decisions, and that not all readers will be happy with them. The configuration of the chapter authors was a broad palette. Some of the chapters included research teams that are working together to create a research body or make sense of it all within one institution (Australia [Chapter 2.2], Brazil [Chapter 2.3], Canada [Chapter 2.4], Colombia [Chapter 2.5], Indonesia [Chapter 2.7], Norway and France [Chapter 2.20], Russia [Chapter 2.12], Singapore [Chapter 2.13]) or across different institutions (Aotearoa New Zealand [Chapter 2.1], Mexico [Chapter 2.10], Nordic Countries [Chapter 2.19], South Africa [Chapter 2.14], United Kingdom [Chapter 2.15], United States [Chapter 2.16]). Some chapters mixed scholars situated both in the Global South and North, joined by a common topic (e.g., India [Chapter 2.6], Iran 6\n\nIntro to Handbook of Critical Literacies\n\n[Chapter 2.8], Japan [Chapter 2.9], Puerto Rico [Chapter 2.11], South Asia [Chapter 2.21]). Some chapters bookended years of collaborative work, some chapters encompassed budding partnerships, and sometimes, serendipity brought the authors together (e.g., Uganda and Congo [Chapter 2.22]). Some of the driving questions for the chapters in this section include: What forces are driving definitions and redefinitions of critical literacy? How is it thought about in different spaces? What local and global historical factors are reshaping definitions? What are the barriers to enacting critical literacy pedagogy in these countries? We suggested structuring chapters into six sections to identify major issues surrounding critical literacy on a global scale: (i.) An overview of the geographical space in its sociopolitical contexts; (ii.) An overview of the geographical space’s educational system(s); (iii.) A survey of critical literacy work (including theory and pedagogy) by researchers and practitioners in the country, with some comparison to international work and lineage; (iv.) Visions for moving into more transnational and critical work from the perspective of that country; (v.) Conclusions/findings/suggestions for further research and practice; and (vi.) Implications for our social responsibility as academics. This transnational work is ongoing, partial, and incomplete; we see it as a push for the field to both recognize and work for the expansion of critical literacies praxis. Covering every country or even region was a nearly impossible task and therefore this Handbook is not, in that sense, comprehensive. We see it as a conversation starter for our authors, readers, and the field. It represents an opening to look at emerging issues not only in these countries, but also on every continent. Whether addressing their country or region, contributing authors, made efforts to situate the conversations in their chapters as part of ongoing regional or continental issues that deserve more attention in years to come.\n\nArea 3: Pushing the Boundaries: Critical Literacies in Motion In the third area, authors set up a spirited agenda for critical literacies, pushing current boundaries with explicit calls to action for practitioners and researchers around extant and future critical literacy projects. The goal is to showcase critical literacy in motion. Chapters capture moving versions of critical literacies practice or invitations to connect critical literacy with emerging or under-explored bodies of thought and practice. Each chapter presents work that forges new territory in the field, reporting on varied contexts with a range of far-reaching implications. The projects they explore highlight the ongoing importance of the critical, as well as the unique and at times challenging directions in which contemporary practitioners and researchers are taking this work. This section is a collection of bold calls to continue the evolving relevance of critical literacy to today’s complex education agenda and the broader social, cultural, political, economic, and material life in which we are always enmeshed. We asked authors in Area 3 to invite us into their subfields by defining key concepts and acknowledging and contending with critiques of critical literacies in their domains. As for Areas 1 and 2, we wanted to know the implications of these approaches for our pedagogies, ongoing scholarship, and, perhaps most importantly, for our social responsibility as academics. The agenda that emerges from these chapters invites us to reflect on the limitations of past work in critical literacies as we forge new possibilities, and this rich agenda offers no single approach as we work to respond to conditions shaped by transnational and translocal concerns. The issues engaged through these critical literacy practices in motion are varied and many: chapter authors in Area 3 take up systems of domination grounded in anti-Blackness and other forms of racism; the unfolding climate crisis; the impacts of datafication; social hierarchies produced through deeply problematic exchanges and readings of linguistic capital; the unfurling loss of Indigenous languages; misrecognitions of people; deficit framings of identities; rising nationalisms and xenophobia; and textual practices that limit 7\n\nJessica Zacher Pandya et al.\n\nour ability to form imaginaries that may engender possibilities for new social and material relations. These are indeed weighty concerns. Critical literacy scholars have long resisted the notion of any single approach or methodology that could fix whatever might be seen in a given moment as the “literacy problem” a society or community is facing, recognizing decades ago that: [l]iteracy refers to a malleable set of cultural practices shaped and reshaped by different— often competing and contending—social institutions, social classes, and cultural interests . . . how and when literacy became a problem had as much to do with economic, cultural, and social change as it did with anything that might go on in schools and classrooms. (Luke & Freebody, 1999, p. 2) The more important question is what literacies can do to help create sites of possibility and transformation in the economic, cultural, and sociopolitical flows that delineate current affordances and limitations—flows that are increasingly transnational. Just as there is no single approach to fix a “literacy problem” in formal education, there is no one critical approach to textual analysis or multimodal production that has a monopoly on possible interruptions of the contemporary and futureoriented weighty concerns taken up in this area. Thankfully, the spirited agenda in Area 3: Critical Literacies in Motion offers multiple approaches to the enactment of critical literacies, all directed toward these contemporary and ongoing issues. These approaches include analysis of contemporary literatures to question and make sense of “the sociopolitical systems through which we live our lives” (Chapter 3.1) and the impact of our choices for textual analysis (Chapter 3.3). These approaches also include multimodal arts-based methods to access emotions and rich imaginaries (Chapter 3.2). Readers are invited to pay attention to emergent situated discourse in classrooms to cocreate moments of critical analysis (Chapter 3.13), and encouraged to view the decentering White and hegemonic gazes as a process as we engage in dialogue and activism in youth-led spaces (Chapter 3.14). Chapter authors detail approaches to navigating the beneath-the-screen, less visible software space and datafication to help people better understand new cultural and commercial relations (Chapter 3.5) and explore how everyday relations are shaped by digital media and technologies, positing ways critical digital literacies can broaden understandings of how language, literacy, and power are mediated in these contemporary digital ecologies (Chapter 3.8). Authors argue for the limitations of current frameworks as they entice readers to embrace posthuman and new materialist methodologies in an effort to encourage planetary literacies that offer new understandings of subjectivity—understandings may help to address the urgency of the unfolding climate crisis (Chapter 3.4). We are invited to open our work to “everything, everyone, every moment” as authors propose a politics of immediation for literacy studies (Chapter 3.12). Generative cross-fertilization of critical literacies with dis/ability studies are suggested as a means to disrupt global, ableist hegemonies as we readers are encouraged to center on the experiences of minoritized youth given special education disability labels (Chapter 3.6). Teacher education programs can develop new understandings of schools as embedded within community systems, and teacher educators are invited to see community members as partners in the work of supporting new literacy educators (Chapter 3.15). We see the possibilities in recent work on translanguaging in Additional Language Teaching (Chapter 3.9), and the ways critical literacies can further English Language Teaching (Chapter 3.11). We are invited into Indigenous youth’s use of social media to resist the loss of Indigenous languages (Chapter 3.10). To interrupt rising nationalisms, xenophobia, continuing colonialism, and social hierarchies grounded in racial identities, we are offered approaches to cosmopolitan critical literacies (Chapter 3.16), border literacies (Chapter 3.17), and abolitionist literacies (Chapter 3.7).\n\n8\n\nIntro to Handbook of Critical Literacies\n\nNo single thread connects the theoretical frameworks, framings, and associated pedagogies and research programs present through the chapters of Area 3. There are chapters that resist the notion of “giving voice” to minoritized people, instead recognizing that people already have voices and seeking to affirm these voices by centering on these people’s knowledges and experiences (e.g., Chapters 3.7, 3.15). There are chapters proposing new theoretical frames, arguing contemporary frameworks cannot attend to the politics of affect (Chapter 3.12), environmental crises (Chapter 3.4), or digital ecosystems (Chapter 3.5). We read about new views of translanguaging (Chapter 3.9), ways to engage the critical in and through contemporary literatures (Chapter 3.1) and the arts (Chapter 3.2), and the need to see beyond our comfort zones while recognizing the current limitations of them (Chapter 3.3). This rich pastiche of approaches shows the current state of the field, and where critical literacies are going. Throughout, we, the readers, are invited to move beyond neoliberal academic production to engage, organize, disrupt, and build as we work for more sustainable social and material relations.\n\nConclusion We, as editors, are awed, inspired, and bolstered by the chapters we have jointly collected, curated, and supported as they arrived in these pages. Our collective futures might involve the creation of websites, listservs, more handbooks, articles, and research studies; it might also include grassroots activism, or active engagement with teachers and students, or with policymakers and curriculum developers. In all cases, we will continue to question our own privilege, our own linguistic and cultural capital, and ask: Where are we going from here? We hope readers feels similarly, and are left with this thought: it is always time to do the work, and let’s do the work.\n\nReferences Benjamin, R. (2019).

There is a continued violation of human rights (racism, homo/transphobia, detainment of children/youth, human trafficking, lack of access to health care/education; violent response to social protest). Fear is used to control economies, continue wars, and increase military budgets worldwide. In Latin America, in 2020, people experience panic about the expansion of the coronavirus as the dollar price skyrockets affecting local economies; migrants travel across the continent for different reasons, including hunger and violence; the instability of peace and democracy is latent as popular protests face repressive and increasingly militarized tactics. In Brazil, the dubious impeachment (Snider, 2018) of the democratically elected female president Dilma Rousseff in 2016 was followed by antidemocratic events that led to the election of a President who celebrates the brutality of military dictatorship (Schipani, 2017) and condemns human rights. After achieving the historical milestone of leaving the UN World Hunger Map for the first time in 2014, food insecurity returned to the country in 2020. In the United States, we are experiencing a surge of anti-immigrant, anti-Black rhetoric, policies, and practices that infuse every domain of public life. Under the direction of the US Secretary of Education, we see the continued usurping of public funds for private education, de-professionalization of educators, and detainment or separation of children and families at the border for profit. All of this is coupled with surging gun violence, in schools and communities. In the midst of this global–local, sociopolitical stage lies the struggle for/with educational literacies as now more than ever global dynamics have a direct impact on local action, and many communities experience the effects of “glocalization” (Brooks & Normore, 2010). We situate our work with critical educational literacies within these larger geographical, social, political, racial, linguistic, and economic forces that work on and against public schools, teachers, children/youth, families, and communities.\n\nCritical Autobiographical Poems: Becoming Scholars of Critical Literacy Before we delve deeper into critical literacy, we each share a poem from our own roots and routes to becoming critical literacy scholars. We do this to emphasize the relationships that exist within each DOI: 10.4324/9781003023425-3\n\n10\n\nCritical Literacy\n\nof our stories and the ways in which our narratives intersect in concentric circles. Even though we were raised in different decades and in different countries, there are similarities in our narratives that highlight how pervasive social problems are and how social inequities inspire the desire for change. The continuing push toward consumerism and public apathy is reinforced through individualism, alienation, and isolation. These principles are reinforced in school curricula that emphasize teaching isolated facts, without situated context, or relationships (e.g., for a critique of this, see Zinn, 2005).

We arrived at critical literacy in our lives through critical praxis before we encountered the theoretical foundations of the concept. This is a dynamic we have seen in communities where action and reflection come before or even without a formal theory. This may be due to the fact that action and transformation play a central role in the ways people embrace and embody critical literacy. Before Paulo Freire wrote about literacy from a critical perspective, he worked with the community and reflected about their social actions. Freire’s personal history paved the ground to his theory as he learned early in life about the social injustices and political struggles Brazilian people faced through conversations with his father (Schugurensky, 2011). He learned from his parents how to read and write, and his first teacher, Eunice Vasconcelos, was also a model of teaching (Schugurensky, 2011). Elza Freire, a primary school teacher and Paulo’s spouse, introduced education in his life (Spigolon, 2016). These experiences were the foundations of Freire’s approach to rely on the learners’ vocabulary as a departing point for building meaning and literacy, through the work with generative themes and words (Freire, 1970). Elza was fundamental in the elaboration, systematization, and the reasoning of the Paulo Freire method (Spigolon, 2016). Elza and his mother influenced his decision to be part of progressive Catholic movements that based their actions in the liberation theology (Schugurensky, 2011). During a decade of work at SESI (Serviço Social da Indústria), Freire entered into contact with the realities of working-class people in Brazil (Schugurensky, 2011). Although his theoretical antecedents were mostly authors from the Global North (e.g., Dewey, Marx, and Hegel), his experience in the Global South shaped his approach to critical literacy and popular education (Roberts, 2015). We want to address this relationship before we move forward with the conceptualization of critical literacy.\n\nPopular Education and Critical Literacy Critical literacies are closely tied to popular education because they both constitute ethical and political proposals for social transformation. Rooted in Latin American thought and realities, the popular education movement has its foundations in the independentist efforts and struggles. The ideas of Simón Rodríguez, Simón Bolívar’s teacher, planted the seed of what he called popular education: (1.) an education to become American, instead of European (South and North America as a whole continent); (2.) an education to reach freedom; and, (3.) an education to be able to work and live independently (Mejía, 2011). During the first half of the twentieth century, popular 15\n\nLina Trigos-Carrillo et al.\n\neducation universities were founded in Mexico, El Salvador, and Peru to educate the working class with a strong consciousness about their place and role in history and organization as a principle to defend their rights (Mejía, 2011). In Bolivia and Peru, movements to create schools based on indigenous thinking, such as the Ayllu de Warisata School, posed the need for an education grounded in the indigenous culture and epistemologies, which consider education as movement and as a process of cultural creation and social transformation that happened in the community (Mejía, 2011). In the 1960s, Paulo Freire started the Movement of Popular Culture and developed his pedagogy for popular education. Torres-Carrillo (2016) defines popular education as a set of social and discursive educational practices intended to center people from popular segments in society so that they become protagonists of social transformation based on their own interests and emancipatory visions of the future. Knowing the origins of popular education is important to understand the tenets of critical literacy because literacy education was interwoven in the movements of popular education as its leaders worked with communities who were illiterate. The epistemological foundations of literacy education lay on the power of social transformation and not on the functional purposes of literacy. This, tied to the particular sociopolitical circumstances in which popular education emerged, pushed toward critical approaches to literacy education. Critical literacy’s departing point is the reality of the people and the critical reading of that reality; it crosses the walls of the school; it takes into account the power dynamics in the ways of knowing; and it is an ethical and political initiative to achieve social transformation (Mejía, 2011). Teaching in the context of critical pedagogies and popular education in Latin America is characterized by a pedagogy of dignity; teaching rooted in hospitality and generosity; teaching to preserve the memory and history of communal identity; teaching that centers historical knowledge to build historical consciousness, to rethink the present, and radically imagine the future to transform unjust social structures; and a pedagogy based on processes of cultural negotiation, confrontation, and dialogue of “saberes” (knowledges/wisdom) (Cappellacci et al., 2018; Quintar, 2018). The group-centered spirit of popular education has deep roots in the United States as well. Popular education was at the core of the Highlander Center in New Market, Tennessee, which was the hub of labor rights (1930s) and civil rights organizing (1950s) and, currently focuses on immigrant rights. The popular education process relies on horizontal relationships between people who jointly inquire and analyze a social problem, plan, take action, and reflect. For example, the goal of the Citizenship Schools—and teachers such as Bernice Robinson, Septima Clark, and Alice Wine—was for African Americans to achieve voting rights by passing literacy tests required at polling places during Jim Crow. To do this, organizers/educators used voter registration materials as the basis for literacy education across the south (Bell, Gaventa, & Peters, 1990; Stokes-Brown, 1990). Together, they engaged in a problem-posing, problem-solving method of education.\n\nCritical Literacy in Action According to Menezes de Souza (2007) in the first volume of the journal Critical Literacy: Theories and Practices, if literacy is “a socio-culturally situated practice involving the ongoing negotiation of meaning in continuously contested sites of meaning construction, then all literacy in a certain sense ought to be ‘critical’ ” (p. 4). However, the emphasis on the word “critical” relates to a major attention “to literacy in issues relating to citizenship education, development education, foreign-language education and teacher education as sites of various socio-cultural crises in the form of continuously contested meaning construction and negotiation” (p. 4). From our own experiences, we share three examples of critical literacy in action. Each of these vignettes emphasize the critical, creative, and collective forms of practice, reflection, theorizing, and 16\n\nCritical Literacy\n\nacting that are necessary to imagine and build hopeful futures. They represent “glocalized” flows of knowledge, power, and organizing; that is, energies that are both local and global. For example, the global politics on climate change impacts food security in Latin America and Africa. Finally, literacies are positioned in a dialectical relationship with social movements—part of the texts, talk, interactions, signs, songs, and ever-reaching multimodal landscape—that create and represent social movements. Within each of these snapshots of global critical literacy praxis, we draw attention to the intellectual roots that have informed and inspired this work.\n\nVignette 1: Popular Education in a Community of Former Guerrilla Members and Their Families In 2016, the FARC-EP, one of the oldest guerrilla groups in Latin America, and the Colombian government signed a peace agreement to put an end to more than 50 years of armed conflict. The peace negotiation focused on six major topics: integral rural reform, political participation, the end of the armed conflict, a solution to drug trafficking, victims’ compensation, and implementation and verification mechanisms. Nearly 3,000 guerrilla members who endorsed the peace agreement moved to the 24 Territorial Spaces for Training and Reincorporation (ETCR in Spanish) that were created to support the transition process. In La Montañita, Caquetá, almost 300 guerilla members and their families started the reintegration process at ETCR Héctor Ramírez. This community, committed to maintaining and strengthening peace, has managed to buy this land and built the Centro Poblado Héctor Ramírez. The town is organized around a community cooperative that manages the income obtained through sustainable productive projects, such as pineapple, passion fruit, and coffee crops, fishing, and ecotourism. In 2020, around 250 adults and 60 children live in the community, which is organized around the indigenous philosophy of “Buen Vivir” (Good Living), “conceptualized as collective and integrative well-being, where the subject of wellbeing is not the individual, but the relation between an individual and his/her specific cultural-natural environment” (Chaves, Macintyre, Verschoor, & Wals, 2018, p. 153; Morin & Delgado, 2014). Buen Vivir philosophy in the community looks for equitable education, health, housing, and food for everyone. Community people possess deep knowledge about the plants and the land, the animals, and their ecosystems, the weather and agriculture, among other things, developed during the years living in the mountains. Education is highly important. Among the educational initiatives, a library named after former guerrilla member Alfonso Cano—a leader of critical education—was opened in 2018. In the process of peacebuilding, the library has become a thinking center and the space for the design and implementation of educational activities. Even though people in this community have not read Paulo Freire, they live and embody a critical consciousness and the main tenets of critical literacies in their daily life. The community organized an Education Committee, in a horizontal alliance with a university, to co-construct a relevant and own educational model for the community. This model is characterized by: (1.) the recognition of local knowledges, practices, and identities; (2.) a critical lens toward rural education; (3.) transformative praxis and political commitment in education; and (4.) education that works to achieve Buen Vivir in the community. In this context, critical literacies take different forms; for example, the town houses are decorated with murals that contest dominant narratives about the former guerrilla members and their identity; ex-combatants write their own stories and visions of the future in crónicas; children learn about the history of the armed conflict and rural traditions through theater and playwriting; children learn about the importance of the land and its conservation through an analysis of the global forces that influence their relationship with the land as well as local practices of sustainable food production; the popular library Alfonso Cano organizes activities and events to promote a critical reading of social reality in the process of peacebuilding; and, finally, children and youth create their own critical 17\n\nLina Trigos-Carrillo et al.\n\nmeans of communication through a community newspaper and a local radio, where they offer analysis and versions of the news that resist stereotyped representations of the community on the dominant media. With this, the community uses literacy beyond its functional purposes, as a praxis to read, rewrite, and transform their rural social realities.\n\nVignette 2: Pedagogy of the Earth and the Landless Movement In 2005, a group of Brazilian peasants, members of social movements, entered the undergraduate Pedagogy of the Earth course at the Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil (UFMG). The teacher education program was the result of a partnership between the Ministry of Agrarian Development, the Landless Movement, the Via Campesina social movement, and the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform (Incra). The graduates from the program would be able to work as teachers in their communities of origin (campings and settlements) as teachers of Language Arts (including foreign languages); mathematics; life and natural sciences; social sciences; and humanities. The program curriculum was based on the pedagogy of alternation, which combines classroom and distance education. The academic year was organized into classroom and non-classroom modules, or school-time and community-time for students to engage in learning in the city (university/ school) and the country (community). The “community time” was spent in each of the students’ communities, settlements, or occupied encampments, where families wait to be settled for an unknown amount of time. Despite the communities being under-resourced, the pedagogy of the earth was coherent with the social movement education premise that students need to engage in socially beneficial work. Caldart (2009) states that the movement’s agenda included education as a result of the lack of schools in the settlements where the militants lived, or camps where landless families lived while fighting for the right to the land. The movement’s educational perspective criticized the “rural” approach to education, which did not reflect their peasant identities. However, it was necessary to transform public schools for the achievement of the movement’s educational goals, a “transition within the MST—from a movement of popular educators to a movement of public school teachers” (Tarlau, 2015, p. 5). A new pedagogy is developed within the movement, firmly based on Freire’s critical pedagogy and the liberation theology, as well as the thoughts of Gramsci and Florestan Fernandes. Our teacher education program was a response to the need to educate teachers of the movements to teach in (more appropriately named) “country” schools. All the students were peasants—activists fighting for the redistribution of land, the conditions to produce food, and live a dignified life (Tarlau, 2015). Thus, the Pedagogy of the Earth represents an ethical and political approach to transformative education led by activists concerned with critically reading their reality for transformational actions. Critical literacies are enacted through the constant analysis of the texts originated in the university’s discourses, challenging potential asymmetrical power relations regarding different ways of knowing and doing within the university and the social movement. According to Leher and Vittoria (2015), the education of the landless movement converges popular education and Marxist Critical Pedagogies. Every day during the school-time immersion on the university campus, students prepared a mystical introduction to the day (mística), which summarized the previous day’s experiences. The mística is understood as a symbolic political representation, a cognitive praxis, and a social movement frame for the interpretation and articulation of counterhegemonic alternatives (Issa, 2007). The místicas were the dramatic enactment of significant events, represented through written texts, drawings, and elements of their work and struggle, such as seeds, earth, tools, and agricultural tools. After a long day of class, the students got together to make sense of the education provided by college professors within the movement’s pedagogy for country schools. 18\n\nCritical Literacy\n\nVignette 3: A Grassroots Teacher Activist Group In the early 2000s teachers across the United States faced the growing pressures of neoliberal forces: school closures, high-stakes tests, decreased autonomy of teachers, dramatic reductions in school spending. It was during this time that grassroots teachers’ groups sprouted up around the United States—from Chicago to New York City, Washington DC, and San Francisco to St. Louis. What united many of these groups was the agency of educators to envision and create alternative realities for public education; realities infused with social justice pedagogy. In 2000, Mary Ann Kramer and I, Rebecca, started a teacher inquiry group focused on generating critical literacies in classrooms across the lifespan. We invited a diverse group of teachers to collaboratively move through the cycle of popular education, inquiring, reflecting, and acting together. Over time, this small group grew into a network called Educators for Social Justice (ESJ), which includes over 1,000 educators and many dedicated leaders (including a current majority Womyn of Color Board). This group was born out of the need to reinvigorate a critical project in literacy education—linking literacy education to social and political struggles. For years, we worked together to create classroom- and community-based instances of critical literacy practice. Whether advocating for human rights at the Old Court House, designing a campaign for adult literacy education, creating Teach-Ins to support racial justice, supporting adult education students in their efforts to keep their school open, hosting a Banned Books celebration, or crafting Solidarity Statements—we knew that literacy teaching and activism were interconnected; one infusing the other. As we organized for social movements, we drew on and created powerful literacy practices to change social conditions. In our individual and collective social movement organizing and activism—from the womyn’s movement, civil rights movement, anti-nuclear movement, immigrant rights movements to organizing within schools and for environmental rights—we collectively discerned that group-centered leadership and popular education were central principles guiding our work. Several of us attended organizing workshops at Highlander, a popular education center in New Market, Tennessee. We drew on the wisdom of organizers and educators such as John Berry Meachum and Mary Meachum and the abolitionist teaching on the Freedom Schools in the Mississippi River (Webster Moore, 1973), Ella Baker and the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee and Black Freedom Movement (Ransby, 2003), Septima Clark, Joann Robinson, Myles Horton and the Citizenship Schools (Stokes-Brown, 1990). They offer examples of group-centered leadership that are strategic and have historical roots that continue to impact the education for liberation movement today. In 2009, participants in this group collectively wrote a book which features both case examples of critical literacy practice across the lifespan and also theoretical and pedagogical for enacting critical literacy education (Rogers, Mosley, Kramer, & LSJTRG, 2009). This model includes the elements of building community, developing critical stances, critical inquiry and analysis, and action. At the heart of this framework is the popular education cycle which is committed to a horizontal relation of power whereas people engage in a problem-posing, problem-solving process. In a community, teachers can practice criticality and take action to change the material conditions of their classrooms, schools, and communities. We reframe the “teaching of critical literacy” to “organizing for social justice” and, in this process, critical literacies emerge. Along the way, there have been debates about the amount of emphasis placed on awareness raising and social action. ESJ has done both. There have been material differences made through this collective work. The network itself was a material outcome of critical literacy praxis. That is, the building of a network is a form of organizing from which critical literacies emerge. Adult literacy teachers and students organized to keep a school open. For 15 years, teachers organized a social justice conference at a local school. We have organized rapid-response Teach-Ins to speak out about continued police brutality. In these forums, educators learn how to address racial violence as part 19\n\nLina Trigos-Carrillo et al.\n\nof the literacy curriculum. We continue to work in coalition with regional organizations to change school district policy around the suspension of Children of Color from school. These efforts matter to keep children in school and #BTP (#Break the School to Prison Pipeline). ESJ creates a counternarrative that showcases educators who have reclaimed professional development and are leading the grassroots educational reform. The network continues to live outside of formalized institutions of teacher education and higher education. Through teacher-led, radical professional development, ESJ provides a “meeting space” for educators across the region and across the life span to connect, inspire, and organize for social justice in their schools. *** The three vignettes highlight transformations in the way people enact and embody critical literacy around the globe. First, these initiatives are born in the community out of a necessity for social change. That is, there is a sense of urgency as they respond to current social concerns. Second, the vignettes represent communal efforts with horizontal power relationships, where participation, learning, and collaboration take place. Third, across the vignettes there is a link between the materiality of organizing for social justice and critical literacy praxis. In these contexts, critical literacy is not an intentional practice planned by a teacher or leader, it is the organic result of social action. It moves beyond critical awareness and installs itself at the core of social organization. Finally, the three vignettes center epistemologies of the South by moving Black, indigenous, rural/country knowledges/values to the heart of social organization and praxis. They occur in the everyday, inand-out of school, communal experience of people who are already empowered to take over social action.\n\nCritiques of Critical Literacy In our own work as critical literacy scholars, we have been aware of the continued debates about the role of critical literacies in social transformation. Freire’s life and legacy are often used interchangeably with critical literacy. Tuck and Yang (2012) make the point that Freire situates the work of liberation in the minds of the oppressed without comprehensive recognition of settler colonialism. They argue that liberation, in this sense, becomes a metaphor of the mind and the “rest will follow.” Put in this way, the project of critical literacy needs to include awareness raising and joining together with social justice movement organizing to avoid “settler harm reduction” (Tuck & Yang, 2012, p. 21). Consciousness raising without struggle to change material conditions that reproduce systemic inequities will not contribute to collective liberation. Some critical literacy frameworks address this reality and insist on a social action component which links educational literacies with movement building (e.g., Lewison, Leland, & Harste, 2007). Given the sociopolitical contexts discussed at the start of this chapter, it is not without surprise that the action component gives educators a great deal of uncertainty. Perhaps, this is one of the reasons that critical literacy has failed to take off in any kind of comprehensive way in teacher education. Morgan (1997) provides an overview of critiques of critical literacy which come mainly from poststructuralists and feminists: (1.) they question the authority of truth as connected with ideological distortions; that is, people coming to understand their “true” oppression/liberation; (2.) trusting radical pedagogical theorists to drive social change is difficult when their arguments are made through dense academic discourses accessible only to the elite; (3.) the conceptions of power as “power-over” or “empower” is problematic; (4.) and, finally, the unproblematic celebration of student difference, life experiences, and voice in the “innocent” concept of “dialogue,” which is often associated with Freirean methods, could be ineffective to achieve social transformation because of 20\n\nCritical Literacy\n\nthe power relations at play. These critiques are a reminder that critical literacy practices must continually be held up for reflexive analysis. Further, discourses of individuality (ironically) surround critical literacy. This is problematic given the genealogy of critical literacy can be traced to indigenous leaders working in community, freedom fighters, abolitionists, etc. Important in these global antecedents is the role of group-centered leadership and womyn-led efforts. Yet, in current scholarship of critical literacy, the default major citations are given to white men from the Global North (e.g., Giroux, McLaren, Ira Shor, Aronowitz, and Colin Lankshear) (Freire and Allan Luke as an exception in this group). The analysis of the vignettes offers some insights about the new trajectories and challenges of critical literacy in action. Vignette 1 presents a case where critical pedagogies and literacy emerged organically from the community desire to achieve Buen Vivir in the context of peacebuilding. This vignette shows a grassroot organization where social action truly involves communal organization and resistance as they want to maintain their identity while working toward peace amidst the challenges of rural Colombia. The role of academia in this process is to learn, collaborate, and accompany the process in a horizontal relationship, where the community takes responsibility for their needs and desires; scholars are open to learn from the community; and social transformation is embodied collectively in everyday practices. In this context, critical literacy is part of building, reflecting, resisting, creating awareness, and transforming social reality. It also implies a physical and epistemological connection between the urban and rural Other. Vignette 2 shows a case where learners would subvert the traditional approaches to higher education. The after-class meetings and the místicas allowed students to occupy the large estate (latifundio) of knowledge. Members of social movements planned together their future as teachers who would implement bottom-up pedagogies in the mainstream schools of the rural area. These pedagogies were the basis for educating children and youth to resist agro-imperialism and foster sustainable agriculture, fair trade, farmworkers’ rights, and food sovereignty. On the other hand, in a dialogical relation with social movements, the universities had to question power relations across a curriculum. The learners were quite aware of how they wanted to reconstruct and redesign education in their sociopolitical realities, and the university had to invent new ways of teaching, learning, and impacting society. Vignette 3 offers perhaps a typical example of the kind of social justice organizing that occurs from teacher-led groups across the United States. Many of the teachers in the inner circle/leadership were from privileged school contexts (either schools with resources or from higher education). There have been pockets of what could be considered substantive action and modest changes (changes to practice, changes to identity, changes in narratives). Yet, teachers remain undervalued and underpaid, schools are inequitably funded and segregated, and the school-to-prison pipeline still exists. Critical literacy practitioners must connect with social justice unionism to make lasting reforms.\n\nRadically Imagining a Future for Transnational Critical Literacy Scholarship Many overviews of critical literacy have been written that have influenced our own understanding of the field (see, Luke, 2012; Morgan, 1997; Morrell, 2008; Vasquez, Janks, & Comber, 2019). In this chapter, we have paid tribute to and push beyond Freire’s work to examine embodied social theories that have guided people in their quest for freedom across time and place. There is a rising push of recent scholarship generated from the Global South that emphasizes the global presence of critical literacy praxis around the world. For example, in Brazil, as part of the National Literacies Project (Monte Mor, 2019), Menezes de Souza (2011) suggests a redefinition of critical literacy that encompasses the pedagogical task of preparing learners for confrontations with differences of all kinds. In his perspective, the Freirean concept of listening acquires vital importance. More than learning to 21\n\nLina Trigos-Carrillo et al.\n\nlisten to each other, it is essential to learn to listen to ourselves listening to the other (Menezes de Souza, 2011). Careful and critical listening leads to looking for other forms of interaction that are not even direct confrontation nor the pursuit of the harmonious elimination of differences. Duboc and Ferraz (2018) problematize orientations for critical literacies in fostering language education for social change. These orientations include embracing the contradictions and acknowledging the needs of revision in the field of critical literacies; overcoming the dichotomy between the micro and macro levels of spaces for change; exploring the possibilities of social media for new ways of activism; and emphasizing a sense of belonging among language teacher professional communities. Yet, what if we are not in need of any more scholarship? What if what we need is more strategic organizing and networking as we are engaged in with the Transnational Critical Literacy Network? Our own work for this chapter is a case in point—for many weeks we met across time and place—to consider the lived realities in Colombia, Brazil, and the United States. We shared and listened to each other’s stories, struggles, and experiences. In this process of radically imagining the future of critical literacy, we offer a list of “what ifs” as a starting point to move the field forward. •\n\n• • • • • • • • •\n\nWhat if scholars collectively wrote an open letter to professional organizations describing the scholarly integrity and impact of social justice organizing connected to schools, community centers, and institutions of higher education? This letter could make a case for this kind of engaged scholarship and ways to examine its value outside of commonly used academic metrics. What if we learn from social movements already taking place globally and strengthen actionoriented partnerships to imagine new routes for education? What if we change the competitive, individualistic work in academia for community goals and desires? What if we disrupt the logic of academic prestige through publication and start valuing outreach engagement activities? What if we learn from and accept other forms of language and discourse in knowledge building? What if we reflect with the community on their own visions so that our collaboration works toward dignity and generosity? What if we challenge neoliberal perspectives on development that position rural, indigenous, and Global South peoples as deficient? What if we work to build historical memories shaping narratives of marginalized groups that are meaningful for the communities and their realities? What if we take critical literacy education out of the classroom through lasting engagements and commitments with communities? What if . . .\n\nReferences Bell, B., Gaventa, J., & Peters, J. (1990).

In youth discourses, critical literacies are manifested through critiques of dominant ideologies and political systems, active engagement in sociopolitical and cultural discourses, participation in exploration and creation of complex self-identities, and expressions of solidarity with others who have been socially or systemically marginalized (Goodman & Cocca, 2014; Luke, 2014). Historically, the liberating agency of critical literacies has been seen as a threat to the status quo by the powerful private interests who benefit from the extant social and economic systems (Chomsky, 1999; Goodman & Cocca, 2014). These interests—commonly associated with neoliberalism by its academic critics—prefer the state’s assistance in the privatization of public sectors and creation of free markets for them to commoditize and profit from public spheres such as education, postal services, or health care (Giroux, 2014; Hursh, 2005). In this chapter, we share examples of critical literacies that challenge neoliberal and ethnonationalist interests and complicate transnationalism. In recent decades, educational institutions across the world have reconstituted themselves to operate based on hyper-capitalist market models. The growing corporate push to monetize teaching and learning has perpetuated neoliberal values, ideals, and principles into youth literacies and discourses, and language education (Giroux, 2014; Schmeichel, Sharma, & Pittard, 2017). In formal settings, this has meant, among other things, the introduction of corporate management systems and accountability, evident in the prevalence of high-stakes testing as well as ranking and performance monitoring systems. Within education, the neoliberal model has reduced literacies to the mercy of decontextualized skills training and standardized assessments that claim to measure the quality of their product: students, who are both commodity and labor for the market (Apple, 2000; Au, 2016). Building standards and monolithic curricula to control youth literacies and produce new labor for the global market can be compared to a form of colonization proliferated through digital technologies, fueled by neoliberal globalization (Reyes & Segal, 2019; Sah, 2020). In more informal settings, with digital technologies and the internet, more youth are engaging in new literacies on social media platforms to market themselves as brands (influencers)—where they make and become marketable products transacted within a digital free market. More recently, when COVID-19 pushed a transition to online work and education across the world, the internet became an even more crucial space for civic engagement and critical literacies, DOI: 10.4324/9781003023425-4\n\n24\n\nLiteracies Under Neoliberalism\n\nwhile at the same time pulling more consumers into a neoliberal global economy. Neoliberalism in the digital age raises major concerns not only for literacies and language education but also for local and global citizenship and identity. As users of a corporate-controlled internet grow and education is being privatized, these neoliberal ontologies are showing potential to colonize what is left of indigenous and local literacies—those historically marginalized by dominant ways of being, knowing, and doing (Au, 2016; Cazden, 2002; Salas & Portes, 2017)—especially in the “Global South.” Further, to keep global control and maintain power, neoliberal values, ideals, and principles have even been found intersecting with global nationalistic forces, such as ethnonationalism and transnationalism, in ways that have repercussions for individual and social freedom and dignity. As a challenge to neoliberal influence, transnational critical literacies scholarship calls for critique of current policies and practices in literacies and language education and counter the marginalization and dehumanization of those without sociopolitical and economic power (Siebers, 2019). We review the extant literature that dissects the role of neoliberalism in education and discuss current concerns for literacies under neoliberalism. We present instances from global discourses to demonstrate the active role of critical literacies in countering neoliberalism. Framing our argument around digital technology and its role in enabling ethnonationalism and shaping transnationalism, we follow with possible attempts to counter the potential effects of neoliberalism on literacies education and, more broadly, global citizenship.\n\nDefinitions of Key Concepts Literacies As the form of the word implies, literacies denote a pluralistic conceptualization of what it takes for people to successfully function as meaning-makers in diverse communic"
