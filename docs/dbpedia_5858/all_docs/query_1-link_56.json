        "text": "El √∫ltimo \"Country report\" de la Comisi√≥n Europea (https://lnkd.in/daJ63mYz) apunta a una serie de retos en los que Espa√±a est√° en una situaci√≥n preocupante: 1) Abandono educativo 2) J√≥venes que no estudian ni trabajan 3) Evoluci√≥n de la renta disponible de los hogares 4) Pobreza infantil 5) Reducci√≥n de la pobreza con transferencias sociales La radiograf√≠a global es la de un pa√≠s incapaz de ofrecer oportunidades adecuadas a sus j√≥venes y con problemas de desigualdad no resueltos. En abandono educativo somos el segundo pa√≠s de la Uni√≥n Europea con mayor tasa de abandono educativo temprano. Por poner un ejemplo, Espa√±a tiene una tasa de abandono educativo temprano m√°s de tres veces superior a la de Irlanda. La Comisi√≥n considera que estamos en situaci√≥n cr√≠tica a este respecto, aunque var√≠a mucho por regiones. El impacto que tiene a largo plazo sobre el desarrollo vital de millones de ciudadanos deber√≠a convertirlo en una prioridad absoluta de cualquier gobierno. A este respecto, destacan iniciativas como EdugalIA, de la Xunta de Galicia, las cuales se enmarcan en una conception integral del abandono educativo como elemento esencial de la equidad del sistema. No en vano, Galicia es una de las regiones de Espa√±a con menor tasa de abandono educativo temprano. Profundizando en la falta de oportunidades, m√°s del 12% de los j√≥venes ni estudia ni trabaja, lo cual tendr√°, una vez m√°s, consecuencias a largo plazo sobre su capacidad para desplegar un proyecto vital pleno y satisfactorio. La situaci√≥n general de los hogares no es mejor. Espa√±a es uno de los pa√≠s de la uni√≥n europea en donde peor evolucion√≥ la renta bruta disponible de los hogares desde 2008 (-4%). La Comisi√≥n considera que estamos en situaci√≥n cr√≠tica a ese respecto. Tambi√©n es cr√≠tica la situaci√≥n a nivel de pobreza y redistribuci√≥n, incluso despu√©s de desplegar pol√≠ticas como el IMV, el cu√°l solo llega a una fracci√≥n de su poblaci√≥n objetivo, pero eso dar√≠a para otro post. Casi un tercio de los j√≥venes menores de 17 a√±os est√°n en situaci√≥n de riesgo de pobreza o exclusi√≥n social, el tercer pa√≠s con peor tasa de la Uni√≥n Europea. A eso tenemos que unirle que Espa√±a est√° claramente por debajo de la media en reducci√≥n de la pobreza con transferencias sociales. Para ponerlo en perspectiva, seg√∫n un informe del JRC (https://lnkd.in/ddDYgMhb), Espa√±a e Irlanda tienen tasas de riesgo de riesgo de pobreza infantil similares antes de intervenci√≥n p√∫blica, pero mientras Irlanda la reduce en m√°s de 10 puntos, en Espa√±a el efecto de las intervenciones p√∫blicas es de menos de la mitad (4 puntos de reducci√≥n). De hecho, el propio informe del JRC apunta a que en Espa√±a buena parte de las ayudas directas e indirectas a la infancia acaban en los mayores deciles de renta. En definitiva, sin √°nimo de ser catastrofista, est√° claro que tenemos por delante retos no resueltos de primer nivel.\n\nCONTEXT: Schools in Italy are mandated to respect some national holidays, AND are given a number of days they can freely choose to declare off for any reason (it can be \"traditional\", for instance the day of the patron saint of the city they are in, or an anniversary; or specific to an event, like the death of a student or of a teacher). The Ministry of Education decides how many days schools get, but has no influence on how they allocate them (or choose not to). In spite of Italy formally not having a State religion, and the Constitution allowing anyone to practice their spirituality as they see fit, the Christian matrix of the country runs so deep that a school which chose to close on the day of Eid, to allow its (mostly Muslim) students to celebrate with their families created a scandal. The headmaster had every right to call a day off; the majority of the students are Muslim, they wouldn't have come to school on Eid anyway; the teachers agreed that it would be better to have a day off for all, to incentivise inclusion (and curiosity towards a different culture from the other students) and ensure no one lags behind. Had this been any other holiday/festival/celebration this would have gone unnoticed. In a seemingly unfitting parallel... Today is Labour day in most of the world, not in the Netherlands (which if I'm not mistaken has chosen to celebrate King's day instead of Labour day). I, like all my other colleagues, am working. And I can't help but reflect about inclusion being achieved through many monumental issues, but also through a myriad of small issues: giving the freedom to choose which days to take off based on a person's beliefs or traditions -and making sure that employees know they can, not saying \"well, you could have...\" after they showed up for work- makes a lot of difference for those we want to hire and retain. Even though it may appear like a paradox, by allowing the expression of individuality we foster the sense of belonging. It's easier to belong when we are allowed to be who we are.\n\nJune 19th marks the day in 1865 when slavery ended in the United States. Why does this matter in Canada? We mark this day in Canada to celebrate the end of slavery in the U.S. and to recognize that Canada also had a long history of enslaving African people ‚Äì in fact, Canada has a longer history of enslaving people (about 200 years) than not enslaving them. Even after our own Emancipation Day on August 1, 1834, Canada benefitted from the institution of slavery, largely through banks and industries building wealth from trade and participation in the U.S. slave economy. Juneteenth gives us an opportunity to reckon with our national past and move forward with a more honest understanding of where inequities in our own country need to be redressed. If you want to dive deeper into why Juneteenth matters in Canada, read Jennifer Adams‚Äô piece in The Conversation: https://loom.ly/5EFIQo0 #juneteenth #freedomday #emancipation\n\nThe #Chinese state is intent on quashing the identity of the #Tibetan people. It's chief weapon is not dystopian camps but something seemingly more quotidian: 'Residential Schools'. Nearly a million Tibetan children live in state-run residential schools on the Tibetan plateau. Chinese authorities subject these children to a highly politicized curriculum designed to strip them of their mother tongue, sever their ties to their religion and culture, and methodically replace their Tibetan identity with a Chinese one. Children as young as four have been separated from their parents and enrolled in boarding kindergartens under a recruitment strategy based largely on coercion. Until recently, the schools in Tibet were mostly local day-schools, and students returned home each evening; whatever they were taught in school was moderated by what they learned at home. But since Xi came to power, the government has shuttered most of these local schools and consolidated them into newly constructed boarding establishments located far from villages and towns. Unlike the schools of the past, the residential institutions enable the state to fully wrest control of the students‚Äô attention and environment. This gives the #Chinese_Communist_Party unprecedented power to shape the worldview and mold the identity of the youngest generation of #Tibetans. The most comprehensive study on the residential school system to date comes from a 2021 report by the #Tibet_Action_Institute, a human rights advocacy group. Its researchers used Chinese government statistical yearbooks, firsthand testimonials from Tibet, and Chinese language academic publications to estimate that some 800,000 Tibetan students aged six to 18 are currently in the boarding system‚Äîroughly, three out of every four students in Tibet. This staggering statistic does not include the more than 100,000 Tibetan children aged four to six who are believed to be in boarding kindergartens. The report also documents many cases of the state coercing parents into enrolling their children, puncturing Beijing‚Äôs claim that all enrollment is voluntary. Chinese authorities impose punitive measures, including fines, denial of welfare subsidies, even arrest and imprisonment, to force parents to enroll their children in the schools. The West should be particularly concerned by China‚Äôs imposition of these schools on Tibetan youth. After all, the residential schools resemble the church-run boarding schools in which authorities thrust indigenous children in Australia and North America in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Where in recent years, researchers and survivors have brought to light the horrific scale of abuses and trauma associated with these schools, which sought to separate children from their indigenous cultures and families. https://lnkd.in/gzgJXGdM"
