        "text": "This article studies the intersection of sport, religion, and imperialism through the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) as an extension of United States expansion into Puerto Rico after the Spanish American War of 1898. The YMCA’s emphasis on “muscular Christianity” and sports made it attractive to some locals who welcomed this feature of U.S. Americanization. This article seeks to challenge notions of imperialism and Americanization (through sport and religion) as a process not clearly defined by the dyad oppressor and victim. To the contrary, the story of the YMCA in Puerto Rico shows the ways in which YMCA leaders sought to bring progress to an “oppressed” people, while many locals welcomed a progressive institution of modern sports. My argument blurs the line between resistance and acculturation and instead proposes to see the YMCA and the early development of sport in Puerto Rico as a process of negotiations over power, identity, and culture.\n\nThe scholarship on the history of Protestant missions to Puerto Rico after the Spanish American War of 1898 emphasizes the Americanizing tendencies of the missionaries in the construction of the new Puerto Rican. There is no doubt that the main missionary motif during the 1890s was indeed civilization. Even though the Americanizing motif was part of the evangelistic efforts of some missionaries, new evidence shows that a minority of missionaries, among them Presbyterians James A. McAllister and Judson Underwood, had a clear vision of indigenization/contextualization for the emerging church based on language (Spanish) and culture (Puerto Rican). The spread of Christianity was successful not only because of the missionaries but also because native agents took up the task of evangelizing their own people; they were not passive spectators but active agents translating and processing the message of the gospel to fulfill their own people’s needs based on their own individual cultural assu...\n\nThe scholarship on the history of Protestant missions to Puerto Rico after the Spanish American War of 1898 emphasizes the Americanizing tendencies of the missionaries in the construction of the new Puerto Rican.

This article problematizes the past divisions of such evangelizing activities between the history of Christianity, mission history, and theology by analyzing the native ministries of Adela Sousa (a Bible woman) and Miguel Martinez in light of the teachings of the American missionaries. The investigation claims that because of Puerto Rican agents’ roles in the process of evangelization, a new fusion between the history of Christianity, mission history, and theology emerged as soon as new converts embraced and began to preach the gospel.\n\nThis article examines North Atlantic views of Protestant missions and race in the Dominican Republic between 1905 and 1911, a brief period of political stability in the years leading up to the U.S. Occupation (1916–1924). Although Protestant missions during this period remained small in scale on the Catholic island, the views of British and American missionaries evidence how international perceptions of Dominicans transformed in the early twentieth century. Thus, this article makes two key interventions within the literature on Caribbean race and religion. First, it shows how outsiders’ ideas about the Dominican Republic&#39;s racial composition aimed to change the Dominican Republic from a “black” country into a racially ambiguous “Latin” one on the international stage. Second, in using North Atlantic missionaries’ perspectives to track this shift, it argues that black-led Protestant congregations represented a possible alternative future that both elite Dominicans and white North ...\n\nThe educational history of Hispanic Americans is not a “new” history. Hispanic peoples began exploration, settlement, and even schooling in North America in the sixteenth century. A more appropriate metaphor is to think of Hispanic educational history as a rich, unearthed site awaiting the work of archivists and researchers. There is no doubt that the large post-1965 immigration of Latinos to the United States renewed interest among scholars in the history of these peoples. Yet contemporary social, political, economic, and educational issues raise the troubling question of why Hispanic-American history has remained neglected for so long. This essay is a beginning towards understanding the relationship between historians and the educational history of Hispanic Americans during the last century. Specifically, this historiographical inquiry examines some barriers that have dissuaded scholars from exploring the history of Latino influences in North America, assesses current writings, an...\n\nThis study examines the history and current state of evangelical Christianity in the Dominican Republic. It focuses on two historical Protestant denominations: the African Methodist Episcopal Church (A.M.E.) and the Iglesia Evangélica Dominicana (I.E.D.). Each of these denominations was founded in the Dominican Republic during key moments in the country’s history. Using historical documents and interviews with church leaders, this article focuses on the ways that each institution has adapted to Dominican society in the twenty-first century while also maintaining ties to the United States. It additionally questions how factors such as social marginalization, racial discrimination, the growth of the Dominican evangelical community, and continued connections to U.S. institutions have affected the trajectory of these churches. Ultimately, this research analyzes how historical church leaders view their place within Dominican society and their historic and current ties to U.S. institutions.\n\nLatino Protestants in America are growing—fast. More and more Latinos identify as Protestant, Latino Protestant churches are spreading, and Latino Protestant parachurch organizations are broadening their representation and outreach. We synthesize the latest research on Latino Protestants in the United States in relation to history, sociodemographics, conversion, and race/ethnic identity formation. We argue that Latino Protestants are far from monolithic. In fact, Latino Protestant congregation express and experience diversity in their worship, liturgy, theology, identities, and resources. We argue against ethnoracial essentialization, that is, boiling down nuances of Latino Protestant identity in favor of idealized conclusions often in the form of racial/ethnic stereotypes. Recent empirical research does not support often‐cited assessments of Latino Protestants and their churches as “fiestas” with “spicy” worship. Instead, we urge scholars to avoid such front‐loaded, racialized assumptions and exercise their social scientific expertise in using better theory and more careful observation to achieve a more textured understanding of Latino Protestants and their churches."
