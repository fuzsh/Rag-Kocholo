        "text": "SAN JUAN, P.R. — They shouted angrily about “colonialism” and called for a Prexit, or Puerto Rican exit, from the United States. They denounced the “junta” — or federal control board — that will soon direct this island’s failing governance and finances.\n\nLate Thursday afternoon, even Gov. Alejandro García Padilla seemed to be joining in the protest, declaring a moratorium on paying the island’s debts just one day before a big payment was due — even as President Obama was signing a new law that precludes the governor from making such a move.\n\nBut beneath the defiant rhetoric — on the Puerto Rican talk shows, at labor rallies and at an “Occupy” vigil at the federal courthouse here — there was also resignation: an awareness that Puerto Rico’s own elected officials had let the island slip into a death spiral, and that the passage by the United States Senate on Wednesday of a bill meant to assert federal authority was really the only available solution.\n\n“It’s not all their fault, it’s our fault, too, because we voted for them,” said Dielmarie Negrón, a geography student at the University of Puerto Rico and a volunteer for Iniciativa Comunitaria, a nonprofit group that serves addicts and homeless people in several Puerto Rican cities.\n\n“We feel bad, because we can no longer make our own decisions,” she added, speaking in an interview at her group’s offices on Wednesday, after the Senate vote. “But it was our own decisions that got us here.”\n\nEveryone seems to have strong feelings — many of them conflicting — about their shared predicament: a passionate love of Borikén, the widely used pre-Columbian name for their island; a sense of shock that their government amassed a $72 billion debt; a bitter resentment of Washington — and yet a begrudging appreciation of the benefits that American citizenship and the United States safety net can bring."
