From a young age, she demonstrated her passion for the arts through dancing and acting. Her initial fame arose from her crowning as Miss Puerto Rico Petite in 1993 and Miss American Petite in 1994, paving the way for her future journey in show business. Sánchez's acting career soared to prominence in the late 1990s with key roles in acclaimed films and television series. She played pivotal characters in movies like Rush Hour 2 and The Game Plan, cementing her status as a versatile actress. On television, she is best known for her performance in the hit series Without a Trace for which she received several award nominations. Her portrayal of Carmen Luna in the popular show Devious Maids further highlighted her talent and versatility. Apart from acting, Sánchez is also recognized for her singing prowess. She launched her music career in 2003 with the release of her debut album Borinqueña. The album was well-received and spawned the hit single \"Amor Amor\". A testament to her multifaceted persona, Sánchez has also dabbled in writing, co-authoring the children's book Sebi and the Land of Cha Cha Cha.\n\nIván Rodríguez Torres (born November 27, 1971), nicknamed \"Pudge\", is a former Major League Baseball catcher.
