I saw this outdoor sculpture during a walkabout in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico.

It is as statue of Eugenio Maria de Hostos who is a famous Puerto Rico educator, philosopher, intellectual, lawyer, sociologist and independence advocate. He is called "The Citizen of the Americas".

The statue is by Jose Buscaglia.
