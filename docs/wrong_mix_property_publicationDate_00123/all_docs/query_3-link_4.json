        "text": "The Gods of Mars is the sequel to the previous A Princess of Mars. It is part of the Barsoom series which I wrote briefly about my Princess article and won’t repeat here. The series was written by Edgar Rice Burroughs and Gods was published serially (in five parts) in The All-Story (which also published Princess) in 1913 and as a complete novel for the first time in 1918. I plan next to read The Warlord of Mars – part 3 in the series – and then call it a day for this series, at least for now. Maybe later in life, if I get a chance, I will revisit it. I’m under the impression that only these first three books principally concern John Carter while the following books cover the lives of other Barsoomians. As such, these first three are somewhat loosely considered the John Carter Trilogy.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn short, Gods covers John Carter’s return to Barsoom, or Mars, and his attempt to find his beloved Dejah Thoris. It is set twenty years after book one concludes. The story chiefly revolves around the Barsoomian religion which is shown to be based on lies, and it is exposed by John Carter. His quest for Dejah Thoris takes him to the south pole and introduces him to two new races of Barsoomians – the white Therns and the black First Born.\n\nIn the end he ‘destroys’ the Barsoomian religion and finds Dejah Thoris. In a hard twist though, he is kept from her as she has been imprisoned in a strange prison cell which will hold her for one solar year. He is unsure if she is even alive, or will survive that year. Its a bit of a cliff-hanger. He also meets his son – Carthoris – who hatched(!) while Carter had been on Earth.\n\nRELIGION OF BARSOOM\n\nWe are treated to the basic tenets of Barsoomin religion: If you get old enough – mostly women because most men die in warfare – or if you are sorely grieved and ready for the next life, you take a trip down the River Iss. The River Iss spits you out into the Valley Dor. Supposedly a long life of paradise awaits. This was alluded to in book one but seemed unimportant at the time.\n\nBut… What actually awaits are these bloodthirsty plant creatures, a whole bunch of Martian white apes and a third Barsoomian (white) race called Therns who oversee the area. They consider themselves an immortal, holy people. They are cannibalistic and survive mostly on what comes down the Iss, especially for most of their weapons, tools and such. They are a wicked people. But they live in fear of the Martian Firstborn – a black race – who owe their allegiance to their deity Issus. She’s at the top of this whole religion. She’s supposedly a beautiful all-knowing, all-powerful deity. The First Born are rumored to live on a Martian moon, but in truth live in a subterranean city (called Omean) and caves at the South Pole. The First Born routinely raid the Therns for slaves and food for their goddess, Issus. They also appreciate red Barsoomian slaves but consider the green Barsoomians too base. Though supposedly this powerful beautiful goddess, Issus is actually a fat haggard extremely old First Born female who fools everyone because of their religion and their reluctance even to question its tenets.\n\nOnce someone travels down the River Is, they are never allowed to return; if they do, they face capital punishment. Only one person ever returned. He told them of the true Valley Dor and of the Therns, apes and plant-monsters, but he was killed due to blasphemy and returning from the Iss.\n\nTHEMES\n\nReligion:\n\nPrincess was just a big adventure story. Not a lot of scientific elements to it – more of a western set on Mars, officially a planetary romance. The Gods of Mars is in that same vein though there may be more science here, not all of it good, and there is also a lot of the religious or philosophical or metaphysical aspect of life dealt with. I like that. One of the things I enjoy about science fiction is that is allows you to consider the metaphysical questions due to the often fantastic nature of the narrative. Two very good and very different examples of this would be CS Lewis’s Perelandra and the science fiction film Event Horizon.\n\nFrom the start, The Gods of Mars is a religious epic: the fall of the old gods and the rise of the new. Though the new are not described explicitly, they are reason, honor, justice and courage – four valuable ideals. The story begins religiously. From the third paragraph:\n\nWith arms outstretched toward the red eye of the great star I stood praying for a return of that strange power which twice had drawn me through the immensity of space, praying as I had prayed on a thousand nights before…\n\nPrayer to whom? The great Roman war god Mars I assume. But no matter. And later, after discovering the truth of the pilgrimage down the Iss, Carter is persuading his friends to attempt to fight their way back to mainland Barsoom and spread the truth – that their religion is false – to their people:\n\nWe know that the valley is not sacred; we know that the Holy Therns are not holy; that they are a race of cruel and heartless mortals, knowing no more of the real life to come than we do. Only thus may we carry the truth to those without, and though the likelihood of our narrative being given credence is, I grant you, remote, so wedded are mortals to their stupid infatuation for impossible superstitions, we should be craven cowards indeed were we to shirk the plain duty which confronts us.\n\nThere you have reason, honor, justice and courage. They are illustrated further at many points. An example of poorly executed justice occurs when John Carter is sentenced to death by Zat Arras. And a of lack of courage when the same Zat Arras jumps off the ship to his death instead of facing his appropriate punishment. He is dishonorable in both instances.\n\nReading CS Lewis (1898-1963) has given me an appreciation for the “other” and the ancient, especially where religious belief is concerned. Lewis was an academic atheist early in life who, over time, came to believe the gospel. Lewis wrote (I think in Surprised by Joy) that he would not have believed a religion that was completely true surrounded by those that are completely false. But if all the other religions had a hint of the truth and pointed to the greater truth, then he would be more likely to believe that greater truth. He found the lesser truths in the other religions, but not so much the other major organized religions, but the ancient mythological religions such as those of ancient Greece and Northern regions. (He also loved science fiction, was a big fan of HG Wells and many of these other pulp science fiction writers of his day.)\n\nI bring this up because, as a Christian, the religious ideas of Barsoom are “anathema.” However some of them can point to actual truth. And I will say they do so, but in a round-about way.\n\nOf course everything they believe is a complete farce. There’s no truth to it beyond the fact that you won’t come back from a trip down the Iss. But there is no paradise. There is no happy ending. And the goddess Issus who is worshiped by the First Born is not beautiful, is not all-knowing, and is not powerful at all excepting the blind loyalty that her people give her. So what can we take from this religion that is true? Truth.\n\nIt mattered that their beliefs were false. It mattered that they didn’t know the truth, and John Carter knew that they should be told the truth. He knew the veil should be lifted from Barsoomian eyes and that they should know the truth. Jesus said you will know the truth and the truth will set you free. I’m not intending to go so far as to argue that Burroughs was attempting to illustrate this concept. I am just trying to say that the idea of the truth setting people free is fundamental and even a story about the fall of a false religion illustrates that concept, whether on purpose or not.\n\nLastly these ideals that are demonstrated and celebrated – reason, justice, courage and honor – are important. They are treasured throughout scripture and throughout the ancient and modern world. Justice and courage are two of the four ancient cardinal virtues. They take center stage.\n\nScience:\n\nAs in Princess there isn’t a lot of science here but there is some; lets start with the good. Primarily this comes in the form of basic planet science. Midway through the book our hero, John Carter, finds himself chained in a dark dungeon. He tries to keep track of the days he’s been there. He firmly believes his beloved Dejah Thoris to be a slave of Issus who will be killed at the end of one Barsoomian year. So he is counting the days. After roughly 350 days, he doubts he will ever see her again. But hold on! A Martian year is 668 Martian days (roughly). It seems, at first, that Burroughs is ignorant of this fact (and I was rolling my eyes at his lack of attention to detail). I considered this to be a point of bad science. But later in the book, John Carter comes to the realization that he has been counting down an earth year, not a Martian year. He is thrilled to be able to rescue his beloved – and he’s almost successful. So its John Carter’s clumsy science that Burroughs works into the plot.\n\nA Martian day is about the same amount of time as an Earth day – within an hour. But a Martian year is nearly twice as long as an Earth year. Another tidbit – there is about the same amount of land/total surface area on Mars as there is dry land surface area on Earth. Neat, right?\n\nSo this is an example of good science that contributes to the plot. That’s the attention to detail science fiction needs. But there is also the “radio-aerogram,” some form of ship-to-ship communication. The details are never delved. But this is a fairly primitive society, or it seems to be. There is no mention of other forms of tele-com technology. Its just out of place. My problem is not with radio communication. Its with radio communication in this society.\n\nAnd a couple paragraphs later, this: “a messenger arrived… we would be tried by an impartial body of nobles in the great hall of the temple at 1st zode on the following day, or about 8:40 A.M. Earth time.” I’m fine with the idea of Barsoom having its own methods of time-keeping. But the precise time has not been a factor in anything at all for the entire book (nor in the previous book). Its morning, day, evening, night. That’s it. Now we get this weird “1st zode” which he explains is “about” 8:40 in the morning. About? All this specificity all of a sudden… The goal – I assume – is to lend the story a more real “feel” by adding in the mundane. And hey, modernism was “a thing” at the time. So its OK except that it is out of place. It is clunky. It doesn’t fit this sword and sandal planetary romance genre.\n\nFatherhood:\n\nJohn Carter meets his son. This relationship is so flat in the book. Maybe that’s what a relationship should be when a young adult son meets his father who has been on a different planet his whole life. But Burroughs could have done something here with the father-son theme, and he does nothing. The narrator, John Carter, rarely describes Carthoris as “my son.” It is usually just a first name description. This is an aspect of the story that could have quite a pay-off. But it isn’t even attempted. Maybe in later books? I have my doubts but will read at least one more to find out.\n\nRace:\n\nRegarding race, Burroughs seems to be ahead of his time. He wrote while noted racist Woodrow Wilson resided in the White House, but Burroughs depicts people from different Barsoomian races uniting with a common cause and seeing each other as equals. Now that was not the common thinking on Barsoom, but that was John Carter’s thinking and it seems to be Burroughs’s ideal thinking. (I haven’t read Burroughs’s Tarzan fiction. I understand that its about a noble white European stranded in the heart of the African wilderness; I do not know if there are similar noble ideas of race in that series. I would like to know.) From Gods:\n\nIn that little party there was not one who would desert another; yet we were of different countries, different colours, different races, different religions – and one of us was of a different world.\n\nSo there you have it.\n\nCLOSING THOUGHTS\n\nTo read or not to read? If you have read A Princess of Mars, then certainly read this followup. Its better. The story is more fun. The mythology of Barsoom is more expansive. The four religious themes of John Carter are elaborated upon more. Its a fun read. Go for it. If you are looking for hard science fiction, this ain’t it. But you probably know that already from reading A Princess of Mars."
