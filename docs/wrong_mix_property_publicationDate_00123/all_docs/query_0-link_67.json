        "text": "Am fesiwn Gymraeg o’r erthygl yma, cliciwch yma.\n\nBack in 2012, a film called ‘John Carter’ was showing at the local cinema – and I wasn’t really very interested in going to see it. That was, however, because I had judged the film entirely on its name, which to me sounded like it might be about a historical, political figure. Then my husband pointed out that ‘John Carter’ was in fact the protagonist of the ‘Barsoom’ series of novels, by Edgar Rice Burroughs, with ‘Barsoom’ apparently being the name that the inhabitants of Mars use for their planet; so, this film was in fact science fiction. That got my attention.\n\nNow it’s fair to say that I’m really quite a massive science fiction fan: my twitter ID, ‘SerenSiwenna’, is based on a planet from Asimov’s ‘Foundation’ series of novels; our pet tortoise is named ‘Kahless’ after the messianic warrior of the Klingon Empire in Star Trek; and when we got married, our wedding cake was a replica of the tri-dimensional chess set as played by Kirk and Spock. So, it would seem that I ought to have been part of the likely crowd for going to see this film. However, crucially, I had not read the Barsoom series, nor was I even aware of them (quite why this was the case still baffles me).\n\nAnyway, we went to see the film and very much enjoyed it – and I can highly recommend it. John Carter is a visual feast of the science fiction kind, without being cartoon-like. This probably has something to do with the lavish production budget, which apparently contributed heavily to the total film cost of $350 million – making it one of the most expensive films ever made. However, it enjoyed only moderate success at the box office, at least in America – although it broke the all-time opening-day record in Russia.\n\nDue to the film’s poor box office performance, Disney cancelled any plans for a sequel. So where did it all go wrong? Well, whilst many have criticised the quality of various aspects of the film, as an onomastician and slightly astonished sci-fi fan, I am going to argue that it was mostly to do with the name. So, the question at the heart of this essay is: why did the producers of this film give it such an ambiguous, non-sci-fi identifiable name?\n\nA gendered element?\n\nThis film, John Carter, was planned as being the first of a trilogy. It was based on the first book in the Barsoom series, which was called ‘A Princess of Mars’. However, the film was initially going to be called ‘John Carter of Mars’. Even at this point, therefore, it is interesting to ponder why the emphasis shifted from the female character, ‘Princess Deja Thoris of Mars’, to the male character ‘John Carter’ – who is actually ‘of Earth’, Virginia in the USA. Though he later does become ‘John Carter of Mars’, it is noteworthy that author Edgar Rice Burroughs had given the first book Deja Thoris’ appellation, rather than John Carter’s. So, this might lead us to question: is there perhaps a gendered element to the (re)naming of this film?\n\nThere are obviously numerous alternative explanations we could offer here, maybe the ‘John Carter’ was silently implied in the original book titles: (John Carter and) a princess of Mars, and the subsequent books in which John Carter features: (John Carter and) the Gods of Mars/ Warlords of Mars/ Swords of Mars/ Llana of Gathol; however, the eleventh and final instalment, admittedly published posthumously thus perhaps subject to renaming, was actually called: John Carter of Mars.\n\nSo, it seems reasonably clear that Edgar Rice Burroughs meant the first book title to place Deja centre stage, and not without reason – she is a formidable character and clearly a forerunner of Princess Leia in the Star Wars universe. However, before my feminist rankling gets the better of me, I should say that in the film, Deja is portrayed as being strong, both physically and emotionally, as well as intelligent and accomplished. Played by the fabulous Lynn Collins, she is no shrinking violet and she is an excellent female role model. In fact, it could be argued that she is, at times, less damsel-in-distress than Leia and thus both pre-dates and out-does her…but that’s a different essay altogether; back to the awkward naming of the film in question – what could the filmmakers have done differently?\n\nLiterary linkages\n\nIn his article about the naming of serial novels (1992), onomastician Adrian Room points out that, whilst authors of serial novels inevitably have their devotees, many of whom will be awaiting the next instalment, authors will also be hoping to attract new readers who are not familiar with their prior work. Thus, whilst routine publicity and the author’s name might suffice to make the new title known, some authors like to title their new novels in such a way as to clearly link the books together – creating literary linkages.\n\nThese literary linkages may be signalled using a variety of devices, for example a theme – as in Agatha Christie’s Miss Marple stories: Murder at the Vicarage (1930), Body in the Library (1942) and so on. Meanwhile, Barsoom series author Edgar Rice Burroughs, in his previous Tarzan series, had opted for repeating the name of the protagonist in successive titles: Tarzan of the Apes (1914), The return of Tarzan (1915) and so on. Thus, as Room (1992) points out:\n\n“The repetition of a word, phrase, or name in a title is thus the obvious way to link novels in a series” (P124).\n\nFurthermore, Room concludes:\n\n“Whatever the series, such titles give a clear signal that the devoted reader can expect “more of the same”, and so plunge in accordingly” (P128).\n\nI would add here that, for the new reader, or in the case of the film adaptation, potential audience members, the repetition of a word which gives some clue as to the genre of the film is an obvious way to attract potential fans to this new offering. So, if this film had been called ‘John Carter of Mars’, or indeed had simply had ‘Mars’ in the title, I would, as an avid sci-fi fan, have immediately been alerted to its presence – it would have been on my nerd-radar and my ‘must-see’ list.\n\nThe issue of the film makers having chosen not to use such literary linkages, is rendered all the more baffling when we consider that Edgar Rice Burroughs took such care with the naming of his fiction and in creating such literary linkages. Indeed, as onomastician John R. Kruger (1966) comments:\n\n“It would be possible, for instance, to study the names created by individual authors (many of whom are very prolific under several names) as, say, Edgar Rice Burroughs, who, in spite of the dismal quality of many of his swashbuckling adventures, has a considerable degree of linguistic sophistication” (P211).\n\nFurthermore, citing an underlying pattern which is discernible in Burroughs’ work, Kruger (1966) comments:\n\n“I have noted two attempts to systematize the planets in our own solar system. The first is Edgar R. Burroughs’ Barsoom (Mars), Rasoom (Mercury), Cosoom (Venus) and Jasoom (Earth), which are, by the way, just scattered throughout his works” (P212).\n\nSo, given that the author of the original works operated such careful, strategic and precise literary linkages, we must turn our investigations to the context and timing of the film adaptation for answers. For example, in 2009, so prior to the film in question, there had been a (much lower budget) film adaptation of the first book – which went direct-to-DVD. This was initially titled: ‘Princess of Mars’ and then it was retitled and re-released in 2012 as ‘John Carter of Mars’; in Europe it was released with the title ‘The Martian Colony Wars’.\n\nThis was not a particularly successful adaptation and Andrew Stanton, director of the version of the ‘John Carter’ film we are concerned with here, is reported to have made derogatory comments regarding this previous version. Thus, we might speculate that Andrew Stanton’s naming of his film, ‘John Carter’, might have been influenced somewhat by a desire to put some distance between his new version and the 2009 version.\n\nThe golden age of the ‘super-hero origin’ film\n\nBased on the first book of the series, ‘A Princess of Mars’, ‘John Carter’ was originally titled ‘John Carter of Mars’. However, director Andrew Stanton reportedly removed the ‘of Mars’ to make it more appealing to a broader audience, stating that the film is an: “origin story. It’s about a guy becoming John Carter of Mars”. Stanton had intended to add the ‘of Mars’ to future films in the series. This view was echoed by actor Taylor Kitsch, who played John Carter, when he reportedly stated that the title was changed to reflect the character’s journey, as John Carter would become “of Mars only in the last few minutes of the picture”.\n\nArtistically, then, this makes good sense and the logic is sound – it reminds me of what was said about the music in the most recent adaptation of ‘Casino Royale’ (2006). Apparently, a song called “you know my name” (the irony!) was composed and played as the title song, with some of the main notes played throughout the film, as a substitute for the usual James Bond theme tune; this was to represent Bond’s youth and inexperience. The classic theme only played during the end credits to signal the climax of his character arc.\n\nHowever, this was, of course, within the context of a film bearing the title of Ian Fleming’s first book, within the series of ‘Bond’ thrillers, which went on to spawn a franchise of ‘Bond films’ – a brand well-known to audiences across the globe. This was a reboot of a much more recent adaptation and so we, as an audience, could accept the deviation in music, and other details, because we were already invested in the film and were getting enough of the “more of the same” as mentioned by Adrian Room above, to be satisfied.\n\nWhilst there were many superhero-origin movies at this time, most did not risk going with just the name of the protagonist, despite being backed by a large franchise and being within a self-contained fictional universe with a large fan-base, examples include: X-men origins: Wolverine (2008) and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011). On the other hand, some did opt for simply using the charactonym where these were indicative of the character’s traits; examples include: Green Lantern (2011) and The Green Hornet (2011).\n\nA couple of exceptions one might allude to include: Thor (2011) and Kick-Ass (2010), however these do have the advantage over ‘John Carter’ of being either other-worldy (and at least related to Fantasy or Mythology) or, in the case of ‘Kick-ass’, unusual enough to pique the curiosity of the potential audience.\n\nMore recent origin films have been bold in their use of charactonyms, including the recent global hit ‘Black Panther’ (2018) and ‘Logan’ (2017). Whilst ‘Black Panther’ is a charactonym, it is by now a reasonably well-known one because it has appeared in the massively popular ‘Marvel’ films. ‘Logan’ is a riskier title, though it is a reasonably unusual name in the English language, compared with ‘John’, and has some other possible sci-fi connotations, for example connections with ‘Logan’s run’ (1976). We have now, thus, come to the question of why authors create particular charactonyms and toponyms, and what they are likely hoping to achieve with them.\n\nMapping the onymic landscape – the function and typology of names\n\nIn a chapter on literary onomastics, Falck-Kjӓllquist (2016) explains that names in this context may have a variety of functions:\n\n“In the non-fictional, and fictional worlds, names primarily function as identifiers. However, in fiction, names may also be created by the author to function as tools for characterizing different entities such as people, places, landscapes, or artefacts, and thus create the ‘onymic landscape” (Falck-Kjӓllquist, 2016, Kindle location: 7896).\n\nSo, thinking about Burroughs’ creation of an ‘onymic landscape’ for his Martian-based fiction, we might say that, whereas almost all the characters in the story have names which index as ‘Martian’, or ‘Barsoomian’, by sounding other than English, as in ‘Deja Thoris’, the name ‘John Carter’ unmistakably indexes as Earthly, through indexing as ‘English’, or ‘Anglo-American’. I personally think that this was a deliberate strategy by Burroughs, deployed in order to distinguish John’s origins as being other than ‘Barsoomian’.\n\nTherefore, the trouble is that: without his appellation ‘of Mars’, ‘John Carter’ does not index for science fiction, which is a shame for marketing purposes outside of the story and its fictional universe. I would thus argue strongly here that there was certainly a business case for utilizing the literary toponomy to supply plausible links with the genre for the new audience members, i.e. those who had not read the books. Burroughs had clearly decided that ‘Mars’ was a better option than ‘Barsoom’, despite this being the fictional Martian name for the planet in the story. I would argue that this was a pragmatic marketing choice on his part, designed to capture the attention of the general science fiction fan.\n\nAn anti-Martian climate?\n\nAnother explanation which has been put forward for the renaming of the film, with the deliberate omission of the word ‘Mars’, is that, at the time, Disney had suffered a significant loss in March 2011 with ‘Mars Needs Moms’; the studio had then reportedly conducted a study which noted recent movies with the word ‘Mars’ in the title had not been commercially successful. This is interesting and suggests a context in which perhaps ‘Mars’ in the title might be off-putting to audiences – well, some audiences.\n\nHowever, as a hard-core sci-fi fan, I can honestly say that having ‘Mars’ in the title of a film will always attract my attention, rather than putting me off in any way – regardless of current trends. However, ‘Mars Needs Moms’ does not sound like a sci-fi film, or the kind of film I am ever likely to want to see, and not because it has ‘Mars’ in the title. Having looked it up, it is apparently:\n\n“A computer-animated motion-capture science fiction adventure family film”.\n\nI must say that, having read this, it does sound less terrible that I had originally suspected based purely on the name. However, I would still argue, if you’ll pardon the pun, that it is still a world away, from films like ‘John Carter’, and thus should perhaps not enter into the considerations regarding naming this film.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion I would say, that I can understand the reasoning behind naming the film after (arguably) the main protagonist. I can also see why this might be thought to be ‘John Carter’. However, if we look back to the author’s original naming of the first book, it is clear that Burroughs may have had other ideas. If there was a problem with naming the film after the book ‘A Princess of Mars’, due to a previous version having been called this, then perhaps one of the names which indexed as ‘Barsoomian’ and other-than English, such as ‘Deja Thoris’, would have been a good option.\n\nAs Falck-Kjӓllquist (2016) points out (citing Thies 1978:357) to become meaningful, realistic and neutral names, such as ‘John Carter’, need the support of information and situations given in the text, and of audience associations coming from the socio-cultural context. When names have aquired meaning in such a way, they can be decoded as charactonyms as well (Falck-Kjӓllquist, 2016). This is an interesting point as fans of the books who were able to decode ‘John Carter’ as a charactonym, may have enjoyed this sense of being part of a sub-cultural group, and of having the required ‘cultural capital’ to know that ‘John Carter’ was from the Barsoomian universe. However, in commercial terms, this group was not large enough, and the title could not be decoded by the general science fiction fan in sufficient numbers to make this gamble pay off.\n\nAlternatively, drawing on the entire ‘onymic landscape’ of the fictional universe created by Burroughs, perhaps ‘Barsoom’ might have worked well. Certainly, this would have been other-worldly enough to make me suspect science fiction – which would have led me to seek further information. The easiest way would have been to go with the original literary-linkage of using ‘of Mars’ in the title, recognizing that ‘Mars’ and science fiction were always going to be a part of this film and would need, at some point, to be accepted by any potential audience member.\n\nIn any case, I, for one, am sad that ‘John Carter’ never really gained the audience or recognition that it deserved. I am sad that the sequels were never made. However, as an onomastician, I have found it fruitful and enjoyable to ponder the role of this film’s name in its success, or lack thereof.\n\nAccording to Falck-Kjӓllquist (2016), literary onomastics, which includes cinema films, is a comparatively new field in the sphere of onomastics, and there are several theoretical, as well as practical, problems connected with the investigation of cinema films – including the fact that many are adaptations from other mediums, such as novels. I therefore hope that this essay will contribute towards this emerging field of research within the sphere of onomastics.\n\nReferences\n\nFalck-Kjӓllquist, B. (2016).
