        "meta_description": "The Gods of Mars is a science fiction novel written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, first published in 1918. It is the second book in the Barsoom series, which follows the adventures of John Carter, a former Confederate soldier who is mysteriously transported to Mars (known as Barsoom to its inhabitants). In this sequel, John Carter returns to Mars after a ten-year absence, only to find that his beloved Dejah Thoris, the princess of Helium, has been kidnapped by the evil Therns. He embarks on a perilous journey to rescue her, encountering new and dangerous creatures along the way, including the savage white apes and the monstrous plant men. As he travels deeper into the Martian wilderness, John Carter discovers that the planet is not as he remembers it. He encounters a new race of beings, the Black Martians, who are at war with the Red Martians, and learns of a secret cult that worships the ancient gods of Mars. With the help of his old friend Tars Tarkas and a new ally, the Red Martian warrior Xodar, John Carter battles his way through the treacherous Martian landscape to reach the Temple of the Sun, where Dejah Thoris is being held captive. But even if he can rescue her, he must still face the wrath of the powerful and vengeful Therns, who will stop at nothing to destroy him. The Gods of Mars is a thrilling and action-packed adventure that explores the mysteries of Mars and the complex politics and cultures of its inhabitants. It is a classic of science fiction and a must-read for fans of the genre.As I stood upon the bluff before my cottage on that clear cold night in the early part of March, 1886, the noble Hudson flowing like the grey and silent spectre of a dead river below me, I felt again the strange, compelling influence of the mighty god of war, my beloved Mars, which for ten long and lonesome years I had implored with outstretched arms to carry me back to my lost love.This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations. Because we believe this work is culturally important, we have made it available as part of our commitment for protecting, preserving, and promoting the world's literature in affordable, high quality, modern editions, that are true to their original work.",
