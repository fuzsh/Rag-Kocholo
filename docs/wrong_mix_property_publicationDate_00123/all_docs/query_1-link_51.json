He would go on to become one of the most prolific and imaginative writers of the early 20th century, creating iconic characters and worlds that have left an indelible mark on popular culture. Burroughs' early life was marked by various pursuits, including time spent working in his father's business, serving in the U.S. Cavalry, and working as a gold miner in Idaho. However, it was his foray into writing that would define his legacy.\n\nIn 1912, at the age of 36, Burroughs published his first novel, A Princess of Mars. This marked the beginning of his career as a writer of speculative fiction. The novel introduced readers to John Carter, a Confederate veteran who finds himself mysteriously transported to Mars (Barsoom), where he embarks on grand adventures and encounters exotic creatures and civilizations. The success of A Princess of Mars spurred Burroughs to create an entire series known as the Barsoom series, which included titles like The Gods of Mars (1913) and The Warlord of Mars (1914). The series established Burroughs as a master of the planetary romance genre, characterized by swashbuckling adventures set on other worlds.\n\nIn 1914, Burroughs introduced another iconic character with Tarzan of the Apes. Tarzan, the orphaned son of English aristocrats raised by African apes, became one of literature's most enduring and recognizable characters. The success of Tarzan led to a series of novels, films, and various adaptations that continue to captivate audiences worldwide. Burroughs' ability to create vivid and imaginative worlds extended beyond Barsoom and the jungles of Africa. He crafted other notable series, including the Pellucidar series, set in a subterranean world, and the Caspak series, featuring a mysterious island inhabited by prehistoric creatures.\n\nDespite facing financial challenges at various points in his life, Burroughs maintained a prolific writing career. His works, often characterized by adventure, romance, and a sense of wonder, resonated with readers across generations. In addition to his science fiction and fantasy novels, Burroughs wrote in other genres, including westerns and historical fiction. Edgar Rice Burroughs continued to write and create until his passing on March 19, 1950. His legacy endures through the continued popularity of his creations, the influence of his storytelling on subsequent generations of writers and filmmakers, and the lasting impact of characters like Tarzan and John Carter on the cultural landscape.\n\nAmong Edgar Rice Burroughs' books are Tarzan of the Apes (1914), The Son of Tarzan (1917), The Gods of Mars (1918), Pirates of Venus (1934, Tarzan and the Forbidden City (1938), Tarzan the Magnificent (1939), The Land of Terror (1944), Liana of Gathol (1948) and countless more books. The Easton Press published a number of Edgar Rice Burroughs books as leather bound editions. They include At Earth's Core and Princess of Mars, a six volume collection of Tarzan Books, and a five volume collection of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars Tales.\n\nTarzan of the Apes\n\n1888 W Africa. Newlyweds Lord and Lady Greystoke are marooned by mutineers. He builds a snug cabin for their growing family.\n\nBut disaster falls. Great Apes raise the small son, destined to be Lord of the Jungle.\n\n\"Tarzan of the Apes\" is an adventure novel written by Edgar Rice Burroughs, first published in 1912. The story follows the life of John Clayton, who was born to aristocratic parents on the west coast of Africa but orphaned after his parents are killed by a group of apes. He is then raised by the apes and becomes known as Tarzan. Tarzan grows up in the jungle, learns the ways of the animals, and develops incredible physical abilities. The book chronicles his journey as he tries to reconcile his human nature with his life among the apes and eventually meets and falls in love with Jane Porter, a young American woman. The novel has become a classic of popular culture and has been adapted into numerous films, television series, and other media.\n\nThe Return of Tarzan\n\nTarzan hides his inheritance as an English lord, because he believes his cousin William Cecil Clayton would make a better lord and husband for his beloved Jane. He is distracted by a married Russian countess, whose criminal brother Nicholas Rokoff is a real villain for the series. Tarzan is set up for attack by a dozen Paris muggers.\n\nThe Beasts of Tarzan\n\nTarzan is exiled by Russian villain Nikolas Rokoff to a wild African island. He enlists the help of a panther and tribe of Great Apes to reach the mainland. He believes Rokoff has kidnapped his wife and infant son.\n\nThe Son of Tarzan\n\nAlexis Paulvitch, one of Tarzan's enemies, wants to get even, so he draws Tarzan's son, Jack, away from London, but Jack isn't so easy to capture and kill. He escapes, and makes a home among the apes as his father did. He becomes known as Korak the Killer, and meets a lovely young woman named Meriem. Narrow escapes, fun action, and a definite sense of adventure in the wilds of Africa make this a must-read book.\n\nThe Jewels of Opar\n\nBankrupt Tarzan returns to Opar with Waziri guards.Tarzan injures his head in a fight and loses his memory. La, high priestess for the Flaming God, follows guarded by degenerate bestial priests and sacrificial knives. She has wanted the forest god since their first meeting, lust/love conflicts with anger. Meanwhile Arabs attack, massacre Waziri, kidnap Jane.\n\nJungle Tales of Tarzan\n\nGlorious tales of Tarzan’s early growth to manhood in the forest...\n\nTarzan, the heart of primeval Africa, escapes death on the horn of Buto the rhinoceros, saves the life of Tantor the elephant, sends the witchdoctor Bukawai to a terrible death, battle victoriously with his arch-enemy Numa the Lion, and slowly but surely fights his way to a mastery of his savage, unforgiving jungle.\n\nA Princess of Mars - Barsoom Series Book 1\n\nA Princess of Mars is the first of eleven thrilling novels that comprise Edgar Rice Burroughs' most exciting saga, known as The Martian Series. It's the beginning of an incredible odyssey in which John Carter, a gentleman from Virginia and a Civil War veteran, unexpectedly finds himself on to the red planet, scene of continuing combat among rival tribes. Captured by a band of six-limbed, green-skinned savage giants called Tharks, Carter soon is accorded all the honor of a chieftain after it's discovered that his muscles, accustomed to Earth's greater gravity, now give him a decided advantage in strength. And when his captors take as prisoner Dejah Thoris, the lovely human-looking princess of the city of Helium, Carter must call upon every ounce of strength, courage, and ingenuity to rescue her-before Dejah becomes the slave of the depraved Thark leader, Tal Hajus!\n\nHer oval face was beautiful in the extreme, her every feature finely chisled and exquisite, her eyes large and lustrous and her head surmounted by a mass of coal black, waving hair, caught loosely into a strange yet becoming coiffure. Similar in face and figure to women of Earth, she was nevertheless a true Martian and prisoner of the fierce green giants who held me captive, as well!"
