        "text": "The Gods of Mars is a 1918 Edgar Rice Burroughs science fantasy book, the second of his famous Barsoom series. It was first published in All-Story as a five-part serial in the issues for JanuaryâMay 1913. Â Â It was later published as a complete novel by A. C. McClurg in September, 1918.Â Â\n\nAt the conclusion of the first book, A Princess of Mars, John Carter is unwillingly transported back to Earth. The Gods of Mars begins with his arrival back on Barsoom (Mars) after a ten-year separation from his wife Dejah Thoris, his unborn child, and the Red Martian people of the nation of Helium, whom he has adopted as his own. Unfortunately, Carter materializes in the one place on Barsoom from which nobody is allowed to depart: the Valley Dor, which is the Barsoomian afterlife.\n\nAfter John Carter's arrival, a boat of Green Martians on the River Iss are ambushed by the previously unknown Plant Men. The lone survivor is his friend Tars Tarkas, the Jeddak of Thark, who has taken the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor to find Carter. Having saved their own lives, Carter and Tars Tarkas discover that the Therns, a white-skinned race of self-proclaimed gods, have for eons deceived the Barsoomians elsewhere by disseminating that the pilgrimage to the Valley Dor is a journey to paradise. Most arrivals are killed by the savages of Valley, and the survivors enslaved or eaten by Therns.\n\nThis edition has been formatted for your reader, with an active table of contents.Â It has also been annotated, with additional information about The Gods of Mars and also Edgar Rice Burroughs, including an overview, introduction, plot summary, writing, publication, themes, characters, biographical and bibliographical information."
