Edgar Rice Burroughs biographyEdgar Rice Burroughs

Edgar Rice Burroughs, a pioneering American author, was born on September 1, 1875, in Chicago, Illinois. He would go on to become one of the most prolific and imaginative writers of the early 20th century, creating iconic characters and worlds that have left an indelible mark on popular culture. Burroughs' early life was marked by various pursuits, including time spent working in his father's business, serving in the U.S. Cavalry, and working as a gold miner in Idaho. However, it was his foray into writing that would define his legacy.

In 1912, at the age of 36, Burroughs published his first novel, A Princess of Mars. This marked the beginning of his career as a writer of speculative fiction. The novel introduced readers to John Carter, a Confederate veteran who finds himself mysteriously transported to Mars (Barsoom), where he embarks on grand adventures and encounters exotic creatures and civilizations. The success of A Princess of Mars spurred Burroughs to create an entire series known as the Barsoom series, which included titles like The Gods of Mars (1913) and The Warlord of Mars (1914). The series established Burroughs as a master of the planetary romance genre, characterized by swashbuckling adventures set on other worlds.

In 1914, Burroughs introduced another iconic character with Tarzan of the Apes. Tarzan, the orphaned son of English aristocrats raised by African apes, became one of literature's most enduring and recognizable characters. The success of Tarzan led to a series of novels, films, and various adaptations that continue to captivate audiences worldwide. Burroughs' ability to create vivid and imaginative worlds extended beyond Barsoom and the jungles of Africa. He crafted other notable series, including the Pellucidar series, set in a subterranean world, and the Caspak series, featuring a mysterious island inhabited by prehistoric creatures.

Despite facing financial challenges at various points in his life, Burroughs maintained a prolific writing career. His works, often characterized by adventure, romance, and a sense of wonder, resonated with readers across generations. In addition to his science fiction and fantasy novels, Burroughs wrote in other genres, including westerns and historical fiction. Edgar Rice Burroughs continued to write and create until his passing on March 19, 1950. His legacy endures through the continued popularity of his creations, the influence of his storytelling on subsequent generations of writers and filmmakers, and the lasting impact of characters like Tarzan and John Carter on the cultural landscape.

Among Edgar Rice Burroughs' books are Tarzan of the Apes (1914), The Son of Tarzan (1917), The Gods of Mars (1918), Pirates of Venus (1934, Tarzan and the Forbidden City (1938), Tarzan the Magnificent (1939), The Land of Terror (1944), Liana of Gathol (1948) and countless more books. The Easton Press published a number of Edgar Rice Burroughs books as leather bound editions.

A Princess of Mars - Barsoom Series Book 1

A Princess of Mars is the first of eleven thrilling novels that comprise Edgar Rice Burroughs' most exciting saga, known as The Martian Series. It's the beginning of an incredible odyssey in which John Carter, a gentleman from Virginia and a Civil War veteran, unexpectedly finds himself on to the red planet, scene of continuing combat among rival tribes. Captured by a band of six-limbed, green-skinned savage giants called Tharks, Carter soon is accorded all the honor of a chieftain after it's discovered that his muscles, accustomed to Earth's greater gravity, now give him a decided advantage in strength. And when his captors take as prisoner Dejah Thoris, the lovely human-looking princess of the city of Helium, Carter must call upon every ounce of strength, courage, and ingenuity to rescue her-before Dejah becomes the slave of the depraved Thark leader, Tal Hajus!

Her oval face was beautiful in the extreme, her every feature finely chisled and exquisite, her eyes large and lustrous and her head surmounted by a mass of coal black, waving hair, caught loosely into a strange yet becoming coiffure. Similar in face and figure to women of Earth, she was nevertheless a true Martian and prisoner of the fierce green giants who held me captive, as well!
