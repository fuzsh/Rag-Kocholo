Edgar Rice Burroughs Books and Movies

Edgar Rice Burroughs (September 1, 1875 - March 19, 1950) was an American adventure novelist, a creator of the world famous character of Tarzan. Interestingly, Burroughs tried himself in many different professions. Before becoming full-time writer, he was working, among other, as a railroad policeman, a manager of a stenographic department at Sears, Roebuck and Company, a partner of an advertising agency, an office manager.

His first published fiction work was a "Dejah Thoris, Princess of Mars'" in a 1912 issue of an All-Story Magazine. And the first Tarzan novel, the "Tarzan of the Apes" was released in 1912.

Edgar Rice Burroughs written ninety-four novels, twenty-seven of which were about Tarzan. Currently there have been sixty-two different film adaptations where Tarzan is the main character.

"The Lad and the Lion" (1917) was the first silent film adaptation of Burroughs' story. One year later, "Tarzan of the Apes" became the second Burroughs' novel made into silent film and the first Tarzan movie picture.
