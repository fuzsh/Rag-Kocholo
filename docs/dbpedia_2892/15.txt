Privilege Ibiza is the world’s biggest club. And, of course, it had to be in Ibiza! It started as KU. It was famous for the impressive swimming pool it had in the center of its Main Room and the Manumission party, a session with sexually explicit live shows that lasted for more than a decade. Today, it is still one of Ibiza’s nightlife highlights for the parties, the DJ’s, the great performances and its immensity. It is a venue with a total capacity of 10.000 people!
