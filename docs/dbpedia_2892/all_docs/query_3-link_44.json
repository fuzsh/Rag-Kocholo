        "text": "BEST MONTH TO TRAVEL: July\n\nCOUNTRY TO VISIT: Spain\n\nSpain is famous for its easy-going culture, delicious food and stunning scenery. Major cities such as Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia all offer unique traditions, languages, and must-see sites! Vibrant festivals such as La Fallas and La Tomatina draw huge crowds of both locals and tourists. Barcelona is famous for its outstanding football team, stunning architecture, lively nightlife, sandy beaches, and world-class cuisine. Not to mention a vibrant cultural heritage and colourful neighbourhood festivals that attract visitors from around the world. The culture in Spain is unique, the Spanish are very welcoming, and the country is known for its exotic beaches and lots of sunshine. Spain is also called the land of bullfighting because bullfighting is a very popular sport in Spain. This also goes to show the global reach of the Spanish culture.\n\nCITY –IBIZA\n\nIbiza is widely known for its wild nightlife, but there is also plenty of other exciting things to do during the day. From the history of Ibiza Town, across breath-taking view from Sa Talaiassa to the sandy beaches of Cala Llenya, Ibiza is an island that is well worth a visit.\n\nIbiza is known for the variety of its nightlife and if anything can be assumed, it’s that you’re going to have some fun. From world famous nightclubs to private parties where fun is guaranteed. Yet, it’s not all about parties; there are also lots of daytime activities to enjoy such as handicraft markets for example.\n\nHOTELS\n\nSIX SENSES\n\nSince the 1950s, Ibiza has attracted a certain type of free-spirited seeker; artists, creatives, musicians, and mystics who have all made their homes on this dazzling white rock. Drawn by the beauty, the light, and the natural rhythms of Ibiza’s seasons, many have chosen to settle in the north, where a strong community spirit and ‘live-and-let-live’ attitude hark back to Ibiza’s traditional past.\n\nCAVE ROYALE\n\nThe Ultimate luxury retreat in ibiza\n\nThe Cave Royale is the pulse of the resort’s effortless free-spirited, Ibizan festival vibe, paying homage to the bohemian music and art scene associated with the island. Enjoy an expansive indoor and outdoor living space plus a secret door that leads to the recording studio below for when creativity strikes even in the middle of the night!\n\nNOBU HOTEL IBIZA BAY\n\nNobu Hotel Ibiza Bay is ideally positioned on the shores of Talamanca Bay. Away from the hustle and bustle, step from the hotel straight onto the soft sandy beach – or your yacht. With the beach promenade right outside your door, in a short walk you will be wandering through the trendy boutiques and restaurants of Marina Botafoch and Ibiza old town.\n\nROOF TOP JUNIOR SUITE\n\nRooftop Junior Suites offer the ideal setting for a loft feel living, stone-coloured floors continue to the spacious furnished terrace that has a staircase taking you to your own rooftop terrace, where you can enjoy a refreshing drink or a dip in your own rooftop whirlpool hot tub.\n\nLavish entrance ways lead to expansive dressing areas and living rooms. Offering a fresh interpretation of the Ibizan aesthetic, suites are designed using a natural colour palette of whites, golds, aqua and blues. Thoughtful details like hand-blown pendant lights and local artwork reflect the spirit of the island.\n\nThe Persian marble bathroom offers a natural stone deep soaking bathtub with and a separate rain-fall shower.\n\n7 PINES RESORT\n\n7Pines Resort Ibiza nestles in a pine grove on the cliffs of the west coast of Ibiza between Cala Conta and Cala Codolar.\n\nWith unobstructed views of the Mediterranean Sea and the magical rocky island of Es Vedrà, it is a truly unique location on the white isle and a prime vantage point to enjoy a memorable sunset.\n\nCLIFF SUITE SEA VIEW DUPLEX DELUXE\n\nAvailable exclusively upon request, The Penthouse situated beautifully atop The Setai’s soaring Ocean Suites, embodying the pinnacle of luxury and excellence and spanning the entire 40th floor.

Instead, attractions for kids are a little more low-key and nature oriented.\n\nOn the outskirts of Ibiza Town is Horse Valley, a stables that rescues mistreated horses and ponies and organized a range of excursions around the rugged northern region of the island. For some action on four wheels there are also go-karting tracks at both San Antonio and Santa Eulalia\n\nISLAND OF ES VEDRA\n\nThis uninhabited island off the southwest coast of Ibiza is protected as a natural park. You can get there by boat from San Antonio or Ibiza Town, while the water sports centers around the island organize jet-ski tours or snorkeling excursions here.\n\nIt’s a beautiful, almost otherworldly place; a rugged island with a monolithic slab of sheer limestone that crests at 413 meters.\n\nClimb ashore and bring your camera to capture the drama of the landscapes and the wildlife including goats, lizards and falcons.\n\nDALT VILA UNESCO SITE\n\nThe highest and oldest part of Ibiza Town is guarded by strong renaissance fortifications built by Charles V in the 16th century. The walls were constructed to fend off the threat of attacks by Berber pirates as well as invasion by sovereign forces like the French.\n\nIt’s well worth taking a little tour of the fortifications to check out the seven bastions, each with a slightly different story to tell. The Santa Lucía bastion for instance houses an 18th-century powder magazine and commands fabulous vistas over the old fishing district and the harbor.\n\nTALAMANCA\n\nIf you’re based in Ibiza Town and fancy a quieter day at the beach, then couple of minutes up from the marina is another of the island’s largest beaches.\n\nHere there’s a wide sweep of snow-white sand backed by low-density development. The scenery around Talamanca is made up of small, pine-cloaked hills and the small holiday community of Cap Martinet.\n\nRight on the beach are great little places to eat, serving Balearic culinary favorites like bullit de peix or more cosmopolitan options. The beach is tucked deep between two headlands, so the waters are gentle and child-friendly.\n\nPRODUCTS\n\nIBIZA SALT\n\nThe island has been producing high-quality sea salt for millennia and anyone who has driven through the Ses Salines nature reserve has marvelled at the mountain of salt piled up waiting for processing. Sal de Ibiza salt comes in duck-egg blue ceramic containers with a cork lid and tiny porcelain spoon, making it one of the most elegant and useful souvenirs to take home with you.\n\nIBIZA CHILI CO.\n\nBrainchild of local chef and raconteur Sid Shanti, Ibiza Chili Co. has four signature hot sauce flavours ranging from mild to Molotov. Their three-pack travel size selection is perfect for those who like to have their hot sauce on hand at all times and the spiced chocolates are the perfect after-dinner treat.\n\nOLIVE OIL\n\nThere are several producers of high quality, cold-pressed, virgin olive oil on the island, each producing bottles and tins of various sizes. Fragrant and rich, the local olive oil is delicious on salads, grilled vegetables and even just poured directly onto crusty artisanal bread. If you’re in the market for olive oil, one of the best places to try it is Ses Escoles – a gorgeous restaurant located on the Can Miquel Guasch olive grove (on the San Juan restaurant road) where you can try before you buy.\n\nJEWELLERY\n\nOf the many jewellers operating on the island, Natasha Collis in San Miguel and Majoral in Ibiza town offer the most authentic and artistic take on Ibiza via the mediums of gold, silver and precious stones. Collis’ cute workshop and showroom near the San Miguel church contains a beautiful collection inspired by her adopted homeland.\n\nBASKET\n\nDespite their ubiquity across the island, the traditional hand-woven shopping baskets sported by everybody never go out of fashion. Not only are these deep bags with leather handles useful they are also super stylish and as much at home on the beach as they are on the streets of London. Get yours plain or find one embellished with tassels, pom-poms and sequins. They even come in kids’ sizes for the mini-fashionistas in your life.\n\nTRADITIONAL CUISINE\n\nIbizan cuisine is slowly making a mark in the culinary world. Since this tourist island is often frequented by travelers from all over the world, a delightful gastronomic culture has developed in the past few years, characterized mainly by the use of fresh, local ingredients.\n\nSOFRIT PAGES\n\nThis traditional Balearic stew is a hearty mixture of various meats like chicken, lamb, and the Ibizan sausages sobrassada and botifarra. There are also vegetables like potatoes, peppers, and artichokes. Ibizan cuisine is known for its seafood specialties, and this meat dish is traditionally served only during special occasions. However, sofrit pagés is now available in almost every restaurant that serves traditional Ibizan cuisine.\n\nBALEARIC SAUSAGES SOBRASSADA AND BOTIFARRA\n\nMeat sausages native to the Balearic Islands are typically mixed in with other dishes, or eaten on its own as an appetizer. Sobrassada, dubbed as the national sausage of the islands, is made from ground pork, paprika and other spices. Botifarra is an ancient recipe, an Ibizan version of a blood sausage with spices.\n\nPAELLAS DE MARISCO\n\nWhen directly translated, Paella de Marisc means “seafood paella” in Catalan. Each region in Spain have their own version of paella, and the seafood ingredients of this paella come fresh from the bounty of the sea surrounding the island of Ibiza. The restaurant Cala Es Xarcu, run by a husband and wife team native to the islands, is famous for their seafood paella. The restaurant is a 20 minute drive from Ibiza town, and when you taste their food, you will realize that it is worth the drive.\n\nPARILLADE DE PESCADO\n\nParrillada de Pescado is a Mixed Seafood Grill, which is typically served in beachside restaurants. The day’s catch is what comprises the dish, which is grilled on the same day and served to customers. Aside from local fish varieties such as bacalao (cod), mero (grouper), and rodaballo (turbot), prawns, squid, lobster, and octopus are also grilled.\n\nZARZUELA\n\nAnother popular traditional Ibizan dish is zarzuela de mariscos, an Ibizan seafood stew, with a mixture of shellfish like mussels, crabs, scallops, and prawns, with squid and various types of fish. It is cooked in a saffron-flavored stock, usually mixed with lemon juice and bay leaf. It is named after the Spanish word for comic opera or also loosely translated as “variety show”. This means that eating it evokes a symphony of flavors all mixed up together in one delightful dish.\n\nPARTY PLACES\n\nO BEACH IBIZA\n\nO Beach Ibiza delivers stylish, decadent pool parties on a daily basis ever since and as a result has become a “must-visit” for anyone wanting to pop open the champagne, down the Grey Goose or Ciroc Vodka and recline on a VIP bed or simply splash around dancing in the pool – all while soaking up the mid-afternoon Balearic sun.\n\nBENIMUSSA PARK\n\nHome to the world-famous Zoo Project parties, Benimussa Park is unique on the island. The lifelong memories of many clubbers are made here. Essentially, if al fresco partying, fancy dress and quality electronic music is your bag, you will love this. That’ll be all of us, then.\n\nA young, British crowd tends to make up the bulk of the Zoo parties, although don’t expect the music to play it safe. Bookers here are known for providing their audiences with leftfield, quality underground House and Techno.\n\nPRIVILEGE, IBIZA\n\nOf course the ‘World’s Biggest Club’ is on Ibiza, but even such an accolade doesn’t prepare you for the scale of what you’re facing with Privilege. With a Main Room like an aircraft hangar – it could fit the whole of most of the other clubs in Ibiza inside it – Privilege has become renowned for providing the spectacular and grandiose, like no other can.\n\nUSHUAIA, IBIZA\n\nUshuaïa Ibiza has been a shining star in Playa d’en Bossa since its opening in 2011. Located on the main Bossa promenade, this hotel offers stylish accommodation and an exciting events program that boasts some of the biggest names in mainstream electronic music.\n\nUshuaïa made a name for itself by championing big-name DJs, and by blowing the competition out of the water with its stage production, glamorous dancers and fantastically placed VIP section. In a few short years, it secured its place as one of the most famous venues on Ibiza.\n\nCOVID TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS\n\nUnvaccinated visitors from India must present a negative RT-PCR (NAAT) or Antigen (quick-test) test taken within 72 hours for RT-PCR (NAAT) and 24 hours for Antigen (quick-test) before departing to Spain.\n\nFully vaccinated visitors with approved vaccination certificates do not need to present a negative COVID-19 test."
