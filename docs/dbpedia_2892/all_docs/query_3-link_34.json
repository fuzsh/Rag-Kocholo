        "text": "Off the south-west coast of Ibiza stands Es Vedrà, a 400m-high limestone rock which legend suggests was the island of the Sirens who lured sailors to their deaths in Homer's Odyssey. Since early history, Ibiza itself has attracted hedonists and freedom-seekers, from the Carthaginians in 654BC, to the hippies of the 1960s, to the clubbers of more recent times.\n\nAs Stephen Armstrong wrote in his history, The White Island: \"Over the centuries, virtually every culture around the Mediterranean has used the island either as a playground or as a dump for the kind of people who didn't quite fit in back home, but who you'd probably quite like to meet at a party.\"\n\nNow, following the clubbing explosion at the end of the 80s and two subsequent decades of partying, fatigue was setting in, with many clubbers put off by expensive tickets and the decline of the free party scene. But Ibiza has an unerring ability to reinvent itself. Invigorated by a breakthrough of dance music in the US, led by acts such as Deadmau5 and the French DJ David Guetta, a broadening of the music on offer and the authorities showing a more relaxed attitude following a clamp-down on free parties in recent years, it feels as if this could be one of the island's hottest summers for a while.\n\n\"It's nuts,\" Guetta laughs when we meet in Ibiza. \"It's June and the clubs have been sold out for weeks already. The season hasn't even really started yet. Where in the world can you find clubs where you can have this kind of party at this time of year?\"\n\nF**k Me I'm Famous, which he runs with his wife, Cathy, at the eternally glamorous Pacha, is currently the most high-profile night on the island. Its opening party this year crept forward to the last week of May, coinciding with the International Music Summit, which rivals Miami's Winter Music Conference as the most important event in the calendar for the dance music industry. The mood at the latest IMS was upbeat, with 82% of those present claiming their business was in a better place than it was a year ago.\n\n\"Ibiza has had quite a tough few years,\" says Ben Turner, co-founder of IMS and editorial director of Pacha magazine. \"There's been the recession, plus the greed of some club owners, who pushed entry and drinks prices up. I think they have seen sense now. And there's a free party scene here again.\"\n\nIbiza's clubs certainly seem to have weathered the economic downturn much better than those in the UK, which have also been affected by competition from late-night pubs and bars since the change in licensing laws. The most high-profile casualties have been Matter at the O2 in Greenwich, which recently closed, its sibling Fabric, now up for sale, and institutions including the End, Turnmills and the Cross, also in London.\n\nAlthough Ibiza was once synonymous with the Balearic mix of genres that DJs like Alfredo Fiorito created in the 80s, in recent years the bigger clubs had become dominated by minimal, tribal and commercial house. Some clubbers with more leftfield tastes moved on to Barcelona's Sonar festival or places such as Petrcane in Croatia, now host to several eclectic boutique festivals. Over the last few years, however, Ibiza Rocks has reintroduced guitar music to the island and elsewhere there's been a general broadening of tastes. The big statement this year was Pacha taking on Ibiza's best-loved underground DJ, Luciano, who plays a mix of Latin-tinged house and techno that would previously have been thought too underground for the seminal club founded in 1973.\n\nA few years ago, the Ibiza authorities, looking to encourage family tourism, began to clamp down on clubs opening into the daylight hours. But recently, their attitude has softened as they realise the importance of music to the island. \"I do think there was an acknowledgement that they came down too hard in certain aspects,\" says Turner. \"But they needed to stop these horrible flashpoints where you had thousands of people leaving clubs at 8am and families taking kids to nursery in the other direction, which is not a pretty sight, and one I think everyone's glad to see the back of.\"\n\nOne high-profile victim of the clampdown was DC10, which had a one-year ban imposed at the end of 2008. A converted finca near the end of the airport runway, DC10 (\"DC Diez\") started life as an after-hours venue for clubland workers and became one of the most influential underground clubs in the world. With its stripped-down space, it more closely resembled the warehouse raves of the acid house era than Ibiza's other clubs like Privilege, Space and Es Paradis with their VIP areas.\n\nDC10 opened again on 31 May for the season. Every Monday afternoon, a parade of clued-up clubbers, cultured casuals, cartoon caners, crazy characters, a few chic celebrities and the odd clown wind their way down the dusty road to join Circo Loco (Crazy Circus) at DC10.\n\nI land in Ibiza a few minutes into Tuesday morning and head straight to DC10 but, frustratingly, it's just closing. Instead, I go to Pacha in Ibiza Town where the Swedish House Mafia stage a night called Masquerade Motel. These three DJs-cum-producers – Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso and Steve Angello – look set to have one of the smash hits of the summer with their new single \"One\". Inside, the decor attempts to create the look of a 1950s motel and the club is rammed. I bump into former Stone Roses singer Ian Brown and his band, who are playing Ibiza Rocks tomorrow, on the main balcony, and then Manchester United footballer Wes Brown (no relation), who is in the VIP area, dancing with sunglasses on.\n\nNext morning, I head to the town of San Antonio and check into Ibiza Rocks. Initially, Ibiza Rocks gigs took place at Bar M (now renamed Ibiza Rocks Bar), but in 2008 the promoters opened the Ibiza Rocks hotel, where the headline gigs take place every Tuesday. The project is the brainchild of Andy McKay who, with brother Mike and their partners Claire and Dawn, have been on the island since 1994, when they left Manchester after, Andy says: \"I'd been doused in petrol.\" They ran Manumission, Ibiza's most infamously debauched club night, for 15 years.\n\nIt was McKay who decided to bring guitar music to the dance kids in Ibiza. \"In 2005, we were promoting the biggest club night here, but I was sat there thinking, 'This island is getting older and older.' We wanted to make it younger again.\"\n\nAfter overcoming initial scepticism, Ibiza Rocks is now well established and as well as weekly gigs that take place at the hotel, they have launched a new night, Reclaim the Dancefloor at Eden. This features DJs such as Aeroplane, Chase & Status, Benga and Radio 1's Zane Lowe, reflecting the more diverse tastes of a new generation. This season also sees the launch of Mallorca Rocks on Ibiza's sister Balearic island.\n\nThe Ibiza Rocks hotel is aimed at a young clientele who'd never make it into the VIP section of Pacha. It's the only hotel I've ever stayed in where you're required to wear a wristband and show it to a bouncer every time you enter and the only one where fellow guests wear shades in the swimming pool. Arctic Monkeys were one of the first to play Ibiza Rocks in 2007, and their debut album seems to be on constant repeat in the foyer, which feels appropriate given the residents checking each other out around the pool, thinking something along the lines of: \"I bet you look good on the dancefloor...\" There is a small supermarket next door, over half of which is given over to alcohol. Of the three food aisles, one is devoted solely to varieties of Pot Noodle.\n\nIan Brown's dressing room is much plusher than the hotel rooms, with day beds dotted around. \"I love Ibiza,\" the laid-back singer tells me. \"I've been a few times on holiday, but until last night I'd never stepped foot in a nightclub and I thought it was knockout.\"\n\nWhen he comes on stage to a packed audience, those lucky enough to have a room overlooking the stage are dancing on their balconies, with one particularly enthusiastic girl dancing naked in her room above the stage, unaware others can see her. Brown plays the Roses' own Balearic classic \"Fools Gold\" as an encore and is on a high in the dressing room afterwards.\n\n\"I thought it was beautiful,\" he says. \"Twenty years ago, the spirit of Ibiza was taken back home,\" – he means by the Roses, Happy Mondays and acid house – \"and 20 years later I'm asked back and I'm still a part of it. When I did martial arts, the whole point was that the circle is the lifeblood of the system and here it's come full circle.\"\n\nIn the morning, nobody is around. This is not a hotel where you need to rush out with a towel to reserve a sunlounger. I overhear two parties from Essex reacquainting themselves, the afternoon after the early hours before. \"Hi mate, I'm Kev,\" says one lad, offering his hand. \"I know, you were in our room 'til 9am this morning werentcha?\" comes the reply.\n\nI chat to a young group by the pool. Antony Norfolk, 23, is from Chelmsford, Essex, and it's his first time in Ibiza. \"We chose Ibiza Rocks because everyone who came said it was awesome.\" Norfolk and his mates' itinerary includes Amnesia, Zoo Project on Saturday and Space on Sunday.\n\nEllie Cornish, 20, from Brentwood, Essex, came to Ibiza Rocks for a slightly different reason. \"I saw Katie Price here on TV,\" she says, a touch abashed. What Cornish and her friends are most looking forward to is David Guetta's F**k Me I'm Famous night at Pacha. \"I'm a massive fan and we've heard it's the only place to go and it's worth the money.\" Won't the €70 ticket eat into their budget? \"Yeah, but if he played a concert in England it would probably be nearly £50 to go and see him.\"\n\nThose who have never set foot on the island might assume it's overrun by Brits, but although some of the tackier areas like the West End of San Antonio are like that, cooler dancefloors embrace a cosmopolitan mix where you're as likely to find yourself dancing next to a fashionista from Berlin or a Milanese ultra as a girl or boy from Essex. The rich still come here, too – the rumour is that one Russian, being told the VIP section on FMIF's opening night was full, offered €50,000 for a table. For them, lazy days are spent enjoying massages in the spa of the Atzaró hotel, or chilled rosé at El Chiringuito, before dozing it off at an \"undiscovered\" beach (as with \"unseen\" Beatles photographs, there can't be any left), and then dinner at Elephant in San Rafael before an evening clubbing.\n\nSome things remain free in Ibiza, however, and the famous sunsets at San Antonio on the west of the island still draw a crowd every night. Tonight, Café Mambo is mobbed as DJ Erick Morillo is playing his regular pre-club party and the beachfront is packed with people craning their necks to get a glimpse of him in action.\n\nLater, I go to nearby Eden for the opening night of Reclaim the Dancefloor. Zane Lowe is in the middle of a set that runs from Blur to Motörhead through half of the Prodigy's oeuvre. \"When I say Zane, you say Lowe… Zane… Lowe,\" he hollers. Then I head to a party for the clubland workers who survive on bar work, dancing, flyering or whatever else they can pick up, in the back room of Savannah on Sunset Strip. The owner complains to me that bars like his have been squeezed by the big clubs, who have charged so much in recent years that clubbers are left with no money for the rest of their holiday.\n\nRob Wilder, one of the resident DJs, is one of those Ibiza veterans who needs little invitation to expand on the mystical qualities of the island. He talks about a special energy on the island that means no poisonous animal or reptile can exist there. He also explains how a 1998 documentary, Ibiza Uncovered, which focused on cheap debauchery and punters boasting about \"shagging and drug use\", had a hugely detrimental effect. \"That attracted all the wrong sorts for a few years, so the clubs put their prices up to keep them out and the prices never came down again.\"\n\nNearly all the veterans I meet attest that the island is not what it was, but feel a rebirth is under way. Far more young people want to work in Ibiza now, many of them feeling there is nothing back home for them. \"Café Mambo were looking to recruit two staff,\" says Wilder, \"and they held an interview open day and 500 turned up.\"\n\nNext afternoon sees the launch of a boat party from San Antonio harbour. Pukka Up started running boat parties on the Thames in 2003 and in 2004 launched Sunset Boat Parties, which, along with a residency at the club Es Paradis, made their name on the island. Today is the launch of the Boat That Rocked, an initiative that aims to showcase a wide range of music, with Ross Millard from the Futureheads as today's onboard DJ. The crowd are mostly in their late teens and early 20s, many wearing T-shirts with slogans that read \"Sex, Drugs and Pukka Up!\"\n\nWithin minutes of leaving the harbour, people are dancing on the bench seating and any other available surface. One girl with a Scouse accent sees me taking notes and says: \"Oi, get up me dear… stop writing youse!\"\n\nEd Moore, who organises the Pukka Up tours, has been coming to Ibiza for eight years. He agrees that a new generation of clubbers has more eclectic musical tastes. \"They don't listen solely to any specific genre – they can listen to tech house and then some cheesy disco and not feel guilty.\"\n\nThere's been a shift, too, in the popularity of different drugs on the island. While cocaine, ketamine and mephedrone are available, the notable change in the last few years has been the price and strength of ecstasy. According to more than one source I spoke to, an ecstasy pill five years ago would only cost about €2 \"but you needed about eight to last you all night\". The pills now available, such as Facebooks (drug dealers have always been ones to spot a marketing opportunity) and Diamonds, are more like €10 or €15, but are about 10 times the strength. \"One will leave you battered all night.\"\n\nAs the boat pulls in, a few of the shipmates are looking a little the worse for wear but that doesn't stop them soldiering on to the next party. I head to Pacha for F**k Me I'm Famous. Outside, the queue spills on to the pavement, and inside the sold-out club, the VIP area takes up even more space than is usual. I'm given a pass to stand behind the DJ booth and I hear Guetta's arrival before I see him. Suddenly, there are screams from the dancefloor with camera phones held aloft creating a mirrorball effect. The crowd is as tightly packed as the front row of a gig, with clubbers on each other's shoulders. Guetta plays for three hours and there is mayhem whenever he drops one of his smash collaborations like \"When Love Takes Over\" with Kelly Rowland. Guest DJ Chuckie picks up the mic and hollers: \"Make some noise for the number one DJ in the worrrrldddddd!\"\n\nI'm due to meet the 42-year old Frenchman, who produced \"I Gotta Feeling\" for the Black Eyed Peas, the following afternoon. He's still asleep at his villa, it transpires, and I can only grab him at the airport before he catches a flight to Paris. He's modest about the frenzied reaction he received the night before – \"It's what I do,\" he shrugs – and talks about how the likes of Will.I.Am weren't initially convinced that his music would work in the US (\"He said, 'I can do things with you I could never do under the name of the Black Eyed Peas – and it's great!'\").\n\nBillboard magazine has argued he is \"changing the US Top 40\". \"It's crazy, right?\" he says shaking his head. \"I thought it would work but not to this level; this is like another level.\"\n\nThe idea of crossing musical divides excites him more than anything. \"I love it if I can, a little bit, how do you say 'bring down the boundaries'? There's two levels. When it comes to sound, I'm thinking of the club, I'm a DJ first, so I make beats that will drive people crazy on the dancefloor. But then I add songs to bring something more emotional and this is probably what makes a big difference. If it's going to touch their heart, it doesn't matter if they're from the dance community or not.\"\n\nGuetta tends to polarise opinion in that community. \"I think Guetta is a special case, I haven't got a bad word to say about him,\" says David Dewaele of the outfit 2ManyDJs. \"I think what he has done in America is amazing, and what [DJ/producer] Tiesto and Deadmau5 have done, it's what I thought Daft Punk might have done previously. I think it's great that America is listening to dance music rather than R&B or hip-hop.\"\n\nMost of the dance community who attended IMS in May appreciated that Ibiza would benefit from the trickle-down effect of the success of the likes of Guetta in the US – even if in a poll more than two thirds said that the Black Eyed Peas should not be \"referenced in the same breath as dance music\".\n\nBen Turner adds: \"Electronic music is always at its best when its slightly bubbling under the mainstream. It's great to stick your head over the parapet and have hit records but you've always got to return to where your core audience is, which is in the clubs.\"\n\nAfter leaving Guetta, I grab a taxi back to the beach-front bar Bora Bora in Playa d'en Bossa, the site of many debauched open-air parties in years past. It's not even 7pm but the party is going hard. Dancing on the tables is Rebecca Clarke, 19, from Essex. She's been coming to Ibiza from an early age with her family and is now in her second season working as a dancer on the island. She says it's a lot busier than it was this time last year and describes Ibiza as almost a way of life for the workers there. \"It's hard work but if you can put the work in you get the rewards; you get to know people and then you can do what you're here to do.\" Which is to party? \"Yeah!\"\n\nFor some clubbers, the spirit of the late 80s and early 90s is gone and will never return. But others, certainly those within the industry, see renewed energy and the island has lost none of its allure to the younger generation.\n\nFew would disagree with Lenny Ibizarre, the DJ who has sold more than a million Chilled Ibiza compilations, who says: \"There are three islands in the world that are internationally known because of their music: Cuba, Jamaica… and Ibiza.\"\n\nBack at Bora Bora, an incoming plane roars only a couple of hundred feet overhead every minute or so, to cheers and raised hands. \"This is a great party,\" an Ibiza veteran says. \"This is what it was like back in the day, when everyone used to wave the planes in while they were dancing.\"\n\nDavid Guetta's album One Love is out on Virgin Records. The Prodigy play at the 5th anniversary of Ibiza Rocks on 20 July"
