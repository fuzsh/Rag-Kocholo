        "text": "History: Ibiza was born as a Phoenician city named Aiboshim in 654 BC. Its urban center was made up of an acropolis and a port on the shores of the bay. Various temples and an area for handcrafts with notable pottery manufacturers of the time also formed an important part of Aiboshim.\n\nHistorians believe that around the 5th Century BC the city had between 4,000 and 5,000 inhabitants. It was occupied by the Carthaginians, who transformed it into a thriving center of commerce that exported manufactured products throughout the Mediterranean.\n\nAfter the destruction of Carthage in 146 BC, the city maintained its political and commercial autonomy and intensified its commercial activity as a federated city of Rome. This period ended when Roman emperor Vespasian declared the city a municipality of Rome in 70 AD.\n\nAt this point in history a period of decadence set in that lasted throughout nearly all of Rome's imperial phase and ended with the arrival of the Vandals (a Germanic tribe) in 424 AD and subsequent occupation by the Byzantines and the Arabs. In 1235, the city was conquered under the order of James I the Conqueror, then king of Aragon. This began the Christian era in the city's history, which can be traced to modern times.\n\nIbiza attained global fame as a place for fun and freedom in the 1960s thanks to a large and influential Hippie movement, and several Hippie colonies remain on the island today. During the 1970s many of the immense nightclubs Ibiza has since become famous for (such as Amnesia and Pacha) began springing up throughout the island, mainly around the capital and nearby San Antonio.\n\nIbiza is a very cosmopolitan city with strong touristic appeal. Most visitors are drawn to the city primarily by its fun atmosphere and renowned nightlife, but the architectural and natural attractions of the city and its island are numerous. Ibiza also enjoys a rich historical and cultural heritage so if you plan your next Ibiza Holidays you can also take some time to experience the cultural heritage of the Island. Due to Ibiza's multicultural history, there are numerous affinities with Phoenician/Arab culture, customs and gastronomy.\n\nThe ancient quarters of the city, known as Dalt Vila (\"high city\"), is Ibiza's most notable historical attraction. Its medieval area was fortified by Philip II to defend the city from attacks by the Ottomans and rogue pirates in the 16th Century, since the triple defensive enclosure of Arabic origin no longer provided sufficient protection. The Dalt Vila fortification is one of the best-conserved enclosures of its kind and has been a World Heritage Site since 1999.\n\nMuch of Ibiza's natural beauty is concentrated in the mountainous northern part of the island, in a protected area called Els Amunts. This natural reserve is alive with fields of almond, olive and fig trees clustered into small forests and groves. Its coastline is beautiful, lined with cliffs and coves and delightful fine-sand beaches. Els Amunts ranges from the municipalities of San Antonio to San Vicente.\n\nOne of Ibiza's most unique cultural features is the island's thriving Hippie community. Numerous colonies are located throughout the island, and at least two important outdoor Hippie markets are held for visitors every week during the warm months of the year. On Wednesdays, one takes place at the Punta Arabí resort in Es Cana, and a second Hippie market is held on Saturdays in Las Dallas, near the village of San Carlos.\n\nGoing Out\n\nFor an island its size, Ibiza has an unheard-of number of large clubs; at least 40 are scattered throughout the island, with the largest concentration in the capital. Ibiza's nightlife scene is, without doubt, globally famous. People come from all corners of the Earth to experience for themselves some of the world's largest and most popular clubs, innovative electronic music and international party crowds.\n\nIbiza city and San Antonio (the island's second-largest town) are where most of the nightlife can be found. Here, people don't start filling the bars until seven or eight in the evening (basically, once everyone's done either sleeping off their hangover or enjoying the sun and waves at the beach). Bar promoters hand out drink specials on the streets starting around this time, making it easy to take advantage of some affordable drinks before heading out to the notoriously expensive clubs.\n\nSome of Ibiza's most famous nightclubs are Privilege, dubbed the world's biggest club and located halfway between Ibiza and San Antonio; Amnesia, near San Rafael and one of Ibiza's most original clubs dating back to the 1970s; Pacha, perhaps the most expensive of the clubs, known for excellent House music; and Space, which has won many awards and is often cited as the world's most famous club (five minutes from Ibiza city by car).\n\nAll of these nightclubs are expensive; it can cost from 30 to 50 € just to get in and drinks are usually around 10 € (special deals can be obtained from street promoters, however). Spending hundreds of euros in one night is not unheard of, especially when going from one club to another."
