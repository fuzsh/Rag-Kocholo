        "text": "The History: Largest Club In The World Emerges From Swimming Pool !\n\nBack in the 1960’s the urbanisation of San Rafael had a big community swimming pool with a small bar where the, predominantly French, local residents would meet in the summer heat to exchange pleasantries. Some would visit the huge silent pool at dawn to watch the sunrise and eat pasta dishes whilst enjoying the hospitality of Siegfried and Ramón Jesús.\n\nIt was literally an unspoilt oasis of trees and campo, shade and calm away from the already busy beaches - after all you can’t get much further away from a beach than San Rafael? Many years later in 1979 Siegried had the misfortune to lose an important card game and with it the enterprise. The new owners, from the Basque region, soon set about exploiting the potential of the venue, now known as ‘Ku’. In the evenings, after a days sunbathing with visiting friends, they often arranged parties for any excuse that came to hand.\n\nGorri\n\nThe guiding lights in those early days were Javier, Santa, Gorri, Brasilio and Amilio, creating impossibly real, but imaginary parties to celebrate full moons, a local fiesta, the mid-summer equinox, the far distant carnival in Rio or Notting Hill, even a party celebrating the existence of a particular colour or a part of male or female anatomy. It was any excuse to party and well beyond what we nowadays view as the excesses of the clubs. Amilio was the man who brought in the superstars, Roman Polanski was an early visitor, who later included Amilio in one of his later films.\n\nA quick look through the photo-archive of the early years of Ku soon shows that you weren‘t going to get in to rub shoulders with the stars unless you were dressed up to the point of lunacy - transvestite garb was almost compulsory and to understand the mentality behind this almost compulsory cross-dressing is to begin to understand the ethic behind what has made this club the biggest indoor club in the world, that now houses Manumission - the largest single club night in the world - who by their own admission “probably wouldn´t get away with it anywhere else in the world”. This place was “in your face”, out of the closet and had found a formula that very soon became ‘dance music’ throughout Britain and subsequently the world. It wasn’t so much championing the music as opening the door to acceptance of gay permutations and cross sexuality which was the key to getting admitted to those early clubs that opened everyones minds to the repetative beats option which now dominates the music spectrum.\n\nUnderstandably, Ku soon became the place where you could expect to find your friends of an evening. Initially a music bar was added, the following year another with some decoration - an alternative venue for the people of the island and their visiting friends. In 1978 a mini disco with a capacity of 125 was added to the equation to promote their eaterie. They could have had little idea that at that moment they were laying the foundations to the largest club the world has ever seen. Quite possibly the largest club in the universe. Globally promoted by the likes of Grace Jones dancing naked in the rain alongside the swimming pool and Freddie Mercury recording “Barcelona“ - the place was soon packed with young trendies, transvestites and millionaires. Demand rapidly exceeded supply so bits were added on and some bits taken away. The original pool had Olympic dimensions but its edges were trimmed to gain space, its depth diminished and its wid th crossed by a bridge that embraces it like a perverted, yet almost appropriate, chastity belt.\n\nOriginally open to the Ibiza sky, moon & stars, sunsets and rises it became the archetypal Ibiza setting for a night out. A place to rub shoulders with the rich and famous, from the fashion and rock & roll industries, enlightened local luminaries or hippies on the road from Amsterdam to Goa or beyond. A cosmopolitain blend of like-minds seeking liberty and freedom of expression where nearly everything was either possible or acceptable. A paradise of celebration which over the years became a temple to music, although its size still permits conversation in quieter corners.\n\nThe prevailing emphasis on music, combined with advancing technology in the equipment designed to deliver it, brought about two new laws in 1990 requiring the big discos to install soundproofing, i.e. put rooves on! For a club the size of Ku this was a serious project considering the size of the space they were using and their Olympic swimming pool. The legal requirements and the fact that the roof blew off in a storm the following year eventually drove Ku in to bankruptcy! The club remained closed throughout the summer of 1991 and re-emerged with its current emphasis on a new style of party - more massive and musically orientated than previously - to fit in with the rising power of dance music sweeping through Europe at the time.\n\nDespite continued success at the club, the involvement of prominent local bankers, who had financed the legal and monumental requirement of roofing the club, finally foreclosed on their loan during a dispute over the interest rate that should have applied to the loan. Santa Maria, a famous ex-footballer and one of the main partners who ran a number of night clubs in mainland Spain, was assasinated in San Sebatian on suspicion of being involved in the drug business at about the same time. It was all going pear-shaped. ‘Ku’ ceased to exist and ‘Privilege’ was born.\n\nThe baton that was ‘Ku’ passed on to the new owners in 1995 and the new name ‘Privilege’ reflected a period of change. The one-time local swimming pool that served as a quiet oasis for the locals in times gone by now serves as a symbolic moat to the enormous medieval fortress, but with a twist of modern science fiction, that we all nowadays know as Privilege. It’s not a fairy tale, but if anybody had suggested to you twenty years ago what was about to happen at the local San Rafael swimming pool you would have been forgiven for laughing …\n\nFor many people Pacha is not just the best club in the world - it is the image which springs to mind when people abroad utter the word 'Ibiza'. The memory is usually enough to bring a wry smile to an Ibiza veteran's lips. Not to mention the lips of their children too...\n\nRicardo Urgell, Toni Riera, Carlos Martorell, Lluis Diaz & Jaume Pia\n\nThe story behind Pacha extends back to a different past referred to by the local ibicencos as 'antes' meaning 'before' and in this context 'before tourism'. A time when people had no need of TV or newspapers to tell them what was happening elsewhere in the world. They were poor, but happy in their isolated country fincas without electricity and drawing their water from, often distant, wells. They didn't care what the rest of the world were up to until it arrived on their doorstep carrying the banner 'ahora' meaning 'now' and in this context 'the tourists are here 'now'!'.\n\nThe original entrance, decorated for a \"Hollywood\" party\n\nBack in the 60's there were in fact already tourists, but these were predominantly hippies following the 'Elephant Trail' through San Francisco, Katmandu, Goa, Amsterdam and Ibiza. On a quest to explore an alternative lifestyle and find their own personality and inner beauty, they were not prepared to adapt to society. Surviving on little or no money they found themselves at home in the subsistence economy of a small self-sufficient island. In harmony with nature in its most primitive form. They didn't know each others surnames for their family was as large as their community of friends. Their common bond - their refusal to accept maturity. A cosmopolitan rag-tag legion united by endless trust.\n\nThe majority of other tourists around at that time were either the super-rich or Royalty parking their yachts in the harbour's of the island to enjoy an expensive meal in the 'restaurant quarter' of San Antonio - that we now affectionately refer to as San An's notorious 'West End'. Or the network of small, unpretentious bars and restaurants spread about Ibiza.\n\nThe original pacha poster designed in 1976 by Toni Reira - which is the upper stories of the Montesol on the Vara de Ray in Ibiza Town\n\nThe major exception was the Montesol on the Vara de Rey in Ibiza's town centre, where the rich and famous gathered to be seen being served by waistcoated and bow-tied waiters. The rich and famous became some of the island's earliest ex-pat residents and can largely be blamed for the demand that generated the spectacular social social life now known globally as Ibiza. Or more locally - 'ahora' Some of the early legendary venues were La Tierra, San Telmo, Sandy's in Santa Eulalia and Club San Rafael (now the biggest indoor night club in the world - Privilege aka. KU).\n\nTheir success and famous clientele awoke the island to the possibility of profiting from its visitors and subsequently trashed the alternative culture that had initially attracted the visitors. The 'pile it high & sell it cheap' of bucket tourism landed and were made welcome - they liked it here. Ibiza became less spiritually focused and less sensible, but was having far more fun? The original bunch of black sheep were joined by the rest of the herd with their credit cards, sun tan lotion and refusal to learn Spanish. This was 1973 and the moment chosen by Ricardo Urgell to open Pacha.\n\nAt the time everybody laughed because it was so far out of town that it could only be reached by car. On the contrary, it was immediately successful and well worth the walk. Very soon Ibiza night life had a new headquarters and Pacha became Ibiza night life. There had never been so much happiness and good feeling concentrated into, what was then, one small finca. They played reggae and hippy music and soon brought the hippies down from the hills for the weekend parties. An esoteric, self-gratifying lifestyle can only be recognised if you have the reference point of a mad, sleep-free weekend of clubbing to compare it with?\n\nUntil Ku opened Pacha was the undisputed, trendiest night club in Ibiza. It's grand, baroque feel yet haphazard layout could not have been conceived by an architect. It comprises simply a series of additions to the original box that at the time presumably satisfied a whim or demand for more space, perhaps a different environment? Could this be the spot where the original concept of the 'chill out area' was first coined? Ultimately it was no contest - Ku became the new kid on the block whilst Pacha exuded eternity, partly because of its 'finca' style, but more through its regulars - a clientele that includes more famous names that your average Royal palace can muster.\n\nThe 2001 season simply reinforced the legend. Alongside the tribute to its past - 'Flower Power' - surely the busiest, regular hippy night on the planet (and oldest theme night?), an orbit of modern dance superstar DJs have all left their fingerprints on arguably the most popular 'wheels of steel' on the planet. At Pacha the motto is - the party doesn't need to stop - and those of us lucky enough to indulge in it, even through the Winter, wouldn't have it any other way... 'Molts anys y bons' (Many years and good ones..)"
