        "meta_description": "This introduction presents DJ Paulette’s highs, lows and lessons of her thirty-year music career. DJ Paulette presents a remarkable view of the music industry from a Black woman’s perspective. DJ’ing made it possible for her to move to London and make a career out of working in the music industry, mentored by some of the best in the business. According to her, the music industry is not without its issues or disadvantages. There are so few Black and female role models behind the decks or in the boardrooms, and this needs to be addressed. There is an undercurrent of racism and sexism, while stories of misconduct are only now starting to come to light. This book is a heartfelt, hilarious and frustrating account of DJ Paulette’s own story, spanning the scenes she has inhabited, the characters she has encountered and the many twists and turns of her career.",
