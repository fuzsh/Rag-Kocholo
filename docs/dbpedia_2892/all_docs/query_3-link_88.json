        "meta_description": "Manchester legend DJ Paulette discusses women’s secret legacy and women’s rights-related issues in this chapter. She reveals that she was prepared for the world, mentored by right-on feminists. Through them she learned that independent, multiskilled and mature people are Swiss Army-knife useful and a valued member of any team. DJ Paulette and her friends, tired of questions concerning the gendered challenge of being capable of doing anything, gathered together to dissect and examine the issues, stereotypical attitudes, and the standard female DJ interview questions. One of the biggest influences and role models to DJs and record label executives was Strictly Rhythm’s Gladys Pizarro, who, from 1989, took the world of independent record labels, branding, licensing and A&R to another level. From The BRITS to BIMM, from Point Blank College to Future DJs, professional and academic coaching and extracurricular involvement is now a respectable path to follow.",
