Hard to find and not promoted in any way, Underground is successful because it keeps itself to itself, meaning when you go, you feel like you’re part of something very exclusive. Popular with residents and workers.\n\nJust off the San Antonio-Ibiza highway on the outskirts of sleepy San Rafael, Underground is an unassuming nightspot housed in a traditional Ibizan estate.\n\nAbout Us\n\nUnderground doesn’t need to shout about itself, and it is very much a word of mouth venue.\n\nWhy Underground?\n\nWant to try something different whilst you’re away then Underground is for you. Staying away from headliners, its focus is instead on creating a happy, atmosphere. With a large outside terrace and lots of seating for you to chill on, Underground delivers a more chilled out side of the Ibiza clubbing scene.\n\nWhere is Underground?\n\nNot far from Privilege, Underground is pretty much in the middle of the island. Taxi’s from San Antonio will cost around 20 euro, Ibiza Town 10 euro and Playa d’en Bossa 15 euro. Buses from each of these cost around 3 euro.\n\nCan I stay near Underground?\n\nThere is no accommodation near Underground\n\nHow much does Underground cost?\n\nEntry is usually free, however some events can be up to 50 euros, however that includes free drinks all night. Most nights it is 5-10 euros."
