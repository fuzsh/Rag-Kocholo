        "text": "For someone planning their first trip to Ibiza, it might be overwhelming when they research the things this island has to offer. Of course, there is no need to worry or to be nervous whether you will try, see, and visit everything, as even though you can always find one beach where the sunset is just ideal, by talking to locals and even wondering around, you will check all the important spots. On the other hand, Ibiza sightseeing represents the best thing one can do in their life, as only when you witness everything firsthand can you truly understand why it’s called an island that never sleeps. Furthermore, you can always find certain things and places that are simply a must to check out while in Ibiza, and this list should be of much help with that.\n\nOne of the best things about Ibiza is that it never sleeps, and there is always something interesting to do to fulfil free time. For people who do not know how to organize their time well, it can be a huge problem as there are too many things to do, see and try, so they can easily end up without enough time to explore everything. During the day, you can enjoy different water activities and explore different cities and places, while during the evening and night, you can relax or go out to some of the world’s best clubs. Whether you prefer a peaceful vacation or enjoy staying active even then, there is no doubt that Ibiza has something to offer even to the pickiest ones and make their trip unforgettable.\n\nOne of the biggest tourist attractions in Ibiza surely are the hippy markets, and if you plan your trip, visiting one of them must be on your to-do list. For those who do not know what hippy markets are and what to expect, we need to say that they can enjoy a variety of colours, amazing food, and the most interesting – they can even meet real hippies and learn more about their lifestyle. Although they are organized all over the island, some of them are more popular, and more tourists visit them, which means they can be a little crowded, but a great time is guaranteed.\n\nEs Canar Hippie Market\n\nThe biggest one is held in Es Canar, and since it has been attracting visitors since 1973, it is also considered the oldest hippy market in Ibiza. It is known by the names Punta Arabi or True Hippie Market, and it is open for visitors from April to October on each Wednesday. It is the best place to try local organic food, see various performances, and choose the best souvenir, and even the youngest will enjoy time spent there, as they can make their own souvenirs. Besides that, the entire family will learn more about the culture of Ibiza.\n\nLas Dalias Hippie Market\n\nFor those who want to spend their Saturday in some of the hippy markets, the one held in San Carlos and called Las Dalias Hippy Market is the best choice. The entire place is pretty exotic, and besides searching for the best souvenir or handmade jewellery, you can spend some time wandering through the gardens of Las Dalias and enjoy colours, scents, and overall atmosphere, which is extremely relaxing. Locals are happy to talk to tourists and tell them the story about some popular musicians who were their guests, such as Queen, Bob Marley, and many others.\n\nSometimes it can be challenging to catch up with everything during the day, as Ibiza has a lot to offer, but there is no need to worry, as hippy markets are held even during the evening, and they do not differ from those held during the day. The most popular is again Las Dalias, which seems like the party never stops for people eager to relax and enjoy.\n\nLas Dalias is also open during Christmas and Easter, when appropriate decorations, performances, and activities are added, which makes it a perfect place to spend these big holidays with friends and family.\n\nTravelling to the past may not be possible, but if you visit Dalt Vila, you will feel like you succeeded in it for at least some time. Make sure to set aside enough time and take on the most comfortable shoes, as it is even bigger than it seems, and require a lot of time to be carefully explored. Its name means High Town, and since it is located on Puig de Vila hill, this name suits it the best. There are many things to see behind the walls, from the castle and cannons to the breath-taking Cathedral of Santa María de las Nieves and much more, and you can choose between five entrances. It is possible to enter the town by car, but we recommend walking, as it is the only way to see every detail.\n\nThe only way to complete your Ibiza sightseeing is to add some mystery to it, and there is no better place than Es Vedrà. It is a massive rock that rises proudly from the sea, and many locals claim it has some mystical energy. Also, this is where you can take some memorable photos, as the sight of this place is definitely one of a kind. It is also believed that this rock is in third place on the list of the most magnetic spots, which explains the energy people feel nearby. Tourists can see it from various locations on the land or go on a boat trip and get as near as possible. Just looking and getting close to this natural wonder will leave you speechless, and luckily, there are many tours that will take you here. They last for an hour or two as you pass by, not just this amazing rocky island, as you can also check out other famous locations. Overall, the island of Es Vedrà represents something that, while in Ibiza, you simply must visit or at least get as close as possible, as it is an experience that cannot be compared to any other."
