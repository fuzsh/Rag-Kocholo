        "text": "Founded in the early 1970s as a restaurant, Privilege evolved into a bar and swimming pool. In 1979, footballer Jose Antonio Santamaria bought the venue, renaming it Ku and establishing its reputation as a predominantly gay venue. In 1987, Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballe filmed the video for “Barcelona” at the club. The venue was renamed Privilege in 1995.\n\nClosure and renovation\n\nPrivilege closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Spanish government has since provided over €8 million for its restoration. The club, located near the village of San Rafael, has a main room the size of an aircraft hangar. Renovation work includes extensive repairs to the structure and interior.\n\nThe reopening\n\nFeatures and Capacity\n\nUpon reopening, Privilege will have a capacity of 15,000, up from its previous 10,000. The club’s iconic pyramidal glass structure, known as Vista Club, remains a popular spot for house and techno music enthusiasts. The club has been a favourite among celebrities for decades and was featured in the film “Kevin & Perry Go Large.”\n\nTimeline\n\nWhile an exact reopening date has not been announced, it is speculated that the club may reopen next year. The return of Privilege is highly anticipated, promising a revival of its renowned summer party nights.\n\nIbiza’s nightlife\n\nHï Ibiza\n\nIn addition to Privilege, Ibiza is home to Hï Ibiza, which was named the world’s best nightclub by DJ Mag for the second consecutive year. Opened in 2017 by Ushuaïa Entertainment, Hï Ibiza continues to set the standard for nightlife on the island.\n\nAlso read: Ibiza´s incredible nightlife\n\nOther attractions\n\nBeyond its nightclubs, Ibiza offers a range of activities, including visiting the historic castle in the Old Town. The island remains a top destination for partygoers and tourists alike.\n\nThe reopening of Privilege marks a significant moment for Ibiza’s nightlife. With its rich history and new renovations, the club is set to reclaim its status as the world’s biggest and most iconic nightclub."
