        "text": "Back in London finally after extensive travels and really able to digest and reflect on such a memorable experience at the International Music Summit in Ibiza. I had the privilege of speaking spoke on the Ballantine's True Music panel - Amplifying Amapiano and African Dance Music alongside Grace Ladoja, Sarah Jane Nicholson, Isaac Tunde Adeniyi and Shanae Dennis, hosted by the supe talented Charisse Chikwiri. Working on Ballantine's True Music for the last 4 years - I've been fortunate to contribute to it's incredible journey, touring the world, showcasing and uplifting local music scenes to global audiences through our partnership with Boiler Room - a lot of the strategy behind it actually informed by the examples of the members of the panel have set when considering how to represent these amazing music scenes authentically, by always leading with the community first. It was truly amazing to hear from everyone and share my own (perhaps radical) thoughts as to where African Dance Music is heading and can go to, and why it's important for us as a community to use our imagination to build the future we want to see, rather than fall into pre-conceived notions of dance music that currently exist. I also spoke on the importance of ensuring our heritage is not lost while the global gaze is on the continent. There is so much richness in the musical diversity of African dance music, not only presently but also in what came before - so the same way we're celebrating Amapiano now, we need to also seize the narrative to celebrate the rich history - from the infectious sounds of Soukous from Congo, the many amazing variants of Highlife across West Africa or how Kwaito changed the perception of electronic music across the continent - the list could go on and on, but now the light is shone, there are many stories to be told. A big thank you to Ballantine's and M&C Saatchi Sport & Entertainment London for their constant trust and belief, and to all my fellow panelists, it was a real pleasure to meet you all!"
