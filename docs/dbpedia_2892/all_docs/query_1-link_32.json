        "text": "photo by Oh So Hip\n\nIbiza. The story of a beautiful island gone wild. This spot off the coast of mainland Spain is famous mostly for its lavish, over-the-top parties. And normally this type of place doesn't call my attention, but after speaking with a few friends recently returned from this bachannal paradise, it seems like this island could be quite a bit more well-rounded than it seems. Here are some recs, starting with the top three stalwarts of the party scene:\n\nPacha: Club Pacha has made a name for itself across the globe, with clubs in bustling cities including London. However, the flagship club was established in Ibiza back in 1973 and it continues to pack a punch. While it has been around for 40 years, it doesn’t show its age, with top names including Pete Tong playing here regularly to packed out dance floors.\n\nSpace: Considered to be one of the best clubs in the world, Space is an iconic place that shouldn’t be missed. Awarded ‘best club’ by the IMAs in ’05 and ’06, Space continues to be a high flyer and brings the clubbing experience to a whole new cosmic level.\n\nPrivilege: With big names such as DJ Tiesto having alot to do with this club, you can only imagine how good it is as darkness falls. It’s considered to be the biggest night club in the world and the crowds that come to try it out don’t leave disappointed.\n\nphoto from PrettyCityLife\n\nAs one of the must-visit islands in the Med when it comes to clubbing holidays, Ibiza continues to be at the top of its game, with evenings that leave people dancing till dawn. Go all out, or grab some cheap Ibiza holiday deals available online.\n\nNewcomers to Ibiza include:\n\nDestino: opened by the fiesta experts at Patcha, this spot is perchd on the cliffs at Cap Martinet. Surrounded by greenery, lawns and palm trees, the all-white rooms have driftwood-style furniture, and the VIP suites have a butler service and private pools. There’s a nightly live show of art, dance and acrobatics by the pool with DJs from 5pm.\n\nExperimental Beach: This spot opened last spring and is just downright pleasant: great cocktails, tasty fresh food and music while you watch the sun go down. On the sand of Playa d’es Codolar, the drinks are crafted by the mixologists behind London’s Experimental Cocktail Club. Wednesdays are beach barbecue and DJs to accompany gorgeous sunsets.\n\nUshuaïa: with a new ultra-luxurious hotel, Ushuaïa Tower, this place is hot. Incredible sound, fab surroundings, and an enviable A-List.\n\nSee you this summer..."
