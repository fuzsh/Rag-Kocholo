        "text": "San Antonio, located on the west coast of Ibiza, is one of the hottest tourist destinations on the island, drawing in young party enthusiasts from the UK and other parts of Europe like a strong magnet, every single year.\n\nSan Antonio’s popularity is due to many reasons, primarily being its jaw-dropping location. It’s located in San Antonio Bay, one of the most gorgeous natural harbours in the world. The beautiful sunsets you can witness at the all-famous Sunset Strip are unlike any other place.\n\nAnother reason why it’s so popular amongst young party-seekers is because of its affordability. San Antonio is a much cheaper location as compared to other areas on the island. The super-clubs you can visit here for the best possible clubbing experience are – Eden and Es Paradis. However, there are uncountable bars with spacious dance floors where you can drink and dance all your worries away.\n\nSan Antonio is a land that is well-known for the wide range of bars, clubs, and restaurant options it presents to its locals and tourists alike. If you’re looking to have a blast clubbing from morning to night time, you can easily access the super-clubs of San Antonio: Eden, and Es Paradis.\n\nThese 2 clubs are right in the centre of San Antonio, but some of the other super-clubs of Ibiza, such as Amnesia, Privilege and Underground are around 15 minutes by taxi (fare €15-€20), whereas Pacha, Ushuaïa, Hï Ibiza are a little bit further away – 20-25 minutes in a taxi (around €30).\n\nOn the other hand, if you’re a pool party fan, you can have the ultimate open-air pool experience at venues such as O Beach Ibiza and Ibiza Rocks.\n\nIf you’re a daytime clubber with a craving for partying in broad daylight and warmth of the sun, you can access the Ibiza Rocks Hotel (unofficially known as the ‘home of the pool party’) or the O Beach Ibiza Beach Club located on the promenade of San Antonio, and dance to your heart’s desire, in or around the pool, to some of the best tunes played by the most popular DJ’s in the world.\n\nAlternatively, feel free to catch the disco bus from the main bus station. It picks up passengers every 30 minutes, starting from midnight, the journey will cost you only a few Euros.\n\nDowntown San Antonio has an area called The West End, The Strip or simply West End. This is the entertainment district in the city centre, which is yet another affordable place for lots of clubbing, booze, fun, and great nightlife experiences, all while you’re on a budget. The famous San Antonio West End is your one-stop-shop for having a good time. It consists of a long street of large bars and places to eat.\n\nBased around Carrer Santa Agnès, the place consists of pedestrianised streets and one long bar strip that caters to all types of party lovers. It is home to diverse types of bars, pubs, and small discos.\n\nSome of the more popular bars in the West End area include the Revolutions, Dub Diamond, Soho, Soul City, Koppas, Taboo, and Tropicanas. Generally, bars tend to play more commercial EDM and house music compared to the rest of the Balearic Island. On the outside of these clubs, plenty of chairs and tables are arranged for holidaymakers and fun-seekers to sit and enjoy a drink… or two.\n\nSan Antonio prioritises its visitors’ convenience and presents them with an excellent system of bus connections that travel to and from all the major resorts in the area. You can also use this system to get to the airport, which is about 20km away.\n\nSan Antonio’s all-famous disco bus travels all night long and takes locals and tourists to almost all the clubs in the area, as well as to Ibiza Town and the clubbing resort of Playa d’en Bossa.\n\nParking areas and public car parks are also available, both for free and paid. In addition, you can also find several taxi ranks in town quite easily. Taxi fares in San Antonio specifically, and in Ibiza generally, are affordable and reasonable, especially if you’re travelling with a group.
