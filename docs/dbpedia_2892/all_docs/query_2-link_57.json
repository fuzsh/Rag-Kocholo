He currently DJs in Ibiza, Barcelona, Vienna, Berlin, Porto, Madrid and many other cities in Spain. He is also in demand for his remixes, with two standout examples being his hot remixes of Miley Cyrus and Daft Punk. Catch this super DJ in action at Paradiso Art Hotel, Pikes Hotel, Heart, Dorado and Tropicana hotels and the Cova Santa club.\n\nDJ Sherlock is a Latin dance teacher and radio presenter, working on Latin music and sports programmes on different radio stations in Ecuador. Since his arrival in Spain in 2000, he has worked as an entertainer and PR for Bacardi and Havana Club rum campaigns in Spain. He has taught dance for more than 15 years in different dance schools in Ibiza and at congresses. He created the first association of dance and Latin rhythms in Ibiza and nowadays transmits his passion for Latin music from the DJ booth.\n\nNell Shakespeare came to Ibiza in 2009, and her powerful, soulful voice did the rest. Her time in Ibiza has been very diverse: from playing blues-laden solo shows with her guitar, DJing late-night indie electronica sets, forming an all-female rock band, and fronting a 14-piece house orchestra. She has released music that ended up topping the charts through Midnight Riot Records and working with house legend Todd Terry.\n\nLola Von Dage began her career as a DJ at the legendary Berlin club White Trash. After five years in Berlin, she moved to Madrid in 2011 and became a regular at the Fabuloso party, led by Silvia Superstar, at Charada Club. In 2014 she moved to Ibiza for good and became a resident DJ at Rock Nights in Pikes Hotel and Concept Hotel Group's hotels. Her style is an eclectic mix of sounds ranging from rock, disco, funk, house and electronica.\n\nJustin Harris' career began in the early days of house music, in the warehouses and clubs of late 80s Britain. Alongside artists like DIY Sound System, Mr. C, Eddie Richards and Colin Dale, Justin played an essential role in transforming the house music scene and its global growth. After coming to Ibiza in 2015, he landed a weekly show on Sonica Radio. Ideally suited to the island, Justin has played at Zoo Project, Café Del Mar, Pacha, Space and Sankeys. But his greatest achievement, in his own words, is the Music For Freaks (MFF) parties that have raised the roof at Pikes Ibiza for over 4 years. The residency started in May 2016 with guests from the ever-growing MFF family appearing throughout the summer, including Dan Ghenacia, Dave Aju, Lord Leopard, Mr. Top Hat, Jozif, Luke Solomon (with Justin as Freaks), Lil Mark and Johnny Rock. 2023 promises to be even better, with the MFF at Pikes Ibiza in full swing and the legendary Shindig UK festival.\n\nIn 2023, Colin Peters celebrates 25 years of DJing in Ibiza, where he remains a much-loved resident. He has played at some of the most legendary parties on the White Isle: We Love Sundays, Manumission, Ibiza Rocks and Bora Bora. Colin had the honour of being one of the DJs on the lineup for Space Ibiza's final closing party on 2nd October 2016. Born in London, England, he is a master of different genres of music ranging from rock 'n' roll and indie, disco, synthpop and 80s Soul. His current Ibiza residency is at the Rock Nights party in the legendary Pikes Hotel. In 2022 he moved to Valencia, where he has residencies at two of the city's most renowned clubs: Play and XTRA LRGE.\n\nHe is one of the members of SUPA DISCO Ibiza and co-owner of Petit Vermut. He says that salsa healed his wounds when falling out of love, and that's how he discovered old school salsa and Latin jazz, into which he later incorporated Latin house. His sets are full of Latin rhythms that go straight to the dancefloor and the heart.\n\nThis DJ from Seville, resident in Ibiza, has been spreading African, tropical, Latin, soul, funk, disco and reggae rhythms since 1999 with fresh and elegant sets for finely-tuned ears and feet. In Seville, he was a resident at the legendary Kiosko Agua and Sala Malandar, and, in Ibiza, he has played at Space, Café del Mar, Pikes, Ibiza Rocks Hotel, Paradiso, Cubanito, Word of Mouth, Aztaró and Es Xiringuito Figueretas. He has also played at festivals such as Cruïlla Barcelona 2018 and the Jazz Re:Found Festival 2016 in Torino. He is best known as the musical director at Malanga Café, a small club in the centre of Ibiza that hosts international figures on the Afro-tropical scene: Quantic, Nickodemus, Captain Planet and Nightmares on Wax."
