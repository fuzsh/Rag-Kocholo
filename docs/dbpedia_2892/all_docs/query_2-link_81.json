When people see the production Resistance are putting into this iconic venue it’s going to blow them away.\"\n\nA unique concept pioneered by Ultra in 2015, RESISTANCE has fast become known for producing some of the highest quality house and techno experiences around the world.\n\n\"To be a part of their first residency in Ibiza is a huge honour and something I am excited to be part of,\" explains John Digweed on today's announcement.\n\n\"The fact that they have chosen the biggest club in Ibiza shows they are intent on making a big noise on the island right from the start. There is no better feeling than playing to a massive room full of people throbbing in unison to your set. Really looking forward to playing alongside Sasha and a host of world class DJs on this night.\""
