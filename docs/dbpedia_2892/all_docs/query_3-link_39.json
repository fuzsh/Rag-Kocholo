I remember the night though. Parts of it…”\n\nWhat one track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“Tracks from others? Too early to say… From our own stuff we are looking forward to play our latest single ‘Rolling Stones T-shirt’.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“There is just too many to chose from! Probably something deep and hypnotic…and sounding the complete opposite of what we’re doing right now.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“Wherever there’s a cold beer and cold water to dip your feet in.”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“Impossible to pick one!”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Right now Las Vegas.”\n\nDaddy’s Groove\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“It was just incredible, a heaven on the Earth, that place has a unique feeling which we love, anytime we’re there we feel at home.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“It was Space at the Carl Cox night, and the master Danny Tenaglia was spinning on the terrace doing one of his long DJ sets, beautiful!”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“We’ll be residents at F**k Me I’m Famous at Pacha plus some appearances at Ushuaia.”\n\nWhat one track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“We can only tell you the tile: ‘Galactica’.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“For sure Claude Van Stroke, ‘Who’s Afraid Of Detroit’.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“Maybe yes, but of course it depends on what club and party it is.\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“As a bar we have to say Mambo’s with it’s great pre-parties. As a beach Cala Jondal, we have such a good time over there!”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Both, in Ibiza it’s a pleasure doing business and pleasure can also turn into business…that’s what also makes Ibiza so unique.”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“Pacha!”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“At the moment US is really happening, lot of places are on fire over there, from Miami to Vegas to LA.”\n\nDaniele Mad\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“It’s a great place to live.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to?\n\n“KU in 1986.”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“In Liguria (Italy), a place called BFly (Loano SV) and Florida (Loano SV) and at the Lounge Bar of Enzo Ferrari Museum in Modena.”\n\nWhat 1 track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“I love Sandy Rivera tunes…hope for something good new soon..”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“Sabres Of Paradise – ‘Smokebelch II'”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“Well, considering this time of crisis…”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“Xa Trincha.”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Bus-sure.”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“Pacha.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Miami.”\n\nDanny Whittle\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“I fell in love with it from the start, it just felt like a great place and everyone was just having such a great time.”\n\nWhat was the reason you first came to work in Ibiza?\n\n“I was working for Renaissance and we came and did a party at Ku. Renaissance were always renowned for theirmassive production work so it was mad hard work as Ku was such a massive place. Lots of sweaty ladder climbing and so on, but so worth it.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“It would have been that Ku party and it was Renaissance. So I think at the time it was probably Fathers of Sound, Ian Ossia and Nigel Dawson. I am sure Geoff will correct me though…”\n\nHow do you think you have helped re-establish Pacha as the No. 1 club in the world?\n\n“I think I had to make each night in Pacha slightly different so we could appeal to a wider audience to fill the club seven nights a week. Also, I think working directly with the artists has helped Pacha to become more visible over working with too many other brands.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n‘Chocolate City’ by Deep Dish on the Space Terrace on a Sunday afternoon. Smiles and happiness. Wow, they were amazing times.”\n\nWhere is your favourite spot on the island?\n\n“My house firstly. Then El Chiringuito, Es Cavallet with my wife and boy. Sheer bliss.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer for some parties?\n\n“Yes I do. But then some DJs fees are too high also.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“Mambo for sunset and El Chiringuito for the beach.”\n\nWhat DJ epitomises Ibiza?\n\n“Andy Baxter. He can play anywhere, anytime and will play perfectly. One of the most talented and truly musical DJs I know. He is balearic to the bone.”\n\nDJ to watch out for in 2012…\n\n“Watch out for Madeon.”\n\nBest party anywhere on the island, inside or outside you have ever been to…\n\n“The Space Terrace most Sundays in the 90s outside. Inside, Pacha most nights.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Ibiza is No. 1, 2 and 3…”\n\nDarude\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“I came to do a huge outdoor party with MTV – ‘MTV Ibiza 2000’, and my mind was blowing left and right as pretty much the only thing I saw at the airport was already-crazed party people and other DJs and artists. It was so exciting to me that a lot of it is a blur. My name on the line-up alongside Underworld, Armand van Helden and Paul van Dyk to name a few was really unbelievable and overwhelming, but absolutely amazing, of course!”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“It was Amnesia and PvD was spinning.”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“At Es Paradis, at the Colors party hosted by Alex Kunnari, a Finnish DJ and a good friend. I’ll be there every Tuesday in July and possibly one in June and one in September. Others in the line-up are Alex himself, Super 8 & Tab, Andy Moor, Lange, Sean Tyas, Solarstone and others tab.”\n\nWhat one track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“Ooh, this question…I’m working on my new artist album, so any and all of those tracks will definitely be tested out here and there. But if you need me to name a track, then I’ll be cheeky and say ‘Sandstorm’; I’ll play it, a new mix probably, just to see if it still works or if I’m booed off the decks…”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“Energy 52 – ‘Cafe Del Mar’ (Three N One Remix).”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“Yes.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“It’s been a couple of years now since I’ve been there, but I did like Bora-Bora a lot the last few times I visited.”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Haven’t attended yet, so can’t say. Usually things like these are both, and the face-to-face networking is priceless, even if actual business wasn’t being done on the spot.”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“To me that’s always been Amnesia, but this summer that might change, the rumours say Es Paradis is a great contender!”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Las Vegas.”\n\nAnonymous story you would like to tell?\n\n“Anonymous? Nice try, but I’m not going to tell you the story of me weeping in the middle of the Amnesia dancefloor in 2000, my first ever night in Ibiza, when I heard PvD play ‘Sandstorm’ and the crowd exploded to massive cheers and all kinds of indescribable debauchery…”\n\nDave Forbes\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“Excitement!”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“es paradis.”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“Really looking forward to playing Coloursfest this year, some great acts lined up for the event.”\n\nWhat 1 track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“Really looking forward to playing a few new productions from myself especially David Forbes – ‘All Because Of You’ forthcoming on Armada Music.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“Three Drives – Greece.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“Of course but the problem is the DJs are charging so much money nowadays, it’s getting harder for the promoters to keep the price down.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“Mambo.”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“BOTH!”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“Space.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“There’s so many great places…Miami is a favourite of mine.”\n\nDavid Jones\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“That Ibiza never changes its mind. It’s like a paradise, hot and old city but always trendy. That’s thanks to the people that make the right vibes. you smell music and listen to the beats!!”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“Space – Groove Armada ‘2001.”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“I’m organizing a tour in Brazil, then I’m playing in a lot of different countries, from the UK to Korea, USA, Emirates – I’ve a full calendar.”\n\nWhat 1 track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“Actually my remix of “Last Night A DJ Saved My Life” that topped the Beatport House Chart and it’s a classic for the house lovers. Then I’m finalizing a couple of new tracks, that are really different from what I produced and from what we are listening around, so I can’t wait to play them.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“‘Body Language’ Booka Shade.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“Yes, I think that the music industry must look at the general crisis. The music industry is alive thanks to the “live” and “rights connected to the show” so we need to take care of people who pay for the show.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“Cafe Manbo and La Salinas.”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Pleasure.”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“It depends on several aspects, like time, day or night…etc… I think Pacha or Amnesia.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Miami right now and thanks to Axwell, David Guetta and other big artists that are pushing so many new tracks in the mainstreaming channel there will be for sure new destinations in the world.”\n\nAnonymous story you would like to tell?\n\n“In 2003 I was with Luca Moretti (A.k.a. Antillas , owner of Motivo, one of the best independent labels in the world in that period) and we were at Space for the birthday party of one of the most important uk DJs who was playing there. When he finished the set we went in a villa lost in a hill, which was property of Simon Le Bon (Duran Duran) . I don’t remeber how the party finished because we woke up at the hotel, totally crazy!”\n\nDavid Morales\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“I had heard so much about Ibiza that when I finally went there I was like WOW FINALLY! I have fond memories of my first time in Ibiza lol. To go to an island that was dedicated to clubbing was beyond anything that I’ve ever experienced. It was raw, sexy and fun.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“Cream was the first to bring me out to Ibiza. And the first club that I played at was Ku which is now known as Priviledge. I remember M People performing. It was the biggest club that I had ever been to. Unfortunately I don’t remember who was DJing that night lol.”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“As always I’m playing all around Europe and I have a few dates with Defected @ Pacha.”\n\nWhat one track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“I’m looking forward to playing my new single with Roisin Murphy called “Golden Era”.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“Needin U” for one. “Knights of the Jaguar”. “One More Time”. “To Be In Love” there’s so many.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“Out of control!!! I mean that’s just to get in. Never mind the drink prices. Every club has a VIP area now.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“I love Formentera. Taking a boat and swimming on that beach is just heaven. Even if I don’t swim lol. I don’t really have a fav bar.”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“For me, the best club is Pacha.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Good question…I personally like Mykonos.”\n\nDes Paul\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“Back then (1999) it was incredible with nights like Manumission at Privilege, people dancing on the old terrace at Mambo’s and this overwhelming feeling of hedonism.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“It was Space and I think Morales was playing.”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“Hed Kandi and hosting the DJ Awards.”\n\nWhat one track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“Tough choice but playing Ashley Beedle’s ‘Always’ at sunset is a winner.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“There are so many with different memories, maybe ‘Man With The Red Face’.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“Yes – absolutely ridiculous unless they’ve halved the drinks prices!”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“Ibiza Town by the marina for bars and Cala Salada is pretty decent.”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Business.”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“Space.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Brazil.”\n\nDiego Broggio\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“Wow this is a magic place.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“My first club was SPACE.”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“All over Italy.”\n\nWhat 1 track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“My new single ‘The Power Of Love’ on EGO.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“Point of View’ DB Boulevard.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“Yes, too expensive.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“Blue Marlin.”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Pleasure.”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“Pacha.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Miami.”\n\nDJ Meme\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“I was like “WTFF?? My life is all wrong!!”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“Pacha. But I have no idea who was spinning.”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“Portugal. Brazil, Spain, Italy, Indonesia etc.”\n\nWhat one track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“My remix for David Morales on his new track ‘New Golden Era’.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“Modjo ‘Lady’.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“If people are still paying it, then it’s not expensive. But for me, that’s outrageous.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“Blue Marlin for the venue, Sa Trincha for the history and everlasting vibe.”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Mu business is pleasure there…”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“Pacha and Amnesia.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Brazil of course. How can anyone deny that?\n\nD.O.D.\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“There’s just something about Ibiza that gets me excited as soon the plane touches down. Everyone has the same attitude towards dance music and you instantly get that vibe. The first time I went to Ibiza I fell in love with the island, you have a hand full of the world’s best clubs all within a 20 minute drive from each other catering for all of your musical needs. My first impression was ‘I don’t want to get my flight home next week’.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“The first club I ever went to was Amnesia for Cream when Sebastian Ingrosso, Marco V and Switch were playing – it was mind blowing at that age!”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“I’m playing two dates in Ibiza this season. Main room Judgement Sundays on August 12th and the closing party on September 16th plus a string of boat parties in between! Should be a great season this year!”\n\nWhat one track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“My own track ‘Headache In A Bottle’ which is forthcoming on Steve Aoki’s ‘Dim Mak’ label. It’s been getting great reactions in the U.K and has a real summer vibe about it, so I’m looking forward to seeing what it downs on the Ibizan dance floors!”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“1998 was an incredible year for summer slammers – ‘David Morales – Needin’ You’ ticks all the boxes for an Ibiza anthem.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“Yes I think that is ridiculously expensive, but at the end of the day, that’s the way the scene has gone. DJs are now superstars and I think the ticket prices reflect on that. If people want to see a specific artist, they will pay big money to do so. When people are on holiday I think it’s easier for them to justify spending the money, as they want to have a good time. I guess you’re not just paying to see the DJ though, the production for some of the best nights on the Island are incredible.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“Favourite bar would have to be the ‘Ibiza Rocks Bar’ on San Antonio bay. They have some of the worlds best DJs playing a short set before they go on to perform at one of the bigger clubs, great atmosphere! My favourite beach would have to be ‘Bora Bora’ on Playa D’en Bossa. I’m in love with the place! You have the space to relax but if you fancy getting up and having a little dance you can rave your socks off all day with the music blasting out from the bars.”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“I’m yet to do an IMS but I would think it’s more business rather than pleasure. The same goes for ADE, there seems to be a little bit more of a serious attitude to the initial reason these music conferences were set up. Miami on the other hand, is just a week’s worth of partying!”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“Space without a doubt. It’s the most pristine, clean, well maintained club on the Island. Not only is it huge, but even when it’s packed out you still feel cool as the air conditioning units are top notch. That’s what I like about the club, they care (to a certain extent) about the ravers!”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Croatia! I have two dates over there this year at a club called ‘Papaya’ on the Island of Pag. It’s quickly becoming recognised as a staple clubbing destination. On rotation they have acts like Axwell, Hardwell, Armin Van Buuren and Eddie Halliwell to name a few. That screams party destination to me!”\n\nDonati & Amato\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“It was like finding the centre of the Earth!!! Clubbing was going on in every corner…we felt like we had found a new home.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“Pacha was the first club that we went to but the first real DJ set that comes to mind was Paul Oakenfold mid nineties.”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“We have a guest residency at the Paradise Club in Mykonos where we will be taking along a few of the DJ’s that are part of our crew. Obviously we will be playing all over Italy as usual from Riccione to Forte Dei Marmi right down to Puglia… we are also in discussions for making our debut at Privilege in Ibiza.”\n\nWhat one track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“Donati & Amato ‘Back In My Arms’ of course.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“David Morales ‘Needin’ You’, even if it isn’t exactly our sound it still seems to sum up the Island.\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“Yes because a fairer price would definitely allow the club goers to try more than just a few places which in turn would benefit the market itself.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“The bar that is full of lovely people dressed nicely and the beach that is full of lovely people undressed nicely…”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“It is the right mixture of business and pleasure where things get done in some nice surroundings.”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“Privilege & Pacha…”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Mykonos and the great Paradise Club.”\n\nD.O.N.S.\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“I was simply amazed by the vibe and atmosphere and thought “damn this is a craziest place on this planet for music junkies.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“The first club I went to in Ibiza and actually played at that very night was Es Paradis alongside Dave Pearce. That was back in 2000.”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“South Of France, Miami, Cyprus, Sri Lanka, Morocco, NYC and many more. And I will of course most likely end up in Ibiza, like every year…”\n\nWhat 1 track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“My current single “Searching For Love”, out on Beatport! Check out the official music video shot in Miami on my channel:www.youtube.com/donsdjtv.\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“Layo & Bushwacka -‘Love Story’. I simply love this track.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“I definitely do.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“Blue Marlin, Playa Es Jondal”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Haven’t joined it so far but heard it’s good for both and I will definitely try it out next year.”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“Very hard to tell. I would say Pacha even though it’s the only one of the top ones I have so far never played at.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Definitely Miami. Top DJs every night, for about 9 months a year.”\n\nEats Everything\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“I first went to Ibiza in 1997 or 1998. To be honest, me and a friend had gotten off our heads on the plane (I was only young, forgive me!) and we went straight to Privilege for Manumission which was the thing to go to at the time. It was mental and from that moment on it has had a special place in my heart.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJING?\n\n“As I said before, it was Manumission and I am pretty sure it was Boy George and Jon Pleased Wimmin. It was amazing.”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“So far confirmed I have Space and Pacha but there will hopefully be a few more additions to that soon enough.”\n\nWhat 1 track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“My next EP on Pets, a track called ‘Jagged Edge’ and my bootleg of Adam F – ‘Circles’!! Self indulgent I know but when in Rome…”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“Wow! That’s a tough one. Mmmm, now, this isn’t a record I like massively but the Boris Dlugosch remix of Moloko – ‘Sing It Back’ must have been played about 500 times when I was there for a week the year it came out. That always reminds me of Ibiza big time. Paperclip People – ‘Throw’ is synonymous with Ibiza for me also.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“I couldn’t possibly comment. If people are willing to pay it then that is their choice. Ibiza is a ridiculously expensive place. Always has been, always will be.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“Favourite beach is Benirras, favourite bar is probably Amanté, which incidentally I am getting married at in October!!”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Bit of both!!!”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“I personally like Space, especially on opening and closing nights.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Bristol!!!!!!!!”\n\nFerry Corsten\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“I first found Ibiza a real party island where everyone who went was out to go nuts. Nowadays, I’ve realized it’s not only a place to go out and have fun but also a great city to relax and unwind.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“Es Paradis was the very first club I played on Ibiza. But it was such a long time ago, puff.”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“I will be playing at some big events like Tomorrowland, Global Gathering, Electronic Family, Street Parade, Electric Zoo, Nature 1, CreamFields, and many more. Full On Ferry is back in Ibiza this year. Also, I will be participating Dance Valley with my very own Full On Ferry tent!”\n\nWhat one track are you looking forward to spinning in Ibiza this Summer?\n\n“There’s not really one track. I will play a lot of great tracks this summer. Besides, a lot of new music is yet coming out this year from my label. So who knows what new things are going to shake the dancefloor by then!”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“Very difficult question…I’d really like to answer it but there’s not a single track that sums my whole Ibiza experience up.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“Depends on the event really. Some parties are definitely worth your money, while others are not. It’s for the visitor to decide!”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“There are a few great clubs around. I’ll be playing in Eden this year in San Antonio.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“To me, that’s Las Vegas! These parties are absolutely unbelievable.”\n\nGary Caos\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“I was really surprised. I was young and everything was so perfect. Everywhere you could breathe an air of celebration…in a simple word…MAGIC!”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“The first club I saw was PRIVILEGE…a super and so full of people! I was shocked and it was a really great experience to discover this new world for me! Usually in Italy the clubs are not so big!”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“This summer for sure Italy and we are planning a European tour and also Asia and Korea.”\n\nWhat one track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“For sure I will play my forthcoming single GARY CAOS feat.Mad Dog ” No Mercy” which will be released on EGO!”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“Frankie Knuckles “Your Love”.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“I think is a bit expensive but for sure you can have fun and listen the most famous dj’s of the world…so,in the summer you can spend this money.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“For me Mojito on Playa D’en Bossa and my favourite beach is Aguas Blanca.”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Hehehe. BUSINESS and PLEASURE!”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“`Mmmm, difficult to choose as all the clubs are great!! Maybe AMNESIA.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“The second? Kazantip (Ukraina) in my opinion….AMAZING!”\n\nGraham Sahara\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“I was really young and had never travelled alone before. I was amazed at how friendly everyone was and the really nice vibe there was.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“The first club I went to was Pacha and Reche was behind the decks.”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“You will be able to find me at Pacha and KM5 most nights of the week. Then I have a fair few gigs away as well taking in France, Switzerland, Sweden and the UK amongst others.”\n\nWhat 1 track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“Mmmm tricky question. There’s a lot of good music out and about at the moment. Although I would say the new track from myself and Central Avenue – ‘Work’ which has been tearing up the dancefloor recently and also Enigma are ones I’m looking forward to dropping to the summer crowds.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“Laguna – ‘Spiller From Rio’, one of the classics from the Space terrace many, many years ago. Anyone who was here in the 90´s should remember that one! I still play it now.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“Well it is expensive I´ll admit that. But then these days big names don’t come cheap. Also at places like Pacha there’s up to 5 different places to go and enjoy different styles of music and all with very good quality DJs and it’s the same in Space. I mean look at We Love, there’s how many different rooms going on there? Like 7 or something? That’s a lot of staff and DJs required for a whole night. It is expensive but you get what you pay for in life really don’t you?”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“Mmmm favourite bar? Well I love a bit of Lo Cura action in the winter as anyone who has been in there knows. It’s hard to get in there and get out and make it to work on time. And then for summer KM5. A classy place. Great cocktails and excellent vibes and the DJs are pretty good too! Beach wise, well me being the pale and pastie skinned person that I am, I would have to say any beach with an umbrella! But I think Formentera is a really nice place to visit, especially if you get a moped and explore and don’t just go to the same beach as everyone else. There’s a great venue over there called Gecko Beach Club that’s a lovely place to go visit and chill.”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Both good to time to meet everyone when they are relaxed and just before the madness kicks in and do a bit of business and then pleasure as its always a pleasure to see all the guys here in a relaxed vibe.”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“I´m going to be diplomatic and say it’s a toss up between Pacha and Amnesia. It depends on what style of music you prefer really. They are both so successful with pretty much every night of the summer being rammed and an amazing parties and DJs, they just cater for different crowds and sounds, so for me it depends on what kind of music is your flavour as to which club is best!”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Mmmm again that’s tricky one. I do love a bit of Brazil myself. Great atmospheres and great parties. There are some many places now getting into house music or dance music depending on your style! But as people are getting more and more into the music, it’s opening up new places that are really taking off. But I think in the end I may going to have to go with Brazil. Naming one spot there is really difficult. There’s too many good places, but Sao Paolo is cool as it’s really diverse musically, which in my book is always a good thing.”\n\nAnonymous story you would like to tell?\n\n“No tales on tour, surely you know the rules? Besides, what happens in Ibiza stays on facebook anyway! Ha ha!”\n\nHeavy Feet\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“Like all Mediterranean locations, time is of little issue! It was unfortunate however that our first gigs over there (playing Space on Sunday, then some after parties and smaller gigs) were a part of a quick, three day, three gig stopover, so we didn’t really get anytime to make the most of that Mediterranean vibe.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“The first club we ever went to was Space. The Chemical Brothers were playing, it was their 20th anniversary, and we were playing too! Quite an amazing first Ibiza club experience.”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“This Summer we’re playing two dates for Rocknrolla at Eden (dates TBA) in June and September. We’re really psyched to come out to Ibiza this summer, despite what can guaranteed to only be a whistle stop tour (as always)! We’re hoping to bring Nate James with us, the vocalist who featured on our recent single ‘Back Foot’, and our MC Switch with us also, just to get the full show going; decks, fx and vocals, that’s how we roll.”\n\nWhat 1 track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“Always a hard question! As we make such a lot of music, spanning many genres (all shades of house, from the Ibiza vibes to the Chicago-influenced, to the heavy bass vibes, plus some dubstep influenced stuff), it’s hard to pick really. As DJ sets have become more about dropping your new, upfront tracks, I reckon our forthcoming single ‘Collect All & Rave’, which is very much our take on Chicago house, with a cheeky 90’s twist on the vocal front.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“I suppose we should be uber cool here and say something classic like Joe Smooth ‘Promised Land’, or some super exclusive Sven Vath rinsed techno track, but in all fairness, if we think back to our youth, and what Ibiza was about, at least on a commercial front, some old late 90’s trance monster like Southside Spinners ‘Luvstruck’ is probably the one! Actually, that said on a (cooler!) housier note, lets say Roger Sanchez’s ‘Another Chance’. Phew.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“They do sound utterly ridiculous. I don’t know if anyone had spotted that there’s an alleged recession on? Although that said, people with money will always have money, and people with money have always liked spending it in Ibiza. We’ve never been on the island clubbing, as such, although James is over for stag do this summer, so maybe he’ll be encountering the 80 euro door tariffs that week, who knows, although I foresee a bunch of last minute emails being sent to promoters we know on the island the week prior to the trip though, to be honest!\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“That we’ve found so far… Kumaharas in San Jose. Love that spot. Beach-wise, shameful as it may be, we’re yet to have found time to go and chill on an Ibizian beach whilst one the island. Terrible, we know!\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“We’re still yet to do IMS, but if we do manage to take the time off from the studio one year, we’ll most likely be there in a business capacity.”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“I’m going to have to say Space, simply as it was the first club we played on the island. It did blow our minds! We were booked to play Privilege a couple of years back, but it didn’t end up happening the night we arrived. I suspect it would have been way too vast to get a vibe in though, and despite Space being pretty monstrous as a venue, size-wise, it’s still mint.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“It’d be criminal to not say Manchester, so we’re going with that. Gotta rep’ the home town!\n\nHenry John Morgan\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“Ibiza is amazing, it has the right balance between nature and clubbing.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“The first time in Ibiza I went to Privilege to see Carl Cox and it was massive.”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“I’m playing in Italy every week in many clubs positioned in different cities. In July I’ll play in Mykonos at Paradise.”\n\nWhat one track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“If I say ‘Destination Of Love’ by Henry John Morgan is it a problem.? I’m joking! Not considering any of my own tracks, one track that I’ll be playing there is Wolfgang Gartner – ‘Redline’.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“I’m in love with Tiesto’s music so I’ll say ‘Adagio For Strings’. Every time I hear it, it gives me beautiful sensations. I also think the strongest track for Ibiza from the last 10 years is SHM “One”.\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“It depends, if the party is also a good show I think it is right.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“I like the atmosphere as it develops on Bora Bora. Funny…”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“This is easy to answer – BOTH.”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“Every club in Ibiza is massive. But I think that Pacha is nearest to my style of music.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“I have to say Miami but there are lot’s of new places emerging around the world.”\n\nHoxton Whores\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“An amazing place, somewhere you instantly know you’re going to Love. Mayhem and excitement as you step off that plane, a stomach full of butterflies and a lack of patience, eager to get the best nightlife in the world for the past 30 years. But once you find your way around Ibiza you discover on top of the 24/7 party scene there are many lovely scenic places and numerous beautiful beaches (although it may take some time to discover, as you have to get all those crazy party antics out of your system first).”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“The Space Terrace was the first clubbing experience for me. I’d heard so much about it back home from my mates that I couldn’t wait to get there. We literally stepped off the plane on the Sunday morning and got in a cab straight to the club, dropped off our bags on the way and we were there! It was back in the days when it was the original, original Terrace and open all day. Brandon Block and Alex P were in control of the decks and boy were they smashing it up, the place was rocking and I still clearly remember what an awesome day we had! It’s such a shame the Terrace couldn’t have remained like that nowadays!”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“Really looking forward to this summer with tours of Asia & Brazil next month and Russia and Poland the month after. Should be out in Ibiza in August and various other summer holiday destinations in between, as well as numerous gigs in the UK, so the summer is set to be a fun time!”\n\nWhat 1 track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“This one’s easy for me as we’ve just done a collaboration with Joe Smooth on one of the all time classic house anthems “Promised Land” – many a DJ’s all time favourite house record including mine. Joe has re-sung the vocals and we’ve done the mix which has come out sounding amazing. We’ve kept the original melody but brought the track up to date and it’s due for release on Toolroom Records, early June! The DJs I’ve already played it to have begged for a copy so I’m really looking forward for this one getting out there!”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“Again this is easy for me as one record clearly sticks out in my mind – Energy 52 “Cafe Del Mar” – what an anthem and not only does it carry the name of the iconic bar, but has one of the best known riffs in house history! Even now I have a fresh mix from Paul Thomas that I currently play out which still gets an amazing reaction!”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“In my view yes, but I don’t own the venues. I think it makes it very tough for clubbers to enjoy the full Ibiza experience as they have to constantly worry about money, which takes away from just being able to go there and let your hair down. Ibiza has always been reasonably expensive but now more than ever and it limits the times people get to go! A shame as a lot of clubbers will miss out, especially with drinks being so expensive too!”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“For me nowadays i like to chill out at the Blue Marlin, great to relax on one of the beds have a few beers and a bite to eat but still enjoy the beach and the setting. In younger years I spent many hours at Cafe Del Mar and Mambo especially at Sunset and I still have to pop there on occasions to soak up the amazing atmosphere it creates. This year I’m looking forward to getting down to Ocean Club, the new open air beach bar opening in San Antonio which seems to be getting some great hype! “\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Business first as it’s a great place to catch up with all the industry faces but as it coincides generally on the space opening seems to be a bit of pleasure tucked in there as well!”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“Very difficult to call as you love different clubs for different reason and they all have their own great nights! Pacha, Amnesia and Space throughout the years have consistently held some of the best parties, so i’m gonna have to call it a tie on these three!”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Most definitely has to be Las Vegas as the scene there at the moment is outrageous, in fact I would say it currently gives Ibiza a very good run for it’s money!”\n\nAnonymous story you would like to tell?\n\n“Pass as I don’t know who’s listening! Been some great nights out and antics in Ibiza through the years including great nights out with the Legend Brandon Block, Gary the other half of the Hoxton Whores and a very close mate of mine Tony Wheelchair – but gonna keep all the details close to my heart!”|\n\nIain Thomson\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“My first visit to the island was in ’83 so it was a totally different animal back then. It was a package holiday with my mates and we spent most of the time in the west end. We didn’t make it to any clubs.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“Pacha. Frankie Knuckles.”\n\nWhy is Ibiza so magical?\n\n“From a clubbing perspective, it offers unparalleled access to the finest DJs and producers from all over the world. Away from the club, the tolerant attitude that is visible all over the island makes it a warm and friendly place.”\n\nHow has Ibiza changed since you first went?\n\n“DJs are pop stars, open air clubbing disappeared then re-appeared, San Antonio Bay has sprung up and there’s a motorway through the centre of the island. Many of the existing resorts have changed beyond recognition.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“I guess this is payback for the amount of times I have asked this question of other people. Turns out, summing up Ibiza in one record is virtually impossible. Can I name a few favourites and leave it at that? Joe Smooth ‘Promised Land’, Josh Wink ‘Higher State Of Consciousness’, Spektrum ‘Kinda New’, Amé ‘Rej’.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“Definitely. I do think people expect to pay a certain level to get into the bigger clubs and because of that the parties will still be busy. I also think that more and more smaller parties will spring up and offer cheaper alternatives.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“Again, too many to choose one. Mambo for sunset is still something I really enjoy but Nassau for a day at the beach. Beach wise, it may be more popular than ever but Benirras still does it for me.”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Both. I’m a big fan of working and playing hard.”\n\nWhat is the best club & club night in Ibiza?\n\n“Personally I like the variety in Space, although I had some great nights in Sankeys last summer and do still enjoy a Pacha night out.”\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the pop live artists invasion of Ibiza?\n\n“I think it is inevitable, with every pop act adopting a four-four attitude to their releases. That commercial side might not be everyone’s cup of tea but a strong overground scene normally means a strong underground scene.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“Bali. There are several similarities to the attitude and beauty of the island and with more clubs opening, the scene is vibrant.”\n\nTell us about Essential Ibiza…\n\n“Essentialibiza brings the people who visit the island closer to the people who make the island tick – the club owners, club brand owners, promoters, restauranteurs, bar owners, hoteliers, shop owners and island characters. We are not focused on any particular niche and offer a very broad look at the island.”\n\nwww.essentialibiza.com\n\nIgor Marijuan\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“Magic all around. I loved it.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to and who was playing?\n\n“The Space opening in 2000 with Tania Vulkano.”\n\nWhat makes Ibiza so special?\n\n“The people.”\n\nWhat are the main changes on the island since you first went?\n\n“There have been lots of changes, but the attitude is the same.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“Silicone Soul ‘Right On.”\n\nWhat is your favourite bar in Ibiza?\n\n“All the bars which have an Ibiza resident DJ playing.”\n\nFavouirte beach?\n\n“The little new beach between Cala Compte and Cala Bassa near ses roques.”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Bussines is pleasure for me.” What do you think about the invasion of pop acts into Ibiza this year?\n\n“It’s good for Ibiza, but I don’t like pop. I like the underground artists that will play for the very first time in ibiza this season.”\n\nIf Ibiza is party destination No 1 – where is No. 2?\n\n“Berlin, Brazil maybe Romania. For me though, Mexico.”\n\nInaya Day\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“The entire plane partied on the way, then when I hit the white Isle, I KNEW I was in for a great time as I saw a topless woman ride by on a moped and heard music everywhere. It’s a paradise where one can never be bored.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“The first clubs I went to were Space and Pacha and I think Mousse T was DJing.”\n\nWhat 1 track are you looking forward to hearing there this Summer?\n\n“I would be singing my new track with Marc JB/Bimbo Jones/Frankie Knuckles, called ‘EVERY BREATH’.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“Keep Pushin’, since that’s the first song I ever sang there and the first song with which I did the Strictly Rhythm tour.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“Yes indeed. Flights are expensive and the cost of living is just crazy. People party to release. I don’t think they should be deprived that privilege because of a high door price.”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“Don’t quite know. I’d have to sample them all to give an educated answer.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“MIAMI!!!!”\n\nJochen Miller\n\nWhat was your first impressions of Ibiza when you first stepped onto the white isle?\n\n“The first time I set foot on Ibiza was back in 2002 and I was stunned by the relaxed atmosphere. All the beautiful bays impressed me and the people I met were very laidback and kind. I love being on the beach, with some nice lounge music and then when the music gets turned up a bit… Bring on the mojito’s!”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“When we arrived on a Sunday, we didn’t even take the time to unpack, I just dug something up from my suitcase and went straight on to Space. Carl Cox was playing and it was an unforgettable night!”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“Big news and so excited to tell you but not just yet “\n\nWhat one track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“Well, my DJ sets get refreshed every week, I love to play new stuff, so big chance my Ibiza-favourite for this summer is yet to be released.”\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“D*Note – ‘Shed My Skin’. Not only the track but also the video is a great representative of the Ibiza-vibe, laidback, sunny and just fun.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“I guess the clubs have their reasons for charging what they do. Ibiza’s price range is in general somewhat higher than in the rest of Europe. But then again, the atmosphere is always amazing and clubs are open ’till really late, or should I say early in the morning…”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“I’m not someone who visits bars, I usually head straight to the club. But if I can name one restaurant in particular, I’m very fond of Madrigal in the harbour. And when it comes to beaches, I love Nassau at Playa d’en Bossa. But I’m definitely going to check out other beach clubs this year!”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Both!”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“Oh that’s so hard! I love Privilege, but have also had wonderful nights at Space and Pacha. Still amazes me there are so many fabulous clubs on one island.”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“The U.S.A.!

It felt like home.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“DJ Pippi at Pacha.”\n\nWhy is Ibiza so magical?\n\n“Incredible natural beauty and the diversity of people.”\n\nHow has Ibiza changed since you first went?\n\n“Ibiza has become more glitzy and up market.

Now it seems to attract a younger and more synthetic type of crowd, and the clubs are extremely overcrowded. I miss the more laid back feeling it had some years ago, but it’s always a great place to check out new people and different sounds.”\n\nWhat was the first club you ever went to in Ibiza and who was DJing?\n\n“Space, of course, with Sasha and Digweed. This was before the renovation, when everyone was outside during the day. And then DC10…”\n\nWhere are you playing this Summer?\n\n“Spain and Berlin.”\n\nWhat 1 track are you looking forward to spinning there this Summer?\n\n“I guess tracks from my ‘Dark Matters’ album, or any of the remixes from Ben Sims, Nick Warren, Timo Maas, Gabriel Ananda, Hernan Cattaneo and SQL. “\n\nWhat classic record sums up Ibiza for you from over the years?\n\n“That’s like picking a favourite vacation, but there’s one track that sticks in my mind as a type of sound that’s no longer around unfortunately, and that would be ‘Roaches’ by Peace Division.”\n\nDo you think door prices at 80euros are too expensive this summer?\n\n“At that price they should come with a foot massage, for better dancing! I think clubs should be subsidised like they are in Berlin.”\n\nFavourite bar and beach in Ibiza?\n\n“Probably Sa Trincha for spaghetti a la marinara and the great sounds.”\n\nIMS – business or pleasure?\n\n“Unfortunately, I can’t make it to IMS this year, but it’s always a great place to meet people within the industry.”\n\nWhat is the best club in Ibiza?\n\n“I would say Space because it’s closer to my sound, but I miss DC10…”\n\nIf Ibiza is the number one party destination in the world – where is No. 2?\n\n“That would definitely be Berlin, which is like a flat-fee on Ibiza, but with more variety, and more affordable, and more rain… “\n\nKramnik’s new “Dark Matters” Remix EP Vol 1 is out in July via Kram Records.
