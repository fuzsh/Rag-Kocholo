        "text": "Currently considered one of the world’s leading entertainment promoters, SuperMartXé returns to the biggest club in the world, Privilege Ibiza, for the 11th season. The organizers said:”Back to rule Friday nights, every week as the curtain rises SuperMartXé will make history once more, not only with their new themes and top class line-up, but also for the best show of technology and most amazing staging (360º) of the Ibiza party up until now.\n\nUnder the slogan We Own The Show, SuperMartXé officially welcomes a new stage of #Evolution in their shows and of musical #Revolution in their DJ booth, completely revamping their sound experience and returning to their house roots, and providing tunes from the most elegant and quintessential classics of the genre to the hottest, coolest house headliners of our time.“\n\nThese big names of house are among the first artists to be confirmed on the SuperMartXé Line-Up in Ibiza.\n\n2manydjs DJ Set, Benny Benassi, Mark Knight, Fedde Le Grand, WEISS, Illyus & Barrientos, David Tort, Robbie Rivera, David Penn, Superlover, Kryder, David Morales, The Cube Guys, Cedric Gervais, Though Love and ATFC, are some of the guests that have already been confirmed for the 11th season of SuperMartXé at Privilege Ibiza.\n\nThe organizers said:”It’s an honour for SuperMartXé to be able to host a DJ set by the Belgian duo 2manydjs (or as they’re also known, David and Stephen Dewaele). The brothers need no introduction, they are part of history and are stars of the dance music scene of today, not only thanks to their shows and DJ sets, but also for projects like Soulwax, their rock band, and the excellent programming of their online radio station Radio Soulwax. Since the 2002 release of their debut album “As heard on Radio Soulwax Volume 2”, acclaimed by fans and critics as a benchmark masterpiece of the art and technique of the mash-up, the duo haven’t stopped killing it on dance floors and at festivals the world over with their fun, eclectic sets that mix many different styles. They will be the act that gets SuperMartXé under way.\n\nAnother artist who needs no introduction is the legendary Italian DJ and producer Benny Benassi. Tracks such as “I Feel so Fine” and “Satisfaction” have been hits heard around the world for years and are part of the history of techno music. Benassi has also remixed contemporary artists such as DJ Tomcraft, Fischerspooner, Sonique and even Outkast.\n\nOne of the living legends of house, New Yorker David Morales will also join SuperMartXé in Ibiza for the summer. Following the success of “David Morales & The Bad Yard Club”, his debut album on Mercury Records in 1993, Morales became one of the first superstar DJs. The Grammy winner has remixed and produced more than 500 releases by artists such as Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Eric Clapton, Pet Shop Boys, U2, Whitney Houston and Jamiroquai.\n\nAnother of the big names on today’s international House Music scene will land in Ibiza direct from Utrecht: the DJ and producer Fedde Le Grand. Honoured with countless awards, the Dutchman has remixed artists such as Coldplay, Madonna, will.i.am, Robbie Williams, Everything But The Girl, Fatboy Slim, and others such as Shakira, Rihanna, Mariah Carey, Faithless, and even Michael Jackson. Writer of such legendary tracks as “Put Your Hands Up for Detroit” and “Let Me Think About It”, Le Grand has been one of the top 25 on the DJ Mag Top 100 for over a decade, as well as being a highlight at festivals such as Ultra Music Festival, Tomorrowland, Untold Festival, Parookaville, Sunrise Festival, Coachella, EDC, STORM Festival, Medusa, Big Slap Festival, Exit Festival, Global Gathering and Creamfields among others.\n\nAs well as being a DJ and producer of house music, the UK’s Mark Knight is the owner of Toolroom Records, one of the industry’s most renowned labels, which recently celebrated 15 years of success. Knight will be at SuperMartXé for a very special occasion, the celebration of our 11th anniversary on the island on July the 12th.\n\nThe Miami-based Puerto Rican Robbie Rivera, with his Sexy House – as it’s been dubbed by fans and critics – will also be on the island to get the SuperMartXé dancefloor rocking. Rivera is known for his association with Armada Music, for his countless releases on Juicy Music, Spinnin, Nervous, Axtone, Cartel, Doorn, Dimmak and Ultra Music, for smash hits like “Bang” – which was used at the 2000 Sydney Olympics – and for his past remixes of tracks by U2, Kaskade, New Order, Erasure, and Basement Jaxx, among others.\n\nSuperMartXé will also host the London-born musician Weiss, one of the finest ambassadors of housemusic, with roots in old-school Jackin and ‘90s Chicago House. This British musician is the creator of tracks such as “My Sister”, “I Feel Better” and “I Believe” which have since become classics; recently, his acclaimed 2018 single “Feel My Needs” was number one on 5 international hit music charts as well as placing on the Radio 1 A-List. It was also selected as DJ Magazine’s single of the year in its “Best of British Winner” ranking.\n\nAnother famous duo – in this case Scottish -, Illyus & Barrientos will also be a part of SuperMartXé’s Opening Party on the island. Regulars with labels such as Defected, Suara, Toolroom, Exploited Records and Glasgow Underground among others, as well as on the stages of top festivals, they have come to be considered one of the best DJ and producer duos in the UK.\n\nThe DJ and producer from Barcelona, David Tort, will also be joining us for the Opening Party Tort’s 30 year career has been full of huge moments for lovers of house from around the world; not for nothing is he one of the genre’s best known Spanish artists worldwide. Moments like his first international hit in 1998 with ‘Drums of Love’, released in more than 15 countries, or his 2006 remix of DJ Disciple’s ‘Work it Out’, or his many sets in such iconic clubs as Stereo Montreal, Tomorroland, Zouk (Singapore) and Avalon (Los Angeles).\n\nIn August SuperMartXé will be visited on two occasions by one of the most illustrious producers on the global house scene, ATFC, whose stunning discography includes releases on labels such as Armada Subjekt, Toolroom, Defected, Ministry of Sound, Onephatdeeva, Slip’N’Slide, V2 Japan, Ninja Tune,… He recently joined forces with David Penn on a thumping new single called ‘Dynamite’.

As a producer Penn has released more than 300 tracks and remixes such as Kadoc ‘The Nightrain’, Deux ‘Sun Rising Up’, ‘Fight Again’, Chus & Penn ‘Baila’, ‘Will I (Discover Love), ‘What Is House’, and hits such as “Lovin´U” and “Con Son” . He has remixed artists such as Sandy Rivera, Boy George, Simply Red, Jon Cutler, Masters At Work, Mariah Carey, Adeva, Candi Staton, and many more. He was named Best House DJ in the last 5 editions of Deejaymags, and was named Best House DJ at the Vicious Music Awards in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and Best Artist of 2017 on traxsource.com.\n\nThe English DJ and producer Kryder, known as the king of groove house, will be one of the special guests at the SuperMartXé Anniversary on July the 12th. Since the release of ‘Aphrodite’ on Axtone Records, his rise has been unstoppable, taking him to festivals such as Creamfields, Mysteryland, Tomorrowland, Dance Valley, Ultra, Sensation, Electric Love and Medusa. 2018 was a big year for Kryder with the release of “Romani”, the first track on his own label, Kryteria Records, in collaboration with Spinnin Records and recorded with Steve Angello.\n\nThe SuperMartXé DJ booth will also twice play host to Berlin’s Superlover, a master at creating emotional and energetic melodies that bring elements of disco and funk to the latesthouse music. With tracks like “Love Machine” from 2015 and releases such as the “Talking Machine EP” 2016, and “Heart Drive” in 2017, he has made it to number one on all the top charts. One of his appearances will be at the SuperMartxé Anniversary.\n\nFans of Cedric Gervais will also have a double opportunity to enjoy sets from this house music DJ and producer in Ibiza this summer. He won the Grammy for Best Remixed Recording with his mix of Lana del Rey’s “Summertime Sadness” which reached number four on the British charts and number six on the Billboard Top 100. He has collaborated with names like Lenny Kravitz, David Guetta, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Lana del Rey, and most recently with Juanes on the song “Este Amor”. Cedric is also the founder of Sleaze Records and SleazeTech Records.\n\nIn July and August the Italian producers Roberto Intrallazzi and Luca Provera, also known as The Cube Guys, arrive from Italy with their club DJ project, B2B, a full progressive house-based show of banging vibes combined with tribal elements and voices. They have remixed Anastacia, Sophie Ellis Bextor, Steve Angello, Moloko, Coolio, Luciana, Ultra Nate, Roger Sanchez, Bob Sinclar, Suzanne Palmer, India, Romathony, Shawn Christopher, Ralph Falcon, Fish Go Deep, Yello, and many more.\n\nLondon duo Tough Love will also play two dates at SuperMartXé. Known for their unique house style with its origins in the rhythms of the UK’s underground, and rich in references to 90s Garage and RnB, since the release of their debut single “So Freakin’ Tight” their rise has been unstoppable. The track won Best Single of the Year at the 2014 Bass Music Awards and they were named among the 50 best house acts in the world by Beatport in 2018. Their radio show Get Twisted Radio gets more than 2.5 million listeners a month around the world.“\n\nThen, the Resident artists for SuperMartXé’s 11th season in Ibiza.\n\nSupermartXé media team said:”Juanjo Martin joins us again as a resident artist for the whole season of SuperMartXé on the island. His rise as a DJ has taken him all over the world, and as a producer he has had hits – now classics – such as ‘Maniac’, ‘Millennium’ and “I Believe in Dreams”, which reached number one in sales and on charts in 18 countries. Juanjo was also the first Spanish DJ to be selected as one of DJMAG UK’s prestigious 100 Best DJs in the World, at number 89.\n\nAnother much-anticipated return to the the SuperMartXé stage is that of Nalaya, a singer from the Canary Islands, who will perform at every date of the season. Named Best International Vocalist at the DNA Balada in Brazil, and Best Spanish Vocalist at the Vicious Music Awards, her discography includes tracks with S.Man ,Danny Romero, Breno Barreto , Roger Sanchez, Nacho Cano, Dan Slater and JimJam, among others.\n\nAnother return which will make long-term SuperMartXé fans happy is that of ABEL THE KID, producer, remixer and composer for Warner Music, Sony Music, Buce Records, Cr2 Records, Subliminal Records, Defected, Strictly Rhythm and Synergy Recordings, where he had three top ten tracks on Beatport in the same year; “Mi Tierra” at number 4, “In My House” at number 2 and “Zumba Socks” at number 1.\n\nFollowers of SuperMartXé will also be excited about the return of resident Javi Reina for the summer. An artist who has been touring the dancefloors of the world for nearly two decades now, he has more than 100 releases under his belt and has had shows at all the best clubs, events, and national and international festivals. He has received 8 national awards for Best Producer, Best DJ, and Best Record Label.\n\nDJ SANDY LOVE , DJ and music psychologist, will also be a special guest in the SuperMartXé DJ booth.”\n\nSuperMartXé revamps their show, converting it into a 360º experience.\n\nThe organizers explained:”Magic and creativity continue to be the foundations of the great theatre of dreams that is SuperMartXé. But the difference now is that the experience will go beyond just what’s happening on the stage; it will leap onto the dancefloor to fully immerse partygoers in the whole awesome spectacle and fill the temple of music that is Privilege Ibiza with emotion.\n\nFor this, SuperMartXé will include not only the very best stylists, make-up artists, and prop artists, but also the best lineup of performers, acrobats, fire show specialists, singers, masters of different electronic instruments and many other artists. Together, they will tell a story and energise the crowd from both the stage and the dancefloor to complete the 360º experience of the viewer, who will not only listen and watch but also be able to actively live the experience with all their senses, becoming an active part of the theatricality of a live SuperMartXé show. Among the many surprises that SuperMartXé has prepared for this season, the complete revamping of its themes is one of the most notable. More irreverent, sensual, and provocative than ever, with XXL theatrical and technological production values and revolutionary artistic direction, SuperMartXé can reveal the first four themes of the season: Cyber Geisha, Freak Show, Peep Show and Wild Cathedral. This summer, SuperMartXé will take you to the future. A future ruled by an army of Cyber Geishas from the 22nd century, inhabiting a totally eclectic and futuristic cyber punkversion of Planet Earth. Privilege will be transfomed into a new world, combining a classic architectural style, technologically awesome backgrounds, and neon lights and luminous signs, with the sensuality and disconcerting grace of a universe of Cyber Geishas – among other beings – from another era. The crowd will happily submit to them. The next journey takes us to the wildest, most sinful side of the SuperMartXé festival: Wild Cathedral, packed with irreverent nuns and pretty altar boys, shining altars and a congregation of sexy rockers, performers, acrobats and dancers, both on and off the stage. Ready to confess all your sins?The big display windows and neon lights of a city inspired by Amsterdam’s Red Light District, Peep Show will be a journey through our desires, our carnal passions, our deepest fantasies. A journey guided by a massive stage production, urban and underground as well as ostentatious and luxurious, and which will exude luxury and sensuality above all else. Pure desire throughout Privilege’s main hall… And the final journey – which can just now be revealed – will immerse us under a giant red and white tent, with a host of characters with enormous muscles and incredible strength, beautiful and extravagant concubines, masters of ceremonies, acrobats, contortionists, tightrope walkers, fire jugglers, stilt walkers, knife throwers, snake charmers… all of this with the eroticism and sophistication of a grand burlesque show the likes of which have never been seen before on the island. The new Freak Show from SuperMartXé involves an ambitious stage setup, converting Privilege’s main room into a huge stage, and filling this new show with all the magic of the circus. The great theatre of dreams has never been so immense. Let the show begin!There is still a lot more to be revealed and above all a lot to be enjoyed, so for the moment just remember that this summer in Ibiza, beginning on Friday, June the 28th, you have a date with the inimitable SuperMartXé show at Privilege Ibiza .”\n\nHere you have the official flyer! Save the dates, because of SuperMartXé is back!"
