        "text": "Our Ibiza correspondent Andrew Darwin has been basking in the island warmth all summer long. But if you think it’s all soaking up the sun and soaking in the alcohol, think again. Here’s what a typical 24 hours looks like for him.\n\n8am–1pm\n\nI’m awake early (by Ibiza standards!) and working on my laptop in my flat. My summer life in Ibiza consists primarily of working as editor of Uneek Ibiza, a website I set up last summer to cover the White Isle. I’m really proud of what we have achieved in just 12 months, and this summer is about building the site more and developing a presence on the island.\n\nThis morning, I have a lot of administrative work to catch up on, including requesting press passes for the club events we’re reviewing this week, writing features and club night reviews, promoting the site, updating our social media pages, and preparing interview questions. I’m also adding tracks to my USB stick, as I’m DJing at Kanya this afternoon at the Dirtyfunk pool party, and preparing for my interview with Hardwell later today.\n\n2–5pm\n\nMy friend (and Dirtyfunk promoter) Darren picks me up from my flat and drives us a couple of miles to Kanya, a beach bar on the famous Sunset Strip in San Antonio. I’m a resident DJ for the Dirtyfunk pool parties held here every Tuesday of the summer. There’s a nice, chilled vibe in perfect harmony with the beautiful setting in front of the sea. I play a set of vocal house tracks, including Adesse Versions’ “Pride,” andhim’s “Hausch,” Blonde’s “Higher Ground” (KANT remix) and Darz’s “Naga Viper.”\n\n7pm–midnight\n\nAfter leaving Kanya, I head back to my flat to have a shower (Ibiza is so hot during peak summer, and I’m sweaty!) before heading out to interview Hardwell at Ushuaïa. Darren picks up my friend Natalie and me and whisks us away to the club, which is at the other end of the island, in Playa den Bossa. The place is teeming; when we arrive at Ushuaïa around 8pm, there are already around 8,000 in attendance. Hardwell is due to play the headlining slot from 10pm–midnight for his weekly Carnival event. Ushuaïa has an impressive weekly lineup that includes Avicii, David Guetta, Hardwell, Axwell / Ingrosso, Armin van Buuren and Ants (for their underground techno event).\n\nI have 10 minutes to interview Hardwell. He tells me that he started his Carnival event this summer because he wanted to have a super colorful event. He also talks about his recent Tomorrowland performance in Belgium and his latest single, “Mad World” with Jake Reese.\n\nFor a DJ twice voted the world’s #1, Hardwell is an extremely humble and likeable guy. His favorite gigs of all time include Ultra 2013, his first-ever I Am Hardwell concert in Amsterdam, and the closing of his world tour in Madison Square Garden. He also has a genuine love for Ibiza because the visitors are really educated music followers, and all of the big-name DJs play here regularly.\n\nAfter the interview, Natalie and I head into the main area of Ushuaïa and watch Hardwell’s set. Needless to say, he rocks the gig, with thousands screaming with their hands in the air.\n\nMidnight–3am\n\nAfter grabbing some food in Playa den Bossa, Natalie returns to her apartment. I head by disco bus (a service that travels the Ibiza club circuit all summer long) to the Vista Club room at the world’s biggest club, Privilege, for tonight’s Connect Ibiza event. The Vista is a great room to party in (and offers great views), and Connect Ibiza is one of the best trance nights on the island.\n\nPaul Oakenfold is DJing tonight, and what I witness is a true lesson in trance from one of the biggest masters of the genre. Other DJs may be playing more commercial music, but Oakenfold has remained true to his roots and unleashes a set of beautiful, driving, melodic tracks. Oakey is a great performer to watch, constantly interacting with the crowd, who are raising their hands for every track.\n\n3–8am\n\nAt 3am, I take the disco bus to Amnesia, about a mile down the road. Amnesia is one of my favorite clubs in the world, and tonight’s Together/Defected event is always a popular and busy night. I meet my friend Carl outside, and we both head in. The main room is hosted by Together, and tonight has acts like Gotsome, Netsky, Sub Focus, and headliners Chase & Status. It’s bouncing drum & bass at its finest, and the crowd jumps to every track.\n\nOver on the Terrace, Defected brings house music heavyweights in the form of Sam Divine, Sonny Fodera, Tube & Berger, Butler & Bontan and headliners Gorgon City. Defected is the UK’s #1 house music label, and it’s clear why: This is a full room with a great vibe and atmosphere. Tracks such as Justin Martin & Ardalan’s “Function,” Floorplan’s “Never Grow Old,” Claude VonStroke’s “Eye Eye,” and of course, Gorgon City’s “Ready for Your Love” and “Imagination” provide some of the highlights of the night.\n\nI leave the club around 6:30 am and grab some slices of pizza before heading back to my flat in San Antonio. It’s been a busy day, so needless to say, it doesn’t take me long to fall flat asleep by 8am!\n\nFind out where the party’s headed next on Andrew’s website and Twitter.\n\nShare\n\nTags"
