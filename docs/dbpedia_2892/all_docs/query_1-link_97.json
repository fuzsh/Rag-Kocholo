        "text": "Why is Ibiza so popular?\n\nIt’s a short flight away from most European countries, it’s extremely scenic with beautiful sunsets and stunning beaches, there are a lot of daytime activities, and last but not least – the world famous nightclubs featuring all the best EDM DJs so you can party until sunrise!\n\nWhere is the nightlife in Ibiza?\n\nPlaya d’en Bossa on the east coast of the island, just south of Ibiza town, boasts the longest beach of the island and a pulsating nightlife. Here you will find a myriad of restaurants and bars for all tastes and budgets, smaller clubs like Sankeys and super-clubs like the world famous open-air venue Ushuaïa and the neighbouring Hï Ibiza, the newest club on the island.\n\nSan Antonio, on the west coast of Ibiza, is home to the world famous sunset strip and its cafés, as well as having a broad beach and very lively town centre with lots of bars and smaller nightclubs. Daytime open-air clubbing around the pool can be experienced at the beach club O Beach Ibiza or at Ibiza Rocks Hotel. At night the party continues until dawn in the large clubs Eden and Es Paradis right next to the palm tree-lined promenade.\n\nIn the capital Ibiza Town, you will also find countless restaurants, bars, shops and a very international crowd, many in the enchanting setting of the historic old town. The famous super-club Pacha is only a short walk from the centre, as are the smaller venues Heart and Lío.\n\nWhat are the hottest clubs in Ibiza?\n\nThe hottest clubs in Ibiza right now are Hi Ibiza, Pacha, Ushuaia, Privilege, and Amnesia.\n\nWhere should I stay in Ibiza?\n\nIf you’re choosing where you stay based on the proximity to big clubs, then it is worth remembering that Pacha is in Ibiza Town near the harbour; Ushuaïa, Hï Ibiza and Octan Ibiza (formerly Sankeys) are in Playa d’en Bossa; DC10 is on the road to Las Salinas beach; Es Paradis and Eden are in San Antonio and Amnesia and Privilege are both situated on the main road between Ibiza Town and San Antonio, close to San Rafael.\n\nIt’s also worth knowing that it’s illegal to sleep on the beach. So if you go to the beach to catch an early sunrise post-clubbing, try your best not to fall asleep. The police patrol regularly, and they’re not kindly disposed to backpackers sleeping on the sand.\n\nHow much does it cost to get into a club in Ibiza?\n\nEntry to the top clubs can cost you anywhere from 50-80 euros. We generally recommend buying tickets in advance if you’re set on going to a show. You can buy Ibiza tickets online or at vendors on the street. Presale tickets won’t generally be that much cheaper than GA at the door, but you can usually get in faster.\n\nWhen is the best time to go to Ibiza?\n\nThe typical Ibiza tourist season runs from the beginning of May until the end of October. During this time, the majority of bars, restaurants and clubs are open, so it is the ideal time to visit.\n\nThe clubbing season starts mid May and continues until the middle of October. By May most of the super-clubs like Amnesia, Pacha, Ushuaïa, Hï Ibiza and Privilege will open their doors with spectacular opening parties, always big, big highlights in the clubbing calendar for island residents and tourists alike, a good reason to visit this beautiful island in that month.\n\nClosing parties typically start around the middle of September and continue through the second week of October.\n\nWhile summer is the busiest period for nightlife, some clubs will also be open during other times such as New Years Eve and Easter.\n\nWhat month do Ibiza’s clubs open / close?\n\nOpening parties start in May, the last closing parties take place in mid October.\n\nAre clubs in Ibiza expensive?\n\nGoing clubbing in Ibiza can definitely be expensive. Entry will run you 50-80 dollars, and drinks start around $15 per drink. Bottle service typically starts at 1000 euros for the cheapest tables.\n\nIs alcohol cheap in Ibiza?\n\nDrinks at the club typically start around $15 per drink. You can buy alcohol at the convenience stores for cheap though, so we highly recommend pregaming before hitting the clubs. Ibiza nightlife doesn’t really get going until after midnight anyway!\n\nWhat are the best music festivals in Ibiza?\n\nBecause Ibiza already has so many parties every weekend, there aren’t really any annual music festivals that take place in Ibiza.\n\nWhat is the drinking age in Ibiza?\n\nThe legal age limit to buy alochol is 18, to buy tobacco it’s 16. You must be 18 to enter the clubs.\n\nDo you need ID to get into clubs in Ibiza?\n\nID checking is rare – you typically don’t have to show ID unless you look really young.\n\nCan you go clubbing in Ibiza at 16?\n\nThe official age to go clubbing in Ibiza is 18, however ID checking is rare and you typically don’t have to show ID unless you look really young.\n\nWhat part of Ibiza has the best nightlife?\n\nPlaya d’en Bossa on the east coast of the island, just south of Ibiza town is the busiest area of Ibiza and features the most superclubs such as Ushuaïa and the neighbouring Hï Ibiza, the newest club on the island.\n\nWhat are the best day parties / pool parties in Ibiza?\n\nThe best day parties are: Ocean Beach Ibiza, Ushuaïa, Nikki Beach Ibiza, Ibiza Rocks, and O Beach Ibiza. Ibiza boat parties are also typically extremely fun as well and mostly take place during the day.\n\nWhat are the best EDM clubs in Ibiza?\n\nAlmost all clubs in Ibiza feature Electronic Dance Music of some sort. Privilege, Hi Ibiza, Amnesia, and Pacha are the biggest and most well known.\n\nWhat are the best hip hop clubs in Ibiza?\n\nEven though Ibiza is known as the dance music lover’s paradise, there are still a few hip hop, rnb, & reggaeton parties if you know where to look. SWAG in Playa d’en Bossa is Ibiza’s primary urban themed club. There are also one off parties at Privilege, Ibiza Rocks, and other clubs that will feature non-EDM music – you’ll want to check the upcoming events to confirm.\n\nWhat are the best after hours spots in Ibiza?\n\nMany Ibiza clubs are open til sunrise and don’t start getting busy until 1 or 2 AM!\n\nWhat are the best gay clubs/bars in Ibiza?\n\nThe best gay clubs/bars in Ibiza include: Lola’s, La Troya, and SupermartXe (a party at Privilege).\n\nWhat time do clubs close in Ibiza?\n\nThere isn’t an official closing time for most clubs. Many will stay open through sunrise.\n\nCan you drink in public in Ibiza?\n\nTechnically you aren’t allowed to drink alcohol in public. However if you do it in moderation you probably won’t be stopped.\n\nCan you drink on the beach in Ibiza?\n\nTechnically you’re not allowed to drink alcohol on the beach, but it seems like it’s rarely enforced unless you’re making a mess or commotion.\n\nIs weed/marijuana legal in Ibiza?\n\nBecause of an interesting loophole in the Spanish constitution, the consumption and cultivation of cannabis are legal in private spaces. What that means is that you are allowed to smoke weed and grow it in your own house. If the plants are on your balcony, however, that is illegal. This loophole has led to the creation of cannabis clubs where members can buy weed legally. However, those clubs are only for members and usually on an invitation-only basis, so most tourists can’t use them to get good weed easy.\n\nSmoking weed in public is illegal and you might get fined if the cops catch you. You might get away with a warning too, but it really depends on the policeman that finds you. It is best to be careful not to be too blatant with marijuana in Ibiza.\n\nAre recreational drugs legal in Ibiza?\n\nDrugs are not legal in Ibiza. There are a lot of people selling drugs around the island, but it is definitely not legal. We do not condone drug use of any sort.\n\nWhat should I wear in Ibiza? What is the dress code?\n\nWithin reason, the clubs will not refuse people with tickets. The hip and the less hip are allowed to mingle without fear of contamination and whilst attracting attention with your outfit may not be easy, do feel free to try. We are big fans of those who try to embrace the free-spirited nature of dressing on Ibiza from decades past, where an “anything goes” policy was the only rule.\n\nHaving said that, the VIP lounges normally don’t allow entry with shorts, flip-flops, beach or sportswear, so if you are planning to go VIP, we highly recommend that you dress up! The same is true for the more sophisticated nightclubs like Lío. Ushuaïa and Hï Ibiza also do not allow entry with flip-flops, swimwear and football or basketball T-shirts."
