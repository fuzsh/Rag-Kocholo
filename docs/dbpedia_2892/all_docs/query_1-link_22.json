The island has several authentic beach bars called chiringuitos. Some of these serve lovely drinks and great food, and some are famous for their excellent fish dishes. The most famous IBIZA BARS are found in San Antonio’s West End, also known as Bar Street.\n\nIn order to visit them all to discover whether they meet your expectations or to find one specific bar to your own personal preference would mean that you should spend just about your entire vacation in a bar, just because there are as many types of bars on the island as there are preferences.

Often there is no entrance fee, and if you have a flyer, you can get at least one or two drinks for free.\n\nAnd almost every night, the Ibiza Bars are rented by external promoters to the clubs for their notorious and famous pre-parties. These promoters are then responsible for the event and its music, bands and DJs, and the venue’s decor. This way, the music played in the bars and clubs is different from evening to evening. Also, it helps you get some discounts on drinks or provide access to a party later.\n\nKeep this in mind when choosing your outfit, because, in Ibiza, they prefer people to wear beautiful or extravagant costumes?

A normal night on this wonderful island would be heading to one of the many nightclubs that make it famous and dancing until dawn.\n\nBut, there are other alternative Ibiza nightlife plans… Do you want to know them?\n\nEnjoy the magical sunsets or sunset strip\n\nThe show begins at sunset in the bay of Sant Antoni de Portmany in the well-known “sunset” cafes, from where you can enjoy impressive sunsets, when the sun mixes with the sea on the horizon.\n\nThe best known of them all is the Café del Mar. The sunset ritual is accompanied by enthusiastic people, fire shows and chill out.\n\nCafé del Mar opened its doors in 1980 and at the end of the 1980s, a compilation of his music was released and from 1994 the first CD “Café del Mar” was released.\n\nOther alternatives to the avenue of cafes are: Hostal La Torre (Cap Negret), Kumharas (Port des Torrent), Villa Mercedes (Puerto Sant Antony) or Kanya (Calo des Moro).\n\nSit on a terrace of the port.\n\nIbiza nightlife is not only about clubbing but also about enjoying the busy street at bars at the beautiful ports.\n\nIn the early hours of the night, the greatest animation is concentrated in the port of Ibiza, a beautiful setting, presided over by the majesty of Dalt Vila.\n\nThe simple coming and going of people, moving at their leisure between the terraces of the bars, fashion shops or stalls of the craft market, form a true spectacle in itself.\n\nAmong this crowd, the entertainers of the macro clubs of Ibiza, compete to attract the eyes of the people towards the next episode in the endless night of Ibiza.\n\nTransvestites, sharing the street with the ticket sellers, who stand on very long stilts and sell tickets to the immense crowd of young people eager to party.\n\nGo shopping in the port.\n\nYou cannot miss the atmosphere of the narrow streets of the center of Ibiza populated with establishments.\n\nDuring the high season, June to September, the shops are open until midnight.\n\nHere you will find the most extravagant and latest fashion for club nights – from designer clothes to bargains.\n\nNumerous vendors bring life to the small alleys with jewelry stalls, Ibiza music CDs, along with many other objects.\n\nCalle de la Virgen, a meeting point for the colorful gay scene, has shops with sadomasochistic objects and piercing parlors.

The bustling streets of Sa Marina and the bars and restaurants of the Dalt Vila are the benchmarks of the Ibiza atmosphere. The heterogeneous population of the island today provides gastronomic variety from the different regions of Spain.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to savor different dishes from all over the country in a small space.\n\nIn them, or in any restaurant, don’t hesitate to order the sofrit de pagés, with lamb and pork sausages, or the bullit de ratjada, a stew made with skate. Don’t miss the pastries either, with the flaós and the orelletes.\n\nEnjoy a quiet drink.\n\nYou will be delighted to know that Ibiza is not just a disco and party halls. There is also a place to spend a quiet evening in a relaxed bar, many with more relaxed live music, that is, completely different from clubbing.\n\nIn these places you will find how to spend the night, have a coffee with views of the coast, play bingo, the casino, or enjoy music from other decades.\n\nIn the Keeper area, in La Marina Botafoch in Ibiza, in addition to having a drink at reasonable prices, you can check out the luxurious fleet of yachts that dock during the summer.\n\nHave fun at a hippie party.\n\nHippie parties are common in Ibiza and are part of the Ibiza nightlife, not only the typical and well-known ‘Flower Power’ party at the Pachá nightclub, but also in different towns that, to celebrate their parties, hold events of this type where most people dress for the occasion and moves the skeleton to the sound of the music of the sixties.\n\nAnd also, the impromptu parties in the mountains, which are the most fun but can be difficult to get to and you will need a good source to inform you.\n\nOn full moon nights go north, to Benirrás, and let yourself go…\n\nAttend the Jazz Festival.\n\nThe summer of Ibiza is not only about dance music. The Elvissa Jazz Festival, organized by the Ibiza Town Hall, and held in September, is the veteran festival in these events.\n\nBut for five years, an alternative plan has been at the Ibiza Rocks hotel with a cycle of concerts by ‘indie’ groups every Tuesday from June to September.\n\nHippie markets are held every week in many places on the island, and shopping is fantastic because Ibiza is always at the top of the wave when it comes to fashion in clothing or decoration. With a history of more than 20 years, Las Dalias is the most famous and important market on the island, as it represents the spirit of Ibiza’s hippie culture.\n\nIn it you can find endless items, such as clothes, CDs, antiques, incense, soaps, handmade shoes, or, if you prefer, you can leave shopping aside and enjoy a tea in a tent, a natural juice in the garden or some tapas in the interior bars. The best thing is that there is a Night Market on Mondays from 7:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. Its location is Carretera San Carlos Km.12.\n\nEnjoy Authentic Cuisines\n\nIBIZA RESTAURANTS enclose an enormous variety of great restaurants that serve healthy Mediterranean cuisine prepared with home-grown vegetables and fresh caught fish and shellfish.

And of course a wide array of IBIZA RESTAURANTS dedicated to more worldly cuisines are available throughout the island, so wonderful grilled sausages can be enjoyed as well as spicy Thai- and Indian dishes, Mexican food or cuisine from the Middle East.\n\nIn sta. Gertrudis a very special MIDDLE EAST RESTAURANT was opened, SAFRĄ IBIZA that only serves Middle East dishes, tapas and pitas. Off road.\n\nOff at Night\n\nBora-Bora is one of the best known beach bars in Ibiza. It is on the crowded beach of D’en Bossa, open to the public many hours a day, it is a beach option to the mythical Space.\n\nKM.5 is a bar that you should not miss. Located at km 5.6 on the Eivissa-Sant Josep highway, it is one of those lounges that are worth visiting. Beautiful international people, perfect music at volume that can be talked about and intimate.\n\nNo one will tell you about it but Atzaró is a rural hotel-Spa in the middle of the countryside, on Ctra, Sant Joan KM. 15.\n\nA dinner and a few drinks prolonging the evening will let you see the stars, while you move to the rhythm of lounge music.\n\nConclusion\n\nIBIZA is one of the most visited islands in the group of the Balearic Islands in Spain, and famous due to its amazing Ibiza nightlife.\n\nTherefore it attracts the highest amount of young people as well. Although it also offers a wide range of options for those not interested in the club scene. There are many other activities suitable for visitors of all ages and preferences.\n\nFrom June till the end of October, in tourist season, IBIZA NIGHTLIFE, as well as all other attractions on the island, is at its best, but there are lots of bars where you can have a drink and talk, without loud MUSIC.\n\nBut when you visit the island between October and May and you’ll find a very different, much more peaceful island – only one club and a few funky bars remain open through the winter months. The nightlife districts, aside from the CLUBS, are mainly in PUERTO DE IBIZA = PORT OF IBIZA, known as ‘LA MARINA’ where you find many terraces and restaurants and which is full of the liveliest BARS as is the San Antonio’s WEST END.\n\nCheck out our boat about things to do in San Antonio"
