        "text": "Can you define Rafael Da Cruz? Quite simply, the answer is no. Here one person not only creates perfectly-poised progressive tracks, but he’s a strong writing pen behind one of Germany’s leading electronic music magazines, a long-time resident for Gewölbe club in Cologne and a co-founder for his newest side venture - a travel experience company. A blend of Portuguese-born but German-raised, Da Cruz’s select but impressive production catalogue has always seemed to catch the ear differently over the past ten years; rightly so given the contrast in his cultural DNA to upbringing and its effect on his life view - of course all adding to the charm of an individual who seems to juggle everything and anything all so effortlessly before our eyes.\n\nLiving life back home in lockdown, discussing the backstories behind his upcoming EP on Isolate and finding focus on the exact sets which helped define his sound, Melodic Diggers settled down for a long and unwinding coffee to tap into the brain and thoughts of this multi-trick artist.\n\nGood morning Rafael and welcome to our coffee break! What are you sipping on currently?\n\nGood morning and thanks for having me! I'm sipping on some freshly squeezed juice, which has become a morning ritual. Routines - they’ve become more important than ever in these crazy times, I guess.\n\nThere’s certainly a lot more to your life story which people might not be aware of - apart from the few times you’ve spoken about it on social media. Born in Portugal, yet brought up in Cologne: do you feel this upbringing influenced how you became connected with music and ultimately how you began to DJ and produce?\n\nI'm sure it did, yes. Although I grew up far away from Portugal, my childhood had a strong Portuguese influence with a very firm connection to that culture. Still, I probably would never have been exposed to electronic music and the scene in the way I was if I hadn't grown up in Germany.\n\nWe lived in a rural area about 80 kilometers from Cologne. Instead of spending my time with other teenagers from the village, I spent hours on the internet soaking up everything which had to do with music. After a few years of listening to pop, I found my way to electronic music. At the same time, I started developing a certain inner vision about a possible life model far removed from the traditional nine-to-five job. My older sister took me to a club for the first time, when I was 17. That night changed my life and I decided to become a DJ. I think the characteristically melancholy nature of Portuguese music and life in general, coupled with all the subsequent influences, has had an huge influence on my music today.\n\nHaving left Cologne for Berlin four years ago, what was the biggest driving factor for doing so? How has it helped develop you, both personally and as an artist?\n\nStepping out of my comfort zone. Four days before I moved, I still said I would never move to Berlin, as the city seemed far too big and somehow too restless in an intimidating way to me. Yet something inside me felt like this adventure could be a good one, at least for a while. In Cologne I noticed a lack of progress, not only for myself but also in the subculture in general. With the increasing encouragement from friends already in Berlin, I took the plunge. It was completely spontaneous and instinctive. I haven't regretted anything yet. The versatility of the city allows you to unleash yourself and gives you the freedom to experiment. It is very inspiring to meet like-minded people from all over the world concentrated in one place, who share the same passion.\n\nYou spent a large chunk of time back in Portugal during the pandemic, where it looks like you’ve been creating some new music? Surrounded by, (as you say) ‘nature and sea’. How has this reflected upon your productions/sounds and can we expect something different from you?\n\nLate last summer, when the situation around the pandemic didn't promise any improvement, my girlfriend and I decided to spend the winter by the sea, near my family. The sea, nature, and the massive contrast to Berlin that comes with it have a very broad influence on me and thus certainly on my music\n\nYou have also just started your own travel experience with two friends, called ONA SONORA. It’s described as “immersive and holistic travels” which “let us discover new cultures”. Do you feel that having spent time back in a different culture during the past pandemic year had inspired you starting up this business?\n\nWho initially thought of the concept and what is the meaning behind the name?\n\nThe name means 'sound wave' in Catalan, and it's a concept that plays a central role in our philosophy and idea.\n\nThe idea itself was borne before the pandemic and it came from my girlfriend, Sabine, but it has certainly become even more relevant because of the current situation around the globe. One of my biggest passions besides music is travel. For me, traveling means not only to be somewhere, but to dive as deep as possible into the local scenery and culture. The most unique and honest way to do so, in my opinion, is to meet the people and protagonists of each spot, far away from the touristic hotspots that reign in conventional travel guides. Luckily my girlfriend shares the same vision and at the end of an unforgettable trip to the Moroccan desert with our friend Adam, we thought about joining forces and putting together a program that incorporates our passion and all the lovely people we’ve met on our personal journey so far. That’s when ONA SONORA was borne.\n\nOur goal is to create immersive and holistic travels that lead to an inner and outer journey and let us discover new cultures as well as new worlds within ourselves. These experiences are always framed by sound, nature, and rituals. We travel to destinations such as Ibiza, Portugal, Morocco, Germany, and others. The kick-off was initially planned for last October, but we had to cancel, unfortunately. But better times are coming, that's for sure. And I'm convinced that a more holistic approach to life in general will be more and more important in our day-to-day lives.\n\nOn the site, you also talk about holistic practices and the impact which soundwaves have on the mind, body and soul. Admittedly, your music is gentle and euphoric, and really seems to blend in with the cores of ONA SONORA. Do you feel like this lifestyle and your music has always been ingrained in your soul and personal being?\n\nFor me, there has always been something strongly immersive and holistic about music in general and being an artist. That may be one reason why my music is often characterised by spherical and eclectic elements at the same time. Just as I find silence important to quiet the mind sometimes, certain sounds can guide you in certain directions and trigger a wide range of emotions. Through meditation, yoga, and my personal connection to Ibiza, a place known for its holistic culture, this step now feels good and right.\n\nTalking about music, you’ve got an EP coming out on Isolate this summer. (Your track ‘Conrad’ already released on the label’s first ‘Mutations’ V/A). How did you establish the relationship with the team?\n\nI met Murat and Alican in Istanbul when I was playing for a fashion brand in their city. We also had a good night at their club, MODULE, with my friends Simon and Tobi from Andhim playing, and then we saw each other all over Europe in the weeks which followed. The label was just being launched at that time and for me – considering all of their existing catalog – it is one of the most visionary and contemporary labels within the scene. I'm happy to be releasing a four-track EP with them this summer, and we're currently working on the vinyl.\n\nYou’ve also just released your first tracks, ‘Bes’ (Premiered with us here at Melodic Diggers) and ’Saqqara’, with Ruede Hagelstein’s DUAT Folklore label. With your music emotive and a sense of telling a story, we’d love to hear the story of the tracks through your own words.\n\nDUATRECORDS is all about Egyptian mythology, from the design to the track titles. When Ruede asked me last year if I would like to do something on the label, it was the first time I looked into this subject so intensively. In the process, I came across 'Bes', a powerful god in Dynasty XII of ancient Egypt, who became the protector of all that is good and the enemy of all that is evil. He is considered the god of dance, music, sexuality, fun, and humour. Even the name of the Balearic island Ibiza means 'Island of Bes'. Saqqara is a huge ancient burial site in Egypt where Bes lived and maintained his sacred environment, protecting women and children in particular. That story impressed me, and I tried to express this inspiration and vision through sound.\n\nAside from making music, you are a resident DJ at Gewölbe in Cologne, where you play with acts like Innellea, Adriatique, Baikal, Nightmares on Wax, Trikk, Konstantin Sibold - the list goes on. How has this residency molded you as an artist?\n\nBeing a resident at Gewölbe was one of the biggest ambitions I had when I started DJing and it's still an honour. For me, the club ticks all the boxes: it's ideal size and the 'perfect' sound system make it a great environment to experience music and the artist in the best possible way. At Gewölbe, the sound quality is central to the experience and it affects all aspects – especially the ambience during the night and the audience, whose music knowledge is deep and wide-ranging.\n\nSince 2012 I've been hosting my own night there called 'Right to Love'. I think you grow immensely as an artist in surroundings that offer you freedom and trust – parameters which can often lead to unforgettable nights.\n\nWhat has been your favourite moment from playing at the club?\n\nEvery time the whole room gets lost in a track, and when you see a smile here and there through the shimmering lights.\n\nRafael, there’s a certain sense of you heralding many talents. You’ve been a music journalist for the past 15 years, and are currently an editor for FAZE Magazine in Germany. Did working as a music journalist alight a burning fire inside of you to do more than just write about music? Do you feel working with artists and establishing connections has helped you progress further in your music career?\n\nBoth writing and music started at about the same time in my life. It's an incredible privilege to be able to live out my passion for music in so many different ways and I think one benefits from the other and vice versa. Working for FAZE gives me a very good overview of what's going on in the world of electronic music and has, of course, opened many doors for me as an artist. Talking to people I've looked up to for years always serves as a source of inspiration for me.\n\nWith FAZE Magazine focusing on both electronic music and lifestyle, how has it influenced both the music you produce and how you are able to connect with what people outside of just their music tastes?\n\nMonth after month it gives me the opportunity to get to know artists and their inner world better – with all their passion and inspiration, but also their worries and obstacles. To know that even your idols sometimes struggle is tremendously valuable. These many perspectives help me a lot in my life as an artist. My closest and most intense friendships have been borne because of the same passion, which I'm very grateful for.\n\nLet’s dig deeper into your musical history. Your debut EP ‘Renaissance’ was released in 2014 - a time where progressive melodic music was soaring high into its own with artists such as Pachanga Boys, Andre Crom, Catz ‘n Dogz and when we had Solomun releasing remixes such as ‘Around’ by Haze and Noir and ‘Let's Go Back’ by Kraak & Smaak featuring Romanthony.\n\nYour earlier music is also quite progressive and there’s still an element which lingers on to this - do you feel like you have ever evolved from this sound completely and are there any elements or production techniques from that time you like to keep in your music making today?\n\nWhen I first started producing music, I spent ages racking my brain over what I wanted to sound like. Then I realised at some point that the most sustainable solution is the opposite, and your sound tends to find you. Everything comes out in a natural process. The environment in which you move as an artist plays a role, obviously, but just like life, the sound also evolves. My sound has always embraced atmospheric techno and house as well as deep, wide soundscapes. It's my DNA.\n\nWhat do you feel has been the biggest change within the melodic music scene from back in 2014 to now, 2021?\n\nI have the impression that melodies are more and more able to break down boundaries between different genres and create that one memorable moment during a club night, which you take home with you and keep forever.\n\nSound wise, you have this really interesting blend of classical (lots of orchestral elements, particularly piano), some breakbeat and even a touch of trance and house elements. At such a large-scale combination of different dance music elements, can you pinpoint where you picked these up and are there any particular artists which have inspired you with these sounds?\n\nGood question. As a journalist in my profession, you have to be open to all styles of electronic music. This creates a broad resentment towards different musical worlds, at least for me. But to give a more specific example, I remember very well the recording of a live set by Kollektiv Turmstrasse from 2009 and one from Marcus Worgull a few years later, which both sounded like a musical revelation to me and had a great impact on me.\n\nWe are still such big fans of your Isolate track, ‘Conrad’. It has a real warm and dramatic sunset kind-of vibe to it. so, where would you envision the perfect setting for playing the track?\n\nThank you very much. I do indeed love sunsets and I'm already being dubbed as cheesy by friends for my countless Instagram-Stories, haha. But to be honest, rather than the setting, the right people and a good sound system are more important factors for me. The rest happens.\n\nDo you want another coffee?\n\ninterview by joanne philpott\n\nfollow Rafael Da Cruz:"
