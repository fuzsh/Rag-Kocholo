        "text": "Pacha Ibiza – The Beginning\n\nPacha began life in 1973. Created by brothers Ricardo and Piti Urgell, after their successful smaller nightclub located in Sitges, near Barcelona. The name “Pacha” came from a passing comment made by one of Ricardo’s friends. He told him one day he would live like a Pacha (an Arabian Prince). He wasn’t wrong. Pacha was originally a converted farmhouse and still occupies the same venue spot today, although obviously much larger in size.\n\nAnd so, the first island superclub was born. The nightclub became the go-to party for visiting artists, musicians, painters, and other bohemian types. From there, famous parties such as ‘Flower Power’ began to emerge, with Piti Urgell behind the decks, a renowned party that still continues to this day.\n\nPacha Ibiza – The Superclub\n\nAs Ibiza became more popular, so did Pacha. Later turning into a 3000 capacity super club, Pacha Ibiza hosts some of the world’s best DJs. Over the years, Pacha has been home to the likes of David Guetta, Calvin Harris, Pete Tong, Swedish House Mafia, Eric Morillo, Bob Sinclair, and artists such as Madonna and Kylie Minogue have joined them.\n\nIn recent years, Pacha has undergone a major refurbishment. Inside the club, you will find the main room, global room, funky room, and an amazing rooftop terrace, with all areas boasting state of the art lighting and sound systems.\n\nVIP Tables and areas are now a major part of the Pacha experience. Partygoers can enjoy their own private tables with personal waiters and bottle service.\n\nThe club has been featured in several movies including the 2004 hit “It’s all gone Pete Tong” and they even has their own hotel “El Hotel” situated directly opposite.\n\nAs Pacha says “Come dance with us and be part of this mystical love story.”\n\nFor further details on Pacha VIP Tables and assistance with Itinerary planning please get in touch"
