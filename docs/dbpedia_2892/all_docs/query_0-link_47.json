        "text": "Hard Times is the new Saturday night haunt in super club Privilege. Hard Times is one of the UK’s pioneering clubbing brands heralding originally from Leeds in the mid 90s and over the past two decades has gone on to build a global following. Synonymous with breaking the infamous US house artists mainstays, Roger Sanchez, Todd Terry and David Morales to UK audiences, the legacy of this night is difficult to rival.\n\nTaking Ibiza for the season for the first time we are excited to see what this new night has to offer the island. We love the Vista Club in Privilege, mainly due to the sweeping views of Ibiza and San Rafael and post 6am when the sun comes up, it’s one of our favourite places to be. It seems like the perfect venue for Hard Times to spread the house vibes in the intimate Vista Club at Privilege.\n\nWith acts such as Todd Terry, Junior Sanchez, Mark Fanciulli, NiCe7, Mat Playford and Jason Bye already announced for the opening party on the 20th of June. These will be joined across the 12 week run of events by the likes of Paul Woolford, DJ Sneak, Bontan, S-Man (Roger Sanchez) Felix Da Housecat, Todd Terry, Claptone, Danny Krivit, Kevin Sanderson, Doorly and Ramon Tapia. Hard Times residency continues all season long with the closing falling on 12th September as the legendary Derrick Carter is joined by Hector Romero and Brett Johnson.\n\nCheck out the line up for the season at Hard Times in Privilege Ibiza below. You can get your house fix each and every Saturday from 20th June.
