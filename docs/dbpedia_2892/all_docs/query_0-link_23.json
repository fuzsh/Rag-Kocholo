Lots more announcements coming soon ?\n\nNowhere in the world compares to Ibiza when it comes to clubbing.\n\nFor us, clubbing is what makes Ibiza, Ibiza. And that’s why we made this site: to help navigate you to the best nightlife that Ibiza has to offer.\n\nCheck out information about Ibiza’s clubs below. Each summer some come, some go.

Some clubs double up as restaurants and only open during the day. Some, such as Ushuaïa and Ibiza Rocks, are clubs that form part of a hotel where clubbers can book a room with a view of the action.\n\nOur guide below focuses on Ibiza’s nightclubs, and there are two main divisions.\n\nSuperclubs have a capacity between 3,000 – 10,000 people. These huge spaces host the very biggest names in the world and are generally open every day throughout the summer season. Other clubs may be smaller in size, but by no means inferior in any way.\n\nWhat clubs are there in Ibiza? Let’s take a look 👀\n\nIbiza Superclubs\n\nUshuaïa\n\nPlaya d'en Bossa's open air superclub and hotel\n\nHï Ibiza\n\nThe World's #1 Rated Club\n\nEden\n\nThe jewel in San Antonio's clubbing crown\n\nPacha\n\nHome of the original and iconic global clubbing brand\n\nAmnesia\n\nWhere clubbing in Ibiza all began\n\nPrivilege\n\nThe largest club in the world [Currently Closed]\n\nOther Clubs\n\nDC10\n\nThe spirit of the underground\n\nIbiza Rocks\n\nPool parties like none other in San Antonio\n\nO Beach\n\nDaytime clubbing in San Antonio\n\nCova Santa\n\nA hidden gem in the hills\n\nPikes\n\nLegendary hotel, restaurant & late night clubbing\n\nLío\n\nIbiza’s glamorous cabaret and clubbing hotspot\n\nClub Chinois\n\nIbiza's newest exclusive club\n\nPlaya Soleil\n\nDine & Dance in Playa d'en Bossa\n\nClubs by Location\n\n🌅 San Antonio Eden, O Beach, Ibiza Rocks 🏖 Playa d'en Bossa Hï, Ushuaïa, Playa Soleil 🛥 Ibiza Town Club Chinois, Pacha, Lio 🔮 San Rafael Amnesia, Privilege\n\nWhere to Party in Ibiza?\n\nWe frequently get asked “Which part of Ibiza is best for clubs?”\n\nWhilst Ibiza’s clubs are dotted across the island, there are two areas best for clubbing in Ibiza:\n\nPlaya d’en Bossa, on the east of the island, is home to Hï Ibiza, Ushuaïa, and Playa Soleil. A short 10 minute taxi ride away is Pacha, which is just north of Ibiza’s Old Town.\n\nSan Antonio, on the west coast of the island. Here you will find Eden, Ibiza Rocks, O Beach, whilst Pike’s and The Zoo Project’s Benimussa Park are under 10 minutes away.\n\nFinally, located in the middle of the island you have Amnesia and Privilege in San Rafael. These are roughly the same distance from both Playa d’en Bossa and San Antonio.\n\nIBIZA CLUB CALENDAR 2024\n\nDiscover the best parties and find tickets for your trip to Ibiza\n\nEXPLORE\n\nIbiza Club Entry Prices\n\nThe cost of entry to clubs in Ibiza varies based on a few factors:\n\nPromoter: for a given night in a club, the price can change a lot. Big DJs on the line up can make tickets more expensive\n\nLocation: where you buy the ticket from, for example online, in a kiosk, or on the door of the club\n\nTime: many promoters sell early bird tickets with significant discounts. Some tickets might be limited to entrance before a certain time\n\nIt’s also common for ticket prices to be higher for an Opening or Closing party too, where the line ups are generally more extensive.\n\nWe always recommend buying your club tickets online in advance. It’s guaranteed to be the cheapest way to get into the club, and you benefit by saving €20 on average vs paying to enter on the door. You can also cancel your tickets free of charge up to 24 hours before the party if you change your mind.\n\nOne of the island’s most popular parties, David Guetta’s F*** Me I’m Famous, advance online tickets are €90 vs €120 on the door. That’s a huge €30 saving!\n\nHere’s what you can expect to pay for entry and drinks at some of the bigger clubs on the island.\n\nAll the prices are based on a standard online advance ticket. Drinks prices are based on the most recent information we have for each club.\n\nAmnesia\n\nTICKET PRICES\n\nAverage = €40\n\nParadise | €50\n\nelrow | €55\n\nPyramid | €30\n\nDRINK PRICES\n\n💧 Water | €9\n\n🍺 Beer | €13\n\n🍹 Long Drink | €21\n\nHï\n\nTICKET PRICES\n\nAverage = €60\n\nF*** ME I'M FAMOUS | €90\n\nGlitterbox | €65\n\nFISHER | €55\n\nDRINK PRICES\n\n💧 Water | €12\n\n🍺 Beer | €16\n\n🍹 Long Drink | €23\n\nUshuaïa\n\nTICKET PRICES\n\nAverage = €75\n\nDavid Guetta | €100\n\nANTS | €60\n\nelrow | €70\n\nDRINK PRICES\n\n💧 Water | €13\n\n🍺 Beer | €16\n\n🍹 Long Drink | €23\n\nDC10\n\nTICKET PRICES\n\nAverage = €60\n\nCircoloco | €60\n\nSolid Grooves | €65\n\nDRINK PRICES\n\n💧 Water | €5\n\n🍺 Beer | €10\n\n🍹 Long Drink | €17\n\nPacha\n\nTICKET PRICES\n\nAverage = €65\n\nSolomun+1 | €70\n\nMusic On | €70\n\nSAGA | €55\n\nThe Masquerade | €55\n\nDRINK PRICES\n\n💧 Water | €12\n\n🍺 Beer | €14\n\n🍹 Long Drink | €21\n\nEden\n\nTICKET PRICES\n\nAverage = €45\n\nWorried About Henry | €50\n\nSHINE | €40\n\nDRINK PRICES\n\n💧 Water | €5\n\n🍺 Beer | €8\n\n🍹 Long Drink | €13\n\nIbiza Rocks\n\nTICKET PRICES\n\nAverage = €35\n\nCraig David's TS5 | €50\n\nBen Hemsley | €30\n\nDRINK PRICES\n\n💧 Water | €6\n\n🍺 Beer | €9\n\n🍹 Long Drink | €14\n\nO Beach\n\nTICKET PRICES\n\nAverage = €25\n\nHouse in Paradise | €25\n\nKisstory | €30\n\nSin Sundays | €25\n\nONE | €25\n\nDRINK PRICES\n\n💧 Water | €5\n\n🍺 Beer | €8\n\n🍹 Long Drink | €15\n\nIbiza Club Dress Code\n\nMany clubs around the world adhere to strict dress codes when it comes to entry.\n\nThis is not the case in in Ibiza!\n\nThe general rule of thumb is to simply wear whatever you feel comfortable in, so dress however you like! The clubs are well air-conditioned. You will see everything from jeans and trousers to shorts and t shirts.\n\nOne thing to note is that you can’t wear football shirts, and you will need to actually be clothed when entering the club (i.e you can’t just rock up to O Beach without a shirt and jump straight into the pool).\n\nThe only exception to the rule is newcomer Club Chinois. The club has a “classy casual” dress code, which means men need to wear trousers, i.e not shorts!\n\nMeanwhile if you have booked a VIP table, it’s likely the club will be stricter on what you wear. Pacha and Hï are more likely to ask you to dress smarter for their VIP areas.\n\nWe recommend not wearing sandals / flipflops at night… at busy clubs you’ll get trodden on. Girls, leave your heels at home. Flats are your friend.\n\nParties are marathons not sprints, so you might want to go for a good pair of trainers.\n\nWhen do Ibiza Clubs Open & Close?\n\nIn general, Ibiza clubs do not open all year round. For the most part, Ibiza clubs open in the middle of May, and close at the beginning of October. This is the summer season, which peaks in August.\n\nIf you do plan to go clubbing in Ibiza between October – April, you will need to do your research. Pacha, Akasha and Eden are good place to start.
