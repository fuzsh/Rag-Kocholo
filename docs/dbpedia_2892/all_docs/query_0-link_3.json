        "text": "Trouble is, even Privi will admit that size capacity is a hindrance more than a blessing. So it's kind of an empty brag.\n\nNo point building something as big or bigger if you're gonna struggle to fill it.\n\nMy limited knowledge of Vegas is that land is expensive and the competition cutthroat. Building a massive club when you could be building other cash cows is likely an unlucrative prospect.\n\nPrivilege has been stating this since the early 90's, but what with the rise of dance music, especially EDM in the US, and how much the yanks like to build big, I would of thought a club would of opened in Vegas that steals Privileges crown.\n\nIs it still officially the biggest club the world?\n\nThere definitely isnâ€™t the demand for big clubs in VEGAS. As mentioned there are a lot of medium sized clubs but no demand for a single massive club\n\nTell that to the 8000 that went to Pure Carl Cox last year\n\nI went to the second Pure Cox date and the whole club was heaving. It was uncomfortably packed until around 4 or 430 or so. But it was still great seeing like half the island coming out for this. It felt like the entire clubbing community was out in full force and it was worth it for a Kerri Chandler sunrise set in the Vista Room. Almost teared up with the old school tracks he played and I was only basically on alcohol for this one\n\nBut yeah I don't think even Cox himself could fill it week in and week out, unless maybe the guests were crazy every week.\n\nI went to the second Pure Cox date and the whole club was heaving.

We managed to find this little corner near the stairs of the main room which was being sort of guarded by 2 scary looking German blokes so their intimidating stance made a bit of space for us . I kinda wish i'd spent more time in the Vista club last year, looking forward to a more relaxing night at Shine on 9th July\n\nWho wants a club packed to capacity though???\n\nI done resistance last year and whilst it must have been half full at the most it meant dancing was no problem. No queues for toilets and no wait at the bar\n\nHave to say the motorised ceiling is quite impressive - a feature that was quite a stand out for me\n\nI don't think there are any DJ's who could fill it for a season now. Several could for one-off or 2-3 appearances if they played nowhere else in Ibiza or even Europe that summer such as Tiesto, Swedish House Mafia, Carl Cox, David Guetta, Calvin Harris and the Radio1 weekends did fill it with a star-studded billing. But overall times have changed and their is a lot more competition for events in both daytime and nighttime."
