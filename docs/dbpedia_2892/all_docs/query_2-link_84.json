Back to rule Friday nights, every week as the curtain rises SuperMartXé will make history once more, not only with their new themes and top class line-up, but also for the best show of technology and most amazing staging (360o) of the Ibiza party up until now.\n\nUnder the slogan We Own The Show, SuperMartXé officially welcomes a new stage of #Evolution in their shows and of musical #Revolution in their DJ booth, completely revamping their sound experience and returning to their house roots, and providing tunes from the most elegant and quintessential classics of the genre to the hottest, coolest house headliners of our time.\n\nThese big names of house are among the first artists to be confirmed on the SuperMartXé Line-Up in Ibiza.\n\n2manydjs DJ Set, Benny Benassi, Mark Knight, Fedde Le Grand, WEISS, Illyus & Barrientos, David Tort, Robbie Rivera, David Penn, Superlover, Kryder, David Morales, The Cube Guys, Cedric Gervais, Though Love and ATFC, are some of the guests that have already been confirmed for the 11th season of SuperMartXé at Privilege Ibiza.\n\nIt’s an honour for SuperMartXé to be able to host a DJ set by the Belgian duo 2manydjs (or as they’re also known, David and Stephen Dewaele). The brothers need no introduction, they are part of history and are stars of the dance music scene of today, not only thanks to their shows and DJ sets, but also for projects like Soulwax, their rock band, and the excellent programming of their online radio station Radio Soulwax. Since the 2002 release of their debut album “As heard on Radio Soulwax Volume 2”, acclaimed by fans and critics as a benchmark masterpiece of the art and technique of the mash-up, the duo haven’t stopped killing it on dance floors and at festivals the world over with their fun, eclectic sets that mix many different styles. They will be the act that gets SuperMartXé under way.\n\nAnother artist who needs no introduction is the legendary Italian DJ and producer Benny Benassi. Tracks such as “I Feel so Fine” and “Satisfaction” have been hits heard around the world for years and are part of the history of techno music. Benassi has also remixed contemporary artists such as DJ Tomcraft, Fischerspooner, Sonique and even Outkast.\n\nOne of the living legends of house, New Yorker David Morales will also join SuperMartXé in Ibiza for the summer.

Regulars with labels such as Defected, Suara, Toolroom, Exploited Records and Glasgow Underground among others, as well as on the stages of top festivals, they have come to be considered one of the best DJ and producer duos in the UK.\n\nThe DJ and producer from Barcelona, David Tort, will also be joining us for the Opening Party Tort’s 30 year career has been full of huge moments for lovers of house from around the world; not for nothing is he one of the genre’s best known Spanish artists worldwide. Moments like his first international hit in 1998 with ‘Drums of Love’, released in more than 15 countries, or his 2006 remix of DJ Disciple’s ‘Work it Out’, or his many sets in such iconic clubs as Stereo Montreal, Tomorroland, Zouk (Singapore) and Avalon (Los Angeles).\n\nIn August SuperMartXé will be visited on two occasions by one of the most illustrious producers on the global house scene, ATFC, whose stunning discography includes releases on labels such as Armada Subjekt, Toolroom, Defected, Ministry of Sound, Onephatdeeva, Slip’N’Slide, V2 Japan, Ninja Tune,… He recently joined forces with David Penn on a thumping new single called ‘Dynamite’.

With tracks like “Love Machine” from 2015 and releases such as the “Talking Machine EP” 2016, and “Heart Drive” in 2017, he has made it to number one on all the top charts. One of his appearances will be at the SuperMartxé Anniversary.\n\nFans of Cedric Gervais will also have a double opportunity to enjoy sets from this house music DJ and producer in Ibiza this summer.

But the difference now is that the experience will go beyond just what’s happening on the stage; it will leap onto the dancefloor to fully immerse partygoers in the whole awesome spectacle and fill the temple of music that is Privilege Ibiza with emotion.\n\nFor this, SuperMartXé will include not only the very best stylists, make-up artists, and prop artists, but also the best lineup of performers, acrobats, fire show specialists, singers, masters of different electronic instruments and many other artists. Together, they will tell a story and energise the crowd from both the stage and the dancefloor to complete the 360o experience of the viewer, who will not only listen and watch but also be able to actively live the experience with all their senses, becoming an active part of the theatricality of a live SuperMartXé show.\n\nAmong the many surprises that SuperMartXé has prepared for this season, the complete revamping of its themes is one of the most notable. More irreverent, sensual, and provocative than ever, with XXL theatrical and technological production values and revolutionary artistic direction, SuperMartXé can reveal the first four themes of the season: Cyber Geisha, Freak Show, Peep Show and Wild Cathedral.\n\nThis summer, SuperMartXé will take you to the future. A future ruled by an army of Cyber Geishas from the 22nd century, inhabiting a totally eclectic and futuristic cyber punkversion of Planet Earth. Privilege will be transfomed into a new world, combining a classic architectural style, technologically awesome backgrounds, and neon lights and luminous signs, with the sensuality and disconcerting grace of a universe of Cyber Geishas – among other beings – from another era. The crowd will happily submit to them.\n\nThe next journey takes us to the wildest, most sinful side of the SuperMartXé festival: Wild Cathedral, packed with irreverent nuns and pretty altar boys, shining altars and a congregation of sexy rockers, performers, acrobats and dancers, both on and off the stage. Ready to confess all your sins?\n\nThe big display windows and neon lights of a city inspired by Amsterdam’s Red Light District, Peep Show will be a journey through our desires, our carnal passions, our deepest fantasies. A journey guided by a massive stage production, urban and underground as well as ostentatious and luxurious, and which will exude luxury and sensuality above all else. Pure desire throughout Privilege’s main hall…\n\nAnd the final journey – which can just now be revealed – will immerse us under a giant red and white tent, with a host of characters with enormous muscles and incredible strength, beautiful and extravagant concubines, masters of ceremonies, acrobats, contortionists, tightrope walkers, fire jugglers, stilt walkers, knife throwers, snake charmers… all of this with the eroticism and sophistication of a grand burlesque show the likes of which have never been seen before on the island. The new Freak Show from SuperMartXé involves an ambitious stage setup, converting Privilege’s main room into a huge stage, and filling this new show with all the magic of the circus. The great theatre of dreams has never been so immense. Let the show begin!\n\nThere is still a lot more to be revealed and above all a lot to be enjoyed, so for the moment just remember that this summer in Ibiza, beginning on Friday, June the 28th, you have a date with the inimitable SuperMartXé show at Privilege Ibiza . We Own The Show.\n\nThe 28th of June SuperMartXé Opening Party\n\n► Online Sales::\n\n► Ibiza Residents – Free entry – (until full capacity is reached)\n\n► ☏ SuperMartXé VIP Contact (”VIP Experience”) vip@supermartxe.com Tel: +34 603 187 670\n\nFOLLOW US: www.supermartxe.com\n\nPrivilege´s Vista Club welcomes Manycome\n\nWednesdays at the biggest club in the world\n\nPrivilege Ibiza welcomes Manycome on Wednesdays at Vista Club running weekly from 3rd July until September 18th.
