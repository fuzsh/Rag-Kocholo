The Case for Reform: Balancing Legacy and Vision

Privilege Ibiza’s history is not without its share of challenges. In 2013, a young Dutchman working at Armin Van Burren’s State Of Trance party narrowly escaped a life-threatening incident when a portion of the roof collapsed. This incident eerily mirrored the roof collapse that bankrupted Privilege’s original owners when it was known as KU in the early 1990s.
