Privilege Ibiza is the “world’s largest nightclub according to the Guiness book of records, with a capacity of 10.000 people at Privilege. We are happy to announce the exclusive collaboration between Don’t Let Daddy Know by EA Events and Positiv Agency and Privilege on the island of Ibiza. For Don’t Let Daddy Know with its stunning shows it’s a real pleasure to work with a technical topnotch venue as Privilege. Expect the best sound, extraordinary light shows and fabulous shows in world largest nightclub.

On Sunday the 15th of July 2012 Don’t Let Daddy Know presents all the way from the USA, Wiz Khalifa live on stage. Wiz Khalifa will be supported by electronic dance DJ’s Bassjackers, Sem Vox and GirlsLoveDJs DJ Set and hosted by MC Gee. All Dutch and ready to rock DLDK! Also Dominico from Belgium will be there to blow your mind.

“Being out in front of people and just being ‘The Man’” might sound like a vague and ridiculous dream to have, but for Cameron Thomaz it might be the most appropriate thought to cross any mind. Better known as Wiz Khalifa. Rapping since the third grade and starting to record music at 14 was probably a step in the right direction.

Fast forward, Wiz signs to Atlantic Records, the new home to Wiz Khalifa. Following this huge milestone in his career, Wiz soon embarked on a stint on the famed “Rock The Bells” tour alongside such legends as Lauryn Hill and Snoop Dogg, immediately followed by his nation-wide headlining tour, appropriately dubbed the “Waken Baken Tour.” After receiving co-signs from a multitude of rap veterans, including Rick Ross and Diddy, and humbly rejecting Drake’s offer to join his recent tour, it became evident that Wiz also established himself as a prominent staple online with over 3,000,000 friends on Facebook, and over 1,000,000 fans following him on Twitter. With the video for his first Atlantic Records release, “Black & Yellow,” getting an astonishing 35 million views on YouTube, there is no question about it: Wiz Khalifa’s debut album with hits like “Young, Wild & Free” ft. Snoop Dogg and Bruno Mars, is bound to be something great.

Bassjackers aka Marlon Flohr and Ralph van Hilst had not foreseen what was coming when they started out with their collaboration. Marlon was already Dj-ing for a while and Ralph experimented a lot with making different kinds of dance music. Marlon was mainly playing house music at the time and then the idea came to push Ralphs productions in that direction so that Marlon could play the tracks in his sets.

This resulted in a massive career boost! Remixing for A-list artists like Rihanna and Moby, playing in Privilege Ibiza alongside Tiesto and touring around the globe to demolish dance floors is just the beginning… Bassjackers are taking over!

It’s rush hour for Sem Vox! jumpstarting 2012 with remixing the official Privilege compilation CD and gigs at the greatest events and big festivals like Mystery Land, there’s no doubt that this will be the year of Sem Vox.
