        "text": "You are able to sponsor siblings by adoption, step-parents, or paternal half-siblings to obtain permanent residence. However, there are some additional requirements that you must fulfill.\n\nSiblings by adoption will require you to provide a copy of the adoption decree. This must show that the adoption occurred before either of you were 16 years old.\n\nStep siblings require two documents. Firstly, they need documents proving that their birth parents’ prior marriage had been terminated. This includes a divorce decree. They also need a copy of the marriage certificate of the step-parent to the birth parent.\n\nFinally, paternal half-siblings require copies of marriage certificates from your father to each mother. In this case, you will also need documentation proving that any prior marriages between the fathers and mothers were legally terminated.\n\nYou will still be able to submit all your documentation as usual if you or your sibling has changed their name. However, you will have to provide evidence that the legal name change has occurred.\n\nIf you do this, your application will not be slowed down. However, there will be delays if you don’t, and the name discrepancy causes the application to be rejected.\n\nFor many people trying to come to the USA, it is astonishing and disheartening that they may have to wait decades for their application to be processed. This long waiting time can be mystifying, especially considering that over 226,000 Family-Based Green Cards are issued each year.\n\nHowever, of all these Green Cards, just 65,000 are issued to siblings of US citizens at the lowest preference category. A combination of this low number of Green Cards available and the incredibly high number of applicants means you are guaranteed a long waiting time."
