        "text": "It can feel hopeless if you’re trying to get into racing with no money. Even at the go kart level, the costs can be tremendous if you decide to do it yourself.\n\nInterestingly, someone on a kart forum actually did an analysis of the cost required to start go kart racing. They looked at the cost of a used go kart, entry fees, kart tires, race gas, kart parts, engine maintenance, hotel expenses, travel gas cost, etc. For just one season (or year) of regional kart racing, they figured out it’d cost around $8,000 – at least. OUCH!\n\nWant to get into F1? That’s going to be a wee bit more costly. According to Ralf Schumacher (ex-F1 winner and brother of Michael), as of 2022, it’ll cost between 13 and 15 million dollars for a young driver to get into the exclusive sport.\n\nBut there is good news.\n\nThe first step anyone should take before they try to become a race car driver is to try an Arrive & Drive race at K1 Speed.\n\nYou see, Arrive & Drive racing is our signature experience at K1 Speed. This allows people like you to step in and discover real racing without spending a ton of bucks. You also don’t need any reservation or driver’s license! We’ll supply you with the helmet, headsock, and go kart so all you have to do is show up and have fun.\n\nYou’ll then compete in a 12-lap race for the fastest lap time, not track position. So it doesn’t matter if someone is holding you up. Just give yourself a gap to other drivers and set that one blistering lap time.\n\nDuring Arrive & Drive, you’ll learn the basics of racing, such as:\n\nCar control\n\nRacing lines\n\nSteering smoothly\n\nSensitive pedal application\n\nCarrying momentum\n\nWe have two different types of electric go karts: junior karts for kids 48” or taller or adult karts for anyone 58” or taller (up to management discretion). Our junior karts reach speeds of around 20mph, while our adult karts are capable of hitting 45mph – the quickest in the industry.\n\nAnd here’s the best part – you won’t have to sell off all your possessions just to try real racing. Our required license is only $7.95 at most locations. And the cost for Arrive & Drive racing is not much more than $20 – about the cost of a pizza (listening, college student?). Plus, the more races you buy at once, the cheaper each race costs.\n\nAdditionally, Arrive & Drive serves as a great way to practice and hone your skills. When it comes to becoming a better racer, seat time is IMPORTANT. The more time you can log behind the wheel of a racing vehicle, the better. This explains why even professional racers like 7-time F1 World Champion Lewis Hamilton and 2-time IndyCar Champion Josef Newgarden have visited K1 Speed for a quick 12-lap session.\n\nRead More: Go Kart Racing Tips >>\n\nFor more information about our Arrive & Drive racing experience, click the button below.\n\nAre you wondering how to get your kid into kart racing? If your child has tried Arrive & Drive racing in the junior karts and looks promising, enter them in our Junior Challenge GP kart racing league! Our track welcomes new racers and will be very helpful in getting your child involved.\n\nOur Junior Challenge GP is a monthly racing series – from January to December – where children race head-to-head for position, not just fastest lap like our Arrive & Drive format. This means your child will learn more about racecraft rather than just knowing how to drive fast.\n\nRacecraft includes:\n\nLearning how to pass other racers\n\nLearning how to defend against other racers\n\nHandling the pressure\n\nBeing consistent\n\nOvercoming setbacks\n\nEach event includes a qualifying race to determine the starting grid, and a final race for position. At the end of the final race, points are awarded to each racer depending on their result. Kids accumulate points with each monthly event they compete in, until a champion is crowned at the final race in December.\n\nAnd here’s the best part about the series: you don’t have to compete in every race! There’s no obligation to race in every one of the 12 races. So, if you had other plans that month, or if your kid decides they’d rather watch racing on TV instead – it’s okay! You only pay for each event they race in. And what’s the cost? It’s just $44.95 per child, per event to compete in K1 Speed’s Junior Challenge GP. As you’ve already learned, that’s not a bad price to pay at all.\n\nAdditionally, if your kid finishes in the top 3 at the end of the season at their local center, they’ll qualify for the K1 Speed State Championship, part of our grand e-World Championship!\n\nMore information about our Junior Challenge GP can be found by clicking the button below.\n\nIf you’re a teen who wants to get into racing, then K1 Speed’s Teen Challenge GP racing league is perfect for you. The series is for anybody under the age of 18 who can fit in our adult karts. This means they meet the height requirement of 4’10” and can safety operate the vehicle.\n\nOur Teen Challenge GP runs the same as our Junior Challenge GP. It has 12 races that run monthly from January to December and participants race head-to-head for position. And the format is also the same: each event has a qualifying session and a final race for position. Teenagers also compete for points, and the highest points finisher at each location will score some awesome prizes.\n\nTeen Cup takes place on the same evening as our Junior League. But rest assured, this competition is a whole other beast. The karts can approach speeds of up to 45mph and these teens know how to get the most from them.\n\nThe price for Teen Challenge GP is also only $44.95 each round and there’s no obligation to compete in every round. Simply attend the ones you can. But of course, the more races the teenager participates in, the better chance they have at winning the championship.\n\nAnd like our Junior Challenge GP, those who finish in the top 3 standings in their local center at the end of the season are invited to the State Championship, part of our e-World Championship!\n\nMore information about our Teen Challenge GP can be found by clicking the button below.\n\nNow, our Adult Challenge GP is the best way for adults to get into motorsport. If you’re 18 years of age or older and are at least 4’10”, then this is definitely your most affordable option. This series lets adults enter the world of competitive racing – and you’re never too old to begin! We see a wide variety of ages during these events – from 18-year-olds to racers in their 50s and 60s.\n\nLike our other two racing leagues, our Adult Challenge GP series lasts the whole year, which means there’s a race every month from January to December. The cost to participate in our Adult Challenge GP is just $59.95 and includes two qualifying sessions and a final race for position.\n\nAdditionally, if you finish in the top 3 at the end of the year in your center, then you’ll qualify for the State Championship, part of K1 Speed’s illustrious e-World Championship!\n\nMore information about our Adult Challenge GP can be found by clicking the button below."
