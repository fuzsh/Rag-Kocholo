You don't really need much of a reason to go Go Karting, other than you just want to. It'll be kick ass. So if you think you've got the stones to put your self on the track and challenge everyone else to a race to the death (or just the finish line), do it. No excuses.\n\nHere's the info about the place:\n\nK1 Speed Santa Clara\n\n2925 Mead Ave,\n\nSanta Clara, CA 95051\n\nhttp://www.k1speed.com/\n\nPrices: http://www.k1speed.com/hours-pricing.html\n\nWe can go out to eat together after or something if you guys want. Make suggestions below.\n\nAnimal408\n\n174\n\n1\n\nAug 30, 2010\n\nSan Jose, California\n\nThat's what's up ill be there with my lil man. He's gonna show everyone whats up hahaha.

I had a party to go to and forgot about it. That's why Jacob made it for the 6th and sk we can try and get anyone who wants to go a heads up. It would be kool if hecka people rolled through with us. But doubt thats gonna happen haha. No ones really down other than you me and Jacob haha and a very few others haha.\n\nDirtyDSMDan\n\n92\n\n0\n\nSep 27, 2011\n\nSuisun City, California\n\nif it was in fairfield id be game, thats just a bit too far away for me unfortunately\n\n98GSXin\n\n930\n\n0\n\nJun 2, 2010\n\nSanta Clara, California\n\nI'm actually kind of surprised that more car guys aren't interested in going go karting. I thought everyone would be all over it. I understand if people have work or whatever, but this is going to be a good time. Not really expensive either. Seems like a no brainer to me haha.\n\nTurboDSM90\n\n1,188\n\n42\n\nAug 20, 2002\n\nFremont, California, California\n\nI would go....but go karts ain't exactly Cadillac sized\n\n98GSXin\n\n930\n\n0\n\nJun 2, 2010\n\nSanta Clara, California\n\nI would go....but go karts ain't exactly Cadillac sized\n\nBring your welder and we can rent two of them for you, then make a super Kart!\n\nTurboDSM90\n\n1,188\n\n42\n\nAug 20, 2002\n\nFremont, California, California\n\nTotally down!\n\n98GSXin\n\n930\n\n0\n\nJun 2, 2010\n\nSanta Clara, California\n\nPlan B would be to get to junior karts and rock them like roller skates!

The electric carts here have twice the horsepower of the gas karts at the one in fremont.

It's looking like a small get together anyways. Anybody outright opposed to switching it to 9pm?\n\nAnimal408\n\n174\n\n1\n\nAug 30, 2010\n\nSan Jose, California\n\nI say 9pm.\n\nbrianksm\n\n125\n\n0\n\nJan 27, 2012\n\nLos Gatos, California\n\nI'm cool with 9.\n\nFQVR4\n\n1\n\n0\n\nJun 16, 2006\n\nbrentwood ca norcal, California\n\nSounds like the old location of speedring ?\n\nOnce.upon a time it was the only local indoor karting place and in I think 2001 was the 1st ever bay area dsm meet, I was fun back them and I hope.to check it out this Friday so count.me in I'm itching to go racing again in a few years\n\n98GSXin\n\n930\n\n0\n\nJun 2, 2010\n\nSanta Clara, California\n\nI know there used to be another race track in the same building structure.
