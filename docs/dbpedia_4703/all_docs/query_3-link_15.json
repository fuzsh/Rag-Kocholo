        "text": "Located in the center of Orange County, California, Irvine is a convenient gateway to a true Southern California vacation. Visitors can enjoy miles of hiking and biking, golf, shopping, culturally diverse dining, activities and the city’s close proximity to the area’s popular beaches and attractions.\n\nA Master-Planned Community\n\nMaster-planned communities have a unique and ongoing history in the U.S. The origins of the master-planned community can be traced to a Californian named Simon Eisner, who in the mid-1960s developed a “General Master Plan” for Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\nMaster-planned communities are communities built entirely from scratch in underdeveloped areas. They are carefully mapped out to ensure they are sensibly developed in order to include green areas of open space, sufficient public facilities, and well-designed public buildings. In that way, they often serve an ecological scope for the community.\n\nWhen Southern California’s population exploded after World War II and development began to spill over the San Gabriel River from Los Angeles, the Irvine Company hired William Pereira, a profound and prolific design genius, to create the city’s master plan.\n\nPereira’s projects include the Transamerica pyramid in San Francisco, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the LAX master plan, Marineland, the Disneyland Hotel, the University of California, Irvine campus and Irvine’s master plan.\n\nAs a master-planned community, Irvine requires five acres of parkland for every 1,000 residents. Residents and visitors are provided a tremendous number of amenities and conveniences including extensive recreational options like golf courses, and expansive parks with bike paths and jogging trails.\n\nMaster-planned communities eliminate high-risk factors and contribute to Irvine being recognized as “America’s Safest Big City” by the FBI every year since 2005.\n\nAsk architect and historian Alan Hess to name the best-known master-planned communities in America and he’ll describe Reston, Virginia; Columbia, Maryland; and Irvine, California.\n\nPressed to name the best, he says: “Irvine is the best of them all. It is the largest, most successful application of important progressive planning ideas since 1900.”\n\nHess describes the personal benefits of the Master Plan. “Everything is close,” he says, pointing down the greenbelt.\n\n“There’s the library, the school, the parks, the pools and shops. It creates a sense of community.”\n\nThe Master Plan was designed to counter Los Angeles’ unbridled growth in the 1950s.\n\nFamed architect William Pereira designed a brand new city — one planned with a major university at its core.\n\nA city that balanced population with employment and open space; that maintained the highest standards of architecture and design; and that focused on Education.\n\nInstead of being absorbed by Los Angeles, Irvine became a model city nationally renowned for its schools, safety, parks, open space, employment and design.\n\nDiscover the Outdoors\n\nKnown as a leading tech and life science powerhouse, Irvine surprises with the most low-tech open space in Orange County! More than 16,500 acres of preserved natural habitats and wildlands, offering 60+ miles of trails for hiking and biking.\n\nThe Trust of Public Land recently ranked the city’s open space and parks as the best in Southern California, and the 10th best in the U.S., for the third straight year. Because of Irvine’s Master Plan, one-third of the city is preserved for outdoor recreation, that is five acres of parkland per 1,000 residents, making it one of the greenest cities in America.\n\nThe historic Irvine Ranch has preserved large swaths of open space and nearly 40,000 acres designated as the Irvine Ranch Natural Landmarks. Protected from development, the “hotspot” of biodiversity is accessible for guided hikes, yoga, mountains biking, and more. The scenic landscape has been designated a Natural Landmark by both the State of California and the U.S. Department of the Interior for its preservation of critically important flora and fauna.\n\nBommer and Shady Canyons beckon walkers and hikers to stroll past ancient oak, sycamore groves, and rough rock outcrops.\n\nThe 2.8-acre Quail Hill Trail is an easy two-mile natural surface trail and is the only wilderness trail part of the Irvine Ranch Natural Landmarks that allows dogs.\n\nThe Mountains to Sea Trail takes you on 22-mile journey starting in rugged, oak-filled Weir Canyon. The trail then takes you south toward the coast through five different cities and a portion of unincorporated Orange County – virtually guaranteeing that the only constant on this trek is an exhilarating change of scenery and topography. Walk, hike or bike from the Cleveland National Forest to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn addition, San Joaquin Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary are comprised of more than 300 acres of restored coastal freshwater wetlands. Twelve miles of trails serve as an oasis for walkers, joggers, and birdwatchers as well as a living laboratory for students, teachers, and the public. The sanctuary is home to 100 different species of birds.\n\nGlobal Flavor\n\nWith more than 40% of its population being Asian, Irvine offers foodies true global cuisine, with a wide selection of delicacies from China, Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam and other distant shores.\n\nStart your world cuisine tour at Diamond Jamboree, home to several restaurants that originated in Asia’s Pacific Rim. A unique Southern California destination that brings together a variety of cuisines and international flavor, including 85°C Bakery, Bao-Ping, Taipei, and Curry House CoCo Ichibanya, Nagoya, Japan. Add to the mix Tokyo Table, a chic Japanese fusion eatery that draws a bustling crowd with classic plates and unusual specialties in an innovative setting.\n\nHong Kong’s Tim Ho Wan, the self-described “cheapest Michelin-starred meal” where nothing on the paper mat menu priced over $6. The restaurant eschews the traditional dim sum cart for made-to-order dumplings to ensure their freshness. Irvine location is just one of four in the U.S. including New York, Las Vegas and Hawaii.\n\nSpecializing in coffee, cakes, and breads, 85°C Bakery, a Taiwanese chain of coffee shops, opened at Diamond Jamboree in 2009 as the first U.S. store. Why 85°C? It is the ideal temperature to drink coffee. Their most popular beverage is the Sea Salt Coffee – slightly sweetened iced coffee topped with creamy foam whipped with sea salt, with semi-sweet chocolate powder sprinkled over the top of foam.\n\nOne of a Kind Dining\n\nBistango offers artful New American cuisine and a Wine Spectator award-winning wine list with over 400 varieties of wine. The ambiance is further enriched each season by revolving modern art exhibits.\n\nAt Twenty Eight, Executive Chef Jay Lacuesta’s seasonal menu consists of sustainable seafood, local farm vegetables, and a wide selection of meats. Accompanying the foods are thoughtful signature crafted cocktails, whiskey, cognac, and handpicked wines by the sommelier.\n\nChef Kacy Jun and owner Bronnie Lee present creations inspired by Korean cuisine and street fare, the food truck movement, and fresh Southern California ingredients at Urban Seoul and Urban Seoul 2.0. Born in Southern California’s melting pot, its menu and traditional bibim bap (”mixed rice”) dishes are complemented by mall plates in a borderless kitchen.\n\nFor Andrei’s Conscious Cuisine & Cocktails, “Conscious Cuisine” means the freshest local and organically grown produce, as well as naturally raised meats and sustainable seafood. The culinary style incorporates the cultural diversity of California cuisine, focusing on the flavors and freshness of the Mediterranean.\n\nEating for a Cause\n\nVisitors can give back by dining at Andrei’s Conscious Cuisine & Cocktails where 100% of the restaurant’s profits benefit the Andrei Foundation, a foundation established in honor of the owner’s brother/son, Andrei Olenicoff, who was afflicted with an eye disease called Retinitis Pigmentosa. The primary focus of the foundation is to support eye research and provide support to those with visual impairment. The non-profit organization also focuses on a number of community and global causes including; a local guide dog team, Makapo Aquatics, a blind paddling team, surf lessons, and an Ocean Institute “ocean adventure” for visually impaired children. Globally, efforts include building a school library in rural Sri Lanka, funding and building a rain-collection clean water system in Nicaragua and providing life-changing surgeries for over 20 Russian orphans.

The spirit, the vibe of the former amphitheater is present at FivePoint, as music fans walk in they pass under a familiar archway, that was salvaged from Irvine Meadows and serves as the connection from the past to the future.\n\nImmediately upon entry to the venue, guests are ushered into a wide, grassy concessions area featuring an array of craft beer, cocktails and non-alcoholic drinks, as well as food from local eateries.

But the Irvine region has a long and rich history, dating back to 1878 when James Irvine acquired his business partners’ interests in 168 square miles of future Orange County land for $150,000; today, that amount would equate to $3.56 million. The acquisition created the great Irvine Ranch consisting of 110,000 acres stretching 23 miles from the Santa Ana River to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nVisitors can explore the oldest standing structure within the original boundaries of Irvine Ranch, and the first wooden house erected between Anaheim and San Diego at the Irvine Historical Museum.

In 1986, the silos were converted to the hotel. The center hexagonal concrete silos are now the interior corridors serving the rooms located in the exterior facing silos and the tin shed, kept mostly intact including the original main lift, is utilized as the area where the hotel serves breakfast.

The institute creates research teams consisting of members from multiple academic departments, students, industry, government, and community partners and enables prototyping in Calit2 “living laboratories of the future.”\n\nThese labs make it possible to push projects one step beyond academic theory and peer-reviewed publishing to building and testing integrated systems under real-world conditions and provide technical professionals a bridge between academia and industry to support activity in the living labs Calit2 works with industry partners from start-up to large companies in a variety of industry niches. Partners pose long-term research problems that they don’t have the resources to address in-house. Calit2 identifies the necessary expertise across the range of disciplines then forms a team of industrial representatives and applies that team to the problem.\n\nPartnerships with Calit2 enable industry partners to learn how students are using and developing technologies to identify emerging markets; prototype and test pre-commercial products and systems in the real-world settings; evaluate the possibility of teaming with other Calit2 partners on joint product lines, and evaluate students for summer internships and career employment."
