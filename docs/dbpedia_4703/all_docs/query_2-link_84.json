        "text": "Bingemans is teaming up with a California-based indoor electric go-kart company to bring a facility to the same space once occupied by an indoor skating rink in Cambridge Centre Mall.\n\nBingemans Hospitality announced the franchise partnership with K1 Speed on Tuesday and says customers will get to start their engines in late winter.\n\nK1 Speed has three Ontario locations, including Cambridge, among 75 locations around the world.\n\nThis is the second partnership between the mall owners Morguard and Bingemans, which operates Kingpin Bowling at the mall.\n\nNews of the partnership comes a month after Cambridge city council voted in favour of a recommendation report to allow go-karting to be added to the list of approved uses for the space within the mall.\n\nThe former indoor skating rink, which shut down at the beginning of the pandemic, was previously occupied by Suso Skate Co. roller skating, which began in May. The company vacated the space on Sept. 3.\n\nCalling the attraction \"unparalleled karting exhilaration in the heart of Waterloo Region\" in a press release, the companies say in addition to \"arrive and drive\" sessions, K1 Speed Cambridge will offer special event nights, racing leagues, and instructional classes, \"ensuring racers of all skill levels have a platform to compete, learn, and grow.\"\n\nK1 Speed says it offers electric go-karts that can touch speeds of up to 45 km/h for adults and 30km/h for juniors.\n\nOnce built, the Cambridge Centre Mall location will boast a second-floor viewing platform, offering views of the racing action.\n\n\"The Cambridge Centre offers an incredible dynamic space and superb viewing area. It's a thrill to watch races unfold from a unique vantage point, with the added delight of food, beverages, and arcade gaming,\" Mark Bingeman said, in the release.\n\nThe new facility will also offer corporate entertaining packages, which include sponsorship opportunities, lunch and learn racing, and tailored events for clients.\n\n\"We are ecstatic to bring elite kart racing back to the Waterloo Region, making K1 Speed Cambridge a landmark attraction,\" Bingeman said."
