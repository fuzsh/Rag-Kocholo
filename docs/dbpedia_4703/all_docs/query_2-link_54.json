        "text": "“I’m sure my story is different than most franchise owners as far as the way our K1 franchise got started. A friend of mine got me in touch with one of the owners along with Founder & CEO David Danglard. Once I was in touch with David and his team from K1 we were off and running! Essentially after signing the franchise agreement 45 days later we had our franchise successfully up and running generating sales at least two months earlier than expected. It has been an amazing experience!\n\nEveryone from the K1 team has been extremely professional and I feel blessed to be part of the K1 family. This was my first endeavor that was outside of motorcycle racing. I never imagined that it could have went as smoothly, with all of K1’s experience and help there were no surprises. David and his team came out to our facility very early on and designed everything in one day that looks exactly the way we have it now. K1 did it all, from computer track layout, and Paddock Lounge design, the pits furniture layout, entrance to the lobby with all the kiosks and point of sales, we just had to sit back and watch how everything came together, it turned out great!\n\nLooking back I am so glad that I did not have to do any of this without K1, their experience has helped us with everything. What to expect from everything to do with Karts, schedules, customer experience, running the facility from every detail. There was no guesswork to any of it including down to how much the public would enjoy it. They had our franchise and building ready for all of the things that we didn’t even know why we needed or didn’t need them. Especially whenever we need help from anything to do with our Karts, track, facility, anything it’s just simply reach out to K1\n\nWe are already looking forward to our next K1 franchise, 42+ locations and growing, that’s pretty impressive to me. Again thank you K1 family all the best!”\n\nKenny Roberts Jr.\n\n2000 MotoGP World Champion\n\nPrior to my decision to become a franchisee of K1 Speed, I visited several other karting companies located within the United States. One of the main reasons I chose to partner with K1 Speed, was brand recognition. The name K1 Speed is synonymous with karting and this was very important to me.\n\nFrom the moment I first met with the management team of K1 Speed at their head office in Southern California; to the opening of my own karting facility here in Puerto Rico, I have been extremely impressed with the overall professionalism of this company. Their staff were friendly, attentive and extremely knowledgeable about their product, and I felt very confident partnering with them.\n\nThe K1 Speed install team travelled to my facility in Puerto Rico to assist with everything, from the track construction, to staff training, and once again their professionalism was very evident.\n\nMy karting facility is now complete, we have been open for business for just over three weeks, and the initial response has been great.\n\nI look forward to partnering with K1 Speed on many more projects in the future."
