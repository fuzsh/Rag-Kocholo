        "text": "Conservation campaigners have said they are \"shocked and disappointed\" after councillors approved plans for a horse racing track near the site of the Battle of Bannockburn.\n\nThe plans would see a trotting track for harness racing built on land at Corbiewood on the outskirts of Stirling.\n\nThe National Trust for Scotland had objected to the plans, saying they would \"fundamentally alter the experience of the site\" for visitors.\n\nIt has now called on Scottish government ministers to intervene and block the move.\n\nMore stories from Tayside and Central\n\nListen to news from Tayside and Central on BBC Sounds\n\nThe Battle of Bannockburn, fought in June 1314, saw Robert the Bruce and his Scots army defeat the English troops led by King Edward II.\n\nThe proposed development would have parking for more than 200 cars and access roads within view of the battle site.\n\nThe National Trust for Scotland warned the traffic could result in an \"elevated risk of collision on the main road, endangering residents and visitors\".\n\nIt added that crowd noise, together with the public address system at the track, would \"greatly detract from the visitor experience at a nationally important historic site\".\n\nStuart Brooks, director of conservation and policy at the charity, said: \"This development will have a significant adverse impact on the nationally designated Battlefield of Bannockburn, a heritage site of national and international importance and part of our national identity.\"\n\nMr Brooks said the development would \"destroy one of the few remaining undeveloped areas of the designated historic battlefield\" and would also \"see one of the last green wedges disappear from Stirling\".\n\nHe added: \"The development will not only damage internationally significant heritage but will fundamentally alter the experience of the site for current and future generations.\n\n\"Following Stirling Council's approval, we ask that Scottish government ministers consider our concerns on behalf of the nation and call in the application for proper scrutiny and their own determination.\"\n\nA Stirling Council spokesperson said: \"The panel carefully considered all information relating to the planning application in making its decision.\"\n\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \"We understand that Stirling Council is minded to approve the proposal for the trotting track.\n\n\"The application will be notified to ministers who will decide whether or not to call it in for their own determination.\""
