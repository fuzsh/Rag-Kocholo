        "text": "Corporate entertainment is about to get a little racier.\n\nAt least that’s what the owners of K1 Speed, indoor kart racing facility, are banking on.\n\nIn addition to providing a combined 3,000 square feet of racing track the facility also features six conference rooms equipped with a DVD projector and wireless internet, with seating ranging from 12 to 60 people.\n\nCompanies can meet, eat and race, said owner Susan Danglard.\n\nRacing packages also include a trophy and medal for the first, second and third place racing winners, adding a little competitive edge, and maybe some bragging rights, for employees.\n\n“One of the reasons karting is so appealing (to companies) is that everyone knows how to drive, but not everyone knows how to play golf,” said Darrell Sitarz, vice president of the Karting Industry Council. “You can get everyone involved with this.”\n\nMarketing themselves as an alternative to the same-old corporate outing events of golf and tennis has been K1’s golden ticket.\n\n“About 50 percent of our business is corporate, that is why we chose Irvine,” she said.\n\nBut Danglard and her husband had to struggle before they were able to enjoy the fruits of their labor.\n\nThe couple was very familiar with the ups and downs of business ownership before they decided to open the first K1 Speed in Carlsbad. They previously manufactured and distributed their own jean clothing line.\n\nWhat they were not so prepared for were the conditions that were attached to and would hinder their opening an indoor karting facility.\n\n“It was rough,” Danglard said.\n\nThe couple had to get petitions from businesses and then also seek approval from city hall. By the time they opened in Carlsbad they had no money left for advertising, said Danglard.\n\nBut word of the facility, which has now been open for about three years, and its popularity soon grew.\n\nOpening an indoor karting facility is a huge investment, sometimes up to $7 million or $10 million, so you have to appeal to corporate entertainment to make money, Darrell said.\n\nK1 Speed now has a steady stream of clients, including about 200 companies, in their existing complex in Carlsbad and Danglard says she hopes to add more business to that list at their Irvine location.\n\nThey already have about 30 corporations that have contacted them to host events including Wells Fargo, United American Mortgage, Playmate Toys, Taco Bell and Fletcher Jones.\n\nThe couple, and their business partner Ben Ma, invested about $2 million into the 100,000 square foot Irvine facility. In addition to including conference rooms the complex also features a full deli and a game room with arcade games, air hockey and pool tables.\n\nK1 is also setting itself apart by offering electric, instead of gas, powered karts. The Italian pro-karts it uses can reach speeds of 40 mph and having two tracks means up to 20 people can race at one time. Every race includes between 12 and 14 laps around the track adding for a lot of competition.\n\nA score board lists lap times for every race, but individual racers receive their own race results. Watching racers, particularly men, in their 40s and 50s compete and compare scores is still a joy for Danglard’s she said.\n\n“I still have a smile on my face from watching the guys race. When they get out of the cars and give each other hi-fives, that is the best part,” Danglard said. One loyal client has a folder full of his scorecards, she added.\n\nNot only did the owners go bigger on this facility, they also didn’t skim on the décor. Most of the walls are lined with racing memorabilia including one wall above the registration desk which is lined with Boris Said’s racing jerseys. Said is another partner for K1 Speed in Irvine and decided to donate his jerseys to the facility.\n\nAfter a few laps around the track racers can also pose for pictures next to a Paul Walker, star of “Fast and the Furious,” custom designed racing car or a Carl Renezeder truck. The cars featured in the facility will change.\n\nThe Irvine location will open on July 5 and soon after the couple will look to open their next location in Los Angeles. After that they will open their fourth location in Temecula and hope to continue expanding K1 Speed through franchise opportunities."
