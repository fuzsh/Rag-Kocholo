        "text": "As a mom of teen boys, I was especially bummed to see both of Richmond’s indoor go karting facilities close over the last couple of years. But fortunately for us and for Richmond, California-based K1 Speed has opened its first Virginia location in North Chesterfield, and we couldn’t wait to check it out.\n\nThe K1 team welcomed us in the huge lobby area of their 50,000-square foot center, where we each jumped on one of their four computers to fill out our waivers (those under eighteen need a parent or guardian’s signature), get our membership cards, and pick out our head-sock color before heading into the racing area to go over the track rules, the flag colors and their meanings, and start the fun.\n\nK1’s state-of-the-art all-electric go karts produce zero emissions and are the fastest in the family entertainment space. The karts for teens and adults can reach speeds of up to forty-five miles per hour, and junior karts for children forty-eight inches or taller can approach twenty miles per hour, so we couldn’t wait to get behind the wheel.\n\nI went into this adventure planning to take pictures while the rest of our crew raced, but the K1 team convinced me that I didn’t want to miss out on the fun, and I’m so glad they did. What a rush of adrenaline I felt as I sped around the track, trying hard not to get shown up by my hubby and the teen boys. I managed to not crash, spin out, or otherwise embarrass myself, and I even came in second place – woo-hoo! After our twelve laps, we all agreed that we’d be back to visit K1 Speed.\n\nWe didn’t partake this time, but we did check out the fun trackside gaming area, which includes rows of video arcade games, pool tables, air hockey, basketball hoops, and even massage chairs.\n\nK1 is a great spot for birthday parties, corporate events (the rooms are A/V equipped), bachelor/bachelorette parties, bar/bat mitzvahs, etc. They have spacious rooms that overlook all of the racing action, as well as a lounge with plenty of drink and food choices, plus catering options.\n\nK1 is open 364 days a year (don’t go on Thanksgiving Day!), and no reservations are required. They don’t offer junior racing after eight o’clock on Friday and Saturday nights, so keep that in mind.\n\nK1 Speed is located at 1365 Carmia Way, just off of Midlothian Turnpike in the Chesterfield Marketplace shopping center.\n\nPricing is per race and per person, and you’ll get significant savings if you purchase multiple races on your pass ($18 savings if you purchase three races)."
