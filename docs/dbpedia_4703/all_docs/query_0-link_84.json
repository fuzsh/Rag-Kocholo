        "text": "Family-Fun Activity: Go-Karting At K1 Speed\n\nIf you’re looking for a family-fun activity, boy do I have an activity for you. It’s not only It can also help you get the need for speed out of your system. It doesn’t matter if you’re by yourself, on a date, or trying to organize a company event. I’m willing to bet everyone would love to go go-karting at K1 Speed.\n\nFamily-Fun Activity: K1 Speed\n\nLocated at 3404 Cragmont Drive in Tampa, K1 Speed serves as an indoor go-kart racing facility everyone can go to. You just have to fulfill their height requirements. With two challenging indoor tracks, the Paddock Lounge restaurant, and its own arcade, K1 has everything you need for whatever occasion. They even have meeting rooms with A/V connections just in case you’re looking for a spot for your next work function.\n\nWhat puts K1 Speed above other go-karting facilities is the fact that K1 uses 100-percent all-electric karts. These high-performance machines produce tremendous torque and horsepower from advanced electric motors. Not only will these karts outperform their gas-powered counterparts, but also be better for the environment, quieter, and arguably, easier to drive. K1 also provides you with helmets that have Go-Pro slots if you would like to record yourself driving. Don’t use your cell phones on the track though! It is very easy for you to drop it on the track while you’re driving and no one is going to stop If you’re a germaphobe like some people I know (cough cough Meredith) they do provide you with a racing mask.\n\nNot only does K1 have packages for kid-birthdays, but also teen and adult birthdays as well. Getting married? K1 even has bachelor party packages. They even do Bar and Bat Mitzvahs! To book your group of 8 or more, go to k1speed.com/groups-parties or call 1-813-341-6300.\n\nK1 Speed is open Sunday through Thursday till 10pm. However, they are open till midnight on Fridays and Saturdays. You do have to sign a waiver to be allowed to race, but you can fill one out beforehand if you go to k1speed.com/arrive-and-drive.html#waivers.\n\nSource: K1 Speed\n\nJen was born and raised in the Tampa Bay area.
