Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.\n\nGetty\n\nWhen it’s time to do your taxes, a tax prep checklist can keep you organized and help reduce stress. Here’s a rundown of the tax documents and information you’ll need.\n\nWhat Documents Do I Need to File Taxes?\n\nWhether you plan to file your tax return using tax software or work with a professional, review the checklist below before you start. And remember, if you’re married and filing a joint return with your spouse, you’ll need all of the following information for them as well.\n\nFeatured Partner Offers\n\n1\n\nTurboTax Deluxe\n\nFederal Filing Fee\n\n$69\n\nState Filing Fee\n\n$64\n\n1\n\nTurboTax Deluxe\n\nLearn More\n\nOn Intuit's Website\n\n2\n\nTaxSlayer Premium\n\nFederal Filing Fee\n\nPremium: See offer landing page for details.

Some common ones include:\n\nW-2s from your employer(s)\n\n1099-G forms for unemployment income and state or local tax refunds\n\n1099-INT, 1099-DIV, and 1099-B for interest, dividends, and stock sales\n\n1099-R and SSA-1099 for retirement plan distributions and Social Security benefits\n\n1099-S for income from the sale of your residence or other property\n\n1099-MISC for income from a rental property\n\n1099-Q for distributions from a 529 plan or Coverdell ESA\n\n1099-SA for distributions from a health saving account (HSA)\n\nSchedule K-1 for income from a pass-through business, trust, or estate\n\nAlimony received (if your divorce or separation agreement is dated on or before December 31, 2018)\n\nRecords of any transactions involving cryptocurrency\n\nInformation on other sources of income, such as gambling winnings, jury duty pay, cancellation of debt, etc.\n\nSelf-Employment and Business Records\n\nIf you’re self-employed, you need to report that income. You can also claim business expenses to lower your taxable income.\n\n1099-NEC or 1099-K showing income earned as an independent contractor\n\nRecords of all business income and expenses\n\nDocumentation for home office expenses, including square footage of home and square footage of area used exclusively for business\n\nRecords for business assets to be depreciated, including cost and date placed in service\n\nMiles traveled for business purposes\n\nDeductions\n\nDeductions can reduce your taxable income, lowering the amount of tax you owe or increasing your refund. Generally, you can claim the standard deduction, which is a flat amount based on your filing status, or itemize deductions. If you itemize deductions, you need information on:\n\nOut-of-pocket medical expenses\n\nPremiums paid for long-term care insurance\n\nForm 1098 showing any mortgage interest, mortgage insurance premiums, and points you paid during the tax year\n\nReal estate taxes\n\nState and local income taxes or sales taxes\n\nTaxes paid with your vehicle registration\n\nCharitable donations\n\nDocumentation of casualty losses (if you lived or owned property in a federally declared disaster area)\n\nIf you have any of the following deductions, known as adjustments to income, you can claim them even if you don’t itemize.\n\nForm 1098-E for student loan interest\n\nRecords of contributions to an HSA, IRA, SEP or self-employed retirement plan\n\nAlimony paid (for divorce or separation agreements dated on or before December 31, 2018)\n\nFor teachers, expenses paid for classroom supplies\n\nPremiums paid for self-employed health insurance\n\nTax Credits\n\nTax credits are a dollar-for-dollar reduction in the amount of tax you owe.

Make sure you include those estimates on your tax return, so you don’t pay twice.\n\nEstimated tax payments made during the year to the IRS and state and local tax authorities\n\nPrior-year refunds applied to the current year\n\nAny amounts paid with an extension\n\nCompare the best tax software of 2024\n\nProof of Losses\n\nVarious types of financial losses can be deductible. Bring documentation of the following losses if they apply to you in 2023.\n\nRecords for any stocks or other investments that became totally worthless or you expect to claim a loss, including date of purchase and original purchase price\n\nRecords of any non-business bad debts that are not collectible (for example, you lend money to your friend from your personal bank account and they don’t repay it)\n\nShould I Keep These Tax Documents After I File My Return?\n\nGathering all of this information before you file your return may take some time, but it ensures you have everything you need to claim every tax deduction and credit available to you.\n\nKeeping tax documents in a safe place after you file can also come in handy if you get audited. If the IRS or your state tax authority examines your return, they might ask for records supporting the income and tax breaks on your return. Having this information in one place will speed up the process and help ensure you don’t lose any of your deductions or credits.\n\nHelping You Make Smart Tax Decisions\n\nGet Forbes Advisor’s ratings of the best overall tax software, as well as the best for self-employed individuals and small business owners.
