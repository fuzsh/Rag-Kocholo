        "text": "K1 Speed is world-famous for its indoor electric go kart racing experience, which the brand pioneered in the United States nearly 20 years ago. The all-electric go karts produce zero emissions and achieve the fastest speeds in the indoor kart industry. The adult karts for teens and adults can reach speeds of up to 45 miles per hour, while junior karts for kids can reach a respectable 20mph. Anyone can drive the go karts as long as they can safely operate the vehicle and meet the minimum height requirements.\n\nHowever, go karts aren't the only thing families, friends, and employees can enjoy on a trip to K1 Speed. The new Rohnert Park location also features a large arcade with video games from past and present, pool tables, air hockey, basketball hoops, and prize machines.\n\nThose who are thirsty from a fun-filled day at the track can make a pit stop at the Paddock Lounge café located onsite. The Paddock Lounge serves a wide assortment of beverages: from non-alcoholic options such as sodas and energy drinks to a variety of beer and wine offerings for adults to enjoy after they've finished racing for the day.\n\nAnd in the very near future, popular food favorites such as burgers, wings, pizzas, nachos, and chicken tenders will also be served.\n\nWith so much to offer, K1 Speed Rohnert Park is destined to become a go-to party and event venue for nearby residents and companies. There is a private event space within the center that allows group parties to enjoy celebrations, meetings, conferences, and more during their special event.\n\nK1 Speed Rohnert Park is now open seven days a week at 4601 Redwood Drive. Reservations are not necessary to race - customers can \"Arrive & Drive\" on a first-come, first-served basis. More information can be found at http://www.k1speed.com/rohnert-park-location.html\n\nABOUT K1 SPEED\n\nFounded in 2003, K1 Speed is the world's largest indoor electric kart racing operator, and is soon to have 73 locations in seven different countries and 23 states. K1 Speed offers a unique upscale entertainment concept for casual consumers, racing enthusiasts, and corporate or group events. Each location features a unique track layout, cutting-edge electric go karts, the safest track barrier system, an onsite Paddock Lounge café, sophisticated decor, and authentic motorsport memorabilia. K1 Speed offers both an International Franchise and United States Franchise and is currently accepting applications.\n\nMedia Contact\n\nRyan Jurnecka, K1 Speed, 949-250-0242 Ext: 3010, [email protected]\n\nSOURCE K1 Speed"
