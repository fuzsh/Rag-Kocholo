        "text": "With the opening of its newest kart racing center in Addison, K1 Speed – America’s premier indoor kart racing company in the United States – now has not one but two centers serving the Greater Chicago area.\n\nTo commemorate its tenth anniversary (the original location was opened in Carlsbad, California in 2003), K1 Speed has opened its second location in the Chicago area. The new Addison karting center not only broadens the company's reach in the Midwest, but also represents a new milestone for the company; with K1 Speed Addison, there are now 17 K1 Speed centers situated throughout the United States. This success is due in large part to the company's approach to karting – it's safe to say that the company has been built on an uncompromising commitment to authenticity and quality. K1 Speed Addison is the latest product of this unceasing push forward.\n\nA New Kind of Kart Racing\n\nK1 Speed Addison, located in the Addison community of Chicago, allows both novice and veteran drivers alike the opportunity to partake in an authentic racing experience. The center features two separate track layouts that racers can choose from, and the two tracks can even be combined for special events such as private reservations and K1 Speed's own racing league, the Challenge GP race series. What truly distinguishes K1 Speed from the competition, however, is its karts. Unlike the gas-powered karts that most people are accustomed to, with their loud, smelly two-stroke engines and noticeable lack of torque, K1 Speed employs zero-emission, all-electric go-karts exclusively. As is the case with every K1 Speed center, there are no gas-powered karts at K1 Speed Addison.\n\nThese all-electric karts will please everyone from the most discerning of race enthusiast to the casual observer on the sidelines. When it comes to performance, they lack nothing: with 20hp electric motors that produce maximum torque throughout the powerband, they can accelerate to their top speed from a stop in mere seconds. There is no bogging or sputtering ever. These electric karts provide racers with the opportunity to really test out their skills behind the wheel. Unlike most karts found at public karting tracks, K1 Speed's karts are arguably better than the drivers that operate them. Like racecars, they beg to be driven hard and will reward talent.\n\nAnd yet, they will please the novice enthusiast or casual observer as well. K1 Speed's electric go-karts are quiet, reliable, easy to drive, and perhaps best of all, non-polluting. There are no exhaust fumes to contend with, no obnoxious racket emanating from unmuffled lawn mower engines; simply a high-power electric motor silently spinning at many thousands of RPM. The electric motors are safe too; they can be remotely governed or turned off completely should a driver be acting recklessly or an incident occurs that merits slowing drivers.\n\nA New Kind of Venue\n\nK1 Speed Addison is not like typical karting venues. Perhaps most strikingly, it's housed entirely inside. In Southern California or Texas, this may not seem important (or perhaps even necessary!), but in Chicago, it means that K1 Speed can serve the needs of driving enthusiasts and adrenaline seekers every day of the year, day or night, snow or shine, hot or cold. Chicago is no stranger to extreme weather, and K1 Speed has provided a solution that takes this into account. The differences extend beyond that, however. Unlike traditional karting venues, there are no poorly maintained tire walls or worn-down picnic tables shuffled off to the far corners of the property. In their place are plasma screen televisions, black leather couches, pool tables, and an observation lounge overlooking the center's expansive racetrack. Put simply, K1 Speed is a world-class entertainment venue.\n\nNew racers at K1 Speed Chicago-Addison will find the actual experience of racing to be quite different as well. With live telemetry built into every kart, racers are able to monitor their performance, and that of their competitors, in real time. They can then compare their performances against the hundreds of thousands of race enthusiasts who have competed at K1 Speed nationwide. The scoring system provides incredibly precise data on lap times and is a great tool for individuals who want to track their performance as they progress through the sport.\n\nA New Kind of Party Atmosphere\n\nK1 Speed is just as suitable for groups as it is for individuals. Relax and unwind while enjoying food and drinks at the Sky Box Bar & Grill. As with every K1 Speed location, the new karting center in Addison, Chicago has on-site meeting rooms and a variety of race packages that can be reserved for birthday parties, bachelor parties, corporate events, or team building exercises.\n\nThe meeting rooms themselves have everything that a group may need, including state-of-the-art multimedia systems, Wi-Fi Internet access, and ample seating. When not on the track racing, group members can explore the venue's museum-quality collection of racing memorabilia, get a snack or beverage at the Pit Cafe, or relax in the private meeting room. K1 Speed provides a unique – and memorable – alternative to traditional meeting venues.\n\nK1 Speed Addison is conveniently located for residents of the Greater Chicago area, including those living in West Chicago, Bloomingdale, Elmhurst, Franklin Park, Elk Grove Village, Lombard, and the communities near O'Hare airport.\n\nFor the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/prweb2013/6/prweb10809973.htm"
