        "text": "Q. One of the things I enjoyed a lot in my youth was go-cart racing. I remember going to a place sort of close to Knott’s Berry Farm. Do you remember? Are there any of those kind of tracks around anymore?\n\n– Stevie Copeland, Anaheim\n\nA. You’re right, Stevie, you don’t see go-cart tracks around like you used to. Similar to drive-in theaters, I guess, they tended to take up a lot of land – for not a huge amount of profit when compared to business parks and strip malls.\n\nThey’re also quite noisy with the revving engines, screeching tires and screams of enthusiasm from the drivers.\n\nI do recall the go-cart track you’re referring to, though I can’t recall the name and couldn’t find any reference to it online.\n\nMr. Anaheim went there a few times in his youth – and remembers getting yelled at by one of the operators for riding the brakes a little too much.\n\nThe track was located near the old Tower Records, near Lincoln Avenue and Beach Boulevard. It was a winding outdoor asphalt track, lined with old rubber tires.\n\nI can still recall getting behind the wheel of one of those go-carts – years before I would have been eligible for an actual driver’s license – and stepping on the accelerator.\n\nThey were little more powerful than a riding lawnmower, I’m sure, but something about being so low to the ground and being able to put the pedal to the floor made you feel like an Indy 500 racer.\n\nMy problem is that when I’d gain speed and see both another driver in my peripheral vision and a turn coming, I’d slam on the brakes. Often at the same time I was still accelerating – a big no no for the health of the engine and the braking system.\n\nSo I remember being scared when a track attendant appeared next to my “speeding” cart to loudly inform me that I needed to let off the brakes.\n\nI’m sure I never finished first. I’m a pretty tame driver to this day. But the buzz of those carts and the sharp turns were quite the adrenaline rush.\n\nI can remember two other tracks in Anaheim – though I’m guessing there were more. One was located off of Katella Avenue, near Anaheim Stadium in the 1970s and early ‘80s.\n\nAnd the other was located next to Camelot golf, off the 91 freeway. That was a much tighter track and what felt like slower cars, but it was still fun to challenge friends to a race. That track lasted for many years before it was torn down in the early 2000s to make way for – you guessed it – a business park.\n\nSo as far as I know, the outdoor go-cart experience is no more in this area.\n\nBut not far from that old track off the 91 freeway is K1 Speed go-cart racing, an indoor track at 1000 N. Edward Court.\n\nThe carts go fast enough that drivers must wear helmets. According to the company’s website, K1speed.com, the cars reach speeds of up to 45 mph. And the benefit of being indoors is that they can stay open much later without bothering the neighbors – on weekends, the track stays open until midnight.\n\nI’ve tried it for myself and it’s a blast – even if I was beaten around the track by all three of my much younger nephews. I guess you can put the driver on a new track, but you can’t take the slow out of the old driver.\n\nIf you go, Stevie, may it bring back some of the fond memories of your racing youth.\n\nQ. I know there’s a cool Beatles cover band that plays Pearson Park most summers. I’ve been meaning to go. Did I miss it this year?\n\n– Frank Dominguez, Anaheim\n\nA. You’re right, Frank. For the past several years, The Fab Four – a premiere Beatles cover band – has played the Pearson Park Amphitheater.\n\nWhile Mr. Anaheim appreciates the Beatles, I can’t claim to be a die-hard fan like those who can recite band history better than Ringo. Still, I can say, it’s a great experience. The band captures several of the Beatles’ iconic eras and the musicianship is top notch.\n\nAnd no, you didn’t miss this year’s performance. It’s scheduled for 7:30 p.m. on Sept. 26. The amphitheater is at 401 N. Lemon St. Tickets are $21 for adults, $17 for children and seniors. Information: 714-765-5191.\n\nEric Carpenter, or Mr. Anaheim, was a longtime Register news reporter and is now an Orange County Transportation Authority spokesman."
