        "text": "Not all undocumented immigrants entered without inspection. Many people who are now undocumented or “out of status” initially entered the United States with a valid visa or other immigration status. They did not depart the U.S. and eventually the status expired. In these situations, the entry was lawful even though the authorized period of stay expired many years ago.\n\nOne of the principal requirements to apply for a green card from within the United States, or “adjust status,” is that the person must have been “inspected and admitted or paroled.” A lawful entry generally means that the person came to the United States through a port of entry with a valid visa or parole document. Examples of lawful entries would be using a Border Crossing Card at a land border entry or providing a B-2 visa to Customs and Border Protection officer at any port of entry like an airport.\n\nThe immediate relatives (spouse, unmarried children under 21, and parents) of U.S. citizens are typically eligible to adjust status to permanent resident if they're are already inside the United States. In other words, they may apply for a green card, even if they overstayed for many years.\n\nTherefore, the U.S. citizen son or daughter (age 21 or older) may petition for an undocumented parent, and that parent can then adjust status to green card holder. For parents with no criminal history, no extensive immigration violations, and generally good moral character, adjustment of status should be a relatively straight forward process.\n\nAn undocumented parent who wants to adjust status and become a green card holder will need to submit an adjustment of status application package. The U.S. citizen child participates as a petitioner and sponsor. The adjustment of status package generally includes the following forms:\n\nI-485, Application to Adjust Status or Register Permanent Residence\n\nI-130, Petition for Alien Relative\n\nI-864, Affidavit of Support\n\nI-693, Report of Medical Examination and Vaccination Record\n\nI-765, Application for Employment Authorization (optional)\n\nI-131, Application for Travel Document (optional and generally not recommended for undocumented applicants)\n\nCitizenPath helps families by making the green card application process easy. We offer an affordable service, designed by immigration attorneys, that simplifies the process and is guaranteed to be approved by USCIS.\n\nAdditional supporting documents must be submitted with all forms above. This list of additional documents varies based on the answers. CitizenPath provides a personalized list of documents to submit with your application. You’ll know exactly what to submit and how to organize your application package.\n\nWhile somewhat obscure, some undocumented parents have been able to gain lawful permanent resident status through Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). If anyone or any employer submitted a visa petition for your undocumented parent on or before April 30, 2001, the parent may have a path to a green card.\n\nAnother relative may have filed Form I-130, Petition for Alien Relative, with your parent as the beneficiary. Likewise, an employer may have filed Form I-140, Petition for Alien Worker, on behalf of your parent. If either petition was filed on or before April 30, 2001, it opens a door for your parent to adjust status through a U.S. citizen child.\n\nFinally, there is a potential path for parents of U.S. military service members to become legalized. The undocumented parents of a U.S. citizen member of the U.S. armed forces can utilize Parole in Place (PIP) to gain a lawful immigration status. USCIS “paroles” your parents into the U.S., satisfying the lawful entry requirement to adjust status.\n\nInitially, Parole in Place provides protection from deportation and eligibility for work authorization. A grant of PIP from USCIS authorizes your parent’s stay in the United States for a one-year period. The best benefit is a Form I-94. USCIS will issue your parent an I-94 as evidence of parole. This document satisfies the lawful entry requirement for adjustment of status. Your parent can then adjust status as described in Option 1 above.\n\nBefore your parent can apply for a green card through adjustment of status, he or she must first get a PIP grant from USCIS. Your parent must submit Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, and several supporting documents to USCIS. We provide an overview of the parole in place application process, but we recommend using an attorney who is familiar with the process and unique requirements.\n\nOnce USCIS grants PIP to your parent, you may petition your undocumented parent and submit the adjustment of status package as described in Option 1. CitizenPath’s easy-to-use online service can help you through this process."
