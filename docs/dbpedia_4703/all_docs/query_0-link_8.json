        "text": "At K1 Speed Carlsbad, our popular Arrive & Drive racing packages allows racers of all ages to experience the thrill of head-to-head action! Perfect for families, friends and co-workers looking for things to do tonight, Arrive & Drive racing allows individuals to come in anytime, without a reservation, and race in our high-performance all-electric karts. Racers can purchase one race or a combo package of 3 races at a discounted rate. We must warn you though that racing can become addicting! If you want to introduce the thrill of motorsport to a friend, you can also purchase gift cards.\n\nK1 Speed Carlsbad is also an excellent choice for kid’s birthday parties, teen birthday parties, adult birthdays, corporate events, team building workshops, bachelor / bachelorette parties and other group events! Our meeting rooms provide a private space for business meetings or celebrations. Plus, we’ve sourced the best local caterers that’ll give your guests a meal to remember! Visit our group events page for more information or fill out an online inquiry and an events specialist will get in touch with you.\n\nWhether you want to blow off steam after a long day at the office in Oceanside, Escondido, Vista, San Marcos, Encinitas, Poway or visiting The Shoppes at Carlsbad, Carlsbad Forum and looking for some thrills this weekend, we invite you to K1 Speed Carlsbad in North County, San Diego. Our indoor karting locations are world-class entertainment venues, complete with professionally designed racetracks, spacious lobbies, authentic racing memorabilia, snack bars, and seating areas featuring leather couches and flat screen plasma televisions. When you’re not on the track, you can soak in the atmosphere and talk strategy with your fellow racers. To inquire about closures, please call K1 Speed Carlsbad today. If the track is open, then you are welcome!\n\nOne of the best indoor go kart tracks in Southern California!\n\nAn Arrive & Drive race is a timed event featuring up to 12 competitors. Rather than race each other for position, racers go up against the clock. At the end of the session, the racer with the quickest lap time is the winner and earns the privilege of bragging rights! Despite the relatively simple concept of a race against the clock, a timed session presents a unique challenge as achieving a quick lap time requires consistency and the skills to navigate and pass slower drivers. Just as in qualifying for a Formula One grand prix, one simple mistake can prove to be the difference between first and second place. And the clock doesn’t lie, so there are no excuses if your friend, co-worker, parent, son, daughter, or spouse beats you on the track!\n\nSetting a fast lap time and taking home the victory in our Arrive & Drive races also requires mastering our high-performance electric karts. As with all K1 Speed locations, our K1 Speed Carlsbad indoor karting location in North County, San Diego uses environmentally friendly, all-electric go-karts. With 20hp electric motors and maximum torque available from 0 rpm, the karts feature superb acceleration. Unlike gas-powered karts, which can easily bog in slow-speed corners and are weight sensitive, our electric karts can accelerate to top speed nearly instantly, regardless of driver weight. The difference is startling for individuals accustomed to the anemic performance of lawnmower-powered karts. Quite simply, once you try our electric karts, you’ll never want to race anything else!\n\nHello,\n\nMy family and I came into K1 on the morning of 1/1/16. Your offer to have us come in early so the whole family could enjoy a safe race with my son Garrett, made my year. Garrett suffered a traumatic brain injury in a car accident on 1/2/11, his best friend did not survive the accident. According to the statistics, Garrett should never of come out of his coma. But he did! Slowly but surely he recovers. Doing things we thought would never be possible, like driving a go kart. You and your staff’s generosity started our new year off right & created a positive vibe that fortunately carried us through the next day (which can be a very tough day for all of us). An extra thanks for treating Garrett with respect & consideration, like he and all people with disabilities deserve. Please share this heartfelt thank you to your supervisors and staff.\n\nForever thankful,\n\nKrista L."
