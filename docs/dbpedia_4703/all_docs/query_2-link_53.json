Well, GoPro Motorplex is right in the middle of it being in Charlotte, North Carolina.

However, you are sure to still have a great experience here with the track featuring a lot of high speed straight, and flowing corners which present good opportunities for overtaking.\n\nNew Orleans Motorsports Park (Avondale,LA)\n\nWebsite: https://nolamotor.com/karting/\n\nLearn to drive this track\n\nNew Orleans Motorsports Park is one of the biggest karting tracks in America. With over 30 acres of land dedicated to racing, this track features many different layouts and can accommodate large grids due to the long distance of the track.

For a track that puts your race form to the test, Speedsportz is the one to go for.\n\nAtlanta Motorsports Park (Dawsonville, GA)\n\nWebsite: https://www.atlantamotorsportspark.com/karting/\n\nLearn to drive this track\n\nIf Spa-Francorchamps was a karting circuit, it would be Atlanta Motorsports Park. This track is unlike any other on this list due to the fact that it features drastic elevation changes which tend to unsettle the kart and it’s balance. On top of all that, the racing is always fun and exhilarating, featuring very long straights that head into hard braking zones that are followed up by a difficult sequence of corners. If you are looking for a different challenge, look no further than AMP.\n\nUtah Motorsports Campus (Erda, UT)\n\nWebsite: https://www.utahmotorsportscampus.com/karting/\n\nUtah Motorsports Campus presents to us a unique scenery for a go-kart track as from images you will see online, it looks as if it is located in the middle of nowhere, with sand only surrounding the track. However, don’t let that sway you from trying this fast and flowing circuit that features a ton of medium to high-speed corners that present a very physical challenge."
