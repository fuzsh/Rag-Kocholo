        "text": "IRVINE, Calif., July 29, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- With more than a dozen centers located nationwide, K1 Speed is the largest indoor go-kart racing company in the United States. The company's newest location is now open in San Antonio, Texas, making it the third facility to call the Lone Star state home, behind Houston and Austin. The facility, like its peers, features tens of thousands of square feet of entertainment space, including a professionally designed indoor race track, spacious lobby complete with a museum-quality collection of authentic racing memorabilia, Pit Cafe snack bar, private rooms, and video arcade. The real draw, however, is the karting. With the opening of its San Antonio track, K1 Speed is introducing all-electric, indoor kart racing to Southwest Texas.\n\nIndoor Go-Kart Racing – Open to the Public Since 2003\n\nK1 Speed was founded nearly ten years ago, and since that time has revolutionized go-kart racing in America. Traditional go-kart venues were typically outside, poorly maintained, and made use of anemic gas-powered karts that were slow to maneuver around a track and quick to pollute. The opening of the first K1 Speed location brought with it a paradigm shift to the industry: all-electric go-karts, professionally designed race tracks, indoor venues that allow for year-round racing, and an attention to detail that was sorely lacking from outdoor tracks. This new approach quickly caught the attention of enthusiasts in Southern California, and the company has been expanding throughout the country ever since.\n\nResidents of San Antonio and surrounding areas can try their hand at indoor go-kart racing seven days a week, without a reservation. At K1 Speed, racers are furnished with helmets, provided instruction on proper track etiquette and how to operate the karts, and carefully monitored at all times. The electric motors in K1 Speed's fleet of karts can be controlled remotely, and if necessary, can even be shut off or modulated to ensure a safe driving environment for everyone. That being said, despite their performance (they can reach speeds approaching 45mph and can do so in a matter of seconds), the karts at K1 Speed are manageable and easy to drive. The company prides itself on providing a thrilling experience for racers of all skill levels – novice or experienced.\n\nPrivate Parties, Special Events, and More\n\nWith K1 Speed's Arrive & Drive package, individuals can come in any day of the week with friends, family, and strangers alike and race against the clock in a 14-lap battle. However, K1 Speed San Antonio also offers private reservations, race packages, and room rentals for groups looking to host private functions. These private packages are ideal for birthday parties, bachelor and bachelorette parties, Bar and Bat Mitzvahs, team-building exercises, corporate events, and other special functions. K1 Speed is a popular destination for parties and now residents of San Antonio can take advantage of the atmosphere that K1 Speed has to offer.\n\nK1 Speed San Antonio is conveniently located in the heart of the city, just fifteen minutes from the River Walk and in close proximity to SeaWorld. Residents of Leon Valley, Alamo Heights, and surrounding communities can contact K1 Speed San Antonio with any questions or simply show up for an Arrive & Drive race.\n\nContact:\n\nSusan Graver\n\nMarketing Director\n\n(949) 250-0242 x3008\n\nEmail\n\nThis press release was issued through eReleases® Press Release Distribution.
