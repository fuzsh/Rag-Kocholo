        "text": "We’ve got exciting news for anyone who lives in the San Diego county area – K1 Speed Chula Vista is now open!\n\nThat’s right, K1 Speed has taken over the old Speed Circuit location in the District at Eastlake and has completely renovated the place to our look, feel, and experience! Read on to learn about everything the new K1 Speed Chula Vista has to offer!\n\nIf you’re used to the old karting place, you’re in for a treat. That’s because all of those old, stinky gas-powered go-karts are gone, and in their place are clean new all-electric Adult and Junior Karts imported directly from Italy!\n\nThese karts are considerably faster than those old relics, and thanks to their new lithium batteries, last longer than ever! This means you won’t experience any decrease in performance from lap 1 to lap 12 (or lap 100+ for that matter). This is also the first location in Southern California to have the latest generation of our go-karts: the Superleggero! These new Adult Karts feature several enhancements over the previous generation, including a new digital gauge on the dash, modern open-wheel-style steering wheels, improved seat belt buckles, and lighter curb weight (hence the name, which translates to “super light” in Italian)!\n\nAnother major improvement we made to the old Speed Circuit facility is the creation of an all-new track layout and improved barriers.\n\nThe new track layout features an assortment of challenging corners, from tight hairpins to fast sweepers, which should prove to be more entertaining for experienced racers while not too intimidating for those new to the sport to enjoy.\n\nAnd gone are the large blocky plastic bricks for barriers. Now this location has Protex barriers – the safest indoor karting barriers there are, that not only look much better, but absorb impacts much better.\n\nWe all know racing is a very physical sport. So when you’re ready to recharge your batteries in between track sessions, make a pitstop at our Paddock Lounge inside K1 Speed Chula Vista. While the Paddock Lounge currently offers snacks and drinks, this eatery will in the near future, serve food and drink choices, including our Paddock Burger, Loaded Fries, wings, Mac and Cheese Bites, and a wide selection of non-alcoholic beverages. Also in the future, K1 Speed Chula Vista will also offer a selection of beer and wine for adults 21+ to enjoy when they are done racing for the day."
