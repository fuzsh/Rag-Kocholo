        "text": "Once home to a major motorsport venue in the 1970s, Ontario Motor Speedway, Ontario is now home to one of the best indoor go-karting locations in the country: K1 Speed, Ontario.\n\nOur 85,000-sq. ft. location is home to not one, but two indoor asphalt courses for double the occupancy and even less waiting. Track 1 offers a challenging series of technical corners, while Track 2 delivers a variety of fast and slow corners that is perfect for the novice or child. The K1 Speed, Ontario location also offer two distinctly different meeting rooms – one with leather couches for a laid-back social gathering, or a traditional meeting room with tables and chairs for parties and company events. Our on-site Paddock Lounge restaurant offers delicious food and refreshing beverages for all ages, while our video arcade and tabletop games keep the entertainment going.\n\nKnown as a fun thing to do near both San Bernardino County and Riverside County, Fontana, Rancho Cucamonga, Upland, Chino, Pomona, Ontario Mills, Toyota Arena, Victoria Gardens, and Ontario Airport, K1 Speed Ontario is the perfect destination for company functions, corporate events, hosting special events, or for a daily dose of adrenaline. And if you’re in town for an event at the Auto Club Speedway, we’re just a mere four miles away. Come race with us today!\n\nOne of the best indoor go kart tracks in Southern California!\n\nThough we offer a number of race packages that are ideal for special events, team building exercises, and corporate functions, the public is invited to come in anytime during regular business hours and enjoy the thrill of indoor go-karting. At our Ontario location, we operate not one, but two tracks. With the exception of private closures and our monthly Challenge GP series, these tracks are open to the public for Arrive & Drive racing. Simply show up, suit up, and race! Our high-performance electric karts have 20hp motors and produce maximum torque from 0 rpm, and are an absolute blast to drive. If you’re accustomed to lawn mower-powered karts that are heavy and cumbersome, be prepared to have your entire outlook on go-karts changed!\n\nAnd if you’re looking to host a kid’s birthday party, teen birthday party, adult birthday, bachelor / bachelorette party, corporate event, or team building exercise in the Inland Empire / Ontario area, then K1 Speed is here for you! We’ve got everything you need to make your event memorable: private racing, a reserved time, delicious catering options, and private meeting spaces for conferences or celebrations. Take a peek at our Group Events page to learn more about our events or fill out an online booking form now and an events specialist will be in touch with more information tailor-suited to your needs.\n\nAn Arrive & Drive race consists of a battle against the clock with up to 11 other drivers on the track. Rather than race for position, which rewards luck and blocking skill as much as it does pure driving talent, our time trial races demand consistency, skill, speed, and strategy. Setting a fast lap time often involves navigating around slower drivers and creating a window for yourself on track so that you can set a fast lap time unimpeded. If you get caught up in a neck-and-neck battle, don’t be surprised if the back-and-forth action hurts your lap times! Just like in Formula One, the key to setting a fast lap time is often getting as far away from other drivers as possible.\n\nRacers at our K1 Speed Ontario indoor go-karting track can purchase a single Arrive & Drive race or a combo pack of 3 races. There are also K1 Speed gift cards available if you want to purchase races for a friend or family member. During the race, competitors can track their performance in real time via live telemetry, and after each race, a competitor’s overall ranking is updated, showing his or her rank in comparison to the more than one million racers to have hit the track at K1 Speed."
