        "text": "I can’t possibly have 37 badass favorites for San Diego team building activities right? Well, San Diego is one of those bucket list cities that’s frigging perfect for a team building or offsite meeting. Between the crazy beautiful beaches, theme parks, and the culture, half the time I’m paralyzed with awesome activity options to choose from. If you didn’t know, I’m Taylor and I LOVE picking out the best of the best when it comes to team building in cities around the US and taking the guesswork away from you.\n\nDid you know there are over 150 breweries in San Diego County? We have people that know ever single one and can take your team there. I am definitely biased though because I’m always going to tell you that we’re the bestest most kick awesome option for team building. But I won’t stop there because San Diego is filled with other cool ideas. I realize that end to end planning and worry free booking aren’t for everyone (did I get you?). So I’ll always build out my lists with tasty local team building activity options that you should consider. But seriously, Firefly Team Events is the GOAT.\n\nThat brings us back to San Diego, which you can’t consider without realizing how many rad areas it’s made of like Ocean Beach, Mission Bay, Torrey Pines, and more. It makes it easy to host meetings and retreats and even easier to find fun team activities to host for your group. I love getting beers and pizza at Pizza Port in Solana Beach or San Diego’s BEST burger at Rocky’s in PB.\n\nAmazon learned how to create graffiti art as a team with our talented graffiti artists on the shores of La Jolla. Eroad Technology spent their time with us exploring and competing in a team scavenger hunt around Little Italy. Why not spend the day at the San Diego Zoo and then put together plushy animals for kids in need? There are a ton of fun and unique group event ideas that pair nicely with a visit to San Diego. I never claimed to be impartial.\n\nAll of the San Diego based activities on my list can be classified as team building exercises, fun team activities, or team bonding. The uniting factor is your group will be together and enjoying themselves as a team. This list of the best team building in San Diego and the surrounding areas like Mission Bay, La Jolla, Carlsbad, and more contains both indoor team building activities and outdoor team building ideas. Remember that no matter the team activity you choose, the true value is spending time together. Connection in the current landscape of remote work and hybrid workplaces is more important than ever.\n\n1. Team Graffiti: Mural Madness\n\nTake advantage of the beautiful weather in Southern California with my personal favorite San Diego team building activity: host a graffiti event for your team members. Learn from professional graffiti artists and collaborate on a “masterpiece” as it’s known in the graffiti world. Teams love to take home their completed art and put it on display in the office. The art piece can be an original concept, targeted message, or a letter in a larger message that is combined for a larger piece. Your teams will LOVE this unique and educational experience.\n\nPricing: Price varies\n\nGroup Size: Any\n\nAddress: Any\n\nWebsite\n\n2. Guac Rock: A Guacamole Making Competition\n\nA list of San Diego team building activities would be incomplete without something celebrating Mexican culture and food!

My team freaking loves getting the photos back from our hunts because we know they will be full of hilarity.
