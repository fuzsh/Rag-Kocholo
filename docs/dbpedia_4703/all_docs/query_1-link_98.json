        "text": "Golf and Formula One. The two sports aren't often mentioned in the same breath, but there is a new exciting collaboration just announced between #taylormade and #redbullracing What are the links between golf and Formula One that make this collaboration have the potential to exist? You only have to look at the special edition Red Bull liveried Stealth 2 driver from TaylorMade to start to see the link. The Stealth 2 is designed through a process of computer-aided design and extensive wind tunnel testing. The Stealth 2's time in the wind tunnel helps engineers shape the head to be as aero-efficient as possible to help increase club head speed for the golfer. The Stealth 2 also features extensive use of carbon composite to reduce weight and increase performance. These three areas are all key to designing a Formula 1 car, which helps people understand the collaboration. We've already seen partnerships between golf and car manufacturers, but the link between Red Bull and TaylorMade is the first between Formula One and golf. Will we see more collaborations in the future? Does the partnership between Red Bull and TaylorMade open up interest from people who have never played or followed either sport? #taylormadegolf #redbullracing #formulaone #golfblogger #golfindustry #freelancecopywriter https://rb.gy/s7gn9\n\nRacing and Sports is excited to announce it has signed a three-year deal with Racing and Wagering Western Australia. Highlights: -Three-year deal signed with Racing and Wagering Western Australia for RAS to supply market-leading racing content for TABtouch's international racing offering. The deal also includes two additional one-year options. - RAS is contracted to receive $1.16 million plus indexation over the initial three-year term, with an additional $772k plus indexation to be received upon the exercise of the optional two one-year options (potential total contract value in excess of $1.93 million). - RAS will provide TABtouch with its market-leading analytics, predictive models, race overviews and other premium content for all Tier 1 international racing jurisdictions, replacing an incumbent supplier. - The deal represents an important extension of the existing relationship – which until now has included digital advertising and support with integrity monitoring technology and paves the way for further commercial partnerships to be explored. - The new agreement is in the Enhanced Information Services business segment, which given RAS’s extensive capability and scale is the highest margin of the Company’s offering. - The Company's pipeline remains robust as it continues to experience strong demand for market-leading content and data solutions from operators, in the backdrop of globalisation within the industry. Commenting on the significance of the RWWA international content deal, RAS CEO Stephen Crispe said: \"We are excited to be working with TABtouch and look forward to partnering with them to strengthen their offering to punters to increase engagement. We will continue to work with them to explore new opportunities for innovation and enhancing the customer experience.” \"The quality of content, analytics, and tips provided to customers has a proven link to drive turnover. Racing is a 24-hour business with race meetings held in nearly every continent most days of the year. It is important for Australian punters that they have access to detailed form, analytics and tips for these international meetings to provide informative insights in order to wager with confidence.” Stephen Crispe Gary Crispe Tim Olive Alex Steedman\n\n🐎🌟 Day 3 at Cheltenham Racing Festival: Where Tradition Meets Innovation! 🌟🐎 As the exhilarating races unfold on Day 3 of the Cheltenham Racing Festival, it's the perfect time to reflect on the dynamic relationship between tradition and innovation in the world of horse racing.
