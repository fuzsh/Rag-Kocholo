        "text": "Travelers around the world flock to Disneyland Resort, but thereâs more to do in this part of California than visiting Mickey Mouse.\n\nWhether youâre a sports fan, a history lover, or a thrill-seeker, thereâs something to do near the Happiest Place on Earth. To kick-start your travel planning, here are the best things to do near Disneyland Resort for visitors of all ages.\n\nThe Best Things To Do Near Disneyland Resort in California\n\n1.Â Adventure City\n\nSince 1994, Adventure City has entertained families with its classic fair rides, petting farm, and games. With over 18 attractions on the property, the park has something for most families. In particular, the space is known for its relaxing environment while offering its guests hours of fun.\n\nSome of the most beloved parts of the park are Mount Adventurous, Thomas the Tank Engine Creative Play, and the Giggle Wheel. You can make special arrangements for birthdays and other parties.\n\nThe nearest bus stop is Beach-Starr.\n\nAddress: 1238 S. Beach Blvd., Anaheim, CA 90680\n\nHot Tip:\n\nThe Visit Anaheim Savings Pass is free and gives you discounts for specific restaurants, transport, and activities.\n\n2.Â American Ninja Warrior Adventure Park\n\nIn Santa Anaâs MainPlace Mall, the American Ninja Warrior Adventure Park is the perfect place for fans of the hit TV show. The course consists of obstacles similar to those used by the actual showâs athletes, so you and your family can compete to see who is the toughest, strongest, and most athletic.\n\nSome of the most popular parts of the course are the Monkey Swings, the Spider Walls, and the Warped Wall. Thereâs also an inflatable obstacle course, which is perfect for youngsters.\n\nThe nearest bus stop is Main-Main Place.\n\nAddress: 2800 N. Main St. #603, Santa Ana, CA 92705\n\n3.Â Anaheim ICE\n\nAnaheim ICE is such a popular indoor rink that even professional hockey teams and skaters use it. Initially, the space was commissioned by Disney, but itâs since become an independent business used for figure skating competitions, lessons, parties, and leisure skating.\n\nIt rarely gets cold enough for snow in Southern California, so the rink is one of the best ways to enjoy this winter activity, no matter how warm it is outside. Adult and child skate sizes are available.\n\nThe nearest bus stop is Lincoln-Clementine.\n\nAddress: 300 W. Lincoln Ave., Anaheim, CA 92805\n\n4.Â Angel Stadium\n\nAngel Stadium is Anaheimâs big stadium and the home ballpark of the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nMost families visit the stadium on game days, but you can take an in-depth guided tour of the space during the off-season or when thereâs no game scheduled. These tours even grant you access to the locker room, the dugouts, and other areas usually closed to the public when athletes are on the premises.\n\nThe nearest bus stop is State College-Gene Autry.\n\nAddress: 2000 E. Gene Autry Way, Anaheim, CA 92806\n\n5.Â Bowers Museum\n\nHistory- and art-loving families have been visiting the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana since it opened in the 1930s. The space has acquired over 100,000 items, many of which are Native American or pre-Columbian pieces.\n\nIn addition to the permanent exhibit, the museum regularly hosts temporary exhibitions that feature specific artists, cultures, or periods. Most are family-friendly, but call ahead to be sure. Thereâs even an interactive area for young visitors, the Kidseum, to get children more interested in the arts.\n\nThe nearest bus stop is Main-20th.\n\nAddress: 2002 N. Main St., Santa Ana, CA 92706\n\n6.Â Camelot Golfland\n\nYou can find Camelot Golfland sites throughout California, but the one in Anaheim is a particular favorite among visitors. The parkâs centerpiece is the miniature golf area, which features different courses of varying difficulty, all King Arthur-themed.\n\nThe Anaheim site also includes a bumper boat pool, laser tag, and child-friendly race cars.
