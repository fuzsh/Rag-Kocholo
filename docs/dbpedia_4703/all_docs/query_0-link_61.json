        "text": "Lee & Associates Closes $7.5 Million Industrial Lease Transaction in Thousand Oaks\n\nTransaction is part of aggressive expansion plans by K1 Speed, the world's largest electric indoor kart operator\n\nLee & Associates- LA North/Ventura, a leading commercial real estate brokerage firm, completed a lease for a 50,000 SF, one-story industrial building located at 770 Lawrence Drive, Thousand Oaks, which will be the new home for K1 Speed, the world’s largest electric indoor karting operator.\n\nMike Tingus, President of Lee & Associates- LA North/Ventura and Grant Fulkerson, SIOR, Principal, represented the landlord BM Properties, while Lee & Associates Riverside’s Rocky Moran, Vice President represented K1 Speed in the transaction, which has an aggregate value of approximately $7.5 million on a 10-year lease term.\n\n“Given there are no other indoor racing venues currently operating nearby, this is an ideal place for K1 Speed as they continue their aggressive expansion plans throughout California and beyond. This building was an ideal fit in every way and had the ideal form and function K1 Speed was looking for,” said Rocky Moran. “With more than 50 locations already, this was a natural addition for what is now, with COVID, a pent-up demand for something fun for almost every person, from any walk of life to participate in.”\n\nK1 Speed is the industry leader in electric kart racing serving the general public and offering corporate events. This popular service will fulfill a void left by a similar use that formerly operated in the market.\n\n“Rocky Moran of Lee & Associates helped us with one of our first 50-acre land acquisitions for our premier outdoor facility many years ago and we’ve grown substantially with them on our team,” said David Danglard, owner of K1 Speed. “There is no question that they understand our needs and actively search throughout the country to seek out prime locations for our brand. Given they have 50+ offices throughout the United States, it is easy to partner with them to find new locations for us.”\n\nFounded in 2003 by David Danglard and Susan Danglard, K1 Speed first opened up in San Diego, California. Today, they operate 46 locations around the United States, Canada, Mexico South Korea, Puerto Rico, Italy, China and France.\n\nBuilt in 1984, the industrial building is located close to numerous retail amenities and has easy access to highway 101 and shall serve neighboring communities of Thousand Oaks, Calabasas, Agoura Hills and Camarillo. The building includes a 2.2-acre site, ample parking, over 20’ ceiling heights and just underwent a major rehab.\n\nMore on K1 Speed’s soon to open Thousand Oaks location at www.k1speed.com/thousand-oaks-location.html.
