        "text": "Some of the investment funds in the embattled $400 million LeFever Mattson real estate empire are likely headed to bankruptcy court, according to an email to investors obtained by The Press Democrat.\n\n“Certain entities will be forced to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,” partner Tim LeFever wrote Monday to investors who had signed up to communicate with LeFever Mattson in its attempt to expose the allegedly unlawful maneuverings of the other partner, Ken Mattson. “These filings will be needed to protect valuable assets from foreclosure and to ensure a transparent sale and claims process.”\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, no related documents had been filed in federal court. Tim LeFever did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe possibility of bankruptcy has been discussed with interest and some apprehension among the hundreds of individual investors whose money has helped to finance the duo’s vast real estate portfolio.\n\nThe Press Democrat reached out to a handful of those investors, but none agreed to talk on the record.\n\nTheir focus is not misplaced, said Brett Weiss, managing member of the Weiss Law Group in Greenbelt, Maryland, and the co-author of “Chapter 11 for Individual Debtors.”\n\n“I’ve often said bankruptcy is probably the most deceptively complex area of law,” Weiss said Tuesday. “It looks real simple. You’ve got some forms to fill out and, boom, you’re in bankruptcy. But it’s sort of an overlay of all other areas of law – investment law, real estate law, corporate law, secure transactions. It really can get incredibly complex.”\n\nThat may prove especially true in the case of LeFever Mattson, considering the partners’ fundamental disagreement on what, exactly, their investors own.\n\nIn group emails and a civil lawsuit, LeFever has claimed Mattson sold interests the company didn’t actually possess, paying investors from a shadow account he created. Mattson, in his own public statement and lawsuit, insisted those transactions were aboveboard and that any failure to pay out monthly distributions falls solely on LeFever.\n\nOne question on the minds of some worried investors is how a bankruptcy proceeding would work in parallel with the half-dozen lawsuits that have been filed against Mattson, LeFever and their companies. Those include a case filed in federal court that is seeking class action status.\n\nThe bankruptcy case will take precedence, Weiss said, putting everything else on hold – including class certification. That said, it is not uncommon for a bankruptcy judge to allow other jurisdictions, such as state and U.S. courts, to settle factual matters first.\n\nThere is one potential hiccup in the bankruptcy process, unmentioned in LeFever’s email. Several investor agreements shared with The Press Democrat include a provision stating that the partnerships, which are part of the LeFever Mattson portfolio, cannot file for bankruptcy without a majority vote of partners – that is, a majority of the fund’s investors.\n\nIt’s unclear if LeFever has reached out to any of those investors to seek approval.\n\nHis recent email also announced that LeFever Mattson has hired Bradley Sharp of Development Specialists as a financial adviser. Sharp, according to his company’s website, “has operated and sold publicly and privately-held troubled companies in and out of bankruptcy.”\n\nSharp will supervise LeFever Mattson’s financial advisers and accountants, and work with management to develop a restructuring plan for the company, Tim LeFever wrote. Sharp will also “oversee the continuing investigation into allegations against Ken Mattson, the Company’s former CEO.”\n\nUnder Sharp’s guidance, according to LeFever, the company is preparing a plan to monetize assets in a way that maximizes returns to “all creditors and investors.” But the monthly distributions some investors have relied upon to pay their monthly bills will not be resuming anytime soon.\n\n“The Company recognizes the hardship this is creating and is working diligently to complete this process as promptly as possible,” LeFever wrote.\n\nCloser to home, a number of Sonoma properties owned by companies associated with Ken Mattson continue to show up on a list of addresses set for public auction. With a major update: One bundle of properties now has a bid price. And as of Tuesday afternoon, the auction was set for 10 a.m. Wednesday at Fremont Park in downtown Santa Rosa, though auction dates for the Mattson properties have already been postponed multiple times.\n\nThe parcels 525 West Napa Street and 520, 530 and 533 Studley Street – Duggan’s Mission Chapel and a set of properties behind it – were listed with an opening bid of a little over $5 million. That price is set by the lender. In this case, that’s Duggan’s, which carried the mortgage when it sold the properties to KS Mattson Partners (a company solely owned by Ken Mattson) in September 2022.\n\nKS Mattson Partners then sold the bundle to Windscape Apartments LLC, which lists Tim LeFever as registered agent, in 2023.\n\nPublic auctions for another seven properties owned by KS Mattson Partners have been rescheduled from Aug. 9 to Aug. 16.\n\nYou can reach Phil Barber at 707-521-5263 or phil.barber@pressdemocrat.com.
