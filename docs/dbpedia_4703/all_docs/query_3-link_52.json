        "text": "Housekeeping\n\nBusiness is business.\n\nWhile being a CRNA has some unique nuances, a 1099 contractor is considered a business owner. Therefore, most of the CRNA tax deductions below are universal to the general business world; we simply put a CRNA spin on them. Everyone wants to feel special, and we get that, but the tax code wasn’t written specifically for certain professions or business owners; it was written with a generalist mindset. As such and as small business consultants, we explain and leverage the code to each business owner from their perspective.\n\nMarginal Tax Rate\n\nQuick lesson on small business tax deductions. When you write a check, and it has a tax savings element (office expense, 401k, IRA, charity, etc.) it is not a dollar for dollar savings. For example, if you are in the 22% marginal tax bracket, you must write a check for $4,000 just to save $880 in taxes.\n\nCash Savings or Tax Savings.\n\nYou can save $50,000 today! Yes, today! You just need to write a $150,000 check to your church. Huh? That might not sound like the best idea to a lot of people since so much cash is leaving. In other words, most people are in the cash-saving business, not the tax-saving business. If we can do both, great. However, most tax-savings moves take cash, and cash is what you want to keep. So keep this concept in mind as you review the CRNA business deductions below.\n\nBuilding Wealth\n\nAt the end of your life, you’ll measure your financial success on the wealth you built, not the tax you saved. We agree that a part of wealth building includes tax savings, but be careful not to sacrifice wealth for the thrill of a tax deduction (or deferral). Here is an example: let’s say you stuff all your available cash into a tax-advantaged retirement account, such as a 401k. A few years go by, and a great rental comes on the market, but your cash is all tied up in a 401k. You just sacrificed potential building of wealth by not having an intermediate investment strategy for the sake of tax deferrals.\n\nThe Trick\n\nHere’s the trick. The Holy Grail, if you will. You need to find a way to deduct money you are already spending. Let’s take automobile depreciation. You are already comfortable with automobiles losing thousands of dollars in value, especially in the early years, so let’s find a way to make this degradation in value a tax windfall in CRNA business.\n\nThe hardest thing for a new 1099 CRNA is thinking of themselves as business owners. If concepts like revenue, expenses, and profit are foreign, then you are going to struggle for a bit until you get up to speed. A 1099 or locums contract is not just a new way of getting paid; it is a new way to conduct your finances.\n\nLocums or Temporary Duty Assignments (TDY)\n\nThe IRS sums this up nicely in IRS Topic 511 Business Travel Expenses which comes from IRS Publication 463-\n\nYou’re traveling away from home if your duties require you to be away from the general area of your tax home for a period substantially longer than an ordinary day’s work, and you need to get sleep or rest to meet the demands of your work while away.\n\nGenerally, your tax home is the entire city or general area where your main place of business or work is located, regardless of where you maintain your family home. For example, you live with your family in Chicago but work in Milwaukee where you stay in a hotel and eat in restaurants. You return to Chicago every weekend. You may not deduct any of your travel, meals, or lodging in Milwaukee because that’s your tax home. Your travel on weekends to your family home in Chicago isn’t for your work, so these expenses are also not deductible. If you regularly work in more than one place, your tax home is the general area where your main place of business or work is located.\n\nIn determining your main place of business, take into account the length of time you normally need to spend at each location for business purposes, the degree of business activity in each area, and the relative significance of the financial return from each area. However, the most important consideration is the length of time you spend at each location.\n\nYou can deduct travel expenses paid or incurred in connection with a temporary work assignment away from home. However, you can’t deduct travel expenses paid in connection with an indefinite work assignment. Any work assignment in excess of one year is considered indefinite. Also, you may not deduct travel expenses at a work location if you realistically expect that you’ll work there for more than one year, whether or not you actually work there that long. If you realistically expect to work at a temporary location for one year or less, and the expectation changes so that at some point you realistically expect to work there for more than one year, travel expenses become nondeductible when your expectation changes.\n\nIf you take a locum CRNA position for three months in a lovely Colorado mountain town because the go-to CRNA is on maternity leave, your travel, lodging, and meals are all deductible. Yay! There are some other deductions too, but those are the big ones.\n\nYour lodging is deductible, Yes, but what about an RV or a camper as you travel from town to town, state to state? WCG has several traveling medical personnel (and other business owners such as independent insurance adjusters chasing natural disasters) using an RV as their temporary housing. In these situations, we determine a business use percentage and have the business reimburse you accordingly.\n\nWhat about groceries? Yes, meal-related groceries are typically deductible as a meals expense.\n\nWhat about cleaning supplies, toilet paper, etc.? Yes, to a certain degree these are deductible. When you stay at a hotel, they are indirectly charging you for cleaning, cleaning supplies and other things within their cost structure through their nightly rate. Keep it reasonable. Keep it deductible.\n\nBeing an Itinerant\n\nKeep in mind the IRS definition of itinerant (IRS Publication 463)\n\nIf you do not have a regular or a main place of business or post of duty and there is no place where you regularly live, you are considered an itinerant (a transient) and your tax home is wherever you work. As an itinerant, you cannot claim a travel expense deduction because you are never considered to be traveling away from home.\n\nIf you are deemed an itinerant, then your travel, meals, and lodging expenses are no longer tax-deductible. Let’s break this down because it is a big deal. If you bounce from locum to locum, contract to contract, and do not return to a “home base” where you regularly live, then your tax home travels with you. If your tax home and your work place are the same, then travel is considered commuting, meals are considered personal and lodging is considered personal rent. In other words, not tax-deductible.\n\nAnother way to look at this- it is not about the contract’s location or the temporary nature of your contracts, it is all about maintaining a residence where you regularly live and also work (at least part or some of the time).\n\nScenario A- You have a home in Dallas. You take a contract in Minnesota for the summer, and then return to Dallas for several months. You accept a contract in Florida the following spring and another in Minnesota that summer. You later return to Dallas. This is a wonderful example of an acceptable temporary duty assignment, and meals, travel and lodging are likely to be tax deductible.\n\nScenario B- Same situation above, but you do not return to Dallas for 18 months. This one gets a bit tricky. Perhaps the first 12 months are deductible since you always intended to return, but the last 6 months are not. This scenario would need more discussion.\n\nScenario C- You live in Idaho along with your family. You take contracts in various metro areas (cities) throughout Oregon. You regularly return to your personal residence in Idaho, and magically your family is still there. Oregon would be considered your tax home since you cannot satisfy IRS Publication 463 tax home determination #1 (see below).\n\nScenario D- Using the RV from above, most of your immediate possessions including your dog travel with you from city to city, contract to contract. You rent out your home back in Dallas. You are likely to be deemed an itinerant.\n\nTax Home Determination\n\nQuestions revenue agents ask when determining residency and tax home (and sometimes referred to an abode).\n\nWhere is your drivers license? Where is your car registered? Do you have a car?\n\nWhere do you vote?\n\nWhere are your possessions? In storage or in your residence?\n\nDo you rent your residency to anyone? Where is your family (with you or back home)?\n\nWhere do you earn your income? Do you earn a substantial amount of income close to your residence?\n\nDo you have proof of living expenses such as meals, gas for your car, recreation and utilities showing your return to your residence (this one trips up people a lot)?\n\nHere is another blurb from Publication 463:\n\nFactors used to determine tax home. If you don’t have a regular or main place of business or work, use the following three factors to determine where your tax home is.\n\n1. You perform part of your business in the area of your main home and use that home for lodging while doing business in the area. Most traveling CRNAs cannot meet this test.\n\nHow to read – you generally must earn as much in the metro area of your main home as you do in any other location. For example, home is Florida where you earn $125,000. You earn $80,000 in New Hampshire and another $56,000 in South Carolina on temporary contracts. This satisfies #1.\n\n2. You have living expenses at your main home that you duplicate because your business requires you to be away from that home. Read that again- “you have living expenses at your main home.” Most traveling CRNAs also cannot meet this test.\n\nHow to read – you must be able to show that you have grocery bills, utilities, recreation expenses, bar bills, dining and other “living life” expenses in all locations (your main home and your other geographical areas). If you only have these types of of expenses in your “locums” locations, you will not satisfy #2.\n\n3. You haven’t abandoned the area in which both your historical place of lodging and your claimed main home are located; you have a member or members of your family living at your main home; or you often use that home for lodging.\n\nHow to read – you must show familial ties to your main home, either directly with your butt staying there or members of your family staying there. If you return only on occasion, and your family such as a spouse, travels with you, #3 is harder to meet. Having said this, #3 is certainly more squishy than the others.\n\nIf you satisfy all three factors, your tax home is the home where you regularly live. If you satisfy only two factors, you may have a tax home depending on all the facts and circumstances. If you satisfy only one factor, you are an itinerant; your tax home is wherever you work and you can’t deduct travel expenses.\n\nWCG CPAs & Advisors follows the rules above. While your friend who travels all over the country for multiple years and deducts all their traveling, meals and lodging means three things- a) they might think they are deducting it but their tax pro quietly doesn’t allow it, b) their facts and circumstances are not like yours or c) their tax pro doesn’t know the basics. This isn’t a gray area. Publication 463 is quite clear. Please stop talking in the O.R. or logging a bunch of time on Facebook. The misinformation will drive you crazy.\n\nTax Court Cases\n\nOne of the best ways to illustrate the issue is a quick review of some Tax Court cases\n\nBarrett v. Commissioner, Tax Court Memo 2017-195\n\nBarret was a video producer in Las Vegas, Nevada (this is getting good already). His employer constructed offices in Washington, D.C., which required Barrett to travel to and from several times a year. His average stay in Washington was about two weeks.\n\nBarrett claimed about $55,000 in travel expenses and the IRS challenged arguing that his tax home was in Washington and not Las Vegas. However, the Tax Court disagreed with the IRS because Barrett proved that he did substantial work for his employer in Las Vegas in addition to the work in Washington. As such, his tax home was considered Las Vegas and not Washington. Specifically, the court quoted Markey v. Commissioner (490 F.2d 1249, 1255)-\n\nDetermining the principal place of business includes review of the location where the taxpayer spends more of his time, engages in greater business activity, and derives a greater proportion of his income.\n\nThis allowed him to deduct his travel expenses including lodging and meals since he was not commuting to his tax home. A win for Barrett. But… he eventually lost since he could not substantiate his expenses. So while he was allowed to deduct associated expenses, his record keeping was shoddy. Shocking.\n\nBigdeli v. Commissioner, Tax Court Memo 2013-148\n\nAnother variant of the tax home issue for business income is the deduction of business expenses. We have yet another Tax Court case that is eerily similar to the Barrett case above. In this, case the taxpayer was an oral surgeon living in Pennsylvania who traveled 130 miles to New York where he worked at a dentist office.\n\nHis personal home was Pennsylvania and his tax home was New York. His $55,950 in travel expenses for the two years in question were disallowed because a) they were personal non-deductible commuting expenses and b) his work location and subsequent tax home did not meet the temporary work location rules.\n\nWhat if Bigdeli had a home office where he performed administrative functions in addition to his primary work functions outside the home? No dice. See Tax Home article below.\n\nHere’s one more, if you still doubt how this rule works:\n\nMichael E. Brown, et al. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, No. 19-12653 (11th Cir. 2020)\n\nThe Tax Court sustained the disallowance of Brown’s deductions, finding that Pennsauken was his tax home at the time the travel expenses were incurred due to the following factors: His engagement with AFR was indefinite; he worked four days a week in Pennsauken; AFR was his only source of income during the time the travel expenses were incurred; and there was no evidence he had multiple clients at multiple locations. In addition, after the Tax Court concluded that his tax home was in Pennsauken, it found that the travel was primarily motivated by a desire to see his family, with no evidence that the travel had a business purpose.\n\nHere is the full write-up from the Journal of Accountancy.\n\nType “tax home tax court cases” into Google, and you’ll nauseate yourself to sleep.\n\nInsurance\n\nMalpractice insurance is an easy one, so we will move along.\n\nHealth insurance which includes dental and vision is fully deductible even if you cover your spouse and / or children. What is also great about health insurance is that the IRS considers it a fringe benefit for certain shareholders, and it is added to overall officer compensation on an S Corp tax return and therefore deducted. Why is this great? Good question! It reduces the amount of actual salary paid and therefore the amount of Social Security and Medicare taxes.\n\nLet’s say your reasonable officer compensation is $100,000. If you also have $10,000 in health insurance, your actual salary will be $90,000, yet your officer compensation will show $100,000. If you are in the 37% marginal tax bracket, this little health insurance deduction saved you 37% in income taxes plus 15.% in Social Security and Medicare taxes. So, this $10,000 actually costs you $4,800 in cash. Sure, it still stinks, but it has less stink.\n\nDisability insurance\n\nYes, you should have your disability insurance paid by the business. No, it is not an income tax deduction; otherwise the benefits paid would be taxable income. But! It adds to the reasonable salary test like the health insurance example above but only for Social Security and Medicare. Said in another way, you are saving 15.3% in taxes with disability insurance being paid by the business.\n\nMechanically on the business entity tax return (S Corp, for example), wages + health insurance + HSA + disability are considered Officer Compensation on Line 7. This amount magically is also represented in Box 1 of your W-2, and adjusted for pre-tax 401k employee deferrals. Here’s where the non-deduction of disability happens: on your individual tax return (Form 1040), the W-2 income is brought in, but only health insurance and HSA are deducted as an adjustment for adjusted gross income. In other words, disability is deducted on the S Corp tax return, but later picked up as income on the 1040 tax return resulting in a net-zero effect (it’s not taxed nor is it deducted).\n\nThis is in contrast to self-employed health insurance. That is deducted on the S Corp tax return as Officer Compensation, picked up as gross income on the 1040 tax return, and then later deducted on the 1040 tax return as an adjustment to arrive at adjusted gross income (AGI). We call this an “in and out” (like the burger) income comes in as taxable, and then goes out with the deduction. So ultimately, self-employed health insurance is deducted on the S Corp tax return and reduces your K-1 income accordingly. Sure, disability lowers your K-1 income too, but you pick it up as income in wages, hence the net-zero effect as mentioned above.\n\nPhew! That was a lot."
