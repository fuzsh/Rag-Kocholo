        "text": "New addition to keep K1 Speed as the pinnacle of electric kart racing\n\nState-of-the-Art Outdoor Karting Venue\n\nTrack designed by Rocky Moran, Jr. features banked corners, dramatic elevation changes\n\nIrvine, California – Since 2003, K1 Speed has led the innovation and development of indoor electric kart racing, constantly challenging the status quo to ensure a karting experience like no other. And now, K1 Speed will continue to push the envelope for what a karting venue can be with the announcement of K1 Circuit.\n\nTwo years in the making, K1 Circuit marks an exciting departure from the indoor karting experience presently offered in over 40 locations around the world, and will soon be the best outdoor karting venue in the United States.\n\nWhen the doors open, racers will be treated to a mecca of outdoor kart racing. Designed by pro racing driver Rocky Moran, Jr., the 1.1-mi. configurable outdoor track promises banked turns, thrilling elevation changes, all with the foothills of Southern California as the backdrop.\n\nThe main building will be a 14,000-sq. ft. two-story state-of-art structure that features a K1 Race Gear store, a Paddock Lounge café with a beautiful expansive deck overlooking the track, and meeting spaces. Additional structures will serve as garages and storage spaces, while a scoring tower will be installed to display the current running order on track.\n\nThe karts utilized on the track will also differ from those found at K1 Speed. With a longer track and more opportunity for safe run-off territories, an all-new electric pro-kart will safely propel drivers to over 75mph.\n\nOne of K1 Circuit’s main goals is to fully realize the potential of starting motor racing careers from junior racing through to adulthood, and with the introduction of K1 Speed’s inaugural World Championship in addition to several training programs, K1 is sure to continue to groom/promote many extremely talented young racers into the future.\n\n“We’re continuously working hard to evolve our racing experience that has made K1 Speed the pinnacle of electric karting,” says founder and CEO David Danglard. “With our new additions for 2018, we’re incredibly confident that we’ll remain at the forefront of the electric karting industry – which is the future of kart racing.”\n\nMore information about K1 Circuit will be provided, so be sure to look out for our future press releases for these exciting announcements.\n\nABOUT K1 SPEED\n\nFounded in 2003, K1 Speed is the United States’ largest indoor kart racing operator with over 30 centers across the nation that offer a unique upscale entertainment concept for casual consumers, racing enthusiasts and corporate or group events. K1 Speed is the first choice for anyone who wants to experience genuine racing in state-of-the-art European electric karts that are eco-friendly, and safety oriented while providing superior performance to traditional gas karts. Each K1 Speed location is designed as a large entertainment venue with professionally-designed tracks and cutting-edge décor showcasing authentic racing memorabilia along with ample seating and viewing areas, spacious lobbies, meeting rooms and a place to eat and drink.\n\nK1 Speed recently started their International Franchise Program, and has already enjoyed success in South Korea, and several locations in Mexico, with exciting new facilities in Canada, Panama, China, and the United Arab Emirates currently under construction.\n\nCONTACT:"
