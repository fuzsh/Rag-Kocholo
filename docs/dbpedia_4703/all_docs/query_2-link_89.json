        "text": "01 of 19\n\nVisit a Theme Park\n\nAddress\n\n26101 Magic Mountain Pkwy, Valencia, CA 91355, USA\n\nPhone +1 661-255-4100\n\nWeb Visit website\n\nWhile Six Flags Magic Mountain is considered the \"coming of age\" theme park in Los Angeles for its more extreme coasters, it depends on your teen whether or not you'll want to visit.\n\nLA teens also like Knott's Berry Farm's more intimate footprint with a diversity of options for the more and less thrill-seeking types. It's a favorite way to celebrate high school graduation, so it's not just younger teens who appreciate the park's charms.\n\nIf your teen is still a Disney fan, Disneyland, especially Disney's California Adventure, is always fun for teens; remember to leave some time for the night-time dance parties.\n\nHowever, if there's only time or money to visit one theme park while you're in LA, Universal Studios Hollywood might be the top choice. The rides are more virtual than real, but you get the combination of rides associated with movies and TV shows they know, as well as the tram tour that takes you through the working back lot of the TV and movie studio.\n\n02 of 19\n\nTake Your Teen to the Beach\n\nAddress\n\nVenice Beach, Los Angeles, CA, USA\n\nUnless you live near a beach somewhere else in the country, many visitors to LA go straight for the sand. If you're traveling with teens, you can't beat Venice Beach. While there are ocean and sand along all 75 miles of Los Angeles beaches, the Venice Beach Boardwalk has a scene you won't find anywhere else.\n\nThe boardwalk is active all year long, especially on weekends, but it's most crowded in summer. Permanent souvenir shops, head shops, and snack bars line the inland side of the boardwalk, while table vendors, artists, and street performers are set up along the sand.\n\nAlthough the faces of the artists and performers vary, there is a good chance you'll see some of the exact performers you've seen in the background in popular movies and TV shows. At the south end of the strip are the famous Muscle Beach outdoor gym and the concrete skateboard park.\n\nIf that's not enough activity to keep your attention, the people-watching is highly entertaining, too. You can also rent bikes and take a tour of the entire stretch of coastline.\n\n03 of 19\n\nTreat Your Teen to a Surf or SUP Lesson\n\nAddress\n\nMarina Del Rey, CA 90292, USA\n\nOne fun thing to do in Los Angeles if your teen is the active, adventurous type is a surf lesson. Knowing how to swim is a prerequisite, and strong legs and good balance help, but even if you never stand up, learning to surf, and immersing yourself in SoCal beach culture, is a lot of fun.\n\nIt's better to take a lesson rather than just rent a board and try to learn on your own, partially for the coaching, but also to make sure you don't run into territorial issues. The surf instructors in Santa Monica, for instance, know where to take you, so you're not tripping up the professionals.\n\nAnother popular water sport is stand-up paddle boarding (SUP), which is done on calmer water, like the canals in Marina del Rey and Long Beach. It looks effortless when you see people doing it, but it takes every muscle in your body, including some you've probably never used before. Check out SUP with Wade or Pro SUP Shop in Marina del Rey for lessons.\n\nKayaking is another fun way to get out on the water. You can kayak the ocean waves, but for beginners, the inland canals offer a flat-water option. Popular places to rent kayaks include Marina del Rey, Long Beach, Huntington Harbor, and Newport Beach.\n\n04 of 19\n\nAttend a TV Show Taping With Teens 16 or Older\n\nAddress\n\n6840 Hollywood Blvd, Hollywood, CA 90028, USA\n\nPhone +1 323-860-5900\n\nWeb Visit website\n\nIf your teen is 16 or older, attending a TV show taping can be a fun way to introduce them to the exciting world of showbiz that's made Hollywood famous. Be aware; this usually involves a lot of waiting around, so weigh how much time you have available before you plan.\n\nIf your teen has a favorite sitcom, it's worth seeing if it's taping, but even seeing the filming of an unknown pilot during the summer hiatus can be an enjoyable and educational experience for both of you.\n\nThe Jimmy Kimmel Live! show tapes right in Hollywood, so if you're visiting that area, it can be a good one to see, and it tapes more often than sitcoms since it's a daily show. There are usually actors and contemporary bands as guests, and there is an outdoor stage behind the studio where you can see the band perform a more extended set.\n\nContinue to 5 of 19 below.\n\n05 of 19\n\nTake Your Teen on a Movie Studio Tour\n\nAddress\n\n100 Universal City Plaza, Universal City, CA 91608, USA\n\nPhone +1 800-864-8377\n\nWeb Visit website\n\nIf you don't have five or six hours to spend seeing a TV show being taped, a one or two-hour studio tour is another way to get a behind-the-scenes look at the TV and movie industry here—you might even catch a glimpse of a famous actor or two working on the lot!\n\nIf you go to Universal Studios, their tram tour of the back lot is included, or their VIP tour lets you walk around on set. Warner Bros, Paramount, and Sony also offer stand-alone tours.\n\n06 of 19\n\nGo Horseback Riding with Teens\n\nIf you come from a cattle ranch in Wyoming, horseback riding may not be high on your list of things to do in LA. But for beginner riders, and anyone who wants to see a different side of the city, a guided trail ride is a fun way to see the local mountains and the city from higher elevations.\n\nSome trail rides start right in Hollywood and go up behind the Hollywood Sign; others explore the mountains above Malibu, including the Paramount Ranch, or the Palos Verde Peninsula.\n\nA walking trail ride can be a bit of a letdown for experienced riders, but some outfitters let you book a private ride where you can pick up the pace.\n\n07 of 19\n\nTake Your Teens Hiking\n\nAddress\n\n2000 N Fuller Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90046, USA\n\nPhone +1 818-243-1145\n\nWeb Visit website\n\nAnother great way to see a different side of Los Angeles with your teenager is to take a hike through the local canyons and mountains.\n\nWith trails that start in Hollywood, like Runyon Canyon, or trails in Griffith Park to the Hollywood Sign or the Griffith Observatory, a day of hiking is a convenient and great way to get out of the city quickly. If you have a bit more time, you can drive a little farther into the mountains to find trails that are less crowded and offer even more stunning views of the Valley.\n\nBe sure to take sunscreen, water, snacks, and your cell phone with GPS tracking enabled in case you get lost. You'll probably want to set your phone to airplane mode until/unless you need it, since there is no signal in a lot of the canyon and mountain areas; searching for a signal will run down your battery. If you have allergies or asthma, pay attention to the respiratory and allergy air quality reports before heading out.\n\n08 of 19\n\nExplore Chinatown with Your Teen\n\nAddress\n\nChinatown, Los Angeles, CA 90012, USA\n\nAlthough less impressive than its San Francisco, New York, and Boston counterparts, Chinatown in Los Angeles is a great place to take your teenager, especially if they've never visited China but are interested in its culture and people.\n\nOne of the most important annual celebrations on the lunar calendar is Chinese New Year. and Chinatown comes alive on the days leading up to it, with a parade and festival celebrating Chinese culture.\n\nThe center of Chinatown is located primarily along Broadway and Hill Street, north of Cesar Chavez Avenue in Downtown Los Angeles. Other downtown Los Angeles attractions nearby include Union Station and El Pueblo de Los Angeles at Olvera Street, the Music Center, Grand Park and the LA Civic Center, and LA Live Sports and Entertainment Complex.\n\nContinue to 9 of 19 below.\n\n09 of 19\n\nTake Your Teens to a Skate Park\n\nAddress\n\n1800 Ocean Front Walk, Venice, CA 90291, USA\n\nPhone +1 310-399-2775\n\nOne of the most famous skateboard parks in LA is the one at Venice Beach, but there are many others. Skateboarding is even more native to many Southern Californians than surfing, with a much more accessible price point and opportunities to skate all over town.\n\nIf you didn't grow up on a skateboard, lessons are available, but it's also fun to hang out and watch the tricks. In addition to Venice Beach, other easily accessible parks include the Cove Skatepark in Santa Monica; Stoner Skate Plaza a bit further toward downtown; Hermosa Skate Beach in Redondo Park; William Nickerson Gardens Skate Park in Lynwood; and the Michael K. Green Skate Park in Long Beach.\n\nMost of these facilities rent gear, but if you have your own roller skates or boards, feel free to bring those and save some money.\n\n10 of 19\n\nTake Your Teens to a Concert\n\nAddress\n\n2301 Highland Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90068, USA\n\nPhone +1 323-850-2000\n\nWeb Visit website\n\nMost teens are into music to some extent, and LA has an abundance of opportunities to see bands and DJs perform live. The Hollywood Bowl and the Greek Theatre in LA, as well as the Pacific Amphitheatre in Orange County are fun outdoor venues for big-name concerts.\n\nFor indoor shows in LA, check events at the Staples Center, the Peacock Theater, Kia Forum, the Honda Center, and many smaller venues.\n\nThere are also many combination restaurants and bars like House of Blues in Anaheim that host local and touring bands and have events that are not limited to people 21 and over. Some clubs and concert venues like the Echoplex or Avalon also host events for 16- to 18-year-olds, but you should check the age minimum for each performance before buying tickets.\n\n11 of 19\n\nVisiting One of L.A.'s 200+ Museums\n\nAddress\n\n2800 E Observatory Rd, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA\n\nPhone +1 213-473-0800\n\nWeb Visit website\n\nLos Angeles is home to more than 250 museums, so even if your teen isn't remotely interested in most exhibits, you can probably find one to spark their interest, if you know where to look.\n\nMany teen visitors and residents recommend going to the Griffith Observatory, a great place for seeing stars; the California Science Center, with lots of opportunities for hands-on experiments including riding a bike on a high wire; the Natural History Museum; and the LA County Museum of Art.\n\nIf those sound too academic for your teenager, you could go for the Hollywood Museum, Ripley's Believe it or Not, or take your goth teen to the Museum of Death in Hollywood, one of LA's most unusual museums. There are also museums for fans of cars, planes, ships,​ and trains.\n\n12 of 19\n\nGo Shopping at the Grove\n\nAddress\n\n189 The Grove Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90036, USA\n\nPhone +1 323-900-8080\n\nWeb Visit website\n\nRegarding price, Los Angeles shopping isn't really any more expensive than shopping at home for most tourists, so don't let that misconception deter you from knocking out some school shopping with your teenager while spending the day enjoying each other's company.\n\nOne of the most popular shopping destinations for teenagers is The Grove, which offers a variety of shops ranging from accessible. There's also a trolley car that runs along a track to the neighboring LA Farmer's Market, both of which are popular spots for celebrity sightings!\n\nThe Vacation Gals recommend the Beverly Center as a cool place to shop or just browse, and another teen-favored retail stretch with an entirely different vibe is Melrose Avenue through Hollywood.\n\nIf your teen is into a period look, there are cool vintage shops on Melrose and throughout the city. You can find a bunch of vintage clothes and furnishings in one spot on Retro Row on 4th Street in Long Beach, or at the monthly Rose Bowl Flea Market on the 2nd Sunday of the month, or the Long Beach Antiques and Collectibles Market on the 3rd Sunday of the month.\n\nFor the true shopaholic, fashion-forward teen, the 100-block stretch of the Fashion District offers trend-leading looks as well as hundreds of options for finding that perfect prom outfit.\n\nContinue to 13 of 19 below.\n\n13 of 19\n\nTake Your Teen to a Sporting Event\n\nAddress\n\n1000 Vin Scully Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90012, USA\n\nPhone +1 866-363-4377\n\nWeb Visit website\n\nLos Angeles residents, for the most part, are quite proud of their professional sports teams and venues, and celebrities aren't the only ones who take their teens to LA sporting events.\n\nYou might not have such prime seats in your budget, but depending on where in the season Los Angeles teams are, you can usually find affordable seats to see the Dodgers or the Angels play baseball, the Lakers or the Clippers play basketball, the Kings play hockey, or the Galaxy team play soccer.\n\nFor something a little more out of the ordinary, you can take in a roller derby game with the LA Derby Dolls or other local leagues.\n\n14 of 19\n\nExperience a Special Thrill\n\nAddress\n\n1000 Universal Studios Blvd #1, Universal City, CA 91608, USA\n\nPhone +1 818-985-4359\n\nWeb Visit website\n\nAlthough Los Angeles is packed full of amusement parks, there are many other thrills to experience in this massive city—from simulated sky-diving to standing above the city on a glass floor.\n\nIt's not an all-day activity, but if you're in the vicinity of Universal Studios, a stop at iFly Hollywood on Universal CityWalk could give you and your teen a thrill. It's a chance to float on air as if you're skydiving in a big Plexiglas tube, which is a real blast at any age.\n\n15 of 19\n\nChallenge Your Teen to Kart Racing in LA\n\nAddress\n\n21830 Recreation Rd, Carson, CA 90745-2381, USA\n\nPhone +1 310-834-3700\n\nWeb Visit website\n\nTeens can have fun practicing their driving skills out of traffic at any of the many indoor and outdoor kart racing facilities in Los Angeles, and there are options available for drivers ranging in age from toddlers to adults (Go Kart World in Carson accepts as small as 32\" tall).\n\nIndoor kart racing uses electric vehicles with up to 10 karts per race and can be a great way to entertain teenagers, especially those who aren't yet able to drive legally.\n\nLit'l Indy, K1 Speed, SpeedZone Los Angeles, and Two Wild Karting are all great places to go if your teenager has the need for speed.\n\n16 of 19\n\nVisit Bottega Louie\n\nAddress\n\n700 S Grand Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90017-3813, USA\n\nPhone +1 213-802-1470\n\nWeb Visit website\n\nFoodies and hungry teenagers alike will enjoy eating—or at least going for dessert—at Bottega Louie in Downtown Los Angeles.\n\nThis fancy-casual marble-floored Italian restaurant, Italian and French bakery, and gourmet market has been on all kinds of lists for best restaurant, best pizza, best brunch, best atmosphere, and best restaurant with free Wi-Fi, so it's no wonder it's a popular spot for foodies of all ages.\n\nThe dessert displays and rainbow macarons are a work of art, and it's fun to sit where you can watch the staff at work in the open kitchen. You don't have to spend a fortune here, but you'll want to.\n\nContinue to 17 of 19 below.\n\n17 of 19\n\nTake in the Local Scene at Santa Monica Pier\n\nAddress\n\n200 Santa Monica Pier, Santa Monica, CA 90401, USA\n\nPhone +1 310-458-8900\n\nWeb Visit website\n\nSanta Monica Pier, home of Pacific Park amusement park, is another popular destination for younger teens—but also offers the older crowd a few great options.\n\nTake in a movie-scene-style view of the city from atop the Ferris wheel at Pacific Park or let your younger teenager ride one of the classic amusement park rides on the pier. The food's not healthy and not cheap, but if you and your teens are in the mood for some typical fair-style fast food, this is a great place to grab lunch.\n\nBe sure to check out the 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica, because many musicians and celebrities just getting their start hang out here. There are also several interesting and unique locally-owned shops here, which is another great opportunity to shop for some one-of-a-kind (yet still affordable) clothes for school.\n\n18 of 19\n\nGo Star-Hunting in Hollywood\n\nLos Angeles isn't just the City of Angels; it's also a city of celebrities who work in Hollywood (and the surrounding California towns while on location) filming blockbuster movies year after year. If your teenagers are celebrity-obsessed, consider taking them on a quest for a celebrity sighting, but remember to be polite and respectful—celebrities are people, too.\n\nOne of the best ways to catch a glimpse of a celebrity—other than hitting up celebrity hotspots mentioned earlier in this list—is to take a bus tour of celebrities' favorite Los Angeles neighborhoods. The Hollywood celebrity homes tour, for example (typically around $44), is a 14-person narrated bus ride through the celebrity mansions in the Hollywood Hills with a stop at the Hollywood Bowl, where you can take pictures of the Hollywood sign.\n\nAlternatively, you could visit the famous Hollywood Walk of Fame, where celebrities who have \"made it\" in Hollywood (and in general in pop culture) are awarded stars on the sidewalk to commemorate their success. Be sure to snap a few pictures of your teens standing on the Hollywood stars of their favorite celebrities!\n\n19 of 19\n\nGo See the Animals\n\nAddress\n\n5333 Zoo Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA\n\nPhone +1 323-644-4200\n\nWeb Visit website\n\nFor teenagers who love animals, especially exotic and aquatic ones, there are two all-star destinations you can visit in Los Angeles: the Los Angeles Zoo and the Aquarium of the Pacific.\n\nThe Los Angeles Zoo is located near Griffith Park and its 133 acres house over 270 species ranging from giraffes to the rare mountain tapir. Founded in 1966, the Zoo has been a staple of Los Angeles for years and has undergone many significant renovations due to a spate of animal escapes in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\nLocated in Rainbow Harbor in Long Beach, the Aquarium of the Pacific features the famous \"Blue Cavern\" exhibit, a giant glass wall that's been the background of many romantic movie scenes throughout the years. If your teenage child is into marine biology and aquatic life, he or she might enjoy the optional \"behind-the-scenes\" tour, which guides visitors through what it takes to operate and conserve the marine life held in captivity."
