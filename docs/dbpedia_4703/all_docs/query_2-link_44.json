        "text": "For Immediate Release:\n\nDUBLIN, CA (February 25, 2020) – Arthur Renowitzky is a paraplegic due to a spinal cord injury. He filed a federal lawsuit against K1 Speed after he discovered there were no hand-controlled Karts at the K1 Speed’s Dublin location. K1 Speed immediately agreed that hand-controlled go-karts were a viable option to provide accessibility to riders with disabilities. K1 Speed voluntarily agreed to investigate whether the implementation of these karts was feasible. The Parties’ joint resolution of this case has resulted in a commitment by K1 to provide accessible hand-controlled Karts at all K1 Speed locations in California within six months, and all K1’s locations nationwide within twelve months.\n\nPlaintiff Arthur Renowitzky said of the resolution, “I am happy we were able to bring accessible Karts to people living with disabilities here in California and throughout the Unites States. I am thankful to K1 for being so cooperative after this was brought to their attention. Hopefully more businesses will do the right thing like K1 to create access needed for those living with disabilities.”\n\nIn addition to the accessible Karts, Mr. Renowitzky, who is Founder of the Life Goes On Foundation, which brings awareness and support to persons with spinal cord injuries, will host a fundraiser for the Foundation on February 27, 2020 at K1 Speed, Dublin from 7:00 – 10:00 pm. Mr. Renowitzky invites supporters of the Life Goes On Foundation to join him for the event. Mr. Renowitzky is also a professional wheelchair basketball player for the Golden State Road Warriors Basketball Team and invites their players and fans to attend the event.\n\nMr. Renowitzky and K1 both invite able-bodied and disabled members of the public to try out the new hand-controlled Kart. Mr. Renowitzky and K1 Speed are proud that they were able to work cooperatively to resolve the dispute and provide an inclusive and accessible racing experience to the disabled community throughout California and the United States. Mr. Renowitzky was represented by Aaron Clefton of REIN & CLEFTON, Attorneys at Law.
