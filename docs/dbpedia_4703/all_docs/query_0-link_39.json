        "text": "DAYTONA BEACH — No, it’s not NASCAR, but there’s still an impressive high-pitched wall of sound when a field of 10 state-of-the-art go-karts tear around the curves at nearly 45 mph at the newly opened K1 Speed Indoor Go-Kart Racing Daytona Beach in Volusia Square mall.\n\nK1 Speed, a California-based company that operates more than 70 go-kart tracks in the United States and seven countries globally, recently took over the operation of Speedway Indoor Karting, the previous track that had been operating in the former Toys R Us space at Volusia Square.\n\nAhead of a soft opening in early May, the company invested in nearly 50 new adult and junior-sized go-karts, a fleet of Italian-made Superleggero electric vehicles that can reach speeds of 45 mph for adults, 20 mph for operation by children at least 48 inches tall.\n\nWork also has begun on a new Paddock Lounge café that will offer pizzas, nachos and other snack foods, as well as beverages that include beer and wine, said Amy Borges, the attraction’s manager. The center also features a private event room for hosting birthdays, corporate events and other occasions.\n\nThe Paddock Lounge is expected to be open by year’s end, said Borges, who also worked in various roles for Speedway Indoor Karting. That attraction spent 2-1/2 years at the Volusia Square, a mostly empty shopping plaza at 2455 International Speedway Blvd., just west of Williamson Blvd.\n\nFrom 2022: Daytona's Volusia Square lands new tenants. Here's who's coming to the ISB shopping center\n\nK1 Speed optimistic about go-karting future in Daytona Beach\n\nBorges is optimistic that K1 Speed will be able to build on a growth wave of development in the area.\n\n“A lot of things are looking up in Daytona Beach,” she said, “and we hope to be a part of that.”\n\nSpeedway Indoor Karting’s Daytona Beach operation was the second track opened by the Indiana-based company owned by ex-IndyCar driver and team owner Sarah Fisher and her husband Andy O’Gara.\n\nSIK will remain the landlord of the Volusia Square space, but the company decided to close its Daytona Beach operation to focus on its original track that opened in 2016 in Speedway, Ind., said Ryan Jurnecka, K1 Speed spokesman.\n\n“We’re leasing it directly from them,” Jurnecka said. “We’ve got a great relationship with SIK and simply took over this location from them since the long distance from their headquarters in Indiana made it harder for them to operate and manage it.”\n\nK1 Speed Daytona Beach is the first of two new centers coming to Florida, with a West Palm Beach center slated to open later this summer. That will increase the company's Florida presence to five locations that also include Hollywood, Medley (near Miami) and Orlando, Jurnecka said.\n\nThe Daytona Beach center is the company’s first with a two-level track in Florida, he said.\n\nK1 Speed hopes that the center’s proximity to Daytona International Speedway, less than ½-mile east on ISB, will capitalize on the interest of NASCAR fans, Jurnecka said.\n\n'You really get that adrenalin rush'\n\nThat potential connection was evident when twentysomething friends Jay Miller and Taylor Urdiales of Clinton, South Carolina, finished first and second atop the computer-timed leader board for a recent afternoon race.\n\n“This is probably one of the best things to have right next to a speedway,” said Miller, a big NASCAR fan. “You really get that adrenalin rush.”\n\nMore: Daytona KartWeek: Unlimited All-Stars are go-karts that go like race cars\n\nNearby, Richard Gummer, 65, of Daytona Beach Shores was wiping sweat from his brow and comparing race times with his 13-year-old grandson, Evan Sentz, of Ocala.\n\n\"I’ve been a race fan all my life, ever since I was a kid,” Gummer said. “I’ve been to races at Daytona many times, done the Richard Petty (Driving) Experience in California. This is fantastic; to bring my 13-year-old grandson to do this together.”\n\nCost for 12-lap races is $25.95 for one race; $46.95 for two races; $59.95 for three races. That doesn’t include a $7.95 annual membership fee also required to race. There’s also a Speedpass option that includes two races, a T-shirt and membership for $64.95.\n\nK1 Speed also offers monthly league races in three divisions: Junior (ages 13 and under, 48-inch height minimum); Teen (ages 14-17, 58-inch height minimum); and Adult (age 18 and over, 58-inch height minimum). Top 3 finishers in each division advance to the company’s state, national and world competitions, the latter including drivers from Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, France, Korea and China.\n\nThe center also will be offering an assortment of weekly events that include a “Buy 2, Get 1 Free” offer on Tuesdays; a “Fast Thursday” promotion that offers two free races for the driver with the fastest time; and a Friday “Glow Night” in which overhead lights are turned down to create a Rolex 24-worthy nighttime driving experience.\n\n“We sell fun here,” Borges said, “and there’s already been a lot of positive response.”\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: K1 Speed Daytona Beach, go-kart center\n\nWhere: 2455 International Speedway Blvd., Daytona Beach (in Volusia Square mall)\n\nHours: noon-10 p.m. Monday-Thursday; noon-midnight Friday; 10 a.m.-midnight Saturday; 10 a.m.-10 p.m. Sunday\n\nCost: $25.95 for one race; $46.95 for two races; $59.95 for three races.
