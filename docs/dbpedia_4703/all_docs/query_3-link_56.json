        "text": "Say What!\n\n“Rico was doing a good job as the leader, Carson got rolling there for a minute, and I didn’t think I was going to get by him. I didn’t really know exactly what to do. Rico got to a lapper. He couldn’t follow him and had to go top or middle. That car hit the berm in front of me. That gave me a bunch of clean air and probably messed him up. We were in the right place at the right time, but you always have to execute every lap. The car felt great during the feature. The car felt better and better as that slime got thrown off the bottom.” Kyle Larson winning night 2 of the Knoxville Nationals\n\n“I don’t even know what to say. I’ve never won a prelim night. I’ve run second. This definitely sets us up good for Saturday, Living just outside Des Moines now in Grimes, this is kind of a home for me. The first time I came here in I think 2016 or 2017 I got to work for Aaron Reutzel. And you know, Danny Lasoski being my idol was one that was obviously super successful here. And I think sometimes when you really put your mind to something at a place you want to be successful at, it makes you work harder to really do that. It’s the best racetrack in the world. Best fans in the world. There’s no question. Best racing surface you get all year long. Whether the track is a little bit wetter like it was tonight or it’s super dry, you almost have three lines of racing every time you come here. My guys did an incredible job. Hats off to Adam (Clark), Bob (Curtis), and Aaron (Beiler).” Gio Scelzi winning night 1 of the Knoxville Nationals\n\n“That’s what we’ve been working for all year,I’m just really happy for my team. They really put their heads down and work on these things. It’s a special place to be up here on the front stretch. We’ve made it a point to come here a few times this season. Those 25-lap features, when they go non-stop, they can get quite grueling mentally. You get excited catching lapped traffic, because you know that’s where you can get a torrid pace. I know what (Cappy) brought to Knoxville, the history, and it’s important this event continues and the fans support this the week before Nationals.” Rico Abreu winning the Capitani Clasic at Knoxville Raceway"
