        "text": "K1 Speed has built its reputation on indoor karting though, and like other K1 Speed locations, Torrance will feature a professionally-designed indoor go kart track that features both long straights and hairpin turns. While customers are waiting to race, they can relax in the spacious lobby which has comfortable seating, club-like lighting, and large projection screen and plasma televisions. Racers can also take advantage of the on-site video arcades or grab a snack at the Pit Caf√©. Official racing memorabilia is also be on display, including racing suits, helmets and even authentic race cars.\n\nTo enhance the racing experience, K1 Speed utilizes a live telemetry system that allows new racers to compare their performance statistics against the more than 650,000 racers who have previously raced at other K1 Speed locations.\n\nWhat truly sets K1 Speed apart from the competition though is their use of fully electric karts, making K1 Speed the eco-friendly choice for indoor entertainment. \"Our European race karts perform solely on electricity, eliminating the toxic emissions produced by gas-powered karts,\" says Susan Graver, Co-owner and Marketing Director for K1 Speed. This commitment to low-impact technologies goes beyond the karts though; all of their indoor racetracks are equipped with energy efficient lighting and corporate headquarters is working to implement more sustainable business practices.\n\nK1 Speed Torrance is located 15 minutes from Beverly Hills and five minutes from the beach cities of Los Angeles. The location is within close proximity of the 405 freeway and many corporate offices.\n\nFor more information, visit www.K1Speed.com."
