        "text": "If you’re looking for things to do tonight in Orange County with thrills and excitement, you’re in the right place! At K1 Speed Irvine, the public can enjoy indoor go-kart racing on not one, but two professionally designed tracks. Our Irvine karting location is one of our largest and is a fantastic place to spend a Friday evening with friends or Sunday afternoon with family. Our aim is not limited to building just go-kart tracks; we want to design world-class entertainment venues that everyone can feel comfortable in. Traditional outdoor tracks are often unkempt, there are tires everywhere, the awnings are falling apart, and they smell of gasoline. At K1 Speed, we have plasma screen televisions and leather couches, museum-quality collections of racing memorabilia and art, and our own Paddock Lounge that serves food and beverages for all ages. We can assure you that K1 Speed will redefine what you think of go-kart tracks, and you will never go back!\n\nIf you want to experience indoor go-kart racing, the Arrive & Drive package offered at K1 Speed Irvine location is for you! We invite you to come in today; K1 Speed is definitely a fun thing to do near South Coast Plaza, the District, Irvine Spectrum, UC Irvine (UCI), Diamond Jamboree, John Wayne Airport, Mission Viejo, Costa Mesa, Tustin and Santa Ana.\n\nOne of the best indoor go kart tracks in Southern California!\n\nOur locations are open to the public every day of the year, with the exception of private closures. Anyone who meets our height requirements (please inquire) and is able to safely operate our electric go-karts can race at K1 Speed. If you’re looking for an adrenaline rush or would like to challenge your friends to some wheel-to-wheel action to see who’s fastest, we are confident that you will not be disappointed in what we have to offer! Our kart tracks are professionally designed and our electric karts deliver superb performance. Capable of speeds approaching 45mph, and with driving position mere inches off of the ground, driving our karts is as close as you can get to racing a Formula One car without an FIA license! And yet, with remote shutoff capabilities and available power modulation based on the driver, our karts are equally suited to amateurs and veteran enthusiasts alike.\n\nAn Arrive & Drive race consists of a timed event against the clock, with up to 11 other drivers. Racing against the clock in equal machinery puts everyone on equal footing, which means that winning the race will require talent and consistency, and not simply blind luck and defensive driving. Setting a fast lap may involve mirroring the driver in front of you to analyze his or her racing lines, or finding an open spot on the track so that you can concentrate without interference from other drivers. Whichever strategy works for you, our on-board data analyzers don’t lie and you’ll be able to track in real time how well you are faring against the competition! Indoor go-kart racing at our Irvine locations is a genuine thrill and don’t be surprised if you find yourself opting for our three-race pack after your first race is complete!"
