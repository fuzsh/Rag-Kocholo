        "text": "Although Disneyland Resort is Anaheim’s main claim to fame, the city’s other impressive family attractions will also help round out your itinerary to maximize family fun. I grew up near here and still return often. The best things to do in Anaheim with kids include theme parks and opportunities for education, exercise, and great food while exploring nearby cities (such as glorious Orange County) that the whole family will enjoy.\n\nFrom Adventure City to indoor water park Great Wolf Lodge to the Pearson Park amphitheatre and Anaheim packing district, read on to find out why Anaheim with kids extends beyond the Walt Disney empire!\n\nWe can help you save on tickets, tours, and hotels. If you purchase through some of the links below, we may be compensated. Thank you for supporting our small business! Our editorial guidelines.\n\nThings to Do in Anaheim with Kids\n\nAnaheim offers a diverse selection of attractions, so you’re bound to find something that will please every member of the family in and around the city. Of course, this list starts with the most famous of Anaheim amusement parks.\n\nDisneyland Park\n\nDisneyland Park is responsible for most tourists who visit Anaheim (and Southern CA), so it deserves a spot at the top of our list.\n\nThe beloved theme park opened in 1955 under the direction of Walt Disney, and while much has stayed the same, the addition of Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge skyrocketed attendance at “The Happiest Place on Earth” over the last few years.\n\nRest assured that long-time favorite Disneyland rides such as Pirates of the Caribbean, Space Mountain, and Dumbo still make up the over 90 rides and attractions. In 2023, ToonTown underwent a major refurbishment and added the new Mickey and Minne’s Runaway Railway ride. Summer 2024 will see Splash Mountain transformed into Tiana’s Bayou Adventure.\n\nIt was a privilege to grow up with this park on my doorstep. It’s just as fun to visit now as an adult. We like to return as much as we can.\n\nDon’t forget that it’s easy to save with a Disneyland tickets discount!\n\nDisney California Adventure Park\n\nDisney California Adventure first opened in 2001 on the original Disneyland Park parking lot site. This means it’s easy to bounce between the two Disney parks as they are just across each other (you might want to consider Park Hopper tickets, which you can also buy at a discount).\n\nToddlers and younger kids love Cars Land. In fact, Radiator Springs Racers here is one of the best, all-time favorite Disney rides (and we’ve been to all Disney Resorts worldwide) that the entire family enjoys Older kids head to the thrill rides like the extreme (to me) drops in Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout! or the Incredicoaster for its inversion. Avenger’s Campus and Web Slingers: A Spiderman Adventure is also popular and family-friendly.\n\n(The Downtown Disney entertainment area is between the parks and the Disneyland hotels, which you can stop into without a park ticket.)\n\nAdventure City\n\nIf you’re looking for a smaller theme park, take the kids to Adventure City, one of Anaheim’s best-kept secrets. The cost of admission for a family of four is less than the price of a 1-Day Disneyland ticket plus parking is free!\n\nThe 17 rides at Adventure City amusement park include two roller coasters, a petting farm, and interactive dance parties at stage 39. When you’re ready to relax and rest your feet, hop on the Adventure City Express Train to take a sightseeing trip around the entire park.\n\nAnaheim Garden Walk\n\nAcross the street from Disneyland, Anaheim Garden Walk is the perfect place for the whole family to relax and unwind after a long day at the theme parks.\n\nThis one-stop-shop has everything from restaurants and shopping galore to murals and art installations. Do the kids still have steam left? Anaheim’s ultimate family playground (second to the famous amusement park, of course) offers an escape room, movie theaters, bowling, a flight deck simulator, and an indoor playpark Billy Beez.\n\nAngel Stadium\n\nIf you love a good game of baseball, make sure the family-friendly and energized atmosphere of Angel Stadium is on your list of things to do in Anaheim with kids during the season. The atmosphere in the stadium is friendly and energized.\n\nConcessions are part of the fun, and the famed Helmet Nachos, which come in a life-size plastic Los Angeles Angels helmet and double as a keepsake, are a must-have. Table service dining is also available, as are plenty of Major League Baseball souvenirs.\n\nFlightdeck Flight Simulation Center\n\nThe Flightdeck Flight Simulation Center is a unique family experience where aspiring race car drivers or pilots (older kids 10 and up) can participate in races or take flights ranging from 30 minutes to 120 minutes.\n\nThough the experiences are all simulated, they feel real and do not require prior experience. You’ll receive classroom training and instruction to prepare for this one-of-a-kind experience that your family will never forget.\n\nFlightdeck Flight Simulation Center isn’t open all day, but it’s the perfect activity to enjoy in the afternoon or evening after a fun morning at Disneyland.\n\nSky Zone Indoor Trampoline Park\n\nIf you’re looking for ways to help the kids release their excess energy, head to Sky Zone Indoor Trampoline Park. It features a number of activities to test strength and agility, an ultimate dodgeball court, and a freestyle jump area.\n\nA free-climb bouldering wall that extends above a foam pit helps hone free climbing skills without fear.\n\nFor children aged 6 and under, Little Leapers is an exclusive time for younger kids to play together in a safe and engaging environment.\n\nBowlero\n\nBowlero features 41 bowling lanes, a sports bar, an arcade area, and a billiards/pool area. The hip bowling lanes feature black lights and have large HD video walls that show everything from music videos to live sports.\n\nBirthday celebrations and group gatherings are made easy at Bowlero. With customizable party menus, free Wi-Fi, wheelchair accessibility, and private lanes.\n\nseascape\n\nThis indoor 3-story play arena is perfect for kids to burn off some energy. From shooting foam balls from air guns to slides and an obstacle course, the kids are sure to have a blast. Although their main focus is private parties, they do have open play sessions where anyone is welcome to come and play. Check their website for available dates.\n\nYorba Regional Park\n\nWhen the family is ready to escape from the bustling city, just a short drive away, beckons Yorba Regional park. This gorgeous park provides so much fun for when the kids want a playground to climb on or walk along the Santa Ana river trail.\n\nA lake in the middle of the park offers paddle boat rentals or choose to stay on land with a surrey or bike rental. Either way, take a breather on your visit to Anaheim with kids at this urban oasis.\n\nGreat Wolf Lodge Day Pass\n\nReady for some pool time? A day pass to Great Wolf Lodge lets the family enjoy this indoor water park for the day (or even half a day), which is normally reserved for overnight guests only.\n\nWith temperatures maintained at a balmy 84 degrees, the water parks of Great Wolf Lodge are an especially great idea in inclement weather when you visit Anaheim with kids. Life jackets are included, and kids ages 2 and under are free.\n\nCamelot Golfland\n\nDon’t come here just for mini golf because Camelot Golfland is one of the most fun things to do in Anaheim with kids. It’s more than mini golf.\n\nAn arcade, laser tag, Fast Car raceway (valid driver’s license is required, and size restrictions apply), bumper cars, bumper boats, and a pizza parlor (because you’ll be here all day) — it’s all here.\n\nAnaheim ICE\n\nWho says you can’t enjoy winter activities in Anaheim? If you’re dying to escape the heat, a few hours at Anaheim ICE will cool you down. Go to a hockey game, take skating lessons, join a public skate session, or celebrate a birthday.\n\nThere’s also an Ultimate Skate & Hockey Pro Shop where you can purchase figure skating apparel and souvenirs. If you’re looking for an NHL game during the season, check out Honda Center to catch an Anaheim Ducks game.\n\nTHE ADVENTURE LAGOON\n\nOpen April through October, another hot day activity for kids in Anaheim is the water park at Adventure Lagoon.\n\nAdventurous kids will navigate and slide down inflatable obstacle courses while trying to avoid a wipeout while young kids play in an area designated especially for littles. Rent a beach chair on their “beach” while the kids splash away at the water parks.\n\nK1 Speed\n\nDo your kids feel the need for speed? K1 Speed is a favorite Anaheim kids’ activity. The venue features electric go-karts for drivers of all skill levels. The popular Arrive & Drive race option allows drivers to race against up to 11 other racers at a time.\n\nHowever, instead of racing for position, drivers race against the clock, where skill, consistency, and strategy are rewarded. Live telemetry allows you to monitor your performance on the track and make adjustments as necessary.\n\nCross Roads Escape Games\n\nDiscover what all the escape room fuss is about at Cross Roads Escape Games. You’ll work as a team to solve puzzles, find clues, and ultimately escape the room you’re trapped in.\n\nIt’s currently rated the third best escape room in the nation by USA Today and #1 in Southern California.\n\nCenter Street Promenade\n\nIf you’re planning to buy gifts and souvenirs, stop by the Center Street Promenade in the revitalized center of Anaheim.\n\nYou’ll find everything from artisanal jewelry to sustainable housewares in the boutiques, the local farmers’ market, and unique eateries.\n\nSwingIt Trapeze Lessons\n\nSwingIt Trapeze teaches everything from acrobatic lessons to circus classes. You can learn to swing on a trapeze here, whether you’re naturally athletic or have two left feet. Even those who enter with little knowledge of acrobatics leave knowing how to pull off stunts that most people only dream of performing.\n\nSafety is a top priority at SwingIt Trapeze Lessons, and the operators work hard to ensure you have fun in a safe environment.\n\nAnaheim Packing District\n\nThe Anaheim Packing District is a shopping area comprised of restored historic buildings. A highlight is the Anaheim Packing House gourmet food hall, which has lots of Instagram-worthy desserts and great places to eat.\n\nThe pre-prohibition Anaheim Brewery is located in the Packard House, which makes this spot a win-win for parents and kids\n\nPearson Park Amphitheatre\n\nBuilt in 1927, the charming Pearson Park Amphitheatre is a great place to go for your family’s nighttime entertainment.\n\nSurprisingly, the concert venue has the capacity to accommodate over 2,000 seated guests. Check out the amphitheater’s website to reserve tickets for upcoming shows, such as live dance performances, balloon shows, and live music.\n\nOAK CANYON NATURE CENTER\n\nNature lovers will love the 58-acre nature park, Oak Canyon. Meander through the canyon’s hiking trails and oak woodland on your own, or join a naturalist-led hike while keeping your eyes peeled for the Goldspotted Oak beetle and coastal sage scrub.\n\nDon’t miss the John J. Collier Interpretive Center (check for hours as it’s not open daily), which is a small museum with regional natural history exhibits.\n\nThings to Do Near Anaheim with Kids\n\nIt’s also worth exploring fun activities around Anaheim in Greater Orange County. Whether you’re looking for pure entertainment, education, or both, here are some of the top things to do near Anaheim with kids.\n\nMedieval Times\n\nBuena Park, California, is home to the epic Medieval Times restaurant and entertainment venue. If anyone in your family likes dressing up or watching movies about medieval knights, they’ll fall in love with this place.\n\nWhile you enjoy a four-course medieval-style meal (without utensils), you’ll be treated to a live show that’s full of action and adventure. Knights compete and test their skills while you cheer them on. You’ll see everything from jousting to falconry. Get discount tickets.\n\nKnott’s Berry Farm\n\nKnott’s Berry Farm, America’s first theme park, is also located in Buena Park. The once-working berry farm has since been transformed into a theme park paradise.\n\nWe love Knott’s because it offers a wide variety of rides and attractions, from scary to mild, so there’s something for everyone—whether you’re an adult, young child, or teenager.\n\nPopular Knott’s Berry Farm rides include several thrilling roller coasters—don’t miss California’s first (and steepest) dive roller coaster, Hang Time, the Xcelerator roller coaster, the Calico Mine train ride, and the Timber Mountain Log Ride.\n\nIt’s also known for GhostRider, the West Coast’s tallest and longest wooden roller coaster. Don’t forget that you can also buy Knott’s Berry Farm discount tickets (we have a secret discount).\n\nIrvine Regional Park\n\nLet Irvine Regional Park’s rolling foothills and Sycamore tree groves serve as your backdrop for a leisurely family day.\n\nRent bikes or aquabikes for the kids by the boathouse, hop on the train for a short journey, take on a pony ride, and make sure to stop by the OC Zoo in the middle of the park to complete the day.\n\nPirate’s Dinner Adventure\n\nEyepatches and wood peg legs are encouraged at Buena Park’s other themed dining experience, Pirate’s Dinner Adventure.\n\nDivided into teams to involve audience participation, your family will cheer on your pirate in daring tasks and friendly competition.\n\nAcrobatics, swordplay, and stunts are all on the menu, in addition to a full dinner—the hardest part will be getting the kids to pay attention to eat with all the spectacles going on! Get discounted tickets.\n\nDiscovery Cube Orange County\n\nDiscovery Cube Orange County in Santa Ana is a next-level science center and museum. Over 100 hands-on interactive exhibits encourage kids to dabble in STEM by exploring physics with kid-built cars or investigating aerodynamics in a wind tunnel.\n\nKids can also test reactionary times against pro hockey goalkeepers or experience hurricane wind gale forces. Our family loved our time here and gave it two thumbs up after Disneyland!\n\nThe children’s museum la habra\n\nLocated about 10 miles outside Anaheim, the La Habra Children’s Museum has plenty of hands-on activities and interactive learning. The 7 galleries are best suited for kids 10 and under, including animals, a model train village, and a pretend farm.\n\nSteelcraft\n\nBuilt with repurposed shipping containers, SteelCraft Garden Grove aims to unite the community through local craft food and drink vendors, live music, and other Orange County neighborhood events.\n\nIts large, open-space communal dining area is family-friendly, with space for kids to swing and play ping pong while waiting for food. Our favorites included the Mexican x Asian fusion barrio ramen, made-to-order Duck donuts, and washing it all down with boba milk tea (other options include craft beer, wine, and cocktails).\n\nDave & Busters\n\nIf you’d like to catch a sporting event (such as an Anaheim Ducks game) while the kids play arcade games, Dave and Busters is about 10 minutes away from Disneyland. There’s also a robust food menu and a variety of adult drinks. Pick up a rewards card and keep it with you so you can start earning rewards while you play, eat, or drink.\n\nOrange County Beaches\n\nWithout traffic, getting from Anaheim to the beach takes about 30 minutes by car. You have several beaches to choose from. For a stereotypical Southern California beach day, I prefer my hometown beach of Huntington Beach. The sandy area is enormous. You can get cheese strips (a local favorite from Jack’s), boogie board, ride bikes, and then some.\n\nLaguna Beach is another popular choice for a gorgeous beach with a small-town feel. It’s an artist community, so there are also galleries and boutiques to browse.\n\nWhere to Stay in Anaheim with Kids\n\nThe good news is that most Anaheim hotels were built with families in mind. The tough part is narrowing down the choices.\n\nIf you are going to Disneyland and can stay at one of the Disneyland Resort Hotels, there are benefits to doing so.\n\nWe like being near both parks and Downtown Disney. The top benefit is Early Entry, which entitles hotel guests to enter either Disneyland or Disney California Adventure (check the calendar for which park it will be on your dates) 30 minutes before the park opens to the general public.\n\nTrust me, you can wedge in more rides than you think because this allows you to get deeper into the park. Our favorite Disneyland Resort Hotel is Disney’s Grand Californian Hotel & Spa.\n\nThere are a variety of hotels near Disneyland also that are within walking distance or often a free shuttle ride away.\n\nI prefer the Anaheim family hotels on South Harbor Boulevard, like Courtyard Anaheim Theme Park Entrance, because you can’t beat the convenience of walking to popular casual dining and a security entrance to the park in just minutes.\n\nWhether you’re going to Disneyland or not, check to see if the offsite hotel is certified as a Good Neighbor Hotel, which means that the property has met strict Disney standards."
