        "text": "The Australian Boomers are about to embark on a changing of the guard... but what does that actually look like?\n\nThe team's loss to Serbia on Tuesday didn't just spell the end of their Paris Olympics campaign; it was also the end of an era for the program. For two decades, the Boomers have entered every major tournament with a Goorjian, Mills, or Ingles in stow. Going into the next cycle, they'll more-than-likely have none of them.\n\nBrian Goorjian has stepped down after his second stint as head coach, while the expectation is that we've also seen the last of Patty Mills and Joe Ingles in the green and gold. Mills will be 39 by the next Olympics and, while he hasn't officially retired, the prospect of him still being in consideration for future Australian teams for major tournaments is highly unlikely, while Ingles has already flagged that Paris was his swansong. The pair were at the forefront of an era that delivered the Boomers multiple fourth-place finishes, then ultimately culminated in a bronze medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Still, father time is undefeated, so the Boomers are now forced to go full-steam ahead into its next generation.\n\nWith the Paris Olympics over for the Boomers, there's now a three-year wait until the 2027 FIBA World Cup in Doha comes around, before the Australian men get their shot at Olympic redemption when the Games head to Los Angeles in 2028.\n\nThe question then becomes: who will be there?\n\nPredicting a Boomers team that will compete in four years is a thankless task, because that amount of time is an eternity in potential development, and, hell, there's still no real sense who the head coach will be. Any projection has to come with the assumption that the trajectory of everyone's development follows the path it's ostensibly currently on, while also understanding that talent can pop up out of nowhere. While difficult, this exercise can also prove to be quite useful, providing a guide to how the group could be built over the next 36-to-48 months.\n\nSo, here it is: our way-too-early Boomers team for the 2028 LA Olympics, and who could be in the discussion.\n\nWay-too-early Australian Boomers team for Los Angeles 2028\n\nGuard: Josh Giddey, Dante Exum, Tyrese Proctor\n\nGuard: Dyson Daniels, Josh Green\n\nForward: Johnny Furphy, Alex Toohey\n\nForward: Matisse Thybulle, Jack McVeigh\n\nCentre: Jock Landale, Alex Condon, Rocco Zikarsky\n\nThe core\n\nThis is the easiest part of this hypothetical team selection.\n\nJosh Giddey was the first player selected to the Paris Olympics team, and will likely be in the same boat for every major tournament for the next decade. Moving forward, the ball will continue to be in his hands, with the team hopefully built more deliberately around his skillset.\n\nThe other is Jock Landale, whose value was truly revealed by his absence at the 2023 World Cup, and then amplified thanks to an effective 2024 Olympics. Landale is the starting centre of this team, and should emerge as more of a focal point moving forward.\n\nThen, there's Dyson Daniels, who really announced himself in Paris as an important two-way threat - especially defensively, of course - for the Boomers. His ability to play off Giddey on the offensive end is helpful as the two 21-year-olds grow in the national team program together, and he played an invaluable role as the primary point of attack defender on the opposing team's main perimeter threat.\n\nRounding out the core is Dant√© Exum, who was extremely effective as the Boomers' backup point guard, and is a steadying force for this team, no matter where on the floor he's playing. His strength lies in his versatility, being able to back up Giddey at the one, as well as play alongside him on the wing. Exum has been a reliable piece of the Boomers over the last few campaigns, and that shouldn't change over the next major tournament cycle.\n\nWho can emerge as key rotation players\n\nWith each campaign, there's seemingly a different role player who steps up.\n\nIn Tokyo, it was Matisse Thybulle who really stepped in and made a material impact. In Paris, that guy was Jack McVeigh, who came on and was ready to knock down shots; his value exemplified by the nearly 30 minutes he played in the Boomers' quarterfinals game against Serbia.\n\nThe skillsets that surround the core group of players is vital when it comes to maximising them, and filling the gaps where needed. In this case, a team with a creator like Giddey and inside presence like Landale needs shooting, general scoring, and defensive versatility in the other spots. In Paris, there was a noticeable lack of impact from the four-spot - primarily filled by Nick Kay - and so, in hindsight, not bringing Thybulle would be seen as a mistake, with him providing a defensive versatility and ability to be dynamic on the offensive end.\n\nFilling the 40 minutes at the four-spot is crucial for this team, and there may not be a right or wrong answer moving forward; instead, it may just be down to the stylistic choice of whomever the head coach is. With Kay coming off his least effective campaign - and he'd be 35 by the next World Cup - it's very difficult to see him as part of this discussion.\n\nThybulle is a sound option, as a defence-focused forward, while McVeigh's shot-making proved to be valuable for this most recent Boomers team.\n\nThis is also where the introduction of Johnny Furphy becomes important. The new Indiana Pacers wing - who stands at 6'9 - can guard multiple positions and has shown the ability to be a high-level catch-and-shoot guy on the perimeter. All of those things are what the Boomers desperately need; especially the shooting. There was hope that Josh Green would bring that similar skillset to Paris, but he was unable to find a rhythm early, before being benched toward the end of the campaign; still, there's real hope he can still be effective in that role.\n\nWhen it comes to those who can play both the three and four spots, the progression of Alex Toohey is also one worth keeping a close eye on. He was part of the 20-man camp in Melbourne ahead of these Olympics, and all reports - from coaches and players alike - was that the 20-year-old looked like he belonged. Among the three emerging players at that camp - Toohey, Ben Henshall, and Rocco Zikarsky - the Sydney Kings forward was the one who appeared the most ready to make an impact at a higher level. If the 6'8 wing can become reliable as a catch-and-shoot threat from downtown, then he'd absolutely be in play to be an impact piece by the 2027 World Cup, where he'd be 23.\n\nFurphy and Toohey are theoretically players who can play both the three and four spots, with that positional versatility an important consideration when picking these teams.\n\nThere appeared to be a lack of rebounding and athleticism at the four-spot, so Luke Travers, Xavier Cooks, and Jack White would be part of the consideration, too. Travers may well have completed multiple seasons with the Cleveland Cavaliers by the time the next Olympics rolls around, while Cooks' athletic point of difference saw him make an impact at the 2023 World Cup. Those two also offer some creation and connectivity on the offensive end; another thing that was missing in Paris. White is an intriguing option because, while he doesn't bring the same size as Travers and Cooks, he has the defensive versatility to compete at the international level, and has also emerged as a much more reliable shooting threat. An outside chance would be the Brisbane Bullets' Josh Bannan, who was effective for the Boomers in the most recent Asia Cup qualifiers, and could emerge as a top-five local player in the NBL over the next few seasons.\n\nThe back-up big spot is also extremely interesting. As the Boomers' 2024 campaign came to an end, there was still no clarity on what the most effective option as the centre spot was when Landale went to the bench. It was initially Will Magnay, then Duop Reath got his shot toward the end of the tournament. Reath would also play some four in Australia's loss to Serbia, but that doesn't seem like a sustainable option moving forward. So then, who is that consistent, reliable backup five?\n\nAlex Condon is someone who could absolutely emerge as that guy. The 6'11 big-man - about to enter his second year at Florida - has a real chance to be a first-round pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, and looked impressive for the Boomers in their pair of exhibition games against Japan prior to these Olympics. Zikarsky is the other big who projects as a potential NBA guy down the line, and the 7'3 centre could bring a different look to that position with his length and ability to protect the rim. In three or four years' time, there's every chance both Condon and Zikarsky could be in a position to provide a real impact on the international stage.\n\nBoth would still be relatively young, though, so some of the more seasoned names would also be part of the discussion. Reath and Magnay showed flashes during the Paris Olympics, and there could very well be a desire to stick with those who have experience in major tournaments. There's also Isaac Humphries and Sam Froling- who would be 29 and 27, respectively by the 2027 World Cup - who have the requisite size to compete at that level, as well as more of a refined interior scoring game, which would be a helpful thing to have from that position.\n\nIf you're betting on an Australian big taking a giant leap over the next few years, then that could be Lachlan Olbrich, who's about to enter his second season with the Illawarra Hawks. He's 6'10 and has great mobility for his size, and projects as someone who will eventually be able to step out and shoot the ball consistently; when it comes to forwards/centres in Australia who could be particularly effective in the FIBA game, Olbrich could be that guy.\n\nWhat the bubble could look like\n\nThose who are right on the fringe are interesting, because it features a bit of everything: the new, the old, and the in-between.\n\nIt must be stressed that all the projections here are based on the current trajectories turning out exactly as planned, without any hiccups; if so, by the 2028 LA Olympics, Dash Daniels would be 20 years old and would've just completed his second season in the NBA. The 6'5 point guard - and younger brother of Dyson - could be a first-round pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, and there may be value, and good reason, in bringing him to his first Olympics just a few years after that. We still have to see if he remains on the same trajectory, and what sort of player he turns into, but there could be value in blooding that sort of talent early on the international stage.\n\nThe lack of perimeter scoring threats outside of Mills was noticeable in Paris, so there'll be a consideration into who could potentially replace that skillset, or just be generally effective creators going forward.\n\nWhen it comes to the emerging combo guards in Australian basketball, Tyrese Proctor is among those with the most potential. The 6'5 guard out of Sydney is about to enter his third season at Duke University and, while his draft stock isn't as high as it once was, there's a shooting and self-creation skillset that's similar to what Mills has brought to the international stage. The Perth Wildcats' Ben Henshall is another young Australian who projects as an elite combo guard moving forward, but there's a question as to whether he'll be at the level by 2028; he may be more of a 2031 World Cup consideration.\n\nFrom a shooting perspective, there's, of course, Dejan Vasiljevic, who was a member of the extended squad ahead of the Paris Olympics, as well as Sean Macdonald, an under-the-radar talent who was really effective for the Tasmania JackJumpers in their 2023 title-winning run.\n\nIf there's a desire for another ball-hander or creator, then there are two different directions that may pan out. One is Taran Armstrong, the Cairns Taipans point guard who's shown glimpses of playing the point effectively at the NBL level; he has the positional size that could make him a useful international player. The other is Matthew Dellavedova, who's made it clear to those around him that he'd like to play in the 2028 Olympics. The veteran point guard worked his way onto the Boomers' final team for Paris, and was able to work his way into the rotation and provide a helpful intensity and physicality.\n\nPicking the team\n\nThe team we ultimately chose features the Giddey-Daniels-Landale core, with players who should maximise their respective skillsets. Furphy comes in as a shooting threat, while Thybulle returns to the fold as that versatile defender at the four. There are more scoring options here, compared to the team in Paris, with Exum, Green, McVeigh, and Toohey all able to knock down shots from the perimeter. All of Giddey, Daniels, Furphy, Exum, and Toohey could theoretically play minutes at the three and four, so there are different combinations that can be thrown out there, all with the requisite shooting and positional size. The backup bigs are young, but there's a bet on Condon taking a big leap, while Zikarsky - who may still have some rawness to his game - brings a different look at that position. Proctor gets the final spot - perhaps still a development spot - as someone who could maybe emerge as an effective scorer in the FIBA game, with his ability to shoot the ball making him someone worth getting a major tournament into. The team is young, and there should be an expectation of teething, but two major tournaments in this group should prime them to be legitimate contenders going into the following major tournament cycle."
