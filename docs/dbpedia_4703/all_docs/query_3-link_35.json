        "text": "If you’ve been looking for a home in the sunshine state with rolling hills and scenic lakes, you might be thinking, “Is Clermont FL an expensive place to live?”\n\nWith the recent influx of new residents, Florida has been making the front page of newspapers and blogs all over the internet—and for good reason. Florida is an amazing place to call home—not only for its scenery—but also for its lower cost of living.\n\nIn this article we will discuss the cost of living in Clermont, Florida and whether it’s a good long-term fit for your household.\n\nIs Clermont FL an Expensive Place to Live?\n\nClermont is an affordable Florida city with access to big city amenities.\n\nClermont has slightly below average home prices is ($417k) compared to the national average of ($436k) and slightly lower rental rates. In addition, Clermont has marginally higher transportation costs from the lack of public transportation options and higher insurance rates for automobiles and homes.\n\nThe robust nature-oriented topography of Clermont makes outdoor access a true cost-saver. With an inexpensive state park (Lake Louisa State Park), miles of walking and biking paths, 11 natural lakes connected by waterways, and a robust community engagement initiative—it’s easy to have fun in Clermont on a minimal budget.\n\nLastly, if you are relocating from a different state, Florida can potentially save you money from its zero state-income tax policy and pro-business environment.\n\nCost of Living in Clermont, FL\n\nLike any city, there are elements that are more or less expensive when compared to other cities. When you live in Clermont, you’ll realize that the daily cost of living is quite affordable compared to many areas around the country.\n\nWe will utilize the data from BestPlaces.net to analyze the cost of living in Clermont and then compare it to the national average.\n\nThe ratings for each category are calculated based on the average cost of living in the US, with a score above 100 indicating a higher cost of living, and a score below 100 indicating a lower cost of living.\n\nCompared to the rest of the U.S., Clermont, FL is an affordable place to live. Once we moved from Illinois to Florida, we instantly saw that it was a great financial move.\n\nAnd, the more expensive of an area you move from—such as moving from California to Florida—the more affordable it becomes.\n\nThe cost of living in Clermont is marginally higher than the national average in most categories. Keep in mind that the average American doesn’t live in a huge metropolitan city—73% of Americans either live in a suburban or rural area.\n\nThe cost of living in Clermont is rated at 106.9, which means it’s slightly more expensive than the US average of 100.\n\nIt’s hard to get a clear picture of what a score of 100 looks like, so we compiled data from BestPlaces.net to determine the average cost of living, and we cross analyzed the data with the most popular relocation cities in the United States as of 2023.\n\nIf you compared Clermont, FL with the 18 most popular places to move in the country (table above), Clermont would rank fifth most affordable.\n\nIn fact, taking a closer look you would notice Clermont would rank first if we didn’t compare it to much larger metropolitan areas.\n\nIf we compare Clermont to similar suburbs near cities in the above table such as the Dallas suburb of Rowlett, TX (cost of living 107.1) or the Nashville suburb of Franklin, TN (cost of living 138.5)—it’s easy to see how affordable Clermont, FL is.\n\nSimilarly, the ratings for groceries and healthcare in Clermont are 102.4 and 101.2 respectively, which are only slightly higher than the national averages. We won’t dissect these factors into cents and dollars because they can vary wildly depending on your spending habits and preferences.\n\nInstead, we will point out that there are inexpensive grocery stores such as Aldi, Winn-Dixie, and BJ’s Wholesale in Clermont which can bring the cost of food down.\n\nAlternatively, there are more expensive options with robust selections such as Publix which can increase the price of food.\n\nHealthcare options are diverse with options such as Orlando Health South Lake (big hospital), Clermont VA Community Health, and dozens upon dozens of specialists (e.g., dentists, family practices, laboratories, etc).\n\nWe have found many inexpensive healthcare options at Walmart, Community Health Centers of Clermont, Advent Primary Care, and Four Corners Community Health Center.\n\nAre houses affordable in Clermont FL?\n\nClermont FL is not a cheap place to buy a house. The average cost of a home is more expensive in Clermont FL than many homes around the country.\n\nWe won’t sugarcoat the fact that you will need a healthy budget if you plan on buying a home in Clermont.\n\nThis is often the most surprising conversation we have with new clients moving to Florida. People are typically under the impression that Orlando is a cheap place to move in general.\n\nHowever, we have to remind people that they are moving to one of the prettiest towns in Florida with rolling hills and lakes, located 30 mins from Orlando and its attractions, within 40 minutes of an international airport, and less than 90 minutes to pristine ocean beaches.\n\nSure, some cities in Florida are inexpensive, but Clermont’s geography makes it especially desirable.\n\nAre houses expensive in Clermont FL?\n\nThe median home cost in Clermont, FL is $417,100, which is lower than the national average of $436,100. While $417k is quite a bit higher than many areas of the U.S., it would still be considered affordable compared to other desirable cities in the US.\n\nNow, we have to make it clear that $417k is an average of 1 bedroom homes all the way up to 6 bedroom mansions, and so the average home sale of our clients is typically above $500k. We simply want to make sure you have a realistic expectation of cost.\n\nLet’s run the numbers of similarly sized big city suburbs:\n\nTo give you a clearer picture, we took suburban areas around the same population size and characteristics as Clermont in popular relocated metropolitan cities and found the average cost of a home as of 2023.\n\nAs you can see below, Clermont would be the fifth most expensive place to buy a house on the list.\n\nAre you spending a lot more money to buy in Clermont? No. But, the difference could be enough for home loan qualifications to change.\n\nWhile the average home in Clermont is expensive, depending on your needs, you may not need to spend quite as much.\n\nRocket Mortgage recently broke down how different home sizes and room configurations in Clermont cost different amounts.\n\nAs you can see above, a two bedroom might only cost $327k whereas a 5+ bedroom will cost $580k.\n\nKeep in mind we regularly see new construction homes over $600k, but again, it all depends on your needs and budget.\n\nRecently, we are seeing fewer and fewer homes under $400k, and like we tell our clients, $300k homes in Clermont are not only hard to find, but often require extensive renovations.\n\nBelow is our tour of three different neighborhoods in Clermont to give you a feel for the area with prices.\n\nAre apartments and renting expensive in Clermont FL?\n\nUsing RentCafe data, we can see that 50% of people in Clermont pay between $1500-$2000 per month on rent. The average rent across all households is $1,761 for approximately $1000 sqft of space or exactly $1.70 per square foot.\n\nHow does Clermont FL compare to the national average for average rent?\n\nAgain, let’s use RentCafe data to analyze national rent trends. The average renter in America pays $1700 per month for nearly $900 square feet, which is exactly $1.80 per square foot.\n\nThat would make the average rent in Clermont about 10 cents cheaper per square foot than the national average.\n\nKeep in mind that rents vary wildly depending on the region. Clermont might look expensive to the average Arkansas and Oklahoma rental at $980 per month.\n\nOn the other hand, comparing Clermont to California or New York at $2500 per month seems like a steal.\n\nIs transportation in Clermont expensive?\n\nOne category where Clermont differs significantly from the national average is transportation. The rating for transportation in Clermont is 117, which means it’s more expensive than the national average.\n\nWhy does Clermont have more expensive transportation costs you ask?\n\nThe simple answer is that there is a huge lack of public transportation in the Orlando region in general.\n\n3 primary factors for Clermont’s expensive transportation issues:\n\nFirst, Clermont does not have access to a train system. Trains and subways tend to be cheaper to travel on and while Orlando does have the SunRail system, it does not travel east-west to Clermont.\n\nSecond, Florida is known for its high car insurance costs. Blame it on the rampant insurance fraud in the state for having to fork over 37% more than the national average.\n\nWhen living in Florida, you’ll see news headlines like this one from WESH2 fairly consistently.\n\nThird, Clermont is a commuter city which means you’ll likely need a car with added maintenance and fuel or electric costs.\n\nIt should be noted that Clermont does have bus service via the LakeXpress system. Depending on your location near a bus route, this could be cost-effective.\n\nThe downside to the LakeXpress which serves Lake County is that it only provides 8 bus stops in Clermont FL which creates a huge issue for anyone not living near State Route 50 or U.S. Highway 27.\n\nDoes Clermont have affordable entertainment?\n\nClermont, FL offers plenty of affordable entertainment options that are sure to appeal to all ages and interests. One aspect of Clermont we most love are the free and nature-based amenities.\n\nFree Activities in Clermont FL\n\nThe South Lake Trail is a beautiful 13-mile paved trail that winds through scenic landscapes, connecting several parks along the way. Visitors can hike, bike, or jog while taking in stunning views of Lake Minneola and the surrounding area.\n\nWaterfront Park is another fantastic free option, offering a sandy beach area, playground, and picnic tables.\n\nLake Hiawatha Preserve is also an amazing place to hang out with 220 acres of dog parks, walking trails, Frisbee golf, and scenic lake views.\n\nLow Cost Activities in Clermont FL\n\nLake Louisa State Park is an excellent choice for outdoor recreation. The park offers hiking, biking, fishing, swimming, and camping opportunities, all at a reasonable cost. Admission to the park is just $5 per vehicle, and campsites can be reserved for as little as $20 per night.\n\nWaterfront Champions Splash park is an awesome place to spend a sunny day. For only $2, kids can play in the amazing splash pad.\n\nIf they get bored, Waterfront Park and beach area is within 100 feet of the splash pad.\n\nCheck out Waterfront Park and Champions Splash Park in our video below:\n\nClermont also has plenty of affordable dining options. The cost of eating out in the area is generally lower than the national average, with many casual restaurants offering meals for under $10.\n\nAffordable Clermont Restaurants Under $15\n\nTroy’s Cuban Deli\n\nEl Cerro Restaurant\n\nClermont Fish House\n\nBruster’s Real Ice Cream\n\nOver the Top Pita\n\nSarah’s Greek & Mediterranean Deli\n\nBamboo Garden Chinese Food\n\nSuncreek Brewery\n\nDelicious But Pricier Clermont Restaurants Over $15\n\nRoot & Branch Bistro\n\nLakeridge Winery & Vineyards\n\nLos Reyes Mexican Grill\n\nGuru Indian Restaurant\n\nKeke’s Breakfast Cafe\n\nThe Southern on 8th\n\nAkina Sushi\n\nThe Crooked Spoon\n\nThe places mentioned above are by no means an exhaustive list of food selections in Clermont. You’ll find more than 60 restaurants all over Clermont—from fine dining to quick and snappy.\n\nLet’s not forget that Clermont is home to Sky Zone, Presidents Hall of Fame, the Performing Arts Center, Clermont Bowling Alley, K1 Speed, Central Florida Dreamplex, the Citrus Tower, Clermont Historic Village, the future home of Olympus, and so much more.\n\nOverall, Clermont, FL offers plenty of affordable entertainment options, from free outdoor recreation to low-cost state parks and dining.
