        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nTechnical Assistance Questions and Answers - Updated on May 15, 2023.\n\nAll EEOC materials related to COVID-19 are collected at www.eeoc.gov/coronavirus.\n\nThe EEOC enforces workplace anti-discrimination laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act (which include the requirement for reasonable accommodation and non-discrimination based on disability, and rules about employer medical examinations and inquiries), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, and sex, including pregnancy), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (which prohibits discrimination based on age, 40 or older), and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. Note: Other federal laws, as well as state or local laws, may provide employees with additional protections.\n\nTitle I of the ADA applies to private employers with 15 or more employees. It also applies to state and local government employers, employment agencies, and labor unions. All nondiscrimination standards under Title I of the ADA also apply to federal agencies under Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. Basic background information about the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act is available on EEOC's disability page.\n\nThe EEO laws, including Title I of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, continue to apply during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, but they do not interfere with or prevent employers from following current guidance and suggestions made by CDC or state/local public health authorities about steps employers should take regarding COVID-19.\n\nThis publication addresses a wide range of COVID-19 issues arising under the federal EEO laws. This includes disability-related inquiries and medical examinations, confidentiality, reasonable accommodation based on disability, harassment, and vaccinations (including reasonable accommodation based on disability or religious beliefs). It also addresses how the definition of disability may apply to COVID-19 and Long COVID.\n\nThis publication remains relevant even with the end of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency on May 11, 2023. The emergency declaration dealt with issues involving health care and access to treatment. The end of the declaration does not change the requirements of the federal equal employment opportunity laws discussed in this publication. See D.20.\n\nThe EEOC has provided guidance (a publication entitled Pandemic Preparedness in the Workplace and the Americans With Disabilities Act [PDF version]) (\"Pandemic Preparedness\"), consistent with these workplace protections and rules, that can help employers implement strategies to navigate the impact of COVID-19 in the workplace. This pandemic publication, which was written during the prior H1N1 outbreak, is still relevant today and identifies established ADA and Rehabilitation Act principles to answer questions frequently asked about the workplace during a pandemic. It has been updated as of March 19, 2020 to address examples and information regarding COVID-19; the new 2020 information appears in bold and is marked with an asterisk.\n\nOn March 27, 2020 the EEOC provided a webinar (\"3/27/20 Webinar\") which was recorded and transcribed and is available at www.eeoc.gov/coronavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 to be an international pandemic. The EEOC pandemic publication includes a separate section that answers common employer questions about what to do after a pandemic has been declared.\n\nFind COVID-19 Guidance for Your Community: This website provides information on a wide range of COVID-related topics, including treatments, testing, specific considerations for those who are immunocompromised, and a variety of information concerning long COVID (including the possibility of joining a research study). This information is also available by telephone (1-800-232-0233) or TTY (1-888-720-7489).\n\nA. Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Exams\n\nThe ADA has restrictions on when and how much medical information an employer may obtain from any applicant or employee.\n\nPrior to making a conditional job offer to an applicant, disability-related inquiries and medical exams are generally prohibited. They are permitted between the time of the offer and when the applicant begins work, provided they are required for everyone in the same job category. For more information on the timing of disability-related inquiries and medical examinations for applicants, see Section C.\n\nUnder the ADA (which is applicable to the Federal sector through the Rehabilitation Act of 1973), once an employee begins work, any disability-related inquiries or medical exams must be \"job-related and consistent with business necessity.\" One way inquiries and medical examinations meet this “business necessity” standard is if they are necessary to determine whether a specific employee has a medical condition that would pose a “direct threat” to health or safety (a significant risk of substantial harm to self or others that cannot be addressed with reasonable accommodation). For more information on reasonable accommodation, see Section D. Where met, the “business necessity” standard allows for consideration of whether a person may have COVID-19, and thus might pose a “direct threat.” For information on disability-related questions and COVID-19 vaccinations, see K.7.- K.9.\n\nCDC has updated its guidance over the course of the pandemic and may continue to do so as the pandemic evolves and as CDC acquires more information about the virus and different variants. The ADA “business necessity” standard requires that employers utilize the most current medical and public health information to determine what inquiries/medical examinations are appropriate.\n\nA.1. If an employee calls in sick, how much information may an employer request from the employee in order to protect the rest of its workforce and others (e.g., customers) from infection with COVID-19? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nIf an employee calls in sick, an employer may ask whether the employee has COVID-19 or common symptoms of COVID-19 as identified by CDC. If the employee has COVID-19 or symptoms of the disease, the employer may follow any CDC-recommended period of isolation with respect to when an employee may return to the workplace or otherwise work in close proximity to others. See A.4., which also addresses following a CDC-recommended period of isolation. Employers must maintain all information about employee illness as a confidential medical record in compliance with the ADA.\n\nA.2. Where can employers obtain current information on symptoms associated with COVID-19? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nThe list of symptoms commonly associated with the disease may change as public health authorities and doctors learn more and as different variants emerge . Employers should rely on CDC for guidance on symptoms currently associated with the disease. These sources may guide employers when choosing questions to ask employees. See also A.8., addressing the ability of an employer to ask employees if they have been diagnosed with or tested for COVID-19.\n\nA.3. When may an ADA-covered employer take the body temperature of employees in an effort to screen for COVID-19? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nMeasuring an employee's body temperature is a medical examination. See A.6. for a discussion of the type of assessment an employer must do to justify requiring a medical examination (or requiring employees to answer disability-related questions) under the ADA’s “business necessity” standard. Employers may wish to consult CDC guidance or guidance from other public health authorities to determine if an elevated temperature is a possible indication of infection. If it is, then taking the temperature of employees will meet the ADA standard.\n\nA.4. Does the ADA allow employers to require employees to stay home if they have COVID-19 or symptoms of COVID-19? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nEmployers should consult current CDC guidance to clarify when and for how long it recommends someone with COVID-19, or symptoms of COVID-19 should stay home. The ADA does not prevent employers from following CDC advice. See also A.1., which addresses the information an employer may request when an employee calls in sick.\n\nA.5. When an employee returns to the workplace after being out with COVID-19, does the ADA allow employers to require a note from a qualified medical professional explaining that it is safe for the employee to return (i.e., no risk of transmission) and that the employee is able to perform the job duties? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nYes. Alternatively, employers may follow CDC guidance to determine whether it is safe to allow an employee to return to the workplace without confirmation from a medical professional.\n\nWhen an employee returns to the workplace after being out with COVID-19, the ADA allows an employer to require confirmation from a qualified medical professional explaining that the individual is able to safely return. Such a request is permitted under the ADA. First, because COVID-19 is not always a disability, a request for confirmation may not be a disability-related inquiry. Alternatively, if the request is considered a disability-related inquiry, it would be justified under the ADA standard requiring that such employee inquiries be job-related and consistent with business necessity. Here, the request meets the “business necessity” standard because it is related to the possibility of transmission and/or related to an employer’s objective concern about the employee’s ability to resume working. For example, an employer may require confirmation from a medical professional addressing whether an employee may resume specific job duties requiring physical exertion.\n\nAs a practical matter, employers may wish to consider other ways to determine the safety of allowing an employee to return to work if doctors and other healthcare professionals are unable to provide such documentation either in a timely manner or at all. This might include reliance on local clinics to provide a form, a stamp, or an e-mail to confirm that an individual is no longer infectious and is able to resume working.\n\nA.6. Under the ADA, may an employer, as a mandatory screening measure, administer a COVID-19 viral test (a test to detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus) when evaluating an employee’s initial or continued presence in the workplace? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nYes, if the employer can show it is job-related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nA COVID-19 viral test is a medical examination within the meaning of the ADA. Therefore, if an employer implements screening protocols that include COVID-19 viral testing, the ADA requires that any mandatory medical test of employees be “job-related and consistent with business necessity.” Employer use of a COVID-19 viral test to screen employees who are or will be in the workplace will meet the “business necessity” standard when it is consistent with guidance from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and/or state/local public health authorities that is current at the time of testing. Be aware that CDC and other public health authorities periodically update and revise their recommendations about COVID-19 testing, and FDA may revise its guidance or emergency use authorizations, based on new information and changing conditions.\n\nA positive viral test result means that the test detected SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, at the time of testing, and that the individual most likely has a current infection and may be able to transmit the virus to others. A negative test result means the test did not detect SARS-CoV-2 at the time of testing. However, a negative test does not mean the employee does not have any virus, or will not later get the virus. It means only that the virus causing SARS-CoV-2 was not detected by the test.\n\nIf an employer seeks to implement screening testing for employees such testing must meet the “business necessity” standard based on relevant facts. Possible considerations in making the “business necessity” assessment may include the level of community transmission, the vaccination status of employees, the accuracy and speed of processing for different types of COVID-19 viral tests, the degree to which breakthrough infections are possible for employees who are “up to date” on vaccinations, the ease of transmissibility of the current variant(s), the possible severity of illness from the current variant, what types of contacts employees may have with others in the workplace or elsewhere that they are required to work (e.g., working with medically vulnerable individuals), and the potential impact on operations if an employee enters the workplace with COVID-19. In making these assessments, employers should check the latest CDC guidance (and any other relevant sources) to determine whether screening testing is appropriate for these employees.\n\nNote: Question A.6. and A.8. address screening of employees generally. See Question A.9. regarding decisions to test only individual employees.\n\nA.7. Under the ADA, may an employer require antibody testing before permitting employees to re-enter the workplace? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nNo. An antibody test, as a medical examination under the ADA, must be job-related and consistent with business necessity. As of July 2022, CDC guidance explains that antibody testing may not show whether an employee has a current infection, nor establish that an employee is immune to infection; as a result, it should not be used to determine whether an employee may enter the workplace. Based on this CDC guidance, at this time such testing does not meet the ADA’s “business necessity” standard for medical examinations or inquiries for employees. Therefore, requiring antibody testing before allowing employees to re-enter the workplace is not allowed under the ADA. An antibody test is different from a test to determine if someone has evidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 or has COVID-19 (i.e., a viral test). The EEOC addresses COVID-19 viral screening tests in A.6.\n\nA.8. May employers ask all employees physically entering the workplace if they have been diagnosed with or tested for COVID-19? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nYes. Employers may ask all employees who will be physically entering the workplace (or otherwise working in close proximity with others, such as clients) if they have COVID-19 or common symptoms associated with COVID-19 as identified by CDC. Employers also may ask if these employees have been tested for COVID-19 (and if so, ask about the result). An employer may exclude those with COVID-19, or symptoms associated with COVID-19, from the workplace if consistent with CDC-recommended isolation protocols. See also A.2.\n\nA.9. May a manager require that a particular employee have a temperature reading or undergo COVID-19 viral testing, as opposed to imposing these medical examinations on all employees? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nWhether an employer wishes to require a particular employee, or all employees, to have a temperature reading or to undergo COVID-19 viral testing, the ADA requires that the employer meet the “business necessity” standard because these are medical examinations. Therefore, it is important for the employer to consider why it wishes to require a medical examination. The ADA does not prevent employers from following recommendations by CDC regarding whether, when, and for whom testing (or other medical screening) is appropriate, because following CDC recommendations will meet the ADA “business necessity” standard. For a discussion of screening testing for employees generally, see A.6. For a discussion of taking temperature as a screening mechanism, see A.3. Employers should not engage in unlawful disparate treatment based on protected characteristics in deciding who is subject to medical examinations.\n\nA.10. May an employer ask an employee who is physically coming into the workplace whether they have family members who have COVID-19 or symptoms associated with COVID-19? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nNo. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibits employers from asking employees medical questions about family members. For example, GINA prohibits employers from asking employees to provide their family members’ medical examination results, including COVID-19 test results. GINA, however, does not prohibit an employer from asking employees whether they have had contact with “anyone” diagnosed with COVID-19 or who may have symptoms associated with the disease. Moreover, from a public health perspective, only asking about an employee’s contact with family members would unnecessarily limit the information obtained about an employee’s potential exposure to COVID-19. Employers should not engage in unlawful disparate treatment based on protected characteristics in deciding who is asked about possible exposure to persons with COVID-19.\n\nA.11. What may an employer do under the ADA if an employee refuses to permit the employer to take the employee’s temperature or refuses to answer questions about whether the employee has COVID-19, has symptoms associated with COVID-19, or has been tested for COVID-19? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nAn employer may ask employees if they have COVID-19, common symptoms of COVID-19 as identified by CDC, or have been tested for COVID-19 (and if so, ask about the result). See A.1. and A.8. An employer also may take an employee’s temperature or require a COVID-19 viral test as long as these medical examinations meet the ADA’s “business necessity” standard. See A.3., A.6., and A.9. If an employee refuses to cooperate by answering these questions or taking these medical examinations, an employer may take whatever action it deems appropriate, consistent with its applicable policies or procedures (e.g., barring an employee from physical presence in the workplace or otherwise working closely with others).\n\nTo gain the cooperation of employees, however, employers may wish to ask the reasons for the employee’s refusal. For example, the employer may be able to provide information or reassurance that they are taking these steps to ensure the safety of everyone in the workplace, and that these steps are consistent with health screening recommendations from CDC. Sometimes, employees are reluctant to provide medical information because they fear an employer may widely spread such personal medical information throughout the workplace. The employer may reassure the employee that the ADA prohibits disclosure of employee medical information with limited exceptions. Alternatively, if an employee requests reasonable accommodation with respect to screening, the usual accommodation process should be followed; this is discussed in Question G.7.\n\nA.12. May an employer request information from an employee who reports feeling ill while on the job with symptoms associated with COVID-19, in order to protect the rest of its workforce and others (e.g., customers) with COVID-19? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nYes. If an employee who works on-site (or otherwise works in close proximity to others), reports feeling ill while on the job, an employer may ask whether the employee has COVID-19 or common symptoms of COVID-19 as identified by CDC. If the employee has COVID-19 or symptoms of the disease, the employer may follow any CDC-recommended period of isolation with respect to when an employee may return to the workplace or otherwise work in close proximity to others. See A.4., which also addresses following a CDC-recommended period of isolation. Employers must maintain all information about an employee’s illness as a confidential medical record in compliance with the ADA.\n\nA.13. May an employer ask an employee why the employee has been absent from work? (9/8/20; adapted from Pandemic Preparedness Question 15)\n\nYes. Asking why an individual did not report to work is not a disability-related inquiry. An employer is always entitled to know why an employee has not reported for work.\n\nA.14. When an employee returns from travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, must an employer wait until the employee develops COVID-19 symptoms to ask questions about where the person has traveled? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nNo. Questions about where a person traveled would not be disability-related inquiries. Employers may wish to consult current CDC guidance regarding domestic or international travel for recommendations on what precautions, if any, are advisable after returning from certain destinations. If an employer wishes to require a medical examination (e.g., requiring a COVID-19 viral test), it must meet the ADA’s “business necessity” standard. See A.6. and A.9.\n\nB. Confidentiality of Medical Information\n\nWith limited exceptions, the ADA requires employers to keep confidential any medical information they learn about any applicant or employee. Medical information includes not only a diagnosis or treatments, but also the fact that an individual has requested or is receiving a reasonable accommodation.\n\nB.1. May an employer store in existing medical files information it obtains related to COVID-19, including the results of taking an employee's temperature or the employee's self-identification as having this disease, or must the employer create a new medical file system solely for this information? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nThe ADA requires that all medical information about a particular employee be stored separately from the employee's personnel file, thus limiting access to this confidential information. An employer may store all medical information related to COVID-19 in existing medical files. This includes an employee's statement that the employee has the disease or suspects so, or the employer's notes or other documentation from questioning an employee about symptoms. Similarly, information about an employee having Long COVID must also be treated as confidential. For information on confidentiality and COVID-19 vaccinations, see K.4.\n\nB.2. If an employer requires all employees to have a daily temperature check before entering the workplace, may the employer maintain a log of the results? (4/9/20)\n\nYes. The employer needs to maintain the confidentiality of this information.\n\nB.3. May an employer disclose the name of an employee to a public health agency when it learns that the employee has COVID-19? (4/9/20)\n\nYes.\n\nB.4. May a temporary staffing agency or a contractor that places an employee in an employer's workplace notify the employer if it learns the employee has COVID-19? (4/9/20)\n\nYes. The staffing agency or contractor may notify the employer and disclose the name of the employee, because the employer may need to determine if this employee had contact with anyone in the workplace.\n\nB.5. Suppose a manager learns that an employee has COVID-19, or has symptoms associated with the disease. The manager knows it must be reported but is worried about violating ADA confidentiality. What should the manager do? (9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 5)\n\nThe ADA requires that an employer keep all medical information about employees confidential, even if that information is not about a disability. Clearly, the information that an employee has symptoms of, or a diagnosis of, COVID-19, is medical information. But the fact that this is medical information does not prevent the manager from reporting to appropriate employer officials so that they can take actions consistent with guidance from the CDC and other public health authorities.\n\nThe question is really what information to report: is it the fact that an employee—unnamed—has symptoms of COVID-19 or a diagnosis, or is it the identity of that employee? Who in the organization needs to know the identity of the employee will depend on each workplace and why a specific official needs this information. Employers should make every effort to limit the number of people who get to know the name of the employee.\n\nThe ADA does not interfere with a designated representative of the employer interviewing the employee to get a list of people with whom the employee possibly had contact through the workplace, so that the employer can then take action to notify those who may have come into contact with the employee, without revealing the employee’s identity. For example, using a generic descriptor, such as telling employees that “someone at this location” or “someone on the fourth floor” has COVID-19, provides notice and does not violate the ADA’s prohibition of disclosure of confidential medical information. For small employers, coworkers might be able to figure out who the employee is, but employers in that situation are still prohibited from confirming or revealing the employee’s identity. Also, all employer officials who are designated as needing to know the identity of an employee should be specifically instructed that they must maintain the confidentiality of this information. Employers may want to plan in advance what supervisors and managers should do if this situation arises and determine who will be responsible for receiving information and taking next steps.\n\nB.6. An employee who must report to the workplace knows that a coworker who reports to the same workplace has symptoms associated with COVID-19. Does ADA confidentiality prevent the first employee from disclosing the coworker's symptoms to a supervisor? (9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 6)\n\nNo. ADA confidentiality does not prevent this employee from communicating to the employee’s supervisor about a coworker’s symptoms. In other words, it is not an ADA confidentiality violation for this employee to inform the supervisor about a coworker’s symptoms. After learning about this situation, the supervisor should contact appropriate management officials to report this information and discuss next steps.\n\nB.7. An employer knows that an employee is teleworking because the person has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with the disease, and is in self-quarantine. May the employer tell staff that this particular employee is teleworking without saying why? (9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 7)\n\nYes. If staff need to know how to contact the employee, and that the employee is working even if not present in the workplace, then disclosure that the employee is teleworking without saying why is permissible. Also, if the employee was on leave rather than teleworking because the employee has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with the disease, or any other medical condition, then an employer cannot disclose the reason for the leave, just the fact that the fact that the individual is on leave.\n\nB.8. Many employees, including managers and supervisors, are now teleworking as a result of COVID-19. How are they supposed to keep medical information of employees confidential while working remotely? (9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 9)\n\nThe ADA requirement that medical information be kept confidential includes a requirement that it be stored separately from regular personnel files. If a manager or supervisor receives medical information involving COVID-19, or any other medical information, while teleworking, and is able to follow an employer’s existing confidentiality protocols while working remotely, the supervisor has to do so. But to the extent that is not feasible, the supervisor still must safeguard this information to the greatest extent possible until the supervisor can properly store it. This means that paper notepads, laptops, or other devices should not be left where others can access the protected information.\n\nSimilarly, documentation must not be stored electronically where others would have access. A manager may even wish to use initials or another code to further ensure confidentiality of the name of an employee.\n\nC. Hiring and Onboarding\n\nUnder the ADA, prior to making a conditional job offer to an applicant, disability-related inquiries and medical exams are generally prohibited. They are permitted between the time of the offer and when the applicant begins work, provided they are required for everyone in the same job category.\n\nC.1. If an employer is hiring, may it screen applicants for symptoms of COVID-19? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nYes. An employer may screen job applicants for symptoms of COVID-19 after making a conditional job offer, as long as it does so for all entering employees in the same type of job. This ADA rule applies whether or not the applicant has a disability.\n\nIn addition, if an employer screens everyone for COVID-19 (i.e., screens all applicants, employees, contractors, and visitors because anyone potentially might have COVID-19) before permitting entry to the worksite, then an applicant in the pre-offer stage who needs to be in the workplace as part of the application process (e.g., for a job interview) may likewise be screened for COVID-19. It is also permissible to screen a subset of applicants pre-offer if they fall into a specific category of individuals (including employees and others) that are subject to COVID-19 screening. For example, if everyone entering a particular building on campus must undergo COVID-19 screening, an employer also may subject an applicant entering this building to the same screening, even though such screening is not routinely done when entering other buildings. But note, an employer should not use this COVID-19 screening as an opportunity, pre-offer, to also ask applicants disability-related questions and/or to conduct medical examinations that may only be done post-offer. For information on the ADA rules governing such inquiries and examination, see Section A.\n\nC.2. May an employer take an applicant's temperature as part of a post-offer, pre-employment medical exam? (3/18/20)\n\nYes. Any medical exams are permitted after an employer has made a conditional offer of employment. However, employers should be aware that some people with COVID-19 do not have a fever.\n\nC.3. May an employer delay the start date of an applicant who has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with it? (3/18/20)\n\nYes. According to CDC guidance, an individual who has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with it should not be in the workplace.\n\nC.4. May an employer withdraw a job offer when it needs an applicant to start working immediately, whether at the worksite or in the physical presence of others outside of the worksite, because the individual has tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, has symptoms of COVID-19, or has been exposed recently to someone with COVID-19? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nAn employer should consult and follow current CDC guidance that explains when and how it would be safe for an individual who currently has COVID-19, symptoms of COVID-19, or has been exposed recently to someone with COVID-19, to end isolation or quarantine and thus safely enter a workplace or otherwise work in the physical presence of others. An employer who follows current CDC guidance addressing the individual’s situation may withdraw the job offer if (1) the job requires an immediate start date, (2) CDC guidance recommends the person not be in proximity to others, and (3) the job requires such proximity to others, whether at the workplace or elsewhere. Given that for some individuals there may only be a short period of time required for isolation or quarantine, employers may be able to adjust a start date or permit telework (if job duties can be performed remotely).\n\nC.5. May an employer postpone the start date or withdraw a job offer because of the employer’s concern that the individual is older, pregnant, or has an underlying medical condition that puts the individual at increased risk from COVID-19? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nNo. An employer’s concern for an applicant’s well-being -- an intent to protect them from what it perceives as a risk of illness from COVID-19 -- does not excuse an action that is otherwise unlawful discrimination. The fact that CDC has noted that older adults, people with certain medical conditions, or pregnant and recently pregnant people may be at greater risk of severe illness from COVID-19 does not justify unilaterally postponing the start date or withdrawing a job offer. Therefore, an employer may not discriminate based on age (40 or older) or pregnancy and related conditions. If an underlying medical condition is a disability, an employer must determine whether the individual’s disability poses a “direct threat” by starting work immediately and, if so, whether reasonable accommodation can be provided to sufficiently lessen or eliminate any risks without causing an undue hardship. For more information on assessing direct threat and reasonable accommodation in this situation, see G.4. and G.5. For more information on potential issues regarding discrimination based on age or pregnancy, see Sections H and J.\n\nD. Disability and Reasonable Accommodation\n\nUnder the ADA, reasonable accommodations are adjustments or modifications provided by an employer to enable people with disabilities to enjoy equal employment opportunities. If a reasonable accommodation is needed and requested by an individual with a disability to apply for a job, perform a job, or enjoy benefits and privileges of employment, the employer must provide it unless it would pose an undue hardship, meaning significant difficulty or expense. An employer has the discretion to choose among effective accommodations. Where a requested accommodation would result in undue hardship, the employer must offer an alternative accommodation if one is available absent undue hardship. In discussing accommodation requests, employers and employees may find it helpful to consult the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) website for types of accommodations, www.askjan.org. JAN's materials specific to COVID-19 are at https://askjan.org/topics/COVID-19.cfm.\n\nFor more information on reasonable accommodation issues that may arise when employees return to the workplace, see Section G. For more information on reasonable accommodation and pregnancy-related disabilities, see Section J. For more information on reasonable accommodation and COVID-19 vaccinations, see K.1., K.2., K.5., K.6., and K.11.\n\nD.1. If a job may only be performed at the workplace, are there reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities, absent undue hardship, that could offer protection to an employee who, due to a preexisting disability, is at higher risk from COVID-19? (4/9/20)\n\nThere may be reasonable accommodations that could offer protection to an individual whose disability puts that person at greater risk from COVID-19 and who therefore requests such actions to eliminate possible exposure. Even with the constraints imposed by a pandemic, some accommodations may meet an employee's needs on a temporary basis without causing undue hardship on the employer.\n\nLow-cost solutions achieved with materials already on hand or easily obtained may be effective. If not already implemented for all employees, accommodations for those who request reduced contact with others due to a disability may include changes to the work environment such as designating one-way aisles; using plexiglass, tables, or other barriers to ensure minimum distances between customers and coworkers whenever feasible per CDC guidance or other accommodations that reduce chances of exposure.\n\nFlexibility by employers and employees is important in determining if some accommodation is possible in the circumstances. Temporary job restructuring of marginal job duties, temporary transfers to a different position, or modifying a work schedule or shift assignment may also permit an individual with a disability to perform safely the essential functions of the job while reducing exposure to others in the workplace or while commuting.\n\nD.2. If an employee has a preexisting mental illness or disorder that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, may the employee now be entitled to a reasonable accommodation (absent undue hardship)? (4/9/20)\n\nAlthough many people feel significant stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, employees with certain preexisting mental health conditions, for example, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, may have more difficulty handling the disruption to daily life that has accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs with any accommodation request, employers may: ask questions to determine whether the condition is a disability; discuss with the employee how the requested accommodation would assist the employee and enable the employee to keep working; explore alternative accommodations that may effectively meet the employee’s needs; and request medical documentation if needed.\n\nD.3. In a workplace where employees are required to telework due to the COVID-19 pandemic, should an employer postpone discussing a request from an employee with a disability for an accommodation that will not be needed until the employee returns to the workplace when mandatory telework ends? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nNot necessarily. An employer may give higher priority to discussing requests for reasonable accommodations that are needed while teleworking, but the employer may begin discussing this request now. The employer may be able to acquire all the information it needs to make a decision. If a reasonable accommodation is granted, the employer also may be able to make some arrangements for the accommodation in advance.\n\nD.4. What if an employee was already receiving a reasonable accommodation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and now requests an additional or altered accommodation? (4/9/20)\n\nAn employee who was already receiving a reasonable accommodation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic may be entitled to an additional or altered accommodation, absent undue hardship. For example, an employee who is teleworking because of the pandemic may need a different type of accommodation than what the employee uses in the workplace. The employer may discuss with the employee whether the same or a different disability is the basis for this new request and why an additional or altered accommodation is needed.\n\nD.5. During the pandemic, if an employee requests an accommodation for a medical condition either at home or in the workplace, may an employer still request information to determine if the condition is a disability? (4/17/20)\n\nYes, if it is not obvious or already known, an employer may ask questions or request medical documentation to determine whether the employee has a \"disability\" as defined by the ADA (a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, or a history of a substantially limiting impairment).\n\nD.6. During the pandemic, may an employer still engage in the interactive process and request information from an employee about why an accommodation is needed? (4/17/20)\n\nYes, if it is not obvious or already known, an employer may ask questions or request medical documentation to determine whether the employee's disability necessitates an accommodation, either the one the employee requested or any other. Possible questions for the employee may include: (1) how the disability creates a limitation, (2) how the requested accommodation will effectively address the limitation, (3) whether another form of accommodation could effectively address the issue, and (4) how a proposed accommodation will enable the employee to continue performing the \"essential functions\" of the employee’s position (that is, the fundamental job duties).\n\nD.7. If there is some urgency to providing an accommodation, may an employer provide a temporary accommodation? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nYes. Given the pandemic, some employers may choose to forgo or shorten the exchange of information between an employer and employee known as the \"interactive process\" (discussed in D.5 and D.6., above) and grant the request. In addition, changes in government restrictions may affect the need for accommodations. Changes in how an employer conducts the interactive process may be necessary to suit changing circumstances based on current public health directives.\n\nWhatever the reason for shortening or adapting the interactive process, an employer may also choose to place an end date on the temporary accommodation (for example, a specific date such as “May 30”). Employers may also opt to provide a requested accommodation on an interim or trial basis, with an end date, while awaiting receipt of medical documentation. Choosing one of these alternatives may be particularly helpful where the requested accommodation would provide protection that an employee may need because of a disability that puts the employee at greater risk during this pandemic. This could also apply to employees who have disabilities exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\nIf an employee requests an extension of a temporary accommodation, the employer must consider it. The employer may take into account current circumstances, including the employee’s current disability-related needs and any applicable government restrictions or public health directives).\n\nD.8. May an employer invite employees to ask for reasonable accommodations they may need in the future in advance of a return to the workplace? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nYes. Employers may inform the entire workforce that employees with disabilities may request accommodations in advance that they believe they may need when returning to the workplace either part-time or full-time. This is discussed in greater detail in Question G.6. If advance requests are received, employers may begin the \"interactive process\"—the discussion between the employer and employee focused on whether the impairment is a disability and the reasons that an accommodation is needed. If an employee chooses not to request accommodation in advance, and instead requests it at a later time, the employer must still consider the request at that time.\n\nD.9. Are the circumstances of the pandemic relevant to whether a requested accommodation can be denied because it poses an undue hardship? (4/17/20)\n\nYes. An employer does not have to provide a particular reasonable accommodation if it poses an \"undue hardship,\" which means \"significant difficulty or expense.\" As described in the two questions that follow, in some instances, an accommodation that would not have posed an undue hardship prior to the pandemic may pose one now.\n\nD.10. May an employer consider circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic when determining if a requested accommodation poses \"significant difficulty\" (and therefore would be an undue hardship)? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nAn employer may consider whether current circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic create \"significant difficulty\" in acquiring or providing certain accommodations, considering the facts of the particular job and workplace. For example, it may be significantly more difficult to conduct a needs assessment or to acquire certain items, and delivery may be impacted, particularly for employees who may be teleworking. Or, it may be significantly more difficult to provide employees with temporary assignments, to remove marginal functions, or to readily hire temporary workers for specialized positions. If a particular accommodation poses an undue hardship due to circumstances related to the pandemic, employers and employees should work together to determine if there may be an alternative that could be provided that does not pose such problems.\n\nD.11. May an employer consider circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic when determining if a requested accommodation poses \"significant expense\" (and therefore would be an undue hardship)? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, most accommodations did not pose a significant expense when considered against an employer's overall budget and resources (always considering the budget/resources of the entire entity and not just its components). Current pandemic conditions make it less likely that they would be the foundation for finding “significant expense,” although an employer may consider any pandemic-related circumstances that could be relevant at the time the employer is making an undue hardship assessment. But, consideration of any relevant pandemic-related reasons does not mean that an employer can reject any accommodation that costs money; an employer must weigh the cost of an accommodation against its current budget while taking into account any constraints created by this pandemic. Even under pandemic-related circumstances, there may be many no-cost or very low-cost accommodations that effectively meet the employee’s disability-related needs.\n\nD.12. Do the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to applicants or employees who are classified as “critical infrastructure workers” or “essential critical workers” by the CDC? (4/23/20)\n\nYes. These CDC designations, or any other designations of certain employees, do not eliminate coverage under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, or any other equal employment opportunity law. Therefore, employers receiving requests for reasonable accommodation under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act from employees falling in these categories of jobs must accept and process the requests as they would for any other employee. Whether the request is granted will depend on whether the worker is an individual with a disability, and whether there is a reasonable accommodation that can be provided absent undue hardship.\n\nD.13. Is an employee entitled to an accommodation under the ADA in order to avoid exposing a family member who is at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 due to an underlying medical condition? (6/11/20)\n\nNo. Although the ADA prohibits discrimination based on association with an individual with a disability, that protection is limited to disparate treatment or harassment. The ADA does not require that an employer accommodate an employee without a disability based on the disability-related needs of a family member or other person with whom the employee is associated.\n\nD.14. When an employer requires some or all of its employees to telework because of COVID-19 or government officials require employers to shut down their facilities and have workers telework, is the employer required to provide a teleworking employee with the same reasonable accommodations for disability under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act that it provides to this individual in the workplace? (9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 20)\n\nIf such a request is made, the employer and employee should discuss what the employee needs and why, and whether the same or a different accommodation could suffice in the home setting. For example, an employee may already have certain things in their home to enable them to do their job so that they do not need to have all of the accommodations that are provided in the workplace.\n\nAlso, the undue hardship considerations might be different when evaluating a request for accommodation when teleworking rather than working in the workplace. A reasonable accommodation that is feasible and does not pose an undue hardship in the workplace might pose one when considering circumstances, such as the place where it is needed and the reason for telework. For example, the fact that the period of telework may be of a temporary or unknown duration may render certain accommodations either not feasible or an undue hardship. There may also be constraints on the normal availability of items or on the ability of an employer to conduct a necessary assessment.\n\nAs a practical matter, and in light of the circumstances that led to the need for telework, employers and employees should both be creative and flexible about what can be done when an employee needs a reasonable accommodation for telework at home. If possible, providing interim accommodations might be appropriate while an employer discusses a request with the employee or is waiting for additional information.\n\nD.15. Assume that an employer grants telework to employees for the purpose of slowing or stopping the spread of COVID-19. When an employer reopens the workplace and recalls employees to the worksite, does the employer automatically have to grant telework as a reasonable accommodation to every employee with a disability who requests to continue this arrangement as an ADA/Rehabilitation Act accommodation? (9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 21)\n\nNo. Any time an employee requests a reasonable accommodation, the employer is entitled to understand the disability-related limitation that necessitates an accommodation. If there is no disability-related limitation that requires teleworking, then the employer does not have to provide telework as an accommodation. Or, if there is a disability-related limitation but the employer can effectively address the need with another form of reasonable accommodation at the workplace, then the employer can choose that alternative to telework.\n\nTo the extent that an employer is permitting telework to employees because of COVID-19 and is choosing to excuse an employee from performing one or more essential functions, then a request—after the workplace reopens—to continue telework as a reasonable accommodation does not have to be granted if it requires continuing to excuse the employee from performing an essential function. The ADA never requires an employer to eliminate an essential function as an accommodation for an individual with a disability.\n\nThe fact that an employer temporarily excused performance of one or more essential functions when it closed the workplace and enabled employees to telework for the purpose of protecting their safety from COVID-19, or otherwise chose to permit telework, does not mean that the employer permanently changed a job’s essential functions, that telework is always a feasible accommodation, or that it does not pose an undue hardship. These are fact-specific determinations. The employer has no obligation under the ADA to refrain from restoring all of an employee’s essential duties at such time as it chooses to restore the prior work arrangement, and then evaluating any requests for continued or new accommodations under the usual ADA rules.\n\nD.16. Assume that prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, an employee with a disability had requested telework as a reasonable accommodation. The employee had shown a disability-related need for this accommodation, but the employer denied it because of concerns that the employee would not be able to perform the essential functions remotely. In the past, the employee therefore continued to come to the workplace. However, after the COVID-19 crisis has subsided and temporary telework ends, the employee renews the request for telework as a reasonable accommodation. Can the employer again refuse the request? (9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 22)\n\nAssuming all the requirements for such a reasonable accommodation are satisfied, the temporary telework experience could be relevant to considering the renewed request. In this situation, for example, the period of providing telework because of the COVID-19 pandemic could serve as a trial period that showed whether or not this employee with a disability could satisfactorily perform all essential functions while working remotely, and the employer should consider any new requests in light of this information. As with all accommodation requests, the employee and the employer should engage in a flexible, cooperative interactive process going forward if this issue does arise.\n\nD.17. Might the pandemic result in excusable delays during the interactive process? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nYes. Some of the issues initially created by the pandemic that delayed engaging in an interactive process and/or providing reasonable accommodation may no longer exist. But, as the pandemic continues to evolve and new issues arise, it is possible that an employer may face new challenges that interfere with responding expeditiously to a request for accommodation. Similarly, reopening a workplace may bring a higher number of requests for reasonable accommodation. In all these situations, an employer must show specific pandemic-related circumstances justified the delay in providing a reasonable accommodation to which the employee was legally entitled. To the extent that evolving circumstances created by the pandemic cause a justifiable delay in the interactive process–thereby delaying a decision on a request–employers and employees are encouraged to use interim solutions to enable employees to keep working as much as possible.\n\nD.18. Federal agencies are required to have timelines in their written reasonable accommodation procedures governing how quickly they will process requests and provide reasonable accommodations. What happens if circumstances created by the pandemic prevent an agency from meeting this timeline? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nSituations created by the current COVID-19 pandemic may constitute an “extenuating circumstance”—something beyond a federal agency’s control—that may justify exceeding the normal timeline that an agency has adopted in its internal reasonable accommodation procedures.\n\nSome of the issues initially created by the pandemic that delayed engaging in an interactive process and/or providing reasonable accommodation may no longer exist. But, as the pandemic continues to evolve and new issues arise, it is possible that an agency may face new challenges that interfere with responding to a request for accommodation within an agency’s timeline. Similarly, reopening a workplace may bring a higher number of requests for reasonable accommodation. In all these situations, an agency must show specific pandemic-related circumstances that constitute an “extenuating circumstance.” To the extent that there is an extenuating circumstance, agencies and employees are encouraged to use interim solutions to enable employees to keep working as much as possible.\n\nD.19. What are examples of reasonable accommodations that may assist employees with Long COVID? (5/15/23)\n\nThe possible types of reasonable accommodations to address various symptoms of Long COVID vary, depending on a number of factors, including the nature of the symptoms, the job duties, and the design of the workplace. Some common reasonable accommodations include: a quiet workspace, use of noise cancelling or white noise devices, and uninterrupted worktime to address brain fog; alternative lighting and reducing glare to address headaches; rest breaks to address joint pain or shortness of breath; a flexible schedule or telework to address fatigue; and removal of “marginal functions” that involve physical exertion to address shortness of breath. The Job Accommodation Network has information on a variety of possible reasonable accommodations to address specific symptoms of Long COVID.\n\nD.20. As a result of the end of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency on May 11, 2023, may employers automatically terminate reasonable accommodations that were provided due to pandemic-related circumstances? (5/15/23)\n\nNo. This emergency declaration dealt with issues involving health care coverage and access to treatment. It did not address the ADA and Rehabilitation Act requirements regarding provision of reasonable accommodation. Therefore, the end of this Public Health Emergency declaration does not automatically provide grounds to terminate reasonable accommodations that continue to be needed to address on-going pandemic-related circumstances (e.g., continued high risk to individuals with certain disabilities if they contract COVID-19). However, an employer may evaluate accommodations granted during the public health emergency and, in consultation with the employee, assess whether there continues to be a need for reasonable accommodation based on individualized circumstances. Consistent with the ADA’s “business necessity” standard, this evaluation may include a request for documentation that addresses why there may be an ongoing need for accommodation and whether alternative accommodations might meet those needs.\n\nE. Pandemic-Related Harassment Due to National Origin, Race, or Other Protected Characteristics\n\nE.1. What practical tools are available to employers to reduce and address workplace harassment that may arise as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic? (4/9/20)\n\nEmployers can help reduce the chance of harassment by explicitly communicating to the workforce that fear of the COVID-19 pandemic should not be misdirected against individuals because of a protected characteristic, including their national origin, race, or other prohibited bases.\n\nPractical anti-harassment tools provided by the EEOC for small businesses can be found here:\n\nAnti-harassment policy tips for small businesses\n\nSelect Task Force on the Study of Harassment in the Workplace (includes detailed recommendations and tools to aid in designing effective anti-harassment policies; developing training curricula; implementing complaint, reporting, and investigation procedures; creating an organizational culture in which harassment is not tolerated):\n\nreport;\n\nchecklists for employers who want to reduce and address harassment in the workplace; and\n\nchart of risk factors that lead to harassment and appropriate responses.\n\nE.2. Are there steps an employer should take to address possible harassment and discrimination against employees in connection with the pandemic? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nYes. An employer may remind all employees that it is against the federal EEO laws to harass or otherwise discriminate against coworkers based on race, national origin, color, sex (including sexual orientation, gender identity, and pregnancy), religion, age (40 or over), disability, or genetic information. It may be particularly helpful for employers to advise supervisors and managers of their roles in watching for, stopping, and reporting any harassment or other discrimination. An employer may want to provide illustrations of pandemic-related harassment for supervisors, managers, and all other employees to help them understand what actions may violate the EEO laws. For example, one illustration might show a supervisor or coworker violating the ADA/Rehabilitation Act by harassing an employee with a disability-related need to wear a mask or take other COVID-19 precautions. Another illustration might show a supervisor or coworker violating Title VII by harassing an employee who is receiving a religious accommodation to forgo mandatory vaccination. (See E.3. for an additional example of pandemic-related harassment.) Finally, an employer may also make clear that it will immediately review any allegations of harassment or discrimination and take appropriate action.\n\nE.3. How may employers respond to pandemic-related harassment, in particular against employees who are or are perceived to be Asian? (6/11/20)\n\nManagers should be alert to demeaning, derogatory, or hostile remarks directed to employees who are or are perceived to be of Chinese or other Asian national origin, including about the coronavirus or its origins.\n\nAll employers covered by Title VII should ensure that management understands in advance how to recognize such harassment. Harassment may occur using electronic communication tools—regardless of whether employees are in the workplace, teleworking, or on leave—and also in person between employees at the worksite. Harassment of employees at the worksite may also originate with contractors, customers or clients, or, for example, with patients or their family members at health care facilities, assisted living facilities, and nursing homes. Managers should know their legal obligations and be instructed to quickly identify and resolve potential problems, before they rise to the level of unlawful discrimination.\n\nEmployers may choose to send a reminder to the entire workforce noting Title VII’s prohibitions on harassment, reminding employees that harassment will not be tolerated, and inviting anyone who experiences or witnesses workplace harassment to report it to management. Employers may remind employees that harassment can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.\n\nE.4. An employer learns that an employee who is teleworking due to the pandemic is sending harassing emails to another worker. What actions should the employer take? (6/11/20)\n\nThe employer should take the same actions it would take if the employee was in the workplace. Employees may not harass other employees through, for example, emails, calls, or platforms for video or chat communication and collaboration.\n\nF. Furloughs and Layoffs\n\nF.1. Under the EEOC's laws, what waiver responsibilities apply when an employer is conducting layoffs? (4/9/20)\n\nSpecial rules apply when an employer is offering employees severance packages in exchange for a general release of all discrimination claims against the employer. More information is available in EEOC's technical assistance document on severance agreements.\n\nF.2. What are additional EEO considerations in planning furloughs or layoffs? (9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 13)\n\nThe laws enforced by the EEOC prohibit covered employers from selecting people for furlough or layoff because of that individual’s race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, disability, protected genetic information, or in retaliation for protected EEO activity.\n\nG. Return to the Workplace\n\nG.1. As government restrictions are imposed, lifted, or modified during the course of the pandemic, how will employers know what steps they can take consistent with the ADA to screen employees for the virus that causes COVID-19 when entering the workplace? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nThe ADA permits employers to make disability-related inquiries and conduct medical exams to screen employees for COVID-19 when entering the workplace if such screening is “job-related and consistent with business necessity.” For more information on disability-related inquiries and medical examinations, see Section A. For information on reasonable accommodation requests related to screening protocols, see G.7.\n\nEmployers should make sure not to engage in unlawful disparate treatment based on protected characteristics in decisions related to screening and exclusion.\n\nG.2. An employer requires workers to wear personal protective equipment and engage in other infection control practices. Some employees ask for accommodations due to a disability or a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance that affects the ability to wear personal protective equipment and/or engage in other infection control practices. How should an employer respond? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nIn most instances, federal EEO laws permit an employer to require employees to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) (for example, masks and/or gloves) and observe other infection control practices (for example, regular hand washing or physical distancing protocols). Some employers may need to comply with regulations issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) that require the use of PPE. OSHA regulations do not prohibit the use of reasonable accommodations under the EEO laws as long as those accommodations do not violate OSHA requirements. Employers also may follow current CDC guidance about who should wear masks.\n\nRegardless of the reason an employer requires PPE (or other infection control measures), when an employee with a disability needs a reasonable accommodation under the ADA to comply with an employer’s requirement to wear PPE (e.g., non-latex gloves, modified face masks for interpreters or others who communicate with an employee who uses lip reading, or gowns designed for individuals who use wheelchairs), or when an employee requires a religious accommodation under Title VII (such as modified or alternative equipment due to religious attire or grooming practices), the employer should discuss the request and provide accommodation (either what is requested by the employee or an alternative that is effective in meeting the employee’s needs) if it does not cause an undue hardship on the operation of the employer's business under the ADA or Title VII. For general information on reasonable accommodation under the ADA, see Section D.\n\nG.3. What does an employee need to do in order to request reasonable accommodation from an employer because the employee has one of the medical conditions that CDC says may put a person at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nAn employee—or a third party, such as an employee’s doctor—must let the employer know that the employee needs a change for a reason related to a medical condition . Individuals may request accommodation orally or in writing. While the employee (or third party) does not need to use the term “reasonable accommodation” or reference the ADA, the employee may do so.\n\nThe employee or the employee’s representative should communicate that the employee has a medical condition necessitating a change to meet a medical need. After receiving a request, the employer may ask questions or seek medical documentation to help decide if the individual has a disability—not all medical conditions meet the ADA’s definition of “disability”—and if there is a reasonable accommodation, barring undue hardship, that can be provided. For additional information on reasonable accommodation under the ADA, see Section D. For information on pregnancy-related disabilities covered under the ADA, see J.2. For general information on reasonable accommodation requests related to a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance, see K.12.\n\nG.4. CDC identifies a number of medical conditions that are more likely to cause people to get severely ill if they get COVID-19. An employer knows that an employee has one of these conditions and is concerned that the employee’s health will be jeopardized upon returning to the workplace, but the employee has not requested accommodation. How does the ADA apply to this situation? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nThe ADA does not mandate that the employer take action in this situation if the employee has not requested reasonable accommodation. Also, an employer’s duty to provide reasonable accommodation applies only if an employee has an actual disability or a record of a disability, as defined in the ADA; this means not every individual with one of the medical conditions that might place them at higher risk of COVID-19 complications will automatically satisfy these ADA definitions of disability.\n\nAssuming the employee has a “disability” as discussed above, if the employer is concerned that the health of an employee with a disability may be jeopardized upon returning to the workplace, the ADA generally does not allow the employer to exclude the employee—or take any other adverse action—because the employee has a disability that CDC identifies as potentially placing the employee at higher risk for severe illness if the employee gets COVID-19. Under the ADA, such an adverse action is not allowed unless the employee’s disability poses a “direct threat” to the employee’s health or safety that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.\n\nThe ADA direct threat requirement is a high standard. As an affirmative defense for the employer, direct threat requires an employer to show that the individual has a disability that poses a “significant risk of substantial harm” to the employee’s own health or safety, or that of others in the workplace under 29 C.F.R. section 1630.2(r) (regulation addressing direct threat to health or safety of self or others). A direct threat assessment cannot be based solely on the disability being identified in CDC’s guidance; the determination must be an individualized assessment based on a reasonable medical judgment about this employee’s disability—not the disability in general—using the most current medical knowledge and/or on the best available objective evidence. Thus, an employer analyzing a potential direct threat must consider the duration of the risk, the nature and severity of the potential harm, the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and the imminence of the potential harm. Analysis of these factors will likely include considerations based on the severity of the pandemic in a particular area and the employee’s own health (for example, is the employee’s disability well-controlled), and the employee’s particular job duties. A determination of direct threat also would include whether the employee is up to date on vaccinations and the likelihood that an individual may be exposed to the virus at the worksite. Measures that an employer may be taking in general to protect all workers, such as mandatory physical distancing, also would be relevant.\n\nEven if an employer determines that an employee’s disability poses a “significant risk of substantial harm” to the employee’s own health or safety, the employer still cannot exclude the employee from the workplace—or take any other adverse action—unless there is no way to provide a reasonable accommodation (absent undue hardship). The ADA regulations require an employer to consider whether there are reasonable accommodations that would eliminate or sufficiently reduce the risk so that it would be safe for the employee to return to the workplace, while still permitting the employee to perform the essential functions of the job.\n\nAn employer’s consideration of a possible reasonable accommodation should involve an interactive process with the employee. If there are no accommodations in an employee’s current position that sufficiently reduce or eliminate direct threat in the workplace, then an employer must consider accommodations such as telework, leave, or—as a last resort—reassignment (perhaps to a different job in a place where it may be safer for the employee to work or that permits telework).\n\nAn employer may only bar an employee from working based on the direct threat analysis if, after going through all these steps, the facts support the conclusion that the employee poses a significant risk of substantial harm to the employee’s own health or safety that cannot be reduced or eliminated by reasonable accommodation. For general information on reasonable accommodation under the ADA (i.e., where an individual’s request for reasonable accommodation has nothing to do with potential direct threat concerns), see Section D.\n\nG.5. What are examples of reasonable accommodation that, absent undue hardship, may eliminate (or reduce to an acceptable level) a direct threat to self or others? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nReasonable accommodations that may eliminate (or reduce to an acceptable level) a direct threat to self or others may include additional or enhanced protective gowns, masks, gloves, or other gear beyond what the employer may generally provide to, or require from, employees returning to its workplace. Reasonable accommodations also may include additional or enhanced protective measures, such as High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtration systems/units or other enhanced air filtration measures, erecting a barrier that provides separation between an employee with a disability and coworkers/the public, or increasing the space between an employee with a disability and others. Another possible reasonable accommodation may be elimination or substitution of particular “marginal” functions (less critical or incidental job duties as distinguished from the “essential” functions of a particular position). In addition, accommodations may include telework, modification of work schedules (if that decreases contact with coworkers and/or the public when on duty or commuting), or moving the location of where one performs work (for example, moving a person to the end of a production line rather than in the middle of it if that provides more physical distancing).\n\nThese are only a few ideas. Identifying an effective accommodation depends, among other things, on an employee’s job duties and the design of the workspace. An employer and employee should discuss possible ideas; the Job Accommodation Network (www.askjan.org) also may be able to assist in helping identify possible accommodations. As with all discussions of reasonable accommodation during this pandemic, employers and employees are encouraged to be creative and flexible. For general information on reasonable accommodation under the ADA, see Section D.\n\nG.6. As a best practice, and in advance of having some or all employees return to the workplace, are there ways for an employer to invite employees to request flexibility in work arrangements? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nYes. The ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act do not prohibit employers from making information available in advance to all employees about whom to contact—if they wish—to request reasonable accommodation that they may need for a disability or a sincerely held religious belief, practice or observance upon return to the workplace. Once requests are received, the employer may begin the interactive process. An employer may choose to include in such a notice all medical conditions identified in CDC guidance that may place people at higher risk of serious illness if they contract COVID-19, provide instructions about whom to contact, and explain that the employer is willing to consider on a case-by-case basis any requests from employees who have these or other medical conditions which may qualify as disabilities.\n\nAlternatively, an employer may send a general notice explaining that the employer is willing to consider employee requests for reasonable accommodation for employees with a disability or a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance, or to consider flexibility on an individualized basis for employees not eligible for reasonable accommodation (e.g., employees who request flexibility due to age). The employer should specify if the point of contact is different depending on whether the request is based on disability, sincerely held religious beliefs, pregnancy, age, or child-care responsibilities.\n\nEither approach is consistent with the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and Title VII.\n\nRegardless of the approach, employers should ensure that those employees who receive, review, or process these requests are sufficiently trained in how to handle them in accordance with the federal employment nondiscrimination laws that may apply, for instance, with respect to accommodations due to a disability or a sincerely held religious belief, observance, or practice; or a request related to pregnancy. For additional information on reasonable accommodation under the ADA/Rehabilitation Act, see Section D.\n\nG.7. What should an employer do if an employee entering the worksite requests an alternative method of screening due to a medical condition? (6/11/20)\n\nThis is a request for reasonable accommodation, and an employer should proceed as it would for any other request for accommodation under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. If the requested change is easy to provide and inexpensive, the employer might voluntarily choose to make it available to anyone who asks, without going through an interactive process. Alternatively, if a disability is not obvious or already known, an employer may ask the employee for information to establish that the condition is a disability and what specific limitations require an accommodation. If necessary, an employer also may request medical documentation to support the employee’s request, and then determine if that accommodation or an alternative effective accommodation can be provided, absent undue hardship.\n\nSimilarly, if an employee requested an alternative method of screening as a religious accommodation, the employer should determine if accommodation is available under Title VII.\n\nH. Age\n\nH.1. CDC has explained that the risk for severe illness with COVID-19 increases with age, with older adults at the highest risk. Do older adults have protections under the federal employment discrimination laws? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nYes. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits employment discrimination against individuals age 40 and older. The ADEA would prohibit a covered employer from excluding an individual involuntarily from the workplace based on being older, even if the employer acted for benevolent reasons such as protecting the employee due to higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. For more information on postponing a start date or withdrawing a job offer due to older age, see C.5.\n\nUnlike the ADA, the ADEA does not include a right to reasonable accommodation for workers due to age. However, employers are free to provide flexibility to older workers; the ADEA does not prohibit this, even if it results in younger workers being treated less favorably based on age in comparison.\n\nOlder workers also may have medical conditions that bring them under the protection of the ADA as individuals with disabilities. As such, they may request reasonable accommodation for their disability.\n\nH.2. If an employer is choosing to offer flexibilities to other workers, may older comparable workers be treated less favorably based on age? (9/8/20; adapted from 3/27/20 Webinar Question 12)\n\nNo. If an employer is allowing other comparable workers to telework, it should make sure it is not treating older workers less favorably based on their age.\n\nI. Caregivers/Family Responsibilities\n\nFor additional information about pandemic-related caregiver discrimination under the laws enforced by the EEOC, see the EEOC’s technical assistance document, The COVID-19 Pandemic and Caregiver Discrimination Under Federal Employment Discrimination Laws.\n\nI.1. If an employer provides telework, modified schedules, or other benefits to employees with school-age children due to school closures or distance learning during the pandemic, are there sex discrimination considerations? (3/14/22)\n\nEmployers may provide any flexibilities as long as they are not treating employees differently based on sex or other EEO-protected characteristics. For example, under Title VII, female employees cannot be given more favorable treatment than male employees because of a gender-based assumption about who may have caregiving responsibilities for children.\n\nI.2. How might unlawful caregiver discrimination related to the COVID-19 pandemic arise under the laws enforced by the EEOC? (3/14/22)\n\nCaregiver discrimination violates the laws enforced by the EEOC if it is based on an applicant’s or employee’s sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, or gender identity), race, national origin, disability, age (40 or older), or another characteristic covered by federal employment discrimination laws. Caregiver discrimination also is unlawful if it is based on the caregiver’s association with an individual with a disability, or on the race, ethnicity, or other protected characteristic of the individual receiving care.\n\nCaregiver discrimination related to the pandemic may arise in a variety of ways. For instance, under Title VII, employers may not discriminate against employees with pandemic-related caregiving responsibilities based on their sex, including gender stereotypes associated with caregiving responsibilities or roles. For example, employers may not decline to assign female employees with caregiving responsibilities demanding or high-profile projects that increase employees’ advancement potential but require significant overtime or travel. Likewise, employers may not reassign such projects to other employees based on assumptions that female caregivers cannot, should not, or would not want to work extra hours or be away from their families if a family member is infected with or exposed to COVID-19. Employers also may not deny male employees permission to telework or to adjust their schedules to enable them to perform pandemic-related caregiving obligations, such as caring for young children or parents, while granting such requests when made by similarly situated female employees.\n\nTitle VII also prohibits employers from discriminating against employees with pandemic-related caregiving duties based on their race or national origin. For example, employers may not require more burdensome processes for employees of a certain race or national origin who are requesting schedule changes or leave related to COVID-19 caregiving. Employers also may not deny such requests more frequently, or penalize employees for requesting or receiving schedule changes or leave for caregiving purposes, based on employees’ race or national origin. Discrimination based on citizenship or immigration status against workers with caregiving responsibilities also can be unlawful under a law enforced by the Department of Justice.\n\nUnder the ADA, employers may not discriminate against workers based on stereotypes or assumptions about workers’ caregiving responsibilities for an individual with a disability, such as a child, spouse, or parent with a disability. For example, if an applicant is the primary caregiver of an individual with a disability who is at higher risk of complications from COVID-19, an employer may not refuse to hire the applicant out of fear that the care recipient will increase the employer’s healthcare costs. If the applicant is hired, the employer may not refuse to allow the care recipient to be added as a dependent on the employer’s health insurance because of that individual’s disability. An employer also may not refuse to promote employees with caregiving responsibilities for an individual with a disability based on the assumption that they will take a significant amount of leave for caregiving purposes.\n\nI.3. Are these legal protections available only to workers caring for children, or are they also available to workers with other caregiving obligations? (3/14/22)\n\nThis response includes hyperlinks to non-governmental sources. The EEOC includes these resources solely for informational purposes. The EEOC does not endorse these resources or the entities responsible for them, and it does not vouch for the accuracy of the information provided by referencing the non-governmental sources in this response.\n\nEmployers may not discriminate against applicants or employees with caregiving responsibilities based on characteristics protected by the laws enforced by the EEOC, including caregivers’ sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, or gender identity), race, color, religion, national origin, age (40 or older), disability, association with an individual with a disability, or genetic information (including family medical history). These protections are available to workers with any type of caregiving responsibilities, including care for children, spouses, partners, relatives, individuals with disabilities, or others.\n\nState or local laws may provide additional protections for workers with caregiving responsibilities. Employees with caregiving responsibilities also may have rights under other laws, including the Family and Medical Leave Act or similar state or local laws.\n\nI.4. Should employers and employees be aware of any other pandemic-related caregiver discrimination issues? (3/14/22)\n\nYes. In this What You Should Know document, the EEOC addresses several different types of potential pandemic-related caregiver discrimination. For example:\n\nA.10 addresses employer inquiries about family members with COVID-19 or related symptoms.\n\nC.5 addresses employer-imposed start date postponements or offer withdrawals for pregnant applicants.\n\nD.13 addresses whether employees are entitled to accommodations to avoid exposing family members at high risk of complications from COVID-19.\n\nJ.1 and J.2 address excluding employees from the workplace based on pregnancy and accommodating pregnancy.\n\nK.2 addresses pregnancy accommodation requests related to vaccination.\n\nK.3 addresses employer encouragement of vaccination of family members.\n\nK.13 addresses decisions not to be vaccinated due to pregnancy.\n\nK.18 addresses GINA and incentives for non-employer-provided family member vaccinations or employer requests for documentation of family member vaccinations.\n\nK.20 addresses GINA and incentives for employer-provided family member vaccinations.\n\nK.21 addresses GINA and family member vaccinations without incentives.\n\nFor general information about caregiver discrimination and federal employment discrimination laws, see the EEOC’s policy guidance, associated fact sheet, and best practices document.\n\nJ. Pregnancy\n\nJ.1. Due to the pandemic, may an employer exclude an employee from the workplace involuntarily due to pregnancy? (6/11/20)\n\nNo. Sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act includes discrimination based on pregnancy. Even if motivated by benevolent concern, an employer is not permitted to single out workers on the basis of pregnancy for adverse employment actions, including involuntary leave, layoff, or furlough. For more information on postponing a start date or withdrawing a job offer due to pregnancy, see C.5.\n\nJ.2. Is there a right to accommodation based on pregnancy during the pandemic? (6/11/20)\n\nThere are two federal employment discrimination laws that may trigger accommodation for employees based on pregnancy.\n\nFirst, pregnancy-related medical conditions may themselves be disabilities under the ADA, even though pregnancy itself is not an ADA disability. If an employee makes a request for reasonable accommodation due to a pregnancy-related medical condition, the employer must consider it under the usual ADA rules.\n\nSecond, Title VII as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act specifically requires that women affected by pregnancy, childbirth, and related medical conditions be treated the same as others who are similar in their ability or inability to work. This means that a pregnant employee may be entitled to job modifications, including telework, changes to work schedules or assignments, and leave to the extent provided for other employees who are similar in their ability or inability to work. Employers should ensure that supervisors, managers, and human resources personnel know how to handle such requests to avoid disparate treatment in violation of Title VII. For information on pregnancy and COVID-19 vaccination, see K.13.\n\nK. Vaccinations - Overview, ADA, Title VII, and GINA\n\nNote: Court decisions upholding or rejecting federal vaccination requirements do not affect any statements made in this publication regarding employer and employee rights and responsibilities under the equal employment opportunity laws with respect to employers that require COVID-19 vaccinations.\n\nThe availability of COVID-19 vaccinations raises questions under the federal equal employment opportunity (EEO) laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Rehabilitation Act, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, as amended, inter alia, by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (Title VII) (see also Section J, EEO rights relating to pregnancy and Section L, Vaccinations – Title VII Religious Objections to COVID-19 Vaccine Requirements.)\n\nThis section was originally issued on December 16, 2020, and was updated on October 25, 2021, July 12, 2022, and 5/15/23. Note that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidance for vaccinated individuals that addresses, among other things, when they need to wear a mask indoors.\n\nThe EEOC has received many inquiries from employers and employees about the type of authorization granted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the administration of COVID-19 vaccines. On August 23, 2021, the FDA approved the Biologics License Application for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for use in individuals 16 years of age and older. Previously, the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for the two other vaccines—one made by Moderna and the other by Janssen/Johnson & Johnson—authorizing them for use in the United States for individuals 18 years of age and older. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is authorized under an EUA for individuals 12 years of age and older and for the administration of a third dose in certain immunocompromised individuals. For the current status of vaccines authorized or approved by the FDA, please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html\n\nAlso of note, on July 6, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel issued a Memorandum Opinion concluding that section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does not prohibit public or private entities from imposing vaccination requirements for a vaccine that is subject to an EUA.\n\nOther federal, state, and local laws and regulations govern COVID-19 vaccination of employees, including requirements for the federal government as an employer. The federal government as an employer is subject to the EEO laws. Federal departments and agencies should consult the website of the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force for the latest guidance on federal agency operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis technical assistance on vaccinations was written to help employees and employers better understand how federal laws related to workplace discrimination apply during the COVID-19 pandemic. The EEOC questions and answers provided here set forth applicable EEO legal standards consistent with the federal civil rights laws enforced by the EEOC and with EEOC regulations, guidance, and technical assistance, unless another source is expressly cited. In addition, whether an employer meets the EEO standards will depend on the application of these standards to particular factual situations.\n\nCOVID-19 Vaccinations: EEO Overview\n\nK.1. Under the ADA, Title VII, and other federal employment nondiscrimination laws, may an employer require all employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nThe federal EEO laws do not prevent an employer from requiring all employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19, subject to the reasonable accommodation provisions of Title VII and the ADA and other EEO considerations discussed below. (See also Section L, Vaccinations – Title VII Religious Objections to COVID-19 Vaccine Requirements). If there is such an employer requirement, the EEO laws do not prevent employers from requiring documentation or other confirmation that employees are up to date on their vaccinations (see K.9.), but the EEO laws may require employers to make exceptions to a vaccination requirement for some employees.\n\nThe ADA and Title VII require an employer to provide reasonable accommodations for employees who, because of a disability or a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance, do not get vaccinated against COVID-19, unless providing an accommodation would pose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer’s business. The analysis for undue hardship depends on whether the accommodation is for a disability (including pregnancy-related conditions that constitute a disability) (see K.6.) or for religion (see K.12.).\n\nAs with any employment policy, employers that have a vaccination requirement may need to respond to allegations that the requirement has a disparate impact on—or disproportionately excludes—employees based on their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin under Title VII (or age under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act [40+]). Employers should keep in mind that because some individuals or demographic groups may face barriers to receiving a COVID-19 vaccination, some employees may be more likely to be negatively impacted by a vaccination requirement.\n\nIt would also be unlawful to apply a vaccination requirement to employees in a way that treats employees differently based on disability, race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, sexual orientation, and gender identity), national origin, age, or genetic information, unless there is a legitimate non-discriminatory reason.\n\nK.2. What are some examples of reasonable accommodations or modifications that employers may have to provide to employees who do not get vaccinated due to disability; religious beliefs, practices, or observance; or pregnancy? (Updated 5/15/23)\n\nAn employee who does not get vaccinated due to a disability (covered by the ADA) or a sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance (covered by Title VII) may be entitled to a reasonable accommodation that does not pose an undue hardship on the operation of the employer’s business. For example, as a reasonable accommodation, an unvaccinated employee entering the workplace might wear a face mask, work at a social distance from coworkers or non-employees, work a modified shift, get periodic tests for COVID-19 (provided testing is consistent with the ADA “business necessity” standard for medical examinations; see A.6.), be given the opportunity to telework, or finally, accept a reassignment.\n\nEmployees who choose not to be vaccinated because of pregnancy may be entitled (under Title VII) to adjustments to keep working, if the employer makes modifications or exceptions for other employees. These modifications may be the same as the accommodations made for an employee based on disability or religion.\n\nK.3. How can employers encourage employees and their family members to be vaccinated against COVID-19 without violating the EEO laws, especially the ADA and GINA? (Updated 10/13/21)\n\nEmployers may provide employees and their family members with information to educate them about COVID-19 vaccines, raise awareness about the benefits of vaccination, and address common questions and concerns. Employers also may work with local public health authorities, medical providers, or pharmacies to make vaccinations available for unvaccinated workers in the workplace. Also, under certain circumstances employers may offer incentives to employees who receive COVID-19 vaccinations, as discussed in K.16 - K.21. The federal government is providing COVID-19 vaccines at no cost to everyone 5 years of age and older.\n\nThere are many resources available to employees seeking more information about how to get vaccinated against COVID-19:\n\nThe federal government’s online vaccines.gov site can identify vaccination sites anywhere in the country (or https://www.vacunas.gov for Spanish). Individuals also can text their ZIP code to “GETVAX” (438829)–or “VACUNA” (822862) for Spanish–to find three vaccination locations near them.\n\nEmployees with disabilities (or employees’ family members with disabilities) may need extra support to obtain a vaccination, such as transportation or in-home vaccinations. The HHS/Administration for Community Living has launched the Disability Information and Assistance Line (DIAL) to assist individuals with disabilities in obtaining such help. DIAL can be reached at: 888-677-1199 from 9 am to 8 pm (Eastern Standard Time) Mondays through Fridays or by emailing DIAL@n4a.org.\n\nCDC’s website offers a link to a listing of local health departments, which can provide more information about local vaccination efforts.\n\nIn addition, CDC provides a complete communication “tool kit” for employers to use with their workforce to educate people about getting a COVID-19 vaccine. Although originally written for essential workers and employers, it is useful for all workers and employers. See Workplace Vaccination Program | CDC.\n\nSome employees may not have reliable access to the internet to identify nearby vaccination locations or may speak no English or have limited English proficiency and find it difficult to make an appointment for a vaccination over the phone. CDC operates a toll-free telephone line that can provide assistance in many languages for individuals seeking more information about vaccinations: 800-232-4636; TTY 888-232-6348.\n\nSome employees also may require assistance with transportation to vaccination sites. Employers may gather and disseminate information to their employees on low-cost and no-cost transportation resources serving vaccination sites available in their community and offer paid time-off for vaccination, particularly if transportation is not readily available outside regular work hours.\n\nEmployers should provide the contact information of a management representative for employees who need to request a reasonable accommodation for a disability or religious belief, practice, or observance, or to ensure nondiscrimination for an employee who is pregnant.\n\nThe ADA and COVID-19 Vaccinations\n\nK.4. Is information about an employee’s COVID-19 vaccination confidential medical information under the ADA? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nYes. The ADA requires an employer to maintain the confidentiality of employee medical information. Although the EEO laws do not prevent employers from requiring employees to provide documentation or other confirmation of vaccination, this information, like all medical information, must be kept confidential and stored separately from the employee’s personnel files under the ADA.\n\nAn employer may share confidential medical information, such as confirmation of employee vaccinations (or COVID-19 test results), with employees who need it to perform their job duties. However, such employees also must keep the information confidential. Some possible scenarios include:\n\nAn administrative employee assigned to perform recordkeeping of employees’ documentation of vaccination may receive needed access to the information for this purpose but must keep this information confidential.\n\nAn employee assigned to permit building entry only by employees who are in compliance with a work restriction, such as COVID-19 vaccinations, testing, and/or masking, should only receive a list of the individuals who may (or may not) enter, but not any confidential medical information about why they are on (or not on) the list.\n\nAn employee tasked to ensure compliance with a testing requirement for employees would need to review testing documentation submitted by those employees but must keep that testing information confidential.\n\nMandatory Employer Vaccination Programs\n\nK.5. May an employer require an employee to comply with a COVID-19 vaccination requirement applicable to all employees entering the workplace if that employee has sought an exemption based on disability? (Updated 7/12/22)\n\nUnder the ADA, an employer may require an individual with a disability to meet a qualification standard applied to all employees, such as a safety-related standard requiring COVID-19 vaccination, if the standard is job-related and consistent with business necessity as applied to that employee. An employer does not have to show that a qualification standard in general (i.e., as applied to all employees) meets the “business necessity” standard. Under the ADA it must satisfy this standard only as applied to an employee who informs the employer that a disability prevents compliance. If a particular employee cannot meet such a safety-related qualification standard because of a disability, the employer may not require compliance for that employee unless it can demonstrate that the individual would pose a “direct threat” to the health or safety of the employee or others while performing their job. A “direct threat” is a “significant risk of substantial harm” that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. 1630.2(r). This determination can be broken down into two steps: determining if there is a “significant risk of substantial harm” and, if there is, assessing whether a reasonable accommodation would reduce or eliminate the threat.\n\nTo determine if an employee who is not vaccinated due to a disability poses a “direct threat” in the workplace, an employer first must make an individualized assessment of the employee’s present ability to safely p"
