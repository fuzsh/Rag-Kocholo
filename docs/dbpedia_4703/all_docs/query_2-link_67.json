        "text": "There are so many things to do in Anaheim besides Disneyland. And I have nothing against Disneyland. It was so cool to see Disneyland park after having lived so long in Florida and visiting Walt Disney World so much. But there are definitely so many more things to do in Anaheim with kids that are outside the theme park walls. Keep reading below to fill up your Anaheim itinerary.\n\nDisclaimer: There are some links in this article that are affiliate links, which means that if you purchase through them, we receive a small commission. This is never an extra cost to you. Thanks for your support.\n\nThings to do in Anaheim with Kids\n\n1. Adventure City\n\nCost: $28.95 per person, Seniors 55+: $23.95\n\nAdvanced Online Ticket purchase is recommended\n\nParking is Free\n\nHours: Open weekends and select days during the week.\n\nSee Adventure City calendar for specific hours and dates\n\nThe first thing you will notice when you approach the sea foam green gates is a round building that looks like it’s out of a fairytale. Intricate bark patterns climb up the sides of the hut, with cartoon cutouts of bears playing on the front of the building. This is the Party Tree at Adventure City, a small theme park in the Stanton area of Anaheim.\n\nWith everything from roller coasters that wind through the trees to a petting zoo, this small amusement park tucked off State Route 39 is known for being quite a bit less busy than other theme parks in the area.\n\nThis makes it a great option for things to do in Anaheim besides Disneyland, especially if you don’t love the crowds. The park itself is beautifully kept, with efforts being made to incorporate nature into the design and theme of the park. The point of entry to the park is past the first gate and parking lot, to the right.\n\nAdventure City’s theme is like a fairytale out of a fantasy world, and the amount of detail in the park lends an immersive experience. Shops that are decorated to look like old saloons line the sides of the first parking lot. A lot of the rides are meant for young children, making it a great option for an activity to do in Anaheim with kids. The Rewind Racers ride is a favorite among local families. The ride begins by moving backward out of the boarding station and then rocketing forward.\n\n2. Camelot Golfland\n\nCost: starting at $14 for mini golf\n\n$36.99 for all attractions (mini golf, bumper cars/boats, laser tag, and race cars)\n\nOtherwise will need to purchase each attraction separately\n\nPurchase tickets online in advance to avoid increases in price as dates get closer\n\nHours: Open daily starting at 10am till 9pm or later\n\nCamelot Golfland is a spectacular choice when you’re spending time in Anaheim with your kids or family. There’s usually something for everyone at Camelot, with an arcade, laser tag, and mini golf to choose from. There are also bumper boats for rental and a few arcade-bowling lanes, making this a suitable place for children and teenagers alike. Sometimes you can’t handle standing in line all day, and Camelot shines through when finding things to do in Anaheim besides Disneyland, especially when you don’t have the patience to wait 90 minutes per ride!\n\nGolfland had water slides that unfortunately closed sometime in 2022. Some areas are a bit outdated and in need of renovation.\n\n3. The Adventure Lagoon\n\nCost: Age 6 and up: $35, Ages 3-5: $5, Ages 2 and under and 62 and older: Free\n\nObstacle Course, kayaks, and paddle boards are $10 each and rented separately and by the hour\n\nHours: Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays from ~10:30am to 6pm\n\nOpen seasonally from mid-May to October\n\nThe Adventure Lagoon is a family-friendly waterpark unlike any other you’ve ever seen. Most of the space in this water park is comprised of a man-made lake with water the color of aquamarine. That’s because the lake, the Miraloma Basin, is a recharging basin that has been utilized as an adventure theme park by the local water district—meaning the water is beautifully clear!\n\nBeach loungers and umbrellas line the sandy shores of the swimming hole in blue and white. However, the most incredible part of Adventure Lagoon is that on top of the water sits an inflatable water park. Slides, trampolines, and obstacle course segments all mingle together in the center of the lake. There is a full obstacle course that you can sign up to do sessions at, and guests are required to arrive 30 minutes early.\n\nThe Adventure Lagoon also offers things to do together like kayaking, paddle boarding, and other types of small non-motorized watercraft, making this a great choice for those in Anaheim with kids. The Lagoon is only open in the warmer months, and the attraction has featured a pumpkin patch during the off seasons in recent years. Visitors who elect to try the obstacle course must be at least 6 years old.\n\n4. Seascape Kids Fun\n\nCost: $12 for Ages 1-17 this includes one adult or child under age 1.\n\nAdditional adults or under age 1 children: $5 each\n\nHours: Open daily, but will need to check website for hours designated as open play\n\nSeascape Kids Fun is a colorful indoor playground for children that hosts both public play time and private parties. This one is definitely for the little ones, as the whole thing is centered around playpens, ball pits, inflatable slides, and more! From the moment you step into the lobby, you feel you’ve been whisked away to an underwater or beachside fantasy universe, underlined by different playrooms with different activities that can be reserved for private parties.\n\nThere is the aquarium-themed playroom with an inflatable obstacle course, an inflatable slide and bounce house, and a toddler section. The other playroom is called the Beach Ball playroom, and it’s also impressive. It boasts multi-level playground equipment with netting and slides. There are air cannons in the room that kids can use to shoot foam balls, and each playroom is equipped with a lounge area and vending machines for adults to relax and keep an eye on the kids. The facility also allows outside food and drink.\n\n5. Sky Zone Anaheim Indoor Trampoline Park\n\nCost: Unlimited all day pass $38.99, 90 minute pass $29.99\n\nHours: Open daily from 9am to 9pm with Friday and Saturdays 9am to 11pm\n\nLess than a mile away from the Seascape Kids Fun indoor playground is Sky Zone Trampoline Park. Don’t let the name fool you, as this facility is home to much more than just trampolines. One of the local favorites is the Wipeout game, where players use trampoline platforms to hop over rotating horizontal beams. Another crowd-pleaser is the Warped Wall, a close replica of the popular obstacle segment on the television show American Ninja Warrior.\n\nSky Zone also has a climbing wall with a foam pit at the bottom, so instead of being in a harness, you are climbing completely free-handed! Trampoline dodgeball and basketball are also available here, as well as a pit of foam cubes to practice stunts over. It’s an exciting family adventure for sure, and the perfect thing to do in Anaheim with kids of the right age.\n\n6. Muzeo\n\nCost: Ages 16 and up $10, Seniors and Ages 4-15 $7, Ages 3 and under: Free\n\nHours: Open Wednesday to Sunday 11am to 5pm\n\nClosed on Christmas Day, New Year’s Day, Juneteenth, 4th of July, and Thanksgiving. Special hours on Christmas Eve and New Years Eve 11am to 2pm\n\nIt can be hard to get children to focus on history, culture, and arts. Making visual learning a family experience leaves a significant impact on children and provides them with the opportunity to get excited and informed about history and heritage. Experience arts and culture at a museum for all ages that switches up the exhibits a few times per year with Muzeo. Everything from heritage to history to culture is explored and celebrated here at Carnegie Plaza where Muzeo is located.\n\nMuzeo is a great choice from this list of things to do in Anaheim with kids if you want to encourage their appreciation for the arts. Also on site is the Carnegie Gallery, housed in the historic Carnegie Library whose construction was funded completely by citizens of Anaheim in the very early 1900s. Street parking can be very tricky, but there is a parking garage close by on W Center Street Promenade across the street from Muzeo that makes it a hassle-free experience.\n\n7. Anaheim Ice - The Rinks\n\nCost: $16 for admission, $7 for skate rental, $17 for skate aid\n\nHours: Open daily, but you will need to check the calendar since public skate times vary by day\n\nSituated in a massive metal building on W Center Street Promenade is Anaheim Ice, formerly known as Disney Ice. It was an architectural concept that used to be the training place for the Anaheim Ducks, until 2019 when a different rink was selected. Now, it is used as a public ice-skating rink. Clumsy or not, the whole family can enjoy the rink, as the establishment offers balance support rentals in the shape of cute animals to help keep you upright! Although when ice skating, my daughter did better learning to skate without the aid. We found the aid to be a little difficult for her to learn proper skate technique.\n\nThere are a few arcade games here, but what truly shines through are all the things to do out on the ice itself.\n\nFree Things to do in Anaheim\n\nSometimes your wallet needs a little vacation, too. There are a lot of free things to do in Anaheim that will appeal to the whole family.\n\n8. Parks and Playgrounds\n\nOrange County is full of many great hiking trails, parks, playgrounds, and places to explore, and Anaheim is a perfect example of that. With over 40 parks and playgrounds to choose from, and free activities happening constantly, you’ll never have to worry about getting bored of looking at the same trails over and over again.\n\nOak Canyon Nature Center\n\nThe Oak Canyon Nature Center in Anaheim is jam-packed with things to do and see. With acres and acres of trails to explore and many different hosted things to do, the Oak Canyon Nature Center is an incredible place to start if you’re looking for free things to do in Anaheim. Discover the local flora and fauna with your family as you traverse the trails and keep an eye out for trail critters.\n\nAnaheim Founders Park\n\nRight next to Anaheim High School is Anaheim Founders Park. As you pull into the pink cobblestone driveway, you’ll pass an unmistakable Moreton Fig Tree that was imported from Australia. The huge fig tree is a historic landmark, and two historical houses sit in the middle of this unique park that serves as an homage to the history of Anaheim.\n\n9. Downtown Disney District\n\nCost: Free admission and parking\n\nHours: Open daily from 9am or 10am till 10pm to 12am\n\nYou will need to check individual stores for store hours\n\nThe Downtown Disney District is next to Disneyland but gets a pass for this article on things to do in Anaheim. That’s because it’s situated just outside the gates of Disneyland and California Adventures. Downtown Disney opened in 2001, is free to enter, and is open to the public. It’s an upscale shopping center that fits the overall theme of Disney, with the atmosphere being the same as it is inside the park but without the cost of admission.\n\nThis shopping district offers everything from retail adventures and live entertainment to dining and novelties. This area is a must-see for those who want the short version of a Disney visit without breaking the bank on park tickets for the whole family. There are tons of accessory shops to choose from and even a Lovepop 3D card shop. Don’t forget to stop by the caricaturist to get your portrait drawn!\n\n10. Anaheim Packing District - Anaheim Packing House\n\nCost: Free admission and parking\n\nHours: You will need to check individual restaurants, but mainly starting at lunch hours\n\nLocated in a renovated 1900’s citrus packing building, this place is a foodie’s paradise. Imagine a mall with only a few shops and an extra large food court, but with every type of cuisine featured here. There are a good deal of vegan options available here as well. Gluten free is a different story, and if you are both gluten free and dairy free, you may not be able to find food to accommodate both of those allergies here. You would likely need to call each place to confirm this.\n\nThe Anaheim Packing District often hosts live music or DJs from Thursdays through Sundays.

Here you will find more restaurants than stores, but also with much more areas of entertainment. Like Meeples, a board game cafe fun for the whole family to enjoy, an AMC movie theater, a bowling alley, an escape room, and more.\n\nSimilar to Disney Springs in Orlando, Florida, you’ll also find at the GardenWalk, the Anaheim House of Blues for live music performances.

Bowling Alleys in Anaheim\n\nSplitsville in Downtown Disney\n\nConcourse Bowling Center\n\nLinbrook Bowling Center Incorporated\n\nBowlero Anaheim at Anaheim GardenWalk\n\nAnother fun pastime for adults and kids alike is bowling. Here in Anaheim there are a number of bowling alleys to choose from. Obviously, I'll always be biased for Disney, because I'm so used to their amazing service here in Florida. At Downtown Disney Anaheim, you'll find Splitsville Luxury Lanes. With 20 lanes, live entertainment all year long, and a full menu of food that can be tailored somewhat to those with gluten sensitivities, this would be my first choice for bowling.\n\nThe other 3 bowling alleys are located across Anaheim, so would recommend whichever one is closest to where you are staying or your stops during your visit.\n\nDisclaimer: There are some links in this article that are affiliate links, which means that if you purchase through them, we receive a small commission.
