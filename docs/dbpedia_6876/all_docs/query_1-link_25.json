        "text": "There is a growing movement among Indigenous peoples to assert a right to “Indigenous data sovereignty,” and yet, the term “data sovereignty” is not widely understood. What does it mean to control the collection, use and management of information in an era of “Big Data,” in which digital technology transforms knowledge into electronic form, to be freely used and traded, and, sometimes even commodified? More importantly, what are the interests of Native nations and other Indigenous peoples in these topics? Is political status tied to governance authority? If so, who controls the terms of data sovereignty—the Indigenous nation or the nation-state? This essay discusses tribal claims to data sovereignty and informational privacy, examining the nature of the respective claims, as well as how tribal governments can exercise effective authority over the collection and use of data about the community and its members. This is a complex and multifaceted inquiry, and this essay provides only a...\n\nData about Indigenous populations in the United States are inconsistent and irrelevant. Federal and state governments and researchers direct most collection, analysis, and use of data about U.S. Indigenous populations. Indigenous Peoples’ justified mistrust further complicates the collection and use of these data. Nonetheless, tribal leaders and communities depend on these data to inform decision making. Reliance on data that do not reflect tribal needs, priorities, and self-conceptions threatens tribal self-determination. Tribal data sovereignty through governance of data on Indigenous populations is long overdue. This article provides two case studies of the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and their demographic and socioeconomic data initiatives to create locally and culturally relevant data for decision making.\n\nThe central thesis of this essay is to identify and discuss salient principles of geographic information systems technology as an instrument used to serve as one of several means of support for decision-making processes in the civil, political, economic, and environmental affairs of indigenous cultures. There are four ways of communicating information that when collectively assembled may be considered the foundation for the human species' ability to recognize and understand one's actual (personal) existence, and by extension, advance knowledge among civil societies. The methods of communication include written language, spoken language, mathematical or computational language, and graphical language. Each has its place in advancing an understanding for the affairs of organized societies, cultures, and the means by which people of privilege exercise power over the masses through surveillance, identification, and control of natural and human-derived resources.\n\nThis Article offers a new perspective on the challenges of the modern American Indian land tenure system. While some property theorists have renewed focus on isolated aspects of Indian land tenure, including the historic inequities of colonial takings of Indian lands, this Article argues that the complexity of today’s federally imposed reservation property system does much of the same colonizing work that historic Indian land policies—from allotment to removal to termination—did overtly. But now, these inequities are largely overshadowed by the daunting complexity of the whole land tenure structure. This Article introduces a new taxonomy of complexity in American Indian land tenure and explores in particular how the recent trend of hypercategorizing property and sovereignty interests into ever-more granular and interacting jurisdictional variables has exacerbated development and self-governance challenges in Indian country. This structural complexity serves no adequate purpose for I...\n\nInter-governmental relationships involving tribes must be respectful of tribal sovereignty and native people’s rights, yet most non-Native public managers are not educated about this and thus are unprepared to engage constructively in collaboration with tribal governments. This chapter provides a basic orientation to tribal sovereignty, self-determination, reservations and ceded territories, and Public Law 280, and illuminates their relevance to nearly any policy domain, including child welfare, education, economic development, land use and planning, environmental stewardship, and law enforcement. While there are positive examples of constructive and mutually respectful synergy, unfortunately there are also many instances of antagonistic failures to collaborate, with damaging consequences for Native and non-Native communities. I illustrate these complex dynamics through a single policy issue – roadway safety in reservations – before concluding with a summary of a few key takeaways for exploring collaboration with tribal governments. KEYWORDS ● Tribal sovereignty ● Indigenous governance ● Tribes and intergovernmental relationships ● Native self-determination ● American Indian reservations ● Roadway safety in reservations\n\nOpen data is a site of tension for Indigenous peoples. Open data provides opportunities for sustainable development according to Indigenous aspirations, yet also sits at the nexus of current and historic data challenges as a result of colonisation, bias, and a lack of knowledge of Indigenous rights. Indigenous data sovereignty (IDS) provides a framework for maximising the benefit of open data for Indigenous peoples and other users of Indigenous data and for affecting the stewardship of all data.\n\nThis Article offers a new perspective on the challenges of the modern American Indian land tenure system.
