        "text": "Now you can live stream to the world! Blackmagic Web Presenter is a complete streaming solution that includes a professional hardware streaming engine for direct streaming via Ethernet to YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and more! It’s just like a modern broadcast television transmitter for a new global streaming audience! Plus the built in USB connections work like a webcam, so you can connect a computer and use any streaming software, or even Skype or Zoom. For redundancy, you can stream to the internet via Ethernet or connect a 5G or 4G phone to use mobile data! Web Presenter also includes a technical monitoring output that includes video, audio meters, trend graphs and even SDI technical data!\n\nBlackmagic Web Presenter supports the most popular streaming platforms. Plus the built in hardware streaming engine has been designed for live streaming at professional broadcast quality. That means you get a self contained solution for live streaming that works without dropped frames. You only need to connect it to the internet! Setup is easy, as the Web Presenter Utility software lets you select the streaming platform and update the streaming key. The utility works on Mac and Windows and connects directly via USB or remotely via Ethernet. If you're technically minded, you can even manually update the XML settings file to change specific settings or to add new streaming platforms.\n\nFacebook makes it easy to share live streams with friends and professional networks. This means as you start your live stream, the number of viewers can multiply dramatically as each viewer can share your show with others via their social networks. Viewer counts can keep growing as you live stream!\n\nTwitter supports live streaming so you can create live content that you can broadcast across the globe. You can use Blackmagic Web Presenter as the source input for your Twitter video stream then tweet out the link to your audience and let them start watching.\n\nWith an audience of over 10 million daily viewers, Twitch is the world’s leading streaming video platform and community for gamers. Blackmagic Web Presenter lets you stream in incredible quality so you can broadcast via Twitch and share gameplay with friends and fans around the world!\n\nBlackmagic Web Presenter is a self contained solution that includes a powerful hardware encoder, software for connecting to streaming platforms, and network connections. That means you don’t need to buy an expensive computer or use complicated streaming software. Simply connect an SDI video source such as a live production switcher or a camera, then connect to the internet using the built in Ethernet connection. Or plug in a mobile phone to use mobile data! With settings built in for popular streaming platforms, you simply need to enter a streaming key and press on air! Plus you can simultaneously use the USB webcam output to connect to a computer, allowing other video software to be used!\n\nIf you're streaming from a remote location, or you need a backup for the main Ethernet connection, you can plug in an Apple or Android phone to connect to the internet via mobile data. For convenience, there are USB connections on both the front and rear panel that can be used for tethering phones. Plus it works with the latest high speed 5G phones, as well as 4G phones! Blackmagic Web Presenter will auto detect when a phone is connected and switch its internet connection to use it. You can select Ethernet or phone priority, which makes phone internet backup fully automatic. Plus, by using phone tethering and mobile data, Web Presenter becomes the perfect remote location streaming solution!\n\nBlackmagic Web Presenter features two USB connections that operate as a simple webcam source. That means you can plug into any computer and work with any video software. The software is tricked into thinking the web presenter is a common webcam, but it's really a broadcast quality SDI video source! That guarantees compatibility with any video software in full resolution 1080 HD or even 2160p Ultra HD quality, depending on the model! Imagine connecting web presenter to a camera and then Skype or Zoom calling your client with live video of a shoot! Web Presenter works with any video software including Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Skype, Open Broadcaster, XSplit Broadcaster and more\n\nTraditional broadcast transmitters are critical equipment in a television station, however now the streaming server is just as critical because millions of viewers can be watching globally! To help, Blackmagic Web Presenter includes a feature rich technical monitoring output. The graphics based monitoring output includes a video view, audio meters with accurate ballistics, trend graphs for codec data rates and cache fill, plus a summary of the streaming settings and detailed SDI technical information. Plus the technical monitoring output works in full 1080 HD and outputs to both SDI and HDMI. That means you can use an SDI router for monitoring multiple units, or connect a simple HDMI TV!\n\nThe Blackmagic Web Presenter Utility software provides a single place to manage multiple web presenters and to update the settings and software. Simply plug directly into the front of the web presenter’s USB connection, or connect using Ethernet so you can configure remotely, which is important when you're managing multiple remote sites. The familiar menus and controls make it very easy to set up a live event, so you can get started fast! Plus the front panel LCD menus have the same settings and controls! You can even load additional services for ATEM Streaming Bridge. The Blackmagic Web Presenter Utility software is included free and runs on both Mac and Windows platforms.\n\nBlackmagic Web Presenter includes a 12G‑SDI input with support for all HD and Ultra HD formats up to 2160p60. A 12G‑SDI loop output is included enabling you to loop video through more than one web presenter, so you can stream to multiple services. Blackmagic Web Presenter features Teranex conversion technology on the SDI input for incredibly clean looking video. Blackmagic Web Presenter takes the incoming HD or Ultra HD input signal and automatically converts it to high quality, low data rate 1080p HD or high resolution 2160p60 Ultra HD depending on the model, which is then sent to the hardware encoder for streaming. All this means you can use any HD or Ultra HD source for streaming!\n\nSerious broadcasters love redundancy because it increases reliability. Blackmagic Web Presenter includes redundant features to help ensure you stay online. You get dual internet connections, so you can connect to the internet using the built in Ethernet or a tethered phone for 5G or 4G mobile data. Plus the internet automatically switches in case of an outage! Or you can use 2 separate units to stream to both the primary and secondary YouTube servers. With both AC and DC inputs, you can use a broadcast battery pack for redundant power. There are even front panel buttons and menus, plus the Blackmagic Web Presenter Utility software for control.\n\nWhile Blackmagic Web Presenter can send video to a wide range of streaming services, it can also be used as a private broadcast SDI video link between studios! The ATEM Streaming Bridge is a video converter that lets you receive the H.264 stream from Blackmagic Web Presenter and then convert it back to SDI video. This means you can send video between remote locations across your local Ethernet network, or via the internet globally! That's all possible due to the built in H.264 hardware codec that decodes the Web Presenter stream. Imagine setting up multiple television studios and using ATEM Streaming Bridge and Web Presenter for video links between sites.\n\nBlackmagic Web Presenter is based on the modular Teranex Mini design allowing desktop or rack use. It includes a built in AC power supply, plus a 4 pin 12V DC connection for backup power or battery operation. The extremely portable design is only 5.5 inches wide, which means you can mount 3 in a single rack unit, perfect when you need to stream to multiple independent services all at the same time. Plus you can combine Blackmagic Web Presenter with other products such as the ATEM 1 M/E Constellation HD switcher for a live production and streaming solution in a single rack unit. The front panel includes a USB connection, so you can plug in a computer for quick local setting changes."
