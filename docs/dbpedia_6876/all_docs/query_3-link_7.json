        "text": "You can select which Pearl Mini channel is used for scheduled and ad hoc webcasting events. Optionally, you can stream the event to a secondary backup stream URL.\n\nWhen a webcasting event is scheduled in Kaltura or started from Pearl Mini as an unscheduled ad hoc event, the stream URL and other event settings are sent to Pearl Mini. The Kaltura ingestion settings are applied automatically to Pearl Mini.\n\nWhen you create a Kaltura webcasting event on Pearl Mini, you have the option to use the primary and backup URLs supplied by Kaltura for the stream or to choose a stream destination that is created locally for the channel on Pearl Mini. Alternative streaming destinations must already be configured for the channel being webcast. Select the Auto option to use the primary and backup URLs supplied by Kaltura. Auto is the default setting.\n\nEnsure that you have selected the channel on Pearl Mini that you want to use for your scheduled webcasting event well in advanced of the event start time. The first channel on Pearl Mini is selected by default.\n\nWhen it's time for the scheduled webcasting event to start, Pearl Mini automatically sends an RTMP (or RTMPS) stream to the primary URL associated with that event. If you've enabled the backup stream, Pearl Mini sends an RTMP stream to both the primary URL and the secondary backup URL associated with that event. If the primary URL stream fails for any reason, Kaltura automatically switches over to the backup URL.\n\nThe channel you're streaming should have at least one layout, see Create a channel. For the correct encoding settings to use for the channel, see Kaltura's requirements.\n\nDuring the webcast, you can switch layouts using Pearl Mini for a more dynamic live broadcast. For information about creating layouts for a channel and switching, see: Custom layout configuration.\n\nImportant considerations\n\nEnsure that the same audio sources are selected on each layout if the channel is configured with multiple layouts for live switching.\n\nSelect channels and URLs for scheduled webcasting events using the Admin panel\n\nLog in to the Admin panel as admin, see Connect to the Admin panel."
