Web Video Caster doesn't perform any video/audio decoding or transcoding.\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nWeb Video Castâ¢ is a browser, which allows you to stream videos of movies, TV shows, and other media from the internet to a streaming device or smart tv. Web Video Caster grabs the video URL inside the web page, sends it to the streaming device (i.e. Chromecast or DLNA device), and then plays the video directly from the content provider. This ultimately saves your mobile deviceâs battery. It also detects subtitles on the web page. Web Video Castâ¢ does not host these videos. This is not a mirroring app.\n\nGET STARTED\n\nFollow these simple step-by-step instructions to start streaming:\n\n1. Find a video online that you want to watch.\n\n2. Make sure this video can play on mobile browsers without Flash.\n\n3. Connect to your streaming device.\n\n4. Play the video as you normally would. Or, click the play button on the toolbar.\n\nPREMIUM FEATURES**\n\nâ¢ No in-app advertising\n\nâ¢ Most visited sites\n\nâ¢ Bookmarks\n\nâ¢ Set homepage\n\n**This functionality does not apply universally to all streaming devices.\n\nLIMITATIONS & DISCLOSURES\n\nAs with all apps, there are some limitations we are aware of and want you to know about up front.\n\nâ¢ We are in no way associated with any web media providers and we do not have control over the content they provide.\n\nâ¢ Web Video Caster does not support nor play Flash or FLV videos.\n\nâ¢ The app does not support tab casting, like the Chromecast extension for the PC web browser.\n\nâ¢ We cannot do anything to fix issues that arise on the server side (media content provider) such as failure to play or buffering, which is especially common during heavy load times and weekends.\n\nSHARE YOUR FEEDBACK\n\nWe are committed to open communication with our users. Please contact us first with any questions or support issues before leaving a review. We will respond and address your concern promptly.
