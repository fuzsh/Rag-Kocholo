        "text": "Today, video is king. Statistics consistently show that people are watching less TV and are watching more videos online. For example, it’s been shown that 44% of people watch less TV because they’re watching live videos instead. Furthermore, more than 80% of audiences prefer to watch live videos over reading blogs.\n\nThese trends mean that businesses and professionals should focus on the power of video. By capitalizing on the trend toward more video consumption, they can maximize their viewership and expand their brand. Fortunately, it’s never been easier to capitalize on live-streaming video. And there are many professional live-streaming solutions to help.\n\nIn this post, we teach you how to embed and integrate live video on your website. We also go into further detail about the importance of video content today. Furthermore, we tell you the top 3 mistakes to avoid when embedding live-streaming videos so you can provide your viewers with a seamless experience.\n\n*This post reflects the most up-to-date information as of 2024.\n\nWhat is Video Embedding?\n\nBenefits of Embedding a Video on Your Website\n\nThe Importance of Video Content on Your Website\n\nHow Does Video Embedding Work?\n\nHow to Embed Live Streaming Video on Your Website\n\nHow to Embed Live Videos on Popular Website Builders\n\nHow to Embed a Video Player on Social Media\n\nEmbedding Video for Mobile Devices and Desktops\n\nTop 3 Mistakes To Avoid When Embedding Live Streaming Video on Your Website\n\nConclusion\n\nWhat is Video Embedding?\n\nEmbedding videos from a hosting platform instead of YouTube or another free streaming service gives you more control over your content.\n\nVideo embedding means adding a live stream or a video player to your website using an online video platform. For many live-stream websites or social media platforms, it is as simple as copying and pasting a link.\n\nYou can use free tools like YouTube to embed videos on your live-streaming website. However, such free tools carry limitations for embedding live video content on your website, making them not the best solution for video for embedding a live show.\n\nA few drawbacks to using YouTube for live stream hosting and embedding:\n\nLost Traffic: YouTube pulls traffic from your site and back to YouTube through the related videos shown at the end of the video. YouTube isn’t designed to keep viewers on your live-streaming website.\n\nUnprofessional Appearance: YouTube has its branding on the overlays and watermarks, and any video embedded from YouTube to your live streaming website will have a “Watch on YouTube button.” Your branding is not featured at all.\n\nNo Customer Support: YouTube’s customer support is almost non-existent, so if a live stream link doesn’t work or if the streaming quality isn’t up to mark, you will have to troubleshoot on your own.\n\nArbitrary Rules: YouTube has arbitrary content guidelines. If YouTube decides they don’t like your content or message, it can be deleted from your channel and your live-streaming website via the YouTube embed link.\n\nAdvertisements: YouTube can run advertisements on any of its video content. You don’t control the advertisements that run on your content. That can ruin the overall experience and lower the standard of your content.\n\nLess Control: Maintaining an impressive live viewer count is one of many metrics showing how your video content is performing. You get much less control over elements such as streaming quality or ads with YouTube.\n\nUsing professional video hosting platforms gives you much more control over your content. Since you own the content, you can remove the host’s branding. You also don’t have to worry about following any of YouTube’s strict guidelines or about your content being deleted without your permission.\n\nVideo embedding is fairly easy as long as your live-streaming website design is compatible with the type of live-streaming video you want to set up. You can easily embed live streaming videos or clips from your past live streams directly on your website or live streaming app.\n\nBenefits of Embedding a Video on Your Website\n\nThere are two primary ways to place videos on your website or a landing page. You can either link or embed videos.\n\nWhen you embed a video on your live stream website, visitors can watch it without leaving the web page they are on.\n\nWhen you link a video on a live stream website, visitors must click on the link, redirecting them to the web page where the video is hosted.\n\nThere are distinct advantages from both a user experience and SEO standpoint to embedding videos instead of linking to them:\n\nOptimized Viewing Experience: You can optimize the video for online viewing with an embed code. When you directly embed a live stream on your live streaming website , you can adjust the video’s frame size, height, and width to ensure optimal viewing on your website.\n\nCustomize Start Time: You can customize the video’s start time with an embedded code. That allows you to direct viewers to a specific start time within your video content.\n\nKeep Users on Your Site: Learning how to embed the live stream on the website, you keep viewers on your website instead of linking to another site. That’s especially true if you use a private video hosting service instead of a free video hosting platform to embed your live-stream videos.\n\nHelp SEO: If you want to improve your search engine optimization, embedding videos is one of the best ways to achieve this goal. It is easier to rank when you have both text and video on your own website.\n\nIncrease Engagement: On your own live streaming website, you can monitor numbers such as live viewer count. It’s useful information that tells you how each live stream performs. People like to watch videos; creating a video library on video streaming websites and adding videos directly to your live streaming website allows for increased user engagement on your website. It’s also easier to engage and excite your viewers for your upcoming content through your own live-streaming site\n\nNarrows Down Your Target Audience: Knowing what to make is more important than creating an extensive video library. Viewers who log onto their own live-streaming website can live-stream videos and leave something more important behind viewer data. This data is how you learn about your target audience and the type of content they are most interested in. That’s how you can narrow down your webpage‘s focus and create live events around the topics your viewers care the most about.\n\nEasier to Manage: managing your live streaming site, means you can easily manage and streamline different video categories such as past live streams, subscription video on demand, and short clips, as well as promote your next live streaming session without having to pay extra to third-party websites. Your viewers can access all your content through your live-streaming site or live-streaming app\n\nInstead of linking to videos hosted on other sites, embedding videos allows you to create a custom video experience, keep viewers on your website, increase direct engagement, and assist with your SEO.\n\nThe Importance of Video Content for Your Website\n\nBefore learning how to first embed a live video on your website, it is important to understand the value of live video content for your business.\n\nMarketing: Video is one of the primary online marketing tools. 71% of B2B businesses and 61% of B2C businesses use videos as a marketing tool. 87% of marketers that use marketing videos report an increase in website traffic due to video content; hence it offers a great ROI.\n\nVideo Increases SEO Ranking: Regarding SEO rankings, video content is 50x more likely to rank than text posts. Putting text and video content together is a great way to improve the rankings of your web pages.\n\nVideo Boosts Engagement: 9 out of 10 viewers want to see more videos from the brands and businesses they engage with. The average person spends around 100 minutes per day watching videos online. Why not cash in on that potential by creating subscription video-on-demand content?\n\nVideo Has Higher Retention Rates: Compared to written content (10-20% retention rates), visual content, such as videos and live stream videos, has a much higher retention rate (65%). Videos also have a higher impact, especially if you use them to show your brand’s personality or testimonials.\n\nVideo Is What the People Want: A HubSpot report showed that approximately 53% of people want websites to include more video content. It’s essential for eCommerce business websites because around 88% of customers claim that they buy products because the video convinces them.\n\nInterested in more information on the state of online video streaming? Read our streaming statistics post to learn about current online streaming trends.\n\nHow Does Video Embedding Work?\n\nVideo embedding works by adding a snippet of code, which is referred to as an “embed code,” from your video streaming website to the code of your website. It allows you to integrate and set up live streaming video on your website.\n\nTo set up an embedded video player, Dacast’s video hosting software generates two types of embed codes: iFrame and JS. Which one you choose depends on your unique streaming setup\n\nJS Embed Code\n\nThe JS embed code is the default embed code for Dacast, and it supports most features. That includes being responsive if the elements are sized differently on the video hosting platform than on the website. It also works with referrer restriction features.\n\niFrame Embed Code\n\nThe iFrame embed code is the most universally compatible. The caveat is that some features do not work with it. This embed code is not responsive, which means it’s a fixed size.\n\nThe full-screen feature is also sometimes removed. It usually only happens if you’re using iFrames within iFrames. The URL-based referrer restriction feature does not work with the iframe embed.\n\nThe JS embed code is more responsive; however, the iFrame embed code is more universally compatible.\n\nHow to Embed Live Streaming Video on Your Website\n\nYou can embed videos on your site without any proficiency in coding.\n\nIt is not difficult to embed video on your website, but it requires a few different tools and a little know-how.\n\nLet’s look at how you can embed a video player on your website in 5 simple steps. These steps are the same for embedding live video or video-on-demand content.\n\n1. Choose a Live Streaming Platform\n\nThe first step in embedding a live video on your website is investing in a live streaming platform. With countless streaming services available now, this can be a daunting task for broadcasters. This tool is used to manage and host all of your video content. Many of these live streaming websites also support monetization, security, and more.\n\nSome of the top live streaming platforms include:\n\nVidyard\n\n(by Vimeo)\n\nKaltura\n\nBrightcove\n\nAgain, YouTube and Vimeo are two free alternatives. These options are minimal in terms of features and capabilities, but they can be helpful for broadcasters with limited budgets.\n\nUsing a professional live streaming platform offers some distinct advantages, such as:\n\nCustom video player experience with white-label features\n\nTop-tier content delivery network (CDN) for professional live streaming quality\n\nVideo monetization options\n\nLive streaming APIs that allow you to manage your content how you want\n\nAdvanced live video analytics so you can get real-time feedback on the success of your streams\n\nFor more information on choosing a video streaming website to host your stream, please check out our live streaming platform comparison post.\n\n2. Create a Live Channel\n\nOnce you’ve chosen a professional live streaming platform, it is time to create a live channel.\n\nTo do so in Dacast:\n\nClick the purple “Add +” button in the menu on the left.\n\nSelect “Live Stream”\n\nWhen the window pops up, add a title and select “Standard” as your stream type.\n\nClick “Create”\n\nNow you have created a live channel on Dacast to host your live stream. You need to create a live channel before creating an embed code that you can use to stream on your website.\n\n3. Generate an Embed Code\n\nLive streaming websites like Dacast allow you to manually embed streaming content on your website by providing the embed codes needed to make this possible.\n\nDacast makes it exceptionally easy for users to create embedded players on their sites and broadcast live video streams.\n\nSTEP 1: To get started, log in to your Dacast account. Find the video you want to embed and click the “Edit” button:\n\nSTEP 2: Navigate to the “Sharing” section under the “General” tab and copy the “Embed Code”:\n\nThere are two types of embed codes available: JS (Javascript) and iframe. We recommend using the JS embed code because it’s more universally compatible with the full-screen feature.\n\nThe JS embed code is also a requirement for the URL referral restriction feature to work (which restricts content based on the websites allowed to host it). That said, the iFrame embed code is more compatible with and/or required for some frameworks, including WordPress and WIX.\n\nSTEP 3: Once you have selected your embed code type, the last thing you have to do is insert it into your website. It will not look the same for everybody assuming you have access to edit at the HTML level. It will look something like this:\n\nIf you go to the “General” tab and navigate to “Sharing,” you will also see a “Share Link” option.\n\nThat’s not an embed code but a link that allows you to share directly with viewers or your social networks. The link will direct viewers to a page with a video player where they can watch your video; it will not direct them to your website.\n\nIf you have questions about video embed or need help with this Dacast feature, feel free to contact us directly.\n\n4. Paste the Embed Code\n\nFind the place on your site where you’d like to embed the video player. Open the HTML editor, and paste the embed code you copied from your OVP.\n\nPreview the changes to make sure the code is working properly.\n\nUsing domain restrictions or signed embed codes, you can also share videos privately to ensure that your videos are only accessible on websites you own. This feature is available with many professional video CMS platforms, protecting your content even when you use a third-party live streaming website\n\n5. Save Your Changes\n\nSave the changes, and publish the page or post you’ve edited. Again, test out the live site to make sure that your embedded video player has correctly set up.\n\nIt is a good idea to test run your live video stream before your broadcast is expected to start.\n\nNow you know how to use Dacast to embed video directly on your website.\n\nHow to Embed Streaming Video on Popular Website Builders\n\nYou can embed videos on your website quite easily if you are using a drag-and-drop website builder.

They’re a great example of live events that can stream on your website because, on top of streaming sports, they also have other channels for education and news live streaming.\n\nMusic Live Streaming\n\nTV-Polmusic, headquartered in New Jersey, highlights Polish music artists. They have an embedded video player that streams music videos live to a global audience.\n\nLive Lectures Streaming\n\nGresham College is a college located in London that doesn’t enroll students but instead offers free lectures to the public. They now embed live streams of their lectures directly on their live streaming site.\n\nHow to Embed a Video Player on Social Media\n\nWhether you want to use social media streaming services platforms like Facebook Live for live streaming sports or simply to host a live webinar training for your business, the ability to embed live stream content onto social media is vital in today’s world.\n\nDespite its live streaming limitations, social media is considered a tried-and-true way to gain viewers and grow a following for your broadcasts.\n\nYou can share one of these identical embed codes on Facebook and Twitter to give access to your live broadcast or video-on-demand. You can locate this code in your video content’s “PUBLISH SETTINGS” section.\n\nPlease note that Facebook Live has restricted its option to live stream directly on the platform. Therefore, if you want to live stream on the Facebook platform, please check out this tutorial for information on working with all encoders supporting multi-destination streaming on Facebook Live\n\nEmbedding Live Stream Video for Mobile Devices and Desktops\n\nEmbedding live streaming videos to your desktop or mobile sites can be done without any proficiency in coding, as the iFrame code is provided for you.\n\nWith Dacast and most other video streaming platforms, broadcasters don’t have to worry about writing the correct embed code because the software generates code for you, making embedding live video easy.\n\nYou can copy and paste the iFrame or JS embed code directly into the HTML of your website. This method works well for both mobile and desktop sites. It’s a perk because watching videos on mobile devices has a rocky history.\n\nAdobe’s Flash Media Player was the standard for playing videos for many years. This trend shifted with the advent of smartphones, specifically the iPhone, in 2007. Apple’s iOS operating system has never supported—and likely will never support— Flash technology.\n\nSteve Jobs released a public statement about the technical flaws of Flash Media Player. He noted these flaws as why he didn’t use Flash for Apple’s iOS. This announcement created controversy and heavy speculation. There were many theories about Jobs’s motivations. However, shortly after that, Apple launched the HTTP Live Streaming Protocol to coincide with the debut of the iPhone 3.\n\nFlash has declined ever since, especially for mobile operating systems. A few years later, Android followed suit by ditching Adobe Flash. As a result, Dacast and other live streaming platforms in the live streaming industry now integrate HTML5 into our embed codes. This feature helps you to create embedded players with compatibility across most devices\n\nHow to Improve an Embedded Live Video\n\nAfter following all the steps to correctly embed live streams on a website, the last thing you want is a lagging video with shaky audio. To improve the video quality of your live stream, you should know about encoders.\n\nAn encoder, among many benefits, makes your videos and live streaming session look more professional. It also stabilizes streaming when there’s an unreliable internet connection.\n\nThere are two types of encoders available: hardware and software. Using a streaming software or hardware encoder depends on your brand’s goals.\n\nHardware encoders are generally more costly than software encoders but are known for their speed. Besides price, another advantage of software encoders is that you get instant access to streaming software updates, whereas updating physical hardware is a lot harder.\n\nIf you’re just getting started with encoders, the open-source encoder OBS Studio is a good option known for its simplicity.\n\nTop 3 Mistakes To Avoid When Embedding Live Streaming Video on Your Website\n\nAlthough the process for embedding live video in all the popular website builders is relatively straightforward, there’s still room for mistakes. Here are the top three ones you should avoid:\n\nPrivacy setting: Confirm that the privacy settings of your live video are the same as that of your website page. That’ll ensure that all your website visitors can view the live video. For example, if you’ve put your live video behind a paywall for premium users, then make sure that your website page is also for that specific audience, so other users don’t run into any issues, such as being unable to watch the video.\n\nUpdate the page: Remember to update your page when/if you delete the live video. If your video goes down for whatever reason, the page will show an error of a broken link and negatively affect the user experience. It happens a lot with YouTube videos that are removed by the admin or deleted by the network due to policy violations.\n\nCheck your plug-ins: Make sure you don’t have a plug-in on your website that prevents you from embedding videos in your website. The “Disable Embeds” plug-in on the WordPress site is an example of such a plug-in.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we’ve shown, setting up embedding live streams and videos on your website is easy. And the benefits of embedding live streams and videos on your website can have tremendous benefits.\n\nWhile it’s easy to capitalize on the power of video, there are some common mistakes you should avoid, as we’ve noted. To make things easier, professional streaming services are available. Using one, you’ll greatly increase the chances of making your video streaming project a success.\n\nUsing Dacast’s professional streaming solution, you can begin hosting your video content today. With Dacast, embedding codes is quick and easy. With a broad suite of powerful tools and features, you can stream on your website, stream a live event and so much more in minutes.\n\nTry for free now"
