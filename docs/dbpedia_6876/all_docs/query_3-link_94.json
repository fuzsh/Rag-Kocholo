The secondary sources are the screen you are sharing or a PowerPoint file you are using. You can use multiple secondary sources at once. Ticking the Capture PowerPoint option will add the slides and text to the recording when the session has ended. Ticking the Capture Main Screen option will record the screen, including the PowerPoint file you are using, as well as any other content you are showing such as websites or other applications. If you wish to show content such as YouTube video through your browser in the session, be sure to also tick the Capture Computer Audio option so that the sound from the video can be heard.\n\nUsers viewing on a mobile device will not be able to view any content except for the primary source (camera / webcam) if set up in this way. To accommodate users viewing the webcast on a mobile device, you must use the suggested mobile setup options."
