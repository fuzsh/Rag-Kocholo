        "text": "Pearl Nano's channel is automatically selected for scheduled and ad hoc webcasting events. However, you can choose to stream the event to the secondary backup stream URL using the Admin panel.\n\nWhen a webcasting event is scheduled in Kaltura or started from Pearl Nano as an unscheduled ad hoc event, the stream URL and other event settings are sent to Pearl Nano. The Kaltura ingestion settings are applied automatically to Pearl Nano.\n\nWhen you create a Kaltura webcasting event on Pearl Nano, you have the option to use the primary and backup URLs supplied by Kaltura for the stream or to choose a stream destination that is created locally for the channel on Pearl Nano. Alternative streaming destinations must already be configured for the channel being webcast. Select the Auto option to use the primary and backup URLs supplied by Kaltura. Auto is the default setting.\n\nWhen it's time for the scheduled webcasting event to start, Pearl Nano automatically sends an RTMP (or RTMPS) stream to the primary URL associated with that event. If you've enabled the backup stream, Pearl Nano sends an RTMP stream to both the primary URL and the secondary backup URL associated with that event. If the primary URL stream fails for any reason, Kaltura automatically switches over to the backup URL.\n\nSet up the channel and URLs for scheduled webcasting events using the Admin panel\n\nLog in to the Admin panel as admin, see Connect to the Admin panel."
