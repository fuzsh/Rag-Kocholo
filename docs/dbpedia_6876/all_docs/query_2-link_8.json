        "text": "By June Fletcher of the Naples Daily News\n\nDespite revenue gains, Beasley Broadcast Group Inc., a Naples-based radio operator, posted lower profits in the quarter ending Sept. 30 related to its radio-station swap-out late last year.\n\nOn Dec. 1, the company picked up 14 CBS radio stations in Florida, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. It traded five of its stations in the Philadelphia and Miami-Fort Lauderdale markets for the CBS stations.\n\n\"We are now approximately 11 months into our integration and transition plan and despite it being more difficult and time-consuming than expected, we believe our success in expense management combined with our ratings strength should lead to financial benefits from the swap in late 2016,\" said Caroline Beasley, chief financial officer, in a statement.\n\nFor its combined operations, the company posted a net loss of $738,000, or 3 cents a share for the quarter, down from a net profit of $2.5 million or 11 cents a share, a year ago.\n\nThe company said its results were impacted by a pretax $3.5 million noncash goodwill impairment charge related to its Wilmington, Delaware, station.\n\nHowever, the company said net revenues rose 7 percent on a combined basis, to $26.3 million from $24.5 million in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nThe revenue increases were due largely to strength in Beasley's cluster of stations in Fort Myers, as well growth in the Tampa-St. Petersburg market, which was one of the markets it picked up in the exchange.\n\nHowever, in a webcast Friday, Caroline Beasley said there was a problem at one of their stations in the Tampa market, WBRN, when one of their on-air personalities, Todd Clem, whose on-air name was \"Bubba the Love Sponge,\" became the subject of a Nielsen ratings tampering investigation on Sept 25.\n\nHowever, Clem admitted the action and returned to the air Oct. 6, according to reports.\n\n\"This negatively impacted the Q3 share for the station and the cluster,\" said Beasley. \"At this time, the morning show has returned with the same personalities and continues to be very popular in Tampa.\"\n\nSome stations in other markets also faced challenges from direct competitors or format changes, Beasley said. But overall, the ratings for listeners in prime time and the 25-to-54 year age group continue to grow for the company's stations.\n\n\"While generally at present our revenues are not reflecting the strength of our ratings, we expect this disparity to close in the near future,\" she said.\n\nThe company also reported its year-over-year results on a pro forma basis, which assumes it owned the CBS stations for all of last year. On that basis, net revenue fell 4.5 percent and station operating income declined 12.2 percent, reflecting weakness in the Charlotte, Las Vegas, Fayetteville and Wilmington markets.\n\nThe company continues to drop its debt while paying dividends. In the third quarter, it repaid $3 million in debt, reducing its borrowings to $90.2 million, and declared its eighth straight quarterly cash dividend.\n\nFounded in 1961, Beasley Broadcast owns and operates 53 stations, including 33 FM stations and 20 a.m. stations, in 12 large and mid-size markets in the U.S.\n\nIn Southwest Florida, it owns six stations: WJBX, WXKB, WWCN, WRXK, WJPT and The Link FM."
