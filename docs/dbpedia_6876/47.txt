WebCast is a really nice enhancement to Chromium-based desktop web browsers

Its purpose is to identify video files as they are loaded into a webpage, and provide a mechanism by which to cast their links

when a link is "cast", Chromecast uses its embedded HTML5 browser to play the video

the device which was used to "cast" the link doesn't proxy the stream

The tool consists of two parts:

an external website

an AngularJS SPA (single page app)

the default route allows a user to enter the URL to a video file

another route can be passed a base64 encoded URL to a video file

after a URL is received, the following page elements are rendered:

an HTML5 video player

a Chromecast button, which uses Google APIs to scan for Chromecasts on the LAN and display a list of devices that could be used to play the video file

a Chromium extension

it hooks into the HTTP API to listen for requested URLs that end with a supported file extension

each URL that matches is made available to "cast"

clicking on any such video will open a new browser tab to WebCast's "external website" component

it's provided with the base64 encoded URL of the video file

WebCast hasn't been updated since:

version 0.2.1

June 2, 2014

It tests for the following file extensions:

.mp4

.mov

Purpose for Fork:

keep a backup of the "external website"

detect more types of video formats:

.3gp

.avi

.m1v

.m4v

.mkv

.mov

.mp4

.mp4v

.mpeg

.mpg

.mpg2

.mpv

.ogm

.ogv

.webm

.xvid

.m3u8

HLS: HTTP Live Streaming

.mpd

MPEG-DASH

.ism, .ismv, .ismc, .ism/Manifest

Microsoft Smooth Streaming

Additional Notes:

not all of the videos detected ( see above ) will work in Chromecast

the preference is to find too many video links, rather than too few

the "external website":

can be used without any Chromium extension

the URL to cast would need to be manually entered into a form field

can be loaded into the Chromium desktop web browser from the local filesystem

ex: file:///C:/path/to/external_website/index.html#/watch/:base64-encoded-URL

ex: file:///C:/path/to/external_website/index.html#/watch/:base64-encoded-URL/subtitle/:base64-encoded-URL

Possible To-Dos:

add an option to the Chromium extension that allows the user to change the URL of the "external website"

change the methodology used by the Chromium extension to detect matching video files

inspect the HTTP response "Content-Type" header

open source, no ads, no data collection, no communication with any 3rd-party server

uses the same methodology to detect video formats (as the WebCast-Reloaded Chromium extension)

not perfect, but works pretty darn good
