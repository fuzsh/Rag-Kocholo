Career

La Lupe was born in the barrio of San Pedrito in Santiago de Cuba. Her father was a worker at the local Bacardí distillery and a major influence on her early life. In 1954 she participated on a radio program which invited fans to sing imitations of their favorite stars. Lupe escaped from school to sing a bolero of Olga Guillot's, called Miénteme ("Lie to Me"), and won the competition. The family moved to Havana in 1955, where she was enrolled at the University of Havana to become a teacher. She admired Celia Cruz and like her, she graduated from teaching instruction before starting to sing.

Lupe married in 1958 and formed a musical trio with her husband Eulogio "Yoyo" Reyes and another female singer. This group, Los Tropiccuba, broke up along with her marriage in 1960. She began to perform her own act at a small nightclub in Havana, La Red (The Net), which had a clientele of distinguished foreigners. She acquired a devoted following, which included Ernest Hemingway, Tennessee Williams, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Marlon Brando. She released her first album, Con El Diablo en El Cuerpo (With the Devil Inside) in 1960, for RCA Victor. Her first television appearance on Puerto Rican television caused a stir due to her frenzied, vibrant performance, which reportedly shocked some viewers.

In 1962 she was exiled to México. She approached Celia Cruz and asked for her support to get work, and in turn, Celia recommended her to Mongo Santamaría in New York. In New York City, Lupe performed at a cabaret named La Berraca and started a new career, making more than 10 records in five years. She married a second time, to salsa musician Willie García, with whom she had a daughter. That marriage also ended in divorce.

Lupe's passionate performances covered the range of music: son montuno, bolero, boogaloo, venturing into other Caribbean styles like Dominican merengue, Puerto Rican bomba and plena. It was her recordings which brought Tite Curet Alonso into prominence as a composer of tough-minded boleros in the salsa style. For a good part of the 1960s she was the most acclaimed Latin singer in New York City due to her partnership with Tito Puente. She did a wide variety of cover versions in either Spanish or accented English, including "Yesterday", "Dominique" by The Singing Nun, "Twist & Shout", "Unchained Melody", "Fever" and "America" from West Side Story. Fred Weinberg, who was her favorite audio engineer, also produced several of her albums. Weinberg called La Lupe "a hurricane" in the studio due to her intense singing and enthusiasm.

The quality of her performances became increasingly inconsistent. There were persistent rumors of her drug addiction and her life was "a real earthquake" according to statements of close friends. She ended some of her on-stage engagements being treated with an oxygen mask. Although she may have been poorly managed by her label Fania Records in particular, she managed and produced herself in mid-career, after she parted ways with Tito Puente. However, in the late 1960s her ephemeral career went downhill. The explosion of salsa and the arrival of Celia Cruz to New York were the determining factors that sent her into the background and her career declined thereafter.

Religious beliefs

A devout follower of Santería, she continued to practice her religion. Her record label Fania Records ended her contract in the late 1970s, perhaps simply because of her falling record sales. She retired in 1980, and found herself destitute by the early 1980s. In 1984 she injured her spine while trying to hang a curtain in her home; she initially used a wheelchair, then later a cane. An electrical fire made her homeless. After being healed at an evangelical Christian crusade, La Lupe abandoned her Santería roots and became a born-again Christian. In 1991, she gave a concert at La Sinagoga in New York, singing Christian songs.

Death

La Lupe died of a heart attack at the age of 52 and is buried in Saint Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx.

Popular Culture

In the 1990s, interest in her music was re-sparked when Pedro Almodóvar included Puro Teatro, one of her boleros of love and breakup in his film Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.

In her 1964 essay "Notes on 'Camp'", Susan Sontag lists La Lupe as being part of the Camp canon.

Her recording of La Virgen Lloraba was used in the 1996 film The Birdcage.

In 2002, New York City renamed East 140th Street in The Bronx as La Lupe Way in her memory.

Cuban-American writer Daína Chaviano pays homage to La Lupe in the novel The Island of Eternal Love (Riverhead-Penguin, 2008), where the singer appears in a cameo singing Puro Teatro.

On the TV series RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars, Puerto Rican drag queen Nina Flowers chose to impersonate La Lupe.

Her recording of Fever was included in the episode "Angels of Death," from season two of the Starz series Magic City.

A poem by Víctor Hernández Cruz was written about her: La Lupe

In 1991, comedian Sandra Bernhard released a track called 'La Lupe" on her album Excuses for Bad Behavior, Part #1, spoken in Spanish and English, in which Bernhard briefly speaks of the dissolution of the La Lupe/Tito Puente relationship.

In 2015, an analogous and fictionalized version of La Lupe (renamed Lola Calvo for the series), was heavily featured in an 80 episode Spanish-language biographical television series of Celia Cruz called Celia (telenovela), on the Telemundo network.

In 2017, the first episode of TNT's "Claws" is titled "Tirana" and in it the main characters lip-sync and dance to one of La Lupe's signature songs.
