Lupe Victoria Yolí Raymond (23 December 1936 – 29 February 1992), better known as La Lupe, was a Cuban singer of boleros, guarachas and Latin soul, known for her energetic, sometimes controversial performances. 1961’s “La Lupe ls Back” was her second LP on which she went one step ahead of her brillian debut “Con el diablo en el cuerpo”, incorporating several pop and rock’n’roll hits of the time to her repertoire, such as the Carole King/Jerry Goffin penned “Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow” which had been a big hit for The Shirelles or “Lipstick On Your Collar” which had hit the RnR charts in the voice of Connie Francis, among others, all done in the unique Lupe style and adapted to Spanish.
