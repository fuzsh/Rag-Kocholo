        "text": "Guadalupe Victoria Yolí Raymond – aka La Lupe – was a Cuban singer who emigrated from Cuba in the early 60s. (According to Wikipedia, while performing in Havana, she earned fans including Ernest Hemingway, Tennessee Williams, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Marlon Brando – can’t vouch for any of that). She performed and recorded with Mongo Santamaría, and Tito Puente – those records are hard to find.\n\nHer husband at the time, William Garcia, wrote the original sleeve notes: “HER VOICE . . . One hundred percent soul mixed with tenderness, romance, belding, wistful swinging in her interpretations of boleros, guarachas, Venezuelan Joropo, or the groover boogaloo.”\n\nYes, that’s an English language boogaloo version of the standard “Fever” (originally recorded by Little Willie John, later adapted famously by Peggy Lee with modified lyrics). La Lupe had already released a version in Spanish on her debut album in 1961."
