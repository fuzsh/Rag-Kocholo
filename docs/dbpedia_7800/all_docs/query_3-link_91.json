        "text": "I always know that I'm capable of changing. On one hand, if I change for the worse, I don't want to be remembered. If I change for the better, I just want to be remembered as 'He did not lead them astray.' Not the multi-Grammys and his songs, his accolades and what he's achieved on paper. It's 'He did not lead them astray.' That's my fear, to lead astray, to create the cycle, the butterfly effect of me being the role model, the example of you doing wrong.\n\nFiasco on his legacy, during Festival of Faith and Music in 2009[3]\n\nWasalu Muhammad Jaco (born February 16, 1982), professionally known as Lupe Fiasco (/ˈluːpeɪ/ LOO-pay), is an American rapper, record producer, and entrepreneur. He rose to prominence for his cerebral lyricism and creative storytelling, with some designating him as the savior of hip-hop.[4] He is part of SNDCLSH, Japanese Cartoon, and formerly a member of Da Pak, All City Chess Club, and Child Rebel Soldier. As of June 2024, he has released nine studio albums that met with critical reception.\n\nRegarded as one of the pioneers of the conscious hip-hop movement, Fiasco's music addresses subjects such as absent parents, gentrification, urban violence, conspicuous consumption, settler colonialism, and the African diaspora. Over the span of his career, he has been nominated for twelve Grammys, thirteen BET Hip Hop Awards, and four NAACP Image Awards. He joined the Aspen Institute's 2014 class of Henry Crown Fellows, is a recipient of the MLK Visiting Professorship Program at MIT (2022/23), and a Saybrook Associate Fellow (2023). He has been involved in philanthropic work and business ventures, including being the co-founder of M.U.R.A.L., 1st & 15th Entertainment, Studio SV, and Righteous Kung Fu. He has aspirations to win a Nobel Peace Prize.[5]\n\n\"Lupe\" extends from the nickname, \"Lu,\" borrowed from a Colombian high school friend. \"Fiasco\" originates from the Firm album and their song, \"Firm Fiasco.\" He explained that he simply \"liked the way it looked on paper.\"[6]\n\nBiography[]\n\n1982-1999: Early life[]\n\nI grew up in the 'hood around prostitutes, drug dealers, killers, and gangbangers. On the doorknob outside of our apartment, there was blood from some guy who got shot; but inside, there was National Geographic magazines and encyclopedias and a little library bookshelf situation. And we didn't have cable, so we didn't have the luxury of having our brains washed by MTV. We watched public television—cooking shows and stuff like that.\n\nFiasco describing his childhood[7]\n\nWasalu Muhammad Jaco was born at 10:14 A.M. on February 16, 1982, in Chicago, Illinois,[8] to Shirley Jaco, a gourmet chef, and Gregory Jaco, an operating plant engineer at Northwestern Hospital. His father was also a martial arts instructor, member of the Black Panther Party, and an Army Green Beret.[9] Fiasco is of West African descent, raised on the West Side of Chicago in the Madison Terrace housing project.[10] His parents divorced when he was five years old, where he lived with his mother, though remained close with both. He informed Entertainment Weekly in 2008, \"I got nine brothers and sisters. Three of us have the same mother and father, everyone else is half brothers and sisters.\"[7]\n\nFiasco grew up as a self-proclaimed nerd, reading National Geographic magazines and skateboarding for fun. As a child, he would build robots and wanted to become a rocket scientist, though found difficulty with math.[11] His main interests were chess, Transformers, karate, and shortwave radio.[12] Along with this, he practiced various forms of martial arts and handled guns since he was young, creating a strange juxtaposition as he witnessed street violence and encountered gang culture growing up. In sixth grade, he moved to live with his father in the suburb, Harvey, where he attended Thornton Township High School. He was involved in many extracurriculars, joining the chess club, participating in Academic Decathlon competitions, and working as stagehand in school theater productions, including managing lights and sound.[13] Additionally, he held a job as a short-order cook at a greasy spoon near his house, working forty hours for sixty dollars. To compensate for the low wages, he ate free fast food, much to management's disapproval.[14] In high school, he was transferred to Honors Chemistry, though felt uncomfortable being in the advanced group and returned to regular classes after two weeks. His teacher Calvin Stark saw potential in him, stating, \"Every time I would call on him, he would respond with the correct answer. I said to myself, 'There's something up with this kid. He's smart. Very smart.'\" Fiasco's mother described him as \"Smart, a bit complex; he kind of was a loner; he didn't hang with a lot of people. […] Lupe may have had the nerd persona, but when he would go out to play he was in the 'hood. That's where he lived, and he learned to deal with that.\"[15]\n\nFiasco has family members who are either police officers or gang members. Growing up in Chicago, widely recognized as one of the most gang-occupied cities in the United States, he remained a neutron, though admitted how he nearly joined the Latin Kings (\"Sittin' Sideways (Remix)\") and might have opted for the Gangster Disciples (\"City of the Year\").[16] He once tweeted out, \"When it was time to choose a potential street gang to join in junior high [I chose] Latin King.\"[17] He told The Ringer, \"There was gangbanging—we didn't have Bloods and Crips but we had GDs, Vice Lords, Latin Kings, King Cobras, Black Souls, BDs, we had all the others. Maybe people don't really appreciate that those gangs are just as strong, or stronger in their neighborhoods than Bloods and Crips—Bloods and Crips just have a better brand—but [Chicago-founded gangs are] just as violent, just as influential. And I think sometimes people miss that that's a part of my DNA—that I come from the streets.\"[18] His brother was a high-ranking Gangster Disciple, and he has friends who are Vice Lords.\n\nFiasco decided early on to pursue a rapping career over a post-secondary education.[19] He began rapping in eighth grade because of Dusean \"Bishop G\" Dunbar, who taught him \"how to rhyme and use stanzas\" and eventually became his hype man. They first met at school, where Bishop recalled, \"I was running with a bad crowd. [Fiasco] was like the nerd. He had these big glasses and he was always reading or something. For whatever reason, though, we kind of clicked up. I guess I liked the way he read out loud in class. I could read real well, too.\" Fiasco's mother was displeased about him becoming a gangsta rapper upon seeing early material, though eventually he and Bishop sought a different path from their peers.[15]\n\nDuring his teenage years (ages 15-17), Fiasco engrossed himself in the music of Jay-Z, Nas, Pharoahe Monch, and Wu-Tang Clan. At sixteen, he began to take rapping seriously, where Nas' It Was Written left a profound impact. He explained, \"I started to define myself along those lines. You know how people are searching for who they want to be, or how they want to act in their teenage years. That album hit me right then.\"[20] His father helped support his passion by driving him and Bishop to second-hand stores for musical equipment, enabling them to create a basement studio and produce mixtapes. Their initial performances faced criticism at school for sounding different from their peers, but they gained recognition through word of mouth.[15] They were part of the 1500s crew with Napo and Doughboy, expanding in junior year to include emcees, DJs, and graffiti artists, fully immersed in Hip Hop culture.[21] In 1999, he was offered his first deal from Aftermath Entertainment.[22]\n\n2000–2004: Da Pak and 1st & 15th[]\n\nIn 2000, Fiasco had to pick up his younger sister on the West Side. He took the bus but got off a stop early and walked up the block to his mother's house. Record producers who were driving by recognized him as a rapper, and invited him to showcase at Raw Dope Studios, where Aftermath Entertainment was scouting talent. There, he met Charles \"Chilly\" Patton, a friend of Aftermath's representative, Big Chuck. Fiasco joined the quartet hip-hop group Da Pak with Nahvee, Butcher, and Delow,[23] signing to Epic Records. They released only one promotional single, \"Armpits,\" and disbanded once the A&R was fired. Fiasco reported of there being complications, where the group didn't have any creative control and were mismanaged. The music made him feel hypocritical, talking about \"cocaine, guns, and women,\" where he disliked the misogynistic and vulgar lyrics. He added, \"I had to destroy that guy. Because what Lupe Fiasco says on this microphone is going to come back to Wasalu Jaco. When the music cuts off, you have to go home and live with what you say.\"[20]\n\nIn 2001, he and his manager Patton created their independent record label, 1st & 15th Entertainment, which attracted interest from major labels, including Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella. They turned down the deal as it didn't want them as an imprint production company, and signed to Arista Records around 2002. During this period, Fiasco operated quietly behind the scenes, releasing a few promos as part of Arista Cats and battle rapping other emcees. His song \"Coulda Been\" featured on MTV's Advance Warning compilation, and he appeared on singles such as \"Kiss Me,\" \"Didn't You Know (Remix),\" and \"Life.\" In May 2003, Patton was apprehended during a house raid where six kilos of heroin was found, suspected to be running a drug enterprise to fund 1st & 15th Entertainment. Police wiretapped Patton's phone calls for about a month, and on March 24, 2003, they documented him arranging Amtrak train reservations for himself and Fiasco the following day for an alleged drug transaction.[24] The two were arrested, and police confiscated their studios, cars, and jewelry. While Fiasco was acquitted of all drug charges, Chilly was incarcerated, and Jay-Z stepped in as a mentor and executive producer.[21] Fiasco would recount these events in his music, and maintained that Chilly took the rap for him.\n\nIn 2004, Fiasco had already laid down the groundwork for his solo record Food & Liquor, though towards the end of its completion, A&R L.A. Reid stepped down, partly due to great financial loss the label faced during his tenure.[25] This followed by projects being shelved and artists dropped from the roster or moved onto subsidiary labels. Fiasco wanted to be let go, and Arista's A&R representative Mark Pitts advised him to move to Atlantic Records, introducing him to Atlantic's Craig Kallman.[20] Since Jay-Z was poised to become the label's next president, Chilly went ahead with the record deal, carried out behind bars where Kallman visited the county's jail. However, Jay-Z was offered his masters and a position at Def Jam Recordings, accepting their proposition instead.[26] The advance money was used to bail Chilly out, and Fiasco debuted the first installment of his Fahrenheit 1/15 mixtape series, The Truth Is Among Us, at the end of the year. One of its songs, \"Muhammad Walks,\" resonated as a contemporary anthem within the Muslim community due to its exploration of his Islamic faith.[27]\n\n2005–2008: Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor and The Cool[]\n\nIn 2005, Fiasco released the mixtapes Revenge of the Nerds and A Rhyming Ape. His remix of \"Conflict Diamonds\" over Kanye West's \"Diamonds from Sierra Leone\" beat gained attention from online, West himself taking notice. This led to Fiasco's feature on West's 2006 single, \"Touch the Sky,\" that peaked at number 42 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), British Phonographic Industry (BPI), and Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). Their friendship predates this collaboration, though, Fiasco even bringing West in to showcase for Arista, where executive L.A. Reid infamously advised West to stick to beats instead of rapping.[28]\n\nThe collaboration and self-released music garnered an online cult following, leading Rolling Stone to name him as one of their 2006 Artists to Watch. His debut solo single, \"Kick, Push,\" peaked at number 78 on the Billboard Hot 100, and its music video played heavy rotation on MTV and BET. Fiasco was featured on the covers of Billboard and The Fader, along with a sponsorship deal with Reebok ahead of his debut album, which was unheard of at the time.[29] Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor was originally set for a June 2006 release,[30] but the leak of the bootlegged version in April caused it to become postponed to September 19 instead. As a way to pacify his fans for the time being, Fiasco released the mixtape Touch the Sky on May 5, 2006, hosted by DJ E.Nyce, that compiled previous material and freestyles. Food & Liquor debuted at number eight on the Billboard 200 and sold 81,000 copies in its first week. It gained widespread critical acclaim and received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards. In the same year, he won Best New Artist at MTV Woodies and was named Breakout Man of the Year by GQ magazine.\n\nIn 2007, the hip-hop supergroup Child Rebel Soldier was formed, comprising Fiasco, Pharrell, and Kanye West. Their debut single \"Us Placers\" was included on West's mixtape, Can't Tell Me Nothing. This followed by Fiasco joining XXL's inaugural Freshman class alongside Saigon, Lil Boosie, Rich Boy, Gorilla Zoe, Young Dro, Papoose, Joell Ortiz, Crooked I, and Plies. He received his first Grammy win for \"Daydreamin'\" featuring Jill Scott, though was unable to attend the ceremony, having his lawyer accept it on his behalf.[31] Towards the end of the year, Fiasco released his highly anticipated sophomore album, Lupe Fiasco's The Cool, on December 18, 2007. During its recording, Fiasco faced personal challenges: his father passed away from type II diabetes, his business partner Chilly was convicted on multiple drug charges and sentenced to up to 44 years in prison, and his friend Stack Bundles was murdered—factors that contributed to the album's darker tone. The album was preceded by the single, \"Superstar\" featuring Matthew Santos, that peaked at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100 and was nominated at the 51st Grammy Awards for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration and Best Rap Song. The album's concept centers on a male hustler who is raised from the dead across several tracks. The protagonist, Michael Young History ('My Cool Young History'), also known as \"The Cool,\" is influenced by the supernatural entities \"The Streets\" (femme fatale archetype) and \"The Game\" (negative influence of the hustler lifestyle). Fiasco made this storyline spawn from the Food & Liquor songs \"He Say She Say\" and \"The Coolest,\" where Young grows up without a father and turns to the street life only to meet his demise. Several critics found this concept to be puzzling, including The Guardian, who declared it \"ma[de] no sense,\" though response was generally positive.[32] The album moved 160,000 copies in its first week, surpassing his debut by nearly twice the amount in sales figures, and like its predecessor, was nominated for Best Rap Album at the Grammy Awards. It debuted at number 15 on the Billboard 200 and number 7 on the UK Albums Chart. In its second week, the album rose to number 14 on the Billboard 200. Fiasco had plans for a multimedia franchise spawning from The Cool, that would've included collectible toys, comic books, and a horror-themed radio show.[33][34]\n\nIn 2008, The Cool was supported by its tracks \"Hip-Hop Saved My Life,\" \"Paris, Tokyo,\" and \"Dumb It Down\" re-released as singles, each accompanied by a music video. Fiasco performed extensively in promotion of the album, with The Cool Tour dates in conjunction with the Coca-Cola Refresh Your Flow Tour and Kanye West's Glow in the Dark Tour around North America and Europe. He appeared at the music festivals Glastonbury Festival, Lollapalooza, and Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, and on the talk shows The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Late Show with David Letterman, and The Tavis Smiley Show. He also founded the indie rock band, Japanese Cartoon, alongside bassist Graham Burris, keyboardist Matt Nelson, and producer Le Messie.\n\n2009–2011: Lasers[]\n\nFiasco created a manifesto for his upcoming project, with the working title of We Are Lasers. The idea stemmed from one of his friend's partners who discussed punk bands that built their careers around manifestos. Fiasco considered the Black Panther movement that outlined clear aims, too, and believed he was at a point of his life to define his artistic vision and aspirations.[35] The promotional concert, Remember 2 Smile, took place on October 29, 2009, at Congress Theater in his hometown. The event featured vignettes exploring themes such as Life, Death, Art, Fame, Faith, and Politics throughout the performance. On Thanksgiving 2009, he dropped his mixtape Enemy of the State: A Love Story, the project put forth as a response to MTV omitting his name from their \"2009 Hottest MCs\" list. He felt that excluding positive influences from such lists left hip-hop without any positive representation, elaborating in an interview, \"If you look at it and 90% of it is negative, it's like we gotta have something positive on the list. […] It's not because I want the glory and fame, but so kids can have a different role model or choice of role model.\"[35]\n\nChallenges with his record label, Atlantic, led to a period of discontentment for Fiasco. He admitted to feeling suicidal at certain points, a topic addressed in \"Beautiful Lasers (2 Ways),\" which he wanted to release as the album's lead single. On January 19, 2010, the charity single \"Resurrection\" featuring Kenna was released as part of Download to Donate for Haiti. He went on the headlining tour, Steppin' Lasers, where he confirmed the album was already finished and performed a few new songs at his concerts. The delayal of Lasers sparked an online petition, followed by the fan-organized peaceful protest known as Fiasco Friday, held on October 15, 2010, outside Atlantic's headquarters. Although Atlantic already announced the Lasers release date, around 200 fans gathered in a show of celebration and support. Fiasco found the moment inspirational, feeling that his message towards positive change was getting out.[36] The album's lead single, \"The Show Goes On,\" was released on October 26, 2010, containing a sample of \"Float On\" by Modest Mouse. It became a point of contention, as Fiasco was pressured to push out more pop-oriented tracks or risk his album not being released, believing it was retaliation for him not signing a 360 deal. He added of how the lyric 'Have you ever had the feelin' that you was bein' had?' was particularly fitting, likening his situation to being held at \"gunpoint.\" \"The Show Goes On\" become his greatest solo hit commercially, peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100, number five on the ARIA Singles Chart, and certified 3× Platinum in 2014 by the RIAA. The album's second single, \"Words I Never Said,\" was released on February 8, 2011. Presented to him as a love song with Skylar Grey's hook, Fiasco decided to talk about world affairs instead, mentioning 9/11, government fiscal policy, and the Gaza War. It peaked at number 89 on the Billboard 100. The third single, \"Out of My Head\" featuring Trey Songz, charted at number 40 on the Billboard 100, followed by the fourth single \"I Don't Wanna Care Right Now\" featuring MDMA that failed to appear on the Hot 100, though debuted at number 12 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. Days leading up to Lasers' release, fans could pre-order the album using an iTunes pass, receiving songs in advance and eventually having the deluxe version with two music videos and two bonus tracks.[37]\n\nLasers, released on March 7, 2011, received criticism for its commercialized sound and departure from Fiasco's usual lyricism. In spite of fan disappointment and Fiasco's own dissatisfaction with the album's creation process, it debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, being his first work to do so, and sold 204,000 copies in its first week.[38] It marked the first rap album released that year to top the charts, and received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards, while \"The Show Goes On\" was nominated for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance. During his Generation Laser Tour, Fiasco publicly supported the Occupy Wall Street movement, donating tents, sharing the poem \"Moneyman,\" and speaking about the cause at his concerts. On June 28, 2011, Fall Out Boy's lead vocalist Patrick Stump released the single, \"This City,\" with a feature from Fiasco. It peaked at number 25 on US Billboard Pop Songs, serving as the lead single from Stump's debut solo album, Soul Punk, where the singer reworked the entire album so the track could fit conceptually.[39] On November 24, 2011, Fiasco released the mixtape Friend of the People: I Fight Evil. Originally announced as his next release on Christmas 2009, the project was set aside for his climb up Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania to raise profits for water wells that were eventually installed two years later.[40] Consequence of Sound highlighted the mixtape's use of electropop beats sampled from artists such as Ellie Goulding and M83, noting its deviation from traditional hip-hop sounds.[41]\n\n2012–2015: Food & Liquor II and Tetsuo & Youth[]\n\nOn August 10, 2012, Australian singer-songwriter Guy Sebastian released \"Battle Scars\" with Fiasco, appearing on Sebastian's sixth album, Armageddon, and Fiasco's fourth album, Food & Liquor II. The song peaked at number 71 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the ARIA Charts, becoming Fiasco's third top ten and first number one single in Australia. It spent twenty nonconsecutive weeks on the Hot 100 and was nominated for a NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Duo, Group or Collaboration. The song earned Fiasco his first ARIA Music Awards nomination and has been certified platinum in Australia, United States, and New Zealand. They performed \"Battle Scars\" on The X Factor, Late Show with David Letterman, and at the 2012 ARIA Music Awards. In September 2012, tensions briefly arose between Fiasco and drill artist Chief Keef, when Fiasco commented on Baltimore's radio station, 92 Q Jams, about violence being perpetuated by the gang culture. He mentioned they \"all look like Chief Keef,\" offending the fellow Chicagoan rapper, who responded with an open threat on September 5 via Twitter. Fiasco replied that they were not \"goons\" and urged for efforts to prevent further violence, emphasizing the need to rise above street life that \"takes and takes till there is nothing left.\"[42] He announced his intention to retire from music after releasing his next album, devastated over the environments people in his community are forced to grow up in, which only continues cycles of violence. Following the Twitter exchange, he leaked the song \"American Terrorist II,\" speculated to be the lead single off the second part of his Food & Liquor II album.[43] Days later, at the Yorkfest show on September 12 in Toronto, Canada, Fiasco issued a public apology to Chief Keef for his comments, expressing his desire for Keef to succeed and thrive.[44][45]\n\nFood & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1 was released on September 25, 2012, delving into America's history of colonialism, imperialism, and racism. The album met with generally positive response from critics and debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 90,000 copies.[46] Fiasco started working on the record in 2009, around the same time he awaited the release of Lasers. He explained to Refinery29 of its title, \"the core of that [debut] album was food and liquor, which means the good and the bad, human nature and duality, where we do good things and then we do terrible things. So, it's [the new album] still impressing that point, but the core of it is The Great American Rap Album.\"[47] The album launch took place at Cedar Lake on September 27, 2012, endorsed by Samsung Galaxy S III.[46] Preceded by the singles \"Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free),\" \"Bitch Bad,\" and \"Lamborghini Angels,\" the former two received controversy. \"Around My Way\" recreated Pete Rock and CL Smooth's \"They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.),\" where Rock took to Twitter the day of the single's release to say how he felt \"violated\" and it \"should['ve been] left alone.\"[48] Fiasco clarified how his team reached out to Pete in November and were in touch for the past six months, receiving the greenlight to use it.[49] Meanwhile, \"Bitch Bad\" and its music video was panned by Spin magazine, who described it as \"mansplain[ing]\" and \"counterproductive,\"[50] prompting Fiasco to call for a boycott of the publication. The Great American Rap Album was nominated Best Rap Album at the 55th Grammy Awards, marking his fourth consecutive nomination in the category.\n\nIn 2013, he embarked on the Tetsuo & Youth Tour, billed as a preview of his forthcoming album. He performed the new songs \"Crack\" and \"Law,\" though a majority of his setlist were songs the audience was already familiar with. Opening acts included Manchester Orchestra, Dee-1, Mickey Factz, and Stalley.[51] In June 2013, Fiasco was co-featured alongside Rick Ross on \"Poor Decisions,\" a single by Wale included on the compilation album, MMG Presents: Self Made, Vol. It first premiered to Vibe and has the three rappers looking from different perspectives on decisions that can inevitably affect one's future, for better or for worst.[52] On October 14, 2013, he released \"Old School Love\" with a feature from Ed Sheeran, intended as the lead single from Tetsuo & Youth, though did not make the final track listing. The song peaked at number 93 on the US Billboard Hot 100, number 18 on the New Zealand Singles Chart, and number 23 on the ARIA Chart.\n\nIn 2014, Fiasco was a celebrity ambassador for Stand Up to Cancer, where he released the song \"Mission\" on May 19, as an uplifting anthem. His own grandmother passed away from cancer, and he had close ones affected, including Professor Ronald \"Kwesi\" Harris from Chicago State University, who also inspired the track.[53] The remix song featuring fellow Chicagoans Jennifer Hudson and Common was released on September 5, where the trio performed the song live on the televised special for that year.[54] On May 20, 2014, he was announced as the music director for the United States men's national soccer team's 2014 FIFA World Cup campaign. He helped coordinate in-game music programming and created the song, \"Stellar Light,\" that was released in full the following year.[55] With the delayal of Tetsuo & Youth, Fiasco remarked, \"Atlantic Records won't release the album until they get a 'pop' single. [S]o putting together a mini-project while they find one for me. It's called 'Lost in the Atlantic Ocean' with a bunch of my friends to stay active and happy…\" The next day, on October 15, 2014, hacktivist group Anonymous used Twitter to threaten his label for a release date, giving the ultimatum to agree to their request or face their wrath. They also made known of their willingness to fight for music that educates the masses to continue being released. Within less than 24 hours, the record label met their demand. Fiasco responded with \"V\" for vendetta, where the Guy Fawkes mask is the symbol of Anonymous.[56] In December 2014, he was featured on \"Linger,\" released as the fourth single from Guy Sebastian's seventh album, Madness.\n\nOn January 20, 2015, Tetsuo & Youth was released, where he deliberately stayed away from political themes and linear storytelling.[57][58] The album debuted at number 14 on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 42,000 copies in the United States, and appeared on several year-end lists. Critical response was generally favorable, where Kellan Miller of XXL evaluated, \"has arguably released his most thematically layered and engaging album to date.\"[59] The song \"Mural\" is his most-viewed solo song on Genius, with 673.9 thousand views. Being his final project with Atlantic, Fiasco considered moving to Red Bull or Blue Note Records, but ultimately both fell through.[60] On August 29, 2015, he released his mixtape Pharaoh Height 2/30 to Hightail as a free digital download. The title is a play on his Fahrenheit 1/15 mixtape series, and consists of six songs. On September 27, 2015, he announced of The Cool 2 being in the works.[61] On December 18, 2015, coinciding with The Cool's eighth anniversary, Fiasco gave a follow-up update of the sequel, expected to drop in Winter 2017.[62] Near the end of the year, Fiasco and Sky Gellatly, who make up the DJ duo SNDCLSH, released their debut extended play (EP), Don't Drop the Flag, on December 23. All proceeds from the project's sales were dedicated to supporting youth, reflecting their commitment \"to supporting the next generation of creative thinkers.\"[63]\n\n2016–2018: Drogas Light and Wave[]\n\nFrom January to May 2016, Fiasco embarked on the nationwide Tour for the Fans, featuring opening acts Billy Blue, The Boy Illinois, and Zverse.[64] On February 15, 2016, he participated in a Street Fighter exhibition match against Japanese esports player Daigo Umehara, where he won 3-2 using Ken.[65] Viewers accused of the tournament being fixed, though Fiasco insisted he had trained beforehand and played his best. On December 12, 2016, he published his freestyle \"N.E.R.D.\" on SoundCloud. Brian \"DJ Z\" Zisook, who is Jewish, wrote an article for DJBooth condemning the lyric 'Artists getting robbed for their publishing / By dirty Jewish execs who think it's alms from the covenant' on the grounds of it being antisemitic.[66] The organization Anti-Defamation League (ADL) stepped in to express disappointment as well, CEO Jonathan Greenblatt issuing a statement on how it reinforces negative stereotypes of Jewish people.[67] Fiasco deemed the track \"poorly interpreted\" and asserted he did not stand for \"real\" antisemitism. He directly replied to Greenblatt's statement, \"I didn't [call the execs] dirty becuz they were Jewish I called them dirty becuz their [sic] horrible fucking human beings.\"[68] Subsequently, the backlash led him to announce his retirement from music and cancel all upcoming albums.\n\nNevertheless, Drogas Light was released on February 10, 2017, through 1st & 15th Entertainment and Thirty Tigers. It sold 19,702 copies in its first week, and received mixed responses. Critics felt it did not exemplify the rapper's skillset, especially marking his first project off of Atlantic Records. With the foray into trap music and plenty guest features, Edwin Houghton of Pitchfork named it to be his \"most subversive album yet.\"[69] Fiasco revealed during his headline concert U.S. tour that it was a compilation of scrapped records from previous projects.[70]\n\nOn March 8, 2018, Fiasco premiered his martial arts documentary series, Beat n Path, in Southeast Asia and Hong Kong. It was dedicated in memory of his father, who had instructed him to complete his martial arts training in China. Produced by Studio SV, a company he co-founded with Bonnie Chan Woo, proceeds from the project went towards Rebuild Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to revitalizing buildings and neighborhoods in South Side Chicago.\n\nHis seventh studio album, Drogas Wave, was released on September 21, 2018; his longest work yet with twenty-four tracks. It debuted at number 60 on the US Billboard 200, having first-week sales of 11,099 equivalent units (4,951 being in pure album sales).[71] Another concept record, it revolves around the manilla currency used during the transatlantic slave trade. Fiasco constructed the narrative of the enslaved African LongChains, who escape their bondage and instead of drowning, survive underwater with a mission to drown passing slave ships. He intends to adapt the album's storyline into a screenplay or graphic novel, titled Wave. To promote the album, he embarked on the Drogas Wave Tour that visited select U.S. cities.\n\n2019–2022: House, Tape Tape, and Drill Music in Zion[]\n\nOn March 12, 2019, he performed at 312 Day, a festival celebrating the culture of Chicago. On July 1, 2019, he released the promotional single \"Air China,\" sharing his experiences of traveling to the country for his series, Beat n Path.[72] On Halloween 2019, the music video to the vault record, \"Hey Lupe,\" premiered to The Fader. It served as the third single from Chill's Spotlight, a playlist curated by Chilly.[73] On November 21, 2019, he headlined Red Bull Music Festival, performing the entirety of Food & Liquor for the first time in Chicago. His sister, Ayesha Jaco, was present to perform the intro.[74]\n\nIn 2020, he released the two collaborative extended plays, House and Tape Tape, done with Kaelin Ellis and Soundtrakk, respectively. The first originated via the Internet, where record producer Ellis tweeted out a beat that caught Fiasco's attention.[75] This led to a fully fleshed-out project released on July 24, 2020, with guest appearances from Virgil Abloh and Crystal Torres. It was dedicated in memory of Fiasco's and Sky Gellatly's fathers, where Peter Gellatly died from coronavirus disease. The EP's first and sole single, \"Shoes,\" was in dedication to the late Ahmaud Arbery, who was murdered by three white men while jogging. Abloh hypothetically designs a pair of shoes for Arbery. Tape Tape was with his longtime producer, released on October 2, 2020. The project only contains the two tracks \"Oh Yes\" and \"Apologetic,\" described as a playlist where songs would gradually be added depending on the audience's response.[76]\n\nOn October 8, 2020, the first four episodes of The Lupe and Royce Show podcast premiered, hosted by Fiasco, Royce da 5'9\", and Tom Franks. The show mainly discussed current events, personal anecdotes, and Hip Hop,[77] though would end a year after the exchange of disses between Fiasco and Royce. What started over a verbal disagreement turned into unfriendly relations, where on July 22, 2021, Royce published the diss track, \"Silence of the Lambda,\" taking shots at both Fiasco and Mickey Factz. Fiasco quickly followed by his own response using the same beat, \"Steve Jobs: SLR 3 1/2,\" where the public generally agreed Fiasco won.[78] On August 9, 2021, Fiasco announced the creation of an album within 24 hours. It ended up spanning across three days, as he needed rest. On September 24, 2021, an album with music inspired by the documentary film of the same name, The One and Only Dick Gregory, was released, featuring \"Big Energy\" by Fiasco.[79] The same day, his feature on the single \"Rómpelo\" by Cimafunk was released.\n\nOn May 28, 2022, he was a special guest for Coldplay's Chicago show during their Music of the Spheres World Tour. They performed \"Superstar\" together, followed by the band's \"God Put a Smile Upon Your Face.\"[80] On June 10, he released the song \"Galveston\" exclusively to Apple Music, as part of their compilation album, Juneteenth 2022: Freedom Songs.[81] On June 24, 2022, the album Drill Music in Zion was released to positive critical consensus and added to various year-end publication lists, with HipHopDX nominating him for \"Best Comeback.\"[82] The title was conceived from his 2021 freestyle, \"Forest Fires,\" where he mentioned his next album title. He worked with Soundtrakk and likened the project to Nas' Illmatic due to its ten tracks and magnum opus status. On October 10, 2022, The Cool was certified platinum by the RIAA; his first album to achieve this milestone.[83] The recognition came after his The Cool 15th Anniversary Tour, during which he performed the entire record at shows. On December 9, 2022, the song \"Pumpkin Seeds\" with Aesop Rock was released to help organization The Collaboratory restore two skateparks in Dayton, Ohio.[84]\n\n2023–present: All Proceeds to My Chain and Samurai[]\n\nOn April 28, 2023, Fiasco released the single \"SentRock,\" named after street artist Joseph \"Sentrock\" Perez, who created the accompanying painting inspired by the music. This followed by a slew of standalone singles as part of the All Proceeds to My Chain (APTMC) series, including \"Checkin',\" \"Outside,\" \"Channel No3,\" and \"Roc-A-Fella Y'all,\" that would go towards a new jewelry piece by Riic the Jeweler. During the summer, Fiasco joined American reggae rock band Dirty Heads' Island Glow Tour as an opening act on select dates. He debuted the song \"Better Days\" during his set, which remains in the vault. On July 19, 2023, Chilly was freed from prison under the new Illinois law, where extreme sentences could be revisited.[85]\n\nIn collaboration with Google, Fiasco launched the artificial intelligence (AI) tool TextFX on August 2, 2023, designed to assist rappers, writers, and wordsmiths. He demonstrated the tool with his song, \"Glass of Water,\" where he clarified it didn't generate raps directly, instead being a device meant to elevate writing, offer endless possibilities, and encourage new insights into text.[86] On August 11, 2023, Fiasco was a featured performer at Mass Appeal's Hip Hop 50 Live, held at the Yankee Stadium in New York. The event celebrated fifty years of Hip Hop culture.[87]\n\nIn 2024, Fiasco published a few loosies in the first four months, including \"Dominican Barber,\" \"LLC,\" and \"Indio\" to YouTube. He performed at Coachella's Heineken House venue for both weekends, where he announced his long-awaited project Samurai, scheduled for release that summer.[88] The lead single and title track, \"Samurai,\" dropped on May 17, 2024, followed by the second single, \"Cake,\" on June 7, 2024. Music videos for both singles were directed by Chris & Blaq. His ninth studio album, released on June 28, 2024, is based on Amy Winehouse becoming a battle rapper. The album, like Drill Music in Zion, was entirely produced by Soundtrakk.[89] The music video for one of its tracks, \"No. 1 Headband,\" dropped the same day. Fiasco told Forbes at this point of his life he no longer sees himself pursuing an artist career, belonging in other spaces, and now creates music purely for enjoyment.[90] On July 23, 2024, he announced the first batch of dates for the Samurai Tour.[91]\n\nArtistry[]\n\nSongwriting[]\n\nI like to make music where people ingest it and make it their own. I leave it blank enough, vague enough for people to insert their own meaning into it.\n\nFiasco, on making his music open to interpretation[6]\n\nFiasco is often categorized as a backpack[92] and conscious rapper,[46] where music critics laud his complex, erudite lyricism or willingness to engage in social commentary. Fiasco finds a distinction in his artistry between mixtapes and albums, likening it to having two different careers.[93] Since albums have to be compartmentalized and formulaic in many ways for sale, his pen game is best reflected in his mixtapes. Around The Cool, he noted that he no longer writes for a target audience in mind, where he \"realized at a certain point, even if I made something that was completely impossible, which is zero audience in mind, people would still take it and kind of interpret it and project into it things that they wanted to see anyway. So at a certain point, […] it was more about like I'mma do fifty percent, and then you're gonna do your fifty percent as the audience.\"[94] During an Instagram livestream, Fiasco demonstrated his creation process, where he freestyles and then refines each bar repeatedly on the mic until it sounds right, all without jotting anything down.[95]\n\nWriting for HipHopDX, Justin Hunte commended Fiasco's boldness in tackling controversial subjects, opining, \"there remains something noble about Chi-town's Guevara relentlessly waving his beliefs without fear of backlash. Someone has to shine a light on all the world's ills, right? If not Lu, then who?\"[96] Forbes writer Thomas Hobbs believed Fiasco has helped preserve political conscious rap in mainstream music,[16] while DJBooth's Michael Hannah comparably argued, \"Lupe established the idea that an artist can generally stay true to himself and reach new heights of success in popular and mainstream circles. It helped continue the acceptance of experimenting with genre blending and crossover sounds.\"[97] According to Forbes contributor Andrea Bossi, Fiasco \"made a name for himself through careful lyricism, socially conscious themes and reflective storytelling.\" She continued, \"His insightful lyrics are part of rap's rich lineage, connecting artists across generations.\"[98] Fans who analyzed the rapper's songs would share their theories on message boards and forums, ahead of Genius' creation. Fiasco told Vulture in 2020, \"You're talking to a person who's somewhat personally responsible for building an industry of annotating lyrics. When Rap Genius came out, I met with the owners […] That shit exists for the sole purpose of 'Because it's n-ggas like Lupe who say shit that I don't understand. And I need to figure that shit out.'\"[75]\n\nFiasco has favored \"simple complexity\" in his songs, where on the surface it's straightforward but listeners can deconstruct and extrapolate their layers and meanings.[99] He claims what makes a good lyricist includes punchlines, double entendres, and wordplay. He incorporates numerous cultural references and allusions in his work, focusing chiefly on bars. He aims to create songs that uplift and enlighten as redemptive work for his past, where he ran the streets.[100] His music functions as resistance, reform, and revolution, exploring African-American history, systemic oppression, economics like planned obsolescence, and life for inner-city youth. Fiasco employs various techniques in his songwriting, including anthropomorphizing inanimate objects to describe violence and racial tensions (\"Twilight Zone\"); using parody by mimicking radio songs (\"Bitch Bad\"); delivering stream-of-consciousness to showcase dense wordplay, continuous flow, and intricate rhyme schemes (\"Mural\"); and creating alternate realities to honor deceased individuals subjected to violence (\"Jonylah Forever\"). He coined the term resurrectives, a musical form of commemoration and immortalization where he brings the person back to life. The songs \"Jonylah Forever\" and \"Alan Forever\" are prime examples of this, where Fiasco creates for them another life to rescue themselves. He also creates portraitures for others, where he told Museum of Fine Arts, Boston: \"It's rare that you see artists pay homage to other artists through art […] I was like who does that in rap? Who's doing that for rappers, or who's doing that in rap for other artists? So I wanted to kind of take up that mantle of doing portraits of people, lyrically, with raps.\"[101]\n\nRegarding the usage of profanity in his songs, Fiasco's father once warned him that any curse uttered will release a demon from hell. He believed there to be power behind expletives, using them intentionally to ensure people listened or to express himself with honesty and rawness.[102]\n\nThemes[]\n\nFiasco frequently narrates the life experiences of African-Americans, covering subjects such as disenfranchisement, poverty, racism, enslavement, immigration, and other racial disparities. Recurring themes include liberation through death, morality and conflict, and questioning the status quo.\n\nFiasco's first album Food & Liquor centers around duality, symbolized by its title representing the balance between good and bad. He explores common human flaws like hypocrisy, ignorance, and corruption that perpetuate injustices, while also depicting the Chicago landscape through personal experiences. His second album The Cool similarly contemplates societal troubles such as child soldiers, gun violence, glorification of street life, and immigrant status. The inclusion of the Michael Young History (MYH) storyline creatively examines the repercussions of \"chasing the cool\" lifestyle. Lasers was critiqued for its radio sound, though it retains elements of Fiasco's intended messages. Tracks like \"Words I Never Said\" urge action in the face of adversity; \"All Black Everything\" reimagines a world where racism never existed; and \"State Run Radio\" critiques the oversaturation of commercial music, where records that raise awareness are blocked or seldom played.\n\nThe sequel to Food and Liquor, The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1, primarily focuses on the country's history and socio-political climate from Fiasco's perspective. Likewise to his debut record, it deals with topics such as colonialism and discusses corrupt institutions (religion, economy, government, schools). As he quips on \"ITAL (Roses),\" to those who complain he raps about the same things, \"Well, that's 'cause ain't shit changed, bitch.\" However, his next album Tetsuo & Youth takes a more abstract approach, with tracks like \"Mural\" featuring a loose interior monologue and \"Dots & Lines\" referencing the Pigpen cipher. The album is popularly thought to be played in reverse, telling the story of Fiasco's journey with Atlantic Records and the idea of freedom through death and resurrection. Christian themes are also present, songs like \"Adoration of the Magi\" and \"Madonna (And Other Mothers in the Hood),\" being specific religious references. Dr. Raphael Travis Jr., author of The Healing Power of Hip Hop (2015), penned how Fiasco tackles both inner and outer perspectives, including issues like arms trafficking, the prison system, and social welfare safety net.\n\nThematically, Drogas Light is a varied album that touches on subjects ranging from the prevalence of guns and drugs in the United States to love ballads like \"Law\" and \"More Than My Heart,\" a tribute to his mother. Fiasco adopts a more humorous and lighthearted style, occasionally interspersed with moments of social consciousness. Tracks like \"Jump\" narrate his encounter with a trapper who wants him as her ghostwriter, \"It's Not Design\" studies the meanings of love, and \"Tranquillo\" reflects on Black stereotypes, dignity, and struggles to make a living. Drogas Wave takes on a conceptual approach for its first part (\"Wave\"), where dominant themes are water and slavery. Fiasco created the story of the LongChains who escape their bonds and save themselves by drowning; instead of death, they live underwater with the mission to sink passing slave ships. This storyline intersects with the MYH narrative, where Young was given liquor instead of water, leading to his transformation into an animated corpse. The second part, \"Drogas,\" examines the impact of drugs on society. It includes interludes that confront these issues, advocating for youth guidance (\"Don't Mess Up the Children (Interlude)\") and freedom of the mind (\"Baba Kwesi (Interlude)\").\n\nDrill Music is reminiscent of Fiasco's earlier works with straightforward messages but takes a jazzier approach. Fiasco explores materialism (\"Kiosk\"), human interaction and technology through the anthropomorphism of hands (\"Precious Things\"), and violence in hip-hop (\"On Faux Nem\"). Samurai refrains from explicitly conscious topics, and is described as Fiasco's most personal album to date. It chronicles his experiences and intertwines the concept of Amy Winehouse as a battle rapper. Fiasco elaborated on the album's purpose in a press release: \"The overall themes of the album speak to the constant fight and the battle one goes through being in the entertainment industry. Some of the things we need to defend.\"\n\nInfluences[]\n\nFiasco mainly grew up on West Coast gangsta rap,[103] though was initially put off by hip-hop's use of vulgarity and degradation of women. He has an eclectic taste in music, with particular fondness for jazz above all other genres. Before embracing rap, he mainly listened to classical and jazz, naming Benny Goodman and Thelonious Monk as major influences.[104] He relayed to Complex, \"My favorite songs aren't hip-hop songs; they're songs from Queen like 'Somebody to Love.' Hip-hop is just something I actually know how to do.\"[105] Recently, he has been drawn to the boom bap subgenre, for its \"80 to 95 BPM range with laid-back, jazzy layers.\"[106]\n\nFiasco credits his father with introducing him to rap, playing songs by artists like Public Enemy, N.W.A., Ravi Shankar, and King Sunny Ade during his martial arts training.[107] He has identified Jay-Z as a key musical influence, stating he \"literally would not be rapping if it wasn't for [him].\" Fiasco learned to rap by freestyling over Jay-Z beats, a practice that became second nature to him.[108] In a July 2018 tweet, Jay ranked in his top three rappers, for reasons including lyrical ability, sales, longevity, and influence.[109] His top five whom he professionally looks to become a better rapper are Jay-Z, MF Doom, Aesop Rock, Ghostface Killah, and Jay Electronica.[110] Other notable influences on him include Nas, Spice 1, 8Ball & MJG, Crucial Conflict, Q-Tip, Psychodrama, and Geto Boys, where he named the former's album It Was Written to leave a strong impression on him.[111][58]\n\nPublic image[]\n\nMy gift and curse is that I'm always 10 years ahead. I'm not saying that out of ego. It's just something that I've noticed. You do something, and then 10 years later such and such did it. Then you're like, 'Oh, I did that 10 years ago!'\n\nFiasco noticing his tendency to be ahead of his time[60]\n\nFiasco acknowledges his nerd image, which essentially is himself. He maintains a private personal life and has reluctance doing interviews, feeling the media twists his words. There has been a period of unfavorable press coverage and public perception, where Fiasco faced backlash after calling President Obama a terrorist for the authorization of numerous drone strikes in the Middle East. He voiced how Obama was responsible for the collateral damage, as well, where innocent civilians suffered or lost their lives. Following the statements, he faced professional repercussions, including being blackballed, losing sponsorships, friendships, and crew support. When asked if he regretted his statements, he felt it opened a door for him, saying, \"It's gonna affect change on a much much higher level in a much much more direct way with the folks who actually have their hands on the levers of social change, social direction, and social power.\"[58]\n\nPublications tend to view Fiasco as eccentric, didactic, elusive, and radical. LA Weekly's Jeff Weiss described him as a rapper who didn't fit in any hip-hop circles, noting, \"You wouldn't exactly call Fiasco soft. […] But he's not rough enough for those weaned on the grimy New York city-street rap of the '90s, he's too irreverent and iconoclastic for the old backpack crowd, and he's unwilling to dumb it down for ringtone radio.\"[112] Likewise, Yelena Bailey of How the Streets Were Made (2020) viewed Fiasco as \"somewhat of an outlier\" in mainstream hip-hop: \"was the child of Black radicalism, a Chicago rapper who rejected the materialism and overt misogyny that permeates much of hip-hop.\" She highlighted his cultural critic role, where he focuses on American imperialism and internal issues within Black communities, and ascribed Lasers as his fall from mainstream. Ryan Bassil, writing for Noisey, gave a retrospective of Fiasco's career decline, where his outspoken social commentary often overshadowed his musical output, making survival in the industry challenging.[113] Former Lehigh faculty member James Braxton Peterson, author of Hip-Hop Headphones (2016), observed that Fiasco's early fans from Food & Liquor were introduced to his \"complex radically progressive politics,\" and emphasized on his unique ability to maintain authenticity whilst navigating the hip-hop space.\n\nIn their critical analysis from Juan Battle and Sandra L. Barnes' Black Sexualities: Probing Powers, Passions, Practices, and Policies (2010), they identified the Platinum Age of hip-hop to be from 1995 to 2006, where Fiasco promotes a more flexible understanding of Black masculine identity by presenting an alternative to the prevailing Platinum Age values. They suggested how artists like Fiasco could expand the narrow and traditional view dominating hip-hop, seeing how Fiasco's background, steeped in the glorification of gangs and drugs, could have made him conform to conventional norms of the era, instead choosing to craft a distinctive persona. Battle and Barnes added, \"Lupe's identity, then, is quintessentially postmodern,\" viewing him as a compelling contrast to artists like Jay-Z, who they argue often explore themes of Black masculine authenticity in a more limited manner. Kamaludeen Mohamed Nasir, in Representing Islam: Hip-Hop of the September 11 Generation (2020), praises Sunni rappers such as Lupe Fiasco, Mos Def, and Q-Tip as examples of hip-hop's Afrohumanism and positivity. Nasir highlighted their use of Arabic language as a counterpoint to hegemonic dominance of English in rap. Brian Flota and Joseph P. Fisher, authors of The Politics of Post-9/11 Music: Sound, Trauma, and the Music Industry in the Time of Terror (2013), assert that Fiasco bridges the gap between entertainment and education, particularly evident in Food & Liquor with its commentary on the Diamond Age, poverty, crime, and America's own acts of terrorism. They contend that Fiasco's outspoken nature and potential association with radical Muslim identity underscore the challenges of voicing dissent in post-9/11 America, reflecting broader concerns about threats both foreign and domestic.[114]\n\nHip-hop heavyweights quickly recognized Lupe Fiasco's talent early in his career, where Jay-Z described him as \"refreshing\" to The Source in 2003, and Nas co-signed to XXL in 2007, \"I'll listen to anything he do. That n-gga really cool as a muthafucka. He's fun and it ain't just about being lyrical, 'cause some idiots get scared off that road.\" The two also named him to remind them of a younger version of themselves. GZA from Wu-Tang Clan complimented Fiasco's public image, seeing him as \"an example for these young dudes\" due to his lyricism, engaging storytelling, and authenticity.[115] Peers like Pharrell dubbed Fiasco the \"future of hip-hop,\" and Kanye West called him \"super gangsta\" in spite of the perceived nerd persona.[116] Ab-Soul expressed his admiration in an interview with XXL, saying, \"Of course, I am an avid Lupe follower. I hold it dear to the concepts that he presents and the ideas that he was into. It's all to provoke thought. I like when people oppose.\"[117] Cornel West has called Fiasco \"the most important hip-hop artist of his generation,\"[3] and praised his courage in vocalizing opinions and supporting them through action, stating, \"You can appreciate the artistic contributions for a lot of different musicians. But the ones that have your heart are the ones who are full of heart and deep love in taking a political risk over and over and over again.\"[118] Brother Ali held similar views, calling Fiasco \"very sincere and genuine,\" adding, \"He preaches it like he feels it. That's what we should want from artists. We should want people they give it to us raw and uncut and without filter. I support him. I think he's an important person for Hip Hop culture.\"[119]\n\nHeralded as the savior of hip-hop, Fiasco's album Lasers experienced a downturn that polarized both fans and critics. His high-profile battle with Atlantic Records continued for two more albums before he fulfilled his contract and took the independent route. He claimed he was now a \"D-list celebrity,\" and ventured into the academic side since he completed the phases of commercial, cultural, and entrepreneurial. He opted to \"pop out every once in a while,\" then teach at MIT.[60]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nFiasco was born a Sunni Muslim and has observed how his faith to an extent influences everything he does, especially as a rapper and within the music business: \"I don't go to clubs, I don't drink, I don't smoke, you know like my whole—the whole groupie situation is shut down.\" He clarified that while Islam plays a significant role for him, he prefers not to be seen as a spokesperson for the religion or to publicly highlight it, as he doesn't want people to equate his personal flaws with Islam itself.[120] He has an English-born stepfather who was a \"Zimbabwean freedom fighter and activist\" and appeared in Thomas Mapfumo's biography, being Mapfumo's sound engineer for many years.[121]\n\nFiasco is an avid fan of martial arts, sports cars, GT Racing, video games, and anime. He grew up closely following the success of the Chicago Bulls and has a personal connection with the Chicago Bears. He shared to ESPN, \"The '85 Bears did these stylized posters. Jim McMahon redid 'Miami Vice,' and they showed him in a suit with an Uzi. When they showed Mike Singletary, he was a samurai, cutting the football in half. The armor he had on was my father's. My father was a big guy, and it was the only samurai armor they could find in the city that was big enough to fit [Singletary].\"[122] In 2010, he started the book club, The Readers, to promote literacy. On December 6, 2019, he stated he was \"more culturally Japanese than I am African,\"[123] which he previously articulated in his 2007 song, \"Gold Watch\": \"I am American mentality with Japanese tendencies.\" In 2022, he established Société Internationale d'Ur, an association for the world's oldest recorded board game.\n\nFiasco refrained from voting in U.S. elections until 2018, citing his reservations about Donald Trump's racial views as a factor in his decision. He announced on Twitter that he would be supporting Democratic candidates, though in 2023, implied that he had still never voted. He endorsed Cornel West's 2024 presidential campaign, saying it would be the \"first and last time\" he would vote.[124]\n\nBusiness and ventures[]\n\nIn 2001, Fiasco and Chilly co-founded the entertainment company, 1st & 15th Entertainment, named after bi-monthly paychecks. The company had local in-house producers and musicians, and operated as an imprint of Atlantic Records. In 2009, Fiasco folded the company to focus on other aspects of his career.[35] Despite this, the 1st & 15th brand continues to be marketed on all his releases. In 2005, he established Righteous Kung Fu, a company involved in designing fashions, sneakers, toys, video games, comic books, and graphics for album covers and skateboard decks. Its fashion line, Trilly & Truly, worked with the late Virgil Abloh, who designed their collections and graphics. In 2013, Fiasco assumed the role of Creative Director at Higi, an app promoting well-being and a healthier lifestyle through a scoring system.[125] He also started the website and company WOLF Studio to host his abstract works.[126] In 2017, Fiasco and Bonnie Chan Woo founded the production company Studio SV, debuting their first project, Beat n Path, in 2018. In February 2021, he introduced LFTs (a play on the abbreviated non-fungible token), utilizing the Ethereum blockchain for security. LFTs function as digital passes for fans, granting access to exclusive features, merchandise, and bonuses, aiming to build a community bridging hip-hop and technology. He has written articles for Chicago Sun-Times, Michigan Avenue, and Wired.\n\nEndorsements and partnerships[]\n\nMain article: Fashion\n\nFiasco has collaborated with a variety of companies and streetwear brands, including with Kia, Pepsi, Google, Maharishi, and Swagger. In 2006, Fiasco entered into an endorsement deal with Reebok, becoming a face of their \"I Am What I Am\" campaign. As part of this agreement, he was prohibited from purchasing shoes from other brands.[127] This restriction led to him receiving a cease and desist letter, after appearing on the cover of Billboard magazine wearing Nike SB Blazer Mission, which were sourced from stock images. The magazine apologized on his behalf, unaware of his deal, though Reebok severed ties with him.[128]\n\nIn 2008, he was an opening act for Kanye West's Glow in the Dark Tour, where he sported a specially made pair of Dita Midnight Special sunglasses.[129] That same year, he began the fashion line Fallacy of Rome (FoR) in collaboration with FALSE founders Le Messie and Amanda Scully.[130] Together they released several collections, though Fiasco would give up creative direction, as he was overwhelmed by other commitments and workload.[131] He would've been featured on an original song for the Nike+ Original Run series, though his sample was unable to be cleared. It was reported of him designing an exclusive pair of Nike Air Force 1 iD's for Fallacy of Rome, with only four pairs made available at a retail price of $2,000 each.[132] He worked with Greedy Genius and Converse, respectively creating the Paratrooper and Converse Chuck Taylors. His work with Converse was part of the brand's (Product) RED campaign, where a percentage of the proceeds went towards combatting AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis.[133]\n\nIn 2009, he participated in Nike Basketball's 2009 MVP musical comedy commercials, where he performed as Blitzen, a brazen reindeer who aims a diss track at Kris Kringle, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James. In response, Kris challenges him to a basketball match where Kris, Kobe, and LeBron annihilate the reindeer on the court.[134][135]\n\nIn 2012, Fiasco was announced as the brand ambassador for Vans OTW. He was also the face of U.S. Alteration's Spring/Summer 2012, Spring/Summer 2013, and Fall 2013 collections. In 2014, he was a model on the runway for Australian menswear label Song for the Mute's fashion show during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. In 2018, he created the clothing brand Cobra Deportes Electrónarcos that works in line with his esports team,[136] and in 2021, established Nishigawa Iaido Club.\n\nIn 2023, he collaborated with Google to create the AI language app TextFX that helps compose raps. The app went on to win three Webby Awards, a recognition presented annually by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences for excellence on the Internet.[137] In 2024, he appeared in an ad for Google Gemini, where he attended the annual developer conference Google I/O on May 14.[138]\n\nAppearances in other media[]\n\nFiasco made cameo appearances on the television shows One Tree Hill and Empire as himself. He was also a commentator in the documentaries The People Speak (2009), Summit on the Summit (2010), Monochrome (2021), and Fight the Power: How Hip Hop Changed the World (2023). He was credited as the moderator for the short documentary film, The Revenge of Emmett Till (2016).\n\nIn 2019, he was a guest judge on the Netflix's music competition show Rhythm + Flow, for the Chicago preliminary auditions. In 2021, he appeared in the film Amen Break, documenting Virgil Abloh's Spring/Summer 2022 collection.\n\nPhilanthropy[]\n\nMain article: Philanthropy\n\nOur dad's pledge or plea was to make your community better than you found it. Lupe chose music.\n\nAyesha Jaco explaining her's and Fiasco's involvement in the arts[139]\n\nFiasco has used his platform for advocacy and charitable endeavors. He co-founded the non-profit charity organization M.U.R.A.L. with his sister, Ayesha Jaco, aimed to assist inner-city youth; participated in Summit on the Summit to raise awareness about the global water crisis; invested in Zero Mass Water, the tech company focused on providing clean and sustainable drinking water; and supported movements like Occupy Wall Street, which protests economic inequality and corporate greed, and Project Orange Tree, that calls an end to structural violence.[140]\n\nOn What's Trending, when asked if social involvement is a responsibility for artists, Fiasco responded, \"I think charity and being socially responsible is a responsibility for everyone. We're human beings, we're tribal creatures. In a group, it's how we survive. That's the nature of our kind of existence. And so you definitely have to have a responsibility for other people that are around you. You know, to see them succeed and what have you. Or just to see them do better. So I think that's beyond me being an artist, even if I wasn't an artist I'll be doing the same thing. When I wasn't famous, I was doing the same thing. When I didn't have money, I was doing the same thing. I'm still helping wherever I could.\"[141]\n\nDiscography[]\n\nMain article: Discography\n\nSee also: List of songs\n\nStudio albums\n\nLupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor (2006)\n\nLupe Fiasco's The Cool (2007)\n\nLasers (2011)\n\nFood & Liquor II: The Great American Rap Album Pt. 1 (2012)\n\nTetsuo & Youth (2015)\n\nDrogas Light (2017)\n\nDrogas Wave (2018)\n\nDrill Music in Zion (2022)\n\nSamurai (2024)\n\nFilmography[]\n\nMain article: Videography\n\nBeat n Path (2018)\n\nTours[]\n\nMain article: List of live performances\n\nHeadlining\n\nThe Cool Tour (2008)\n\nSteppin' Laser Tour (2010)\n\nGeneration Laser Tour (2011)\n\nTetsuo & Youth Tour (2013)\n\nTour for the Fans (2016)\n\nLupe Fiasco on Tour (2017)\n\n2018 Lupe Fiasco Tour (2018)\n\nDrogas Wave Tour (2018)\n\n2021 Food & Liquor Tour (2021-22)\n\n2022 UK Tour (2022)\n\nThe Cool 15th Anniversary Tour (2022)\n\nSamurai Tour (2024)\n\nCo-headlining\n\nRock the Roots Music Tour (2018)\n\nSupporting\n\nThe Roots 2007 Tour (2007)\n\nGlow in the Dark Tour (2008)\n\nIsland Glow Tour (2023)\n\nAwards and nominations[]\n\nWith his first four albums, Fiasco was consecutively nominated for Best Rap Album at the Grammy Awards.
