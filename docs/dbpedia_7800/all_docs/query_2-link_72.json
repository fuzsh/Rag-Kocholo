        "text": "After selling out shows earlier this summer at the Puerto Rican Traveling Theatre, the musical La Lupe: My Life, My Destiny will now move several blocks uptown to Manhattan's Theatre Four Aug. 23 for an open-ended run. Performances at the new venue began Aug. 17. The musical by Carmen Rivera centers around Latina music legend Guadalupe Victoria Yoli â€” known as La Lupe. The Cuban-born singer who once sold millions of records, performed with the likes of Tito Puente, and appeared on television shows like \"The Merv Griffin Show\"and \"The Dick Cavett Show,\" fell into obscurity in the 1980s.\n\nLa Lupe stars Sully Diaz as the music icon under the direction of Luis Caballero. Filling out the cast are Eddie Marrero, Marley Rivera, Monica Perez Brandes and Gilberto Arribas. The production includes sets by Salvatore Tagliarino, lighting by Chris Dallos and costumes by A. Christina Giannini. musical arrangements are by Oscar Hernandez.\n\nThe production features 12 of La Lupe's best known songs. Performances are in English on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 8 PM. Spanish performances are on Tuesdays and Fridays evenings as well as both matinee and evening performances on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nFor tickets to La Lupe call TeleCharge at (212) 239-6200 or visit the PRTT, 304 West 47th Street, or Theatre Four box office, 424 West 55th Street.
