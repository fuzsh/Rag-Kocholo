        "text": "Her voice comes out of her knees,\n\nher fingernails are full of sound,\n\nBirds are in her lungs,\n\nwhich gives her gargantuan flight,\n\nA florescence through ether waves,\n\nlike ancestral Morse codes.\n\nOriente province de Cuba\n\nher first steps.\n\nAt nineteen she dismantled retinas—\n\nroosters blew themselves inside out,\n\nWhen she swayed by cathedrals they folded,\n\nguayacan trees fell to their knees,\n\nMountains bowed with the contents\n\nfor ajiaco.\n\nShe filled the horizon with kerchiefs,\n\ngypsies danced behind her,\n\nHer bracelets were snakes,\n\nforces were captured in her gold chains,\n\nThe moon was in her silver,\n\nthere were reptiles stationed\n\nIn her Afro-Siboney cheeks,\n\nthere were in her Asian eyes\n\nRadars picking up the fingertips\n\nof the piano player—\n\nThe language of the trumpet—\n\nblack changos landing upon\n\nThe shelf of her eyelids.\n\nShe motioned in songs to live them.\n\nHer passion destroyed the container,\n\nShe blew up into false promises,\n\nromantic lyrics tied her in knots,\n\nBroken into pieces of kisses,\n\nshe knew it was “theater”\n\nThat you offered,\n\nA landscape hanging in the\n\nmuseums of desire,\n\nRows of guayava paste,\n\nstories that according\n\nTo your point of view,\n\nsalons of dried roses.\n\nIllusions.\n\nHer songs became the windows\n\nof the city,\n\nIn the distance a hurt bellows\n\nfrom a bird locked in a radio.\n\nClassroom teacher of tropical children,\n\nreading to them native flora—\n\nA wind entered her and she flew to\n\nNew York,\n\neating the skyline,\n\nBridges of electric lights,\n\nconduits to the house of the Saints.\n\nAt the Jefferson Theater\n\nshe melted the microphone\n\nInto liquid mercury,\n\nand an ambulance had to\n\nGet her off the stage.\n\nShe embodied in gowns, capes,\n\ndresses, necklaces, bonnets,\n\nVelvets, suedes, diamond-studded,\n\nflowers, sequins,\n\nAll through which\n\nshe wanted to eat herself\n\nShe salvaged us all,\n\nbut took the radiation.\n\nEach time she sang\n\nshe crossed the sea.\n\nFrom the Bronx\n\nshe went back to Cuba,\n\nAdrift on the sails\n\nof a song.\n\nVictor Hernandez Cruz, “La Lupe” from Maraca: New and Selected Poems 1966-2000.
