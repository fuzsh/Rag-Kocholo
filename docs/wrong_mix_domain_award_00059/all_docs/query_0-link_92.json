This group includes some of the greatest scientists, writers, economists and peacemakers in the world.\n\nThe five original Nobel awards were expanded in 1968 to include the Economic Sciences (normally known as the Nobel Prize in Economics). Prizes are awarded every December 10th to coincide with the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death. Often controversial — as was Alfred Nobel himself — and at other times a nearly unanimous choice, the winners chosen by the Norwegian Nobel Committee (Peace), the Swedish Academy (Literature), the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (Physics, Chemistry and Economics) and the Karolinska Institute (Physiology or Medicine) don’t make history, but they do help write it.\n\nOn the October 21, 1833, Alfred Bernhard was born in Stockholm, Sweden, third son of Immanuel and Andriette Nobel. Although in the coming years the young Alfred was pampered by his older brothers, the instability of the family’s financial situation was always apparent, and a threat of prison hung over Immanuel Nobel because of his debts. In 1837 Immanuel Nobel moved to Finland and then to the Russian city of Saint Petersburg, where he was finally able to rebuild his capital and the family’s honor.\n\nAlfred Nobel’s father found his son had a melancholic, idealistic side, and he ordered him at just 17 to embark on an extensive educational journey to expand his horizons and increase his interest in business. He also intended to expose his son to developments in the field of engineering, and explosives in particular. Alfred certainly benefited from studying abroad, meeting the brightest scientific minds of his day. In Paris he spent time with the inventor of nitroglycerin, the Italian Ascanio Sobrero, and in the United States he received lessons from the Swedish engineer John Ericsson.\n\nIn 1852 his father called him home to become more involved in the family business, which was booming at the time because of orders from the Russian military. Immanuel Nobel had first come into contact with the world of explosives through civil construction and believed that his future in Russia lay in this rapidly changing field. His inventions include deadly land and sea mines, and he was responsible for the most important Russian armaments factory during the Crimean War. The end of this conflict, however, brought another wave of difficulties to Immanuel and, in 1863, facing bankruptcy once again, he left his elder sons, Robert and Ludvig, to run the Russian businesses and returned with his wife and two younger sons, Alfred and Emil, to Stockholm.\n\nWhile the family industries experienced a boom during the Crimean War, Alfred had devoted himself to studying explosives, particularly nitroglycerin. This compound was as dangerous as it was powerful, since its explosion could be set off by shock or heat. Nobel knew that if he could somehow tame nitroglycerin, it would become an unbeatable commercial product.\n\nOne of the first experiments, performed in 1864, went horribly wrong and several people died in the explosion, including the young Emil Nobel. The Swedish authorities put an immediate stop to any new experiments within Stockholm, but neither this, nor the loss of his brother, could stop Alfred Nobel. He moved his research center to the banks of Lake Malaren and went back to producing nitroglycerin, experimenting with different types of additives as a way of taming it. He finally achieved his goal in 1866 by mixing nitroglycerin with kieselguhr, thus producing a malleable and safe paste. Months later, on September 19, 1867, Alfred Nobel registered a patent for the new explosive, which he named dynamite.\n\nNobel’s first factories were in Krümmel, Germany, and very remote, allowing him to experiment without risk to the local population. Between 1865 and 1873 Nobel lived in a simple house between Krümmel and Hamburg, where the family’s offices were located. During World War I Krümmel, with 2,700 employees, supplied the German army’s gunpowder needs. The Versailles Treaty put an end to this contract, however, and during peace the factory was used to produce artificial silk. With the arrival of World War II, Krümmel was once again at the service of the German war interests, with more than 9,000 workers. The facilities were destroyed in 1945 by an Allied air raid, with bombs based on the inventions of Nobel himself.\n\nDynamite was, without a doubt, Alfred Nobel’s most famous invention, but the list of his other accomplishments is long. In 1887 he created ballistite; known as smokeless gunpowder, this compound is made of 40 percent nitrocellulose and 60 percent nitroglycerin. The explosive was originally intended for the mining industry, but its appearance coincided with a tumultuous period at the end of the 19th century, when governments were scrambling to acquire new military technology. When the patent was made public, Alfred Nobel offered his product to the French government, but they turned the proposal down. When he offered ballistite to the Italians, however, they did not hesitate in accepting, and a large production facility was built near Turin.\n\nThrough more than 30 productive years of experimentation and developments carried out in Sweden, Germany, France, Italy and other nations around the world, Alfred Nobel never stopped applying himself to the tasks he undertook, whether it was to produce artificial silk or the most powerful explosives of the day. When he died he had put his name to no less than 355 patents, many of them now applicable to the fabrics industry and used in more than 20 countries.\n\nAlthough just before his 30th birthday Alfred Nobel decided to rejoin his parents in Stockholm, the city had not been his primary residence for some time. Until the end of his days at the age of 63, Alfred Nobel was a constant pilgrim. He kept a house, ready to be lived in, in six different countries. My home is where I am found working, he wrote, and I work anywhere. He also kept completely equipped laboratories in Stockholm and Karlskoga (Sweden), Hamburg (Germany), Ardeer (Scotland), Paris and Sevran (France) and San Remo (Italy).\n\nAlfred Nobel lived and died as one of the earliest citizens of the world, and this lifestyle was a deeply interwoven part of his personality. He can be considered one of the founding fathers of multinational corporations. Many of the companies he founded still exist today and are at the forefront of their industrial field, including companies like Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), Société Centrale de Dynamite and Dyno Industries.\n\nAlfred Nobel’s Will\n\nWhen he reached the age of 60, Alfred Nobel began to make arrangements for his vast fortune after his death. He wrote his will himself, without any legal assistance, and signed it on November 27, 1895, in a room of the Swedish-Norwegian Club in Paris, witnessed by four friends.\n\nNobel gave part of his inheritance to his nieces, nephews and closest collaborators, and he left lifelong pensions to his most dedicated employees, but the amounts he bequeathed to these individuals were smaller than expected (considering the size of his fortune) and criticized by many.\n\nThe excerpt from the will below deals exclusively with establishing the annual prizes.\n\nThe whole of my remaining realizable estate shall be dealt with in the following way: The capital shall be invested by my executors in safe securities and shall constitute a fund, the interest on which shall be annually distributed in the form of prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind. The said interest shall be divided into five equal parts, which shall be apportioned as follows: one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field of physics; one part to the person who shall have made the most important chemical discovery or improvement; one part to the person who shall have made the most important discovery within the domain of physiology or medicine; one part to the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work of an idealistic tendency; and one part to the person who shall have done the most or best work for the fraternity among nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses. The prizes for physics and chemistry shall be awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences; that for physiology or medical work by the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm; that for literature by the Academy in Stockholm; and that for champions of peace by a committee of five persons to be elected by the Norwegian Storting. It is my express wish that in awarding the prizes no consideration whatever shall be given to the nationality of the candidates, so that the most worthy shall receive the prize, whether he be a Scandinavian or not.\n\nNobel finished his will with a list of his assets, including his properties in Paris and San Remo, an endless list of activities in banks and other credit institutions, and the income from his patents, whose registers he stated were guarded in his safe. The immense fortune was calculated at the time to be worth about 31 million Swedish Krona, and interest with careful management by the Foundation has been swelling the coffers for more than a century.\n\nThe Prize\n\nThe idea of creating prizes to award individual artists and scientists for their efforts is rooted in the French Revolution. Throughout the 19th century there were plenty of awards given to academies, clubs and administrations, but it wasn’t until the second half of the century that private foundations began to bestow their own prizes.\n\nWhat is it, however, that makes the Nobel Prize different from others and grants it the recognition and support it has today? First of all, as is very clear in Alfred Nobel’s will and contrary to other contemporary examples, it is a universal award, and there was no intention of benefiting a specific nation. Also to be noted is that Nobel did not create one prize but five (the sixth, for Economic Sciences, was only created in 1968.) The recognition offered by the prizes is, therefore, more complete, bringing together a diverse group of talents from fields that usually have little interaction. The most important point that distinguished the Nobel Prize from other awards, however, was the large sum given to the laureates. In addition to the prize money, a diploma and medal were also presented, which was not specified in Nobel’s will.\n\nAlthough there is great importance in a scientist, writer or pacifist seeing their work published in consequence of being given an award, the Nobel means much more. For the first time there existed a prize with which scientists could continue their investigations without traditional economic limitations, writers could avoid commercial temptations and follow their more creative desires, and pacifists could, against powerful forces, maintain campaigns that could only be kept alive with financial support.\n\nThe first people to receive the Nobel Prize took home approximately 150,000 Swedish Krona. In 1923, as a result of an increase in taxes, smaller quantities were awarded, and each laureate received 115,000 Swedish Krona. In 1946 the Nobel Foundation was finally guaranteed an exemption from taxes, which led to the prizes increasing in worth. In 2006 each of the six laureates was given the highest amounts ever: 10 million Swedish Krona, equivalent to about US$1 million.\n\nOn December 10th of every year, to coincide with the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death, the award ceremonies for five of the six Nobel prizes are held in Stockholm, Sweden; the exception is the Nobel Peace Prize, which is presented in Oslo, Norway. The laureates present Nobel lectures several days before the ceremonies in Stockholm and on the day of the event in Oslo. These ceremonies are attended by Their Majesties the King and Queen of Sweden and Norway, respectively, in addition to the laureates, their families and other distinguished guests. Lavish banquets follow the event.\n\nThe honors are conferred in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, peace and economics, unless no laureate has been chosen in a given field. As with almost any event, the work that takes place beforehand is of vital importance. The selection process for the people, or institutions, as is sometimes the case with the Nobel Peace Prize, to be awarded are meticulous and performed with a great sense of responsibility since the world will scrutinize every decision.\n\nCandidate selection is carried out by four Nobel Committees that are based within the institutions Nobel’s will made responsible for attributing the awards. Each of these committees is composed of five elected members, the majority of whom are of Swedish origin, with the exception of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Every year the six committees send invitations to hundreds of scientists, academy members and university professors from around the world to nominate an individual for a Nobel Prize; former laureates are also encouraged to put forward a name. There are differences in the rules regarding nomination for the individual prizes, but they are accentuated with the Nobel Peace Prize, which can be recommended by members of national assemblies, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, Hague Permanent Court of Arbitration, the International Law Institutes and governments themselves. According to the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, however, no one prize can be attributed to more than three people in the same year. Additionally, no scientific community, academic institution or organization may receive a prize on their own, except in the case of the Nobel Peace Prize. Since 1974, a Nobel Prize cannot be attributed posthumously.\n\nRoyal Swedish Academy of Sciences\n\nDuring the first half of the 18th century a remarkable group of Swedish scientists were active in the country, and in 1739 the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences was established to help advance their work. Based on the Royal Society in London and the Académie Royale des Sciences (Royal Academy for Sciences) in Paris, it first began to encourage research in the areas of mathematics and the natural sciences. Among its founders were the renowned naturalist Carl Linnaeus, the mercantilist Jonas Alströmer, the mechanical engineer Mårten Triewald and the politician Anders Johan von Höpken, who was the first permanent secretary of the organization.\n\nAlthough it had modest beginnings, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences soon began to develop important contacts with other scientific institutions across Europe. It developed a major program to publish scientific findings and began promoting more applied fields, including agriculture, ship building and mining. At the beginning of the 19th century the chemist Jacob Berzelius was appointed secretary-general. He reorganized the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, making it an institution with strictly scientific objectives.\n\nThe academy continued developing, and, at the beginning of the 20th century, it took on an important role in relation to the Nobel Foundation. Physics and chemistry were two subjects that Alfred Nobel knew well and expected much from in the coming years. He specified in his will that a prize should be awarded in both fields, and he chose the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to attribute the awards.\n\nIn 1968 the society was made responsible for attributing the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic in Memory of Alfred Nobel, commonly known as the Nobel Prize in Economics. It was awarded for the first time the following year. Economics is the only prize not referred to in the will of Alfred Nobel but the Bank of Sweden, on its 300th anniversary, established a considerable financial commitment to the Nobel Foundation in perpetuity. This commitment has allowed those who have made contributions to mathematic formulation, financial economics, game theories and macroeconomics to be recognized. Some have challenged whether the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic in Memory of Alfred Nobel fairly mirrors current tendencies in economic analysis, but most accept that decisions are stimulated by the multidimensional nature of economic investigation.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has approximately 350 native members and half that number again from foreign countries. Each member is part of one of the following 10 divisions: mathematics, astronomy and space sciences, physics, chemistry, geosciences, biological sciences, medical sciences, engineering sciences, social and economic sciences and the humanities. These members work within their divisions and permanent committees, contributing to their respective fields of research and presenting conferences and seminars.\n\nCurrent social and environmental issues are also monitored by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. It continues to promote innovative studies, and the Environmental Committee is dedicated to questions regarding sustainable development, natural resource use and maintaining biological diversity. The society’s journal Ambio is recognized as a leading forum for environmental issues. Two other committees in the society are those for Science Education and Human Rights, demonstrating the diverse nature of its work. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences also runs the Observatory and Berzelius museums, which have impressive collections of scientific artifacts and other resources.\n\nThe Karolinska Institute\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, Alfred Nobel recognized the pressing need for humanity to develop its medical knowledge, products and procedures. He had himself suffered from ill health for much of his life and experienced the primitive help available at the time. Accordingly, he specified in his will that a prize was to be set aside for this field, and in 1901 the first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was conferred by the Karolinska Institute. The first winner was the German Emil von Behring, who was distinguished for his work on serum therapy, especially its application against diphtheria, by which he has opened a new road in the domain of medical science and thereby placed in the hands of the physician a victorious weapon against illness and death.\n\nThe difficult mission of choosing up to three people annually for this prize is still in the hands of the Karolinska Institute, located in Solna, just outside Stockholm. It initially entrusted the selection process of the nominees to its teaching staff, but nowadays the Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute is composed of 50 elected members of the Faculty of Medicine.\n\nThe organization continues to train doctors, dentists, physiotherapists, speech therapists and toxicologists. It also maintains a strong academic research department responsible for nearly 40 percent of such work in the country. According to the 2007 Academic Ranking of World Universities, it is the best such department in the country and 11th in Europe. Besides its close ties to the Nobel Foundation, the institute also preserves valuable relationships with the Swedish government and health organizations, businesses and other universities worldwide.\n\nSwedish Academy\n\nSince 1901 the Swedish Academy has had the responsibility of attributing the Nobel Prize in Literature. The academy was established in 1786 by King Gustaf III. He personally wrote most of its statutes, having been inspired by the French Academy; he also conferred on the institution its motto, Snille och smak (Talent and good taste). The main objective drawn up for the academy by Gustaf III was to work for the purity, vigor and majesty of the Swedish language. In the monarch’s understanding, the academy had a patriotic duty to elevate the country’s language and literature, as well as commemorate great national events of the past.\n\nWith the turn of the century, and after much debate, the academy accepted a task that was not a part of its initial mandate: to spend a considerable portion of its capacities to annually attribute the Nobel Prize in Literature. Erik Axel Karlfeldt, who, during the time he was permanent secretary between 1913 and 1931, revitalized and modernized the Swedish Academy, opened its doors to new writers and electing the first woman to its team.\n\nNorwegian Nobel Committee\n\nIn accordance with the wishes of Alfred Nobel, the laureates for the Nobel Peace Prize are chosen by an independent committee composed of five people elected by the Norwegian Parliament and have been since 1901. These vague directions, however, have been controversial and sparked some degree of change.\n\nThe challenge for the Norwegian Nobel Committee is to be impartial in their decisions; many claim that this was far from true in the early years, when most members selected by Parliament were influential politicians. Over the decades this committee has also achieved a certain status, since it does not work in the favor of public opinion or political authorities.\n\nIn contrast to the other categories, the Nobel Peace Prize can be attributed to institutions and organizations as well as individuals. The Norwegian Nobel Committee does not receive outside orders of any nature and, in accordance with the statutes of the Nobel Foundation, should not reveal anything that takes place within the meetings that lead to the selection of the laureates. To such ends, the members do not take part in the debates that follow the announcement of the decision.\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Institute was created in 1904 and, in 1905, it moved into a classic mansion in the centre of Oslo. At the time the site was completely renovated, and the Nobel Foundation was criticized for spending too much money on the work. The main obligation of the Norwegian Nobel Institute is to support to the Norwegian Nobel Committee during the selection process of laureates, as well as to organize events in Oslo dedicated to the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nAs a way of showing its status as the center of knowledge related to peace and world questions in general, the institute has created a library with approximately 175,000 volumes. The works available in the library are principally concerned with peace, international relations, law, economics and political history. The library is open to the public and has a pleasant reading room. The institute also organizes seminars, meetings and conferences with specialists from around the world.\n\nThey laugh at me, the man of dynamite as a man of peace. But, since men don’t listen to reason, it is necessary to invent an instrument of death which, through fear, will make Humanity move to peace. — Alfred Nobel\n\nSelected Profiles of Nobel Laureates\n\n1901-1909\n\nSully Prudhomme (1839–1907)\n\n1901 Literature\n\nIn special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of lofty idealism, artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect.\n\nRené François Armand Prudhomme, better known by his literary pseudonym Sully Prudhomme, did not begin his career with the world of letters in mind. The son of a storekeeper, he intended to study science and enrolled in a polytechnic institute. An eye disease, however, forced him to change his plans. The disappointed young Frenchman soon turned to literature and took pleasure in the study, recording his thoughts and reading avidly. Nevertheless, Prudhomme was not able to make a living from his writing, so he accepted a clerical position in a factory. Understandably dissatisfied, he left the factory in 1860, determined to study law, and he soon began working in a lawyer’s office.\n\nDuring this time he was a member of the distinguished student society Conférence La Bruyère, and it was here that Prudhomme heard the first words of encouragement for his literary pursuits. In 1865, at just 26, he published his first work, Stances et poèmes (Stanzas and Poems), a collection of fluent, melancholic poems inspired by a passionate dissatisfaction with life. Sainte-Beuve, a writer and influential French literary critic, gave the book a favorable review, which helped Prudhomme’s reputation. One of these early poems, Le vase brisé (The Broken Vase), remains popular today.\n\nIn 1866 Les Épreuves (Trials) was published and, three years, later came Les Solitudes. These works, similar in style and content to Stances et poèmes, are dominated by romanticism and emotionalism. It was not long, however, before this early lyrical phase of his writing evolved. This change is credited to the influence of the Parnassian school, of which he would go on to become a preeminent member. Presenting philosophical concepts in verse dominated Prudhomme’s latter poetical works, particularly La Justice (Justice, published in 1878) and Le Bonheur (Happiness, 1888).\n\nPrudhomme’s literary career was characterized by intense activity, as can be seen by his vast bibliography. Besides his best-known works listed above, he wrote Croquis italiens (Italian Notebook, 1866-68), Impressions de la guerre (Impressions of War, 1870), Les Destins (Destinies, 1872), La Révolte des fleurs (Revolt of the Flowers, 1872), La France (1874), Les vaines tendresses (Vain Endearments, 1875) and many others.\n\nIn 1881, aged 42, Sully Prudhomme was elected a member of the prestigious French Academy, which demonstrated his peers’ respect and admiration for him. His highest level of recognition came when he was awarded the 1901 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nJean Henry Dunant (1828–1910)\n\n1901 Peace\n\nFor actions developing the organization of the Geneva Conventions of 1863 and 1864 and the International Red Cross, created by these conventions.\n\nJean Henry Dunant seemed destined to dedicate his life to others. The son of a respected and prosperous couple, he grew up in Geneva, Switzerland, admiring his parents’ philanthropic efforts within their community. At the age of six, he went with his father, Jean Jacques, on a visit to a penitentiary in Toulon, France. For the little Dunant, the sight of the chained prisoners was shocking and had lasting effects. Later in life, this memory led him to dedicate his Sunday afternoons to visiting prisoners.\n\nEntering the world of business, Dunant first went to Algeria, where he managed an estate. A number of difficulties arose for him in the French territory, however, due to his Swiss citizenship. He decided that the best hope of resolving his problems was to speak personally with Emperor Napoleon III and convince the Emperor to grant him concessions to explore new lands. When news arrived that Napoleon III was leading French troops in Italy to expel the Austrians at what was to be the Battle of Solferino, Dunant made his way north to meet the Emperor.\n\nWhen he arrived at Solferino, however, his intentions were shattered upon witnessing the violence of the fighting. When the battle was over, one of the bloodiest of the 19th century, Dunant put his own concerns aside and began ministering to the needy. In 1862 he published A Memory of Solferino. The book brought him fame and presented a detailed plan to create a structure aimed at supporting the wounded in times of war. This effort led to the formation of the International Red Cross, which he established in 1863. It was recognized a year later by the Geneva Convention, and the idea was worthy of the first Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nDunant set aside his business concerns to dedicate himself to helping others, and it is no surprise that he went bankrupt in 1867. After his setbacks in business, which also involved some of his friends in Geneva, Dunant was no longer welcome in his hometown. Instead he chose to live in Heiden, a small Swiss town, where he lived mostly in obscurity. He fell ill in 1892 and was transferred to the hospital in Heiden, where he would die 18 years later.\n\nAfter 1895, while Dunant remained hospitalized, he was recognized more frequently and was honored with various prizes, including the Order of Christ in 1897, awarded by Portugal. Dunant, who never married or had children, maintained his generosity to the end, giving the money from his prizes to those who cared for him in the hospital and to humanitarian institutions in Norway and Switzerland.\n\nFrédéric Passy also received half of the prize.\n\nEmil Fischer (1852–1919)\n\n1902 Chemistry\n\nIn recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by his work on sugar and purine syntheses.\n\nHermann Emil Fischer always possessed an excellent memory, a fascination with scientific problems and a rare determination to prove hypotheses. These characteristics were essential for someone who would go on to become one of the greatest scientists of all time. Against his father’s will, who would have liked his son to continue the family timber business in Cologne, Germany, Fischer pursued the natural sciences, especially physics, and was rewarded for his dedication.\n\nAfter three years with a private tutor, the young German attended the local school. He also studied in Wetzlar and Bonn, where he passed his final exam with distinction in 1869. Faced with his son’s insistence on studying science, his father decided to enroll him in the University of Bonn to study chemistry. What Fischer really wanted, however, was to dedicate himself to physics. One year later, accompanied by his cousin, Otto Fischer, he left for the University of Strasbourg. There he met Adolf von Baeyer, whose influence finally persuaded him to return to chemistry.\n\nIn 1874 he took his doctorate and was also appointed assistant teacher at Strasbourg. He continued his studies and discovered the first hydrazine base, phenylhydrazine, and showed its relationship with hydrazobenzene and sulphonic acid. In 1875, Adolf von Baeyer went to the University of Munich, and Fischer accompanied him as his assistant in the subject of organic chemistry. Later Fischer taught at the universities of Erlangen and Wurzburg, and in 1892 he was invited to the University of Berlin where he stayed until his death.\n\nFischer left his mark on research in every university in which he worked. In Munich he continued his studies in the field of hydrazenes and, along with his cousin Otto, formulated a new theory on the constitution of dyes derived from triphenylmethane. In Erlangen he studied the active ingredients of tea, coffee and cocoa and established the constitution of a series of components in this field. His work on sugars between 1884 and 1894 were significant, particularly his synthesis of glucose, fructose and mannose and his studies of glycosides.\n\nHis research into purines and sugars was recognized with the 1902 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and Fischer also contributed to the study of proteins, enzymes and other chemical substances. His dedication to chemistry was further acknowledged with the Hofmann Medal from the German Chemical Society in 1906, the Elliot Cresson Gold Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1913, and many other distinctions. After his death, the German Chemical Society initiated a prize in his name, the Emil Fischer Memorial Medal.\n\nSvante Arrhenius (1859–1927)\n\n1903 Chemistry\n\nIn recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered to the advancement of chemistry by his electrolytic theory of dissociation.\n\nThe Swede Svante August Arrhenius, father of the ionic theory that explains the movement of electric currents in solutions, was born in Vik to a family of farmers. When he was only a year old his parents moved to Uppsala, where he first attended school; he demonstrated a rare facility for solving mathematical problems and an unusual interest in physics and mathematics.\n\nIn 1876 he entered the University of Uppsala, the oldest university in Sweden, to study mathematics, chemistry and physics. In 1881 he moved to the Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. After working as an assistant to a professor he developed his doctoral thesis on the galvanic conductivity of electrolytes. Arrhenius concluded that electrical conductivity was possible in a solution due to the presence of ions. He was"
