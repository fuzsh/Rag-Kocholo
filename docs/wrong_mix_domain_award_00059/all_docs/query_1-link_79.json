        "text": "David W C MacMillan has become the latest Scot to win the prestigious Nobel Prize.\n\nThe Bellshill-born scientist was honoured alongside Benjamin List for developing a new tool for molecular construction.\n\nHe’s thought to be the 15th Scot to become a Novel Laureate – awarded annually to the greatest minds in a variety of disciplines.\n\nSo, who are the others?\n\nWilliam Ramsay (1904)\n\nThe Glasgow-born chemist discovered the noble gases, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\nHis work led to the development of a new section of the periodic table.\n\nCharles Thomson Rees Wilson (1927)\n\nThe Midlothian-born physicist and meteorologist’s study of clouds led to the invention of the cloud chamber particle detector.\n\nMuch of his work was carried out from an observatory on Ben Nevis, earning him the Nobel Prize for Physics.\n\nJohn J R MacLeod (1928)\n\nBorn in Perthshire, the biochemist devoted his career to physiology and biochemistry.\n\nHe earned the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his role in the discovery of insulin.\n\nArthur Henderson (1934)\n\nThe Glasgow-born Labour leader had spells as home secretary and foreign secretary, but it was after politics where he carried out the work which won him a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nHe was honoured for his efforts with the World League of Peace and chaired the Geneva Disarmament Conference.\n\nIn 2013, his Nobel medal was stolen from the home of the Lord Mayor of Newcastle.\n\nAlexander Fleming (1945)\n\nOne of the most important scientific discoveries of all time earned the East Ayrshire-born scientist the Nobel Prize in Physiology.\n\nThe physician and microbiologist developed penicillin, the world’s first widely effective antibiotic.\n\nHe was also knighted for his achievements, and has frequently been declared one of the 21st century’s most significant figures.\n\nJohn Boyd Orr (1949)\n\nBorn in East Ayrshire, the teacher, doctor, biologist, politician and farmer was the first director-general of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation.\n\nHis scientific research into nutrition earned him the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nAlexander R Todd (1957)\n\nThe Cathcart-born son of a Glasgow Subway clerk got the Nobel Prize for Chemistry.\n\nJames Black (1988)\n\nSir James, who was born in Uddingston, Lanarkshire, and brought up in Fife, developed propranolol, a beta blocker used for the treatment of heart disease.\n\nHis mining family were too poor to send him to university, but he was persuaded by a teacher to sit the St Andrews entrance examination and was offered a place. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1988.\n\nJames Alexander Mirrlees (1996)\n\nSir James was born in the village of Minnigaff, Kirkcudbrightshire, before being educated at Douglas Ewart High School and Edinburgh University.\n\nHe won a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1996 and a year later was knighted in the Queen’s birthday honours.\n\nAngus Deaton (2015)\n\nThe Edinburgh-born professor of international affairs and politics at Princeton was awarded the Nobel Memoria Prize in Economic Sciences in 2015.\n\nThe 75-year-old was educated at Hawick High School and Fettes College.\n\nFraser Stoddart (2016)\n\nSir Fraser Stoddart shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work developing the world’s smallest machines.\n\nThe Edinburgh-born scientist was knighted by the Queen in 2006.\n\nDavid J Thouless (2016)\n\nThe Bearsden-born physicist shared the Nobel Prize for work opening up new possibilities in computing.\n\nRichard Henderson (2017)\n\nThe Edinburgh-born molecular biologist and biophysicist shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Jacques Dubochet and Joachim Frank.\n\nThey were honoured for their work to improve images of biological molecules.\n\nJ Michael Kosterlitz (2016)\n\nBorn in Aberdeen, the professor of physics at Brown University in Rhode Island was honoured for his work on condensed matter physics.\n\nHe was also a pioneer in Alpine climbing in the 1960s, and was known for working routes in the UK, Italian Alps, and Yosemite."
