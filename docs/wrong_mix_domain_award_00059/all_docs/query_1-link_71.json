The instrument, which visualized particles’ tracks as trails of condensed vapour, was adopted by physicists to pursue frontier research on the Compton effect, the positron and the transmutation of atomic nuclei. But as the present paper will show, Wilson's instrument did not just open up new research opportunities, but the possibility of developing a different kind of teaching. Equipped with a powerful visualization tool, some physicists–teachers employed Wilson's instrument to introduce their students to a wide range of phenomena and concepts, ranging from the behaviour of clouds to Einstein's photon, the wave–particle duality and the understanding of the nucleus. This paper uses the notes, books and prototypes of these pioneering physicists–teachers to compose a pedagogical history of the Wilson cloud chamber, documenting an episode of immense ingenuity, creativity and scientific imagination.\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\nThe British Journal for the History of Science , Volume 54 , Issue 2 , June 2021 , pp. 177 - 193\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007087421000261 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © The Author(s), 2021.

In the ‘pressure-driven mechanism’ introduced by Wilson in 1933 the expansion and condensation of the vapour in tracks are not induced by expanding the volume of the chamber but by decreasing the pressure within it: the new apparatus still has a chamber in a horizontal position and a fixed floor made of a porous diaphragm covered with a dark velvet felt: the downward motion of a sheet of thin elastic membrane placed underneath the floor sucked away an amount of gas, reducing the pressure and inducing the condensation.\n\n35\n\n35 Charles Thomson Rees Wilson and J.G.
