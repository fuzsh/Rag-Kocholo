        "text": "Abstract: This paper presents an empirical study on the frequency of discoveries and inventions that were awarded with the. More than 70 per cent of all Nobel Prizes were given to discoveries. The majority of inventions were awarded at the beginning of the twentieth century and only three inventions had a direct application for society. The emphasis on discoveries moves the Nobel Prize further away from its original intention to reward the greatest contribution to society in the preceding year.\n\nThe 250 years from the second half of the seventeenth century saw the birth of modern physics and its growth into one of the most successful of the sciences.The reader will find here the lives of fifty of the most remarkable physicists from that era described in brief biographies. All the characters profiled have made important contributions to physics, through their ideas, through their teaching, or in other ways.The emphasis is on their varied life-stories, not on the details of their achievements, but, when read in sequence, the biographies, which are organized chronologically, convey in human terms something of the way in which physics was created.Scientific and mathematical detail is kept to a minimum, so the reader who is interested in physics, but perhaps lacks the background to follow technical accounts, will find this collection an inviting and easy path through the subject’s modern development.\n\nThe Nobel Prize has acted as a surrogate record of invention and discovery throughout the twentieth century. Based on this surrogacy, many claims are made regarding both trends in research and claims for places of research excellence. In this paper I propose that any analysis should be weighted by the 'prize share' made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to each recipient. In addition, I argue for a focus on the organization and period when the prize-winning research was carried out, rather than when the award was made and the often quoted 'affiliated organization at the time of award'. I use this to briefly examine types of invention and discovery for all Nobel Prizes in Physics awarded to date (1901-2019). I then use this 'place' lens to briefly explore trends in invention and discovery in the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Physics. I conclude by drawing attention to the difference between institutions claiming Nobel Laureates and institutions where Nobel Prize-winning discoveries and inventions have been made.\n\nThe article is devoted to the significance of the study of Nobel laureates in Physics in the development of technology contribution by the students of technical institutions. The basic information about the Nobel laureates in the field of Technical physics is presented. There are traced the basic physical ideas that have established their use in various technical devices and technologies. Particular attention is paid to physical discoveries that determined the form of the late twentieth century technology, in such areas as spectroscopy, laser technology and electronics. The main achievements from the twentieth century and the beginning of the XXI century have also been regarded.\n\nWe briefly discuss the myth of a possible missing letter from Bohr to Lattes and show the only content of the Bohr archives concerning the Brazilian physicist. We also analyze and discuss the Nobel Prize in Physics Nominations and Nominees from 1901 to 1963. For example, the highest number of nominations (considering data up to the year of the Nobel Prize) was received by Otto Stern, with a total of 82 nominations. It was found that the average number of nominations per Nobel Prize awarded was 30.7, and only nine of the total 80 prizewinners surpassed this average. In contrast, it was observed that in many years, there were laureates with just zero, one, two or three nominations - an indicator of high subjectivity, as verified by experts on bibliometric data. From the data presented, it is concluded that Lattes (as well as his colleague, collaborator and friend ‘Beppo’ Occhialini) received enough nominations to be awarded the Nobel Prize not once but twice; thus, the necessity of a letter on this subject remains valid"
