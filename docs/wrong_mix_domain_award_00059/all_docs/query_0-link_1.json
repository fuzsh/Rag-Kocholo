        "text": "C.T.R. Wilson\n\nFacts\n\nCharles Thomson Rees Wilson\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1927\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom\n\nPrize motivation: “for his method of making the paths of electrically charged particles visible by condensation of vapour”\n\nPrize share: 1/2\n\nLife\n\nC.T.R. Wilson was born outside of Edinburgh, Scotland, where his family worked as farmers. After studying zoology, botany, and geology in Manchester, England, he went on to study physics and chemistry at Cambridge. At Cambridge he developed his interest in meteorology and began working on his cloud chamber at Cavendish Laboratory. Wilson remained at Cambridge as a professor of natural philosophy at Sydney Sussex College from 1925. He later returned to Scotland after his retirement. He was married with four children.\n\nWork\n\nIf the volume of a mixture of air and water vapor increases, small water drops form. If the air contains electrically charged particles—ions—then droplet formation occurs around these especially. C.T.R. Wilson exploited this phenomenon when he constructed his cloud chamber in 1911—a glass container with air and water vapor and ingenious devices that allow traces left by ionizing radiation and particles that pass through the chamber to become visible and be photographed. The cloud chamber became an important tool in physics.\n\nTo cite this section\n\nMLA style: C.T.R. Wilson – Facts. NobelPrize.org. Nobel Prize Outreach AB 2024.
