        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Nobel Prizes are annual international awards bestowed by Scandinavian committees in recognition of cultural and scientific advances. The will of the Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, established the prizes in 1895. The prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace were first awarded in 1901. Each Nobel Prize is regarded as the most prestigious award in its field. Many of the winners have been of Scots descent but here are the winners who have been born in Scotland itself.\n\nChemistry\n\nSir William Ramsay, 1904 - discovery of the noble gases.\n\nAlexander Robertus Todd, Baron Todd of Trumpington, 1957 - research on the structure and synthesis of nucleotides, nucleosides, and nucleotide coenzymes.\n\nEconomics\n\nSir James Alexander Mirrlees, 1996 - papers on economic models.\n\nPeace\n\nArthur Henderson, 1934 - worked with the World League of Peace and chaired the Geneva Disarmament Conference.\n\nJohn Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr, 1949 - for advocating a world food policy based on human needs rather than trade interests.\n\nPhysics\n\nCharles Thomson Rees Wilson, 1927 - for his invention of the cloud chamber."
