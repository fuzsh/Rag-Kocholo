First printing of the Second edition (which is a substantial revision of Compton's work X-Rays and Electrons). Light soiling to the boards. Spine sunned, but titling still bright and clean (publisher's gilt lettering faded). Ghosting to endpapers likely from old dj protector. Front flyleaf apparently reglued, resulting in a small amount of waving to the first few pages upper corner. Generally bright and clean internally, with occasional smudges. Very occasional minor penciled note. Copy of physicist CT Knipp. Good. Cloth. [20120]\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1927 was divided equally between Arthur Holly Compton \"for his discovery of the effect named after him\" and Charles Thomson Rees Wilson \"for his method of making the paths of electrically charged particles visible by condensation of vapour\"\n\nThe present work is a revision of Compton's X-Rays and Electrons published in 1926, substantially updating the state of the art in 1935 with significant assistance from Professor Allison.\n\nITEM SOLD"
