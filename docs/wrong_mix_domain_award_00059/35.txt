Introduction

The Nobel Prizes are annual international awards bestowed by Scandinavian committees in recognition of cultural and scientific advances. The will of the Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, established the prizes in 1895. The prizes in Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace were first awarded in 1901. Each Nobel Prize is regarded as the most prestigious award in its field. Many of the winners have been of Scots descent but here are the winners who have been born in Scotland itself.
