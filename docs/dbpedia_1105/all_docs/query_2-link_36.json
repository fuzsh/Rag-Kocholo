        "text": "The Best American made drones offer reliable performance, complete feature sets, and NDAA compliance to operate in critical infrastructure environments.\n\nIn recent years, the drone industry has made a rather large pivot away from foreign drones and shifted to domestic drones.\n\nEnterprise and government organizations operating in the US drone industry are unable to use Chinese made drones.\n\nThese organizations are required to transition away from companies like DJI and find American drones to replace their aging fleet.\n\nWhat Do American Made Drones Exactly Mean?\n\nAmerican made drones are ultimately NDAA-approved drones.\n\nIn the drone industry, “NDAA compliance” is a short way of saying “ensuring supply chain security.”\n\nNDAA compliance involves a federal law that prevents the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) from purchasing drones that fall into one of these categories:\n\nDrones made in a covered foreign country or by a company based in that country.\n\nDrones that use components like flight controllers, radios, data transmission devices, cameras, gimbals, ground control systems, or operating software manufactured in that covered foreign country or by a company based there.\n\nThis law, called Section 848 of the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), identified China as the “covered foreign country.”\n\nSubsequently, in 2022, Congress expanded this law to include Russia, Iran, and North Korea. More recently, Congress made it even broader by including private companies as well.\n\nStarting in October 2024, private companies won’t be able to use DJI drones for Department of Defense contracts.\n\nHowever, drones on the Blue UAS Cleared list are exempt from the DoD’s policy exception requirement because they have undergone cybersecurity and NDAA compliance evaluations, and have been issued the necessary administrative documentation.\n\nThe Blue sUAS 2.0 project has incorporated the following drones into the DIU Blue UAS Cleared List:\n\nIntense Eye V2, by BlueHalo\n\neBee Tac, by senseFly, an AgEagle company\n\nWingtraOne, by Wingtra\n\nSpirit, by Ascent AeroSystems\n\nOsprey Hexacopter, by Easy Aerial\n\nAltaX, by Freefly Systems\n\nX2D (new configuration), by Skydio\n\nEdge 130, by Flightwave\n\nH6 HE, H6 Hydrone and H6, by Harris Aerial\n\nIF750 and IF1200, by Inspired Flight\n\nIt is important to note that the Blue SUAS list is drone-specific, not manufacturer-specific.\n\nThese drones can work in critical environments. They can be inspecting railroads, conducting solar inspections in sensitive environments operated by government entities, or even inspecting our utilities.\n\nThis list does include drones that are made in foreign countries but are in compliance with security standards.\n\nAmerican Drones are approved to fly in American airspace for government entities or to be flown around critical infrastructure.\n\nWhile companies like DJI have vastly dominated the commercial verticals of the industry, they’re being phased out quickly and aggressively.\n\nThe evolution and transition to only domestically made drones have been accelerating.\n\nRecently, Florida enforced a ban on Chinese made drones for public safety and public works agencies. This has caused numerous drone programs to shut down.\n\nThese departments now need to raise new funds to purchase domestically made drones.\n\nWe have a detailed drone guide for public safety that compares many domestically made drones.\n\n11 Best American Made Drones\n\nWhile many new drones have popped up in the marketplace, few drone manufacturers are able to deliver a reliable platform to perform creative and technical tasks.\n\nMany of these new domestically approved or U.S. made drones have been catching up in features and payload offerings, like DJI’s M30T.\n\nThere have been a few clear front-runners in the domestic space.\n\nThe best American (or domestically approved) drones are:\n\nFreefly Astro\n\nParrot Anafi Ai\n\nSkydio 2+\n\nSony Airpeak S1\n\nWingtra One\n\nBrinc Lemur 2\n\nAeroVironment Raven B\n\nHarris Aerial H6\n\nEasy Aerial Raptor\n\nInspired Flight IF800 Tomcat\n\nSkyhero Loki Mk II\n\nLet’s take a look at each of these drones and find out more about their features, capabilities, and limitations.\n\n1.
