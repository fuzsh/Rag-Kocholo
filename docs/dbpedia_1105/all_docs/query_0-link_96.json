        "text": "The article about main lines of russian feature film history: from 1898 to modern times. The history of Russian cinema goes back more than a century, it knew the stages of rise and fall, ideological repression and complete creative freedom. This controversial history was studied by both Russian and foreign scientists. Of course, Soviet and Western scientists studied Soviet cinema from different ideological positions. Soviet filmmakers were generally active in supporting socialist realism in cinema, while Western scholars, on the contrary, rejected this method and paid great attention to the Soviet film avant-garde of the 1920s. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the situation changed: russian and foreign film historians began to study cinema in a similar methodological manner, focusing on both ideological and socio-cultural aspects of the cinematographic process. Keywords: history, film, movie, cinema, USSR, Russia, film historians, film studies.\n\nThe main goal of the article is to study the features of film marketing and distribution of film products in Ukraine and to determine what kind of marketing tools are appropriate to be used within a cinema network to ensure their competitiveness in the national film distribution market.This article determines the characteristics of the movie market services and their compliance with modern consumer requirements, outlining the directions for increasing the usefulness of cinema-related services to consumers and developing a set of marketing tools to ensure the competitiveness of the cinema market.The results of the assessment of the impact of competitive forces revealed that intra-industry competition has the strongest impact on private cinema networks, the consumers of film distribution services and potential competitors have the moderate influence, the suppliers and substitute services have a low level of influence. According to the results of the survey, it can be concluded that ci...\n\nThe expansion of global air travel in the Cold War era fueled diverse forms of state-sponsored internationalism, including international writers’ congresses, concert tours, and especially art and film festivals. Film festivals served as a key stage for cultural competition between the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as the main way for decolonized Asian and African states to showcase their new national cinemas. The Soviet state airline, Aeroflot, shaped international participation at the Moscow International Film Festival (1959-) and Global South participation at the Tashkent Festival for Asian, African, and Latin American Cinema in Uzbekistan, USSR (1968-1988, included Latin America from 1976). As an infrastructure for cinematic internationalism, Aeroflot shaped “world cinema maps” that emerged at Moscow and Tashkent. For example, it delayed Tashkent festival’s expansion to Latin America, where the airline had few inroads. For local publics, films brought in airplane luggage at the last minute provided uncensored transnational cinematic experiences. Filmmakers from the Global South, whose travel was covered by their Soviet hosts, forged alliances at Moscow and Tashkent that often bypassed, contradicted, or exceeded Soviet diplomatic goals. More broadly, I argue that Soviet official internationalism—its technologies, bureaucracies, and expenditures—should be analyzed as an infrastructure that enabled multiple internationalist projects, some conceived elsewhere and working toward goals tangential or inimical to Soviet state purposes.\n\nThis article analyzes the Chinese post-Covid-19 cinema and compares it with the developments in North American Cinema. Coronavirus disease has significant detrimental effects on the worldwide film industry, and the annual box office of major film industries has seen a severe decline. This study presents the systematic review of the comparison of Chinese and North American Cinema during the year 2020. In this study, researchers have opted for the deductive approach on secondary source data with the keywords “Post Covid-19 Cinema”, “Chinese Film Culture Industry”, “Hollywood”, “Box Office”, and “Film Academy” on google search and consider all the significant sources in this systematic review. The Findings of the study reveal that China has already overtaken North America as the global most extensive box office crown for the first time, showing that in the post-COVID-19 era, the Chinese film industry is indeed among the first to get back on its feet.\n\nThe outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic in the early months of 2020 unleashed a domino effect that impacted a wide variety of sectors. Among others, the film industry registered critical detriments, with thousands of cinema theatres closed around the world and film productions, major releases and some of the most important events in the field, such as festivals and awards postponed, temporarily suspended or definitively cancelled. The aim of this thesis is to outline an extensive picture of the Covid-19 effects on the world of cinema, starting from the analysis of the pre-existing challenges that were affecting the business and that have been exacerbated by the health crisis, namely the impact of digital technologies on the film value chain, the enhancement of OTT and VOD platforms and the consequent “streaming war”, the constant need for original contents, the overload of franchises and sequels and the predominance of blockbusters at the expenses of small and mid-budget productions. The research will therefore focus on film festivals that, being the quintessential node of intersection between trade and artistic interests can be regarded as an ideal “microcosm” from which to develop a reflection on cinema and the processes in which it is involved. In this respect, the analysis of the 34th edition of Il Cinema Ritrovato was deemed an emblematic case study to investigate the extent in which the outbreak of the virus impacted the industry of cinema, providing interesting insights on the implementation and management of an unprecedented festival configuration involving the co-existence of live and digital events. The study will thus highlight the pivotal role played by the pandemic hiatus in accelerating a process of change in spaces, times and means of consumption, eventually giving the opportunity to re-think the way in which audiences and professional approach and define cinema."
