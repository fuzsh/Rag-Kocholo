        "text": "Tom Brady was selected No. 199 in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft. That pic in the bottom right-hand corner? That's what he looked like then. Talent evaluators didn't think very highly of Brady throughout the pre-draft process ‚Äî his unimpressive NFL Scouting Combine performance didn't help. Now? Well, he's the GOAT. The greatest quarterback of all time. From that first photo? He'd go on to win 251 regular-season games and 35 postseason games. He holds a .754 all-time winning percentage ‚Äî the highest among all quarterbacks who've started at least 100 games. Brady holds the NFL record for most passing yards (89,214) and passing touchdowns (649). During his recent Patriots Hall of Fame speech, he said: \"To be successful at anything, the truth is you don't have to be special. You have to be what most people aren't: consistent, determined, and willing to work for it. No shortcuts.\" I actually don't watch a lot of football. What I do pay attention to? Stories of potential being realized. No shortcuts. Social media makes it look like overnight success is at anyone's fingertips. Gurus make it sound like if you buy their formula, then you'll have the answer. I recently met with a mentor who was in the green room with Tim Ferriss before he blew up, and when Tim shared what he was going to talk about, my mentor said, \"Wait a minute ‚Äî you're not being truthful. You're conflating the story and moving parts around. You're making it seem like you didn't have to work your ass off to get where you did.\" And then, \"That's unethical.\" I'm in marketing. I know what kind of hype you can create. That's why I do everything I can to make our approach authentic. No shortcuts. Just talent. Learning. Growing. Doing.

Why? Because coaches, not even head coaches, are eligible for the MVP award (they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúplayers‚Äù, although they are critical, integral members of the team ‚Äî one could argue, the MOST important). So while Kansas City Chiefs‚Äô Head Coach Andy Reid & San Francisco 49ers‚Äô Kyle Shanahan aren‚Äôt in the running for MVP, guess what ‚Äî they don‚Äôt care. That‚Äôs not what they‚Äôre there for. They‚Äôre there for their teams. But invariably, while the players execute the plays, take the hit, risk the fumbles etc. on the field, the coach is responsible for the culture, enthusiasm, preparedness, chemistry & vision for the team & the Big Game. As coaches, we only win when our teams win. I echo this sentiment with the community I‚Äôve built around those I‚Äôve coached to be LinkedIn influencers at Coryconnects. I am currently onboarding 1 new client to work with 1:1 ‚Äî ideally an underdog (more fun when we win!). More on that in a moment & in the comments. But to get back to SBLVIII üèà it‚Äôs interesting that the Chiefs are tomorrow‚Äôs underdogs considering they beat the 49ers 4 years ago in the Super Bowl with the same coach & same quarterback, whereas the 49ers QB tomorrow is a rookie (in his first pro season), with their same coach who lost the contest 4 years ago. To understand why, we need not look any further than SF‚Äôs coach Kyle Shanahan, who‚Äôs considered one of the best offensive minds in the game. The adage goes ‚Äúdefense wins championship‚Äù, & Coach Andy Reid did defeat Shanahan heads up in the Super Bowl previously, with his same QB he‚Äôll play tomorrow, Patrick Mahomes. Rookie Brock Purdy, SF, has an amazing amount of confidence going in to the game tomorrow, largely due to his confidence in his coach & team. Like these two coaches facing off on the gridiron tomorrow, I also take huge pride in my coaching & the results my team of execs, authors, entrepreneurs & professionals get from their millions of monthly views of their optimized profiles & content. After all, whether offense or defense ‚Äî STRATEGY & experience win games! To learn more about my work & potentially work together see comments/leave comment, or shoot me a DM. Enjoy this video of every ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to Disney World‚Äù championship proclamation since 1987 via @fleaflickerrfootball IG. Please share your predictions or enthusiasm for tomorrow‚Äôs match up below if so inclined. Without my Bears in the mix I‚Äôm tuning in to see the athleticism, the commercials, Usher at half time, to chide friends who‚Äôre hardcore Niners or Chiefs fans, & just to be part of something bigger than myself, & tradition. Wishing all a great Super Bowl weekend filled with your own triumphs & jubilation. #superbowllviii #influencermarketing #growthhacking #visibility #coaching #linkedintrendingtopics #topvoices\n\nNew Post: Commanders new owner Josh Harris receives game ball after preseason win: ‚ÄòI love you guys‚Äô The Josh Harris era has begun for the Washington Commanders as their new owner saw his team‚Äôs first victory under his wing ‚Äì even if it was just a preseason matchup against the Cleveland Browns.

Now that the smoke has cleared from 'Super Wild Card Weekend' let's take a look inside & see what the damage is. According to ESPN Radio's Chris Canty of 'Unsportsmanlike' Nick Sirianni head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles & Mike McCarthy head coach of the Dallas Cowboys mine as well bring their cardboard box to work & start taking pictures off of the wall because they're as good as fired. Well, before their key cards get deactivated the owners & General Managers will step back from their devastating playoff loses & assess their teams & whether the issue is their coach or a combination of their coach & some of the schemes & a select group of players that should be replaced. In Dallas, the issue isn't just that the Cowboys (who has an unrealistic view of themselves in THIS century) can't seem to get over the playoff hump but firing their coach isn't going to solve their root problems. Their defensive personnel & possible defensive scheme, a roster that really isn't one of the top 5 in the league & a quarterback who counts towards $55 million dollars on the cap who seems to not be able to get through his progressions & hangs onto the ball too long even after 7+ seasons as their starter...they can't cut Dak & no one wants his salary. Or is their problem their owner Jerry Jones who insists on assuming the role of General Manager, maybe it's a combination of all of those issues but, Bill Belichick doesn't seem to be galloping in to save them anytime soon & is the 'The Patriots Way' still a thing. In Philly, Sirianni needs to be able to gut his staff, replace older players & look deeply at himself & the remaining staff & make the necessary adjustments & changes & let their top notch General Manager get the new players for them, he needs another season. So, we'll anticipate a better set of games coming up on the most competitive NFL weekend of the year the Divisional Playoffs this weekend. The new AP men's & women's college basketball polls are out & for the 1st time since '09 UConn has reached #1 in the men's poll & perennial 'Final 8' contender Gonzaga has dropped out of the top 25 for the 1st time since '15...is their a 'sea change' going on or is it just that we're in mid-January. On the women's side of college basketball Iowa is closing in on the Gamecocks of South Carolina who's been #1 all preseason & regular season so far, Colorado jumps into the #3 spot. Both tournaments will be worth watching this March. I can hear it, those trucks are gettin' ready to load up all of the equipment & stuff & head down to Arizona & Florida for the Spring Training ritual...it's almost here baseball lovers! Draymond Green returns to the Warriors who are not the same team & needs his passion to try to regain their edge...if it's not over. Joel Embiid returned to lay 41 points & 10 rebounds (boards) on the Rockets after being out since January 5th, remember 'Big Man' ball in the NBA & they're dominating the game again.\n\n#WhatHadHappenedWednesday - NFL Draft edition. Every time I tell someone I played in the NFL they ask, \"were you drafted?\" Yep! Seventh round - pick 251, one before Marcus Colston hahaha. My NFL draft story was a long, grueling, mentally exhausting, unbelievably frustrating 48 hours followed by hair raising, heart pumping, breath taking joy when my name was finally called. I had done everything Colorado State, scouts, coaches, trainers, and agents had told me to do and more, but in 2006 there were not a lot of roster spots for a WR like myself. (Now every team has a white slot WR, I guess I was just ahead of my time) That frustration was a daily and yearly reminder that the NFL was not and will never be a welcoming place for me. I was gong to have to find a way in and then figure out a way to stay. If it wasn't clear on draft day, the Texans made it clear before my second pro practice when I was told by a Texan scout, \"There are no roster spots for Dave Anderson in the NFL, you are going to have to earn one this year and every year.\" I thought we could change this. A couple years ago we at BreakAway Data thought we should take all the numbers these college athletes generate on the field and turn them into draft cards. Real game context that shows just how good these players are. (Maybe I would have been pick 151). Anything to help these athletes start one step closer to their dream. We worked with Jabril Cox, LSU, and his agents to pull together all of his data and extracting stories to highlight his skills and answer some perceived issues. We wanted to show that Jabril Cox was a new age LB. A LB that can play pass just as good as run. An amazing 6'4 231 athlete that can run with WRs, chase down RBs, and can line up in and outside the box. He was drafted in the 4th round and is still playing. Thats all you can ask for. These draft cards are still available for the colleges we work with but are still a work in progress as many agents would rather control the entire narrative instead of opening up a conversation about numbers they know little about. I get that, but there is nothing the numbers say that isn't already on the film. This perception is slowly changing though as more and more NFL teams are using in-game college GPS data to grade speed instead of 40 times. It will come around soon. Look out Mel Kiper! BreakAway Data #sportsdata #sportsanalytics #NFLdraft Note* After my rookie year, draft day is the worst day of the year. You are essentially watching your team tell you if they are going to replace you in real-time.\n\nThe Super Bowl was on Sunday but for the past two days I have watched the last 13 plays of the game winning drive for the Kansas City Chiefs to see if I could find something that would trigger me when it comes to business and marketing. The evidence was glaring and didn't take much to find but only if you are willing to repeat yourself over and over and over again. For example, in the 13 plays that the Chiefs ran to win the game their alignment was nearly identical for all of them. They had Patrick Mahomes in the shotgun and a RB to either his left or right. They never had 2 RBs or 0 RBs in the backfield. They presented themselves the same way every time. From that alignment, they did a few things that all businesses should do. They ran plays t hat would get them small chunks of yardage versus trying to get the TD on one big play. That doesn't mean that they didn't gamble. They did. Instead of trying to tie the game, they went for it on 4th and 1. The gamble paid off but then they went back to doing the same thing over and over and over again. Then when the game was on the line and they had next to no time left in the game what did they do? They went to a version of the two plays they ran in the previous Super Bowl that resulted in a TD. The result was the same this year. A game-winning TD. The lessons I learned were: ‚Ä¢ Don't be afraid to repeat your message over and over again. You never know when people are going to resonate with your message but if it is consistent you will have a better chance at success. ‚Ä¢ Do the small things on a consistent basis while taking a risk once in a while. Learn from the small things so that the risk is minimized. From that risk, figure out what worked or didn't work then apply it to the small things. ‚Ä¢ If you did something successful previously, why not do it again? Repeat that same 'play' until it stops working. The final lesson I learned was to not give up. The receiver on the end of the throw from Patrick Mahomes was Mecole Hardman who once played for the Chiefs but started the 2023-24 season with the Jets. He could not have imagined catching the game winning TD for the Chiefs when the season started. Did you watch the Super Bowl? What did you learn from the game that you can apply to your business or your job? #smallbusinessmarketing #marketingandadvertising #JasonBahamundi"
