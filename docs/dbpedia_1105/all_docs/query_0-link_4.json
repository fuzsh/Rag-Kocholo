        "text": "2021 film directed by Denis VilleneuveTemplate:SHORTDESC:2021 film directed by Denis Villeneuve\n\nFor the 1984 film, see Dune (1984 film).\n\nDune (titled onscreen as Dune: Part One)[5] is a 2021 American epic science fiction film directed by Denis Villeneuve with a screenplay by Jon Spaihts, Villeneuve, and Eric Roth. It is the first of a planned two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel of the same name by Frank Herbert, primarily covering the first half of the book. Set in the far future, it follows Paul Atreides, as he and his family, the noble House Atreides, are thrust into a war for the dangerous desert planet Arrakis, between the native Fremen people and the enemy invaders, the House Harkonnen. The film stars an ensemble cast including Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Zendaya, David Dastmalchian, Chang Chen, Sharon Duncan-Brewster, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa, and Javier Bardem.\n\nDune has been considered an \"unfilmable\" work due to its breadth and complexity of plots, and prior attempts, such as David Lynch's 1984 film, did not perform well with critics. Following a failed attempt by Paramount Pictures to produce a new adaptation of Herbert's novel, Legendary Entertainment acquired film and TV rights to the science fiction novel Dune in 2017. Development began shortly after, with Villeneuve expressing interest in the project and officially signing on as director in January 2017. He worked with Roth and Spaihts to write the screenplay, breaking it into two parts and incorporating an updated 21st century adaptation of the 1965 novel. Filming took place from March to July 2019 at various locations including areas in Budapest, Jordan, Norway, and Abu Dhabi.\n\nDune premiered at the 78th Venice International Film Festival on September 3, 2021. Warner Bros. Pictures theatrically released the film in 2D, 3D, and IMAX internationally on September 15, 2021, and a later release in the United States on October 22 and on HBO Max on October 21.[6] The film was generally well-received for its visuals, scope, and overall execution under Villeneuve’s direction. It has grossed $129.7 million worldwide against a production budget of $165 million.\n\nPlot[]\n\nSee also: Dune (novel) § Plot\n\nIn 10191, Duke Leto I of House Atreides, ruler of the ocean planet Caladan, is assigned by the Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV to serve as fief ruler of Arrakis, a harsh desert planet. Arrakis is the only source of melange, or \"spice\", a priceless substance that extends human vitality and is critical for interstellar travel. They are to replace the House Harkonnen, who have withdrawn from Arrakis on Shaddam's orders. In reality, Shaddam intends to use his Sardaukar troops to eradicate House Atreides and stage a coup to allow House Harkonnen to re-take the planet shortly after their arrival. Leto is apprehensive of the assignment, but sees it as an opportunity to bond with Arrakis’ native population, the Fremen, as a first step to bring peace throughout all the Houses.\n\nLeto's concubine Lady Jessica is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit, an exclusive sisterhood who wields advanced physical and mental abilities. Although Jessica was instructed to bear a daughter as part of the Gesserit’s breeding program to create the Kwisatz Haderach, a mythical superbeing, but for her love for Leto she bore a son, Paul. Throughout his life, Paul is trained by Leto's aides, Duncan Idaho, Gurney Halleck and the Mentat Thufir Hawat, while Jessica trains Paul in Bene Gesserit disciplines. Paul is troubled by visions of the future, a fact he only shares with Jessica and Duncan. Because of these visions, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam comes to Caladan and subjects Paul to the gom jabbar, a deadly test to assess its subject's humanity, which he passes. Afterwards, Mohiam instructs House patriarch Vladimir Harkonnen to spare Paul and Jessica during his coup, which he duplicitously agrees to.\n\nLeto, Jessica and Paul travel to Arrakeen, the stronghold on Arrakis formerly held by House Harkonnen, with Idaho and a scouting party having arrived in advance to learn and live among the Fremen. Leto negotiates with the Fremen's chieftain Stilgar and meets planetologist Dr. Liet-Kynes. Leto learns of the dangers involved in harvesting spice, particularly the giant sandworms that travel under the desert. During a flight with Paul, Halleck, and Liet-Kynes, they witness a sandworm attack an active harvester. Leto helps rescue its crew before the sandworm swallows it, during which Paul inhales the spice-laden air, causing his visions to intensify.\n\nAfter a failed attack on Paul's life by a Harkonnen agent, Leto places his soldiers on high alert while Paul suspects a traitor in House Atreides. This turns out to be Suk Doctor Wellington Yueh, who disables Arrakeen's protective shields and allows the Harkonnen army and disguised Sardaukar troops to overwhelm the Atreides forces. Yueh incapacitates Leto, as part of a deal to deliver him to the Baron to free his captured wife. Yueh replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule to kill the Baron, but is killed after delivering the Duke. Leto releases the poison gas, killing the Baron's court, but the Baron is able to evade it. Idaho steals an ornithopter, escaping the assault, but Paul and Jessica are captured; to be released into the desert to die. Using the \"voice\", Paul and Jessica overpower and kill their captors. Finding a survival kit left for them by Yueh, Paul and Jessica spend the night in a tent as Arrakeen burns.\n\nThe Baron hands over command of Arrakis to his brutish nephew Rabban and orders him to sell spice reserves and restart spice production to make up for the enormous expenses incurred during the coup. Paul and Jessica are found by Duncan and Liet-Kynes and head to an old research station, but are tracked down by Sardaukar shortly afterwards. Duncan and various Fremen sacrifice themselves to allow Jessica, Paul and Liet-Kynes to escape the facility. Liet-Kynes deliberately lures a sandworm to devour her and the Sarduakar troops. Paul and Jessica reach the deep desert and meet the Fremen, among them Stilgar and also Chani, the girl who apperaed in Paul's visions. Fremen tribe member Jamis protests against the admission of the two but is killed by Paul in a ritual duel to the death. Against Jessica's wishes, Paul insists on joining with the Fremen, in order to fulfill his father's goal of bringing peace to Arrakis.\n\nCast[]\n\nSee also: List of Dune characters\n\nProduction[]\n\nSee also: Dune (novel) § Adaptations, and Dune (franchise)\n\nBackground[]\n\nShortly after publication in 1965, Dune was identified for potential film prospects, and the rights to adapt the novel to film have been held by several producers since 1971. Multiple attempts to make such a film have been made, and it was considered to be \"unfilmable\", a difficult work to adapt to the screen owing to its breadth of content.[7][8][9] Further, because of the book's status among passionate fans, any deviations from the original material without strong justification have the potential to harm the film's reputation.[10]\n\nFilmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky had acquired the rights in the 1970s to make an extravagant fourteen-hour adaptation of the book, but the project fell apart. This effort to make the film was later the subject of the documentary film Jodorowsky's Dune released in 2013.[11] David Lynch's Dune, produced by Raffaella De Laurentiis in 1984, was intended to be a three-hour film, but was forced to be cut to 137 minutes for release, and as a result, the film was poorly received and considered a \"misfire\".[10][12][13] A live-action miniseries, Frank Herbert's Dune, aired on the Sci Fi Channel in 2000;[14] it did well in viewership, and was generally better received than Lynch's film. However, some reviewers criticized the miniseries for lacking the spectacle afforded to a feature film production, and for staying too faithful to the book and thus getting dragged down by exposition.[15] Prospects to make a successful adaption of Dune came after the critically-acclaimed adaptions of The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, both which maintained most of the works' key characters and plots while managing the limited running time.[10]\n\nIn 2008, Paramount Pictures were developing a new feature film adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune, with Peter Berg set to direct.[16] Berg left the project in October 2009,[17] with director Pierre Morel brought on to direct in January 2010,[18] before Paramount dropped the project in March 2011 as they could not come to key agreements with their rights expiring back to Rubinstein.[19]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nOn November 21, 2016, Legendary Entertainment acquired the film and TV rights for Dune.[20][21] In December 2016, Variety reported that director Denis Villeneuve was in talks with the studio to direct the film.[22] In September 2016, Villeneuve expressed his interest in the project, saying that \"a longstanding dream of mine is to adapt Dune, but it's a long process to get the rights, and I don't think I will succeed\".[23] Villeneuve said that he felt he was not ready to direct a Dune movie until he had completed projects like Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, and that with his background in science fiction films, \"Dune is my world.\"[24] By February 2017, Brian Herbert, son of Frank and author of later books in the Dune series, confirmed that Villeneuve would be directing the project.[25]\n\nSome of Villeneuve's previous collaborators on the films Arrival and/or Blade Runner 2049 returned for Dune, including film editor Joe Walker,[26] production designer Patrice Vermette, visual effects supervisor Paul Lambert, sound designer Theo Green is also the supervising sound editor together with Mark Mangini,[27] and special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer.[28] Other previous collaborators dropped out before production began, including visual effects supervisor John Nelson[29] and cinematographer Roger Deakins, who was replaced in December 2018 with Greig Fraser.[30] New collaborators included supervising art director Tom Brown and stunt coordinator Thomas Struthers.\n\nDune was produced by Villeneuve, Mary Parent, and Cale Boyter, with Tanya Lapointe, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, Kim Herbert, Thomas Tull, Jon Spaihts, Richard P. Rubinstein, John Harrison and Herbert W. Gain serving as executive producers and Kevin J. Anderson as creative consultant.[31][32] Game of Thrones language creator David Peterson was confirmed to be developing languages for the film in April 2019.[33]\n\nWriting[]\n\nIn March 2018, Villeneuve stated that his goal was to adapt the novel into a two-part film series.[34] Villeneuve ultimately secured a two-movie deal with Warner Bros. Pictures, in the same style as the two-part adaptation of Stephen King's It in 2017 and in 2019. He stated that \"I would not agree to make this adaptation of the book with one single movie\" as Dune was \"too complex\" with \"power in details\" that a single film would fail to capture.[35] However, all subsequent dealings were to secure the production of the first film and new production deals will need to be made to start production for the second film.[36]\n\nEric Roth was hired to co-write the screenplay in April,[37] and Jon Spaihts was later confirmed to be co-writing the script alongside Roth and Villeneuve.[38] Villeneuve said in May 2018 that the first draft of the script had been finished.[39][40] Brian Herbert confirmed by July 2018 that the latest draft of the screenplay covered \"approximately half of the novel Dune\".[41] Legendary CEO Joshua Grode confirmed in April 2019 that they plan to make a sequel, adding that \"there's a logical place to stop the [first] movie before the book is over\".[42] In November 2019, Spaihts stepped down as showrunner on the Dune: The Sisterhood TV prequel series to focus on the second film.[43]\n\nWhile Villeneuve had seen Lynch's adaptation of Dune and he respected both Lynch and the film, he did not build upon any elements from that, saying that \"I'm going back to the book, and going to the images that came out when I read it\" when he was a teenager.[44] Villeneuve said of when he had first seen Lynch's adaption that \"there are parts that I love and other elements that I am less comfortable with. So it's like, I remember being half-satisfied\", and that there was \"still a movie that needs to be made about that book, just a different sensibility\".[45] Further, Villeneuve did not wish to incorporate concepts that Jodorowsky had laid out for his attempt for a Dune film in the mid-1970s, as Villeneuve stated that \"Jodorowsky is a very unique visionary. He has a very strong, unique vision. I am a total different human being. It would be very presumptuous and arrogant for me to try.\"[46]\n\nIn adapting the book written in the 1960s for the 21st century, Villeneuve wanted to reflect on realities that have happened related to over-exploitation of the Earth and considered his screenplay \"a coming-of-age story, but also a call for action for the youth\".[35] Villeneuve looked to streamline many parts of the novel in adapting it for film, stating \"My goal was really to make sure that the hardcore fans will find the atmosphere and poetry of the book intact\".[47] Villeneuve avoided much of the internal monologues and epigraphs used in the book and which were considered a problem within Lynch's film adaption. Instead, he focused the story around Paul and Jessica, giving them a secret hand gesture language they could use to communicate silently to each other.[47] The film minimises many of the aspects around the Emperor and the politics surrounding the Empire, as Villeneuve believed he could still keep the sense of scope that the novel presented while still focusing the story around Paul's coming-of-age story. Other characters were given less predominance, such as Baron Harkkonnen and members of his court and the mentats Thufir Hawat and Piter De Vries, establishing them enough that they can be used within the potential second film.[47] Villeneuve also wanted to move the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen from being a caricature as he was presented in the novel to a more complex antagonist.[35]\n\nAnother major change included altering some of the arcs of the female characters in the book to give them more respect and predominance. Villeneuve stated \"Femininity is there in the book, but I thought it should be up front.\"[47] According to Rebecca Ferguson, who was cast as Lady Jessica, \"Denis was very respectful of Frank's work in the book, [but] the quality of the arcs for [many] of the women have been brought up to a new level. There were some shifts he did, and they are beautifully portrayed now.\"[35] Lady Jessica was given an expanded role as a soldier as well as being part of the Bene Gesserit. The studio labeled this role a \"warrior priestess\", in contrast to the joking label of \"space nun\" that Villeneuve felt the book gave across.[35] Dr. Liet Kynes, the ecologist on Arrakis who is male in the novel, was also given to a female lead Sharon Duncan-Brewster to help expand the cast diversity.[35]\n\nCasting[]\n\nIn July 2018, it was reported that Timothée Chalamet had entered final negotiations to play the lead in the film, Paul Atreides.[48] In September 2018, Rebecca Ferguson entered negotiations to join the film to play Atreides' mother, Lady Jessica.[38] She confirmed her casting in January 2019.[49]\n\nIn January 2019, Dave Bautista,[50] Stellan Skarsgård,[51] Charlotte Rampling,[52] Oscar Isaac,[53] and Zendaya joined the cast.[54] In February 2019, Javier Bardem,[55] Josh Brolin,[56] Jason Momoa,[57] and David Dastmalchian were cast.[58] Stephen McKinley Henderson joined in March,[32] with Chang Chen entering negotiations.[32][59]\n\nIn July 2019, TheMix.net reported that the film would \"gender swap\" the character Liet-Kynes by casting Sharon Duncan-Brewster in the role.[60] Duncan-Brewster's casting was confirmed in April 2020.[35] According to Duncan-Brewster, Villeneuve felt it was necessary to capture the essence of the character from the book, but was not necessary to remain consistent with all other facets, and thus opted for this change.[36]\n\nFilming[]\n\nPrincipal photography began on March 18, 2019, at the Origo Film Studios in Budapest, Hungary,[26][32][61] and also took place in Wadi Rum in Jordan.[32][62][63] The planet Caladan, one of the settings of the film, was filmed in Stadlandet in Norway.[64] The movie was also filmed in Liwa Oasis in the United Arab Emirates, which formed a key backdrop of the planet Arrakis.[65][66] Primary filming was completed in July 2019.[67][68] Additional filming took place in Budapest in August 2020 but was not expected to alter the release date of the film.[69][70] The film was shot for the IMAX format with an IMAX-certified Arri Alexa LF camera and an IMAX-certified Alexa Mini LF prototype, equipped with Panavision's large-format lenses in the Ultra Vista and H-series lineup, with select scenes seeing the aspect ratio opened up to 1.90:1 on all IMAX screens, and to 1.43:1 on select IMAX screens outfitted with IMAX's dual-laser projection system.[71][72] Brian Herbert confirmed filming wrapped on July 26, 2019.[73]\n\nMusic[]\n\nMain article: Music of Dune (2021 film)\n\nHans Zimmer affirmed he would be scoring Dune near the start of the film's production in March 2019.[32] Zimmer had previously worked with Villeneuve on Blade Runner 2049. At the time, Zimmer had been approached by Christopher Nolan for composing on his then-upcoming film Tenet, but Zimmer opted for DuneTemplate:Mdashciting his personal love for the book as the reason.[74]\n\nFor the first Dune trailer, Zimmer supervised a 32-person choir via FaceTime (necessitated by COVID-19 pandemic restrictions) for the recording of a cover of Pink Floyd's song \"Eclipse\". Choir members gathered in groups of four over eight separate sessions in Santa Monica at Zimmer's Remote Control studio while Zimmer conducted from home.[75]\n\nThree soundtrack albums will be released for the film, including The Dune Sketchbook (Music from the Soundtrack), Dune (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), and The Art and Soul of Dune on September 3, September 17, and October 22, 2021, respectively. Villeneuve said Zimmer spent \"months and months creating new instruments, defining, creating, and seeking new sounds, pushing the envelope\" and praised his work on the film. Two singles were released on July 22, titled \"Paul's Dream\" and \"Ripples in the Sand\".[76]\n\nMarketing[]\n\nPromotion[]\n\nVanity Fair published an extensive first-look report on Dune on April 13, 2020.[35] Empire's October 2020 issue's cover story included an in-depth look at the film and interviews with cast and crew, providing additional first looks ahead of the film's trailer release.[77] The first 10 minutes of the film were screened in select IMAX theaters worldwide on July 21 and 22, 2021, in an event that also included a behind-the-scenes look at the film, and the debut of the film's first full trailer.[78][79]\n\nA teaser trailer was released on September 9, 2020. IndieWire gave the trailer a positive review, and wrote \"It's full of eye-popping set design, breathtaking action, and one jaw-dropping last-minute look at Frank Herbert's infamous sandworms\", in addition to stating, \"The two [Denis Villeneuve and Greig Fraser] have brought a tangibility to Frank Herbert's world that should make Dune a visceral experience for moviegoers.\"[80] The theatrical trailer for the film was released on July 22, 2021. Wired stated that the trailer \"is begging you to see it in theaters\".[81] Variety praised the cast and visuals.[82] Vanity Fair also gave the trailer a positive review and stated, \"It will seem more mysterious to those unfamiliar with the story, but like Chani does herself in those dream missives to Paul, it hints at big, impressive things to come.\"[83]\n\nMerchandising[]\n\nOn February 26, 2019, Funcom entered into an exclusive partnership with Legendary Entertainment to develop games related to the upcoming Dune films.[84]\n\nOther Dune franchise works, unrelated to the film, are planned to be released near the same time as the film. The original Dune board game, produced by Avalon Hill in 1979 but out of print for many years, has been republished by Gale Force Nine to tie in with the film, along with the development of new board games based on the Dune franchise.[85] A three-part graphic novel adaption of the books is being written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson with illustrations by Raúl Allén and Patricia Martín, with plans to be published by Abrams Books starting in October 2020 to tie into the film's release.[86] In May 2020, Boom! Studios acquired the comic and graphic novel rights to the 1999 prequel novel Dune: House Atreides, with the intent of doing a 12-issue comic adaptation written by the original authors Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.[87] In March 2020, Modiphius Entertainment helmed a new role-playing game based on the franchise, Dune: Adventures in the Imperium.[88]\n\nA new board game, Dune Imperium, was released by Dire Wolf Digital in December 2020.[89] The game blends deck building and worker placement for up to four players. The game also features an automated opponent that can be used for solo play or in games of fewer than four players.\n\nIn September 2020, McFarlane Toys started a line of 7-inch figures modeled after characters from the film.[90] A 12-inch figure of Baron Harkonnen was introduced at the same time.[90] As of September 2020, the line was slated for release later in 2020.[90]\n\nAn artbook, The Art and Soul of Dune, is set to be released alongside the film on October 22, 2021. The book will be written by the film's executive producer Tanya Lapointe, and will include a soundtrack album of the same name composed by Zimmer. The book will be available in both a standard and a limited edition.[91]\n\nRelease[]\n\nDune was originally scheduled to be released on November 20, 2020, but was pushed back to December 18, 2020.[31][93] The film was then delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this time to October 1, 2021, taking over the release date slot of The Batman, where it will be theatrically released in 3D. In late June 2021, Warner Bros. delayed the film's American release date again by three weeks to October 22, 2021, to avoid competition with No Time to Die.[6] Over a month before the domestic North American release date, the film had a staggered theatrical release schedule in most international markets that do not have HBO Max, beginning on September 15, including France, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland.[96] A week ahead of the United States release, HBO and Warner Bros. announced that the film's availability on HBO Max will start on the evening of October 21, 2021, correlating with typical early Thursday theatrical showings for films released on Fridays.[97]\n\nLike all 2021 Warner Bros. films, Dune will be streamed simultaneously on HBO Max for a period of one month.[98] The film will then be removed from the service and follow the normal home media release schedule,[98] similar to the process Warner Bros. used for Wonder Woman 1984.[99] Villeneuve was one of several directors, alongside movie theater chains and production companies (including Legendary Entertainment, which produced and financed the film), who expressed disappointment and displeasure over the move.[100] In a column published in Variety, he wrote, \"Streaming can produce great content, but not movies of Dune's scope and scale. Warner Bros.' decision means Dune won't have the chance to perform financially in order to be viable and piracy will ultimately triumph... My team and I devoted more than three years of our lives to make it a unique big screen experience. Our movie's image and sound were meticulously designed to be seen in theaters.\"[101] At the end of his appearance on Saturday Night Live that same month, Chalamet wore a hoodie with the Legendary Pictures logo on it, which was interpreted in the media as support for Legendary and disapproval of the streaming deal.[102]\n\nDune had its world premiere on September 3, 2021, at the 78th Venice International Film Festival.[103][104] It also screened at the 2021 Toronto International Film Festival, with an IMAX premiere screening at the Cinesphere.[105] On October 17, the film was leaked online ahead of its planned United States and HBO Max release.[106][107][108]\n\nReception[]\n\nBox office[]\n\nAs of October 17, 2021 , Dune has grossed $129.7 million worldwide.[3] Deadline Hollywood reported that a total box office gross of $300 million \"will make many happy from an image-standpoint, even if breakeven is far north of that.\"[109]\n\nThe film was released in 14 markets outside the United States on September 15, 2021. It grossed $37.9 million, with the largest markets being Russia ($8.9 million),[110] France ($7.2 million), Germany ($4.4 million),Taiwan($3.4 million), Italy ($2.5 million) and Spain ($2.4 million).[111] After adding an additional $26.3 million from 32 countries in its second weekend, the film had a 10-day running total of $76.5 million.[112]\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Ron's Gone Wrong, and is projected to gross $30–35 million from 4,125 theaters in its opening weekend.[109] It made $5.1 million from Thursday night previews.[113]\n\nCritical response[]\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 83% approval rating based on 290 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Dune occasionally struggles with its unwieldy source material, but those issues are largely overshadowed by the scope and ambition of this visually thrilling adaptation.\"[114] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100 based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[115] Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an average 4 out of 5 stars.[113]\n\nFollowing its premiere at the Venice Film Festival, reception was generally positive but did not resonate with some critics.[116][117] Summarizing early reviews, Stephen M. Colbert of Screen Rant noted that its complex story and Villeneuve's directorial style were bound to have selective appeal, and that this is reflected in negative reviews thus far.[118] The film has been praised for its scope and ambition.[116][117]\n\nBen Travis of Empire magazine gave the film five out of five stars and stated, \"An absorbing, awe-inspiringly huge adaptation of (half of) Frank Herbert's novel that will wow existing acolytes, and get newcomers hooked on its Spice-fuelled visions. If Part Two never happens, it'll be a travesty.\"[119] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph also gave the film a five-star rating, calling it \"majestic, unsettling and enveloping\".[120] Xan Brooks of The Guardian referred to the film in his five-star review as \"dense, moody and quite often sublime – the missing link bridging the multiplex and the arthouse\".[121] In a positive review, Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \"Villeneuve draws you into an astonishingly vivid, sometimes plausibly unnerving vision of the future.\"[122] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly, who graded the film a B, wrote that Dune \"is exactly the kind of lush, lofty filmmaking wide screens were made for; a sensory experience so opulent and overwhelming it begs to be seen big, or not at all\" and added, \"The sheer awesomeness of Villeneuve's execution ... often obscures the fact that the plot is mostly prologue: a sprawling origin story with no fixed beginning or end.\"[123]\n\nOther critics commented on issues related to pacing and handling of the source material.[116][117] Critic Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: \"It's an act of world-building that runs out of storytelling steam ... Dune is out to wow us, and sometimes succeeds, but it also wants to get under your skin like a hypnotically toxic mosquito ... as the movie begins to run out of tricks, it turns woozy and amorphous.\"[124] Kevin Maher of The Times gave two out of five stars, stating that while \"every frame ... is spectacular\", \"Dune is also kind of boring\".[125] Reviewing the film for TheWrap, Steve Pond called the film \"both dazzling and frustrating, often spectacular and often slow\" and said, \"This version of Dune sometimes feels as if it aims to impress you more than entertain you; it's grim on a staggering level, ditching most of the fun of sci-fi yarns in favor of a worldview that feels more like Villeneuve's Sicario or Prisoners than his Arrival.\"[126]\n\nFuture[]\n\nPossible sequels[]\n\nAlthough the sequel has not yet been officially green-lit by Legendary, Villeneuve has stated that the 2021 film will roughly cover the first half of the novel, with a follow-up covering the remaining half.[127] He explained, \"I would not agree to make this adaptation of the book with one single movie\", says Villeneuve. \"The world is too complex. It's a world that takes its power in details.\"[127] In November 2019, Jon Spaihts left his position as showrunner of the Dune: The Sisterhood prequel TV series to focus more on writing the sequel film.[43] In June 2020, cinematographer Greig Fraser said, \"It's a fully formed story in itself with places to go. It's a fully standalone epic film that people will get a lot out of when they see it\".[128] However, in December 2020, Villeneuve stated that Warner Bros.' plan to simultaneously release the film in theaters and on HBO Max could result in the film's underperforming financially, which could lead to cancellation of the planned sequel.[101]\n\nIn February 2021, Eric Roth stated that he has written a full treatment for the potential sequel.[129] In an IMAX screening of the film's first ten minutes, the title read as Dune: Part One, lending credence to plans for further parts.[5] In August 2021, Villeneuve was optimistic about the sequel happening,[130] and confirmed that Chani will have a bigger role in it.[131] That same month, he also confirmed writing on the sequel had begun.[132] Villeneuve said at the Venice Film Festival before the film's debut that he is planning a trilogy, with two films being based on the first novel and the third film being based on Dune Messiah.[133] Warner Bros. assured Villeneuve a sequel will be greenlit as long as the film performs well on HBO Max.[134] Just days prior to the film's release, Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff stated, \"Will we have a sequel to Dune? If you watch the movie you see how it ends. I think you pretty much know the answer to that.\"[135]\n\nDune: The Sisterhood[]\n\n“Dune: The Sisterhood” redirects here. For the 2012 novel, see Sisterhood of Dune.\n\nAs revealed in June 2019, Legendary Television is also producing a spin-off television series, Dune: The Sisterhood, for WarnerMedia's streaming service, HBO Max. The series will focus on the Bene Gesserit and serve as a prequel to the film. Villeneuve will direct the series' pilot, with Spaihts writing the screenplay and Dana Calvo as showrunner for the series.[136][137] Villeneuve and Spaihts will also serve as executive producers alongside Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt, and Kim Herbert.[138] However, in November 2019, Spaihts left the series as writer to focus on the sequel film, though will remain on as an executive producer.[43] Diane Ademu-John was hired as the new showrunner by July 2021.[139]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nScript error: No such module \"Side box\".\n\nOfficial website\n\nDune at IMDb\n\nTemplate:Dune franchise Template:Frank Herbert\n\nFilms directed by Denis Villeneuve Cosmos (1996) • August 32nd on Earth (1998) • Maelström (2000) • Next Floor (2008) • Polytechnique (2009) • Incendies (2010) • Prisoners (2013) • Enemy (2013) • Sicario (2015) • Arrival (2016) • Blade Runner 2049 (2017) • Dune (2020)"
