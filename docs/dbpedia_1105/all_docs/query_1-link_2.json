        "text": "Title: Hardcore Henry\n\nRating: R\n\nDirected by: Ilya Naishuller\n\nWritten by: Ilya Naishuller and Will Stewart\n\nStarring: Sharlto Copley, Tim Roth, Haley Bennett and Danila Kozlovsky\n\nRelease Date: 4/8/2016\n\nRunning Time: 96 minutes\n\nOfficial Site\n\nIMDb\n\nStrap in. Hardcore Henry is one of the most unflinchingly original wild-rides to hit the big screen in a long time: You remember nothing. Mainly because you’ve just been brought back from the dead by your wife (Haley Bennett). She tells you that your name is Henry. Five minutes later, you are being shot at, your wife has been kidnapped, and you should probably go get her back. Who’s got her? His name’s Akan (Danila Kozlovsky); he’s a powerful warlord with an army of mercenaries, and a plan for world domination. You’re also in an unfamiliar city of Moscow, and everyone wants you dead. Everyone except for a mysterious British fellow called Jimmy (Sharlto Copley). He may be on your side, but you aren’t sure. If you can survive the insanity, and solve the mystery, you might just discover your purpose and the truth behind your identity. Good luck, Henry. You’re likely going to need it…\n\nWhat did you think of this film?\n\nDuring Credits? No\n\nAfter Credits? No\n\nNote: There is a brief audio cue from Jimmy midway through the credits as a bridge between songs (a phone message from Jimmy to Henry: “Hi Henry, if you’re hearing this there’s one more thing I need you to do.”).\n\nDedication: Dedicated to the Loving Memory of Tatiana Rusakova"
