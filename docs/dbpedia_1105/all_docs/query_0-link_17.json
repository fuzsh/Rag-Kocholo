        "text": "Sony Alpha A7S Mark II Features\n\nAt the \"core\" of the Sony Alpha A7S Mark II is the same full-frame 12 megapixel CMOS sensor from the A7S, which offers an extended ISO range of ISO50 up to ISO409,600 (Native ISO100 to ISO102,400).\n\n4K video recording has been updated, and it is now possible to record internally to the SD card - the original A7S required the use of an external recorder connected to the HDMI port for 4K video recording.\n\nSony Alpha A7S Mark II Updates over the A7S:\n\n14-bit uncompressed RAW format (improved over 12bit compressed) – 24MB file instead of 12MB.\n\nTough magnesium alloy body\n\nReduced vibration shutter, 500,000 cycles\n\nUpdated EVF, 0.78x magnification (A7S was 0.71x), Zeiss T* coating\n\nUpdated 3inch screen, 1.228m dots (A7S was 921k dots)\n\nEnhanced grip and shutter button\n\nUpdated controls to match other Mark II cameras\n\nEasy button customisation\n\nPower supply via USB – use the camera, powered from USB (PC or mobile battery)\n\nMore precise white balance adjustment\n\nBright monitoring\n\nISO auto minimum shutter speed\n\nSony Alpha A7s Video Comparison - 4K\n\nVideo Features:\n\nFull frame 4K internal recording with full pixel readout without pixel binning\n\n5-axis image stabilisation, 4.5 steps compensation, works with any lens (including legacy)\n\n120fps HFR (High Frame Rate) video recording (at FullHD), up to 5x/4x slow motion\n\nGamma Display assist\n\nWide dynamic range, 14stops, (1300% - plus 3.6 steps above 100%)\n\nS-Gamut3.Cine / S-Log3 (for Cinema) and S-Gamut3 / S-Log3 (BT2020) profiles\n\nEnhanced Zebra display\n\nAuto Focus has been updated, with 169 AF points (vs 25 points on the A7S), and the camera can focus down to -4 EV. There is also twice as fast AF in movie recording. Designed for low light and wide dynamic range, the camera records 4K video internally using XAVC S format, other updates in video include the ability to record 120fps (100MBps).\n\nHere we compare the A7S vs A7S II vs A7R II as all cameras can record 4K video:\n\nA7S A7S II A7R II 12mp 12mp 42mp 25 focus points 169 focus points 399 focus points - 5-axis IS 5-axis IS 4K Full-frame\n\n- without binning 4K Full-frame\n\n- without binning 4K Full-frame 4K external only 4K internal / external 4K internal / external - - 4K Super 35\n\n- without binning 1080p Full-frame\n\n- without binning 1080p Full-frame\n\n- without binning 1080p Full-frame 1080p Super 35mm\n\n- without binning 1080p Super 35mm\n\n- without binning 1080p Super 35mm\n\nSony has provided this presentation slide to show the differences between the camera models, as well as graphically show the sensor area that the camera uses when recording in the different modes.\n\nSony A7s Video Comparison - FullHD\n\nVideo in detail: 4K resolution (3840x2160, UHD), 30p, 25p, 24p, 100MBps XAVC S internal recording – requires an SDXC card with UHS I – U:3 rating. 4K recording is a full pixel readout without pixel binning and uses the full-frame of the sensor. There is also clean HDMI output for 4K and FullHD. Video options include various profile options to deliver wider dynamic range and improved colour correction.\n\nSensor based 5-axis image stabilisation can be used in both video and stills modes, making steady video recording possible whilst hand-holding the camera, as well as giving stabilisation for low-light photography, with 4.5 stops compensation.\n\nWhen using E mount and A mount lenses with OSS (Optical Steady Shot) image stabilisation the camera will compensate for 3 directions, with 2 compensated with the lens. When using a standard lens without OSS, the sensor will be using for image stabilisation, using the 5-axis sensor stabilisation system.\n\nWi-Fi and NFC connectivity is built in, as per the original A7s. This lets you connect the camera to a compatible Android or iOS device, as well as use Sony PlayMemories apps to add additional features to the camera, using either free apps or paid apps.\n\nSony Alpha A7S Mark II Handling\n\nLike the A7 Mark II and A7R Mark II, the Sony Alpha A7S Mark II shares the same body design and build quality, with a well built magnesium alloy body, and a large front grip with ample rubber covering that extends round to the back for your thumb. On the side is the memory card slot that takes SD memory card or Sony Memory Sticks.\n\nThere is a top mode dial with a central button to unlock the dial. Next to this are two customisable buttons (C1 and C2), and an exposure compensation dial giving quick access to exposure compensation should you need it. There are front and rear control dials so that you can quickly and easily change the shutter and aperture values when in A/S/M modes. There is a third customisable button (C3) on the back near the electronic viewfinder.\n\nThe Fn (Function) button on the back of the camera brings up the quick menu, and this can be customised so that you have quick access to your favourite settings. Above this is the AF/MF button with a switch that turns this into the AEL button. The video record button is found on the corner of the camera. The four-way controller on the back of the camera is also a scroll wheel which makes it quicker to change settings, as you don't have to move your thumb or finger to another dial.\n\nThe A7S Mark II has an updated number of focus points, with 169 contrast detection focus points covering a wide area of the sensor, and the camera can focus down to -4 EV, although in very low light conditions we found the camera occasionally struggled to focus correctly, whereas a full-frame Digital SLR managed to focus much more successfully.\n\nThe electronic viewfinder (EVF) has a high resolution of 2,359K dots, giving 100% coverage, and 0.78x magnification. This makes the viewfinder large and bright, as well as very clear, with good colour. There's a good size rubber surround, which is good for those that wear glasses, and there's also dioptre adjustment on the side. The screen tilts up and down, and has a good resolution of 1,228K dots, with good colour and viewing angle.\n\nMenus – The Sony menu system is clearly laid out and easy to use, and is standardized across all Sony cameras. There are a large number of options, which could make reference to the manual useful, and this does make finding some options quite time consuming if you are not familiar with the layout.\n\nThe Fn (function) button doubles as a Wi-Fi button letting you connect to a smartphone over Wi-Fi or NFC if your smartphone features it. You can add additional features to the camera using Sony PlayMemories apps, with apps available for free or alternatively for a fee.\n\nBattery life - Battery life is rated at 310 shots according to Sony / CIPA test results, which is average for a mirrorless class of camera - therefore we would recommend a spare battery if you plan on shooting more, or you could invest in the optional battery grip. A nice feature of the A7S Mark II is the ability to charge the camera using a MicroUSB cable, as well as the ability to use the camera while powering the camera this way.\n\nSony Alpha A7S Mark II Performance\n\nThe performance section is where we look at the image quality performance of the camera. Additional sample photos and product shots are available in the Equipment Database, where you can add your own review, photos and product ratings.\n\nSpeed - We took a number of shots to test the camera's responsiveness, from switch on to first photo, shot to shot, focusing speed etc. We take a number of shots and then use the average to ensure accurate and consistent tests, making it easy to compare with other cameras.\n\nFocus was reasonably quick, depending on which lens was used with the camera, but not as quick as other mirrorless cameras. Continuous shooting is reasonably quick, at 5fps.\n\nSony Alpha 7S II Sample Photos\n\nSample Photos - The Sony Alpha A7S Mark II can shoot in extremely low light conditions, providing results that can be shared on-line, even up to ISO102400. Colours are good, and with a full-frame sensor you can get pleasantly blurred backgrounds with excellent subject separation. With image stabilisation built in to the camera you can also handhold the camera and take sharp shots at much slower shutter speeds than would normally be possible.\n\nSony Alpha 7S II Lens test images\n\nLens Performance - There is an increasing range of lenses available, with three new lenses announced recently, and this gives you a good range of options, although the lenses are often quite large in order to cover the full-frame sensor of the camera. The prime lenses available give excellent image quality and detail, with pleasing bokeh (background blur). The camera has built in lens correction, to automatically correct for Peripheral Shading, Chromatic Aberration, and Distortion, and we were impressed with the results straight from the camera.\n\nSony Alpha 7S II ISO test images\n\nISO Noise Performance - Noise is very well controlled from the lower ISO settings, and impressively detail can be found in images up to ISO25600, and then detail drops at ISO51200, as noise increases and colour saturation is reduced. ISO102400 could still produce usable images, particularly if using them on the web, however the higher ISO settings of 204800 and 409600 are probably best avoided. There are noise reduction options of Off, Low and Normal, with Normal being the default setting.\n\nSony Alpha 7S II White-balance test images\n\nWhite Balance Performance - Auto White Balance (AWB) performs very well under tungsten lighting with a slightly warm result, with the tungsten preset giving a more accurate or more neutral result. AWB performs very well under fluorescent lights, with the fluorescent preset giving a very slight colour cast.\n\nSony Alpha 7S II Other sample images\n\nSony Alpha 7S II Digital filters\n\nDigital Filters - There are a number of customisable picture effects which are preset colour modes, where you can alter contrast, saturation and sharpness. There are also a large number of creative effects, that let you apply digital filters to images including Toy camera, miniature and selective colour to name a few.\n\nVideo - The video recording features of the A7S Mark II have been updated, with the most noticeably and most welcome update being the ability to record 4K video directly to an internal memory card. Add in the 5-axis image stabilisation that works with any lens, and you have an excellent camera system that can be used hand-held to produce steady video. Here is a quick run-down of the video features:\n\nFull frame 4K internal recording (XAVC S) with full pixel readout without pixel binning, 30p, 25p, 24p\n\n5-axis image stabilisation, 4.5 steps compensation, works with any lens (including legacy)\n\n120fps HFR (High Frame Rate, 100MBps) video recording (at FullHD), up to 5x/4x slow motion\n\nGamma Display assist, Black Gamma, Knee\n\nWide dynamic range, 14stops, (1300% - plus 3.6 steps above 100%)\n\nS-Gamut3.Cine/S-Log3 (for Cinema) and S-Gamut3/S-Log3 (BT2020) profiles\n\nEnhanced Zebra display\n\nDolby Digital Stereo"
