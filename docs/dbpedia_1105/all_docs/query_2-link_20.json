        "text": "Superhero movies have always been popular. From Christopher Reeve’s first outing as Superman in 1978, there’s always been some sort of comic book adaptation in the works. For decades, the biggest superheroes on our big screens were Batman and Superman. But that all changed in 2008 when Robert Downey Jr donned his armour for the first time. Since then, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (affectionately referred to as the MCU) has become the biggest movie franchise of all time. Spanning 33 films (at the time of writing) and over a decade of hype and action, Marvel movies have earned over $29 billion dollars around the world.\n\nWhere to watch Marvel movies\n\nThe interconnected nature of the MCU makes watching and re-watching all the movies part of the fun, and Disney Plus has all the MCU films (including at least one of the three Tom Holland Spider-Man films) available to stream on the same platform. But the big question is, which order do you watch them in?\n\nDo you prefer to watch all the films as they were originally released, starting with Iron Man and finishing with The Marvels? Do you want to watch the events as they would have happened and prefer the Marvel chronological order? Do you watch all the Marvel movies, or just watch the best ones and get to Endgame as quickly as possible?\n\nYou don’t have to decide right now. Check out our guide on how to watch Marvel movies in order to see which you like best.\n\nHow to watch the Marvel movies in chronological order\n\nThere’s a fair amount of time-jumping in the MCU, with some films set in the past, some in the future, and some jumping around between both. In fact, it’s pretty much the basis for the entire plot of Endgame. After having watched all the films at least once, some fans prefer to watch the Marvel films in chronological order, starting with Captain America: The First Avenger and ending with the latest MCU release, which at the moment is Thor: Love and Thunder.\n\nWatching the MCU films in chronological order is a fun way to see all the callbacks, Easter eggs and foreshadowing you may have missed the first time you watched the films. For example, Nick Fury calling in Captain Marvel after the events of Infinity War has added impact when you’ve already watched them meet in the Captain Marvel solo film.\n\nThis isn’t 100% accurate, thanks to Marvel’s famous mid- and post-credits causing some overlap, specifically in Captain Marvel, Black Widow, and Ant-Man and The Wasp. Not to mention the flashbacks in Eternals taking place a few thousand years ago. But for the most part, here’s how to watch all the MCU films in Marvel chronological order:\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger (1942)\n\nCaptain Marvel (1995) - but don't watch the post-credits scene until you've watched Infinity War... #spoilers.\n\nIron Man (2008)\n\nIron Man 2 (2011)\n\nThe Incredible Hulk (2011)\n\nThor (2011) - six months before Avengers\n\nThe Avengers (2012)\n\nIron Man 3 (2012) - six months after The Avengers\n\nThor: The Dark World (2013) - after Avengers but before Ultron\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) - after Avengers but before Ultron\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy (2014)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy 2 (2014)\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (2015)\n\nAnt-Man (2015)\n\nCaptain America: Civil War (2016) - after Ultron and before Infinity War\n\nBlack Widow (2016, excluding post-credits scene) - right after Civil War\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (2016) - after Civil War and before Infinity War\n\nDoctor Strange (2016-2017)\n\nBlack Panther (2017)\n\nThor: Ragnarok (2017) - after Ultron and before Infinity War\n\nAvengers: Infinity War (2017)\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp (2017) - takes place at the same time as Infinity War since the post-credit scene takes place during the snap.\n\nAvengers: Endgame (2017-2022)\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2023)\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home (2023)\n\nEternals (2023, excluding flashbacks)\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home (2024)\n\nDr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2025)\n\nThor: Love and Thunder (2025)\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever (2025)\n\nAnt-Man: Quantumania (2025)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy: Vol 3 (2025)\n\nThe Marvels (2025)\n\nMarvel Timeline infographic - MCU chronological order\n\nHow to watch Marvel TV shows in the MCU timeline\n\nIf you want to go one step further, you could integrate the Disney Plus Marvel TV shows in your next rewatch. While WandaVision was released first, Loki begins during the events of Endgame, which themselves take place in 2012. So here’s how to watch the MCU movies and TV shows in chronological order:\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger (1942)\n\nCaptain Marvel (1995)\n\nIron Man (2008)\n\nIron Man 2 (2011)\n\nThe Incredible Hulk (2011)\n\nThor (2011) - six months before The Avengers\n\nThe Avengers (2012)\n\nLoki – begins after The Avengers in 2012, but is still best watched after Endgame.\n\nIron Man 3 (2012) - six months after The Avengers\n\nThor: The Dark World (2013) - after Avengers but before Ultron\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) - after Avengers but before Ultron\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy (2014)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy 2 (2014)\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (2015)\n\nAnt-Man (2015)\n\nCaptain America: Civil War (2016) - after Ultron and before Infinity War\n\nBlack Widow (2016, excluding post-credits scene) - right after Civil War\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (2016) - after Civil War and before Infinity War\n\nDoctor Strange (2016-2017)\n\nBlack Panther (2017)\n\nThor: Ragnarok (2017) - after Ultron, and before Infinity War\n\nAvengers: Infinity War (2017)\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp (2017) - takes place at the same time as Infinity War since the post-credit scene takes place during the snap.\n\nAvengers: Endgame (2017-2022)\n\nWandaVision (2022) – three weeks after Endgame\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2023) – six months after Avengers: Endgame\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home (2023) – eight months after Endgame\n\nWhat If...? (xxxx) – as this spans the entire multiverse, there’s no set date, but it's best watched after Endgame.\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2023)\n\nEternals (2023) - excluding flashbacks over almost 7,000 years ago\n\nHawkeye (2023)\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home (2024)\n\nMoon Knight (2025)\n\nDr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2025)\n\nMs Marvel (2025)\n\nThor: Love and Thunder (2025)\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever (2025)\n\nShe-Hulk (2025)\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2025)\n\nSecret Invasion (2025)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy: Vol 3 (2025)\n\nThe Marvels (2025)\n\nHow to watch Marvel movies in order of release\n\nLike me, you might prefer to watch the Marvel movies in the order in which they were intended – that is, the order they were originally released in. This is how to watch the Marvel movies in release date order:\n\nMCU Phase 1\n\nIron Man (2008)\n\nThe Incredible Hulk (2008)\n\nIron Man 2 (2010)\n\nThor (2011)\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger (2011)\n\nThe Avengers (2012)\n\nMCU Phase 2\n\nIron Man 3 (2013)\n\nThor: The Dark World (2013)\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy (2014)\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (2015)\n\nAnt-Man (2015)\n\nMCU Phase 3\n\nCaptain America: Civil War (2016)\n\nDoctor Strange (2016)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017)\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (2017)\n\nThor: Ragnarok (2017)\n\nBlack Panther (2018)\n\nAvengers: Infinity War (2018)\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp (2018)\n\nCaptain Marvel (2019)\n\nAvengers: Endgame (2019)\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home (2019)\n\nMCU Phase 4\n\nWandaVision (2021)\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier (2021)\n\nLoki (2021)\n\nBlack Widow (2021)\n\nWhat If...? (2021)\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)\n\nEternals (2021)\n\nHawkeye (2021)\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home (2021)\n\nMoon Knight (2022)\n\nDoctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (2022)\n\nMs. Marvel (2022)\n\nThor: Love And Thunder (2022)\n\nShe-Hulk - Disney Plus show (2022)\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever (November 11, 2022)\n\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (December 2022)\n\nMCU Phase 5\n\nAnt-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania (Feb 17, 2023)\n\nGuardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (May 5, 2023)\n\nSecret Invasion (June 21, 2023)\n\nThe Marvels (November 10th, 2023)\n\nLoki, Season 2 (October 5, 2023)\n\nWhat If...? Season 2 (December, 2023)\n\nEcho (January 9, 2024)\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine (July 26, 2024)\n\nAgatha All Along(September 18, 2024)\n\nThunderbolts (TBC)\n\nCaptain America: New World Order (February 14, 2025)\n\nDaredevil: Born Again (March, 2025)\n\nMCU Phase 6\n\nPhase 6 of the MCU is set to have fewer releases, but all of them are looking to be big events. This includes the next two Avengers team-up movies and the long-awaited MCU reboot of the Fantastic Four.\n\nFantastic Four (July 25, 2025)\n\nBlade (November 7, 2025)\n\nAvengers 5 [previously titled Avengers: The Kang Dynasty] (May 1, 2026)\n\nAvengers: Secret Wars (May 7, 2027)\n\nThe best order to watch Marvel movies for the first time\n\nIf you're brand new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and want to catch up on the movies without having to watch all 32, here's a short list of MCU films that you need to watch in order for it all to make sense.\n\nIron Man\n\nAvengers Assemble\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy\n\nCaptain America: Civil War\n\nThor: Ragnarok\n\nBlack Panther\n\nAvengers: Infinity War\n\nAvengers: Endgame\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home\n\nThere will be characters that pop up that you're not immediately familiar with (Captain Marvel and Dr. Strange) and the odd reference that you'll miss, but on the whole, you'll get the gist of what's been happening in the MCU and get to watch the best, funniest and most impactful moments throughout.\n\nHow to watch Marvel movies in order of best-rated\n\nSome hardcore Marvel fans have gone as far as wanting to watch the 29 MCU films in order of their rating on review platforms like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. Though this would mean you’re watching the films completely out of order, it could be a nice way to save the best for last, as it were. If you started your MCU binge with The Incredible Hulk – a movie that many of us don’t really consider as part of the MCU – and work towards the final two instalments of the Avengers.\n\nMCU IMDB scores\n\n*Accurate as of November 2022\n\nAvengers: Infinity War (IMDb score: 8.4)\n\nAvengers: Endgame (IMDb score: 8.4)\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home (IMDb score: 8.3)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy (IMDb score: 8.0)\n\nIron Man (IMDb score: 7.9)\n\nThor: Ragnarok (IMDb score: 7.9)\n\nCaptain America: Civil War (IMDb score: 7.8)\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier (IMDb score: 7.8)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2 (IMDb score: 7.6)\n\nDoctor Strange (IMDb score: 7.5)\n\nShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (IMDb score: 7.4)\n\nSpider-Man: Far from Home (IMDb score: 7.4)\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming (IMDb score: 7.4)\n\nBlack Panther (IMDb score: 7.3)\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever (IMDb score: 7.3)\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron (IMDb score: 7.3)\n\nAnt-Man (IMDb score: 7.3)\n\nIron Man 3 (IMDb score: 7.2)\n\nDr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (IMDb score: 7.1)\n\nThor: Love and Thunder (IMDb score: 7.0)\n\nAvengers Assemble (IMDb score: 7.0)\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp (IMDb score: 7.0)\n\nThor (IMDb score: 7.0)\n\nIron Man 2 (IMDb score: 7.0)\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger (IMDb score: 6.9)\n\nCaptain Marvel (IMDb score: 6.8)\n\nThor: The Dark World (IMDb score: 6.8)\n\nBlack Widow (IMDb score: 6.7)\n\nThe Incredible Hulk (IMDb score: 6.7)\n\nEternals (IMDb score: 6.4)\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (IMDb score: 6.2)\n\nThis, however, is a very subjective list. I personally would never have put Dr Strange above Black Panther. So you might want to tweak this particular list to suit your own opinion.\n\nHow long is the Marvel timeline?\n\nThe events that take place in the MCU universe span thousands of years, and the time taken to watch all the movies in this universe is fairly long too. With 32 films released over 17 years, each phase of the MCU seemed to introduce longer and longer movie runtimes, with the epic Avengers finale clocking in at just over three hours long.\n\nSo how long would it take for you to watch all the MCU movies? Here are all the MCU films in order of shortest to longest:\n\nThe Incredible Hulk: 1 hour 52 minutes\n\nThor: The Dark World: 1 hour 52 minutes\n\nThor: 1 hour 55 minutes\n\nDoctor Strange: 1 hour 55 minutes\n\nAnt-Man: 1 hour 57 minutes\n\nAnt-Man and The Wasp: 1 hour 58 minutes\n\nThor: Love and Thunder: 1 hour 58 minutes\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy: 2 hours 2 minutes\n\nIron Man 2: 2 hours 4 minutes\n\nCaptain America: The First Avenger: 2 hours 4 minutes\n\nCaptain Marvel: 2 hours 4 minutes\n\nAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania: 2 hours 4 minutes\n\nIron Man: 2 hours 6 minutes\n\nDr Strange in the Multiverse of Madness: 2 hours 6 minutes\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home: 2 hours 9 minutes\n\nIron Man 3: 2 hours 10 minutes\n\nThor: Ragnarok: 2 hours 10 minutes\n\nShang Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings: 2 hours 12 minutes\n\nSpider-Man: Homecoming: 2 hours 13 minutes\n\nBlack Panther: 2 hours 14 minutes\n\nBlack Widow: 2 hours 14 minutes\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier: 2 hours 16 minutes\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: 2 hours 17 minutes\n\nAvengers: Age of Ultron: 2 hours 21 minutes\n\nThe Avengers: 2 hours 23 minutes\n\nCaptain America: Civil War: 2 hours 27 minutes\n\nAvengers: Infinity War: 2 hours 29 minutes\n\nEternals: 2 hours 36 minutes\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever: 2 hours 41 minutes\n\nAvengers: Endgame: 3 hours 1 minute\n\nThis means that, as of now, the total MCU runtime is 68 hours and 36 minutes. So if you wanted to watch the entire Marvel timeline, non-stop, back-to-back, it would take you well over two and a half days.\n\nSo which is the best way to watch all the Marvel movies?\n\nCall me old-fashioned, but I think it’s best to watch the Marvel movies for the first time in the order they were released. With all the post-credit teasers, plot twists, and character development, the release order gives you the best introduction to each Marvel character and their place in the wider MCU."
