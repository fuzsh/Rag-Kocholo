        "text": "Critical Role: Downfall is a three-part special set over a century into The Calamity, following six divine figures and \"the role that they played in the destruction of the flying city of Aeor\".[1] This special is part of the third campaign of Critical Role and ran from \"Downfall: Part One\" (3x99) to \"Downfall: Part Three\" (3x101) in July 2024.[1][2]\n\nPremise[]\n\nThe in-universe narrative setup of the special is that Ludinus activated the Occultus Thalamus in the ruins of Aeor to show the Bells Hells a recording of the city's fall[3] since the device recorded everything that happened to anyone within the city.[4] This surveillance device, like much of Aeorian technology, was tuned to divine threads[5] and tracked, read and recorded the essence and location of souls within the city.[6] Matt Mercer commented that \"the Occultus Thalamus uniquely stores more information from powers that are attuned to its arcane technology than even it anticipated.\"[7]\n\nThe recording reveals that to get around the Latimus Princeps, Aeor's wards against divinity, several gods split part of themselves off to be born as mortal incarnations. This allowed them to infiltrate Aeor and neutralize the threat of the god-killing weapon known as the Factorum Malleus.[8]\n\nCast[]\n\nIn the prologue, the cast played the gods as they fled Tengar.[9] The true names of the gods are obscured in the audio, however, these names were accessible in the first episode's subtitles.[10][11] Laura Bailey and Noshir Dalal then play as new characters when the special jumps forward in time.[12] The on-screen player character cards include binary numbers across the bottom of each one which translate to various deity domains.[13]\n\nActor Prologue Character Ancestry Classification Binary Code Laura Bailey Nahal Emhira Human Warlock[14] DEATH Taliesin Jaffe Ash Asha Wolf (elf) Monk[15] (Way of the Long Death) NATURE Ashley Johnson Luz Trist Human Paladin (Oath of Redemption)/Cleric[16] (Light Domain) MERCY Noshir Dalal Edam The Emissary Earth genasi Barbarian[17] (Path of the Juggernaut) LAW Nick Marini Aru Ayden Human Barbarian/Druid (Circle of Stars)/Cleric (Peace Domain)/Paladin (Oath of the Ancients)[18] DAWN Abubakar Salim Coru S.I.L.A.H.A. Aeormaton Sorcerer (Clockwork Soul)/Warlock[19] BEAUTY Brennan Lee Mulligan The Dungeon Master\n\nProduction[]\n\nThe announcement video noted that Downfall will be a standalone special which requires no prior knowledge of either Critical Role or Exandria Unlimited.[1] Brennan Lee Mulligan described it as a prequel within the narrative of the third campaign.[20] While the special is intended to have \"its own impact\", it is also \"specifically\" aimed at having an \"impact for Bells Hells and for Campaign three\".[21] On tapping Mulligan to be the guest Dungeon Master for this special, Matthew Mercer explained, \"I was anxious at the possibility of trying to live up to what I saw in my head, then had the joyful realization that somebody else that I trust can do it better justice than I think I ever could\".[22]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nDownfall went into production in January 2024.[23][20] Similar to Exandria Unlimited: Calamity, the special originated from a conversation between Mulligan and Mercer about the lore of Exandria and Aeor's place in its history during a lunch which was intended as a non-work hangout.[20] The setting is apocalyptic since Exandria has been dealing with a god-war for centuries; Downfall is a \"snapshot\" of when \"the Gods called a timeout to go and destroy Aeor\" since the city was \"developing a weapon capable of killing the gods\".[21] Mulligan thought that sentence of historical lore on the brief armistice between the Betrayer Gods and the Prime Deities was \"very heavy\" and he \"just got excited about that historical period and about all the stuff to do with that\".[21]\n\nIn comparing the two series, Mulligan highlighted that Calamity was more about the end of the Age of Arcanum while the \"beginning of Downfall is where you see the Calamity\" as it occurs over a century into this new era.[20] While both stories are \"about a fabled city of the Age of Arcanum falling to Exandria below in wrath and ruin\", Mulligan felt that \"you could not have two more different stories\" as Downfall wrestles with very different themes.[20] The special is a tragedy with a focus on moral horror;[21][24] it showcases the actions of the Prime Deities at their \"darkest moment\".[25] As he did with Calamity, Mulligan provided players a \"player's guide\". In order to set the tone, the pamphlet features images from the movies The Clash of the Titans (1981), Oppenheimer (2023), New Jack City (1991). He also cited Saturn Devouring His Son as well as Lady MacBeth as inspirations, reflecting on themes of power, duty, betrayal, ethics and morals.[26][27][21] Mercer and Mulligan crafted the Aeor setting of the Downfall era together along with building the battle maps together.[22]\n\nCharacter creation[]\n\nEach player was asked to pitch three different gods;[28] during the game's unaired session zero, the cast shared their various ideas.[29] After everyone had shared their pitches, the cast discussed which \"ones could mesh and which ones resonated strongly with the rest of the group\".[30] Laura Bailey commented that \"all the dudes\" pitched at least one Betrayer God.[31] While the cast was not restricted to the Prime Deities, Mulligan asked them if they had a vision for playing a Betrayer God that would give them a relationship to what was happening that was as textured and complex as the one they had for a Prime Deity.[32] The cast had discussions with Mulligan on how good is endlessly complicated.[33] Mulligan was concerned that if some of the cast was playing as Betrayers, they would then realize that their character don't have conflicting feelings about destroying Aeor or antagonizing the people who are playing Primes.[34] Noshir Dalal thought that while some of the cast had \"juicy ideas\" for the Betrayers, they had determined it would \"probably be best if we were all at least at the same side because otherwise, just the crazy amount of infighting and duplicity going on that would be a really hard party to run in only three episodes\".[29] Taliesin Jaffe ended up thinking that playing as a Betrayer would not be as interesting because the character would basically be an NPC there to call the Primes hypocrites.[35]\n\nAdditionally, Marisha Ray was keen to have The Matron of Ravens at the table and pitched Bailey on playing that character;[36][30] Mercer revealed additional information on the character's backstory to give Bailey more context to play her.[37][30] Nick Marini's character was the most multiclassed player character in the history of Critical Role with levels in four different classes – Marini joked that \"when I'm multiclassing, I always say, you can take the boy out of 3.5 but you can't take 3.5 out of the boy\". [38] Marini wanted the various classes to represent distinct phases of his character's life.[38] During session zero, the cast figured out their character relationships with each other; the cast also \"had side conversations between the players about who knew each other\" to establish additional relationship details before the first episode.[30] Noshir Dalal raised concerns with Mulligan about the The Lawbearer's perspective which led to the development of that god's herald, The Emissary.[39][29]\n\nFilming[]\n\nOn introducing this special at the end of \"The Nox Engine\" (3x98), Mulligan said, \"Matt talked to me about the framing of that moment months ago. And I was like gasping at the idea of... it's such a cool diegetic in world, out of world, like moving from one place to another along with the perspective of the characters, which is just so sick. And it means that everything that we're going to do is going to really matter the moment we jump back. Because the immediacy of whatever that story is comes roaring back into the immediate aftermath of what happened tonight\".[40]\n\nWhile Mercer gave Mulligan \"broad strokes\" of his intended narrative, he also gave Mulligan \"'total freedom' to improvise while role-playing at the table\".[22] Mulligan explained that \"With Matt, it's never restrictive. It's much more like: 'Here's an area that I need to protect for something coming in the next campaign, and then everything else here is the playground\".[22] The special was filmed in one week.[20] Right before the first episode began filming, the cast re-established their character relationships at the table so \"it would be fresh\" when they started playing.[30] During the first episode, following the prologue, the cast was then taken by surprise when Dalal was not playing the character they had expected.[41][42][29] Rascal noted that the prologue leans \"into the awe-inspiring isness that these deities embody prior to creation\" as \"formless light beings\" within Tengar – \"when their names are spoken, their true, godly names, the audio is edited to be almost unintelligible, while a kaleidoscopic filter covers the actor's mouths, impressing on the audience that this is beyond our human understanding\".[11] The cast was surprised by the nature of the prologue;[42] Abubakar Salim highlighted that in the \"first sequence, I think we all had no idea what was going on. It was pure reaction\".[11]\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nNo. Title Original airdate Link Runtime 99 \"Downfall: Part One\" (3x99) VOD 4:17:00 In the midst of a lull in The Calamity, a group of powerful individuals embark on a divine mission to the flying city of Aeor... 100 \"Downfall: Part Two\" (3x100) VOD 4:00:00 The Divine continue their infiltration of Aeor, looking deeper into the city's flaws and virtues as they seek out the center of its hubris... 101 \"Downfall: Part Three\" (3x101) VOD 6:11:02 All of the Divine planning and improvising comes to a head in the final battle within Aeor's underbelly...\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBrennan Lee Mulligan was the Dungeon Master for Exandria Unlimited: Calamity (2022) which showed the trigger of the Calamity and the fall of the flying city Avalir. Mulligan commented that \"to the casual observer, it feels like I'm the guy they call in when a sky city collapses. Like the guy you call when you have raccoons under the the porch\".[20]\n\nHannah Friederichs, who worked on the portraits of the player characters, revealed that among the tools she used in the process were the watercolor brushes of Jenny Dolfen, another well known critter artist.[43]\n\nMulligan later confirmed that the silver dragon who took part in the battle against the mortal avatars of the gods at the Factorum Malleus, and was killed, was actually Bolo, who originally debuted in Calamity; the name drop was intended to be in episode's captions as part of Bolo's departing words, however, it wasn't included in the \"Downfall: Part Three\" (3x101) Beacon or YouTube VODs.[44][45]\n\nLaura Bailey believes that the recording that these three episodes represent only showed Bells Hells and Ludinus Da'leth the circumstances around the fall of Aeor itself, so they didn't watch the prologue of \"Downfall: Part One\" (3x99).[46] This was confirmed in the introduction of \"Reconciliation\" (3x102).[47]\n\nReferences[]\n\nArt:"
