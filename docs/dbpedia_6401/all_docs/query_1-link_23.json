        "text": "- Nearly at the boom, sir.\n\n- Yes, we'll be in by tea if you don't hit it.\n\n- Keep her on the same course.\n\n- Aye aye, sir.\n\n- What's the weather like, Coxswain?\n\n- Oh, so-so, sir.\n\n- Well, another pleasure cruise over.\n\n- Yes, sir.\n\nCan I give you a hand, sir?\n\n- What are you doing this leave, sir?\n\n- Depends on the bank balance.\n\nAre you due for leave, Coxswain?\n\nYes, sir. We've got a wedding in our family.\n\nThe TI's getting spliced to my sister.\n\nReally? Oh, that's fine.\n\nDon't forget my piece of cake.\n\nOK, sir.\n\n- Flunkey, try and get the salt out of these.\n\n- Leave it to me.\n\nIt's got to be faced.\n\nOne of us has got to miss his leave.\n\nWhat's that?\n\nOh, hello, Dicky. We were just talking\n\nabout Arnold going sick.\n\n- It was his turn to stay behind this time.\n\n- Thinking of taking his place, were you?\n\nWho, me? Not at all.\n\nBut somebody's got to stay behind.\n\nI know that. Tonsils at your age! Why didn't\n\nyou have them out when you were a kid?\n\nMy mother didn't believe in it, sir.\n\nWell, we've got to fix this. Let's see.\n\nYou're already staying, aren't you, Nobby?\n\nYes. How about Tiggy?\n\nHe doesn't mind missing his leave.\n\nOh. And what about the TI here?\n\nAnd yourself, Coxswain?\n\nMike's getting married this leave.\n\nAs he happens to be marrying my sister...\n\nYou two and this wedding!\n\nThis is the third time it's cropped up.\n\nIt's not my fault\n\nthat something always happens to interfere.\n\nNothing's going to interfere this time.\n\nThat's right, Coxswain, get him all tied up.\n\nShut the hatch, flood the boat.\n\n- You're done for this time, TI.\n\n- Who asked you to butt in, Hobson?\n\nI like to take a look at the petty officers\n\nnow and again. It's good for discipline.\n\nI wish he was one himself. I'd have put him\n\ndown for this. Don't take any notice of him.\n\nJust because he's mucked up his own life.\n\nI'll put Williams down for this job,\n\nand he can lump it.\n\nWe ain't all got your sex appeal, Canada.\n\nAw, it's easy. Anybody can pick up a dame\n\noutside a factory.\n\nSit still, jellyfish.\n\nI found a nice piece of homework last leave.\n\nWorks in a fag shop.\n\nOught to be good for a packet of 20, then.\n\n- I suppose you'll be seeing the wife.\n\n- What?\n\nI was talking to Dowsley.\n\nShe'll be parked outside the dock gates now.\n\n- Can't get a female under 40 in my village.\n\n- Why not, Oxford?\n\n- The Poles are billeted there.\n\n- (Laughter)\n\nYou almost make me sick.\n\nNothing else to think about on leave\n\nbut females, dames, homework.\n\nWith all the ugly fizzogs here,\n\nwhat can you expect?\n\nYou're safe enough, Spud.\n\nThe women won't worry you.\n\n- And why not?\n\n- You've got no brass.\n\nBy the time you settle your bets,\n\nyou won't have any left.\n\nI don't need money to enjoy my leave.\n\nYou wouldnae need much.\n\nI doubt it'll be more than 48 hours.\n\n- Like to bet on that?\n\n- I'm not betting.\n\n- But dinnae bargain on more than 48 hours.\n\n- Ah, go boil yourself!\n\nGo and jump in yer oil tank.\n\n- Sound off, Coxswain.\n\n- (Shrill whistle)\n\nStand to attention on the casing.\n\n- Slow astern, starboard.\n\n- Slow astern, starboard, sir.\n\nHello, Freddie. A nice quiet trip?\n\nYes, worse luck. I see you've sunk\n\nanother couple of fishing smacks.\n\nYes, just a 10,000-tonner and a 4,000.\n\nWhat the hell do you work with?\n\nOld Moore's Almanack?\n\n(Horn blasts)\n\n- Hello, Taylor. No luck again?\n\n- Afraid not, sir.\n\n- Any to fix?\n\n- No, sir.\n\n- Crew all right?\n\n- One case of tonsils.\n\nVery well. The usual notice for sea.\n\nGive leave to one watch.\n\nYes. Excuse me, sir.\n\nGordon? Are you going to the wardroom?\n\nGet me Grosvenor 2777, will you?\n\n- Yes, sir.\n\n- Who are you seeing this leave?\n\n- Your Aunt Margaret again?\n\n- I can't risk it, sir. Her husband's on leave.\n\nHere, one for you.\n\nAnd three for the skipper.\n\nWild violets, jasmine.\n\nFish and chips?\n\n- Fish and chips.\n\n- Hello, Freddie.\n\n- Have a drink?\n\n- Pink gin, please.\n\n- Hello, sir.\n\n- Hello.\n\n- Nice trip?\n\n- Very boring.\n\n- (Buzzer)\n\n- Close shave.\n\nYes, I'm using a cutthroat.\n\n- Your call's through, sir.\n\n- Thanks.\n\n- Two pink gins, please.\n\n- I'll bring them right away, sir.\n\nThat you, Drake? How's the gout?\n\nGood. How's the old man?\n\nGood. And how's the bank balance?\n\nOh. Oh, well, I'll have to manage on my pay.\n\nNow, listen carefully.\n\nI want you to ring Miss Seymour\n\nand make a date for lunch tomorrow.\n\n- Yeah. Get a four-pound box of chocolates.\n\n- Four-pound box of...\n\n- There is a war on, sir.\n\n- Is there? I haven't seen much of it lately.\n\nWell, use your influence, Drake.\n\nBook two seats at the Hippodrome in the\n\nevening and a table at the Grill afterwards.\n\nNow, Tuesday. Miss, erm... Carter.\n\nNo, no, wait a minute, wait a minute.\n\nErm... Miss Davis, I think.\n\n- No, no, hang on, Drake.\n\n- Make your mind up, Freddie!\n\nThat'll be all for the present, Drake.\n\nI'll fix the rest with you tomorrow. Goodbye.\n\nIf you two baboons had\n\nthe elementary instincts of gentlemen...\n\n- (Coughs)\n\n- That's a nasty cough you've got, TI.\n\n- Yes, sir. Erm... No, sir.\n\n- Something you want to see me about?\n\n- I wanted to see Lieutenant Brace, sir.\n\n- I'm afraid he's not here. Anything I can do?\n\nErm... Well...\n\n- Well, what is it?\n\n- It's about Petty Officer Arnold's leave, sir.\n\nSomebody's got to stay and take his place.\n\n- Yes, I think it's arranged Williams stays.\n\n- Yes, sir. Well, that's just it.\n\nYou see, it's very hard on poor Williams, sir,\n\nwith his domestic troubles, sir,\n\nand his two youngest in hospital, sir.\n\n- Williams isn't married, is he?\n\n- Oh, yes, sir.\n\nHow else would he have two youngest, sir?\n\nYou're not offering to forgo\n\nyour own leave, are you?\n\n- Erm... Yes, sir.\n\n- But I thought you were getting married.\n\nWhat's the matter, TI? Cold feet?\n\nOh, no, sir.\n\nThere isn't a nicer girl in London, sir.\n\nIt's just that... I think a man shouldn't\n\nrush at matrimony, like.\n\nI quite agree.\n\nI think I'd like just to think it over\n\na bit longer, sir, if you know what I mean.\n\n- Very well, TI. I'll fix it.\n\n- Thank you, sir.\n\nOh, TI, tell Hobson\n\nI want to see him in my cabin, will you?\n\n- (Knock at door)\n\n- Come in.\n\nOh, it's you, Hobson. Come in.\n\nI wanted to have a little talk\n\nwith you unofficially. Cigarette?\n\nNo, thanks, sir.\n\nYou know, I've often wondered\n\nabout you, Hobson,\n\nwhy you haven't gone higher in the Service.\n\nI mean, you've knocked about the world a bit\n\nand you speak a couple of languages.\n\nIt seems a pity, really, that a man like you\n\nshould mess up his life,\n\njust because...\n\nHobson, I've had a letter\n\nfrom your brother-in-law.\n\nI think the best thing I can do\n\nis to hand it to you.\n\nI don't have to read that to know what's in it.\n\nIt's about your wife. She wants a separation.\n\nWhy can't he stick to his fish and chips\n\nand keep out of my business?\n\nYes, I'm inclined to agree with you.\n\nI don't like the sound of your brother-in-law.\n\nOn the other hand,\n\nyou can hardly blame him if your wife...\n\nHe's always trying to separate us. Never out\n\nof the house the whole time I'm at sea.\n\nWhy do you give him so much leeway?"
