        "text": "In Which We Serve, directed by Noël Coward and David Lean (although Coward also had many other roles), is a solid wartime propaganda film promoting national unity but far from great cinema. Visually the film is quite dynamic and the way weather and water are used creates a realistic atmosphere. Structurally the film is interesting because of how it flicks through time and the memories of the characters. A watery effect used to transition into flashbacks is actually quite cool. The action scenes are also pretty good, especially considering the film's limitations. However In Which We Serve is a very dull film. The characters are universally uninteresting and the jittery plot makes it seem like the film is never headed anywhere.…\n\n#28 of 100 in my Top 100 Directors Challenge\n\nDirector David Lean teamed up with Noel Coward to create this mid-War War II chronicle of a British Royal Navy destroyer, the HMS Torin, from cradle to watery grave. The story is told as a retrospective through the memories of the survivors of the vessel's sinking by German dive bombers off the island of Crete in 1942. Coward himself plays Captain E. V. Kinross R.N., a married officer with two adolescent children, who recalls the commissioning of his ship just prior to England's declaration of war in September 1939.\n\nAs the castaway crewman cling to a life raft ducking bullets, they reflect on their families, their memories of Christmas, preparing the…\n\nIn Which We Serve is yet another classic British war film that I had never seen before. I only really knew of it for two reasons. Firstly, it was included on the list of the 100 greatest British films of the 20th century which was released by the British Film Institute. Secondly, it was the directorial debut of a titan of British cinema, David Lean. As a result, I was interested to see what In Which We Serve had to offer. While, I wasn't blown away by it, I still found it to be somewhat interesting.\n\nThe film tells the story of the HMS Torrin, from it's construction to its sinking in the Mediterranean during action in the Second World…\n\nIt is no surprise that war films are often praised for their depictions of courage and bravery. While these films can be inspiring and uplifting, they often fail to portray war's realities accurately. This is the case with the war film In Which We Serve. This 1942 British patriotic war film, directed by Noël Coward and David Lean, and created with the assistance of the Ministry of Information, follows the story of a British destroyer and its crew during the war, along with the hardships they faced. While the film was intended to be a morale booster for the British public, it has been criticised for its romanticised and overly-simplistic portrayal of the war.\n\nWhile it does show the courage…\n\nNot entirely sure what it is, but similar to Wyler’s epic drama The Best Years of Our Lives, Eastwood’s war poignancies Flags of Our Fathers & Letters from Iwo Jima, and other films depicting the brutal Allies vs. Axis tussles across the world, my thoughts were that this Noël Coward-David Lean collaboration would be up my alley. However, the impact it delivers doesn’t exactly strike through me as once predicted. That's not to say that such a sharp piece of wartime propaganda from the geniuses behind the great Brief Encounter isn't a classic jewell of inspirational entertainment while also a wistful cinematic tale of man’s loyalty to country or their families (as a matter of fact, it’s both regarding the latter.).…\n\n62/100\n\n[Originally written on my blog.]\n\nNot bad for wartime propaganda—in many respects it plays more like postwar reflection along the lines of The Best Years of Our Lives, emphasizing domestic uncertainty as much as battlefield bravery. (Can you use the word \"battlefield\" if it's planes vs. boats? Can't think of an alternative.) Upper lips are at maximum stiffness throughout, to somewhat stultifying effect, but the tone is so quietly sober that there's little sense of being rallied; the Captain's addresses to the crew come across more like Kevin Spacey in Margin Call than like Henry V at Agincourt, even as Coward proves more commanding than you'd expect. I'm a stickler for structural integrity, though, so it bothers me (perhaps…\n\nNoël Coward was a great, perhaps unequaled, contributor to the entertainment world. He also ventured into cinema, and he peaked in his collaboration with the great David Lean. They made four films together; In Which We Serve, This Happy Breed, Blithe Spirit and Brief Encounter.\n\nCoward's most active effort was in the first of these; he of course wrote it, but also produced, starred and co-directed the film.\n\nDuring World War II, many directors from around the world made it their mission to make PR films to cheer up their own troops' morale and at the same time also comfort the people at home. Some were more candid efforts, like Laurence Olivier's Henry V or Powell & Pressburger's The Life and…\n\nCreated in the midst of WWII, In Which We Serve is the story of the HMS Torrin's crew, showing the ship's building, deployment, and eventual sinking. Two first-time directors collaborated to make the film: the celebrated playwright Noël Coward and the talented film editor David Lean. Coward wrote the script, and he also plays the captain of the ship in the film, leaving Lean to do the bulk of the directing. Coward and Lean would go on to make three more films together, with Lean directing and Coward writing.\n\nThe film shows the Torrin's sinking almost right away, and the story unfolds through a series of flashbacks to the lives of various members of the crew. The flashbacks are signaled…\n\nDAVID LEAN (7/18)\n\nIn quickly learning that this was largely a work of wartime propaganda, as the presumably obligatory beginning and ending narrations don't let you forget and thankfully don't reduce what this film accomplishes, I just as quickly began to adjust my expectations for something along the lines of Kurosawa's The Most Beautiful or Wyler's Mrs. Miniver, being a passable work that marginally showcases the talents and capacities of their respective directors without showcasing what makes them the deservedly esteemed and accomplished filmmakers that they are outside of these works. Thankfully and most surprisingly, I also just as quickly realized as the film proper began that I would not have to adjust my expectations for much longer as Lean…\n\nSteve's Priority Watchlist Project\n\nI wasn't sure whether I'd seen In Which We Serve before but I definitely had and if my memory is sure of it then anybody could be, too.\n\nI love the way this is structured, and I say that as someone who normally dislikes non-linear films. It doesn't feel at all like a gimmick here though, there's a sincerity to the way this is told, using flashbacks of men stranded after their ship is brought down by the Nazis. In that situation, it makes sense to tell it this way.\n\nIt does mean that it's much more of a character piece than an action-based war film but with such a strong cast and some decent characterisation,…"
