        "text": "I legitimately don’t know where to start with this game. Drawn in by the peculiar launch trailer and social media sentiment, I finished Thank Goodness You’re Here in a single sitting. Yes, the game is short, but it’s not short on charm. Given this is the same group that published the likes of Untitled Goose Game, I can certainly agree that this fits perfectly in the library, and is a good fit for yours as well.\n\nA disclaimer right out of the gate; just because the game looks so cute does not mean your young children should play it. I didn’t even realize this was an M-rated game, but it didn’t take long into playing Thank Goodness You’re Here to figure it out. There is plenty of sexual innuendo, and even an f-bomb that drops later in the story. Be forewarned, this is not a kid’s game.\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s dive in. Thank Goodness You’re Here takes place in the city of Barnsworth, where you, a traveling salesman, are sent on business. The atmosphere is completely British, to the point I was confused by some of the comedic bits. Still, I can recognize the intention, and boy, is this game funny.\n\nFrom the opening where the random commercials come through, I was grinning like an idiot. Then, when I was supposed to exit my boss’s office, and did the minor puzzle work of pushing over a water cooler barrel to stand on and jump out the window, I died laughing as the boss yelled about the door that was right there. Also mixed into the opening are a lot of real-world video shots, and I wish there was more of that throughout the game. It’s only in snippets, but it creates a different feeling for Thank Goodness You’re Here.\n\nOnce I had landed in a bus and headed to Barnsworth, I sat in the mayor’s office waiting to be seen. You’re supposed to get impatient and leave, and once I did, everything hit the fan. This is when you get into the full world of Thank Goodness You’re Here, which isn’t huge, but feels expansive in how it’s designed. Not to mention, you’re a tiny man, so that automatically makes everything larger.\n\nAs you drift along, different townsfolk need help. Some are very specific in asking, like the handyman needing you to find his screwdriver he believes was taken by the woman at the local store. Others can be extremely vague, like at the start where a guy is stuck in a storm drain (or so he says). You know he needs to get unstuck, and after walking around you see a butter shop. So lucky that’s around, eh?\n\nOne of the reasons this all works is because there are plenty of dialogue clues to get you where you need to go. There’s no journal, menu, inventory, nothing, so it’s honestly impressive that Thank Goodness You’re Here flows as well as it does. Occasionally I would hear the person I needed to help remark on how you can help, and given the comedy stylings, it works here where it doesn’t in other games.\n\nThat said, the story is paper thin. All you know is that you’re here to sell something, and end up helping a lot of people with different tasks. There at least seems to be an emerging story in the background between two pie companies, but Thank Goodness You’re Here never gets back to it. You will run into a few small stories that are fun (the milk shy one is just… play the game and you’ll see), but there’s not a lot of substance here. I don’t think there necessarily has to be, but it’s noticeable. Even so, the dialogue is masterful, with the likes of Matt Berry delivering fantastic lines.\n\nAlso noticeable, the outstanding world around you. Barnsworth and the entire game are smashing, made up of gorgeously hand drawn visuals. The art style is incredibly distinct, which is a good part of why I wanted to play it. One thing is for sure, the beauty in art design alone is worth the price of entry.\n\nThank Goodness You’re Here is almost too simple to play. You walk, you jump, and you slap (and trust me, everyone got slapped). This game is literally two buttons and a joystick. It’s a lot of fun to play, but I do wish there was a little more to what I was doing. Traversing each area is relatively easy, and there are a few platforming moments. Most of the engaging sequences take the form of a WarioWare-type mini-game, with specific presses required. It’s a bit barebones, and even though it works for this game – similar to how the story is – there’s so much more it could be.\n\nThen, Thank Goodness You’re Here just… ends. It’s a bit abrupt, with a final moment where the mayor comes available. This final segment is funny, and lends itself to the slapstick I’ve been enjoying. At two hours, it feels short, but I don’t believe I mind. I think I’m fondly wishing there is more, but when I look back, this is the right way for it to end. Leave them wanting more, the saying goes.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the product in this article was provided for review purposes.\n\nSee below for our list of partners and affiliates:"
