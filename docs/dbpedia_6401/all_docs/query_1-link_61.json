        "text": "It's a bit unfair putting <b>Das Boot</b> in the poll, because - let's face it - it would most likely just trample everything else under its authentically German seaboots. So, for the sake of discussion, let's pretend that Das Boot has already won the poll. What's the NEXT best sub film?<br><br>As touched upon over in THIS thread, I rate K19 very highly indeed. It did poorly at the box office, and given Kathryn Bigelow's rather foolish decision to spend over $100mill making this sucker, it seems to have pretty much taken her career down into the Marianas Trench. But it's based on a true story, at the height of the Cold War, when a first generation Hotel-class Soviet boomer really did develop a major reactor fault. The reactor was heading for meltdown, and a whole bunch of crewmen were heavily irradiated (many fatally) whilst repairing the reactor. There's a fair bit of Hollywood horseshit in the movie, to develop dramatic tension (e.g. they relieve Liam Neeson of command because he won't obey orders, but place him as the XO? Nyet. -- View image here: https://cdn.arstechnica.net/forum/smilies/eyebrow.gif --). But the facts are that Soviet high command really were desperate to demonstrate nuclear parity with the US (for damn good reasons, let's not forget), and pushed K19 into its proving runs before it was ready. The captain made heroic efforts to save K19 (not least because a reactor meltdown might have been misinterpreted as a hostile nuclear act by twitchy trigger fingers in the US), and was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.<br><br>Now, other great sub films:<br><br>Red October: Top-notch popcorn. I liked Sam Neill's duff Russian accent, and very much enjoyed watching Alec Baldwin suspended from a helicopter over a nasty, heaving grey Atlantic. Either he's a much better actor than I give him credit for, or he was kacking his pants. My biggest objection to Red October is its underlying premise. Ask yourself - if it was a US boomer commander, in charge of a new class of sub that would break parity between the US and the Soviet Union - can you really see him defecting with the sub? It's total fantasy, written by someone who believes that Russians all secretly yearn to live in Montana and have American lifestyles.<br><br>Crimson Tide: Another belter. Great underlying premise, and deals with a very important subject (independent launch control of nukes). Viggo does a great turn as Weps, too. But the sub is just too shiny and unreal. Admittedly, I've never seen inside an American boomer, but do they really have floor grids, with crawlways underneath all lit up?<br><br>U-571: I must admit, I haven't seen this yet. But - speaking as a Brit - it's going to have to be absolutely unfuckingbelievably brilliant to overcome the colossal cheek of pinching one of the Royal Navy's finest moments and transplanting it into a US sub. Cheeky <i>bastards</i>, is all I can say.<br><br>Ice Station Zebra: Pretty damn good little Alistair MacLean cold war thriller this one. <br><br>Run Silent, Run Deep: It's got Clark Gable in it - not A Good Thing, in my book. But Burt Lancaster is always watchable. Decent older sub flick, this one, IIRC.<br><br>The Bedford Incident: Haven't seen this one in its entirety, but 7.5/10 at IMDB and Richard Widmark makes me keen to do so.<br><br>Gray Lady Down: Haven't seen this one either, but Charlton Heston leaves me not exactly champing at the bit to do so. <br><br>Down Periscope: Yeah, I know. But if you can look past the Police Academy level \"humour\", there's some quite authentic-seeming sub tactics and trivia in there. Written by someone who clearly has spent time in the service, or is an excellent bullshitter.<br><br>Murphy's War: Wherein Peter O'Toole sorts out the dastardly U-boat that sank him and his crew, then machine-gunned them in the water. Nazi bastards. It's got a young Sian (Mrs O'Toole) Phillips in it, who I find disturbingly hot. Otherwise, meh.\n\nI can't remember if the film of Red October explains Ramius's motive for defection - but the book does. The reason was credible IMO. The bottom line was he took what he had and, because of who he was, that was the Krazny Oktobyr (or however you anglicise Russian).<BR><BR>I must say I haven't seen all of those sub movies. I'm tempted to say Crimson Tide if only because I like Gene Hackman as an actor so much.<BR><BR>U571 is a good movie if you ignore the fact it's rewritten history. The Brits do get an acknowledgement in the end credits though. The director was supposed to have said that if we didn't like his version of history, we should make our own war movies! Cheeky fucker.<BR><BR>By the way, one film you missed was We Dive At Dawn. It's pretty old-fashioned, black and white even! I watched it with my mum, who simply loves the old war movies, and I felt what made the film was the sub flying the Jolly Roger at the end of the film. Hollywood it ain't though. But maybe that's a good thing...<BR><BR>Hell, I'll vote Crimson Tide and hope when I watch it again it reflects well on my judgement now!"
