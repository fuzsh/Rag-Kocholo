        "text": "“Are you sure you want to do this?”\n\nJedediah can’t help but notice his partner’s anxious expression as he takes off his shirt. He's fumbling with his tunic more than usual, twirling the edges of it in his fingers, bunching it up in his fists.\n\n“Octavius, you don’t need to have sex with me if you ain’t comfortable. I’m down to just cuddle.”\n\nTaking a deep breath in, Octavius lets go of his tunic.\n\n“It’s not that,” he manages. “It’s just…”\n\nJedediah scoots aside, leaving room for his partner to sit next to him. Octavius’s thigh squishes against Jed’s, thicker and stubbled from a recent shaving. The shirtless cowboy curls one arm around his partner’s shoulders.\n\nIt’s quiet for a moment.\n\n“...is it true?”\n\nOctavius turns to his partner.\n\n“You are… a hunter? A predator?”\n\nJed’s face flushes, and Octavius can’t tell if it’s from embarrassment or rage.\n\n“I ain’t sure what yer implyin’.”\n\nOctavius goes red himself.\n\n“You know,” he mutters, patting his stomach twice.\n\n“Oh,” Jed’s expression softens. “Yep. Sure am.”\n\nThe sudden casual tone makes Octavius’s loins stir. The nonchalant admittance to eating other people does something to him. He’s heard of the alleged acts only in hushed whispers, the works of predators heralded with a person erased from the world. A life, a soul, extinguished, gone down the throat of someone higher on the food chain. They are rare, of course, rarer still in the age of technology. Hunger or not, it’s murder. He knows they had to have existed for millennia, since the dawn of humanity. Predators, to hunt prey.\n\nHe’s heard of them for years.\n\nAnd he’s fallen for one.\n\n“You gonna take off runnin’?” Jed asks. “I won’t fault’cha for it.”\n\nOctavius shakes his head.\n\n“No. No, I… I actually…”\n\nDeep breath, he thinks. You’re a general. You can handle this.\n\n“…I want to try it.”\n\nJed takes his arm away from Octavius’s shoulders.\n\n“Really? You wanna try bein’ a pred?” He asks. “You’d know if you were one by now, Ocky, it’s not like I woke up one day hungry.”\n\n“No, that’s not what I meant,” the Roman clarifies. “I… I want to…”\n\nHe can’t bring himself to say it.\n\nI want you to swallow me.\n\nThe warm feeling of a calloused palm against his cheek catches his attention.\n\n“You want me to eat’cha, don’t’cha?”\n\nOctavius can’t meet his gaze, but he nods. He’s better at putting all this into words, anyway.\n\n“Of course, darlin’. I’d love to.”\n\n“But…”\n\nJed stops, despite the watering of his mouth. Octavius is shivering.\n\n“…I’m afraid.”\n\n“Of what, darlin’?”\n\n“If you actually…” his voice drops to a whisper. “eat me, I’d perish, right? I don’t want that to happen. I don’t want to die.”\n\nJed nods, letting him continue.\n\n“I want to please you, I want to experience this, but not at the cost of my life. And I’m sure no one else you’ve eaten did either. So help me make sense of this — how have you not gotten caught?”\n\nThe cowboy hums a bit, thinking of how to answer this.\n\n“Well, I have my ways. For starters, I don’t go huntin’ easy targets. Most preds know that kids n’ teens are off limits. I ain’t no different. I also don’t hunt high-profile folks. Mayor, head priest over at Chichen Itza, you,” he bumps Octavius with his elbow. “You’re too noticeable.”\n\nOctavius mulls this over as Jed continues.\n\n“Second, I know this place’s magic is… interestin’, to say the least. Ahk said it best: any damage caused by the tablet, can be fixed by the tablet. Since that Rasputin incident, it’s set to an auto-fix. Anyone that dies in here gets revived an hour before the sun comes up.”\n\nHe nods. That night was apparently one of the worst ones they’d ever seen — he and countless others stuck in their day forms, their loyal guard turned to wax, and the Tyrannosaurus rex shattered into pieces. He wishes he was there to help, but their young Nicholas had defeated the mad mage and saved them all from certain doom.\n\n“And third, I don’t eat no one I can’t hypnotize.”\n\nThat catches his attention.\n\n“Hypnotize?”\n\nJed laughs a little bit.\n\n“Remember when we were in London, and you were all uppity about Lancelot?”\n\n“Indeed.”\n\n“Remember what you said?”\n\n“You’ll rue the day you crossed us with your huge sword and your hypnotic blue eyes!”\n\n“Yes, but what does that have to do with anything?”\n\n“Well, I thought you’d caught me. For a second I thought you’d figured out that I can do that to folks.”\n\n“Wait, you can actually do that? You can hypnotize people?”\n\n“Sure can,” Jed says, leaning his chin in one hand. “It makes the process easier for folks. It’s scary to get ate, anyone can tell ya that. I got lucky — most preds can’t do this. A few can, sure, but it’s just me in here. I don’t like hurtin’ folks that ain’t got nothin’ against me. That’s why I liked fightin’ you Romans.”\n\nOctavius laughs a bit, remembering their many fights during their war.\n\n“If you really wanna do this, Ocky,” Jed’s tone changes. “I’ll let’cha. You can go in. I’ll put ya under, and I’ll take care of ya. And when you come back, we’ll make sure you’re all there and all right.”\n\nHis hand takes Octavius’s own, calloused palm against his.\n\n“I won’t hurt you, not even a little. I won’t bite, n’ I’ll make sure you fall asleep before you start feelin’ the acid. And I’ll keep right here until you pop back.”\n\n“Where will I…?” Octavius asks, but Jed answers it before he can ask.\n\n“Right here,” he places Octavius’s helmet on the floor. “Somethin’ for the magic to grab onto.”\n\nThis is really happening. Octavius is going to enter his partner’s body, willingly, under hypnosis, and digest in his entirety. Something utterly insane to say aloud. Something that any reasonable person would run away screaming from. Something that goes against the very core of his society. It’s eat or be eaten — but why would a Roman want to be eaten? Why would the dominant Empire choose to submit to anyone?\n\nHe takes a deep breath, trying to escape that thought spiral.\n\n“All right. I’m ready.”\n\nJed smiles, brushing a lock of hair out of Octavius’s face.\n\n“Just let me do my work, Ocky. I gotcha.”\n\nCupping his cheeks in his palms, Jed closes his eyes.\n\nWhen he opens them again, they seem… bluer than before.\n\nOctavius feels something pulling him closer. It’s not the kind with satisfaction, like curiosity, it’s something else. Like the way water takes the path of least resistance. The way the moon orbits the Earth. Electricity to the ground, almost, a circuit connecting his mind to his partner.\n\nHis body reacts with fear. Shaking, trying to pull away — but his eyes remain. He cannot look away, even as his breathing quickens and his heart pounds in his chest. A sense of impending doom. He has to run. He has to get away. He has to—\n\nA little kiss, soft, gentle, against his lips.\n\n“It’s okay.”\n\nAs Jed pulls away, he takes the fear with him, all that anxious fear dragging from his soul with his lips.\n\nAnd Octavius realizes — it feels good.\n\nReally good.\n\nThe blue of his eyes surrounds him like the warm sea, enveloping and engulfing every crevasse of his mind. It pours into his brain, flooding his thoughts until nothing remains, only that beautiful blue. It’s like the ocean, the sky, the clear water of an oasis.\n\nHis mouth curls into a smile as joy floods his being.\n\n“There you go,” Jed’s voice feels like honey being poured on his soul. “There you go.”\n\nHe pets the Roman’s head, ruffling the curls usually hidden beneath his helmet. He wishes he’d take that thing off more often, if only to see how cute his curls bounce.\n\nblue soft safe feels good want more need more\n\nOctavius’s mind can’t form full sentences at this point. Just snippets and demands, barely capable of making a sound.\n\n“In… side.”\n\nSpeaking is difficult as well, but he manages. That’s what he wants more than anything — to dive into that blue, to enter its depths and swim to the bottom. To soar into it on the breeze, across its endless sky.\n\nJed’s stomach growls.\n\n“Of course, Ocky. Of course.”\n\nA little kiss, again. The feeling makes every nerve in Octavius’s body dance, signals in overload sending his mind into a state of bliss.\n\nWhen Jed pulls away, Octavius is left panting, breath shaky and deep.\n\n“Bon appétit.”\n\nAnd the cowboy parts his jaws.\n\nOctavius’s half-lidded eyes go wide at the sight — the straight teeth, the beautiful musculature of the throat, the impending darkness below, the soft plush tongue pressing against his cheek — and he smiles.\n\ndark warm cozy soft yes need inside go in swallow\n\nSavoring his partner’s flavor, Jed takes a breath.\n\nGulp.\n\nThe process of getting him in is easy for an experienced predator. Hundreds of prey had gone down that gullet — eating another is of no issue.\n\nOctavius, on the other hand, feels everything.\n\nThe tight darkness, the warm air, the moisture in the air, the pull of the muscles into the void. The loud gulps only bring him in deeper.\n\nHe can hear Jed’s heart beating in his ears as he slides in, his own thumping in time.\n\nEvery beat of that heart makes his skin jolt.\n\ndeep safe dark warm eat me i am food swallow me blue yes\n\nHis mind only swirls faster in the depths, even as a ring of muscle opens and he falls into the squishy softness inside. His limp body rests through the process, pliant as his mind, rotating naturally to a curled position, safely depositing into the stomach.\n\n“Ahh…” the voice above sighs, muffled. “There you go, sweet thing.”\n\nOctavius pants, face pressed against the pulsing walls. He did it. He actually did it. He’s here, inside, where he should be.\n\ndid good job am food inside now safe tummy warm tummy yes so safe\n\nEverything feels good. Everything feels soft. Everything feels wonderful.\n\n“Just let me take care of ya,” he can feel a hand caressing his back through the skin.\n\nOctavius’s mind is goop in his skull, his sensations sent into overdrive as the walls of Jed’s stomach cradle him. Every fold of flesh, every pulse of his heart, every slosh of gastric juice sends a tingling sensation across his skin that electrifies his spine and pools at the base of his cranium.\n\nwarm safe cozy yes good tummy safe place warm soft\n\nHe can’t speak, he doesn’t need to. He is deep in the trance, utterly safe and protected. If he were cognizant, he’d compare it to the womb that gave him life. From the body he came, and to the body he has returned.\n\nsafe home warm jedediah digest yes please home\n\nThese are only words that occupy his thoughts now, even as the walls leak a substance that makes that tingling sensation more intense. Some part of him knows that digestion has set in, some part of him wants to kick and scream.\n\nblue home safe home warm home him home home home\n\nAnd every other part of him wants to stay, here, in his lover’s belly, safe and sound. He’ll come back. He knows Jed wouldn’t betray him, wouldn’t lie to him. They’d been there for each other, through it all. He knows he is more than that, more than a simple meal.\n\nhome\n\nHe closes his eyes, cuddling the flesh around him as best he can. He can feel himself falling into something not quite like sleep, but not quite like death.\n\nHe lets it take him.\n\nThe lights go out.\n\nThis regeneration shit is easy, Jed thinks as he watches the golden magic glitter around Octavius’s helmet. Now it’s just a waiting game.\n\nJed gropes one of his hips, heavy with new weight. Octavius had been processed quickly, and it absolutely destroyed any idea of the cowboy wearing pants for the night. Rich, creamy rolls of fat hang over his waist, his belly soft and round, half-full of his partner’s matter.\n\nThe magical light solidifies, and Octavius takes a breath. He’s translucent — it takes a while for the matter to completely transfer — and Jed can see through him to the back of his helmet.\n\n“Hey, sugar.”\n\n“Ahh… hello.”\n\nJedediah grabs one of his love handles, jiggling the weight.\n\n“Look at me. You ruined my figure, Ocky.”\n\nThe still-dazed Roman rises from his prone position, sitting up.\n\nHe doesn’t sit that way for long — Jed mushes his ear against his belly.\n\n“That’s you hangin’ off me, sugar. I broke you down into nothin’.”\n\nOctavius can feel something stir in his sex, but it’s different this time.\n\n“I coulda won our little war. All that time fightin’ when I coulda eaten you and beat you without even bein’ awake to do it.”\n\nOctavius’s hands rise to knead the creamy flesh in front of him.\n\n“You little gut slut. All mine, all of you — UUUURP! — ahh, every part of you’s pumpin’ through my guts.”\n\nOctavius presses a little kiss to Jedediah’s navel.\n\nWisps of golden magic surround the two men, and Octavius can feel the fat under his palms receding. His body becomes more opaque.\n\nWith one last bwuurp!, Jed’s waistline returns to its normal state.\n\nOctavius now understands that need in his sex.\n\nIt matches the scratching in his gut.\n\nA hearty rumble comes up from his center as he rises up to his feet.\n\n“My turn.”"
