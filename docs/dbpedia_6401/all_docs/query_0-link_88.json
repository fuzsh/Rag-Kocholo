        "text": "Several Sonoma Valley nonprofit organizations are collaborating to offer a screening of a documentary film this month that provides an inside look at philanthropic groups and advocates giving them greater freedom to accomplish their missions.\n\n“UnCharitable,” released in 2023 and directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, will be shown at Sebastiani Theatre in Sonoma on Monday, Aug. 5, at 7 p.m. No admission will be charged, but attendees must register in advance on Eventbrite or at https://uncharitablesonoma.eventbrite.com.\n\nThe film is inspired by Dan Pallotta’s presentation on charity — which was voted the most persuasive TED Talk of all time — and his subsequent book, “Uncharitable.” The documentary is driven by the poignant personal stories of Pallotta, Edward Norton, Steve Nardizzi, Dorri McWhorter, Darren Walker, Scott Harrison and other prominent figures in philanthropy.\n\nThe event is being hosted by Sonoma Valley Mentoring Alliance, Sebastiani Theatre Foundation, Sonoma Valley Education Foundation, Boys & Girls Clubs of Sonoma Valley, Pets Lifeline, Hanna Center, La Luz Center and Sonoma Community Center. All these organizations have been invited to have a representative engage in a discussion with the audience after the screening.\n\n“When the documentary was announced, I reached out to a small group of youth-serving nonprofits to co-host the event with the mentoring alliance,” said Susie Gallo, executive director of Sonoma Valley Mentoring Alliance, which is leading the collaborative effort.\n\nGallo said that the Sonoma Valley nonprofit groups were eager to get involved because Pallotta is widely recognized as a champion for nonprofits who challenges everyone to view them differently.\n\n“It quickly grew into a group of nine nonprofits,” she said.\n\n“When the nonprofit community partners on programming, which we often do, it makes our work so much lighter,” she said. “The collaboration to host this screening really showcases how quickly and seamlessly we are able to come together on behalf of Sonoma Valley.”\n\nAll the nine nonprofit organizations are promoting the opportunity to view the film to their respective donor and volunteer bases. The organizations are all paying a small fee for the film license and theater rental rather than have one nonprofit incur all the costs.\n\n“UnCharitable” begins with a historical look at philanthropy, dating back to the Puritans, a religious reform movement that originated within the Church of England in the 16th century and migrated to New England in the 17th century.\n\n“Pallotta explains that our philanthropy today is still rooted in many of the values established centuries ago, and that it’s time for us to rethink how nonprofits are funded,” Gallo said.\n\nShe said that often, nonprofit organizations are expected to “do more with less.”\n\n“This approach is quite contrary to how we view for-profit corporations,” Gallo said. “What could be possible if we strove for nonprofits to have the resources they need to do their work most effectively?”\n\nGallo said the film is particularly relevant to Sonoma Valley because it relies heavily on nonprofit organizations to thrive, but that in such “places of plenty,” the depth of their needs is not often seen.\n\n“The nonprofits here work tirelessly to provide support and services across many sectors, from our schools to our seniors, and our pets to our unhoused,” Gallo said. “It’s always a good time to consider how we might do this work more efficiently, with fewer restrictions on our fundraising.”\n\nShe hopes the film will spark more discussion about philanthropy in general and the specific needs of each nonprofit organization in Sonoma Valley.\n\n“Sonoma is an incredibly charitable community, and we wanted our supporters to hear the film’s message and to show our donors how seamlessly we all work together,” she said."
