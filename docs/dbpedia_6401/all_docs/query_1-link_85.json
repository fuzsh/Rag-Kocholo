        "text": "This September, fear takes root across the Marvel Universe in MARVEL ZOMBIES: DAWN OF DECAY!\n\nWritten by TV and comic writer Tom Krajewski (DC’s Primer) in his Marvel Comics debut and drawn by acclaimed artist Jason Muhr (SPIDER-MAN 2099), the four-issue limited series will deliver a horror super hero saga just in time for the Halloween season. Perfect for all readers, MARVEL ZOMBIES: DAWN OF DECAY is an exciting new take on Marvel Zombies storytelling that kicks off when Groot of the Guardians of the Galaxy accidentally unleashes a terrifying alien virus, turning Earth’s Mightiest Heroes and other Marvel icons into plant-based zombies!\n\nToday, fans can see all five covers of the debut issue, including a HOUSE OF X #1 homage cover by Annie Wu and a special Saturday Morning connecting cover by Sean Galloway, as well as never-before-seen interior artwork. The preview pages show the fateful sneeze that sets everything in motion, Captain America and Black Widow being infected, and Bruce Banner alongside Groot as they set out to survive a world overgrown with terror!\n\nA new zombie virus is unleashed… and Groot is patient zero! Groot feels bad—not only because Rocket's latest scheme put them firmly in the crosshairs of the Avengers, but also he's just plain sick! Sap-dripping nose and all. Things go from bad to apocalyptic, however, after an ill-timed sneeze in Captain America's face has unforeseeable consequences!\n\nSuddenly, Groot is being attacked by a horde of zombified Avengers, and only he and Hulk, with his impenetrable green skin, remain impervious. Now it's up to these two heroes to team up and fight their way through a blighted New York City to Banner's lab in Avengers Tower to find a cure before it's too late. But can Groot keep the hero in check and on track, or will Hulk unleash his deadly might on the zombies they once called friends?\n\nMARVEL ZOMBIES: DAWN OF DECAY #1 (OF 4)\n\nWritten by THOMAS KRAJEWSKI\n\nArt and Cover by JASON MUHR\n\nVariant Cover by NICK BRADSHAW\n\nVariant Cover by RON LIM\n\nHomage Variant Cover by ANNIE WU\n\nSaturday Morning Connecting Variant Cover by SEAN GALLOWAY\n\nOn Sale 9/4\n\nCheck out all the covers along with the preview and preorder MARVEL ZOMBIES: DAWN OF DECAY #1 at your local comic shop today!\n\nGrab these comics and more at your local comic book shop!
