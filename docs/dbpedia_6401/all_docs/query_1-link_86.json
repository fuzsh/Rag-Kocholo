        "text": "Karachista is more than a fashion or lifestyle page. It is a deliberate effort to show the brighter side of life in Karachi and Pakistan.\n\nThe international media only notices Pakistan when there is sensational negative news. But then look at any local newspaper, and it’s mostly doom and gloom. I love providing a counterpoint, talking about food, travel, fashion, home interiors and all the ways people make their lives beautiful. It is about reminding people, at home and abroad, that we are just like everyone else. Many have told me that my page shows them that “Karachi ke halaat” are not as bad as they seem. Karachista also helps the diaspora reconnect with life in Karachi, which is a privilege.\n\nFour times a week, my evenings start with a workout with Naseer Khan. He has been training my husband and I for three years, with a mix of strength training and cardio. When we started, I had the muscle strength of a cooked noodle: press-ups against the wall, complaining about two-kilogramme weights. Now, I can do full press-ups and bench press a decent weight, and many of the aches and pains I thought were age-related have simply melted away, Alhamdulillah.\n\nSpeaking of gratitude and taqwa, prayer is a constant in my day. It has been since childhood, although I used to miss prayers sometimes. About 10 years ago, I read that doing something for 66 days makes it a habit. I wanted to be more consistent with my prayers, so I made that my challenge and it became a daily habit. Prayer anchors me, and going to the jamatkhana regularly and giving back to my community is a big part of that. I love that my community is all about volunteering and uplifting society.\n\nDinner is generally a family affair, though hubby and I are lucky to have a fab circle of friends we meet up with regularly. After dinner, it’s our time to unwind – we binge watch shows we both love. If he’s out, I might dive into a K-drama, but I am more likely to be found with my nose in a book. Despite my day sounding like a marathon, I always carve out time to read. I usually have a couple of books on the go, and getting lost in a good story is my ultimate way to relax and recharge."
