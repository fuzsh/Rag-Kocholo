30 Oct â€“ After missing the birth of his daughter Emma back in 2011 due to a flight delay, Ronald Cheng recently said that he is determined not to miss the birth of his second child.

According to Mingpao News, the actor, who attended the production commencement ceremony for his new movie "House of Wolves" on 29 October, stated that he will halt all his work after November to prepare for the birth.

"I have bought a new camcorder to record the moments of the baby's arrival, and I will make sure I get to cut the umbilical cord this time around," said Ronald.

The actor also admitted he originally planned to bring his daughter into the delivery room, but had to cancel due to hospital policy.

Asked if he would have another baby after the birth of his second child, Ronald joked, "I will let nature takes its course. One daughter is already too noisy, and another one is on the way. I will not deliberately try for another."
