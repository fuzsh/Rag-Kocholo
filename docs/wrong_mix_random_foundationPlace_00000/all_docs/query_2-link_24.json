        "meta_description": "Precision medicine is part of the logical evolution of contemporary evidence-based medicine that seeks to reduce errors and optimize outcomes when making medical decisions and health recommendations. Diabetes affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, many of whom will develop life-threatening complications and die prematurely. Precision medicine can potentially address this enormous problem by accounting for heterogeneity in the etiology, clinical presentation and pathogenesis of common forms of diabetes and risks of complications. This second international consensus report on precision diabetes medicine summarizes the findings from a systematic evidence review across the key pillars of precision medicine (prevention, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis) in four recognized forms of diabetes (monogenic, gestational, type 1, type 2). These reviews address key questions about the translation of precision medicine research into practice. Although not complete, owing to the vast literature on this topic, they revealed opportunities for the immediate or near-term clinical implementation of precision diabetes medicine; furthermore, we expose important gaps in knowledge, focusing on the need to obtain new clinically relevant evidence. Gaps include the need for common standards for clinical readiness, including consideration of cost-effectiveness, health equity, predictive accuracy, liability and accessibility. Key milestones are outlined for the broad clinical implementation of precision diabetes medicine. A systematic review of evidence, across the key pillars of prevention, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis, outlines milestones that need to be met to enable the broad clinical implementation of precision medicine in diabetes care.",

        "text": "The following summarizes the results and synthesis reported in the supporting series of systematic evidence reviews from the PMDI consortium for the second consensus report3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16.\n\nMDM\n\nMDM results from a mutation in a single gene20. It can be diagnosed in the neonatal period (neonatal diabetes) or typically, but not exclusively, before the age of 45 years. MDM diagnosed outside the neonatal period has historically been known as maturity-onset diabetes of the young. There are autosomal dominant, recessive and maternally inherited forms as well as varieties that arise from de novo mutations and chromosome abnormalities20. Although MDM is rare, collectively it accounts for up to 5% of diabetes and presents opportunities for precision medicine20. Despite the clinical benefits of making a diagnosis of MDM, many patients are misdiagnosed with T1D or T2D owing to overlapping clinical features.\n\nPrecision diagnosis\n\nWe systematically reviewed the evidence underpinning two priority questions for precision diagnosis of MDM7: (1) who should be tested, and (2) how should they be tested? Our eligible literature review included 98 studies among pediatric or adult populations of testing criteria and 32 studies of testing methods among individuals with suspected neonatal diabetes mellitus or MDM.\n\nBased on our evidence synthesis, the data support precision diagnostics testing for (1) neonatal diabetes in all infants aged <1 year diagnosed with diabetes, (2) MDM in individuals aged <30 years without obesity who are islet cell autoantibody-negative with detectable C-peptide, (3) GCK-related hyperglycemia in women with GDM without overweight or obesity and fasting glucose >5.5 mmol l−1 and (4) GCK-related hyperglycemia in young individuals without obesity with persistent mild fasting hyperglycemia regardless of family history. Ethnic-specific body mass index (BMI) thresholds should be used to determine overweight and obesity.\n\nTesting modalities include the use of (1) targeted next-generation sequencing for neonatal diabetes and MDM, (2) targeted genetic panels with all known causes of MDM, including mitochondrial diabetes, detection of known noncoding mutations, and copy-number variants, (3) a comprehensive panel that includes all recessively inherited genes, particularly in populations with high rates of consanguinity, (4) a separate multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay for copy-number variants detection or genotyping assay (such as pyrosequencing) for detection of m.3243A>G, (5) a methylation-based assay, such as methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for neonatal diabetes testing, since 6q24 imprinting defects are a common cause of transient neonatal diabetes mellitus, and (6) rapid Sanger sequencing of GCK in suspected GCK-related hyperglycemia, and the KCNJ11, ABCC8 and INS genes in suspected neonatal diabetes.\n\nAdditional considerations for causality, penetrance, reporting, disparities in testing access and barriers to genetic testing and follow-up of causal variant reporting were qualitatively reviewed. We noted a critical gap across the literature addressing access to genetic testing for MDM to mitigate health disparities, including concerns with replication and external validation in non-European ancestry populations. There was inconsistent measurement of islet autoantibodies and C-peptide diabetes diagnosis under the age of 45 years with ancestry-appropriate T1D genetic risk score data. We encourage the development of guidelines tailored to additional MDM types and genes, de-identified case-sharing platforms to gather the evidence to evaluate pathogenicity and deep mutational scanning maps of MDM genes for variant classification. The clinical guidance for genetic counseling, subsequent referrals and family testing, as well as research on the outcomes of implementation will also be essential to maximize precision diagnostic approaches for monogenic forms of diabetes.\n\nPrecision treatment\n\nPrecision treatment of MDM is potentially optimized by characterizing an individual’s molecular genetic subtype and pathophysiology; thus, we reviewed the evidence for comparative effectiveness of therapies among populations with specific monogenic subtypes of β-cell diabetes and severe insulin resistance6.\n\nMost diabetes that occurs at ages <6 months is monogenic neonatal diabetes. Sulfonylureas were recently established as the most effective treatment for neonatal diabetes due to a potassium channel mutation21. Our systematic review for the effects of noninsulin treatments included 19 studies in individuals with 6q24-related transient neonatal diabetes4; all studies graded as having moderate or serious risk of bias. In some, but not all, studies, sulfonylurea use during the neonatal period improved diabetes outcomes, allowing cessation of insulin, and was well tolerated. Evidence for the efficacy of a variety of noninsulin therapies was more consistent later in life during a relapse phase. We reviewed 32 studies in individuals with SLC19A2-related neonatal diabetes, also known as thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia, all with moderate or serious risk of bias. Most studies described some potential benefits of thiamine, such as reduction or cessation of insulin use and/or improved glycemic control, with no reports of adverse effects. We concluded that the current evidence is low quality for clinical guidance on use of noninsulin therapy with 6q24-related diabetes or thiamine in thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anemia.\n\nWe evaluated the effects of therapies for HNF1A diabetes, HNF4A diabetes and GCK-related hyperglycemia reported in 34 studies, including four randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Sulfonylureas are effective specifically in HNF1A diabetes for glycemic control, more so than in individuals with T2D. For HNF1A and HNF4A diabetes, transitioning from insulin or other noninsulin therapies to sulfonylureas may improve glycemic control. Some experimental studies demonstrate glinides and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) may be alternatives to sulfonylureas for HNF1A diabetes, as well as dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors as augmentative therapy. For GCK-related hyperglycemia, published case series indicate that treatment should not be given and can be discontinued.\n\nMonogenic disorders of severe insulin resistance include generalized lipodystrophy caused by mutations in AGPAT2 and BSCL2, partial lipodystrophy with mutations in LMNA and PPARG, and pathogenic variants in the INSR gene. Safety and efficacy of recombinant human leptin (metreleptin) and thiazolidinediones were analyzed in populations with lipodystrophy syndromes and recombinant insulin-like growth factor-1 in INSR mutation carriers. Of 43 nonrandomized experiments and cause series included for review, most individuals had partial lipodystrophy, some had generalized lipodystrophy and few carried INSR mutations. This evidence had moderate or serious risk of bias. Response to metreleptin was described in subgroups with familial partial lipodystrophy and congenital generalized lipodystrophy, where treatment was related to lower triglycerides in aggregated lipodystrophy, partial lipodystrophy and generalized lipodystrophy, as well as those with LMNA, PPARG, AGPAT2 or BSCL2 mutations. HbA1c levels decreased in all but AGPAT2. Thiazolidinediones lowered triglycerides and HbA1c levels in aggregated lipodystrophy, and triglycerides in LMNA but not PPARG. Response to insulin-like growth factor-1, alone or in combination with IGFBP3, lowered HbA1c levels. There were very few adverse events reported for any therapies, possibly due to small samples sizes and underreporting.\n\nPrecision prognosis\n\nWe reviewed evidence describing the incidence and severity of diabetes-related microvascular and macrovascular complications in populations with permanent neonatal diabetes due to pathogenic variants in KCNJ11 and ABCC8, and MDM due to pathogenic variants in HNF1A, HNF4A and GCK6. Extra-pancreatic complications (for example, hepatic adenomas in HNF1A diabetes, developmental delay, epilepsy and neonatal diabetes syndrome) were beyond the scope of the review.\n\nIndividuals with most forms of MDM are at high risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications, impacted by poor glycemic control. Many studies focused on younger populations diagnosed with neonatal diabetes, where rates of severe microvascular complications were low. Their risk may be in part mitigated by improved glycemic control in neonatal diabetes related to pathogenic variants in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes and HNF1A diabetes and HNF4A diabetes, where precision therapy with sulfonylureas is available. Additional long-term follow-up studies will be important to understand the natural progression of microvascular and macrovascular complications in permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus from mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8.\n\nFrom 78 articles, retinopathy and microalbuminuria were reported in cases with neonatal diabetes mellitus, but progressive retinopathy and severe renal disease were uncommon. Populations with isolated GCK-related hyperglycemia have overall very low rates of diabetes-related complications. Indeed, microvascular complications were very rare in cohort studies of populations with GCK-related hyperglycemia and prolonged disease duration (>50 years).\n\nRecent studies of HNF1A diabetes reported lower rates of complications compared to those published earlier (for example, for retinopathy, 17% in recent versus 47% earlier; for cardiovascular disease (CVD), 7% in recent years versus 16% earlier). In recent studies, rates of microangiopathic complications observed were less than in T1D, although rates were similar or higher among these populations in older studies. More recent studies of patients with HNF1A diabetes and HNF4A diabetes show improved prognosis of diabetes microvascular and macrovascular complications, likely reflecting an earlier molecular diagnosis, tighter treatment targets and higher rates of precision therapy.\n\nGDM\n\nGDM is abnormal glucose tolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. GDM is the most common metabolic complication of pregnancy. Unlike most other forms of diabetes, the onset of GDM is rapid and typically resolves after delivery. Nevertheless, the short- and long-term health risks that GDM poses to the mother and offspring can be substantial, underscoring the importance of widely available screening, diagnosis and effective treatment.\n\nPrecision prevention\n\nWe systematically reviewed results of 116 interventions on GDM prevention, including diet and/or exercise (diet n = 16; exercise n = 17; diet and exercise combined n = 59), metformin (n = 13) and supplements such as myoinositol/inositol, probiotics and fish oil (n = 12)9. We considered interventions initiated in the preconception or antenatal period and reporting GDM among its outcomes for prevention efficacy.\n\nIn our meta-analyses, lifestyle interventions led to lower incidence of GDM compared with control care: diet only by 25%, exercise only by 31%, and combined diet and exercise by 18% (moderate-to-low-quality evidence). Metformin reduced GDM by 34%, and myoinositol/inositol supplements by 61%; however, this evidence was rated very low quality. Only seven trials initiated interventions in the preconception period. Metformin interventions implemented in the preconception period had better GDM risk reduction when compared to those initiated during pregnancy. For exercise-only interventions, greater risk reduction for GDM was seen in studies enrolling women with a BMI in the normal range. Combined diet and exercise interventions were more effective in GDM reduction among women with overweight or obesity, without polycystic ovary syndrome, without history of prior GDM and with advanced maternal age at pregnancy. Metformin was relatively more effective in preventing GDM among women with a history of polycystic ovary syndrome, with older maternal age and with higher fasting blood glucose at enrollment. Parity, education and employment status, race and history of having a large for gestational age infant did not appreciably impact the effectiveness of interventions. These findings came primarily from comparing effect estimates across trials with different participant characteristics rather than from within-study analyses stratified by participant characteristics. Overall, the strength of evidence for GDM risk reduction with the use of lifestyle modification, metformin and myoinositol/inositol is moderate to very low. Moreover, few data were available to determine which individual characteristics might predict who would benefit most from a given type of intervention.\n\nFuture research should include interventions in early pregnancy with sufficient sample size to assess GDM as a primary outcome as well as to provide results stratified by pertinent participant characteristics, including social and environmental factors, clinical traits and other novel risk factors to predict the effectiveness of GDM prevention programs.\n\nPrecision diagnosis\n\nThe overarching goal of the GDM precision diagnosis working group was to review evidence of precision markers beyond glycemic level (that is, information about a person’s pathophysiology, environment and/or context) that might help refine the diagnosis of GDM. Through the lens of clinical translation, we investigated the evidence supporting GDM subtypes and etiologic or pathologic heterogeneity, as well as associations with adverse perinatal outcomes14. The systematic review and meta-analysis focused on observational studies evaluating maternal and fetal anthropometry, clinical and sociocultural/environmental risk factors, genetics, omics and nonglycemic biomarkers that could identify subgroups of individuals with diagnosed GDM at differentially higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Of 137 studies included, 68 studies evaluated maternal anthropometry as a potential modifier or precision marker related to pregnancy outcomes. The meta-analysis among a subset of studies reporting on maternal BMI in relation to risk for neonatal large for gestational age and/or macrosomia. Forty-nine studies evaluated maternal clinical or sociocultural factors, and 30 studies evaluated nonglycemic biomarkers, lipids and insulin sensitivity/secretion indices. Few studies incorporated fetal anthropometry (11 studies), risk-prediction models with multiple variables (six studies) or genetics/genomics and other omics (five studies).\n\nAnthropometry measures were the most analyzed risk factor with outcomes among pregnancies complicated by GDM. Meta-analyses demonstrated that women with GDM and overweight/obesity have two to three higher risk for neonatal macrosomia or neonatal large for gestational age. Larger birth size is the leading risk factor for birth trauma (shoulder dystocia) and emergency C-section. Regarding nonglycemic biochemical markers (n = 33 studies), lipids and insulin resistance or secretion indices were the most studied, with elevated maternal triglycerides and insulin resistance generally associated with greater risk of neonatal large for gestational age and macrosomia; study findings were inconsistent. Studies reporting on genetics and omics were scarce. Few studies described risk-prediction models with multiple variables. Traditional GDM risk factors, such as advanced maternal age, parity, prior history of GDM or family history of diabetes, were not consistent markers of adverse perinatal outcomes in women with GDM. There was sparse evidence to support conclusions for the role of race, ethnicity or country of origin as precision markers, given high heterogeneity across studies, and that data interpretation is dependent on sociocultural context. Very few studies investigated diet, physical activity or psychological health as precision markers for diagnosis of GDM.\n\nFor most of the precision markers (other than BMI), it will be necessary to conduct validation and replication studies in adequately powered studies of people representing the diversity of target populations. For precision biomarkers, validated, standardized and affordable assays are required for broad adoption by clinical laboratories. There is a need to identify and test different clinical decision and management strategies if a precision diagnostic identifies a woman at high risk of perinatal complications. Finally, for modifiable precision markers (for example, lipid levels, insulin sensitivity), novel interventions should be developed and validated that specifically target these markers during pregnancy.\n\nPrecision treatment\n\nIt is unknown whether precision treatment of GDM could improve maternal and/or offspring outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of evidence for precision markers of GDM treatment success to determine (1) which precision approaches in addition to standard of care can enable achievement of glucose targets with lifestyle measures alone, and (2) which characteristics predict whether glucose targets can be achieved in women treated with diet and lifestyle alone, and in women receiving oral agents10.\n\nOnly two studies reporting personalized approaches of tailoring lifestyle-based treatments in GDM met the inclusion criteria for review, with variable findings for prepregnancy BMI or excessive gestational weight gain as precision markers for intervention efficacy and implementation. For predictors of escalation with the need for pharmacological interventions, 48 studies were included, and 34 studies were included in meta-analyses. Precision markers for successful GDM management with lifestyle measures without the need for additional pharmacological therapy (insulin, metformin and/or glyburide; 34 studies) were (1) younger maternal age, (2) nulliparity, (3) lower BMI, (4) no previous history of GDM, (5) lower levels of HbA1c, fasting glucose and postchallenge glucose concentrations (at 1, 2 and 3 h), (6) no family history of diabetes, (7) later gestation of diagnosis of GDM, and (8) no previous macrosomia. Similar precision markers for successful treatment with metformin and/or glyburide without requiring supplementary insulin were found with the addition of later gestation of initiation of the oral agent (12 studies). Data were lacking to identify precision markers of responses to one agent versus another. Only two studies included genetics or omics as potential markers for treatment escalation. The studies were limited by the predominant focus on high-income settings and the small sample sizes.\n\nOverall, based on findings from moderate-to-good quality, key maternal characteristics were identified that may be used to build prediction models for pharmacological GDM treatment. Precision markers for GDM treatment are usually available from routine clinical measures; however, it is unknown whether other precision markers could be identified (for example, genetics or omics) or whether these can be implemented in clinical practice. Future studies should be appropriately powered and designed to assess individual precision markers or algorithms incorporating multiple precision markers. Validation and replication in diverse populations are lacking and are also needed.\n\nPrecision prognosis\n\nGDM incurs health risks to both a mother and her offspring, not only during pregnancy and at delivery but also over the longer term. The systematic evidence evaluation focused on studies describing predictors of postpartum and long-term cardiometabolic outcomes in women with GDM and their offspring5. The evidence synthesis focused on prognostic endpoints of T2D and CVD for women with prior GDM, as well as anthropometric features and preclinical cardiometabolic biomarkers among offspring exposed to GDM in utero. We included 89 studies of which 55 reported on maternal outcomes (52 observational, three RCTs) and 45 reported on offspring outcomes (37 observational, eight RCTs).\n\nCollectively, studies reported that women with a history of GDM are at higher risk of T2D and CVD, with a dose-dependent relationship between degree of pregnancy hyperglycemia and these outcomes. Similarly, offspring born to women with more severe GDM had more adiposity and higher risk of being overweight or of obesity across the life span. GDM severity was also associated with greater risk of incident T2D and CVD among women and with an unfavorable cardiometabolic profile in offspring later in life. Broadly, the relationships between GDM severity and the maternal/offspring outcomes were robust to adjustment for gestational week at diagnosis, offspring birth size and family-level socioeconomic status; however, failing to adjust for maternal BMI and lifestyle factors was a concerning source of bias for the relationships of GDM with offspring outcomes.\n\nSome studies considered whether the type of treatment needed to achieve glycemic targets in women with GDM is a precision marker for long-term outcomes. Treatment with insulin, but not lifestyle, had a worse prognosis for both mothers and offspring; however, this apparent effect could be due to the prescription of insulin when GDM is ‘more severe’, which may be partly due to confounding by indication. Unfavorable maternal and child outcomes associated with GDM history (exposure) were modified by lifestyle. For maternal outcomes, the primary risk mitigators were healthy diet and regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. For offspring outcomes, the offspring’s diet and physical activity modified cardiometabolic risk. Greater exclusivity and longer duration of breastfeeding attenuated cardiometabolic risk among GDM-exposed offspring, although this literature was less robust than that for reduction of the risk for T2D in breastfeeding women with prior GDM. There is presently very limited evidence about the role of omics biomarkers and polygenic scores (for T2D or CVD) in women with prior GDM.\n\nDespite the above insights, studies regarding GDM prognostic factors indicative of future maternal and offspring cardiometabolic health are generally low quality. Most current literature describes retrospective studies leveraging registry data and observational cohort studies; inferring causal relationships from these data about prognostic factors is hampered by risk of confounding and reverse causation (attributable, for example, to preexisting conditions and other pregnancy characteristics).\n\nT1D\n\nT1D results from autoimmune-induced destruction of the pancreatic β-cells, requiring insulin treatment for survival. While representing ~2% of all forms of diabetes worldwide1, T1D has a large healthcare cost owing to the early age at onset for many affected, the high cost of insulin and related technologies (insulin infusion pumps, continuous glucose monitors (CGM), hybrid closed loop systems) and elevated risk of both microvascular and macrovascular complications. Growing insights into the pathogenesis of T1D motivated the classification of the disease in different stages, with stage 0 being presence of 1 autoantibody in people at high genetic risk, stage 1 and 2 being the presence of two or more islet autoantibodies in normo- (stage 1) or dysglycemia (stage 2) and clinical diabetes (stage 3). Etiologic heterogeneity is recognized in both children and adults.\n\nPrecision prevention\n\nA key question in T1D is whether individual characteristics or biomarkers can be used to identify those most likely to respond to disease-modifying therapy before clinical T1D onset (stage 3). We conducted a systematic review of RCTs focused on the identification of features associated with treatment response published over the past 25 years13. Multiple trials were identified that compared disease-modifying agents, mostly immunotherapies, to placebo. A formal meta-analysis was not conducted given the heterogeneity of interventions and approaches. Of 75 manuscripts extracted for review, 15 described prevention trials with the remainder focused on treatment in the recent- or stage 3-onset period.\n\nPrevention trials generally enrolled individuals at elevated genetic risk, typically based on the presence of a first-degree relative with T1D and/or with islet autoimmunity, with or without changes in β-cell function (stages 0 to 3). Studies commonly used time-to-diabetes as an outcome. Stage 3 studies used more consistent eligibility criteria and frequently tested C-peptide area under the curve as a primary outcome. Fifty-seven studies, including primary trials and longitudinal follow-up of trials, performed precision analyses, specifically testing features associated with treatment response. Analyses tested the associations of many features with treatment response, most commonly age, measures of β-cell function and/or an immune phenotype.\n\nOverall, the RCTs received high-quality ratings and were graded to have a low risk of bias; however, precision prevention analyses had lower quality rankings. Reasons for this were that studies typically did not prespecify an analytic plan, had inconsistent reporting of key methodologic details (for example, sample size or a correction for multiple comparisons) and tended to report only positive (that is, statistically significant) findings. There is large interest in precision features associated with treatment response to disease-modifying therapy in T1D; however, most analyses were exploratory without follow-up with prespecified prospective analyses.\n\nWe recommend that future studies are powered to undertake multiple prespecified analyses to permit statistically robust testing of features associated with treatment response (for example, through stratified effects or biomarker–treatment interactions). These data will be required for the effective identification and implementation of precision approaches to disease-modifying therapies.\n\nPrecision diagnosis\n\nIslet autoantibodies are validated predictors of disease progression and are being incorporated into clinical practice. We focused this systematic evidence review13 on determining whether autoantibodies help stratify subgroups across four settings: (1) disease progression before stage 3 diagnosis, (2) disease presentation/stage 3 diagnosis, (3) disease progression after stage 3 diagnosis and (4) response to disease-modifying interventions.\n\nWe identified 151 publications, 90 relevant to progression before stage 3, 44 for heterogeneity at stage 3, 11 for progression after stage 3 and 13 for interventions. While insulin autoantibodies are commonly the first to appear before diagnosis in younger children, the presence of IA-2 autoantibodies corresponds with faster disease progression. Interactions between high-risk HLA alleles (for example, HLA-DRB1*03:01 and HLA-DRB1*04:01), the number and types of islet autoantibodies, and age at seroconversion are most often used in models (or added to existing models) to predict disease. The replacement of traditional radio-binding assays with electrochemiluminescent assays improved the sensitivity of some autoantibody testing and identified high-risk subgroups (individuals with two or more autoantibodies) who were previously low risk (positive for a single autoantibody).\n\nAt stage 3 diagnosis, the presence of specific autoantibodies correlated with age, suggesting that the inciting antigens are different in younger, compared to older, individuals. The primary antibodies at seroconversion often disappeared at the time of stage 3 diagnosis. There was weak evidence that declining islet autoantibody titers and the number of autoantibodies after stage 3 diagnosis corresponded to preserved residual C-peptide level, thereby not supporting the use of islet autoantibodies to define heterogeneity in metabolic outcomes. Evidence of islet autoantibody features to predict response to disease-modifying therapies was modest, making the impact of a specific antigen (and its corresponding autoantibody) less significant. For clinical implementation, the grade of evidence is limited by the reports (1) being mainly from European ancestry populations, (2) rarely correcting analyses for multiple comparisons, (3) consisting of observational measurements from RCTs limited to observational endpoints and (4) inconsistently reporting on assay methods and validation.\n\nThese results suggest that islet autoantibodies are useful to define heterogeneity in T1D before stage 3 diagnosis, and that benefit will be gained by incorporating age and genetics into risk scores. Thoughtfully designed, prospective trials are needed to apply these observations and develop precision medicine approaches to diagnosis and treatment. In a corresponding paper13, a methods checklist is proposed to ensure reproducibility and applicability of islet autoantibody-based research.\n\nPrecision treatment\n\nTreatment of clinical, stage 3 T1D includes insulin therapy, adjunctive agents, nutrition, exercise, behavioral health, glycemic targets and transitions of care; however, in the last decade, the major development for people living with T1D has been in technology. This systematic evidence review focused on whether diabetes management technologies impact clinically relevant outcomes, based on differences between subpopulations11.\n\nA systematic review of 71 peer-reviewed RCTs and related secondary/extension studies with at least 50 participants from the past 10 years concluded that novel technologies (ranging from isolated CGM, decision-support tools, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps, to advanced hybrid closed loop systems) have resulted in lower HbA1c levels, increased CGM-defined time-in-range glucose between 70–180 mg dl−1, reduced hypoglycemia risk and improved person-reported outcomes. The broad array of technologies permits the application of individualized treatment plans for people living with T1D but limits cross-trial comparisons or meta-analyses. CGM use among very young children reduced the risk of hypoglycemia and lowered parental distress while having minimal impact on HbA1c level and time-in-range when compared to self-monitoring of blood glucose. Technologies that include sensor-augmented pump therapy, predictive low glucose suspend pumps and automated insulin-delivery systems improved hypoglycemia, time-in-range and HbA1c levels across all age groups. Age of the individual should be considered in clinical decisions related to technology use. Variation in baseline glycemic status (for example, suboptimal versus targeted HbA1c level) did not consistently impact these outcomes.\n\nImportant limitations of published trials were identified. There is limited availability of preplanned or well-powered analyses in subgroups (for example, children, older adults or people with advanced complications). While the quality of evaluated RCTs is high with a low risk of bias, high-quality data related to these subpopulations is needed, and results are considered exploratory until appropriately powered studies are conducted and findings are adjusted for multiple comparisons. Confounding variables, including (1) access to technologies, (2) education with device initiation, (3) concomitant behavioral modifications and (4) frequent contact with the healthcare team are rarely described in enough detail to assess their impact.\n\nPrecision prognosis\n\nThe landmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial demonstrated that intensive glucose control effectively prevents microvascular complications in individuals with uncomplicated and recent-onset T1D (<5 years), as well as those with more than 5 years since diagnosis and mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy22,23. However, glucose control accounts for only 50% of T1D complication risk24,25,26,27. Moreover, certain subgroups, including the elderly, young children and people with hypoglycemia unawareness or autonomic neuropathy, may be harmed from severe hypoglycemia resulting from tight glucose control28. This highlights the importance of identifying additional nonglycemic interventions to mitigate complication risk for all people living with T1D.\n\nEpidemiological studies have identified additional (epi-)genetic, biological and phenotypic traits in people with T1D at higher risk for kidney, eye and neurological complications and a worse prognosis. Presence of risk factors traditionally associated with CVD and T2D such as overweight, dyslipidemia, hypertension and smoking also contribute to the development of advanced stages of kidney disease, peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy and CVD in T1D25,29,30,31. Although cholesterol and blood pressure levels outside of current clinical targets increase complication risk in T1D32,33, T1D-specific recommendations are lacking.\n\nRecent evidence has identified distinct changes in lipid and amino acid metabolism that predict earlier, more rapid kidney function decline in T1D34. Additionally, socioeconomic and psychological factors play a role in microvascular complications35,36,37,38. Although evidence from RCTs is absent, blood pressure control with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition and the use of statins for hyperlipidemia are promising therapies against progression to hard endpoints (for example, end-stage renal disease or CVD); however, there is a scarcity of evidence that precision medicine alters prognosis in T1D.\n\nA rare example of precision prognosis in T1D relates to the haptoglobin (HP) genotype. In the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study, coronary artery disease (CAD) risk was comparable between the intensive and conventional therapy groups with the HP 2-2 genotype39. CAD risk was greatly reduced with intensive therapy in noncarriers of HP 2-2. Similarly, although better glycemic control was associated with lower CAD incidence in the EDC study, a residual risk related to HP 2-2 was observed39,40.\n\nAfter the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, there has been little evidence from RCTs for evaluating the impact of tight glycemic control in specific subgroups with respect to complications; however, clinical precision medicine is utilized in the prognosis and choice of therapy for people with T1D. More sophisticated decision tools, based on deeper genetic and phenotypic profiling in multi-ethnic cohorts are needed to improve personalized prognosis in T1D.\n\nT2D\n\nApproximately 500 million people worldwide are estimated to have T2D41, which is predicted to rise to 1.3 billion by 2050 (ref. 42). A diagnosis of T2D is one of exclusion, occurring when other plausible explanations for chronically elevated blood glucose have been considered and dismissed. This high degree of uncertainty and potential heterogeneity presents major challenges for the prevention and treatment of T2D.\n\nPrecision prevention\n\nLarge-scale RCTs demonstrate that dietary or lifestyle interventions can delay the progression to T2D. However, there is large interindividual variability in response to preventive interventions43. Identifying predictors of response to interventions and the characteristics of people who would be most likely to benefit remain high priorities and are key focus areas for precision prevention in T2D15. This systematic review identified 33 trials focused on lifestyle interventions (n = 24 studies), dietary modification (n = 4 studies) and dietary supplementation (n = 5 studies). From the 33 trials, there were 80 post hoc stratified analyses based on demographic, clinical, social or molecular factors.\n\nSociodemographic characteristics such as age, sex, race/ethnicity or socioeconomic status were not found to significantly affect response to intervention. We found evidence, albeit of low quality, that individuals with poorer health status at baseline, in particular prediabetes, tend to benefit more from lifestyle and dietary interventions than healthier individuals. Studies that stratified on body size at baseline reported inconsistent observations, with some showing that those with a lower BMI benefited more from intervention, whereas other studies found no difference according to body size. There was suggestive evidence that individuals who smoke and those with lower levels of physical activity at baseline benefited less from a lifestyle program, whereas no such interactions were reported for dietary or supplement interventions. There was little evidence that genetic factors or biomarkers attenuated or exacerbated the effects of these interventions.\n\nAlthough our systematic review included intervention studies, most of which were RCTs with low risk of confounding, we evaluated certainty of post hoc stratification analyses. This suggested that statistical power was often limited. Further, most did not adjust for individual-level risk factors.\n\nAlthough T2D can be prevented or delayed in tightly controlled clinical trials, adherence to lifestyle or diet modifications in real-world settings is often suboptimal. Thus, to maximize success of precision prevention interventions it will be important to incorporate methods tailored to the individual that enhance adherence.\n\nPrecision diagnosis\n\nIn this systematic review8, evidence was assessed for optimization of T2D diagnosis through subclassification using (1) approaches involving ‘simple’ categorization of clinical characteristics such as biomarkers, imaging or other routinely available parameters and (2) ‘complex’ approaches involving machine learning applied to omic and genomic data.\n\nCurrent data on the clinical value of T2D subclassification come predominantly from populations of European ancestry. Though glycemic measures are used to diagnose T2D, several nonglycemic measures were consistently applied to subclassify disease, including BMI, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, C-peptide and lipid profiles.\n\nSimple T2D subclassification approaches focused on data including pancreatic autoantibodies, BMI, measures related to pancreatic β-cell function, age at diagnosis, lipid profiles, oral glucose tolerance test measures and cardiovascular features. The study designs, specific cutoffs and outcomes were heterogeneous, with no study replicated or meeting high Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) quality.\n\nComplex approaches yielded some reproducible subtypes of T2D. The most frequently replicated subtypes were the clusters first described by Ahlqvist et al.44, which were replicated in 22 studies, including people of diverse ancestries. These studies used k-means clustering applied to exposures assessed close to diabetes diagnosis: age, HbA1c, BMI, homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function, homeostatic model assessment (2) of insulin resistance and GAD-65 antibody. The four nonautoimmune diabetes subtypes described were severe insulin-deficient diabetes, severe insulin-resistant diabetes, mild obesity-related diabetes and mild age-related diabetes. Associations of these subtypes with clinical outcomes, including glycaemia, microvascular and macrovascular outcomes and death, were replicated in 12 studies. There was also replication of genetic subtypes of T2D from Udler et al.45, with associations with clinical features seen in multiple cohorts of European ancestry.\n\nSubclassification strategies for T2D have been associated with meaningful clinical outcomes. However, evidence supporting the clinical application of these subclassification approaches is of moderate quality at best. Further ancestry-inclusive and high-quality evidence is needed. In contrast to simple approaches, the clinical application of machine-learning-derived approaches may require real-time computation of subphenotype classification of an individual with T2D, and necessary computing resources may be unavailable in some settings.\n\nPrecision treatment\n\nThis systematic evidence review3 focused on two of the most recently introduced antihyperglycemic drug classes, SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and GLP1-RAs. These drugs have been shown in RCTs to not only reduce glycemia but also to lower the risk of renal and CVD outcomes among high-risk individuals with T2D. Other therapeutics were not included in this evaluation owing to the complexity and volume of this literature.\n\nThe population of those with T2D is heterogenous in its demographics, clinical features and prognosis; thus, there may be differences in response to one or both of these drug classes. A systematic review was conducted to identify individual-level demographic, clinical or biological biomarkers associated with heterogeneous glycemia, CVD and renal outcome in individuals with T2D treated with SLGT2i or GLP1-RA.\n\nFor SGLT2i, 339 full-text articles were screened, which yielded 101 studies for evaluation; for GLP1-RA, 161 full-text articles were screened, yielding 75 studies for evaluation. These studies predominantly represent secondary analyses of industry-funded, placebo-controlled trials, or meta-analyses of these trials, with a few observational studies. The most common stratification variables were demographics, baseline HbA1c, obesity and preexisting CVD or nephropathy.\n\nOverall, limited evidence was found for robust modification of the effects of GLP1-RA or SGLT2i on glycemia, renal or CVD outcomes by these features. For SGLT2i, reduced baseline renal function was associated with lesser glycemic response, while a higher baseline HbA1c level was associated with greater glycemic response. For GLP1-RA, a lower β-cell function was associated with a lesser glycemic response. Generally, the strength of evidence was modest, largely reflecting a lack of studies designed and sufficiently powered to address the question of treatment effect heterogeneity.\n\nPrecision prognosis\n\nThis systematic review included a meta-analysis16 to combine evidence from longitudinal studies of individuals with T2D for markers predicting CVD and evaluated their predictive utility beyond current practice. After full-text review, 416 studies were analyzed with 77% focusing on nongenetic biomarkers, 12% on genetic biomarkers and 11% on risk scores.\n\nThere were 195 novel nongenetic biomarkers for CVD, of which 134 (69%) had a net positive number of studies showing a significant adjusted association. Of these, 12 biomarkers showed improvement in c-statistic, net reclassification index or integrated discrimination index consistently in more than one study. Considering the results of our pooled meta-analyses, nonpooled analyses, evidence for improved prediction performance indicators and risk of bias, we found high predictive utility for N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (high evidence), troponin T and triglyceride-glucose (moderate evidence), moderate predictive utility for coronary computed tomography angiography and single-photon emission computed tomography (low evidence) and pulse wave velocity (moderate evidence), and low predictive utility for C-reactive protein (moderate evidence), coronary artery calcium score, galectin-3 (Gal-3), troponin I, carotid plaque and growth differentiation factor-15 (low evidence).\n\nAmong the 48 genetics studies, 79 genetic biomarkers were evaluated for CVD outcomes, 29 having a net positive number of studies with a significant association. Three genetic biomarkers demonstrated promise: rs10911021 in GLUL, genetic risk score (GRS) for CAD and isoform e4 in APOE. Only the GRS for CAD showed improvement in all three performance indicators in a single study. A few studies employed different GRSs using up to 204 variants from 160 distinct loci derived from the general population that were externally validated, demonstrating improvements in CVD risk reclassification and significant enhancements in discrimination indices. Most studies, however, were conducted in European ancestry populations, with a few of Asian ancestry and very little or no representation of most other ethnicities. Some studies report a relative integrated discrimination index >6%, suggesting adequate predictive utility for the GRS for CAD, but this will need to be confirmed in appropriately designed ad hoc trials, to confirm clinical utility and transferability to other ancestries.\n\nRisk scores showed overall modest discrimination, and model performance tended to decline when validated in countries that differed from the derivation cohort. Most studies focused on baseline characteristics and did not account for time-varying factors that may modify CVD risk, such as medications.\n\nIn summary, the highest predictive utility was found for N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide, troponin T, triglyceride-glucose and GRS for CAD, with NT-proBNP having the highest level of evidence. Prospective studies evaluating prognostic biomarkers and risk scores as clinical decision-support tools in T2D are scarce, as is information on their cost-effectiveness. Our findings illustrate the need for development and validation of prognostic markers for CVD in diverse populations of people with T2D to promote equity in precision diabetes care."
