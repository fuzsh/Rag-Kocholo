I retired in January 1973 from Treasure Island as Command Career Counselor. I reported Aboard the Kennebec as a BTCS and in 1968 made E-9. Some of my best duty (in spite of the West Pac tours) was Aboard the Kennebec. Like some others have said, we had a good crew with good morale though I may not have contributed to the morale factor. I was a task-master and pretty hard on some of my crew. The most displeasing task was having to keep the boiler crew from liberty in order to clean boilers. After retiring from the navy, a second career was in the insurance business. First as a safety engineer, then as a broker. I again retired in 1996. I am currently keeping busy with community volunteer work, golfing, traveling, etc., in that order. Looking forward to this years reunion and having an opportunity to reconnect with shipmates.

From nephew, Jonathan, \"Excellent web site! You probably already know this, but My Uncle, Noah Willie RIBA died 16 Dec 1980 in El Cajon, CA. I do not know if you keep track of these things. I know that he also served on the USS Idaho. The last time I talked with him, he told me that he was at Pearl Harbor and his ship was out on maneuvers the morning of the attack. The captain could see what was happening and hid the ship behind an island until the attack was over. I do not know the name of the ship and out of respect for his Captain, Uncle Noah did not talk about this incident until after his Captain had died. He did talk about surviving on a piece of a Liberty Ship that had broken in half from a torpedo attack. I do not know the name of that ship either. Also, when the USS Idaho was captured near Borneo, Uncle Noah hid under the bodies of some fallen comrades to avoid capture and fight another day. Noah and I both grew up in Stonewall, TX, a small town 13 miles east of Fredericksburg, TX, the hometown of Admiral Chester Nimetz. If you are ever there, you should visit the Nimetz Museum. I am certain that you have visited much larger and better naval museums, but for a small town museum, it will surprise you. It only shows artifacts used in the Pacific Theatre of WWII. I was really impressed with the recorded narration and lighted wall map that showed the entire Pacific War one battle at a time. It is hard to believe that we were also fighting a war in Europe while all this was happening in the Pacific. updated 05/13/02 Thomas V. Rigor, Jr., SKC: Aboard 1966. Enlisted 03/54.

The Kennebec was my first duty station after boot camp and \"A\" school. I have many nice memories of my first duty station and her crew. I retired from the Navy in September of 1988 as a Master Chief with over 27 years of service. Been happily married for over 33 years to a girl I met while on the Kennebec. We have four children and three grandchildren. We fully retired in 1997 and currently reside in Martin, SD. Looking forward to the reunion!!! After reading Navy Times for so many years, never could understand why I never saw the Kennebec listed in the reunion section. updated 05/16/01.
