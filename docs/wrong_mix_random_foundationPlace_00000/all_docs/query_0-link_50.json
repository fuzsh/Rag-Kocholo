Youngner and Robert M. Arnold\n\nThis volume explores the topic of death and dying during the fifty to sixty years spanning the late twentieth and early twenty-​first centuries, primarily in the United States. This has been a time of great change in our society. An explosion of technology radically changed the nature of medical practice and the way we die. Simultaneously, traditional structures of power were successfully challenged by rights claims—​from African Americans, women, gays, students, and, most relevant here, patients. Respecting patients’ values increasingly has been recognized as the most essential moral component of clinical decision-​making. We soon discovered that technology’s promise to save and improve life had a dark side. Too often, it only served to prolong the dying process, making death appear to many as the least worst alternative. For the first time in their history, human beings had the ability to control the timing of death in almost all instances. With this ability came a responsibility that is both awesome and inescapable. How we understand and manage this responsibility is a theme that runs through every chapter in this book. In Section I, Alan Meisel examines how the law has helped shape clinical practice, emphasizing the roles of rights and patient autonomy. He illustrates how key court cases in the second half of the past century have led to a general consensus about the legality of withholding and withdrawing life-​sustaining treatment. Meisel touches briefly on the recent legal recognition of physician-​assisted suicide in some jurisdictions in our country. Mark Aulisio then points out that many, if not most, decisions at the end of life are made when the patients are no longer capable of exercising their autonomy. This reality has spawned the notion of advance directives, whose inadequacies have led to the inevitable reliance on surrogate decision-​making—​which is itself fraught with problems. Mark Wicclair addresses the controversial issue of conscientious objection by health care professionals. What do we do when patients’ values conflict with those of health professionals? Wicclair explores the possibilities, calling for a “reasonable accommodation” approach. Section II addresses specific clinical issues. Renee Boss examines the problems that arise for families and health professionals when technological advances permit the survival of infants who are born prematurely or have severe congenital anomalies. Despite\n\n08:48:22.\n\n2 Stuart J. Youngner and Robert M. Arnold many instances of success, neonatal complications sometimes result in chronic illness, serious disability, and a shortened life span, thus posing difficult choices for families, health professionals, and the larger society. John Lantos explores the tragic situation of death and dying in children. Drawing on fiction, poetry, film, and memoir, he describes a “kindness of strangers” approach to caring for dying children and their families in tertiary care medical centers. Sigrid Sterckx and Kasper Raus explain and analyze continuous sedation as a way to relieve suffering at the end of life. They discuss the problem of terminology and definition and the complicated moral relationship between continuous sedation and the restriction of medically provided nutrition and hydration. Next, Daniel Salmasy discusses in detail the medical provision of fluids and nutrition. He discusses the technical aspects of providing this intervention, the clinical effects of its application or limitation, and the moral problems engendered by different courses of action. Alexander Smith and Paul Glare write about the problem of prognostication in patients who are thought to be dying. Despite an inevitable level of uncertainty in most cases, they highlight the importance of communicating with patients about prognosis and how prognostic information should be used. Finally, Douglas White and Thaddeus Pope address the ongoing problem of futility and medical power (a chapter that is also related to issues of surrogate decision-​making and conscientious objection). They summarize the circumstances and arguments that have been proposed to justify the limitation of life-​sustaining interventions without patient or family consent, emphasizing the value-​laden nature of most of these judgments. They then offer suggestions for how physicians might respond to requests for treatment they deem to be medically or ethically inappropriate. Section III examines psychosocial and cultural issues. Stuart Youngner and Lisa Humphrey share their personal experiences as clinicians providing care for dying patients and their families. Youngner tells his story as a psychiatrist coming of age who is trying to be more honest with dying patients and their families as they face death together. Youngner blinks and turns his career path from emotionally draining confrontations with death and dying to a more intellectual pursuit—​the consideration of the morality of limiting life-​sustaining treatment in the age of medical technology. Humphrey also tells a personal story about her training and practice as a pediatric palliative care specialist. She shares daily confrontations with tragedy and, unlike Youngner, how she successfully developed emotional coping tools. She poignantly labels one such tool as “tagging your baggage.” David Barnard and Megan Crowley-​Matoka look at our death-​denying society at a less personal level. Barnard examines how society has struggled with the death problem, attributing much of it to a manifestation of shame “induced by exposure to, or reminders of, the physical body—​its functions and disintegration—​that the processes of civilization have progressively kept out of sight and out of consciousness.” Crowley-​Matoka uses two classic ethnographies of dying in American hospitals, spaced four decades apart, as a lens to compare how key cultural features of death and dying have and have not shifted over “a particularly critical period in the history of US health care.” Next, Eric Cassell examines the problem of suffering. He argues that there are not different types\n\n08:48:22.\n\nINTRODUCTION 3 of suffering, such as physical, psychological, or existential. There is only suffering, which is something that happens to persons and not to bodies. He concludes that suffering is so pernicious because it attacks one’s integrity as a person and inevitably involves self-​ conflict. Finally, Jessica Berg explores the ethical and legal issues involved in the use of social media to make end-​of-​life decisions. After providing an overview of the various types of social media, she considers the many different ways social media might play a role as we catapult into our electronic future. In Section IV, the authors examine death and dying among various vulnerable populations. Susannah Rose and Janelle Highland consider the elderly. After an examination of the data, they observe that end-​of-​life care preferences in the elderly are varied and that we need to allow for a wide conception of autonomy and choice that is potentially very expensive. They propose a soft paternalism and a system that provides palliative care as the default choice for people with serious and chronic diseases. Anita Silvers and Leslie Francis address persons with disabilities, another vulnerable population. They consider both the intellectually and physically disabled. The problem of free choice is complex and often controversial in a group that has suffered considerable social stigmatization and discrimination. Evaluating depression and decision-​making capacity in the dying is a difficult and often contentious issue. Is depression a natural part of dying? Can and should it be treated? Are all depressed patients incapable of making decisions about their end-​of-​life care? Nathan Fairman and Scott Irwin carefully review these issues and offer suggestions to help guide decision-​making. Kimberly Johnson and Ramona Rhodes examine how race or ethnicity affects access to and the quality of palliative care by focusing on the experiences of African Americans and Hispanics. They suggest strategies for health care providers, organizations, policy-​makers, and researchers on how to improve care for these vulnerable populations. Joseph Fins explains how neuropalliative care can be provided to patients with severe, chronic brain injuries. He addresses the delicate balance between the right to die and the right to care for these unfortunate patients. Michael McCarthy and Mark Kuczewski propose an approach to care of the dying that is critical of the overemphasis on autonomy. They emphasize three aspects of care—​embodied, compassionate, and communal—​that have strong roots in the Catholic-​Christian theological tradition. Section V, on physician-​assisted death (PAD), defined here as physician-​assisted suicide (PAS) and active euthanasia (lethal injection), remains the most controversial choice in end-​of-​life-​care in the United States, despite Alan Meisel’s report in Section I that PAS is now legal in several US jurisdictions. The section begins with a description of PAD in the Netherlands, where it has been practiced, regulated, studied, modified, and eventually legalized. Even if one accepts that PAD is sometimes morally justified, it is questionable whether it can be successfully implemented in a complex political entity such as an entire modern nation. Critics say no, but Gerrrit Kimsma presents a generally optimistic view of what has happened in the Netherlands. Physicians have been at the forefront of the social acceptance of PAD in the Netherlands, and PAD is widely accepted among the public. Ira Byock strenuously disagrees with the Dutch physicians,\n\n08:48:22.\n\n4 Stuart J. Youngner and Robert M. Arnold arguing that physicians must never kill patients because doing so would weaken the moral grounding and structural integrity of the medical profession and its service to society. Margaret Battin disagrees with Byock. She reviews and rejects three common arguments against PAD, including Byock’s and two others—​that is, that killing is always wrong and that, if allowed, PAD would lead down an inevitable slippery slope to abuse so dire that it has been called a moral holocaust. Battin defends PAD with two arguments: categorically forbidding PAD is an unconscionable abridgment of one’s liberty in a society that celebrates freedom, and our celebrated right to pursue happiness implies a right to avoid the unhappiness occasioned too often by death in the modern era. The final section, Section VI, explores hospice and palliative care, which many have seen as an answer, if not the answer, to the psychosocical and ethical problems of death and dying in our modern society. David Clark starts the section by discussing the development, similarities, and differences between hospice and palliative care. He describes the emergent clinical evidence produced by the field and its growing professionalization. Robert Arnold expresses a cautionary note about this growing professionalization. He argues that increasing specialist palliative care is not the best way to improve the care of most dying patients. Increasing specialist palliative care may have the unintended consequences of allowing the health care system to continue to deny death and de-​skilling the nonpalliative physicians who provide the bulk of care for dying patients. Sean Morrison suggests a different approach. He argues that the underutilization of specialist palliative care is due to a failure to consider basic marketing principles. His marketing recommendation is that palliative care needs to disassociate itself from the words “death” and “dying.” Have we moved full circle, back to the late 1960s, where encouraging denial of death is again considered the best way to cope with it? This irony speaks to the power of death, high-​tech or otherwise, to frighten us—​perhaps with the result that we act against our own best interests.\n\n08:48:22.\n\nSection I\n\nC L I N IC A L A N D L E G A L I S SU E S\n\n08:47:34.\n\n08:47:34.\n\nChapter 1\n\nLegal Issu es i n De at h and Dyi ng How Rights and Autonomy Have Shaped Clinical Practice Alan Meisel\n\nThe development of the law governing end-​of-​life decisions owes much to other social trends that somewhat predated its origins and paralleled its development—​most notably the civil rights and consumer rights movements of the 1950s through the 1970s. Yet without one other factor—​the development of medical technology—​it is unlikely that there would be any significant body of end-​of-​life law today. Without ventilators, dialysis, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, feeding tubes, and all the other death-​postponing devices, technology, techniques, and medications, decisions about whether to keep people alive or allow nature to take its course would not have to be made; instead, nature would take its course as it always had. The confluence of these larger social trends virtually guaranteed that some social institution for resolving disputes would need to be invoked to address those disputes arising from making decisions about end-​of-​life medical treatment. Several social institutions existed to address this need, including the organized medical profession (in the form of the American Medical Association and other medical and health-​care specialty organizations) and organized religion, but both of these lacked the finality—​especially concerning the possibility of legal liability—​that the courts possessed, and thus it largely fell to the latter to define the rights, roles, and responsibilities of those involved in the end-​of-​life decision-​making process, with state legislatures increasingly playing a role. For almost four decades, American courts have been the final arbiter in this process. Other civic, professional, and governmental institutions continue to play a role, but it is ultimately to the courts that we look for definitive guidance. Key players in end-​of-​life dilemmas—​usually the family members of patients whose doctors declined to withhold or withdraw life-​sustaining medical treatment, but occasionally physicians or health-​care managers—​turned to the courts to break impasses that could not otherwise be resolved.\n\n08:47:34.\n\n8 Alan Meisel This is not difficult to understand, for courts are able to grant immunity from legal liability that no other social institution (except for another law-​making entity, legislatures) is able to do, and fear of legal liability has been one of the primary drivers, if not the primary one, of physicians’ uncertainty about permitting patients to forgo life-​sustaining treatment. There have not been large numbers of end-​of-​life cases reaching the courts. In the fifteen-​year period between the Karen Ann Quinlan case in 1975 (In re Quinlan 1976)—​ the first true end-​of-​life case—​and the Nancy Cruzan case in 1990 (Cruzan v. Director 1990)—​the first U.S. Supreme Court case to address end-​of-​life issues—​there were fewer than 100 such cases. However, almost all of them were legal landmarks that captured the public’s attention too. Many made the national news—​the covers of the newsweekly magazines, the evening news on the national television networks—​and those that did not, without exception, made local or statewide headlines. They were also the grist for articles in an array of medical journals read by physicians generally and those in the specialties and subspecialties most likely to be involved in end-​of-​life controversies. And, of course, the lawyers who counseled health-​care institutions were well aware of these decisions. The lessons of these court decisions quickly became incorporated into clinical practice, especially in those states in which the cases were decided. But as time went by, legislatures in other states and medical professional associations adopted, respectively, statutes and policies that incorporated the principles established in the court decisions. A Presidential Commission issued a report in 1983 that also reflected the emerging consensus about how end-​of-​life decisions should be made (President’s Commission 1983). Taken together, the cases, statutes, policies, and the commission report gradually affected clinical practice, and, as clinical practice changed, it began to influence the decisions in new cases, thus creating a feedback loop further influencing the development of the law. The first major clinical case to become a legal case was that involving Karen Ann Quinlan, beginning in 1975. Prior to that time, there had been a handful of legal cases in the 1950s and 1960s raising similar—​though not quite the same—​issues, but for one reason or another each case was somewhat idiosyncratic and had little overall influence. The early 1970s witnessed an explosion of legal cases promoting autonomy in medical decision making even before the end-​of-​life cases arose. Gradually building steam for fifteen years, courts decided three important cases in 1972 involving “informed consent” to medical treatment. And at the beginning of 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in Roe v. Wade—​following in the wake of earlier decisions removing state prohibitions on the sale and use of contraceptives—​recognizing a woman’s right to control her own reproductive matters.\n\nThe Karen Quinlan Case The facts of the Quinlan case are well known to many. Those who were alive at the time remember it from television news shows and from Karen Quinlan’s picture on the cover\n\n08:47:34.\n\nLegal Issues in Death and Dying 9 of national newsmagazines. It was not merely a legal case; it was a cultural phenomenon. Never before had such a series of events occurred, and they held the country in their grip. Karen Quinlan was a twenty-​one-​year-​old woman who was discovered by friends at a party that they were all attending to be unconscious and not breathing. They summoned emergency medical services personnel, who resuscitated her, put her on a ventilator, and took her to a nearby hospital, to which she was admitted. After she was diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state and after her parents came to understand the implications of that diagnosis—​namely, that she was incapable of perceiving her external environment, that her cerebral cortex was no longer functioning and thus she was incapable of thought or feeling, and that she would never regain any of these human capacities and would remain forever unconscious until she died—​they concluded that it was best that her ventilatory support be discontinued and that nature be allowed to take its course. As devout Roman Catholics, they consulted with their priest, who assured them that there was no religious imperative for them to maintain the medical life support, and they asked Karen’s physicians to discontinue it. The physicians, however, would not accede to this request because of their concern that medical ethics required them to do what they could to keep their patient alive and because of their concern about possible criminal liability for homicide if they discontinued life support and Karen died, as her parents intended. Quinlan’s parents had only two choices: to acquiesce in their doctors’ position or to seek to overturn it through judicial proceedings, and they chose the latter. Although the trial court sided with the physicians and refused to order the termination of life support on the ground that to do so would subject the physicians to liability for criminal homicide, the New Jersey Supreme Court, to which the trial court’s decision was appealed, held otherwise. It found that Karen Quinlan had a right to privacy, protected by the U.S. Constitution, which encompassed the right to be free from unwanted medical treatment, and because she was unable to exercise this right personally because of her medical condition, her father, as her legal guardian, was empowered to do so. Additionally, the court mandated that in cases such as this, “physicians should consult with [the] hospital ethics committee and if [the] committee should agree with physicians’ prognosis, the life-​support systems may be withdrawn” (In re Quinlan, 670). And finally, the court made clear that decisions to forgo life-​sustaining medical treatment did not automatically need judicial approval. Instead, the ethics committee’s approval would suffice. The Quinlan case revolutionized legal thinking and clinical practice regarding decisions near the end of life. Before the Quinlan case, a great cloud of legal uncertainty cast a pall over decisions to forgo life-​sustaining medical treatment. Doctors were simply afraid that forgoing treatment, which would result in a patient’s death, would subject them to criminal liability. Although the cloud did not entirely dissipate with the Quinlan decision, it was now clear that there were no simple black-​and-​white rules for making end-​of-​life decisions. And it was equally clear that forgoing life-​sustaining medical treatment would not subject physicians to legal liability if they did it in accordance with the rules that the court established. End-​of-​life decision making was far more\n\n08:47:34.\n\n10 Alan Meisel complex a matter than it had previously seemed, and it would become more complex and confused before a consensus emerged and the rules were sorted out. Finally, the New Jersey Supreme Court assumed that hospitals had ethics committees; in fact, most did not. But the mandate to consult with an ethics committee was a strong incentive, first in New Jersey and then elsewhere, for hospitals to establish such committees, and eventually the Joint Commission, which accredits health-​care institutions, established standards for such committees. Thus, although the law never required ethics committees, it played an extremely influential role in their establishment.\n\nTo Go to Court or Not The year following the Quinlan decision, another state supreme court had the opportunity to consider a similar matter. This case, Superintendent of Belchertown State School v. Saikewicz (1977) involved a sixty-​seven-​year old man who was a resident of a Massachusetts state institution for the developmentally disabled and who was diagnosed with acute myeloblastic monocytic leukemia. Ordinarily, people with this medical condition would be offered chemotherapy, but Mr. Saikewicz’s doctors recommended against its administration, ostensibly on the ground that because of his profound mental retardation, he would not be able to understand what was being done to him and would have to be physically restrained for treatment to be administered. The most significant aspect of the Saikewicz case for medical decision-​making purposes was the court’s requirement—​directly contrary to that of the New Jersey Supreme Court—​that end-​of-​ life decisions required judicial oversight. In other words, before life-​sustaining medical treatment could be withheld or withdraw, a judge had to approve the decision. Thus within a year of what had seemed to be a clarifying decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court, the situation was once again thrown into confusion by the conflicting aspects of the Massachusetts decision. Only through a series of decisions by both of these courts—​and by state courts in many other jurisdictions, strongly influenced by the President’s Commission Report—​were these conflicts ironed out and a consensus ultimately achieved over the next decade or more. The consensus that evolved was that, ordinarily, decisions to forgo life-​sustaining treatment did not need the approval of a judge, and thus they could be made in the clinical setting between physicians and patients possessing decision-​making capacity or between physicians and close families members of patients who did not possess decision-​making capacity. Beginning in the 1990s, state legislatures began to step into this aspect of end-​of-​life decision making by enacting statutes (referred to as either surrogate decision-​making or family decision-​making statutes) recognizing the legitimacy of this practice and establishing the order of family members who had the authority to make such decisions. These statutes also contained provisions for resolving disputes among family members. By 2012, thirty-​nine states and the District of Columbia had enacted such laws.\n\n08:47:34.\n\nLegal Issues in Death and Dying 11\n\nStandards for Surrogate Decision Making Another significant aspect of the Saikewicz case was the court’s holding that decisions to forgo life-​sustaining treatment must be based on the patient’s own wishes. In the case of patients who currently lack decision-​making capacity, the court must find that the patient would have wanted treatment forgone. This is fairly uncontroversial and consistent with the Quinlan decision. However, the Massachusetts court went further by applying this standard even to a person who—​like Mr. Saikewicz—​never possessed decision-​making capacity and thus could never have formed any preferences about treatment. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court persisted in this illogical position in a number of similar cases throughout the 1980s, including at least one involving a patient who was an infant and thus, like Saikewicz, could never have formed any treatment preferences. Eventually, however, as was the case with the question of judicial review, the courts in most states coalesced around a point of view closer to that taken by the New Jersey Supreme Court, namely that in making decisions for patients who lack decision-​making capacity, the surrogate should attempt to discern what the patient would have decided if he or she now possessed it—​what is referred to as the substituted judgment standard. If a patient had never possessed decision-​making capacity, the surrogate should, instead, make a decision reflecting the “best interests” of the patient. Although courts in two states (New York and Missouri) at first took a more extreme position—​that there must be clear and convincing evidence of the patient’s actual wish to forgo life-​sustaining treatment rather than the patient’s probable wish to do so as the substituted judgment standard allows—​the law in both states has subsequently gravitated closer to the mainstream substituted judgment standard, in New York by statute and in Missouri by later judicial decision.\n\nRejection of Limitations on Forgoing Life-​Sustaining Treatment The New Jersey Supreme Court turned out to be a leader in shaping end-​of-​life law. Each of the court’s efforts to resolve one end-​of-​life dilemma gave rise to others, so that by the mid-​1980s the court had become the national leader in defining end-​of-​life law, which in turn shaped clinical practice. The next New Jersey case after Quinlan was the Conroy case in 1985 (In re Conroy 1985) For present purposes, the significance of Conroy was that it lent judicial support to the rejection of two modes of analysis of end-​of-​life decision making that\n\n08:47:34.\n\n12 Alan Meisel had long been employed in the clinical setting to limit the authority of patients or their surrogates to forgo life-​sustaining treatment. The influence of the Conroy opinion cannot be understated. It has been cited by dozens of other judicial end-​of-​life opinions, and it was written about extensively in medical journals. Its direct effect on clinical practice has been substantial, in no small part because of its ratification of the President’s Commission Report by incorporating large parts of its reasoning into the opinion.\n\nLimitation of the State Interests Analysis The first of these is what might be called the “state interests” approach. Prior cases had established a constellation of four state interests to be weighed against an individual’s right to refuse medical treatment and that, in theory at least, could overcome that right. These are the state’s interest in (1) the preservation of life, (2) the prevention of suicide, (3) safeguarding the integrity of the medical profession, and (4) “protecting innocent third parties who may be harmed by the patient’s treatment decision” (In re Conroy 1985, 1223–​1225). Although acknowledging the validity of these state interests in the abstract, the court concluded that they could not overcome the decision of a competent patient (nor, implicitly, the decision of a surrogate of an incompetent patient acting on the basis of the patient’s wishes) in the end-​of-​life context because to allow them to do so would overcome a patient’s fundamental legal right to refuse treatment.\n\nRejection of the Categorical Approach Another mode of analyzing the propriety of end-​of-​life decisions that had arisen mostly from judicial opinions was what might be termed the “categorical” approach to decision making. Since long before the Quinlan case, theologians (especially Roman Catholic theologians), clinicians, and some courts had employed a number of categories for analyzing the propriety of medical decisions that would have the likely effect of ending a patient’s life. The President’s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, in its 1983 report titled “Deciding to Forego Life-​Sustaining Treatment,” had thoroughly analyzed and rejected these categories as a useful means for analyzing the legitimacy of end-​of-​life decisions, but the report carried no legal weight. However, its reasoning proved to be extremely influential on the New Jersey Supreme Court, which cited it repeatedly in the Conroy opinion.\n\n08:47:34.\n\nLegal Issues in Death and Dying 13 These categories are (1) active versus passive, (2) withholding versus withdrawing, and (3) ordinary versus extraordinary.1 The court held that they are irrelevant to end-​of-​life decision making, where the primary focus should be the patient’s wishes and “not the type of treatment involved” (In re Conroy 1985, 1233). “Thus, we reject the distinction that some have made between actively hastening (In re Conroy 1985, 1233–​1234) death by terminating treatment and passively allowing a person to die of a disease as one of limited use in a legal analysis of such a decision-​making situation. Characterizing conduct as active or passive is often an elusive notion, even outside the context of medical decision-​making.” Similarly, the court “reject[ed] any distinction between withholding and withdrawing life-​sustaining treatment” (In re Conroy 1985, 1234), holding that it was a variant of the active/​passive distinction and that while the distinction might be psychologically important, it was not logically sound. Finally, the court found “unpersuasive the distinction relied upon by some courts, commentators, and theologians between ‘ordinary’ treatment, which they would always require, and ‘extraordinary’ treatment, which they deem optional” (In re Conroy 1985, 1234) because “the terms ‘ordinary’ and ‘extraordinary’ have assumed too many conflicting meanings to remain useful. To draw a line on this basis for determining whether treatment should be given leads to a semantical [sic] milieu that does not advance the analysis” (In re Conroy 1985, 1235). The judicial rejection of this form of reasoning has probably had a significant effect on clinical practice. Whereas at one time doctors might have hesitated to begin a patient on dialysis or a ventilator or a feeding tube for fear that once they began they could not stop—​ because although it was acceptable to withhold treatment, it was unacceptable to withdraw it—​now they felt free to begin a trial of treatment to see if it will benefit the patient. If it did not, the treatment can then be withdrawn without fear of legal consequences—​assuming of course that there is valid authorization from the patient or surrogate to do so. Patients who in the past might have benefited from a trial of treatment are no longer deprived of that opportunity for fear that they will be forever bound to continue. The rejection of the ordinary/​extraordinary distinction means that doctors no longer have to engage in ultimately futile discussions about whether a treatment is extraordinary because it is new, or expensive, or technologically sophisticated, and what the meaning of those terms are as applied to a particular treatment. Treatments may be withheld or withdrawn based, instead, on patients’ wishes and the physician’s judgment of their medical efficacy—​criteria of actual relevance to a patient’s well-​being rather than abstruse criteria bearing no such relationship.\n\nFeeding Tubes After Karen Quinlan was weaned from the ventilator in accordance with the New Jersey Supreme Court’s decision, she continued to breathe nonetheless. Although she had\n\n08:47:34.\n\n14 Alan Meisel initially been dependent on the ventilator to keep her alive, her respiratory drive had recovered to the point where it no longer was needed. Thereafter, the only medical treatment she required to keep her alive was a surgically implanted feeding tube and, occasionally, antibiotics for the treatment of pulmonary and urinary tract infections. Karen Quinlan died in 1986 while still being fed and hydrated by a feeding tube, and if her parents ever considered asking to have her feeding tube removed, there is no record of that request. However, the families of other patients did seek to have feeding tubes withheld or withdrawn during the period when Quinlan was being kept alive by one (1975–​1986), and considering how many elderly nursing home patients are on feeding tubes, it is probable that the number is quite large. However, there is no judicial record of such a request prior to the Barber case in California in 1982 (Barber v. Superior Court 1983). That case was a criminal prosecution—​to date, the only criminal prosecution for the withdrawal of life-​ sustaining medical treatment. The decision in that case finding that there was no criminal liability on the part of the physician who ordered the tube removed (with the permission of the patient’s next-​of-​kin) stands for the proposition that feeding tubes are medical treatment that may be removed on the same basis as any other medical treatment. This conclusion was reaffirmed in the Conroy case in 1986 and in a number of cases thereafter. Whether or not the provision of nutrition and hydration by medical means is—​for legal purposes—​to be considered medical treatment and whether it may be forgone on the same terms as any other medical treatment was not definitively settled until the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Cruzan case in 1990. Although the Supreme Court did not directly address this issue, the Court assumed that it was a medical treatment (Cruzan v. Director 1990, 279). Furthermore, in a concurring opinion, Justice O’Connor got to the heart of the matter when she commented that whether or not a feeding tube constituted a medical treatment was, for constitutional purposes, irrelevant because tube feeding, where consent had never been given or had been withdrawn, constituted a restraint and intrusion on that individual’s liberty, which violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Cruzan v. Director 1990, 288). Since the Supreme Court’s decision in the Cruzan case, there has been very little litigation about the legality of withholding or withdrawing feeding tubes (the major exception being the Schiavo case; In re Schiavo 2001). Although withholding and withdrawing tube feeding is now well-​accepted clinical practice among some segments of the medical profession, it is still met with significant resistance by those who hold the position that forgoing tube feeding in the case of those who can no longer be fed orally constitutes “starving the patient to death.”\n\nThe Acceptance of Do-​Not-​R esuscitate Orders In the atmosphere of uncertainty about the legal status of forgoing life-​sustaining treatment before, during, and even after the Quinlan case—​that is, from the mid-​1970s\n\n08:47:34.\n\nLegal Issues in Death and Dying 15 through the mid-​1980s, or even later—​the uncertain status of forgoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation loomed largest of all. Why this was so is not altogether clear, but it possibly resulted from the fact that, by that time, the administration of CPR to patients suffering a cardiac arrest had become standard operating procedure and that, in order to prevent its administration, efforts had to be made in advance by writing an order not to resuscitate. Such orders are referred to as DNR (do-​not-​resuscitate) orders, or orders not to resuscitate, or “no code,” but their legality was in doubt, at least in the minds of some physicians (Margolick 1982). Consequently, doctors sometimes undertook subterfuges to assure that CPR was withheld from some patients. Some of these procedures—​such as giving oral but not written orders—​ran the serious risk of being misinterpreted, thus resulting in some patients being resuscitated who were not supposed to be and vice versa. This sometimes resulted in, in the words of a grand jury report investigating the use of DNR orders in New York, “shocking procedural abuses” (Sullivan 1982). Although a few courts have had occasion to review and comment on DNR orders, the judicial authority is so thin that the vacuum has largely been filled by state legislative enactment of statutes authorizing either doctors to write DNR orders or patients to issue DNR directives or both. Concerns such as these led to the enactment of detailed statutes governing DNR orders in many states (for the citations to these statutes, see Meisel and Cerminara 2012, Section 6.02[C]‌[4]). Most of these statutes address formal procedural issues such as who may write a DNR order or issue a DNR directive, identification of patients with orders or directives, recordkeeping requirements, revocation of orders and directives, and similar matters. What they fail to address is the most controversial issue, namely the resolution of disputes that arise between family members demanding the administration of CPR and physicians who believe that its administration would be ineffective or even harmful to a patient. (This issue is addressed later under the heading of “Futility”.) What is most noteworthy is that the enactment of this legislation has taken what was once a covert clinical process and legitimated it. Whereas many doctors once feared the legal consequences of authorizing the withholding of CPR—​even though no doctor had ever been held civilly or criminally liable for doing so—​today a code status is routinely sought for virtually all patients admitted to a health care institution, and CPR is routinely withheld from those patients for whom a DNR order has been written.\n\nAdvance Directives For a long period of time—​as was the case with DNR orders—​the legal status and effect of advance directives was uncertain. Advance directives are instructions issued by patients while they possess decision-​making capacity providing guidance about how they wish to be treated if they lose decision-​making capacity. The oldest form of advance directive is the living will, first proposed in a law review article in 1969 (Kutner 1969). A living will is a written document stating that if the declarant (i.e., the future\n\n08:47:34.\n\n16 Alan Meisel patient) loses decision-​making capacity and needs to be treated, he or she is to be treated in accordance with the instructions in the directive. A very simple (and not very useful) advance directive might state, “If I lose decision-​making capacity and am likely to die even with treatment, I do not want an extraordinary treatment.” A more specific advance directive might, for example, state, “If I lose decision-​making capacity and am suffering from kidney failure, I do not want dialysis administered.” Realizing that it is virtually impossible to anticipate in advance the entire gamut of treatments an individual might wish to decline (or have administered because an advance directive may request treatment as well as refuse it), it soon became clear that issuing such instructions would either be very vague (e.g., no “extraordinary” treatment) or very detailed yet still run the risk of not addressing the kind of treatment that was in fact under consideration. To deal with this problem, consideration began to be given to the use of an existing legal instrument, known as a durable power of attorney, to appoint another person to make health-​care decisions if the declarant no longer possessed decision-​making capacity. The difficulty with both of these forms of advance directives—​living wills and durable powers of attorney—​is that there was no explicit legal basis for them, and hence a physician who made treatment decisions for an incompetent patient on the basis of one of them had some reason to be concerned that such decisions were not legally valid and thus had some reason to fear the imposition of civil or criminal liability. Of course, it was not entirely clear—​indeed, until about 1990, it was fairly unclear—​how decisions for patients lacking decision-​making capacity should be made. There was uncertainty in many states about the authority of family members to make such decisions. There was uncertainty about whether a guardian needed to be judicially appointed to make such decisions, there was uncertainty about whether the surrogate’s or guardian’s decision to forgo life-​sustaining treatment needed judicial approval before it could be implemented, and there was the further uncertainty about whether decisions made on the basis of an advance directive were valid. This massive uncertainty was gradually resolved in the first instance—​in some states not until the 1990s or even later—​by the filing of lawsuits, usually by family members of incompetent patients, requesting a court to declare their authority to make medical decisions for an incompetent patient. Rarely were advance directives the central issue in the case, and thus what the courts had to say about advance directives were nonbinding “dicta.” Further, there were actually very few judicial decisions commenting on the validity of advance directives. What ultimately was responsible for legitimating advance directives was the enactment of legislation by state legislatures. What prompted the legislatures to act, however, is less clear, though a reasonable guess is that it was a combination of the headline-​ grabbing nature of end-​of-​life cases and the pleas of many family members, who never thought of filing a lawsuit, to their legislators. The adoption of uniform legislation on advance directives by the National Council of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, first in 1985 (Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1987), which was revised\n\n08:47:34.\n\nLegal Issues in Death and Dying 17 in 1989 (Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1999) and then completely reformulated in 1993 (Uniform Health-​Care Decisions Act 1999), may have also played an important role. Another important factor—​perhaps the most important—​was the passage of legislation by Congress in 1990 known as the Patient Self-​Determination Act (PSDA; Pub. L. No 101-​508 1990). The PSDA requires any health-​care institution accepting Medicare funds (which is almost all hospitals and a large proportion of long-​term care facilities) to inform patients of their rights under state law to make an advance directive. The legislation did not create a legal basis for advance directives. It merely required that, where the law of the state in which the health-​care institution was situated recognizes the validity of advance directives, patients be told that about this state law, so in essence the statute is merely a notification provision. Nonetheless, because it was a federal law, and because it was enacted in the wake of and partially as a result of the Supreme Court’s well-​ publicized Cruzan decision, it received a tremendous amount of publicity, so that not only did health-​care personnel become aware of it but so did many patients and families. Furthermore, each time patients were admitted to a health-​care institution, the process of informing them about advance directives resulted in a gradual process of educating the public about advance directives. As a result of the adoption of state advance directive legislation and the implementation of the PSDA, physicians and other health-​care professionals, as well as health-​care managers in hospitals, became aware of the validity of living wills and health care powers of attorney in general. This did not solve all of the issues surrounding their use, but it at least confirmed that it was not illegal, per se, to base end-​of-​life decisions on a living will or on the decisions of a health-​care proxy appointed by the patient using a health-​ care power of attorney.\n\nFutility Until the 1990s, almost all litigation involving end-​of-​life issues followed a similar pattern in which a patient or surrogate requested a physician to withhold or withdraw life-​ sustaining medical treatment and the physician declined to do so on clinical, ethical, or legal grounds (or some mix of the three). The patient or surrogate then filed a lawsuit to have a court resolve the dispute. The lawsuit almost always took the form of a request for declaratory and/​or injunctive relief, that is, a court order declaring what the law is governing the matter in question and ordering the physician to implement the patient’s or surrogate’s request. Rarely was a lawsuit filed requesting monetary damages from the physician (or other health-​care provider) for treatment rendered without consent. After a decade or two of such cases, clinical practice markedly changed such that physicians came to understand the circumstances in which forgoing life-​sustaining treatment was legally required, and they much more readily acceded to such requests.\n\n08:47:34.\n\n18 Alan Meisel In fact, so well-​accepted did the forgoing of life-​sustaining treatment become that eventually physicians began to initiate such efforts rather than waiting for surrogates to do so, and sometimes they did so well ahead of a family’s readiness to acknowledge that further treatment would not save the patient’s life or that further treatment was imposing far greater burdens than benefits on the patient. Cases of this sort have come to be known as “futility” cases because it was commonly said by physicians, in broaching this subject with families, that they were recommending forgoing life-​sustaining treatment because further treatment would be futile. The first of these futility cases is still probably the best known—​the Wanglie case in Minnesota (In re Wanglie 1991)—​even though it was never reviewed by an appeals court, and hence it does not constitute, strictly speaking, a legal precedent. Indeed, this is the one area of end-​of-​life law that has not yet reached a significant degree of consensus—​ largely because there has been so little law-​making, either judicial or legislative—​in this area. And because of the legal inactivity, the void has largely been filled by pronouncements from individual health-​care institutions and professional societies. About the best legal advice that can be given is that although patients and surrogates do not have a legal right to demand the provision of any and all treatment they might wish—​even those that are plausibly medically appropriate for the patient’s condition—​it is still highly imprudent for a physician to forgo—​especially to withdraw—​life-​sustaining treatment against the explicit wishes of the patient or family. This is most clearly the case when the patient is in possession of decision-​making capacity, and only a little less so when the patient lacks decision-​making capacity and a surrogate is making decisions on the patient’s behalf. Rather, in situations in which the attending physician believes that a particular treatment is not warranted and the patient—​or more likely the surrogate and other family members—​want it to be administered, the physician has several possible courses of action. One is for the physician to provide treatment and wait—​wait until the family comes to an understanding on its own timetable that further treatment is unlikely to benefit the patient, which might not occur before the patient dies. Another course of action is for the physician to attempt to transfer the patient’s care to another physician who does not object to providing the requested treatment (though the patient’s insurance company and/​or the hospital may have objections to continuing to pay for such treatment). The third course of action is to withhold or withdraw treatment against the surrogate’s wishes and risk whatever legal consequences might be forthcoming.\n\nActively Hastening Death and Palliative Care The development of end-​of-​life law has primarily been driven by physicians’ fears of legal liability for causing the death of a patient. Absent this fear, it is not clear that the\n\n08:47:34.\n\nLegal Issues in Death and Dying 19 Quinlan case would have ever reached the courts (although the physicians in that case claimed that they were motivated by considerations of medical ethics as well). Indeed, the same can be said for virtually every one of the 150 or so end-​of-​life cases litigated to date. In reality, very little of the litigation has expressly sought to impose any kind of liability. The overwhelming proportion of litigated end-​of-​life cases have sought a declaratory judgment, an injunction, or both—​that is, a court order that some proposed course of forgoing life-​sustaining treatment was lawful. Although a few litigated cases have resulted from intrafamilial conflicts about whether life-​sustaining medical treatment should be forgone—​the most notable being the Schiavo case—​this constitutes a very small proportion of end-​of-​life cases. There has been only one criminal prosecution of physicians for forgoing life-​sustaining treatment (Barber v. Superior Court 1983), and it was resolved in their favor. In addition, there have been surprisingly few civil cases seeking monetary damages from physicians arising out of end-​of-​life decisions, and most have sought damages for continuing treatment rather than for discontinuing it. Beginning with the Quinlan case, the courts have fashioned a variety of overlapping explanations as to why forgoing life-​sustaining medical treatment does not result in legal culpability on the part of a patient’s physicians.\n\nCausation One is a causal explanation. According to the courts, when life-​sustaining treatment is withheld or withdrawn, it is not the forgoing of treatment that causes the patient’s death. Rather it is the patient’s underlying medical condition—​which makes continued life impossible without the treatment in question—​that is the cause of the patient’s death. This obviously is an overly simplistic explanation because rarely, if ever, can causation be explained by a sole cause. A result usually has many causes, some more direct and some more attenuated than others, but they are causes in a factual sense nonetheless. In the instance of forgoing life-​sustaining treatment, it is clear that the patient would not have died under the circumstances that he or she did had treatment not been forgone, and therefore to deny that the physician’s actions did not play a causal role in the patient’s death is nonsense. The central issue is not a factual one but a moral and legal one: should the physician be morally and legally culpable for the role that his conduct played in bringing about the patient’s death? To answer this in the negative because the physician’s conduct is said not to be the cause of death—​if by the cause is meant sole cause—​is correct but misses the point.\n\nIntent Another explanation as to why a physician should not be legally culpable for a patient’s death resulting from forgoing life-​sustaining treatment is that, in such situations, the physician lacks the intent necessary for criminal liability—​the intent to cause death.\n\n08:47:34.\n\n20 Alan Meisel Courts have reasoned that when life-​sustaining treatment is forgone, the physician’s intent is to honor the patient’s wishes or to relieve the patient’s suffering or both, but not to cause death. Death is said to be merely the consequence of such conduct. This explanation is as flawed as that based on causation. In law, one is said to intend the natural and probable consequences of one’s acts, and the natural and probable consequence of withholding or withdrawing life-​sustaining treatment is that the patient will die; therefore, one’s intent, as far as the law is concerned, is for the patient to die. Also, in law, for there to be intent, one need not have the resulting consequence of an action be the purpose of one’s actions; it is enough that one knows with substantial certainty that a result will ensue for one to be said to “intend” it. In the end-​of-​life treatment context, this means that even if the physician’s purpose is not to cause the patient’s death, he still intends that result if he knows with substantial certainty that death will result from his actions—​that is, from forgoing life-​sustaining treatment.\n\nRight to Refuse Treatment The last important explanation2 as to why forgoing life-​sustaining treatment should not be the basis for civil or criminal liability is that, historically, in American law (and its English antecedents), individuals have a legal right to be free from unwanted contact with their persons. Medical treatment to which there is no consent, or to which consent has been withdrawn, constitutes just such an interference with bodily integrity. In other words, forgoing life-​sustaining treatment constitutes an individual’s invocation of his or her right to refuse treatment, and as such, no penalty may be imposed on the physician who honors such a right by withholding or withdrawing treatment—​even if it results in the patient’s death—​as long as it is authorized by the patient or someone with the legal authority to act on the patient’s behalf. This is the most direct and most satisfying explanation of why an act—​forgoing life-​sustaining treatment—​that results in death, and that is intended to, still does not constitute the basis for civil or criminal liability.\n\nPainting a Bright Line: Passively Versus Actively Hastening Death The upshot of all of this is that the courts have unanimously been able to declare that withholding or withdrawing of life-​sustaining treatment that results in a patient’s death—​as long as properly authorized by the patient or a surrogate—​cannot be the basis for civil or criminal liability. But what about patients (or surrogates) who are terminally ill but whose continued life is not dependent on any form of medical treatment? Some patients may be suffering greatly—​physically, emotionally, psychologically, spiritually, existentially, or some combination of these. They may wish for this suffering to end, and\n\n08:47:34.\n\nLegal Issues in Death and Dying 21 they may wish to have that happen by ending their lives. But since there is no treatment to forgo, the only way to end their lives is through some active intervention, either at their own hands or those of someone else. In their decisions holding that withholding and withdrawing life-​sustaining medical treatment are legitimate, the courts—​although not directly asked to decide the question—​have nonetheless gone out of their way to draw a bright line between the practice they are authorizing (forgoing life-​sustaining treatment or passively hastening death) and the practice of actively hastening death and to emphasize that the latter is clearly illegal, indeed, criminal. More specifically, it is some form of criminal homicide, either murder or manslaughter. For the courts not to have made this distinction is unimaginable. First, and most clearly, both forms of actively hastening death, at least at first glance, clearly fit the classic definitions of the crimes of aiding suicide or homicide. Second, from a sociocultural perspective, it is hard to imagine in the 1970s or 1980s that any court in the United States would have held that the active ending of a life—​even the life of someone who is imminently dying and even by that person’s own actions—​could be considered socially, morally, or legally appropriate behavior. Third, merely legitimating passively hastening death—​that is, withholding or withdrawing life-​sustaining medical treatment—​ was at that time controversial enough. Had any court sought to extend that practice to the legitimization of actively hastening death, it would have been an even greater leap. Given the degree of opposition, at least in the early stages, to passively hastening death, to have attempted to legitimate actively hastening death as well would have been to create serious obstacles to legitimization of the former. Thus the keystone of the consensus about end-​of-​life decision making that evolved from the 1970s to the 1990s was that there is a clear, bright line between passively hastening death and actively hastening death. All the end-​of-​life cases to reach the courts have involved passively hastening death (or—​as it usually referred to in judicial opinions and often in clinical practice—​forgoing life-​sustaining treatment or withholding and withdrawing life-​sustaining treatment). It is what the courts and legislatures and clinicians and bioethicists have sanctioned—​as long as there is valid consent. Actively hastening death, by contrast, has traditionally been beyond the pale to all who subscribe to the consensus about end-​of-​life decisions. Actively hastening death—​whether by the patient’s own hand or through the efforts of a third person (a physician, a nurse, a family member or friend)—​is never to be countenanced. It is, simply, criminal homicide. Even if the patient has consented, the act is a crime because the law of murder and manslaughter vindicate society’s interests in every human life, not just the individual victim’s interest. One obvious consequence of drawing this bright line was to send a clear message to all clinicians caring for dying patients that any efforts to actively hasten a patient’s death were legally unacceptable. To the extent that actively hastening death was already being practiced—​albeit covertly because of its presumed illegality—​this had the effect either of reducing its practice or driving it further underground or both. Another, and less obvious, result may have had to do with the use of medications for pain relief. Physicians caring for the dying may have been made more uncomfortable than ever to prescribe—​and\n\n08:47:34.\n\n22 Alan Meisel nurses to administer—​opiates and barbiturates for the relief of suffering for fear that it would hasten a patient’s death and be considered an “active,” rather than “passive,” hastening of death. In the longer run, however, drawing this bright line has had just the opposite results. As time went by, the disparate treatment of the two categories of the dying—​those being kept alive by medical treatment and those not—​became more apparent and more difficult to justify. Why the person dying of a painful cancer but not being kept alive by life support could obtain not hasten death but the patient with kidney failure could forgo dialysis and hasten his or her death was not readily apparent, at least not on compassionate grounds. This led to two diametrically opposed movements: one to legalize physician aid-​in-​dying and the other to improve palliative care. In truth, however, the line between passively and actively hastening death was never as clear or bright as its defenders would have it, and slowly, beginning in the late 1980s, they began to attempt to abolish it, with limited but increasing success. A number of factors have played an important role in this process. Although there have long been proponents of legalizing physician aid-​in-​dying in the United States and elsewhere, this movement had virtually no political traction until the 1990s. However, a series of events in the late 1980s and the early 1990s turned what was largely a pipedream into a serious political and legal movement. First, there has been an increasingly open and intense public debate about the subject. Articles in reputable medical journals—​such as “A Piece of My Mind: It’s Over Debbie” (1988) in the Journal of the American Medical Association and “Death and Dignity: A Case of Individualized Decision Making” (Quill 1991) in the New England Journal of Medicine—​have exposed the fact that clinicians sometimes actively end the lives of seriously suffering patients. A number of surveys of health care professionals lead to the same conclusion (Asch 1996; Back et al. 1996; “Poll Shows” 1992), which raises the important question of whether the practice of actively hastening death might be subject to abuse and whether legalization and regulation would help to assure that it is practiced only with the voluntary consent of competent patients. The practices of the crackpot Michigan pathologist, Jack Kevorkian, to create and make available a “suicide machine” to those who wished to use it played a key role in this movement. Despite the ghoulish nature of his undertaking, he did manage to bring the issue of physician aid-​in-​dying out of the closet and into the light of day so that millions of Americans who might otherwise be unfamiliar with the issue suddenly gained new insight into it. Second, public sentiment as expressed in public opinion polls for many decades has revealed that the public overwhelmingly supports the legalization of at least some forms of actively hastening death. At about the same time as Dr. Kevorkian’s activities were occurring and being widely publicized, more sober proponents of legalization began to coalesce and form movements in a number of states to legalize actively hastening death through legislation. This public sentiment has proved difficult to translate into law. As the matter is increasingly openly discussed, the arguments against legalization—​as well as an advertising blitz against legalization—​have more often than not carried the day.\n\n08:47:34.\n\nLegal Issues in Death and Dying 23 Nonetheless, three states through legislation have legalized a form of actively hastening death—​often referred to as “physician aid-​in-​dying,” which involves a physician writing a lethal prescription for a competent, terminally ill patient who requests it. The first two were by referendum in Oregon in 1994 (which was reaffirmed in 1997) and Washington in 2008 and a third by the legislature in Vermont in 2013. Third, there have been a number of lawsuits brought to invalidate laws making assisting suicide a crime, at least insofar as those laws apply to competent, terminally ill people obtaining a prescription for a lethal dose of medication from their licensed physicians. The most important ones were filed in federal courts in Washington state and New York state challenging the constitutionality of those states’ statutes making it a crime to provide aid to another person in committing suicide. Although the federal courts of appeals held in both of these cases that the federal constitution prohibited states from criminalizing physician aid-​in-​dying for a terminally ill person, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed both decisions (Washington v. Glucksberg 1997; Vacco v. Quill 1997). It held that the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee such a right. However, the Court also ruled that states are not prohibited by the Constitution from legalizing if they wish to do so—​thus retrospectively validating the 1994 decision of Oregon voters and prospectively validating similar decisions in other states—​and that the practice of terminal sedation of terminally ill patients, with valid consent, did not offend the Constitution. Finally, the Court also signaled that if, in practice, significant barriers to palliative care for dying patients were found to exist, the Court might be willing to revisit its core holding that state statutes criminalizing aiding suicide do not offend the Constitutional rights of dying patients. Lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of similar laws in Alaska, California, and Florida have also been unsuccessful. However, in two other states (New Mexico [State v. Morris 2014] and Montana [Baxter v. State 2009]), judicial decisions have legalized it. Finally, changes in clinical practice have played an important role in breaking down the distinction between actively and passively hastening death. One important consequence of the public debate about the legalization of actively hastening death has been to shine light on the fact that many people near the end of life who experience serious pain, suffering, or both do not receive adequate treatment for it from their physicians. The increased awareness of this both by the public and those in the health professions has helped to bring about a revolution in the care of the dying, most notably by increasing the availability of palliative care and hospice services. Many of the pharmaceutical agents used in palliative medicine—​opiates, nonopiate analgesics, anxiolytics, and sedatives—​are capable of depressing respiration, and in large enough doses, they can cause a patient’s death. Determining just how much and what combination of medications to administer to a particular patient is as much an art as a science. Give too little, and the patient’s suffering will not be ameliorated; give too much and it may kill the patient. Moral philosophers have long reasoned that a patient’s death resulting from an unintended overdose of palliative medication should not result in moral culpability for the patient’s death. This conclusion is based on the principle of double\n\n08:47:34.\n\n24 Alan Meisel effect—​borrowed from Catholic moral theology—​which holds that if one’s purpose in taking some action is a licit one, the fact that an unintended undesirable consequence also results is not the basis for culpability. Applied to palliative care, this means that the physician who prescribes or administers medication intended to relieve a patient’s suffering is not culpable for harm to the patient from that medication—​including actively hastening the patient’s death—​if that consequence was unintended, even if it was foreseeable. Although well accepted by many philosophers and theologians and understood by physicians, prior to the Supreme Court’s decisions in the physician aid-​in-​dying cases there was no sound legal basis for the doctrine of double effect, so that while it might excuse a physician from moral culpability, it was unclear what effect, if any, it had on legal culpability, which was probably the greater concern for most physicians. The cases before the Supreme Court did not expressly raise the question of whether there was a sound legal basis for the doctrine of double effect. Nonetheless, one of the reasons the Court gave for its unwillingness to find that state laws that made aiding suicide a crime did not violate the Constitution—​even when the person seeking to end his or her life was terminally ill and the person providing the aid was a licensed physician—​was that the doctrine of double effect protected physicians from liability for providing aggressive palliative care to such patients, and thus their needs for pain relief could be met without the legalization of physician aid-​in-​dying. Indeed, patients have a legal right to adequate medication for pain and suffering even if it does hasten death, and thus denying adequate medication, even if it is life-​threatening, constitutes a legal wrong. A small number of states have enacted statutes to provide some legal immunity to physicians from liability arising from death caused by palliative care in addition to that accorded by the Supreme Court’s opinion. To date, all the successful efforts in the United States to legalize actively hastening death have implicitly made a distinction between the two general ways in which death may be actively hastened in terminally ill patients. One way is by another person doing something to the terminally ill patient that ends the latter’s life, the classic example being a physician administering a lethal injection (often referred to as active euthanasia). The other way is by another person providing the terminally ill patient with something by which the patient can end his or her own life (referred to as physician-​ aid-​in-​dying or physician-​assisted suicide); here the classic example is a physician giving the patient a prescription for a lethal dose of medication that the patient self-​ administers. The distinction between the two, if there is indeed a moral one (Brock 1992), is that in the latter situation the patient is the final actor and thus retains, until the last moment, the right to change his or her mind. Only physician-​aid-​in-​dying has achieved any degree of legal recognition in the United States, active euthanasia still being considered a crime in all American jurisdictions. However, in Europe, quite the opposite has been true. Both the Netherlands and Belgium have given formal legal approval to active euthanasia with the patient’s consent, and Switzerland has given tacit legal approval to the practice.\n\n08:47:34.\n\nLegal Issues in Death and Dying 25\n\nConclusion From the decisions of various federal (and mostly state) courts, beginning with the Quinlan case in 1975, a consensus emerged about the legality of withholding and withdrawing life-​sustaining medical treatment. By the time of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the Cruzan case in 1990, this consensus had become fairly well established not just in law but in clinical practice. The Cruzan decision itself helped to cement various aspects of this consensus, and various law-​making efforts of courts and legislatures since then have only reinforced it. Although law has had a tremendous impact on clinical practice with regard to end-​of-​life decision making, the reverse is just as true. Clinical practice—​along with public opinion and the work of a presidential commission—​have greatly influenced the path that courts and legislatures have been willing to take.\n\nNotes 1. The President’s Commission discussed a fourth category—​intended versus unintended but foreseeable consequences—​but the Conroy case did not discuss this one. This is also known as the principle of double effect, which is discussed later in this essay. 2. There are also two other reasons sometimes given by courts as to why forgoing life-​ sustaining treatment is not the basis for legal liability—​it is passive rather than active euthanasia, and there is a basis in advance directive statutes for it—​that are both unconvincing and have played minor role in judicial decisions.\n\nReferences A piece of my mind: It’s over, Debbie. 1988.

Aulisio\n\nMany stories have been written about my daughter. Others can write about the accident, about her life and about her death. But no one else can write about the profound pain and anguish we shared as a family. (Quinlan, 2005: xvi)\n\nIntroduction With the aging of the baby boomers—​what some have termed the “silver tsunami”—​ reliance on surrogate decision-​makers is sure to grow in the years ahead (Dunn and Alici, 2013). A recent study concluded that nearly half of all hospitalized adults in the United States aged sixty-​five or older need a surrogate decision-​maker within twenty-​ four hours of hospitalization (Torke et al., 2014). Almost 60% of these require decisions about life-​sustaining care. Thus approximately one in three hospitalized adults aged sixty-​five or older in the United States will have a family member or significant other placed in the position of having to make potentially life-​and-​death health-​care decisions for them within just two days of admission to the hospital. For those of us in and around health care, this prospect should be more than just a little unsettling. It certainly is for me. Indeed, in my experience with ethics consultation over the past twenty years, the most common triggers for a consult are problems related to surrogate decision-​making. Even a cursory look at media reports (e.g., Terry Schiavo in Florida, 2005; Barbara Wise in Ohio, 2013; Marlise Munoz in Texas, 2014) and the increasingly voluminous academic literature suggests that my experience is far from idiosyncratic (Silveira, Kim, and Langa, 2010; Sulmasy and Snyder, 2010; Barrett and Scales, 2012; Hickman, Daly, and\n\n08:47:34.\n\n28 Mark P. Aulisio Lee, 2012; Iverson et al., 2012; Majesko et al., 2012; Schenker et al., 2012; Sullivan et al., 2012; White et al., 2012; Iverson et al., 2013; Song and Ward, 2013). Why is surrogate decision-​making so fraught with problems, and what can be done to address them? In this article I attempt to answer these questions, offering at least a partial explanation for the first and some suggestions for the second. I consider the historical context in which surrogate decision-​making emerged by examining two key cases in the rise of the patients’ rights movement that involved surrogate decision-​makers, the landmark cases of Karen Quinlan and Nancy Cruzan. I argue that the success of the patients’ rights movement, spurred by Quinlan and Cruzan and championed in the rise of bioethics, has had some very negative unintended consequences; chief among these are problems associated with surrogate decision-​making. I then consider why surrogate decision-​making is so problematic and offer some suggestions as to how the surrogate’s role might be reconceived, lest we be washed away by the coming silver tsunami and the wave of distraught surrogate decision-​makers it will inevitably bring.\n\nA Tectonic Shift: The Rise of Patients’ Rights and the Erosion of Physician Power On March 31, 1976, Joseph and Julia Quinlan won the right to have what was thought to be life-​sustaining respirator support withdrawn from their twenty-​two-​year-​old daughter, Karen (In re Quinlan, 1976). The New Jersey Supreme Court ultimately arrived at its decision by interpreting the US Constitution’s implied right to privacy—​the right of a person to decide personal issues without governmental interference—​to be sufficiently broad to allow the family of a dying patient to make even a life-​or-​death decision on the patient’s behalf (In re Quinlan, 1976; Annas, 1990; Pence, 2004). Although Quinlan, to the surprise of many, lived another ten years after the withdrawal of the respirator (she was weaned from the respirator and continued to receive nutrition and hydration through a feeding tube), the focus of controversy at the time was on whether withdrawal of the respirator was a form of “killing” rather than “letting die” (Pence, 2004). Indeed, a representative of hospital administration is reputed to have said to Julia Quinlan, “in this hospital we don’t kill people” in explaining the hospital’s opposition to removing respirator support (Quinlan and Quinlan, 1977). While this alleged comment sounds outrageous to us today, it is easy to forget almost forty years later that the official position of the American Medical Association and the practice standards of the day, such as they existed, supported the hospital’s position. At the time, “withholding” life-​sustaining treatment was considered to be sometimes justifiable, but withdrawing that same treatment, once initiated, was viewed as a form of “euthanasia” or “mercy killing,” the equivalent of “murder” (Pence, 2004). In light of this, Karen Quinlan’s physicians not only had ethical objections to withdrawal of\n\n08:47:34.\n\nThe Surrogate’s Role 29 respirator support but also feared a possible malpractice suit or even criminal prosecution for “killing” her (Pence, 2004). It is also easy to forget that the de facto authority to institute and continue life-​sustaining treatment at the time rested primarily with physicians (Aulisio, 2014). The Quinlans poignantly described their ordeal as a “nightmare” as they fought to be allowed to have what they considered to be “extraordinary” treatment withdrawn—​a treatment they said their daughter would not have wanted (Quinlan and Quinlan, 1977; Quinlan, 2005). Joseph and Julia Quinlan’s fight was, in a real sense, a fight for the right to become surrogate decision-​makers for their daughter. In support of this fight, they turned to their parish priest and local bishop and also to the bioethicist Robert Veatch, then staff director of the Death and Dying Group at The Hastings Center, with whom they met three times to discuss the tragic plight of their daughter (Jonsen, 2003). The Quinlans’ nightmare and the interpretation of the right to privacy that granted them the legal authority to make this “private” decision was, sadly and ironically, played out in the most public of ways. As Veatch put it just a few years later: It took the life-​support debate to the front pages and to the lead story of the evening news. It made clear that the physician who happened to inherit a patient in an emergency room did not automatically have custody of that patient and could not automatically insist that life-​support be continued against the wishes of the patient or surrogate. It brought surrogate decision making to the stage front and center. It identified privacy as a decisive legal and moral category. It introduced in a muddled way the concept of an ethics committee for the first time in the public discussion of life-​support. (Jonsen, 2003: 255)\n\nAs Veatch’s comments suggest, it would be hard to overstate the significance of the Quinlan case. The rise of surrogate decision-​making against physician power was yet another manifestation of an underlying a tectonic shift in society’s view of the physician–​patient relationship. A patient’s right to decide what should be done with his or her own body, the right to self-​determination (to paraphrase the language of Justice Cardoza in Schloendorff [1914]—​the often-​cited seminal case for Informed Consent Doctrine in Anglo/​American law [Schloendorff v. Society of New York Hospital]), the core of the increasingly robust notion of informed consent operative in Anglo/​American law and Western medicine was being extended to the refusal of even life-​sustaining treatment. Furthermore, patients would not cede back to physicians their right to “self-​determination” when unconscious and unable to make decisions even where life-​sustaining treatment was involved. The fact that Veatch headed up The Hasting Center’s Death and Dying Group and that he was consulted by the Quinlans shows the extent to which controversy over use of life support and who controls that use had been simmering in the early to mid-​1970s. The Quinlan court’s fear that a flood of life-​support cases was in the offing and its suggestion, albeit “muddled,” that ethics committees might be a judicial alternative only serves to underscore this.\n\n08:47:34.\n\n30 Mark P. Aulisio Immediately following the Quinlan decision, states rushed to pass legislation affirming the rights of competent patients to refuse life support, as well as the rights of surrogates to make decisions on their behalf (Annas, 1990). In 1978 the US President’s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research was established with an expanded scope, going beyond its predecessor to include ethical problems in medicine (not just regulatory issues concerning human subjects research protections). From 1980 to 1983 that group worked on its now deservedly famous report, “Deciding to Forego Life-​Sustaining Treatment,” which, among other things, strongly affirmed (a) the rights of competent patients to refuse unwanted life-​sustaining treatments, (b) the rights of surrogates to make decisions on behalf of incompetent patients, and (c) the potential value of ethics committees as an alternative to the courts in assisting with these cases (US President’s Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research, 1983). Regarding the latter, ethics committees, which were found to be present in only around 1% of US hospitals at the time of the report (Youngner et al., 1983), rapidly expanded to over 60% just four years after its release (Fleetwood, Arnold, and Baron, 1989). Even while Joseph and Julia Quinlan’s ordeal endured, Lester and Joyce Cruzan found themselves trapped in a similar nightmare following a 1983 car accident that left their daughter Nancy in a persistent vegetative state at the age of twenty-​six. The Cruzans sought to have Nancy’s feeding tube removed, arguing that she would not have wanted to be kept alive in this state (Annas, 1990; Annas et al., 1990; Pence 2004). In the public discussion, the rhetoric of “killing” and “murder” characteristic of the Quinlan case gave way to that of “starving to death” on one side and “imprisoning and torturing” by medical technology on the other. Despite this rhetoric, Nancy Cruzan’s legal case focused primarily on the state’s right to set evidentiary standards regarding patient wishes and, only secondarily, on whether “artificial” nutrition and hydration should be viewed as a medical intervention (Annas, 1990; Annas et al., 1990; Pence, 2004). As the Cruzans sought to have their daughter’s feeding tube removed—​in accord, they argued, with her wishes—​ the State of Missouri argued that the Cruzans had failed to produce “clear and convincing evidence” of Nancy’s wishes, thus failing to meet the state’s evidentiary standard for withdrawal of the life-​sustaining treatment on an incapacitated patient (Annas, 1990; Annas et al., 1990; Pence, 2004). Despite the rhetorical flourishes on either side of this controverted case, the wishes of the patient were the focal point of debate, and it is clear that the tectonic shift signaled by Quinlan was still in motion—​patients, not physicians, should control decision-​making. Just as it is easy to forget that Quinlan occurred against a backdrop of American Medical Association prohibition of withdrawing life-​sustaining treatment and powerful physician hegemony in treatment decisions, it is easy to forget that the State of Missouri actually won the Cruzan case before the US Supreme Court. The court ruled that states did indeed have the right to set evidentiary standards with respect to the wishes of a formerly competent but now incompetent patient (Annas, 1990). Thus Missouri’s “clear and convincing evidence” standard, a standard that sat between “preponderance of\n\n08:47:34.\n\nThe Surrogate’s Role 31 evidence” and “beyond a reasonable doubt” in levels of stringency, was not taken to violate Nancy Cruzan’s (constitutional) right to be free of an unwanted medical intervention (Annas, 1990). Although reactions immediately after the decision were mixed, Cruzan remains remarkable for a number of reasons. First, it recognized that competent patients have a constitutional right (“liberty interest”) to refuse even life-​sustaining treatment. Second, it made clear that tube feeding (“artificial” nutrition and hydration) is not different from any other type of medical intervention for the purposes of this right. Third, it affirmed that patients do not lose their right, or “liberty interests,” to be free of unwanted medical interventions simply because they become incompetent (even if, as Justice Sandra Day O’Connor famously put it, the “challenging task of crafting appropriate procedures for safeguarding incompetents’ liberty interests is entrusted to the ‘laboratory’ of the States” (Cruzan v. Director, 1990). Most important for our purposes here, the Cruzan decision gave a huge push to surrogate decision-​making and to what eventually came to be called the advance directive movement (Aulisio, 2014). As Annas put it at the time, Since she [Justice O’Connor] agreed that few people will provide explicit instructions, she suggested that everyone appoint a proxy decision maker, and she noted that the Cruzan decision “does not preclude a future determination that the Constitution requires the States to implement the decisions of a duly appointed surrogate.” This will undoubtedly give a well-​deserved boost to durable powers of attorney, and most physicians will properly prefer a real person with whom they can discuss the patient’s options to a written living will that may require interpretation. (1990: 672)\n\nLittle did Annas know that the print would be barely dry on his article before Congress would pass the Patient Self Determination Act (November 5, 1990: Federal Patient Self Determination Act, 1990 [PSDA]) and the State of Missouri would (somewhat mysteriously) find new evidence of Nancy Cruzan’s wishes—​evidence that was, it said, sufficient to satisfy the “clear and convincing evidence” standard and allow for withdrawal of her feeding tube (December 14, 1990). Although public outcry arguably drove each turn of events, that it led directly to the passage of the federal PSDA is beyond dispute. The PSDA mandated that health-​care organizations receiving Medicare or Medicaid funds 1. Give [patients] at the time of admission a written summary of: • [their] health care decision-​making rights.
