NOTE TAKING PROBLEM Rosa Parks has been called the mother of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement. Rosa Parks By Lynn Paul Rosa parks was very important in U.S. history. She has been called the mother of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement.\n\n4. NOTE TAKING CORRECTION 1 “Rosa Parks has been called the mother of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement.” Rosa Parks By Lynn Paul Rosa parks was very important in U.S. history. Some historians dub her “the mother of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement” (“Rosa Parks”).\n\n5. 1 Rosa Parks is considered the starter of the civil rights movement because of her bravery when she wouldn’t relinquish her seat on a bus for a Caucasian man. Rosa Parks By Lynn Paul Rosa Parks is an important symbol of the civil rights movement. She showed bravery when she wouldn’t relinquish her seat on a bus for a Caucasian man.\n\n6. 1 • Rosa wouldn’t let a white man have her seat on the bus • Inspired others to join a bus boycott • Bus boycott triggered other civil rights activists and actions that started the civil rights movement Rosa Parks By Lynn Paul Rosa Parks is an important symbol of the civil rights movement. Some people say that when refused to let a white man take her seat on a bus she started a chain of events that started the civil rights movement.\n\n7. HERE’S AN EXAMPLE FROM PURDUE’S ONLINE WRITING LAB The original passage: Students frequently overuse direct quotation in taking notes, and as a result they overuse quotations in the final [research] paper. Probably only about 10% of your final manuscript should appear as directly quoted matter. Therefore, you should strive to limit the amount of exact transcribing of source materials while taking notes. Lester, James D. Writing Research Papers. 2nd ed. (1976): 46-47. A plagiarized version: Students often use too many direct quotations when they take notes, resulting in too many of them in the final research paper. In fact, probably only about 10% of the final copy should consist of directly quoted material. So it is important to limit the amount of source material copied while taking notes.\n\n8. The original passage: Students frequently overuse direct quotation in taking notes, and as a result they overuse quotations in the final [research] paper.

Therefore, you should strive to limit the amount of exact transcribing of source materials while taking notes. Lester, James D. Writing Research Papers. 2nd ed. (1976): 46-47. Good notes: • Many students’ research papers contain too many quotes • Quoting less during note taking can help avoid the problem • Generally, less than 10% of a final paper should be quotes A legitimate paraphrase: In research papers students often quote too much. Taking good notes can help solve the problem. Most notes should be paraphrased, and direct quotes should only be used when they are really needed (Lester 46-47).\n\n9. EXPLAIN THIS MYSTERIOUS PARAPHRASING PROCESS…. 1) 2) 3) 4) Re-read the original source until you thoroughly understand it Stop looking at the original source! Use your own words and sentence structure to capture the idea you’ve read. Double check your paraphrase to make sure that a) it’s accurate and b) it’s substantially different from the original quote\n\n10. QUOTE FROM THE ARTICLE “DOUGLAS MACARTHUR” IN THE AMERICAN HISTORY DATABASE “As a leader, MacArthur possessed a brilliant grasp of strategy and enjoyed greater success at coordinating massive land, sea, and air forces than any of his contemporaries. His World War II conquests were numerous, impressive, and achieved at relatively little cost.”\n\n11. QUOTE FROM THE ARTICLE “BOB DYLAN” IN THE AMERICAN HISTORY DATABASE “A central figure in the folk movement of the 1960s and 1970s, Bob Dylan, first known for protest songs, moved far beyond the narrow tradition of folk music and ultimately influenced the content of rock as well. Some people considered him to be the \"poet laureate\" of his generation.”"
