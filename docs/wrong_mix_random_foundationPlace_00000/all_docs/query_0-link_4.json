        "text": "Notes\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n1. Callaci, “On Acknowledgments.”\n\n2. Geertz, “Deep Hanging Out.”\n\nIntroduction\n\n1. I use the word American here very reluctantly throughout the book. It conflates the US settler-colonial state with the geological formation that Whites call the Americas and which some of its Indigenous people call Turtle Island. A preferable alternative might be the once popular and provocative “Amerikkka.” Noam Chomsky had once suggested that “American” is used because “United States of America” is not easily made into an adjective; this may be a linguistic accident, but its implications are broad and serious.\n\n2. The capitalization of White in this text may appear disconcerting to some. It is certainly controversial. While this might signal notions related to White power, and some employ the lowercase “white” as a way of taking this power away, I choose to use the capitalized form in this book to denaturalize Whiteness and remind the reader of the social construction of Whiteness. See, for example, Theodore W. Allen, The Invention of the White Race: Racial Oppression and Social Control. Though in this book I focus on the constructedness of Asian Americans, similar care is also required with regards to broad categories such as White, Black, Asian, East, and West.\n\n3. Tachiki and Ono, Roots, vii.\n\n4. Seung, “Asian Americans,” 181.\n\n5. I carefully unbound the reader, scanned the pages, and have made it available online; more was generously provided from the archive by the Graduate Theological Union.\n\n6. While liberation theology and theology of liberation are often used interchangeably, as I shall also do, it is at times useful to refer to liberation theology as the historical form that theologizing about liberation has taken, whereas the latter might be better understood as something that is always in process, ongoing.\n\n7.

I use the term refugee in a sense broader than, say, that of the United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHCR), and instead as a particular kind of exile, so as to include asylum seekers, undocumented persons, and migrants who have unwillingly left their home countries. In particular, they may be on either side of the state border of the country in which they seek refuge. For a more nuanced theorization, see, for example, Gandhi, Archipelago of Resettlement.\n\n12. The use of the term the poor here is a crude analytic, unless qualified. In this book, I use the word in the thick, substantive sense of the Tanakh—namely, the Hebraic root ani (עָנִי), variously referring to the afflicted, lowly, humble, and poor, also ebyon (אֶבְיוֹן), referring to the poor or needy. It corresponds to the Greek ptochos (πτωχός), describing a beggarly posture. Taken together, the poor refers to both a material and metaphysical position, not reducible to a class analysis: “The anawim—the scum and refuse of society—have, like all dung, a contradictory status: the more they reveal dissolution and decay, the more fertile they become. . . . In embracing its anawim, a society is embracing its own death; in the act of opening itself to its absurdities it is bound to disintegrate, since it survives only by excluding these from its precariously maintained world of meaning.” Eagleton, The Body as Language, 70–71.\n\n13.

Sometimes referred to as ELAB (Extradition Law Amendment Bill).\n\n16. In England, for comparison, Asians are to this day generally assumed to be of South Asian origin and in the 1970s identified with political Blackness until the rise of Islamophobia in the late 1980s fractured this alliance. See Ramamurthy, Black Star, and Modood, “Political Blackness and British Asians.” This separation can be seen in the now-outdated acronym BAME (Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic), reminiscent of the term BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and Persons of Color).\n\n17. Those in the nonprofit world will note the ironic use of “riches.” The competition for grants has been darkly referred to as the “nonprofit Hunger Games,” in reference to the popular young-adult dystopian novel Hunger Games. Even so, and despite devastating critiques of the nonprofit industrial complex, it continues to be the main channel of Asian American organizing.\n\n18. Another possible formation is Third World liberation theology, following historian Gary Okihiro’s Third World Studies: Theorising Liberation, but to the uninitiated the term Third World seems an anachronism, obscuring more than it enlightens. Admittedly, Asian American is also subject to this charge, though arguably to a lesser degree.\n\n19. The terms Global South and Global North perhaps obscure more than they illuminate, if viewed primarily as geographical designations, especially as I will consider the flows of migration and transnationality whereby South and North are mutually constituted.\n\n20. Wilmore, “A Revolution Unfulfilled”; Fernandez and Segovia, A Dream Unfinished.\n\n21. It should be clear by now that I am writing from a particular Judeo-Christian theological perspective. I use it as my own point of entry, but there is much to be said from the perspectives of other spiritual and religious traditions. On the streets there is little we can assume about each other, and the conviviality arises precisely in discovering the commonalities and differences that define us.\n\n22. Kim et al., “Asian American Religious History,” 362: “Indeed, in charting the intellectual roots of the subfield of Asian American religions, at least one significant stream can be traced to the development of Asian American theologies of liberation, which spawned a series of networks developed for Asian American ministers and scholars.” The authors point to PACTS, founded in 1972 by Lloyd Wake and Roy Sano; the Pacific Asian North American Asian Women in Theology and Ministry (PANAAWTM), founded in 1984 by Kwok Pui-Lan and Letty Russell; and the Institute for Leadership Development and Study of Pacific and Asian North American Religion (PANA Institute), which began in 2000 by Fumitaka Matsuoka.\n\n23. The suffix e here reflects the current trend within Spanish-speaking LGBTQIA+ communities, such as in Latine as a gender-neutral alternative to Latinx commonly used in English-speaking communities. While the use of Latinx has entered mainstream English in the last decade, it has gained little traction within Spanish-speaking populations itself, in part due to its difficulty in pronunciation and lack of generalizability to other gendered words such as amigxs, whereas the suffix e has allowed for smoother linguistic transitions such as amiges and the gender-neutral, third-person pronoun elle interpolating the masculine el and feminine ella.\n\n24.

Whereas Cone’s Black theology of liberation comes as a natural inspiration, my heavy reliance on the work of the Martinican psychiatrist and revolutionary Fanon may be surprising to some. Fanon’s Wretched of the Earth was a crucial text for anti-colonial revolutionaries across the Third World while his Black Skin, White Masks is a key reference for the newer Afro-pessimist school of thought. The first primarily concerns revolutionary struggle; the second concerns psychoanalytic dimensions of anti-Black racism. In articulating an Asian American theology of liberation, both of these powerful works will help ground our thinking and acting.\n\n49. Cone, A Black Theology of Liberation, 40.\n\n50.

A notable exception is the work of Wonhee Ann Joh and Nami Kim, who have argued for a critical theology that “considers the tasks of Christian theology in relation to critical studies of US imperialist militarism in Asia,” providing a theological interrogation of United States militarist expansionism rationalized through specifically Christian language that further buttresses notions like the White man’s burden, manifest destiny, the civilizing mission by the West, and the broader role of Christianity in empire-building.

In arguing against a pluralistic theology of difference (a potential pitfall of inculturation projects such as Pieris’s), Kwok Pui-lan has proposed instead a “postcolonial theology of religious difference” that attends to the transformation of religious symbols and institutions in migration, exile, diaspora, and transnationalism, drawing attention to hybridized religious identities in the new contexts, which cannot be pinned down by fixed and reified notions of religion and how patriarchal relations in the religious arena intersect with and are transformed by colonial and other unequal relations.

By the time the ban ended in January 2021 after Joe Biden’s inauguration, it had mostly faded from public consciousness. The Biden administration also largely ended the detention of migrant families in favor of surveillance technologies such as ankle bracelets and traceable cellphones, but in March 2023 announced that it was considering reinstating family detention again as a public health measure known as Title 42 that has allowed authorities to swiftly expel migrants expires in May.\n\n2.

According to 2019 data, those of Chinese (24 percent), Indian (21 percent), Filipine (19 percent), Vietnamese (10 percent), Korean (9 percent), and Japanese (7 percent) make up the majority (85 percent) of Asian Americans, the remaining national origins each making up 2 percent or less. See Budiman and Ruiz, Key Facts about Asian Origin Groups in the US.\n\n5. Here I am referring to Asia as the geographical landmass designated by early colonial powers. While this definition is open to being challenged, it remains one the operational definitions in popular discourse despite its fraught meaning.\n\n6. The “brown paper bag test” refers to colorism within the Black American community, particularly in the twentieth century, where allegedly only those whose skin was lighter or the same as a brown paper bag were granted admission or other privileges.\n\n7. Ignatiev, How the Irish Became White; Brodkin, How Jews Became White Folks and What that Says about Race in America.\n\n8. This statistic can be calculated directly from the preceding data. See also Ramakrishnan and Shah, “One Out of Every 7 Asian Immigrants Is Undocumented.”\n\n9. Budiman and Ruiz, “Key Facts about Asian Americans, a Diverse and Growing Population.” At the same time it is interesting to compare the increases relative to 2013–2015 survey data.\n\n10. A 2018 census bureau study noted that Asians, relative to Black, White, and Hispanic populations, were the least familiar with and likely to fill out the census. It is certainly natural to expect that such Asians would lean lower on the socioeconomic ladder, resulting in data being skewed upward. McGeeney et al., 2020 Census Barriers, Attitudes, and Motivators Study Survey Report.\n\n11. This recounting of exclusionary laws hardly captures the harshness of life under this racial regime and should be supplemented by the broader anti-Chinese sentiment during this period. Most notable is the 1871 massacre in Los Angeles, involving the lynching of seventeen Chinese men by a mob of over five hundred people, the largest mass lynching in US history. (See, for example, Zesch, The Chinatown War.) Also in 1885, at least twenty-eight Chinese miners were massacred in Rock Springs, Wyoming, setting off a wave of further anti-Chinese violence in the Pacific Northwest. But even these killings are eclipsed both in terms of number and historical memory by the massacre of over three hundred Asian Mexicans, largely Cantonese and Japanese, in Torreón over the course of three days in March 1911. See, for example, Herbert, The House of the Pain of Others.\n\n12. Indeed, the Amerasian is derivative of the earlier Eurasian, produced in turn by European colonialism in Asia.\n\n13.

Free native Filipinos were classified as indios rather than chinos or negros. They were the first to be prohibited from enslavement under the Spanish Crown in the 1540s. The Catholic Church came to associate chino slaves with indios, embracing them as missionary targets and eventually ceasing to view chinos as slaves. Free Filipinos were sometimes called Indian chinos, lending to the blurring of boundaries between indios and chinos. For an account of this complex history, see Seijas, Asian Slaves in Colonial Mexico.\n\n22. Lee, The Making of Asian America, 24.\n\n23. One striking outlier is the story of an enslaved South Asian turned popular saint Catarina de San Juan in Puebla, Mexico. Much has been written about her, including the early hagiographies of Alonso Ramos and José del Castillo Grajeda. Catarina is said to have been abducted at about nine years old by Portuguese enslavers from the western coast of India around 1610, sold at a market in Manila, and brought to the port of Acapulco in 1619. From there she was made to walk a difficult road, the vía de china to Mexico City, then to Puebla. She was first purchased by a Portuguese merchant and his wife. After they died, she was left free but moneyless and became the domestic servant of a neighborhood priest. From early on she had adopted Christianity, the religion of her masters, and become the model of piety and an exemplary captive, dutifully bearing the physical burdens of bondage to free her soul. By the time of her death in 1688, Catarina was considered a beloved popular saint by the residents of Puebla, who sought to have her beatified. Notably, the contemporary Juana Esperanza de San Alberto was similarly famous for her piety, but her African ancestry was likely seen by the poblanos as an insurmountable barrier to sainthood and they never advocated for her canonization.\n\n24.

In 1975, a White driver hit a parked car in Manhattan Chinatown and drove off, while a crowd of witnesses followed the driver past a nearby police station. When the police tried to control the crowd and knocked over a teenager, Chinese American architectural engineer Peter Yew tried to intervene, an act for which he was arrested, stripped, beaten, and charged with a felony. The incident ignited demonstrations numbering in the thousands—twenty thousand, by one account—and further clashes with the police.\n\n35. Kim, “A Conversation with Chol Soo Lee and K. W.

The critique in this book of the Israeli settler state that I make is an anti-settler position, not an anti-Semitic one. A critique of an ethnostate should not be conflated with a critique of a people group. Moreover, though the Semitic race was first coined by the Göttingen School of History in the early 1770s to describe the descendants of Shem, its modern usage within linguistic and archaeological anthropology refers to a broader geographic and cultural designation, such that the Israel–Palestine conflict might be better understood as an intra-Semitic issue. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that even as anti-Asian sentiment has been on the rise, so has anti-Jewish violence (a more accurate term than anti-Semitism). As with anti-Asian racism, it is also possible and needful to historicize anti-Jewish racism; I do not undertake this but do explore their overlap in chapter 8.\n\n41. Such conflicts have much to do with Asian Americans, as seen in the politics behind the May 2022 mass shooting at Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church by David Chou, killing one and wounding five others. It reveals the deep geopolitical tensions that carry over to the United States. Born and raised in Taiwan, Chou opposed Taiwanese independence from China and viewed himself as an angel of death, destroying Taiwanese independence. See, for example, Hioe, “Confusion About ‘Chinese’ or ‘Taiwanese’ Identity of Gunman after Shooting at Taiwanese Church in California”; and Yang, “The Laguna Woods Shooting Wasn’t Driven by Anti-Asian Hate.”\n\n42.

Twenty years earlier, sixteen-year-old Yong Xin Huang was killed in Brooklyn by an NYPD officer who shot him in the back of the head. Huang was shooting a pellet gun at a friend’s house when the neighbor called the police. The officer was not indicted. Huang’s older sister, Qianglan Haung, spoke in support of Akai Gurley and said in an interview that she feels her family never received the same support from Asian Americans as Liang had.

The Hmong American community, though similarly divided, was much less outspoken. If anything, Hmong support for Black lives was more prominent in media coverage and protests.\n\n7. Moreover, as Jonathan Tran argues, the model-minority myth refutation cottage industry has tended to remythologize the myth itself by effectively bracketing political-economic considerations. For example, counterarguments that rely on disaggregating Asian American demographics follow a deficit model while ignoring the opportunity hoarding that also takes place.

Uyematsu, “The Emergence of Yellow Power in America.” Today the notion of Yellow Power, even as it has been invoked again in solidarity with Black uprisings in 2020, is inadequate at best to describe the complexity of what constitutes Asian Americans and how their solidarities are to be represented. The 1969 slogan “Yellow Peril supports Black Power” was revived in an attempt to offer a form of solidarity connecting the racist attacks against East Asians during the coronavirus pandemic in the United States with the George Floyd rebellion against police killings of Black people but ends up flattening the incommensurable forms of violence. For example, a picture of Aoki holding this slogan circulated widely during this resurgence of interest.\n\n17. Okihiro, Third World Studies, 15.\n\n18. Lee, The Making of Asian America, 375.\n\n19.

In attempting to draw directly from Cone’s Black theology of liberation, it is necessary to qualify the use of it in light of Asian American subjectlessness. I argue that it is possible to historicize and even deconstruct Blackness without losing the ontological argument—the fact of being and nonbeing, human and nonhuman. Here Fanon’s interpretation is most expedient: Blackness is as an intersubjective reality, a racial epidermal schema that objectively exists as melanin but functions variously according to social construction. Similar remarks can be made of Asianness, which I revisit in Chapter 8.\n\n22. Cone, For My People, 155.\n\n23. Cone, 167.\n\n24.

Compañero, or compa for short, carries different connotations to camarada in Spanish depending on national history. Both translate to “comrade.” The former tends to have more socialist leanings, while the latter more militant communist, sometimes fascist, leanings.

The phrase “We are the 99%” originates in the 2011 Occupy Movement, generally referring to the enormous wealth inequality between the richest 1 percent of the US population and the rest. While this is a catchy slogan, and despite the incontrovertible fact that the wealth of the ultrarich does indeed eclipse the rest, it still elides the gradation of inequality pointed out by Matthew Stewart’s book The 9.9% and many others. In particular, many Asian Americans find themselves in the upper-middle class—according to one definition, the fourth-highest income quintile, above the middle and below the wealthiest, between roughly $85,000 and $140,000 in annual household income; other possible measures might involve wealth, including homeownership. By the former measure, we might call the “economic masses” those around or below median household income or personal income, around $67,000 and $35,800, respectively, according to 2020 statistics. At the same time, what economic statistics do not see are (1) those whose wealth is not primarily gained through income and (2) what Marxists refer to as the lumpenproletariat—the underclass of undocumented, unemployed, incarcerated, and the like.\n\n11. Another possible answer lies in broad arguments around shared anti-imperialisms and the struggle against US militarism in general and in relation to China in particular, but such an approach is often liable to a sort of leftist form of a Monroe Doctrine. The Monroe Doctrine was a US policy in the 1800s that opposed European colonialism in the Americas in favor of US interests. In this context, the danger lies in committing ideological protectionism of a geographic region that one’s connection to is only imagined.\n\n12. Cone, A Black Theology of Liberation, 25.\n\n13.

This perhaps forms a shared locus with Asians born in the United States who feel most strongly the pain of rejection when they are told to go back to their own country. In contrast, first-generation Asian immigrants in the United States often expect to be victims of racism and to not feel welcome, thus slightly complicating the question of perpetual foreignness as it relates to the Asian search for belonging and what a theology of landlessness has to offer.\n\n17.

In fact, there is also the specific Korean medical diagnosis of hwabyung, literally “fire illness,” known as a Korean culture-bound syndrome that can be understood as the somatization of the repression of one’s han. While it is interesting also to note that hwabyung is most often studied in Korean women, perhaps not unlike outdated notions of hysteria, it has also been used as a framework to understand the school shootings at Oikos University in 2013 by One Goh and at Virginia Tech in 2007 by Seung-Hui Cho, both Koreans.

While itself a groundbreaking work, there are important related questions here for practical consideration: To whom should the subaltern be speaking? Are they not already speaking? Perhaps they are simply not being listened to, or may not even want to be heard. If the subaltern manages to speak in the “right” circles (such as Columbia University, Spivak’s institution), are they still subaltern anymore? The challenge of subjectivization is a much more difficult representation. See Spivak, “Can the Subaltern Speak?,” 66–111.\n\n70. Madaling maging tao, mahirap magpakatao.\n\n71.

Cressler and Banks, “Reparations and Religion”; Pega et al., “Unconditional Cash Transfers for Reducing Poverty and Vulnerabilities.” Indeed, a 2020 investigation by the Detroit News revealed that the city had overtaxed homeowners by at least $600 million when it failed to reduce assessed values when property values fell after the 2008 recession. While the city council approved a number of measures in 2023 to benefit overtaxed residents, none of them included direct repayments, arguing that it was unconstitutional to issue direct payments to individuals.\n\n80. A parallel debate concerns who owes these reparations: the descendants of enslavers or non-Black people in general? A possible model that might be held in consideration are the reparations paid to Holocaust survivors and the solidarity tax paid by former Western Germany for the rebuilding of Eastern Germany after 1991.\n\n81.

Related critiques have arisen under the notions of greenwashing and pinkwashing, in which corporations market their products as supportive of environmentally conscious and progressive gender rights, respectively, while exploiting and committing violence against other communities.\n\n83. By the US 2020 census, Detroit was 80 percent Black out of a population of 639,111, trailing after Jackson, Mississippi (80 percent; 153,701), and South Fulton, Georgia (93 percent; 107,436). The next largest Black cities were Memphis, Tennessee (63 percent; 633,104), Baltimore, Maryland (60 percent; 585,708), and Atlanta, Georgia (50 percent; 498,715).\n\n84. Technically, Chin was killed in Highland Park, a separate city entirely within the city of Detroit, which, like Dearborn, refused incorporation into Detroit. In the mid-1900s, Highland Park had a significant Japanese American community that relocated there after their incarceration during the Second World War. Many Japanese companies had branches in Detroit, facilitated in part by the booming auto industry there. Despite the racism that followed the war and the decline of the US auto industry, the Japanese American community found economic success and moved out to form enclaves in majority-White, wealthy suburbs: Novi, West Bloomfield, and Farmington Hills.\n\n85. To the USPS, the address is either occupied and requires mail service or is vacant and does not. An address is deemed vacant if it did not collect mail for ninety days or longer. In addition to occupied and vacant addresses, there are also “no stat” addresses. A “no stat” address is deemed that if it is under construction and not yet occupied or is in an urban area and identified by a carrier as not likely to be active for some time. See, for example, “USPS Reports Decreased Vacancy Rates in Detroit.”\n\n86. As alluded to in Chapter 2, demographic data about Arab Americans is difficult to assess accurately because it is not an official census category, counted officially instead as White, and thus has to be approximated through various proxies.\n\n87. Good, Orvie. Sundown towns are all-White towns—or counties or, in the case of Oregon, the entire state up to 1926—in which “colored people” are to leave by sundown or else. This practice was so widespread that the annual publication The Negro Motorist Green Book, indicating which places were safe to travel to, was widely used as a survival tool.\n\n88.

Thalu is a romanization of the Thai ทะลุ, meaning “to penetrate” or “to go through.” The gas, of course, refers to tear gas.\n\n2. Unno, “‘Thalu Gas.’”\n\n3. DinDeng, “Thalugaz Interview.”\n\n4. The romanized spelling “Thalugaz” is used by their Facebook and Twitter accounts of the same name. There also exists another student group under the name Thalugas, which one of the coordinators of Thalugaz informs me are organized hierarchically and oppose the monarchy but not the state in general. The two are often conflated or confused by outside observers.\n\n5. The historical and political context of Myanmar differs greatly from Thailand, except for the overlapping feature of military coups. Interestingly, but also tangentially, inciting others to commit crimes or conspiracy in order to make an arrest is also a common FBI tactic.\n\n6. Rodney, The Groundings with My Brothers, 22.\n\n7.

Not to mention that the riots were not entirely without communal logic: within many lootings were moments of collective economic redistribution and sharing, not a chaotic free-for-all.\n\n11. Churchill, Ryan, and Jensen, 84–86. At the same time, it might well be argued that armed struggle within the United States, especially for non-White people, is at least as much a suicidal prospect.\n\n12. Churchill, Ryan, and Jensen, 141.\n\n13. Churchill, Ryan, and Jensen, 94.\n\n14. The language of necessity, though, must be exercised with much caution, as it has also been used to enshrine state violence, such as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution of 1964 that allowed authorizing the president to take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force to assist any member of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, and the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) following the 9/11 attacks in 2001 granting the president authority to use all “necessary and appropriate force” against those determined to be involved.\n\n15. Asad, On Suicide Bombing.\n\n16. Whereas Brown’s own appeal to a higher law challenged the state’s monopoly on violence, it was imperative for then governor of Virginia Henry Wise, at a time when the sovereignty of the states was a central issue, to execute John Brown in a manner that enshrined the sovereignty of the commonwealth of Virginia. He did so by ensuring that Brown was protected both from vigilantes who wanted to lynch him and from sympathizers who might attempt to rescue him, and that Brown’s execution would impress upon its witnesses what one commentator called the “awful majesty of the law.” The law of the state was sovereign. Smith, Weird John Brown, 27.\n\n17. Smith, 35–36.\n\n18. Smith, 60.\n\n19. But even attempts to employ political theology can run afoul, such as Carl Schmitt’s insistence on the need for both some sovereign power beyond the system of law and some clear earthly identity for that legal power—a legal system that depends on a sovereignty that exceeds the system itself—all of which led Schmitt to support Hitler’s regime.\n\n20.

Or, as is often the case, because of poverty, debt, and citizenship status many people of color enlist in the army or take up jobs in the carceral system.

On the other end of the age spectrum is the 1989 Cleveland Elementary School shooting in Stockton, California, where a White man shot and killed five children and wounded thirty others, many of whom were Cambodian and Vietnamese refugees. Though little remembered, it was one of the largest shootings at an elementary school before the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.\n\n2. The same day of the incident in New York City, Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker and three congregants were held hostage by British national Malik Faisal Akram at a Texas synagogue, demanding the release of Pakistani neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui, allegedly connected to the Islamic State group. FBI officials called it an act of terrorism and a federal hate crime.\n\n3. Closson and Newman, “Woman Dies after Being Pushed Onto Subway Tracks in Times Square.”\n\n4.

Geng, “On Pepper Spray and Preventing Anti-Asian Violence”; Wong, “Asian Women Don’t Feel Safe in Public.” Yu and Me Books, a Manhattan Chinatown bookstore dedicated to Asian American literature that opened in 2021, gave out free pepper spray to hundreds of people, most of whom were young Asian women.\n\n30.

Also, there is a newer, smaller group of female incels, or femcels, who also believe in the right to have sex. Both male and female incels are structured by heteronormativity: “They feel the same sense of “humiliation and exclusion” that incels do, but they react to those feelings differently. . . .
