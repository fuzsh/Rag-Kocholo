PRINTED IN THE NETHERLANDS NUMEN, Vol. 41 (1994), © E. J. Brill, Leiden SILENT PRAYER IN ANTIQUITY Pieter W. van der Horst Summary In antiquity prayers were said out loud and silent prayer was regarded as an anomalous practice that was looked upon with great suspicion. It was brought into connection with a variety of base motives which it was feared would be strongly objected to by others, foremost among which are wishes to practice magic, to have illicit sex, or to conceal crimes or criminal plans. It was also feared that one’s prayer might be counteracted or undone by more powerful prayers of the opponents. It is only in circles of later (esp. Neo-)Platonism, in the framework of the increasing transcendentalisation in its concept of deity and the corresponding downgrading of anything material or corporeal, that complete silence as the purest form of worship was gradually accepted. This new trend had its influence on the Jewish philosopher Philo and especially on Churchfathers from Clement of Alex¬ andria onwards (and also on some Hermetic and Gnostic circles). But in Jewish and Christian documents there was also another motive that facilitated a gradual acceptance of silent prayer as a respectable form of worship, namely, the biblical story (in 1 Samuel 1) about Hanna’s inaudible prayer that was heard by God. It is the combination of these Platonic and biblical influences that brings about a change of attitude towards speechless prayer in both Judaism and Christianity, but the evidence clearly demonstrates that this was a very slow process, because the old suspicions surrounding this phenomenon did not easily disappear. The ancients said their prayers out loud. There can be little doubt that throughout the ancient world the common practice was to say prayers in a way audible to other persons. The reason simply was that the anthropomorphic conception of the deities one prayed to implied that the gods had ears that worked in much the same way that human ears did. No sound implied no hearing. The represen¬ tations of the large ears of gods in a number of reliefs, 1 the many prayers we know were directed specifically to the ears of a deity, 2 and the frequent references to 6eoi eTtrjxoot (the gods who listen) in ancient literature and on monuments, 3 are eloquent witnesses to this idea. The way prayers are usually mentioned in Greek and Latin literature is such that other people could hear what the pray-er was saying to the god. 4 Nonetheless, from Homer onwards inaudi¬ ble prayers are mentioned in ancient literature, and, however much 2 Pieter W. van der Horst these may have been regarded as a deviation from normal practice, they do make clear that beside the more ‘primitive’ notion that gods could only hear prayers that were spoken out loud, there also existed the opinion that gods, or at least some gods, were able to hear inaudible prayers. When silent prayer is mentioned, in most cases it is undeniably regarded as an anomaly, at least in Greek and Latin sources before the Christian period. As we shall see, in sources from the early Imperial period onwards things begin to change, and in Jewish and Christian sources we also find an increasingly different picture. We will survey the evidence, though not exhaustively, beginning with the pagan material, thereafter dealing with the Jewish and Chris¬ tian sources from late antiquity. Graeco-Roman evidence In our sources we find several motives mentioned for the offering of silent prayer to a deity. In order to facilitate the presentation of the material, we will subdivide the evidence according to these dif¬ ferent motives. 5 Of course, apart from motives, there could be cir¬ cumstances which made it physically impossible to say one’s prayer aloud. A clear instance of this is Homer, Odyssey V 444, where a tremendous wave has swept Odysseus far out to sea; struggling to the surface and trying to reach a river’s mouth, “he prayed in his heart (euijocTO ov xoctoc Gupov) to the god of the stream”, obviously “because he could not speak it in the rough sea”. 6 This is clearly something different than a motive to pray in silence. The motive to pray without words or in an otherwise inaudible way so as to prevent enemies from hearing the prayer is first men¬ tioned now, because this enables us to present here the earliest reference to the phenomenon, namely in Homer, Iliad VII 191-6; after Ajax has been appointed by lot to fight Hector he says: “My friends, the lot is mine, and I am delighted, for I think I shall defeat prince Hector. I only ask you, while I am arming for the fight, to pray to Zeus the royal son of Cronos. But let your prayers be silent (atyfi), so that the Trojans may not overhear you. Or pray aloud (rje xai apcpaSirjv)! We are afraid of nobody whatever”. The great commentator Walter Leaf remarks ad locum : “The idea seems to be, Silent Prayer in Antiquity 3 ‘Do not let the Trojans hear your words, lest they endeavour to counteract your petitions by prayers of their own’; this he immediately revokes by the xoct in 196, virtually = nay ”. 7 The motif that a prayer might be counteracted or undone by more powerful prayers of the opponents is indeed to be found more fre¬ quently. So we find in Euripides, Electra 803-810, where a messenger speaks to Electra: “Then your mother’s lover (Aegisthus) took barley and threw it on the altar with these words, ‘Nymphs of these rocks, I pray that many times both I and my dear wife at home may offer sacrifice with the same fortune we enjoy today; and may Evil oppress my enemies’. Then my master (Orestes) prayed to the contrary, without speaking aloud the words (ou YsycoviaxGov X6you$), that he might possess his father’s house again”. Here it is obvious that Aegisthus was not supposed to hear Orestes’ prayer which was meant to undo his. In Ovid’s Tristia I 1, 27-30, the author says that someone will read his poem in tears, and will pray silently, so that it will not be heard by a malevolent person (et tacitus secum, ne quis malus audiat, optet [v.29]) that the emperor will become more favourably disposed towards him (i.e., Ovid in exile). We may compare here a Jewish text, Judith 13:4: after having inebriated her arch-enemy, Holophernes, with liquor so that he has fallen asleep, “Judith, standing beside his bed, prayed in her heart: Oh Lord, etc.” (axaaa IouSiG 7rapa tt]v xXivtjv ocutou eucev ev xfj xapStoc ocuxfjs- xupie xtX.; cf. 1 Sam. 1:13). The silence of her prayer is here motivated by the fact that the drunken Holophernes should not be awakened by her prayer before she would kill him. 8 Xenophon of Ephesus, Ephesiaca IV 5, states that only when the heroine, Anthia, was out of earshot of one of her kid¬ nappers who wanted to make love to her, she dared to exclaim: “I pray that I may remain the wife of Habrocomes, etc.” 9 A second motive to be discerned is the malevolence of some supernatural powers, especially the Erinyes/Eumenides, who are not prayed to out loud, because mentioning their names (which was indispensible in ancient prayers) might evoke their noxious activities. Hence prayers to these goddesses were often soundless. In Aeschylus, Eumenides 1035 and 1039, in the final song of the chorus, the women sing: “Bless them [sc. the daughters of the night = Eumenides/Erinyes] with silence (e^ocpetre 8£)”. Cf. idem, 4 Pieter W. van der Horst Choephoroi 95-6: (87 \"What shall I say as I pour out these outpour¬ ings of sorrow? ....) Or shall I, without word or rite, in such fashion as my father was put away, pour out this offering for the ground to drink? (fj aTy’ <xt{|j.g>$, oSarcep ouv arccoXeTO TtaTrjp, t<x8’ £xx£o uaa yarcoTOV x^atv xtX.)”, the libation being here, of course, an offering to the chthonic Eumenides. Also Sophocles, Oedipus Coloneus 124- 133: when the chorus sees Oedipus withdrawing into the sacred grove of the Eumenides, they say: \"The old man must be a vaga¬ bond, not of our land, for he would never otherwise dare to go in there, in the inviolate thicket of those whom it is futile to fight, those whom we tremble to name, whom we pass averting our eyes, in silence, without conversation, shaping our prayers with our lips (a$ xpepopev Xeyetv, xal TrapapetPopeaO’ aSepxxcos, acpcovax;, aXoya^ to toc£ socpdcpou axofjux 9povTt8o$ E£vt£<;)”. Also OC 489, where the chorus teaches Oedipus how to pray to these goddesses, namely so \"that the Eumenides, as we call them—which means the gentle of heart—may accept with gentleness the suppliant and his wish. So you, or he who prays for you, address them, but do not speak aloud or raise a cry (obtuaTa cpcovcov {Jir^Se pr]XUVcov [$ 07 |v)”. In this connec¬ tion it should be mentioned that in Athens the priestesses of the chthonic Semnai Theai = Erinyes were called the Hesychides, the ‘Silent Ones’ (e.g. Callimachus, fr. 123). 10 A third important motive to pray in silence was that the pray-er felt embarrassment about what he or she was going to pray for. When in Catullus 64, 103-4, Ariadne sees Theseus arriving at Crete, she feels her desire for him fired and for that reason she prays that he may be saved from the Minotaur: \"Yet not without return or in vain were the gifts she promised to the gods when on her lips she kindled the silent breath of vows” (non ingrata tamen frustra munuscula divis/ promittens tacito succepit vota labello). 11 In Tibullus III 11 = IV 5, 17-20 we read: \"The boy wants the same as me [namely, love or sex], but does not openly pour his heart out. He is too shy to say such things in public. But you, his birth-god, a god from whom nothing is hidden, hear our prayer. What does it matter whether he says it to himself or openly?” (optat idem iuvenis quod nos, sed tectius optat; nam pudet haec ilium dicere verba palam. at tu, natalis, qoniam deus omnia sends, adnue; quid refert, clamne palamne roget?). Cf. also Tibullus II 1, Silent Prayer in Antiquity 5 84-6 “Call him [i.e ., Cupid] aloud to the flock, but in silence to yourselves—or even aloud to yourselves, for the din of the merry crowd and the skirl of the Phrygian pipe will drown the words” (voce palam pecori, clam sibi quisque vocet, aut etiam sibi quisque palam; nam turba iocosa obstrepit et Phrygia tibia curva sono); and III 12 = IV 6, 15-16 (about a mother who teaches her daughter on her birthday a fitting prayer to Iuno Natalis, but the girl has fallen into passion): “Her fond mother dictates the prayer she wants to pray, but the girl knows her own mind, and in the stillness of her heart utters quite a different prayer” (praecipit et natae mater studiosa quod optet: ilia aliud tacita, iam sua, mente rogat). As a final example we mention Juvenal, Satura X 289-291: “When the loving mother passes the temple of Venus, she prays in whispered breath (modico ... murmure) for her boys that they may have beauty, but more loudly, and entering into the most trifling details, the same for her daughters”. 12 In all the instances quoted we see that the reason for embarrass¬ ment is to be found in the fact that what is prayed for lies in the erotic or sexual sphere. 13 Hence it is oct8a>$ or pudor , a feeling of shame, that requires the prayer to be said in silence. “It is above all where love is concerned that man, even ancient man, confided his secrets to a god not to his neighbour”. 14 In this connection it is interesting to notice that this almost certainly accounts for the existence of an “Aphrodite Psithuros, ‘the whisperer’, since it was customary to whisper prayers in her ear”. 15 Seneca seems to refer to such a practice when he says at the end of Epist. X 5: “But I must, as is my custom, send a little gift along with this letter. It is a true saying which I found in Athenodorus: ‘Know that thou art freed from all desires when thou hast reached such a point that thou prayest to God for nothing except what thou canst pray for openly’. But how foolish men are now! They whisper the basest of prayers to heaven, but if anyone listens, they are silent at once. That which they are unwilling for men to know, they communicate to God. Do you not think, then, that some such wholesome advice as this could be given you: ‘Live among men as if God beheld you; speak with God as if men were listening’? Farewell!” (Sed ut more meo cum aliquo munusculo epistulam mittam, verum est quod apud Athenodorum inveni: “Tunc scito esse te omnibus cupiditatibus 6 Pieter W. van der Horst solutum, cum eo perveneris, ut nihil deum roges nisi quod rogare possis palam” [fr. de superstitione 36]. 16 Nunc enim quanta dementia est hominum! Turpissima vota dis insussurant; si quis admoverit aurem, conticescent. Et quod scire hominem nolunt, deo narrant. Vide ergo, ne hoc praecipi salubriter possit: sic vive cum hominibus tamquam deus videbat; sic loquere cum deo tamquam homines audiant. Vale!). 17 A fourth important motive for praying in silence, or at least inaudibly for other persons, is not so much the erotic or sexual nature of what is prayed for, but the otherwise unacceptable or even criminal character of the petition. As my countryman Henk Versnel remarked: “Now, there is nothing very attractive about wishing out loud in a temple magna stante corona that neighbour, rival or emperor should die as soon as possible. Yet this was a normal component of the various wishes expressed and in such cases it was customary to murmur the prayer between one’s lips or to say it in complete silence, so that the connection between silent prayer and evil became a topos in literature”. 18 The well-known curses inscribed on the defixionum tabellae are very illustratative in this respect. Let us here give some examples from literary sources. Martialis, Epigr. I 39, 5-6.8: “If anyone is the protector of what is right, an admirer of all that is honourable, and a man who asks nothing of the gods with inaudible voice, (...), damn me if it isn’t Decianus!” (si quis erit recti custos, mirator honesti/ et nihil arcano qui roget ore deos,/ (...,) / dispeream si non hie Decianus erit). 19 Horace, Epist. I 16, 57-62: “This ‘good man’, which the whole forum and tribunal looks at, whenever with swine or ox he makes atonement to the gods, cries with loud voice ‘Father Janus!’, with loud voice ‘Apollo!’, then moves only his lips, fearing to be heard: ‘Fair Laverna, grant me to escape detection, grant me to pass as just and upright, shroud my sins in night, my lies in clouds!’ ” (vir bonus, omne forum quern spectat et omne tribunal, quandocumque deos vel porco vel bove placat, “lane pater!” clare, clare cum dixit “Apollo!”, labra movet metuens audiri: “Pulchra Laverna, da mihi fallere, da iusto santoque videri, noctem peccatis et fraudibus obice nebem”). Since Laverna is the goddess of theft, 20 the implica¬ tion of Horace’s satyrical picture is clear: it is only in an inaudible Silent Prayer in Antiquity 7 way that one could say a prayer to the effect that one’s misde¬ meanours would not be discovered. 21 In De Benef. VI 38, 1-5, Seneca complains that so many people pray in secret for the same thing (2: omnes enim idem volunt, id est, intra se optant), namely money or gain acquired in a dishonest way. In § 5 he continues: “Yet the prayers of all these men, while well known, are unpunished. Lastly, let every man examine himself, let him retire into the secrecy of his heart and discover what it is that he has silently prayed for. How many prayers there are which he blushes to acknowledge, even to himself! How few that we could make in the hearing of a witness!” (omnium tamen istorum tarn nota sunt vota quam impunita; denique se quisque consulat et in secretum pectoris sui redeat et inspiciat quid tacitus optaverit. quam multa sunt vota quae etiam sibi fateri pudet! quam pauca quae facere coram teste possimus!). A final instance is Pliny, Panegyricus 67,5: “At your instigation, Caesar, the state has struck a bargain with the gods that they shall preserve your health and safety as long as you do the same for everyone else; otherwise they are to turn their attention from protecting your life, and to abandon you to such vows as are taken in secret” (teque relinquerent votis quae non palam susciperentur). Pliny implies that prayers for the health and safety of the emperor will be turned into their opposite when he does not keep to the agreement between himself and the Roman state. However, such prayers will then be uttered non palam. But here we are already touching upon another motive for silent or murmured prayer, namely the practice of magic, black magic in most cases, which is most frequently mentioned in ancient sources as a reason for inaudible praying. There can be little doubt that it was the notorious character of magic in the view of most ancients that made practitioners hide the contents of their prayers, or rather curses and spells; hence these were often said either silently or in a low voice or murmur. It should be said here in advance that in the sources one finds an indiscriminate use of terms like tacita prex or susurrus (the sound made by one speaking in a low voice or a whisper) or murmur. It should be borne in mind here that tacite , ‘silently’, could not infrequently have the sense of ‘in a quiet or low murmur’. 22 For instance, Ovid, Metamorphoses VI 203 and a scholion on Juvenal VI 587 speak about taciturn murmur , a very soft 8 Pieter W. van der Horst (and hence inaudible) murmur. The emphasis is on the fact that what is being said in certain magical prayers cannot be heard in an articulate way by other persons. Most instances are found in Latin poets, presumably because in the early Empire magic began to flourish more than ever before. Ovid, Metamorphoses VII 251-4, writes about the magician Medea in Thessaly: “And when in long low-murmured supplications the deities were appeased, she bade bring out the old exhausted king, and with a spell charmed him to deepest sleep and lay his body, lifeless it seemed, stretched on a bed of herbs” (quos ubi placavit precibusque et murmure longo,/Aesonis effoetum proferri corpus ad auras/ iussit, et in plenos resolutum carmine somnos,/ exanimi similem stratis porrexit in herbis). 23 Ibid . IX 300-1: “She [the god¬ dess of birth, Lucina] barred the birth [of Hercules with Alcmene] and chanted silent spells, spells that held back the birth as it began (sustinuit partus; tacita quoque carmina voce/ dixit, et inceptos tenuerunt carmina partus)”. 24 Ibid. XIV 57-8 (on Circe): “Then only with her witch’s lips she muttered thrice nine times a baffling maze of magic incantations” (... obscurum verborum ambage novorum/ter noviens carmen magico demurmurat ore). 25 Lucan, Pharsalia VI 699-701 (in a setting of magic): “I invoke ... the lowest form of our Hecate, through whom the shades and I may commune in silent utterence (mihi sunt tacitae commercia linguae)”. 26 Horace, Epode V 49 (on a magician’s spell): “What did she say, or rather what did she leave unsaid?” (quid dixit aut quid tacuit?), with a nice self-correction by Horace. Juvenal, Satura VI 539-541 (on Anubis): “His tears and carefully studied mutterings make sure that Osiris will not refuse a pardon for the fault, bribed, no doubt, by a fat goose and a slice of sacrificial cake” (illius lacrimae meditataque murmura praestant/ ut veniam culpae non abnuat, ansere magno/ scilicet et tenui popano corruptus Osiris). Apuleius, Metamorphoses II 28 (about an Egyptian magician who has been summoned to revive a dead body): “At this the prophet was moved, and took a certain herb, and laid it three times upon the mouth of the dead, and he took another and laid it upon his breast in like sort. Then he turned himself to the East and made silently certain prayers to the proud and rising sun, which caused all the people to marvel greatly at the sight of this solemn act and to look Silent Prayer in Antiquity 9 for the strange miracle that should happen” (propheta sic pro- pitiatus herbulam quampiam ob os corporis et aliam pectori eius imponit. tunc orientem obversus incrementa solis augusti tacitus imprecatus venerabilis scaenae facie studia praesentium ad miraculum tantum certatim adrexit). 27 In his Apologia 54,7 Apuleius, who has been accused of magical practices, makes fun of unfounded accusations of magic: “Did you say silent prayers to the gods in the temple? Then you are a magician!” (Tacitas preces in templo deis allegasti: igitur magus es!). 28 Lucian, Menippus 7: a Chaldaean brings Menippus down to visit the underworld; during the trip plenty of use is made of incantations: “He spoke rapidly and indistinctly. It is likely, however, that he was invoking certain spirits ... murmuring his incantations” (emxpoxov xt xocl aaa<p£$ icpOeyyezo. nXrjv ea>xei ye tivoc$ emxaXeiaGat 8atpova$ ... ttjv eTrcpSrjv u7tOTOV0opuaa$). Achilles Tatius II 7: “She moved closer and put her mouth near mine in order to mumble her charm over the wound; she whispered the formula (e([>i0upi£ev). .. ’ ’. And in the great magical papyrus from Paris (PGM IV) we read in lines 744-6 that the magi¬ cian has to say the spell over someone’s head “with a weak voice (<xt6vo) 90oyya>) so that he may not hear it”. 29 As late as the sixth century CE the anonymous Christian author of the so-called Opus imperfectum in Matthaeum remarks on the magoi in Mt. 2: “Diceban- tur Magi lingua eorum, quia in silentio et voce tacita Deum glorificabant. (...) laudabant in silentio Deum tribus diebus”! (MG 56, 637). 30 Finally, a completely new motive to say prayers without words evolved hand in hand with a change in the conception of the nature of deity. It was of course in philosophical circles that this change took its point of departure. Now it should be said beforehand that there had always been Greeks and Romans who believed that gods could hear prayers without words. In Sophocles, Electra 655-8, Clytemnaestra says: “These are my prayers, Lycaean Apollo, hear them graciously. Grant to all of us what we ask. For all the rest, although I am silent, I know you are a God and know it all” (tocut’, & Auxet’ ’'ArcoXXov, iXeoo$ xXuoov / 86$ rcaaiv rjpTv coarcep ei-aiTOupeGa. / toc 8’ aXXa tcocvtoc xai aioo7raxnr}$ epou / e7ca?ta> ae Soupov’ ovt’ e^etSevai). And Cicero, De Divinatione I 129, says that “the minds of the gods, without eyes, ears or tongue are mutually aware of 10 Pieter W. van der Horst what any of them feels or thinks, so that men, even when they wish or vow something silently, have no doubt of being heard” (deorum animi sine oculis, sine auribus, sine lingua sentiunt inter se quid quisque sentiat, ex quo fit ut homines, etiam cum taciti optent quid aut voveant, non dubitent quin di illud exaudiant). And some more passages in this vein could be quoted. 31 But it should be added that this was probably not a widespread belief. It was mainly the later Platonists, with their ever more elevated conception of the purely immaterial, noetic divine world and especially their theologia negativa , 32 which gave a decisive impulse to the new concept of silent prayer as the only fitting means of wor¬ shipping God. To a lesser extent also the Stoics, with their concept of the deity as permeating not only the whole cosmos but also all human beings, contributed to this process. As to the Stoic view, there is the hackneyed quotation from Seneca, Epistula XLI 1: “We do not need to uplift our hands towards heaven, or to beg the keeper of a temple to let us approach his idol’s ear, as if in this way our prayers are more likely to be heard. God is near you, he is with you, he is within you” (non sunt ad caelum elevandae manus nec exorandus aedituus, ut nos ad aurem simulacri, quasi magis exaudiri possimus, admittat; prope est a te deus, tecum est, intus est). Communing with a god who is within you can be accom¬ plished without words, say the Stoics. But it is the Platonic view that turned out to be of a much more lasting influence. The clearest expression can be found in the writings of the Neoplatonists, 33 to begin with Plotinus, Ennead V 1,6: “We first invoke God himself, not in loud word, but in that way of prayer which is always within our power, leaning in soul towards Him by aspiration, alone towards the alone” (0&ov ocutov £7UxocX£(ja(jivoi<; ou Xoya) yeycovto, aXXa ufj c|>uxt) ixxeivaaiv eauxoix; ti<; eux 1 ^ 7ipo<; exeivov, eux^aQai toutov tov xporcov 8uvafx£vou<; fxovous 7upo<; povov). Plotinus’ pupil Porphyry says in his De abstinentia II 34,2: “Let us sacrifice in such a manner as is fit, offering different sacrifices to different powers; to the God who is above all things, as a certain wise man said, neither sacrificing nor consecrating anything that belongs to the world of the senses. For there is nothing material which is not immediately impure to an immaterial nature. Hence neither is vocal language nor internal speech Silent Prayer in Antiquity 11 adapted to the highest god, when it is defiled by any passion of the soul; but we should venerate him in profound silence with a pure soul and with pure conceptions about him” (@£<p pev xco ini react, &<; Tt£ avrjp ao 90 £ £ 9 rj, prjSev xoov ata07)x<£v (xrjTe ©Ufxtoovxes prjxe ereovopaCovxes* ouSev yap eaxtv evuXov 0 fxrj xa> auXco eu0us eaxtv axa0apxov.

There can be little doubt that the ‘certain wise man’ here is the first century philosopher and miracle-worker Apollonius from Thy ana, whose well-known ideas on spiritual sacrifice (in his ITepl 0 t>atoov) would seem to be extrapolated here by Porphyry to prayer. 34 In AdMarcellam 16 Por¬ phyry states that a sage honours god by his silence (ao 90 £ yap avrjp xai aiycov 0eov xtpta (cf. Ep. ad Aneb . 5)). 35 He also quotes an oracle of Apollo to the effect that the gods have to be called upon with “ineffable callings” (xXrjaeatv OKpOeyxxots, in his De philosophia ex oraculis haurienda , ap. Eusebius, PE V 14, 1). Iamblichus claims in De Mysteriis VIII 3 that he is rendering ancient Egyptian wisdom according to the earliest records by ‘Hermes’ on the proper worship of the highest principle, the god of gods, “which can be worshipped by silence only” (0 Sr] xai 8 ta atyfjc; fxovrjs Oepareeuexat). And the late Neoplatonic author Proclus also emphasizes that only by com¬ pletely silencing our whole body may we gain knowledge of the gods (xoxe xa 90 £yptaxa auxcov 8 ta vou yvcoaopteOa povcos, oxav aiyfjacofiev reaaats 7 |[a 6 >v xats acoptaxtxats ataOfjaeaiv, In remp. II 243, 24 Kroll). 36 The same conception can also be found in the Hermetic literature, e.g. in Corpus Hermeticum I (Poimandres ) 30-31 we read in a context of worship of the highest god: rj atcorerj pou eyxoptcov xou aya 0 ou, ‘my silence was pregnant of good things’; and the deity is called upon as “the ineffable, the unspeakable, the one who can only be called upon by silence” (avexXaXrjxe, apprjxe, atcorerj 9 covou[X£ve ). 37 In CH X 5 the beauty of the Good One is incom¬ prehensible (aXrjTixov), a human being can say nothing about it, because the gnosis of it is a divine silence (0eta atcorerj). The unknown God is unknowable, but reveals himself in a contemplative silence. 38 It is clear that the idea of God as pure nous and nooumenon , whose worship hence can only be carried out in a purely noetical, that is incorporeal, way, inevitably leads to a worship in total silence. 39 12 Pieter W. van der Horst We cannot expatiate here on the role and importance of silence in Gnosticism (it falls outside my sphere of competence and interest), 40 but it may be noted that it is significant that in some Nag Hammadi texts the aeon Sophia is even identified with (the hypostasized) Sige (e.g. NHC III 3, 88, 8-9) and that the heavenly ‘masculine female virgin Ioef is called “the silence of silent silence” (NHC IV 2, 55, 18). 41 (And cf. also Irenaeus, Adv. Haereses I 11, 5 on Sige as a divine being among the Gnostics). That a divine being called ‘Silence’ will have been worshipped in silence stands to reason. Now although Platonic influence on various gnostic systems seems undeniable, we certainly need not attribute the importance of silence among the Gnostics to that philosophy alone. There were probably other factors at work here as well, which may derive from the Jewish and Christian traditions. This leads us to the second section of our material, namely the Jewish and Christian evidence. Jewish evidence Although in these two monotheistic religions audible prayer was also the predominant custom, certainly initially, there were right from the start some elements that made for a significant difference. For Judaism the most important factor simply was that in the Bible there was a story about someone praying in silence who, although being frowned upon by Eli the priest, was heard favourably by God. This story is of course the narrative about Hanna in 1 Sam. 1. There Hanna, one of the two wives of Elkana, prays in the tem¬ ple at Silo in a mood of despair because she had remained childless so far, in contrast to the other wife of Elkana. As she continued praying, so the biblical text says, “Eli observed her mouth: Hanna was praying silently; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore Eli thought she was drunk” (1 Sam, 1:12-13 LXX xai £Y£vrj07) ot£ £7iXrj0uv£v 7rpoa£Ux°M'^ vr ) £vg>7uiov xoptoo xai HXt 6 i£p£U£ £<puXaij£v to axopoc atkfjs.

But her prayer that God would bless her with a child was heard, which implied that her words not only were under¬ stood by God but also found favour in God’s eyes. It is not surpris- Silent Prayer in Antiquity 13 ing that, even though this is the only story in the Bible that speaks about silent prayer, this was bound to exert its influence in Jewish prayer practice. The first post-biblical Jewish author to mention silent prayer was the philosopher-exegete Philo of Alexandria. Although he does not reflect on this biblical text, he does speak in a very positive sense about silent prayer, but this is most probably due to his being so deeply steeped in Platonic ideas about God. In De plantatione Noe 126 Philo says: “[Gratitude to God] must be expressed by means of hymns of praise, and these not such as the audible voice will sing (oux ou$ 7 ) yeyoovo$ ocaexat 90 ovrj), but strains raised and re-echoed by the mind too pure for the eye to discern”, a phraseology more reminiscent of the just quoted Hermetic and Neoplatonic passages than of 1 Sam. 1. But in De specialibus legibus I 272: “[The worship¬ pers] honour with hymns and thanksgivings their benefactor and saviour, God, sometimes with the organs of speech, sometimes without tongue or mouth (aveu yXa>TT7|^ xal crcofxaTOc), when within the soul alone their minds recite the tale or utter the cry of praise”, the words “without tongue or lips” are more reminiscent of the words in 1 Sam. 1, which makes one wonder whether perhaps here Plato does meet Samuel, so to speak. But when in De gigantibus 52 Philo writes that we have to contemplate to the Existent (to ov) without speech and within the soul alone (aveu 96 >vfj<; fxovr) c()uxfi), the terminology is so much like what we find in the later Platonists that one suspects that ‘Plato’ was a stronger influence on Philo than ‘Samuel’, here as well as elsewhere. Although Philo should have been rather dealt with in the paragraph on Platonism, we treat him as a Jewish writer because that may help us understand why and how in early Christianity, on which Philo had such a great influ¬ ence, 42 it was also this combination of biblical and Platonic elements that facilitated the acceptance and propagation of silent prayer. Pseudo-Philo, however, does reflect on our biblical passage in his Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum 50:5, where he rewrites the story of Hanna and Elkana: “And Hanna did not want to pray out loud as all people do; for she thought saying: ‘Perhaps I am not worthy to be heard, and Peninnah will then be even more eager to taunt me, ...’ ” (et noluit Anna orare clara voce sicut omnes homines, tunc 14 Pieter W. van der Horst enim cogitavit dicens: ne forte non sim digna exaudiri et erit ut plus me zelans improperet mihi Fehenna). Although the author is aware of the deviation from common practice (as all people do), he tries to give us a glimpse into Hanna’s mind so as to enable us to under¬ stand her complete departure from common prayer practice. It was fear to be even more taunted by her rival than before, if her prayer would have no effect, that makes her pray in silence. Respectable motives will recur in other Jewish reflections on our passage. It is harder to discover what was the motive behind the passage in the Greek Vita Adae et Evae 29:7, where at least a number of manuscripts state that Adam after his expulsion from Paradise says to Eve: “Cry in silence to God: Oh God, have mercy on me!” (aiyoiaa (3o7)aov xco 0£<o* 6 0£O£, tXaa07)xi pot), which is clarified in the Latin version as follows (6:2): “Let no speech come out of your mouth, because we are unworthy to entreat the Lord since our lips are unclean from the illegal and forbidden tree”. Here at least the second quotation makes clear that uncleanness of lips because of the eating of the forbidden fruit is a reason either to pray not at all or to pray in silence; but it has to be added that both versions taken on their own are much less clear than taken together. Josephus tells in Bellum III 353-4 that shortly before his surrender to the Romans he is hiding from the Romans with 40 revolutionary notables from Jotapata. “Recalling the dreadful images of recent dreams, he offered up a silent prayer to God (rcpoacpepet xco 0eco XeXrjOutocv sux^v). ‘Since it pleases thee’, so it ran, ‘who didst create the Jewish nation, to break thy work, since fortune has wholly passed to the Romans, and since thou hast made choice of my spirit to announce the things that are to come, I willingly surrender to the Romans and consent to live; but I take thee to witness that I go, not as a traitor, but as thy minister’.” Much has been said about this embarrassing passage, but for our purposes the relevant aspect is that here we have simply another instance of fear of being heard by others who certainly would have viewed him as a traitor. When we now turn to rabbinic literature, we see that there is a relative scarcity of evidence when we compare it to the enormous bulk of early rabbinic literature as a whole and to the numerous pages devoted therein to prayers said out loud. We find some brief remarks on silent prayer in the Mishna and Talmud treatise Silent Prayer in Antiquity 15 Berakhot, as was to be expected, and a couple of references else- where. 43 Nonetheless they are revealing. Let us begin with the earliest testimony, Mishna Berakhot III 4-5, where we read: “One who has had a seminal discharge recites (the Shema) silently” (lit.: he ponders over it in his heart); he should altogether refrain from the blessings before and after the Shema ; and should he have already started to recite the Tefillah ( = the Eighteen Benedictions) but remembered that he had had a seminal emission, he should not stop the prayer but shorten it. The point here is that reciting the Shema is not praying in the proper sense, because it actually is ‘reading’ of Scripture, 44 so the man who is unclean (because of his seminal emission) may recite the Shema, albeit silently, but because he is unfit for immediate contact with the deity, he may not recite berakhot , the prayers of blessing; and although he may go on with the Tefillah when he remembers too late that he is impure because of a seminal emission, he should absolutely shorten the prayer; breaking it off would be an offence to the deity, but he should beware of staying too long in direct contact with the divine sphere and therefore abbreviate his prayer (by taking recourse to a shortened version of the prayer, tefillah qetsirah ). However, the Mishna also explicitly states that not all rabbis were of the same opinion: Rabbi Judah said that such a man was allowed to say all prayers! 45 We now take a short glance at the Gemara, that is the discussion of this Mishna passage by the Babylonian rabbis of the third through sixth centuries in the Babylonian Talmud (Bavli). In Bavli Berakhot 20b-21a one sees that the mishnaic passage elicits a debate: Rabina says that it demonstrates that silent recitation is equivalent to reciting aloud; otherwise why should he say Shema in silence? But Rav Hisda combats this view: The two are not equivalent, other¬ wise why not let him utter the words, with his lips? And so it goes on about the Shema. But then the rabbis switch to the Eighteen Benedictions, Tefillah. “Tefillah is different because it does not mention the kingdom of heaven” (21a). What does this mean? In the Eighteen Benedictions the address melekh ha^olam, ‘King of the Universe’, does not occur, and that is the reason why, in con¬ tradistinction to the other berakhot , this one can be said to the end when a man suddenly remembers his seminal emission, although 16 Pieter W. van der Horst he should keep it as brief as possible out of reverence. A baraitha in Berakhot 31a teaches that Rabbi Akiva frequently indulged in silent prayer in the synagogue, so great was his concentration (- kawwanah); and in this connection the rabbis refer to Hanna’s example in 1 Sam. 1:13 and add that Solomon’s request in 1 Kings 8:28, “Attend, o Lord my God, to the prayer and the supplication of thy servant, listen to the cry and the prayer which your servant makes before you this day”, demonstrates that there is a difference between an official prayer (said out loud) and a supplication (said in silence). Bavli Sotah 32b is a beautiful passage in that it suggests as a motif of silent prayer the desirability to prevent transgressors from being put to shame: if a person recites the Eighteen Benedic¬ tions aloud, the sinner who confesses his/her sins in the course of prayer, will be put to shame, and therefore it is better that the prayer be said softly. One is reminded of Luke 18:9-14 where the publican is put to shame by the Pharisee in a situation of prayer said out loud. 46 Let me finally refer to some passages in the Midrash on Psalms. In IV 9 we read: “The Holy One, blessed be He, declared to Israel: I say unto you: When you would pray, go to the synagogue in your city; when you cannot go to the synagogue in your city, pray in your open field; when you cannot go to your open field, pray in your house; when you cannot go to your house, pray upon your bed; when you cannot pray aloud on your bed, commune with your heart. Hence it is written: Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still (Ps. 4:5)”. And in XIX 2 silence is called “the height of all praises of God”. 47 Christian evidence Finally the Christian material, in which we see various threads coming together. It was the great commentator of Cicero, Arthur Stanley Pease, who once suggested that the fact that silent prayers were far more generally employed in Christian usage was perhaps due to the influence of such passages as Matth. 6:6. 48 In this passage of the Sermon on the Mount we read that Jesus said by way of instruction for prayer: “When you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father in secret, and your Father Silent Prayer in Antiquity 17 who sees in secret will reward you”. The context makes clear beyond any doubt that this is a warning against ostentatious prayer, but is it an encouragement of silent prayer? Does praying not in the street but in the privacy of one’s own room imply praying in silence? The point would rather seem to be this: “Prayer is for God alone; it requires no human audience. The soul in prayer must be turned only towards God”. 49 The fact that one should withdraw to a place where one is alone would rather seem to suggest that one should look for a place where one’s prayers, spoken out loud, can¬ not be heard by others. So although I am not inclined to follow A.S. Pease in his interpretation of Matth. 6:6, what Jesus says a couple of lines further, “your Father knows what you need before you ask him” (6:8), may indeed suggest that God has no need of human words in order to know what is in their hearts, which is a well- known motif from biblical and post-biblical Jewish sources. 50 Even though this still is definitely not identical to a command to say prayers silently, it is conceivable that such elements in the gospel tradition have facilitated the acceptance of silent prayer as a respec¬ table way of communicating with God. In addition to that, another New Testament injunction, namely Paul’s exhortation to pray con¬ stantly (1 Thess. 5:17) cannot have been meant and understood otherwise than that the believers should be with their hearts in con¬ tinuous contact with God, not that they should say prayers out loud all day. It should be conceded, however, to Pease (although he is not aware of it), that in the exegesis of some of the Church Fathers it is indeed Matt. 6:6 that is used to encourage praying in silence. The impact of Platonism on Christian views of prayer is discerni¬ ble in the earliest Christian writer to discuss silent prayer, Clement of Alexandria. In his Stromateis he devotes a whole chapter (VII 7) to the questions of what sort of prayer the real believer should employ and how it is heard by God. Some quotations may suffice: VII 7, 37, 1 “God does not possess human form in order to hear, nor does he need senses, as the Stoics think, ‘especially hearing and sight, for otherwise he could never perceive something’ ”. VII 7, 37, 3 “And should anyone say that the voice does not reach God, but is rolled downwards in the air, yet the thoughts of the saints cleave not only the air but the whole world”. VII 7, 37, 5 “And what voice should he wait for, he who, according to his purpose, 18 Pieter W. van der Horst knows the elect already before his birth, and knows what is still to be as already existent?” VII 7, 39, 6 ‘ 4 Prayer is then, to speak more boldly, converse with God. Though whispering, consequently, and not opening the lips we speak in silence, yet we cry inwardly. For God hears continually all the inward converse”. VII 7, 43, 4 “God does not wait for loquacious tongues, as interpreters among men, but knows absolutely the thoughts of all; and what the voice intimates to us, that is what our thought, which even before the creation He knew would come into our mind, speaks to God. Prayer, then, may be uttered without the voice”. 51 It is clear that it is not only philosophical motives but also the biblical and Jewish- Christian idea that God knows the thoughts of all men that plays a role here. From about the same period is the passage in the apocryphal Acta Petri 39 ( = Martyrium Petri 10), where Peter has been crucified and from the cross he utters a prayer that contains the following passage: “Now whereas thou hast made known and revealed these things unto me, O word of life, called now by me wood [or: word called now by me tree of life], I give thee thanks, not with these lips that are nailed unto the cross, nor with this tongue by which truth and falsehood issue forth, nor with this word which cometh forth by means of art whose nature is material, but with that voice do I give thee thanks, O King, which is perceived in silence (8ta atyfjs vooujJLEVT]) , which is not heard openly, which proceedeth not forth by organs of the body, which goes not into ears of flesh, which is not heard of corruptible substance, which existeth not in the world, neither is sent forth upon earth, nor written in books, which is owned by one but not by another; but with this, O Jesus Christ, do I give thee thanks, with the silence of a voice (atyf) 9 <ovfjs), wherewith the spirit that is in me loveth thee, speaketh unto thee, seeth thee, and beseecheth thee”. 52 And also in the same period Tertullian ( De oratione 17,3-4) and some decades later Cyprian (De dominica oratione 4-5) stress that God does not so much listen to the voice as to the heart of men: Deus autem non vocis sed cordis auditor est. But it is interesting to see that Tertullian, in order to prove that God can not only see into the hearts of men but also hear their thoughts, refers first to a pagan oracle of Apollo which says that the god understands the mute and hears the one who does not Silent Prayer in Antiquity 19 speak, 53 and only then to a biblical example (namely the example of Jona’s prayer from the belly of the whale), whereas Cyprian instead first refers to Matth. 6:6 and then to 1 Sam 1, Hanna’s example, to drive home the necessity of silent prayer. 54 All this was written by them of course because silent prayer was not , or at least not commonly, practised among their co-religionists. This is also evident from a passage in Hippolytus’ treatise The Apostolic Tradi¬ tion , where he says: “If you are at home, pray at the third hour and praise God; but if you are elsewhere and that moment comes, pray then in your heart to God” (36:2, p. 62-3 ed. G. Dix). Here, of course, also the motive not to provoke inimical gentiles plays a role. That the biblical example of Hanna was not forgotten is clear again from a passage in Cyril of Jerusalem, Procatechesis 14 (from the middle of the 4th cent.): the catechumens are waiting for the individual prebaptismal exorcisms to be finished. The men are to sit together reading aloud or praying. “But let the young women’s group gather in such a way that, whether it is praying psalms or reading in silence, their lips move but the ears of others do not hear. 'For I do not permit a woman to speak in church’ [1 Cor. 14:34, quoted freely]. And let the married woman do likewise, and let her pray and move her lips, but let no sound be heard (xai irpoaeux^ 0 ^ xal toc xiveiaGco, <poovr] 8e prj axoueaGoo), so that Samuel may come, so that your barren soul may give birth to the salvation of God who hears you; for that is what Samuel means”. 55 The interesting thing in this passage is that Hanna’s example is here used (or misused) to enforce the implementation of the apostle Paul’s injunction that women should be silent in the church (con¬ trast Origen’s use of the story of Hanna in De oratione 13). In his exposition of Matth. 6:6 (the text discussed above), Jerome says that on the face of it this verse seems to prohibit only vainglorious praying, but there is more to it: it rather prescribes that one should pray with closed lips, in the heart, just like Hanna did, as we read in the book of Kings (sed mihi videtur magis esse praeceptum ut inclusa pectoris cogitatione labiisque compressis oremus Dominum, quod et Annam in Regum volumine fecisse legimus, In Mattheum I, ad 6:6). Another factor in the Christian development of praying in silence may have been that in and after the fourth century the ideal of 20 Pieter W. van der Horst silence in the early monasteries must have contributed to an atmosphere in which praying silently became more and more acceptable. John Cassian (early fifth cent.), in his Conlatio IX 35, says that monks should pray in complete silence (clauso oramus ostio, cum strictis labiis silentio supplicamus non vocum sed cor- dium scrutatori. ...cum summo est orandum silentio) because otherwise one disturbs others in their prayers (ne fratres adstantes nostris susurris vel clamoribus avocemus et orantium sensibus obstrepamus) and one should also see to it that 4 our enemies’ (here probably the demons) 56 do not get to know what we are praying (ut ipsos quoque inimicos nostros, qui orantibus nobis maxime insi- diantur, lateat nostrae petitionis intentio). Pure prayer can only be conducted in silence. 57 And another monk, Evagrius Ponticus, argues in his De oratione that prayer is the complete expulsion of all thoughts, and glorifies the ideal of silent, even unconscious prayer. 58 But nonetheless one does not at all get the impression that silent private prayer quickly and easily made itself the usual pattern of prayer behaviour in Christian antiquity. In the third century Apostolic Constitutions it is said with some wonder in one of the prayers in the 7th book that God is 4 4 the one who even knows the petitions which are kept silent (6 xoci aiG07too[X£va<; £7ttaTd[xevo$ evTSU^eis, VII 33, 2)”, as if that was something unheard of. It is also striking that a Christian Platonist like Origen throughout his treatise On Prayer takes for granted that prayers were spoken out loud. 59 In De Civitate Dei XXII 8 Augustine tells us a story which definitely conveys the impression that praying aloud was still customary while praying 4 in the heart’ was exceptional. It is only in the early decades of the 5th century that we find the first explicit prescription to pray silently, in John Cassian, but that is meant for monks only. The fact that in the first half of the 6th century the Justinian Novella 137:6 orders the prayers in the administration of the sacraments to be uttered not silently but in such a way that the congregation can hear them, makes one wonder whether the old suspicion of magic where prayers were being said silently still lingered on in that time. 60 To summarize, in pagan antiquity about the turn of the era silent prayer, in spite of all the negative connotations it had always had, Silent Prayer in Antiquity 21 was gaining recognition as a legitimate form of worship, albeit primarily in philosophically influenced circles. This new trend com¬ bined in ancient Judaism and early Christianity with other (partly biblical) motives which facilitated the acceptance of this relatively uncommon phenomenon, but it lasted till the early Middle Ages until it had become accepted in the Church at large, probably because the ancient suspicions surrounding this phenomenon did not easily disappear.

(p. 481): “perhaps she is (...) ashamed to request forma for a boy”. 13 Sudhaus, Lautes und leises Beten 195: “Nicht ernste Besorgnis oder Furcht bewirkt es, dafi die Gebete an Amor oder Venus oft tacita vota bleiben, sondern die atSox;.” Schmidt, Veteres philosophi 57, refers in this connection to Cicero, De imperio Cn. Pompei 16: hoc brevissime dicam neminem umquam tarn impudentem fuisse, qui a dis immortalibus tot et tantas res tacitus auderet optare, quot et quantas dii immortales ad Cn. Pompeium detulerunt. 14 Versnel, Religious Mentality 27. 15 Versnel, ibid. At 27 n. 105 Versnel refers to Eustathius in Od. 20,8 who says precisely why the goddess had this epithet: ixaXetxo 8£, cpacn, cjn0upo<; 8ta to toc<; eu)(op£va<; auTfj 7rpo<; to ou? X£yav). Cf. also Petronius, Satyricon 85,5 (Eumolpius wants to have sex with a young boy while he sleeps): timidissimo murmure votum feci et “domina” inquam “Venus, si ego hunc puerum basiavero ita ut ille non sentiat, crass illi par columbarum donabo”. 16 See also Macrobius, Saturnalia I 7,6. 17 Cf. Clement of Alexandria, Stromateis IV 26, 171,1: “What is it then that the Pythagoreans mean when they command us to pray aloud (pexa cptovfjs eu'x£cj0ai xeXeuouatv)? As it seems to me, not that they thought that the deity could not hear those who speak silently, but that they wished prayers to be right, which no one would be ashamed to make in the knowledge of many”. 18 Versnel, Religious Mentality 26. Versnel also notes that “these phenomena give an additional tragic aspect to a late defender of dying paganism, Libanius, when he says somewhat ironically that the pagan can no longer pray to his gods 7uXrjv fj atyQ xai XavOavwv” {Or. 30, 52); for a full quotation of the Libanius passage see above n. 9. 19 See P. Howell, A Commentary on Book One of the Epigrams of Martial, London 1980, 190: “The Greeks and Romans believed that, if a prayer was to be heard by the gods, it had to be spoken with the lips. So if a person wished to utter a prayer which he did not wish others to hear, he had to whisper it”. Cf. also Per- sius, Sat. II 3-4: “non tu prece poscis emaci quae nisi seductis nequeas committere divis”, with the scholion ad loc.: ideo palam non orant, ne iniqua eorum petitio audiatur. 20 See also the scholion ad locum [quoted in Schmidt, Veteres philosophi 55-6]: Laverna ... est dea furum et simulacrum eius fures colunt, et qui consilia sua volunt tacita; nam preces eius cum silentio exercentur. 21 Cf. Sudhaus, Lautes und leises Beten 196: “Manch antikes Gebet wurde dem modernen Empfinden und Verstehen als heller Wahnsinn erscheinen”. 22 G. Appel, De Romanorum precationibus (RGVV 7,2), Giessen 1909, 210: tacitus is not always = mutus. Thus also Wagenvoort, Orare, precari 201. On the other hand, however, murmur can apparently designate audible speech, see e.g. Firmicus Maternus, De errore 22,1: Tunc a sacerdote omnium qui flebant fauces unguentur, Silent Prayer in Antiquity 23 quibus perunctis sacerdos hoc lento murmure susurrat: Gappelxe puarat xou 0eou aeacoapevoo / eaxat yap r\\\\iXv ex rcovcov acoxTipta. Here the Greek words indicate the content of the murmur. 23 See ad locum F. Bomer, P. Ovidius Naso, Metamorphosen VI-VII, Heidelberg 1976, 268. 24 In a very similar scene in Propertius, Elegies IV 1, 99-102, the mss. read in line 101 the intractable sentence Iunonis facite (or facito) votum impetrabile dixi. Sudhaus, Lautes und leises Beten 186-187, proposed the brilliant emendation tacite , which yields: “In silence I made a vow to Juno that prevailed with her”, so that the woman could give birth, but modern editors and commentators of Pro¬ pertius have overlooked or unduly neglected this emendation. 25 Cf. ibid. 366-7: “Then Circe turned to prayers and incantations and unknown chants to worship unknown gods”. 26 On the lowest form of Hecate, namely in the Underworld, see S.H. Braund, Lucan, Cicil War , Oxford 1992, 285. See also Phars. V 104 “No wicked prayers are uttered there in silent whisper (tacito susurro)”. 27 Cf. Met. I 3 magico susurramine. 28 On this passage see A. Abt, Die Apologie des Apuleius von Madaura und die antike Zauberei (RGVV 4,2), Giefien 1908, 286 [212]. 29 More passages are mentioned by Schmidt, Veteres philosophi 61-65. See e.g. Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica VII 488-489: “With silent spells she had swayed him and inspired long since in him a passion to answer hers” (tacitis nam cantibus ilium/ flexerat et simili iamdudum adflarat amore). And the Codex Theodosianus IX 38,6 (from 381 CE) stipulates that no amnesty may be given to those “who made poisons sought from noxious herbs and murmured over with incantations in dread secrecy”. 30 J. Bidez & F. Cumont, Les mages hellenisees. Zoroastre, Ostanes et Hystaspe d’apres la tradition grecque , 2 vols., Paris 1938, II 285-6, quote this passage. For another Christian picture of a magus , but in a negative sense, see Passio apostolorum Petri et Pauli 8 (p. 229 Lipsius-Bonnet): Simon [Magus] ... incantare atque inmurmurare dira carmina coepit. 31 See e.g. Herodotus I 47,3, where the Pythia says in the name of Apollo xwcpou auvtr)(Jit xoci ou 9 wveuvxo<; axoua). Cf. Seneca, De Benef. II 1,4: “If men had to make their vows to the gods openly, they would be more sparing of them; so true is it that even to the gods, to whom we most rightly make supplication, we would prefer to pray in silence and in the secrecy of our hearts” (vota homines parcius facerent si palam facienda essent; adeo etiam deos, quibus honestissime sup- plicamus, tacite malumus et intra nosmet ipsos precari). The latter passage seems to imply that by the first century CE in some philosophical circles at least silent prayer was beginning to be more and more acceptable. I doubt Wagenvoort’s interpretation of Ovid, Fasti VI 251 in prece totus eram , T was entirely absorbed in prayer’: “Nowhere that I know in the whole of Latin literature before Christian times could we find another example of a man thus riveted in prayer. Nor can it possibly be that Ovid means he prayed aloud ( oravit ). A man riveted in prayer was certainly silent” (H. Wagenvoort, Orare, precari 208). This is probably too much of a Christian interpretation. 32 See R. Mortley, From Word to Silence II: The Way of Negation, Christian and Greek , Bonn 1986. 33 But see also already Numenius ap. Eusebius, PE XI 22,1, where this second century CE Middle Platonist clearly states that contact with the highest deity is impossible if one tries to realize that by means of silencing all senses or corporeal 24 Pieter W. van der Horst activities. Only a mystical silence is fitting; the passage is noted by G. Mensching, Das heilige Schweigen (RGVV 20,2), Giefien 1926, 22. See also O. Casel, De philosophorum graecorum silentio mystico (RGVV 16,2), Giessen 1919. 34 In Praep. Evang. IV 13,1 Eusebius quotes from Apollonius’ Ilept Goat&v the following sentence: (xovq) XP^ 0 rcpo<; <*utov octet T& xpetxxovt Xoya), Xiy Be tw [xrj 8ta axofxaTtx; tovxt, xat rcapa xou xaXXtaxoo xaiv ovtcov t6>v ev rjpiTv atxotTj xayaGa. This ‘better logos that does not go through the mouth’ suggests silent prayer. In that case already Apollonius would have been its advocate, which is not unthinkable, but the historical Apollonius seems to have conformed to traditional prayer prac¬ tice (see G. Petzke, Die Traditionen ilber Apollonius von Tyana und das Neue Testament, Leiden 1970, 212-213) and it is uncertain whether Eusebius had direct access to Apollonius’ treatise (see E. Norden, Agnostos Theos, Darmstadt 1956 ( = 1923), 39- 40 and 343-6). On this passage see further K. Schneider, Die schweigenden Gotter.

Hamman, Das Gebet in der Alten Kirche, Bern etc. 1989, offers as no. 48 a prayer on papyrus from the third century, which he regards as a Christian prayer. Hamman, however, overlooked the fact that the text of this prayer is identical to Corp. Herm. I 31! 38 See A.-J. Festugiere, La revelation d’Hermes Trismegiste IV, Paris 1954, 76-7 (70-7 is a paragraph titled Dieu est incomprehensible, indefinis sable, indicible ). A very striking ancient Egyptian parallel ( Instruction of Any 4) to the Hermetic ideas about silent worship is adduced by G. Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes , Cambridge 1986, 70 (who owes it to J.-P. Mahe, Hermes en Haut-Egypte II, Quebec 1982). 39 R. Mortley, From Word to Silence, 2 vols, Bonn 1986, II 251: “To say that God is unknowable, incomprehensible, unspeakable, seems to constitute an approach which will perfectly well accommodate the call to silence”; although he adds that “the way of silence is a far more radical renunciation of language than is the via negativa” (252). 40 See R.

Brill, Leiden A VENTURE IN CRITICAL ISLAMIC HISTORIOGRAPHY AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ITS FAILURE Muhammad Qasim Zaman Summary The concern to acquaint the Muslims of India with the earliest history of Islam, and to help them become better Muslims, has characterised the Nadwat al- c Ulama’s historical scholarship since its inception in 1894. This paper concen¬ trates on a monumental study of the life and achievement of the Prophet, the Sirat al-Nabi , (7 vols., 1918-1980), produced by two distinguished scholars associated with the Nadwa. Planned as an authoritative presentation of the Prophet Muham¬ mad’s life, the Sirat al-Nabi sought to answer Western scholarly criticisms on the Prophet, and remove all religious doubts perceived as having an unsettling effect on Muslims in British India. A clearly reformist concern, viz. to invigorate the Muslims’ religious identity by reaffirming their link with their sacred history, guided the conception and execution of the project. Although there initially was a conspicuous concern to maintain high standards of critical historiography, it was gradually nudged out by the reformist outlook. By the time the Siyar-i Sahaba series was initiated in the 1930s—with the purpose of showing how the Prophet’s life and conduct shaped those of his Companions, who in their own right could thus serve as moral guides—virtually all pretensions to critical historiography had manifestly been abandoned. Historiography had given way, the more glaringly in the Siyar-i Sahaba , to hagiography. For all its methodological and other deficiencies, however, the Sira historiography of the Nadwa is of importance for two main reasons: it has served as a vehicle for the expression of reformist concerns, a way of responding to the dilemmas which the authors of these works perceived as confronting Indian Muslims; and it has been a medium through which a continuing effort has been made to acquaint Muslims with their sacred past, and with Islam itself. Introduction In the history of Muslim historiography in modern South Asia, the name of the Nadwat al- c Ulama’ figures prominently. 1 Founded in 1894, the role of this institution was ambitiously conceived as that of a platform which would bring together religious scholars ( c ulama’) of various sectarian persuasions; try to revitalize the active role they played in public life in the past; defend Islam against Western intellectual onslaught; and preserve the traditional Islamic heritage. 2 In reinvigorating the role of the c ulama’, or even in bringing them together, the Nadwa was unsuccessful from the A Venture in Critical Islamic Historiography 27 start. But in trying to preserve interest in traditional learning, striv¬ ing to check the impact of the West on contemporary Indian Muslim society, and in generating a strong interest in historical studies among graduates of its Dar al- c Ulum, the Nadwa fared better. This paper seeks to study an aspect of the Nadwat al- c Ulama’s historical interests, and their nature and motivations. The study is limited to an explication of the ways in which, in a millieu wherein Muslim religious life was perceived as being confronted with exter¬ nal (especially Western) threats, Islamic historiography was made the vehicle for the expression of moral and reformist ideas. The classic work written to serve this purpose, and one which still remains practically unsurpassed in South Asian Islamic historiography, is the Sirat al-Nabi (The Life [and Conduct ] of the Prophet [Muhammad]) 3 by Shibll Nu c mam (1857-1914) and his pupil, Sayyid Sulayman Nadwl (1884-1953). 4 It is primarily with this work that the following pages will be concerned. Though some¬ thing will be said about the contents of the volumes comprising this work, the basic concern is to analyze the historiographical approach involved here, that is, the choice and handling of the sources and the motivations underlying such procedures in so far as these motivations can be perceived. Reference would also be made, though more briefly, to another of the Nadwa’s more ambitious projects, the Siyar-i Sahaba , a multi-volume series written, inter alia , by Mu c In al-din Ahmad Nadwl (a pupil of Sulayman Nadwl). Though different in scope, and unequal to the Sirat al-Nabi in qual¬ ity, it carries the purpose of the latter further in being inspired by a similar vision and in being an exemplification of the arguments and ideas set out in the Sirat al-Nabi. Before proceeding to the subject of our enquiry, a few words about Shibll and the Nadwa seem to be in order. Much of the credit for the Nadwa’s historical interests (and some for the Nadwa’s existence itself) goes to Muhammad Shibll Nu c mam (1857-1914), 5 a well-known scholar and historian who, before he came to join the Nadwa in 1904 (though he had actively participated in its establish¬ ment and been informally associated with it), had taught for sixteen years (1882-1898) at the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, Aligarh. Shibll, like many of his contemporaries, was acutely con- 28 Muhammad Qasim Zaman scious of the threat to Islam in India posed by the end of Muslim political dominance there, the exposure of Muslims to the West and its impact on them, Western criticism of Islam and the Prophet Muhammad, and—not least—the Hindu revivalist and conversion movements. 6 The response of the late-19th century Indian c ulama’ to such perceived threats took the form, as Francis Robinson has perceptively observed, of inculcating and disseminating 44 better religious knowledge. Muslims should know much more clearly and much more certainly than before how to behave as Muslims...If Islam could no longer be supported by the swords of Muslim princes, it could now be supported by the enhanced religious understanding of Muslims themselves.” 7 For his part, Shibll too sought to revive the interest of educated Muslims in the Islamic tradition. He wanted to reform Muslim education in such a way that, while Western learning would be accorded recognition, tradi¬ tional Muslim sciences (taught in ways commensurate with the exigencies of changing times) would be developed rather than discarded. Further, he proposed to systematically refute Western criticism on Islam, and to present its “heroes” with the intention of generating a certain confidence of the Indian Muslims in their past. This vision Shibll tried to impart to the Nadwat al- c Ulama\\ Shibll appears to have conceived of the Nadwa as striking a mid¬ dle path between “the extremes of Aligarh’s secularism and Deo- band’s conservatism.” 8 His world-view, though essentially tradi¬ tional, 9 did nevertheless accomodate some “modernistic” tendencies, such as a recognition of the need to learn Western languages and the modern sciences, to reform the traditional syllabi of the madrasas , 10 and to reinterpret and rejuvenate medieval Islamic theology in the form of a “new” c Ilm al-Kalam 11 so as to defend Islam against Western intellectual challenge; etc. Shibll’s long association with Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan (d. 1898), the foremost Indian Muslim modernist, seems to have been largely responsible for his receptivity to such tendencies. 12 These moderately modernistic tendencies faced strong opposition from his colleagues at the Nadwa, however, who were committed to a more traditional outlook; it was their influence that eventually prevailed over the direction the Nadwa was to take, especially after Shibll’s resignation from his position there (1913) and his death (1914). A Venture in Critical Islamic Historiography 29 Consequently, rather than being a mean between Aligarh and Deo- band, the Nadwa gradually drifted towards greater conservatism. ShiblT was able, however, to impart his historical interests to his pupils at the Nadwa. He also tried to imbue them with a ‘‘refor¬ mist’ ’ vision, which apparently signified for him—but particularly for his usually conservative disciples—not reforming Islam in the light of new conditions but rather reforming Indian Muslim society by reintroducing its members to Islam. 13 The Nadwa’s historiography became an expression of this concern. ShiblT also imparted an awareness of the Western intellectual challenge to Islam, a challenge he believed was luring many Muslims away from their commitment to orthodox traditions; 14 this consciousness, variously expressed by scholars of the Nadwa in their writings, con¬ stitutes a basic theme of the school’s historiography. 15 The Sir at al-Nabi: Plans and Intentions The January 1912 issue of al-Nadwa , the monthly journal of the Nadwat al- c Ulama’, carried a note by ShiblT in which he announced his intention of writing an authoritative Sira of the Prophet. 16 He explained the necessity for this project in terms of the inavailability of any reliable work on Sira to the new generation of Muslims who were being educated in the Western academic tradi¬ tion, and/or were in other ways subjet to Western influences. Not finding any good books on the Sira written by Muslim authors, these young men often turned to European works on the Prophet’s life. These latter works, however, were unsuited for Muslim readers on account not only of their factual inaccuracies but also for their prejudices and the hostility of their tone, all of which made them definitely harmful. It was important, ShiblT reasoned, that a new work on the Sira be written. For this, he appealed for funds and proposed establishing a committee to conduct and supervise the project. The reasons for writing the Sira were presented in more elaborate terms by ShiblT in the Introduction to the first volume of the Sirat al-Nabi , which was edited by Sulayman NadwT and published in 1918, four years after ShiblTs death. The purpose of the work as stated here was essentially a reiteration of what ShiblT had said in 30 Muhammad Qasim Zaman 1912: the Indian Muslims needed an authoritative work on the Sira, which would acquaint them with the life, achievements, and teachings of the Prophet, answer the questions arising in their minds, and effectively check the need to have recourse to prejudice- ridden Western writings on the Prophet’s life. The work would bring out the perfection of the Prophet; it would also try to refute the notion, to which some educated Muslims exposed to Western influences had started giving credence, that the Prophet—for all his greatness as a reformer—was prone to faults of personal character. 17 But apart from the motive just noted, which appears to have been foremost in Shibli’s thinking, at least two other reasons were clearly identified by him. One was to carefully scrutinize Western works on the Prophet, answer the criticism made by Western authors, and to expose the weaknesses and prejudices from which such works suffered. Throughout the first volume of the Sirat al-Nabi, which is almost exclusively the work of Shibli himself, the author shows a keen awareness of these criticisms on the Prophet, mustering all his intellectual resources to refute them as persuasively as possible. 18 Indeed, as Shibli argued in the Introduction, and as he had already done elsewhere, 19 there was need to formulate a new version of c Ilm al-Kalam. In its medieval form, Q Ilm al-Kalam was a method used by Muslim theologians to combat, in a rational manner, those views which were perceived as a threat to the fundamentals of Muslim belief. Initially such a threat came, inter alia, from Muslim exposure to Hellenistic thought from the 2nd century A.H./8th century A.D. onwards. In the present age it was the modern Western criticism on Islam and the Prophet Muhammad which, Shibli believed, rep¬ resented a threat comparable in its gravity to that faced in the first centuries of Islam. This new challenge had to be met by techniques similar to those of medieval Kalam whose relevance and continued efficacy Shibli affirmed. 20 The difference, however, was that in the present c Ilm al-Kalam was to help defend not just purely theological problems, as was the case in medieval times, but all aspects of Islam that might come under attack, in particular matters related to the life of the Prophet—that is, historical matters as well. 21 This is scarcely to be wondered at: given that “an affirmation of prophecy was an element of the faith, questions [which] arose as to the kind A Venture in Critical Islamic Historiography 31 of life, character and habits of the person who was the bearer of divine revelation and the representative of God [needed to be definitively answered].” 22 Another reason why, according to Shibll, there was need to write a Sira of the Prophet was the author’s feeling that “uptill now, no such book has been written on the Sira in which sufficient care has been taken to utilize only those materials which are wholly reliable.” 23 Countless works had, of course, been written on the Sira , but the authors of such works had not been able, or had not chosen, to apply the same rigorous standards in scrutinizing the correctness of their materials as experts in the study of the Prophet’s traditions ( hadith\\ plural: ahadith) applied to guarantee the trustworthiness of a particular tradition. 24 In writing this Sira , therefore, ShiblT’s rather high-sounding aim was to base himself on the most securely attested reports available. It was primarily the canonical hadith collections which he regarded as such trustworthy materials. 25 He sought, in effect, to attempt writing a Sira on the basis of hadith rather than the early Sira works. 26 The latter observa¬ tion leads us to the question of the methodology Shibll tried to adopt in writing this work. 27 The Sir at al-Nabi: Methodological Constraints Several scholars who have written on Shibll and his works have tried as well to analyze his methodology in the Sirat al-Nabi. We need not, therefore, cover the same ground once again. 28 There are, however, several points that require much further clarification. Some of the methodological problems involved will be briefly noted here in the form of the following considerations. As already noted, Shibll’s concern was to base his Sirat al-Nabi on the most secure and reliable sources. The most authoritative source of information on the Prophet’s career, he noted, is the Koran, whose testimony, wherever available, was to be considered definitive and overriding. Even the most securely attested hadith might be rejected when in conflict with the Divine Word. 29 But since the Koran usually makes only very few and mostly indirect allusions to the Prophet’s career, recourse must be had to hadith , even to interpret the Koran. The canonical hadith collections must 32 Muhammad Qasim Zaman serve therefore as the primary source of information. 30 In addition to this source, reliance was also to be placed on the most trustwor¬ thy of the early works on the Sira ; such an expedient seems to have been against Shibli’s inclinations to some extent, but was necessitated because much of hadith lacked a historical interest. Shibli identified three historical accounts as trustworthy, viz., the Sira of Ibn Ishaq, the Tabaqat of Ibn Sa c d, and the Tarikh of Tabari. 31 One of the most important early sources, the Maghazi of al-Waqidl was categorically dismissed as a collection of unreliable stories and its author denounced as a “liar”. 32 In addition to a gradation of sources with reference to their authoritativeness—the Koran, hadith , the more reliable historical accounts—Shibli emphasizes as a methodological principle the importance of 4 4 diraya'* ’, 33 understood as critical evaluation of a given report to ensure that it satisfies such requirements as internal consistency, agreement with other well-attested hadith reports, conformity to human reason and experience, etc. Through this method, which Shibli considers to have come about already with the Prophet’s companions, the sifting of sound from unreliable hadith could be more rigourously undertaken. However, while Shibli, following traditional authorities on hadith criticism, lays down the principles of 44 diraya ’ in quite elaborate terms, his actual use of these principles is rather irregular. Indeed, one is almost inclined to say that he mostly invokes these principles at places where the exigencies of his argument require that certain traditions be explained away. Another noteworthy consideration here is that while he shows awareness of the principle that a hadith which predicts future “historical” events is to be doubted, he does not seem to appreciate the need to detect the parallel but more subtle phenomenon of post-Prophetic sectarian and theological controver¬ sies being reflected in Prophetic hadith and Sira through backward projection. 34 Another interesting principle which Shibli mentions as having been articulated by earlier authorities on hadith , and which he elaborates at some length, is that the rigour with which the testimony of a certain individual is to be weighed depends, inter alia, on (and varies according to) the nature of the subject on which such testimony has a bearing. In other words, if the subject is one A Venture in Critical Islamic Historiography 33 which has no juridical consequences, or certitude and definiteness on it is not fundamental to the faith, a less reliable report may also be given credence. Thus the authority of a less trustworthy person may be accepted on a minor religious point, or on accounts pertain¬ ing to the Sira , but rejected on more fundamental religious problems. The foregoing principle raises some interesting points. It should be noted here that Shibll does not explicitly affirm this principle though he does appear to quote it approvingly. As a possible reason for Shibll’s reticence, one might suggest that for him the impor¬ tance of the Sira is of a rather different order than it was for medieval Muslims. For now, aspects of the Sira need to be defended like problems of theology once were, and, for Shibll, it is as much a part of c Ilm al-Kalam as any fundamental point of theology. Therefore standards of verification for historical reports have to be as unrelenting as those for juridically critical traditions. But if this hypothesis is valid, why does Shibll appear nevertheless to approve of this principle? Perhaps, such can be deemed understandable since he has to justify his reliance on sources less exalted than hadith , viz., the historical works. But here again, the question arises of why he accepts one historian but rejects another very important one. He does however try to justify that choice, and it would be interesting, even at the cost of some digression, to examine his case and that put forth by his pupil, Sulayman Nadwi. This exercise can give us some insight into the provenance of some of those methodological constraints which one can detect in the author’s approach. The total rejection of al-Waqidl by Shibll and Sulayman Nadwi is justified by them essentially in terms of the very unfavourable attitude of the traditionists, the muhaddithun , towards him. 35 But a categorical denunciation of al-Waqidl does not entail for Shibll and Sulayman Nadwi serious suspicions about the reliability either of Ibn Sa c d, who was a pupil of al-Waqidl and drew heavily upon him, or of al-Tabari who quotes extensively from al-Waqidl. In fairness to Shibll and Sulayman Nadwi, it should be pointed out that the criticism on Ibn Ishaq is—on the part of the medieval scholars of hadith and of those evaluating the transmitters of hadith —milder than their criticism on al-Waqidl. It has to be remembered, however, that when the hadith experts criticise al- 34 Muhammad Qasim Zaman WaqidI, they do so for his weaknesses in hadith , not in history. For his competence in the latter, they are usually very articulate in their appreciation. 36 To reject al-WaqidI as a historian, on the basis of what the traditionists say about him in his capacity as a muhaddith is thus a rather high-handed way of dismissing the historian. The high-handedness appears more striking if one agrees with Prof. C A. C A. al-Duri’s assessment that al-WaqidI was not only a more metic¬ ulous and methodologically superior historian than Ibn Ishaq, but 44 in content and method...[was] more strictly in keeping with the school of Medina than...Ibn Ishaq.’’ 37 But if Shibll was trying to write a historical work fashioned largely out of hadith materials, it is not particularly surprising (but would seem rather to be broadly consistent with his approach) that he is judging a historian on the basis of what is said about him essentially as a traditionist. The point can, in fact, justly be taken to illustrate the traditionalist bent of Shibll’s mind. 38 But there might as well be more to Shibll’s antipathy to al-WaqidI than a mere echo of what many (though not all) muhaddithun thought about the latter. One might suggest, for instance, that the influence of Sayyid Ahmad might have had something to do with this attitude. In his al-Khutbat al-Ahmadiyya (1871), which Sayyid Ahmad had written as a rejoinder to William Muir’s Life of Mahomet (1858-61), the former had consciously avoided any reliance on al-WaqidI’s accounts. 39 A more important reason influencing Shibll’s attitude (and one which might be relevant with respect to Sayyid Ahmad as well), appears to have been Shibll’s awareness of the fact that many of the Western criticisms on the Prophet were based on information derived from al-WaqidI, whom the Orientalists rated very highly. What Shibll does is not only to refute these criticisms, but, like a good mutakallim , he challenges the validity of the source on which such criticism might often be based. 40 This suggestion is further corroborated by Shiblil’s rejection (even though rare) of hadith on similar grounds, as already pointed out. Finally, by painting al-WaqidI in dark colours and loudly disclaiming any reliance on him, Shibll may consciously or unconsciously have tried to heighten the impression that his other sources were all reliable, al-WaqidI’s disgrace would serve to A Venture in Critical Islamic Historiography 35 underscore the unrelenting rigour of Shibli’s methodology, the reliability and authoritativeness of his own historiography. The Sirat al-Nabi: Beyond the Prophet’s Life One thing which should be clear from the foregoing is that there was a certain tension between the two purposes Shibll had in view when he embarked on the Sirat al-Nabi project. He wanted to write a definitivve work on the Sira, and wanted it to be written according to the best scholarly standards and especially the best available sources. But, on the other hand, he also wanted the work to serve certain reformist purposes, in so far as contemporary Indian Muslims were concerned, and—perhaps as a by-product of this same concern—he also wanted to refute Western criticisms. The reformist inclinations gave him an axe to grind. This does not necessarily make him a bad scholar. Volume I of the Sirat al-Nabi, of which Shibll is the exclusive author, is a tour de force of erudition; the account in general is persuasive, and so are many of Shibli’s criticisms of Western writers. But there already are indications that the author has an agenda of his own, and the treatment of al- Waqidl is an important but not an isolated example. On the other hand, the very fact that there are hints of a tension between the scholar and the reformist is itself a sign of hope: for it means that scholarly concerns are important enough to cause a tension. The subsequent volumes of the Sirat al-Nabi do not maintain a balance. The scholary apparatus is still there, but only the apparatus; the interest is now through and through reformist. There are several possible reasons why such a balance seems to have been jettisoned (and the tension resolved?). One could be the difference in the interests and abilities of Shibll and Sulayman NadwI. Shibll after all only lived to complete the first volume and to contribute some parts of the second; the rest is the work of his pupil. Sulayman NadwI was far less exposed to modernistic influ¬ ences than was Shibll; and unlike Shibll, he does not seem to have felt that it was really important to try to refute Western criticisms. 41 In short, his was a more conservative approach, and this may to some extent account for the direction the Sirat al-Nabi took under his authorship. 36 Muhammad Qasim Zaman The second reason which can help account for the question posed above has to do not so much with the interests of the two authors as with the nature of the work they were undertaking. As Shibll had conceived of it, the project was intended not merely to chronicle the history of the Prophet’s life in the most reliable way possible, but to accomplish much more. If Muslims were to be presented with a model wherefrom they could seek guidance, it was essential to sup¬ plement a discussion on the Prophet’s political career with another on his character, personality, teachings, and achievement. In so far as the latter aspects were considered integral to a comprehensive Sira of the Prophet, and to the purpose for which it was being writ¬ ten, it is to be expected that the authors should have been as interested in these as in the purely “historical” aspects of the Prophet’s career. At the same time, however, a presentation of the Prophet’s moral conduct—which occupies the greater part of volume II (1920)—would be more amenable to reformist purposes, and a critical sense perhaps rather more difficult to achieve here. This latter consideration may therefore also partially account for some difference which the careful reader can detect between the strictly historical sections of the Sirat al-Nabi and the rest of it. 42 But there is a third possible reason as well which may partly explain why the apparent balance between critical and reformist concerns, as evidenced by the first volume, begins to be abandoned already in the second. It will be recalled that Shibll had intended to rely as far as possible on collections of reliable hadith , rather than on the Sira works. So long as he was trying to extract from hadith facts of history (an effort to which the hadith is not naturally amenable, as already remarked), there was much greater need for critical discernment: hadith materials, despite the preference accorded to them, had to be constantly compared with Sira works, and some attention paid to Western scholarship as well. On the Prophet’s character and moral conduct (and precepts) on the other hand, hadith was the unparalleled source, and could serve as not just the primary but a sufficiently complete and self-contained basis for discussion. Such being the case, it is perhaps understandable that the discussion in subsequent volumes should be much less tramelled by critical concerns than it is in the first volume or in some of the second. A Venture in Critical Islamic Historiography 37 Notwithstanding the consideration that reformist purposes were built into the scheme of the Sira al-Nabi , it does seem that after Shibli’s death at a stage when the project was still far from com¬ plete, the work acquired a tone and tenor which was probably dif¬ ferent and rather more conservative than what ShiblT may have intended. Perhaps more curiously, from the latter half of the fourth volume (1932), the focus of the work shifted from the Prophet (his life and his conduct) to the fundamental tenets of Islamic faith and practice. Already in volume III (1924), the discussion is neither historical nor ethico-moral, but rather essentially of a theological interest: it is devoted entirely to the miracles of the Prophet and to a defence of their possibility. The arguments of the medieval theologians as regards miracles are adduced at length, and a case for the rational justification of the possibility of miracles is presented on that basis. Another long and erudite discussion on Western philosophical criticism of miracles, contributed by c Abd al-Bari NadwT, tries to show that Western philosophical speculation does not disprove the possibility of the miraculous. The rest of the volume is occupied with a discussion of the more famous of the Prophet’s miracles, in a conservative though moderate spirit. 43 Volume IV of the Sirat al-Nabi helps make the further transition to the fundamental tenets of Islam. 44 Sulayman NadwT describes here the complete transformation which the Prophet brought about in the life of the Arabs. After a detailed introduction on the nature and function of prophecy, he describes the situation as it prevailed before the rise of Islam. He argues that Arab society suffered from serious vices which called for a prophetic mission, but that the Arabs also had some special qualities which explains why they— rather than any other people—were divinely chosen to be the bearers of the sacred message. 45 He then proceeds to a very detailed elaboration of this message, which the Prophet presented before humanity throu"
