        "text": "1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines a Road Traffic Accident (RTA) as a collision involving at least one vehicle in motion on a public or private road that results in at least one person being injured or killed [1]. A traffic collision, also known as a Motor Vehicle Collision (MVC) among others occurs when a vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, road debris, or other stationary obstruction, such as a tree or pole. These traffic collisions may result in injury, death and property damage. Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs) are one of the major causes of deaths, injuries and disabilities globally. According to WHO, the epidemic of road traffic injuries is increasing in most regions of the world [2]. In fact, it has a great impact on the Disability-adjusted Life Years (DALYs). As a result, it is now a public health problem, particularly in developing countries. A DALY is a measure of overall disease burden, expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death [2].\n\nThe WHO reports that about 1.24 million people die annually on the world’s roads, with 20-50 million sustaining non-fatal injuries [2]. Globally, road traffic injuries are reported as the leading cause of death among young people aged 15-29 years and are among the top three causes of mortality among people aged 15-44 years [3]. More than 85% (1.02 million out of 1.24 million deaths) of the global deaths due to injuries occur in the developing world, consuming substantial health sector resources [4]. Further, road traffic deaths and injuries are a major but neglected public health challenge that requires concerted efforts for effective and sustainable prevention as the people dying on the roads keep increasing worldwide. The increased burden from road traffic injuries and deaths is partly due to economic development, which has led to an increased number of vehicles on the road [4].\n\nThe dynamic nature of this multi-causal phenomenon affects victims to different degrees depending on the type of accident (run over pedestrian, motorbike accident or another type of accident involving a vehicle or motorbike) and demographic characteristics (sex, age, skin colour, marital status and level of education) [5, 6]. There are several factors that contribute to the occurrence of a RTA. Factors that contribute to accidents among others are socio-demographic factors such as the age of the driver and the sex of the driver. The vehicle condition also contributes to these accidents because a vehicle which is not roadworthy is prone to accidents. Driving under the influence of alcohol is also one factor that has been documented. There is also an appreciation that inclement weather is associated with more hazardous driving conditions. Various studies show that precipitation in the form of rainfall and snowfall generally results in more accidents [7, 8]. Another study [9] supports these findings and added that causes of RTAs’ among others include human or driver errors, vehicle characteristics, traffic infrastructures including engineering design, road maintenance and traffic regulation. Driver attitude including road courtesy and behaviour, driving under the influence of drugs especially alcohol, male sex, use of seat belts, driver age (teenage drivers and elderly drivers), are among the recognised human factors [10]. Another study [11] looked at urban RTA risks for the city of Zagreb, Croatia, from 1999 through 2000. The accidents were analysed with the aim of reducing the increasing injury incidence and results indicated that more fatal accidents occurred during night hours, on urban road links, and at exceeding the speed limit.\n\nIn estimating the incidence rate [12], examined the effect of age on driver performance and safety in professional heavy vehicle drivers. In their study, they modelled the incidence rate ratios involving male drivers of rigid trucks 45-54 year olds compared to those older than 65 years old, results showed that older drivers 65 years of age and older were significantly less likely to have a crash. For drivers in the 55-64 age group there was no difference between their crash rate and their younger peers.\n\nGlobally, Zambia is ranked 29th in the world in RTAs and has a death rate of 26.51 per 100, 000 people [2]. Statistics from Zambia Police [13] indicate that Road deaths in Zambia have increased by 85% between 2012 and 2014 from 1,000 to 1,858 respectively. Despite the growing body of literature on factors (for example., socio-economic and demographic factors, road way geometric and environmental characteristics along with human behaviours) that are associated with RTAs on highways in other countries, to our knowledge, there have been no appropriate modelling techniques employed to estimate the incidence rate of death from RTAs and identification of factors associated with RTAs on the Great North Road (GNR) highway from Lusaka to Kapiri-Mposhi in Zambia.\n\nStatistical techniques known and applied to model these scenarios are limited to basic statistics such as linear and Poisson regression that do not account for over dispersion. Further, Road Traffic Accident data violates most of the assumptions that standard Poisson regression models is based. Appropriate extensions of this model, even though available, are rarely used by most applied statisticians. For modelling approaches in count data, several studies have used different models in different scenarios, in this regard [14] studied the relationship between highway geometric factors and truck accidents in Virginia using both linear and Poisson regression models. In comparing these regression models, they concluded that linear regression techniques used in their research did not describe the relationship between truck accidents and the independent variables adequately but that the Poisson models did. In addition to this, recent research has shown that the NB model can be significantly affected by datasets characterized by a heavy tail [15].\n\nThe main objective of this study was to apply Poisson models in estimating the incidence rate of death from RTAs and to identify factors associated with death from RTAs. In modelling the number of deaths associated with RTAs and other factors on the GNR between the years 2010 and 2016 using Poisson models, the study also determined which of the models fitted the data on RTAs better. This work therefore utilizes a series of Poisson models which include among others the Poisson model, Negative Binomial (NB), Zero-Truncated Poisson (ZTP), the Zero-Truncated Negative Binomial (ZTNB) model to analyse the impacts of various explanatory variables on daily serious and fatal crash frequencies on GNR over a seven-year period (2010-2016) in Zambia. Findings of this study may assist policy makers to know and understand the areas they need to focus on in order to enhance the planning and evaluation of policies in the transport sector to prevent deaths from RTAs and to improve in the transport system in Zambia. The study will also help other researchers dealing with count outcomes to know when best to apply these models.\n\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nThe incidence rate of death from RTAs was estimated in this study and factors that were associated with an increased incidence rate of death were male sex of the driver, driving in the early hours of the day, using public transport and trucks. Other factors that were associated with an increase in the incidence rate of death from RTAs included the stretch between Katuba and landless corner, Landless corner to ZNS, ZNS to Mulungushi University and Mulungushi University to Kapiri-Mposhi as compared to Lusaka to Katuba.\n\nIt has been shown in this study that the number of deaths on this stretch of the road (GNR) has been increasing over time from 2010 to 2016. One of the studies [20] has documented a high likelihood of younger drivers being involved in RTAs and this study found that young people were at a high risk of Road Traffic Injuries among car and motorcycle users, while among bicycle and public transport users, the risk was greater in older people. However in this study, there was no evidence of an association between the driver’s age and the incidence of death from RTAs.\n\nThe sex of the driver is a crucial variable in the analysis of Road traffic accidents. Results from this study indicated an increase rate of death if one is a male driver compared to female driver. This finding is with borderline statistical evidence and we cannot rule out chance finding, further the wide confidence interval is an indication that this finding is not very reliable. On the other hand, this finding established here regarding greater risk of serious and fatal injuries in males is consistent with other studies that used travel time [21] and found that males compared to females were more likely to be involved in road traffic accidents.\n\nDriving in the early hours of the day (between 1 AM and 6 AM) as compared to driving in the night (7PM-12AM) had a significant increase in the incidence rate of death from RTAs adjusting for all other variables in the model. This increase in the incidence at these hours could be due to driver’s fatigue or excessive speed as there is less traffic in the early hours of the day. Contrary to what has been found in this study, a study by [22] in which they grouped the time as daylight and night found greater risk of injury for drivers traveling during daylight hours more than those driving at night.\n\nThe study found an increased incidence rate of death if one is driving between Katuba and Landless corner compared to driving between Lusaka and Katuba. The results also revealed that there was an increased incident of death between Landless corner and ZNS as compared to driving between Lusaka and Katuba. This increase in the incidence of death on this stretch could be as a result of the curvature, a blind spot as the road is not straight on this particular stretch. Several other studies have analysed these accident-prone road sections [23], considered one of the basic steps to reduce road accident rates. In this direction, several methods to identify blackspots have been proposed which include accident frequency method; accident rate methods; quality control method; empirical Bayesian method; and many more [24-28]. Further, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) have been incorporated in the analysis of blackspots [23] the effectiveness of blackspot programs has been evaluated in different countries [29, 30] and it still remains as an active field of research. Further research is needed in Zambia on these blackspots especially on the highway roads.\n\nResults also revealed that Public transport compared to private transport had an increased incidence of death from RTAs, this finding was statistically significant. Similar Studies done in developing countries also show that public (that is, bus/minibus) transport has serious safety concerns as a result of frequent involvement in severe accidents [31]. In these countries, bus/minibus accidents are rampant with alarming consequences [32, 33]. This could have been due to the fact that private vehicle owners tend to be more careful on the roads as compared to bus drivers as the later drive long distances and are fatigued hence they are prone to have a crash. This finding is important to influence government policy so as to limit the number of kilometres as well as the number of hours a public vehicle driver can handle in a day to reduce on numbers of RTAs. The study further showed that the ZTNB fits the fatal and serious accident data well as compared to the ZTP, NB and poisson models. This finding is in agreement with findings from [34] where the ZTNB model when applied to total number of vehicles involved in the accident and the number of casualties in a particular accident, ZTNB was found to be the best fit model compared to other models."
