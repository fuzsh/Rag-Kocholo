        "text": "SECURITY CONCERNS: An FBI agent said it was surprising that the shooter, whose motive remains unknown, was able to open fire before the Secret Service killed him\n\nAP, BUTLER, Pennsylvania\n\nOn the heels of an apparent attempt to kill him, former US president Donald Trump yesterday called for unity and resilience as shocked leaders across the political divide recoiled from the shooting that left him injured, but “fine,” and the shooter and a rally-goer dead.\n\nThe presumptive Republican presidential nominee said the upper part of his right ear was pierced in the shooting\n\nHis aides said he was in “great spirits” and doing well.\n\n“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nIn a subsequent post yesterday, Trump said “it was God alone who prevented the unthinkable from happening.”\n\n“In this moment, it is more important than ever that we stand United, and show our True Character as Americans, remaining Strong and Determined, and not allowing Evil to Win,” he said.\n\nThe FBI early yesterday identified the shooter as Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe investigation remains active and ongoing, the agency said.\n\nSecret Service agents fatally shot Crooks, who attacked from an elevated position outside the rally venue at a farm show in Butler, Pennsylvania, the agency said.\n\nOne male attendee was killed and two male spectators were critically injured, authorities said.\n\nInvestigators believe the weapon had been purchased by Crooks’ father at least six months ago, two law enforcement officials said.\n\nFederal agents were still working to understand when and how his son obtained the gun and gather additional information about Crooks as they worked to try to identify a motive, the officials said.\n\nThe officials were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity\n\nThe attack was the most serious attempt to assassinate a president or presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981.\n\nIt drew new attention to concerns about political violence in a deeply polarized US less than four months before the presidential election, and it could alter the tenor and security posture at the Republican National Convention, which is to begin today in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nOrganizers said the convention would proceed as planned.\n\nTrump flew to New Jersey after visiting a local Pennsylvania hospital, landing shortly after midnight at Newark Liberty International Airport.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, who is running against Trump, was briefed on the incident and spoke to Trump several hours after the shooting, the White House said.\n\n“There’s no place in America for this type of violence,” the president said in public remarks. “It’s sick. It’s sick.”\n\nMany Republicans quickly blamed the violence on Biden and his allies, arguing that sustained attacks on Trump as a threat to democracy have created a toxic environment.\n\nThey pointed in particular to a comment Biden made to donors on Monday last week, saying “it’s time to put Trump in the bullseye.”\n\nLaw enforcement recovered an AR-15-style rifle at the scene, a third person familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nAn Associated Press analysis of more than a dozen videos and photos from the scene of the Trump rally, as well as satellite imagery of the site, shows the shooter was able to get astonishingly close to the stage where the former president was speaking, about 150m away.\n\nAsked at a news conference whether law enforcement did not know the shooter was on the roof until he began firing, FBI Special Agent Kevin Rojek said “that is our assessment at this time.”\n\n“It is surprising” that the shooter was able to open fire on the stage before the Secret Service killed him, he added.\n\nRon Moose, a Trump supporter at the rally, said he heard about four shots.\n\n“I saw the crowd go down and then Trump ducked, also real quick,” he said. “Then the Secret Service all jumped and protected him as soon as they could. We are talking within a second they were all protecting him.”\n\nThe BBC interviewed a man who said he saw a man armed with a rifle crawling up a roof near the event.\n\nThe self-described eyewitness, who the BBC did not identify, said he and the people he was with started pointing at the man, trying to alert security.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters"
