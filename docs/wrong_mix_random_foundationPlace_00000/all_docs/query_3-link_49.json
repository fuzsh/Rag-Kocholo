        "text": "This list is derived from open-source material and likely does not reflect the full number of incidents. It is most likely incomplete and more anecdotal than we would like. As with any list based on publicly availed information, increased numbers of incidents could reflect an increase in activity after 2009 or it could reflect increased public reporting of espionage cases, as greater attention was paid to the problem and the U.S. government became less reluctant (at the end of the Bush Administration) to publicly identify China as the perpetrator.
