On March 24, 1962 she married Luis Espinosa and went on to have nine children, many grandchildren, and even some great-grandchildren. They were married for almost 60 years prior to Luis' passing in 2022. Lupe was a devoted wife, mother, and grandmother; and a committed homemaker that served her family selflessly throughout her life. She lived a fearless life guided by her faith and her love for family and friends. She left her home in Mexico and raised her family in a country where she learned to adapt to the new language (even though she never quite learned it) and a new way of life filled with challenges and obstacles. Despite this, she was the solid foundation upon which her family rested. Everyone that met her or knew her was, in some way, touched and changed by her unconditional love and wisdom, or her food. Whether she was cooking in it or teaching those willing to learn, her kitchen was her and everyone's favorite place, and a good meal was her way of saying \"thank you\" or \"hello.\" Although she was many things to many people, she would like to be remembered as a woman of unwavering faith in Jesus Christ, which she would enthusiastically share with anyone willing to listen, and even some that weren't.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nRamjit Singh - April 01, 1948 - May 08, 2024\n\nDeparted: 05/08/2024 (Corona)\n\nObituary Preview: An obituary is not available at this time for Ramjit Singh.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nJack William Kroonen - May 14, 1930 - May 02, 2024\n\nDeparted: 05/02/2024 (Corona)\n\nObituary Preview: Jack William Kroonen, 93 passed away on May 2, 2024 in Corona, CA.

He had a passion for collecting spiders from a young age and was fascinated by them. This drove his kindergarten teacher crazy as he would rally other boys during recess to collect spiders with him and bring them back into the classroom in their sandwich bags. As an adult, Justin still laughed about that. He loved going to school and learning. Justin attended Citrus Hills Intermediate and found a passion for acting. He played a role in Scrooge his first year, which took him and his drama class to perform in downtown Riverside during Christmas. He then played a role in Grease. In sixth grade Justin and his good friend Tanner Ralls won the science fair. They went on to the County competition and also won. Again, they moved on to the state competition for their project in engineering relating to rust prevention and received honorable mention being so young. Justin never missed a day of school until a football injury his senior year. Justin played catcher, center field and outfield in little league. He tried his hand at basketball as well and loved that sport until he was introduced to football. He started playing for the Corona Chargers Junior League and they were champions three years in a row. He couldn’t wait for high school football. While in high school at Santiago he was an excellent student and in AP classes. He was able to manage a tough schedule with football and homework. Justin was a varsity letterman in Santiago football, and he loved being a running back. He worked out like crazy and gave his all at practice and games. He was one of the strongest kids on his team and excelled at weightlifting. Justin loved watching the TV show “The Office” and thought that was one of the funniest shows.

Some of the many family camping trips and Santiago High School family trips were to Ocotillo Wells, Gorman, Calico, and the Lake Elsinore track. He loved going to Havasu and the Parker Strip during the summer and enjoyed wakeboarding, tubing and heading out on the wave-runners. He loved being on and in the water. Justin quickly learned to love going on cruises and went to the Caribbean twice with his mom. He loved the island life and had another trip planned for September 2024, to visit Oahu. Justin went on many trips with his mom and his friends where he spent a lot of time fishing and enjoying all the amenities the resorts had to offer. He loved room service and thought that was the neatest thing. Justin also went on many father and son road trips; like snowmobiling in Yellowstone National Park, backpacking Sequoia National Park, and snow skiing in Montana. He loved rollercoasters and visited Cedar Point Amusement Park and then from there he and his father went on to Niagara Falls in New York. Another highlight was a high school football father-son rafting trip on the Merced River. All these adventures led him to taking a backpacking trip with friends in the Sierras. On the way to college at Washington State University, Justin and his father stopped in Seattle for horseback riding, the Duck Tour and enjoyed all the local sights. Justin’s last trip was to Pittsburg. His father surprised him for his birthday and they went to see the Pittsburg Steelers, which was his favorite football team.

Nothing in all creation can separate us from God's love for us in Christ Jesus our Lord! Romans 8: 38-30 Zavier A. Branch was born on November 18, 1994, to the late Ron Branch and Cynthia Cooper- Branch in Orange County, California. April 5, 2024, marked the untimely passing of a remarkable, caring, and bright young soul. Zavier accepted Christ into his life at a very young age. He went on to join and attend Faith Fellowship Church while living in California. He became involved in several community youth groups in Corona. While attending La Sierra High School in Riverside, he participated in competitive gymnastics which afforded him the opportunity to travel and compete all over the United States. Following graduation in 2014, he mentored various community groups involved in gymnastics in developing their competitive skills. Upon graduation from High School, Zavier attended California State University Long Beach, studying Fashion and Merchandising. He worked through the ranks with several well-known retailers expanding his knowledge base, skills, experience, and business network. According to friends and business associates, he was a risk taker through and through and stopped at nothing to achieve the launch of his very own business. Zavier was confident in what he wanted and was relentless in pursuing it. ZB Home Company, LLC, with a focus on interior design, launched in the midst of the pandemic in 2020. His unique design approach was in such high demand, as evidenced by sales exceeding projections in the first two years. While ZB Home Company was based in San Antonio Texas, his expertise as an interior designer was in demand throughout the United States including California, New York, Florida, and Chicago. Zavier was a member of ASID (American Association of Interior Designers), as well as the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce. ZB Home Company was featured on several media platforms and local TV broadcasting including San Antonio Living and Home Sweet Home San Antonio. A two-page spread graced the Society Texas publication in 2022 highlighting his philosophy that interior design is to be “unique but livable”. Zavier’s accomplishments as an entrepreneur are worth the attention given as we celebrate his life as it’s a testament to how he lived his life regardless of the challenge he faced with having been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of 3. This challenge did not slow him down, it only propelled him to relentlessly pursue his dreams. While being an amazing and successful entrepreneur, Zavier was foremost a family oriented young man. His presence during holidays, special occasions, and “just because—no reason” visits affirmed his love and commitment to family and friends. His love and compassion are seen throughout photos, videos, and social media. He touched each of us so deeply. There never was or ever will be a moment that a memory of him doesn’t bring a huge smile or crazy laugh to our hearts . His zest for life was contagious. Zavier’s desire for fun/adventure and to never stop learning, growing, and connecting with others took him to places like Mexico, Rome, Paris, Portugal and many other Get-Aways with family and friends. Zavier was preceded in death by his father Ronnie Branch, Sr. He is survived by his mother Cynthia Cooper-Branch of Corona, CA and two siblings Ronnie Branch of Riverside, CA and Veronica Branch of New Iberia, LA. Maternal grandparents: Proby Cooper and the late Jimmie Lou Cooper of Picayune, MS. Paternal grandparents: Dorothy Branch and the late James Branch, Sr of Picayune, MS. Surviving aunts include: Patricia Evans of Atlanta, GA, Sonji Cooper-Harris (Denver)of Riverside, CA, and Elice Johnson (Warren) of Camarillo, CA.

Zavier is also survived by an extended family in San Antonio, Texas: Caleb Echols, LaRitta Webb, and Jessica Chiang and their families. He was known as “Tito” to Jessica’s children Ezra, Penelope and Eden. Often, Zavier spoke of how blessed he felt to have such loving and wonderful people to call family. He leaves with special memories a host of nieces, nephews, cousins, and many other family members. Countless friends in California, Texas and abroad, as Zavier touched so so many lives.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nPamela Ann Horvath - October 04, 1956 - April 03, 2024\n\nDeparted: 04/03/2024 (Corona)\n\nObituary Preview: Pamela Ann Horvath, 67 of Corona, CA, passed away April 3rd, 2024 at her residence. She was an amazing woman and will be deeply missed by all who knew her and will live on in all our memories and experiences that we all shared. She leaves behind sons Casey and Jason Horvath; daughter in laws, Jen and Jeni Horvath; grandchildren; Amanda, her husband Brandon, Tyler, Lucas, Natalie, Noah, Logan, and Jackson in addition to great grandchildren Mila and Stevie. Lastly she leaves behind what became her trusted companion “Dixie”, her beloved dog. She was preceded in death by her husband Dennis, her parents Charles Calhoun and mother Gloria Martin, as well as her sister Sandy. Pam (Pamela) was born in Racine, Wisconsin on October 4th, 1956. She was the youngest of 3 to sisters Cindy and Sandy. Growing up in Wisconsin was hard at times though Pam thoroughly enjoyed being near so many cousins, aunts and uncles. However, in 1968, when she was 12, her family made the decision to head west to California for a brighter future and better weather. Unfortunately, their first stop ended up being in the Salton Sea. Her family spent three very long years there before moving to Anaheim in 1971. In Anaheim she finally embraced California and wasn’t homesick for Wisconsin. Pam worked at an early age from babysitting as soon as she could to waitressing. Pam enjoyed singing very much and performed at some local stadiums throughout her high school years. It was during her senior year of high school when she would meet her future husband Dennis, who was introduced to her by her father. Married in 1975, Pam and Dennis relocated to Corona, CA. Pam worked as a waitress at the local Denny’s restaurant while studying to earn her real estate license. In 1983, Pam and Dennis made the decision to purchase Hamner Towing Inc. This decision would shape much of the rest of her life as working a small business takes countless hours. The plan was for Pam to learn the books and then Dennis would then come over full time to run the business alongside her. As we all know that never really transpired, Dennis was doing well at the dealership and Pam was killing it as an owner of a towing company. Pam attacked everything with tenacity and hard work often sacrificing her own wishes to ensure the success of others and Hamner Towing. While Dennis was involved in every decision within the company it was Pam who was the heartbeat of what would become one of the most successful and trustworthy companies in the industry. Pam and Dennis decided to join various service clubs in the area and believed in supporting the community that supported them. Pam became the first woman to join the Norco Rotary Club. She would go on to be a longtime evolved member of the newly formed Circle City Rotary Club. Pam would serve on various other boards and/or committees which included the YMCA, Chamber of Commerce, and Four Cities Employer’s Advisory Council, etc. Pamela was a selfless person and had such a positive effect on so many lives. She was an amazing wife, mother and grandmother. She was friendly, loving, and gracious. She deeply enjoyed her family and friends. She loved to play games with her grandchildren. Time is all she ever wanted, and it is time that we will count down until we meet her again. Anyone who wishes to make a memorial donation in honor of Pam is asked to direct their gift to the City of Hope Hospital or the American Cancer Society.\n\nView Full Obituary\n\nRandall Paul Saeli Sr. - November 10, 1951 - March 31, 2024\n\nDeparted: 03/31/2024 (Corona)\n\nObituary Preview: Randall Paul Saeli Senior, son of Sam and Ella Saeli, was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, and brother.
