        "text": "Jean Mollison was the manageress of Glencoe Lodge in Vancouver.\n\nThe original location of Glencoe Lodge was at 1001 Georgia Street from 1907 to 1931. (Further information appears on this page: Glencoe Lodge.)\n\nA smaller and shorter-lived version of Glencoe Lodge was at 2020 Barclay Street from late 1931 to 1934.\n\nBirth Date\n\nJean Mollison was born in Scotland in the 1860s. Many records from later years suggest that she was born about 1869.\n\nHowever, the National Records of Scotland system has an entry for “Jane Mollison,” who was born in Wick, Caithness on May 21, 1861. Her parents were James Mollison and Anne Bisset. The birth register said that the date of James’s and Anne’s marriage was October 22, 1853, which was only one day away from the date of October 21, 1853 in the record of their marriage.\n\nThe 1871 and 1881 Scottish census records also support a birth year in the early 1860s for Jean. There are two entries for the Mollison family in the 1871 Scotland census. One listed Jean as “Wm Mollison” [female], who was born at Wick, Caithness, about 1862; the other said that she was “Jean Mollison,” who was born at Caithness about 1862.\n\nThe 1881 Scotland census described her as “Jeannie Mollison,” born at Wick, Caithness about 1862.\n\nFamily Background\n\nJean’s father, James Mollison, was born in Scotland in 1826. (The 1901 Canada census gave his birth date as November 14, 1823.)\n\nIt appears that James was born in Kincardine, Aberdeen, and that his parents were George Mollison (1782-1856) and Margaret Jolly (1782-1857).\n\nGeorge Mollison was a farmer at Mill of Campfield, Kincardine O’Neil. He died in September 1856, and he was buried in Banchory-Ternan Kirkyard in Banchory, Aberdeenshire.\n\nAfter George died, his heirs sold the crops, animals, and equipment that were associated with the farm.\n\nMargaret Mollison died on December 26, 1857. She was buried in Banchory-Ternan Kirkyard in Banchory.\n\nJames Mollison: Early Life\n\nIn 1841, James Mollison was living with his parents at Mill of Campfield, Kincardine O’Neil.\n\nIn 1851, he was a farm manager at Kinchyle, southwest of Inverness.\n\nOn October 21, 1853, in Dores, southwest of Inverness, James married Anne Bisset, who was born in Inverness about 1827 (or 1830).\n\nStarting about 1863 and continuing almost uninterrupted until the early 1880s, the Mollisons lived at Dochgarroch Lodge, Inverness, where James was a factor (property manager) and land agent for the Baillie family.\n\nJames Scott Skinner, a well-known Scottish fiddler, wrote a song dedicated to Dochgarroch Lodge. (Paul Anderson plays a solo violin version of the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk3XwVdVQOw.)\n\nThis extract from a Scottish ordnance survey name book cites “J. Mollison” as a source for the spelling of two place names near Dochgarroch: Battlefield and Balliemore.\n\nAnne Mollison died in Inverness on February 26, 1876.\n\nJames Mollison and Anne Bisset had three boys and four girls.\n\nAnne Elizabeth Mollison (1854-1929)\n\nJames William Mollison (1857-1927)\n\nHellen Mary Mollison (1859-1944)\n\nJean Mollison (1861-1951)\n\nJessie Mollison (1863-1929)\n\nAndrew Oliver Mollison (1865-1891)\n\nRobert Bisset Mollison (1869-1893)\n\nIn the early 1880s, James was still living at Dochgarroch Lodge, along with four children: Annie, Jeannie, Andrew and Robert. James was employed as Dochgarroch Lodge’s factor in 1883.\n\nIn September 1884, the Baillies ended James Mollison’s job as factor. On September 29, 1884, the Mollisons moved to Pavenham, which is north of Bedford in England. According to one record, they lived at East End Farm, which is about two kilometres east of Pavenham.\n\nJames claimed that his dismissal from Dochgarroch Lodge was illegal, and he sued the Baillies for £2500 in damages. The Baillies offered to pay one year’s salary instead.\n\nIn January 1885, the court denied James’s claim for £2500, and it agreed that one year’s salary was proper compensation. James also had to pay the legal expenses for the Baillies.\n\n(The full report of the case appears here: Mollison v. Baillie (1885) Scottish Law Reporter, volume 22, pages 595-597 (January 10, 1885); https://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotCS/1885/22SLR0595.html; https://www.bailii.org/scot/cases/ScotCS/1885/22SLR0595.pdf.)\n\nIt appears that James became financially insolvent during the middle and late 1880s. James Mollison of Pavenham, Bedfordshire, England (“lately residing at Dochgarroch”) petitioned himself into bankruptcy on March 31, 1888. The final dividend to his creditors was payable on October 3, 1889.\n\nHis trustee in bankruptcy was released in 1891.\n\nTo Canada\n\nJames Mollison and his children moved to Canada in the late 1880s. According to the available information, they did not come all at once.\n\nJean Mollison recollected that the oldest daughter, Annie, arrived in Canada in May 1888. Annie became a housekeeper at the Canadian Pacific Railway’s hotel at Banff, in the Rocky Mountains.\n\nJames Mollison, Jean’s father, was in Canada by the fall of 1888, when he wrote a letter to the editor of the Calgary Herald.\n\nJean recalled that she herself had arrived in July 1888, and she became the assistant housekeeper at the hotel in Banff.\n\n“Miss Helen M. Mollison,” who appears to be Jean’s sister, arrived in Canada on July 23, 1889.\n\nIn late 1889 the older Mollison sisters became the managers of the Canadian Pacific Railway hotel in the Fraser Canyon.\n\nThe Lister-Kaye Company\n\nIn February 1889, James Mollison was the manager of the Canadian Agricultural Coal and Colonization Company, which was often called the “Lister Kaye estate.”\n\nSir John Pepys Lister-Kaye (sometimes spelled “Lester Kaye”) was a baronet who led a British syndicate that obtained large areas of land from Canadian Pacific Railway, in what is now Saskatchewan and Alberta. The original plan was to mix farming and ranching.\n\nIn the spring of 1889, James wrote a series of articles about the resources and development of western Canada. At that time, he was still a manager for the Canadian Agricultural Coal and Colonization Company.\n\nA combination of challenging weather conditions and lack of experience soon resulted in operational and financial failures for the Lister-Kaye company.\n\nSir John Lister-Kaye later had other financial difficulties as well, and he became bankrupt in 1914.\n\nSir John Lister-Kaye died in 1924.\n\nJames Mollison: to Willow Creek\n\nBy the fall of 1889, James Mollison was no longer with the Lister-Kaye enterprise.\n\nHe bought a farm at Willow Creek, which is north of Fort MacLeod (sometimes simply called “MacLeod”).\n\nAccording to an 1899 letter from the Calgary and Edmonton Land Company, the location of the farm was the “South Half and the Northeast Quarter of Section 23, Township 9, Range 26, West of the Fourth Meridian.” (This converts to: 49°44’45.4″N 113°24’41.8″W or Latitude 49.7459473; Longitude: -113.4115961: Alberta Energy Regulator conversion tool: https://www1.aer.ca/GISConversionTools/ats_degrees_converter.html.)\n\nIn October 1889, the Calgary Herald described the Mollison family’s move to Willow Creek.\n\nAt the time of the 1891 Canada census, James was living on the farm at Willow Creek, along with his sons, Andrew and Robert. (Both sons died in the 1890s.)\n\nIn 1899, James offered his property for sale, although it appears that the sale did not take place.\n\nJames was still living at Fort MacLeod in 1902, when he went to Glacier, British Columbia, to visit his daughter. (A newspaper article describing his trip called him “W.H. Mollison.”) He took a Scotch collie dog with him.\n\nThe Scotch collie may be the same dog that appears in this photograph of Jean Mollison at Lake Louise.\n\nIn the early 1900s, James continued to travel back and forth from British Columbia to the MacLeod area.\n\nHe also lived for periods of time with his daughters, Annie and Jean, at Calgary, and perhaps during the summer at Lake Louise.\n\nBy 1904, James was retiring from ranching, and he sold 80 head of cattle by auction.\n\nJames died at Calgary on October 12, 1905.\n\nHe was buried in the cemetery at Fort MacLeod, where two of his sons were also buried.\n\nJean Mollison: Early Years in the Mountain Hotels\n\nThe details of Jean Mollison’s early time in Canada are not always clear. Most sources rely on interviews with Jean in the 1930s and 1940s, although her memory of earlier details was sometimes imprecise.\n\nFrom the late 1880s to the early 1900s, Jean and her sister, Annie, spent periods of time at several Canadian Pacific Railway hotels, including Banff, Field, Lake Louise, Glacier House, and North Bend. Sometimes they were both at one hotel at the same time; at other times they were on their own. (Mount Mollison in Kootenay and Yoho National Parks is named for Annie. A small railway point west of North Bend is named after Jean.)\n\nExcept for Banff and Lake Louise, at first the main function of the early railway hotels was to provide meals for passengers on the trains. (Glacier House and Mount Stephen house later became centres for mountain climbing and sightseeing. Fraser Canyon House at North Bend also offered expanded accommodation facilities.)\n\nThe first railway surveys in western Canada had to satisfy many objectives. The surveyors first looked to discover all available routes. To choose the best route, they considered several factors relating to building and running the railway, including:\n\ncosts of construction\n\ntrack gradients and curves\n\nneed for cuts and fills, bridging and tunneling\n\nsnowfall and avalanche hazards\n\noperating costs\n\nSome routes had no easy option, leaving only long or steep grades which early locomotives struggled to climb. These grades were also dangerous when trains were descending.\n\nFor freight traffic, the railway could add locomotives or have shorter trains, although this approach increased the railway’s overall operating costs.\n\nFor passenger traffic, the railway chose to replace dining cars with a series of dining stops in the mountains. The railway hired architect Thomas Charles Sorby to design buildings for three locations: Glacier House at Glacier, Mount Stephen House at Field, and Fraser Canyon House at North Bend. At first the buildings were rather simple, although they were later enlarged and converted into hotels.\n\nMount Stephen House opened in the fall of 1886.\n\nGlacier House and Fraser Canyon House both opened in the summer of 1887.\n\nThis was the dining room at Fraser Canyon House in the 1890s.\n\nIn addition to Jean’s time at the mountain hotels in British Columbia, she was also a manager from 1895 to 1911 at Lake Louise (which was sometimes called “Laggan”).\n\nThis was Lake Louise Chalet in the early 1900s.\n\nWhile Jean was in North Bend, she occasionally travelled to Vancouver, where she would take part in local social events. Sometimes she would perform with local musicians and entertainers. Her specialty was well-known Scottish songs. One of her earliest performances was in 1890.\n\nChanges in the Early 1900s\n\nIn 1904, Jean and her sister, Annie, bought the former residence of Anglican Bishop Cyprian Pinkham, which was at 215 Fourth Avenue S.W. in Calgary. They began to run it as a hotel and boarding house called Braemar Lodge.\n\nJean’s father, James Mollison, died in Calgary on October 12, 1905.\n\nAround this time, Jean was still associated with the hotels in North Bend and Lake Louise.\n\nIn 1906, Annie and Jean renovated and enlarged Braemar Lodge in Calgary. The architects were Francis James Lawson (1860-1952) and James Joseph O’Gara (1876-1931). As security to finance the project, they used the Willow Creek property near Fort MacLeod, which they had inherited from their father.\n\nThe postcard below shows the results of the additions and alterations.\n\nAnnie and Jean operated Braemar Lodge together until December 1914, when Jean sold her interest to Annie. (Annie continued to operate Braemar Lodge until she died in 1929.)\n\nBy 1907, Jean began to have trouble with her eyesight, and she felt that she could no longer manage Fraser Canyon House at North Bend. It was not until several years later that she had surgery to correct her vision.\n\nJean Takes over Glencoe Lodge\n\nAt the end of September 1907, the Vancouver Province noted that “Miss Mollison,” the manageress of the Lake Louse Chalet, was staying at the Hotel Vancouver.\n\nOn September 30, the Province reported that Jean had leased the Rogers Hotel at the corner of Burrard Street and Georgia Street.\n\nAt this time the hotel was new, and it was only about half as large as it would become later. (Further information appears on the page for Glencoe Lodge.)\n\nThe early news references said that the hotel was to be called the “Gleneve.”\n\nSoon the hotel had a new name: Glencoe Lodge. It quickly became a successful and well-known destination for both tourists and long-term residents. As well, prominent society members regularly held meetings and parties at the Lodge.\n\nIn 1908 and 1909, Jean went back to manage the Lake Louise Chalet for the summer. While Jean was away, Mildred Hawes looked after Glencoe Lodge.\n\nIn 1909, renovations doubled the original size of Glencoe Lodge. Jean continued to lease the Lodge until the early 1930s.\n\nFor some years, Jean arranged for another person to look after Glencoe Lodge during the summer. In 1910 and 1911, Jessie Dewar was the manager\n\nGlenshiel Inn\n\nFrom 1912 to about 1925, Jean was the proprietor of the Glenshiel Inn in Victoria.\n\nL.E. Gooding had built the hotel in 1909, and he called it The Criterion.\n\nLouis Ebenezer Gooding was a mining engineer who was born in Lockport, Illinois about 1870.\n\nIn 1901 he was living in the Kootenay region of British Columbia. By 1909, he was working as an assayer in Crofton, British Columbia.\n\nHe later lived in the United States. In 1934, he was in Berkeley, California.\n\nHe died in 1938.\n\nJean bought the Criterion Hotel in December 1911. She planned to enlarge the building to accommodate more guests.\n\nThis excerpt from a 1911 fire insurance plan shows the Glenshiel Inn before the additions.\n\nAfter Jean acquired the hotel, Fred Cancellor became the manager from 1912 to 1915. (Fred was a brother of Herbert Cancellor, who was married to Jean’s sister, Jessie.)\n\nIn 1915, Jean’s sister, Hellen Patterson, took over the management of the Glenshiel Inn.\n\nFrom 1919 to 1925, Harriett Jane Wood (1869-1946) was the manager.\n\nBy 1925, Violet Mary Allen had taken over the Glenshiel Inn. She arranged to enlarge the building.\n\nViolet Allen died in Plymouth, England in 1933.\n\nThe Glenshiel continued as a hotel until 1972.\n\nIn 1958, the hotel added the “Thistle Room,” which was a dining room with view windows.\n\nIn 1972, the Province of British Columbia acquired the property. The building is currently a residence for senior citizens.\n\nStrathcona Lodge\n\nIn 1912, Jean became the proprietor of the Strathcona Hotel, which was on the shore of Shawnigan Lake on Vancouver Island. The hotel was next to a railway line, which made it a convenient stop for tourists and vacationers.\n\nThe hotel was about twelve years old, and it was actually the second building on the site. The first version of the hotel was almost finished when a fire destroyed it, and the builders had to start over.\n\nThe reconstruction of the hotel began in June 1900.\n\nThe hotel opened on September 19, 1900\n\nIn 1903, Mrs. Josephine Elizabeth Wark (1866-1942) bought the hotel.\n\nIn 1911, Mrs. Wark attempted to sell the hotel to Louis Lucas and John P. Sweeney.\n\nThe Lucas and Sweeney transaction fell through, and in early 1912, Jean Mollison became the owner of the hotel.\n\nThe hotel was temporarily closed for renovations.\n\nWhen the hotel re-opened in June 1912, its new name was Strathcona Lodge.\n\nIn September 1912, Jean organized a company called Mollison Sisters Limited to take over the ownership of Strathcona Lodge.\n\nJean and her sisters, Hellen and Jessie, initially each took one share in the company.\n\nBy February 1913, Jean’s brother-in-law, Herbert Cancellor, was Strathcona Lodge’s manager.\n\nAlthough Strathcona Lodge remained in business for about another 13 years, Jean was no longer advertising the Lodge after the fall of 1914. By 1916, she had sold it to the Canadian Pacific Railway. By about the same time she had also given up her lease for the Cameron Lake Chalet.\n\nBy the mid-1920s the Lodge’s business had decreased, partly because automobile travel on Vancouver Island tended to bypass Shawnigan Lake.\n\nAfter the Lodge closed in August 1927, the building became Strathcona Lodge School, with Wilhelmina (“Minna”) Gildea (1875-1950) as the headmistress. After Minna died in 1950, the school was closed until it re-opened in 1959. It closed again in 1977.\n\nCameron Lake Chalet\n\nIn June 1912, Jean leased the Cameron Lake Chalet from the Canadian Pacific Railway. The chalet was a combination station and hotel that the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway had built at the east end of Cameron Lake.\n\nHerbert Cancellor, Jean’s brother-in-law, was the manager of the Cameron Lake Chalet until he and his brother moved to the Brentwood Hotel at Saanichton Inlet.\n\nBy early 1915, Albert Morton Monks and his wife, May, were managing the chalet.\n\nAlbert was born in Ipswich, England on June 20, 1882. On August 3, 1912, at Port Moody, British Columbia, Albert married May Savatard.\n\nOn November 12, 1915, Albert signed his attestation papers to serve with the Canadian military forces during the First World War.\n\nAlbert was killed in action on August 21, 1917. His a war commemoration is at the Vimy Memorial.\n\nFor a time, George W. Woolett took charge of the chalet.\n\nMay Monks later returned as the manager.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, May had retired, and in 1935 she travelled to England.\n\nShe died in London, England on December 23, 1935.\n\nA series of tenants later operated the property until the 1960s.\n\nGlencoe Lodge: Later Years\n\nGlencoe Lodge was quite prosperous for much of its history, even during the First World War. After Benjamin Tingley Rogers, the hotel owner, died in 1918, his wife inherited the property. Jean continued to lease the hotel, which did well until the end of the 1920s.\n\nHowever, the arrival of the Great Depression brought an end to this success. Many tenants were unable to pay their rents, and Jean tried to re-negotiate her terms with Mrs. Rogers. By 1931, Mrs. Rogers ended Jean’s lease, and Glencoe Lodge became the short-lived Belfred Hotel.\n\nBy December 1931, Jean had established a much smaller Glencoe Lodge at 2020 Barclay Street, which was the former house of Frederick Buscombe.\n\nDuring the first year of the New Glencoe Lodge, Jean also lived in the house at 2020 Barclay Street. By 1934 she had moved her residence to 1649 Davie Street, although she may have briefly kept the new Glencoe Lodge operating at Barclay Street.\n\nThe house at 1649 Davie Street was midway between Cardero Street and Bidwell Street, on the north side of the block. (The house had been a rental building for many years. Alfred McGowan Pease had lived in the house from 1908 to 1912.)\n\nBy May 1934, the New Glencoe Lodge was out of business, and new managers had taken over at 2020 Barclay Street.\n\nIn the summer of 1935, Jean opened the Glencoe Lodge Coffee Shop at 1213 Granville Street.\n\nThe coffee shop was on the ground floor of the Austin Hotel (formerly known as the Granville Palace Hotel). The shop space had previously been the location of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, followed by an auctioneer’s business and a government liquor store.\n\nJean had given a chattel mortgage to secure money that she had borrowed, possibly to keep the coffee shop open. In November 1936, the holder of the chattel mortgage auctioned much of Jean’s collection of furniture and antiques.\n\nIn 1937, a bailiff seized and sold the furniture and equipment from the coffee shop to pay the arrears of rent.\n\nJean continued to live at 1649 Davie Street until 1951. From 1945 to 1947, Mrs. Jessie Pace (1877-1959) also lived in part of the house.\n\nIn Jean’s later years, many Vancouver residents and visitors still had fond memories of Glencoe Lodge. In 1946, the Vancouver Province published an article about the Lodge, which also included some of Jean’s recollections about the Mollison family history.\n\nJean died at her home on Davie Street on March 23, 1951.\n\nIn June 1951, a bailiff sold Jean’s furniture and antiques to recover the rent that was owing to her landlord.\n\nOther Children of James Mollison and Anne Bisset\n\nAnne Elizabeth Mollison\n\nAnne Elizabeth Mollison was born at Kinchyle, Inverness, Scotland on August 5, 1854. (She was often called “Annie.”)\n\nIn 1861, she was living with her parents in Wick, Caithness, Scotland. In 1871, she was with her parents in Dochgarroch, Invernessshire. In 1881, she was with her father in Dochgarroch.\n\nFrom the late 1880s to the early 1900s, Annie and her sister, Jean, were managers at several Canadian Pacific Railway hotels, including Banff, Field, Lake Louise, Glacier House, and North Bend. In 1889, one of the Mollison sisters appeared in a society note in the Calgary Herald.\n\nIn 1904, Annie and Jean bought the former residence of Anglican Bishop Cyprian Pinkham at 215 Fourth Avenue S.W. in Calgary. They began to run it as a private hotel that they called Braemar Lodge.\n\nSoon Annie and Jean acquired an annex to allow more guests to stay at the Lodge.\n\nIn 1906, Annie and Jean renovated and enlarged the Lodge. The cost was about $30,000.\n\nAnnie and Jean operated Braemar Lodge together until December 1914, when Jean sold her interest to Annie.\n\nAnnie continued to operate Braemar Lodge until she died in 1929.\n\nBraemar Lodge: Later Years\n\nAfter Annie Mollison died, Braemar Lodge continued to operate under a series of managers until the 1960s.\n\nIn 1964, Calgary Motor Products Limited bought the property to use as a parking lot.\n\nIn February 1965, while the former Lodge was being demolished, a fire started on the main floor of the east wing. The fire spread until it destroyed almost all of the building.\n\nCalgary Motor Products continued to use the property until the 1970s.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, a company called Rank City Wall planned to build a hotel on the former Braemar site. However, by 1975, the hotel project had become uneconomical, and the developers announced that they were building a group of office towers instead.\n\nIn 1976, Rank City Wall sold their interest to Olympia and York, a Toronto-based development company.\n\nIn 1978, Olympia and York was planning to go ahead with an office tower project.\n\nBy the fall of 1979, contractors were building the first part of the project, which was called “Esso Plaza.” (See: “Esso Plaza,” Calgary Architecture: The Boom Years 1972-1982, by Pierre S. Guimond and Brian R. Sinclair; Calgary, Detselig Enterprises Ltd., 1984, pages 38-39.)\n\nEsso Plaza officially opened on June 29, 1981.\n\nAfter Olympia and York’s financial failures in the 1990s, the office complex became known as “Fifth Avenue Place.”\n\nJames William Mollison\n\nJames William Mollison was born in Dores, Inverness, Scotland on July 9, 1857.\n\nIn 1861, he was living with his parents in Wick, Caithness, Scotland. In 1871, he was with his parents in Dochgarroch, Invernessshire, Scotland.\n\nIn 1877, he won prizes for achievement at the Cirencester Agricultural College.\n\nIn 1881, he was a farm manager in Collingbourne-Kingston, Wiltshire, England.\n\nIn 1885, James Mollison, Junior of Pavenham, Bedfordshire won prizes for poultry at the agricultural show at Preston. (He had already been in Canada by this time, so he may have returned to England, or perhaps someone entered the poultry under his name.)\n\nIn the 1880s, he was a manager of the Waldron Ranch Company in what is now southern Alberta.\n\nOn October 16, 1890, in the parish of St. Paul, Deptford, in London, England, James married Katherine Hardy. She was born on June 6, 1866, in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire. Her parents were Henry Hardy (1834–1881) and Mary Cattle (born about 1836). The wedding register described James as a “professor of agriculture.”\n\nAbout 1890, James and Katherine went to India, where James began a career as a scientific agriculturalist. On November 24, 1890, he became the superintendent of farms in Bombay. In October 1901, he received an appointment as Inspector-General of Agriculture for the Government of India.\n\nWhile James and Katherine were in India, they had a son, Robert Wallace Mollison, who was born in Poona (now Pune), India on April 14, 1892.\n\nKatherine died on the island of Guernsey on January 24, 1897.\n\nJames published works on agriculture in India, including Cultivation of the Betel-Palm, Cardamom and Pepper in the Kanara District of the Bombay Presidency (1900); and A Text-Book of Indian Agriculture (1901).\n\nOn September 18, 1901, in Holborn, Camden, England, James married Edith Mary McRae. She was born in Beddington, Surrey about 1859. Her parents were James McRae and Georgina Jane Roberts.\n\nIn 1911, James and Edith were living at a house called Ascotts in Felbridge, East Grinstead, Sussex. The 1911 England census described James as the Inspector General of Agriculture, Indian Service, on leave.\n\nJames became a Companion in the Order of the Star of India in 1911.\n\nHe retired in 1912.\n\nHe died on October 4, 1927.\n\nThe obituary notice in The Times of London stated that James was born in Canada, rather than in Scotland. (The Canadian newspapers that carried a version of the obituary also said that he was born in Canada.)\n\nIn 1939, Edith Mollison was living in Esher, Surrey, England.\n\nEdith died on July 8, 1948.\n\nRobert Wallace Mollison (son of James William Mollison)\n\nJames William Mollison and Katherine Hardy had a son named Robert Wallace Mollison, who was born in Poona (now Pune), India on April 14, 1892.\n\nIn March 1897, he travelled with his aunt, Martha Hardy, from Southampton, England to New York City.

She died in Vancouver on March 3, 1920.\n\nDuring his early working life, Robert worked as a journalist.\n\nOn January 20, 1915, in Toronto, Ontario, he signed his attestation paper to join the Canadian Expeditionary Force during the First World War. His next of kin was his father, James Mollison, whose address was near East Grinstead in Surrey, England.\n\nOn December 20, 1915, the Canadian military forces discharged Robert, which allowed him to obtain a commission in the British R.F.A. (Royal Field Artillery).\n\nAfter the war, Robert lived with his father at Ascotts, near East Grinstead.\n\nIn 1920, he travelled to Vancouver to visit his aunt, Jean, at Glencoe Lodge.\n\nAt the time of the 1921 Canada census, Robert was living on Highview Crescent in Toronto, Ontario. He was working as a manager of an electrical appliance business.\n\nThe 1922 Toronto directory described him as a salesman with Blue Bird Sales Limited, a Toronto-based firm that sold electrical appliances.\n\nAbout 1922, Robert immigrated to the United States, where he worked as a sales manager.\n\nOn August 26, 1925, in Wellington Villa, Virginia, he married Katherine Peabody Rice. She was born in Ottumway, Iowa on June 6, 1896. Her parents were George Samuel Rice and Julia Maria Sessions.\n\nIn 1935, Katherine inherited a portion of a large estate from her wealthy uncle, Nelson Stanley Spencer.\n\nKatherine was a talented painter who used “Kay Mollison” as her professional name.\n\nFor some time, Robert and Katherine lived at 37 Glen Road in Wellesley, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1940, Robert applied to become a naturalized United States citizen.\n\nHe became a naturalized citizen on November 18, 1940.\n\nRobert’s and Katherine’s marriage ended in divorce.

Harry was a commercial artist, teacher, and author, who was known for his paintings of seascapes and boating scenes. He had earlier been married to Madeleine Grace Waters (1897-1964).\n\nKatherine died in Torrington, Connecticut on June 8, 1980.\n\nHarry Ballinger died in 1993.\n\nRobert Wallace Mollison and Katherine Rice had two children: Oliver Spencer Mollison and Jean Katherine Mollison.\n\nOliver Spencer Mollison\n\nOliver Spencer Mollison was born in Moorestown, New Jersey on July 23, 1926.\n\nHe served as a commissioned officer in the United States Navy.\n\nIn 1949 he married Barbara Polsey.\n\nOliver was living in San Mateo, California in the early 1990s. He died on April 18, 1992.\n\nJean Katherine Mollison\n\nJean Katherine Mollison was in Moorestown, New Jersey on July 30, 1927.\n\nShe studied at Smith College.\n\nOn April 4, 1959, in Arlington, Virginia, she married Luther Russel Gobbel, who was a lawyer with the United States Navy.

Mollison arrived in Canada on July 23, 1889.\n\nOn February 20, 1894, Hellen married Thomas Foreman Patterson in Calgary, Northwest Territories.\n\nThomas was born on July 10, 1864. (His birthplace was either in England or Quebec; the sources are not consistent.) His parents were Andrew Jeffrey Patterson and Elizabeth Foreman.\n\nAt the time of the 1901 Canada census, Thomas, Hellen and their son, Jack, were living in Nelson, British Columbia. Thomas was a locomotive foreman.\n\nIn 1905, they were in Kenora, Ontario, where Thomas was a locomotive foreman.\n\nIn 1911, they lived in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Thomas was a master mechanic with the Canadian Pacific Railway.\n\nIn 1921, they were at Glacier, British Columbia.

He was born in London, England on July 9, 1864. His parents were Francis Cancellor and Frances Emily Webb.\n\nHerbert was a caterer and manager of several hotels in British Columbia.\n\nIn 1899, he was with the Pine Tree Hotel, at Discovery, near Atlin.\n\nIn 1905, Herbert became a justice of the peace in Atlin.\n\nThe 1911 Canada census described Herbert as a farmer, living at Chemainus, North Cowichan.\n\nFor a time, Herbert was associated with Cameron Lake Chalet, which was a combination station and hotel that the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway built at the east end of Cameron Lake.\n\nIn 1915, Herbert and his brother, Fred, took over the Brentwood Hotel at Saanichton Inlet.\n\nBy 1920, Herbert was a farmer in Summerland, British Columbia.\n\nIn 1924, Herbert and Jessie moved to Chemainus on Vancouver Island.\n\nJessie died in Vancouver on December 10, 1929.

In 1881, he was with his father at Dochgarroch.\n\nWhile Andrew was in Scotland, he had become ill with tuberculosis. Some medical advisors in those days thought that a climate of sunshine, dry air, and high altitude might improve the health of tuberculosis patients. Parts of western Canada had this type of climate, so that may have been one of the reasons that the Mollisons moved to Canada.\n\nIn 1891, Andrew was with his father at Willow Creek near Fort MacLeod in the Northwest Territories.\n\nThe climate in Canada did not stop the tuberculosis. Andrew died on September 17, 1891, and he was buried in the Union Cemetery at Fort MacLeod.\n\nFrederick William Alpin Gordon Haultain (1857-1942), a lawyer and politician who was then living in Fort Macleod, became the interim receiver to look after Andrew’s estate.\n\nRobert Bisset Mollison\n\nRobert Bisset Mollison was born on February 7, 1869 at Tain, Ross and Cromarty, Scotland.\n\nIn 1871, he was living with his parents at Dochgarroch, Scotland.

The company acquired eleven large tracts of land (about 10,000 acres or 4000 hectares apiece) from Balgonie, Saskatchewan to Namaka, Alberta, on which it was intended to use the latest methods of cultivation and breeding. In 1888 the company purchased the cattle of the Powder River Cattle Company and entered the ranching business. In 1889 D.H. Andrews was appointed manager of the stock operations. The Stair Ranch, near Redcliff, Alberta, was one of the tracts of land kept primarily as a ranching operation. Andrews started the Canada Land and Ranch Company in 1895 and took over CACCC’s operations.”\n\nCanadian Agricultural, Coal, and Colonization Company, Sunday Times (London, England), June 8, 1890, page 2, column 5.\n\nHistory of Saskatchewan and The Old North West; Chapter XLIII – Colonization Companies and Analogous Enterprises: Anglo-Saxon Immigration; https://www.electriccanadian.com/history/saskatchewan/sask/chapter43.htm:\n\n“A similar history has to be recorded in regard to the John Lister Kaye farms. Sir John’s first investment consisted of some six sections of lands near Balgonie, which he commenced to farm in 18S5. Associated with him in this venture were Lord Queensbury and others. In 1888 there was formed the Canadian Agricultural, Coal and Colonization Company, Limited. This concern took over the Balgonie farm and established nine others. These various farms averaged thirty-six square miles each in area.\n\nUnfortunately the immediately available capital was invested with injudicious haste in buildings, stock and implements, and the management of the farms in many ways soon manifested deplorable ignorance of prairie conditions. The policy of the company was directed by a board in England, the majority of whom had never seen this country. As a colonization enterprise the whole scheme proved the same failure that it was as an investment. In a few years, however, some of the farms were sold and the control of the others passed to a new organization, the last of these being the Canada Land and Ranch Co., which under the management of practical business men proved profitable.”\n\nAnne Bisset (wife of James Mollison)\n\n“Scotland Births and Baptisms, 1564-1950”, database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XBS8-DG6 : 12 February 2020), Anne Bisset, 1830.\n\nAncestry.com. 1841 Scotland Census [database on-line].

Mollison is understood to have been an employee, a housekeeper according to one source, work location not known. With CP’s clear understanding of the value of positive PR (and particularly the naming of the Cheng interchange, which was rather widely trumpeted), it is somewhat surprising to me that more has not been made of the several new stations in this service area.

The name is thought to be derived from “The Shiel” which is a river running down the glen where an historic Scottish battle took place between the Jacobites and the English in 1719. Cancellor was a member of the Active Militia and went overseas with the Canadian Expeditionary Force during WWI in 1915.”\n\nThen and Now: The Glenshiel Hotel, by Ted Ross, James Bay Beacon, August 8, 2019; https://www.jamesbaybeacon.com/home/2019/8/8/then-and-now-the-glenshiel-hotel\n\n“A Plea for Help,” Victoria Historical Society Publication, Winter, 2006/2007; https://victoriahistoricalsociety.bc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/010-VHS-Newsletter-Winter2007.pdf.

It was initially operated by a series of private owners and was considered one of the best places to stay in Victoria. There was a strong Scottish connection and many of the original managers were retired army captains associated with the Scottish Regiments”\n\n“Yesterday and today: The Glenshiel embraces its second century,” Victoria News, April 1, 2019; https://www.vicnews.com/marketplace/yesterday-and-today-the-glenshiel-embraces-its-second-century/: “A Mr. L.E. Gooding named his new 20-room hotel The Criterion in 1908, a time when a city construction boom also saw the Empress Hotel and a final addition to St. Joseph’s Hospital built. In 1912, new owners of the hotel renamed it after the Glenshiel Estate owned by the Earls of Seaforth in the Scottish Highlands.”\n\nCameron Lake Chalet\n\n“The Chalet at Cameron Lake,” Alberni Valley Times (Alberni, British Columbia), March 17, 1969, page 3, columns 1-5.\n\n“Cameron Lake Chalet was the Place to be,” by Jan Peterson, Alberni Valley Times (Alberni, British Columbia), April 20, 1989, page 4, columns 2-3.\n\nAlbert Morton Monks (operator of Cameron Lake Chalet)\n\nAlbert Moreton Monks (1883–1917); Birth: JAN 1883, Colchester, Essex, England; Death: 21 AUG 1917, Lens, France (ancestry.ca).\n\n“England and Wales Birth Registration Index, 1837-2008,” database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2XK1-7Y2 : 1 October 2014), Albert Morton Monks, 1883; from “England & Wales Births, 1837-2006,” database, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : 2012); citing Birth Registration, Colchester, Essex, England, citing General Register Office, Southport, England.\n\n“England and Wales Census, 1891,” database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:4NWZ-96Z : 3 May 2019), Albert M Monks in household of William Monks, Ipswich St Mary Stoke, Ipswich, Suffolk, England, United Kingdom; from “1891 England, Scotland and Wales census,” database and images, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : n.d.); citing PRO RG 12, Suffolk county, subdistrict, The National Archives of the UK, Kew, Surrey.\n\n“England and Wales Census, 1901,” database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:X9N2-G7W : 20 May 2019), Albert M Monks in household of Mount Blatch, Colchester, Essex, England, United Kingdom; from “1901 England, Scotland and Wales census,” database and images, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : n.d.); citing Colchester Second Ward subdistrict, PRO RG 13, The National Archives, Kew, Surrey.\n\n“Recensement du Canada de 1911,” database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QV95-MWZ4 : 16 March 2018), Albert Martin Monks in entry for James T Young, 1911; citing Census, New Westminster Sub-Districts 21-47, British Columbia, Canada, Library and Archives of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario; FHL microfilm 2,417,661.\n\n“British Columbia Marriage Registrations, 1859-1932; 1937-1938,” database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:JD8J-ZPD : 6 April 2020), Albert Morton Monks and May Sairatard, 03 Aug 1912; citing Port Moody, British Columbia, Canada, British Columbia Archives film number B11383, Vital Statistics Agency, Victoria; FHL microfilm 1,983,976.\n\nName: Monks, Albert Morton; Rank: LT; Date of Birth: 1882-06-20; Reference: RG 150, Accession 1992-93/166, Box 6295 – 6; Item Number: 183949; Record Group: Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF); https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/military-heritage/first-world-war/personnel-records/Pages/item.aspx?IdNumber=183949; Digitized service file: B6295-S006; http://central.bac-lac.gc.ca/.item/?op=pdf&app=CEF&id=B6295-S006.\n\n“Find A Grave Index,” database, FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QVKR-1KJK : 14 July 2020), Albert Merton Monks, 1917; Burial, , ; citing record ID , Find a Grave, https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/56681437/_: “LT Albert Morton Monks; Birth: 20 Jun 1882; Ipswich, Ipswich Borough, Suffolk, England; Death: 21 Aug 1917 (aged 35); Burial: Vimy Memorial; Vimy, Departement du Pas-de-Calais, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, France; Plot: Final resting place unknown.
