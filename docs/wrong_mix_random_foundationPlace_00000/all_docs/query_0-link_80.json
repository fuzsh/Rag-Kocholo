One is the work Patricia Ebrey did in the late 1970s with support from an NEH grant that led to Chinese Civilization and Society: A Sourcebook (New York: Free Press, 1981). Over a period of about three years, a group of graduate students at the University of Illinois working with Pat looked for texts that would make good classroom reading, then drafted translations. Pat went over them all, did some translations herself, wrote the introductions, and tested them in class. So many pieces were translated that publishing them all in a single volume became impossible, so Pat set aside several longer autobiographical pieces, thinking they might one day be published in a set of personal accounts. Four of the pieces included here were resurrected from the old paper copies that had been sitting in file folders for decades. They had to be shortened to be included here but are still among the longer pieces. Another point of origin is our history together. This goes back to the 1990s, when first Ping Yao and later Cong Ellen Zhang entered the graduate program at the University of Illinois, took courses with Pat, and became good friends with each other. Although we have since scattered, a quarter century later we still read and discuss each other’s work. Together, the three of us edited Chinese Funerary Biographies: An Anthology of Remembered Lives (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2019). That volume, having begun with a workshop, contained translations by nineteen different scholars. This time we thought we would try doing most of the translations ourselves, making consistency easier to achieve. Ping largely did the first drafts of the pieces through the Tang, and Cong and Pat the ones for later periods, but we each spent quite a bit of time going over the others’ work, so have not credited translations to one person. In the end, we also chose to include four translations by other scholars.\n\nSince we were happy with the University of Washington Press’s handling of the earlier anthology volume and enjoyed working with Lorri Hagman and her team, we turned to them with this volume as well. We were particularly impressed this time by the highly qualified readers they found to review our manuscript. We would like to publicly thank them for the obvious care they took in going through both the Chinese and English texts and the many suggestions for better phrasing they offered, almost all of which we happily adopted.\n\nx Preface and Acknowledgments\n\nTranslation Conventions Translators always aim for a balance between conveying the meaning and capturing the style, between achieving fluency and minimizing inaccuracies. Here are some of the principles we tried to follow in seeking such a balance. In Chinese, it is not necessary to supply the subject for a sentence, especially when it is obvious from context, but subjects are needed in English, so we routinely supply them. In addition, in Chinese it is not odd to refer to oneself in the third person, and in some cases would be considered respectful (referring to oneself as “your subject” when addressing the ruler, for instance). In Chinese, repeated use of “I” can seem egotistic or self-centered. In English, by contrast, referring to oneself in the third person can come across as pretentious or evidence of mental illness. This creates a tricky situation for the translator, as authors wrote about themselves in the third person for a variety of reasons, sometimes to make fun of themselves, sometimes simply because it suggested to them greater objectivity: they were giving not just opinions but facts. Here we have often switched to the first person in keeping with English style but have kept some in the third person so that readers can get a better sense of the flavor of the original, especially in cases where gentle self-mockery was involved. Since our primary goal was to prepare translations that people would enjoy reading, we made an effort to translate as much as possible, rather than supply Chinese terms in romanization, with just four exceptions: jinshi, the highest rank conferred in the civil service examinations, literally “presented scholar” li, a unit of distance, approximately one-third of a mile or half a kilometer mu, a unit of area about a sixth of an acre qi, a now widely recognized philosophical term that refers to energy, including energy that courses through the body\n\nIn the case of other common units of measurement, we supply conventional translations, but it should be kept in mind that these are only roughly equivalent and there was, moreover, considerable change over time and regional variation. Thus we translate chi as foot, cun as inch, jin as catty, dou as peck, hu as bushel, and shi as picul. For units of currency, we translate qian as cash and liang as tael. We normally supply the name of the modern province in brackets after place names. We translate xian as county in all periods. When office titles are listed in Charles Hucker’s A Dictionary of Official Titles in Imperial China (1985), we use his translation. We give dates and reign periods in their original form, putting in brackets the Western year with which it overlaps the most, but we do not convert to the Western calendar. We similarly do not convert people’s ages, simply giving their age in sui, which on average will make them seem a year older than if the count followed Western convention, but can be almost two years, as sui counts people as one at their birth and two on the next New Year’s Day.\n\nxii Translation Conventions\n\nChronology of Imperial China with Authors of Autobiographies Shang (ca. 1500–1045 BCE) Zhou (1045–256 BCE) Warring States period (475–221 BCE) Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) Western Han (202 BCE–9 CE) Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BCE) Eastern Han (25–220 CE) Wang Chong (27–ca. 97 CE) Zheng Xuan (127–200) Cai Yan (ca. 177–ca. 249) Cao Cao (155–220) and his son Cao Pi (187–226) Three Kingdoms period (220–265) Zuo Fen (ca. 253–300) Western Jin (265–316) Eastern Jin (317–420) Southern Dynasties (317–589) Emperor Wu (r. 502–549) of the Liang Northern Dynasties (386–581) Northern Wei (386–534) Sui dynasty (581–618) Tang dynasty (618–907) Han Yu (768–824) Bai Juyi (772–846) Lu Guimeng (ca. 836–881)\n\nFive Dynasties (907–960) Liao dynasty (916–1125) Song dynasty (960–1279) Northern Song (960–1126) Liu Kai (948–1001) Han Qi (1008–1075) Southern Song (1127–1279) Lou Yue (1137–1213) Yelü Chucai (1190–1244) Yuan Haowen (1190–1257) Yuan dynasty (1234–1368) Wen Tianxiang (1236–1283) Xie Yingfang (1296–1392) Ming dynasty (1368–1644) Tan Yunxian (1461–1556) Xu Wei (1521–1593) Ai Nanying (1583–1646) Madame Zhong (fl. 1570–1620) Chen Qide (fl. 1640s) Qing dynasty (1644–1912) Pu Songling (1640–1715) Luo Fenpeng (b. 1726) Wang Huizu (1730–1807) Zeng Guofan (1811–1872) Liu Tang (1844–1929)\n\nChinese Autobiographical Writing\n\nIntroduction Today, the memoir is a very common form of literature. Celebrities of all sorts—performers, athletes, novelists—write accounts of their lives before and after gaining fame. Aspiring politicians write about their lives to introduce themselves to potential supporters. Those who complete terms as president generally write memoirs of their time in high office and how they managed crises and opportunities. Those who served under them also often write about their experiences, evidence that facts are slippery—people remember the same event differently, even when they were in the same room, and readers must always consider the possibility of self-serving distortions. Today even relatively unknown people write about their lives, knowing that there are readers interested in compelling stories written in the first person, especially if they bring them into worlds quite different from their own. Humorists, too, often draw extensively on their own experiences, making fun not of families or workplaces in general but the family or workplace they had to put up with. Memoirs today are often book-length, but magazines and newspapers regularly publish shorter pieces that are written in the first person. Reporters, for instance, when covering wars or catastrophes, regularly put themselves in the story, reporting where they were, what they saw, whom they talked to, trying to convey the moment they lived through. The popularity of this sort of writing, which draws attention to the author as a person, reflects modern notions of the self and authenticity but also draws on Western literary traditions going back centuries. Early examples include such works as the Letters of Pliny the Younger and the Confessions of Saint Augustine. In China before modern times, it was less common for authors to write book-length memoirs or even to write shorter pieces that center on their own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. But the personal accounts that were\n\nwritten are well worth reading. They differ in many regards from modern memoirs and have their own history of conventions, but they share some of the immediacy of personal testimony that we expect from memoirs. They help us understand notions of self, interpersonal relations, and historical events. Of course, like memoirs today, they need to be read critically. Not every piece that presents itself as a person’s own account should be taken at face value, and people writing about themselves are not always fully honest. Many excellent examples of Chinese autobiographical writing have already been translated into English and are widely available (a list is included as an appendix). The central goal of this volume is to make more such personal accounts accessible to readers of English. The pieces selected for translation belong to many literary genres—poetry, letters, diaries, brief anecdotes, reports, confessions, prefaces or postfaces to books, self-written funerary biographies, not to mention a few works explicitly identified as autobiographies. In choosing pieces to translate, we looked above all for engaging works that draw us into the past or provide vivid details of life as it was lived. Some focus on a person’s entire life, others on a specific moment. Some have an element of humor; others are entirely serious. In our choices we put a priority on capturing the diversity of what survives: pieces from different periods, different genres, by both men and women, by more obscure people as well as more famous ones. We also looked for pieces that would help illuminate the history and conventions of writing about oneself in the Chinese tradition. For the earliest period, we retranslated pieces that already were available in English in order to illustrate key facets of the development of ways of writing about oneself, many of them relatively short, but for later periods, with more works available, we have chosen pieces not previously translated, some of them substantially longer. In this book, each selection begins by introducing the author and the piece. Readers will want to keep in mind the circumstances of the author and his or her purposes in writing. To help readers place it within the larger Chinese tradition of writing about oneself, basic features of that tradition are sketched below. Key developments took place in the Zhou and Han periods, but much more survives from later periods, as rising literacy, the expansion of the printing industry, and the flourishing of literati culture encouraged more people to write about their personal experiences and made preservation of their writings more likely. 2 Introduction\n\nWriting about Oneself in Verse Perhaps the most common way to express one’s innermost thoughts was through poetry. Many of the poems in The Classic of Poetry (Shijing) can be read as expressions of personal feelings or experiences, but we rarely know anything about the author outside the poem itself. A new stage was reached with the poems traditionally attributed to Qu Yuan (ca. 340–278 BCE), an aristocrat in the state of Chu who lost the favor of his king and eventually killed himself. “Sorrow” (Lisao) is taken to represent his laments about his fate, his defense of his virtues, and his attacks on those who defamed him. Whether or not actually written by Qu Yuan, the poem is ranked as a masterpiece and read as an expression of personal feelings. Among its best-known lines are “Long did I sigh and wipe away tears, sad that men’s lives lay in such peril” and “On and on stretched my road, long it was and far, I would go high and go low, in this search that I made.”1 Both have been understood as the poet’s passionate expression of his lofty aspirations. Poetry remained a dominant genre for writing about oneself well into the nineteenth century. Many examples could be cited, among them quite a few by women writers, beginning with three in the Han period (202 BCE–220 CE), Ban Zhao (45–117), Ban Jieyu (Consort Ban, 48 BCE–2 CE), and Cai Yan (Cai Wenji, ca. 177–ca. 249). Ban Zhao was born to one of the most prominent scholarly families of the Eastern Han (25–220). She is best known for serving as adviser to the palace ladies; helping her father, Ban Biao (3–54), and brother Ban Gu (32–92) finish History of the Han (Hanshu); and authoring Lessons for Women (Nüjie), one of the most important texts for women’s education in imperial times. In the history of autobiographical writing, Ban Zhao’s Rhapsody on a Journey to the East (Dongzheng fu) occupies an important place. The rhapsody (fu) depicts a trip she took with her son in 113 when he was assuming a position in Henan. Ban wrote: Now, in the seventh year of Eternal Renewal I accompanied my son on his eastern journey. On an auspicious day in the first month of spring We chose a good time and set out on our way. I then lifted my foot and climbed into the carriage And that night we lodged in the town of Yanshi. Introduction 3\n\nLeaving our friends there, we headed for strangers, My mind was disturbed and my heart full of grief. By the time dawn broke, I’d still not been able to sleep, And my lingering heart still refused to obey. After describing her reluctance to leave the capital, Ban describes the changes of scenery, the hardships she endured, and the sufferings of the common people that she witnessed. Ban Zhao recalls Confucius’s misfortunes on the road and declares that “great virtue will never decay.” At the end of the rhapsody, she adds, “The Classics and Canons teach only one thing: The Way and its virtue, humanity and wisdom.”2 Ban Zhao perhaps wanted to avoid seeming to feel too sorry for herself. Her great-aunt, Consort Ban, a century earlier, had shown no such reluctance. Once favored by Emperor Cheng (r. 32–7 BCE), she became the target of other consorts. Afraid that she might be framed through palace politics, she asked to serve the empress dowager instead of the emperor. Her “Self-Mourning Rhapsody” (Zishang fu) starts with her entrance into the palace and selection as the emperor’s favorite, then depicts her determination to follow the examples of the virtuous women in the past and her grief over losing a son. The focus of her writing, however, is on her sad, solitary life after demotion: My mind dissolves in this place so silent, If you do not grace me, who is my glory? I gaze down at the vermilion steps, And imagine Your embroidered shoes. I gaze up at Your mist-covered house, And tears course down my cheeks.3 Consort Ban’s rhapsody is one of the earliest pieces in the tradition of the lament of the neglected woman (often, in later times, written by men in the voice of a woman). Another Han woman, Zhuo Wenjun, the wife of the famous scholar Sima Xiangru, was credited with contributing to this topic in her own words. Years after Zhuo, a widow, eloped with Sima, an event that made them celebrities, Sima decided to take a concubine. Disheartened by her husband’s “betrayal,” Zhuo composed “White Hair Lament” (Baitou yin), in which she bemoaned:\n\n4 Introduction\n\nAs brilliant as the snow on yonder mountain, As splendid as the moon amidst the clouds— I have been told that you now love another, And so I’ve come to say goodbye forever. ............................................. How sad and lonely, oh, how sad and lonely! When one gets married, there’s no need to cry: Just hope to find a man who’ll always love you, And will not leave you when your hair turns white.4 Several of our selections build on this tradition of using poetry to narrate defining moments or dramatic events in women’s lives. Selection 7 includes two poems attributed to Cai Wenji, a woman captured by the Xiongnu and later able to return but without her sons. Selections 9 and 23 are by neglected consorts, Zuo Fen in the Western Jin and Consort Zhong in the Ming. Men were just as active. Among the works of Tang and Song poets are thousands of works with “self ” (zi) in the title (such as laughing at myself, warning myself, pitying myself, and so on). Su Song (1020–1101) offers a good example. One of his autobiographical poems has a long title: “For many years, my request for retirement was refused, but a recent imperial edict granted me a sinecure position and I returned home. Living in leisure and having little to do, I thought back over my whole life and was moved to write a hundred-line poem. I have done this to enable my sons and grandsons to understand what I have lived through. I also intend this poem to serve as family instructions. For this reason, I have chosen to use plain language.” Three-fourths (74 out of 100 lines) of the poem recollects Su’s life from boyhood to retirement, touching on his studies, travels, official appointments, mourning his parents, and imperial favors. Many other Tang and Song poets used verse to depict their daily life, joy and grief, family and friends, travels and spiritual life, and career and pursuits. They muse over the most personal, private, enjoyable, embarrassing, or regretful moments of their lives and sometimes address weighty topics such as poverty, career setbacks, death, and old age (see selection 15).\n\nIntroduction 5\n\nRecounting One’s Life as a Preface or Postface to a Book The earliest autobiography presented as a supplement to a book was written by China’s first great historian, Sima Qian (145–ca. 86 BCE). The last chapter of his monumental Historical Records (Shiji) recounts his own story. He starts with his family’s glorious past, rich traditions of scholarship, and his own early education. Sima then details his extensive travels to different parts of China in his twenties and later as an official during Emperor Wu’s (r. 141–87 BCE) reign. Above all, Sima Qian highlights his role and that of his father, Sima Tan, as court historians; their ambition to write a general history of China; and the structure of The Historical Records. One episode of Sima’s self-narration has remained powerful and memorable. It features a conversation between the father and son at the father’s deathbed, when Sima Tan entrusted Sima Qian with his writing project. Sima Qian wrote, “I bowed my head and wept, saying, ‘I, your son, am ignorant and unworthy, but I shall endeavor to set forth in full the reports of antiquity that have come down from our ancestors. I dare not be remiss.’”5 Both the father and son understood this undertaking as a filial gesture from a son to his father and the duty of a historian. Later authors often took advantage of the precedent set by Sima Qian to write about themselves at the beginning or end of a book they wrote. Many are included in this book (selections 5, 8, 10, 18, 20, 22, and 27). Clearly, taking advantage of the completion of a book to write about oneself remained attractive to writers throughout the imperial period. We do not include perhaps the most famous example, Li Qingzhao’s (1084–ca. 1115) “Afterword to Records on Metal and Stone,” as it is already available in multiple excellent translations (see the appendix). Today it is often cited in discussion of female talent and marital relations.\n\nAdapting Conventions of Biography Chinese autobiographical writing also is heavily indebted to the biography tradition. Here the great figure is once again Sima Qian, who established biographical accounts (zhuan) as a legitimate and powerful form of historical writing. Seventy of the 130 chapters of Historical Records contain biographies of about 150 individuals, some just a few lines long, others dozens of pages in length. Although the majority of Sima’s subjects were rulers and their 6 Introduction\n\nministers, he compiled biographies of men and women notable for other achievements, ranging from philosophers and businessmen to assassins and private advisers. Biographical accounts in this tradition became standard features of dynastic histories and gazetteers in subsequent centuries. From early on, this form was adapted by writers who wrote about themselves, often in an ironic or mocking tone. Here the most influential early work was by the Eastern Jin poet Tao Qian (Yuanming, ca. 365–427). Written in the last year of his life, Tao’s “Biography of Master Five Willows” begins with the following sentences: “We don’t know what age the master lived in, and we aren’t certain of his real name. Beside his cottage were five willow trees, so he took his name from them.”6 It then lists the three things that were central to Tao’s life: reading, drinking, and writing. In contrast to Sima Qian’s commitment to politics, morality, family obligations, and scholarly achievements, Tao Qian focused on the individual and private life. Using plain language, he claimed to be contented with a simple life and indifferent to tangible gains and losses. Many of Tao’s poems similarly projected himself as a wine-loving, carefree person in perfect harmony with his surroundings, nature, and the Way. Tao Qian also composed his own eulogy, writing as though he was already dead, in which he declared that, after a life following the Way, he left this world with no regrets. After imagining his own death and funeral, he concluded, “Life was truly difficult. I wonder how death will be?”7 Self-written biographies that followed in Tao Qian’s tradition tended to avoid the author’s real name and were customarily written in the third person. The use of the third person gave the author important narrative freedom. It also drew on the custom of acquiring multiple names: in addition to their given and courtesy names, traditional Chinese scholars often acquired one or more hao (sobriquets) at different stages of their lives. Tao Yuanming became known as Master Five Willows because of the willow trees next to his residence. Bai Juyi (772–846) entitled his autobiography “Biography of Master Drunken Poet” and Liu Kai “Biography of the Country Fellow of the Eastern Suburb” (selections 11 and 13). In the Song and later, some authors centered their accounts on their studio or residence, describing not only the physical structures but also their symbolic meanings. These accounts often highlighted the author’s family and educational background as well as philosophical affiliations and spiritual life (selection 19). Chinese biographical writing continued to develop and grow richer in later centuries, and these new developments continued to also shape autoIntroduction 7\n\nbiographical writing. Two important developments were the prominence of funerary biographies (especially funerary inscriptions, muzhiming) in Tang and Song times and the development of a form of book-long biographies organized year by year (nianpu) in the Song period. As writing funerary biographies for friends, relatives, and acquaintances became common among literati, some men, often in a humorous vein, drafted ones for themselves. An example included in this volume is Xu Wei’s (1521–1593) “Self-Authored Funerary Biography” (selection 21). In the Song period the first book-length biographies were written. These annalistic biographies were at first done for important Tang men of letters in an effort to associate their writings with what was going on in their lives when they wrote the piece, listing both events and literary works in chronological order, year by year. By the end of the Song period one prominent figure (Wen Tianxiang) wrote an autobiography using the year-by-year style. This became more common in the late Ming and especially the Qing periods. By then the authors did not have to be major writers and the events listed for each year could be relatively ordinary ones (see selection 26 for Wang Huizu’s autobiography in this style).\n\nLetters and Diaries Personal letters afford authors opportunities to write about key events in their lives in a revealing manner. Sima Qian once again provided a model for later writers. In 98 BCE, Sima was imprisoned and later endured castration for defending the general Li Ling (134–74 BCE) following Li’s defeat by and surrender to the Xiongnu, the Han’s most formidable enemy. In a personal letter to Ren An, Sima Qian wrote: A man has only one death. That death may be as weighty as Mount Tai, or it may be as light as a goose feather. It all depends on the way he uses it. . . . It is the nature of every man to love life and hate death, to think of his relatives and take care of his wife and children. Only when a man is moved by principle is this not so. Then there are things he must do. . . . The brave man does not always die for honor, while even the coward may fulfill his duty. Each takes a different way to exert himself. Though I might be weak and cowardly and seek shamefully to prolong my life, yet I know full well the difference between what ought to be followed 8 Introduction\n\nand what rejected. . . . The reason I have not refused to bear these ills and have continued to live, dwelling among this filth, is that I grieve that I have things in my heart that I have not been able to express fully, and I am ashamed to think that after I am gone my writings will not be known to posterity.8 In order to achieve great things in life, Sima asserted, one should be ready to make large sacrifices. In this volume, some of the earliest pieces included are letters that have been accidently preserved, dating to Qin and Han times (selection 4). These do not have the high drama of Sima Qian’s letter, but do show that even ordinary letters help us imagine daily life in the past. We also have a letter from a prominent Confucian teacher and scholar, Zheng Xuan (127–200), to his son (selection 6). With the survival from late Tang on of individual authors’ collected works, personal letters exist in great abundance. The literary giant Su Shi (1037–1101) left behind more than two thousand letters. They allow us to appreciate, among other things, the many gifts that he sent to relatives, his favorite foods, his coming to terms with living in exile, and his circle of friends. Another voluminous-letter writer, the Qing (1644–1911) statesman Zeng Guofan (1811–1872), wrote thousands of letters to family members, friends, and colleagues (selection 29). The emergence of diary or journal writing provided another literary form for writing about one’s experiences. Most of the earliest extant diaries were written to record observations made during trips and stress the author’s firsthand knowledge. Several have been translated in full, among them Lu You’s (1125–1210) A Journey into Shu (Ru Shu ji) and Fan Chengda’s (1126–1293) Diary of a Boat Trip to Wu (Wuchuan lu). Here we have excerpts from Lou Yue’s (1137–1213) diary of his trip to the Jin court (selection 16). The Song period also witnessed the beginning of private journal writing. The historian and statesman Sima Guang (1021–1086), for example, kept a journal in the late 1060s and 1070s. His focus was on the major events at Emperor Shenzong’s (r. 1067–1085) court, including announcements, appointments, promotions, examinations, and so on. Many of his contemporaries claimed to have maintained regular journal entries to help them remember more casual yet memorable aspects of daily life, such as gathering with friends, hearing an amusing story, or trying a new fruit. In Ming times, individuals committed to Confucian moral cultivation also often kept diaries Introduction 9\n\nfull of self-reflection. They wrote of the temptations they faced, their thoughts and efforts to act in a right and responsible manner, aiming to monitor their shortcomings and their efforts to avoid them in the future. An early example is that of Wu Yubi (1392–1469), whose diary covers much of his adult life and records not just his efforts to improve himself but also his struggles to make ends meet as a teacher in a rural community.\n\nThe Testimony of Witnesses There are many reasons people may bear witness. Sometimes they have observed a crime and report what they saw to the authorities. The authorities, in turn, can compel those accused of the crime to account for their own actions. The ones that are extant today usually began as oral statements, transcribed by government clerks. Here we include a few from the Qin, Han, and Tang periods that survived by accident (selection 2). Thousands more survive in the Qing government archives and have proven a rich source for historians doing research on rebellions, legal practice, marriage customs, and similar issues. These are usually fairly straightforward, perhaps reflecting the government clerk’s editing. Normally, of course, the person testifying tries to make the best case for him or herself. Consider the 1748 confession of a tenant farmer charged with murdering a monk named Chengyuan who lived nearby. I’m from Lijiayuan of Xiaogan County and am fifty-five years old. My parents and my wife died a long time ago. I have only one son named Li Yifei and he left home to be a laborer in the seventh month of last year. The house I rented was returned to the original owner and since I had no place to live, I lived by myself in my brother Li Mingzhi’s place. I made a living on my own. My brother is a trader and doesn’t live at home. In his family, there’s only my sister-in-law and nobody else. Originally I rented two dou of land from Chengyuan. We split the grain equally and I never owed him anything. In 1745, he suddenly refused to let me rent the land. I asked him several times but he wouldn’t give in and I began to hate him. In the fall of 1746, I again begged him to be able to rent but he would not agree and said I was no good. I was really angry and had a quarrel with him but still never expressed my 10 Introduction\n\nanger. In the spring of 1747, he dug soil from my land to build up his paddy dike. We had another quarrel then. And so I hated him for a long time. Later he bought a few catties of wine to sell to others. I asked him if I could buy wine but he deliberately said he was sold out. Even though he had it, he refused to sell it to me. He was a monk! But he was an old, cunning, wicked man. He had no sense of compassion. He always insulted and bullied me. I really hated him and wanted to teach him a lesson. But I never had a chance, I couldn’t do anything until the evening of the 26th day of the 8th month of 1747. I had had some drinks and ran into Chengyuan who was coming home from drinking. I saw he was a little drunk and then remembered all the mean things he’d done to me in the past. I got furious and under the influence of the wine wanted to hurt him. I figured that since he was an old man, was drunk and slept by himself, he would go to bed early that night and would not have any protection. I tied a rope made of bark around my waist and intended to strangle him in his sleep. His confession then narrates many grizzly details of his hitting the monk with a club and an ax and trying to cover up his crime.9 In this case it is easy to imagine that the tenant farmer did not say all of this as a monologue, but rather that the scribe made a single tale by stringing together his responses to the questions he was asked. For instance, to make it easier to convict him of premeditated murder, the investigator may well have repeatedly tried to get him to admit long-standing enmity between him and his victim. Here we include a confession in a case that did not involve violence, but rather a type of fraud. An unsuccessful teacher dressed as an official and was able to get many people to offer him aid when they heard his hard-luck story (selection 25). Another type of testimony is written accounts of what the author observed during times of disorder, especially war and natural calamities. Believing that there should be some record of the suffering or harrowing experiences they witnessed or learned about, they tried to get the basic facts down on paper. A well-known example is Wang Xiuchu’s (17th c.) account of the slaughter of the population of Yangzhou during the Manchu invasion, “Ten Days in Yangzhou” (Yangzhou shiri). We include here writing by two key witnesses to the Mongol conquests of the Jin and the Song (selection 18). Their accounts are not as graphic, but they do help us imagine what living through these Introduction 11\n\ninvasions could mean. In the case of Wen Tianxiang, he was an active player in the drama who had devoted himself to the probably impossible task of stopping the Mongols from conquering the Song. Perceived social ills could also motivate men to write about what they learned, bearing witness against miscarriage of justice or inhumane treatment. An eighteenth-century example is Fang Bao’s account of what he learned about the spread of disease in a Beijing prison. Natural disasters and the hardships they created also motivated some to put on paper what they had observed. The two authors whose records are included in selection 24 tried to appear as objective witnesses, recording what the larger population in their home region suffered during weather-induced famines without drawing attention to how the disaster impacted their own lives. We also have the account of a young man captured by rebels who recorded his experiences and what he learned of the rebels (selection 28).\n\nWriting for Heirs When an author wrote about himself in a book that he expected to circulate widely—either before or after the spread of printing—he was anticipating an audience for his words that included people he did not know. In daily life, of course, people are most likely to talk about themselves with people they are close to, especially, perhaps, their own family members. Fathers in China, as elsewhere, drew on their own experience when giving advice to their sons and grandsons, and some of them took to writing this down, a genre referred to in Chinese as “family instructions” (jiaxun). They could do this briefly in the form of a letter (such as the letter by Zheng Xuan included here, selection 6). In the sixth century, Yan Zhitui (531–591) wrote a full book directed to his descendants that provided advice on such subjects as avoiding political dangers and cultivating both Confucian and Buddhist virtues. He often supported his arguments with examples from his own eventful life. Here are a few examples: Some people let books pile up on their desk or allow the scrolls to scatter all over the place; their young children, maids, or concubines often get the books dirty; wind, rain, dogs, and mice may spoil them. This is truly a blemish on their virtue. When I read the writings of the sages, I have always treated them with solemn respect. If an old piece 12 Introduction\n\nof paper happens to contain phrases and principles of the Five Classics or the names of worthy men, I would not dare use it for irreverent purposes. . . . In our family, as you boys have seen, we do not ever speak of praying and making pleas to the gods through male or female spirit-mediums, nor do we ever resort to Daoist talismans and sacrifices. Do not waste your time on such ridiculous superstitions. . . . Education must be carried out early so as not to lose the opportunity. When I was seven sui, I memorized the “Rhapsody on the Hall of Numinous Brilliance,” and even today I can still recite it if I review it once every ten years. As for the classics I read after turning twenty, I will forget them if I put them aside only for one month. . . . I once suffered from a loose tooth that was about to fall out; any cold or hot food or drink made it ache. I read about the method of preserving teeth in Master of Embracing Simplicity, that one should click one’s teeth three hundred times every morning. I did it for a number of days and my tooth was healed. Now I do it constantly. Such minor techniques are completely innocuous and you may very well try them. . . . The sons and daughters of my family, even during their early childhood, are drilled and corrected little by little. If they ever pronounce one thing wrong, I consider it my fault. As for objects and vessels made in our household, I will not presume to name them arbitrarily without consulting books and records first, as you boys know well. . . . You should pay some attention to the formal script and the draft script. . . . Since my early childhood I have followed our family tradition [in calligraphy]; in addition, I am fond of the art and value it. Thus I have seen many model calligraphies and also spent considerable time on appreciation and practice. Even though in the end I am unable to achieve excellence, it is simply because I have no talent for it.10 As there are two full translations of this important book, we do not include any extracts from it here. But we do have a set of letters from the leading nineteenth-century political figure Zeng Guofan (1811–1872) (selection 29) to his son that while filled with details of what was happening in the military campaigns clearly keeps in mind that he is addressing a family member he hopes to have an influence on. He brings in his own experience that he sees as most relevant to his son’s moral and intellectual development. Introduction 13\n\nRecounting Relations with Loved Ones The individual self does not develop in isolation but rather is fashioned within a nexus of personal relations: relations to parents, siblings, other relatives, friends, teachers, colleagues, lovers, and even sometimes enemies. Thus, authors who wrote about their relationships with people they were close to might reveal as much about themselves as about the subjects of their essays. Poetry provides us with the richest material about intimate relations between loved ones. A good example is the numerous exchanges between the most famous brothers in Chinese history, Su Shi (1037–1101) and Su Zhe (1039–1112). In a poem entitled “In Response to Ziyou’s [Su Zhe] Poem on Suffering from Cold Weather,” Su Shi describes the closeness he felt toward his younger brother and Su Zhe’s unrivaled place in his heart, even though the two spent most of their adult lives away from each other. Human beings live less than a hundred years. You and I have spent three years apart. How many more three years do I have? Once gone, I’ll never get them back. I fear that our separation Is speeding up the aging of my face and hair. In the past, I loved to write letters, Ever since we parted, I haven’t finished anything. Thinking back on all the fun we had together, I realize today’s sorrow was inevitable. Socializing with the leading talents in the world, Means less to me than sharing a good time with you. I am envious of your long period without official duties, Having spent so much time reading, lice live in your felt rug.11 Many elegies and funerary biographies can be read as personal accounts in addition to accounts of others. In this volume we have an elegy by Han Yu for his nephew and two by Han Qi for friends that can be read this way (selection 12). We also have a tribute a woman wrote for her husband and one a man did for his elder sister (selection 27). These are all relatively short. Better known are two considerably longer works written by men in the seventeenth and eighteenth century for women they were very close to. The 14 Introduction\n\nfirst is Mao Xiang’s (1611–1693) Reminiscences of the Plum Shadows Convent (Yingmei an yiyu), about his relationship with the courtesan Dong Bai, who died at the age of twenty-eight. The other memoir that can be read as a love story is Shen Fu’s (1763–1808?) Six Records of a Life Adrift (Fusheng liuji), in which he describes his life with his wife Yun and their many trials and tribulations, including estrangement from his parents.\n\nAltogether, this book contains works by fifty authors grouped into twenty-nine selections. The earliest, dated to the Western Zhou (1046–771 BCE), is a short bronze inscription, and the last, from the 1850s and 1860s, is a set of letters by the Qing statesman and scholar Zeng Guofan. Less than half of the authors were people of national stature based on their political, literary, or scholarly credentials; at the other end, a few of the authors are known solely from the piece we translate. Only nine pieces were written by women, which reflects the reality of literacy, education, and publishing. The three of us did all of the translations with four exceptions: selection 23, which was translated for this book by Zeyuan Wu; and three that had been previously published, selections 7, by Beata Grant and Wilt Idema; 9, by David Knechtges; and 25, by Mark McNicholas. Our own translations were fully collaborative, each of us going over the others’ drafts and offering corrections and suggestions. We invite readers to peruse these personal accounts in any order, as each can stand on its own. There is also an argument for reading them in chronological order, as that conveys a picture of Chinese history with individuals at the center and highlights cultural change by showing how people kept exploring ways to represent themselves in writing.\n\nNotes 1.

BCE) This inscription on a tenth-century BCE bronze vessel recounts a successful campaign against a neighboring Rong tribe. The leading commander dedicated the vessel to his mother in gratitude for her guidance and protection. Ancestor worship was a central religious practice in China from early times. During the Shang dynasty (ca. 1500–1045 BCE), pleasing and seeking instructions from the ancestors dominated every aspect of Shang society, and both male and female ancestors were assigned a date to be worshipped individually. With the Zhou dynasty (1045–256 BCE), patrilineal principles took priority and attention to female ancestors declined. While 97 percent of Shang dynasty sacrifices to a mother honored her in her own right, during the Western Zhou, this figure dropped to 64 percent. By the Han dynasty, female ancestors rarely received individual sacrifices. The inscription on the bronze vessel known as the Dong gui is one of the longest dedicated to a mother from the Shang or Zhou period. The narrator, Dong, had the bronze food vessel made to “express his filial piety,” evidence that the ideal of filial piety was firmly established by the tenth century BCE.\n\nThe importance of women in ancestor worship may have declined over time, but the moral principle of filial respect for mothers, so vividly reflected in this text, persisted throughout Chinese history. This inscription can also be read as an autobiographical account. Dong tells us not only the date, locations, opposing forces, and weapons of the battles he waged but also how he felt about fighting them. From the list of the war spoils, we learn something of the hostility between the Zhou kingdom and its neighboring states, the scale of the battles, the types of weapons involved, and the disposal of the dead and the captives. At the time, it was a common practice that the severed heads of those killed in battle were brought back to be presented to ancestors during worship ceremonies, during which many of the captives would also be sacrificed.\n\nDong Gui On the first day of the sixth month, the day of yiyou, at the Tang encampment, the Rong attacked [illegible]. I, Dong, led the supervisors and marshals to chase them a long distance. We stopped the Rong at Yulin and fought them off at Hu. My magnificent mother saw to everything, guiding my heart and protecting my body, enabling me to resolutely defeat the enemy. We returned with one hundred severed heads, two prisoners of war, and 135 of the enemy’s weapons and other equipment, including shields, spears, daggers, bows, quivers, arrows, garments, and helmets. We also brought back 114 Rong captives. All through the battle, my body was never harmed. I clap my hands and kowtow repeatedly in gratitude and praise my magnificent mother’s blessings and glory. I made this precious gui vessel for my magnificent mother, whose worship day is on the geng day. It will bless her son to live ten thousand years and to express his filial piety by presenting sacrificial offerings to the magnificent mother day and night. May my sons of sons and grandsons of grandsons use and cherish it.

BCE) These accidentally preserved case records include personal testimony written down by scribes, providing glimpses of ordinary people’s lives. From early times, even ordinary people were asked to tell their own stories or account for themselves in legal disputes. Victims, witnesses, and the accused would give oral testimony of what occurred. Bureaucratic practice necessitated making written records of their testimony, and in rare instances this has survived. Although one must often wonder to what extent coercion shaped the testimony, surviving examples do provide glimpses of how people unable to write presented themselves to others in words. The earliest surviving case records date to the Qin and Han periods. Although the Han dynasty turned away from the harshest features of Qin Legalism, it retained much of its legal system. Offenses punishable by law ranged from immorality to theft, bodily harm, and defiance of the civil authority. Punishments included exile, hard labor, flogging, castration, and death. The Han law code, like its Qin predecessor, allowed nobles, officials, and their family members to have their penalties reduced by giving up their\n\ntitles or property. Legal documents unearthed during the second half of the twentieth century show that both dynasties developed complex and sophisticated procedures to ensure full review of the sentencing process. In this selection, we present four legal cases that record personal testimony by those involved. The first three cases were included in a bamboo strip text discovered in a 217 BCE tomb in Shuihudi, Hubei, for a Qin administrator. The text, titled “Forms for Sealing and Investigating” (Fengzhen shi), consists of twenty-three cases to use as precedents for conducting investigations. These documents recorded personal narratives by the accusers, the accused, and the investigators, and they show that by Qin times, a son’s filial piety had become so imperative that he would be harshly punished if his father filed a formal complaint against him and that Qin women could file criminal reports on their own. The fourth document is from The Book of Submitted Doubtful Cases (Zouyan shu), a bamboo slip document discovered in 1983 in a Han official’s tomb in Zhangjiashan, Hubei. The book contains twenty-one legal cases dating between 246 and 196 BCE. “Officials Zhuang and Xi Submitting a Doubtful Case” (Hu Zhang Cheng Xi gan yan an) shows that by the early Han, elaborate legal procedures were established to uphold the institution of marriage.\n\nThree First-Person Accounts in Shuihudi Qin Bamboo Strips 1. Banishing a son Transcript: A, a commoner of X Village, said in his denunciation, “Request to have the foot of my own son, C, a commoner of the same village, amputated and to have him banished to a border county in Shu, with the injunction that he must not be allowed to leave the place of banishment. This is my statement.” I inform the head of Feiqiu [modern-day Xingping, Shanxi, first stop from Xianyang to Shu], “The commoner from Xianyang, living in X Village, named C, has been adjudicated because his father, A, requested to have his foot amputated and have him banished to a border county in Shu, with the injunction that to the end of his life he not be allowed to leave the place of banishment. We have banished C according to A’s denunciation. His family members are banished along with him, as the statute stipulated. Now we have amputated C’s foot. We ordered officers and conscripts to carry out the 24 Selection 2\n\ntransfer. They will carry travel permits and a case report and hand them over to the county clerk. Be sure to replace the clerks and the conscripts, and do so through successive prefectures up to Chengdu. In Chengdu, the case report is to be presented to the governor. He is to be fed according to the Statutes. Once the Feiqiu staff transfer him, a report is to be made.” This I report to the head.\n\n2. Denouncing a son Transcript: The commoner A of X Village said in his denunciation, “My, A’s, own son, the commoner C of the same village, is unfilial. I request to have him executed. This I report.” Forthwith the prefectural clerk E was ordered to go and arrest him. Transcript of prefectural clerk E’s report: “Together with the prison bond servant X, I seized C; we caught him in the house of X.” The assistant prefect X interrogated C; in his statement he said, “I am A’s biological son; I have been truly unfilial toward A at home. I am currently not being prosecuted for any other crime.”\n\n3. A Stillbirth Transcript: A, the wife of a commoner of X Village, made a denunciation, saying, “I, A, had been pregnant for six months. Yesterday, in the daytime, I fought with the adult woman C of the same village. C and I grabbed each other by the hair. C threw me on the ground. A fellow villager, the grandee of the first order D, came to the rescue and separated us. As soon as I had reached home, I felt ill and my belly hurt; by the evening, the child was stillborn. Now I have wrapped up the child, and I have come to bring it, to report it in person and to denounce C.” Forthwith an order was given to the prefectural clerk X to go and arrest C. Immediately I inspected the baby’s sex and whether it had grown hair, as well as the condition of the placenta. Furthermore, an order was given to a bondwoman who had several times given birth to inspect the blood coming out of her front part as well as the condition of her wounds. I also interrogated the members of A’s household about A’s situation when she had reached her house, as well as the circumstances of the pain in her belly and of the child’s coming forth. Transcript of the assistant prefect B’s report: Order was given to the prefectural clerk X and bond servant X to inspect the child that A had brought along. Before, it had been wrapped in a hemp cloth; it had the appearance of Crime and Punishment 25\n\ncongealed blood, as large as a hand; it was not recognizable as a child. When it had been placed in a basin with water and shaken, the clotted blood was recognizable as a child. Its head, body, arms, fingers, and from the thighs down to its feet and toes, all resembled those of a human being. Its eyes, ears, nose, and sex were not yet recognizable. When taken out of the water, it again had the appearance of clotted blood. Another report [on the examination of the wound] says: An order was given to the bondwomen XX, who had several times given birth, to inspect A. They said, “There is dried blood on the sides of her front part. At present blood is still coming out of her, but [only] a little; it is not menstruation.” One said, “When I once was pregnant and miscarried, I lost blood from my front part the same way as A did.” Source: Shuihudi Qinmu Zhujian Zhengli Xiaozu, Shuihudi Qinmu zhujian (Beijing: Wenwu Chubanshe, 1978), 155, 156, 161–2.

Hulsewé, Remnants of Ch’in Law (Leiden: Brill, 1985), 195, 196, 205.\n\nOfficials Zhuang and Xi Submitting a Doubtful Case In the tenth year of Emperor Gaozu [197 BCE], on the guisi day of the seventh month, whose first day fell on a xinmao day, Magistrate Zhuang and Assistant Magistrate Xi of Hu County [Henan] dare to submit this case for decision by higher authorities: The official accusation states, “Judiciary clerk Lan, from Linzi [Shandong], commanded the woman, Nan, to wear a man’s cap of undyed silk, feign illness, and lie inside an official carriage. He appropriated the travel permit of grandee of fifth-order Yu and brought her out of the Hangu Pass without authorization.” Now, Lan stated, “Nan is a member of the [former] Tian royal family of Qi. She had been ordered to reside in Chang’an. I had been assigned to accompany her on her journey and married her as a legal wife. We were to return to Linzi. We had not yet exited the pass when we were caught.” Everything else is as stated in the official accusation. Nan’s statement was similar to the official accusation and to Lan’s statement. Lan was cross-examined: “You were not allowed by law to marry Nan as your legal wife but did it anyway and together with her were returning to 26 Selection 2\n\nLinzi. This is a case of ‘coming to lure’ as well as ‘engaging in illicit intercourse.’ Nan is an absconding aristocrat, yet you ‘hid her.’ How do you explain this?” Lan stated, “I was traveling to the capital on assignment for Nan’s relocation, but then married her as my legal wife. It is not a case of ‘coming to lure.’ The officials consider this to be ‘engaging in illicit intercourse’ as well as ‘hiding Nan as an absconder.’ I am guilty of these charges; I have no excuse to give.” Lan was cross-examined: “One of the reasons the statutes prohibit people ‘coming from the kingdoms to lure’ is to prevent persons from one kingdom from marrying persons from another kingdom. Although you did not intentionally come to lure, in reality, you lured a person of Han to go to Qi; this, in fact, is ‘coming from the kingdom to lure.’ How do you explain this?” Lan stated, “I am guilty. I have no explanation to give.” An inquiry was conducted; it is in the statements. The case was tried; everything was carefully verified: that Lan had accompanied Nan for her relocation, married her as his legal wife, and together with her was returning to Linzi, and had not yet exited the pass, and was apprehended. There is no doubt as to what crime Lan is guilty of. He has been detained. We suspended the sentencing and dare to submit this case to higher authorities for decision. In another case, the private female slave named Qing assisted in the walling of Handan City in Zhao [Hebei]. Shortly after this work was done, she absconded and followed her older brother to the territory of Zhao, and that was judged as absconding and going to the kingdoms. Now Lan had arrived because he had been assigned to transport a relocated person; then he “lured” Nan. The commandery official deliberated: “The case of Lan and Qing belong to the same category. Lan’s case should be treated as a case of ‘coming from a kingdom to lure.’” Another opinion was that “Lan’s case should be treated as ‘engaging in illicit intercourse’ and ‘hiding a person guilty of a crime that matches undergoing tattooing and being made a grain-pounder.’” In the tenth year of Emperor Gaozu, on the guihai day of the eighth month, whose first day fell on a gengshen day, Gongshang Buhai, the minister of the imperial stables and acting chamberlain for law enforcement, informed the bailiff of Hu County, “Regarding the submitted doubtful case involving Crime and Punishment 27\n\njudiciary clerk Lan, the submitted doubtful case has been fully investigated and submitted to this court.” The decision: “Lan should be tattooed and made a wall-builder. The other individual should be sentenced according to the statutes and ordinances.” Source: Zhangjiashan 247 Hao Hanmu Zhujian Zhengli Xiaozu 張家山二四 七號漢墓竹簡整理小組, Zhangjiashan Hanmu zhuji (247 hao mu) 張家山漢墓竹 簡 (247 號墓) (Beijing: Wenwu Chubanshe, 2006), 93.

Emperor Wu had one of the longest reigns in Chinese history. He presided over a great expansion of Han territory, sending armies into Korea to the east, Vietnam to the south, and Central Asia (the Western Regions) to the west. Near the end of his reign, however, he had a change of heart. In 89 BCE, he issued the “Edict on Luntai,” rejecting his advisers’ suggestion to establish new agricultural colonies at Luntai in the Western Regions. In the edict, he took responsibility for recent military failures and blamed himself for the consequent suffering of the soldiers. This edict established a precedent for the ruler to take the blame when a policy failed or a natural calamity occurred, often as a way to deflect criticism. In the Han period alone, a total of eighty-two Rescripts for Accepting Blame are recorded. In many cases, an official probably drafted the edict, using conventional language, but the ruler had to consent to the wording. As Emperor Wu’s “Edict on Luntai” was the first of its kind, it is easier to imagine\n\nit as conveying Emperor Wu’s own feelings. Some see it as reflecting his turn toward Daoism in his late years.\n\nEdict on Luntai To shore up the funding for the frontiers, some officials proposed increasing the poll tax by thirty cash per person, which would have excessively burdened the old, weak, orphaned, and alone. Now they propose sending soldiers to set up an agricultural colony in Luntai [Xinjiang], which is located more than one thousand li west of Jushi [northwest of Turpan]. Previously, when Duke Kailing led the expedition to Jushi, the royal families of the six local kingdoms who lived in the Jushi capital quickly joined our side. They prepared livestock and food for the Han troops and raised armies of tens of thousands of troops. The princes served as generals and participated in the siege of Jushi, which led to the king of Jushi surrendering. After the armies of the six kingdoms were disbanded, they could no longer supply provisions for the Han army. When the Han army arrived at Jushi, there was still plenty of food, but the soldiers had not brought enough supplies for the subsequent military operation. As a result, the strong ones kept all the food and livestock for themselves while the weak ones died by the roadside by the thousands. I ordered Jiuquan [Gansu] to arrange a donkey and camel convoy to carry food supplies to meet the army at Yumen [Gansu] and to get officers and soldiers from Zhangye [Gansu] to handle the logistics. Even though the distance was not great, the soldiers became separated and many failed to reach their destination. At first, the facts were kept from me. The military official Hong’s memorial to the court stated that “the Xiongnu tied up a horse’s four legs and left it outside of the city gate, with a note saying, ‘This horse is a gift for the Chinese.’” In addition, the Xiongnu retained Han envoys and refused to let them return. Therefore, I sent General Li Guangli of Ershi [Osh, Kyrgyzstan] to attack the Xiongnu to secure the release of the Han envoys. In ancient times, when officials gave advice, they first had divinations performed and would not act if the results were not auspicious. At the time, I shared the letter on the tied-up horse with my top officials—the counselor-in-chief, imperial censors, all officials with a salary of two thousand piculs, all grand masters and scholars, even commandants of subordinate states and commanderies such as Cheng Zhong and Zhao Ponu. They said things like, “The barbarians tied\n\n30 Selection 3\n\nup their own horse, which is an extremely bad omen,” or “the Xiongnu want to look strong; they lack supplies but pretend to have plenty.” Divination based on The Book of Changes (Yijing) came back with the hexagram “Great Excess” as well as lines that indicated a flying dragon (imperial throne) and the Xiongnu’s defeat. Military astrologists observed the stars and meteorological phenomena, and grand diviners conducted yarrow stalk and turtle shell divinations. All agreed that the results were auspicious: the Xiongnu would definitely be defeated; the timing was perfect and should not be missed. They also predicted, “As long as it is a general-led northern expedition, the Xiongnu will be defeated at the Fu Mountains.” The divinations also pointed to General Li as the best choice for general. Therefore, I personally sent off General Li to the Fu Mountains, though I ordered him not to march too deep into the territory. With hindsight, we can see that the plans were wrong and divinations misinterpreted. The Xiongnu intelligence gatherer captured by Duke Chonghe reported, “Upon hearing that the Han military forces were coming, the Xiongnu leaders ordered shamans to bury sheep and cows by the roads and waterways where the Han armies would travel as a curse. Whenever the Chanyu [the Xiongnu ruler] gave the emperor a leather robe, he ordered the shamans to put a curse on it. The tied-up horse was intended as a curse against Han military action.” A divination result showed “inauspicious” for a Han military general. The Xiongnu often say, “The Han Empire is large, but the Han people are incapable of resisting hunger and thirst. If we lose one wolf, they will lose a thousand sheep.” Subsequently, General Li was defeated and many soldiers were killed and stranded. This has caused me no end of grief. The current request to set up agricultural colonies and military fortresses in Luntai would greatly burden the empire without bringing any benefit to the people, making it totally unacceptable. The chamberlain for dependencies and others also suggested recruiting prisoners to accompany the Xiongnu envoys back to Xiongnu territory. They also proposed that we promise the title of duke to anyone who successfully assassinates the Chanyu as our revenge for the Li Guangli fiasco. Such a scheme is so appalling that it would have been shunned even by the five hegemons in the Spring and Autumn period. Besides, when Han subjects surrender to the Xiongnu, the Xiongnu often frisk and interrogate them. Currently, the borders are disorganized and there are no restrictions on border crossing. Officers, clerks, and soldiers\n\nA Han Emperor Accepting the Blame 31\n\nwho guard the border hunt animals and sell animal skin and meat to support themselves [so might inadvertently stray into Xiongnu territory]. The soldiers are hard-pressed and can barely maintain the beacon fire system. Nevertheless, previous reports to the imperial court made no mention of their miserable conditions. I learned about them only after reports from captured or surrendered Xiongnu. We now should shore up our military defenses by prohibiting brutality, stopping unauthorized taxes, encouraging agriculture, and replenishing our supply of horses by offering tax incentives to those who raise them. Throughout the country, officials with pay above two thousand piculs should submit proposals for raising horses and increasing supplies at the border. They should send them to the court along with their routine reports.

CE) Three private letters that survive from the early imperial period reveal bits and pieces of the lives and concerns of ordinary people away from home. When people are separated for lengthy periods, they naturally crave news from home. And such separations were not rare occurrences. The vast size of the Qin and Han empires and the practice of universal conscription meant that many men spent long periods away from home. Women who married into families some distance from their own could also try to keep in touch by sending letters. This selection introduces accidentally preserved private letters from ordinary people to their relatives. Because the letters have not survived in perfect condition, there are often gaps in what can be deciphered today, but there is still much that can be learned from them. “Heifu and Jing’s Letter to Zhong and Mother,” written on wooden strips and discovered in a Qin dynasty tomb in Yunmeng, Hubei, is generally considered to be the earliest extant “letter home.” The second letter, “Zheng’s Letter to Youqing and Junming,” from the Han period, and the third letter, “Second Daughter’s\n\nLetter to Home,” from the ninth or tenth century, were written on silk and discovered among the documents found in a Dunhuang cave temple. Each can be read as a personal account, as they reveal close emotional bonds between the senders and their family members and their hometown friends and neighbors, as well as their experiences away from home. Brothers Heifu and Jing were part of the Qin conquest of the Chu state, yet their army provisions do not seem to have been sufficient, and the soldiers often ran out of money. Zheng, the author of the second letter, was frustrated by the fact that he had been stationed in the middle of nowhere for more than five years and had no hope for a transfer or promotion. Second Daughter, author of the third letter, was fascinated by the variety of silks she could find in the eastern capital. Taken together, these letters remind us that ordinary people may not have left behind poetry or travel diaries, but their letters allow us to piece together aspects of their lives.\n\n1. Heifu and Jing’s Letter to Zhong and Mother (ca. 223 BCE) On the xinsi day, the second month, Heifu and Jing send their warmest greetings to Brother Zhong and Mother. How are you? We are both fine here. Recently we were separated, but now we are together again. Heifu begged me to see that this letter is delivered: Send Heifu cash, not summer clothes. Once this letter arrives, Mother, look in Anlu [Yunmeng, Hubei] for cheap silk cloth that can be made into an unlined skirt and shirt, which you should make and have sent here together with the cash. If silk cloth is too expensive, just send the cash, and I will buy cloth here and tailor them myself. We are stationed in Huaiyang [Henan] to attack rebel cities. I am not sure if I will be sick or injured during this tour. I hope that Mother will send enough provisions for me. When the letter arrives, please, all of you, reply. In the reply, be sure to say whether Xiang Jiajue has come or not. If he has not, please tell me what’s going on. Have you heard whether Wang De is all right? Has Wang De bid farewell to Xiang Jiajue? When the letter and clothes arrive at the Southern Army . . . Give Aunt [father’s elder sister], Elder Sister Kangle [possibly married], Eldest Aunt Gushu, and her husband . . . our sincere regards. . . . How are they? Give Sister at the eastern wing our sincere regards. We hope she is all right. 34 Selection 4\n\nGive young Ying Fan our sincere regards. What has happened with that matter? Is it settled? Give the elders of Lü Ying’s family in Xiyang Lane and the elders of Yan Zheng’s family in Bing Lane our sincere regards. How are they? Yin and Zheng are all fine here, though they have run out of money and clothes. Jing gives his wife and daughter his sincere regards. How are you? My wife, do your best to look after our parents. Don’t give . . . Yuanbai [possibly Jing’s brother-in-law] does not know when he will be back. My wife, please do your best.

Zheng’s Letter to Youqing and Junming (Former Han Dynasty) Zheng prostrates himself, bows repeatedly, and states: Your Honors, Youqing and wife Junming, how are you? We have not seen each other for a long time. It is the hot season, and I prostrate myself to offer my sincere wish that Youqing and Junming clothe yourselves appropriately, eat enough food, and stay informed about the prefect’s affairs. I have been stationed in Chengle [Shanxi] for more than five years and have not been transferred or promoted. The place is in the middle of nowhere, and transportation is minimal. My official position is insignificant, and my status low, so I cannot write you often. I kowtow in respect. Since a young colleague of mine, Wang Zifang, is now promoted to become an assistant to Duke Yuze of Dunhuang, I respectfully beg you to look after him. . . . [Yang] Junqian did not participate in the defense or stay in the northern border region. Therefore, when he returned, he did not submit a report. I kowtow in respect. Governor Mr. Ren got sick in the middle of the first month of the year and unfortunately passed away. Governor. . . . I often receive your admonition [letters] and know that your sons are all fine, which makes me feel very fortunate. I hereby respectfully send my greeting to your honors, Youqing and Junming. Please convey my greetings to Brothers Zhangshi, Zizhong, and Shaoshi.

I long for you helplessly. The last month of summer is extremely hot . . . I wish you good health and every comfort, as if I am serving you at your side. Outside . . . How have you been since we parted? I hope you are adapting to the change of seasons. Take great care of yourself. This is my humble wish. Since leaving home, I, Er’niangzi, accompanied the imperial commissioner and minister of works of the Guiyi Circuit and arrived at the eastern capital, Luoyang, on the seventh day of the intercalary third month of this year. The trip went well. My stay here is also peaceful and pleasant; please do not worry from far away. Since the season is now at its most sweltering, I earnestly hope Mother and everyone else in the family rest well and eat regularly. Please do take it easy, and don’t worry about me, Er’niangzi, here. I am sending a piece of red brocade to Elder Sister as a gift; it is tuan brocade. The plain violet undergarment is also for Elder Sister. The half bolt of white damask silk is for Mother. I thought about sending other goods but worried that they might not reach you, so I do not dare to send them with this letter. Please forgive the paucity of my gifts. [Since I have been away for so long], I respectfully write this letter of greeting, though it is nowhere near sufficient. Daughter Er’niangzi writes, with respectful bows to Mother, on the twenty-first day of the sixth month. PS. As for my sister’s sons, Mosi and Huaizhu, I assume they are well and happy. I am sending two pieces of red Tuanchao brocade and a small mirror as gifts for them.

One of the earliest autobiographies in Chinese history was written by Wang Chong as the final chapter of his Balanced Discussions (Lunheng), best known for its analyses of natural phenomena. An original thinker, Wang Chong rejected key elements in the theory of correspondences between Heaven and mankind, popular among the Han intellectuals and favored by the Han court. He also denied the existence of ghosts and ridiculed commoners who believed in demons and other supernatural powers. Eager to debunk falsehoods, Wang wrote in an iconoclastic and combative style, earning him many enemies during his lifetime and a long list of detractors in later centuries. During the twentieth century, however, Western scholars saw in his skepticism harbingers of scientific thinking, and the Chinese Communist government celebrated him for his materialistic explanation of the origin of the cosmos, with its echoes of Marxist materialism. From his biography in History of the Later Han (Hou Han shu), we learn that\n\nWang Chong was born to a poor family in Shangyu (Zhejiang) and studied at the Imperial University in Luoyang under the renowned Confucian historian Ban Biao (3–53). During his time in Luoyang, we are told, Wang Chong read widely while standing at bookstalls. He was assigned a few official positions but did not rise high due to his combative attitude toward his superiors and aloofness toward his colleagues. We also learn that in his later years, Wang Chong became very interested in the Daoist theory of qi and ways of prolonging life, hoping to live long enough to complete his mission of spreading “impartial” assessment of the cosmos.\n\nAutobiography of Wang Chong I, Wang Chong, am a native of Shangyu in Guiji [Zhejiang]; my courtesy name is Zhongren. My ancestors (family named Wangsun) hailed from Yuancheng in Wei Commandery [Hebei]; some branches used the family name Sun. Men of early generations joined the military, and because of their accomplishments, the family was enfeoffed in Yangting in Guiji. However, just a year later, the fief was suddenly rescinded. Nevertheless, the family settled down there and engaged in farming and sericulture. My great-grandfather was bold and wayward and did not get along with the local people. During a famine, he assaulted and killed people like a ruffian, making many enemies. As the dynasty was in turmoil, my grandfather Wang Fan worried that my great-grandfather would be abducted by those he had wronged, so he led the entire household to seek safety in Guiji. They settled down in Qiantang County, where he took up trade. He had two sons, the older one Meng, the younger Song. Song is my father. My ancestors had always been an unruly bunch, but it got worse in Meng and Song’s generation. Both Meng and Song bullied people left and right. Eventually they feuded with local magnates like Ding Bo, so the family moved again to Shangyu. I was born in the third year of the Jianwu reign period [27 CE]. In playing with other children, I was not inclined toward mischief. My friends loved trapping birds, catching cicadas, gambling, and climbing trees; I was the only one unwilling to join in, much to my father’s amazement. My education began at the age of six. I was polite, honest, kind, obedient, and well mannered. Both serious and on the quiet side, I aspired to become a person of significance. My father never once flogged me, nor did my mother ever chastise me or my neighbors scold me. At the age of eight, I started school. There were more A Philosopher’s Account of His Life 39\n\nthan a hundred boys there, and all of them were at times punished for their misbehavior or thrashed for their bad handwriting. I was the only one who not only made daily progress in learning to write but also did not commit any major offenses. Once I had learned to write, I bid farewell to that teacher and began to study The Analects (Lunyu) and The Book of Documents (Shangshu), reading aloud a thousand words a day. Once I understood the classics and ethical principles, I left my classics teacher and began my private studies. Everyone was amazed at my writing ability. The books I read became increasingly wide-ranging. Despite my many talents, I did not get sloppy, and even though I could talk eloquently, I preferred not to get into arguments. If there was no one around I considered worth talking to, I would stay silent all day. When people heard me talk, they often found my ideas bizarre at first, but by the time I had finished, I had won them over. Such was the way I developed my writing and cultivated my character. I rose to be an administrator in the personnel department of a county, then held the same office under a chief commandant. Under a governor, I was one of the five chief administrators, with the added duty of overseeing affairs of the Personnel Department. At a prefecture, I was an aide. I was not interested in seeking fame, nor did I work for personal gain. I spoke often about people’s strengths and rarely of their weaknesses. I especially recommended those scholars who had not had a career break and reprimanded only those who made mistakes after being promoted. If I found something reprehensible, I would not praise it. Yet if a mistake was not corrected, I would not condemn the offender any further. I could forgive people’s grave mistakes and take pity on their minor errors. I aimed to be irreproachable but would never boast about it. Wanting to establish my reputation on the basis of my conduct, I was ashamed that I was recognized mainly for my talents. In company, I would not speak unless spoken to. When superiors received me, I would not respond unless I was addressed. As a commoner, I modeled myself after Ju Boyu’s [Spring and Autumn period] steadfastness in moral principles; at court, I tried to attain Shi You’s [courtesy name Ziyu, Spring and Autumn period] honesty. When attacked, I did not make excuses, nor did I harbor resentment when passed over for promotion. Although I was too poor to have much of a house, I was more content than dukes or kings. My official positions were among the lowest, but to me, they were cushy ones. I did not celebrate when I was assigned an office nor resent it when I lost one. When life was comfort40 Selection 5\n\nable, I did not indulge myself; nor did I give up hope when life was harsh. I found pleasure in ancient texts and loved to hear different opinions about them. Current books and popular theories tended to annoy me. Living alone, I thought hard about truth and reality. I am honorable and serious by nature and selective in making friends, and I do not associate with people carelessly. If a person’s conduct is admirable, even if his position is low or he is much younger than me, I definitely treat him as a friend. I love people with exceptional grace and have no interest in knowing people with poor taste. If mediocre people slander me behind my back for some insignificant mistake, I make no effort to explain myself, nor do I bear a grudge against them. Some might say, “You are so talented, and your writings are so excellent. Why don’t you defend yourself when you are falsely slandered? In the past, Yang Sheng’s [d. 148 BCE] slanders sent Zou Yang [d. 120 BCE] to jail. Without defending himself, Zou would not have been released. Even though you have done nothing wrong, still you should not allow people to defame you. Furthermore, given your ability to clear yourself, you should certainly not let yourself be wrongly accused.” My response would be that this is to be expected: dirt only shows in clear water; only at high places does one feel danger; only large spaces can be shrunk; empty buckets have nothing in them to be taken. It is only natural that capable gentlemen are slandered. People defend themselves because they want to move up; people justify themselves because they are afraid of being demoted. Since I have no such desires or concerns, I choose to keep quiet. Yang Sheng probably made false accusations because someone made him do it; Zou Yang was probably pardoned because someone intervened. Confucius spoke of submitting to destiny, and Mencius talked of Heaven. People cannot control what may befall them, good or bad. The ancients knew this, so they attributed their lot to destiny or the times they lived in. This gave them peace of mind, as they had nothing to worry about or rail against. When they met good fortune, they did not think it was due to their own effort, nor did they blame themselves when misfortune fell. They felt neither proud when by chance their careers advanced nor discouraged when career setbacks occurred. They did not use straitened circumstances as a reason to seek wealth nor seek security because they dreaded danger. They did not trade their knowledge for salaries, nor did they decline positions to boost their reputations. They did not obsess over advancing their careers just to show off, nor did they blame A Philosopher’s Account of His Life 41\n\nothers when demoted. To them, there was no big difference between safety and danger, life and death. They saw good fortune and adversity as equivalent, failure and success as similar. Therefore, even if they encountered ten Yang Shengs, they would say, “It does not matter.” Realizing this, I leave everything to Heaven and have no need to explain anything. I am a calm and mild-tempered person with no craving for wealth and power. If a higher-up recognizes me and promotes me ahead of others, I do not cling to my position. If a higher-up does not recognize me and demotes me unjustly, I do not let my low position bother me. None of the times when I was assigned as a county clerk did I ask for a transfer or decline the post. Someone might say, “Your mind is lofty, yet your actions are simple. You only befriend the like-minded and are not selective when it comes to assignments. Since this casts doubt on your integrity and conduct, how can you expect people to follow your model?” My response is that there is no better paragon of virtue than Confucius. Yet Confucius did not mind what official position he was offered. When he was a low-level clerk in charge of the staff at stables and granaries, he did not complain. Confucius was once the minister of works of the state of Lu, and during the peace treaty negotiations between Lu and Qi, he took on the role of a grand councillor, yet he did not appear overjoyed when making the arrangements. When the sage Shun was tilling the land in Lishan, he did not act as if this were temporary. When Yao abdicated and handed over responsibility to him, he acted as though it were nothing exceptional. We should worry about whether we are virtuous enough, not the respect we get. We should be ashamed if our names are blemished, not if our careers stagnate. Fine jade might be placed in a box of tiles, bright pearls in a bag of gravel; however, no one in the world would fail to distinguish these precious gems from the tiles or gravel. A person that the world recognizes for his goodness is esteemed no matter how low his place in society, just as someone occupying a high post can be held in"
