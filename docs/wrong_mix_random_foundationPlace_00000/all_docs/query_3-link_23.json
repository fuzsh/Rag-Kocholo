        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe Global Vascular Guidelines (GVG) recommend selecting an endovascular vs open-surgical approach to revascularization for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), based on the Global Limb Anatomic Staging System (GLASS) and Wound, Ischemia, and Foot Infection (WIfI) classification systems. We assessed the utility of GVG-recommended strategies in predicting clinical outcomes.We conducted a single-center, retrospective review of first-time lower-extremity revascularizations within a comprehensive limb-preservation program from 2010-2018. Procedures were stratified by 1) treatment concordance with GVG-recommended strategy (concordant vs non-concordant groups), 2) GLASS stages I-III, and 3) endovascular vs open strategies. The primary outcome was 5-year freedom from major adverse limb events (FF-MALE), defined as freedom from reintervention or major amputation, and secondary outcomes included 5-year overall survival, freedom from major amputation, freedom from reintervention, and immediate technical failure during initial revascularization. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis and multivariate analysis with Cox proportional hazard models were performed on the primary and secondary outcomes, RESULTS: Of 281 first-time revascularizations for CLTI, 251 (89.3%) were endovascular and 186 (66.2%) were in the concordant group, with a mean clinical follow-up of 3.02±2.40 years. Within the concordant group alone, 167 (89.8%) of revascularizations were endovascular. The concordant group had a higher rate of chronic kidney disease (60.8% vs 45.3%, P=.02), WIfI foot infection grade (0.81±1.1 vs 0.56±0.80, P=.03), and WIfI stage (3.1±0.79 vs 2.8±1.2, P<.01) compared to the non-concordant group. After both KM and multivariate analyses, there were no significant differences in 5-year FF-MALE or overall survival between concordant and non-concordant groups. There was higher freedom from major amputation in the non-concordant group on KM analysis (83.9% vs 74.2%, P=.025), though this difference was non-significant on multivariate analysis (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.21-1.15, P=.10). The open group had lower MALE compared to the endovascular group (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17-0.91, P=.029) attributed to a lower reintervention rate in the open group (HR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11-0.87, P=.026). GLASS stage was not associated with significant differences in outcomes, but the severity of GLASS stage was associated with immediate technical failure (2.1% in stage 1, 6.4% in stage 2, and 11.7% in stage 3, P=.01).In this study, CLTI treatment outcomes did not differ significantly based on whether treatment was received in concordance with GVG-recommended strategy. There was no difference in overall survival between the endovascular and open groups, though there was a higher reintervention rate in the endovascular group. The GVG guidelines are an important resource to help guide the management of CLTI patients. However, in this study, both concordance with GVG guidelines and GLASS staging were found to be indeterminate in differentiating outcomes between complex CLTI patients treated primarily with an endovascular-first approach. The revascularization approach for a CLTI patient is a nuanced decision that must take into account patient anatomy and clinical status, as well as physician skill and experience and institutional resources.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.avsg.2023.02.001\n\nView details for PubMedID 36828135\n\nAbstract\n\nSince 2005, the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) ultrasound screening for 65- to 75-year-old male ever-smokers. Integrated health systems such as Kaiser Permanente and the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system report 74-79% adherence, but compliance rates in the private sector are unknown.The IBM Marketscan® Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases (2006 -2017) were queried for male ever-smokers continuously enrolled from age 65 to 75. Exclusion criteria were previous history of abdominal aortic aneurysm, connective tissue disorder, and aortic surgery. Patients with abdominal computed tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging from ages 65 to 75 were also excluded. Screening was defined as a complete abdominal, retroperitoneal, or aortic ultrasound. A logistic mixed-effects model utilizing state as a random intercept was used to identify patient characteristics associated with screening.Of 35,154 eligible patients, 13,612 (38.7%, Table 1) underwent screening. Compliance varied by state, ranging from 24.4% in Minnesota to 51.6% in Montana (p <0.05, Figure 1). Screening activity increased yearly, with 0.7% of screening activity occurring in 2008 versus 22.2% in 2016 (p <0.05, Figure 2). In a logistic mixed-effects model adjusting for state as a random intercept, history of hypertension (OR 1.07, 95% CI [1.03 - 1.13]), coronary artery disease (OR 1.17, 95% CI [1.10, 1.22]), congestive heart failure (OR 1.14, 95% CI [1.01 - 1.22]), diabetes (OR 1.1, 95% CI [1.06 - 1.16]) and chronic kidney disease (OR 1.4 95% CI [1.24 - 1.53]) were associated with screening. Living outside of a census-designated metropolitan area was negatively associated with screening (OR 0.92, 95% CI [0.87 - 0.97], Table 2).In a private claims database representing 250 million claimants, 38.7% of eligible patients received UPSTF-recommended AAA screening. Compliance was nearly half that of integrated health systems and was significantly lower for patients living outside of metropolitan areas. Efforts to improve early detection of AAA should include targeting non-metropolitan areas and modifying Medicare reimbursement and incentivization strategies to improve guideline adherence.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2023.01.202\n\nView details for PubMedID 36781115\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study was an unplanned exploratory analysis of a subset of participants from the Telmisartan in the Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (TEDY) trial, and aimed to assess the efficacy of the angiotensin 1 receptor blocker telmisartan in reducing abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) peak wall stress (PWS) and peak wall rupture index (PWRI) among individuals with small AAAs.Participants with AAAs measuring 35 to 49mm in maximum diameter were randomised to receive telmisartan 40mg or identical placebo in the TEDY trial. Participants who had computed tomography angiography performed at entry and at least one other time point during the trial (12 or 24 months) were included in the current study. Orthogonal AAA diameter, PWS and PWRI were measured using previously validated methods. The annual change in PWS and PWRI from baseline was compared between participants' allocated telmisartan and placebo using linear mixed effects models. These models were either unadjusted or adjusted for risk factors different in the groups at entry (p<0.100) or systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 1 year.One hundred and twenty four of the 207 participants recruited to TEDY were eligible for inclusion. The present study included 65 and 59 participants from the telmisartan and placebo group respectively. PWS and PWRI were not significantly different in the two groups at baseline. Participants allocated telmisartan had a slower annual increase in PWS (-4.19 (95% Confidence intervals, CI -8.24, -0.14 kPa/year, p=0.043) and PWRI (-0.014 (95% CI -0.026, -0.001, p=0.032) compared to those allocated placebo after adjusting for risk factors. After adjustment for SBP at 1 year, telmisartan did not significantly reduce annual increase in PWS or PWRI.The findings of this study suggest that telmisartan limits the rate of increase in PWS and PWRI of small AAAs by reducing blood pressure.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ejvs.2022.07.042\n\nView details for PubMedID 35944871\n\nAbstract\n\nThe need for multidisciplinary care of patients with advanced limb threat is well established. We examined patient reported outcomes and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) for those who completed a multidisciplinary extremity preservation program (EPP) at our institution.Patients with advanced limb threat, who had previously failed standard management at a tertiary-care center, were referred to EPP for evaluation by a multidisciplinary panel of vascular, plastic, orthopedic and podiatric surgeons, along with infectious disease, prosthetics, orthotics, imaging, palliative care, social work and wound nursing specialists. HR-QoL was quantified before and after EPP participation with the RAND-36 questionnaire. The validated RAND-36 assesses physical function, role limitations caused by physical and emotional health problems, social functioning, emotional well-being, energy, pain and general health perceptions.From 2018 to 2020, 185 patients were referred to EPP. After review by the multidisciplinary panel, 120 were accepted into the program, 63 of whom completed their course of care; 9 were one-time consultations. The median number of EPP in-person care visits was 23 (13-54) per participant; 87.3% of patients received one or more surgical procedure, including operative debridement (73%), revascularization (44%), soft tissue reconstruction or transplantation (46%), as well as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (11%) during their course of treatment. 85.7% of patients achieved complete wound healing, 41.5% occurring within 6 months. Ultimately, 14.3% required a major amputation. Graduates noted improvement in all categories of the HR-QoL upon completion, including those undergoing major amputation. On adjusted multivariate regression analysis, patients with immunocompromised status were more likely to show greater improvement in their social function (OR: 10.1; P<0.044) and emotional role limitation (OR:8.1; P=0.042), while patients with larger wound volume at presentation were more likely to have greater improvement in their general health (OR: 1.1; P<0.049). Conversely, patients with a smoking history had less improvement in energy level (OR:0.4; P=0.044) and patients with dialysis-dependence had less improvement in social function (OR:0.2; P=0.034).Coordinated, multidisciplinary extremity preservation program improves HR-QoL of patients with complex limb threat, including those who are immunocompromised with impaired social function and emotional role limitations. Further study is warranted to better characterize the generalizability of this approach, including considerations of cost-effectiveness, wound recidivism, and limiting the number of in-person visits required to achieve complete healing.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.avsg.2022.05.047\n\nView details for PubMedID 35803456\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVES: Fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (FEVAR) is increasingly used in the treatment of juxtarenal aortic aneurysms and short-neck infrarenal aneurysms. Reinterventions (REIs) occur frequently, contributing to patient morbidity and resource utilization. We sought to determine if REIs impact long-term survival after FEVAR.METHODS: A single-institution retrospective review of all Cook ZFEN repairs was performed. Patients with ≥6 months follow-up and without adjunctive branch modifications were included. REI was defined as any aneurysm, device, target branch, or access-related intervention after the index procedure. REIs were categorized by early (<30 days) or late (≥30 days), indication (branch, endoleak, limb, access-related, or other), and target branch/device component. Patients were stratified into REI vs No REI and Branch REI vs Non-Branch REI.RESULTS: Of 219 consecutive ZFEN from 2012-2021, 158 patients met inclusion criteria. Forty-one (26%) patients underwent a total of 51 REIs (10 early, 41 late) over a mean follow-up of 33.9 months. The most common indication for REI was branch-related 61% (31/51), with the renal arteries most frequently affected 51% (26/51). The only differences found in baseline, aneurysm, or device characteristics were a higher mean SVS comorbidity score (9.6 vs 7.9, P=.04) and larger suprarenal neck angle (23.3 vs 17.1 degrees, P=.04) in No REI, while REI had larger mean proximal seal zone diameter (26.3 vs 25.1 mm, P=.03) and device diameter (31.9 vs 30.0 mm, P=.002) than No REI. Technical success and operative characteristics were similar between groups, except for longer mean fluoroscopy time (74.9 vs 60.8 min, P=.01) and longer median length of stay (2 vs 2 days, P=.006) in REI. While the rate of early major adverse events (<30 days) was higher in REI (24.4% vs 6.0%, P=.001), 30-day mortality was not statistically different (4.9% vs 0.9%, P=.10). On Kaplan-Meier analysis, freedom from REI at 1- and 5-years was 85.7% and 62.6%, respectively, in the overall cohort. There was no difference in estimated 5-year survival between REI and No REI (62.8% vs 63.5%, log-rank P=.87) and Branch REI and Non-Branch REI (71.8% vs 49.9%, log-rank P=.16). In multivariate analysis, REI did not predict mortality; age, the SVS comorbidity score, and preoperative maximum aneurysm diameter each increased the hazard of death (HR 1.07 95% CI 1.02-1.12, P=.007; HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.18, P=.02; HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.08, P=.003 respectively).CONCLUSIONS: Following ZFEN, 26% of patients required a total of 51 REIs with most occurring ≥30 days and 61% being branch-related, with no influence on 5-year survival. Age, comorbidity, and baseline aneurysm diameter independently predicted mortality. FEVAR mandates lifelong surveillance and protocols to maintain branch patency. Despite their relative frequency, REIs do not influence 5-year post-procedural survival.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2022.04.050\n\nView details for PubMedID 35709854\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: While Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines recommend computed tomography angiography (CTA) or ultrasound for surveillance following infrarenal endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), there is a lack of consensus regarding optimal timing and modalities. We hypothesized that ultrasound-based approaches would be more cost-effective and developed a cost-effectiveness analysis to estimate the lifetime costs and outcomes of various strategies.METHODS: We developed a decision tree with nested Markov models to compare five surveillance strategies: yearly CTA, yearly CDU, yearly CEU, CTA at first year followed by CDU, and CTA at first year followed by CEU. The model accounted for differential sensitivity, specificity, and risk of acute kidney injury after CTA, and was implemented on a monthly cycle with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and 3% annual discounting.RESULTS: Under base case assumptions, the CTA-CDU strategy was cost effective with a lifetime cost of $77950 for 7.74 QALYs. In sensitivity analysis, the CTA-CDU approach remained cost-effective when CEU specificity was less than 95%, and risk of acute kidney injury following CTA was less than 20%. At diagnostic sensitivities below 75% for CEU and 55% for CDU, a yearly CTA strategy maximized QALYs.CONCLUSION: A hybrid strategy in which CTA is performed in the first year and CDU is performed annually thereafter is the most cost-effective strategy for infrarenal EVAR surveillance in patients with less than a 20% risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. If the sensitivity of CEU and CDU are at the lower end of plausible estimates, a yearly CTA strategy is reasonable. Further research should aim to identify patients who may benefit from alternative surveillance strategies.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2022.02.057\n\nView details for PubMedID 35278655\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: The role of atherosclerosis in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) pathogenesis is controversial. The aim of this study was to compare AAA growth in patients who did and did not have concurrent athero-occlusive disease (AOD).METHODS: Patients with an AAA measuring 35 - 49 mm in maximum diameter were recruited as part of the TElmisartan in the management of abdominal aortic aneurysm (TEDY) trial. TEDY participants who had infrarenal aortic volume and orthogonal diameter assessed by computed tomography at entry and at least one other time point during the trial (12 and/or 24 months) were included. AOD was defined by prior diagnoses of coronary heart disease, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease or an ankle brachial pressure index < 0.90. The increase in AAA volume and diameter from entry for participants who did and did not have AOD was assessed using linear mixed effects models; 131 of the 210 participants recruited to TEDY were included.RESULTS: In an unadjusted analysis, the mean (95% confidence interval) annual increases in AAA volume and diameter for participants with AOD were 3.26 (0.82 - 5.70) cm3 and 0.70 (0.19 - 1.22) mm slower than those without AOD, p= .008 and .007 respectively. The association between AOD and significantly slower AAA growth was maintained after adjusting for risk factors and medications, significantly unequally distributed between participants with and without an AOD diagnosis.CONCLUSION: In an exploratory analysis of a selective cohort from the TEDY trial, AOD was associated with slower AAA growth. Validation of these findings in other cohorts is needed.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ejvs.2021.12.038\n\nView details for PubMedID 35277322\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: The durability of fenestrated endovascular aneurysm repair (fEVAR) has been threatened by thrombotic complications. In the present study, we used patient-specific computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation to investigate the effect of the endograft diameter on hemodynamics after fEVAR and explore the hypothesis that diameter-dependent alterations in aortic hemodynamics can predict for thrombotic events.Methods: A single-institutional retrospective study was performed of patients who had undergone fEVAR for juxtarenal aortic aneurysms. The patients were stratified into large diameter (34-36mm) and small diameter (24-26mm) endograft groups. Patient-specific CFD simulations were performed using three-dimensional paravisceral aortic models created from computed tomographic images with allometrically scaled boundary conditions. Aortic time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) and residence time (RT) were computed and correlated with future thrombotic complications (eg, renal stent occlusion, development of significant intraluminal graft thrombus).Results: A total of 36 patients (14 with a small endograft and 22 with a large endograft) were included in the present study. The patients treated with large endografts had experienced a higher incidence of thrombotic complications compared with small endografts (45.5% vs 7.1%; P= .016). Large endografts were associated with a lower postoperative aortic TAWSS (1.45± 0.76dynes/cm2 vs 3.16± 1.24dynes/cm2; P< .001) and longer aortic RT (0.78± 0.30second vs 0.34± 0.08second; P< .001). In the large endograft group, a reduction >0.39dynes/cm2 in aortic TAWSS demonstrated discriminatory power for thrombotic complications (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.77). An increased aortic RT of ≥0.05second had similar accuracy for predicting thrombotic complications (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.78). The odds of thrombotic complications were significantly higher if patients had met the hemodynamic threshold changes in aortic TAWSS (odds ratio, 7.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-45.9) and RT (odds ratio, 8.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-56.8).Conclusions: Patient-specific CFD simulation of fEVAR in juxtarenal aortic aneurysms demonstrated significant endograft diameter-dependent differences in aortic hemodynamics. A postoperative reduction in TAWSS and an increased RT correlated with future thrombotic events after large-diameter endograft implantation. Patient-specific simulation of hemodynamics provides a novel method for thrombotic risk stratification after fEVAR.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jvssci.2022.04.002\n\nView details for PubMedID 35647564\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Practice patterns and durability of parallel stent graft techniques in complex endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) remain poorly defined. We aimed to quantify and compare the impact of renal chimney intra-aortic stent length (IASL) on geometric deformations of renal arteries in complex EVAR.METHODS: Thirty-eight nonconsecutive patients underwent EVAR utilizing parallel stent graft techniques (chimney EVAR [chEVAR], n = 28; chimney endovascular aneurysm sealing [chEVAS], n = 10) between 2010 and 2016. A total of 59 renal chimney stent grafts were used. Geometric quantification was derived from three-dimensional model-based centerline extraction. Renal chimney intra-aortic stent length (IASL) was defined as the length of chimney stent that extended from the proximal edge of the chimney stent to the ostium of the corresponding renal artery.RESULTS: Mean IASL for both left and right renal arteries in the cohort was 35.7mm. Renal arteries containing chimney IASL <30mm trended toward a greater branch angle (135.4 vs. 127.8°, p = .06). Left renal arteries showed significantly greater branch angle among those with IASL <40mm (135.5 vs. 121.7°, p = .045). Mean IASL for renal arteries in chEVAR was significantly longer compared to chEVAS (39.2 vs. 26.3mm, p = .003). No difference was noted in overall branch angle or end-stent angle based on procedure type. ChEVAR with IASL <30mm had significantly greater end-stent angle (48.2 vs. 33.5°, p = .03). In contrast, chEVAS patients showed no difference in end-stent angle based on IASL thresholds, but did have significantly greater branch angle among those with IASL <30mm when grouped by both all renal arteries (133.5 vs. 113.5°, p = .004) and right renal arteries (134.3 vs. 111.6°, p = .02).CONCLUSIONS: Renal chimney stents with longer IASL appear to exhibit less renal artery deformation, suggesting a more gradual and perpendicular transition of the chimney stent across the renal ostium.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/17085381211059978\n\nView details for PubMedID 34963378\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a common progressive disease and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Prior investigations have shown that diabetes mellitus (DM) may be relatively protective of AAA incidence and growth. The Non-invasive Treatment of Aortic Aneurysm Clinical Trial (N-TA3CT) is a contemporary study of small AAA growth which provides a unique opportunity to validate and explore the effect of DM on AAA. Confirming the effect of DM on AAA growth in this study may present opportunities to explore for clues to potential biologic mechanisms as well as inform current patient management.METHODS: This is a secondary analysis examining the association of diabetes and aneurysm growth within N-TA3CT: a placebo-controlled multicenter trial of doxycycline in 261 patients with AAA maximum transverse diameters (MTD) between 3.5cm and 5cm. The primary outcome is the change in the MTD from baseline as determined by CT scans obtained during the trial. Secondary outcome is the growth pattern of the AAA. Baseline characteristics and growth patterns were assessed with t-tests (continuous) or chi-square tests (categorical). Unadjusted and adjusted longitudinal analyses were performed with a repeated measures linear mixed model to compare AAA growth rates between diabetic patients and non-diabetic patients.RESULTS: Of 261 patients, 250 subjects had sufficient imaging and were included in this study. There were 56 (22.4%) with diabetes and 194 (77.6%) without. Diabetes was associated with higher BMI and increased rates of hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease (p< 0.05). Diabetes was also associated with increased frequency of treatment for atherosclerosis and hypertension including treatment with statin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, ARB, anti-platelet, and diuretic therapy (p< 0.05). Baseline MTD was not significantly different between those with (4.32 cm) and without diabetes (4.30 cm). Median growth rate for diabetic patients was 0.12 cm/year (IQR 0.07-0.22) and 0.19 cm/year (IQR 0.12-0.27) in patients without diabetes, which was significantly different on unadjusted analysis (p<0.0001). Diabetes remained significantly associated with AAA growth after adjustment for other relevant clinical factors (coef -0.057; p<0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with diabetes have more than a 35% reduction in the median growth rates of AAA despite more severe concomitant vascular co-morbidities and similar initial sizes of aneurysms. This effect persists and remains robust after adjusted analysis; and slower growth rates may delay the time to reach repair threshold. Rapid growth (>0.5 cm/year) is infrequent in diabetic patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2021.10.019\n\nView details for PubMedID 34695550\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies link hyperlipidemia with increased risk for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). However, the influence of lipid-lowering drugs statins on prevalence and progression of clinical and experimental AAAs varies between reports, engendering controversy on the association of hyperlipidemia with AAA disease. This study investigated the impact of hypercholesterolemia on elastase-induced experimental AAAs in mice.METHODS: Both spontaneous (targeted deletion of apolipoprotein E) and induced mouse hypercholesterolemia models were employed. In male wild type (WT) C57BL/6J mice, hypercholesterolemia was induced via intraperitoneal injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding a gain-of-function proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 mutation (PCSK9) followed by the administration of a high-fat diet (HFD) (PCSK9+HFD) for two weeks. As normocholesterolemic controls for PCSK9+HFD mice, WT mice were infected with PCSK9 AAV and fed normal chow, or injected with phosphate-buffered saline alone and fed HFD chow. AAAs were induced in all mice by intra-aortic infusion of porcine pancreatic elastase and assessed by ultrasonography and histopathology.RESULTS: In spontaneous hyper- and normo-cholesterolemic male mice, the aortic diameter enlarged at a constant rate from day 3 through day 14 following elastase infusion. AAAs, defined as a more than 50% diameter increase over baseline measurements, formed in all mice. AAA progression was more pronounced in male mice, with or without spontaneous hyperlipidemia. The extent of elastin degradation and smooth muscle cell depletion were similar in spontaneous hyper- (score 3.5 for elastin and 4.0 for smooth muscle) and normo- (both scores 4.0) cholesterolemic male mice. Aortic mural macrophage accumulation was also equivalent between the two groups. No differences were observed in aortic accumulation of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, B cells, or mural angiogenesis between male spontaneous hyper- and normocholesterolemic mice. Similarly, no influence of spontaneous hypercholesterolemia on characteristic aneurysmal histopathology was noted in female mice. In confirmatory experiments, induced hypercholesterolemia also exerted no appreciable effect on AAA progression and histopathologies.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated no recognizable impact of hypercholesterolemia on elastase-induced experimental AAA progression in both spontaneous and induced hypercholesterolemia mouse models. These results add further uncertainty to the controversy surrounding the efficacy of statin therapy in clinical AAA disease.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/biom11101434\n\nView details for PubMedID 34680067\n\nAbstract\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent of the current, world-wide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the SARS-CoV-2 host entry receptor for cellular inoculation and target organ injury. We reviewed ACE2 expression and the role of ACE2 - angiotensin 1-7- Mas receptor axis activity in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) pathogenesis to identify potential COVID-19 influences on AAA disease pathogenesis.A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, National Library of Medicine, USA. Key words included COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, AAA, ACE2, ACE or angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor inhibitor, angiotensin 1-7, Mas receptor, age, gender, respiratory diseases, diabetes, autoimmune diseases. Key publications on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of COVID-19 and AAAs were identified and reviewed.All vascular structural cells, including endothelial and smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and pericytes express ACE2. Cigarette smoking, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lupus, certain types of malignancies and viral infection promote ACE2 expression and activity, with the magnitude of response varying by sex and age. Genetic deficiency of AT1 receptor, or pharmacological ACE or AT1 inhibition also increases ACE2 and its catalytic product angiotensin 1-7. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of ACE2 or Mas receptor augments, whereas ACE2 activation or angiotensin 1-7 treatment attenuates, progression of experimental AAAs. Potential influences of SARS-CoV-2 on AAA pathogenesis include augmented ACE-angiotensin II-AT1 receptor activity resulting from reduced reciprocal ACE2-angiotensin 1-7-Mas activation; increased production of proaneurysmal mediators stimulated by viral spike proteins in ACE2-negative myeloid cells or by ACE2-expressing vascular structural cells; augmented local or systemic cross-talk between viral targeted non-vascular, non-leukocytic ACE2-expressing cells via ligand recognition of their cognate leukocyte receptors; and hypoxemia and increased systemic inflammatory tone experienced during severe COVID-19 illness.COVID-19 may theoretically influence AAA disease through multiple SARS-CoV-2-induced mechanisms. Further investigation and clinical follow-up will be necessary to determine whether and to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic will influence the prevalence, progression and lethality of AAA disease in the coming decade.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2021.01.051\n\nView details for PubMedID 33600934\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: Currently there is no drug therapy for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).Objective: To test the efficacy of the angiotensin receptor blocker telmisartan in slowing AAA growth in the Telmisartan in the Management of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (TEDY) trial.Design, Setting, and Participants: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial recruited participants between September 6, 2011, and October 5, 2016, to evaluate the efficacy of telmisartan treatment in patients with AAA. Participants with 35- to 49-mm AAAs recruited from Australia, the Netherlands, and the US were randomized 1:1 to receive telmisartan, 40 mg, or identical placebo. Analyses were conducted according to intention-to-treat principles. Final follow-up was conducted on October 11, 2018, and data analysis was performed between June and November 2019.Intervention: Telmisartan, 40 mg, or identical placebo.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome of the difference in AAA growth, assessed on core imaging laboratory-read ultrasonographic scanning, was tested with linear mixed-effects models. Other outcomes included effects on blood pressure, computed tomographic (CT)-measured AAA diameter and volume, time to AAA-related events (AAA repair or mortality due to AAA rupture), and health-related quality of life.Results: Of 300 intended participants, 210 were enrolled and randomized to receive telmisartan (n=107) or placebo (n=103). Of patients included in the intention-to-treat analysis (telmisartan: n=106, placebo: n=101), 183 were men (88%); mean (SD) age was 73.5 (7.9) years. At 1 year, participants receiving telmisartan had mean lower systolic (8.9; 95% CI, 4.1-13.8 mm Hg; P<.001) and diastolic (7.0; 4.3-9.8 mm Hg; P<.001) blood pressure levels compared with participants receiving placebo. A total of 188 participants (91%) received at least 2 ultrasonographic scans and 133 participants (64%) had at least 2 CT scans. There was no significant difference in ultrasonographic-assessed AAA growth rates among those assigned telmisartan (1.68 mm/y) or placebo (1.78 mm/y): mean difference, -0.11 mm/y (95% CI, -0.60 to 0.38 mm/y; P=.66). Telmisartan had no significant effects on AAA growth assessed by CT-measured AAA diameter (mean difference, -0.01 mm/y; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.01 mm/y; P=.23) or volume (mean difference, -0.02 cm3/y; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.00 cm3/y; P=.11), AAA-related events (relative risk, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.54-3.35; P=.52), or health-related quality of life (mean difference in physical component score at 24 months, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.4-0.4; P=.80). Hypotensive symptoms (eg, syncope) were twice as common among participants receiving telmisartan compared with placebo (28 [26%] vs 13 [13%]; P=.02), but overall adverse event rates were otherwise similar for both groups.Conclusions and Relevance: This underpowered study did not show a treatment effect for telmisartan on small AAA growth. Future trials will need to ensure adequate sample size and duration of follow-up.Trial Registrations: anzctr.org.au Identifier: ACTRN12611000931976; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01683084.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamacardio.2020.3524\n\nView details for PubMedID 32845283\n\nAbstract\n\nEarly and short-term efficacy of the snorkel/chimney technique (ch-EVAR) have been previously reported. However, long-term ch-EVAR performance, vessel patency, and patient survival remain unknown. Our study aimed to evaluate the late outcomes and to identify possible predictors for failure within the PERICLES registry.Clinical and radiographic data from patients receiving ch-EVAR between 2008-2014 in the PERICLES registry were updated with extension of the follow-up. Regression models were used to evaluate relevant anatomic and operative characteristics as factors influencing late results focusing on patients with at least 30 months of follow-up (mean 46.6 months; range 30-120 months).517 patients from the initial PERICLES registry were included in this analysis, from which mean follow-up was updated from previously 17.1 to 28.2 months (range, 1-120 months). All-cause mortality at latest follow-up was 25.5% (n=132), with an estimated patient survival of 87.6%, 74.4% and 66.1% at one, three and five years, respectively. A sub-group of 244 patients with 387 chimney grafts placed (335 renal, 42 SMAs, 10 celiac arteries) and follow-up of at least 30 months was used to analyze specific anatomic and device predictors of adverse events. In the sub-group, the technical success was 88.9%, while primary patency was 94%, 92.8%, 92%, and 90.5% at 2.5 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years respectively. Mean aneurysm sack regression was 7.8±11.4 mm,p<.0001. Chimney graft occlusion occurred in 24 target vessels(6.2%). Late open conversion was required in 5 patients for endograft infection(n=2), persistent T1a endoleak (n=2) and endotension (n=1), The absence of infrarenal neck (OR 2.86 [1.32-6.19], p=.007) was significantly associated with long-term device-related complications. Sealing zone diameter > 30mm was significantly associated with persistent/late type Ia endoleak (T1a EL)(OR 4.86 [1.42-16.59], p=.012).The present analysis of the PERICLES registry provides the missing long-term experience on the ch-EVAR technique showing favorable results with more than half of the patients surviving for more than 5 years and chimney graft branch vessels patency of 92%. The absence of infrarenal neck and treatment with sealing zone diameter >30mm were the main anatomical long-term limits of the technique demanding adequate preoperative planning and indication.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2020.10.086\n\nView details for PubMedID 33259893\n\nAbstract\n\nCurrently, no medical therapy is effective in limiting progression of small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA; ≤ 5.5 cm). Previously, we have demonstrated safety and efficacy of exercise training in patients with AAA. However, the impact of exercise training on vascular markers of AAA progression, such as lipid accumulation product (lipid accumulation product) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9, linked to destruction of aortic matrix) is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of exercise training on AAA diameter, lipid accumulation product, MMP-9 and other risk markers of vascular disease.In this randomized trial, complete data of 99 patients (male: n=87, female: n=9; exercise training (exercise) n=42, usual care n=54) were studied. Changes in AAA diameter, exercise capacity, lipid accumulation product (men = (waist circumference -65) × fasting triglycerides; women = (waist circumference-58) × triglycerides) and MMP-9 were performed.The exercise group demonstrated a significant increase in maximal exercise time and estimated METs. lipid accumulation product decreased in exercise and increased in usual care (p<0.001 between groups); MMP-9 remained statistically unchanged in exercise, but increased significantly in usual care (p = 0.005; between groups p = 0.094). In both groups, there was a significant increase in transverse diameter, but no difference between groups; neither group assignment nor level of fitness correlated with AAA enlargement. No adverse clinical events occurred.This is the first study to demonstrate that in AAA exercise beneficially modifies lipid accumulation product and MMP-9, both markers of vascular disease, without inducing aneurysmal growth beyond what is otherwise observed during usual care.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.amjmed.2020.07.029\n\nView details for PubMedID 32835687\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has become the standard of care for infrarenal aneurysms. Endografts are commercially available in proximal diameters up to 36mm, allowing proximal seal in necks up to 32mm. We sought to further investigate clinical outcomes after standard EVAR in patients requiring large main body devices.METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database for all patients undergoing elective EVAR for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms at a single institution from 2000 to 2016. Only endografts with the option of a 34- to 36-mm proximal diameter were included. Requisite patient demographics, anatomic and device-related variables, and relevant clinical outcomes and imaging were reviewed. The primary outcome in this study was proximal fixation failure, which was a composite of type IA endoleak and stent graft migration >10mm after EVAR. Outcomes were stratified by device diameter for the large-diameter device cohort (34-36mm) and the normal-diameter device cohort (<34mm).RESULTS: There were 500 patients treated with EVAR who met the inclusion criteria. A total of 108 (21.6%) patients received large-diameter devices. There was no difference between the large-diameter cohort and the normal-diameter cohort in terms of 30-day (0.9% vs 0.95%; P= .960) or 1-year mortality (9.0% vs 6.2%; P= .920). Proximal fixation failure occurred in 24 of 392 (6.1%) patients in the normal-diameter cohort and 26 of 108 (24%) patients in the large-diameter cohort (P<.001). There were 13 (3.3%) type IA endoleaks in the normal-diameter cohort and 16 (14.8%) in the large-diameter cohort (P< .001). Stent graft migration (>10mm) occurred in 15 (3.8%) in the normal-diameter cohort and 16 (14.8%) in the large-diameter cohort (P< .001). After multivariate analysis, only the use of Talent (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minn) endografts (odds ratio [OR], 4.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-17.21) and neck diameter ≥29mm (OR, 2.50; 95% CI, 1.12-5.08) remained significant independent risk factors for development of proximal fixation failure (OR, 3.99; 95% CI, 1.75-9.11).CONCLUSIONS: Standard EVAR in patients with large infrarenal necks ≥29mm requiring a 34- to 36-mm-diameter endograft is independently associated with an increased rate of proximal fixation failure. This group of patients should be considered for more proximal seal strategies with fenestrated or branched devices vs open repair. Also, this group likely needs more stringent radiographic follow-up.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30686336\n\nAbstract\n\nMultidisciplinary care is recommended for the treatment of patients with ischemic and diabetic wounds. In addition to integrating care from multiple specialties, outpatient wound care centers provide an opportunity for continuity and organization of care after revascularization or hospitalization. The purpose of this study was to assess changes in the practice patterns and outcomes of patients treated by a tertiary care vascular surgery practice after the introduction of an affiliated outpatient wound care center.A prospective institutional database was used to identify patients who underwent lower-extremity revascularization, amputation, or surgical debridement during consecutive 3-year periods before (BWC; n = 735) and after (AWC; n = 1503) the opening of an affiliated wound care center. Patients were included if they underwent intervention for atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease or diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). Changes in case volume, surgical indication, and procedural characteristics were assessed. Clinical outcomes included freedom from lower-extremity amputations and mortality.We identified a total of 1751 procedures performed in 1249 limbs that met inclusion criteria. After the opening of the wound clinic, procedures related to limb salvage represented a greater proportion of overall cases performed by the vascular service (19% vs 26%; P < .0001). The volume of lower-extremity interventions increased by 64%, from 662 procedures in the BWC period to 1085 procedures in the AWC period. There was no difference in type of revascularization performed between the two study periods, although surgical debridements (from 8.9% to 13%; P = .01) and infrapopliteal endovascular interventions (from 21% to 28%; P = .04) significantly increased. Compared with BWC patients, AWC patients more frequently presented with DFUs (7.3% vs 13%; P = .002) and chronic wounds (39% vs 45%; P = .05). At 1 year of follow-up, major amputation rates were significantly lower in the AWC group than in the BWC cohort (5.5% vs 8.8%; P = .04). Treatment during the AWC period was associated with a reduced risk of major amputation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.62; P < .001), but no difference in all-cause mortality.The opening of an outpatient wound center affiliated with a tertiary vascular surgical practice was associated with a higher volume of limb salvage patients and procedures. The risk of major amputation decreased following the opening of the wound care center. Integrating vascular surgeons into wound centers may result in a synergistic system that promotes more aggressive and effective limb salvage.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2019.01.087\n\nView details for PubMedID 31153696\n\nAbstract\n\nPreprocedural cross-sectional imaging (PCSI) for peripheral artery disease (PAD) may vary due to patient complexity, anatomical disease burden, and physician preference. The objective of this study was to determine the utility of PCSI prior to percutaneous vascular interventions (PVIs) for PAD. Patients receiving first time lower extremity angiograms from 2013 to 2015 at a single institution were evaluated for PCSI performed within 180 days, defined as computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) evaluating abdominal to pedal vasculature. The primary outcome was technical success defined as improving the target outflow vessels to <30% stenosis. Of the 346 patients who underwent lower extremity angiograms, 158 (45.7%) patients had PCSI, including 150 patients had CTA and 8 patients had MRA. Of these, 48% were ordered by the referring provider (84% at an outside institution). Preprocedural cross-sectional imaging was performed at a median of 26 days (interquartile range: 9-53) prior to the procedure. The analysis of the institution's 5 vascular surgeons identified PCSI rates ranging from 31% to 70%. On multivariate analysis, chronic kidney disease (odds ratio [OR] = 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.73) was associated with less PSCI usage, and inpatient/emergency department evaluation (OR = 3.20; 95% CI: 1.58-6.50) and aortoiliac disease (OR = 2.78; 95% CI: 1.46-5.29) were associated with higher usage. After excluding 31 diagnostic procedures, technical success was not statistically significant with PSCI (91.3%) compared to without PCSI (85.6%), P = .11. When analyzing 89 femoral-popliteal occlusions, technical success was higher with PCSI (88%) compared to procedures without (69%) P = .026. Our analysis demonstrates that routine ordering of PCSI may not be warranted when considering technical success of PVI; however, PCSI may be helpful in treatment planning. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings in another practice setting, with more prescriptive use of PCSI to improve procedural success, and thereby improve the value of PCSI.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/1538574419887585\n\nView details for PubMedID 31746279\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Identification of a safe and effective medical therapy for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease remains a significant unmet medical need. Recent small cohort studies indicate that metformin, the world's most commonly prescribed oral hypoglycemic agent, may limit AAA enlargement. We sought to validate these preliminary observations in a larger cohort.METHODS: All patients with asymptomatic AAA disease managed in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System between 2003 and 2013 were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Those with a concomitant diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who also received two or more abdominal imaging studies (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound) documenting the presence and size of an AAA, separated by at least 1year, were included for review. Maximal AAA diameters were determined from radiologic reports. Further data acquisition was censored after surgical AAA repair, when performed. Comorbidities, active smoking status, and outpatient medication records (within 6months of AAA diagnosis) were also queried. Yearly AAA enlargement rates, as a function of metformin treatment status, were compared using two statistical models expressed in millimeters per year: a multivariate linear regression (model 1) and a multivariate mixed-effects model with random intercept and random slope (model 2).RESULTS: A total of 13,834 patients with 58,833 radiographic records were included in the analysis, with radiology imaging follow-up of 4.2± 2.6years (mean± standard deviation). The average age of the patients at AAA diagnosis was 69.8± 7.8years, and 39.7% had a metformin prescription within±6months of AAA. The mean growth rate for AAAs in the entire cohort was 1.4± 2.0mm/y by model 1 analysis and 1.3± 1.6mm/y by model 2 analysis. The unadjusted mean rate of AAA growth was 1.2± 1.9mm/y for patients prescribed metformin compared with 1.5± 2.2mm/y for those without (P< .001), a 20% decrease. This effect remained significant when adjusted for variables relevant on AAA progression: metformin prescription was associated with a reduction in yearly AAA growth rate of-0.23mm (95% confidence interval,-0.35 to-0.16; P< .001) by model 1 analysis and 0.20mm/y (95% confidence interval,-0.26 to-0.14; P< .001) by model 2 analysis. A subset analysis of 7462 patients with baseline AAA size of 35 to 49mm showed a similar inhibitory effect (1.4± 2.0mm/y to 1.7± 2.2mm/y; P< .001). Patients' factors associated with an increased yearly AAA growth rate were baseline AAA size, metastatic solid tumors, active smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic renal disease. Factors associated with decreased yearly AAA growth rates included prescriptions for angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers or sulfonylureas and the presence of diabetes-related complications.CONCLUSIONS: In a nationwide analysis of diabetic Veterans Affairs patients, prescription for metformin was associated with decreased AAA enlargement. These findings provide further support for the conduct of prospective clinical trials to test the ability of metformin to limit progression of early AAA disease.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30197158\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to understand drivers of cost for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) and to compare variation in cost among cases performed by vascular surgery (VS) with other services (OSs).METHODS: We collected internal hospital claims data for CEA and CAS between September 2013 and August 2015 and performed a financial analysis of all hospital costs including room accommodations, medications, medical and surgical supplies, imaging, and laboratory tests. Cases were stratified by presence of symptoms and procedure type, and costs of procedures performed by VS were compared with those performed by OSs.RESULTS: The cohort comprised 144 patients (78 asymptomatic, 66 symptomatic; 44 CAS, 100 CEA) receiving unilateral revascularization. VS (24 CAS, 70 CEA) and neurosurgery and neurointerventional radiology services (20 CAS, 30 CEA) performed all procedures. Age (71± 9years vs 70± 11years; P= .8) and length of stay (1.7± 2.1days vs 2.2± 2.4days; P=.73) were similar for VS and OSs. Symptoms were present before revascularization for 46% and were more commonly treated by OSs (78% vs 29%; P< .001). Case mix index was similar after stratifying by symptoms (asymptomatic, 1.28±0.35 vs 1.39± 0.42 [P= .5]; symptomatic, 1.66± 0.73 vs 1.82± 0.81 [P= .9]). The largest cost components were operating room (OR)-related costs, beds, and supplies, together accounting for 76% of costs. Asymptomatic patients had 37% lower average hospital costs. For asymptomatic CAS, average index hospitalization cost was 17% less for VS compared with OSs because of 78% lower intensive care unit costs, 44% lower OR-related costs, 40% lower medication costs, and 24% lower cardiac testing costs. VS had 22% higher supply costs. For asymptomatic CEA, average index hospitalization costs were 22% lower for VS, driven by lower OR-related costs (28%), medications (28%), imaging (62%), and neurointerventional monitoring (64%). Costs were 38% higher for CAS vs CEA. For symptomatic CAS, costs were similar for both groups. For symptomatic CEA, total costs were 14% lower for VS compared with OSs, driven by 25% lower OR-related costs, 62% lower neurointerventional monitoring, 20% step-down beds, and 28% lower supply costs (and counterbalanced by 117% higher intensive care unit costs).CONCLUSIONS: VS average hospital costs were lower for asymptomatic CAS and all CEAs compared with OSs. Drivers of higher cost appear to be attributed to variation in physicians' practice as well as patients' complexity, affording an opportunity to reduce cost by establishing standard practices when appropriate.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30197159\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE: To investigate the effects of exercise training on ventilatory efficiency and physiological responses to submaximal exercise in subjects with small abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).METHODS: Sixty-five male patients (72.3 ± 7.0 years) were randomized to exercise training (n = 33) or usual care group (n = 32). Exercise subjects participated in a training groups for 3 mo. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed before and after the study period and peak (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2, the ventilatory threshold (VT), the oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES), and the (Equation is included in full-text article.)E2/(Equation is included in full-text article.)CO2 slope were identified. Baseline work rates at VT were matched to examine cardiopulmonary responses after training.RESULTS: Significant interactions indicating improvements before and after training in the exercise group were noted for time (P < .01), (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2 (P < .01), and work rate (P < .01) at the VT. At peak effort, significant interactions were noted for time (P < .01) and work rate (P < .01), while borderline significance was noted for absolute (P = .07) and relative (P = .04) (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2. Significant interactions were observed for the OUES both when using all exercise data (P = .04) and when calculated up to the VT (P < .01). For the (Equation is included in full-text article.)E2/(Equation is included in full-text article.)CO2 slope, significance was noted only when calculated up to the VT (P = .04). After training, heart rate, (Equation is included in full-text article.)E, (Equation is included in full-text article.)O2 and respiratory exchange ratio were significantly attenuated for the same baseline work rate only in the exercise group (all P < .01).CONCLUSIONS: Exercise training improves ventilatory efficiency in patients with small AAA. In addition, patients who exercised exhibited less demanding cardiorespiratory responses to submaximal effort.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28727673\n\nAbstract\n\nThe ideal stent combination for chimney endovascular aneurysm repair remains undetermined. Therefore, we sought to identify optimal aortic and chimney stent combinations that are associated with the best outcomes by analyzing the worldwide collected experience in the PERformance of chImney technique for the treatment of Complex aortic pathoLogiES (PERICLES) registry.The PERICLES registry was reviewed for patients with pararenal aortic disease electively treated from 2008 to 2014. Eleven different aortic devices were identified with three distinct subgroups: group A (n = 224), nitinol/polyester; group B (n = 105), stainless steel/polyester; and group C (n = 69), nitinol/expanded polytetrafluoroethylene. The various chimney stent subtypes included the balloon-expandable covered stent (BECS), self-expanding covered stent, and bare-metal stent. Deidentified aortic and chimney device combinations were compared for risk of chimney occlusion, type IA endoleak, and survival. Effects of high-volume centers (>100 cases), use of an internal lining chimney stent, number of chimney stents, and number of chimney stent subtypes deployed were also considered. We considered demographics, comorbidities, and aortic anatomic features as potential confounders in all models.The 1- and 3-year freedom from BECS chimney occlusion was not different between groups (group A, 96% ± 2% and 87% ± 5%; groups B and C, 93% ± 3% and 76% ± 10%; Cox model, P = .33). Similarly, when non-BECS chimney stents were used, no difference in occlusion risk was noted for the three aortic device groupings; however, group C patients receiving BECS did have a trend toward higher occlusion risk relative to group C patients not receiving a BECS chimney stent (hazard ratio [HR], 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-18.84; P = .08). Patients receiving multiple chimney stents, irrespective of stent subtype, had a 1.8-fold increased risk of occlusion for each additional stent (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.9; P = .01). Use of a bare-metal endolining stent doubled the occlusion hazard (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.5; P = .05). Risk of type IA endoleak (intraoperatively and postoperatively) did not significantly differ for the aortic devices with BECS use; however, group C patients had higher risk relative to groups A/B without BECS (C vs B: odds ratio [OR], 3.2 [95% CI, 1-11; P = .05]; C vs A/B: OR, 2.4 [95% CI, 0.9-6.4; P = .08]). Patients treated at high-volume centers had significantly lower odds for development of type IA endoleak (OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7; P = .01) irrespective of aortic or chimney device combination. Mortality risk was significantly higher in group C + BECS vs group A + BECS (HR, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.6-17.5; P = .006). The 1- and 3-year survival for groups A, B, and C (+BECS) was as follows: group A, 97% ± 1% and 92% ± 3%; group B, 93% ± 3% and 83% ± 7%; and group C, 84% ± 7% and 63% ± 14%. Use of more than one chimney subtype was associated with increased mortality (HR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.4-7.5; P = .006).Within the PERICLES registry, use of nitinol/polyester stent graft devices with BECS during chimney endovascular aneurysm repair is associated with improved survival compared with other aortic endografts. However, this advantage was not observed for non-BECS repairs. Repairs incorporating multiple chimney subtypes were also associated with increased mortality risk. Importantly, increasing chimney stent number and bare-metal endolining stents increase chimney occlusion risk, whereas patients treated at low-volume centers have higher risk of type IA endoleak.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29395423\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Effective strategies to reduce costs associated with endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) remain elusive for many medical centers. In this study, targeted interventions to reduce inpatient EVAR costs were identified and implemented.METHODS: From June 2015 to February 2016, we analyzed the EVAR practice at a high-volume academic medical center to identify, to rank, and ultimately to reduce procedure-related costs. In this analysis, per-patient direct costs to the hospital were compared before (September 2013-May 2015) and after (March 2016-January 2017) interventions were implemented. Improvement efforts concentrated on three categories that accounted for a majority of costs: implants, rooming costs, and computed tomography scans performed during the index hospitalization.RESULTS: Costs were compared between 141 EVAR procedures before implementation (PRE period) and 47 EVAR procedures after implementation (POST period). Based on data obtained through the Society for Vascular Surgery EVAR Cost Demonstration Project, it was determined that implantable device costs were higher than those at peer institutions. New purchasing strategies were implemented, resulting in a 30.8% decrease in per-case device costs between the PRE and POST periods. Care pathways were modified to reduce use of and costs for computed tomography scans obtained during the index hospitalization. Compared with baseline, per-case imaging costs decreased by 92.9% (P< .001), including a 99.0% (P= .001) reduction in postprocessing costs. Care pathways were also implemented to reduce preprocedural rooming for patients traveling long distances the day before surgery, resulting in a 50% decrease in utilization rate (35.4% PRE to 17.0% POST; P= .021), without having a significant impact on median postprocedural length of stay (PRE, 2days [interquartile range, 1-11days]; POST, 2days [1-7days]; P= .185). Medication costs also decreased by 38.2% (P< .001) as a hospital-wide effort.CONCLUSIONS: Excessive costs associated with EVAR threaten the sustainability of these procedures in health care organizations. Targeted cost reduction efforts can effectively reduce expenses without compromising quality or limiting patients' access.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30185384\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVES: Previous studies have reported increased perioperative mortality of nonruptured symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms (Sx-AAA) compared with asymptomatic elective AAA (E-AAA) repairs, but no long-term-outcomes have been reported. We sought to compare long-term outcomes of Sx-AAA and E-AAA after repair at a single academic institution.METHODS: Patients receiving AAA repair for Sx-AAA and E-AAA from 1995 through 2015 were included. Ruptured AAA and suprarenal or thoracoabdominal AAA were excluded. Demographics, comorbidities, and operative approach were collected. Long-term mortality was the primary outcome, determined by chart review or link to Social Security Death Index. Additionally, long-term mortality and reinterventions were compared after groups were matched with nearest neighbor propensity to reduce bias.RESULTS: AAA repair was performed for 1054 E-AAA (383 open repair [36%], 671 endovascular aneurysm repair [EVAR] [64%]), and 139 symptomatic aneurysms (60 open repair [43%], 79 EVAR [57%]). Age (73years vs 74years; P= .13) and aneurysm diameter were similar between Sx-AAA and E-AAA (6.0cm vs 5.8cm; P= .5). The proportion of women was higher for Sx-AAA (26% vs 16%; P= .003), as was the proportion of non-Caucasians (40% vs 29%; P= .009). After propensity matching, there were no differences between groups for patient characteristics, AAA diameter, treatment modality, or comorbidities, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, lung disease, diabetes, renal disease, and smoking history. Women were treated for Sx-AAA at significantly smaller aortic diameters; however, compared with men (5.1cm vs 6.3cm; P< .001). Perioperative mortality was 5.0% for Sx-AAA and 2.3% for E-AAA (P= .055). By life-table analysis, Sx-AAA had lower 5-year (62% vs 71%) and 10-year (39% vs 51%) survivals (P= .01) compared with E-AAA for the entire cohort. Similar trends were observed for 5-year and 10-year mortality after propensity matching (63% and 40% vs 71% and 52%; P= .05). When stratified by repair type 5-year and 10-year survivals trended lower after open surgery (68% and 42% Sx-AAA vs 84% and 59% E-AAA; P= .08) but not EVAR (59% and 40% Sx-AAA vs 61% and 49% E-AAA; P= .4). Aneurysm-related reinterventions were similar for Sx-AAA and E-AAA (15% vs 14%; P= .8). Reinterventions were more common after EVAR compared with open repair (22% vs 7%, Sx-AAA P= .015; 20% vs 4% E-AAA; P= .007).CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Sx-AAA had lower long-term survival and similar aneurysm-related reinterventions compared with patients with E-AAA undergoing repair. Women also underwent repair for Sx-AAA at a significantly smaller size when compared with men, which emphasizes the role of gender in AAA symptomatology. Differences in long-term survival may be only partially explained by measured patient, aneurysm, and operative factors, and may reflect unmeasured social factors or suggest inherent differences in pathophysiology of Sx-AAAs.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29705087\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a chronic degenerative inflammatory disease. Multi-factors including genetic, environmental and lifestyles determine the onsets and progression of AAAs. Currently surgical repair remains the only effective aneurysm treatment, but no pharmacological therapy is available for limiting further enlargement of small AAAs and fetal rupture.OBJECTIVE: This article is to review our current understanding of angiotensin II (Ang II) and its type 1 receptor (AT1) in AAA pathogenesis as well as the translational potential of AT1 receptor blocker (ARB) treatment for treating clinical AAA disease.RESULTS: While many pathways or molecules have been shown to associate with AAA formation and progression, accumulating evidence indicates the most significant importance of peptide hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) and its type 1 receptor (AT1) in AAA pathogenesis and suggest the translational value of targeting inhibition of AT1 in treating clinical AAA disease. This review summarized the influences of genetic angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor deficiency and pharmacological AT1 receptor blocker (ARB) treatment on experimental AAAs. A discussion has also been made on whether and how ARB medication in AAA patients changes the natural course of clinical AAAs, including aneurysm enlargement rate, rupture and AAA-specific mortality. Additionally, we provided information on two registered clinical trials which are to test the efficacy of telmisartan and valsartan in limiting small AAA enlargement.CONCLUSIONS: Ang II/AT1 pathway plays a critical role in aneurysmal pathogenesis. Targeting AT1 via ARB will help establishing novel pharmacological therapies for limiting continuous enlargement of small AAAs in patients.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29359665\n\nAbstract\n\nDecision-making related to the care of patients with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is complex. Aneurysms present with varying risks of rupture, and patient-specific factors influence anticipated life expectancy, operative risk, and need to intervene. Careful attention to the choice of operative strategy along with optimal treatment of medical comorbidities is critical to achieving excellent outcomes. Moreover, appropriate postoperative surveillance is necessary to minimize subsequent aneurysm-related death or morbidity.The committee made specific practice recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Three systematic reviews were conducted to support this guideline. Two focused on evaluating the best modalities and optimal frequency for surveillance after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). A third focused on identifying the best available evidence on the diagnosis and management of AAA. Specific areas of focus included (1) general approach to the patient, (2) treatment of the patient with an AAA, (3) anesthetic considerations and perioperative management, (4) postoperative and long-term management, and (5) cost and economic considerations.Along with providing guidance regarding the management of patients throughout the continuum of care, we have revised a number of prior recommendations and addressed a number of new areas of significance. New guidelines are provided for the surveillance of patients with an AAA, including recommended surveillance imaging at 12-month intervals for patients with an AAA of 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter. We recommend endovascular repair as the preferred method of treatment for ruptured aneurysms. Incorporating knowledge gained through the Vascular Quality Initiative and other regional quality collaboratives, we suggest that the Vascular Quality Initiative mortality risk score be used for mutual decision-making with patients considering aneurysm repair. We also suggest that elective EVAR be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality and conversion rate to open surgical repair of 2% or less and that perform at least 10 EVAR cases each year. We also suggest that elective open aneurysm repair be limited to hospitals with a documented mortality of 5% or less and that perform at least 10 open aortic operations of any type each year. To encourage the development of effective systems of care that would lead to improved outcomes for those patients undergoing emergent repair, we suggest a door-to-intervention time of <90 minutes, based on a framework of 30-30-30 minutes, for the management of the patient with a ruptured aneurysm. We recommend treatment of type I and III endoleaks as well as of type II endoleaks with aneurysm expansion but recommend continued surveillance of type II endoleaks not associated with aneurysm expansion. Whereas antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for patients with an aortic prosthesis before any dental procedure involving the manipulation of the gingival or periapical region of teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended before respiratory tract procedures, gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedures, and dermatologic or musculoskeletal procedures unless the potential for infection exists or the patient is immunocompromised. Increased utilization of color duplex ultrasound is suggested for postoperative surveillance after EVAR in the absence of endoleak or aneurysm expansion.Important new recommendations are provided for the care of patients with an AAA, including suggestions to improve mutual decision-making between the treating physician and the patients and their families as well as a number of new strategies to enhance perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing elective and emergent repair. Areas of uncertainty are highlighted that would benefit from further investigation in addition to existing limitations in diagnostic tests, pharmacologic agents, intraoperative tools, and devices.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29268916\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: Mural angiogenesis and macrophage accumulation are two pathologic hallmarks of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease. The heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is an essential regulator of angiogenesis and macrophage function. In this study, we investigated HIF-1 expression and activity in clinical and experimental AAA disease.METHODS: Human aortic samples were obtained from 24 AAA patients and six organ donors during open abdominal surgery. Experimental AAAs were created in 10-week-old male C57BL/6J mice by transient intra-aortic infusion of porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE). Expression of HIF-1alpha and its target gene messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were assessed in aneurysmal and control aortae. The HIF-1alpha inhibitors 2-methoxyestradiol and digoxin, the prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing protein (PHD) inhibitors cobalt chloride and JNJ-42041935, and the vehicle alone as control were administered daily to mice at varying time points beginning before or after PPE infusion. Influences on experimental AAA formation and progression were assessed by serial transabdominal ultrasound measurements of aortic diameter and histopathologic analysis at sacrifice.RESULTS: The mRNA levels for HIF-1alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor A, glucose transporter 1, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 were significantly increased in both human and experimental aneurysm tissue. Tissue immunostaining detected more HIF-1alpha protein in both human and experimental aneurysmal aortae compared with respective control aortae. Treatment with either HIF-1alpha inhibitor, beginning before or after PPE infusion, prevented enlargement of experimental aneurysms. Both HIF-1alpha inhibition regimens attenuated medial elastin degradation, smooth muscle cell depletion, and mural angiogenesis and the accumulation of macrophages, T cells, and B cells. Whereas mRNA levels for PHD1 and PHD2 were elevated in experimental aneurysmal aortae, pharmacologic inhibition of PHDs had limited effect on experimental aneurysm progression.CONCLUSIONS: Expression of HIF-1alpha and its target genes is increased in human and experimental AAAs. Treatment with HIF-1alpha inhibitors limits experimental AAA progression, with histologic evidence of attenuated mural leukocyte infiltration and angiogenesis. These findings underscore the potential significance of HIF-1alpha in aneurysm pathogenesis and as a target for pharmacologic suppression of AAA disease.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29242064\n\nAbstract\n\nAngiotensin (Ang) II type 1 receptor (AT1) activation is essential for the development of exogenous Ang II-induced abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) in hyperlipidemic animals. Experimental data derived from this modeling system, however, provide limited insight into the role of endogenous Ang II in aneurysm pathogenesis. Consequently, the potential translational value of AT1 inhibition in clinical AAA disease management remains incompletely understood on the basis of the existing literature.AAAs were created in wild-type (WT) and AT1a knockout (KO) mice by intra-aortic infusion of porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE). WT mice were treated with the AT1 receptor antagonist telmisartan, 10 mg/kg/d in chow, or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) antagonist GW9662, 3 mg/kg/d through oral gavage, beginning 1 week before or 3 days after PPE infusion. Influences on aneurysm progression as well as mechanistic insights into AT1-mediated pathogenic processes were determined using noninvasive ultrasound imaging, histopathology, aortic gene expression profiling, and flow cytometric analysis.After PPE infusion, aortic enlargement was almost completely abrogated in AT1a KO mice compared with WT mice. As defined by a ≥50% increase in aortic diameter, no PPE-infused, AT1a KO mouse actually developed an AAA. On histologic evaluation, medial smooth muscle cellularity and elastic lamellae were preserved in AT1a KO mice compared with WT mice, with marked attenuation of mural angiogenesis and leukocyte infiltration. In WT mice, telmisartan administration effectively suppressed aneurysm pathogenesis after PPE infusion as well, regardless of whether treatment was initiated before or after aneurysm creation or continued for a limited or extended time. Telmisartan treatment was associated with reduced messenger RNA levels for CCL5 and matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 in aneurysmal aortae, with no apparent effect on PPARγ-regulated gene expression. Administration of the PPARγ antagonist GW9662 failed to \"rescue\" the aneurysm phenotype in telmisartan-treated, PPE-infused WT mice. Neither effector T-cell differentiation nor regulatory T-cell cellularity was affected by telmisartan treatment status.Telmisartan effectively suppresses the progression of elastase-induced AAAs without apparent effect on PPARγ activation or T-cell differentiation. These findings reinforce the critical importance of endogenous AT1 activation in experimental AAA pathogenesis and reinforce the translational potential of AT1 inhibition in medical aneurysm disease management.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2016.12.110\n\nView details for PubMedID 28434702\n\nAbstract\n\nAneurysm regression and target vessel patency during early and mid-term follow-up may be related to the effect of stent-graft configuration on the anatomy. We quantified geometry and remodeling of the renal arteries and aneurysm following fenestrated (F-) or snorkel/chimney (Sn-) endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR).Twenty-nine patients (mean age, 76.8 ± 7.8 years) treated with F- or Sn-EVAR underwent computed tomography angiography at preop, postop, and follow-up. Three-dimensional geometric models of the aorta and renal arteries were constructed. Renal branch angle was defined relative to the plane orthogonal to the aorta. End-stent angle was defined as the angulation between the stent and native distal artery. Aortic volumes were computed for the whole aorta, lumen, and their difference (excluded lumen). Renal patency, reintervention, early mortality, postoperative renal impairment, and endoleak were reviewed.From preop to postop, F-renal branches angled upward, Sn-renal branches angled downward (P < 0.05), and Sn-renals exhibited increased end-stent angulation (12 ± 15°, P < 0.05). From postop to follow-up, branch angles did not change for either F- or Sn-renals, whereas F-renals exhibited increased end-stent angulation (5 ± 10°, P < 0.05). From preop to postop, whole aortic and excluded lumen volumes increased by 5 ± 14% and 74 ± 81%, whereas lumen volume decreased (39 ± 27%, P < 0.05). From postop to follow-up, whole aortic and excluded lumen volumes decreased similarly (P < 0.05), leaving the lumen volume unchanged. At median follow-up of 764 days (range, 7-1,653), primary renal stent patency was 94.1% and renal impairment occurred in 2 patients (6.7%).Although F- and Sn-EVAR resulted in significant, and opposite, changes to renal branch angle, only Sn-EVAR resulted in significant end-stent angulation increase. Longitudinal geometric analysis suggests that these anatomic alterations are primarily generated early as a consequence of the procedure itself and, although persistent, they show no evidence of continued significant change during the subsequent postoperative follow-up period.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.avsg.2016.12.005\n\nView details for PubMedID 28390918\n\nAbstract\n\nTo evaluate Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-conjugated human ferritin (HFn) iron oxide nanoparticles for in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of vascular inflammation and angiogenesis in experimental carotid disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).HFn was genetically engineered to express the RGD peptide and Fe3 O4 nanoparticles were chemically synthesized inside the engineered HFn (RGD-HFn). Macrophage-rich left carotid lesions were induced by ligation in FVB mice made hyperlipidemic and diabetic (n = 14), with the contralateral right carotid serving as control. Murine AAAs were created by continuous angiotensin II infusion in ApoE-deficient mice (n = 12), while control mice underwent saline infusion (n = 8). All mice were imaged before and after intravenous injection with either RGD-HFn-Fe3 O4 or HFn-Fe3 O4 using a gradient-echo sequence on a whole-body 3T clinical scanner, followed by histological analysis. The nanoparticle accumulation was assessed by the extent of T2*-induced carotid lumen reduction (% lumen loss) or aortic T2*-weighted signal intensity reduction (% SI [signal intensity] loss).RGD-HFn-Fe3 O4 was taken up more than HFn-Fe3 O4 in both the ligated left carotid arteries (% lumen loss; 69 ± 9% vs. 36 ± 7%, P = 0.01) and AAAs (% SI loss; 47 ± 6% vs. 20 ± 5%, P = 0.01). The AAA % SI loss correlated positively with AAA size (r = 0.89, P < 0.001). Histology confirmed the greater accumulation and colocalization of RGD-HFn-Fe3 O4 to both vascular macrophages and endothelial cells.RGD-HFn-Fe3 O4 enhances in vivo MRI by targeting both vascular inflammation and angiogenesis, and provides a promising translatable MRI approach to detect high-risk atherosclerotic and aneurysmal vascular diseases.1 J.

Current treatment strategies for claudication have limitations. PACE (Patients With Intermittent Claudication Injected With ALDH Bright Cells) is a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 exploratory clinical trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of autologous bone marrow-derived aldehyde dehydrogenase bright (ALDHbr) cells in patients with peripheral artery disease and to explore associated claudication physiological mechanisms.All participants, randomized 1:1 to receive ALDHbr cells or placebo, underwent bone marrow aspiration and isolation of ALDHbr cells, followed by 10 injections into the thigh and calf of the index leg. The coprimary end points were change from baseline to 6 months in peak walking time (PWT), collateral count, peak hyperemic popliteal flow, and capillary perfusion measured by magnetic resonance imaging, as well as safety.A total of 82 patients with claudication and infrainguinal peripheral artery disease were randomized at 9 sites, of whom 78 had analyzable data (57 male, 21 female patients; mean age, 66±9 years). The mean±SEM differences in the change over 6 months between study groups for PWT (0.9±0.8 minutes; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.6 to 2.5; P=0.238), collateral count (0.9±0.6 arteries; 95% CI, -0.2 to 2.1; P=0.116), peak hyperemic popliteal flow (0.0±0.4 mL/s; 95% CI, -0.8 to 0.8; P=0.978), and capillary perfusion (-0.2±0.6%; 95% CI, -1.3 to 0.9; P=0.752) were not significant. In addition, there were no significant differences for the secondary end points, including quality-of-life measures. There were no adverse safety outcomes. Correlative relationships between magnetic resonance imaging measures and PWT were not significant. A post hoc exploratory analysis suggested that ALDHbr cell administration might be associated with an increase in the number of collateral arteries (1.5±0.7; 95% CI, 0.1-2.9; P=0.047) in participants with completely occluded femoral arteries.ALDHbr cell administration did not improve PWT or magnetic resonance outcomes, and the changes in PWT were not associated with the anatomic or physiological magnetic resonance imaging end points. Future peripheral artery disease cell therapy investigational trial design may be informed by new anatomic and perfusion insights.URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Despite high technical success and midterm patency of snorkel stent configurations, concerns remain regarding the perceived increased incidence of early gutter-related type Ia endoleaks. We aimed to evaluate the incidence and natural history of gutter-related type Ia endoleaks following ch-EVAR.Review of medical records and available imaging studies, including completion angiography and serial computed tomographic angiography, was performed for all patients undergoing ch-EVAR at our institution between September 2009 and January 2015. Only procedures involving ≥1 renal artery with or without visceral snorkel stents were included. Primary outcomes of the study were presence and persistence or resolution of early gutter-related type Ia endoleak. Secondary outcomes included aneurysm sac shrinkage and need for secondary intervention related to the presence of type Ia gutter endoleak.Sixty patients (mean age, 75.8 ± 7.6 years; male, 70.0%) underwent ch-EVAR with a total of 111 snorkel stents (97 renal [33 bilateral renal], 12 superior mesenteric artery, 2 celiac). A mean of 1.9 ± 0.6 snorkel stents were placed per patient. Early gutter-related type Ia endoleaks were noted on 30.0% (n = 18) of initial postoperative imaging studies. Follow-up imaging revealed spontaneous resolution of these gutter endoleaks in 44.3%, 65.2%, and 88.4% of patients at 6, 12, and 18 months postprocedure, respectively. Long-term anticoagulation, degree of oversizing, stent type and diameter, and other clinical/anatomic variables were not significantly associated with presence of gutter endoleaks. Two patients (3.3%) required secondary intervention related to persistent gutter endoleak. At a mean radiologic follow-up of 20.9 months, no difference in mean aneurysm sac size change was observed between those with or without early type Ia gutter endoleak (-6.1 ± 10.0 mm vs -4.9 ± 11.5 mm; P = .23).Gutter-related type Ia endoleaks represent a relatively frequent early occurrence after ch-EVAR, but appears to resolve spontaneously in the majority of cases during early to midterm follow-up. Given that few ch-EVAR patients require reintervention related to gutter endoleaks and the presence of such endoleak did not correlate to increased risk for aneurysm sac growth, its natural history may be more benign than originally expected.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2016.10.085\n\nView details for PubMedID 28189356\n\nAbstract\n\nWe compared the management of patients with symptomatic, unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) treated at a tertiary care center between two decades. This 20-year period encapsulated a shift in surgical approach to aortic aneurysms from primarily open to primarily endovascular, and we sought to determine the effect of this shift in the evaluation, treatment, and clinical outcomes of patients with symptomatic AAA.We reviewed 1429 consecutive patients with unruptured AAAs treated at a tertiary care hospital by six staff surgeons between 1995 and 2004 (era 1) and between 2005 and 2014 (era 2). Of those patients, 160 (11%) were symptomatic from their aneurysm and were included in our study. Patient demographics, operative approach, and outcomes were analyzed and compared for each period.Era 1 included 75 patients (71% men; average age, 73.1 ± 10.0 years) treated for symptomatic AAA (91.9% infrarenal, 4.0% juxtarenal, and 4.0% pararenal); of these, 68% were treated with open repair and 32.0% were treated with an endovascular repair. Perioperative mortality during this period was 5.3% (7.8% for the open cohort and 0% for the endovascular cohort). Era 2 included 85 patients (72.9% men; average age 72.0 ± 9.5 years) treated for symptomatic AAA (90.1% infrarenal, 7.5% juxtarenal, and 2.4% pararenal); of these, 29% were treated open and 71% underwent endovascular repair. Perioperative mortality was 5.9% (8.0% for the open cohort and 5.0% for the endovascular cohort). Era 2 had a significantly higher rate of endovascular repair compared with era 1 (71% vs 32%; P < .0001) and a trend toward decreased long-term mortality. The length of stay for era 2 was significantly reduced compared with era 1 (4 days vs 6 days; P = .005).To our knowledge, this is the largest single-institution cohort of symptomatic AAAs, which comprise 10% to 11% of overall aneurysms. As expected, we found a significant shift over time in the approach to these patients from a primarily open to a primarily endovascular technique. The modern era was also associated with decreased lengths of stay and fewer gastrointestinal and wound complications but no significant differences in overall perioperative mortality.\n\nView details for PubMedID 28619644\n\nAbstract\n\nEndovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) with the chimney technique (ch-EVAR) has been used for the treatment of aortic aneurysms as an alternative approach to fenestrated endografting or open repair. Nonetheless, the need for an upper extremity arterial access may contribute to a higher risk for periprocedural cerebrovascular events. This study reports on the perioperative cerebral and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) after ch-EVAR.The PERICLES registry (PERformance of the chImney technique for the treatment of Complex aortic pathoLogiES) is an international, retrospective multicenter study evaluating the performance of ch-EVAR for the treatment of complex aortic pathologies. For the purpose of the current analysis, 425 patients treated by ch-EVAR between 2008 and 2014 were included. The primary outcome of this analysis was the incidence of procedure related cerebrovascular events defined as transient ischemic attack or stroke. The secondary end point was in-hospital MACCE, including acute coronary syndrome, stroke, and death of any cause.The incidence of clinical relevant cerebrovascular events was 1.9% (8/425). A postoperative transient ischemic attack was observed in four patients (0.95%) and a stroke in additional four (0.95%). Three patients died during the hospital stay secondary to sequelae from postoperative stroke. A prior history of stroke/transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, previous carotid revascularization, or known carotid artery disease did not significantly increase the risk for adverse neurologic events. The overall MACCE rate amounted to 8.5% (36/425). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the use of bilateral upper extremity access (odds ratio [OR], 2.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-7.45]), aneurysm rupture (OR, 5.33; 95% CI, 1.74-16.33), and a prolonged operation time (>290 minutes; OR, 1.005; 95% CI, 1.001-1.008) were associated with a significantly increased risk for MACCE.This analysis demonstrates that ch-EVAR is associated with a relatively low rate of cerebrovascular events. However, a postoperative stroke is associated with increased mortality. Ruptured aneurysms, bilateral upper extremity access as in case of multiple chimney graft placement, and longer operative times were identified as independent risk factors for MACCE.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29103932\n\nAbstract\n\nThe clinical decision-making utility of scoring algorithms for predicting mortality after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms (rAAAs) remains unknown. We sought to determine the clinical utility of the algorithms compared with our clinical decision making and outcomes for management of rAAA during a 10-year period.Patients admitted with a diagnosis rAAA at a large university hospital were identified from 2005 to 2014. The Glasgow Aneurysm Score, Hardman Index, Vancouver Score, Edinburgh Ruptured Aneurysm Score, University of Washington Ruptured Aneurysm Score, Vascular Study Group of New England rAAA Risk Score, and the Artificial Neural Network Score were analyzed for accuracy in predicting mortality. Among patients quantified into the highest-risk group (predicted mortality >80%-85%), we compared the predicted with the actual outcome to determine how well these scores predicted futility.The cohort comprised 64 patients. Of those, 24 (38%) underwent open repair, 36 (56%) underwent endovascular repair, and 4 (6%) received only comfort care. Overall mortality was 30% (open repair, 26%; endovascular repair, 24%; no repair, 100%). As assessed by the scoring systems, 5% to 35% of patients were categorized as high-mortality risk. Intersystem agreement was poor, with κ values ranging from 0.06 to 0.79. Actual mortality was lower than the predicted mortality (50%-70% vs 78%-100%) for all scoring systems, with each scoring system overestimating mortality by 10% to 50%. Mortality rates for patients not designated into the high-risk cohort were dramatically lower, ranging from 7% to 29%. Futility, defined as 100% mortality, was predicted in five of 63 patients with the Hardman Index and in two of 63 of the University of Washington score. Of these, surgery was not offered to one of five and one of two patients, respectively. If one of these two models were used to withhold operative intervention, the mortality of these patients would have been 100%. The actual mortality for these patients was 60% and 50%, respectively.Clinical algorithms for predicting mortality after rAAA were not useful for predicting futility. Most patients with rAAA were not classified in the highest-risk group by the clinical decision models. Among patients identified as highest risk, predicted mortality was overestimated compared with actual mortality. The data from this study support the limited value to surgeons of the currently published algorithms.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2016.07.121\n\nView details for PubMedID 27871490\n\nAbstract\n\nA key aspect of the precision medicine effort is the development of informatics tools that can analyze and interpret \"big data\" sets in an automated and adaptive fashion while providing accurate and actionable clinical information. The aims of this study were to develop machine learning algorithms for the identification of disease and the prognostication of mortality risk and to determine whether such models perform better than classical statistical analyses.Focusing on peripheral artery disease (PAD), patient data were derived from a prospective, observational study of 1755 patients who presented for elective coronary angiography. We employed multiple supervised machine learning algorithms and used diverse clinical, demographic, imaging, and genomic information in a hypothesis-free manner to build models that could identify patients with PAD and predict future mortality. Comparison was made to standard stepwise linear regression models.Our machine-learned models outperformed stepwise logistic regression models both for the identification of patients with PAD (area under the curve, 0.87 vs 0.76, respectively; P = .03) and for the prediction of future mortality (area under the curve, 0.76 vs 0.65, respectively; P = .10). Both machine-learned models were markedly better calibrated than the stepwise logistic regression models, thus providing more accurate disease and mortality risk estimates.Machine learning approaches can produce more accurate disease classification and prediction models. These tools may prove clinically useful for the automated identification of patients with highly morbid diseases for which aggressive risk factor management can improve outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2016.04.026\n\nView details for PubMedID 27266594\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC5079774\n\nAbstract\n\nTo evaluate Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-conjugated human ferritin (HFn) iron oxide nanoparticles for in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of vascular inflammation and angiogenesis in experimental carotid disease and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).HFn was genetically engineered to express the RGD peptide and Fe3 O4 nanoparticles were chemically synthesized inside the engineered HFn (RGD-HFn). Macrophage-rich left carotid lesions were induced by ligation in FVB mice made hyperlipidemic and diabetic (n = 14), with the contralateral right carotid serving as control. Murine AAAs were created by continuous angiotensin II infusion in ApoE-deficient mice (n = 12), while control mice underwent saline infusion (n = 8). All mice were imaged before and after intravenous injection with either RGD-HFn-Fe3 O4 or HFn-Fe3 O4 using a gradient-echo sequence on a whole-body 3T clinical scanner, followed by histological analysis. The nanoparticle accumulation was assessed by the extent of T2*-induced carotid lumen reduction (% lumen loss) or aortic T2*-weighted signal intensity reduction (% SI [signal intensity] loss).RGD-HFn-Fe3 O4 was taken up more than HFn-Fe3 O4 in both the ligated left carotid arteries (% lumen loss; 69 ± 9% vs. 36 ± 7%, P = 0.01) and AAAs (% SI loss; 47 ± 6% vs. 20 ± 5%, P = 0.01). The AAA % SI loss correlated positively with AAA size (r = 0.89, P < 0.001). Histology confirmed the greater accumulation and colocalization of RGD-HFn-Fe3 O4 to both vascular macrophages and endothelial cells.RGD-HFn-Fe3 O4 enhances in vivo MRI by targeting both vascular inflammation and angiogenesis, and provides a promising translatable MRI approach to detect high-risk atherosclerotic and aneurysmal vascular diseases.1 J.

We queried the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative to identify unique demographic and technical risks for such complications.The Vascular Quality Initiative peripheral vascular intervention data files from years 2010 to 2014 were analyzed to compare puncture site complication rates and associations encountered with either brachial or femoral arterial access for peripheral vascular intervention. Procedures requiring multiple access sites were excluded. Complications were defined as wound hematoma or access vessel stenosis/occlusion. Univariate and hierarchical logistic regression was used to identify independent factors associated with site complications after brachial access.Of 44,634 eligible peripheral vascular intervention procedures, 732 (1.6%) were performed through brachial access. Brachial access was associated with an increased complication rate compared with femoral access (9.0% vs 3.3%; P < .001), including more hematomas (7.2% vs 3.0%; P < .001) and access site stenosis/occlusion (2.1% vs 0.4%; P < .001). On univariate analysis, factors associated with brachial access complications included age, female gender, and sheath size. Complications occurred less frequently after arterial cutdown (4.1%) compared with either ultrasound-guided (11.8%) or fluoroscopically guided percutaneous access (7.3%; P = .07 across all variables). Neither surgeons' overall peripheral vascular intervention experience nor prior experience with brachial access predicted likelihood of adverse events. By multivariate analysis, male gender (odds ratio [OR], 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28-0.84; P < .01) and arterial cutdown (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.07-0.87; P = .04) were associated with significantly decreased risk for access complications. Larger sheath sizes (>5F) were associated with increased risk of complications (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.07-4.49; P = .03).Brachial access for peripheral vascular intervention carries significantly increased risks for access site occlusion or hematoma formation. Arterial cutdown and smaller sheath diameters are associated with lower complication rates and thus should be considered when arm access is required.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2016.02.019\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000378562900021\n\nView details for PubMedID 27021376\n\nAbstract\n\nIn population-based studies performed on multiple continents during the past two decades, diabetes mellitus has been negatively associated with the prevalence and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease. We investigated the possibility that metformin, the primary oral hypoglycemic agent in use worldwide, may influence the progression of AAA disease.Preoperative AAA patients with diabetes were identified from an institutional database. After tabulation of individual cardiovascular and demographic risk factors and prescription drug regimens, odds ratios for categorical influences on annual AAA enlargement were calculated through nominal logistical regression. Experimental AAA modeling experiments were subsequently performed in normoglycemic mice to validate the database-derived observations as well as to suggest potential mechanisms of metformin-mediated aneurysm suppression.Fifty-eight patients met criteria for study inclusion. Of 11 distinct classes of medication considered, only metformin use was negatively associated with AAA enlargement. This association remained significant after controlling for gender, age, cigarette smoking status, and obesity. The median enlargement rate in AAA patients not taking oral diabetic medication was 1.5 mm/y; by nominal logistic regression, metformin, hyperlipidemia, and age ≥70 years were associated with below-median enlargement, whereas sulfonylurea therapy, initial aortic diameter ≥40 mm, and statin use were associated with above-median enlargement. In experimental modeling, metformin dramatically suppressed the formation and progression, with medial elastin and smooth muscle preservation and reduced aortic mural macrophage, CD8 T cell, and neovessel density.Epidemiologic evidence of AAA suppression in diabetes may be attributable to concurrent therapy with the oral hypoglycemic agent metformin.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jvs.2016.02.020\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000378562900009\n\nView details for PubMedID 27106243\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4925242\n\nAbstract\n\nVisceral arteries are commonly involved in endovascular repair of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). To improve repair techniques and reduce long-term complications involving visceral arteries, it is crucial to understand in vivo arterial geometry and the deformations due to visceral organ movement with respiration. This study quantifies deformation of the celiac, superior mesenteric (SMA), and renal arteries during respiration and correlates the deformations with diaphragmatic excursion.Sixteen patients with small AAAs underwent magnetic resonance angiography during inspiratory and expiratory breathholds. From geometric models of the aorta and visceral arteries, vessel length, branch angle, curvature, and positions were computed, along with degree of diaphragmatic excursion as indicated by kidney translation.From inspiration to expiration, the celiac artery exhibited axial shortening of 4.8 ± 6.4% (P < 0.001) and a mean curvature increase of 0.03 ± 0.02 mm(-1), greater than other visceral arteries (P < 0.01). With expiration, the SMA, left and right renal arteries (LRA and RRA) angled upward by -9.8 ± 6.4°, -6.4 ± 6.4°, and -5.2 ± 5.0°, respectively (P < 0.005). All vessels translated superiorly (P < 0.0005) and posteriorly (P < 0.01), and the SMA translated rightward additionally (P < 0.005). The left and right kidneys translated by 22 ± 9 mm and 21 ± 9 mm, mostly superiorly (P < 0.001). Translations of all visceral arteries were moderately correlated to the right kidney (R > 0.50). Correlation of the LRA with the left kidney was greater than that of the RRA with the right kidney.The celiac artery exhibited less branch angle change, and greater axial and curvature deformations than the other visceral arteries, due to the vicinity to the live"
