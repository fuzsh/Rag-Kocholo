        "text": "Katie Alemany (she/her) | T32 Appointee\n\nBS in Biology, Pennsylvania State University\n\nMoore Lab\n\nkaitlin.alemany@cuanschutz.edu\n\nRotation Labs: Rytis Prekeris, Eszter Vladar, Jeff Moore\n\nResearch: I joined this program with a passion for cell biology and a drive to learn more about it. Each of my rotations were in different areas of focus but each touched on big biological concepts and processes. My thesis tests the model that cells create programs for regulating microtubule dynamics based on the expression of tubulin genes or isotypes, post-translational modifications, and motor proteins that are regulated by these differences and modulate microtubule dynamics.\n\nAbout Me: I am originally from California but moved to Colorado with my family before college. Coming back to be close to family was an easy decision and now I can spend time with them, my husband, and my dog Sky.\n\nCareer Goals: My goal is to become a professor at an institution with a strong research and teaching mission. After I graduated from Penn State with a degree in Biology, I joined an entomology lab as a PRA to gain more experience in scientific research. Now in graduate school, I am doing what I can to prepare myself to be a good mentor and professor. CSD is a great program for developing these skills from program update talks to making lectures for courses to taking workshops for new techniques.\n\nAmy Briggs (she/her) | NIH Diversity Supplement\n\nBS in Biotechnology, California State University San Marcos\n\nDeGregori Lab\n\namy.briggs@cuanschutz.edu\n\nRotation Labs: Eszter Vladar, Melanie Koenigshoff, Xiao-Jing Wang, James DeGregori\n\nResearch: My project is focused on studying the relationship between autophagy and oncogenesis through the decline of tissue maintenance and increase in positive selection of potentially harmful clones in the changing microenvironment. I hope to parse out the mechanism of the role autophagy is playing in this. Tools that I typically use to answer my questions are mouse models coupled with tissue culturing and molecular techniques.\n\nAbout Me: I was born and raised in San Diego, CA and now I have traded the ocean for the mountains! When I am not in lab I enjoy backpacking, biking and reading. I am also involved with SACNAS in the CU Anschutz chapter where I hope to create a lively community and engaging outreach opportunities.\n\nElliott Brooks (he/him)\n\nBS in Biology, University of Oregon\n\nSussel Lab\n\nelliott.brooks@cuanschutz.edu\n\nRotation Labs: Chad Pearson, Lori Sussel, Katie Fantauzzo\n\nResearch: I study how the transcription factor NKX2.2 maintains pancreatic alpha cell identity and how its function differs between alpha and beta cells. By understanding the molecular mechanism of NKX2.2 (ie where it binds DNA, what genes does it transcriptionally regulate, what other proteins it interacts with) I can make conclusions about how identity is maintained but also compare mechanisms between different cell types. During my rotation in Dr. Sussel's lab I was inspired to learn how the same transcription factor can work differently in different cell types. The collaborative environment of CSD and at the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes have been highlights and a continuing force during my time at CU Anschutz.\n\nAbout Me: Being from Oregon stoked my love for the outdoors very early and I have carried on my adventures in the Colorado Rockies. I also have been an active musician and look forward to playing out more as COVID eases up. Grad School is a challenging path and I have found that my labmates, PhD mentor and my partner have all been crucial support allies.\n\nCareer Goals: I started my lab career in the lab of Dr. Charles Kimmel at the UO studying the role of Mef2ca in zebrafish craniofacial development. I continued that research when I came to colorado to help Dr. Jamie Nichols start his zebrafish lab at CU Anschutz. During my graduate studies I would like to master many molecular and in vivo techniques, expand my science communication skills and increase my analytical and bioinformatic toolbox. After my time at CSD I would like to pursuit work in the sciences that allow me to use informatics analysis to further our understanding of biology and the molecular realm. CSD has my back on every aspect of my short and long term goals by providing relevant classes, facilitating mentorship opportunities and cultivating a supportive environment.\n\nJeremy Brown (he/him)\n\nSouthern Arkansas University - Bachelors of Science in Biology\n\nRotating: Emily Bates, Bruce Appel, Jeff Moore\n\nJEREMY.3.BROWN@CUANSCHUTZ.EDU\n\nResearch: My research has focused around molecular, cellular, and developmental biology and overtime, I have developed a passion for regenerative biology. I started as a volunteer research assistant during university as a freshman. For my first assignment, I separated and counted Daphnia, or water fleas, from pond water samples to study population genetics. We studied how the water fleas changed their sex based on environmental cues. My second project was neurodevelopment based and aimed at describing the role of BMP signaling during axonal guidance. We used Drosophila, or the fruit fly, to study motor neurons, axons, and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and specifically how axons are correctly guided to NMJs. I identified non-canonically roles for Mothers against Decapentaplegic, or MAD, during axon development. I published software that I developed to automate the analysis of the data generated from immunohistochemistry experiments performed during this project. After this undergraduate work, I became a professional research assistant. I spent three years identifying genes and pathways that affect the number of cells that survive radiation. From this work, I identified specific timepoints during development during which the removal of cells with DNA damage after irradiation occurs. We published these results along with a new methodology that enabled us to study loss-of-heterozygosity, or LOH. In parallel with the cell survival studies, I studied how cells translocate, transdifferentiate, and regenerate the pouch of the wing after irradiation as a PRA. In this regenerative biology project, I helped perform RNAseq on two populations of cells. One population was the less regenerative notum and pouch cells of the wing disc and the other was the highly regenerative hinge cells. The results of this study were also published. Now, I am looking to learn how to study regenerative biology in more model organisms and from any possible angle of scientific inquiry. I also have a particular interest in looking to automation of research.\n\nAbout Me: I grew up in a small Texas town called Paris. I went to college in another small town but this time in Arkansas where I met my wife, Su Ann. After college, I got a job at CU Boulder working for Dr. Tin Tin Su and I moved to Allenspark which is right outside of Rocky Mountain National Park. During that time, I enjoyed volunteering as a firefighter. In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, hanging out with my dogs, hiking, snowboarding, and Jiu Jitsu.\n\nCareer Goals: To advance regenerative biology and to start my own biotechnology company.\n\nJudy Cheng (she/her)\n\nBA in Molecular Biology, Colorado College\n\nReis Lab\n\nyuzhu.cheng@cuanschutz.edu\n\nRotation Labs: Charles Sagerstrom, Tânia Reis, Bruce Appel\n\nResearch: Reis's lab is interested in studying the genetic and cellular mechanisms of obesity and neuronal controls of metabolism. My project focuses on a gene called Arc1 and its role in regulating fat metabolisms at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Previous work from the lab identified Arc1 to promote lean phenotype in drosophila larvae. Recently, progress in the field revealed that Arc1 could traffic its own transcript by capsid formation. Following up on these, I will explore the regulation of Arc1 between the brain and fat body and how that modulates metabolic phenotypes using the Drosophila model.\n\nAbout Me: I was born in Tianjin China, grew up in Suzhou China until the end of primary school. After that, I studied in international schools in Singapore for six years prior to coming to the U.S. I attended Colorado College for my undergraduate study, where I acquired my passion for developmental and RNA biology. I like to sketch random things or go out for a walk or hike in my free time.\n\nCareer Goals: I majored in Molecular Biology and minored in Biochemistry during my undergraduate study in Colorado College. At this point of time, I do not have a firm idea of my career. Yet, I would like to continue research career.\n\nDevon \"Koya\" Lumbao-Conradson (he/him)\n\nB.A. Biochemistry/Molecular Biology, Lewis & Clark College\n\nVagnozzi Lab\n\ndevon.conradson@cuanschutz.edu\n\nRotation Labs: Jamie Nichols, Linda Barlow, and Ronald Vagnozzi\n\nResearch: There are two immune responses to injury: the pathological one and the therapeutic one. An imbalance between these two can have adverse effects. For example, favoring the pathological response over the therapeutic one can lead to an excess buildup of scar tissue around a wound. When this happens in the heart, it can lead to cardiac fibrosis which restricts the hearts proper beating and can lead to death and other adverse symptoms. Hence, research into controlling the two immune responses is crucial to curing diseases like cardiac fibrosis. My research aims to understand the role that the CX3CR1 receptor plays in these two immune responses within the cardiac setting. My research utilizes in vivo mouse models as well as in vitro cell culture systems.\n\nAbout Me: I've moved around a lot throughout my life. I grew up in Los Alamos, New Mexico, then moved to France with my folks my senior year of high school. I then went to Lewis and Clark College in Portland, OR and earned my Bachelor of Arts in biochemistry and molecular biology. Most of my undergraduate training and lab experience took place in labs that focused on structural biochemistry including Stanford and SLAC/LCLS. After college, I moved to the Bay Area where I worked in the Xinnan Wang lab in Stanford's Neurosurgery department as a PRA for two years before attending graduate school. My folks and I owned rats as pets since I was 10 years old, but the pet I want most now is a ferret.\n\nCareer Goals: At the moment, I'm leaning towards a career in academia; but the future is still wide open. I know that I want to continue doing research in labs that focus on regenerative medicine, but which setting that'll happen in—academia or tech—is still on the table. I also intend to continue my work in advocacy and inspiring other POC/QTPOC (Queer/Trans POC) to pursue careers in STEM.\n\nMikaela Follmer (she/her)\n\nBS in Biology & Religious Studies, Susquehanna University\n\nBates Lab\n\nmikaela.follmer@cuanschutz.edu\n\nRotation Labs: Kristin Artinger, Emily Bates, Richard Benninger\n\nAbout Me: I’m originally from a small town in Pennsylvania (think public high school 40 person graduating class small). I attended Susquehanna University for my bachelors degree in Biology with a second major in Religious Studies, my areas of focus were Developmental Biology and Eastern Religions. After graduating I moved to State College, PA and worked as a research technologist in the Lindner Lab at Penn State. There I studied malaria and cared for a few thousand mosquitoes for the lab. When I’m not thinking about science I spend my time mountain biking, backpacking, and playing with my cat- Dr. Anthony Meowci.\n\nCareer Goals: I’ve always been passionate about science and political issues, because of this choosing a career was challenging, until I discovered science policy. My ultimate goal is to use my understanding of scientific research to influence policy decisions and create a better relationship between important scientific work and public comprehension.\n\nMaria Hansen (she/her)\n\nBS in Biology, MS in Human Biology, University of Copenhagen\n\nSussel Lab\n\nmaria.hansen@cuanschutz.edu\n\nRotation Labs: James DeGregori, Richard Benninger, Lori Sussel\n\nResearch: My main passion is type 1 diabetes research. In the Sussel lab, we are interested in understanding the transcriptional networks regulating pancreatic development and function. Using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) as a model system, I study the function of Groucho co-repressors during human pancreatic development. Additionally, I’m interested in understanding the autoimmune attack of the pancreatic beta cells in type 1 diabetes. I utilize a combination of short-read and long-read RNA sequencing to identify splice variants of beta cell genes, which could potentially give rise to neo-epitopes in the type 1 diabetic pancreas.\n\nAbout me: I am originally from Denmark but moved to Colorado in 2018. I immediately fell in love with the mountains, and I now spend most of my spare time climbing and hiking. I have become somewhat obsessed with climbing 14ers, and I hope to climb all of them over the next couple of years. I am type 1 diabetic myself, which adds an additional layer of complexity to outdoor adventures. I would love to someday work on increasing accessibility to the outdoors (especially mountaineering) for people with chronic diseases.\n\nCareer goals: I earned my bachelor’s degree in biology and my master’s degree in human biology at University of Copenhagen. I wrote my master’s thesis in the Serup lab at Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology, where I worked on characterizing the pancreatic progenitor stage during directed differentiation of hESCs into pancreatic beta cells. I moved to Colorado and joined the Russ lab at Anschutz in 2018, where I continued to work on the generation of stem cell-derived beta-like cells.\n\nIn addition to understanding the transcriptional programs driving pancreatic development, and understanding the autoimmune pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, I am passionate about scientific communication. During graduate school, I hope to improve my scientific communication skills and learn how to convey complex scientific information to a much broader audience. I am a firm believer that we need to narrow the gap between scientists and society in order to build public trust in science.\n\nHannah Jones (she/her) NIH F31 Fellowship\n\nBS Molecular and Cellular Biology, Johns Hopkins University\n\nSiegenthaler Lab\n\nhannah.e.jones@cuanschutz.edu\n\nRotation Labs: Julie Siegenthaler, Chad Pearson, Linda Barlow\n\nResearch: I am fascinated by the mechanisms underlying development of the vasculature in the central nervous system (CNS) and the associated cell types that create a unique niche within the brain. My project in the Siegenthaler Lab focuses on characterizing a subset of fibroblasts that reside on CNS vasculature called perivascular fibroblasts (PVFs). Following CNS injury, PVFs contribute to fibrotic scar formation and secrete factors that coordinate regeneration. However, the developmental origins and homeostatic functions of PVFs are unknown. My goal is to identify the mechanisms underlying recruitment of PVFs to the vasculature during development and use this knowledge to create model systems to study their role in CNS homeostasis and after injury.\n\nAbout Me: I’m an East-coast transplant; I do miss the ocean, but I can’t complain about Colorado’s majestic mountains! In my spare time you can find me skiing, biking, rock climbing, or hiking. I also enjoy cooking delicious meals, trying new beer, cross-stitching, listening to podcasts, and spending quality time with my partner, Mark, and our cat, Juniper. Beyond lab and my hobbies, I participate in science outreach by volunteering with the Denver Metro Regional Science & Engineering Fair and coordinating outreach activities with Project Bridge.\n\nCareer Goals: My ultimate goal is to become a research professor with my own lab and with my own students to teach and mentor. CSD has done a great job in preparing me for this! Within the program, there are multiple opportunities to teach and be involved with mentorship. I’ve developed lectures for CSD courses, I’m a student representative on the CSD curriculum committee, and I am a co-director of the student-run Journal Club. I’ve also had the opportunity to mentor undergraduate & master’s students within my lab and gain formal mentorship training through CSD’s Developing Scholars program. With the support of the program, my thesis mentor, and my thesis committee, I feel thoroughly prepared for the next stop in my career-- obtaining a postdoc position!\n\nHannah Moran (she/her) | T32 Appointee\n\nBS in Molecular and Cellular Biology, BA in Biochemistry, University of Arizona\n\nMosimann Lab\n\nhannah.moran@cuanschutz.edu\n\nRotation Labs: Emily Bates, Katie Fantauzzo, Christian Mosimann\n\nResearch: In the Mosimann lab, I investigate early heart development and cell fate commitment to cardiac lineages from the uncommitted mesoderm in zebrafish. My project focuses on how different structures of the vertebrate heart acquire their fates and where their progenitor populations come from, and how these processes can go wrong in congenital disease. My favorite resources within CSD are the training courses in grant writing and critical analysis of literature. Grant writing can be intimidating, but having a strong foundation and ample resources gained from these courses makes the process much more approachable and less nerve-wracking. I love that CSD gives me the opportunity to explore my research passions while also supporting my personal and professional goals.\n\nAbout Me: When I'm not in the lab, I love to go hiking and camping, as well as explore the breweries that Colorado has to offer. I am originally from Arizona, so I love experiencing all the seasons while still soaking in lots of sunshine! My cohort has been the best support system ever since interview weekend. Going through classes and rotations together was challenging, but being able to lean on each other made the transition to graduate school much easier. I serve on the Student Executive Committee as a part of CSD Voices, which allows students to communicate feedback to the program provides students with a way to express their questions or concerns whenever they arise. Additionally, I work with the Denver Metro Regional Science and Engineering Fair on the Mentorship and Outreach Team to make the science fair accessible and exciting for students of all backgrounds in the Denver area.\n\nCareer Goals: I received by Bachelors of Science in Molecular and Cellular Biology and my Bachelors of Arts in Biochemistry at the University of Arizona. I transitioned straight from undergrad to graduate school, but took time to travel before I started in the CSD program. My goal in graduate school is to expand our current understanding of the biological processes that contribute to congenital diseases, while also gaining skills in mentorship, grant writing and outreach to continue my path to becoming a fully independent scientist. I am extremely passionate about improving the landscape of academia for both current and future academics, and I am grateful that CSD supports me in these endeavors through both courses and personal and professional support.\n\nAbi Mumme-Monheit (she/her) | NSF GRFP\n\nBS in Biology, Haverford College\n\nNichols Lab\n\nABIGAIL.MUMME-MONHEIT@CUANSCHUTZ.EDU\n\nRotation Labs: Matthew Taylor & Luisa Mestroni, Jamie Nichols, Paul Norman\n\nResearch: MEF2C Haploinsufficiency Syndrome is a human disorder characterized by craniofacial phenotypes. This disorder also displays incomplete penetrance, meaning that some individuals with deleterious mutations exhibit phenotypes while others do not. I am using a zebrafish model to study incomplete penetrance in this disorder. The zebrafish gene mef2ca is orthologous to MEF2C and when mutated results in craniofacial phenotypes. Specifically, I am investigating whether paralogs of mef2ca are compensating for mef2ca loss, resulting in incomplete penetrance of disease phenotypes.\n\nAbout Me: I grew up in MA, just outside of Boston. I went to Haverford College in PA for undergraduate, where I fostered my love for research in labs studying sea anemones and corn genetics. Since moving here I have fallen in love with the mountains. Outside of lab I can be found running, hiking, rock climbing, and mountain biking. I also spend a lot of time thinking about how to make fitness accessible to everyone. I coach functional fitness classes at Colorado Fitness and Strength; specifically, I am passionate about coaching an inclusive fitness class for LGBTQ+ youth there.\n\nCareer Goals: I hope to continue research after getting my PhD with a particular focus on human genetic disorders. I am leaving my options open as to where I would like to continue my research. However, I love doing research in the context of medicine, and would like to be involved in the translational research pipeline. I hope to emphasize communication to the public in whatever realm of research I pursue.\n\nKyle Northington (he/him) | NSF GRFP Honorable Mention; T32 Appointee\n\nBS Biological Sciences, Molecular and Cellular Biology Concentration\n\nBates Lab\n\nkyle.northington@cuanschutz.edu\n\nRotation Labs: Emily Bates, Julie Siegenthaler, Kelly Sullivan\n\nAbout Me: Hi, my name is Kyle and I am originally from California! I grew up in a really small town near Yosemite where I had amazing access to hiking and skiing. I moved to San Diego for college where I fell in love with biology. When I'm not in lab I love to go to the movies and visit the Denver Botanic Gardens. I am also involved with the LGBTQ+ Hub on the Anschutz campus, where I meet monthly for the Governance and Leadership Committee to provide input on the Hub's operations and planned activities.\n\nResearch: I research the role of the microtubule cytoskeleton in brain development. I am specifically interested in how microtubules inside of neurons are controlled when exposed to developmental guidance cues. Our floor has two incredible confocal microscopes that make imaging neurons both exciting and fun! With two of these microscopes it is so much easier to find time to image your samples. My original interest was in neuroscience, but after rotating in Dr. Emily Bates' lab I was introduced to developmental biology. Now in my project I can combine my love for the brain with developmental and cellular biology.\n\nCareer Goals: I'm still thinking hard about my career goals! During my undergraduate education I worked for a year at Thermo Fisher Scientific in Carlsbad, CA. This was great exposure to a career in biotech, and I could see myself returning to that field. However, I do love bench science and mentoring students so I could envision myself as a PI at a primarily undergraduate institution. While we don't have undergraduate students on this campus CSD does offer unique teaching opportunities for students, and during the summer we bring undergraduate students into labs where we can get mentorship opportunities.\n\nOmar Ochoa Olmos (he/him)\n\nBS Biology, MS Biochemistry, National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM)\n\nBrzezinski Lab\n\nomar.ochoaolmos@cuanschutz.edu\n\nAbout Me: I am originally from Mexico City and my native language is Spanish. I graduated from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) with a BS in Biology in 2008, and later earned a MS in Biochemistry in 2012. Initially, I collaborated with Dr. Elena Basiuk and Dr. Tzvetanka Drimitrova developing novel DNA-delivery technologies based on carbon nanotubes to improve plant cell transformation. Before starting my PhD studies, I received teaching training in Japan at the Japan Foundation Japanese-Language Institute, Urawa. After returning to Mexico, I became a science and language instructor at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education.\n\nResearch Goals: In 2020, I joined the Brzezinski Lab to investigate the gene regulatory network involved in cone photoreceptor specification using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies in the mouse and retinal human organoid models. My goal is to provide new insights on how to treat retinal degenerative diseases that cause color blindness by instructing progenitor cells to adopt cone identity and potentiate the production of cones.\n\nTina Piarowski (she/her) | NSF-GRFP Honorable Mention; Past T32 appointee; NIH F31 Fellowship\n\nBS Genetics, Cellular and Developmental Biology, Arizona State University\n\nBarlow Lab\n\nchristina.piarowski@cuanschutz.edu\n\nRotation Labs: Linda Barlow, Melanie Koenigshoff, Sujatha Jagannathan\n\nResearch: My research focuses on the role of receptor tyrosine kinases in the taste system, particularly the role of c-Kit it sweet-sensing cells. Using lingual organoids as a model system I found that inhibiting c-Kit leads to a decrease in sweet cell markers. This lead me to my hypothesis that c-Kit is necessary for the differentiation or survival of sweet sensing cells. My thesis work will aim to unravel this relationship using a combination of in vitro organoid models and in vivo work. I was inspired to join the Barlow lab because the sense of taste is central to the human experience, and understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating taste could help improve the quality of life of people who have lost their sense of taste due to disease or drug treatments.\n\nAbout Me: In my free time I enjoy hiking, biking, figure skating and hanging out with my cat. I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago before moving to Phoenix for college. After graduating I moved to Denver for graduate school in the CSD program, where I have grown close with my classmates and colleagues. Like many others in CSD, I prioritize work/life balance and usually spend my weekends relaxing or exploring Colorado!\n\nCareer Goals: I attended Arizona State University for my undergraduate degree, where I majored in Genetics, Cellular and Developmental Biology with minors in French and Global Health. I took a gap semester after graduating to work as a PRA, which was a great reset that re-energized me before heading to graduate school. During graduate school my goals are to get practice presenting my work to different audiences as well as gain experience mentoring students at the bench. CSD offers many opportunities for students to teach and present, and I also worked with our program director Jeff Moore to create the Developing Scholars mentorship program. I'm very excited about all the opportunities within CSD that can prepare students for a wide variety of careers.\n\nIan Purvis (he/him)\n\nBS in Natural Sciences, Xavier University\n\nBrzezinski Lab\n\nian.purvis@cuanschutz.edu\n\nRotation Labs: Ethan Hughes, Rajeev Vibhakar, Joe Brzezinski\n\nResearch Statement: In the Brzezinski lab, I am researching vertebrate retinal development. Specifically, I am using the mouse retina as a model to understand how Otx2, a gene necessary for retinal development, is regulated during the development and maturation of different cell types within the retina. Using in vivo and ex vivo models along with CRISPR technology, I am teasing out mechanisms mediated by non-coding regions of DNA that regulate the expression of this gene across the developing retina.\n\nAbout Me: Originally from Peoria, IL, I received my Bachelor’s of Science from Xavier University. I then worked for 2 years at the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Peoria conducting research on the progression of brain tumors. While in the CSD program, I plan on improving my skills communicating scientific data and conclusions, enhancing my analytical skills while gaining more experience mentoring students.\n\nAddison Rains (she/her) | T32 Appointee\n\nBS in Biology, Birmingham - Southern College\n\nArtinger Lab\n\naddison.rains@cuanschutz.edu\n\nRotation Labs: Macklin, Prekeris, Artinger\n\nResearch: I am interested in the intersection of cell biology and developmental biology. I study mechanisms of cell migration and fate acquisition of neural crest cells in the zebrafish model. Neural crest cells are a highly migratory population of developmental stem cells responsible for giving rise to many cell types, including nerves and glia of the peripheral nervous system. My project is focused on understanding how neural crest cells migrate to and differentiate into cells of the peripheral nervous system.\n\nAbout Me: I was born and raised in a small Alabama town. I earned my BS in Biology from Birmingham-Southern College, where I first discovered my passion for research. In undergrad, I studied membrane trafficking mechanisms in fission yeast, during this time I became fascinated with utilizing fluorescent microscopy to probe questions of cellular dynamics. After graduation, I worked for four years as a technician at UAB. It was there I developed a love for developmental biology. Outside of research, I am an avid crafter and enjoy spending my free time knitting, crocheting, or beading. I am a big music lover, I take any opportunity I can to catch a show at Red Rocks, or attend a music festival.\n\nCareer Goals: I intend to pursue a career as a professor at a primarily undergraduate institution where I can create a small independent research program, and share the joy of research with new generations of young scientists.\n\nWolf Schleicher (he/him) | T32 Appointee\n\nBS in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and Neuroscience\n\nPietras & DeGregori Labs\n\nwolfgang.schleicher@cuanschutz.edu\n\nRotation Labs: James DeGregori, Eric Pietras, Kunhua Song\n\nResearch: My initial research project aims to understand whether and how metabolism and the NLRP3/IL-1beta axis are linked to facilitate selective hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) expansion in clonal hematopoiesis. Tet2- and Dnmt3a-deficiency are the two most common mutations in clonal hematopoiesis, and they result in similar phenotypes of selective HSPC expansion. Previous work in the Pietras Lab has identified a potential link between these two cellular processes in Tet2-deficient mice, so my current work will explore this same link in Dnmt3a-deficient mice.\n\nAbout Me: I consider myself to be a bit of a pop-culture geek, so many of my interests outside of the lab involve playing tabletop games with friends, marathoning Tolkien and Marvel movies, and volunteering with local conventions (when time allows). However, as I've lived in Colorado my whole life, I also love hiking and camping in the mountains. My support system through graduate school is mainly comprised of close friends (with which I play the aforementioned games) and my significant other. As such, I try to maintain a good work/life balance to afford me time with the people I care about, but some weeks are more successful than others. Currently I am not involved in any school/community activities, but as I transition into my second year, I will hopefully get more engaged with CSD program activities.\n\nCareer Goals: My research interests are in stem cell biology and aging, and how these focuses provide a unique perspective of regenerative medicine. As such, my goals during graduate school are to develop an expertise in stem cell biology and aging-associated morbidity. While my current goal after graduate school is to pursue a leadership position in the biotech industry, I may also pursue a career in the academic setting. The diversity of training faculty in CSD provides me the opportunity to receive mentorship that will cater to these career goals, preparing me for either industry or academia. Moreover, CSD workshops, journal clubs, and seminars provide opportunities to collaboratively develop skills, ideas, and interests to help shape my PhD training.\n\nSusannah Schloss (she/her)\n\nBA in Psychology, BS in Neuroscience\n\nRotating: Jamie Nichols, Charles Sagerstrom, Jess Nelson\n\nSUSANNAH.SCHLOSS@CUANSCHUTZ.EDU\n\nResearch: My undergraduate research focused on the cellular mechanisms of hearing loss in zebrafish, where I focused specifically on the mechanisms behind hair cell regeneration. I'm interested in studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative disease, specifically multiple sclerosis, but would like to learn more about cellular biology and development.\n\nAbout Me: I grew up in Miami, Florida and received a B.A. in Psychology from Flagler College in St. Augustine. During this degree, I realized I wanted to delve more into science, so I moved to Vancouver, Washington and got another Bachelors degree in Neuroscience, along with some undergraduate research experience. Outside of the lab, I enjoy reading all kinds of literature, from scientific to fantasy, as well as dabbling in cooking meals from around the world.\n\nCareer Goals: My ultimate goal is to work with a company or organization where I can research multiple sclerosis in some capacity. Ideally, I would like to be involved in developing treatments or improving existing stem cell therapies.\n\nKaleigh Schuler (she/her)\n\nBachelor's of Science Biology - Neurobiology\n\nRotating: Chad Pearson, Lori Sussel, David Clouthier\n\nResearch: I'm interested in the signaling mechanisms necessary for development (cell specification, migration, polarity, etc) from signal induction to downstream effects, particularly transcription factor binding.\n\nAbout Me: I received my bachelor's at the University of Texas at Austin, after which I joined Steve Vokes' lab as a technician. It was there that I first fell in love with signaling (specifically Sonic Hedgehog in the early mouse limb bud). I've spent the last 2 years working at the University of Wisconsin Madison under Anne Griep studying PCP signaling factors in neonatal mouse eye lens epithelial cells.\n\nCareer Goals: I would love to either tackle a new signaling pathway in development during my PhD, or explore primary cilia dynamics and mechanisms. Beyond graduate school, I want to pursue a postdoc position and eventually become a professor. That said, I'm determined to explore a wide array of career paths over the course of my graduate training to be sure I'm choosing a career trajectory that best suits me.\n\nAmanda Stenzel (she/her)\n\nBS in Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Wisconsin-La Crosse\n\nRotating: Stephen Santoro, Linda Barlow, Jess Nelson\n\nAMANDA.STENZEL@CUANSCHUTZ.EDU\n\nResearch: During my undergraduate studies, I investigated how triclosan affects metamorphosis and reproductive fitness in zebrafish. After graduating I got a job working as a research technician in the Nichols lab at CU Anschutz where I studied the role her9 plays in craniofacial patterning and development, and bone ossification. My research interests include anything and everything related to developmental biology and molecular genetics.\n\nAbout Me: I am originally from Minnesota but in the middle of the 2020 COVID pandemic I decided I wanted a change of scenery and moved out to Colorado. I have loved living in Colorado, even though I miss all the lakes in Minnesota from time to time. In my free time I enjoy hiking with my dog, skiing, rock climbing, and playing piano.\n\nCareer Goals: I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Wisconsin- La Crosse where I had so many AMAZING professors who helped me pursue my passion for science. It was because of this experience that I decided to pursue a graduate degree in biology.
