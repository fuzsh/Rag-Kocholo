In this study, we introduce the Death and Dying Distress Scale (DADDS), a new, brief measure we have developed to assess death-related anxiety in advanced cancer and other palliative populations. We describe its preliminary psychometrics based on a sample of 33 patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. The DADDS broadly captures distress about the loss of time and opportunity, the process of death and dying, and its impact on others. The initial version of the scale has a one-factor structure and good internal reliability. Dying and death-related distress was positively associated with depression and negatively associated with spiritual, emotional, physical, and functional well-being, providing early evidence of construct validity. This distress was relatively common, with 45% of the sample scoring in the upper reaches of the scale, suggesting that the DADDS may be a relevant outcome for palliative intervention. We conclude by presenting a revised 15-item version of the scale for further study in advanced cancer and other palliative populations.\n\nOlder Patients With Early-stage Breast Cancer: Adjuvant Radiation Therapy and Predictive Factors for Cancer-related Death.\n\nPubMed\n\nNagar, Himanshu; Yan, Weisi; Christos, Paul; Chao, K S Clifford; Nori, Dattatreyudu; Ravi, Akkamma\n\n2017-06-01\n\nStudies have shown that older women are undertreated for breast cancer. Few data are available on cancer-related death in elderly women aged 70 years and older with pathologic stage T1a-b N0 breast cancer and the impact of prognostic factors on cancer-related death. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried for women aged 70 years or above diagnosed with pT1a or pT1b, N0 breast cancer who underwent breast conservation surgery from 1999 to 2003. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to evaluate breast cause-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS), and the log-rank test was employed to compare CSS/OS between different groups of interest. Multivariable analysis (MVA), using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, was performed to evaluate the independent effect of age, race, stage, grade, ER status, and radiation treatment on CSS. Adjusted hazard ratios were calculated from the MVA and reflect the increased risk of breast cancer death. Competing-risks survival regression was also performed to adjust the univariate and multivariable CSS hazard ratios for the competing event of death due to causes other than breast cancer. Patients aged 85 and above had a greater risk of breast cancer death compared with patients aged 70 to 74 years (referent category) (adjusted hazard ratio [HRs]=1.98). Race had no effect on CSS. Patients with stage T1bN0 breast cancer had a greater risk of breast cancer death compared with stage T1aN0 patients (adjusted HR=1.35; P=0.09). ER negative patients had a greater risk of breast cancer death compared with ER positive patients (adjusted HR=1.59; P<0.017). Patients with higher grade tumors had a greater risk of breast cancer death compared with patients with grade 1 tumors (referent category) (adjusted HRs=1.69 and 2.96 for grade 2 and 3, respectively). Patients who underwent radiation therapy had a lower risk of breast cancer death compared with patients who did not (adjusted HR=0\n\nRelative Risks for Lethal Prostate Cancer Based on Complete Family History of Prostate Cancer Death.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlbright, Frederick S; Stephenson, Robert A; Agarwal, Neeraj; Cannon-Albright, Lisa A\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThere are few published familial relative risks (RR) for lethal prostate cancer. This study estimates RRs for lethal prostate cancer based on comprehensive family history data, with the goal of improving identification of those men at highest risk of dying from prostate cancer. We used a population-based genealogical resource linked to a statewide electronic SEER cancer registry and death certificates to estimate relative risks (RR) for death from prostate cancer based upon family history. Over 600,000 male probands were analyzed, representing a variety of family history constellations of lethal prostate cancer. RR estimates were based on the ratio of the observed to the expected number of lethal prostate cancer cases using internal rates. RRs for lethal prostate cancer based on the number of affected first-degree relatives (FDR) ranged from 2.49 (95% CI: 2.27, 2.73) for exactly 1 FDR to 5.30 (2.13, 10.93) for â¥3 affected FDRs. In an absence of affected FDRs, increased risk was also significant for increasing numbers of affected second-degree or third degree relatives. Equivalent risks were observed for similar maternal and paternal family history. This study provides population-based estimates of lethal prostate cancer risk based on lethal prostate cancer family history. Many family history constellations associated with two to greater than five times increased risk for lethal prostate cancer were identified. These lethal prostate cancer risk estimates hold potential for use in identification, screening, early diagnosis, and treatment of men at high risk for death from prostate cancer.

Methods: We included children with cancer â©½18 years diagnosed and treated in Ontario who died between January 2003 and December 2012. Deaths were identified using a provincial registry, the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario Networked Information System. Probable causes of TRM were described. Results: Among the 964 deaths identified, 821 were included. The median age at diagnosis was 6.6 years (range 0â18.8) and 51.8% had at least one relapse. Of the deaths examined, TRM occurred in 217/821 (26.4%) while 604/821 (73.6%) were due to progressive cancer. Deaths from TRM did not change over time. Using multiple regression, younger age, leukaemia diagnosis and absence of relapse were independently positively associated with TRM. The most common probable causes of TRM were respiratory, infection and haemorrhage. Conclusions: TRM was responsible for 26.4% of deaths in paediatric cancer. Underlying diagnosis, younger age and absence of relapse were associated with TRM and causes of TRM differed by diagnosis group. Future work should evaluate TRM rate and risk factors among newly diagnosed cancer patients.

US death certificate data in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Stat 8.2.1 were used to categorize cancer patient death as being due to index-cancer, nonindex-cancer, and noncancer cause from 1973 to 2012. In addition, data were characterized with standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), which provide the relative risk of death compared with all persons. The greatest relative decrease in index-cancer death (generally fromâ>â60% toâ<â30%) was among those with cancers of the testis, kidney, bladder, endometrium, breast, cervix, prostate, ovary, anus, colorectum, melanoma, and lymphoma. Index-cancer deaths were stable (typicallyâ>40%) among patients with cancers of the liver, pancreas, esophagus, and lung, and brain. Noncancer causes of death were highest in patients with cancers of the colorectum, bladder, kidney, endometrium, breast, prostate, testis;â>40% of deaths from heart disease. The highest SMRs were from nonbacterial infections, particularly amongâ<50-year olds (e.g. SMRâ>1,000 for lymphomas, Pâ<â0.001). The highest SMRs were typically within the first year after cancer diagnosis (SMRs 10-10,000, Pâ<â0.001). Prostate cancer patients had increasing SMRs from Alzheimer's disease, as did testicular patients from suicide. The risk of death from index- and nonindex-cancers varies widely among primary sites. Risk of noncancer deaths now surpasses that of cancer deaths, particularly for young patients in the year after diagnosis. Â© The Author 2016.

The distributions of cancer deaths in 485 individuals from 67 families with LS (35, 30, and two families with MutL homologue 1 (MLH1), MSH2, and MSH6 gene mutations, respectively), obtained from the Registry of the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum were analyzed. Among 98 cancer deaths of first-degree relatives of unknown mutation status, 53%, 19%, 13% (among females), 7% (among females) and 5% were due to colorectal, gastric, uterine, ovarian, and hepatobiliary cancer, respectively. The proportion of deaths from extra-colonic cancer was significantly higher in families with MSH2 mutation than in those with MLH1 mutation (p=0.003). In addition to colonic and uterine cancer, management and surveillance targeting gastric, ovarian and hepatobiliary cancer are considered important for Japanese families with LS. Extra-colonic cancer in families with MSH2 mutation might require for more intensive surveillance. CopyrightÂ© 2016 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.

Compared to the general U.S. population, military members have been estimated to have lower incidence rates of several cancers including colorectal, lung, and cervical cancers and higher rates of prostate, breast, and thyroid cancer. Between 2000 and 2011 in active component members of the U.S. military, crude incidence rates of most cancer diagnoses have remained stable. 9,368 active component service members were diagnosed with one of the cancers of interest and no specific increasing or decreasing trends were observed. Cancer is an uncommon cause of death among service members on active duty and accounted for a total of 1,185 deaths during the 12-year surveillance period.\n\nEffects of a randomized gratitude intervention on death-related fear of recurrence in breast cancer survivors.\n\nPubMed\n\nOtto, Amy K; Szczesny, Elana C; Soriano, Emily C; Laurenceau, Jean-Philippe; Siegel, Scott D\n\n2016-12-01\n\nAmong the most prevalent and distressing concerns endorsed by breast cancer survivors is fear of cancer recurrence (FOR), and one of the most salient facets is the worry that a recurrence of cancer could cause one's death. The primary goal of the present study was to test the effects of a brief, low-cost gratitude intervention on overall FOR and death-related FOR, positing pursuit of meaningful goals as a theoretically driven putative mediator. To replicate published tests of similar gratitude-eliciting interventions, positive affect (PA) was also considered as an outcome. Sixty-seven women with early stage breast cancer were randomly assigned to either a 6-week online gratitude intervention or a 6-week online control condition. Outcomes were assessed at pre- and posttreatment, as well as 1 month and 3 months after the end of treatment. The mediator, meaningful goal pursuit, was measured via assessments over the 6-week intervention period. Results revealed that patients in the gratitude intervention experienced a significant decrease in death-related FOR compared to the control condition. Moreover, this effect was significantly mediated by meaningful goal pursuit (and not by PA). The gratitude intervention was also found to prevent declines in PA observed in the control condition. Overall, findings support the notion that a brief gratitude intervention can promote well-being and psychological adaptation to cancer by stimulating the pursuit of meaningful goals and subsequently reducing death-related FOR.

Few studies, however, document the nature of death-related concerns in individuals newly diagnosed with lung cancer. The aims of this exploratory study were to examine unsolicitedâ¦\n\nFactors affecting the death anxiety levels of relatives of cancer patients undergoing treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeydag, Kerime Derya\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis descriptive study was performed to determine levels of the death anxiety levels of relatives of patients who being treated in a public hospital located in the Asian side of Istanbul and influencing factors. The sample was 106 patient relatives of patients from oncology or chemotherapy units of the hospital. Data were collected between May-June 2011 with the 15-item Death Anxiety Scale developed by Templer (1970) and adapted to Turkish by Senol (1989) and evaluated by number-percentage calculations, the Kruskal Wallis, Anova and t tests. Some 36.8% of the included group were aged 45 years and over, 57.5% were female and 65.1% were married. A statistically significant difference was found between the age groups, genders of the patient relatives, the period of cancer treatment regarding the death anxiety levels (p<0.05). The death anxiety levels of the patient relatives who were in the 17-39 age group, female and had a patient who was under treatment for less than 6 months were found to high as compared to others.\n\nProstate cancer, prostate cancer death, and death from other causes, among men with metabolic aberrations.\n\nPubMed\n\nHÃ¤ggstrÃ¶m, Christel; Stocks, Tanja; Nagel, Gabriele; Manjer, Jonas; BjÃ¸rge, Tone; Hallmans, GÃ¶ran; Engeland, Anders; Ulmer, Hanno; Lindkvist, BjÃ¶rn; Selmer, Randi; Concin, Hans; Tretli, Steinar; Jonsson, HÃ¥kan; Stattin, PÃ¤r\n\n2014-11-01\n\nFew previous studies of metabolic aberrations and prostate cancer risk have taken into account the fact that men with metabolic aberrations have an increased risk of death from causes other than prostate cancer. The aim of this study was to calculate, in a real-life scenario, the risk of prostate cancer diagnosis, prostate cancer death, and death from other causes. In the Metabolic Syndrome and Cancer Project, prospective data on body mass index, blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides were collected from 285,040 men. Risks of prostate cancer diagnosis, prostate cancer death, and death from other causes were calculated by use of competing risk analysis for men with normal (bottom 84%) and high (top 16%) levels of each factor, and a composite score. During a mean follow-up period of 12 years, 5,893 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, 1,013 died of prostate cancer, and 26,328 died of other causes. After 1996, when prostate-specific antigen testing was introduced, men up to age 80 years with normal metabolic levels had 13% risk of prostate cancer, 2% risk of prostate cancer death, and 30% risk of death from other causes, whereas men with metabolic aberrations had corresponding risks of 11%, 2%, and 44%. In contrast to recent studies using conventional survival analysis, in a real-world scenario taking risk of competing events into account, men with metabolic aberrations had lower risk of prostate cancer diagnosis, similar risk of prostate cancer death, and substantially higher risk of death from other causes compared with men who had normal metabolic levels.\n\nTreatment-related Death in Cancer Patients Treated with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdel-Rahman, O; Helbling, D; Schmidt, J; Petrausch, U; Giryes, A; Mehrabi, A; SchÃ¶b, O; Mannhart, M; Oweira, H\n\n2017-04-01\n\nWe carried out a meta-analysis to determine the risk of treatment-related death associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor use in cancer patients. We examined data from the Medline and Google Scholar databases. We also examined original studies and review articles for cross-references. Eligible studies included randomised phase II and phase III trials of patients with cancer treated with ipilimumab, pembrolizumab; nivolumab; tremelimumab and atezolizumab. The authors extracted relevant information on participants, characteristics, treatment-related death and information on the methodology of the studies. After exclusion of ineligible records, 18 clinical trials were included in the analysis. The odds ratio for treatment-related death for CTLA-4 inhibitors (ipilimumab and tremelimumab) was 1.80 (95% confidence interval 1.25, 2.59; P=0.002) and for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab) was 0.63 (95% confidence interval 0.31, 1.30; P=0.22). Treated cancer seems to have no effect on the risk of treatment-related death. Analysis of our data showed that CTLA-4 inhibitors (ipilimumab and tremelimumab) in a higher dose (10Â mg/kg) seem to be associated with a higher risk of treatment-related death compared with control regimens, whereas PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab) do not cause the same risk. Clinicians have to be fully aware of these differential risks and council their patients appropriately. Copyright Â© 2016 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate the psychometric properties of the German version of the Death and Dying Distress Scale (DADDS-G) in advanced cancer patients. We recruited advanced patients with mixed tumor entities (Union for International Cancer Control [UICC] Stage III/IV) treated in two German University Medical Centers during their outpatient treatment. After testing a preliminary version of the state-of-the-art translated original Death and Dying Distress Scale, we analyzed the psychometric properties of the shortened nine-item adapted DADDS-G using validated instruments measuring distress, anxiety, depression, fear of progression, and quality of life. We obtained complete questionnaires from 77 of 93 patients with advanced cancer (response rate: 83%). Participants were mostly married or cohabiting (75%), well-educated, and both sexes were almost equally represented (52% men; mean age 58Â years, SDÂ =Â 12). The total mean DADDS-G score was 13.3 (SDÂ =Â 8.5). Patients reported to be most distressed by the feeling of being a burden to others. The exploratory factor analysis led to one factor that accounted for more than 59% of the variance. The DADDS-G's internal consistency was excellent with Cronbach alphaÂ =Â 0.91. The confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a very good model fit. Death-related anxiety was significantly associated with distress, depression, anxiety, fear of progression, and lower quality of life (PÂ <Â 0.001). Results provide further evidence that the DADDS-G is a valid and reliable instrument of high clinical relevance for use in patients with advanced cancer.

The present study further investigated additional determinants for cancer and non-cancer death in the cohort after a follow-up of 17 years. Methods A cohort of 92546 diabetes patients recruited since 1995 was followed for vital status by matching the National Death Certificate Database until 2011. Cox regression estimated the hazard ratios for the following variables: age at baseline, sex, diabetes type, screen-detected diabetes (diabetes diagnosed accidentally through epidemiological screening programs or during visits to medical settings without a history of diabetes), diabetes duration, body mass index, insulin use, hypertension, smoking, and living region. Fasting glucose and history of dyslipidemia were available for additional adjustment in a subcohort of the patients (n = 14559). Results A total of 40229 diabetes patients (43.5% of the cohort) died during follow-up and 10.9% died under the age of 60. Insulin use and smoking significantly predicted cancer and non-cancer death. The adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) associated with insulin use was 1.161 (1.052â1.281) for cancer death and 1.469 (1.413â1.526) for non-cancer death. Screen-detected diabetes and body mass index were consistently associated with a lower risk, but diabetes duration a higher risk, for non-cancer death, with adjusted hazard ratio of 0.683 (0.666â0.702), 0.955 (0.951â0.958) and 1.018 (1.017â1.020), respectively. Diabetes type had a null association disregarding the causes of death and living in rural areas was significantly associated with a higher mortality from non-cancer death. Hypertension, fasting glucose and dyslipidemia showed differential impacts on cancer and non-cancer death, and were significantly predictive for non-cancer death. Conclusions Screen-detected diabetes and a higher body mass index provide a survival\n\nLung cancer death rates fall, helping drive decrease in overall cancer death rates\n\nCancer.gov\n\nThe Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, covering the period 1975â2010, showed death rates for lung cancer, which accounts for more than one in four cancer deaths, dropping at a faster pace than in previous years.\n\nDrinking water treatment and risk of cancer death in Wisconsin.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKanarek, M S; Young, T B\n\n1982-01-01\n\nA case control study of drinking water treatment practices and female cancer mortality was conducted in Wisconsin. Cancer deaths for 1972-1977 from 28 Wisconsin counties and noncancer deaths matched to cancer deaths on age, year of death and county of residence, were compared for characteristics of drinking water supplied to their places of residence. Using logistic regression, estimates of relative risk associated with chlorinated water were examined allowing for the influence of indicators of water organics and the potential confounders of occupation, marital status and urbanicity. Only colon cancer appeared to be related significantly to chlorination in all models explored. A dose-response relationship was found between crude indicators of trihalomethane level (chlorination X organic contamination) and colon cancer death. The odds ratio for chlorinated surface water for colon cancer was 2.81 (p less than 0.01); approximately half this risk was found for chlorinated ground water. Consequently, a case control study of colon cancer and drinking water quality utilizing newly diagnosed patients is being conducted in Wisconsin.

This scenario was evaluated in cancer survivors (>5 years) registered within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. The SEER database was queried using SEER*Stat to determine the frequency of cardiac death compared to other causes of death; and to determine heart disease-specific and cancer-specific survival rates in survivors of each of the 10 most common cancers in men and women in the SEER database. For cancer-specific survival rate, the highest rates were related to thyroid cancer survivors; while the lowest rates were related to lung cancer survivors. For heart disease-specific survival rate, the highest rates were related to thyroid cancer survivors; while the lowest rates were related to both lung cancer survivors and urinary bladder cancer survivors. The following factors were associated with a higher likelihood of cardiac death: male gender, old age at diagnosis, black race and local treatment with radiotherapy rather than surgery (P < 0.0001 for all parameters). Among cancer survivors (>5 years), cardiac death is a significant cause of death and there is a wide variability among different cancers in the relative importance of cardiac death vs. cancer-related death.\n\nDeclining death rates reflect progress against cancer.\n\nPubMed\n\nJemal, Ahmedin; Ward, Elizabeth; Thun, Michael\n\n2010-03-09\n\nThe success of the \"war on cancer\" initiated in 1971 continues to be debated, with trends in cancer mortality variably presented as evidence of progress or failure. We examined temporal trends in death rates from all-cancer and the 19 most common cancers in the United States from 1970-2006. We analyzed trends in age-standardized death rates (per 100,000) for all cancers combined, the four most common cancers, and 15 other sites from 1970-2006 in the United States using joinpoint regression model. The age-standardized death rate for all-cancers combined in men increased from 249.3 in 1970 to 279.8 in 1990, and then decreased to 221.1 in 2006, yielding a net decline of 21% and 11% from the 1990 and 1970 rates, respectively. Similarly, the all-cancer death rate in women increased from 163.0 in 1970 to 175.3 in 1991 and then decreased to 153.7 in 2006, a net decline of 12% and 6% from the 1991 and 1970 rates, respectively. These decreases since 1990/91 translate to preventing of 561,400 cancer deaths in men and 205,700 deaths in women. The decrease in death rates from all-cancers involved all ages and racial/ethnic groups. Death rates decreased for 15 of the 19 cancer sites, including the four major cancers, with lung, colorectum and prostate cancers in men and breast and colorectum cancers in women. Progress in reducing cancer death rates is evident whether measured against baseline rates in 1970 or in 1990. The downturn in cancer death rates since 1990 result mostly from reductions in tobacco use, increased screening allowing early detection of several cancers, and modest to large improvements in treatment for specific cancers. Continued and increased investment in cancer prevention and control, access to high quality health care, and research could accelerate this progress.\n\nAssociation of sense of coherence and supernatural beliefs with death anxiety and death depression among Romanian cancer patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nPostolicÄ, Roxana; Enea, Violeta; Dafinoiu, Ion; Petrov, Iuliana; AzoicÄi, Doina\n\n2018-02-02\n\nThe aim of this cross-sectional study was to examine the association of supernatural beliefs and sense of coherence with death anxiety and death depression in a Romanian sample of cancer patients. We found support for the terror management theory worldview defence hypothesis postulating the presence of a curvilinear relation between death anxiety and supernatural beliefs among cancer patients. Results conformed to an inverted U-shape quadratic regression, indicating that cancer patients who scored moderately on supernatural beliefs were afraid of death the most, while death anxiety was lowest for the extreme atheists and extreme believers in supernatural entities.\n\nUsing natural products to promote caspase-8-dependent cancer cell death.\n\nPubMed\n\nTewary, Poonam; Gunatilaka, A A Leslie; Sayers, Thomas J\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe selective killing of cancer cells without toxicity to normal nontransformed cells is an idealized goal of cancer therapy. Thus, there has been much interest in tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a protein that appears to selectively kill cancer cells. TRAIL has been reported to trigger apoptosis and under some circumstances, an alternate death signaling pathway termed necroptosis. The relative importance of necroptosis for cell death induction in vivo is under intensive investigation. Nonetheless, many cancer cells (particularly those freshly isolated from cancer patients) are highly resistant to TRAIL-mediated cell death. Therefore, there is an underlying interest in identifying agents that can be combined with TRAIL to improve its efficacy. There are numerous reports in which combination of TRAIL with standard antineoplastic drugs has resulted in enhanced cancer cell death in vitro. However, many of these chemotherapeutic drugs are nonspecific and associated with adverse effects, which raise serious concerns for cancer therapy in patients. By contrast, natural products have been shown to be safer and efficacious alternatives. Recently, a number of studies have suggested that certain natural products when combined with TRAIL can enhance cancer cell death. In this review, we highlight molecular pathways that might be targeted by various natural products to promote cell death, and focus on our recent work with withanolides as TRAIL sensitizers. Finally, we will suggest synergistic approaches for combining active withanolides with various forms of immunotherapy to promote cancer cell death and an effective antitumor immune response.\n\n[Social capital, violent deaths, and cancer mortality in Colombia: a population approach].\n\nPubMed\n\nIdrovo, Alvaro Javier\n\n2006-01-01\n\nIn Colombia there are evidences that social capital (SC) is associated with greater rates of violent crime (\"perverse\" SC). This study explores the relation between SC, violent deaths (1973-1996), and the accumulated occurrence of cancer deaths (1990-1996). An ecologic study with the 33 Colombian departments was carried out. Correlations between violent deaths (inverse proxy of SC), the internal displacement ratio, and the mortality rates by each type of cancer. With robust regressions the effect of violent deaths (\"perverse\" SC) on the occurrence of mortality cancer were explored, adjusting by economic convergence or polarization (1960-1995), and the internal displacement ratio until 1996. Positive correlations (p < 0.05) between violent deaths (\"perverse \"CS) and all types of cancer, except breast and lung among men, were observed. In all the cases statistically significant associations were observed, after adjust by departments' economic convergence/polarization and internal displacement. This study shows a direct relation between violent deaths on the occurrence of cancer. The findings obtained here suggest an inverted U shape relation between SC and disease occurrence.\n\nCancer as a cause of death among people with AIDS in the United States\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSimard, Edgar P.; Engels, Eric A.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nBackground People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), are at increased risk for cancer. Highly active antiretroviral therapy [(HAART), widely available since 1996] has resulted in dramatic declines in AIDS-related deaths. Methods We evaluated cancer as a cause of death in a U.S. registry-based cohort of 83,282 people with AIDS (1980â2006). Causes of death due to AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs) and non-AIDS-defining cancers (NADCs) were assessed. We evaluated mortality rates and the fraction of deaths due to cancer. Poisson regression assessed rates according to calendar year of AIDS onset. Results Overall mortality declined from 302 (1980â1989), to 140 (1990â1995), to 29 per 1,000 person-years (1996â2006). ADC mortality declined from 2.95 (1980â1989) to 0.65 per 1,000 person-years (1996â2006) (P<0.01), but the fraction of ADC-deaths increased from 1.05% to 2.47%, due to declines in other AIDS-related deaths. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma was the commonest cancer-related cause of death (36% during 1996â2006). Likewise, NADC mortality declined from 2.21 to 0.84 per 1,000 person-years (1980â1989 vs. 1996â2006, P<0.05), but the fraction of NADC-deaths increased to 3.16% during 1996â2006. Lung cancer was the most common NADC cause of death (21% of cancer-related deaths in 1996â2006). Conclusions Cancer mortality declined in the HAART era, but due to declining mortality from AIDS, cancers account for a growing fraction of deaths. Improved cancer prevention and treatment, particularly for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and lung cancer, would reduce mortality among people with AIDS.

Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a phase 2 pilot intervention trial. Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada. 60 adult outpatients with metastatic breast, endocrine, gastrointestinal, gynaecological, genitourinary and lung cancer. Death anxiety, as measured by the Death and Dying Distress Scale (DADDS). Thirty-two per cent of the sample reported death anxiety of at least moderate severity. The most distressing concern involved fears about the impact of one's death on others, and the least distressing concerns were related to dying alone or suddenly. According to regression analyses, death anxiety was negatively associated with self-esteem, b=-1.73, CI0.95 (-2.57 to -0.90) and positively associated with physical symptom burden, b=1.38, CI0.95 (0.44 to 2.31), having children under 18â years of age in the family, b=13.3, CI0.95 (2.15 to 24.5), and age, b=0.40, CI0.95 (0.0023 to 0.79). The physical symptoms most strongly associated with death anxiety were changes in physical appearance, b=18.8, CI0.95 (8.21 to29.5), and pain, b=10.1, CI0.95 (0.73 to 19.5). The findings suggest that death anxiety in patients with advanced cancer is common and determined by the interaction of individual factors, family circumstances and physical suffering. Multidimensional interventions that take into account these and other factors may be most likely to be effective to alleviate this death-related distress.

We examined temporal trends in death rates from all-cancer and the 19 most common cancers in the United States from 1970â2006. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed trends in age-standardized death rates (per 100,000) for all cancers combined, the four most common cancers, and 15 other sites from 1970â2006 in the United States using joinpoint regression model. The age-standardized death rate for all-cancers combined in men increased from 249.3 in 1970 to 279.8 in 1990, and then decreased to 221.1 in 2006, yielding a net decline of 21% and 11% from the 1990 and 1970 rates, respectively. Similarly, the all-cancer death rate in women increased from 163.0 in 1970 to 175.3 in 1991 and then decreased to 153.7 in 2006, a net decline of 12% and 6% from the 1991 and 1970 rates, respectively. These decreases since 1990/91 translate to preventing of 561,400 cancer deaths in men and 205,700 deaths in women. The decrease in death rates from all-cancers involved all ages and racial/ethnic groups. Death rates decreased for 15 of the 19 cancer sites, including the four major cancers, with lung, colorectum and prostate cancers in men and breast and colorectum cancers in women. Conclusions/Significance Progress in reducing cancer death rates is evident whether measured against baseline rates in 1970 or in 1990. The downturn in cancer death rates since 1990 result mostly from reductions in tobacco use, increased screening allowing early detection of several cancers, and modest to large improvements in treatment for specific cancers. Continued and increased investment in cancer prevention and control, access to high quality health care, and research could accelerate this progress.

The role of autophagy in the pathobiology of PDAC is intricate, with opposing functions manifested in different cellular contexts. MIR506 functions as a tumor suppressor in many cancer types through the regulation of multiple pathways. In this study, we hypothesized that MIR506 exerted a tumor suppression function in PDAC by inducing autophagy-related cell death. Our results provided evidence that downregulation of MIR506 expression was associated with disease progression in human PDAC. MIR506 triggered autophagic flux in PDAC cells, which led to autophagy-related cell death through direct targeting of the STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3)-BCL2-BECN1 axis. Silencing and inhibiting STAT3 recapitulated the effects of MIR506, whereas forced expression of STAT3 abrogated the effects of MIR506. We propose that the apoptosis-inhibitory protein BCL2, which also inhibits induction of autophagy by blocking BECN1, was inhibited by MIR506 through targeting STAT3, thus augmenting BECN1 and promoting autophagy-related cell death. Silencing BECN1 and overexpression of BCL2 abrogated the effects of MIR506. These findings expand the known mechanisms of MIR506-mediated tumor suppression to activation of autophagy-related cell death and suggest a strategy for using MIR506 as an anti-STAT3 approach to PDAC treatment.\n\nAssessing the utility of cancer-registry-processed cause of death in calculating cancer-specific survival.\n\nPubMed\n\nHu, Chung-Yuan; Xing, Yan; Cormier, Janice N; Chang, George J\n\n2013-05-15\n\nCancer registries use algorithms to process cause of death (COD) data from death certificates, but uncertainties remain regarding the accuracy and utility of those data in calculating cancer-specific survival (CSS). Because it is impractical to reconfirm the COD through meticulous review of the primary medical records, the observed cancer deaths could be compared with the number of attributed deaths, as estimated by using a relative survival (RS) approach, to determine utility in CSS estimation. Six major cancer types were evaluated using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data (1988-1999 cohort). The COD utility was quantified by using the observed-to-expected ratio (O/E ratio) approach, which was calculated as the SEER-documented observed number of cancer-specific deaths divided by the number of expected deaths attributed to the malignancies as estimated using a RS approach. Favorable utility would have an O/E ratio close to 1. In total, 338,445 patients were identified; and their O/E ratios were 0.97, 0.98, 0.90, 1.07, 1.02, and 0.92 for breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma, prostate, and pancreas cancer, respectively. O/E ratios varied slightly with patients' age, race, and tumor stage, but not by sex. CSS for patients with lung cancer appeared to be overestimated considerably. Patients with multiple cancer diagnoses had poor O/E ratios compared with those who had only 1 cancer. The utility of COD in calculating CSS depended variously on the risk of cancer-related mortality and nontumor factors. However, the impact of this variation on CSS generally was small. The current results indicated that the COD assigned by cancer registries has acceptable validity, and CSS is considered an acceptable surrogate for RS in most circumstances.

Screening impacts cancer mortality through decreasing the number of advanced cancers with poor diagnosis, while cancer treatment works through decreasing the case-fatality rate. Hence, reductions in cancer death rates thanks to screening should directly reflect reductions in advanced cancer rates. We verified whether in breast screening trials, the observed reductions in the risk of breast cancer death could be predicted from reductions of advanced breast cancer rates. Patients and Methods The Greater New York Health Insurance Plan trial (HIP) is the only breast screening trial that reported stage-specific cancer fatality for the screening and for the control group separately. The Swedish Two-County trial (TCT)) reported size-specific fatalities for cancer patients in both screening and control groups. We computed predicted numbers of breast cancer deaths, from which we calculated predicted relative risks (RR) and (95% confidence intervals). The Age trial in England performed its own calculations of predicted relative risk. Results The observed and predicted RR of breast cancer death were 0.72 (0.56â0.94) and 0.98 (0.77â1.24) in the HIP trial, and 0.79 (0.78â1.01) and 0.90 (0.80â1.01) in the Age trial. In the TCT, the observed RR was 0.73 (0.62â0.87), while the predicted RR was 0.89 (0.75â1.05) if overdiagnosis was assumed to be negligible and 0.83 (0.70â0.97) if extra cancers were excluded. Conclusions In breast screening trials, factors other than screening have contributed to reductions in the risk of breast cancer death most probably by reducing the fatality of advanced cancers in screening groups. These factors were the better management of breast cancer patients and the underreporting of breast cancer as the underlying cause of death. Breast screening trials should publish stage-specific fatalities observed in each group.

We sought to examine trends in deaths from occupational cancer, high-risk industries and exposures, and commonly compensated categories of occupational cancers. In addition, we compared deaths from occupational lung cancer for which compensation had been given with total deaths from lung cancer. Methods We used data from the Association of Workersâ Compensation Boards of Canada pertaining to the nature and source of the injury or disease and the industry in which it occurred (by jurisdiction) to describe trends in compensated claims for deaths from occupational cancer in Canada for the period 1997â2010. We used data published by the Canadian Cancer Society in Canadian Cancer Statistics to compare compensated occupational lung cancer deaths with total estimated lung cancer deaths for the period between 2006 and 2010. Results Compensated claims for deaths from occupational cancer have increased in recent years and surpassed those for traumatic injuries and disorders in Canada, particularly in Ontario. Between 1997 and 2010, one-half of all compensated deaths from occupational cancer in Canada were from Ontario. High-risk industries for occupational cancer include manufacturing, construction, mining and, more recently, government services. Deaths from lung cancer and mesothelioma comprise most of the compensated claims for deaths from occupational cancer in Ontario and Canada. These diseases are usually the result of asbestos exposure. The burden of other occupational carcinogens is not reflected in claims data.

The National Lung Screening Trial, a randomized controlled trial of lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography versus chest X-ray for heavy and/or long-term smokers ages 55-74âyears at enrollment, used a committee blinded to arm assignment for a subset of deaths to determine whether cause of death was due to lung cancer. Deaths were selected for review using a pre-determined computerized algorithm. The algorithm, which considered cancers diagnosed during the trial, causes and significant conditions listed on the death certificate, and the underlying cause of death derived from death certificate information by trained nosologists, selected deaths that were most likely to represent a death due to lung cancer (either directly or indirectly) and deaths that might have been erroneously assigned lung cancer as the cause of death. The algorithm also selected deaths that might be due to adverse events of diagnostic evaluation for lung cancer. Using the review cause of death as the gold standard and lung cancer cause of death as the outcome of interest (dichotomized as lung cancer versus not lung cancer), we calculated performance measures of the death certificate cause of death. We also recalculated the trial primary endpoint using the death certificate cause of death. In all, 1642 deaths were reviewed and assigned a cause of death (42% of the 3877 National Lung Screening Trial deaths). Sensitivity of death certificate cause of death was 91%; specificity, 97%; positive predictive value, 98%; and negative predictive value, 89%. About 40% of the deaths reclassified to lung cancer cause of death had a death certificate cause of death of a neoplasm other than lung. Using the death certificate cause of death, the lung cancer mortality reduction was 18% (95% confidence interval: 4.2-25.0), as\n\nEstimating liver cancer deaths in Thailand based on verbal autopsy study.\n\nPubMed\n\nWaeto, Salwa; Pipatjaturon, Nattakit; Tongkumchum, Phattrawan; Choonpradub, Chamnein; Saelim, Rattikan; Makaje, Nifatamah\n\n2014-01-01\n\nLiver cancer mortality is high in Thailand but utility of related vital statistics is limited due to national vital registration (VR) data being under reported for specific causes of deaths. Accurate methodologies and reliable supplementary data are needed to provide worthy national vital statistics. This study aimed to model liver cancer deaths based on verbal autopsy (VA) study in 2005 to provide more accurate estimates of liver cancer deaths than those reported. The results were used to estimate number of liver cancer deaths during 2000-2009. A verbal autopsy (VA) was carried out in 2005 based on a sample of 9,644 deaths from nine provinces and it provided reliable information on causes of deaths by gender, age group, location of deaths in or outside hospital, and causes of deaths of the VR database. Logistic regression was used to model liver cancer deaths and other variables. The estimated probabilities from the model were applied to liver cancer deaths in the VR database, 2000-2009. Thus, the more accurately VA-estimated numbers of liver cancer deaths were obtained. The model fits the data quite well with sensitivity 0.64. The confidence intervals from statistical model provide the estimates and their precisions. The VA-estimated numbers of liver cancer deaths were higher than the corresponding VR database with inflation factors 1.56 for males and 1.64 for females. The statistical methods used in this study can be applied to available mortality data in developing countries where their national vital registration data are of low quality and supplementary reliable data are available.\n\nU.S. congressional district cancer death rates.\n\nPubMed\n\nHao, Yongping; Ward, Elizabeth M; Jemal, Ahmedin; Pickle, Linda W; Thun, Michael J\n\n2006-06-23\n\nGeographic patterns of cancer death rates in the U.S. have customarily been presented by county or aggregated into state economic or health service areas. Herein, we present the geographic patterns of cancer death rates in the U.S. by congressional district. Many congressional districts do not follow state or county boundaries. However, counties are the smallest geographical units for which death rates are available. Thus, a method based on the hierarchical relationship of census geographic units was developed to estimate age-adjusted death rates for congressional districts using data obtained at county level. These rates may be useful in communicating to legislators and policy makers about the cancer burden and potential impact of cancer control in their jurisdictions. Mortality data were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) for 1990-2001 for 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all counties. We computed annual average age-adjusted death rates for all cancer sites combined, the four major cancers (lung and bronchus, prostate, female breast, and colorectal cancer) and cervical cancer. Cancer death rates varied widely across congressional districts for all cancer sites combined, for the four major cancers, and for cervical cancer. When examined at the national level, broad patterns of mortality by sex, race and region were generally similar with those previously observed based on county and state economic area. We developed a method to generate cancer death rates by congressional district using county-level mortality data. Characterizing the cancer burden by congressional district may be useful in promoting cancer control and prevention programs, and persuading legislators to enact new cancer control programs and/or strengthening existing ones. The method can be applied to state legislative districts and other analyses that involve data aggregation from different geographic units.\n\nU.S. congressional district cancer death rates\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHao, Yongping; Ward, Elizabeth M; Jemal, Ahmedin; Pickle, Linda W; Thun, Michael J\n\n2006-01-01\n\nBackground Geographic patterns of cancer death rates in the U.S. have customarily been presented by county or aggregated into state economic or health service areas.

The intracellular thiol redox state (controlled by GSH) is one of the endogenous effectors involved in regulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex and, in consequence, thiol oxidation can be a causal factor in the mitochondrion-based mechanism that leads to cell death. Nevertheless GSH depletion is a common feature not only of apoptosis but also of other types of cell death. Indeed rates of GSH synthesis and fluxes regulate its levels in cellular compartments, and potentially influence switches among different mechanisms of death. How changes in gene expression, post-translational modifications of proteins, and signaling cascades are implicated will be discussed. Furthermore, this review will finally analyze whether GSH depletion may facilitate cancer cell death under in vivo conditions, and how this can be applied to cancer therapy.

The aim of the study was to assess whether a cancer diagnosis affects the clinical presentation and short-term outcome in patients hospitalized for PE who were included in the Italian Pulmonary Embolism Registry. All-cause and PE-related in-hospital deaths were also analyzed. Out of 1702 patients, 451 (26.5Â %) of patients had a diagnosis of cancer: cancer was known at presentation in 365, or diagnosed during the hospital stay for PE in 86 (19Â % of cancer patients). Patients with and without cancer were similar concerning clinical status at presentation. Patients with cancer less commonly received thrombolytic therapy, and more often had an inferior vena cava filter inserted. Major or intracranial bleeding was not different between groups. In-hospital all-cause death occurred in 8.4 and 5.9Â % of patients with and without cancer, respectively. At multivariate analysis, cancer (OR 2.24, 95Â % CI 1.27-3.98; PÂ =Â 0.006) was an independent predictor of in-hospital death. Clinical instability, PE recurrence, age â¥75Â years, recent bed rest â¥3Â days, but not cancer, were independent predictors of in-hospital death due to PE. Cancer seems a weaker predictor of all-cause in-hospital death compared to other factors; the mere presence of cancer, without other risk factors, leads to a probability of early death of 2Â %. In patients with acute PE, cancer increases the probability of in-hospital all-cause death, but does not seem to affect the clinical presentation or the risk of in-hospital PE-related death.\n\nRelationship Between Mammographic Density and Breast Cancer Death in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Women with elevated mammographic density have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. However, among women diagnosed with breast cancer, it is unclear whether higher density portends reduced survival, independent of other factors. Methods We evaluated relationships between mammographic density and risk of death from breast cancer and all causes within the US Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. We studied 9232 women diagnosed with primary invasive breast carcinoma during 1996â2005, with a mean follow-up of 6.6 years. Mammographic density was assessed using the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) density classification. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression; women with scattered fibroglandular densities (BI-RADS 2) were the referent group. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results A total of 1795 women died, of whom 889 died of breast cancer. In multivariable analyses (adjusted for site, age at and year of diagnosis, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, body mass index, mode of detection, treatment, and income), high density (BI-RADS 4) was not related to risk of death from breast cancer (HR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.71 to 1.19) or death from all causes (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.68 to 1.02). Analyses stratified by stage and other prognostic factors yielded similar results, except for an increased risk of breast cancer death among women with low density (BI-RADS 1) who were either obese (HR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.37 to 2.97) or had tumors of at least 2.0cm (HR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.14 to 2.09). Conclusions High mammographic breast density was not associated with risk of death from breast cancer or death from any cause after accounting for other patient and tumor characteristics. Thus, risk factors for the development of breast cancer may not necessarily be the same as factors influencing the risk of death after breast cancer has developed.

We aimed to estimate alcohol-attributable cancer mortality and years of life lost by cancer site and identify differences between MÄori and non-MÄori New Zealanders. We applied the World Health Organization's comparative risk assessment methodology at the level of MÄori and non-MÄori subpopulations. Proportions of specific alcohol-related cancers attributable to alcohol were calculated by combining alcohol consumption estimates from representative surveys with relative risks from recent meta-analyses. These proportions were applied to both 2007 and 2012 mortality data. Alcohol consumption was responsible for 4.2% of all cancer deaths under 80âyears of age in 2007. An average of 10.4âyears of life was lost per person; 12.7âyears for MÄori and 10.1âyears for non-MÄori. Half of the deaths were attributable to average consumption of <4 standard drinks per day. Breast cancer comprised 61% of alcohol-attributable cancer deaths in women, and more than one-third of breast cancer deaths were attributable to average consumption of <2 standard drinks per day. Mortality data from 2012 produced very similar findings. Alcohol is an important and modifiable cause of cancer. Risk of cancer increases with higher alcohol consumption, but there is no safe level of drinking. Reduction in population alcohol consumption would reduce cancer deaths. Additional strategies to reduce ethnic disparities in risk and outcome are needed in New Zealand. [Connor J, Kydd R, Maclennan B, Shield K, Rehm J.

New self-report measurements have been developed, but their interpretation and clinical utility may not be evident. To inform our understanding of death anxiety in patients with advanced cancer by exploring the relationship between this self-reported symptom and its clinical presentation. Participants were part of a psychotherapy trial in advanced cancer. First therapy session transcripts were analyzed using interpretive description in patients reporting low, moderate, and high death anxiety on the Death and Dying Distress Scale (DADDS). A total of 16 participants (10 women and 6 men) with advanced or metastatic cancer were sampled from the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, Canada. Six participants reported low death anxiety scores (Death and Dying Distress Scale: 0-19), five moderate (Death and Dying Distress Scale: 20-50), and five high (Death and Dying Distress Scale: 51-75). The low death anxiety group exhibited psychological readiness for death, or contrastingly, non-reflectiveness about death. The moderate group recognized the imminence of mortality, which impacted treatment decisions and future plans. Prior experience with death was discussed as raising the salience of mortality. The high group felt dominated by powerful emotions and could not make sense of their situation. Their distress was exacerbated by substantial relational concerns. Self-reported death anxiety is affected by the awareness and ability to reflect on mortality. Death and Dying Distress Scale scores may facilitate exploration of this symptom as part of a clinical assessment and may serve to guide treatment approaches. Greater attention to death anxiety is consistent with and recommended by contemporary approaches to palliative care.

Furthermore, we do not know if professionals' report on deceased patients' preference of place-of-death is a valid information. The aim of this study was to describe where terminally ill Danish cancer patients prefer to die and to determine if their preference changed during the palliative period, as reported retrospectively by bereaved relatives, general practitioners (GPs) and community nurses (CNs) and to assess the agreement of their accounts. The study was a population-based, cross-sectional combined register and questionnaire study in Aarhus County, Denmark. The population comprised 599 deceased adult cancer patients who had died from 1 March to 30 November 2006 and were identified through merging of health registers. Relatives returned 198 questionnaires about patients' preferred place-of-death, GPs 333 and CNs 201. The study showed that most terminally ill cancer patients preferred home death (up to 80.7%). The reported preference for home death weakened as death approached (down to 64.4%). A better congruence was seen between relatives' and GPs' accounts of preference for place of death at the end of the palliative period (Îº 0.71) than between relatives' and CNs' accounts (Îº 0.37). In conclusion, bereaved relatives (and GPs and CNs) report retrospectively that most terminally ill cancer patients wish to die at home. The preference weakened significantly as death approached. The agreement between relatives' and GPs' accounts on patients' preferences at the end of the palliative period was 'substantial', whereas the agreement between relatives' and CNs' accounts at the same time was significantly less outspoken. This indicates that CNs may be facing a problem in assessing their patients' wishes retrospectively. Â© 2011 The Authors.

The endogenous ligand for death receptors 4 and 5 (DR4 and DR5) is TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, TRAIL (Apo2L). As most untransformed cells are not susceptible to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, death receptor activators have emerged as promising cancer therapeutic agents. One strategy to stimulate death receptors in cancer patients is to use soluble human recombinant TRAIL protein, but this agent has limitations of a short half-life and decoy receptor sequestration. Another strategy that attempted to evade decoy receptor sequestration and to provide improved pharmacokinetic properties was to generate DR4 or DR5 agonist antibodies. The resulting monoclonal agonist antibodies overcame the limitations of short half-life and avoided decoy receptor sequestration, but are limited by activating only one of the two death receptors. Here, we describe a DR4 and DR5 dual agonist produced using Surrobody technology that activates both DR4 and DR5 to induce apoptotic death of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo and also avoids decoy receptor sequestration. This fully human anti-DR4/DR5 Surrobody displays superior potency to DR4- and DR5-specific antibodies, even when combined with TRAIL-sensitizing proapoptotic agents. Moreover, cancer cells were less likely to acquire resistance to Surrobody than either anti-DR4 or anti-DR5 monospecific antibodies. Taken together, Surrobody shows promising preclinical proapoptotic activity against cancer cells, meriting further exploration of its potential as a novel cancer therapeutic agent.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the economic burden of major cancer deaths caused by smoking in Iran in 2012. Number of major cancer deaths due to smoking by sex and age groups in 2012 was obtained from GLOBCAN database. The life expectancy and retirement age were used to estimate years of potential life lost (YPLL) and cost of productive lost attributable to smoking, respectively. Data on prevalence of smoking, relative risk of smoking, life expectancy table, annual wage and employment rate were extracted from the various resources such as previous studies, WHO database and Iranian statistic centers. The data analysis was conducted by Excel software. Smoking was responsible for 4,623 cancer deaths, 80808 YPLL and $US 83,019,583 cost of productivity lost. Lung cancer accounts for largest proportion of total cancer deaths, YPLL and cost of productivity lost attributable to smoking. Males account for 86.6% of cancer deaths, 82.6% of YPLL and 85.3% of cost of productivity lost caused by smoking. Smoking places a high economic burden on health system and society as a whole. In addition, if no one had been smokers in Iran, approximately two out of ten cancer deaths could be prevented.\n\nDual agonist Surrobodyâ¢ simultaneously activates death receptors DR4 and DR5 to induce cancer cell death\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMilutinovic, Snezana; Kashyap, Arun K.; Yanagi, Teruki; Wimer, Carina; Zhou, Sihong; O' Neil, Ryann; Kurtzman, Aaron L.; Faynboym, Alexsandr; Xu, Li; Hannum, Charles H.; Diaz, Paul W.; Matsuzawa, Shu-ichi; Horowitz, Michael; Horowitz, Lawrence; Bhatt, Ramesh R.; Reed, John C.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDeath receptors of the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) family are found on surface of most cancer cells and their activation typically kills cancer cells through the stimulation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.

From 22 studies participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium, 25,571 white women with invasive breast cancer were genotyped for CHEK2*1100delC and observed for up to 20 years (median, 6.6 years). We examined risk of early death and breast cancer-specific death by estrogen receptor status and risk of a second breast cancer after a first breast cancer in prospective studies. CHEK2*1100delC heterozygosity was found in 459 patients (1.8%). In women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios for heterozygotes versus noncarriers were 1.43 (95% CI, 1.12 to 1.82; log-rank P = .004) for early death and 1.63 (95% CI, 1.24 to 2.15; log-rank P < .001) for breast cancer-specific death. In all women, hazard ratio for a second breast cancer was 2.77 (95% CI, 2.00 to 3.83; log-rank P < .001) increasing to 3.52 (95% CI, 2.35 to 5.27; log-rank P < .001) in women with estrogen receptor-positive first breast cancer only. Among women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, CHEK2*1100delC heterozygosity was associated with a 1.4-fold risk of early death, a 1.6-fold risk of breast cancer-specific death, and a 3.5-fold risk of a second breast cancer. This is one of the few examples of a genetic factor that influences long-term prognosis being documented in an extensive series of women with breast cancer.\n\nUniform and blinded cause of death verification of the NELSON lung cancer screening participants.\n\nPubMed\n\nYousaf-Khan, A U; van der Aalst, C M; Aerts, J G J V; den Bakker, M A; de Koning, H J\n\n2017-09-01\n\nPrimary outcome of the Dutch-Belgian lung cancer screening trial (NELSON) is lung cancer-specific mortality. Accurate assessment of the cause of death (CoD) is crucial. As death certificates regarding the CoD can be inaccurate, a clinical expert committee (CEC) was formed to assign the CoD. In this study, the medical files of deceased lung cancer patients were reviewed and the outcomes were compared with official death certificates. The first 266 completed medical files of Dutch deceased participants who were diagnosed with lung cancer during the study or of those with lung cancer on the death certificate were selected and blinded towards arms and patients identity. The end product of the review process consisted of six possible categories which defined the graduation of certainty that lung cancer was the primary CoD. The percentage agreement and the Cohen's kappa statistics between the two CEC-memberswere calculated. The sensitivity and specificity of the official death certificates were determined. The results indicated that, the overall concordance and the Cohen's kappa between the CEC-memberswere 86.1% and 0.57(0.45-0.69, p<0.001), respectively. This level increased with the numbers of cases evaluated. The sensitivity and the specificity of the official death certificate were 92.6% and 98.8%; 6.5% cases were reclassified to lung cancer specific death, which is lower than in the National Lung Screening trial(22.0%). Concluding, each death should be reviewed by at least two members. So far, in the NELSON trial, possible biases related to lung cancer death seem relatively small. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This study was conducted to examine the outcomes of late-stage diagnosis, treatment, and cancer-related death according to race and geographic residency status (rural vs urban). This study utilized cross-sectional and follow-up data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program for all incident colon and rectal tumors diagnosed for the Atlanta and Rural Georgia Cancer Registries for the years 1992-2007. Compared to whites, African Americans had a 40% increased odds (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.30-1.51) of late-stage diagnosis, a 50% decreased odds (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37-0.68) of having surgery for colon cancer, and a 67% decreased odds (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.25-0.44) of receiving surgery for rectal cancer. Rural residence was not associated with late stage at diagnosis or receipt of treatment. African Americans had a slightly increased risk of death from colon cancer (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00-1.24) and a larger increased risk of death due to rectal cancer (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.14-1.35). Rural residents experienced a 15% increased risk of death (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.32) due to colon cancer. Further investigations should target African Americans and rural residents to gain insight into the etiologic mechanisms responsible for the poorer CRC outcomes experienced by these 2 segments of the population.

We explore two methods to estimate this burden using mesothelioma deaths as a proxy for asbestos exposure. Methods: From the follow-up of 55 asbestos cohorts, we estimated ratios of (i) absolute number of asbestos-related lung cancers to mesothelioma deaths; (ii) excess lung cancer relative risk (%) to mesothelioma mortality per 1000 non-asbestos-related deaths. Results: Ratios varied by asbestos type; there were a mean 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.5, 1.0) asbestos-related lung cancers per mesothelioma death in crocidolite cohorts (n=6 estimates), 6.1 (3.6, 10.5) in chrysotile (n=16), 4.0 (2.8, 5.9) in amosite (n=4) and 1.9 (1.4, 2.6) in mixed asbestos fibre cohorts (n=31). In a population with 2 mesothelioma deaths per 1000 deaths at ages 40â84 years (e.g., US men), the estimated lung cancer population attributable fraction due to mixed asbestos was estimated to be 4.0%. Conclusion: All types of asbestos fibres kill at least twice as many people through lung cancer than through mesothelioma, except for crocidolite. For chrysotile, widely consumed today, asbestos-related lung cancers cannot be robustly estimated from few mesothelioma deaths and the latter cannot be used to infer no excess risk of lung or other cancers.

Omega-3 fatty acids can modulate inflammation and present anticancer effects, promoting cancer cell death. Pyroptosis is an inflammation related cell death and so far, the function of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in pyroptosis cell death has not been described. This study investigated the role of DHA in triggering pyroptosis activation in breast cancer cells. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were supplemented with DHA and inflammation cell death was analyzed. DHA-treated breast cancer cells triggered increased caspase-1and gasdermin D activation, enhanced IL-1Î² secretion, translocated HMGB1 towards the cytoplasm, and membrane pore formation when compared to untreated cells, suggesting DHA induces pyroptosis programmed cell death in breast cancer cells. Moreover, caspase-1 inhibitor (YVAD) could protect breast cancer cells from DHA-induced pyroptotic cell death. In addition, membrane pore formation showed to be a lysosomal damage and ROS formation-depended event in breast cancer cells. DHA triggered pyroptosis cell death in MDA-MB-231by activating several pyroptosis markers in these cells. This is the first study that shows the effect of DHA triggering pyroptosis programmed cell death in breast cancer cells and it could improve the understanding of the omega-3 supplementation during breast cancer treatment.\n\nAsbestos and cancer: a cohort followed up to death.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nEnterline, P E; Hartley, J; Henderson, V\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe mortality experience of 1074 white men who retired from a United States asbestos company during the period 1941-67 and who were exposed to asbestos working as production and maintenance employees for the company is reported to the end of 1980 when 88% of this cohort was known to be dead. As noted in earlier reports the mortality for respiratory and gastrointestinal cancer was raised. A more detailed examination of causes of death shows that the excess in gastrointestinal cancer was largely due to a statistically significant excess in stomach cancer. A statistically significant excess was also noted for kidney cancer, cancer of the eye, and non-malignant respiratory disease. Eight deaths from malignant mesothelioma were observed, two of which were peritoneal. Asbestos exposures for these mesothelioma cases were low relative to other members of the cohort. Continuing follow up of this cohort shows a dose response relation for respiratory cancer that has become increasingly linear. Standardised mortality ratios peaked 10 to 15 years after retirement and were relatively constant at around 250 in each five year interval starting in 1950. This excess might have been detected as early as 1960 but certainly by 1965. The mortality experience of this cohort reflects the ultimate effects of asbestos since nearly all of the cohort has now died.

A database was used for 9 population-based cancer registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program, including deaths in 1999-2010 for patients diagnosed in 1973-2010. Numbers of deaths and death rates for OCPC in the SEER population were modified for apparent inaccuracies in the cancer site coded as the underlying cause of death. For age groups <65 years, deaths from OCPC were underestimated by 22-35% by using unmodified (vs. modified) numbers, but temporal declines in death rates were still evident in the SEER population and were similar to declines using routine mortality data for the entire U.S. population. Deaths were underestimated by about 70-80% using underlying cause for tonsillar cancers, strongly associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, but a lack of decline in death rates was still evident. Routine mortality statistics based on underlying cause of death underestimate OCPC deaths but demonstrate trends in OCPC death rates that require continued surveillance in view of increasing incidence rates for HPV-related OCPC.

However, in view of substantial geographic differences in antitobacco measures and sociodemographic factors that affect smoking prevalence, it is unknown whether this change in the trend was similar across all states. We examined female age-specific lung cancer death rates (1973 through 2007) by year of death and birth in each state by using age-period-cohort models. Cohort relative risks adjusted for age and period effects were used to compare the lung cancer death rate for a given birth cohort to a referent birth cohort (ie, the 1933 cohort herein). Age-specific lung cancer death rates declined continuously in white women in California, but the rates declined less quickly or even increased in the remaining states among women younger than age 50 years and women born after the 1950s, especially in several southern and midwestern states. For example, in some southern states (eg, Alabama), lung cancer death rates among women born in the 1960s were approximately double those of women born in the 1930s. The unfavorable lung cancer trend in white women born after circa 1950 in southern and midwestern states underscores the need for additional interventions to promote smoking cessation in these high-risk populations, which could lead to more favorable future mortality trends for lung cancer and other smoking-related diseases.\n\nIncreasing Lung Cancer Death Rates Among Young Women in Southern and Midwestern States\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJemal, Ahmedin; Ma, Jiemin; Rosenberg, Philip S.; Siegel, Rebecca; Anderson, William F.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPurpose Previous studies reported that declines in age-specific lung cancer death rates among women in the United States abruptly slowed in women younger than age 50 years (ie, women born after the 1950s).

Also, it is unclear whether these attitudes and emotions toward death and afterlife influence patients' distress. To assess the relationship of attitudes and emotions towards death and an afterlife with quality of life, depression and hopelessness in cancer patients without evidence of disease and advanced cancer patients facing death. Ninety-one cancer patients without evidence of disease and 57 advanced cancer patients completed the Dutch Attitudes Toward Death and Afterlife Scale. Emotions toward death were measured using the Self-Confrontation Method. Quality of life was measured with the Satisfaction with Life Scale and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality-of-Life Questionnaire. Depression and hopelessness were measured with the Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care and the Beck Hopelessness Scale. Average scores on attitudes and emotions toward death and an afterlife were not significantly different between the two groups. However, in the no evidence of disease group, a negative association between negative emotions and social functioning was observed, which was not present in the advanced cancer group. In the advanced cancer group, associations were observed that were not present in the no evidence of disease group: positive associations between an explicitly religious attitude and global health status and between reincarnation belief and role and cognitive functioning, and a negative association between other-directed emotions and social functioning. Patients without evidence of disease and advanced cancer patients do not differ in attitudes or emotions toward death, but the relationship between these attitudes and emotions and aspects of quality of life varies. When there is no evidence of disease, negative emotions play the most important role, whereas in the advanced\n\nIdentification and Emotions Experienced after a Celebrity Cancer Death Shape Information Sharing and Prosocial Behavior.\n\nPubMed\n\nMyrick, Jessica Gall\n\n2017-06-01\n\nBased on the previous work investigating public reactions to celebrity cancer deaths as well as on the appraisal theory of emotions, an online survey (NÂ =Â 641) was conducted after the cancer death of popular sportscaster Stuart Scott. The aim was to better understand how the public shared news and reactions with others and if this social sharing impacted prosocial cancer-related behaviors (e.g., donating, volunteering, talking to others about cancer research). Two hierarchical logistic regression models were run. In the first, identification with Scott and emotional reactions to hearing about his death were significant predictors of sharing, even after controlling for demographics. In the second, feeling hopeful and having shared information with others predicted prosocial cancer-related behaviors. These results suggest promising strategies for designing more effective cancer awareness messages and fundraising campaigns after celebrity cancer announcements.\n\nDeterminants of grief resolution in cancer death.\n\nPubMed\n\nYancey, D; Greger, H A; Coburn, P\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe death of a loved one can be very difficult, and yet there is little information about how nurses can help someone through it. The purpose of this exploratory ex post facto study was to determine whether the circumstances of a cancer death influence the grief resolution of the survivor at one month after the death. The circumstances that were studied include: (1) the place of death, (2) the length of the cancer illness, (3) the perceived social support from family/friends, (4) the perceived social support from nurses, (5) satisfaction with the care received by the loved one, and (6) the quality of death of the loved one. Data were gathered from 43 survivors (spouses, children, and parents) through questionnaires and an open-ended interview. The study findings provide a better understanding and knowledge of nursing interventions for the family/friend of the imminently terminal cancer patient.\n\nEstimates of cancer deaths attributable to behavioural risk factors in Italy, 2013.\n\nPubMed\n\nBattisti, Francesca; Carreras, Giulia; Grassi, Tommaso; Chellini, Elisabetta; Gorini, Giuseppe\n\n2017-01-01\n\n\"Non-communicable diseases cause more than 80% of deaths in europe and, among these, 20% are caused by cancer. Modifiable lifestyle factors considered in the italian national programme \"Guadagnare salute\" (Gaining health), such as tobacco smoking, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, overweight, and excessive alcohol use, are amongst the major causes of cancer deaths. The aims of this study was to estimate the number of deaths attributable to lifestyle factors for italy and for italian regions in 2013 and to describe its variation in relation to the regional prevalence of risk factors exposure. For Italy and for each italian region, deaths attributable to lifestyle factors were estimated using the methodology of the Global Burden of disease (GBd) study. italian mortality data of 2013 and risks attributable to these lifestyle factors for each cancer site for italy from the GBd study were used. Prevalence of exposure to lifestyles in Italy and in each Italian Region was collected fo"
