        "text": "EU Elections Disinfo Bulletin\n\nStay informed and ahead of disinformation threats with the daily newsletter from the EDMO Task Force on 2024 European Elections. Subscribe here.\n\nWelcome to Disinfo Bulletin, your daily update from the EDMO network. Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüá™üá∫ EU Elections 2024: the battle against disinformation was won, but the attrition war is far from over. After the conclusion of the EU Elections 2024, a short comment by the coordinator of EDMO fact-checking activities has been published. The document reports that no significant last-minute disinformation-related incidents were detected. ‚ÄúAwareness around the issue of disinformation by the political and media environment, as well as by the general public ‚Äì together with the readiness of institutions, platforms, fact-checkers, researchers and of everyone involved in the fight against disinformation ‚Äì could have deterred malicious actors from any major attempt in the last few days and hours before the vote‚Äù, the document says.\n\nHowever, the lack of last-minute major incidents is not reason enough to celebrate. Disinformation about the EU increased significantly in the months before the vote and perceptions about many issues, sensitive to public opinions, have been tainted by huge amounts of false news in recent years, when the attention about fighting disinformation was not as high as in the last few months. ‚ÄúIt is possible to keep bad actors at bay. But it is not enough to do so only before an important election or during a severe crisis. The European information space must be kept clean and monitored all the time and there is still a lot to do to ensure one of democracy‚Äôs cornerstones, the people‚Äôs fundamental right to be correctly informed‚Äù, the document states, emphasizing the need for constant vigilance. Read more here:EU Elections 2024: the battle against disinformation was won, but the attrition war is far from over.\n\nüó≥Ô∏è Disinformation about the electoral process in the post-election period. Although widespread or noisy contestation of election results is not detected, false stories with limited impact can appear in national contexts. In Italy, for example, a post on Facebook questioned the origin of 176,000 votes for a candidate in the 2024 European elections, calling it ‚Äúanomalous‚Äù that she received votes in only two constituencies. The post, written by a well-known conspiracy theorist, lacks context. The person was a candidate in the Insular and Northwestern constituencies only (Italian voters can only vote for candidates within their own constituency). Thus, the distribution of her votes is entirely consistent with the electoral rules.\n\nüì≤ How did the platforms handle online disinformation during the EU elections campaign? A report published today by Maldita.es, a Spanish fact-checking organization part of the EDMO network, contains an analysis of posts and videos verified in fact-checking articles hosted in the database Elections24Check, to see if platforms had taken any action (and which) regarding them, during the four months ahead of the elections, including the Election Day. Covering a total of 1,321 posts identified in 26 European countries, it emerges that 45% of disinformation content received no visible action and that the situation is quite different from platform to platform, and from topic to topic. For the detailed analysis, read the full report: Platform Response to Disinformation during the EU Election 2024.\n\n‚ôÄÔ∏è Gendered disinformation during the EU elections campaigns. Female politicians face heightened risks of harassment and disinformation, with attacks often more vicious than those targeting their male counterparts. This environment can force women out of politics, undermining democracy and female participation. According to an article on The Global Disinformation Index‚Äôs website, an organization aimed at countering online disinformation, during the 2024 EU elections, online gendered abuse surged, targeting EU leaders and candidates with misogynistic narratives. Notably, Ursula von der Leyen faced severe attacks questioning her competence and integrity, while black female politicians experienced even harsher abuse.

As the 2024 European elections have concluded, the Disinfo Bulletin is taking a break. Your engagement and support have been fundamental and deeply appreciated. Stay tuned, as you might hear from us again in the future. In the meantime, thanks to the whole EDMO community and the European fact-checking community at large for the great work!\n\nGoodbye from the EDMO Task Force on EU elections and Enzo Panizio, Pagella Politica / Facta.news!\n\nIf you have suggestions, comments or requests about this newsletter, you can write to [email protected]\n\nWhat is a ‚Äúdisinformation narrative‚Äù?

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüó≥Ô∏è üá™üá∏ Disinformation tried to exploit problems with polling stations in Spain on election day. In the country, claims exploited minor technical problems in some cities to suggest an attempt to prevent people from voting or to undermine confidence in the electoral process. In Torrelodones, false claims spread that polling stations were closing late due to a lack of ballot papers, suggesting deliberate manipulation. The government delegation clarified that the delays were due to a shortage of ballots for the Feminist Party in Congress (PFAC) and extended voting hours accordingly. In Murcia, allegations circulated that booths were out of ballots, suggesting that citizens were prevented from voting. The city council admitted that some booths couldn‚Äôt accommodate ballots due to their design, but the ballots were provided near the booths, as required by law.\n\nüíª üá∏üá™ A top Swedish candidate‚Äôs campaign was likely boosted by coordinated behaviors by X accounts. According to K√§llkritikbyr√•n, a Swedish fact-checking organization part of the EDMO network, Charlie Weimers, a top candidate for the Sweden Democrats (SD) in the EU elections, has been supported by numerous Persian-speaking accounts in a coordinated campaign on X. Analysts have flagged this activity as potentially inauthentic, but it is unclear if it is run by real people or bots. The hashtag #vote4charlie has been used around 2,200 times in the past week, with many accounts also expressing support for Reza Pahlavi, the former Crown Prince of Iran. The coordinated behavior includes rapid, repetitive posting and link sharing, raising concerns about the authenticity of this support. Read the reporting here: Koordinerat beteende i kampanj f√∂r Charlie Weimers (SD) (in Swedish).\n\nüèÖ Disinformation targeting the Paris 2024 Olympics. AFP Factuel ‚Äì the French fact-checking unit of the news agency, also part of the EDMO network ‚Äì reports that the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympics have become a primary target for disinformation campaigns, especially by Russia and Azerbaijan, aimed at undermining France‚Äôs credibility. False stories, vehiculated by graffiti in Paris and fake news articles, are being spread to discredit the event and claim security threats and organizational failures, using manipulative tactics, including fake social media campaigns and falsified visuals. This strategy seeks to fracture societal trust and exploit public concerns for geopolitical gains. Read the article here: Les JO de Paris, cible de choix de la d√©sinformation (in French).\n\nMoreover, a recent research by Microsoft revealed that Russian internet trolls, using AI-generated content, launched a campaign to discredit the Olympics and incite terrorism fears. This included a documentary with an AI-generated voiceover impersonating Tom Cruise, aimed at undermining the International Olympic Committee after Russia‚Äôs ban from the Games due to its invasion of Ukraine. At the same time, false stories circulating in EU countries are attempting to magnify protests against the organization of the event or the risks associated with participation.\n\nIf you have suggestions, comments or requests about this newsletter, you can write to [email protected]\n\nWhat is a ‚Äúdisinformation narrative‚Äù? Please find here a short methodological note about the definition used by the EDMO fact-checking network.\n\nThe Disinfo Bulletin gathers material from the inputs of the EDMO fact-checking network, as well as a recently launched public database from the EFCSN network (Elections 24 Check), and the various national EDMO hubs, including community initiatives and insights from individual fact-checking organizations.\n\nWelcome to Disinfo Bulletin, your daily update from the EDMO network. Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüá™üá∫ As EU citizens are called to the polls, no major disinformation incidents appear to be ongoing. Despite the spread of disinformation in the weeks leading up to the vote ‚Äì especially false narratives alleging fraud and irregularities in voting procedures and those pushing citizens to abstentionism ‚Äì these attempts do not appear to have resulted in major, Europe-wide disinformation campaigns during the election days so far, according to the monitoring activities carried out by the EDMO Taskforce on 2024 European elections.\n\nüá∫üá¶ üò° The false story that the EU will impose a ‚ÄúUkraine Solidarity Tax‚Äù. A few days before citizens head to the polls, disinformation used anti-Ukrainian sentiment to sow discord toward European institutions. In Germany, social media posts falsely claimed that the EU will impose a ‚ÄúUkraine Solidarity Tax‚Äù of 80 euros per month starting August 2024, in an attempt to undermine support for Ukraine and at the same time push negative sentiment toward EU institutions, portraying them as imposing unfair measures on EU citizens. However, both the European Commission and the German Federal Ministry of Finance have confirmed that there are no such plans.\n\nüá∏üá∞üë®üèº‚Äçüíº Fico speaks for the first time after the assassination attempt and recalls disinformation narratives about the shooting. The Slovak PM Robert Fico‚Äôs first address after his May assassination attempt, published online on June 5, is likely to impact the robust disinformation scene in the country, according to local fact-checking organizations. He began his filmed speech by preaching forgiveness, but very quickly started pointing fingers and identifying guilty parties beyond the shooter himself, including the EU. By painting the shooter as an activist who targeted him for holding political views that go against ‚Äúbig democracy‚Äù, Fico appears to feed the circulating falsehood that the attempt on his life was supported by Progressive Slovakia, the country‚Äôs main opposition party.\n\nFico also took the opportunity to accuse the ‚Äúanti-government media‚Äù (including conspiracy theorist favorite George Soros, whom he mentioned by name) and ‚Äúforeign-funded non-governmental organizations‚Äù of downplaying the assassination attempt, appearing to portray himself as the victim of ‚Äúinternational imperialism‚Äù and a martyr for anti-establishment politicians.\n\nüö∂üèΩA fifth of false claims about migrants in Europe aim to criminalize them. According to an analysis by EFE Verifica, a Spanish fact-checking organization part of the EDMO network, a significant part of the disinformation targeting migrants depicts them as violent or used to commit crimes. Spanish fact-checkers collected ‚Äì thanks to Election 24 Check, a public database containing false stories surrounding the EU elections and one of the sources for this newsletter ‚Äì 106 false claims and found that 21 of these portray migrants as criminals. False claims often exaggerate the supposed danger migrants pose to society, exploiting local concerns and contexts, and adapting narratives to resonate more strongly with local populations. Experts also note that disinformation about migrants is often aligned with political agendas, particularly around election times, and disproportionately blames international institutions, notably the EU. Read the full text here:Elections24Check: la quinta parte de las afirmaciones falsas sobre migrantes en Europa busca su criminalizaci√≥n (in Spanish).\n\nOther false claims also allege a political will to over-represent migrants, as in the case of the false information circulated in Spain that the ‚ÄúSocialist party in Brussels presented only Muslim candidates‚Äù.\n\nIf you have suggestions, comments or requests about this newsletter, you can write to [email protected]\n\nWhat is a ‚Äúdisinformation narrative‚Äù? Please find here a short methodological note about the definition used by the EDMO fact-checking network.\n\nThe Disinfo Bulletin gathers material from the inputs of the EDMO fact-checking network, as well as a recently launched public database from the EFCSN network (Elections 24 Check), and the various national EDMO hubs, including community initiatives and insights from individual fact-checking organizations.\n\nWelcome to Disinfo Bulletin, your daily update from the EDMO network. Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüó≥Ô∏è ‚õìÔ∏è The false story that voting in the European elections is a crime. In Germany, false claims are circulating online ‚Äì and particularly on Telegram ‚Äì that voting in the European elections is a criminal offense, citing a 2012 German Federal Constitutional Court ruling as proof. However, the ruling pertains only to the allocation of seats in the Bundestag and has no bearing on European elections. This disinformation story is consistent with others detected in other countries ‚Äì as reported in previous issues of the Bulletin ‚Äì and tries to push citizens to not vote and mistrust the voting procedure.\n\nGermany has been the first country where disinformation about the EU electoral process has been detected in the run-up to these elections. Correctiv, an investigative and fact-checking organization part of the EDMO network, published an analysis of the recent disinformation about the electoral process in the country. Read it here: Wahlen als N√§hrboden f√ºr Desinformation: Welche Fakes kursieren und wie wir uns wehren k√∂nnen (in German).\n\nüá™üá∫ False stories sowing anti-EU sentiment hours before citizens cast their ballots. In many countries, false stories are circulating trying to discredit EU institutions or European membership. In Romania, false claims circulate on Facebook that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen advocated for ‚Äúlockdowns‚Äù to combat disinformation. In a recent speech, she compared disinformation to a virus and emphasized ‚Äúpre-bunking‚Äù ‚Äì a preventive strategy to counter false information before it spreads trying to anticipate its possible patterns. This term was misinterpreted as ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù in some Romanian social media posts, adding that ‚ÄúVon der Leyen promises to ‚Äòvaccinate‚Äô the EU population against ‚Äòwrong thinking‚Äô‚Äù.\n\nIn Italy, in recent days, false stories spread claiming that the EU Commission censored the existence of chemtrails, even if it allegedly knew about their existence and dangerousness since 2015, or that the EU Parliament has hidden a document about the impact of 5G on health. In Bulgaria, false claims have exaggerated the number of citizens who oppose the Euro, while Russian propaganda has intensified its effort to boost Euroskepticism, according to EURACTIV.\n\nüîé Disinformation discrediting the EU in the Baltics ahead of the vote. Ahead of the European Parliament elections, mis/disinformation targeting the EU has been rampant in the Baltic states, according to an analysis by Re:Baltica, with the contribution of Delfi Estonia and Delfi Lithuania. False claims have included the EU forcing immediate use of electric cars, banning old car repairs, and prohibiting firewood heating.\n\nAccording to these local fact-checking organizations, populist parties in Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have spread these disinformation stories, especially on TikTok, to mobilize voters. Additionally, misleading narratives about the EU Migration Pact and election fraud have been prevalent. Kremlin disinformation has also persisted, accusing the West of staging the war in Ukraine and spreading falsehoods about Ukrainian leadership. Read the article here: Old cars, immigrants and war ‚Äì how EU related misinformation is spread in the Baltics?\n\nIf you have suggestions, comments or requests about this newsletter, you can write to [email protected]\n\nWhat is a ‚Äúdisinformation narrative‚Äù? Please find here a short methodological note about the definition used by the EDMO fact-checking network.\n\nThe Disinfo Bulletin gathers material from the inputs of the EDMO fact-checking network, as well as a recently launched public database from the EFCSN network (Elections 24 Check), and the various national EDMO hubs, including community initiatives and insights from individual fact-checking organizations.\n\nWelcome to Disinfo Bulletin, your daily update from the EDMO network. Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüó≥Ô∏è Disinformation about the electoral process expands. In Spain, conspiracy theories about an alleged ‚Äúinformation blackout‚Äù that would allow the government to rig the results are circulating. In the country, the polls will close at 20:00 on Sunday, but preliminary results will be made available from 23:00, due to EU regulations requiring all member states to finish voting first, with Italy being the last. False claims suggest that this would be a deliberate ‚Äúmedia blackout‚Äù to manipulate voter turnout and influence the European elections.\n\nIn the Netherlands ‚Äì where the elections took place yesterday ‚Äì false claims of imminent election fraud in Germany have been circulating on social media in recent weeks, exploiting a serious human error to allege attempts to tamper with votes. In fact, in a Bavarian city, old ballots from the 2019 European elections were mistakenly sent instead of blank ones, prompting fraud accusations. However, an investigation ruled out any intent to influence the election. In a recent report, EDMO warned that potential counting issues or other incidents related to the voting procedures could lead to disinformation campaigns about the electoral process, a trend already detected in previous elections.\n\nAs repeatedly reported in this newsletter, there is also a broader effort to push abstentionism in various EU countries.\n\nüë®üèº‚Äçüíº üò° Disinformation using political parties and their leaders to question the fairness of democratic processes. According to EURACTIV Slovakia, in the run-up to the 2024 European elections, Slovak opposition leader Michal ≈†imeƒçka has been targeted by disinformation campaigns portraying him as a foreign agent and alleging his involvement in coup planning, spreading conspiracies about the West allegedly paying the opposition party to stage coups (thus trying to rig elections or subvert their outcomes). Another highly significant false story about ≈†imeƒçka allegedly talking about rigged elections was circulated in Slovakia a few days before the national parliamentary election in September 2023, using artificially generated audio.\n\nIn Ireland, where the vote takes place today, local fact-checking units report that non-white candidates in Ireland have faced a surge of misinformation and racist abuse. Fringe anti-immigration groups falsely claim these candidates are part of a power grab, also alleging that non-citizens can vote in elections. The Immigrant Council of Ireland reports threats, vandalism, and public confrontations.\n\nAt the same time, a recurring false story in Spain re-emerged claiming that Volt, a registered political party since 2019, is a ‚Äúfake party‚Äù designed to confuse voters or divert votes from Vox, allegedly because its symbol is placed near Vox‚Äôs one on the ballots. These claims are baseless: Volt, a pan-European party, has participated in multiple elections and the placement of ballots follows an order based on the submission of candidacies.\n\nü§ñ üìπ Deepfake video falsely attributes statements to US State Department official about the war in Ukraine. In Greece, a video altered using AI tools falsely attributed statements to U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, claiming he justified a Ukrainian attack on Belgorod by stating there were no civilians in the city. The video, which manipulated a press conference about the Israel-Hamas conflict, has been debunked by multiple sources, including Russian ones. A similar false story ‚Äì using the same tactic to allege that a White House spokesperson talked about why the US supports Nazism in Ukraine ‚Äì was one of the most widespread false stories in the EU in May.\n\nIf you have suggestions, comments or requests about this newsletter, you can write to [email protected]\n\nWhat is a ‚Äúdisinformation narrative‚Äù? Please find here a short methodological note about the definition used by the EDMO fact-checking network.\n\nThe Disinfo Bulletin gathers material from the inputs of the EDMO fact-checking network, as well as a recently launched public database from the EFCSN network (Elections 24 Check), and the various national EDMO hubs, including community initiatives and insights from individual fact-checking organizations.\n\nWelcome to Disinfo Bulletin, your daily update from the EDMO network. Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüó≥Ô∏è The false claim that low voter turnout triggers the ‚ÄúEU Exit‚Äù referendum. In Italy, a false claim is going around on Facebook and TikTok, suggesting that the basic laws of the Union mandate a referendum for an immediate exit from the EU in case of low voter turnout in the European elections. This is untrue: no European treaty contains such a provision. The false claim urges people not to vote in the upcoming elections on June 8-9 in Italy.\n\nThis is in line with the false stories flagged in previous issues of this Bulletin, circulating in Germany and Spain and encouraging citizens to engage in practices that would invalidate their votes. In this case, the false content about the electoral process directly promotes abstentionism by leveraging nationalistic sentiments.\n\nüåç The EDMO monthly brief on disinformation detected in May is out. According to information provided by 34 fact-checking organizations that contributed to this edition, the main topics of disinformation in April were the EU ‚Äì 15% of the total detected disinformation items, the highest value since the dedicated monitoring began ‚Äì, Ukraine (8%) and the conflict in the Middle East (9%).\n\nThe main disinformation phenomenon detected during last month was the further rise of disinformation about the EU, which resulted in the related percentage being the highest share among the topics constantly monitored by EDMO for the second month in a row.\n\nFalse narratives portraying the EU as corrupt and the elections as rigged;\n\nDisinformation stories describing the EU as opposed to the various national interests.\n\nYou can read the full brief here: Monthly brief no. 36 ‚Äì EDMO fact-checking network.\n\nüåê Russian disinformation network Pravda shifts strategy ahead of EU elections. A new analysis by the EDMO fact-checking network reveals that the Russian Pravda disinformation network ‚Äì about which EDMO published a dedicated investigation in late April ‚Äì is adopting new tactics to influence EU public opinion just days before the elections. Pravda launched new websites with slightly altered URLs, targeting audiences in multiple EU languages. These websites, registered in Russia, spread Russian propaganda or demonstrably false news, and amplify the claims of minor pro-Russia politicians running for the EU elections. Read the full analysis here: Russian disinformation network ‚ÄúPravda‚Äù tries a new route to influence EU public opinions few days ahead of the vote.\n\nüéØ Check out the latest issue of the EDMO Weekly Insights and Early Warnings ahead of the EU elections. This week‚Äôs edition looks at disinformation narratives about major topics targeted by false stories, such as migration and the alleged escalation of the war in Ukraine. It also includes early warnings on what kind of harmful content to expect during election days, including disinformation about the EU electoral process, sensationalist content, and the risk of deepfake audio emerging while EU citizens cast their ballots.

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nü™ñ False stories inciting fear of attacks on EU soil. In line with the false narrative exaggerating the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine and the direct involvement of EU member states in the war in Ukraine, similar false stories suggested that a direct attack against the EU is being prepared by Russia. In Greece, it was claimed that the country is one of the targets of nuclear attacks by Russia; in Italy, that China would declare war on NATO if its member countries directly attacked Russia; and in Portugal, a video purported to show nuclear weapons mobilized by the Kremlin to target Western countries after the statements of French President Emmanuel Macron about sending troops to the invaded nation. All these claims are false or misleading, but they attempt to capitalize on fears of a possible escalation of the war, a tactic used by the Kremlin since the early stages of the conflict.\n\nü§ñ How AI is exploited to disinform in political campaigns. A recent report by ADMO, the EDMO hub covering Croatia and Slovenia, analyzed how generative AI was used to produce disinformation during the 2024 Croatian parliamentary election campaign and shortly thereafter. The analysis revealed that the primary social media platforms involved were TikTok and X and the content targeted the Croatian political elite. According to the report, the impact of the AI-generated disinformation on the election results was minimal, but it demonstrated the potential of this technology to influence politics. The full report can be found here: Generative AI Use and Disinformation during the Croatian Parliament Elections 2024.\n\nüåê ü§¨ Sweden‚Äôs largest populist party embroiled in trolling scandal ahead of EU elections. Over the last weeks, a scandal has been uncovered at the highest levels of the communication division of the Swedish right-wing populist party Sweden Democrats (SD). Swedish broadcaster TV4 revealed that the party has effectively run secret accounts with which it attempted to manipulate public opinion. Moreover, one of the central figures in the trolling campaigns has been exposed as pro-Putin, supporting Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine. This scandal comes at a critical time before the EU elections, endangering the fragile government coalition in Sweden, known as Tid√∂avtalet, where SD supports the center-right government. Read the full investigation by TV4 here: Kalla faktas coverage of SD‚Äôs troll factory.\n\nA similar investigation was published a few days ago in Flanders, Belgium, by VRT NWS, the Dutch-speaking public broadcaster, whose fact-checking organization is part of the EDMO network. VRT NWS revealed that members of the Flemish right-wing party Vlaams Belang have been using ‚Äúshadow accounts‚Äù on TikTok to subtly spread their views without clearly declaring their party affiliation. According to the article, these accounts belong to lesser-known candidates and party employees, with experts noting that personal attacks on other politicians are more evident here than on official channels.

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüá™üá∫ üìà EU-related disinformation surged to its highest level in May since EDMO began dedicated monitoring. According to preliminary findings of the new EDMO Brief, which will be published on June 6, disinformation on EU policies or targeting its institutions amounted to around 15% of the total detected disinformation in May, the month before the EU elections. After the peak measured in April, the amount of EU-related disinformation has further increased, resulting in the highest value since our dedicated monitoring began in May 2023 and the highest percentage among the topics constantly monitored by EDMO for the second month in a row.\n\nüö∂üèΩ üó≥Ô∏è Preelection Disinformation: Politicians spreading false narratives about Migration and Asylum Pact. A recent analysis by EURACTIV Slovakia shows that several politicians are spreading false narratives about the new EU Migration Pact in their pre-election campaigns. Analyzing the most impactful posts on social media, EURACTIV found that certain politicians falsely claimed, for example, that Slovakia will have to manage millions of migrants or misrepresented the pact‚Äôs provisions. Other popular claims on social media incorrectly state that Slovakia will have to forcibly accept migrants without any choice. According to EURACTIV, which will publish further reports on disinformation promoted by politicians in the country, such misleading statements are designed to incite fear and mistrust among voters ahead of the vote.

In addition, these days, false stories in the path of well-known disinformation narratives (e.g. claiming that migrants are violent or privileged) are being tracked in various EU countries and sometimes exploited on the political side.\n\nü™Ü Operation Matrioska: how a Russian campaign targets fact-checkers worldwide. A recent article by EFE Verifica ‚Äì a Spanish fact-checking organization part of the EDMO network ‚Äì reports that a pro-Russian operation, called Operation Matrioska, has been attempting to manipulate fact-checkers globally, including those at EFE Verifica. The campaign consisted of creating numerous social media accounts and sending fake emails to distract media and fact-checkers from real disinformation. The fake requests included verifying unfounded claims about Ukraine, NATO, and other sensitive topics, sometimes impersonating accredited media outlets. The primary goal appears to be to waste the time and resources of journalists and fact-checkers, distorting their attention and undermining their ability to effectively combat disinformation.

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüßë‚Äçüåæ üá™üá∫ How mis/disinformation about the 2024 farmers‚Äô protests shaped public opinion. A recent report published by Newtral and Science Feedback ‚Äì in the context of an EFCSN project called Climate Facts ‚Äì details how various actors weaponized the 2024 farmers‚Äô protests in Europe to spread disinformation about climate and undermine climate action. The study reveals that far-right politicians were behind 81.6% of the most popular anti-climate action posts, which included false claims about the EU promoting lab-grown meat and destroying water infrastructure. According to the report, these narratives resonated deeply, attracting three times more interactions than broader anti-climate sentiments, and significantly influenced public opinion, fueling distrust towards the EU and inducing EU and national institutions to backtrack on climate measures.

According to analyses from local fact-checking organizations, the two countries are highly susceptible to Kremlin disinformation due to a combination of factors, and share several similarities. Both countries have seen active Russian propaganda exploiting existing conspiracy theories and skepticism towards Western policies, concerning for example the vaccination campaign and, after the Russian invasion, the war in Ukraine.\n\nLocal journalists report that political figures and mainstream media in both nations often echo Kremlin narratives, legitimizing disinformation narratives. Moreover, societal attitudes, influenced by past Soviet ties and current economic challenges, contribute to a fertile ground for Russian disinformation campaigns, particularly around polarizing topics.

A series of books titled Rhetoric of the LGBT Movement in Light of Scientific Facts by Wiktor Lysov has been recently published by Polish publisher 3DOM and labeled as bestsellers by the publisher itself. According to an investigation by Pravda ‚Äì a fact-checking organization part of the EDMO network ‚Äì the series is being used by Russian propaganda targeting LGBTQ+ issues and Lysov is likely a fictitious author used for the purpose, whose name appears to be linked to a Russian organization known for spreading anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and conspiracy theories. Pravda points out that the book‚Äôs claims are unscientific, citing outdated and biased sources. Read the full text of the investigation here: Bestsellerowy pisarz, kt√≥ry‚Ä¶ nie istnieje?

Recently, social media posts in various EU countries have falsely claimed that Germany has decriminalized child pornography. In fact, the German government amended its laws to make them more flexible and to avoid penalizing those who report such content or come across it unintentionally. The modification reduces minimum sentences but maintains severe penalties for serious offenses.\n\nThe law has been targeted by disinformation of this kind since its proposal and false claims are being recently recirculated in order to portray German politicians as pedophiles, a tactic also used against Ukrainian leadership. The false story was detected in: EL, ES, FR, HR, BG, and even outside the EU.\n\nIf you have suggestions, comments or requests about this newsletter, you can write to [email protected]\n\nWhat is a ‚Äúdisinformation narrative‚Äù?

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nü™ñ üá™üá∫ The false story about the bodies of French soldiers returning to the country after their alleged death in Ukraine. An old image recently circulating on social media, including Facebook and X, has been recaptioned in French with false claims that it shows French soldiers killed by Russian forces in Ukraine. In fact, the photo depicts the coffins of 13 French soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali in 2019. The false story is consistent with a widespread false narrative alleging the direct involvement of EU countries‚Äô armies in ground operations in Ukraine, which has been one of the major disinformation incidents in the last months throughout the EU. Other baseless claims circulated in recent weeks on this topic often used old or unrelated content purporting to show EU troops on the battlefield or their bodies being brought back after allegedly being killed in military operations in Ukraine.\n\nüó≥Ô∏è üá™üá∏ Disinformation about the EU electoral process was also detected in Spain. After the recent cases in Germany, false claims have been recently identified in Spain that marking percentages for parties on ballots is a valid method of ‚Äúdouble voting‚Äù in the upcoming European elections. These claims are false and similar to those debunked in Germany, aimed at encouraging people to write strange marks on the ballots, thus invalidating the votes and their legitimate choices.\n\nü§ñ OpenAI reveals covert influence campaigns by Russia and China using its AI technology. In a report published on May 30, OpenAI ‚Äì the company that owns ChatGPT, the most popular chatbot ‚Äì disclosed that its AI tools were exploited by state actors from Russia, China, Iran, and Israel in covert online influence campaigns. These campaigns used AI text- and image-generation tools to generate social media posts, translate and edit articles, set up chatbots on Telegram, and support geopolitical narratives. However, the campaigns struggled to gain significant traction, according to OpenAI.\n\n‚ÄúPeople acting on behalf of Doppelganger used our models to generate comments in English, French, German, Italian and Polish that were posted on X and 9GAG; translate and edit articles in English and French that were posted on websites linked to this operation; generate headlines; and convert news articles into Facebook posts‚Äù, the tech company says. This marks the first disclosure by a major AI company of its tools being used in such operations, highlighting concerns about AI‚Äôs role in online disinformation.

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüåç Disinformation stories and narratives about climate change circulating in the weeks ahead of the June vote. Climate change is one of the topics most targeted by disinformation, and this is true also during the EU election campaign. In recent weeks, several false stories circulated that tried to deny the impact of human activity on the climate as well as the existence of the climate crisis itself, following the scheme of classic denialism. However, most of the stories proven to be false or misleading by independent fact-checking organizations seem to follow the pattern of the so-called New Denial, targeting electric vehicles, renewable energy sources and other countermeasures to global warming, portraying them as dangerous, more polluting than internal engine vehicles, or unreasonable. In Germany, it was also recently claimed that France had declared illegal the construction of wind turbines, a false claim in line with others identified in some EU countries in early 2024.\n\nIn some cases, allegations degenerate into conspiracy theories, such as claims that natural disasters are deliberately caused to simulate climate change or to impose new lockdowns.\n\n‚ôä Disinformation campaign attributes fake quotes about Ukraine to celebrities. According to GADMO, the EDMO Hub covering Germany and Austria, a recent disinformation campaign has circulated on social media with fake quotes about the Ukraine war attributed to German celebrities, like Rammstein singer Till Lindemann or actor Til Schweiger. These false quotes appear mostly aimed at undermining EU support for Ukraine. The German Federal Ministry of the Interior links them to the Russian ‚ÄúDoppelg√§nger‚Äù operation, known for imitating websites of credible media outlets and public institutions.\n\nThe fake celebrity quotes have been found as paid posts in Facebook‚Äôs ad library, targeting users in Germany. GADMO reports that Meta did not comment in detail on the ads, but referred to its previous actions against what it defines as ‚Äúthe largest and most aggressive ongoing Russian influence operation‚Äù. This comes at a time shortly after the EU announced to investigate Meta for potential violations related to handling political advertising.

A recent experiment by Correctiv ‚Äì an investigative and fact-checking organization part of the EDMO network ‚Äì revealed that three of the most used chatbots (Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and ChatGPT) fail to provide accurate answers to political questions, especially about the upcoming EU elections. The chatbots either fabricate information, recommend non-existent Telegram channels, or provide incorrect details about candidates. For instance, none of them correctly identified the German front-runners for the EU elections, and in some cases, they even suggested content from far-right sources. Read the full report here: Chatbots: Don‚Äôt Bother Asking AI About the EU Elections.\n\nAnother recent experiment conducted by the New York Times explored how easy it is to train a chatbot to create and spread disinformation online at scale.

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüö∂ Disinformation stories and narratives about migrants circulating in the weeks ahead of the June vote. Although not the most prominent in numbers, disinformation about migration is a constant phenomenon also observed during the EU elections campaign, especially in countries more exposed to migratory paths. In Spain and Italy, for example, migrants are constantly targeted by false stories portraying them as violent or criminal and opposed to the Western way of living, and sometimes urging for ‚Äúmassive deportations‚Äù. At the same time, disinformation content often suggests that these groups of people, as migrants, are entitled to various benefits, while EU institutions are described as willing to permit uncontrolled immigration, with the apparent goal to politically capitalize on the xenophobic messages spread by false narratives.\n\nTo this end, false stories exaggerating the anti-immigration sentiment are also significant. This recently happened in Ireland, in the context of a wave of protests against the housing of asylum seekers, with false stories exaggerating the scale of the rallies and exploiting social tensions around the issue. But this is not the only recent case, as the point below further shows.\n\nüë®üèº‚Äçüíº üáµüá± An example of how these narratives are used to target the government in Poland, one of the most sensitive countries to the issue of migration. Polish PM Donald Tusk pledged an investment of 10 billion z≈Çotys (‚Ç¨2.3 billion) to enhance security at the border between Poland and Belarus. For years the issue of migration has held the center stage of Polish political consciousness, and battles between Minsk and Warsaw over the flow of migrants across the border have in turn led to a disinformation storm. Far-right groups in Poland are contributing to the spreading of pro-Kremlin, anti-migrant disinformation, and recently Donald Tusk has been targeted by disinformation alleging his approval of the new EU Pact on migration, while Polish legislation is generally restrictive towards new migrants. In such a context, attempts to frame Tusk as soft on migration are meant to discredit him with voters and influence public opinion ahead of the elections.\n\nüì± üáÆüá™ Anonymous accounts on X target Irish politics. An investigation published on May 27 by The Journal FactCheck, a fact-checking organization part of the EDMO network, reveals how over 150 anonymous social media accounts on X, posing as Irish users, are targeting politicians, journalists, and news outlets with extreme views. These accounts, potentially part of an influence operation, are spreading divisive content on topics like immigration, LGBTQ+ issues, and the Ukraine war ahead of the European and local elections in June.\n\nThe accounts often exhibit signs of being operated by non-Irish users and have been linked to similar tactics seen globally, raising concerns about foreign interference in Ireland‚Äôs political discourse at such a crucial moment. Read the full investigation here: The disinfluencers: How over 150 anonymous ‚ÄòIrish‚Äô accounts are swamping X with extreme views.\n\nIf you have suggestions, comments or requests about this newsletter, you can write to [email protected]\n\nWhat is a ‚Äúdisinformation narrative‚Äù?

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüó≥Ô∏è üá©üá™ Disinformation about the electoral process persists in Germany. A recent false claim in the country suggests that the vote count for the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) will follow stricter rules and will be invalidated if the mark on the ballot crosses a designated circle on the ballot paper. In fact, according to the Federal Returning Office, such restrictions do not exist and the only condition for a valid vote is that the mark on the ballot clearly indicates the will of the voter.\n\nThis unproven claim has been circulating for years and it is consistent with false stories recently identified in the country questioning the fairness of the EU election process, already reported in previous issues of this newsletter.\n\nüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà Recognizing LGBTQ+ rights: somewhere denied, somewhere not needed, according to disinformation. As Pride Month approaches, as well as the elections, disinformation content about LGBTQ+ issues may increase in the coming weeks. In recent days, a couple of false stories circulated, trying with different arguments to undermine support for this minority. In Spain, for example, an old and modified video has been used to suggest that legislation to assure LGBTQ+ rights is unnecessary, since homosexuals would not be discriminated against. In Poland, on the contrary, a post on X impersonating a member of the Parliament announced the alleged banning of LGBTQ+ communities and organizations.\n\nü§ñ AI disinforms better than humans. Research published in mid-2023 on the academic journal Science shows how disinformation content generated by Large Language Models, such as GPT-3, is more convincing and harder to distinguish from human-written disinformation content. The study involved 697 participants evaluating tweets on various topics, including vaccines and COVID-19. The results revealed that GPT-3-generated disinformation was perceived as accurate more frequently than human-generated disinformation. Furthermore, participants struggled to differentiate between AI-generated and human-generated tweets.\n\nThe study also explored the so-called ‚Äúresignation theory‚Äù, where people feel powerless against mis/disinformation, potentially leading to decreased trust in information and increased spread of false content, as individuals may stop trying to discern truth from falsehood.

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüá™üá∫ üçå False stories portraying EU membership as disadvantageous. In recent days, false stories ‚Äì of a kind already flagged in this bulletin ‚Äì about the EU imposing totally unfair economic conditions and unreasonable bureaucracy on its member countries has been recirculated in various countries. Among the claims that have been proven false are that the introduction of the euro in Croatia led to a doubling of prices, that the European digital identity will discriminate against citizens, and that the European Central Bank is planning to introduce the Digital Euro for surveillance purposes.\n\nFalse stories also claimed that the EU even imposes the degree of curvature of bananas (in fact, it was a legislation proposed by trade associations), while Brussels is described as a city with an overwhelming majority of migrants from outside the EU.\n\nüá™üá∏ üá¶üá∑ Disinformation after the visit of Argentine President Javier Milei to Spain. While attending a recent far-right rally in Spain, Argentine president Javier Milei made comments about Bego√±a G√≥mez, the wife of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez, sparking a diplomatic clash. Milei insinuated that G√≥mez was ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù, after allegations about G√≥mez‚Äôs alleged ties to private companies receiving public contracts and funds. These allegations also originated a wave of false stories in late April targeting Gomez and S√°nchez‚Äôs decision to suspend his duties.\n\nLast week, after the diplomatic incident caused by Miley‚Äôs words, a new stream of disinformation targeted the issue and Prime Minister S√°nchez in particular. In addition to exaggerating Milei‚Äôs remarks, false stories claimed ongoing protests against S√°nchez and rallies in support of Milei. Exploiting diplomatic tensions, a fake post on X from S√°nchez defending his wife and a fake article about their separation were also circulated online.\n\nüí™ Strong European sentiment across the continent. 74% of Europeans feel they are EU citizens, according to the latest Standard Eurobarometer survey. The survey also reveals that 77% of European citizens support a common EU defense and security policy, while 71% believe in enhancing the EU‚Äôs military equipment production capacity. Additionally, 69% favor a unified foreign policy among member states.

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüá∏üá∞ üé•The false theories that the attempted assassination of Slovak PM Robert Fico is staged. Demagog.sk, a Slovak fact-checking organization part of the EDMO network, reports that in Slovakia several false claims are circulating about the shooting against PM Fico being staged. These allegations question the official version citing alleged inconsistencies, such as the absence of visible blood in the video, suggesting the use of blanks, and asserting that external groups orchestrated the attack. Demagog.sk has debunked these theories by providing expert insights and verifying facts, including the authenticity of the shooting, the validity of the rescue procedures, and the presence of videos from multiple angles capturing the event.\n\nRegarding the other false claims circulating on the issue, the most widespread so far appears to be the one about the wife of the shooter being Ukrainian or somehow tied to Ukraine, a false story pushed by Russian propaganda using tactics similar to those used last February in the case of the dissident Alexei Navalny‚Äôs death. This disinformation content has already been identified in: SK, ES, EL, IE, IT, BG, PL, CZ, LT, as well as outside the EU borders.\n\nüá©üá™ ü§ºFalse stories in Germany directly attacking political parties. Recently, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) has been the target of false stories suggesting its alleged offensive rhetoric or even Nazi sympathies. For example, a card with a quote from Kevin K√ºhnert, the General Secretary of the party, talking about ‚Äúfighting right-wing extremists‚Äù was doctored to suggest that he had said ‚Äúright-wing sexists‚Äù, implying that he had offended all conservative politicians or voters. Another out-of-context and falsified image was re-shared as showing an SPD campaign poster inspired by the Nazi flag, in an attempt to link the party to Nazism.\n\nSimilar rhetoric has been used in recent months in disinformation content targeting several other German and European politicians as well as NATO, with disinformation content suggesting that its headquarters are inspired by the SS symbol.\n\nüéØ Check out the latest issue of the EDMO Weekly Insights and Early Warnings ahead of the June elections.

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüáÆüá∑ False stories about international reactions to the death of the Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi. Adding to the conspiracy theories circulating on the issue, including one suggesting that Raisi is actually alive, false stories about the Iranian president‚Äôs death also concern alleged grief or celebration expressed by international figures after the crash of his helicopter. In Spain, a false story is circulating that Putin personally traveled to Iran to attend Raisi‚Äôs funeral, while a doctored video circulating in the country purports to show the Israeli ambassador to the UN celebrating Raisi‚Äôs death.\n\nüó≥Ô∏è üá©üá™ False information about the EU electoral process pushing citizens to invalidate their vote in Germany. Following the already mentioned false story that EU ballots are invalid ‚Äì allegedly because of holes and cut corners, which actually facilitate citizens with disabilities to vote ‚Äì other false stories circulating in Germany concern the EU electoral process. On TikTik and X, posts are suggesting that multiple voting and multiple marks on the ballots are allowed or asking citizens to sign the ballot to prevent voter fraud. In fact, these false claims are trying to induce citizens to invalidate their legitimate choices, since both of these practices make the votes invalid.\n\n‚ò¶Ô∏è üá∑üá∫ How the Kremlin weaponizes religion within EU borders. Greece Fact Check, an organization part of the EDMO fact-checking network, published last week an analysis of how the Kremlin leverages religion for propaganda and disinformation about the war against Ukraine in Greece.\n\nBy framing the Ukraine conflict as a holy war, Russian state media and officials manipulate religious sentiments to garner support and justify their actions. This strategy is particularly effective in Greece, where disinformation leverages religious connections to sow discord, foster pro-Russian and anti-Western sentiment (for example, by playing on prejudices around LGBTQ+ issues), and undermine support for Ukraine, demonstrating a sophisticated use of cultural ties to achieve geopolitical goals.

A few hours later the news of Raisi‚Äôs death in a helicopter crash, unproven information started circulating in various European countries. False claims used images purporting to show the helicopter the Iran president was traveling on. A significant false claim has been tracked in Poland linking what so far is described by most media as an incident with alleged US actions, part of a conspiracy that also suggests US responsibilities in the attempted assassination of the Slovak PM Robert Fico ‚Äì alleging a coordinated effort by the US to eliminate leaders opposing its hegemony. Such claims are unproven and official sources have not reported any evidence of sabotage.\n\nüé§ üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà False stories steering hate against LGBTQ+ community. In recent days, in Italy, a false claim stated that the colorful rainbow flag was chosen by the LGBTQ+ community to attract children, consistent with the disinformation narrative that tries to link LGBTQ+ people to pedophilia.\n\nOther recent unfounded claims leveraging anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment have exploited the media attention on the Eurovision Song Contest. For example, a false story compared an alleged photo of the winners of Eurovision 2024 to one of the 1974 winners, ABBA. The alleged photo of the 2024 winners was actually AI-generated to portray the song contest as decadent and corrupt. In addition, the actual winner, who identifies as non-binary, was falsely accused of wearing Satanic symbols.\n\nüîç üá™üá∏ üáµüáπ Needs and challenges for Iberian fact-checkers.

Aside from the disinformation narratives about the pandemic, still circulating in the infosphere as already mentioned in this newsletter, a new wave of false stories surged after AstraZeneca withdrew its vaccine from the market. The main reason cited for the withdrawal was competition from more effective vaccines, but false stories claim that the European Medicines Agency had actually unilaterally banned AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine because shots were allegedly dangerous or could cause death, side effects and serious illness.\n\nRecently, other stories verified as false by independent fact-checking organizations also alleged a deeper involvement of the EU in alleged manipulations about vaccines. False stories circulated in recent days suggest, for example, that the EU Parliament censors discussions about vaccination or that a vaccination certificate will be required to vote in the upcoming EU elections.\n\n‚öñÔ∏è Early Warning ‚Äì ICC warrants for Netanyahu and Hamas leaders. The International Criminal Court prosecutor‚Äôs request for arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leaders over alleged war crimes is expected to spark significant disinformation. Since the war in the Middle East is one of the most polarizing issues of the international debate, this news is likely to fuel false narratives and misleading content, potentially exacerbating tensions and divisions within Europe and globally. Disinformation could exploit this situation to further polarize opinions.\n\nFalse narratives could include exaggerations of the ICC‚Äôs findings, false claims of international conspiracies or the demonization of the two sides in the war (as it happened in the first phase of the conflict). The legality and implications of the ICC‚Äôs decisions could also be targeted.\n\nüåç The EDMO monthly brief on disinformation detected in April is out. According to information provided by 36 fact-checking organizations that contributed to this edition, the main topics of disinformation in April were the EU (11% of the total detected disinformation items, the highest value since the dedicated monitoring began), climate change (11%), Ukraine (10%) and the conflict in the Middle East (10%).\n\nThe main disinformation phenomenon detected during last month was the rise of disinformation about the EU, e.g.:\n\nFalse stories about the alleged direct involvement of EU countries in ground operations in Ukraine or the escalation of the war;\n\nMisleading information and conspiracies about EU policies and laws, especially those aimed at countering the effects of climate change.\n\nYou can read the full brief here: Monthly brief no. 35 ‚Äì EDMO fact-checking network\n\nIf you have suggestions, comments or requests about this newsletter, you can write to [email protected]\n\nWhat is a ‚Äúdisinformation narrative‚Äù?

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüá∏üá∞ Disinformation about Fico‚Äôs shooting in Slovakia grows. After accusingthe main opposition party of endorsing the attempted killing, false stories about the attack on PM Robert Fico continue to grow in Slovakia. In recent days, unproven claims have been made that the shooter is tied to the Progressive Slovakia party (linking him also to the EU and the LGBTQ+ movement), that he is a former member of the communist state‚Äôs intelligence service, or suggested that his violent act was concerted with other people, rather than the violence of a ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù, as local authorities currently described him.\n\nAt the same time, the attacker‚Äôs wife was said to be a Ukrainian refugee, even if police denied her alleged Ukrainian origin at a press conference. Aside from these false stories, observers say that the already toxic Slovakian political climate has worsened after the assassination attempt.\n\nüáÆüá∑ üõ©Ô∏è Early warning ‚Äì Iranian President Raisi‚Äôs helicopter crash. Following the reported death of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash on May 20, disinformation is likely to exploit this event. False narratives may emerge, connecting the crash to the broader Middle Eastern conflict without proof, inciting fears of escalation and fostering conspiracy theories. Preliminary findings from the EDMO Monthly Brief, which will be published tomorrow, show that disinformation regarding the crisis in the region tripled in April, mainly due to false stories exaggerating the scale of the attacks exchanged between Israel and Iran itself. This incident could further fuel the dissemination of misleading content.\n\nüáµüá± üöì üî• The false story that Germany is occupying Poland. After the already flagged false story alleging that Polish authorities were conceding lands to Germany, another false claim in Poland suggests similar attempts by the German neighbors. Recently, a photo of a ‚ÄúGerman police car‚Äù (in fact, part of a joint German-Polish police unit) circulated along with claims saying that ‚Äúthe German occupation has returned‚Äù or ‚ÄúGerman police are officially maintaining order‚Äù in Poland.\n\nAt the same time, other disinformation content circulated in the country in recent days alleged that ‚Äúthe European Commission confirmed that the Polish government established the superiority of EU law over Polish law‚Äù, so that ‚ÄúPoland will no longer exist‚Äù. Other unproven claims even suggested that recent fires in the country were deliberately started to distract attention from these issues.\n\nüîéüá™üá∫ V4 citizens‚Äô concerns about election interference. More than 1/3 of the population of all the four Visegrad Group countries (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary) consider attempts by foreign actors to influence European elections a major issue, according to CEDMO‚Äôs latest brief. Czech respondents showed the highest concern, reflecting lower institutional trust compared to other European nations. Poles expressed the highest intent to vote, with 78% planning to participate in the upcoming elections. Read more in this CEDMO‚Äôs special brief: More than a third of the citizens of the V4 countries perceive foreign attempts to influence European elections as a big problem.\n\nIf you have suggestions, comments or requests about this newsletter, you can write to [email protected]\n\nWhat is a ‚Äúdisinformation narrative‚Äù?

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüá∏üá∞ The May 15 assassination attempt on Slovak PM Robert Fico has already created a storm of dangerous, false narratives. One of the first to circulate was afake image of the shooter portrayed as interacting with Martin ≈†imeƒçka, journalist and father of the co-founder of Slovakia‚Äôs main opposition party. This was quickly exposed as false information and flagged as such by Meta. But another debunked false story has already emerged in the country, claiming that the main opposition party endorses the violent act, instead of condemning it. However, these are not the only unfounded claims circulating about the tragic event.\n\nIn other EU countries ‚Äì aside from the false story alleging his death ‚Äì fact-checking organizations are reporting a surge of anti-vaccines, anti-Ukrainian, and anti-Semitic conspiracy theories about the attempted assassination. Some unproven claims allege that Ukrainian intelligence services are behind the shooting, while others suggest motives tied to the WHO pandemic treaty or to George Soros. Alex Jones, a well-known conspiracist, shared a post on X soon after the shooting suggesting that NATO wants Fico‚Äôs death, another of the false narratives circulating on social media.\n\nAccounts dedicated to debunking disinformation have issued alerts regarding the potential impact of the dissemination of such disinformation on the already bitterly divided Slovak political landscape. The Slovak interior minister, Matus Sutaj Estok, stated: ‚ÄúWe are on the doorstep of a civil war. The assassination attempt on the prime minister is a confirmation of that‚Äù, adding ‚ÄúMany of you sowed hatred, and it turned into a storm‚Äù, addressing the media and ‚Äúhate-mongers‚Äù on social media.\n\nüïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßëüèª‚ÄçüíªTwo Moldovan brothers appear to be helping Russia to carry on cyberwarfare into Europe. On Thursday, an investigation by Correctiv ‚Äì a German investigative and fact-checking organization part of the EDMO network ‚Äì reported that two brothers from Moldova are providing IT infrastructure to support Russian cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns across Europe. Despite EU sanctions, their company, PQ Hosting, enables Russian hackers and propagandists to operate through EU-based servers, hiding their activities through complex corporate structures and shell companies, Correctiv reports. Read the full investigation here: Hacks und Propaganda: Zwei Br√ºder aus Moldau tragen Russlands digitalen Krieg nach Europa (in German).\n\nüî¶üí∏ Massive scam campaign on X exposed. Maldita.es, a Spanish fact-checking organization also part of the EDMO network, published an in-depth investigation on Thursday into a massive crypto scam promotion campaign that used X ads and blue checks to impersonate celebrities and media outlets. The research reveals that scammers garnered 76 million impressions on X from 165 paid ads in less than three months, reaching 38 million users. These ads likely violated Spanish law and X policies and employed cloaking techniques. Additionally, for 6 out of 10 posts, X‚Äôs DSA ads repository lacked the necessary information, and ‚ÄúX could be breaching its obligations under the Digital Services Act (DSA)‚Äù, the report says. Read a summary in English or the full report (in Spanish) here: 76 million attempts to scam you on X, using celebrities.\n\nüéØ Check out the latest issue of the EDMO Weekly Insights and Early Warnings ahead of the June elections. This week‚Äôs edition looks at several disinformation narratives, encompassing the alleged direct involvement of the EU in Ukraine, the pandemic, and narratives pushing xenophobia and Islamophobia. It also includes early warnings on what kind of disinformation to expect after the attempted assassination of Slovak PM Rober Fico, controversies about flags at the Eurovision Song Contest, and the disinformation about electoral integrity in the EU.

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüá∏üá∞ Early warning ‚Äì Robert Fico shooting. Following the shooting of Slovak prime minister Robert Fico, on May 15, it is very likely that disinformation will try to exploit the situation to convey different messages. Disinformation could have both a national and European dimension, connecting the attempted assassination to domestic elements or to international events. Considering the strong political polarization existing in Slovakia, disinformation will likely try to deepen and enlarge the divisions in the Slovakian society ahead of the EU elections and after. False news connecting the shooter with the opposition party, Progressive Slovakia, are already circulating online.\n\nüó≥Ô∏è üá™üá∫ The false story that the ballots for the EU elections are invalid. In Germany, a message spread on Telegram in early May claimed that ballots with holes or corners cut are invalid ‚Äúsince the beginning‚Äù, suggesting that the elections are useless or that the results will be tampered. In fact, these modifications, required by electoral regulations, help blind and visually impaired citizens to vote independently using special templates. The false claim used old and unrelated photos.\n\nIt is the first case of such disinformation directly regarding the EU elections detected by our network, but false stories about the electoral process have been the most common disinformation affecting national elections held in Europe in 2023, suggesting, for example, voter fraud, vote rigging, and vote tampering. This narrative included all sorts of false stories about voting procedures, and it is possible that it reemerges consistently as the EU elections get closer. Read here the report of the EDMO Task Force dedicated to the analysis of disinformation narratives identified during the 2023 EU elections in Council of Europe member states: Disinformation narratives during the 2023 elections in Europe.\n\n‚õìÔ∏è Other false stories that portray the EU as corrupted. The false story about the ballots came after other recent claims seeking to portray European institutions and procedures as unreasonable and dishonest. In Portugal, for example, a doctored image was circulated purporting to show Ursula von der Leyen, EU Commission president, being arrested in the European Parliament. In Hungary, the photo of an information panel on a public toilet ‚Äì explaining it was built thanks to EU funds ‚Äì was circulated claiming that the toilet itself cost 268 million Hungarian forints to build (in fact, the cost of the whole project), suggesting that money was being stolen or that EU procedures are absurd.\n\nüìä üá™üá∏ üáµüáπ Systematic analysis of disinformation in Spain and Portugal. IBERIFIER, the Edmo regional Hub covering the Iberian peninsula, issued a report exploring the spread and evolution of disinformation in Spain and Portugal, covering consumption forms, platforms, and narratives over four years. Findings show low levels of trust in the news in Spain, compared to Portugal‚Äôs higher trust levels. It is an analytical framework considering the wider societal impact of said phenomena at a social, cultural, political, geopolitical, and economic level, considering similarities and differences between the two countries.

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüá™üá∫ üìà In April, EU-related disinformation reached its highest level since EDMO‚Äôs dedicated monitoring began. According to preliminary findings of the new EDMO Brief, which will be published by the end of the week, disinformation on EU policies or targeting its institutions amounted to 11% of the total detected disinformation. The share is the highest percentage in April among the topics constantly monitored by EDMO, and the highest value for EU-related disinformation since our dedicated monitoring began in May 2023.\n\nüïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üí£ Espionage and bomb threats in Central Europe. Central European countries, particularly Poland and Slovakia, faced intensified threats last week. Poland reported a bugged cabinet meeting room. Though it is unclear exactly who planted the devices, or how long they have been there, these discoveries follow the uncovering of a suspected Russian spy network in March, and reportedly Russian cyber-attacks against Polish government networks in the first week of May.\n\nAt the same time, Slovakia experienced a wave of 1,000 bomb threats from a Russian email address, targeting schools, banks, and electrical stores, with the sender labeling these entities as ‚Äúenemies of Islam‚Äù. Slovak police are treating this as a terrorist act, which has caused significant psychological distress to the population.\n\nüìäüá™üá∫ Eurostat data service launched for European Elections. Eurostat has introduced a temporary data and fact-checking service to assist media and fact-checkers with European Union statistics and data inquiries, which will be operational until June 15, 2024. The service, which prioritizes election-related requests, promises to respond as quickly as possible and provide useful data within its databases in just one hour (but complex queries could take longer).

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüó≥Ô∏è üá™üá∏ Disinformation about the electoral process in the Catalan elections. On May 12, Catalonia held regional elections. Even before the voting was completed, false allegations of electoral fraud were circulated, alleging unfair practices in the voting process, as happened in all national elections examined in the Report on disinformation narratives during the 2023 elections in Europe, the first output of the EDMO Task Force on EU Elections.\n\nIn the case of the Catalan elections, false stories claim that certain candidates had offered money for votes, or that a railway breakdown in the region was due to sabotage to prevent trains from leaving and people from voting. Such a theory has been denied by local authorities, but it is similar to a false story circulated in the context of the Spanish national elections in the summer of 2023.\n\nüö© EDMO has flagged to X an account known for spreading disinformation. Following articles and reports of several fact-checking organizations within its fact-checking network, EDMO has formally flagged an X account named RadioGenoa to the platform, for spreading disinformation, mainly about migrants and other minorities. The RadioGenoa account has recently been the subject of a dedicated investigation by VRTNWS, and EDMO provided dozens of additional links to debunked content. Representatives of X welcomed the initiative and, after a week, provided some information about actions taken. EDMO thinks that those actions fell short of its expectations, among other reasons because they focused on some specific tweets provided as examples, and not on the account itself. The interlocution, however, is ongoing and EDMO will continue to monitor the evolution of the situation in the next stages.\n\nüèÉüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è üá™üá∫ BENEDMO launches a Fact Checking marathon for the EU elections. The initiative of the EDMO hub in Belgium and the Netherlands plans to bring together eight journalistic organizations for a fact-checking marathon in the run-up to the European elections. For ten days, a group of twenty fact-checkers will check politicians‚Äô claims full-time, using different formats such as articles, videos and podcasts to ensure wide accessibility and impact. Dutch, Flemish and French-speaking media are working together for the marathon.\n\nThe diverse coalition ‚Äì which includes public, private and academic sectors ‚Äì will operate from May 27 to June 9.

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüá™üá∫ üóûÔ∏è Special edition! What are the activities of EDMO beyond the Disinfo Bulletin one month before the vote? As you know, since you receive this newsletter daily, the EDMO Task Force on European Elections has launched it to report on major disinformation incidents and narratives detected ahead of the vote in June. But there are other efforts that the EDMO community is making to counter disinformation and inform the public in the context of the upcoming elections. Here are the other running initiatives‚Ä¶\n\nüö® Weekly Insights and Early Warnings. A publication analyzing disinformation narratives and trends linked to the EU elections (at national, regional, or European level) every week until the elections. The format also includes short textual early warnings about news and events potentially triggering disinformation in the run-up to the EU elections. The assessments contained in the first issues often succeeded in anticipating the development of disinformation narratives, as in the case of the foreseen amplification of the false narrative suggesting the direct involvement of EU countries in ground operations in Ukraine after the approval from the US Senate of a new military aid package to the invaded nation. Read all the issues here: Weekly Insights and Early Warnings.\n\nüóÇÔ∏è Public reporting. Reports and analyses on disinformation in general or specific techniques and narratives. For example, the first output of the TF was a report on Disinformation narratives during the 2023 elections in Europe, while a specific analysis was dedicated to Prebunking AI-generated disinformation ahead of EU elections.\n\nüìä Monthly Fact-Checking Briefs. Thanks to the contributions of the over 50 organizations within its fact-checking network, EDMO provides a brief overview of the major disinformation narratives circulating in the EU each month. Read all the issues here: EDMO Fact-Checking Briefs.\n\nüïµÔ∏è Investigations. Collaborative investigations are regularly produced as a result of joint analysis by members of the EDMO fact-checking network, providing insights on specific topics most targeted by disinformation. About the upcoming European elections, EDMO recently published a detailed investigation into the reach and impact of an extensive Russian disinformation campaign, conducted through a Russian network of copycat websites called ‚ÄúPravda‚Äù: Russian disinformation network ‚ÄúPravda‚Äù grew bigger in the EU, even after its uncovering. Read all the others here: EDMO Investigations.\n\nüìö Media literacy campaign. Additionally, thanks to the cooperative efforts of its 14 national or regional hubs covering the whole EU territory, EDMO is running the Be Election Smart Campaign, a media literacy campaign sharing tips to support citizens in finding reliable election information and recognizing false or manipulative content ahead of the 2024 European Parliament Elections.\n\nüóìÔ∏è The EDMO Week starts today. A series of events, meetings, discussions, and workshops are planned for this week in Brussels, involving the EDMO community at large, its national hubs, and the fact-checking network.

Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüá™üá∫ üó≥Ô∏è Special edition! What kind of disinformation is targeting the EU one month before the vote?\n\nDisinformation about the EU has been constantly monitored by EDMO since May 2023, when it started its dedicated monitoring efforts in its monthly briefs. As often highlighted, the main false narrative targeting the EU describes its institutions as authoritarian or corrupt, aiming to impose dangerous measures or unreasonable bureaucratic burdens on citizens‚Äô lives. But what kind of false narratives are targeting the EU a few weeks before the European Parliament elections of June 6-9?\n\nIn recent weeks, several false claims have spread unfounded or misleading information about European policies. In fact, except for trivial conspiracies, the most insidious false messages about the EU try to exaggerate the actual scope or distort the true objectives of its laws. The false claims range from highly defamatory ones ‚Äì such as that the European Digital Identity Wallet is a tool imposed to control bank deposits or that the approval of edible insects for human consumption is a way to force citizens to eat food containing insects ‚Äì to less serious but equally significant false stories. For example, the EU supposedly plans to severely restrict cash payments or ban air in potato chip packages.\n\nüîñ üåç In this context, one of the key issues targeted by disinformers is the legislation aimed at reducing the effects of climate change. The Green Deal legislation has been a major target of disinformation for a very long time, with false narratives recently leveraging anti-EU sentiment surrounding the farmers‚Äô protests. The most insidious false stories seek to instill fear about crucial issues in people‚Äôs lives. For example, falsely claiming that the EU wants to ban agriculture or that it will allow the member states to expropriate private homes and cars (or ban their repair), if they do not meet certain criteria. This kind of rhetoric is also being used by some politicians and in political manifestos in the run-up to EU elections.\n\nAt the same time, EU institutions are also claimed to blackmail member states to force some decisions, and in case of huge investments ‚Äì such as NextGenerationEU ‚Äì false claims allege they are hiding frauds for citizens. In Poland, for example, it was recently claimed that the money the country received for the recovery plan must be paid back at inflated exchange rates. Other false stories affect civil rights, while recently the false story has repeatedly emerged that the EU is planning to reintroduce the death penalty.\n\nüéØ Check out the latest issue of the EDMO Weekly Insights and Early Warnings ahead of the June elections. This week‚Äôs edition looks at disinformation portraying the alleged willingness of the EU to oppose agriculture and the rise in Islamophobic rhetoric. It also includes early warnings on what kind of disinformation to expect ahead of the recent developments in EU support for Ukraine and the withdrawal of AstraZeneca‚Äôs anti-Covid vaccine from the European market. Read the full text here: WEEKLY INSIGHTS and EARLY WARNINGS, n. 5.\n\nIf you have suggestions, comments or requests about this newsletter, you can write to [email protected]\n\nThis tool gathers material from the inputs of the EDMO fact-checking network, as well as a recently launched public database from the EFCSN network (Elections 24 Check), and the various national EDMO hubs, including community initiatives and insights from individual fact-checking organizations.\n\nWelcome to Disinfo Bulletin, your daily update from the EDMO network. Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüíâ Disinformation about the pandemic regains traction. Among the already signaled disinformation narratives about Covid-19 and vaccines, long-standing false narratives resurfaced in the last few days. In various countries, false claims are circulating that the UN warned of the arrival of a new pandemic, that anti-COVID vaccines were released before the disease broke out, or that some countries are withdrawing from the WHO. In Italy, it was claimed on May 4 that the EU Commission had revoked AstraZeneca‚Äôs authorization to market its vaccine.\n\nOn May 8 AstraZeneca then announced the actual withdrawal of its vaccine, due to a ‚Äúsurplus of available updated vaccines‚Äù. The main reason provided is that it has been made obsolete by the mRNA shots. No side effects have been reported other than those already known, but it is highly likely that the news of AstraZenecas‚Äôs decision will boost disinformation on the issue ahead of the EU elections. The false narrative about the alleged high dangerousness of vaccine shots has been one of the most prominent and pervasive disinformation narratives since the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\n‚õîÔ∏èüáµüá± The false theory that bilingual road signs in Poland mean that the country is giving away parts of its territory. In Poland, a video on TikTok falsely claims that Silesia ‚Äì a historical region of Central Europe that is mostly within the country, with small parts in the Czech Republic and Germany ‚Äì will have road signs in Silesian, Polish, and German due to a new law recognizing Silesian as a regional language. According to the video, this would prove that a part of the region will return under the control of Germany, as it was before WWII, to be repopulated with Ukrainian citizens and in an attempt to ‚Äúerase Poland‚Äù. However, the proposed law seeks to recognize Silesian as a regional language, allowing for bilingual signs in Silesian and Polish. It has nothing to do with Germany or the resettlement of Ukrainian refugees, as the video misleadingly suggests.\n\nüì∫ Fears of worsening state of media freedom and information in Slovakia. According to CEDMO, the local EDMO Hub, media freedom remains a concern in Slovakia following the passage of a draft bill to overhaul RTVS, the country‚Äôs public broadcaster, which also led to a strike of its journalists. In addition to these concerns, according to local and international media outlets, the possibility of the politician Luk√°≈° Machala becoming the new director of RTVS is particularly worrying. Machala is a former member of right-wing and far-right parties in Slovakia, and he is known for supporting conspiracy theories. In the past few days interview footage of him questioning the true shape of the Earth has been making the rounds on social and traditional media, but Machala spread less trivial and much more worrying falseness in the past, about Putin, Covid-19, Jews, and the Illuminati, and these conspiracy theories have recently resurfaced.\n\nIf you have suggestions, comments or requests about this newsletter, you can write to [email protected]\n\nThis tool gathers material from the inputs of the EDMO fact-checking network, as well as a recently launched public database from the EFCSN network (Elections 24 Check), and the various national EDMO hubs, including community initiatives and insights from individual fact-checking organizations.\n\nWelcome to Disinfo Bulletin, your daily update from the EDMO network. Today's most relevant stories:\n\nüïåüá™üá∏ The creation of the Catalan Islamic Emirate. With the Catalan elections scheduled for May 12, immigration is one of the main topics of political debate in the region, according to local fact-checking organizations. As reported previously in this newsletter, disinformation about the alleged willingness to Islamize the region is polluting social media and the public discourse. In this context, a political party, as part of its campaign, put up some road signs at the entrance of different cities, saying ‚ÄúWelcome to the Islamic Emirate of Catalonia‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo to Islamization‚Äù. Photos of these posters then circulated on social media, with users claiming that the signs were put there by migrant communities in the region, in an attempt to create an Islamic Emirate and reclaim the sovereignty of these cities.\n\nAt the same time, other false claims are circulating about alleged initiatives in other countries to counter the alleged Islamization. For example, the false stories that Switzerland is considering banning Islam in the country or that people are fleeing London after the re-election of Sadiqu Khan as mayor of the city.\n\nüë®üèº‚Äçüíº The false narratives portraying politician as dangerous for their own countries. In recent days, posts on TikTok in Poland suggested that Prime Minister Donald Tusk claimed that ‚ÄúPolishness is abnormal‚Äù. This quote was taken out of context from a decades-old article and spread by disinformation actors to discredit the politician and ‚Äúprove‚Äù a distasteful attitude toward his own country, framing him as an elite, establishment politician or a ‚Äúpuppet of the West‚Äù.\n\nIn Spain, disinformation about PM Pedro Sanchez continues to circulate, for example suggesting that The Guardian called him a ‚Äútoxic politician‚Äù.\n\nüí• CEDMO reports a pervasive impact of disinformation in Central Europe. According to the latest CEDMO Fact-checking brief (in Polish), which covers the first quarter of 2024, 45% of the population in the Czech Republic was exposed to disinformation narratives, while in Slovakia the number was even higher, around 58%. For the first time since August 2023, people in Slovakia reported encountering more false news than accurate information in March, the month in which the first round of the presidential election took place.\n\nIn Poland, the second edition of the report Disinformation Through the Eyes of Poles (in Polish) by Demagog Poland shows that up to 84% of Poles have encountered fake news, with false narratives ranging across all facets of society ‚Äì health, climate, technology, politics, and more ‚Äì and potentially serious implications on voting behavior and election outcomes.\n\nIf you have suggestions, comments or requests about this newsletter, you can write to [email protected]\n\nThis tool gathers material from the inputs of the EDMO fact-checking network, as well as a recently launched public database from the EFCSN network (Elections 24 Check), and the various national EDMO hubs, including community initiatives and insights from individual fact-checking organizations.\n\nWelcome to Disinfo Bulletin, your daily update from the EDMO network.

Recently, a widespread false story claims that a Ukrainian woman won the ‚ÄúWorld Sex Championship‚Äù, in line with the Russian narrative that tries to blame Ukrainians on the moral level, also using sexism and anti-LGBTQ+ stereotypes. The false story has spread mainly on Facebook, triggering a storm of offensive and anti-Ukraine comments. In fact, the ‚ÄúWorld Sex Championship‚Äù is a kind of reality show and the woman who won was Swedish.
