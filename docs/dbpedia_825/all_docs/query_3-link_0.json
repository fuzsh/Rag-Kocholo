        "text": "Global sports, events and talent management company\n\nIMG, originally known as the International Management Group, is a global sports, fashion, events and media company headquartered in New York City.[1] The company manages athletes and fashion celebrities; owns, operates and commercially represents live events; and is an independent producer and distributor of sports and entertainment media.[2] It has been owned by Endeavor since 2013.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIMG was founded in 1960 in Cleveland, Ohio by Mark McCormack, an American lawyer who spotted the potential for athletes to make large incomes from endorsement in the television age. He signed professional golfers Arnold Palmer, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus as his first clients who collectively are known as The Big Three.[3] McCormack died in 2003.[4]\n\nIn 2004, Forstmann Little, led by Theodore J. Forstmann, acquired the company; Forstmann served as chairman and CEO until his death in late 2011.\n\nOn June 1, 2006, IMG Media acquired Tiger Aspect Productions, the producer of the British television series Mr. Bean and the company, along with Darlow Smithson Productions (also acquired in 2006) later sold to Endemol in November 2009.[5][6][7]\n\nIn 2006, IMG Media acquired nunet AG,[8] a provider of mobile TV services to mobile network operators around the world. Clients of nunet's mobile TV CMS currently include: Vodafone, Proximus, Vodacom, Mobilkom A1. Content distributed currently includes MTV, Fashion TV, Eurosport, and Discovery Networks.\n\nIn November 2007, IMG acquired Kentucky-based Host Communications, which had multiple business units with services ranging from sports marketing and broadcasting to the management of associations and non-profit organizations. The sports-related businesses were combined with the Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC) to form IMG College, while the association management division was renamed IMG Associations.\n\nIMG was originally headquartered in downtown Cleveland in a complex built in 1965 across the street from Erieview Tower. When the IMG Center was built, it originally housed the Cuyahoga Saving Bank, which was acquired by Charter One Bank in 1998.\n\nIn 1997, IMG renovated the Cuyahoga Savings Bank Building and renamed it IMG Center. Following the acquisition of IMG by Forstmann Little, the headquarters remained in Cleveland, Ohio, for several years until officially relocating to its parent company's existing offices in New York, in 2010, though the IMG Center is still located on East Ninth Street in Cleveland.\n\nOn October 15, 2010, IMG acquired ISP, the multimedia rights holder for more than 50 universities based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. As a result of the acquisition, IMG College retained ISP's former headquarters in Winston-Salem.[9]\n\nOn December 18, 2013, IMG was acquired by William Morris Endeavor and Silver Lake Partners in a $2.4 billion deal to form WME-IMG.[10] WME's Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell served as co-CEOs.\n\nWME-IMG reorganized in October 2017 with the parent company being renamed from WME-IMG to Endeavor, and IMG and WME becoming subsidiaries of Endeavor. Ari Emanuel became Endeavor CEO and Patrick Whitesell became Endeavor executive chairman.[11]\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nIMG's Media Division produces, develops and executes multi-channel distribution strategies for federations, associations and events working with major global broadcasters, channels and platforms.

The 49-minute sports magazine programme airs in numerous countries around the world and is owned and distributed by IMG\n\nArchive\n\n[edit]\n\nIMG's Archive Services (previously IMG Replay) houses the largest sports archive platform with over 500,000 hours of content dating back over 120 years including event footage, highlights, interviews, ISOs and programming, available in 4K, 3D and HR=D.[14]\n\nIMG currently works with over 37 rightsholders helping to digitise, monetise and market their archive content including:\n\nATP Media\n\nCricket South Africa\n\nDeutsche Fußball Liga (Bundesliga and DFL-Supercup only)\n\nPGA European Tour\n\nWorld Athletics (Diamond League only)\n\nEuroleague Basketball\n\nFootball Federation Australia\n\nFrank Warren\n\nFIVB\n\nLPGA\n\nAugusta National Inc.\n\nFIM\n\nIOC\n\nANFP\n\nPBR\n\nPremier League Productions\n\nGiro d'Italia\n\nPGA of America (American Ryder Cup matches only)\n\nRyder Cup Europe (European matches only)\n\nKNVB (Eredivisie and Johan Cruyff Shield only)\n\nScottish Football Association (Scottish Cup only)\n\nLiga Portugal (Liga Portugal 1 only)\n\nThe Football Association\n\nThe R&A\n\nTrans World Sport\n\nUEFA (UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Super Cup only)\n\nUCI\n\nUFC\n\nUSTA (US Open only)\n\nWSM\n\nWTA\n\nAll England Lawn Tennis Club (The Championships, Wimbledon only)\n\nWorld Rugby\n\nWPBSA\n\nWTT\n\nIMG also supports brands, agencies and production studios in securing rights and clearance for archive content.[15]\n\nModels\n\n[edit]\n\nIMG Models is an international modelling agency headquartered in New York City and with additional offices in London, Los Angeles, Milan, Paris, and Sydney. It is a subsidiary of the talent management company International Management Group. The company merged with William Morris Endeavor in 2013. In 2015, the agency represented more than half of the highest-paid supermodels. Ivan Bart is the current President, and Lisa Marie Benson is the Vice President. [16]\n\nConsulting\n\n[edit]\n\nIMG's Consulting division works with rightsholders, and brands on commercial, marketing and sponsorship strategy. IMG's stadium and arena group works with leagues and franchises.\n\nIn Brazil, IMG worked with local affiliate IMM (former IMX), serving clients involved with the FIFA 2014 World Cup and the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\nJoint Ventures\n\n[edit]\n\nIMG operates joint ventures with key partners across many areas of the business.\n\nIn Brazil, China, India, and Turkey IMM (Brazil, former IMX), CC-TV IMG (China), IMG Reliance (India) and IMG Dogus (Turkey) develop sports, fashion and entertainment properties in their respective territories.\n\nIn 2015, IMG and Euroleague Basketball agreed on a ten-year joint venture.
