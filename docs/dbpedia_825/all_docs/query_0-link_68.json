        "text": "No matter your age, you probably always dreamed of being a contestant on your favorite game show. It’s easy (and fun!) to watch the games at home and live vicariously through the contestants. Viewers have gravitated to game shows as a real chance to win life-changing amounts of money. And if you’re not auditioning for your shot, it’s still exciting to root for everyday people in their experience.\n\nBut what makes a game show a success? The host plays a huge part. Some of today’s longest-running shows are especially popular because of hosts like Alex Trebek, Pat Sajak and Drew Carey. Their jokes and banter with contestants definitely add to the experience. And for the shows that aren’t on the air, we still have our favorite moments with Chuck Woolery and Marc Summers.\n\nEven though game shows were primarily in the daytime slots, they are now just as successful in primetime. New shows like The Wall, I Can See Your Voice and Ellen’s Game of Games are finding new fans. Today, nostalgia is definitely in and revivals are king. Some of our favorite classics, like The Weakest Link, are back on the air. We’ll keep our fingers crossed for more classics to find their way back to our homes. But in the meantime, let’s take a trip down memory lane and revisit these game shows that aren’t on our TVs anymore."
