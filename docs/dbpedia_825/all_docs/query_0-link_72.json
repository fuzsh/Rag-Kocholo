        "text": "PARIS (AP) â€” LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Steph Curry vs. Nikola Jokic is quite the matchup in the 2024 Olympics menâ€™s basketball semifinals Thursday. OK, itâ€™s really the United States vs. Serbia, but you get the idea. The other menâ€™s matchup features Victor Wembanyama and host France against Germany.\n\nThere will be plenty of attention on the purple stage at Stade de France, too, where the track and field highlights include 100-meter dash champion Noah Lyles of the U.S. trying to add the 200 gold medal to his collection and join such stars of the past as Usain Bolt and Carl Lewis, whoâ€™ve completed that sprint double at a single Summer Games.\n\nAnd an attention-grabbing matchup in the womenâ€™s 400-meter hurdles is part of the program, with reigning Olympic champion and world-record holder Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the U.S. and reigning world champion Femke Bol of the Netherlands going head to head for just the third time.\n\nSee the full schedule of events and read more on what to watch below:\n\nMenâ€™s basketball sets up the 2024 Olympics medal matchups\n\nWembanyama, the NBA Rookie of the Year for the San Antonio Spurs, is as fascinating a basketball player as has come along in years, and him playing for host France against World Cup champion Germany should be quite the scene in the opening semifinal, which starts at 5:30 p.m. CEST/11:30 a.m. EDT at Bercy Arena.\n\nThere will be superstars galore on the court for the second semifinal between the U.S. and Serbia, which is scheduled to tip off at 9 p.m. CEST/3 p.m. EDT.\n\nJokic, the NBA MVP three of the past four seasons for the Denver Nuggets, will face an American team thatâ€™s so strong itâ€™s impossible for coach Steve Kerr to offer everyone the number of minutes they might ordinarily expect or deserve.\n\nThe U.S. has its own list of past MVPs on the roster, including James, Durant, Curry and Joel Embiid, and is trying to make an 18th appearance in the gold-medal game in 20 Olympic appearances.\n\nThe winners of the two games will play for the gold on Saturday, when the two losing semifinalists will meet to determine who leaves France with the bronze.\n\nNoah Lyles and Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone try for more gold\n\nLyles won the 100 by five thousandths of a second â€” yes, thousandths â€” on Sunday night, and is a big favorite heading into the 200, his stronger event. Until coming in second to Letsile Tebogo of Botswana in a 200 semifinal Wednesday night â€” still good enough for the American to advance â€” Lyles hadnâ€™t lost a 200 anywhere since the Olympic final in Tokyo three years ago, when he wound up with a bronze.\n\nThe final for that event is scheduled for 8:30 p.m. CEST/2:30 p.m. EDT.\n\nA little less than an hour later, at 9:25 p.m. CEST/3:25 p.m. EDT, comes the other race everyone is excited about: McLaughlin-Levrone vs. Bol in a showdown between this generationâ€™s two top female hurdlers.\n\nBol already picked up a gold in Paris with a terrific last leg for the Dutch in the 4x400-meter mixed relay on Saturday.\n\nSo far, McLaughlin-Levrone is 2-0 against Bol, beating her at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, then again at 2022 world championships. The New Jersey-born McLaughlin-Levrone initially claimed the world record in the 400 hurdles in 2021, and then broke it four more times to get it to the current standard of 50.65, which occurred at the U.S. Olympic trials in June.\n\nA marathon Olympic swim in the Seine River is scheduled for Thursday\n\nMedals are supposed to be handed out Thursday after the womenâ€™s 10k marathon swim in the Seine River, where there has been daily testing to check whether the water is within acceptable guidelines for illness-causing bacteria.\n\nThe race starts at 7:30 a.m. CEST/1:30 a.m. EDT.\n\nAs it is, one test run in the Olympic open water course was canceled Tuesday, before the swimmers were given the go-ahead to dive in Wednesday.\n\nThe menâ€™s 10k marathon race is supposed to happen Friday.\n\n___"
