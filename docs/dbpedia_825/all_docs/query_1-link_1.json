Regular events included swimming, kayaking, volleyball, golf, tennis, bowling (on custom-made outdoor lanes), cycling, 3-on-3 football, the baseball dunk, running, and the obstacle course. Also featured as a regular event was a game of \"Simon Says\", directed by Catskill hotel Grossinger's entertainer Lou Goldstein.[1] Each network received points based on how it performed in the event.\n\nAfter the regular events were over, the lowest scoring network was eliminated from further competition and the two remaining networks determined the day's winner with a tug of war.\n\n2017[]\n\nDue to the fact that there are now tons of networks (broadcast & cable), the format was altered a bit.\n\nThis time there are just two teams (red & blue) of five celebrities arranged by category or genre. Each one has a celebrity coach. They competed in ten events, some of them carried over from the original. This time around, the events are worth a flat value, with one point awarded for the earlier events, five in the obstacle course and ten for the tug of war.\n\nClassic Matches[]\n\nNovember 13, 1976\n\nFebruary 28, 1977\n\nNovember 4, 1977\n\nMay 7, 1978\n\nNovember 18, 1978\n\nMay 7, 1979\n\nNovember 2, 1979\n\nMay 4, 1980\n\nDecember 5, 1980\n\nMay 8, 1981\n\nNovember 20, 1981\n\nMay 5, 1982\n\nOctober 1, 1982\n\nMay 4, 1983\n\nNovember 3, 1983\n\nMay 3, 1984\n\nDecember 20, 1984\n\nMay 23, 1985\n\nDecember 10, 1988\n\n2017[]\n\nHosts: Mike Greenberg & Joe Tessitore\n\nCo-Hosts: Cassidy Hubbarth & Cari Champion\n\nTeam Captains: Ronda Rousey & DeMarcus Ware\n\nFor team players, click here.\n\nEvents[]\n\nRunning Relay - 1 point\n\nSwimming Relay (2-on-2) - 1 point\n\nKayak Relay (2-on-2) - 1 point\n\nBaseball Dunk - 1 point/hit\n\nSoccer (target practice) - 1 point\n\nBasketball (3-point shooting) - 1 point\n\nTennis (service return) - 1 point\n\nArchery - 1 point\n\nGolf (closest to pin) - 1 point\n\nObstacle Course (women then men) - 5 points each\n\nTug-O-War - 10 point (a bonus of five can be added if the margin is more than 10 points)\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]\n\nSimilar Shows[]\n\nCelebrity Challenge of the Sexes\n\nStar Games\n\nSpinoff[]\n\nBattle of The Network Reality Stars\n\nBattle of the Gridiron Stars\n\nLink[]\n\nOfficial Site of the 2017 version"
