He’s a Surgeon, Educator, Speaker, Patient Advocate, Healthcare Futurist, and Immigrant- originally from Caracas, Venezuela. After doing his surgery residency in Ann Arbor, MI, USA, he developed as a General, Trauma, Advanced Laparoscopic and Robotic surgeon and now practices in the USA. His passion focuses on the intersection of innovation technology and healthcare. Throughout his career, he has focused on tapping the paradoxical power of technology to coexist with better, more humane medical care. As a healthcare futurist, being a full-time practicing surgeon, gives him the rare skills, qualities and advantages that clinicians have but most technology innovators lack. That duality of expertise makes him a voice that definitely should be heard. A voice that impacts and addresses both ends of the spectrum, diversifying the target audience, feeding multiple interests and curiosities.\n\nSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT‼️ We’re happy to announce our next speaker, Dr. Fernanda Kupferman, MD, FAAP.
