        "text": "Project IMG is bringing the comunity together!\n\nI had the chance to attend to the Miami 2024 IMG Project event, it was my first experience and I loved it. I want to thank Dr. Sebas and all the people that helped to create this space were IMGs can unit and support each other. I would love to attend the NY event!\n\nDate of experience : April 06, 2024\n\nBest IMG Conference Available!\n\nFor over 16 years, I have supported IMGs on their journey toward attaining medical residency in the U.S. During this time, I have not encountered an organization more devoted to supporting the international medical student community. They provide accessible platforms for networking, development, and career advancement that are unparalleled. I have attended two conferences and they were some of the best students conferences I have been to.\n\nDate of experience : April 05, 2024\n\nThe BEST organizations for IMGs all around the world!\n\nI have had the unique honor of not only being a part of the Project IMG and its sister organization, The IMG Event, but also being a committee member and executive organizer who was able to witness how much these organizations have grown since their inception. I can speak from first hand experience that Dr. Sebastian Arruarana, the Founder of both organizations, genuinely wants to help International Medical Graduates (IMGs) and tirelessly works hard to advocate for and create more opportunities for IMGs all around the world.\n\nProject IMG and The IMG Event form a comprehensive network, both online and in person, offering a sense of community, unity, and support for IMGs. Project IMG has diligently provided resources, information, and awareness about the USMLE journey and the MATCH process. Meanwhile, The IMG Event serves as a platform for IMGs from around the globe to connect, network, and engage with esteemed figures in the medical field, through events held nationally and internationally.\n\nTogether, these organizations address a large yet often overlooked population in the US medical education system: International Medical Graduates. Project IMG and The IMG Event are invaluable resources for any IMG seeking knowledge, connections, and the opportunity to advocate for others on the same journey.\n\nDate of experience : April 28, 2024\n\nEvent which is worth attending. ü•∞\n\nIt was really great experience interacting with Dr sebas and team. So many great speakers with so much information and motivation.\n\nI love how PIMG helping student like me to make their dream come true. Glad that I attended this event and in future if I get more chance to attend, I'll definitely go there one more time.\n\nThank you tema IMG and Dr. Sebas for organizing this event here in Philippines. Can't wait to see you all again. ü•≥\n\nStarting a long journey with big smile on my face! üòÉ\n\nDate of experience : April 21, 2023\n\n3 cheers for Dr Sebas and Dhruva (organizer from GMERS Vadodara and my vvv good friend)\n\nI loved the initiative of organizing a mega event such as an IMG meet up in a small town such as Vadodara, Gujarat. It gives the Indian IMG the much needed camaraderie and support to work towards their goal via this long and arduous journey. Seeing successful people and listening to their stories is just the boost of motivation we need. Love being a part of this community and loved volunteering for this event. Hoping to be a part of the organizing team next time!\n\nKudos to Dr Sebastian for bring us IMGs together ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nDate of experience : April 15, 2023\n\nThe IMG event transforms the journey of IMGs‚Ä¶\n\nThe IMG event transforms the journey of IMGs working to build their careers in the US. Thanks to these events, I have connected with amazing people from all over on this journey. It has provided guidance and a sense of community and this has helped motivate and inspire to continue despite all obstacles and challenges. 100% recommended to any IMG wanting to practice in the US!\n\nIt‚Äôs truly revolutionary\n\nDate of experience : March 18, 2023\n\nIMG event NY\n\nIf you‚Äôre an IMG and don‚Äôt know where you start or don‚Äôt have any connections, you need to attend this event! It‚Äôs the perfect way to network, hear others talk about their experiences and give you the motivation you need to prepare for match season. This is a great community to belong to.\n\nDate of experience : August 27, 2022\n\nHello everyone, I am Sanskruti Patel Final year UG at Smt. NHL MMC, Ahmedabad. Completed Step 1\n\nHello everyone. It was such an amazing event organised by the Project Img event team. I had the best opportunity of interaction with all the fellow members. It was worth attending this event, got my doubts cleared and learned so many new things. Looking forward to expand my IMGs network with all these people.\n\nDate of experience : April 15, 2023\n\nIMG Event: Philippines!\n\nI attended the IMG Event in Philippines on 22 April, 2023 for the first time, and it was such a great experience!\n\nIt felt great to have insights from doctors and students that have themselves cleared pathways that we plan on taking further! We found guidance and mentors yesterday, and I'm really grateful for that!\n\nThank you so much for this project, looking forward to attending many more such events in the future!\n\nDate of experience : April 22, 2023\n\nThe day I learnt so much...\n\nCan't be thankful enough to img event and project img for giving us this space to connect with people from different backgrounds, but running the same marathon.\n\nLearning about the ups and downs of this journey and how everyone is determined to make it to their dream residency is so inspiring.\n\nBiggest shout out to the coordinators and organizers who did an amazing job of hosting us. They did everything in their capacity to provide us with the best networking opportunities.\n\nFrom the pre event to the last panel of speakers, the entire experience was so enriching.\n\nThank you, Dr. Sebas, for creating this beautiful community.

P. Shah government medical college\n\nJamnagar\n\nDate of experience : April 15, 2023\n\nWonderful organization with passionate leaders!\n\nOne of the best organizations that I am fortunate to know. It is truly a blessing for all IMG‚Äôs and anyone who is pursuing medicine in the United States. The founder and all the individuals working with them are wonderful and extremely passionate about IMG‚Äôs. It has been a pleasure to get to know them and I hope to be a part of this wonderful organization as well as part of the events in the near future.\n\nDate of experience : April 17, 2023\n\nThe IMG chapter: INDIA\n\nThe event was amazing , fun , informative and what not ! And the best part was networking .\n\nIt was great networking with all of you .\n\nBeing a part of event as a volunteer was a lot more opportunistic for me .\n\nIt was fun working with all the volunteers and organisers .\n\nThank you to all the organisers for such an amazing event and cheers to their hardwork .\n\nDate of experience : April 15, 2023\n\nI met my community\n\nI met my community\n\nThe road for IMGs is very hard and isolating, at the event I was moved by the inspirational stories of some of the speakers, and others gave insightful advice as how to match. You were able to start networking at the pre event cocktail and everyone that came alone met a group they identified with. From the event, I now have a study partner and others that support me since they are ahead of me in this path. I recommend this event to anyone no matter where they are in their journey. The road is long but it can be less of a burden with others to walk with you.\n\nDate of experience : March 18, 2023\n\nIt's was very inspiring\n\nIt's was very nice, inspiring and motivational event.. It gives me right direction of my dreams... I really enjoyed it... Specifically the Doctors with there journey and experience really inspired me a lot... I hope with the help of the knowledge that i got through this IMG event will help me to achieve my dreams... Thank you for everything everyone.... üòäü´∂ü´∞\n\nDate of experience : April 22, 2023"
