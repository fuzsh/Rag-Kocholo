        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nA sports competition show pitting stars from each network at the time (CBS, NBC and ABC) in several different events for cash prizes. I am kinda shocked such a show ever got made but it makes for some great tv. Several years ago I found out about it and then found them all on dvd. A lot of stars I knew but plenty I didn't simply because they were on obscure shows that didn't last very long. Mark Harmon, Tom Selleck, David Letterman, Ron Howard, Kurt Russell and many more. It was a fun show but still very competitive, which makes it even better.\n\nWhen I heard they were doing another Battle last summer I thought there was no way it could be as good. I was right.\n\nFirst of all, there is no crowd to cheer the competitors on. It's kinda lifeless.\n\nSecond, a lot of the stars were kinda old and some of them even competed in the original show. Doesn't make for good athletic competition. Most of them were there just to show up, 'compete' and pick up a paycheck.\n\nAnd the show sorely missed Howard Cosell as the play by play and host, who made just about every moment at least seem compelling and he had a gift for saying some incredibly (and hilarious) politically incorrect things.\n\nThe original I give 8/10.\n\nThe remake I would give 2/10."
