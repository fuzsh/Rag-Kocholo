        "text": "There are many ways to break down this year’s Wimbledon draw: by nationality, by seeding, by top half, by bottom half or — if you are in a commercial frame of mind — by management company.\n\nTracking which superstar, or perhaps more important, which rising star, is represented by which organization continues to be a tournament within a Grand Slam tournament. It is as meaningful to the agents and the players as the forehands and backhands are to the fans, most of whom remain oblivious to the fact that Roger Federer is now with a management company called Team8 instead of his former agency, IMG.\n\nIMG has long been the market leader in the hawking of tennis players. The company was founded in 1960 by Mark McCormack, an American lawyer who saw a niche and began making money from it by reaching a handshake agreement with the star golfer Arnold Palmer. Under McCormack and later Ted Forstmann, the company was transformed into a tentacled global sports and entertainment firm. In tennis, IMG owned tournaments, developed talent in many sports through its academy in Bradenton, Fla., and represented tennis’s biggest stars.\n\nBut after Forstmann died in 2011, IMG’s future was uncertain until the entertainment and media agency William Morris Endeavor and the private equity firm Silver Lake Partners joined forces (and checkbooks) to purchase it in December 2013 for $2.4 billion.\n\nIt was a bold gamble that left, at least in tennis circles, a $2.4 billion question: Would the merged company, under the chief executives Ari Emanuel and Patrick Whitesell, want to remain a major player in investing in the sport and managing tennis stars at a time of reduced margins, increased competition and high-profile defections from the traditional agency model?\n\nA little more than a year since William Morris Endeavor took over IMG, the answer is an unmistakable yes, even if bad luck and bad play — by the rising Canadian star Eugenie Bouchard in particular — have made some of the company’s early tennis moves look less than masterful."
