        "text": "Star Wars and Murder on the Orient Express actor Daisy Ridley has opened up about her Graves' Disease diagnosis.\n\nIn an interview with Women's Health to promote the film Young Woman and the Sea, Ridley revealed that she was informed that has the condition back in 2023. Graves' Disease affects the thyroid, and symptoms includes weight loss, fatigue and skin conditions, among others.\n\nShe was previously diagnosed with endometriosis and polycystic ovaries, back when she was 15 years old.\n\n\"It's the first time I've shared that,\" Ridley told the publication.\n\nRelated: Best movie box sets to buy\n\n\"We all read the stats about women being undiagnosed or underdiagnosed and sort of coming to terms with saying, 'I really, actually don't feel good' and not going, 'I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.' It's just normalized to not feel good.\n\n\"In the grand scheme of things, [my conditions are] much less severe than what a lot of people go through. Even if you can deal with it, you shouldn't have to. If there's a problem, you shouldn't have to just [suffer through it].\"\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Ridley spoke about her training for Young Woman and the Sea, where she was tutored by Olympian Siobhan-Marie O'Connor.\n\nRelated: Star Wars: Lando boss opens up on shelved series\n\nThings started badly, with the actor admitting that: \"The first time I swam for the role, we were in a 20-meter pool, and I swam halfway, then started panicking. I was like, I can't do it. I actually can't do it. It was a classic lied-on-the-CV moment of 'What the f**k have I done?'\"\n\nHowever, when it came to the last day of filming, Ridley swam for as long as she could, and once she emerged from the water, O'Connor was brought to tears by her protege."
