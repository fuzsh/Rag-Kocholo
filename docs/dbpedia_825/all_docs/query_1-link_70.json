        "text": "IXTAPA, Mexico -- Twenty-four U.S. television stars suspended their ratings war to compete on the playing fields Sunday as 'The Battle of the Network Stars' went south of the border for the first time in its history.\n\nAfter nine years of filming at Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif., the show's producers decided to hold the competition this year in the Pacific coast resort of Ixtapa-Zihuatenejo, about 170 miles southwest of Mexico City.\n\n'We thought it would be a nice change,' said executive producer Barry Frank, adding the Mexican government made producers 'an offer we couldn't refuse.'\n\nThe Camino Real and Club Med hotels, where the two-day event was filmed during the weekend, lack a good running track, but Frank said 'we've been able to do wonderful things with boats and sand.'\n\nEvents added this year include a beach relay, with participants carrying surfboards and paddleboards through the surf, and a Mexican fishing boat race.\n\nEight stars from each of the networks are taking part in eight events, which also included mixed-doubles tennis, swimming and running relays, volleyball, an obstacle course and a final tug-o'-war between the two highest-scoring teams.\n\nTony Danza of 'Who's the Boss' was captain of the ABC team, 'Falcon Crest' star Lorenzo Llamas headed CBS's team and former pro football player Bubba Smith of 'Half-Nelson' headed the team from NBC.\n\nNot all the filming went smoothly.\n\nLucie Arnaz, star of 'The Lucie Arnaz Show,' missed the boat race. She came running down to the beach visibly upset and plunged into the water to attempt to swim out to her CBS team just as the starting shot was fired.\n\nEarlier, the NBC team tried several times to get their rowboat out past the breaking waves, but ended up back on shore time and again.\n\nPhilip Michael Thomas, who plays undercover cop Ricardo Tubbs on NBC's 'Miami Vice,' said the teams were 'incredibly good.'\n\nThomas, 35, said his physical shape is 'not too bad for almost 40,' but admitted, 'I haven't worked out in four to five months because of the series.'\n\nEach member of the winning team will receive $20,000 and each member of the second-place team will receive $12,500. Members of the losing team will take home $8,000 for the weekend at the beach.\n\nThe show, hosted by Dick Van Dyke and Joan Van Ark, will air on ABC May 23.\n\nOther stars in the two-day competition included Ted McGinley of ABC's 'The Love Boat,' Jennifer O'Neill of CBS's 'Cover-up,' William R. Moses of CBS's 'Falcon Crest,' and Keil Martin and Ken Olin of NBC's 'Hill Street Blues.'"
