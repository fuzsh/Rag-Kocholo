        "text": "Has anybody seen this thing? I'm catching up on my DVR with it and it is a pale imitation of the original. For one thing, the \"stars\" are either performers from long ago shows who are now old and fat or the modern performers are mostly people you never heard of from shows you never heard of. Whereas the old shows had a large crowd in attendance, including cheerleaders, the new one was shot in isolation with no one there but the TV crew. But worst of all, while the original's main appeal was dressing the actresses in the sheerest outfits possible, which became see-through once they got wet, the new show has them covered up like nuns. They even wear gym shorts over their bottoms. Wow, the world sure has changed!\n\nDid you ever see SNL's parody, Battle of the Network T's and A's? It is spot on to the appeal of that show in the 70's!\n\nYeah. I keep forgetting that was 1981.\n\nI'm watching it right now on ESPN. So lame. It's a very, very pale comparison to the original. I used to watch the original as a kid. That was fun, this is just sad.\n\nAnd the \"stars?\"\n\nD.J. from Roseanne? Shari Belafonte? Wayne from The Wonder Years? Andrea and Steve from Beverly Hills 90210? Well, Ian Ziering will be in pretty much anything crappy these days.\n\nAlso, the lack of the cheering crowd just takes so much away. Eh."
