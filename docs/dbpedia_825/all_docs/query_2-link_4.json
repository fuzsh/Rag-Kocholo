        "text": "Longtime IMG agent BARRY FRANK, who died Tuesday at 87 after a short illness, will be remembered for his always-stylish look and ability to own a room. Whether it was running CBS Sports or negotiating major deals for his IMG clients, Frank leaves a multi-pronged legacy. He worked with top execs like ROONE ARLEDGE and MARK MCCORMACK; sold media rights to everything from the Olympics, MLB and NBA to the ACC, BCS and Wimbledon; created TV shows like \"BATTLE OF THE NETWORK STARS,\" the \"SKINS GAME\" and \"AMERICAN GLADIATIORS;\" and represented the biggest on-air personalities in the business, like JOHN MADDEN, JIM NANTZ and BOB COSTAS. Until last week, Frank still came to his IMG office in Manhattan most days (John Ourand, SBJ Media). Frank also created \"made-for-television sports shows\" like \"THE SUPERSTARS,\" \"WORLD'S STRONGEST MAN\" and \"SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.\" His list of clients also included MIKE TIRICO, DEION SANDERS, KIRK HERBSTREIT, TODD BLACKLEDGE, LESLEY VISSER, CHRIS EVERT, ROBIN ROBERTS, PEGGY FLEMING, CRIS COLLINSWORTH, BILL WALTON and GREG GUMBEL. Frank \"spent time at CBS, the J. Walter Thompson marketing company and ABC Sports, then joined\" IMG in '70. He became president of CBS Sports in '76 and returned to IMG in '78. At IMG, he represented the IOC in \"rights deals for seven Olympics\" (AP, 10/30)."
