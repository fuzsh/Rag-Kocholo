        "text": "Cathedral of Christ’s Nativity, Bell Tower,Triumphal Arch\n\nThe cathedral was built between 1830-1836. The idea of building such an important object of worship belonged to Metropolitan Gavriil Bănulescu-Bodoni. But the foundation stone was laid only 9 years after his death.\n\nThe architect Avraam Melnikov, chosen by competition, used the late neoclassical style (empiric style) for the building, with the use of ancient Greek forms for the columns.\n\nIt has a symmetrical composition, representing a square with a side of 27 m, by joining to the cubic body four porticoes with six Doric columns each, resulting in a cruciform plan with identically designed facades. It was built of stone and brick, with three altars – one main altar – the Nativity of the Lord, and two side altars – the one on the left, dedicated to St. John the New, and the one on the right – St. Nicholas the Martyr (current names).\n\nThe first radio station in Chisinau, Radio Basarabia, was officially inaugurated by broadcasting the liturgy from the Metropolitan Cathedral on 8 October 1939.\n\nThe cathedral suffered during the 1940 earthquake, then during the World War II, with the spire, dome and interior being rebuilt in 1956, but with deviations from the original forms. During the USSR it was used as an exhibition hall.\n\nThe reopening in a new format took place on August 25th, 1996 with the consecration of the Cathedral Cross.\n\nThe original bell tower was built at the same time as the cathedral. It was located 40 m away from it, symmetrically with the cathedral and in relation to the geometric centre of the cathedral section. It had four levels, three prismatic, with successively receding sides, and the fourth in the form of a flat circular belfry for the bell chamber, covered by a dome. On the first level was a chapel, the entrance to which was through a portico with two columns on the south side. Identical porticoes adorned each facade of the bell tower, creating a small-scale repetition of the composition of the cathedral and harmonising with it in the shape of the domes.\n\nIt was demolished in the 1960s and rebuilt in 1998 according to the old images.\n\nThe history of the construction of the “Holy Gates” is curious – after the original project (which involved the erection of the Cathedral and the Bell Tower), they were not planned. At the time, when the bell tower was already erected, it was discovered that the largest of the bells could not fit through the windows to be mounted. The giant bell, cast from Turkish cannons, weighed about 400 poods (about 6.5 t).\n\nIn order to accommodate the big bell, a decision was taken to build the Triumphal Arch, located at the entrance to the square from the direction of the Mitropolis (it has not been preserved to this day – it was destroyed during the World War II).\n\nThe official version was that the Arch was erected to commemorate the victory of the Russian armies over the Turks, of course.\n\nThe first arched clocks appeared in 1842. They were brought from Odessa, but in 1849, a strong hurricane tore off the dial, but its mechanism continued to work until 1881. The new mechanism was purchased from Austria. The actual clock worked without repair until it was bombed in 1941.\n\nIn 1945, plaques with the names of Soviet army fighters and citizens, who fought on the territory of Bessarabia in World War II and received the distinction of “Hero of the Soviet Union”, were nailed on the walls. The plaques were removed in 1991, after Moldova gained its independence.\n\nSince its erection, the Triumphal Arch bore several names – it was also called the Holy Gates, and under the Soviet regime it was called the Arch of Victory.\n\nThe old Prison Castle\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Chisinau, having become the centre of the province of Bessarabia, began to develop rapidly. Houses were built, institutions were set up, the population grew considerably. But there was no prison. Instead, there were several guardhouses scattered throughout the city, which were used to hold soldiers or sentries and also served as a dungeon for other prisoners, but over time they became increasingly inefficient. A decision was taken to have the problem remedied. Thus, already in 1834, the draft of the dungeon in Chisinau was ready, being designed by Giorgio Toriсelli from Switzerland. This architect was better known in Odessa, where his creations are still architectural jewels of the city. Chisinau proved less fortunate, however, as another building designed by Toricelli, the Lutheran Church, was destroyed in the 1960s.\n\nToricelli proposed a very unusual project, which was approved. Construction began in the 1840s and was completed in the 1850s.\n\nThe castle was built in the shape of a square, the sides of which faced the sides of the world. Even this positioning was unusual, as the street network designed at the time was oriented differently. As a result, the castle looked even more imposing, with one of the large round towers visible on each of the streets in the district in which it stood. The height of the towers was more than 20 metres, the most important one being the one on Sadovaia Street (today’s Bernardazzi). The large round towers were complemented by smaller rectangular towers. Because of its unusual appearance, the prison was often called the “Bastille of Chisinau”. The main tower of the castle was visibly different from the others, one of its battlements was made in the shape of a cross, and not by chance – there was the prison church.\n\nMany famous prisoners were imprisoned in the Chisinau prison. One of the most famous was G. Kotovschi, who managed to escape from here. The history of the castle continued even when the country was part of Romania in the interwar period.\n\nThe old Prison Castle did not serve the new Soviet authorities well for long. The catastrophic earthquake of November 1940 severely damaged the building. The ensuing war prevented its restoration, which led to further ruin.\n\nAfter the war, little remains of the castle. But since the need for a prison was felt, a new prison was built on the site of the castle, which we still have today. New buildings were constructed, almost the entire district was surrounded by a new high wall with turrets. The complex does not stand out for its refinement and style (characteristics of the old Castle) and is certainly not an architectural jewel for this part of Chisinau.\n\nEntering these buildings and exploring them is an extremely difficult task. But photos taken inside the prison are even more difficult to obtain. The main tower of the castle has been preserved, not very well though, as it has lost half of its height. Even the adjacent square lower towers have survived to the present day, though not entirely.\n\nCurrently, the 13th Prison is located here.\n\nThe Heroes’ Cemetery Memorial Complex\n\nThe Heroes’ Cemetery Memorial Complex, known in different eras as the Heroes’ Cemetery, the Cemetery of Honour or the Romanian Military Cemetery, is a historical monument located on bd. Decebal 17 in Chisinau. Here were buried soldiers of different ethnicities participating in the two world wars.\n\nThe cemetery appeared in 1918, at the end of the First World War. It was the burial place for soldiers who had fallen on the battlefield, and in later years also for war veterans. The buried soldiers were of different nationalities: Romanians, Russians, Czechs, Poles, French, Austrians, Hungarians, etc. In the interwar period, a chapel in memory of the Czech Legion was built on the cemetery grounds. The cemetery was called “Heroes’ Cemetery” until Bessarabia joined the USSR, when it was renamed Krasnodonskii. In 1927-1938, the cemetery was laid out by the “Queen Mary” National Settlement for the Cult of Heroes. The fallen soldiers of the Second World War were also buried here in the summer of 1941. Sources also mention that an unidentified number of prisoners of war from Germany, Austria, Italy and other countries were buried in the same cemetery.\n\nAt that time, the cemetery had an area of 2.4 ha. Access to the cemetery was via a monumental entrance, consisting of a six-metre-wide staircase with 50 steps and an architectural portal at the base consisting of two 10-metre-high reinforced concrete pillars, each bearing an eagle with spread wings. The columns dominated a vast semicircular square surrounded by walls and ornaments. Shaped like an irregular polygon, the cemetery had an old Byzantine-style chapel at its centre, around which six grave plots were laid out. The steps were connected to the chapel by an alley.\n\nAfter 1944, the chapel was destroyed and the cemetery ground was levelled by bulldozer. During this process, several graves were unintentionally disinterred, bringing out bones and various personal objects (wristwatches, cigarette boxes, daggers, etc.) In 1959, what remained of the cemetery was demolished, except for the columns at the entrance, and in 1961 the Chiril Draganiuc Institute of Pulmonology and Physiology was built. The foundation of the chapel was preserved and a terrace was set up there for the patients to rest. In the early 1990s, when the hospital was no longer functioning, a wooden cross with the inscription “Glory to the Heroes of the Romanian Army” was installed on the foundation of the former chapel, an initiative of the politician Gheorghe Ghimpu. The hospital was demolished at the end of 2007. shortly after it became private property.\n\nIn the Cemetery of Honour in Chisinau were buried 1645 soldiers, including 431 Romanians (66 in graves, 365 in the crypt), 234 Russians (27 in graves, 207 in the crypt), 29 Austrians, 39 Czechs, 35 French and 6 Poles fallen in World War I, as well as 96 Romanian soldiers fallen in World War II. Around the chapel there were six plots with 136 graves in which 202 heroes were buried and two crypts with 572 unidentified Romanian and Russian heroes.\n\nIn 2013, the Republican Association of War Participants (ARPR) said it was able to identify about 200 of the more than 3,000 graves that existed in the late 1940s in the memorial complex. These include 89 intact Romanian graves from the Second World War, the grave of Italian soldier Alciro Deviani (who died in October 1941) and 36 graves of Soviet soldiers who died in the infirmaries in Chisinau. Among those buried in the cemetery are two charity sisters. Another five graves identified belong to Czechoslovak soldiers out of 29 who lost their lives in Chisinau after the withdrawal of Czechoslovak legions from Bolshevik Russia. Thirty graves have also been attributed to French officers who died in southern Bessarabia during the Second World War. According to the ARPR, German and Hungarian prisoners who were part of NKVD construction detachments during the post-war reconstruction of the capital are buried at the “Heroes’ Cemetery”. Nowadays, there are regular clean-ups and memorial services for the buried.\n\nIt is currently being rehabilitated.\n\nMansion of Nazarov\n\nThe building was first documented in 1900 when it was transferred from the brothers Ivan and Nicolai Lebedev to the merchant Jacob Nazarov. We also know that the Adrianov family lived here, and later, the Jewish Hana Epștein is also mentioned.\n\nThe first distinctive feature of this architectural monument is the presence of “shell”-shaped windows, a rarity in Chisinau where such windows are either uncommon or typically of smaller size. Here, however, the shells encompass the entire window arch. Another notable aspect is the entrance of the building, which is flanked by two columns, known in Italian architecture as “serliana.” This element is even more infrequently seen in our local buildings. Apart from its unique architectural style, the monument likely conceals numerous urban histories and a wealth of information that remains undiscovered. Some archives contain information dating back to the Soviet period. In 1983, it assumed the role of the headquarters for the Public Health Centre (of the SSRMM) through a lease agreement with the then Ministry of Culture. To digress, this contract delineates the conditions imposed by the Ministry of Culture for leasing this architectural monument. For instance, lessees are obligated to safeguard the building and refrain from any alterations to its facade. Otherwise, any interventions will be annulled, and the architectural monument will be restored to its original condition at the lessor’s expense. In addition to serving as the headquarters of the Public Health Centre, the building’s basement housed several shops. One of them was named “Vodka.” Presently, the building is privately owned and is in an advanced state of disrepair.\n\n***************************************************\n\nFrom the town’s legends\n\n“…It must have been a chilly January night. Drizzling rain filled the air. It was late, and the inhabitants of the house were quietly bustling in the corners, attending to minor tasks by the warm glow of candlelight. Maids were issuing final instructions to the cooks. A new trend had surfaced among the fresh bourgeoisie of Chișinău, introduced by the ladies who had visited Paris—the decoration of Christmas trees. Amidst gossip and a glass or two of cranberry liqueur, the women adorned the tree with sparkling ribbons, colorful candles, and an assortment of sweets.”\n\nThe maids were working tirelessly; tonight, they would only get a few hours of sleep. Christmas was approaching.Walnut cozies had been baked and were resting on towels. The pig they had prepared for Yule was now sitting in the cellar. From that pig, the householders would have sausages, calabash, and saltison on the Christmas table. Tonight, the cooks would slaughter a couple more pigs from the yard to enjoy conkers and some hot roast meat upon their return from Mass. After the meal, they would bring out the liqueur jugs and indulge in pancakes and jam. Fasting was observed as a sacred practice, aimed at purifying the soul, while houses were being readied for the arrival of the Lord. Children long since sent to bed still giggled under the covers, tomorrow they would go caroling. Adorned with shawls up to their noses, they will fight the snow in their felts and the frost in their cheeks, but they will come home with baskets full of bagels, apples and nuts.\n\nThe hutches would not hold back, and every family would buy hundreds of pretzels to be ready for the lines of carolers.\n\nBrothers Ivan and Nicholas Lebedev went out of the house, leaving their carriage and coachman. They took Seminarskaya Street (now Metropolitan G. Banulescu-Bodoni) to Aleksadrovskaya Street and from there another block down the same street to the Nobility Club (today the Patria-Loteanu cinema stands on the site of this building), where the great hereditary nobility, various officials and wealthy merchants used to gather in the evenings. It was also there that the Lebedev brothers met the merchant Jacob Nazarov, a Russian from Lviv whom they had long been courting. He was to buy the brothers’ urban villa.\n\nThe villa was located at the intersection of Seminarskaya Street and Kaușanskaya Street (today Column 110). A very good place close to the Diocesan House and the Metropolitan’s buildings (today no longer there), and the Nativity Cathedral.\n\nKauchenskaya Street until recently was the central axis of the city. This street stands right on the border between the old town, with its streets criss-crossed like a spider’s web, and above that imaginary border the new town began. Across the park, further up the hill, stretched the new axis of Chisinau, Milionaya Street (unofficially named because the owners of the new buildings on this street were very wealthy (today’s Stefan cel Mare cel Mare și Sfînt Boulevard)). It was a perfect place for a wealthy nephew like the lipovinean Nazarov, who was making his way in the circles of the titled families of Chisinau in the 1900s.\n\nAfter a few rounds of brandy and a few exchanges of cigarettes, the men high-fived. Nazarov left with the promise of a house in the middle of nowhere, and the Lebedev brothers – with a good bargain.\n\nIt’s Christmas Day. After Mass, in every house in Chisinau, the festive table was spread with pork roasts, sarmale and cozonaci. But the dishes were not eaten without giving alms to neighbours and the poor. People carrying plates of food were on every street. The Lebedev maids also went out to hand out cakes to the poor, and the whole town already knew that their husbands had sold the lipovean’s villa.\n\nAfter lunch the children went out to the derdel, and the parents went to their friends’ houses to party. In the evening, the children went out with the Star and the boys with the Irods. A celebration of childhood.\n\nLong after Christmas, Nazarov entered the house with the right of ownership. Here his family had a nice life, they had parties and coveted the most distinguished guests of those times. He loved the house and looked after it. During the war the villa was damaged, but in 1948 it was rebuilt. For many years after that it stood proudly reminding passers-by of the beautiful history of the families who lived there …” (Urban legend by Anastasia Taburceanu)\n\nMonument-spring “Cișmeaua General Georgescu P. Ion”\n\nOn the Romanian Army Day, marked annually on October 25, the monument “General Georgescu P. Ion’s Cemetery”, located in Valea Morilor Park, was re-inaugurated and consecrated in Chisinau.\n\nIt was originally installed in 1937, in honour of the victories of the Romanian Army in the battles of Mărăști and Mărășești in the First World War. The Cișmeaua was once known as “General Pion’s Spring” because General Pavel Ion Georgescu, who was called Pion for short, was the initiator of this monument.\n\nBehind this monument there are now three plaques, which commemorate tragic events in our history. It is about the year 1940 – when the USSR conquered Bessarabia, northern Bukovina, Herta County and in the period from June 1940 to July 1941, several historical personalities were captured and tortured. Their bodies were found many years later in mass graves at the exit of the “Valley of the Mills” park.\n\n*****************************************************\n\nWho was General Pavel Ion Georgescu?\n\nHe was born on 25 December 1883 in Zănoaga (Romania) in a priest’s family.\n\nHe attended the “Carol I” National College in Craiova and the “Mihai Viteazul” High School in Bucharest, then the Military School of Artillery and Engineering (1904-1906) and finally the Faculty of Mathematics.\n\nMilitary ranks: second lieutenant-1906, lieutenant-1910, captain-1914, major-1917, lieutenant-colonel-1920, colonel-1926, brigadier general-1935, major general-1942.\n\nMilitary functions: teacher and commander of the Artillery School in Timișoara (1926-1928) and of the Army Arsenal (1930-1931), of the 1st Artillery Brigade in Chișinău until 1937, of the 20th Infantry Division in Tg. Mures (1937-1939), then of the 7th Territorial Corps Sibiu.\n\nHe was a professor of ballistics at the Polytechnic Institute of Timișoara.\n\nIn the First World War he distinguished himself in the battles of Cașin and Mărășești (Pion trench).\n\nIn the village of Seini (Satu Mare, Romania) he built an Orthodox church and in Zănoaga he erected a bust of Stephen the Great.\n\nBetween 1937 and 1939, as a division general, he was commander of the fortifications at Poarta Someșului. Also during this period he erected a living monument, made of 10,000 fir trees, on Comja Hill (650 m – Gutâiului Mountain), inscribed with the poet’s name – “Eminescu”. The cemetery of General Georgescu P. Ion (“PION” – as he was called, honorary citizen of Seini, post mortem) is visible from the plane, from the DE 58, towards Satu Mare.\n\nOn 1 September 1940, as commander of the 7th Territorial Corps, he and other officers took part in leading the demonstration in Sibiu against the Vienna Dictatorship.\n\nHe was decorated with several Romanian and foreign orders and medals.Since 1946 he has been under constant surveillance by the Securitate and has been arrested several times. He died in 1956.\n\nThe Armenian Apostolical Church, The Holy Mother of God (1803–1804)\n\nAfter the annexation of Bessarabia to the Russian Empire in 1812, the Armenian Archbishop (1809-1828) of Moldo-Vlachia, Grigor Zakarian, had to move to Chișinău, his title being limited to that of Archbishop of the Armenians of Bessarabia, although the Armenians across the Prut continued to subordinate themselves to him. The 400 parishes and five churches (Akkerman, Ismail, Tighina, Chisinau, Hotin) of the Armenian community in the region came under the jurisdiction of the Armenian community in Bessarabia.\n\nThe Armenian Apostolic Church “Holy Mother of God” in Chisinau dates back to 1803 and was built on the foundation of an old damaged Moldovan church. Built in 1645, during the reign of Vasile Lupu (1634-1653), it was dedicated to “St. Nicholas” and was also known as the “Domnească Church”. Frequent invasions by the Tatars, several earthquakes and destruction caused by the Russo-Turkish wars destroyed it to such an extent that by 1741 it was in total ruin.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the land, and what remained of the church once founded by Vasile Lupu, was bought by an Armenian from the local authorities. This one was Baron Oganes, who contributed to the creation of the church in memory of his parents in 1803.\n\nDuring the Soviet period, according to the Armenian community, the church was used as a warehouse. From archival documents, we know that its conversion into a storage facility took place in the summer of 1944.\n\nDespite the fact that the building had its religious activity suspended, it continued to gather all the Armenians of the Moldovan SSR, becoming a symbol of the preservation of their spiritual unity and identity – “the Armenian community always gathered around the church, even when it was closed”.\n\nThe Armenian community took possession of the Armenian Church again in 1992. The church resumed its activities on 19 June 1993, when it was inaugurated by the head of the Moscow and Nahicevan Eparchy in the presence of high dignitaries, and was served by a priest assigned by the Armenian Patriarchate of Etchimiadzin.\n\n****\n\nWho was Manuc Bey?\n\nArmenian, Emanuel Mârzaian was born in 1769 in Rusciuc to a wealthy merchant family. After the death of his parents and his marriage to a wealthy Armenian woman, he took over the family business and established trade links with Constantinople. Thanks to his talent for cultivating relationships, bribing and sensing opportunities, he soon became the richest man in the Balkans. One of the first people he corrupted was the governor of Rusciucco, who offered him a large sum of money in exchange for guaranteeing his import and export business.\n\nHe also turned his business to the Romanian Country and got in the good graces of the ruler Constantine Ipsilanti from whom he obtained the dignities of serdar and paharnic. With a remarkable political intuition he sensed the approach of the Russo-Turkish war and in 1806, through high intermediaries such as the ruler of Muntenia and the Russian consul in Iasi, he requested and obtained Russian citizenship.\n\nDuring the Russo-Turkish war of 1806-1812, Manuc turned his main business to Wallachia where he began to build the inn that bears his name in Bucharest. He also bought large estates in Wallachia.\n\nEnjoying the trust of the Ottomans, Manuc was commissioned by Pasha to supply the army, maintain the Danubian fortresses and negotiate with the Russians.\n\nHe also gained the trust of the Montagnards (Muntenians) by offering the Romanian Country a loan of 160,000 talers without interest and by paying (non-refundable) a debt to the Turks of 60,000. In the meantime the Turks also granted him the title of bei or prince of Moldavia.\n\nManuc bei, a trusted Turkish agent of the Russian Empire, took part in and hosted in his inn the negotiations at the end of the Russo-Turkish war in 1812, negotiations which for us resulted in the loss of Bessarabia. For this Tsar Alexander I decorated him with the medal of Knight of the Order of Saint Vladimir.\n\nAfter a short journey to Sibiu, the prudent Manuc Bei moved to Chișinău, where in 1816 he bought a 10-hectare estate in Hâncești for 300,000 lei-gold. He did not get to see the finished palace because he died in suspicious circumstances on June 20, 1817 at only 48 years old in a hunting accident, in which Russian generals were taking part, or, according to other anonymous sources, he was killed by the Ottomans for high treason.\n\nHe was buried in the courtyard of the Armenian Church in Chisinau.\n\nMonumentul Naiului\n\nIn one of the courtyards of the Rascani sector an older monument was hidden. Supposedly erected around 1960-1964, it is dedicated to the most famous national musical instrument – the Nai.\n\nGeneral name: Nai\n\nLocal name: Fluierar, Fluieraș, Fluierici, Fluierător, Moscal, Muscal, Șuieriță\n\nShort definition: The Nai is a traditional end-blown woodwind instrument of the flute family.\n\nCircular: The Nai is one of the oldest musical instruments in the world and one of the most perfect archaic instruments. The origin of the nai is lost in times long gone. Neither the inventor nor the area of origin of the nai has yet been established. As with other traditional musical instruments, polygenesis also applies to this aerophone. According to some sources, the instrument is about six thousand years old. Six thousand years ago, musical sounds were defined by the order of this reed-pipe link, which was the primordial pipe. Archaeological and historical records prove the presence of the pipe in all corners of the world. Under different names, the nai is found in many countries around the world: antara – in Peru and Bolivia; biwabon – in Japan; kuviklî, kuviciki or pipe – in Russia; lalave, palina, rihe or tenaho – in the Solomon Islands; mishi – in the Democratic Republic of Congo; musikâr – in Turkey;\n\nsyrinx – in Greece; skuduciai or skadutas – in Lithuania; zuffolo or zuffolo pastorale – in Italy, etc. Throughout the world, the instrument has circulated and still circulates under the name of Pan’s flute, a name that has become established due to the legend that depicts the Greek god Pan playing this instrument, attributing to this deity the role of creator of the flute. Philologists explain the etymology of the instrument’s name in the Persian-Arabic-Turkish word nay or ney, which, according to Curt Sachs, means reed whistle. Nay mus in Persian means Pan’s whistle, and miskal, musikâr or musqal in Persian, Arabic and Turkish also means Pan’s whistle.\n\nIn our cultural-ethnic space, the flute has been known since ancient times. Pictorial evidence from antiquity, found in centres inhabited by the Geto-Dacians, depicts musical-choreographic scenes with the presence of mythological divinities (heroes dancing to the sounds of the flute, fauns with a flute, Pan with a kettledrum and flute, etc.), all dating from long before our era (from the 6th century BC). Sculptural images and inscriptions attested at Histria, Tomis, Callatis depict several musicians (instrumentalists) playing musical instruments, including the syrinx (nai), in various poses. We find it depicted on the bas-relief on the wall of the sarcophagus from the discovered in Oltenia. In the historical and literary writings of the Roman poet Ovid (1st century AD) the presence of the nai in the musical practice of the Geto-Dacians is mentioned. Mention of the presence of the syrinx in choreographic performance is attested in the 1st century AD. 2nd century AD north of the Danube by the Greek writer Lucian of Samosata. The Dionysian deity’s relief appears on a marble slab with an inscription (241 AD), discovered at Tomis, two corybanites armed with swords and shields rhythmically support a war dance in the presence of Pan (with the traditional nai) and Dionysus. The nai is referred to as a pipe in the work ‘The Teachings of Neagoe Basarab to his son Theodosius’ (1512-1521). In the Principality of Monaco, the nai began to be popularised on a massive scale in the 18th century, when it was included in lute bands alongside the violin and the cobza. The organologist Tiberiu Alexandru suggests the hypothesis that the construction of the reed-pipe nai proves its primary functionality in the rustic and bucolic environment. The next mention of the functioning of the pipe in our traditional musical culture comes from 1774, when the Russian General-feldmarshal Pyotr Rumyantsev, who took part in the Russian-Turkish war of 1768-1774, including the battles of Larga and Cahul (1770), addresses the Divan of Moldavia and Wallachia with the request to send to the imperial palace in St. Petersburg the instrumental ensemble composed of the violinist-brothers Ivanta and the naist Stancu. Fr.J. Sulzer in his work History of Transalpine Dacia (1781, Vienna, vol. II, p. 417) also reports on the existence of the nai in the lute inlays in the lowlands of Moldavia and Wallachia. The fame of the naijo reached beyond the borders of the country from the second half of the 18th century, and the former French secretary to Grigore III Ghica Jean-Louis Carra noted in 1777 in Histoire de la Moldavie et de la Valachie, avec une dissertation sur l ‘etat actuel de ces deux Provinces that the naijo (‘the eight-holed whistle’), together with the violin and the cobza, was one of the country’s instruments. History has preserved several names of famous instrumentalists, who delighted listeners in the country and abroad with their interpretive art: Stancu, Năstasă Muscalagiul, Paraschiv Muscalagiul, Mihalachi Roșu – a member of the Taraf led by the famous Barbu Lăutarul who is said to have possessed the naiola, T. Teodorescu, I. Pădureanu, Angheluș Dinicu, Radu Ciolac and others. Under different names the naius is recorded in several written sources published in the country and abroad: Papageno’s flute (in the German Allgemeine Musikalsche Zeitung, nos. 46 and 47, 1821), muscal (in Dionysius Fotino’s General History of Dacia, 1819, reed (in the travel notes of the Russian officer V. Gorceakov, 1820-23), Pan’s flute (in the work of the English traveller W. Wilkinson’s Tableau historique, géographique et politique de la Moldavie, 1821), nai (in the songbook of the Austrian violinist and critic Alfred Henrich Ehrlich Air nationeax roumains, 1850 and in the novel by the German writer Wilhelm de Kotzebue Lascar Viorescu, 1851).\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the art of playing the nai was presented and appreciated abroad: in Belgium, in Russia – in Sankt-Petersburg, Moscow, Baku, the nai performers were accompanied by the tarafols led by G. Ochialb, S. Pădureanu. It is even believed that it was under the impression of these ensembles that the Russian composer N. Rimsky-Korsakov introduced the naiola in the third act of the score of his opera “Mlada” (1893). However, it was also during this period that the naius was gradually suppressed from the composition of the inlays. In the ensembles conducted by I. Perja, C. Marin, C. Parno, Gh. Heraru – the most representative for the late sec. XIX – înc. sec. 20th century in Moldova on the left of the Prut – the nai mike is not recorded. It gradually returns again in the composition of instrumental ensembles in the second half of the 20th century. Nowadays, the nai is mainly used in non-traditional environments as a component instrument in folk music bands and folk ensembles.\n\nAll Saints Glorified on the Land of Moldova – Bulgarian Chapel (1882)\n\nOn this site, where the Obelisk and Chapel now stand, in 1887, Emperor Alexander II read out the manifesto of Russia’s declaration of war against the Ottoman Porte in front of Russian troops and Moldovan and Bulgarian volunteers. On this day the last Russo-Turkish war began, ending with the victory of Russia and the formation of the Bulgarian state. A parade of troops took place before being sent to the Balkans. In honour of this event, a small chapel was built on the eastern side of the field in 1882.\n\nA year before the outbreak of war, Gustave Eiffel was specially invited to Basarabia to build a bridge across the Prut. The inauguration of the bridge took place on 21 April 1877, and three days later the Russo-Turkish war began.\n\nIn 1876, the Bulgarian Charity Committee was set up in Chisinau to help the national liberation movement in Bulgaria. The committee gave extensive support to the Serbs during the war in Serbia and Montenegro against the Turks. It facilitated the sending of volunteers, combat equipment and food from Kishinev to Serbia. At the Committee’s initiative, charity concerts, plays and lotteries were organised in Kishinev, the proceeds of which went to the Bulgarians. A collection of shoes, clothes and food for the Bulgarian volunteers took place in the capital and southern Bessarabia.\n\nThe formation of the Bulgarian volunteer detachment began in March 1877, and at the end of the same month 1. volunteers were gathered into the Armenian subaltern and from them three divisions were formed under the command of Major-General N. G. Stoletov.\n\n********************************************************\n\nThe chapel caretakers said that the icon in the centre (roses are always placed under it) is the only one in Moldova that helps cancer patients. That’s why many people bring expensive jewellery as a sign of gratitude.\n\nDuring the Soviet period, the chapel housed the Bulgarian Militia Memorial Museum.\n\nNot far from the chapel, in memory of the events of 1877 and in honour of Bulgarian-Soviet friendship, a 16-metre granite obelisk in the shape of a needle was erected in 1966, on the eve of the mistaken celebration of the 500th anniversary of Chisinau. The unveiling of the obelisk was attended by the guest of honour – Iury Gagarin, the first cosmonaut of the Earth. He also planted a tree next to the chapel.\n\nArmenian streets\n\nThe Armenian community has left a serious mark on the history and geography of Chisinau. In fact, the Armenian community feels honored that there is a street here that marks their identity and claims that the Armenian Apostolic Church “Holy Mother of God” in Chisinau, together with the Armenian street, is the place where all Armenians belonging to this area and who left their homes are reunited. And some curious moments will be described below:\n\n1. Historical sources speak about the existence of two Armenian streets. The first one (unofficial) was on the right side of the Bîc river (the old part of the town). The second, which was established in the new part of the city in 1835, when the new urban plan of Chisinau was being finalised, can still be easily found today on the street map of the capital of the Republic of Moldova.\n\n2. On 4 January 1817, describing the city of Chisinau, the English traveller William Mac-Michael wrote: “Among the strange crowd you could distinguish here (…) many Armenians, so numerous that they occupied a whole street. In the midst of the crowd (…) the carriage of an elegant and beautiful child, the daughter of the Armenian vicar, drove slowly along the narrow and sinful street (…) Such was the state of things … in the lower quarter of the bazaar (…)”.\n\n3. The lack of official street names in the old part of the city was due to the fact that most of them were inhabited by ethnic groups, being named after their inhabitants, and looked more like ethnic neighbourhoods. Ștefan Ciobanu’s claim that Armenians in the early 20th century were “ethnic groups” is not true. The Armenians lived on their street in the early 19th century – leads us to conclude that this could only be the street “covered in dust in summer, mud in spring and autumn, and darkness at night”, on which the Armenian Church “St. Mother of God” was built, which was also called the Old Church.\n\n4. The name ‘Old’ was later extended both to the church and to the street, which made the difference between the Armenian street in the old and the new part of the town, one longitudinal and the other transversal.\n\n5. The beginning of the second Armenian street is linked to the transfer to Chisinau, after 1812, of the Armenian Archdiocese, established in 1809, by an ucaz of Tsar Alexander I, on the territory of the Principalities of Moldavia and Muntenia.\n\n6. In 1813, for the Armenian Episcopal House in Chișinău, but also for the construction of parish houses, the governor of Basarabia assigned to the Armenian Archdiocese a territory with an area of about 25 thousand desetine of land (about 27 ha – n.n.), later included between the current streets bd. Stephen the Great and Holy, 31 August 1989, Tighina and Armenian Streets. The area of land made available constituted the “neighbourhood” occupied by the Armenian Archbishop Grigor Zakarian (1809-1828) in Chisinau. It was also called the Armenian Metropolitanate, and the archbishop had the status of metropolitan. According to the location project, the area of land given to the Archbishopric was called “Armenian courtyard” and was enclosed by a fence as the Russian denominations – Aрмянское подворье and Aрмянская ограда – tell us. The territory of the Archdiocese belonged to the monastery of Echmiadzin, the location of the Supreme Patriarch and All Armenian Catholic. The Bishop’s house inside the courtyard was located somewhere in the middle, now Bulgarian Street.\n\n7. In 1813, the first project of the city began to be drawn up, entrusted by the civil governor of Basarabia, Scarlat Sturza, to the governmental architect Mihail Ozmidov. The works for the formation of Chișinău as the capital of the province of Basarabia lasted until August 9, 1834, when the final plan of the city, with an orthogonal street layout, different from the local tradition, was approved by Nicholas I. The streets were named in 1818, when A. N. Bahmetiev, the military governor of Podolia, made a sketch of the city with the location of the streets up to the present M. Kogalniceanu Street. The name was given to the Armenian street in the “upper part” of the town, which was named after the immediate location of the Armenian Archdiocese. Near it, in 1825, the New Square (today Central) was opened, with movable and quite beautiful commercial spaces for that period. It was here that all merchants in Chisinau were obliged to sell their goods, and they were forbidden to trade near their houses in the old part of the city. Attached to the position of their own shops, 2000 Armenian, Bulgarian, Greek and Jewish owners expressed their dissatisfaction in a letter of 18 July 1826 to the civil governor of Bessarabia, V. F. Tishkovsky. However, things did not change, and the old market gradually lost its significance, as did the “lower part” of the town.\n\n8. In 1902, portions of the new and old Armenian Street were paved with granite brought from Podolia between 1888 and 1889. After the construction of the aqueduct by the engineer Haris on 15 December 1892, the Armenian street in the “upper part” of the town was supplied with water from the springs of the Great Fountain and the Artesian. Residents of the street who used the water had to pay for it. For example, those who drank up to 300 buckets of water a day were charged 25 kopecks, and those who drank more than 1,000 buckets a day only 12 kopecks. If the water was used for watering animals, only 1 kopeck per day was charged.\n\n9. A report of 29 December 1921 stated that the ‘foul-smelling’ dirt ‘reaches below all limits’. Stefan Ciobanu himself, by stating that “the most beautiful part of the city starts from Armenească Street”, seems to draw a line in this direction, showing us the existence of two worlds.\n\n10. On 29 February 1924, all the streets of Chisinau were renamed. The “upper” Armenian street was named the White Fortress, later in honour of Marshal Pietro Badoglio, and the “lower” one – Gh. Asachi. However, by inertia, both the population and the Romanian administration referred to them as Armenească and Veche Armenească. After June 28, 1940, the Soviet authorities restored the names of the streets existing until 1924. On 12 April 1941, when the city of Chisinau was divided into three urban districts: Stalinski, Krasnoarmeiski and Leninski, Armenian Street was part of the last one. That was also when the plan to rebuild Chisinau in Soviet style began to be implemented. As far as Armenian Street is concerned, after the decision of 7 December 1949, taken by the Soviet authorities regarding the nationalisation of building No. 47, i.e. the Armenian Diocesan House, there was nothing in this perimeter that reminded of the Armenian element once perpetuated in this territory. Today, with a length of 1.8 km, the Armenian street in Chisinau is one of the symbols that ‘tell’ not only the relationship between time and history, but also the history of the development of a socio-identity space in which the Armenian community was inscribed.\n\n(From the work of Lidia PRISAC, PhD in history and\n\nIon Valer XENOFONTOV, PhD in History)"
