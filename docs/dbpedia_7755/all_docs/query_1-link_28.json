        "text": "The book Locus Fratrum is the first attempt at a systematic analysis of the architecture and building practice of the last major medieval monastic order. The core of the book lies in chapters monitoring the history and building development of the individual monasteries in the territory of the Bohemian monastic province. The catalogue part is preceded by chapters summarizing the historical context of the Observant Franciscans’ activities in the second half of the fifteenth and the first half of the sixteenth centuries, during which the Observants experienced both rise and fall. The history of the order is followed by an exposition on the rules governing the foundation of convents, the monastic rules limiting artwork and above all the character of the order’s architecture.\n\nThe present guide grew out of a first draft prepared for a Summer Institute held at CEU in cooperation with CARA in 2000. We decided to enlarge and revise it for the session at the 40th Medieval Congress in Kalamazoo, with the help of friends and graduates of the Medieval Studies Department at Central European University (Budapest) and the support of the Centre for Medieval Studies, University of Toronto. None the less, it is still a draft, but we felt that half a loaf is more than none. The printed version is an abbreviated one; a more complete guide, with a list of major source-publications of the region will be available on CD-ROM as well as on the homepages of Medieval Studies, CEU and of the Centre of Medieval Studies in Toronto. The final editing and formatting of both the printed and electronic version was done by Zsolt Hunyadi, whom we all owe many thanks.\n\nA descriptive list for a collection of historical transcripts and other sources relating to the Irish Capuchin Franciscans. The collection includes transcribed material and surrogate copies of records covering the years from the foundation of the Capuchin mission in Ireland in 1615 to the re-establishment of the Irish Province of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin in 1885.\n\nLukáš Reitinger: Searching for the first reader, pp. 5-16; Daniel Soukup: Jewish Themes in the Liber depictus: A Comparative Analysis (Jewish Figures in the Liber depictus in the Light of the Clothing Customs in Medieval Ashkenaz - The Jewish Hat - Hairstyles and Head Coverings of Jewish Women - The Liber depictus and the Regulation of Jewish Clothing Elements - Jews in the Liber depictus and Their Spiritual Message - Ecclesia et Synagoga: Fiction and Reality in the Liber depictus), pp. 17-44"
