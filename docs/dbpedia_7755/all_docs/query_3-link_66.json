Originally published as journal articles and book chapters, they have been translated and appear here for the first time in English. The essays address a broad range of topics, including politics, religion, demography, everyday life, crime, and rural and urban society. They span in time from the Battle of Lipany on May 30, 1434, one of the recognized end points of the Hussite Wars (which is not well known outside of specialist circles), to the restructuring of Bohemian society in the 1620s following the defeat of Bohemian forces at the Battle of White Mountain on November 8, 1620, which is one of the most recognized events of early modern European history. The book is aimed primarily, but not only, at English-speaking students and scholars of late medieval and early modern European history who are interested in beginning a research project in Bohemian history, pursuing comparative studies, or simply want to expand their knowledge of European history. Their interest may have been sparked by reading a book on German or Central European history in which Bohemian developments appear prominently; hearing a Czech scholar present at a conference; or traveling to Prague, Český Krumlov, or a few other places in the Czech Republic designated as UNESCO World Heritage sites. New interest in Bohemian history arose in North America and Western Europe after the Velvet Revolution of 1989 (named for the relatively smooth nature of the regime change). The revolution loosened restrictions, and made it easier for students and scholars from western Europe and North America to travel to Czechoslovakia (since 1993, the Czech Republic) to conduct research, and gave students and scholars from the Czech Republic greater access to methodologies, theories, and historical scholarship outside of their countries. As a result, opportunities for dialogue have increased between Czech scholars, their neighbors in Central Europe, and the broader historical community in Europe and North America. The dissolution of communist rule and the subsequent entry of the Czech Republic into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (1999) and the European Union (2004) have also awakened new interest on all sides in the role of Europe’s smaller societies in central historical developments, and highlighted the need to better integrate the histories of Bohemia and other smaller societies into the broader European historical narrative. Despite growing interest and dialogue, a number of challenges remain today in study of, and research in, late medieval and early modern Bohemian history. First, Czech is not one of the common research languages which historians and other scholars in the humanities and social sciences learn. Those gaining access to the scholarship\n\nviii\n\npreface\n\nof the field have to turn to the available scholarship in English and German. This scholarship has made important contributions to our understanding of Bohemian history and its place in Central European history. In fact, much of what has entered Englishlanguage historical scholarship about Bohemia has come through related fields (especially Habsburg history), but his scholarship alone cannot provide a complete picture of the history and historical scholarship about this period, which is mostly in Czech. Beyond the linguistic challenge, other factors related to historical developments of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have been responsible for the relatively low level of familiarity in North America and Western Europe with Czech history and historical writing, and have made it difficult to understand the place of the Bohemian lands within European history. In particular, the national revival movement of the nineteenth century and specific features associated with the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the successor state to the Bohemian Crown Lands, and the emergence of a liberal progressive narrative of European history after the First World War, have relegated the history of the Czech lands in the medieval and early modern periods to the margins of western civilization. Communist rule through most of the second half of the twentieth century further reinforced the view that these lands were different and served to isolate Czech historians and Czech scholarship from western historiography.1 By bringing to English-speaking readers the rich history and historical writing of Bohemian lands, through the lens and words of Czech historians, the volume seeks to expand knowledge about the place of the Czech lands in late medieval and early modern Europe, and the rich mosaic and shared history of the peoples and cultures of Europe. While this is not the first collection of essays on Bohemian history in English or another Western European language, it is the first collection in English that contains essays devoted solely to history of the Bohemian lands in the late medieval and early modern period, which address a number of themes and were originally written for a Czech audience within the context of Czech historiography.2 This volume continues earlier efforts made in the 1960s during a period of loosening of restrictions in Czechoslovakia (known as “the Prague Spring”) and more recent ones since the Velvet Revolution to bring Czech scholarship to an English-speaking audience.3 It is inspired 1 Although not the first to note this, Geoffrey Barraclough poignantly expressed the problem decades ago after the end of the Prague Spring in “Introduction: Towards a New Concept of European History,” in Eastern and Western Europe in the Middle Ages, eds. F. Graus, K. Bosl, F. Seibt, M.M. Postan, and A. Gieysztor (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1970), 7–14. 2 The best single-volume collection in English on Bohemian history throughout the ages is Mikuláš Teich, ed., Bohemia in History (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998). 3 Josef Polišenský, The Thirty Years War, trans. R. Evans (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971); František Bartoš, The Hussite Revolution 1424–1437, ed. and trans. by John M. Klassen (Boulder and New York: East European Monographs and Columbia University Press, 1986); Zdeněk V. David and David R. Holeton, eds., The Bohemian Reformation and Religious\n\npreface\n\nix\n\nby collections published in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s that expanded knowledge in North America of the historical scholarship of two other European societies, the Annales in France and microhistory in Italy;4 and the translation of seminal essays and monographs on the social history of the German Reformation, which helped broaden that approach into a field of international historical scholarship.5 This book is divided into four main sections. The introduction places the territories and early history of the Bohemian lands and the historical narratives on this period within modern Czech historical scholarship. This is followed by the collection of the original Czech essays in English translation, which were undertaken by two translators with extensive experience (see “About the Translators” at the end of the volume). Each essay also has its own brief introduction, situating the approach, argument, and contributions within the broader historiographical context. A bibliography at the end of the volume lists major works of late medieval and early modern Bohemian history by both Czech and non-Czech scholars. This book would not have been possible without support from the International Research and Exchange Board (IREX) and the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS), which enabled me to spend an extended period of three years as a guest scholar at the Philosophical Faculty of the Charles University in Prague; and later invitations from Winfried Eberhard and Václav Bůžek for extended sojourns as an international guest scholar at the Centre for the History and Culture of East Central Europe (Geisteswissenschaftliches Zentrum Geschichte und Kultur Ostmitteleuropas) in Leipzig, Germany, and at the University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice, Czech Republic, respectively. These visits allowed relationships to form which have grown through the years. Special thanks to: Jiří Mikulec for helping me stay informed on new historical scholarship and granting me access to the library of the Historical Institute Practice, vols. 1–8 (Prague: Main Library of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and Collegium Europaeum, 1996–2011); Gary B. Cohen and Franz A.J. Szabo, eds., Embodiments of Power: Building Baroque Cities in Europe (New York: Berghahn, 2008). 4 The following Selections from the Annales: économies, sociétés, civilisations, edited by Robert Forster and Orest Ranum have been published by the Johns Hopkins University Press: Biology and Man in History (1975), Family and Society (1976), Deviants and the Abandoned in French Society ((1978), Food and Drink in French Society (1979), and Medicine and Society in France (1980). Ed Muir and Guido Ruggiero have edited Selections from the Quaderni Storici, also published by the Johns Hopkins University Press: Sex and Gender in Historical Perspective (1990), Microhistory and the Lost Peoples of Europe (1991), and History from Crime (1994). 5 Two among a larger body of works: Bernd Moeller, Imperial Cities and the Reformation. Three Essays, trans. by H.C. Erik Midelfort and Mark U. Edwards (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1972); Peter Blickle. The Revolution of 1525: The German Peasant’s War from a New Perspective, trans. by Thomas A. Brady, Jr. and H.C. Erik Midelfort (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1981).\n\nx\n\npreface\n\nof the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Petr Kreuz for being generous with his own work and insights in legal history, and Michal Šroněk and Ivan Muchta of the Institute for the History and Theory of Art of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic for their insight on art and cultural history. Joachim Bahlcke and Winfried Eberhard, who welcomed me in German circles, and R.J.W. Evans have served as role models for reassessing Bohemian history within a broader Central European and European context. The spectre of the first three Habsburg kings of Bohemia, who rest in their own mausoleum in St. Vitus Cathedral on Prague’s Castle Hill, and the works of the historians who have studied them, have also influenced my perspective in more profound ways than is evident in the citations and references of this volume. Ronnie Po-chia Hsia first suggested to me the value of such a collection and to consider editing one. Gerhard Jaritz and Paul Knoll supported earlier efforts at a bibliography of East Central Europe. Ed Muir gave sage advice on translations drawing on his own work. I also benefited from fruitful discussions with Michael Geyer about problematic issues of Central European history and global history. Tom Brady has impressed on me through his scholarship the need to take national narratives seriously without shying away from considering broader questions and connections.6 Special thanks to the Burnham-Macmillan Endowment Fund of the Department of History, and the Faculty Research and Creative Activities Award (FRAACA) and Support for Faculty Scholars Award (SFSA) programs of Western Michigan University, which funded the translations; and especially to the late Catherine Julien and Marion (Buddy) Gray who provided valuable assistance in the application process to these and other funding sources. Thanks also to two colleagues at WMU, José António (Joe) Brandão and James Murray, with whom I co-taught two separate graduate seminars: “Ethnohistory: Early Modern Worlds” and “Princes and their Cities in Burgundian and Habsburg Europe,” the latter of which was offered at the Newberry Library Center for Renaissance Studies in Chicago. These collaborations have expanded my perspective, geographically and chronologically, and in a number of other important ways. Judy Stone, Bob Berkhofer, and a number of other colleagues, past and present, have helped make WMU a good place to work. Last, but not least, thanks to Jason Glatz of WMU Libraries for producing the map in this volume; David Kutzko for assistance with some Latin references; Pat Hollahan, Shannon Cunningham, and Jiří Hrbek for helping me with various aspects of the original proposal and final manuscript; and Joe Brandão, Zdeněk David, Paul Knoll, Jaroslav Pánek, and two anonymous reviewers, who provided critical comments on earlier versions of the introduction. Responsibility for the final version rests solely with me.\n\n6 For example, Thomas A.

In other cases, the names of places appear in the language of the country in which they are currently located. (One exception to this practice appears in the footnotes of Chapter 3 where the place of publication of a few Polish-language works, published before 1939, is listed in Polish as Lwów, rather than the Ukrainian Lviv, to assist readers who wish to find these works.) In instances when places formerly within the Bohemian Crown Lands are no longer today within one of Bohemia’s successor states, the Czech term is used with the current name of the city placed in square brackets: e.g. Vratislav [Polish Wrocław]. For the two main rivers, the terms Vltava (not Moldau) and Elbe are used. See the Glossary of Place-Names for a list of commonly used equivalents of place-names in Czech, German, and Polish. Likewise, English proper names are used when commonly accepted forms exist (e.g. Charles for Karel, Jiří for George, William for Vilém), although the first time they appear the Czech (or Polish) name may be used in square brackets. One exception is the name Václav which appears in its Czech form (rather than using the older English name Wenceslaus). Following a more contemporary practice, some family and dynastic names will appear in a slightly anglicized form of the Czech name to preserve the Czech (rather than adopting the German name): e.g. William of Rožmberk (for Vilém z Rožmberku, not William of Rosenberg) and Vratislav of Pernštejn (for Vratislav z Pernštejna, not Vratislav of Pernstein); and the plural forms Rožmberks, Pernštejns, and Lobkovices. Most of the essays appear in their entirety (i.e. as translations of complete articles or complete books chapters), but a few are excerpts from longer articles and chapters, which were selected by the editor. In cases of excerpts, ellipses in square brackets [. . .] indicate where text has been omitted. This holds also for text in footnotes, which in its original form was almost as extensive as the main text. In cases where the original text indicated omissions, ellipses are used without brackets. To make it easier for the reader to compare the translated texts and footnotes with the originals, in cases of excerpts, the footnote number from the original Czech publication appears in brackets to the right of the continuous footnote number; for example.54 [120] Any notes and comments from the editor that appear in the main text and foonotes are in square brackets. Words appear in the main text in italics when they are foreign terms or are italicized in the original Czech text. (The one exception is the introduction to each of the essays which appear in italics and citations to books in normal font style.) The original text of Chapter One also contained some phrases in bold. In some cases these are quotes from primary sources, which the author of Chapter One indicated were originally in bold or highlighted in these sources. In other cases, the text is put in bold by the author\n\nnotes on the text and translations\n\nxv\n\nof Chapter One. In both cases, the author indicated this in a note in parentheses. The author’s parenthetical marks appear in the translations, but these phrases do not appear in bold. In the footnotes, running text is translated into English, but not the titles of books, articles, etc. However, in the Select Bibliography, readers can find the titles of major works in their original Czech (and in a few cases Polish) and in English translation. Primary Sources are cited as they are in the original texts. Readers should note that the Státní ústřední archiv [The State Central Archives] was renamed in 2005 to Národní archiv [National Archive]. See the List of Abbreviations. Each essay was translated by one of two translators. About the Translators provides a brief background of the translators and the Table of Contents identifies the translator of each essay.

The population of these lands, estimated at between 1.25 to 2 million by the sixteenth century, was both multilingual and multi-religious, and included Czech, German, Polish, and Sorbian speakers, as well as Catholics, Protestants, and one of the largest Jewish populations in Europe.1 Bohemia and Moravia, the historical core of the Bohemian Crown Lands, sit on a plateau protected by bands of rich forests and mountains to the north and west, which have served throughout history as natural boundaries but not as barriers to adjacent societies: the German lands in the north and northwest, Poland to the northeast, Austria to the south, and Hungary to the southeast. With the exception of the Elbe River, into which Bohemia’s longest river, the Vltava, flows in the north, and the nearby Danube River in the south. The Crown Lands lack access to sea and to major navigable waterways and are, thus, positioned outside of Europe’s major trade routes. But these lands were situated on some important secondary trade routes of the period, linking them to markets in Nuremberg, Linz, and Leipzig with connections to major trade centers in the Low Countries, England, and Italy, and the Bohemian Crown Lands played a major role in regional trade, production, and consumption. Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia were settled as far back as the Neolithic Age (6000–5500 B.C.E.), and formed the eastern edge of ancient Celtic expansion (fourth century B.C.E.) before the Germanic, then the Slavic, peoples settled in the region in fourth to seventh centuries C.E. The name Bohemia derives from the Celtic tribe of Boii (Boiohaemum), which became the root of the Latin and German terms (Bohemia, Böhmen). Czechs and Moravians refer to 1 Sorbian is a west Slavic language that is closely related to Czech and Polish and is spoken primarily in Lusatia. The population estimate is from Ludmila Fialová et al., Dějiny obyvatelstva českých zemí (Prague: Mladá fronta, 1998), 100–101. One estimate of the break-down of population estimates by territory at the beginning of the sixteenth century is Bohemia (1–2.25 million), Moravia (585,000–620,000), and Silesia (860,000–940,000); Joachim Bahlcke, Regionalismus und Staatsintegration im Widerstreit.

(Čechy and Morava; adj. český, moravský). In the tenth century, Silesia (Czech Slezko, Polish Śląsk, German Schlesien) was incorporated into the Polish state. With the fragmentation of Poland in the twelfth century, Silesia divided into independent duchies, which came under German, Bohemian, and Polish influence. Upper Lusatia and Lower Lusatia evolved out of territories settled and ruled by the Milzane and Lunsizi, respectively, the largest Slavic tribes between the Salle and Oder River. The latter tribe gave its name to the territories (Czech Lužíce, German Lausitz). The beginnings of the Bohemian state date back to the middle of the ninth and early tenth century when the Premyslid dynasty consolidated power along the Vltava River and eventually established a residence on a hill overlooking a bend of the river known today as Prague Castle Hill.2 The conversion of the Premyslids to Christianity (ca. 883) helped strengthen their home power base by because it led them gaining recognition from outside powers, especially the neighboring Eastern Frankish Empire whose leaders viewed Bohemia as a zone of influence. In the late ninth and tenth century, the Premyslids became more powerful and their relationship with political and ecclesiastical leaders in neighboring Regensburg, East Franconia, and Bavaria grew closer with the impending break-up of the Great Moravian Empire, a early state formation, which extended over parts of Bohemia, Moravia, today’s Slovakia, and the Danubian lowlands, and because of the threat of attack by Magyars (the people who settled neighboring Hungary). During the reign of Duke Václav (ca. 907–935 C.E.), Bohemia experienced an intensification of missionary activity from Bavaria, especially the Cathedral Chapter of St. Emmeram in Regensburg. Reports of the first churches in Bohemia date from this period, especially the St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague, which later became the Metropolitan church and coronation and burial site of Bohemian kings. The foundation of the bishopric of Prague in 983, independent of Salzburg (Regensburg’s metropolitan) and subordinate to Mainz, shifted ties from the regional to the imperial sphere and strengthened the authority and standing of the Premyslids. In the twelfth century, imperial and local leaders first recognized the Bohemian rulers as kings. During this time, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa took over Moravia as an imperial appanage and declared it a free margraviate, but shortly thereafter 2 For an excellent, recent survey of Bohemian history from pre-historic times to the formation of the Czech Republic, see Jaroslav Pánek, Oldřích Tůma et al., A History of the Czech Lands, trans. by Justin Quinn, Petra Key, and Lea Bennis (Prague: Karolinum, 2009).

John of Luxembourg (1310–1346) gained control of the six-city federation (Bautzen, Görlitz, Zittau, Kamenz, Lauban, and Löbau) which, in the fifteenth century, which began to be referred to as Upper Lusatia. Much of Silesia, especially the area around the present-day Polish city of Wrocław, which by the fifteenth century had undergone a process of consolidation, also came to be controlled by John. John’s son and successor, Charles IV (Bohemian King 1346–1378; Roman King from 1346; Holy Roman Emperor from 1355), born Václav and later adopting his new name in honor of Charlemagne, acquired Lower Lusatia. During Charles IV’s reign the term “Bohemian Crown Lands” was first used to refer to the group of territories under the Bohemian crown. After being elected Holy Roman Emperor, Charles IV introduced the Golden Bull which made the King of Bohemia a member of the Electoral College, which selected the Holy Roman Emperor when the imperial seat became vacant. He also successfully petitioned the Pope to elevate Prague to an archbishopric, expanded and redesigned Prague into a monumental residential city, and founded the Charles University in Prague, the first university in central Europe.4 During the reign of Charles IV’s successor, Václav IV (1378–1419), a religious reform movement arose in Bohemia. The Hussite movement was named after Prague Master Jan Hus, who became the rallying force and martyr of the movement after his execution at the Council of Constance in 1415. In the early fifteenth century the movement led to the Hussite Revolution which created one of the greatest social and political upheavals of the late Middle Ages. The catalyst for the transformation of the reform movement into a revolution was a popular uprising that broke out on July 30, 1419 following a mass and procession which began at the Church and Cloister of Mary of the Snows in the New City of Prague and ended at the New City Hall. There, thirteen individuals, including urban magistrates and their assistants, were tossed from the window of the city hall tower in an act which was later became referred to as “defenestration” (from the Latin de fenestra: “from a window”).5 In the following 3 See Lisa Wolverton, Hastening Towards Prague: Power and Society in the Medieval Czech Lands (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011). 4 On Charles IV’s reign, see the companion volume to a major exhibition: Barbara Drake Boehm and Jiří Fajt, eds.

Among the factions which developed were radical groups, such as the Taborites, Adamites, Orebites, and others, who developed communal societies based on biblical authority and called for a return to the primitive church. The death of the King and the defection of Archbishop Konrad of Vechta to the Hussite side two years later left the lands without secular and religious heads. In 1420, the Pope sent a crusading army, led by Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, the younger brother of, and successor to, Václav IV (whom most members of Bohemian estates did not accept as King of Bohemia) to Bohemia to stamp out the Hussite “heresy.” The Hussites organized forces to defend Bohemia against the crusading army. (The forces of Tábor were led by Jan Žizka, who in later times became a legendary folk hero.) But the arrival of crusading armies also aggravated continuing fighting between Bohemian factions, and turned Bohemia upside down and put its relationship with the universal church and the rest of Europe in question. In 1421 the factions affiliated with the Hussite movement agreed on the core principles of the Articles of Prague, which called for freedom of preaching, frequent lay communion in two kinds (i.e. both the bread the wine), poverty of the clergy and exproporiation of church property, and punishment of sins against God’s law. But after 1421 struggles continued between factions and leagues for control of the movement and kingdom. The Hussite Wars came to an end at the Battle of Lipany on May 30, 1434, when an army of the Catholic and moderate Hussite nobility defeated radical Hussite forces and their allies. The end of hostilities, however, left a number of major unresolved issues within Bohemia and Bohemia’s relationship with the rest of Europe. Although the Council of Constance had declared Hus a heretic, Hus’s followers and their descendants did not identify themselves as a faction separate from the Church. In 1433, the Church and the Utraquists, a moderate branch of the Hussites, had reached a compromise agreement, the Compactata, at the Council of Basel, henceforth referred to in this work as the Compacts of Basel. (The Utraquists were named after their belief in frequent lay communion of both bread and wine; literally, sub utraque specie, in two kinds.) The Compacts of Basel allowed the lay celebration of the Eucharist in two kinds, but did not make it obligatory for all residents of the Bohemian lands, as the Utraquists had wished. The Compacts of Basel established a religious dualism in the Bohemian lands by guaranteeing the rights of both Utraquists and Catholics. Three years later, in 1436, at a meeting in the eastern Bohemian city of Jihlava, the Bohemian estates ratified the Compacts of Basel (the ratified version is sometimes referred to as the Compacts of Jihlava), and officially recognized Sigismund as King of Bohemia. Although Pope Pius II\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\nabrogated the Compact agreement in 1462, the Utraquists contined to adhere to it and hoped for a reconciliation. The Unitas Fratrum or Unity of the Brethren, the other major religious group in Bohemia alongside the Utraquists and Catholics, which had been influenced by some radical Hussite traditions, did not adhere to the Compacts of Basel. But the kings of Bohemia on their ascent to the throne were obligated to accept the Compact agreement after having been elected by the estates.6 Within Bohemia, a series of individuals assumed royal authority after the death of Sigismund of Luxembourg in 1437, one of the most important of which was George of Poděbrady (Czech Jiří z Poděbrad; 1458–1471). Real control of the lands, however, remained in the hands of the estates of the upper and lower nobility and the royal cities.7 The Jagellonian dynasty that ruled neighboring Poland and Lithuania ascended to the Bohemian throne in 1471 and brought about a brief political rapprochement in East Central Europe.8 The Jagellonian rulers sought to pave the way for the religious conciliation of the Bohemians with the rest of Christendom. Under the reign of King Vladislav II Jagiellon (Bohemian King, 1471–1516), an earnest program of Catholic reform was introduced, although not without opposition. In 1483, following an attempt by Vladislav to install city councilors in Prague who were sympathetic to his policies, a group of burghers attacked and tossed some of the councilors out of the city halls of the Old and New City in a second incident of defenestration.9 In 1485, a state of bi-confessional parity or equilibrium was declared with the Peace of Kutná Hora (German Kuttenberg), affirming Utraquism and Catholicism as the only legally sanctioned religions and outlawing other groups, such as the Unity of the Brethren.10 Like the Compacts of Basel, the Peace of Kutná Hora was viewed by many Bohemians as a provisional compromise that would remain in effect until reconciliation could occur. Until then, the archbishopric seat would remain vacant, and two consistories were established to administer religious affairs: a Catholic or Upper Consistory, named after its location in St. Vitus Cathedral on Castle Hill, administered by the cathedral canons; and an Utraquist or Lower Consistory located below the castle in the Old City at the Church of St. Mary on the Teyn. Although the Unity of the Brethren were excluded from this agreement and, beginning with the 6 7 8 9 10\n\nFrantišek Šmahel, Husitská revoluce, vol. 3 (Prague: UK 1993).

In 1500, a new land ordinance was issued. Called the Vladislav Land Ordinance (Vladislavské zřízení zemské) because it was endorsed by the King Vladislav, it outlined the basic constitutional issues of the post-Hussite era. Revisions of the land ordinance were periodically issued in subsequent decades. The nobility and royal cities debated for some time a number of provisions of the ordinance which the royal cities believed did not acknowledge their position. A compromise was reached in 1517 with the St. Václav’s Day Agreement, which recognized the prerogative of the royal cities in legal matters within the cities, but granted the nobility certain exclusions from urban law. Strong royal rule did not return to Bohemia until the ascent of the Habsburgs to the throne in 1526 after Louis II Jagiellon (King of the Bohemian Crown Lands, 1516–1526) was killed at the Battle of Mohács in Hungary fighting the Turks. Louis’s successor, Ferdinand I Habsburg (King of the Bohemian Crown Lands, 1526–1564; Holy Roman Emperor from 1556) was viewed by the estates as best able to deal with the Turkish threat and was married to Louis’s sister Anna Jagiellon in a dynastic arrangement dating back to 1515. In 1527, Ferdinand introduced administrative reform in his lands through the issuance of a Court Executive Order (Hofstaatsordnung) that established new institutions in addition to estate institutions in the individual lands of his monarchy. The new institutions included the Privy Council (Geheime Rat), which was the main advisory council of the ruler, and the Court Chamber (Hofkammer), which served as the central office for fiscal matters. The latter were followed in 1556 with the Court War Council (Hofkriegsrat). In time, these institutions would serve not only to centralize Habsburg power, but also acted as a vehicle for estate leaders to exercise power within the new system. In the meantime, in the early years of his reign, Ferdinand, who ruled the Bohemian lands from Vienna, generally sought to uphold the status quo, by supporting the Basel Compacts and working with leading estate officials and the Diets of the constituent lands, the most prominent and influential of which was the Diet of Bohemia proper. The leading estate offices in Bohemia proper were the Supreme Burgrave (Czech nejvyšší purkrabí; German Oberstburgraf ) and Supreme Chancellor (Czech nejvyšší kancleř; German Obersthofkanzler); in Moravia, the Land hejtman (Czech zemský hejtman); in Silesia, the Supreme hejtman (nejvýšší hejtman); and in Lusatia, the Land Governors (zemský fojt). In the early years of Ferdinand’s reign, religion was not in the forefront of relations with his Bohemian subjects. But even before Ferdinand ascended to the Bohemian throne new religious ideas and movements had come to Bohemia\n\nintroduction\n\n7\n\nfrom other areas of Europe. As early as 1517, Thomas Müntzer preached in the Bethlehem Chapel in Prague which had been home to Jan Hus. In 1519, Martin Luther openly supported some of Hus’s teaching in the Leipzig Disputation with Johannes Eck. The Evangelical or Lutheran Reformation found early supporters in the Bohemian Crown Lands, largely among the German-speaking population in northwest Bohemia, Silesia, and Lusatia, but also among some Czech-speaking residents of Prague and other royal cities. However, the evangelical movement did not turn Utraquists or the Brethren into Lutherans, but led rather to a realignment of these movements and a series of short-term rapprochements between the religious groups. (This subject, of some debate in modern scholarship, will be discussed later in the introduction and in some of the contributors’ essays.) Over time, the introduction of foreign rule and new religious ideas led to tensions within Bohemian society and played a role in development of opposition to Habsburg rule in the mid-1540s. The first open revolt against Habsburg rule occurred in 1547 when the Bohemian estates refused to fully support the imperial campaign in the Schmalkaldic War (1546–1547), led by Ferdinand’s brother, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V.11 In the wake of the revolt Ferdinand sought to punish the estates, especially the royal cities, which numbered approximately fifty at this time. 12 Ferdinand revoked urban privileges, confiscated properties, and installed in each of the royal cities a royal hejtman (Czech královský hejtman) and royal magistrate (Czech královský rychtář), to oversee the activities of the councils and courts, respectively. He also sent his son, Archduke Ferdinand of Tyrol, to reside in Bohemia as his viceroy (German Statthalter; Czech místodržící), Some of the privileges and properties were eventually returned, but the revocation of privileges and properties, even if symbolic, were aimed at curtailing the power of the royal cities, and humiliating those who ran them. They had enjoyed too prominent a place in estate politics since the Hussite Revolution. After the defeat of the Bohemian Uprising of 1547, Ferdinand I also turned to Catholic reform as a tool to centralize power. He actively engaged in and supported Catholic reform by inviting the Jesuits to establish the first college in 1555 in the Old City of Prague, while continuing to acknowledge the status quo. Jesuit Colleges were later founded in Český Krumlov (1584), Chomutov (1590) 11\n\n12\n\nPetr Vorel, ed., Stavovský odboj roku 1547: První krize Habsburské monarchie (Pardubice and Prague: Východočeské muzeum, HÚ, and Ústavem českých dějin filozofické fakulty UK, 1999).

Ferdinand I also worked to renew the archbishopric of Prague which involved negotiations with the papacy and the Bohemian estates regarding religious affairs and restitution of ecclesiastical property. In 1561, Antonín Brus of Mohelnice was installed as Archbishop of Prague (served 1561–1580), renewing the seat which had been vacant since the Hussite age. Brus and his successors, Martin Medek (Archbishop of Prague, 1581–1590), Zbyněk Berka z Duba (1592–1606), and Charles of Lamberk (1607–1612) took an active interest in the renewal of Catholic religious institutions, reforming the clergy, and playing a role in mediating disputes between ecclesiastical and urban forces. Medek introduced the Gregorian calendar in 1584. In Moravia, Catholic reforms efforts were actively pursued by the bishops of Olomouc, especially Wilhelm Prusinovský (1565–72), Stanislaus Pavlovský (1579–98, and Franz Cardinal of Dietrichstein (1599–1636).13 More subtle changes within Bohemian society also unfolded in the second half of the sixteenth century as Bohemians sought out different ways to accommodate to Habsburg rule. The residence of Archduke Ferdinand of Tyrol in Prague attracted nobles from leading families, such as the Rožmberks, Pernštějns, and Martinices, to establish residence and build urban palaces near the royal castle. They did not, however, fail to expand their residences in their dynastic homes in Český Krumlov (Rožmberks), Pardubice (Pernštejns) and elsewhere. Through affiliations with the Habsburg court Bohemian nobles were able to establish ties with major noble houses in other areas of Europe and begin to breakdown the isolation of the Bohemians from Europe which had developed in the Hussite age. They were also less reluctant to assume royal posts. As holders of estate and royal offices, many Catholic nobles pursued a conservative political program, advancing the idea of a balance of power between the nobility and the Habsburg monarchy or seeking to dominate the domestic scene to the detriment of their Protestant peers, while allowing the Habsburgs full authority to define foreign policy. At the same time, Protestant nobles sought to keep their exclusive position. None of these trends precluded opposition to Habsburg rule, when it was necessary or opportune—a theme which will discussed later in the introduction and addressed in a number of the essays in this volume.14 13 14\n\nSee Ondřej Jakubec, Kulturní prostředí a mecenát olomouckých biskupů potridenské doby (Olomouc: Univerzita Palackého, 2003).

But King Maximilian II Habsburg (1564–1576), who had succeeded Ferdinand I, did not definitively approve it. In 1583, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia Rudolf II (1576–1611) moved the imperial court from Vienna to Prague, and the city became imperial residence for the second time since the reign of Charles IV in the fourteenth century. At the Prague court Rudolf assembled a large array of foreign artists, artisans and scientists who made important contribution to late Renaissance culture and learning. Among them were the astronomers Tycho Brahe (1546– 1601) and Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), the painters Bartholomeus Spranger (1546–1611) and Giuseppe Arcimboldo (c. 1530–1593), and the sculptor Adrian de Bries (c. 1560–1626). Rudolf’s Kunstkammer, located in the Prague Castle, was the largest art collection in the Europe of that day. With a population of about sixty thousand people, Prague by the year 1600 had become the largest urban center in Central Europe. The second-largest city in the Bohemian Crown Lands was Vratislav (today the Polish city Wrocław; German Breslau), the main city of Silesia, which had a population of about 23,000. The second largest city in Bohemia proper was Jachýmov (German Joachimsthal). Founded in the early sixteenth century by the Counts of Schlick during the silver rush in the Ore Mountains (Czech Krušné hory; German Erzgebirge), its population grew to 18,000 in a few decades. The population of Olomouc, the main city in Moravia, grew to about 8000 by the end of the sixteenth century.15 On July 9, 1609, Rudolf II issued a ruling known as a Letter of Majesty that declared freedom of religion in Bohemia. This landmark piece of legislation permitted all confessional groups to build their own churches and practice freely and included the Bohemian Brethren and Calvinists, who had been forbidden to openly practice since the Peace of Kutná Hora in 1485. The origins and background to the Majesty lie not in religious toleration and can be traced to the Bocskay uprising of 1604 in Hungary. The latter served as a catalyst for the formation of a confederation of Hungarian and Austrian estates against emperor Rudolf II led by Rudolf’s brother Matthias, which is referred to in Habsburg dynastic history as “the Brother’s Quarrel” (Der Bruderzwist\n\n15\n\nHerrschaft 1526–1620,” Mitteilungen des Instituts für österreischische Geschichtsforschung 98 (1989): 53–82.

Renewing a practice first established during negotiations for the Bohemian Confession in 1575, a group of fifteen defensors were elected in 1609 to defend the Letter of Majesty. Two years later, the hopes of many in Bohemia were thwarted when troops of Leopold, the Bishop of Passau and Rudolf II’s cousin, invaded Bohemia, what could be viewed as an attempt to pressure Rudolf to revoke what he had promised in the Majesty. Another revolt in 1618, initiated this time by a group of radical Protestant nobles against Habsburg-Catholic policies, brought about a coup d’état in Bohemia, which also served as the catalyst for the outbreak of the Thirty Years War (1618–1648). The opening and closing act of this revolt—the tossing of two Bohemian Catholic noblemen and one of their servants out of a second-floor window of the Prague Castle on May 23, 1618 (a third defenestration) and the defeat of Bohemian forces at the Battle of White Mountain on a field outside of Prague on November 7, 1620, followed by the public execution of twentyseven leaders of the revolt on Old Town Square on June 21, 1621—were major media events in their day and today are three of the most well-known events of early modern European history.17 Two days after the defenestration of 1618 the leaders issued a justification for the uprising in the “First Apology of the Bohemian Estates,” which outlined the major grievances against the Catholic party and royal representatives. It was followed in December 1618 by a “Second Apology of the Bohemian Estates.” On July 31, 1619, the Act of Confederation was issued, which brought about a new constitutional arrangement that modified the relations between the constituent territories of the Bohemian Crown, putting them on equal footing, and establishing common procedures to ensure the unified defense of the state. The guiding principle was the dominance of the estates over the ruler. It also placed the Protestant majority in a privileged\n\n16\n\n17\n\nPaula Sutter Fichtner, “When Brothers Disagree: Bohemia, the Habsburgs, and the Schmalkaldic Wars, 1546–1547,” Austrian History Yearbook 11 (1975): 67–78; Václav Bůžek, ed., Ein Bruderzwist im Hause Habsburg (1608–1611), OH 14 (České Budejovice: HÚFFJUČB, 2010).

He is often referred to as “the Winter King” for his short reign, which ended at the Battle of White Mountain.19 As the Thirty Years War continued in other areas of Europe, the Habsburgs sought to more fully incorporate the Bohemian Crown lands into their monarchy, punishing the estates with property confiscations and issued a mandate to re-Catholicize the royal cities. Their efforts culminated in the Renewed Land Ordinances in Bohemia and Moravia in 1627 and 1628, respectively, (Czech Obnovené Zřízení Zemské), which brought about a major change in the confessional status quo and constitutional law in place since the institution of the Peace of Kutná Hora in 1485 and the land ordinances in 1500. The statutes of the Renewed Land Ordinances removed the right of the Bohemian estates to elect their king, recognized the Habsburgs as hereditary monarchs, abolished Rudolf II’s Letter of Majesty of 1609 that granted freedom of worship to non-Catholics, reconstituted the clergy as an estate (though permitting Catholicism as the only legal confession), ordered nobles to convert or emigrate, and granted the Habsburg rulers the right to grant citizenship to foreigners. One of the most famous exiles was Jan Amos Komenský (1592–1670), also known as Johannes Amos Comenius, who was the last bishop of the Unity of the Brethren, a philosopher, and education reformer, who continued to thrive as a scholar in his new home in the Low Countries. In the 1635 Peace of Prague (which followed a long and complicated series of negotiations between Bohemia, Saxony, and Brandenburg), Upper and Lower Lusatia were annexed to the Electorate of Saxony. Already during the Estate Revolt, Silesia had been granted a special, somewhat autonomous status and in 1742 was ultimately ceded to Prussia. While contemporaries and earlier scholarship viewed (strictly in terms of demography) the effects of the Thirty Years War as catastrophic, recent Czech scholarship has presented a more modest reassessment. As a result of the war, exile, and recurrent plagues and food shortages, up to 30% of the total population and about 20% of settlements may have been lost. However, most of these loses were regained by the end of the seventeenth century.20 Current\n\n18 19 20\n\nI borrow a description of these moves from Pánek, Tůma, et al., A History of the Czech Lands, 223–224.

These include the unresolved issues of religious and secular authority which first arose in the post-Hussite period. This placed Bohemia, a century before the Reformations in Western Europe, in a precarious position with the Universal Church, left the archbishop’s seat vacant, and control of the kingdom in the hands of the estates. And many of these issues remain unresolved into the sixteenth century when two new forces come to Bohemia: new rulers from the Habsburg dynasty and new ideas of religious reform from the Holy Roman Empire and other areas of central and Western Europe. Another interesting feature of Bohemian history is the complex relationship that the Bohemians had with their foreign rulers, especially the Habsburgs, and the changes within multi-lingual and -confessional Bohemian society, which ultimately lead to the outbreak of the Thirty Years War. The impact of the Thirty Years War on Bohemian society is a significant subject in its own right. There is some important English- and German-language scholarship on the Hussite movement and revolution in the form of a number of monograph studies, including the monumental work by the American medievalist Howard Kaminsky;22 a German translation of the authoritative history by the Czech medievalist František Šmahel;23 and studies by John Klassen, David Holeton and Thomas Fudge on the nobility as a major player in the Hussite Revolution, the Hussite practice of the communion of infants, and Hussite propaganda, respectively.24 Zdeněk David has authored two works that critically decon21\n\nFor example, see Josef Grulich, Populační vývoj a životní cyklus venkovského obyvatelstva na jihu Čech v 16. až 17. století, MH 10 (České Budějovice: HÚFFJUČB, 2008). 22 Kaminsky, A History of the Hussite Revolution. 23 Šmahel, Die Hussitische Revolution; first Czech edition, Husitská revoluce, vols. 1–4 (Prague: UK, 1993). 24 John Klassen, The Nobility and the Making of the Hussite Revolution (New York and Boulder: East European Quarterly and Columbia University Press, 1978); David R.

In these works Eberhard shows that already decades before the Catholic Habsburg came to Bohemia, important changes took place not only between, but also within confessions, and confession served as a rallying point around which parties and ideologies formed within estate society that shaped the ever changing character and dynamic of estate society. And after the Habsburgs acended to the Bohemian throne, two different forms of rule (estate and royal) developed that competed against one another in an open process without a clear outcome, but which ultimately cultiminated in an uprising that took place during the Schmalkaldic War.27 A major international reassessment of the Thirty Years War in the 1970s led to the translation into English and German of works 25\n\n26\n\n27\n\nZdeněk V.

R.J.W. Evans’ The Making of the Habsburg Monarchy played a seminal role in drawing attention to the role of Bohemia (and Hungary, the Austrian hereditary lands, and the Holy Roman Empire) in the making of the Habsburg monarchy. Evans writes that “[u]ltimately the monarchy was made by Baroque and Counter-Reformation . . . with the decisive years for its formation lay in the seventeenth century . . . [However,] the genesis of Baroque must be sought [in the period starting around 1500] when Central Europe embarked on a protracted and highly complex period of tradition.” According to Evans, Bohemia, ruled by strong estates and possessing a long tradition of religious reform, responded to Habsburg rule with limited acceptance, in contrast to Hungary with limited rejection and the Empire with limited hegemony.”29 R.J.W. Evans’ Rudolf II and His World contributed to the development of international and multi-disciplinary research that took off in the 1980s on the court and culture of Rudolf II in Prague, which include important studies by the American art historian Thomas DaCosta Kaufman and the Austrian historian Karl Vocelka.30 Their works highlight in different ways the many international influences at the imperial court in Prague, different strategies of cultural and political communication, and how these factors contributed to making Prague c. 1600 into a major European center of late Renaissance culture. Habsburg scholarship continues to be a active, vital area of research, extending beyond dynastic, political history to include work in cultural history and, more recently, comparative studies across the Habsburg empire.31 28\n\n29 30\n\n31\n\nJosef V.

Despite the importance of these works, English- and German-language scholarship alone cannot provide a thorough treatment of the historical developments and debates; and the fact remains that the vast majority of works on Bohemia comes from Czech historical scholarship. The dialogue between Czech and Western European and North American historians over the past twenty-five years has helped Czech historical scholarship become better known in broader circles, but the dialogue has also been marked by some tension. In recent years, even as knowledge of Czech has grown among Western scholars, some Czech historical circles have criticized “tourist scholars” who seek to capitalize and make a name for themselves through the superficial appropriation of others’ national histories or comparative studies which are too general. Worse, they claim, is some foreign scholarship, even of a more serious type, that does not refer to or simply cites references to Czech scholarship without seriously engaging with it.35 Most Czech historians welcome foreign interest in Bohemian history and comparative studies, and believe that methodological and theoretical impulses in North American and Western European scholarship can bring new insights into Bohemian history. But there is a growing consensus among historians of Bohemia that serious and critical study can occur only through a more meaningful engagement with Czech historical scholarship. Western European and North American historians can begin to better understand the dramatic events and distinctive features of Bohemian in the late medieval and early modern period and more meaningfully engage Czech historical scholarship by, first, better appreciating that the scholarship on the Bohemian Crown Lands is as rich and extensive as for many other European nations. And it has its own perspective, coming out of its own national experience. The Czech national perspective is not and should not be the only perspective on Bohemian history. But since the Bohemian lands, like all East Central Europe societies were intimately connected with the histories of their neighboring societies, it is an important one. A recent symposium commemorating the fortieth anniversary of the Newberry Library D’Arcy McNickle Center for American Indian and Indigenous Studies (with the provocative title “Why you can’t teach U.S. History without American Indians) argued for the importance of the greater incorporation of Native American scholars and studies in the writing and interpretation of U.S. history. Likewise one can argue for a 35\n\nJiří Pešek’s review of Dmitrieva and Lambrecht, Krakau, Prag und Wien, as well as authors’ reply and Pešek’s counter-reply in Historica, Series Nova 9 (2002): 187–211.\n\n17\n\nintroduction\n\ngreater consideration of Czech scholarship (and the scholarship of other individual East Central European national historiographies) in our research of the Bohemian Crown Lands (and Central Europe), alongside the histories of the Holy Roman Empire, Habsburg monarchy, and comparative studies.\n\nHistorical Narratives and Periodization in Modern Czech Scholarship To be a Czech historian from the days of Palacký has not been simple or easy. Because of the specifics of the modern age of the Czech nation, history could not be only an academic discipline or interesting profession, but . . . could hurt Czech historians and lead to their silencing and persecution.36 Josef Hanzal\n\n∵ The Czech perspective on history, as that of other European nations, comes out of the central narratives and chronological frameworks arising out the national historical experience. Czech historical scholarship has faced a number of challenges in creating a coherent narrative, setting the chronological boundaries of medieval and early modern Bohemian history and, in turn, connecting its national history with the history of its European neighbors. Describing the beginning of modern scholarship on the Reformation in the neighboring German lands, a topic better known to Anglo-American scholars than Bohemian history, Thomas A. Brady, Jr. writes: “In the beginning was Waterloo . . . Within a generation of the Battle . . . (18 July 1815) . . . where armies of two Protestant Countries (Prussia and Britain) joined to crush the forces of France, thought in Protestant lands to represent both Revolution and Rome . . . Protestants were celebrating their sixteenth-century reformation as a dawn of a modern age.37 Modern Czech historical scholarship on late m ­ edieval and early modern Bohemian history also dates back to the early nineteenth 36\n\n37\n\nJosef Hanzal, “Proměny české historiografie, 1945–1989/I,” VII.

A Czech scholar comparable to Leopold von Ranke can be found in František Palacký (1798–1876), the father of the Czech nationalist school of history.38 In his History of the Czech Nation in Bohemia and Moravia (1848), published a year after von Ranke’s German History in the Age of the Reformation, Palacký explained that Bohemian history was distinctive and “more instructive and interesting than that of other nations,” owing to “Bohemia’s unique position in the center and heart of Europe which made it a focal point where over many years various elements and principles could meet and come together in various ways to create the fundamentals of a new European national, political, and religious life . . . Just as the Germans inherited the legacy of the Roman Empire, the Slavs, quiet and moderate, came forward and settled alongside the Germans, creating a society no less noble or moral.”39 Palacký pointed to a “long and personal struggle and mutual inpenetration [that took place in Bohemia] between the Roman, German, and Slavic cultures of Europe,” which made up “the content and fundamental driving force of Bohemian-Moravian history.”40 According to Palacký, during “the middle age [of Bohemian history which] began with the beginnings of Hussitism in 1403 . . . and ended in 1627 with the emigration and expulsion of the Utraquists from Bohemia . . . the nation reached the height of its historical significance . . . That which came before must be reckoned to the ‘old age,’ and that which followed to the ‘new age.’ ”41 Palacký asserted that the middle age was characterized by a religious struggle that twice “led to bloody and long wars: the first, the Hussite wars. . . . the second, the Thirty Years’ War”, which were the high and low points in a larger struggle in which the nation’s destiny was at stake.42 Palacký never got to fully describe this middle age (he did not have time to expand the book beyond 1526) but, in the introduction, he describes “[the] energetic times and chapters of this age [which include] . . . the outbreak of the Hussite Wars in 1419 and the reconciliation of the Utraquists through the Basel Compactata, the decay of royal power in the long kingless period and the unsuccessful attempt by George of Poděbrad to raise it up again, the squabbles between the estates the subjugation of common people under King Vladislav, the connection with the 38 39 40 41 42\n\nSee the definitive Czech biography by Jiří Kořalka, František Palacký {1879–1876).

Also noteworthy in Palacký’s narrative is the ascent of the Habsburgs to the Bohemian throne in 1526, presented not as a single turning point, but one of several milestones of the age. Palacký’s contemporaries also viewed the period as central to the nation’s destiny but had some different views of chronology and the religious situation. Václav Vladivoj Tomek (1818–1905), was one of Palacky’s assistants who, in 1851, became the first professor of Austrian history at the Charles University in Prague. He generally accepted Palacky’s chronology but put greater emphasis on subdivisions of the age, pointing specifically to the year 1547 when the Bohemian estates refused to support imperial Catholic forces in the Schmalkaldic War. The estates, especially the royal cities, were then punished for that by King Ferdinand I through a number of measures which Tomek describes as limiting the autonomy and self-governance of the cities, which had reached a height after the Hussite Revolution.43 In an early study published in 1848, Tomek, who came from a Catholic family, presented a liberal and sympathetic view of Utraquism and its role in Bohemia’s development. In discussing Utraquism’s relationship to the universal church, Tomek writes that “it wasn’t the intent of this party to break away from the Catholic church and form its own religious society . . . since the leaders. . . . held on to the mistaken hope that the Roman church would recognize the truth of their principles, and accept them and their teachings into the womb of the church. That mistaken hope is the key to understanding the whole history of Utraquism.” On the arrival of Lutheranism in Bohemia in the early sixteenth century, Tomek writes that “Bohemian Lutherans had from the beginning a different relationship to the church than the Lutherans in the German lands and elsewhere. Whereas in other places they formed new religious societies, separated from the Roman Church, in Bohemia they remained by the existing church society . . .”44 In this article, Tomek had some harsh comments about Ferdinand I, the first Habsburg King of Bohemia, writing that “with Ferdinand I came a Machiavellian, Italian and Spanish system of government to Bohemia and the 43 Tomek, Děje Pražské v krátkém nástinu (Prague: Jaroslva Pospísil, 1845), 40–48; Tomek, Dějepis města Prahy, vol. XII (Prague: František Řívnáč, 1901), 1–29. 44 Tomek, “O církewní spráwě strany pod obojí w Čechách, od r. 1415 až 1622,” ČČM XXII, prvního dílu svazek páty (1848), 442.\n\n20\n\nintroduction\n\nother lands under Austrian power, which in short time weakened the powers of all the peoples living in it.”45 In a later article from the mid 1850s, Tomek presented a very different perspective on religion and politics in Bohemia between the fifteenth and seventeenth centuries, reflecting his personal transformation after 1848 into a conservative with pro-Austrian and Catholic ­loyalties.46 The new perspective focused on forces that sought to bring order and unity, which he viewed as positive trends in Bohemian history. Tomek now viewed Hussitism, Utraquism, and the Bohemian reformation in general as negative trends, beginning a process that eventually led to anarchy among the estates in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries and ultimately their defeat at the Battle of White Mountain.47 Commenting on the restructuring of Bohemia society in 1627, Tomek wrote that “the great upheaval brought by Ferdinand II which introduced a new religious and societal order brought about a God-saving future despite their unpleasant environment.48 Anton Gindely (1829–1892), a contemporary of Tomek, developed a perspective on Bohemian history that reflected a different personal trajectory through the tumultuous events of the first half of the nineteenth century. Like Tomek, Gindely came from a Catholic family (his father was Hungarian). However, whereas Tomek was transformed during the events of 1848 into a conservative, Gindely became a liberal. At the same time, he remained an Austrian patriot, and sought to reconcile Bohemian and Austrian history of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with the ideals of German centralism and Hungarianslavonic federalism of his day.49 One area of Gindely’s interests focused on the Unity of the Brethren, which evolved out of a more radical wing of the Hussite movement, and included a two-volume History of the Bohemian Brethren (1857–58).50 Gindely saw the Brethren “as true representatives of Hussitism, who from the moment of their inception until the death of their last master, [Johannes Amos] Comenius, in exile—1450–1671—left a distinctive mark 45 46\n\n47 48 49\n\n50\n\nTomek, “O církewní spráwě,” 448.

In 1858, Gindely published a study of the important legislation issued by Rudolf II in 1609, initiated by both domestic and dynastic problems which granted religious toleration in Bohemia for the first time.52 In Rudolf II and his Age (1862 and 1865), Gindely viewed the conflict of the Bohemian estates with Rudolf II in a larger European context of the development of the international Protestant coalition.53 Years later he returned to the rising conflict between the king and estates in a four-volume History of the Bohemian Uprising in the Year 1618.54 Gindely made a point of noting that “the opening act of the tragedy [the defenestration of 1618] was performed in Prague.”55 He believed that “the cause . . . is to be sought chiefly in the incompatibility of religious views which prevailed among the peoples of the time . . . But disagreement in religious convictions was not the sole cause of the war. The subordination of the estates in Austria, the avidity of the princes to enrich themselves at the cost of church property, the ambition of individual party leaders, who could be satisfied only in a general disorder, contributed so largely to the kindling of the conflagration . . .”56 At the end of the nineteenth century, Czech historians began to raise some fundamental questions about the national conceptual framework and chronology of Bohemian history, and the role of religion in societal and political developments. Jaroslav Goll (1846–1929), professor at the Charles University in Prague, virtually unknown outside of Czech circles but a person with whom many contemporary Czech historians still identify, lectured to a new generation of students on the long-term connections throughout history between the Bohemian lands and the societies of western Europe. He challenged the notion that Bohemia followed a unique, isolated path of historical development.57 Josef Pekař (1810–1937), one of Goll’s students who became a professor and then rector of the Charles University, set out to systematically and ­empirically 51 Gindely, “Vorwort,” Geschichte der Böhmischen Brüder I, pages not numbered. 52 Gindely, Geschichte der Erteilung des böhmischen Majestätsbriefes (Prague: Tempský, 1858). 53 Gindely, Rudolf II und seine Zeit 1600–1612, 2 vols.

According to Pekař, “Czech history is a part, expression, or variation of European life.”59 Pekař viewed the Hussite movement like Palacký, as a high point, “the most important part of our contribution to European culture,” but not because “it was something that was independent from Europe and which arose independently from the Czech spirit and land or was a carrier of democracy, but because it represented a Czech adaptation of larger European developments.”60 Although Catholic, Pekař thought that religion was something of the past. His real interest was the Czech state, and he looked unfavorably on any trends in history which he believed weakened it. For this reason, he hated breaking up Bohemia’s alliance with Catholicism.61 Josef Pekař got involved in a public debate with Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk (1850–1937), the first President of Czechoslovakia and a philosopher of history, about the meaning of Czech history. Masaryk, a proponent of Palacký’s views, saw the early twentieth century, as a continuation of the Czech nationalist revival movement of the late nineteenth century which the national political struggle of Palacký’s generation in the early nineteenth century had ushered forth and, in turn, as a continuation of the struggle begun by Hus and violently broken at White Mountain.62 Pekař considered these views mystical and teological and a threat to the empirical approach to history which he considered so important. Pekař pointed out that historical developments change the course and goals of an age, so that the Bohemia of the fourteenth and fifteenth century had a different mentality than the Bohemia of the sixteenth, seventeenth, or ninteenth or twentieth centuries.63 Pekař proposed a new periodization of Czech history “founded on the spiritual epochs of general European development through which it was influenced and determined in many ways.”64 Pekař’s periodization distinguished between “the First Middle Ages (or Romanesque Age)” which ran to 1200, “the Second Middle Age” which 58\n\n59 60 61 62 63 64\n\nFor more about Pekař, see Jaroslav Werstadt, “Rozhled po Filosofii českých dějin,” Spor o smysl českých dějin, ed.

It was important for Pekař that “the Czech Middle Ages ends where the Middle Ages of all the nations . . . end.”65 Kamil Krofta (1876–1945), recognized as one of the greatest interpreters of the Goll school, shared Pekař’s dislike of the romanticism of the Palacký school and the need to look at Bohemian developments alongside those in western Europe. However, in contrast to Pekař for whom religion was something of the past, Krofta possessed a lively interest in religion and sought to reexamine the relationship of national and religious issues in a much more differentiated way than had previous scholars.66 Krofta thought that Palacký’s views of Protestantism affected his ideas of history, but he disagreed with Tomek, Gindely and others that the Bohemian Reformation broke up into sects in the sixteenth century.67 Krofta underscored that the Compacts of Basel and the Peace of Kutná Hora never became the basis for a permanent peace with the church or with groups at home, but they did frame historical developments throughout the fifteenth, sixteenth, and early seventeenth centuries. Krofta notes that while “Utraquists did not want to break with Rome. . . . they were reality entirely independent from Rome, they were a national church, although with regards to administration they were not different than the general church.” He admitted “the Utraquists suffered insufficiencies, arising from the Hussite wars and the lack of a constitution.”68 He saw evidence of invigoration in the formulation of a Bohemian Confession in 1575.69 Krofta also sought to reassess the place of the Battle of White Mountain, which Pekař downplayed in his new conceptualization of Czech history. Krofta saw this battle as “the most important marker in the modern history of the nation, though an unfavorable one.” Krofta wrote that “when we speak about White Mountain, we are not just thinking about the battle itself but the entire upheaval. . . . which cannot be blamed only on the unhappy outcome of the battle but on other, deeper causes.” Moreover, “the correct way to understand the ‘pre-White Mountain’ period is in connection with western European developments. . . . because during this period the Bohemian nation was tightly connected with the destinies of other European states and nations as never before.” Krofta then stated that “it is not possible to understand the meaning 65 66\n\nPekař, “O periodisací českých dějin,” 414.

Some scholars have argued that competing multiple national consciousness and estate structures left a deeper, more longlasting mark in the Bohemian lands and other east central European societies, and the fact that the Czechs have not had a long experience as an independent state could explain the longevity and strength of these views.71 However, similar cases can be found in the historical narratives of European societies outside of central and eastern Europe. Whether or not the Bohemian lands are distinctive or stronger in this regard, the fact remains that the nation has remained a major focus of the historical narrative of late medieval and early modern Bohemia in modern Czech scholarship.\n\nWhite Spots and Black Holes in Czech Historiography, 1945–198"
