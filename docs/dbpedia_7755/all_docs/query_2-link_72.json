The project pursued the objective of compiling an exceptional inventory of defunct burgher wood-and-clay buildings from the area of medieval Brno obtained over the past thirty years as part of hundreds of rescue archaeological excavations in an effort to better understand the character of building development at the time. While the topic of the genesis and transformation of the medieval town was periodically discussed between 2002 and 2019 at Forum urbes medii aevi conferences, the most recent synthesising FUMA II and III proceedings focused on the earliest burgher houses are now more than 15 years old (Merta, Peška eds. 2005). The many new findings that have been collected during that period of time promise a deeper understanding of the beginnings of burgher development in the Czech lands. In terms of geography, we concentrated on the territory of historical Moravia and the neighbouring parts of Upper Silesia, not with the aim of an exhaustive processing of the given subject in this territory but rather to present the most important research or synthesising views of the development of the oldest houses in various towns in the form of studies by a range of authors. To a certain extent, a representative research probe has been created for Moravia that includes the most important information we have today on former wood-and-clay buildings. We have also attempted to capture the remarkably diverse and unrestrained character of early urban development as well as its gradual stabilisation. And while hotly discussed\n\nquestions concerning typology, the placement of buildings on plots, the existence of above-ground parts and the transition to masonry construction mostly remain unresolved, they have often been significantly expanded. Although the inclusion of a paper on the geological conditions around the selected towns may seem somewhat misplaced, it was our intention to point out the natural environment that largely determined the use of building materials, especially in the period after the founding of the town. Many shorter chapters are devoted to a micromorphological analysis of floor sandwiches with the aim of understanding the formation processes of floors and offering interpretations of the residential or storage function of analysed spaces. Since the study of the phenomenon of the medieval burgher house is one path towards searching for a common Central European past, we invited scholars from Prague and the Silesian city of Wrocław to join our team of authors. Both of these erstwhile major royal towns are crucial to our understanding of the transformation processes in 13th-century secular architecture in Central Europe. As such, they are also an appropriate comparison revealing that much of contemporary Moravia is a mere periphery of the Western world. To make the collected information available to foreign scholars, the entire publication has been translated into English. Our original goal has broadened considerably since 2017 and we are therefore delighted that the book was published with support from the Institute of Archaeology of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Brno. Finally, great thanks go to Martin Ollé, who carried a substantial amount of the load on his own shoulders. Marek Peška 9\n\nChapter 1\n\nMicromorphology in the archaeological context – A tool for understanding the formation history of the floor horizons of a medieval city\n\nLenka Lisá\n\n1. Introduction This introductory micromorphological chapter begins by explaining what exactly is meant by the method of ‘micromorphology applied in the archaeological context of a medieval city’. The results from individual cities are then discussed in separate chapters of this book and focus on the floor sandwiches of recessed and above-ground buildings in the area of medieval Brno, Prague, Opava and several examples from medieval rural contexts. The book also contains a chapter dedicated to the geo-ethnoarchaeological study of the creation and modification of floors. So, why floors? This phenomenon is often neglected along with its informative value required to interpret the practices related to the daily life of medieval society. In this chapter, the reader will be able to comprehend how sampling takes place, what must be ignored when deciding on the method and place of sampling, what information micromorphology in the archaeological context can provide, and, information about what sampling strategies were used in researching floor sediments in the area of medieval Brno.\n\nis the limited view from one angle, so it is not a 3D view, which must be taken into account when conceiving what the sediment looks like ‘inside’. Such a ‘film’ is technically called a thin section. Although the preparation is not complicated, a precise production protocol must be maintained. However, the work of a micromorphologist begins long before the cut can be observed under the microscope. A micromorphologist is usually a geoarchaeologist, geologist, pedologist or archaeologist who is fully knowledgeable of the archaeological context, the parameters of the geological subsoil and has a good idea of the formation processes at the site. Sampling from specific contexts must respect pre-determined questions as with any analytical method it is necessary to proceed from the so-called macro to the micro, and it is not possible to create a basic framework for the formation processes at the site based on the study of cuts. Micromorphology in the archaeological context is therefore this method applied directly to sediments or soils that are related to the interpretation of the archaeological site (Karkanas, Goldberg 2019; Goldberg, Macphail 2006; Macphail, Goldberg 2018).\n\n2. What is the method of micromorphology in the archaeological context?\n\n3. Collection and preparation of micromorphological samples – some practical advice\n\nMicromorphology is the method used to study various types of sediments and soils at more detailed magnifications. Imagine that you can ‘pull’ a thin film from the sediment or the soil, which can then be studied under a microscope. This is exactly what the micromorphology method allows. The disadvantage\n\nHow is a micromorphological sample taken? In principle, it involves removing an intact block of sediment from the archaeological context, which can be transported to a laboratory where it will then be dried and impregnated in a vacuum with resin. As a result of the impregnation in the vacuum, the pores 11\n\nChapter 1 | Micromorphology in the archaeological context – A tool for understanding the formation histor y of the floor horizons of a medieval city\n\ncontained in the sediment will be filled with resin and their exact shape will thus be maintained. It will also be possible to retain the softer parts of the sample such as the organic matter in the resulting cut due to the impregnation. Sampling methods vary depending on the type of material collected. The most suitable material for sampling is usually sorted dusty or clayey sediments (e.g. loess or fine-grained fluvial sediments). From these sediments, it is usually possible to ‘cut out’ a cube (Fig. 1) of the sediment without the need for any supporting sampling structure (box). In the case of sandy and gravelly sediments or sedimentary sets with changing grain sizes, it is necessary to use the so-called Kubiena box (Fig. 1). This is a sampling box named after the founder of soil micromorphology and can be made of thin sheet metal or paper, or, for example, a milk carton. If the exact shape cannot be removed, as this is prevented, for example, by the number of coarse clusters, ceramics or bones, it is necessary to remove a larger amount of material by fixing it in gypsum or gypsum dressings. A stronger bed must be created where the sample remains intact during the sampling. After each sampling, the individual samples must be wrapped tightly in clink foil so that they do not disintegrate or dry out quickly. Orientation and context must be indicated on the samples. If it is not possible to transport the samples to the laboratory, it is advisable to store them in a dry, cool place. Samples must not be mouldy or frozen.\n\nThose samples that are transported to the laboratory will be unwrapped from the protective foils, dried for several days at a temperature of approximately 30°C and impregnated with resin in the vacu­u m (a desiccator or a vacuum chamber). It must be the same type of resin that will then be used to make the cuts. Therefore, if sending samples to a commercial laboratory, it is advisable to send them unpacked. The specialist in the production of cuts then cuts a flat surface of the sample from the impregnated block, which usually hardens for several weeks, and then glues it under pressure to the matted slide. After hardening, the specimen is placed in a machine where most of the sample is gradually removed with diamond wheels. The goal is that only a thin layer of the sample (the previously mentioned film) remains on the slide, which can be illuminated when studied under a polarizing or binocular microscope. A thickness of 30 μm is ideal for minerals in order to recognise and correctly identify their optical properties.\n\n4. What information can micromorphology provide in an archaeological context? The micromorphology method provides a detailed insight into the sediment structure. This means that it provides information on the type of pores, their relationship to the coarse-grained and\n\nFig. 1. The way how to sample the micromorphological blocks from the section. Photo by P. Lisý.\n\n12\n\nChapter 1 | Micromorphology in the archaeological context – A tool for understanding the formation histor y of the floor horizons of a medieval city\n\nfine-grained components of the sediment, the type and preservation of organic and organomineral components of the sediment and, information on pedofeatures. It is a source of information about both the primary and especially the post-sedimentary processes that played a role in the formation of the current sedimentary record. It is possible to get an idea of the homogeneity of the material, its source, anthropogenic intrusions and the associated primary formation history. Pedofeatures are then another guide to interpreting the processes that took place in the sediment in the past, either during sedimentation, just after it or at a time when the context was abandoned and possibly influenced by processes entirely unrelated to the original context. A number of manuals and specialised publications have been published on the topic of micromorphology (e.g. Stoops 2003; Goldberg, Macphail 2006; Stoops et al. 2010; Macphail, Goldberg 2018; Karkanas, Goldberg 2019). However, there are many more publications on this topic and especially dedicated to the individual aspects of micromorphology and micromorphology in the archaeological context.\n\n5. What is a floor? The floor is an integral part of every house. In the archaeological record, the floor is an integral part of the stratigraphy of the house and in some cases, it may be the only remnant delimiting its living space (Karkanas, Goldberg 2019). Clay and clay floors detected in prehistoric or medieval contexts were usually made of homogeneous materials of local origin (Macphail, Goldberg 2018), whether untreated or slightly modified, by, for example, adding organic matter or manure (Karkanas 2006; Boivin 2000). Examples include the study of Viking houses in Iceland using volcanic ash (Milek 2012) and prehistoric and medieval buildings in the United Kingdom using diatomaceous earth and tills (Macphail 1990). To date, the Neolithic floors from the Turkish Çatalhöyük have been the subject of the most attention (Boivin 2000; Matthews 2010; Lisá et al. 2020b). In the loess areas of Central Europe, loess was the most suitable type of construction material (Lisá, Lisý 2019; Lisá et al. 2020a). Application of loess material has been documented from the United Kingdom (London, Guildhall site) for the purpose of the cleaning function (Goldberg, Macphail 2006). Similar structures have been documented on our territory, for example, in the Hallstatt earthworks in Modřice near Brno (Jarošová et al. 2010) and\n\nmedieval residential buildings (Lisá et al. 2020b). In some cases, these ‘sanitary’ layers are covered with a thin layer of humus-rich material indicating a walkable layer (Macphail, Goldberg 2018). The previously mentioned types of sediments are deposited in a walking area with an obvious purpose and are referred to in the literature as constructed floors (Macphail, Goldberg 2018; Karkanas, Goldberg 2019). They often have a sandwich structure where these ‘sanitary/preparatory’ layers alternate with dark-coloured layers rich in carbon and decomposed organic matter. Such layers were then formed by tread or waste disposal and were not applied for any particular purpose. Therefore, it is not a ‘constructed’ part of the floor in the true sense of the word (Macphail et al. 2004). In the English literature, they are referred to as ‘beaten floors’ (Macphail et al. 2004). Courty et al. (1989) and Gé et al. (1993) introduced a micromorphological concept by which floor horizons can be described. They distinguish a total of two, more precisely three, zones that usually merge into each other. The base of the floor consists of the so-called passive layer, which can be a geological subsoil unaffected by humans, an older cultural layer, a structural part of the floor or material laid on the floor (wooden floor). Above the passive layer is the so-called reaction layer, which essentially only deforms the passive zone. The uppermost part is the so-called active zone, formed by the tread itself (Macphail, Goldberg 2018). Therefore, how does archaeological research distinguish whether it is a structural floor, i.e., a passive or reaction zone, and to what extent is it a tread layer that was not intentionally created? The answers to these questions can be found in case studies that document vanishing approaches to modifying walking horizons, especially using the method of micromorphology in the archaeological context (Goldberg, Macphail 2006; Stoops 2003; Stoops et al. 2010; Macphail, Goldberg 2018; Nicosia, Stoops 2017; Karkanas, Goldberg 2019). Contemporary open-air museums with expositions of folk architecture featuring a village house usually use a clay floor, i.e., a dusty clay material spread over a walking area. The methods of formation do not usually have a specific procedure as it is the application of clay mixed with water. A type of manual was created for the Rožnov open-air museum, composed of recordings of local inhabitants, which were taken in the first half of the 20th century. In contrast, notes from local chronicles were used to create a reproduction of the floor of a country house 13\n\nChapter 1 | Micromorphology in the archaeological context – A tool for understanding the formation histor y of the floor horizons of a medieval city\n\nfrom the second half of the 19th century (Novotný 2014). Unfortunately, the ethnographic sources for this part of folk architecture are negligible. Most of the work only addresses the building elements, which do not include floors.\n\n6. Notes on the strategy of taking micromorphological samples from the floor contexts of a medieval city The method of micromorphology of floor horizons has to date been statistically best developed in the territory of medieval Brno. In addition to the results of this study (Holub et al. 2021; see Chapter 8) concerning the type of floor composition and the formation processes in the context of recessed or above-ground structures, it was possible to assess various strategies of micromorphological samples. A long-term goal of geo-archaeological cooperation is to evaluate the extent of the information potential of micromorphology depending on the sampling strategy. The methodological approach to the study of floor horizons has temporal and spatial pitfalls. Given that the presented samples were taken over approximately ten years and that it is still a relatively new methodology, we tried to reach a consensus about the contexts in which to take samples and to what extent to obtain sufficient information\n\n14\n\nfor an acceptable price and energy invested in the consumption and processing. However, how to take floor sandwiches is not only related to the financial demands but, above all, to the interpretative possibilities of the archaeological context. The most suitable situation for consumption concerning the following interpretation is a large-scale research in which the spatial relationship to the location is obvious both to the plot location and to the links to other buildings and the use of open space. The ideal situation is when the type of building and the spatial relationship to the surrounding area can be interpreted based on archaeological clues. The micromorphological analysis then clarifies the information about the use in a specific context. Sampling is more difficult for basements because they are usually formed by a repeated set of microlayers interspersed with sanitary layers. To understand the situation, it is necessary to sample a larger number of samples vertically. In the case of the above-ground floor sandwiches, which are not very thick, the problem is the opposite. The thickness of the floor sandwich is relatively small but spatially variable. In this case, if the situation allows, it is advisable to take a larger number of samples in the vertical plane. Regardless, it is necessary to take larger samples of at least 4 × 7 cm.\n\nChapter 2\n\nOn the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nTomasz Cymbalak – Michael Rykl\n\n1. Introduction Prague is the historical capital of Bohemia through which the River Vltava flows. It was the seat of the ruling dynasties residing at Prague Castle and at end of the 11th century also at Vyšehrad, situated on the opposite river bank than Prague Castle. Recessed houses excavated within its territory not only count among the oldest ones discovered in the present-day Czech Republic, but their variability belongs to the most elaborate in the whole country (Klápště 2012; 2016). Archaeological research in the historical core of Prague has over a century-long tradition. At the outset, the researchers focused on the earliest chapters of Bohemian statehood and, within the narrower theme of the history of the Prague agglomeration, on the most important sites and areas within the later metropolis (Kuna et al. 2019). In contrast, the interest in early secular architecture and the wide range of settlement activities that accompany it from the proto-urban or early urban milieu can be registered in Bohemia from the late 1950s (Kavan 1956, 378, 383; Richter 1963, 206; Hrdlička 1972; Klápště, Muk 1988, 199). A more systematic examination of these issues within the broader settlement or the chronological context of medieval Prague has only been conducted at a few sites (Republiky Square; Karmelitská Street; COPA/QUADRIO; Národní–Mikulandská streets / DRN). All these projects were excavations carried out over the past two decades. The individual fieldwork took the form of large-scale excavations related to investor projects. They all concerned unique sites whose position within the spatial arrangement of the medieval agglomeration promised significant findings. From the earlier excavations that represent\n\na cornerstone for the issue presented in this text, we must not omit the work by Ladislav Hrdlička and the results of his excavation in Klárov (Hrdlička 1972) and in U Sladkých House in Husova Street, Prague Old Town (Hrdlička 1980; 1983, 625, Fig. 6). The most noticeable evidence of the beginnings of permanent occupation on both banks of the River Vltava has the form of large rectangular features recessed into the surrounding terrain that are interpreted as remnants of structures built without the use of stone. Their number rose considerably with a surge of excavations in the centres of Bohemian towns in the 1970s and 1980s, and the earlier designation ‘residential cottages’ was replaced by the term ‘pit houses’. The following decade, with a rush of renovation of the historical town cores in Central Europe after 1989, brought new finds and new interpretations of these features, which were ascribed to the function of cellars within larger above-ground structures (Donat 1993; see Vařeka 2002, 252). The earliest structures in the core of the early medieval Prague agglomeration are represented by slightly recessed log features with an area of less than 20 m 2. Their occurrence has been documented in the part of the continuously settled suburbium of Hradčany in the territory of present-day Lesser Town, and they can be dated to the 10th century. A brand new type of dwelling is registered in this area around the beginning of the 12th century – larger non-masonry features whose above-ground structure was mostly based on wooden load-bearing posts. Their outer walls, recessed or semi-recessed into the surrounding terrain and geological subsoil, were made of wooden boarding or secured by a stone lining 15\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nFig. 2.

Theme: authors. Graphics by S. Babušková.\n\n16\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\n(Čiháková 1999, 19; most recently Piekalski 2014, 136–140). For the later period, their presence has been documented by archaeological excavations throughout the extramural settlement of Prague Castle (Fig. 2).1 Basic information concerning the localisation of early to high medieval non-masonry structures and their remnants have been drawn from an overview of archaeological fieldwork carried out in the historical core of Prague that is published biannually in the Prague Historical Review (Pražský sborník historický). Even after the arrival of ‘so-called’ small-ashlar houses built of marlstone (late 12th and early 13th centuries), these buildings continued to co-form the character of the densely settled area on both banks of the Vltava, including the high-prestige areas of the settlements, such as the main roads and marketplaces (e.g. Bureš et al. 1997; 1998; Boháčová, Podliska eds. 2018; Cymbalak, Rykl 2018 including references).2 The definition of a ‘recessed’ or ‘semi-recessed’ house is purely technical, based on exact findings yielded by archaeological excavations in medieval towns. These building remnants are most often revealed within the fieldwork. The result is that in professional practice, the terms sunken and semisunken structure are almost automatically assigned to non-masonry houses from the medieval period. Despite this, buildings with basements or cellars are also registered from later periods. When determining whether a structure is completely or only partially recessed, the decisive factor is the level of the lowering of its lowermost storey compared to the surrounding terrain at the time of the origin of the building – hundreds of years ago. 1\n\nThe results of bibliographic research accompanied by information from available literature and the conclusions of archaeological reports on rescue excavations imply the following ratios of the finds of recessed structures in the individual cadastral areas of Prague: Old Town 39%, New Town 36%, Lesser Town 19%; Prague Castle and Hradčany 3.5%, Vyše­ hrad and sites outside the Prague Conservation Area 2.5%.\n\n2 Although information about the age of recessed and semi­ recessed features and the related buildings is incomplete, reflecting the current state of the processing of the fieldwork projects, a certain trend can be observed indicating the dominant position of a group of basements dated to the 12th and 13th centuries (52%). Of the total number of 226 features recorded to date, as many as 20.5% have not been assigned to a particular period, and 7% of these structures were dated broadly to the High Middle Ages. A more detailed analysis shows that 4% were dated to the mid-10th century, 9% to the 11th century, 8% to the 12th century, 16% to the period between the mid-12th and the mid-13th centuries, 29% to the 13th century, 6% to the 14th century and 0.5% to the 15th century.\n\nGiven the occurrence of these old structures for which we can presume the existence of a complete or partial lowering within the building’s layout, we should also extend the definition of recessed and semi-recessed structures from the vertical to the horizontal level. An illustrative example of the outlined situation is provided by features examined in the late 20th century in the core of the Old Town and the northeastern part of the New Town. In the depth of the plots of the Old Town House U Sixtů (553–555 Celetná Street), square features recessed into the original terrain with an area of 30–40 m 2 were revealed that were interpreted by the authors of the research as cellars of larger houses, granaries or craft workshops dated to the late 12th or early 13th centuries (Bureš et al. 1997, 205). An illustrative example of the use of the construction pit for the needs of a basement of an above-ground house was documented almost 20 years ago in the eastern part of the former George of Poděbrady Barracks in Republiky Square (Juřina et al. 2009, 49–51). However, a more complex assessment of recessed or semi-recessed houses from the territory of the historical core of Prague has not been carried out yet. This text does not set itself such an ambitious task either. The objective is to outline the most distinctive directions discovered within archaeological research that should be paid further attention. This is why we focus on a selected section of the rightbank part of the city centre3 where, it appears, the most distinct examples of the evolution of burgher houses in Prague can be illustratively shown. This approach was chosen due to the rather large territorial expanse of the medieval agglomeration that would have to be taken into account in a complex and time-demanding analysis and also due to the quantity and institutional fragmentariness of the information from archaeological fieldwork activity.\n\n2. Settlement activities with the focus on the left-bank part of Prague Early medieval settlement activities on the right bank of the Vltava and the related first evidence of its permanent use need to be linked to the development of the core of the pre-urban agglomeration after the second half of the 10th century (Ječný et al. 1984; Čihá­ko­v á 1999, 20; Čiháková et al. 2000; 3 To provide a full image of the form and changes of the earliest secular medieval architecture in Prague, naturally, the most important findings from the left-bank part of the city will also be taken into account.\n\n17\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nDragoun et al. 2002, 349–351; Hrdlička 2000a, 198; 2000b, 50; Klápště 2005a, 340–354). The later growth of this part of Prague (early/mid-11th – mid-12th centuries) reflects the occupation boom along the road connecting newly founded Vyšehrad with Prague Castle (Cymbalak, Podliska 2008, 309–310 including references) or in the area of the most easterly situated settlement of Na Poříčí, which prospered due to its advantageous position near an ancient east-west route leading from the centre of the earliest part of the later Old Town up to Bubenský Ford (Kašpar 2018b, 208, 211). The western part of the centre of the Prague Basin with the Lesser Town extramural settlement and the agglomeration of medieval settlements around it is of an earlier origin (Čiháková 1999, 15–18). This relatively small and morphologically varied area compared to the Old or the New Town (Čiháková 1999, 11–12) saw other, more intricate settlement processes, of which no traces are known on the opposite bank of the Vltava: a complex evolution of the fortification system, a communication network bound to the close proximity to the ruler’s residence and a point where the river could be crossed. No 12th–13th-century medieval building built of flammable materials has survived there to this day. Features or parts using other than stone structures are known from only a few places in the historical core of the city, although these were dwellings from the High Middle Ages.4 The pre-urban houses of the inhabitants of early medieval Prague were mostly represented by wooden structures.5 A separate chapter in the architectural development of the town’s secular buildings is represented by residential houses made of stone, the small-ashlar houses, which started to appear in the second half of the 12th century in the southern part of the settlement below Prague Castle on the left bank of the river (most recently Havrda, Tryml 2013, 69–70, 326–327 including references) and in the area of the later Old Town (Dragoun et al. 2002) and New Town (Juřina et al. 2009, 42–51; Dragoun 2018). More than 80 of these buildings in the Romanesque style are\n\nknown today. These represent a virtually independent category in the history of Prague, Bohemian and even Central European architecture and archaeology (Dragoun et al. 2002). Later structures, or rather their preserved remnants, which belong to the subsequent stylistic category, are more numerous and represent the core of many buildings that exist to this day. This Gothic, or rather foundation wave, can be linked to the time of the establishment of early Prague towns in the 13th and 14th centuries (Cymbalak et al. 2011, 40; Hauserová 2003; 2011; Rykl et al. 2003; Rykl 2004). Bibliographic research of the available professional literature and selected archaeological reports from excavations carried out in the historical centre of Prague has yielded, for the first time within the study of local medieval secular architecture, information about 226 non-masonry residential buildings. Although we are aware that this figure says nothing about the precise number of houses situated on the left and right banks of the Vltava, we can state that the mentioned buildings represent the most convincing evidence of permanent occupation within the early medieval Prague conurbation. In each of the documented cases, archaeological contexts revealed by the excavations indicate that all these structures vanished during the transformation of the local settlement units into a residential town. Even so, the traces of these structures make it possible to study crucial moments in the development and the most important attributes of urban non-masonry secular buildings in the centre of the Prague Basin.\n\n3. The phenomenon of ‘recessed’ houses\n\n4\n\nAn example of these buildings is a fragment of a feature examined by Matouš Semerád and Pavel Taibl in the currently reconstructed house at 887 Nekázanka Street, New Town. We thank the authors of the research for information about the structure, which was built using trampled soil. A similar, albeit earlier structure of the same age, was documented at 135 Mikulandská Street, see below, and at 131 Ostrovní Street (Cymbalak, Semerád 2013).\n\nThe ‘phenomenon’ of recessed buildings can be encountered in the period preceding the ‘age of small-ashlar houses’ as well as in the time when these buildings were at the height of popularity. The low time and acquisition demands of recessed and semi-recessed buildings made of flammable materials were undoubtedly the decisive factors behind their popularity, which even continued during the Gothic period.6 The study of the evolution of townhouses in the early phase of their history is complicated for many reasons: similar processes took place in various places with various time shifts; earlier structures\n\n5\n\nEven so, structures in which stone pre-foundations or foundation walls have been recognised occurred in the Lesser Town as early as the 10th century (Čiháková 1999, 19).\n\n6 The same is true of above-ground structures built of wood that lacked recessed parts.\n\n18\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nwere often replaced by later buildings without leaving any traces of their existence. The addition of cellars to earlier buildings or the different density of buildings in built-up areas, formed over centuries and gradually replacing earlier structures, were also considerably important factors in this context. Only\n\nexceptionally does a single plot provide the opportunity to observe the evidence of an almost complex transformation of early urban buildings. A model example of such a metamorphosis similar to that of Most (Klápště 2002, 184) has been studied most recently in Mikulandská and Spálená streets, New\n\nFig. 3.

In the area of the plots situated near the intersection of Národní and Mikulandská streets, this process is manifested by the earliest settlement horizon (late 11th and early 12th centuries) with the occurrence of fragments of pottery vessels with advanced/later forms of chalice-shaped rims accompanied by representatives of archaic swollen rims and numerous various shaped features (stake, post and bar holes, small trenches). Large structures, most probably residential, are characteristic of the later development phase of early medieval occupation (Fig. 3). Their preserved remnants have the form of 1–1.2 m deep square or rectangular pits. Post holes discovered in the corners and along the circumference of the individual features indicate that they were recessed or semi-recessed structures built with the use of wood. The features were recessed into earlier anthropogenic contexts and the surface of the Vltava terrace; their area was 20–42 m 2. The post-built structure bore the roof of the building and, at the same time, formed the framework for the outer walls. The remnants of wooden planks or boards were discovered on the bottom of the features in two cases; these can be interpreted as floors, collapsed ceilings or wall fills. No stone foundation frame walls or other stone structures were discovered for any of the features examined within the framework of this phase 20\n\nof the occupation at the site. Similar archaeological contexts have also been documented in recent years in the immediate vicinity.7 Dating material gathered from their destruction phases is represented by numerous pottery assemblages with archaically and classically swollen accompanied by a smaller number of fragments with large upward-pulled rims (mid-12th to mid-13th centuries) and denarius coinage (Fig. 4). In accordance with the results of the most recent historical bibliographic research (Musílek 2015, 3–6 including references), the remnants of the original dwellings can be interpreted as the northern part of the early medieval settlement of Opatovice (Wallisová 1998), whose core was formed by the more southerly situated Romanesque Church of St Michael (Baťková ed. et al. 1998, 125).\n\n4. The founding of the Old Town of Prague and its reflection in the form of secular houses The constitution of the Old Town and the construction of its fortification system with elements preserved to this day represent an important turning point in the medieval development of the studied territory. This deed considerably changed the form of local early medieval occupation and established 7 160/II Opatovická Street (Cymbalak 2013, 17–18), 164/II Křemencová Street (Vyšohlíd 2017; Vyšohlíd, Zavřel 2019, 71–72), 192/II and 193/II Pštrossova Street (Wallisová, Tryml 1995), 1924/II Pštrossova Street (Podliska 1994), 203/II Pštrossova Street (Cymbalak 2007a; 2007b; 2008), Ostrovní Street, plot No. 838/2 and 134/II Mikulandská Street (the results from the last two streets have still not been unpublished; I thank Radek Široký for the information).\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nFig. 5.

Finally, it set the basic urbanistic framework for the historical core of right-bank Prague with its final phase in the form of the foundation of the New Town. The construction of the fortification during the reign of Wenceslas I gave the inhabitants of the Old Town a sense of security; on the other hand, it delimited its spatial development and represented a radical intervention in the life of earlier settlements. In the area of present­ day Národní Street, part of the built-up area, along with local activities, was transferred further to the south (Cymbalak, Staňková 2014, 162). Analogous phenomena were also recorded in other places along the route of the newly built walls. At least four Romanesque structures of a residential character, including a palace from the second half or the end of the 12th century, ceased to exist in the eastern part of the Old Town, close to St Benedict Gate (the area of present-day Republiky Square; Juřina 2009, 66–71; Juřina et al. 2009, 44–48; Omelka 2009, 442). A radical intervention in the form of the settlement structure on the right bank of the agglomeration is\n\nreflected in the emergence of dozens of pyrotechnological features that were detected in the course of the excavation, especially in the places of vanished or controllably removed semi-recessed buildings. For the period between the second half of the 13th and the first half of the 14th centuries, a rise (ca 0.3–0.4 m) was documented in the historical overburden and the occurrence of several subsurface (0.2–0.5 m) features in a square or rectangular shape interpreted as mutually arranged lower parts of above-ground residential (?) buildings that respected a nearby road.8 The occurrence of the 8\n\nSome were accompanied by a stone foundation wall (ca 0.3–0.4 m wide, ca 0.15 m high) built of pieces of quarry marlstone bound by clay. The accompanying negative imprints of bar holes detected in two parallel lines (one in the interior and one in the exterior part of the structure) indicate that it might have been a building with a wattle or rather a compacted soil wall structure. Regrettably, the greater part of the building was damaged by later interventions, and it is very difficult to ascertain its area. The minimum depth of the feature was 0.35 m. An earlier feature with a minimum area of ca 7.3 m² situated in the close vicinity of the structure described above was slightly recessed (0.3 m) into a settlement layer of a similar age; its western edge was lined with bar\n\n21\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\naforementioned remnants of above-ground structures detected near the west frontage of present-day Mikulandská Street represents evidence of the repeated permanent occurrence of residential buildings. The mutual arrangement and concentration of these structures along the road may prove a crystallisation phase of the organisation of spatial relations in the area south of the Old Town walls. The gradual stratigraphic development of historical overburden in the period under study is confirmed by frequent finds of fragments of red painted pottery and later coinage,9 which occurred in the fills and the immediate vicinity of the individual structures. The hectic transformations registered in the examined area evidence the rising potential of the territory in front of the town wall10 and can be considered a harbinger of the approaching foundation of Prague New Town in the reign of Charles IV (Fig. 5).\n\n5. The foundation and secular houses of Prague New Town The transformation of the area summarised above culminated in the foundation of a new urban unit by Charles IV in 1348 (Lorenc 1973; Kašpar 2018a). The most distinctive element of the early urban architectural phase at the site had the form of an almost rectangular corner. It was comprised of the foundation wall of a square or rectangular building, which was most probably dry-built from wood and stone. Marlstone, quartzite, pebbles, slate, fragments of bricks and lumps of mortar were found in the excavated foundation part of the house as a secondarily used building material. In terms of position, the structure documented in the passageway holes situated in the interior part of the structure. The smallest section of the recessed space was recorded once again in the southern neighbourhood of the previous feature; besides an almost identical level of depth (ca 0.25 m), it was characterised by an uninterpretable fragment of masonry built of quartzite, quarry marlstone and brick fragments bound by mortar. Rare evidence of everyday life and the equipment of the homes or workshops of the local inhabitants (a fragment of an aquamanile, small figural sculptures of horses, moulds) was gathered from the fills of the mentioned structures. 9\n\nInv.

The absence of mortar as a binder, both within the foundation wall structure and in the form of crusts or casts in its immediate vicinity, indicates that no masonry techniques were applied during the construction of the house (?). Its destruction falls into the late 14th or early 15th century. Its localisation, the collected material suitable for dating and the stratigraphic relations indicate that it might have been the house of the ‘first’ New Town settlers, who built their dwelling in the place of earlier buildings. This discovery indicates an earlier origin of local spatial relations, which were confirmed in the later period (accepted into the newly founded New Town). A later phase of stone architecture on the burgher plot after the foundation of the New Town was represented at the building site by the outer walls of an apparent multi-storey house. Its cellar spaces were at first covered by a flat beam ceiling, which in the subsequent phase of the existence of the building was replaced by a barrel vault built of quarry marlstone bound by lime mortar. This change to the house construction is documented by a window with a chamfer inner sill walled-up by the vault,11 excavated in the western outer wall of the building. The vault was lowered in the modern period in connection with the joining of the houses and to ensure a comfortable passage to the courtyard (Fig. 6). The construction of this new masonry house in the examined area can be dated to the early 15th century (?). The shift of its main mass ca 3 m to the east from the above­ described remnants of earlier buildings reflects an attempt to straighten the ‘newly’ delimited but not yet respected (?) street line (Fig. 7). The newly built burgher houses and their land plots then developed continually to the present day. The exceptions are two vanished buildings (136 Deym House, plot No. 842 and 137 Mitrovice Palace, plot No. 841), which were demolished in connection with an extension of Národní Street in the second half of the 1960s (Cymbalak, Musílek 2017, 141).12 11 A window with a chamfer inner sill. 12 Burgher houses themselves were only partially uncovered due to the localisation of the excavation (except for the completely preserved, original Gothic cellars at 135/II Schönkirch Palace). Two ‘newly uncovered’ Gothic cellars were documented in the northern section of the west frontage of Mikulandská Street. Both spaces belonged to an original medieval building that was subsequently incorporated into the core of a later corner house (No. 136). The vaults of the uncovered ceilings were broken, and the interiors filled during the demolition of the above-ground part of the local buildings in 1966.\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nFig. 6.

Kalíšek.\n\nA summary idea of the form and types of residential buildings in early medieval Prague is made more complicated by the fact, confirmed by discoveries from archaeological research, that buildings with above-ground structures (frame/half-timbered, postbuilt, log) were documented in several places. No more distinctive traces of these structures have survived, with only a few exceptions.13 This was due to the use of flammable materials in the technology used in the construction (the structural elements left no traces or only unrecognisable ones) because of reconstruction or intentional demolition. However, more favourable circumstances and thorough fieldwork documentation, for example at 1190/21 Soukenická Street, made it possible to detect remnants of a rectangular building from the second half of the 12th or the early 13th century. The feature with a ground plan trace of ca 50 m 2 had a load-bearing structure built from wooden posts and an unidentifiable number of\n\n13 For instance, New Town, Republiky Square – Omelka, Podliska 2004, 42–44; Spálená Street – Cymbalak, Staňková 2014, 155; Mikulandská Street – Cymbalak, Musílek 2017, 129, 134, 140–141; Lesser Town, Nebovidy – Havrda, Tryml 2013, 139–149, 380–390.\n\nstoreys (Ježek et al. 2009). The building ceased to exist in connection with the founding of the New Town (mid-14th century) in a non-violent manner, which is evidenced by the extraction of the parts of the load-bearing wooden structure (probably for secondary use elsewhere). Observations with identical phenomena can also be extended to the above-described western part of this self-governing unit founded by Charles IV (Cymbalak, Musílek 2017, 141). Judging from the density of the remnants of these structures at the individual sites, there is no doubt that the representation of these buildings was significant. On the other hand, we must accept the fact that our ideas concerning their form and number must be based on hypotheses. Suitable analogies to the above-ground parts of archaeol­ ogically examined structures known from Prague should be sought in other similar old medieval towns (Wrocław, Opole, Poznań, Brno, Kraków) or the medieval village milieu.14\n\n14 Most recently, a careful attitude to this statement was assumed by Jerzy Piekalski (see Piekalski 2014, 118).\n\n23\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nFig. 7.

When looking at these buildings from the builders’ viewpoint, when building a house, the foundation pit would first have to be dug. Its dimensions were 10 to 30 m 2, as needed.15 The depth of the pit, which would be subsequently used as the basement or semi-basement, would be adapted to the local hydrological or geological conditions; according to the documented finds, this might have been 1–2.5 m. The building’s load-bearing structure would probably take the form of wooden posts,16 the amount depending on the building’s area, the number of aboveground storeys and the structural possibilities of the 15 The floorage of the lowered ground floor of the houses that were documented within an excavation in George of Poděbrady Barracks in Republiky Square was between ca 40 m 2 (Kašák et al. 2009, 37) and 70 or 90 m 2 (Juřina et al. 2009, 49). 16 Although other types of structures (e.g. frame-like, trenchlike) can also be taken into account, there is absolutely no convincing evidence of their use so far. A quite different technological approach, stone lining, was used in the later period (second half of the 12th–13th centuries).\n\n24\n\nbuilding material (the diameter of the posts).17 Floor contexts of the individual basements indicate that walking surfaces were comprised either of a wood layer18 or packed material (resulting from the operation of the building or intentionally created at the time of its origin).19 The interior of the lowermost storey was delimited by the outer walls, whose form was interpreted as wooden in a predominant number of the excavated structures (in the case of buildings documented in Prague, it is impossible to determine more precisely whether they were round logs, halfround logs, log beams or planks. The character of 17 The variability of the numbers and dimensions of archaeol­ ogically detected post holes is very wide in Prague, and the available data does not allow any firm conclusions. On the other hand, several examined buildings enable only a general reconstruction (e.g. Huml 1998, 9; Juřina et al. 2009, 49; Havrda, Tryml 2013, 51, 138, 146–147). 18 Even though available literature includes mentions of walking surfaces of wood (e.g. Omelka, Podliska 2004, 42), it is often very difficult to distinguish a wooden floor from a fallen wall, ceiling or partition (Cymbalak, Musílek 2017, 134; Cymbalak, Rykl 2018, 413). 19 Admittedly, the archaeological contexts studied during excavations in the recessed interiors of the buildings represent at least the secondary form of the original basements.\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nthe structure – the trench-like, frame-like or other – is also unclear).20 A rarely preserved example of the design of the outer part of a semi-basement has been documented in the northern section of the east frontage of Spálená Street in the New Town. A 1 m long remnant of a wattlework wall represented by three post holes placed at a uniform distance (0.3 m) on the bottom of a ca 0.1 m deep narrow trench running in parallel with the edge of the foundation pit was documented in the yard of former House No. 70 (Cymbalak et al. 2013, 679–680). Stone masonry along the circumference of the basement is recorded in the next development phase of this building. The recessed space of the dwelling founded in the same place as the wood-and-clay house with a wattle wall was built of slate, quartzite and, in places, marlstone. Clayey soil was used as the binding material. The almost flat floor of the recessed room was comprised of a ca 3 cm thick layer of grey clay. The maximum depth of the partially preserved building was 1 m, and its outer dimensions were approximately 4.8 × 2.4 m. The almost rectangular interior was delimited by outer walls oscillating around 0.5 m in width. Their structure was characterised by layered levels of larger stones deposited along both the inner and outer face. Quartzite and slate fragments were added to the core of the wall (Cymbalak et al. 2013, 679–680). Natural conditions are of decisive importance for the preservation of wooden structures in Prague’s archaeological contexts.21 The character of the local geological subsoil does not contribute to the preservation of the evidence of carpenters’ work. An exception is represented by contexts documented in the left-bank area below Prague Castle in the territory of the present-day Lesser Town (Čiháková 2008). Within this context, we should not forget the possibilities of the secondary use of building material. For instance, when a dwelling ceased to exist in one part of the town, the individual structural elements could be used for construction at another place in another part of the town (e.g. Ježek et al. 2009, we are inclined to the option that transport was simpler between the Old and the New Town). Larger spaces might have been segmented both vertically (partitions) and horizontally (different floor levels). Such a design would secure corresponding temperatures for the storage of food and goods (see 20 See Čiháková 2004, 31. 21 Similar conditions were also recorded at other sites, see Čapek, Netolický 2014, 94.\n\nVařeka 2002, 271–272 including references). A separate factor concerning the use and functional furnishing of basements is represented by the advantages of cold rooms that are necessary for the storage of wine and perishable goods (meat, milk) or the medieval technology of beer production. A model example of the fulfilment of this basic privilege of burghers with full rights stemming from the foundation provisions (Hoffmann 1992, 182; Winter 1906, 423–424) can be studied in Świdnica, Silesia (Chorowska et al. 1998). Flat wooden ceilings represented a necessary element in multi-storey buildings. Log structures22 supported by a beam or beams probably predominated. Beams and board joists or log vaults cannot be ruled out either (see Škabrada 2003, 83–91). Regardless of whether the houses were slightly or more recessed, if they were single-storey then they lacked any ceiling, and the inner space was enclosed and protected from the weather only by the roof. Flammable materials – wood, straw or reed – were commonly used to make roofs, both the truss and the covering of these dwellings. The use of non-flammable pantiles (see below) can only be considered for later periods and only sporadically. We are uncertain whether shingles had a dominant position because the use of planks, boards and slabs as roofing cannot be ruled out for smaller buildings. Saddle-shaped roofs probably dominated the medieval Prague horizon accompanied by simpler shed roof structures. Due to the lack of sufficient exact evidence, we can only believe that the interior equipment of the individual buildings was very simple and did not differ much in form from smoky rooms in rural dwellings known from later periods. Besides several remnants of heating devices recorded within the archaeological excavations in the interiors of non-masonry buildings in the territory of Prague (e.g. 135 Mikulandská Street – Cymbalak, Musílek 2017, 134, 139; 387 Karmelitská Street; 459 Nebovidská Street – Havrda, Tryml 2013, 139–149, 387; Ostrovní Street – ZIP;23 Čimice – Huml 1988, 353–368; Klárov – Hrdlička 1972, 654; 211 Nerudova Street – Čiháková 2004, 33), there are no further indications of their internal furnishing. The function of post and 22 Rough-hewn round logs whose profile might have been identical to the profiles used in a log wall.

(West Bohemian Institute for the Protection and Documentation of Monuments) for the preliminary information.\n\n25\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nstake holes that have been documented in the interiors of the individual buildings can only be assumed.24 Most probably, they might have represented benches, tables or sleeping places, or possibly shelves elevated to a relatively dry height. The localisation of recessed spaces on the examined plots in Prague documents a considerable variety in the possible forms of connecting their basements to above-ground structures. The three basic variants are as follows: recessed spaces near the street frontage under the main building (16%); a basement in the deeper sections of above-ground buildings whose narrower (gable) part is facing the street (44%); the lowermost parts of separate buildings (economic or residential) that were situated in the rear part of the plot (11%). Other variations may be considered (Radová-Štiková 1991b).25 Provisional houses, whose design and interior furnishing need not have been impressive due to their temporary character, occurred in the pre-urban Prague, as in the early phases of other Bohemian towns.26 Given the limited time and resources, the newly arriving inhabitants had to content themselves with the basic advantages of buildings recessed below the level of the terrain (Muk 1991, 88; Michna 1988, 265–266; Klápště et al. 1996, 148). The low number of examples of buildings with such a design, however, indicates that dwellings with a saddle roof based on two load-bearing posts and the surface of the terrain (pit houses) were rather sporadic or, more precisely, most of them were replaced by later buildings or activities at the time of the transformation of proto-urban settlement agglomeration into later organised self-governing units.27 Remnants of houses with basements have been documented on both the left and right banks of the Vltava in Prague and are among the oldest.28 It needs 24 Here, we do not mean negative imprints situated along the circumference of the described buildings, which most probably belonged to the wall structures. 25 For 66% of the analysed features, it has been impossible to determine closer localisation more precisely within the plots. 26 Cf. Škabrada 1978, 363, Fig. 17. 27 Several years ago, Pavel Vařeka presented a more detailed reflection on the economic demands, functionality and appearance of provisional houses in Bohemia and Moravia (Vařeka 2002, 262–266). 28 Buildings that already ceased to exist during the 12th century were recorded both in the very core of the Lesser Town (1/III and 258/III Malostranské Square) and in the earliest part of the Old Town settlement area (261/I Liliová Street)\n\n26\n\nto be pointed out, however, that the slightly recessed log structures characteristic of the earlier period were used besides more modern buildings that were equipped with basements (Čiháková 1999, 21).29 This transformation has been documented in several places in Prague (e.g. Spálená Street – New Town, Nebovidy – Lesser Town) and confirms the stability of the occupation that was reflected in the additions to the structures or layouts of the individual buildings. Stone linings start to gradually appear along the circumferences of the basements and semi-basements (Cymbalak et al. 2011, 30). The earlier design of the entrances is replaced by masonry entrance staircases called entrance necks (e.g. Republiky Square, see Juřina et al. 2009, 49). An interesting but not unique example of a residential building designed in this manner from the close vicinity of Prague Old Town was examined by Michal Tryml in the area of the ancient settlement of Na Rybníčku (Prague 2, New Town, 1319/II Žitná Street – Tryml 2000; 2001). The original village, one of many similar settlement units surrounding the core of the right bank of the agglomeration before the founding of Prague New Town, was absorbed by the town founded by Charles IV after the mid-14th century. Using pottery vessel fragments, the whole period in the development of the site can be dated to the 12th and 13th centuries. An approximately 1 m deep rectangular feature, most probably a remnant of a multi-storey building, was examined there within the framework of the pre-urban settlement horizon that consisted of a low stratigraphy of typical settlement features, shallow pits, fireplaces, small furnaces and post holes. The almost perpendicular walls of the orthogonally designed basement were surrounded by a stone lining built of small, carefully laid stones. The recessed space with internal dimensions of 5 × 4.5 m was accessible from the west along four stairs of the entrance neck partially situated outside the layout of the house (Fig. 8). The feature belonged to the latest phase of the pre-urban horizon. The excavated part of the settlement can undoubtedly be linked to or along the ancient road connecting Prague Castle with Vyšehrad (1924/II and 203/II Pštrossova Street). See Čiháková 1995, 227; 1999, 21; Čiháková, Zavřel 1997, 15–16, 24–25; Cymbalak, Podliska 2008, 314, 323–324. 29 Similar conclusions concerning the later developmental phase of medieval buildings in the core of Prague Old Town, i.e. a coexistence of non-masonry houses with recessed spaces and masonry small-ashlar houses, were reached by Hrdlička more than a decade earlier (see Hrdlička 1980; 1983, 623–625).\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nFig. 8.

The complete absence of 14th-century finds testifies to the fact that no structures were situated on the plot after the foundation of the New Town, and the prospective activities left no traces.30 The state of preservation of the historical terrains makes demonstrable reconstructions of the appearance of the above-ground parts of the buildings almost impossible. The attempts made to date, although with maximum effort on the part of the authors, with the application of available analogies and a wide empirical apparatus, are merely the outcome of the application of archaeologists’ and building historians’ notions on the detected negative imprints of the original archaeological contexts. Only exceptional contexts enable a visualisation of selected structures (e.g. Huml 1998, 9; Havrda, Tryml 2013, 50, 138, 146–147; Juřina 2005, 154; Juřina et al. 2009, 49). The function of most recessed spaces, which represent the most conclusive evidence of the building, is often unclear. As stated above, it remains questionable whether they were used for housing or the storage of goods. It is often problematic to ascertain the nearest archaeological context of the features or to answer the question of whether 30 The results of excavations carried out in the close vicinity (e.g. in Krakovská Street) point out the necessity of revising the previous hypotheses, according to which the beginning of a continuous built-up area there has its roots in the second phase of construction after 1380 (see Tryml 2000, 386).\n\nthese features represented a separate unit or part of a larger structural whole. With dissatisfaction, we need to state that the current state of the functional interpretation of secular buildings from the period between the 12th century and the first half of the 14th century in the urban milieu is the consequence of the development of anthropogenic overburden (the removal of its upper parts) and, in most cases, of the emergence of later buildings in the same place. The main features of the transformation of medieval Prague’s secular architecture were summed up in a study devoted to the beginnings of organised construction on the right bank of the Vltava in Prague (see Cymbalak, Rykl 2018, 411–412). The results of archaeological and building-historical surveys indicate that the most distinctive signs of the evolution of the occupation and, therefore, of the transformation of the building appearance of the Prague conurbation can be characterised by four phases that may be dated to the broad framework of the 12th–15th centuries (Fig. 9). Phase A – pre-urban I/II – ‘earlier/later settlement’ – a built-up area without demonstrable foundation or parcelling; it follows directions of routes (they definitely cannot be called streets) and, at the same time, respects other settlement and natural elements (such as cemeteries, public spaces – marketplaces or the configuration of the terrain). Phase B – pre-urban III – ‘suburbium’ – the settlement unit is not delimited by walls; the structure of the territory is stabilised in a certain manner, the 27\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nroutes and public areas are already traditionally anchored and the built-up areas of various compactness respect them; in some parts, there are readable attempts at organisation or reorganisation of the territory and street lines or at more systematic, surveyed parcelling.\n\nPhase C – early urban – ‘young town’ – a town within walls that have been established de iure and are gradually being built de facto – the structure of the (so far relatively free) territory is parcelled out into plots in a controllable and geometrical manner; the activity complies with the sovereign’s foundation\n\nFig. 9.

Phase D – urban – ‘town and reparcelling’ – the parcelling process is completed; reparcelling occurs – the division or joining of plots or regrouping of buildings within the already (more or less) stable structures; some alleys vanish secondarily. Besides the documented and briefly characterised phenomena and patterns, there were certainly numerous examples of structures whose development cannot be simply categorised within imaginary typological frameworks. An example of such a building may be the newly excavated house at 134 Mikulandská Street. Although its documented form most probably comes from the 15th century, it can be predicted with much certainty that its roots can be traced back to the third quarter or the end of the 14th century.31 An excavation revealed a larger fragment of a corner cellar space that belonged to the street wing of the medieval house. The southwest corner of the recessed room was not orthogonally closed; instead, it had the form of a marlstone portal, carefully built askew to the perimeter masonry. It ensured access from the outside; more precisely, it might have led to a neighbouring room situated in the basement of the building. The external masonry technology was not the same in the whole extent of the structure. The excavated contexts document that the northern section of the house’s outer wall was not built of stone but comprised of a wooden structure that was most probably interlinked with a non-flammable part in the immediate proximity of the portal.32 The reasons for this design can only be speculated on. There may be several causes, and when attempting to answer the question, we should not forget the most prosaic ones – financial difficulties during the construction; a change of the owner of the house; a provisional/temporary solution that complied with 31 Based on analogies from the immediate vicinity (e.g. 135 Mikulandská Street, see Cymbalak, Musílek 2017, 140–142). 32 I thank R. Široký of ZIP o.p.s. for the preliminary information and the opportunity to study the site.\n\nthe requirements present at that time; or, last but not least, the construction of the building in the place of an earlier house with a wooden basement. The historical core of the capital city may provide more examples of similar situations (for instance, the design of the eastern part of external masonry in the cellar areas of former House No. 72, Spálená Street – Cymbalak et al. 2011). The outlined situations evidence a hectic development both within the individual plots and within the broader scope of the town. The interpretation presented above can also be applied to the earlier period (12th–13th centuries) and contexts from the Old Town, the Lesser Town (Čiháková 2005) or from the territories of the traditional settlements incorporated in the area of the later Prague New Town. Therefore, it can be stated that the construction intensity from the initial phase of the permanent medieval occupation on the right bank of the Vltava in Prague shows similar signs of activity to those documented at the time of Charles’s foundation in the mid-14th century or of the second construction wave in the late 14th century.\n\n7. Rural estates of Prague burghers The issue of the earliest burgher architecture in medieval Prague must not neglect an important specific phenomenon that can be observed in the later phase of the Middle Ages (14th–15th centuries) through excavated archaeological contexts as well as records in historical sources. One of the characteristic features of rich people from Prague in the late 14th and early 15th centuries was the purchase of rural estates, on which many of them regularly lived. The ownership of farms was one of the attributes of Prague’s rich middle class in the 14th and 15th centuries. At that time, Prague was surrounded by a relatively dense network of these estates and manor houses. Many members of the urban elite turned them into their family residences and a means of manifesting their position on the social ladder. Exceptionally preserved archival sources or archaeologically examined features from this category of residences prove that these properties formed an inseparable part of Prague’s economic hinterland. Besides their main role – agricultural production offering new sources of income for their owners – they represented a recognisable manifestation of the rise in the aspirations of the most affluent inhabitants of the town. A building, or rather a complex belonging to a representative of the rich strata of Prague burghers has been recently uncovered by a rescue excavation in 29\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nFig. 10.

Semerád based on the authors’ materials and fieldwork documentation.\n\n30\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nJinonice (1 Na Vidouli Street, Prague 5 – Jinonice). The origin of the manor house was predetermined by a favourable location in a narrow valley in a traditional agricultural area near an ancient road connecting Prague with its broader vicinity. The residence was first owned by Prague burghers, and in the modern period by representatives of the nobility (Cymbalak, Kašpar 2019; Cymbalak, Musílek 2021, 165–168). The remnants of the high medieval manor house have been assigned to three phases of a larger complex from the 14th–15th centuries (Fig. 10). The construction quality of the earlier phase of the building, which was very solidly built, including a moat surrounded by a wall,33 is documented by pantile roofing, which was unique in the manor houses of this period (the first half of the 14th century). The second development phase of the residence (ca mid-14th century) is characterised by a change in road patterns and an increase in the proportion of structures built using stone. The third phase, datable to the time immediately following the Hussite period (1430s), is documented by quality stonemason work represented by a discovered late Gothic window whose fragments belonged to a building with clear self-representation ambitions. This final phase of the existence of the original medieval manor house indicates the work of a technically advanced building workshop. The area of the original manor house might have been 1,950 m 2, of which the excavation uncovered ca 30% in its northeastern part. The remnants of the entrance building, a gatehouse with a space that is tentatively interpreted as a trapping pit and two standalone structures were documented in the core of the manor house. The function of the more northerly situated three-compartment (?) rectangular building (min. 14 × 6.5 m) that was attached to the northern escarpment of the complex can be tentatively linked to the core of the residential building (‘palace’). The area of the two rooms that have been fully excavated amounted to approximately 20 m 2. A recessed square structure in the form of a small masonry cellar or basement with internal dimensions of ca 4 × 3 m (detected depth: 1.2 m; width of the predominantly marlstone lining: 0.5 m) was uncovered in the presumed central part of the core of 33 The well-bound chamfered masonry of the core of the complex in the direction of the moat was precisely worked, which is especially evident in the shaping of the edges and thus the silhouette observable at that time. Limestone was used in contact with water or in areas with high humidity and marlstone higher in the dry zone.\n\nthe manor house. It cannot be ruled out that this was the location of the above-ground part of the tower or granary (most probably wooden or half-timbered). Remnants of two bridge structures built from carefully worked oak beams were found in the lower parts of the moat. The localisation of earlier (early 14th century) and later (mid-14th century) wooden elements of the two bridge structures indicates that the core of the complex was accessible from the east (from the direction which most probably led to a road connecting Prague with nearby villages). The original manor house most likely ceased to exist in the early modern period (late 15th? – mid-16th century), possibly in connection with a change in property relations. A new Renaissance building was erected in almost the same place several decades later (late 16th – early 17th century), replacing the original medieval residence situated further to the south (Cymbalak, Kašpar 2019; Cymbalak, Musílek 2021, 165–168).\n\n8. The appearance of street fronts To add more information concerning the appearance of Prague’s street frontages in the late 12th and early 13th centuries, we need to point out a context, examined several years ago, of a vanished wooden structure with a basement that is usually listed as 436 Michalská Street in the professional literature (Dragoun, Rakušan 2006). However, its position must be clearly bound to buildings in the eastern frontage of Jilská Street. Remnants of a pit house or small cellar of a wooden residential building with minimum dimensions of 3.2 × 3.1 × 1.3 m and a 1 m wide entrance neck in the northwest corner of the recessed space were detected in the southwest corner of the layout of the present-day house. Remnants of the building’s wooden structures were visible in undisturbed parts of the excavated basement near the north, west and east walls. A detailed observation of the best-preserved northern outer wall of the room revealed a structure formed by small beams linked to stakes in the corners and the centre.34 A similar design was most probably also applied to other walls. Based on the character of the fill layers and a rich assemblage of pottery material, it is likely that the recessed space was filled during a short time in the first half of the 13th century (Dragoun, Rakušan 2004, 37). 34 An analogical but somewhat larger (5.4 × 4.3 × min. 1 m) structure was uncovered 50 years ago by Hrdlička during an excavation in Klárov (Hrdlička 1972, 653–654).\n\n31\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nFig. 11. Comparative chronological scheme of selected settlement phenomena applicable to reference case studies. Based on the authors’ concept, created by M. Kalíšek.\n\nA fragment of a similar structure, with a minimum discovered depth reached at ca 2 m and a minimum width of 2.2 m, was documented further to the east. The remnants of wood documented along its longer sides can be interpreted as relics of a structure that spread out into the free space upon its destruction, as visible from the profile and the character of the fill of the lower part of the feature. A rich find assemblage, from which light pottery decorated in a red earth was absent, 35 included whole pottery vessels (pots called technical bowls) and a rich slag collection. The authors of the excavation date the destruction of the structure to the time around the mid-13th century (Dragoun, Rakušan 2004, 37). Both of these briefly characterised structures were interpreted as parts of wooden buildings along Jilská Street: they inspire consideration of their row character and a stabilised street line at least in this place. They were replaced later by stone houses although probably not before the late 13th century (Dragoun, Rakušan 2006). The findings from 436/I Jilská Street are crucial to the study of the transformation of the earliest 35 Its occurrence in Prague can be dated to the second half of the 13th and the early 14th centuries (most recently Havrda, Matějková 2014, 38–41 including references).\n\n32\n\nburgher houses in Prague, as not very distant examples of similar contexts from Husova Street document that rather than a unique case, they represent the coexistence of two building approaches/ techniques. Nearly three decades earlier, discoveries from an excavation in House No. 352/I in Husova Street documented that basements (pit houses) of wooden houses neighboured stone residential buildings built in the Romanesque style (Hrdlička 1983, 621, 625, Fig. 6; more recently, see Havrda et al. 2014, 68, Fig. 3). According to the results of this excavation, the eastern frontage of Husova Street was stabilised as early as the first half of the 13th century (Hrdlička 1983, 621, 625, Fig. 6; more recently, see Havrda et al. 2014, 68, Fig. 3). It consisted of both the stone Romanesque house and the more northerly wooden buildings (Hrdlička 1983, 621, 625, Fig. 6). It is symptomatic that the Romanesque house had no entrance openings in the direction of the wooden structures and it is, therefore, likely that the wooden buildings were not part of it. Although the author of the excavation only pondered evidence of a stabilised street line, we will, given the facts stated above, consider not only the street line but also the possibility of row houses coming into existence as early as the first half of the 13th century in the immediate vicinity.\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nAn approximately square space in the central part of the southern wing of the built-up area is usually considered the earliest part of the architecture preserved on the plot of House No. 436/I. This might represent the remnants of the earliest stone house, which was a relatively fireproof structure situated in the depth of the plot (Dragoun, Rakušan 2004, 37). However, the entrance to this masonry basement was situated from the east, which most likely indicates that it was part of the buildings oriented to the parallel Michalská Street. Based on this and the situation outlined above, it is acceptable that the above-described recessed wooden basement structures, which most probably belonged to multi-storey half-timbered buildings, also neighboured stone houses there, together forming the joint east frontage of Jilská Street. Whether this represents the earlier period when the dwelling was situated in an extramural settlement (Čiháková 2005, 158; Cymbalak, Rykl 2018, 412–420) or the form of a fully developed burgher house built in a newly founded town (Cymbalak, Rykl 2018, 429–436), its transformation was the gradual outcome of several factors. We believe that at least two of them appear to be decisive. First, we need to name the initiative of the sovereign who initiated new or reorganised earlier land conditions to strengthen his administrative and economic interests: these changes affected the town’s economy as a consequence (Ježek et al. 2009, 134–135). This evolution can be best studied in those parts of the historical core of Prague that had existed as suburbs before the founding of self-governing units; for instance, in the New Town before 1348, Opatovi­ce, Újezd sv. Martina, the area east of St Benedict Gate (e.g. Ježek et al. 2009, 122; Cymbalak, Rykl 2018; Cymbalak, Staňková 2014, 162). The situation in the territory that was delimited and protected by the town wall, i.e. after the foundation of the Old Town (first half of the 13th century) or later the Lesser Town (second half of the 13th century) was different, depending on the circumstances that were in effect a delineated and an organised space (Cymbalak, Rykl 2018, 441–443). Another important impulse for change was the reaction to tragic events (fire, flood). Their impact on the original built-up area was considerable in the confined environment of medieval and even early modern towns, and their frequency was certainly by no means exceptional.36 36 A brief summary of fires and floods documented, among other events, by the archaeological research of the historical\n\nAn archaeological example of the mentioned conversion is a situation that has been recorded in the Lesser Town extramural settlement. Contexts evidencing an earlier dwelling that vanished towards the end of the 13th century; a later structure with a basement near the street frontage (14th century);37 and a high medieval masonry house (mid-15th century) corresponding to the already established notions of a fully-fledged townhouse (Čiháková 2005)38 were documented in the plot of present-day 211 in Nerudova Street, Lesser Town. Both factors mentioned above led to a change in the building procedures, the introduction of new, more permanent structures and technical innovations. For each change that occurred in the newly arisen situation, we need to take into consideration the space for the application of a new architectural style that was a welcome attribute of social standing in the urban milieu (see above). The pragmatic attitude of the owners of the individual properties, who sought the highest possible functionality of the house, needs to be taken into account in these considerations. The buildings and their land plots had to fulfil the function of a craft workshop, merchant storehouse or shop, as well as a home for their family (Klápště et al. 1996, 163, 165; Piekalski 2014, 118). This is why we should accept Vařeka’s idea of an economic or rather utility function of recessed parts of medieval houses, which is linked to the building culture of the newly arriving inhabitants of the earliest towns (Vařeka 2002, 268, 270). Their foundation opened up space for foreign inhabitants whose arrival enriched the local situation with a new core of Prague was published several years ago by Zdeněk Dragoun (Dragoun 2002a including references). For a detailed list of great floods in the lower reaches of the Vltava and above all the catastrophic centennial floods (1272, 1273, 1336, 1342, 1359, 1367, 1370, 1373, 1374, 1387, 1432), which swallowed the whole floodplain and also rose to the adjacent, densely populated terrace, see Kotyza et al. 1995, 56–59. 37 The most probable multi-storey house was built using a new construction technique in the form of a half-timbered structure. The whole building with a heating device in the form of a tiled stove from vessel-shaped tiles that was situated on the ground floor (?) was destroyed by fire (most probably during the Hussite Revolution – 1420; see Čiháková 2004, 30; 2005, 158, 162–163). 38 Although no direct archival sources are available concerning the events on this plot during the great fire in the Lesser Town and Hradčany in 1541, we can accept almost with certainty that like other houses in its neighbourhood, this first masonry building on the plot was destroyed and replaced by a new Renaissance building, later named ‘Valkoun House’ after one of its owners (see Vlček 1999, 315 including references and sources).\n\n33\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\nconception of a dwelling, which had to fulfil several functions at once given the rather small and predetermined area of an urban plot. As stated above, the transformation in the sphere of materials, building techniques, approaches to the use of the area for the dwelling and its internal spatial organisation (larger density of buildings, new inhabitants of the town, changes in the spatial arrangement of the plot) took place in Prague’s early medieval agglomeration during the wider period of the 12th–13th centuries and overlapped into the following century (Fig. 11). Similar processes, characterised by a condensation of the plots, an increase in the number of buildings on their area or the situation of residential buildings next to the stabilised (or emerging) street network, among other things, also took place concurrently in other parts of the continent. Besides settlement agglomerations in the western part of the southern shore of the Baltic Sea (e.g. Lübeck, Haithabu), these manifestations have been recorded in towns of Central and Eastern Europe (Kaliningrad, Gdańsk, Kraków, Poznań). We cannot oppose the statement made years ago that the effort to introduce order in the area of land plots and buildings in earlier settlement units reflects their economic and demographic transformation, which resulted in the emergence and development of fully developed towns (cf. Fehring 1997). Houses with recessed basements evidence a major transformation that took place in the Bohemian Basin at the end of the Early Middle Ages. Based on the results of archaeological research, we can state that their occurrence can be linked to the transformation of earlier extramural settlements/suburbia surrounding the sovereign’s residences or, more precisely, with the birth of new settlement organisms, early towns. The presented material makes it evident that the earliest horizon of townhouses in medieval Prague is firmly linked to orthogonal semi-recessed and recessed structures that were part of above-ground buildings. What we know about them is almost exclusively due to archaeology, depending on the state of preservation of the undamaged anthropogenic overburden in the historical core of the city. The outlined examples indicate that these structures might have had various functions, depending on the context and period. The not very convincing signs of inhabitation (the absence of interior furnishing,\n\n34\n\nsporadic heating devices)39 support the hypothesis of their storage function.\n\n9. Conclusion The present chapter represents the first more complex attempt at addressing the issues related to early buildings of a secular character in the territory of the Prague agglomeration. Bibliographic research of the available professional literature and selected archaeological excavation reports carried out in the historical centre of Prague has yielded, for the first time within the study of local medieval secular architecture, information about 226 non-masonry residential buildings. It needs to be pointed out that this is data about the most distinctive evidence of architecture that can be studied using archaeological procedures. We are aware of the fact that above-ground structures (hardly provable today), semi-recessed features and buildings containing small cellars existed there at the same time. Within the historical core of the city (a territory where a settlement/urbanistic transformation and the related excavations have been taking place since the beginning of its existence), the evidence of past human activities is continually disturbed, redeposited and destroyed. The source base for the studied issues thus depends on the level of preservation of the anthropogenic overburden and the archaeological contexts concealed within it. More systematic examination of these issues within the broader settlement or chronological context of medieval Prague has only been conducted at a few sites (Republiky Square – Juřina et al. 2009; Karmelitská – Havrda, Tryml 2013; COPA/QUADRIO – Cymbalak et al. 2011; Cymbalak, Staňková 2014; Národní– Mikulandská / DRN – Cymbalak, Musílek 2017; Cymbalak, Rykl 2018). All these projects were archaeological excavations that have taken place over the past two decades. The individual projects took the form of large-scale excavations related to investor projects. They all concerned unique sites whose position within the spatial arrangement of the medieval agglomeration promised significant findings. Of earlier fieldwork that represents a cornerstone for the issues 39 At this point, we need to mention once again the exceptional example of a quite different situation in Hradišťko near Davle, a place not far from Prague, where rare and rich assemblages of everyday material culture and finds belonging to the equipment of the individual dwellings were documented in the remnants of a mining settlement (Kavan 1956; Richter 1982).\n\nChapter 2 | On the earliest burgher houses in Prague\n\npresented in this text, we must not forget excavations by Hrdlička and the results of his projects in Klárov (Hrdlička 1972) or in U Sladkých House in Husova Street, Old Town of Prague (Hrdlička 1980; 1983, 625, Fig. 6). The latest fieldwork whose results promise to add new facts to the existing knowledge includes projects at 854 Bílkova Street, 553/2 Celetná Street (Sixt House; Kašpar, Vyšohlíd 2020 including references; Vyšohlíd 2022) and in the place of an undeveloped gap site in U Milosrdných Street (plot No. 904–910/4) in the Old Town carried out by Archaia Praha. With impatience, we can await the publication of more information about a find made by Labrys organisation at 597/13 Celetná Street (597/8 Štupartská Street).
