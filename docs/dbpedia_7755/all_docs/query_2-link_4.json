        "text": "The Principality of Carnovia (Czech: Krnovské knížectví) also known by its short-form name, Carnovia (Czech: Krnov) is a de facto autonomous region that claims to be a sovereign state, commonly known as a micronation. It is successor state to Archduchy of Egeria and was formed on 21 November 2021. Located in the Czech Republic and bordered by Poland from east in Central Europe. The nation is comprised of four regional territories bordering the Czech Moravian-Silesian region. The total surface area of Carnovia is 203 km2 with four districts established: Capital, Branov District, Olbernia District, Karlovice District. It is bordered by Poland to the east and Czech Republic to the west. The nation's capital and largest city is Carnovia [a] (Czech: Krnov). The official language of principality is Czech, Slovak and English. In addition Polish is spoken and understood by many residents.\n\nThe principality is governed under a form of constitutional monarchy, with Prince Peter I as head of state, who wields immense political power despite his constitutional status such as issuing princely decrees, so called the by-law regulations. The Prime Minister, who is the head of government, can be either a Czech or a Slovak citizen, [b][1] but preferable is Carnovian citizen. Parliament consists of only one chamber called Princely Council, which has 20 deputies one of them being the Chairman of Princely Council, who oversees the proceedings.\n\nMany similarities and history is shared with Czech republic and former Lands of Bohemian crown and also with former Archduchy of Egeria. Carnovia uses czech language as its primary language, despite declaring independence and having a bad political relations with its former mother state, Carnovia acknowledges czech laws. However the self-determination of nation is superior than honoring mother state. On the basis of self-determination and right to choose to have any citizenship, Carnovia and her citizens have made claim. Principality of Carnovia declared independence on 21 November 2021 as successor state of Archduchy of Egeria. Carnovia is as well successor state of Duchy of Carnovia, which existed in years 1377 - 1849. Historical context and existence of Carnovia is basis of the nowadays claim of Principality of Carnovia.\n\nCarnovia is developing country with almost no economic resources as it does not collect taxes and does not export any goods. However Government with help of Carnovian National Bank and postal service draft plans to start the economy by first step valorizing the currency Carnovian koruna. Although principality has the minimum GDP it ranks high on the Human Development Index, offering social security and a Universal Healthcare system. Carnovia is member state of Grand Unified Micronational.\n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nThe Principality of Carnovia (Latin: Principatus Karnoviensis) is called Krnovské knížectví or simply Krnov. German Term Fürstentum Jägerndorf. The name of the Principality was choosed in attempt to build on heritage of Principality of Carnovia, which lasted from 1377 until 1849. The right to use this name grants us The document of Declaration of Independence, which mentions pursuit for restoration Carnovia state. The first documented name Kyrnow dates from 1240 and is derived from the personal name Krn , using the possessive suffix -ov, Silesian: Karńůw (Carnovia) . In translation, the name meant \"Krn's property (castle)\" [2] The German name Jegerdorf (\"hunting village\") is first recorded in 1253, it was probably chosen for its phonetic proximity to the Czech name. In 1281, the name Jegerndorf appeared, from which the later Jägerndorf evolved. The Latin designation Carnovia , which originated from the Czech model, dates from 1316 as \"Karnovia\".\n\nFirst Principality 1377-1849\n\nThe province had been established in 1269 on lands which until then had been part of the Bohemian Margraviate of Moravia, when King Ottokar II of Bohemia vested his natural son Nicholas I with Opava. Together with the adjacent Duchy of Racibórz, it was under the direct rule of a cadet branch of the royal Přemyslid dynasty—unlike most other Silesian duchies ruled by the Silesian Piasts, who nevertheless in large part also had become Bohemian vassals in 1327. Nicholas retained Opava after the last Přemyslid ruler of Bohemia, King Wenceslaus III, was killed in 1306. In the following struggle for the Bohemian throne, he backed the claims of the Luxembourg candidate John the Blind, who in turn enfeoffed his son and successor Nicholas II with the Duchy of Opava in 1318. In 1337, Nicholas II also received the neighbouring Duchy of Racibórz upon the death of the last Piast duke Leszek.\n\nWhen Duke Nicholas II died in 1365, his eldest son John I inherited the Duchy of Racibórz, while the Duchy of Opava from 1367 was ruled jointly by him and his younger brothers Nicholas III, Wenceslaus I and Přemek I. When in 1377 the brothers finally divided their Opava heritage, the eldest, John I, received the newly established Duchy of Krnov [c] (English: Carnovia) together with the Bruntál estates. Upon his death in 1380/82, Racibórz, Krnov and Bruntál were inherited by his elder son John II \"the Iron\".\n\nIn 1384, Duke John II sold Krnov to the Piast duke Władysław of Opole, who ceded it to the Luxembourg margrave Jobst of Moravia in 1390. After Jobst had died in 1411, his cousin Emperor Sigismund pawned Krnov to the Piast duke Louis II of Brieg, but in 1422 again ceded it to John II, who could redeem the pledge. Two years later, the duchy was inherited by his sons Wenceslaus II and Nicholas V, who ruled jointly until 1437, when Nicholas received Krnov together with Bruntál, Pless, Rybnik, Loslau, and Sohrau. Upon his death in 1452, Krnov (English: Carnovia) and Loslau fell to his elder son John IV, while Rybnik, Sohrau and Pless fell to his younger brother Wenceslaus III.\n\nThe Přemyslid dukes finally lost Krnov during the Bohemian–Hungarian War in 1474 to Matthias Corvinus, then anti-king of Bohemia, who had John IV captured and arrested. After John's death in 1483, his sister Barbara, consort of Duke Jan IV of Oświęcim, tried to regain the duchy; however, Vladislav II Jagiellon, having prevailed as Bohemian king, had no intention to return the seized duchy but enfeoffed his chancellor Johann von Schellenberg with Krnov (English: Carnovia) instead. An agreement was reached in 1492, when Barbara's daughter Helena married Schellenberg's son George.\n\nIn 1523, George of Schellenberg had to sell Krnov to the Hohenzollern margrave George of Brandenburg-Ansbach, who could rely on the Hungarian inheritance of his consort Beatrice de Frangepan, widow of Matthias Corvinus. From 1532 the margrave ruled over all Upper Silesia, when he also inherited the Duchy of Opole and Racibórz from the Piast duke Jan II the Good. He had Krnov Castle rebuilt and introduced the Protestant Reformation in Silesia, having the local Teutonic Knights, Franciscans and Minorites expelled. The increasing power of the Protestant House of Hohenzollern in the Silesian crown lands was suspiciously eyed by Ferdinand I of Habsburg, Bohemian king since 1526. Nevertheless, George as well as his son Margrave George Frederick, who ruled from 1543, were able to keep the duchy. The conflict aggravated when George Frederick died childless in 1603 and bequested Krnov to his cousin Elector Joachim III Frederick of Brandenburg, who gave it to his son Johann Georg in 1607. The Habsburg rulers regarded the duchy a reverted fief and after the Bohemian Revolt and the 1620 Battle of White Mountain Emperor Ferdinand II confiscated the Hohenzollern possessions in his Bohemian lands.[3] Ferdinand's loyal supporter Prince Karl I of Liechtenstein, Duke of Opava since 1613, received Krnov. Both duchies were merged in 1623 and subjected to Counter-Reformation.\n\nThe House of Hohenzollern never withdrew the claims and more than one hundred years later, the Krnov and Racibórz possessions were a pretext for the Prussian king Frederick the Great to start the First Silesian War, ending with the annexation of most of Silesia according to the Treaty of Breslau in 1742. While a small northern part was merged into the now Prussian Duchy of Opole, the bulk of Krnov remained with the Bohemian Crown as part of Austrian Silesia. Re-organised as the Krnov District (Czech: Krnovský kraj) from 1751, it was finally dissolved after the 1848 Revolution, when Austrian Silesia was raised to the status of a Cisleithanian crown land.\n\nSecond Principality 2021\n\nThe Principality of Carnovia was formed on 21 November 2021 by declaration of independence by prince Peter I of Carnovia and Princely Council in Carnovia (city). There were many reasons that led to the decision to break away from the Czech Republic and these were mainly the country's strong political instability, the decline of democracy and freedom, and above all the failure to meet basic legal standards in the past. All of these factors have initiated the prince's interest in intervening to create a new environment where citizens are not part of a collapsing state apparatus. Before it came to the actual declaration of autonomy of the Principality of Carnovia, it was under the territorial administration of the Czech Republic. Carnovia is also a succesor state of Egeria and efforts to become independent in the past, unfortunately these efforts have been wasted as its own citizens have lost interest in continuing. One of the main reasons was the location of Egeria and the impossibility of gaining real self-government in such an area. After some time of inactivity, however, the decision was made to establish Carnovia with claim that would flow its basis also from historical sources.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe Principality of Carnovia is a parliamentary monarchy where the Government exercises power on behalf of the sovereign, now Prince Peter I of Carnovia, who by tradition holds all the executive power. The prince is the highest authority in the state. The state is governed by a Constitution[4] approved by the Princely Council and the Prince. The Government is responsible to the Princely Council and is formed by whoever is the leader of the political party that has a majority after the Princely Council elections or can win that majority within the multi-party coalition. The Prince of the Carnovia Principality has extensive formal powers, but his role is primarily (though not exclusively) ceremonial. He is the integral element of the council, and it is he who gives it, in a solemn act, the power to meet and make laws. No law goes into effect until it's signed by the Prince. The legislative power is the Princely Council, which does not support any other form of legislature.\n\nLegislature\n\nThe Princely Council has legislative power and has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government via hearings and inquiries. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the Carnovia. It is necessary to obtain more than 50% of the vote for a law, and more than 60% of the votes for constitutional laws. The Princely Council has the power to declare a state of war and martial law. Assuming corruption or any other offense is proven to a public official, whatever position he is stripped of all mandates. The Princely Council cannot be dissolved. Any member of the Council may be removed.\n\nExecutive\n\nThe Government exercises executive power in the Principality of Carnovia. The government is led by prime minister, who selects all the other ministers. The prime minister and their most senior ministers belong to the supreme decision-making committee, known as the Cabinet. Ministers are responsible to the Princely Council. There are at the moment 7 Ministries following: Ministry of interior, Ministry of foreign affairs, Ministry of justice, Ministry of finance, Ministry of health, Ministry of defence, Ministry of culture.\n\nThe Prime minister presides over the Government, holds the executive power that is bestowed on him through the Prince and selects ministers and advises the sovereign in exercising much of the princedom's prerogative. Given that modern prime ministers hold office on the basis of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons, they usually sit as an MP and lead the largest party or coalition in the House.\n\nThe Prince is a head of the state and holds executive power and is also involved in the creation of new laws, his function is to pass laws but he can also propose them. The archduke has veto power. If a bill wants to be drafted and enacted, it must get more than 50% of the vote, more than 60% for constitutional bills. The Prince convenes a session of the Princely Council. It can issue so-called Princely decrees, which must comply with the legal system of the country, i.e. they are sub-statutory regulations.\n\nLaw and courts\n\nThe Principality of Carnovia is unitary state, with a civil law system based on the continental type, rooted in Germanic legal culture. The basis of the legal system is the Constitution of the Principality of Carnovia adopted in 2021, which can be found in Collection of regulations of Carnovia Principality, this collection gives an overview of all active regulations issued by Princely Council, Government, Prince and Districts to citizens, but also tourists, to know how to behave and abide valid laws in Carnovia. The court system includes district, county, and supreme courts and is divided into civil, criminal, and administrative branches. The Carnovia judiciary has a triumvirate of supreme courts. The Constitutional Court consists of 5 constitutional judges and oversees violations of the Constitution by either the legislature or by the government. The Supreme Court is formed of 20 judges and is the court of highest appeal for most legal cases heard in the Carnovia. The Supreme Administrative Court decides on issues of procedural and administrative propriety. It also has jurisdiction over certain political matters, such as the formation and closure of political parties, jurisdictional boundaries between government entities, and the eligibility of persons to stand for public office.\n\nPolitical parties\n\nPolitical parties are allowed. Each political party runs at the expense of state resources, and the campaign is therefore run by a state initiative, where, all conditions being met, political parties or individuals are provided with campaign funds. The own-initiative campaign is severely restricted on the grounds that every idea and agenda should be equal, regardless of whether they are a party of government or a non-parliamentary party.\n\nParty Logo Chair Political position Ideology Government x opposition Seats in parliament KLKD\n\nCarnovian Christian Democratic League Peter I of Carnovia Centre-left Christian democracy, Social democracy, Monarchism Government\n\n20 / 20\n\nEconomy\n\nMain articles: Carnovian koruna and Carnovian National Bank\n\nThe Principality of Carnovia is currently developing its own currency Carnovian koruna, which will be printed by National bank with help of Postage service as they print valuable papers.
