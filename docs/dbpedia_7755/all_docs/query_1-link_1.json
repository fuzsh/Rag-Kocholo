        "text": "His parents were John II \"the Iron\" and his wife Helen of Lithuania, a niece of King Jogaila of Poland. Wenceslaus fought together with his father and other Silesian princes on the Polish side against the Teutonic Knights in the Hunger War in 1414.\n\nAlthough Wenceslaus and his older brother Nicholas V were probably already adults when their father died in 1424, their mother, Helen of Lithuania, acted as regent until 1428. From 1428 to 1449, she styled herself as Lady of Pleß; presumably Pleß was her Wittum. From 1428 to 1437, Wenceslaus and Nicholas V ruled their territory jointly. In 1437, it was divided, with Wenceslaus taking Ratibor and Nicholas taking Duchy of Krnov, Bruntál, Rybnik, Pleß and Baborów.\n\nIn late 1437, a majority of the Bohemian Estates elected Albert II from the House of Habsburg as the new King of Bohemia. A minority favoured his eleven-year-old rival Casimir, the son of King Jogaila of Poland. In 1438, Poland invaded Silesia and devastated the Duchies of Opole and Ratibor. After this, Duke Wenceslaus of Ratibor, as well as Duke Wenceslaus I of Zator and his brothers Duke Przemysław of Toszek and Duke Jan IV of Oświęcim, were willing to accept Casimir as King, under certain conditions. Nevertheless, all Silesian Dukes paid homage to Albert II in Wrocław in November 1438.[2]\n\nAfter Nicholas V died in 1452, Wenceslaus took up the guardianship over his underage sons John IV \"the Elder\" and Wenceslaus III, jointly with their step-mother, Barbara Rockenberg, until 1464. From 1452 to 1462, she styled herself Lady of Pleß; presumably Pleß was her Wittum."
