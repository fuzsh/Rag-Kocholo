        "text": "From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nThePřemyslids (Czech:Přemyslovci,German:Premysliden,Polish:Przemyślidzi), were a Bohemian (Czech) royal dynasty which reigned inBohemia andMoravia (9th century1306), and partly also inHungary,Silesia,Austria andPoland. Subsequently, the rulingHouse of Luxembourg (1310 - 1437) claimed title to the crown of Bohemia through relation to Přemyslids. TheHouse of Habsburg (ruling 1526 - 1918) claimed title to the crown from its relation to all previously ruling houses, including the House of Přemysl.\n\nContents\n\n[hide]\n\n·1The origins and growth of Přemyslid Dynasty\n\n·2At the height of its power\n\n·3Legendary rulers\n\n·4Dukes of Bohemia\n\n·5Kings of Bohemia\n\n·6Kings of Bohemia, Poland and Hungary, rulers of Austria\n\n·7Dukes of Opava, Krnov, Ratibor and Münsterberg\n\n·8Legacy\n\n·9Family tree\n\n·10Family tree of Elisabeth of Bohemia and Jagiellonians and Habsburgs\n\n·11References\n\n·12See also\n\n·13External links\n\nDynasty beginnings date back to the 9th century[1] when Přemyslids ruled a tiny principality aroundPrague and gradually conquered the region ofBohemia, conveniently located in the Bohemian basin where it was not threatened by expansion of theFrankish Empire. The first historically-documented Premyslid Duke wasBořivoj I (867).[1] In the following century, Přemyslids also ruled over Silesia and founded the city ofWroclaw (German: Breslau), derived from the name of a Bohemian dukeVratislaus I, father ofSaint Wenceslaus. Under reign PrinceBoleslaus I cruel (935) and his sonBoleslaus II the Pious (972), the Přemyslids ruled territory stretching to today's Belarus.[1] They controlled important trade routes. In this time Czech Lands and Prague was an important seat for trading where merchants from all of Europe settled, including many Jews, as recalled in 965 by the Hispano-Jewish merchant and traveller Ibrahim ibn Ya'qub. He Wrote \"Prague is a city from the stone, the richest of all states north of the Alps.\" After their prominent rise, however, internal struggles within the family began a decline in power, and, in 1002, the Polish kingBoleslaus the Valiant occupied Prague.[1]Boleslav III, son of Boleslav II, escape from the Bohemia and this is the start of decades of confusion and anarchy.\n\nThe decline ended during the reign of PrinceBretislaus I. He in turn lootedPoland, including the cities ofKrakow and Gniezno (1038), where he obtained the relics ofSt. Adalbert. He sought establishment of the Prague archbishopric and a royal title. His son and successorVratislaus II became the first King of Bohemia (1085).\n\nVratislav's sonSobeslaus I destroyed the Imperial army of KingLothar III in theBattle of Chlumec (1126). This allowed for a further strengthening of Bohemia with a culmination during the reign of Vratislav's nephew, KingVladislaus II (1158). Vladislav II founded many monasteries and built the first stone bridge across theVltava. But then internal struggles again started the decline of the Přemyslids. Many different leaders from the dynasty alternated on the Bohemian throne, leading to the eventual bankruptcy. Upon his rise to the throne,Ottokar I began a series of changes that brought Bohemia out of crisis, and began a period of success[1] that lasted for nearly 220 years.\n\nMember of the Přemyslids dynasty: King Wenceslaus II. Drawing byJan Matejko\n\nOttokar I was elected as king in the year 1198 and was awarded a hereditary royal title. Thus began a significant growth of the Přemyslids dynastic power. Ottokar's son KingWenceslaus I annexed Austria to Bohemia (1236). There was also a large urban and crafts development.\n\nBy the end of the 13th century, the Přemyslids were one of the most powerful dynasties in Central Europe.[2] KingPřemysl Ottokar II, son of Wenceslas I, earned the nickname \"Iron and Golden King\" because of his military power and wealth.[1] After several victorious wars with the Hungarian Kingdom, he acquired Austria,Styria, Carinthia andCarniola, thus spreading the Bohemian territory to theAdriatic Sea. They were so powerful that King Ottokar II aspired to the imperial crown of theHoly Roman Empire. These aspirations started the conflict with House of Habsburg, who were, until then, little-known princes. Their representative Rudolf was elected as King of Romans. Ottokar II fought Rudolph in several wars. In the Battle of Marchfeld (1278), Ottokar clashed with Imperial and Hungarian armies. In addition, he was faced with the treachery of the Bohemian nobility. He was killed in battle[1] and the Habsburgs acquired Austria, retaining it until the 20th century.\n\nHis son, KingWenceslaus II come to Czech throne in year 1283. Over time, thanks to deft diplomacy, he gained the Polish crown for himself and the crown of Hungary for his son.[1] Wenceslas II formed a vast empire stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Danube river and established numerous cities, such asPlzeň in 1295. Bohemia became a wealthy nation due to a large vein of silver discovered under Wenceslaus II.[1] He created the penny of Prague,[1] which was an important European currency for centuries, and planned to build the first university in Central Europe. The power and wealth of theKingdom of Bohemia gave rise to great respect, but also to hostility of European royal families.\n\nThe dynasty began to collapse following after the untimely death of Wenceslaus II (1305), and the assassination of his only son,Wenceslaus III in 1306, which brought about the end to their rule.[1][2] On the distaff side, however, the dynasty continued, and in 1355, Bohemian kingCharles IV, the grandson of Wenceslaus II, was crownedHoly Roman Emperor in Rome.\n\nThe name of the dynasty, according toCosmas in hisChronica Boemorum (1119), comes from its legendary founder,Přemysl, husband ofLibue.[3]\n\n·Přemysl andLibue\n\n·Nezamysl\n\n·Mnata\n\n·Vojen\n\n·Vnislav\n\n·Křesomysl\n\n·Neklan\n\n·Hostivít\n\nThe first historical Přemyslid was DukeBořivoj I, baptised in 874 bySaint Methodius. In 895, Bohemia gained independence fromGreat Moravia. Between 1003 and 1004, Bohemia was controlled byBoleslaus the Brave, Duke ofPoland from thePiast dynasty, grandson ofBoleslaus I the Cruel.\n\nIn 1085, DukeVratislaus II, and, in 1158, DukeVladislaus II, were crownedKing of Bohemia as a personal award from theHoly Roman Emperor. The title, however, was not hereditary.\n\n·Bořivoj I (c.870889)\n\n·Spytihněv I (895915)\n\n·Vratislaus I (915921)\n\n·Saint Wenceslaus (Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia) (921935)\n\n·Boleslaus I the Cruel (935972)\n\n·Boleslaus II the Pious (972999)\n\n·Boleslaus III the Red-haired (9991002)\n\n·Vladivoj (10021003)\n\n·Boleslaus III (1003)\n\n·Jaromír (10041012)\n\n·Ulrich (10121033)\n\n·Jaromír (10331034)\n\n·Ulrich (1034)\n\n·Bretislaus I (10351055)\n\n·Spytihněv II (10551061)\n\n·Vratislaus II (10611092),king (10851092) as Vratislav I.\n\n·Conrad I of Brno (1092)\n\n·Bretislaus II (10921100)\n\n·Bořivoj II (11011107)\n\n·Svatopluk (11071109)\n\n·Vladislaus I (11091117)\n\n·Bořivoj II (11171120)\n\n·Vladislaus I (11201125)\n\n·Sobeslaus I (11251140)\n\n·Vladislaus II (11401172),king (11581172) as Vladislaus I\n\n·Frederick (11721173)\n\n·Sobeslaus II (11731178)\n\n·Frederick (11781189)\n\n·Conrad II Otto (11891191)\n\n·Wenceslaus II (11911192)\n\n·Ottokar I (11921193)\n\n·Henry Bretislaus (11931197)\n\n·Vladislaus Henr) (1197)\n\n·Ottokar I (11971198)\n\nMaximum extent of the kingdom under Ottokar II,\n\nc. 1276\n\nBohemia was the only princedom in theHoly Roman Empire which was raised to the status of kingdom prior to theNapoleonic wars. The reason for this was strength: as soon as Bohemia overcame its civil strife, the Czech duke became the principal ally for any candidate for the Imperial throne. The emperor could, thus, use Bohemian forces to punish any rebels who were Czech neighbours simply by raiding their lands. This is evinced by the establishment, by the Holy Roman EmperorHenry IV, of PrinceVratislaus II of Bohemia as the first king of Bohemia, Vratislav I, in 1085. He was raised to this prominent position not very long after his fatherBretislaus pacified Bohemia after years of civil conflict. The kingship was disputed whenever Czech internal conflict increased. It was fixed, however, after the position of the emperor in Germany weakened.\n\nIn 1198, DukeOttokar I again gained the title of King of Bohemia as an ally ofPhilip of Swabia. This title was reconfirmed byOtto IV, Holy Roman Emperor and later on inFrederick II, Holy Roman Emperor'sGolden Bull of Sicily(1212).\n\n·Ottokar I (11981230)\n\n·Wenceslaus I (12301253)\n\n·Ottokar II (12531278)\n\n·Wenceslaus II (12781305)\n\n·Wenceslaus III (13051306)\n\nTerritory under the control of the Přemyslids, c. 1301:\n\nKingdom of Bohemia\n\nKingdom of Poland\n\nProbable extent of territory under control of Wenceslaus III in Hungary\n\nVassals\n\nIn 1269-1276, KingOttokar II of Bohemia was the first in history to rule the lands of today's Austria together (except forTyrol). He also founded theHofburg Palace in Vienna.\n\nIn 1300, KingWenceslaus II was crownedKing of Poland. Prior to this, he held the title \"High Duke of Poland (Duke of Kraków)\" since 1291 and became its overlord upon the death ofPrzemysł II of Poland in 1296.\n\n·Wenceslaus I (13001305)\n\n·Wenceslaus II (13051306), alsoKing of Hungary (13011305) as Ladislaus V\n\nThe royal line ended in 1306, with the death of KingWenceslaus III. The Bohemian throne went to theLuxembourgs, and the Polish returned to thePiasts.\n\nIn 1269,Nicholas, bastard son of King Ottokar II who was legitimized by popeAlexander IV in 1260, becameduke of Opava. In 1337, his sonNicholas II inheritedDuchy of Ratibor. His four sons divided the Duchy of Opava (Duchy of Ratibor was inherited only by oldestJohn). Thus started the partition of once unified land between the descendants of Nicholas II. In 1443William, Duke of Opava gained theDuchy of Münsterberg, which was held by Přemyslids to 1456. This line of Opavian Přemyslids ended in 1521, with the death ofValentine, Duke of Ratibor.\n\nTerritorial efforts of the Přemyslid kings (all arranged or supported by marriage) were not made without purpose. They were predecessors to similar later efforts of theHouse of Luxemburg,Jagiellon dynasty and finally theHouse of Habsburg. All of them wanted to create a permanent powerbase enabling to rule Germany without really doing so (Luxemburgs, Habsburgs) or at least dominate its closer parts, and to defend the eastern border of the Empire from invasions coming from time to time from the east. It were the Habsburgs, who in the end (1526) succeeded, but it is not a big surprise, that the Czech Estates willingly consented, as it was the most reasonable alternative, especially in the view of ongoing wars with Turks dating from the time ofSigismund of Luxemburg.\n\nIt is interesting to note, that the only Czech king, who could not personally follow such aims through dynastical bonds,George of Poděbrady, who was deemed heretic by pope and therefore could not hope for his sons to inherit the throne, tried to achieve it by a purely political projectTractatus pacis, of course unsuccessfully. Certainly it would be anachronical to state, that the Přemyslids tried to establishAustrian Empire, but still they did quite enough to unite all the lands within its later borders. Whether it means, that traditional Czech policy is support of European integration, is perhaps not purely historical question, but rather that of personal judgment made today.\n\nFamily Tree of the Premyslid Dukes and Kings of Bohemia\n\nBořivoj I. + Saint Ludmila\n\n·Spytihněv I\n\n·Vratislav I\n\n·Saint Václav I\n\n·Boleslav I the Cruel\n\n·Boleslav II the Pious\n\n·Boleslav III the Red-haired\n\n·Jaromír the Eunuch\n\n·Václav the Infantdead\n\n·Oldřich\n\n·Břetislav I Achilles\n\n·Spytihněv II\n\n·Vratislav II\n\n·Břetislav II\n\n·Judith of Bohemia, mother ofBoleslaus III of Poland\n\n·Bořivoj II\n\n·Vladislav I\n\n·Vladislav II\n\n·Bedřich\n\n·Ottokar I\n\n·Wenceslas I\n\n·Ottokar II the Golden and Iron\n\n·Wenceslas II\n\n·Wenceslas III d. 1306 as last male member of the royal Přemyslid dynasty\n\n·Anne of Bohemia (12901313)\n\n·Elisabeth of Bohemia (12921330) last member of the royal Přemyslid dynasty\n\n·Nicholas I of Opavia started line of Dukes of Opava; died out in 1521\n\n·Queen Dagmar of Dennmark, mother ofValdemar the Young\n\n·Vladislav III Henry\n\n·Henry\n\n·Břetislav III Henry (Henry Bretislav)\n\n·Soběslav I\n\n·Soběslav II. the Peasant\n\n·Wenceslas II\n\n·Bishop Jaromír\n\n·Konrád I of Brno and Znojmo (Conradian)\n\n·Konrád of Brno (Conradian, earlier Duke ofMoravia)\n\n·Litolt of Znojmo (Conradian, earlier Duke ofMoravia)\n\n·Oldřich of Brno (Cobradian, Duke of Moravia, part of Brno)\n\n·Konrád of Znojmo (Conradian, erlier Duke ofMoravia)\n\n·Konrád II Ota of Brno and Znojmo (Conradian)\n\n·Otto of Olomouc\n\n·Otto II the Black\n\n·Svatopluk\n\n·Abbess Mlada\n\n·Dobrava m.
