Advance or check weapons and spell skills.\n\n#force\n\nExtended command. To force a lock, for example on a box or chest. Forcing with an edged weapon has a chance of breaking the weapon. Forcing with a blunt weapon has a chance of breaking the box or items in it. Scrolls tear, potions shatter, and crystal items break. Yes, you can break artifact weapons this way. Just ask lorephus. Cursed weapons will never break when used to #force. Attempting to #force with nothing to force gives \"You decide not to force the issue.\"\n\n#invoke\n\nExtended command. Invoke an object's special powers. Only quest artifacts have invokable powers. Invoking before the timeout expires adds 3d10 more turns. You'll still get blasted, if applicable. Successful invocation sets the timeout to rnz(100) turns. You can get within less than a turn of the optimal strategy by trying to #invoke once every 78 turns.\n\n#jump\n\nExtended command. Jump to another location. You'll either need spell of jumping, jumping boots, or you need to be a knight. You may not jump (except by magic) while burdened or worse. You must be able to see the target square. When a Knight uses her jumping ability, the target must be a chess-knight-move away (e.g. 2 north and 1 west). For magical jumping, the target must be <= 3 squares away\n\n#loot\n\nExtended command. Loot a container on the floor beneath you, or the non-cursed saddle from a steed standing next to you. You must be Strained or below to #loot.\n\n#monster\n\nExtended command. Use a monster's special ability (when polymorphed into monster form).\n\n#name\n\nExtended command. Name an item or type of object. When you use #name, it will ask you a yes or no question. Answering yes will allow you to name an individual/stack of items (useful for saying this is cursed), while answering no will allow you to call the class of items (useful for saying this is a scroll of light) see {name}\n\n#nethack\n\nA channel for players on nethack.alt.org to chat to each-other, gloat, ask for help, or just have a 220-man idle party. :) Not a channel for people trying to locate hard to find information that does not pertain to roguelikes, also not a cover for a hacker team.

In order to offer something, you have to be able to touch it, so don't offer footrice corpses without gloves. Also known as 'saccing'. Some bad things to offer unless you're sure you know what you're doing include: a former pet (angers your god), a coaligned unicorn, a corpse of your own race.\n\n#paxedtest:!test\n\n$CHOICE(a|||)\n\n#pray\n\nExtended command.

Praying spoiler: <[http://www.steelypips.org]\n\n#quit\n\nExtended command. Quit the program without saving your game. You don't need to use this, you'll die soon anyway. \"Winners never quit, and quitters never win\" is one of the false rumors. Instead of using this command, try using 'S', to save your game.\n\n#ride\n\nExtended command. Ride (or dismount) a monster.\n\n#rub\n\nExtended command. Rub a lamp or a stone.\n\n#sit\n\nExtended command. Sit down. Don't sit on altars! To lay an egg, polymorph yourself into a female of an egg-laying species, and #sit on the ground. See also throne. Sit on a trap to activate it. Useful for magic traps if you want karma and battle, and levelporters if you forgot to remove your magic resistance.\n\n#turn\n\nExtended command, turn undead. Priests and Knights can call upon their deity to turn undead, which will destroy or frighten nearby Z, M, W, L, V, ghosts, shades and vampire bats. For chaotics, #turn will not destroy, but pacify. The damage to the undead is dealt immediately, but you will be inactive for a total of five turns. Be careful! You cannot #turn in Gehennom: \"Since you are in Gehennom, $DEITY won't help you.\" Nothing happens (no angry gods, no turns taken, etc.), except your atheist conduct is broken. You cannot #turn as undead or a demon, unless you are chaotic. The range is between 5 and 11 squares (based on experience level).\n\n#twoweapon\n\nsee {twoweapon}\n\n#untrap\n\nExtended command. Untrap a trap, door, or a chest. #untrap a trapped monster to possibly turn it peaceful or tame.\n\n#updatestatus\n\nsee {botl_updates}\n\n#version\n\nExtended command. Print compile time options for this version of NetHack.\n\n#wipe\n\nExtended command. Wipe off your face.

Non-uniques include water demons, horned devils, succubi, incubi, erinyes, barbed devils, mariliths, vrocks, hezrous, bone|ice devils, nalfeshnee, pit fiends, balrogs, djinni and sandestin. Also, equally nasty: mail daemons. Monster: '&' Several unique monsters. Asmodeus, Juiblex, Orcus, and Baalzebub, Death, Famine, and Pestilence are guarenteed to be in each game (if you make it far enough) while Yeenoghu, Geryon, Dispater, and Demogorgon are not.\n\n'\n\nMonster: ''' A straw, paper, rope, gold, leather, wood, flesh, clay, stone, glass or iron golem.

Command: '+' List the spells you know and rearrange them if you want.\n\n+2\n\nsee {+2_or_+3}\n\n+2 or +3\n\nThe short answer: It depends. You have 60% chance of getting +3, and 80% chance of getting +2. If you are wishing for something where the special properties of the item itself are worth more than the + (silver or grey dragon scale mail, for example), then go with +3. If you are wishing for something where the + is the whole point of the thing (gauntlets of dexterity or a helm of brilliance), you should go with +2. The pure math says that +3 will come out slightly ahead in the long run, but there is no \"long run\" in NetHack, just a series of individual events. Beyond this, you must make your own decision.\n\n+2 vs +3\n\nsee {+2_or_+3}\n\n+3\n\nsee {+2_or_+3}\n\n,\n\nCommand: ',' Pick up items from the floor.\n\n-\n\nDungeon feature: '-' A wall of a room.\n\n.\n\nDirection: '.'

Basically it involves reading numerous scrolls of earth in a shop, then polymorphing into a giant and picking them up. Unfortunately, you then find yourself unable to pick up anything else (other than more boulders), and attempting to drop the boulders can cause a segmentation fault. Also see {200_rock_steal}\n\n200 meatball steal\n\nsee {200_rock_steal}\n\n200 meatballs\n\nsee {200_rocks}\n\n200 rock steal\n\nThe maximum number of items you can be charged for in a shop is 200. Anything you pick up after that you get for free. If you can find 200 rocks and name then each a different thing so they don't stack, and place them in a Bag of Holding to reduce weight, you can then throw it into a shop, and once you pick it back up eveything else you pick up is free. You can then easily sell the expensive items back to the shopkeeper repeatedly [no pet-steal necesary] to bleed him dry of cash, and build up enough credit for the price of the bag and rocks.

If you have a surplus of speed, gain energy or gain level potions, you can dip that surplus into the healing or extra healing potion instead, to convert that surplus into the better healing potion. Also, enlightenment into levitation (or vice versa) has a 2/3 chance of becoming gain level, to further your alchemy with. If you have (for example) two stacks of healing, one diluted, then to save a potion of speed, you can dilute the undiluted one with water, so that the potions are now in one stack, and can be dipped in one potion.

Their attacks are 4d10 + 1d4 + clerical spellcasting. If you want to kill an aligned priest, you'd best do it at a distance, or if you really must melee him, converting the altar will get rid of the attacks from that god's wrath, while failed conversions don't anger the priest at all.

Eaten: aligned priest Nutr: 400 Effects: Human\n\nalignment\n\n\"Alignment\" refers to your standing with your god. Its initial value is 0 for character classes CPTVW, and 10 for character classes ABHKMRoRaS. Its maximum value starts at 10 and is increased by 1 every 200 turns (so at T:199, max align is 10, at T:200 max align is 11). Since alignment is a signed 32-bit integer, the minimum alignment is -2,147,483,648. There seems to be some over/underflow protection (so you can't have +2bil alignment). The exact formula for maximum alignment is (10+turns/200). In the spoilers, this number is called L. For example, killing your quest leader sets your alignment to -L/2. To do the quest you must have align >= 20, which means you absolutely cannot possibly do the quest before turn 2000, no matter how many wraith corpses you eat or !oGL you quaff.

If you sacrifice on a noncoaligned altar with positive alignment, there's a chance (yourLevel+2)/(yourLevel+8) you'll convert the altar to be coaligned, but if you have a negative alignment, there's a chance your alignment will change (making the game unwinnable if done before the Quest). See [http://www.steelypips.org] for complete praying spoiler. Attempting to engrave or sit on top of one is a good way to get a -1 luck penalty, or a -1 wisdom penalty if the altar is co-aligned. Luck has no effect on your chances of converting an altar, but it will affect your chances of being confronted by a minion of the god of the altar you converted (or tried to). If your alignment is negative when you try to convert an altar, you will be converted to the altar's god instead. Failing to convert an altar incurs a -1 luck penalty. Being converted to the altar's god incurs a -3 luck penalty. Kicking an altar is also a bad idea. conversion chances (XL+2)/(XL+8).

You apply (that is, break) unknown wands to determine what they are. It's like engrave testing but for pros only. Remember that you have to be strong enough to actually break the wand (a common problem for new wizards); you need at least 10 str. Also, be wary that every uncharged wand will give \"But nothing else happens...\" so apply-test them before you are tempted to zap their charges away. Applying a wand of magic missile will give \"You are caught in the magical blast!\" and you take some damage unless you have MR. Applying a wand of striking gives \"A wall of force smashes down around you!\" Wands of fire, lightning, and cold create a ball of <element>. Great for the Fourth of July. Applying a wand of digging is useful even to normies: it creates pits and holes on each square adjacent to you and under you. Wands of teleport, sleep, cancellation, polymorph, make invisible, speed monster, and slow monster all create a magical blast, then act as if you zapped yourself and every adjacent square with the wand. So that minotaur will become fast, neat! Applying a wand of undead turning will blast you magically (as usual) and then as an added bonus you shudder in dread. You also get the normal undead turning effect (so your lizard corpse revives). Applying a wand of light will blind you, but it'll also act as if you zapped it. The following wands give \"But nothing else happens...\": nothing, enlightenment, wishing, probing, opening, locking, and secret door detection. The last three have no effect even when standing adjacent to a (closed, open, secret) door. Applying a wand of death will give \"You are caught in the death field!\" This will not automatically kill you (even if you are MRless), but it does quite a lot of damage, so watch out! Applying a wand of create monster will summon a substantial horde even if the wand is at (0:1).\n\napport\n\nA measure of how well a pet is trained to fetch.

They have AC -78, MR100, and have intrinsic reflection. They are capable of casting the Groping of Death. When not Groping, its attacks brings swift retribution unmatched by even the Riders. Along with disenchantment ability, arch-lichens are THE most formidable monsters in the NetHack bestiary. Arch-lichens multiply when hit by any weapon or beam, with the new lichen having twice the HP of the old one. They are also capable of summoning demons and insects. They will teleport next to you, even from a different dungeon level, including ones you haven't visited, when the time is \"appropriate\". Arch-lichens, or Fwagglebrapo in Quenya, are a deadly race of... things. They were first fwapped into creation by the omnipotent RNG for the sole purpose of executing overtly lucky adventurers. In Its omnipotence, however, the RNG discovered that he had made a creature that even He cannot kill. Naturally, it follows that no divine intervention can protect an adventurer from the wrath of an arch-lichen.

The lower it is, the harder it is for an opponent to hit you. Ways to lower your armor class are to wear nondamaged armor with a nonnegative enchantment, buying protection from a priest (for 400*xp_level to 600*xp_level-1 zorkmids), getting protection from your god (by #praying at an altar with high enough luck and telepathy, speed, and stealth), or casting the protection spell. You can also improve your armor class by wearing a ring of protection. Other ways of not getting hit (besides AC) are invisibility and displacement. Armor affects monster's to-hit roll against you - the value of your AC is added to their to-hit roll, unless your AC is less than zero, in which case a random number between 0 and your armor class is added to their to-hit. Further, if your AC is less than zero, a random number between 0 and its magnitude is subtracted from any physical damage dealt. Non-physical attacks still deal normal damage.\n\narmor spoiler\n\nsee {armor}\n\narmor store\n\nArmor stores are run by shopkeepers named: Demirci, Kalecik, Boyabai, Yildizeli, Gaziantep, Siirt, Akhalataki, Tirebolu, Aksaray, Ermenak, Iskenderun, Kadirli, Siverek, Pervari, Malasgirt, Bayburt, Ayancik, Zonguldak, Balya, Tefenni, Artvin, Kars, Makharadze, Malazgirt, Midyat, Birecik, Kirikkale, Alaca, Polatli, and Nallihan.\n\narmor weight\n\nAll DSMs: 40. plate mail: 450. crystal plate mail: 450. bronze plate mail: 450. splint mail: 400. banded mail: 350. dwarvish mithril-coat: 150. elven mithril-coat: 150. chain mail: 300. orcish chain mail: 300. scale mail: 250. studded leather armor: 200. ring mail: 250. orcish ring mail: 250. leather armor: 150. leather jacket: 30. all shirts: 5.\n\narrow\n\nYour basic arrow.

In the main dungeon, black opals usually won't be seen above dungeon level 13.\n\nblack pudding\n\nTheir bite will corrode any iron or bronze armor you are wearing, and they also corrode iron weapons used to attack them. Attacking a black pudding in melee with iron will split it into two puddings, if its hp is at least 2. These are significantly more dangerous than brown puddings, as they have twice as many hitpoints and do 3d8 damage per attack (while brown puddings do not inflict any damage). However, a sufficiently low armor class makes black pudding farming a safe and profitable activity (see 'pudding farming'); plus, they're a lot easier to create than brown puddings. Eating a black pudding corpse may grant you cold resistance, poison resistance, or shock resistance. They qualify as meat. Veggie conduct players beware! Level 10, speed 6, AC 6. 22% chance of granting cold, shock, or poison resistance.
