Theatre is generally acknowledged to be the most social of artistic practices, requiring collectives to both produce and consume it. Theatrical performance’s ability to organize and cohere markers of cultural belonging, difference, and dissonance are the hallmarks of social life. Its production and reception have, however, altered significantly over the past two and a half thousand years. Despite these changes the same chapter headings structure all six volumes: institutional frameworks, social functions, sexuality and gender, environment, circulation, interpretations, communities of production, repertoire and genres, technologies of performance and knowledge transmission. These headings represent significant cultural approaches as opposed to purely regional, national, aesthetic or generic categories. This allows for comparative readings of key cultural questions affecting theatre both diachronically and synchronically. The six volumes divide the history of theatre as follows: Volume 1: A Cultural History of Theatre in Antiquity (500 BC –1000 AD ) Volume 2: A Cultural History of Theatre in the Middle Ages (1000–1400) Volume 3: A Cultural History of Theatre in the Early Modern Age (1400–1650) Volume 4: A Cultural History of Theatre in the Age of Enlightenment (1650–1800) Volume 5: A Cultural History of Theatre in the Age of Empire (1800–1920) Volume 6: A Cultural History of Theatre in the Modern Age (1920–2000+) Christopher B.

Davis, General Editors\n\nxv\n\nEDITOR’S ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nIf cultural history accords particular importance to the social production of knowledge, this book is the result of many people thinking together. Thanks to Mark Dudgeon at Bloomsbury for a large-scale vision that did not preclude attention to the smallest details, and to Emily Hockley and Susan Furber for their quick assistance with logistical and technical issues, especially regarding images.

The socio-economically heterodox nature of theatre and performance between 1400 and 1650 causes us to interrogate the complex concept of ‘culture’ in both its wide, Gramscian meaning of the ordinary, everyday process of finding shared meaning and values1 and the alternative meaning of the creative work of discovery in artistic and intellectual endeavours.2 Despite the fact that studies devoted to the early modern period have crucially shaped the field of cultural history from the nineteenth century to the present, from Burckhardt’s sweeping study of Renaissance Italy3 to Carlo Ginzburg’s microhistory of a sixteenth-century miller,4 theatre histories of the early modern period have generally been slow to incorporate the insights of cultural history.5 It is true that studies of early modern theatre associated with new historicism have amply drawn from cultural history and the general ‘anthropological turn’ in studies of culture, but the work of such scholars as Stephen Greenblatt, Steven Mullaney, Louis Montrose and others has mostly focused on English early modern theatre. To be sure, our understanding of the transvestite boy actor in England has been completely transformed by new historicism and cultural historical studies of sexuality and gender. But any serious inquiry into the ten cultural questions framing the chapters of this and the other five volumes of A Cultural History of Theatre must be transnational. As Eric Nicholson does in Chapter 3, the English boy actor should be studied alongside one of the great theatrical events of the day, the emergence of international commedia dell’arte diva-actresses such as Isabella Andreini, and\n\n1\n\n2\n\nA CULTURAL HISTORY OF THEATRE IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE\n\nthe vexed but productive actresses in Spain and France. Transnational theatre history must examine both social and cultural phenomena that do not respect borders, such as the spike in poverty and the massive changes wrought by the printing press, even as it contrasts crucial differences between theatres of various geo-linguistic areas: both those of emerging nations (England, Spain, France) and those of pre-national regions such as Italy and Germany. As Stefan Hulfeld demonstrates in his chapter on ‘Ideology’ in the present volume and as the Parisbased research group La Haine du Théâtre6 has been demonstrating, attacks and defences on the theatre ran in remarkably parallel directions across early modern Europe: parallels all the more interesting for emphasizing differences as well. What we offer in these pages is a transnational cultural analysis of early modern European theatre through the cultural prisms of institutional frameworks, social functions, sexuality and gender, the environment of theatre, circulation, ideology, communities of production, genres and repertoires, technology, and knowledge transmission. In examining the quintessentially social cultural production and consumption of the ‘art’ of theatre, we find particularly useful the approach of the British Marxist critic Raymond Williams. Williams’ emphasis on the social dimension of ‘culture’ and the concept’s capacity to embrace both creative works of art and ordinary ways of viewing and experiencing the world provides a particularly fruitful approach to early modern theatre and performance.7 As Robert Henke and Tom Bishop show in their discussion of ‘Institutional Frameworks’, early modern theatre combined the elite culture of humanism, the academy, and the court with the ordinary culture of piazza performance, seasonal ritual, and public performance: it included the piazza mountebank and the royal entry, the paratheatrical and the theatrical. As a ‘cultural materialist’, Williams firmly grounds his concept of culture in tangible material and social life. At the same time, in his view, culture is not simplistically determined by economic substructure, but is the product of free human agency and creativity: a freedom that occurs on the social as well as individual level.8 As an alternative to the deterministically connoted term ‘ideology’, Williams prefers ‘structures of feeling’ in order to account for the process-oriented, dynamic, changing, and flexible nature of social postures and practices.9 He ascribes particular importance to ‘residual’ and ‘emergent’ attitudes, beliefs, tonalities that complicate ‘dominant’ societal attitudes and postures – particularly important for examining phenomena, as we will do in this volume, of longue durée.10 Theatre between 1400 and 1650 absorbed, questioned, complicated, and anticipated residual, dominant and emergent social structures of feeling. It could be residually neo-feudal even as bourgeois, capitalist forms and attitudes emerged. Strong absolutist patronage did not prevent the rebellious Earl of Leicester from enlisting the Lord Chamberlain’s Men to stage Shakespeare’s Richard II , including the deposition scene. Ideological supporters of draconian\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nnew poor laws designed to discipline the poor could momentarily feel and imagine, in the two hours’ traffic of the stage, that they perhaps had ‘ta’en too little care’ of the ravages of economic inequality. In the fractious post-Reformation era, theatre could complicate and challenge ostensible confessional loyalties, as residually Catholic ideas – such as the domain of purgatory – could be evoked in image and feeling. Early modern theatre represented both dominant ideologies and the ‘hints and half-guesses’ of the vestigial past and the anticipatory future. As Henke and Bishop demonstrate in Chapter 1 and Karen Newman in Chapter 4, the institutional frameworks and playing spaces of theatre itself in the early modern period were characterized both by innovation and longue durée: the age saw both the emergence of purpose-built theatres across Europe, as Newman shows, and the dogged persistence of religious drama and its urban, processional staging. Certainly what counted as legitimate knowledge of the theatre worthy of being passed on from one generation to the next was sharply contested so that vestigial and dominant could even become relative terms, as Ellen MacKay demonstrates in her discussion of the Querelle du Cid and other topics in Chapter 10. Williams’ social approach parallels the work of Annales-based French cultural history that emphasizes collective ‘mentalities’ or discourses in periods of history. Just as anthropologists ask in their objects of study, a history of mentalités examines the collective comportments, sensibilities, imaginations, gestures, beliefs and habits of mind that produce symbolic webs of meaning for the culture that both creates and consumes them.11 In considering how theatre was perceived, conceived and used in the period, a cultural history of the theatre can consider the ‘mental equipment’ (‘l’outillage mental’, in Lucien Febvre’s words12) that filtered theatrical and performance-conceived experience and discourse. How were ideas, absorbed through theatre and performance, ‘good to think with’ for the people of the time? Ideas of the ‘scene’, the ‘player’, the ‘tragic and ‘comic’, etc. pervade the cultural imagination of the period, and not just among the elite: the world as a stage, theatrical self-fashioning, the existential ramifications of fertility-generating comedy and death-terminating tragedy, the ethical and even ontological questions posed by fictional representation that were addressed by both antitheatricalists and defenders of the theatre. In a theatrical period that witnessed the first professional actress in Italy, the emergence of the transvestite boy player as a powerful cultural force, and the intermittent licensing and prohibition of female players in Spain, changing ideas about gender and sexual personae were crucially mediated on the stage. (See Nicholson in Chapter 3.) Early modern theatre and performance interrogated culture as much as they reflected it. Just as Erika Lin in Chapter 2 explores the ways that early modern theatre spectators felt and thought, and William West in Chapter 7 explores what it meant to produce theatre at different stages in one’s life, we may generally ask what did\n\n4\n\nA CULTURAL HISTORY OF THEATRE IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE\n\nearly modern theatre mean – and how did it mean – for the people who both consumed and produced it. If the ancient and medieval volumes in this series have certainly shown how irrevocably social the production and consumption of theatre was in the period preceding ours, our temporal purview will see new social conditions and economic means of production coming to bear. The age generated new urban, early-capitalistic modes of production and organization that made sustained, organized professional theatre possible for the first time in Western history. Italy was both the birthplace of Western capitalism and the crucible of the professional actor (even as the early modern professional actor, across Europe, oddly straddled neo-feudal and proto-capitalist modes). Architects, entrepreneurs and actors created new kinds of purpose-built playing spaces, some of which accommodated distinctly mixed-class audiences (the English amphitheatres, the Spanish corrales). At the same time, the sixteenth century witnessed both the birth of the national state and new absolutist ideologies spanning both states and petty duchies. For the first time we can talk about the ‘drama of a nation’ in England and Spain.13 The social conditions of theatre were being reconceived and reworked at the bottom, middle and top. The dominant socio-economic crisis of the period – the sharp spike in poverty and territorial displacement – generated the very ordinary and thoroughly social performance posture of the early modern beggar: a performance that could take place anywhere and any time.14 Producers and consumers of theatre in the early modern period viewed art as social, not individual production. No nineteenth-century notion of the ‘aesthetic’ as a distinct sphere governed the ‘artistic’ productions of our period: the works wrought by early modern playwrights, actors, set designers, theatre architects, costume-makers, accessory fabricators (many of whom were female)15, theatre musicians, and piazza/street performers, and even the new entrepreneurs like Philip Henslowe, were no more considered immaterial objects of aesthetic production (a product reserved for the ‘inner life of man’) than the gold-work issuing from Benvenuto Cellini’s workshop.16 The great commedia dell’arte actor-writer Pier Maria Cecchini, who wrote the first extended actor’s handbook in Western theatre history, advocated that the new professional Italian troupes be socially and economically modelled after the venerable Florentine ‘Arti’ or craft-guilds.17 Despite the looming presence of Shakespeare, who is still difficult to disentangle from the myth of the solitary Bard, early modern playwriting was a social process: over half the plays written in the Elizabethan–Jacobean era were the product of at least two hands, and the on-stage ‘compositions’ (as they were called) of the improvising commedia dell’arte troupes were obviously social products of art. (Shakespeare surely was a social writer himself, co-writing several plays and conceiving plots, dialogue, scene and speech with his fellow\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nactors in mind.) As Friedemann Kreuder demonstrates in his discussion of ‘Repertoire and Genres’ in Chapter 8, the forms and repertoires of early modern theatre were thorpughly social and collaborative, whether performed from script or scenario. Any significant history of early modern theatre will have to illuminate the ‘constitutive social processes’ (Williams) that created and sustained ‘Renaissance theatre’: an example of mass theatrical culture even surpassing in scale and cultural influence the popular, urban Corpus Christi cycles (in fact, the greater part of this ‘late medieval’ phenomenon took place within the historical parameters of our period rather than the previous one, and emerged from similar urban developments that would in turn make the theatres of Hamlet and Arlecchino possible). In short, the present study cannot be a history of great individuals (Shakespeare, Lope de Vega, Corneille) or great theatrical events (the construction of James Burbage’s The Theatre in 1576) but must primarily dwell on social, collective practices of mostly longue durée: residual, dominant, and emergent. If we are taking the social realm seriously, we must extend our purview to the kinds of plays and performances produced by those of modest or low means and destined for those ranging from the middling to the destitute. In this respect, the actor-based Italian professional theatre, which emerged adjacent to the piazza mountebank and despite some notable court success never became completely divorced from this figure, provides just as important a model as the theatres of Shakespeare and Lope. During our period, European cities were flooded with new immigrants, whether forced by changes and pressures in agricultural economies or drawn by new opportunities, and the burgeoning early modern city became a site of continual performance: beggars performing their destitution, mountebanks, ballad singer-sellers, hand-to-mouth performers of infinite variety, mongers of cheap print, merchandise hawkers, street criers, prostitutes on display, prostitutes publicly shamed by carting rituals, public executions, Lord Mayor’s shows, royal entries and progressions, and much, much more. As Clifford Geertz asked of a Balinese cock fight18 and Robert Darnton of an eighteenth-century cat massacre,19 we need to ask what strange public performances that are opaque to us today (e.g., bear baitings) meant to those experiencing, thinking, and feeling them at the time. Any theatre history that hopes to consider what theatrical performance meant to the mass of actual people of the time must also consider the sustained importance, in the post-Reformation age, of religious theatre, which continued unabated despite the triumphs of Shakespeare’s and Lope’s predominantly secular theatres. Considered transnationally, Corpus Christi cycles and Passion plays flourish more in our historical period than in that of the previous volume. The Spanish auto sacramental does not gain sustained institutional traction until the early sixteenth century. The fulminous anti-theatricality of English puritans tends to obscure from our view the fact that continental religious\n\n6\n\nA CULTURAL HISTORY OF THEATRE IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE\n\nreformers, including Melanthon and even Luther, were no enemies of theatre, which was quickly engaged for ideological purposes. Positively dwarfing the international influence of Shakespeare within our temporal confines was the 1539 neo-Latin play Hecastus by the Dutch Humanist Macropedius. This Everyman-type play that was late-medieval in theme but classical in structure was translated into German, Danish, and Swedish, and performed in Nurnberg, Konigsberg, Basel, Prague, Danzig, Nordlingen and Munich between 1549 and 1609 – Weltliteratur for the day, and largely because of its religious appeal.20 Shakespeare was barely known outside of England. On the other hand, the early modern period poses interesting complexities that tilt us back to a notion of culture that includes the products of ‘art and intellect’. In their attack on what they perceived as the narrowness of scholastic inquiry, humanists such as Petrarch and Erasmus elevated the importance of ancient literary works relative to the scholastic domains of logic, theology, and metaphysical philosophy. If perhaps below epic in the hierarchy of genres, the dialogic and social nature of drama generally appealed in humanist circles promoting the conversational style and the capacity, whether in speech or writing, to mix stylistic registers. Erasmus championed Terence to what seems to us today an inordinate degree – he argued that Terence was good to think with, as well as to write with and to talk with – and devoted much time and attention to translating Euripides into Latin. The prestige and influence (radiating from Italy) of Horace’s Ars Poetica and Aristotle’s Poetics placed the classical genres of tragedy and comedy front-and-centre in the new field of literary theory. The dazzling innovations in technology and architecture discussed by Blair Hoxby in Chapter 9 were largely avant-garde, humanist inventions: only a transnational approach such as the one Hoxby takes can demonstrate both Italy’s importance as an innovatory source and the transmission of Italian ideas across geo-linguistic boundaries. Drama acquired a pride of place in the avant-garde Italian literary theory of the 1540s and afterwards that is difficult to imagine in the era of poststructuralism, which has rarely chosen drama for its representative theoretical cases. Theatre could lead the way, from a humanist perspective, in restoring the lustre of classical civilization that had allegedly been so obscured by medieval ignorance. The terms ‘tragedy’ and ‘comedy’, with added value from their classical origins lent them by humanist elites, joined the classical term ‘theatre’, which had garnered added sheen from Poggio Bracciolini’s 1414 rediscovery of Vitruvius’ De architectura in a Swiss monastery and the ensuing humanist dissemination of Vitruvian ideas about ‘theatre’ as an architectural structure rather than a place of playing. James Burbage’s 1576 christening of his new, purpose-built theatrical structure in the Shoreditch district of London as ‘The Theatre’ was meant to confer elite cultural value. Contemporaries lauded ‘Marlowe’s mighty line’ and his heroic overreachers for finally restoring, after two millennia, the tragic buskin to the stage. When Ben Jonson and John Webster complain\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nof the ignorant ‘understanders’ and garlic-reeking ignoramuses that couldn’t understand their lofty, classically formed works of ‘comedy’ and ‘tragedy’, they are asserting, in the humanist tradition, normative ideals of cultural value and hierarchy. They are also implying, in the humanist project launched by Petrarch, that after the dark chasm of the ‘middle ages’ they are advancing something like ‘civilization’ and ‘culture’ (although these are later terms) by disinterring and restoring the glories of the ancient past. For, like Petrarch, humanist playwrights and stage ‘composers’ (the improvising Italian actors were steeped in the humanist tradition as well) identified themselves with a particular moment in history. They passionately believed that they were doing something new, and this awareness constituted a genuine historical shift even by itself. The cultural and historiographical self-consciousness of the university wits, Du Bellay and other Pleiade theorists as they resurrected ancient dramatic ideas, the apologists for the commedia dell’arte actor (and actress) who deemed him (her) the new Roscius of the day – all of these beliefs and postures were meant to mark a moment of historical difference. Especially in the realm of theatre, humanism helped foster across Europe a common, transnational language – and one that reached beyond the elite circles to which humanist literature was normally confined. Just as humanism reached a relatively wider socio-economic ambit (though not without its exclusions) through the school manuals and literary texts disseminated through the printing press, humanist ideas about theatre could move from elite discussions between Italian and German scholars about comic theory to the production of classical comedies to audiences that could include the middle class. Humanism rendered late-fifteenth-century German dramatic theorists comprehensible to Dutch university professors interested in both understanding drama and staging classical plays, and those plays were not only performed before academic audiences. In the early humanist period of the fifteenth century (the beginning of our historical purview), exciting rediscoveries were made of Plautine, Terentian, and Vitruvian texts, and the still common vehicle of Latin enabled the development of a transnational cultural language of theatre that moved from humanist elite to groundlings at London amphitheatres, Spanish corrales, and the French parterre. Moreover, despite the predictable presence of idealist conservatives such as Giason Denores, who argued that the forms of tragedy, comedy, and pastoral were as inviolable and unchanging as Platonic forms, many humanists interested in theatre – such as Denores’ antagonist Battista Guarini in the debate over the non-classical form of tragicomedy – approached dramatic forms as Vico viewed history itself: something made by humans beings for other human beings, and historically conditioned. For Guarini, the generic concepts of tragedy and comedy were not fixed forms but plastic materials, like the stuff of a painter’s palette, matter to be mixed, combined, rearranged, deconstructed in the process\n\n8\n\nA CULTURAL HISTORY OF THEATRE IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE\n\nof composition and reception.21 Polonius’s ‘tragical-comical-historical-pastoral’ bespeaks the same early modern penchant, whether practised by the dramatist in a script or the improvising actor from a scenario, of playing with genre, and theatrical matter in general. Although the elite courtier-academician-professor Guarini wanted to safeguard this combinatory process from the rabble, his essentially social and cultural view of theatre and dramatic genre irrevocably let the cat out of the bag, just as his Platonic opponent Denores feared: no one better executed his theory that dramatic genre and theatrical language (as with any other kind of cultural language) was something shaped by human beings for other human beings than the professional actors whom he despised: the actor-composers of the commedia dell’arte. What Guarini theorized and the commedia dell’arte performed was very like what Bakhtin discussed in his Rabelais book for a much wider socio-economic swath than that viewed from Guarini’s academy:22 not the langue of an disinterested, asocial system but the parole of active, social beings crowded together in the marketplace: the dialogic speech-genres23 that animate the pages of Rabelais, the fifteenthcentury farces that he loved, and the popular culture of carnival, charivari, and the Renaissance fair. As a social and historical creation, the language of early modern theatre – the webs of symbolic meaning spun from the material of theatrical production – may be seen as a ‘system’ but one that was fluid, changing, diachronic and flexible. It was when humanist theatrical ideas found deep socio-economic soil – when the new, otherwise ‘elite’ ideas could be fused with popular, oral life, as in the case of the commedia dell’arte and the theatres of Shakespeare and Lope – that early modern theatre became a powerful and socially consequent cultural phenomenon. Don Quixote found Sancho Panza. *\n\n*\n\n*\n\nThe field of cultural history has been closely intertwined with Renaissance and early modern studies. Furthermore, debates about culture and the nature of cultural historiography have significant implications for the cultural analysis of early modern theatre and performance. Williams has shown how the concept of ‘civilization’ emerged in the eighteenth century to mean an ‘achieved state’ contrasted with ‘barbarism’ but also extended to signify a rational, achieved state of development implying ‘historical process and progress’.24 Insofar as such an ‘achieved state’ in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries quickly became associated with the urban civilizations of England and France, and external qualities such as those of politeness and luxury, the term unsurprisingly encountered resistance, whether from Rousseauian quarters on the basis of a perceived ‘natural’ ethic or from Marxist ranks by virtue of politico-economic analysis. In the nineteenth century, the notion of ‘culture’ emerged in\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\ncounterpoint to ‘civilization’, designating an ‘inner’ or ‘spiritual’ as opposed to ‘external’ development. In contrast to the ‘externalities’ of ‘civilization’, ‘culture’ came to encompass religion, art, and even the family and personal life, referring to the domain of the ‘inner life’: individuality, subjectivity, and generating certain ‘quasi-metaphysical forms’ such as ‘the imagination’, ‘creativity’, ‘inspiration’ and the ‘aesthetic’.25 The problem, of course, was that the domains of art, intellectual life, and religion were fundamentally social, not individual. For Williams, although he stresses that the implications of Marx for cultural history have been insufficiently realized, Marx provided a salutary corrective to the over-subjectivization of ‘culture’, restoring the sense, fundamental and already present in Vico, that culture as well as history is that which human beings make. One of the founding figures of cultural history, or Kulturgeschichte, as an alternative to political history (which sometimes carried with it an implied celebration of the State) was Jacob Burckhardt, whose The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (1860) remains required reading today for early modern scholars. In Burckhardt’s very title, the original ‘Kultur’ (Die Kultur der Renaissance in Italien) that was translated into ‘civilization’ may be seen to reflect the paradoxes Williams discusses. And this raises the perennial historiographical question of whether early modern culture – and early modern theatre and performance by extension – should be seen as a teleological, and more-or-less linear advance. (In the domain of theatre studies, the teleological view should be considered as more than easily dismissible, for it is still tempting and in fact not completely erroneous for historians to tell the story of ragtag piazza culture culminating in the splendid troupes of the Italian commedia dell’arte, itinerant household players reaching the rationalized prosperity of the Lord Chamberlain’s men, and Lope de Rueda’s theatre-from-a-trunk giving way to Lope de Vega.) Certainly Burckhardt, like the Renaissance humanists themselves, saw major cultural advances in the achievements of the Renaissance in the realm of painting, architecture, and literature, while his political analysis of Renaissance despots was less sanguine. Even in regard to ‘culture’, Burckhardt retained some ambivalence, particularly when considering the individualism that he, famously, regarded as the kernel of cultural development in the age. And in his later Reflections on History,26 he explicitly rejected Hegelian progressivism or any other variant of ‘philosophy of history’. If Burckhardt himself was ambivalent about ‘Renaissance culture’, the field of early modern theatre studies has always negotiated, on the one hand, the optimism and sense of teleological completion implicit in the term ‘Renaissance Drama’ and, on the other hand, the sober resonance in theatrical representation of the incipient slavery, patriarchy, suppressive absolutism, early colonialism and nationalist-abetted racism of the age. In his early work on the self-fashioning of the individual, Stephen Greenblatt can be said to follow both Burckhardt’s\n\n10\n\nA CULTURAL HISTORY OF THEATRE IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE\n\npositive and negative assessments of Renaissance individuality; and studies of race, colonialism, gender and absolutism in early modern theatre have severely checked both optimism and teleology. An approach to cultural studies that tended to emphasize continuity rather than change, associated with the French Annales school, was the study of ‘mentalities’. Many Annales-based works were devoted to the medieval and early modern period.27 Consonant with Foucault’s later articulation of the ‘episteme’ – a system of discourse with implicit rules about what can and cannot be spoken – Annales cultural historians such as the medievalist Marc Bloch and the early modern scholar Lucien Febvre studied patterns of thought and discourse of longue durée. Works like Febvre’s on the persistence of religious belief in the century of François Rabelais tended to complicate teleology by identifying long-view patterns of thought and practice of ordinary as well as elite people.28 Drawing from the approaches of anthropology and psychology, Febvre introduced the metaphor of the ‘mental toolbox’ (outillage mental), investigating the mental habits, frames of perception, conceptual horizons, vocabularies and grammars of a given age.29 The study of mentalities could consider myths, beliefs and symbols, but unlike the disembodied and shortlived ‘history of ideas’ approach of Arthur Lovejoy30 (and congruent with Raymond Williams’ cultural materialism) it did not divorce ideas from the material conditions that shaped them: an approach that bodes well for early modern theatre. Like Robert Darnton in his study of the mirth produced by killing cats by eighteenth-century French apprentices, many mentalité scholars tend not to begin with familiar but with weird, uncanny events, beliefs and practices, using them as cruxes to discover something new and important about the given culture, seen not as universal and transparent but as strange and alien.31 In this vein (whether or not explicitly influenced by the mentalité approach) can be seen several studies of the strange practice of the boy actor in English professional theatre, most notably Stephen Orgel’s Impersonations, which begins with the question ‘Why did the English take boys for women?’32 Also emanating from the Annales school was the rigorous, materially based grand opus of Fernand Braudel, which examines collective structures of economic life centred on market and exchange.33 Although interested in phenomena – but in his case practices rather than ideas – of longue durée, Braudel extends both the temporal and geographic span of the ‘early modern’ in ways that the authors of this volume have found fruitful. For those scholars of early modern theatre (like the present authors) wishing to go beyond national boundaries, Braudel’s big-picture, structural analysis of Mediterranean material culture (and other similar studies that have followed in Braudel’s wake) have been relatively untapped, but could prove enormously useful in the future, especially as enhanced by big data digital analysis. Braudel’s analysis of roads, sea routes, river passages, and canal networks linking the ‘Mediterranean\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nworld’ provides the kind of material substructure without which a comprehensive study of English, Italian, German, Spanish, French, Danish, Dutch, and Czech travelling actors (not isolated by the geo-linguistic region usually corresponding to the origin of the scholar herself, but informed by a pan-European picture) would be impossible. If early modern theatre can be seen as a flexible and active system of transnational exchanges, Braudel’s work on the material and social transactions of early modern Mediterranean commerce can illuminate the conditions of early modern theatrical production: not as a crudely ‘Marxist’ substructure rigidly dictating cultural production, but in Williams’ sense (derived from a close reading of Marx’s original German text) of ‘determination’ as the ‘setting of limits and parameters’.34 Of central concern in cultural history, and a major topic in works of cultural history directed to the early modern period, has been the serious investigation of popular culture implicit in Williams’ social understanding of ‘culture’, whether its relationship to learned, print culture is stressed or whether its relative independence is explored. Bakhtin’s study of Rabelais, mentioned above, in which the learned culture of the Erasmian Rabelais may not be sufficiently emphasized, still holds fruitful possibilities for early modern theatre studies, especially when we consider how close Rabelais himself was to the paratheatrical world of farce. No figure has been more important in this domain than Peter Burke, who has also provided significant methodological reflections on the field of cultural history itself.35 Burke’s examinations, in Popular Culture in Early Modern Europe,36 of the linguistic cant of rogues and the talismanic function of written fragments in a still-largely oral culture relate closely to the dynamics of early modern performance, if not organized theatre as well. Probably the greatest impact of cultural history on early modern theatre studies has come through the work of new historicism, which was distinctly influenced by both anthropology and the discourse analysis of Michel Foucault. Thirty years ago, new historicism fruitfully began to look at early modern theatre and performance as collective, social practices deeply integrated into other types of cultural signification. Stephen Greenblatt, Louis Montrose, Steven Mullaney, and other new historicist critics juxtaposed privileged dramatic texts with colonialists’ reports, gynecological treatises, exorcism tracts, witch trials, and much more. Greenblatt’s preferred term for the new approach, in fact, was ‘cultural poetics’. Greenblatt’s emphasis on social negotiations and processes in Shakespeare can be seen to follow Williams’ line of cultural history. New historicism drew on anthropologists like Clifford Geertz who read culture like a language; on post-structuralist philosophers like Michel Foucault, who examined collective discourse as a system of rules and exclusions; and on social historians such as Carlo Ginzburg, who recovered the voices of popular culture by reading what official documents both said and left unsaid. Montrose and\n\n12\n\nA CULTURAL HISTORY OF THEATRE IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE\n\nother new historicists have been especially insightful in identifying, à la Williams’ emphasis on ‘residual’ structures of feeling not extirpated by dominant culture, the vestigial presence, via secularization, of religious ritual in early modern theatre. In this respect Montrose is congruent with British culture studies in the vein of Keith Thomas’s Religion and the Decline of Magic: Studies in Popular Beliefs in Sixteenth- and Seventeenth-Century England (1971). But while new historicism showed, and continues to show, how illuminating to the study of early modern theatre anthropological, cultural and sociohistorical approaches can be, its insights have been largely confined to early modern English theatre, and increasingly (in a strange turn) focused on the single figure of Shakespeare. This volume attempts both to extend its purview to the continent of Europe and the New World (with regrettably, only scattered references to non-Western theatres), and to attempt, as no new historicist study has ever done, a cultural-historical theatre history of the early modern age. While no theatre history can claim to be ‘comprehensive’, the aim in these pages is to extend the geographical and socio-economic range of early modern theatre history as far as possible while remaining focused on the same ten cultural questions that guide the chapters of each of this series’ six volumes. The ten rubrics framing the chapters pose cultural questions that do not respect geo-linguistic, national boundaries; indeed, any serious reckoning with these matters requires transnational triangulation. Similarities conditioned by the historical parameters provide a fulcrum that can clarify salient differences. We are committed to a transnational approach that examines not just the ‘big four’ theatres of early modern England, Spain, France, and Italy, but also theatre and performance in the German-speaking regions, the Low Countries, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, and the New World. Although most explicitly addressed by Pavel Drábek in Chapter 5, ‘Circulation’, many elements of theatre and performance travelled across geo-linguistic boundaries in the early modern period: travelling actors, printed and manuscript scripts and scenarios, short stories (novelle) ransacked for dramatic ideas and theatrical pranks, actors’ gags, character types and configurations, plot modules, costumes, designs and ideas about theatre architecture and scenic technology, nuggets of dramatic theory, costumes, dynastic marriage partners who were patrons of the theatre (e.g., Catherine de’ Medici), etc. Although no one would deny transnational mobility to the ancient or medieval periods, the new commercial circulations abetted by early capitalism, the pan-European humanist movement that disseminated so many texts and ideas about theatre from the early fifteenth century on, and the religious crises of the sixteenth century – both Reformation and Counter-Reformation engaging theatre for its own ideological purposes – all tended to increase by both rate and quantity the international circulation of theatrical ideas and practices.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nTransnational mobility, moreover, is not just a quaint characteristic of early modern theatre; it constitutes a generating principle in its own right, in which (as per Williams) the ‘artistic’ and the ‘social’ were altogether enmeshed. The first organized professional theatre, which begins to appear in the 1540s and expands in the 1560s, was the pan-Italian commedia dell’arte, always already ‘transnational’ if we consider that the troupes made very early forays to the German-speaking lands. It soon established Paris as a regular venue, and from the beginning had to negotiate the borders between the duchies, republics and petty states of pre-national Italy. The cross-fertilization generated by Italian troupes travelling into France was fundamental to the growth of French theatre, especially when, after the decline of the northern Italian courts that patronized the professional actors, the Italian actors gradually established a pied-à-terre at the Parisian Comédie-Italienne. Transplanted actors like Domenico Biancolelli (the second great Arlecchino/Harlequin) and Tiberio Fiorillo, in arte Scaramouche, increasingly began to perform in French,37 just as the English actors touring the German states and the Low Countries began to perform in German in a surprisingly short time. The international entrepôt of Venice was replete with Greek, Albanian, Croatian, German, and other districts, and collected Bergamasks and other peoples from the hinterlands of its empire.38 There, it can be argued, the ‘theatre of dialect’ that issued into the polylingual commedia dell’arte was born. The stage macaronic language of Tristano Martinelli, who mixed Spanish, Latin, French, and Italian in his verbal productions, and the shards of Babel performed by the English actor John Posset on the continent are not far away. Transnational mobility – and we can understand it in the most concrete and material terms – quite literally generated ‘aesthetic’ invention: the maschera of Arlecchino/Harlequin was invented on the road, by a Mantuan actor sharing a Parisian stage with French farceurs, and Pickelhering was developed by English itinerant actors on Dutch and German soil.39 The international networks of itinerant actors were constituted by a meld of the material and the immaterial: no actor travelled where a road, or sea route, or canal passage wasn’t established or constructed; but letters mattered more than mules when the many hindrances to extended travel and border crossing obtained: long routes, poorly maintained roads, bad weather, surly customs agents, and geo-political protectionism. As Stephen Greenblatt argues in Cultural Mobility: A Manifesto,40 ‘mobility studies’ should address the resistance to border crossing as well as transnational passages (moderating our post-1989 elation at fallen walls with the sober realization of identity resurgence, especially in the year 2016, on regional and national levels). In addition to the obstacles mentioned just above, we can examine the cultural impediments to transnational exchange, such as the English antipathy to the practice of having actual women play female roles, and thus the surprising absence of Italian professional companies in London between 1577 and the Restoration, with only minor\n\n14\n\nA CULTURAL HISTORY OF THEATRE IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE\n\nexceptions. To know how actors’ bodies, costumes, accessories, plots, scripts, scenarios, theatregrams, gags, architectural ideas and stage technologies could not overcome geo-linguistic borders quickens our understanding of how they could. If early modern theatre was transnationally mobile, this volume practises ‘mobility’ in its scholarly approach as well, as we propose a genuinely transnational cultural history of early modern theatre.\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nInstitutional Frameworks for Theatre, 1400–1650 Mapping Theatrical Resources TOM BISHOP AND ROBERT HENKE\n\nAs with the histories of most complex cultural phenomena, no single or linear narrative adequately charts the institutional frameworks regulating, ideologically forming, and financially supporting theatre and performance from 1400 to 1650 in Europe. This is especially the case if one considers the matter transnationally, and even beyond the four most prominent early modern theatres of England, Spain, France and Italy. The patchwork of institutions and the temporality of change were uneven, and the most secure generalization that can be made is that institutional frameworks underwriting theatre and performance in this period were socially and economically hybrid, reflecting the age’s uneven transition from feudal to capitalist modes of production and organization. Complicating the situation even more is the fact that paratheatrical and diverse performative practices (whether perceived as involving ‘performance’ or not) positively thrived in a period when increased urban growth and the rise of the courts both generated conspicuous public stages. The age abounds with myriad forms of street and piazza theatre, carnival, charivari, public executions, public shaming rituals, royal entries, urban pageants, succession ceremonies, and much, much more. In considering early modern forms of theatre and performance, cultural history in the Marxist tradition of Gramsci and Raymond Williams can closely attend to economic ‘substructure’ while also acknowledging the independent agency and mobility of\n\n15\n\n16\n\nA CULTURAL HISTORY OF THEATRE IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE\n\ncultural forces.1 An understanding of the larger currents of political and economic change can clarify some of the parameters of artistic production, and also illuminate the social ‘structures of feeling’ that, in Williams’s view, constitute culture.2 Residual and emergent, as well as dominant cultural ideas, postures, attitudes and assumptions should be examined in order to gain as full a picture as possible. Between 1400 and 1650, broadly speaking, developments in economic and political realms pulled in contrary but dialectically related directions. On the one hand, a generally freer circulation of money, commodities, labour and land compounded a fraying of tighter feudal relations with the emergence and expansion of mercantile commercialism and capitalist modes of production in European towns and cities.3 Urban corporations and those who controlled them sought and increasingly gained a measure of independence from local feudal lords and seigneurs. Their success in these endeavours underwrote the creation of a Europe-wide network of increasingly wealthy traders, merchants and bankers, and tapped at large into national and international networks of trade and, especially in the case of extra-European activity, plunder. It is out of this widening network that the central economic drivers and institutions of the future – industrialization, the corporation and the bank – appear at the end of our period. On the other hand, such wrenching conflicts as the Wars of the Roses, the Castilian and Catalonian Civil Wars and the Conquest of Granada, and the Hundred Years’ War eventually enabled and resulted in a drive to consolidate political and military power under strong national or imperial leaders: Henry VII in England, Ferdinand and Isabella in Spain, Louis XI in France, Maximilian I in the Holy Roman Empire. The rule of these monarchs was increasingly conceived and expressed in ‘absolutist’ terms, as the king or emperor or duke became in effect a transferred and enlarged ‘apparatus of feudal domination’ whose chief task was to suborn or dominate the remnants of feudalism itself.4 Capitalism and absolutism thus grew up together, but were also checked and limited in various ways, including by each other. Emergent capitalism was retarded in its drive to value extraction and market efficiency by the persistence of feudal habits of organization and production, particularly in outlying and remoter areas, and by its need to rely on monarchical power, for instance for the protection afforded by monopolies and military force. Absolutism, meanwhile, was checked both by ongoing struggle against surviving feudal magnates in times of weakness (as during the Fronde in France), and by its recurrent need to rely directly on the financial backing of capital to fight its wars and promulgate its glories.5 In the longer view, Perry Anderson argues, absolutism was a transitional structure – though it cannot, of course, have seemed like one at the time – which sought to absorb from the feudal aristocracy its local jurisdiction in law and violence, but it was shot through with contradictions at every point, most especially in its ever-increasing dependence on capital\n\nINSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS\n\n17\n\nmarkets, and never more clearly than in the case of Habsburg Philip II ’s eventually disastrous imperial overreach in both the New World and in northern and central Europe. The implications of these large-scale pressures and changes for theatrical activity across Europe are sketched below. In broad terms, we argue, the parallel growth of absolutist patronage and expanded urban markets drove innovation in theatrical institutions. The claim that theatrical and theatre-supporting institutions were particularly tied, even in their non-homogeneity, to larger economic and social patterns of organization, depends in turn upon recognizing theatre as a cultural form that requires a concentration of material, temporal and human resources that some other forms comparatively do not. Though substantial training may be required to become a poet, and substantial patronage of one kind or another to sustain poetry as a livelihood, the corresponding requirements for theatrical enterprise are, for the most part, even more exigent. Local and punctuated theatrical activity, of the kind tied, say, to a calendrical cycle, may be able to survive, and even flourish, on the intermittent commitment of available resources by patrons or community. The largest and most important theatrical development of the period in question, however – the emergence of regular, secular, commercial, urban and professional playing that could provide sustained presentation and livelihood – depended on fundamental changes in the concentration, organization and flow of resources across societies as a whole that were deeply related to the entwined emergence of capitalism and absolutism. These changes made possible new ways of directing resources to theatre, and new reasons for doing so, even while older ways persisted, sometimes right alongside and even within the new. To clarify these relations, we offer a systematic taxonomy or ‘map’ that may provide general orientation on how and when and with what concentrations of resources theatrical activity was organized across the period at large. Diachronic changes can, in this way, be observed in relation to a large matrix that continues to register areas where change lags. This is important since many cultural and social practices that continued to inform early modern modes of performance and reception were of longue durée, extending on both sides of the period in question, even though one can observe a broad transformative shift from festival-based occasional theatre to more or less quotidian professional theatre primarily based on the market and drawing resources and strategies from emergent capitalist modes of production and absolutist lines of patronage. For the purposes of this taxonomy then, we identify two intersecting axes along which to locate theatrical activity. One axis charts the level of resources in material, time, remuneration and other support, from low to high, exiguous to lavish. The other axis charts the continuity of resource support that potential performers have access to, from strictly limited in time to an access regular enough to function as sustaining (Figure 1.1).\n\n18\n\nA CULTURAL HISTORY OF THEATRE IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE\n\nFIGURE 1.1: Map of theatrical resources.\n\nI In one corner of the resulting ‘map’ (lower left) are the various performances with access to resources both poor and discontinuous. Where access is constrained by geography or lack of mobility in an area that cannot or will not generate continuous support even at a low level, sustained livelihood activity for theatre is impossible. But this does not mean there is no performance. Here we find such theatrical enterprises as rural mummings, folk plays, and other\n\nINSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS\n\n19\n\nperformances associated with religious rites or other festivals, drawing on local skills and aptitudes and in general mobilized from the ordinary surrounding world of work (Figure 1.2). This small-scale but almost ubiquitous and highly durable institutional framework both pre-dates and post-dates our period. Everywhere longstanding village folk dramas treating heroes such as Robin Hood, hero combats, wooing, gender reversals, the battle between winter and summer or between Lent and Carnival, and issues or rituals of fertility were keyed to important annual festivals or local observances. In England, principal occasions included Christmas, Epiphany, Shrove Tuesday/Carnival, Hock Tuesday, Easter, Plough Monday, Pentecost, May Day, Midsummer Watch and All Souls. The community festivities of such days created a sense of cohesiveness and connection with the past, and possibly helped to mediate between local feudal lords and peasantry. Though partly threatened by the retreat of feudalism and partly frowned on by religious reformist zeal for their patent, if often tempered, pagan elements, these performances survived long and late, and increasingly catered to an emerging early modern nostalgia for a feudal past. The Church remained the chief institutional sponsor of these activities, which were often produced by groups of villagers organized somewhat like a guild. They provided an income source – a form of charity – for churches, even after they had first paid off the amateur performers themselves. Whereas England tended to bifurcate its festivity between the indoor games and entertainments of the Christmas season and the outdoor entertainments focused around May Day, Corpus Christi Day, and Midsummer, the warmer countries of southern Europe made the earlier Carnival period itself – and especially the few days culminating in Mardi Gras – the time of intense outdoor theatrical activity. In the countryside of Italy and other continental countries, carnival plays, produced by churches and townspeople in the manner of the English\n\nFIGURE 1.2: Woodcut of Elizabethan clown Will Kemp (1560–1603), dressed as a traditional morris dancer.

Such traditional forms of folk performance do not get frequent mention in early modern theatre histories (except in regard to Shakespeare). However, from a cultural historical perspective that asks, across the socio-economic spectrum, (1) who made theatre, (2) how it mattered to the people who produced and consumed it, and (3) how emergent forms of theatre in the period were put together, such traditional forms are fundamental.\n\nII Discontinuous, intermittent or irregular performance at the high end of the resource axis (upper left) is already well established at the beginning of our period. Large civic and religious institutions had been sponsoring occasional or festival drama on a lavish scale for a considerable time. Liturgical drama in monasteries, civic presentations of Passion plays and Corpus Christi cycles and large-scale carnival theatricalities in both urban and rural areas show sponsorship variously centralized or parcelled out. In some ways, these are simply bigbudget versions of the smaller village festivals – they serve the same local function of celebrating community and continuity under God and Time. But their impact and organizational requirements are also qualitatively different, and they adopt some specific strategies, such as outsourcing the creation of scripts to a literate cadre, as the surviving English cycle-play manuscripts suggest. Generally, the framework of reliable if intermittent support based in alliances between church and community declines across the period, as disruptive changes in religious life and institutions have a considerable impact. But these changes can bolster as much as decimate. The English religious plays cease, for reasons economic and political. But the Spanish autos sacramentales begin only in the sixteenth century, shadowing the consolidation of Catholicism as Spanish national policy, and revived Catholicism in Habsburg central Europe also promoted religious drama, though such religious institutional support as continued into the Reformation/Counter-Reformation era – for example in German Reform churches, and among the Jesuits – was often significantly less opulent either than previous large-scale presentations or than the magnificent performances sponsored by contemporary courts to be discussed shortly. The socio-economic framework informing such large-scale calendrical theatricality as a regular occurrence – a critical mass of population, wealth, literacy, education, and labour organization (guilds) – did not really develop until the late medieval period. The first references to the York mystery cycles come from the late fourteenth century. The Corpus Christi-based Spanish auto sacramental, although it may draw from fifteenth-century traditions, was not codified until the early sixteenth century, was inflected by the\n\nINSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS\n\n21\n\nCounter-Reformation, and flourished in the seventeenth-century drama of Lope and Calderón. Records of mystery plays in the Czech Lands, Hungary, and Dalmatia date back to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, but it was only the sixteenth century that saw a flowering of the mystery play in Poland and Croatia-Dalmatia, where a certain critical level of civic wealth had now been reached.6 Aside from devotional feeling, what mattered particularly in such processions and theatrical stagings was displaying and celebrating the structure of the social order. For the most part, these calendrical events were produced by ‘amateur’ performers, producers, designers and builders, if we understand the word to designate not ‘the unskilled’ but those for whom theatre did not provide a primary livelihood. In urban centres that prospered from commerce and economic growth, preLent theatrical activity also grew. In Nuremberg, for one, the Fastnachtspiele (Shrovetide plays), most famous as written by the shoemaker-poet and Mastersinger, Hans Sachs (1494–1576), were produced at the city Carnival or Schembartlauf (until it was banned in 1539).7 After permission was granted by the city fathers to perform the plays (not all of Sachs’ plays were approved), tradesmen-actors performed these farcical and satirical pieces in halls, squares and church courtyards. Processions with floats, usually constructed by confraternities or guilds, filled the streets, where costumes and masks allowed for some flouting of normal social and sexual constrictions, and the line between performer and spectator was blurred. In such an environment, it is not surprising that social groups who wished to assert or reinforce their standing often sought to do so by public theatrical activity. A particularly important focus of such organization throughout the period can be found in groups of young men of various classes, from informal groups in small towns and villages that organized the charivari or ‘rough music’ to larger and more organized groupings with access to more prestige and resources. Such youth companies mounting theatrical revelries can be found very widely: the Inns of Court (London), the Abbaye des Conards (Rouen), Compagnie de la Mere Folle (Dijon), or Compagnie della Calza (Venice). France was especially productive of such theatricalizing youths. The battle between Carnival and Lent, vividly depicted in the Peter Brueghel the Elder painting of 1559, was dramatically enacted in a fifteenth-century French text, ‘The Battle of Saint Pensard’.8 The play was written to be produced and performed in Tours in 1485 by a group of educated young men who formed a ‘society of fools’. In Paris, public secular theatre from the second quarter of the fifteenth century to the mid-sixteenth was dominated by the Clercs de la Basoche, a literary society of law clerks numbering as many as ten thousand by 1500.9 This was a bourgeois phenomenon, drawn from a class of magistrates and clerics created by the king to check the power of feudal lords. Mirroring the lawyers’ own professional societies, the clerks formed a counterpart group,\n\n22\n\nA CULTURAL HISTORY OF THEATRE IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE\n\nand from writing and staging causes grasses, or burlesque trials to be staged during Carnival, to short farcical plays for public entertainment, the road was not far. By 1442, the Confrérie de la Passion, which controlled religious performances in Paris, was allowing the Basochiens to perform their farces in between the days of their mystères, first at the Hôpital de la Trinité and then at the Hôtel de Bourgogne (their monopoly theatre in Paris). In effect, the Basochiens inserted themselves in the interstices of the liturgical calendar in order to perform their secular, realistic farces set in a bourgeois milieu. The farce of Maitre Pierre Pathelin is only the most famous. Performing up to the mid-sixteenth century, the Basochiens skirt the border of professionalism, and no doubt there were members involved whose devotion to theatre at least matched their trade affiliation. Increasing royal censorship and the rise of truly professional playing in the later sixteenth century caused their demise. Comparable to the Basoche societies in their support for theatre were the four English Inns of Court, which admitted young men to study law, usually the sons of gentry or above, or occasionally, like John Webster, the sons of prosperous citizens. Their self-funded production of plays, as well as masques, orations and dancing, occurred mostly during the festive Christmas season, under the guidance of a Master of the Revels, or, occasionally, a Lord of Misrule. Up until the late 1560s, theatrical performance was mostly undertaken by amateurs, but later, professional players were often hired to contribute to the revels, as with the Lord Chamberlain’s Men’s performance of Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night at the Middle Temple on 2 February 1602. Even the learned and aristocratic humanist academies of France and Italy might be included under this rubric, though both their means and their memberships were a great deal more sophisticated. Italian academies such as the Olympic Academy, responsible for the erection of the Teatro Olimpico (1585), became increasingly important producers of theatre as the entrepreneurial sway of northern courts like Mantua and Florence began to wane after the 1620s. Somewhat like the English Inns of Court, the Italian academies provided a site where professional and amateur theatre producers worked together, with the academy occasionally providing a cover against antitheatrical attacks on those who performed theatre for sordid money. A significant counterpart can also be found in the Rederijkerskamer (Chambers of Rhetoric) of the Netherlands, although as an institutional phenomenon, these organizations vex both a ‘medieval–Renaissance’ and a ‘sacred–secular’ division. Originating as secular devotional brotherhoods assisting clergy in religious processions, these were amateur membership groups, but underwritten by both aristocratic patrons sponsoring each chamber and by the municipal festivals in which they participated. They emerge and prosper exactly within the temporal reach of the present volume, with about sixty created in the course of the fifteenth century and some one hundred and twenty more in the sixteenth.\n\nINSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS\n\n23\n\nCentral players in the public life of thriving Dutch towns, they put on tableaux vivants for church feast days (Palm Sunday, Easter, Corpus Christi, Pentecost) but also produced original poetry and drama, and provided pageant wagons and triumphal arches for secular occasions such as royal entries. The sheer numbers of these Chambers demonstrate their wide reach into bourgeois social and cultural life, and their adaptability to a range of audiences and genres renders these amateur theatrical groups a vital phenomenon for a cultural history of early modern theatre. They played a key role in the Dutch ‘public sphere’ and are thus comparable at once to the English trade-guilds of the mystery cycles, but without the craft affiliation, and to the Italian academies, but without the class exclusivity: theirs was predominantly a distinctively civic and republican character. However, the institutions best resourced and most keen to advertise themselves by theatrical means were the royal courts. These latter, also sponsors of discrete high-resource events, expanded enormously across our period. Though court entertainments such as royal entries, court mummings, and festive revels are well attested in the fifteenth century, such court-based and court-backed events are driven throughout the sixteenth and into the seventeenth century by massive new aggregations of resources formed in particular under the emerging absolutist orders of France, Spain and England – and on a regional scale in the duchies and city-states of Italy, Germany, the Czech Lands and elsewhere. By 1600, courts as institutions both sponsored regular, staggeringly expensive, and elaborate forms of theatrical performance, and also promoted extravagant forms of theatricality on a day-to-day basis (Figure 1.3). Self-aggrandizing court magnificence seized on theatre as an especially effective medium. As part of this movement of co-optation, courts not only sponsored their own events, drawing on whatever expertise they needed – for masques, entertainments, entries, processions, coronations, anniversaries, funerals, etc. – but they frequently extended their protection and patronage to professional theatre-makers under attack by municipal and ecclesiastical opponents, operating not merely as their intermittent direct financial backers but also as established political sponsors. In Italy, for instance, the patronage of commedia dell’arte companies by Mantuan, Florentine and Savoian courts provided the players with the economic security and cultural capital also to play in ‘public’ theatres such as the Teatro di Baldracca in Florence.10 In England and France, professional players eventually came under the direct political patronage and protection of the royal family. But such co-optations could be complex, and often policed theatrical activity as much as they promoted it. In England, the 1572 law by which professional players had to be at least nominally attached as ‘retainers’ to reputable sponsors was precisely an attempt (not entirely successful) to contain professional playing in limited hands from a\n\n24\n\nA CULTURAL HISTORY OF THEATRE IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE\n\nFIGURE 1.3: Representation of a ballet before Henri III and his court, in the Gallery of the Louvre.

As a corollary to this protection, governments often also developed machineries of vetting and censorship as, again in England, through the Office of the Revels. The relation of these developments to other nascent practices of governmental regulation and oversight being instituted by the monarchies is notable. The extension of royal and other aristocratic court patronage to the learned also had the effect of sponsoring drama as a by-product – especially from the new humanist intellectuals for whom drama was a high-status classical form. Gil Vicente (c. 1465–c. 1536) wrote principally, in both Spanish and Portuguese, for court performance. Juan del Encina (1468–c. 1530), a priest and musician, composed pastorals and comedies at the court of the second Duke of Alba. In England, Henry Medwall was patronized by Cardinal Morton, and John Skelton tutored the young future Henry VIII . One group or location of cultural authority that did not notably sponsor theatrical activity in the period was what we might now be tempted to call ‘the government’. At one level this absence merely reflects the fact that, in the period in question, ‘government’ barely existed in our sense of an organized bureaucratic apparatus administering concerted and centrally determined policies through a\n\nINSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS\n\n25\n\nvariety of means. But this claim at once admits of two important exceptions that indicate significant developments. In England, Thomas Cromwell’s ‘government’ reforms, as they can only be called given their scope and purpose, included the remarkable innovation of briefly supporting a company of touring players to disseminate plays of Protestant theology commissioned from the polemicist exCarmelite John Bale (1495–1563).11 The project itself suggests the radicality of Cromwell’s programme of reform.12 The other instance of ‘government theatre’ is located far away, in Spanish Mexico, where the early colonial governmental and religious authorities (in practice hardly separate) supervised missionary theatre under the auspices at first of the Franciscans, and later also of the Jesuits. From 1533, large-scale custombuilt theatrical spectacles in both Spanish and indigenous languages on subjects such as The Conquest of Rhodes (Mexico City, 1539, in Nahuatl), and The Conquest of Jerusalem (Tlaxcala, 1539) were mounted in response to news of a supposed impending Catholic crusade in Europe. The Rhodes play was probably performed during Carnival and had substantial feasting, processions and other typical celebratory forms associated with it. It was sponsored under the joint auspices of the city and the Franciscans, and Cortés himself may even have played the Christian general attacking Rhodes. The Tlaxcala Conquest (1539) was, according to Las Casas’s report, entirely staffed, arranged and performed by Indians in indigenous languages. With participants estimated at 1,500, it was performed on Corpus Christi and integrated directly into the end of that festival’s religious procession. It was only one of a series of regular Christian-inspired pageants and performances, lavish and on a grand scale: Las Casas reported witnessing one with an audience of ‘more than eighty thousand people’.13 The humanist educational movement, discussed at more length below, was particularly active in drama through its investment in the rhetorical and poetic imitation of antiquity. But we should note that humanism was not an institution per se; rather, it was a set of ideologies and cultural practices brought into contact with a variety of institutions in different ways: the court or academy, as with Ariosto and the Este court in Ferrara; the guildhall, as with the Dutch rhetoric chambers; the school, as with Udall at Eton or in the Jesuit orders. In the case of the companies of English boy players, humanist educational drama even crossed over from a curricular instrument sometimes also displayed as court entertainment to become a sustained, if controversial, professional enterprise, especially for its managers. And with this last instance, we may pass over from predominantly amateur to professional livelihood performance.\n\nIII In the third quadrant of the ‘map’ (lower right) we locate forms of theatre where comparative poverty of resources was offset by continuous access to\n\n26\n\nA CULTURAL HISTORY OF THEATRE IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE\n\nthem, especially by a strategy combining mobility with a sufficient geographical density of resources tapped ‘in series’, even if only in a hand-to-mouth manner. On the street, at the fair, in the marketplace, or even in a local hall, such itinerant theatrical activity comprises both solo and small company performances of music, animal acts, sleight-of-hand tricks, acrobatics, mountebankery, even some kinds of begging, as well as plays. Geographically, the mode extends right across Europe, from the retinues of itinerant fili in traditional Ireland to the disreputable skomorokhi – wandering satiric minstrels – in Russia (Figure 1.4). In the earlier part of our period, itinerant performance provides one antecedent of more settled theatrical enterprise, and continues to intersect or alternate with it, and to provide a ready fallback, as when English companies of the late-sixteenth century resorted to touring in difficult times. Shakespeare’s Hamlet and Munday’s Sir Thomas More both include depictions of troupes in this mode – in effect the forebears of the very men playing them. In France, the recourse was even more common: the Comediens du roi regularly had to retrench to provincial touring in the early seventeenth century, and after the 1645 collapse of the Illustre Théâtre, Molière wandered for years as leader of an itinerant troupe that eventually resumed residency and at last morphed into the Comédie-Française. The companies of ‘English comedians’ that toured cities, towns and courts in Germany and further east, especially those under the\n\nFIGURE 1.4: Skomorokhi in a Russian village. François Nicholas Riss (1804–86).\n\nINSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS\n\n27\n\nindefatigable Robert Browne for thirty years after 1593, were the first in those areas ‘to create an awareness of theatre in its own right, not just as a diversion at holiday festivities or as a means of religious instruction’.14 Though the records of these travelling troupes tend to be thin and fragmentary, this mode probably constitutes the most widespread institutional model of professional or semiprofessional performance across these years. Perhaps the most interesting case of comparative scarcity combined with more-or-less continuous access, and one which also may be seen as a transitional stage to the next quadrant, is the mobile, itinerant, Italian professional theatre, dubbed ‘commedia dell’arte’ by Goldoni and posterity. Not only were mountebanks associated with commedia dell’arte, but the piazza entertainer who earns his living from performance all year round may be seen to mark a transition from occasional to continuous, professional theatre. Generally, the commedia dell’arte oscillated between neo-feudal and protobourgeois business arrangements. Agreements were secured between, on the one hand, the ducal agents, or sometimes the duke himself, of northern Italian courts such as Mantua and Florence and, on the other, the capocomico, or head of the Arte company, with the fiction that the actor was the sovereign’s ‘servant’. Secure performance arrangements at court frequently allowed the companies to perform also in stanze, or halls, of a more popular caste, such as the Florence ‘Baldracca’ theatre mentioned above. In one urban sojourn, therefore, the professional actors could play both the court and the market. In the face of antitheatrical attacks, actor-writer Pier Maria Cecchini advocated for theatre as a mercantile ‘arte’, whose technical standards matched those of any urban trade. At the same time, and contrasting with these neo-feudal arrangements, we also find new bourgeois models developed by Venetian entrepreneurs after 1580.\n\nIV It is in the final quadrant of the grid-map (upper right), where high-resource production combines with continuous access, that we find the most important addition to the network of institutional frameworks for drama in the period. At the beginning of our period, this quadrant is essentially empty. Its occupation by full-time, established, professional companies earning their livelihoods in large urban centres by 1650 is the period’s truly lasting innovation. These companies emerge in major cities in Italy, England, Spain, and elsewhere over approximately the period of the 1540s to the 1570s. A crucial factor is the increasing size of the host cities, as this enabled the frequent, often daily, attraction of sufficiently concentrated funds to underwrite drama by direct aggregation at the performance itself, without the need either for institutional sponsors (though courts often also supported these companies in various ways,\n\n28\n\nA CULTURAL HISTORY OF THEATRE IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE\n\nas noted) or for movement to a new site while demand replenished at the abandoned one. These companies could sustain themselves in situ for as long as sufficient resources could be attracted. When inhibited from doing so, by plague, political upheaval, economic disaster or limited-duration licensing (as in Madrid), they tended to revert to the older model of itinerant performance. So when, in the first decade of the seventeenth century, Valleran le Conte’s Comédiens du roi leased the Hôtel de Bourgogne theatre from its monopolists, the Confraternité de la Passion, they repeatedly struggled to attract a sustainable audience, despite holding the patronage of the French king and offering both expert currentaffairs-based clowning and the latest in modern humanist plays by Alexandre Hardy. Disappointed and fractious, the troupe returned to touring the provinces, where they found if not a more fervent at least a more renewable welcome.15 Resident professional troupes in urban centres were both innovative and flexible. They tended both to cultivate novel forms of organization, such as the outsourcing of script-production to humanist-educated writers, and to absorb within themselves key elements of earlier performance frameworks – such as independent clowns (Tarlton, Zan Ganassa, Lope de Rueda, Valleran le Conte), older spectacular effects (the hell-mouth in Doctor Faustus), and the figurative resonances of festive occasions (Twelfth Night, Bartholomew Fair, etc.). While the general conditions of economic and social change had some broad similarities, professional companies were also organized internally in various ways across geo-linguistic boundaries, from capocomico-style leadermanagement in Italy to ‘joint stock’ partnership in England. Spain and England both developed professional theatres in this period, but their respective national contexts and cultures resulted in quite different ‘attachment points’ of the companies to the social networks of emergent capitalism they inhabited. Although urban growth and its concentration of resources was the necessary condition of the professional playing troupes, the latter integrated with their national urban economics in various ways. Across Europe, the dissolution of the feudal system ‘freed’ the serf, in Marx’s words, to work for wages, often necessitating travelling to the city ‘where he found his master waiting for him’. Such workers provided much of the resource-income that enabled professional playing. But, at the same time, many of these would-be urban workers quickly became beggars instead, depending on emergent forms of urban charity. Along with the demographic and economic rise of major cities came the emergence of a new urban underclass amply represented in Spanish picaresque literature, as well as in the Italian figure of the destitute zanni of the commedia dell’arte, and in the English cony-catching pamphlets and German rogue books. In Spain, the necessities of this newly miserable group, which presented a serious problem of public order as well as a challenge to the consciences of their neighbours, were addressed by a network of new confradías, or religious brotherhoods, established\n\nINSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS\n\n29\n\nin the reign of Philip II . In the latter part of the century, these organizations began to lease out the courtyards, or corrales, of facilities owned by them or under their jurisdiction to professional acting companies, with a portion of the receipts – explicitly labelled ‘alms’ – going to the confraternity (Figure 1.5). Professional theatre in Spain was thus indirectly linked to the rise of new poverty as well as new wealth. As theatre became a major income source for charity, in Valladolid and Granada as well as Madrid, the tide of Spanish ecclesiastical attacks on the theatre also eased. Even if the production of plays was considered immoral, it was ingeniously argued that it was acceptable to turn the profits of immortality to charitable purposes.16 Furthermore, professional playwrights and actors dependent on this nexus could then be, and were, enlisted to write and perform autos sacramentales during the feast of Corpus Christi. The major playing companies of London expertly managed the double recourse to aristocratic patronage and urban consumer markets for financial support in a different way, drawing for their internal organizational framework both on emergent capitalist practices and older models of guild culture.17 Internally, the tripartite division of the late-century English professional acting company into sharers, hired men, and apprentices resembled in general terms the hierarchy of English guilds, even though the actors lacked a central organization that could oversee their profession, such as Spanish actors obtained in 1631 in the Cofradía de la Novena. Yet the only part of the English model\n\nFIGURE 1.5: Restored, surviving corral playhouse in Almagro, Spain. (Photo: Antonio Leyva.)\n\n30\n\nA CULTURAL HISTORY OF THEATRE IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE\n\ndirectly borrowed from the guild system was the practice of apprenticeship, and this because guilds were the only organizations through which apprentices could be enrolled.18 Hired men, on the other hand, remained precisely that – hired to play for a limited term. They were not, as in the guild system, journeymen members of a legal organization, though they might aspire to, and sometimes did, become sharers. The existence of sharing and of the joint-stock model of the company, meanwhile, was a highly innovative borrowing from a form of corporate association previously known only in mercantile adventuring and mining.19 Its adaptation to theatre-making is in fact quite remarkable, a possible outgrowth of the 1583 creation of the Queen’s Men by government fiat through cherry-picking the leading players of the day – with the result that no single member could easily be appointed its leader. Even more suggestively, the number of the original Queen’s Men, twelve, matches the standard number of sharers in the capitalist joint-stock venture, which was almost always a multiple of twelve.20 If the internal structure of English companies took elements from both older guild and newer capitalist institutions, the matrix of external institutional regulation and support was similarly hybrid. Legislative regulation by the English state, ever concerned for managing public order, led to a gradual confinement of players within an increasingly stringent requirement for official patronage and license by appropriate members of the state, extending variously from gentry up to the monarch.21 This requirement built on a link to feudal ideas of ‘retainership’, but also evinced the growing digestion of playing within the developing routines of central government, as also did the parallel imposition of various routines of censorship and vetting via the Master of the Revels and others. If playing was to be an industry, it was to be a regulated one, in the country as in the city. In London, the epicentre of innovation, we can also track the involvement of the playing companies with various machineries of early modern business: landholding, leasing, moneylending, and, inevitably, litigation. The majority of the professional actors in London were hired men, who worked for weekly wages, received no share of company profits, and were more vulnerable than the sharers to persistent negative prejudices against actors as vagabonds. Sharers, on the other hand, collectively owned the ‘stock’ of the company (including its scripts, costumes and licenses), and were paid a percentage of the daily profits. Their livelihoods could be fairly secure and, in some cases, as with Alleyn or Shakespeare, handsome, as long as their companies prospered. Other companies were more marginal affairs, and could come to be ‘managed’ and even exploited by landlord-financiers such as Philip Henslowe or, later, Christopher Beeston. Most companies did not own the theatre building in which they performed, but paid rent with a percentage of their per-performance income. Shakespeare’s company, the Lord Chamberlain’s/King’s Men, were\n\nINSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS\n\n31\n\nunusual after 1599 in owning not just the outdoor Globe theatre and the lease for the land on which it stood, but, as of 1608, the indoor venue in the Blackfriars as well. Court (and other private) performances, for which the company was paid, were another important source of income and, just as important, of prestige that offered protection from hostile city regulators. London theatre was economically, as John Lyly called its plays, a ‘minglemangle’, but so were those of the other great urban centres, in different ways.\n\nV A further word needs to be said about ‘humanism’, that plastic set of ideologies and rhetorical practices that spread and adapted itself across the cultural landscape of Europe throughout this period, finding a home for its devotees and disseminators variously in republics, monarchies, civil services, metropolises, colonies, grammar schools, universities, and churches both Roman and Reformed. Humanism in regard to drama, beginning in Italy and spreading across Europe, drove the rediscovery, editing, annotating, translating and theorizing of ancient dramatic texts, especially Latin ones, their imitation in new compositions, and their performance, beginning with Giovanni Sulpizio da Veroli’s landmark staging of Seneca in 1468 in an open-air Vitruvian amphitheatre on the Campo dei Fiori in Rome. Even after its exponents turned from Latin to the vernacular, the movement remained a resolutely transnational affair, creating across wide distances striking homologies in learned theatrical cultures and in their uptake by vernacular performers. However, humanism per se tended not to be, as it were, ‘independently wealthy’. For it to underwrite theatre materially, it needed to be attached to some other institution: a court, university, school, academy, confraternity, seminary, church, monastery or, at last, a theatre company. Outcomes were even better if humanist enterprise could mediate between sites of learning and of wealth. Humanist theatre that was exclusively transmitted through the court, such as characterized Russia, never really flourished. Humanist theatre in the Polish court, which had stronger ties with the university, fared better by contrast. Such connections between court and university also jump-started English humanist theatre: Medwall had studied at Eton and then Cambridge; Skelton, another Cambridge graduate, repositioned the morality play early into secular, satirical terms, shadowing court politics, in Magnificence (1519). Early Spanish humanist theatre similarly benefitted from points of contact between the court and university. Juan del Encina, a traveller to Italy like several English humanists, was educated at Spain’s then-premier university at Salamanca. In Italy, Ludovico Ariosto, a recipient of humanist training with Augustinian monks and then at the University of Ferrara, was patronized by the court of Ercole d’Este, which began promoting humanist theatre in the 1480s. The\n\n32\n\nA CULTURAL HISTORY OF THEATRE IN THE EARLY MODERN AGE\n\nillegitimate son of a sometime university physician, Angelo Beolco (Ruzante), associated with Padua’s humanist intellectuals, such as Bembo and Speroni, and may have performed his first play at the University of Padua: La pastoral (1517). His reputation might have stayed there, however, had he not acquired the favour of Alvise Cornaro, a retired Paduan patrician, who patronized Ruzante for the rest of his career and staged his plays at his aristocratic villa. The influx of new humanist professors, many of them from Germany, also generated theatrical productions that spread outside the confines of Charles University in Prague, inasmuch as they melded with urban processional traditions. There it was the alchemy of the humanist university and the newly founded Jesuit order that produced the most noteworthy theatrical productions. And in general the Jesuit educational mission, founded in a humanist tradition and taking drama as one of its main instruments, was productive of theatrical performance all across the vast extent of its geographical range, from Brazil to Sicily to Prague to India.22\n\nVI A map is a static visual instrument. Changes in the institutions sponsoring or occupying a given corner of our map across the period in question could occur at different times in different locations, and the tempo or fact of change in theatrical activity might result in marked differences from – and even contradict – the situation in another area of cultural activity, even in the same country. So for instance, to take the signal outliers in European theatre of the period, both Ireland under Lord Deputy Strafford (1632–39)23 and Russia under Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich (1645–76)24 saw the construction of permanent professional companies and venues for performance through the frank imposition by royal power of trends in theatrical culture imported wholesale from elsewhere (London and Paris, respectively), trends which had no basis in existing practice and hardly suited the local culture or economy. In the one case this was to buttress the prestige of the English colonial power, in the other to provide a rallying point and distinctiveness for a monarchy with absolutist aspirations. In both cases, these innovations required direct government support. In Ireland, rebellion soon caused this theatrical enterprise to collapse; in Russia, by contrast, the imported model persisted, but was heavily dependent on official patronage, and remained largely the preserve of a French-speaking elite into the eighteenth century. Although the most important single development in institutional frameworks for drama over this period was the rise of resident professional drama, it is also important to recognize exceptions, holdovers and countercurrents in any general narrative of ‘from festival to market’. What we repeatedly see is not so much a rhythm of ‘emergence and replacement’ as a more subtle one\n\nINSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS\n\n33\n\nof ‘adaptation and occupation’. Religious festival drama continued, but it increasingly became an expression of political choices intertwined with, even dictated by, more centralizing regimes. In the seventeenth century, urban festivals still occasioned important theatrical activity, but were now likely to be devoted as much to secular as to religious themes. The urban marketplace was from the outset an important theatrical locus, but across these centuries the institutions feeding it and "
