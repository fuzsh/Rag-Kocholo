It originated in the area around the town of Hechingen in Swabia during the 11th century. They took their name from their ancestral home, the Burg Hohenzollern castle near Hechingen.\n\nThe family uses the motto Nihil Sine Deo (English: Nothing Without God). The family coat of arms, first adopted in 1192, began as a simple shield quarterly sable and argent. A century later, in 1317, Frederick IV, Burgrave of Nuremberg, added the head and shoulders of a hound as a crest.[1] Later quartering reflected heiresses’ marriages into the family.\n\nThe family split into two branches, the Catholic Swabian branch and the Protestant Franconian branch, known also as the Kirschner line.[2] The Swabian branch ruled the area of Hechingen until the revolution of 1848/49. The Franconian branch was more successful: members of the Franconian branch became Margrave of Brandenburg in 1415 and Duke of Prussia in 1525. Following the union of these two Franconian lines in 1618, the Kingdom of Prussia was created in 1701, eventually leading to the unification of Germany and the creation of the German Empire in 1871, with the Hohenzollerns as hereditary emperors and kings of Prussia.\n\nGermany's defeat in World War I led to the German Revolution. The Hohenzollerns were overthrown and the Weimar Republic was established, thus bringing an end to the modern German monarchy.\n\nGeorg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia, is the current head of the House of Hohenzollern. On 27 August 2011, Georg Friedrich was married to Princess Sophie Johanna Maria of Isenburg. On 20 January 2013, Princess Sophie gave birth to twin sons, Carl Friedrich Franz Alexander and Louis Ferdinand Christian Albrecht, in Bremen. Carl Friedrich, the elder of the two, is the heir apparent.[3]\n\nOrigins[]\n\nOne of the most prominent ruling houses in the history of Europe, the Hohenzollern Dynasty played a major role in the history of Germany from the late Middle Ages until the end of World War I. It takes its name from a castle in Swabia first mentioned as Zolorin or Zolre (the modern Hohenzollern, south of Tübingen, in the Land Baden-Württemberg).\n\nCounts of Zollern (1061–1204)[]\n\nThe oldest known mention of the Zollern was in 1061 by Berthold of Reichenau. It was a county, ruled by the counts of Zollern, whose descent has been attempted to be linked (without success) to the Burchardinger dynasty.[4]\n\nuntil 1061: Burkhard I\n\nbefore 1125: Frederick I\n\nbetween ca. 1125 and 1142: Frederick II, eldest son of Frederick I[5]:XLI\n\nbetween ca. 1143 and 1150-1155: Burkhard II, 2nd oldest son of Frederick I[5]:XLI\n\nbetween ca. 1150-1155 and 1160: Gotfried of Zimmern, 4th oldest son of Frederick I[5]:XLI\n\nbefore 1171 – c. 1200: Frederick III/I (son of Frederick II, also Burgrave of Nuremberg)\n\nCount Frederick III of Zollern was a loyal retainer of the Holy Roman Emperors Frederick Barbarossa and Henry VI, and around 1185 he married Sophia of Raabs, the daughter of Conrad II, Burgrave of Nuremberg.\n\nAfter the death of Conrad II, often referred to as Kurt II who left no male heirs, Frederick III was granted the burgraviate of Nuremberg in 1192 as Burgrave Frederick I of Nuremberg-Zollern. Since then the family name has been Hohenzollern.\n\nAfter Frederick's death, his sons partitioned the family lands between themselves:\n\nThe older brother,[6] Frederick IV, received the county of Zollern and burgraviate of Nuremberg in 1200 from his father, thereby founding the Swabian branch of the House of Hohenzollerns. The Swabian line remained Catholic.\n\nThe younger brother,[6] Conrad III, received the burgraviate of Nuremberg from his older brother Frederick IV in 1218, thereby founding the Franconian branch of the House of Hohenzollern. The Franconian line later converted to Protestantism.\n\nFranconian branch[]\n\nThe cadet Franconian branch of the House of Hohenzollern was founded by Conrad I, Burgrave of Nuremberg (1186-1261).\n\nBeginning in the 16th century, this branch of the family became Protestant and decided on expansion through marriage and the purchase of surrounding lands.\n\nThe family supported the Hohenstaufen and Habsburg rulers of the Holy Roman Empire during the 12th to 15th centuries, and they were rewarded with several territorial grants.\n\nIn the first phase, the family gradually added to their lands, at first with many small acquisitions in the Franconian and Bavarian regions of Germany:\n\nAnsbach in 1331\n\nKulmbach in 1340\n\nIn the second phase, the family expanded their lands further with large acquisitions in the Brandenburg and Prussian regions of Germany and current Poland:\n\nMargraviate of Brandenburg in 1417\n\nDuchy of Prussia in 1618\n\nThese acquisitions eventually transformed the Hohenzollerns from a minor German princely family into one of the most important in Europe.\n\nBurgraves of Nuremberg (1192–1427)[]\n\nMain article: Burgraves of Nuremberg\n\n1192–1200/1204: Frederick I (also count of Zollern as Frederick III)\n\n1204–1218: Frederick II (son of, also count of Zollern as Frederick IV)\n\n1218–1261/1262: Conrad I/III (brother of, also count of Zollern)\n\n1262–1297: Frederick III (son of)\n\n1297–1300: John I (son of)\n\n1300–1332: Frederick IV (brother of)\n\n1332–1357: John II (son of)\n\n1357–1398: Frederick V (son of)\n\nAt Frederick V's death on 21 January 1398, his lands were partitioned between his two sons:\n\n1398–1420: John III/I (son of, also Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach)\n\n1420–1427: Frederick VI/I/I, (brother of, also Elector of Brandenburg and Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach)\n\nAfter John III/I's death on 11 June 1420, the two principalities were briefly reunited under Frederick VI/I/I. From 1412 Frederick VI became Margrave of Brandenburg as Frederick I and Elector of Brandenburg as Frederick I. From 1420, he became Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach. Upon his death on 21 September 1440, his territories were divided between his sons:\n\nJohn II, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach\n\nFrederick II, Elector of Brandenburg\n\nAlbert III, Elector of Brandenburg and Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach\n\nFrom 1427 onwards the title of Burgrave of Nuremberg was absorbed into the titles of Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach and Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach.\n\nMargraves of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1398–1791)[]\n\nMain article: Margraves of Brandenburg-Ansbach\n\n1398: Frederick I (also Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach)\n\n1440: Albert I/I/III Achilles (son of, also Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach and Elector of Brandenburg)\n\n1486: Frederick II/II (son of, also Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach)\n\n1515: George I/I the Pious (son of, also Duke of Brandenburg-Jägerndorf)\n\n1543: George Frederick I/I/I/I (son of, also Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, Duke of Brandenburg-Jägerndorf and Regent of Prussia)\n\n1603: Joachim Ernst\n\n1625: Frederick III\n\n1634: Albert II\n\n1667: John Frederick\n\n1686: Christian I Albrecht\n\n1692: George Frederick II/II (later Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach)\n\n1703: William Frederick (before 1686–1723)\n\n1723: Charles William (1712–1757)\n\n1757: Christian II Frederick (1757–1791) (son of, also Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach)\n\nOn 2 December 1791, Christian II Frederick sold the sovereignty of his principalities to king Frederick William II of Prussia.\n\nMargraves of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (1398–1604), later Brandenburg-Bayreuth (1604–1791)[]\n\nMain article: Margraves of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, later Brandenburg-Bayreuth\n\n1397: John I\n\n1420: Frederick I (also Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach)\n\n1440: John II\n\n1457: Albert I/I/III Achilles (also Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach and Elector of Brandenburg)\n\n1486: Siegmund\n\n1495: Frederick II/II (also Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach)\n\n1515: Casimir\n\n1527: Albert II Alcibiades\n\n1553: George Frederick I/I/I/I (also Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, Duke of Brandenburg-Jägerndorf and Regent of Prussia)\n\n1603: Christian I\n\n1655: Christian II Ernst\n\n1712: George I William\n\n1726: George Frederick II/II (previously Margrave of Kulmbach)\n\n1735: Frederick IV\n\n1763: Frederick V Christian\n\n1769: Christian II Frederick (until 1791, also Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach)\n\nOn 2 December 1791, Christian II Frederick sold the sovereignty of his principalities to king Frederick William II of Prussia.\n\nFrom 1701 the title of Elector of Brandenburg was attached to the title of King in and of Prussia.\n\nDukes of Jägerndorf (1523–1622)[]\n\nThe Duchy of Jägerndorf (Krnov) was purchased in 1523.\n\nMain article: Dukes of Jägerndorf\n\n1541–1543 : George I the Pious (also Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach)\n\n1543–1603 : George Frederick I (also Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach and Regent of Prussia)\n\n1603–1606 : Joachim I (also Regent of Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg)\n\n1606–1621 : Johann Georg of Hohenzollern\n\nThe duchy of Jägerndorf was confiscated by Ferdinand III of the Holy Roman Empire in 1622.\n\nBrandenburg-Prussian Branch[]\n\nMargraves of Brandenburg (1415–1819)[]\n\nMain article: Margraviate of Brandenburg\n\n1415-1440 Frederick I\n\n1471-1486 Albrecht III Achilles\n\n1486-1499 John Cicero\n\n1499-1535 Joachim I Nestor\n\n1535-1571 Joachim II Hector\n\n1571-1598 John George\n\n1598-1608 Joachim III Frederick\n\n1608-1619 John Sigismund\n\nMargraves of Brandenburg-Küstrin (1535–1571)[]\n\nMain article: Margraviate of Brandenburg-Küstrin\n\nThe short-lived Margraviate of Brandenburg-Küstrin was set up, against the Hohenzollern house laws on succession, as a secundogeniture fief of the House of Hohenzollern, a typical German institution.\n\n1535–1571: John the Wise, Margrave of Brandenburg-Küstrin (son of Joachim I Nestor, Elector of Brandenburg)\n\nHe died without issue.

With the accession of Wilhelm I to the newly established imperial German throne, the titles of King of Prussia, Duke of Prussia and Elector of Brandenburg were always attached to the title of German Emperor.\n\nMain article: List of German Kings and Emperors\n\n1871–1888: William I (also King of Prussia)\n\n1888: Frederick III (son of, also King of Prussia)\n\n1888–1918: William II (son of, also King of Prussia)\n\nIn 1918 the German empire was abolished and replaced by the Weimar Republic.\n\nLine of succession (1918 to present)[]\n\nAfter the outbreak of the German Revolution in 1918, both Emperor Wilhelm II and the Crown Prince Wilhelm signed the document of abdication, with effect only for their own person. Despite the abolition of the German monarchy in 1918, the House of Hohenzollern never relinquished its claims to the thrones of Prussia and the German Empire. These claims are linked by the Constitution of the second German Empire: according to this, whoever was King of Prussia was also German Emperor. However, these claims are not recognised by the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Constitution of 1949 guarantees democracy and republicanism.\n\nIn June 1926, a referendum on expropriating the formerly ruling princes of Germany without compensation failed and as a consequence, the financial situation of the Hohenzollern family improved considerably. A settlement between the state and the family made Cecilienhof property of the state but granted a right of residence to Crown Prince Wilhelm and his wife Cecilie. The family also kept the ownership of Monbijou Palace in Berlin, Oels Castle in Silesia, Rheinsberg Palace, Schwedt Palace and other property until 1945. The communist government of the Soviet occupation zone depropriated all landowners and industrialists, by which the House of Hohenzollern lost almost all of its fortune, leaving them only with a few company shares and Hohenzollern Castle in West Germany. The Polish government depropriated the Silesian property and the Dutch government seized Huis Doorn, the Emperor's exile seat. After the German reunification however, the family was legally able to claim their movable property back, namely art collections and parts of the interior of their former palaces. Negotiations on a return or compensation for these assets are not yet finished.\n\nMain article: Line of succession to the German throne\n\nName Titular\n\nreign Comments William II 1918–1941 Exiled in the Netherlands until his death Crown Prince William 1941–1951 Prince Louis Ferdinand 1951–1994 Prince Georg Friedrich since 1994 Prince Carl Friedrich heir presumptive\n\nThe head of the house is the titular King of Prussia and German Emperor. He also bears a historical claim to the title of prince of Orange. Members of this line style themselves princes of Prussia.\n\nPalaces of the Prussian Hohenzollern[]\n\nSome important castles and palaces of the Prussian Hohenzollern were:\n\nSwabian Senior Branch[]\n\nThe senior Swabian[6] branch of the House of Hohenzollern was founded by Frederick II, Burgrave of Nuremberg.\n\nRuling the minor German principalities of Hechingen, Sigmaringen and Haigerloch, this branch of the family decided to remain Roman Catholic and from 1567 onwards split into the Hohenzollern-Hechingen, Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and Hohenzollern-Haigerloch branches. The Romanian branch of this family became Orthodox, starting from Ferdinand's I children. When the last count of Hohenzollern, Charles I of Hohenzollern (1512–1579) died, the territory was to be divided up between his three sons:\n\nEitel Frederick IV of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1545–1605)\n\nCharles II of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1547–1606)\n\nChristopher of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch (1552–1592)\n\nThey never expanded from these three Swabian principalities, which was one of the reasons they became relatively unimportant in German history for much of their existence. However, they kept royal lineage and married members of the great royal European houses.\n\nIn 1767 the principality of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch was incorporated into the other two principalities. In 1850, the princes of both Hohenzollern-Hechingen and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen abdicated their thrones, and their principalities were incorporated as the Prussian province of Hohenzollern.\n\nThe last ruling Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, Karl Anton, would later serve as Minister-President of Prussia between 1858 and 1862.\n\nThe Hohenzollern-Hechingen finally became extinct in 1869. A descendent of this branch was Sophie Chotek, wife of Archduke Francis Ferdinand of Austria-Este.\n\nHowever, a member of the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family, Charles Eitel, second son of prince Karl Anton, was chosen to become prince of Romania as Charles I in 1866. In 1881 Charles I became the first king of the Romanians.\n\nCharles' older brother, Leopold, was offered the Spanish throne after a revolt removed queen Isabella II in 1870. Although encouraged by Bismarck to accept it, Leopold backed down once France's Emperor, Napoleon III, stated his objection. Despite this, France still declared war, beginning the Franco-Prussian war.\n\nCharles I had only a daughter who died very young, so Leopold's younger son Ferdinand I would succeed his uncle as king of the Romanians in 1914, and his descendants continued to rule in Romania until the end of the monarchy in 1947.\n\nIn modern times this branch has been represented only by the last king, Michael I of Romania, and his daughters. The descendants of Leopold's oldest son William continue to use the titles of prince or princess of Hohenzollern.\n\nKing Michael renounced his connection in 2011.[7]\n\nCounts of Hohenzollern (1204–1575)[]\n\nMain article: County of Hohenzollern\n\nIn 1204, the County of Hohenzollern was established out of the fusion of the County of Zollern and the Burgraviate of Nuremberg.\n\n1204–1251/1255: Frederick IV, also Burgrave of Nuremberg as Frederick II until 1218\n\n1251/1255–1289: Frederick V\n\n1289–1298: Frederick VI\n\n1298–1309: Frederick VII\n\n1309–1333: Frederick VIII\n\n1333–1377: Frederick IX\n\n1377–1401: Frederick XI\n\n1401–1426: Frederick XII\n\n1426–1439: Eitel Frederick I\n\n1439–1488: Jobst Nicholas I\n\n1488–1512: Eitel Frederick II\n\n1512–1525: Eitel Frederick III\n\n1525–1575: Charles I\n\nIn 1575 the County of Hohenzollern was split in two Counties with allodial rights, Hohenzollern-Hechingen and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.\n\nCounts of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch (1567–1630 and 1681–1767)[]\n\nThe County of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch was established in 1567 without allodial rights\n\nMain article: House of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch\n\n1575–1601 : Christopher of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch\n\n1601–1623 : John Christopher, Count of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch\n\n1601–1630 : Charles, Count of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch\n\nBetween 1630 and 1681 the county was temporarily integrated into the principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.\n\n1681–1702: Francis Anthony, Count of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch\n\n1702–1750: Ferdinand Leopold, Count of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch\n\n1750–1767: Francis Christopher Anton of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch\n\nAfter the death of Francis Christopher Anton in 1767, the county of Hohenzollern-Haigenloch was definitively absorbed into the principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.\n\nCounts, later Princes of Hohenzollern-Hechingen (1576–1623–1850)[]\n\nThe County of Hohenzollern-Hechingen was established in 1576 with allodial rights.\n\nMain article: Hohenzollern-Hechingen\n\nEitel Frederick IV (1576–1605)\n\nJohn George (1605–1623) (raised to Prince in 1623)\n\nEitel Frederick V (1623–1661) (also count of Hohenzollern-Hechingen)\n\nPhilip Christopher Frederick (1661–1671)\n\nFrederick William (1671–1735)\n\nFrederick Louis (1735–1750)\n\nJosef Friedrich Wilhelm (1750–1798)\n\nHermann (1798–1810)\n\nFriedrich (1810–1838)\n\nKonstantin (1838–1850)\n\nIn 1850 the principality was sold to the Franconian branch of the family and incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia.
