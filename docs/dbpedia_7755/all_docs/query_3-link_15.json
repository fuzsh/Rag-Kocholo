        "text": "The early medieval legend Translatio beati Grisogoni narrates how martyr Chrysogonus from Aquileia revealed himself to the citizens of Zadar as being put to rest in the old cemetery situated in the close vicinity of the city. Although it is historically hard to imagine that the relics, which were possibly translated to Zadar in the 7th century, would have been deposed outside the city walls at the time, the legend enriched the local hagiography with the narrative which played an important role in the subsequent centuries (to be almost forgotten in the Early Modern period). Translatio beati Grisogoni not only contains valuable “historical” material datable to early medieval centuries, but it is a relevant source for the research in the ‘memory making’ conducted by the Benedictine community of St Chrysogonus. Preserved through its liturgical usage in the powerful Iadertine abbey, Translatio beati Grisogoni had an important place in the life of both the monastery and the city during the Middle Ages. The paper addresses the problem of the location of the inventio of St Chrysogonus and its importance for the ‘making’ of the local memory of St Chrysogonus in medieval Zadar. Textual hints about its possible location (place Iadera Vetula understood to be in the vicinity of Zadar at the spot of the antique graveyard), are thus compared with the descriptions of the particular land-plots donated to the monastery during the 11th century. Building on author's previous research of the topic, the paper focuses on the relation between the local hagiography of St Chrysogonus and the set of documents attesting possible continuous interest of the Benedictine community in acquiring particular land-plots around the important sacred lieu de mémoire.\n\nThe Transformation of Confessional Cultures in a Central European City results from a series of projects about the history of Olomouc, a medium-sized royal city in Moravia in the present-day Czech Republic. Set in its regional as well as wider contexts, this study of Olomouc contributes to research into ecclesiastical and religious developments of both the late medieval and early modern periods, and in particular the confessional divisions that followed the German Reformation. The chapters of this book are divided along chronological lines and also divided by topics and themes including: Hussitism and Utraquism, the early Czech Reformation, the impact and influences of the German Reformation, and the revival of the Catholic Church from the second half of the seventeenth century. Even though the struggles between rival confessions in the city only took place between the 1530s and 1650s, the council had asserted the city’s Catholicity against the Hussites in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. This emphasis on the city’s Catholic spirituality, and the importance to the urban community of Catholic ritual and ceremonies was restored from the second half of the seventeenth century. The image of religious life in Olomouc that emerges from this study is of a society with competing Catholic bodies and individuals not only opposed to non-Catholic churches but also with sharp internal rivalries between Catholic institutions over forms of ritual and styles of worship.

This paper is a note to the complex topic of the relationship between the urban elite and Dubrovnik’s ecclesiastical institutions, viewed from the aspect of their real estate in the early medieval period. Ecclesiastical institutions in the early Middle Ages could serve as the repository of family property and identity. The ecclesiastical, political and social circumstances of that period resulted in major changes in the structure, appearance, and layout of the city, which was not only a specificity of medieval Dubrovnik. Ecclesiastical property was neither homogeneous nor unchangeable; instead, it varied with regard to the provenance and the time period, links to particular families, locality, (dis)continuity, importance, and purpose (pious purposes or income). Evolution of the commune in the 12th and 13th centuries implied a gradual disempowernment of the Archbishop and the clergy, as well as the emergence of new administrative bodies.\n\nAmong the fonts of the Central State Archive, one of them is the collection of the “Monastery of the Saint John the Vladimir” (no. 138). These documents bear testimony, mainly, to the pastoral activity of the monastery, but also of its economical activity. The biggest part of the documents (10 registers), contain information about: the incomes and expenses of the monastery, its properties, buying and selling of properties, the names of those that were baptized, married or had their funeral service effectuated by the vicar of the monastery. Some of the documents contain chronics, as it is that about the travel of one of the abbots of the monastery to the Holy Land, chronics from the life of different hieromonachs who have served in the monastery, or copies of earlier chronics regarding the history of the monastery. These documents date from the middle of the 17th century, to the years ’30 of the 20th century. It is of much interest to follow, through these documents, a part of the daily life of the monastery. The gifts dedicated quite often to the monastery, the preference of the Christians of the region for receiving the sacraments from the priests of this monastery, the systematic way in which is kept the inventory of the properties of the monastery, also the fact that the monastery was administered by a commission whose chair was the Metropolitan of Durres, show that the Monastery of St. John the Vladimir was frequently in the center of the attention for the local Christians."
