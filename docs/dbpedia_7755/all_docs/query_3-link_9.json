Today the area lies mostly in southern Poland but also extends into the north-eastern Czech Republic (Opava/Opawa/Troppau) and south-eastern Germany. The precise history of Silesia from the 9th to 11th centuries is uncertain, beyond the obvious Bohemian and Polish rivalry over the area. The ninth century chronicler known as the \"Bavarian Geographer\" mentions a Silesian state which, it is assumed, was absorbed into the early Polish Vistulan state which was overrun by Moravia in the second half of the 9th century . After Moravia was in turn overrun by the Hungarians in 906, the Polonians extended their authority to include parts of the former Vistulan state . Nevertheless, Bohemian influence in Silesia must have remained strong, as suggested by the possibility that Silesias principle city Wrocław (Breslau in German, referred to as Vratislavia in Latin texts) was founded by and named after Vratislav I Duke of the Bohemians . Bohemia consolidated its position in southern Poland after helping Otto I King of Germany defeat the Hungarians at Lechfeld near Augsburg in 955 and occupied Krakow . However, Mieszko I Prince of Poland conquered territories in southern Poland from the Bohemians in the late 10th century , and his successor Bolesław I took advantage of the Bohemian succession crises of the early 11th century to consolidate Polish influence in Silesia.\n\nRivalry between the two powers persisted, with open warfare breaking out several times during the first three decades of the 12th century . The turning point for Silesia came when Bolesław III Prince of Poland, before he died in 1138, divided his lands between his five surviving sons, marking the splintering and weakening of the centralised Polish state whose fortunes only revived in the early 14th century. Silesia was inherited by Bolesławs oldest son Władysław II, although he was expelled by his younger half-brother Bolesław IV. Władysław was supported by the emperor who, in 1157, forced Bolesław and his other brothers to accept arbitration to settle the dispute with Władysław. The result was the recognition of an autonomous Silesian state whose history from that time evolved separately from Poland, the descendants of Władysław II ruling in parts of Silesia until the mid-18th century.\n\nWithin a couple of generations, Silesia had moved from their Polish loyalties and gravitated to the Bohemian (and, more generally, the German) ambit. The importance of Silesia as a political entity was diminished because the Silesian princes divided their territories to create apanages for their younger sons. By the early 13th century, the territory consisted of numerous small autonomous duchies. The process was hastened by the invasion of Silesia in 1327 by Jan King of Bohemia who imposed Bohemian suzerainty on many of these Silesian principalities, which he re-granted to the incumbent princes as Bohemian fiefs . Bohemian control over Silesia was accepted by Kazimierz III King of Poland at Trenčin 24 Aug 1335 in return for King Jan's renunciation of his claim to the Polish crown .\n\nAn indication of the relative status of the different ruling Silesian princes is provided by a charter dated Jul 1401 which records an alliance between Wenczlaw...Bischof zu Breslaw, Przemisla czu Teschen mit seinen Söhnen, Conrad czur Oelss mit seinen Söhnen, Rupprecht czur Liegnicz, Przemko czu Troppaw, Bolcko und Bernhard czu Oppeln, Offka Herczoginne czu Oppul, Heinrich czu Lobin, Hans czu Usweczin, Ludwig czum Briege und Hannss czu Glogaw...Herren in Schlesien Herczoge against attacks on Breslau . The order of names partially reflects seniority by age but, particularly in the case of the younger princes, secondary ranking by status is also suggested.\n\nThe names of Silesian rulers and places are shown in this document in German, reflecting the prevailing German influence in the territory in the later medieval period. The present-day Polish equivalent place names are shown in square brackets in the chapters and sub-part titles.\n\nThe primary sources on Polish and Silesian history are diverse. The Chronica Polonorum, probably written by a German priest in Silesia in the mid-14th century, summarises Polish history from the origins of the Piast dynasty but concentrates on the development of Silesia after the early 12th century . Although the first part of the Chronica is based on earlier sources, it includes certain details which have not yet been found in other documentation. The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum surveys Polish history from its origins but is especially useful for Silesian history until the late 13th century . The Annales Capituli Cracoviensis and the Annales Cracovienses Compilati summarise events in central European history until the mid-10th century and detail Polish and Silesian history until 1331 . The Annales Wratislavienses summarise major events in Silesian history from the early 13th to the early 16th centuries . The coverage of the brief Annales Silesiæ Superioris extends mainly from the mid- to late-13th century but includes details which are unavailable elsewhere . The Chronica principum Poloniæ, which includes information dated up to the late 14th century, includes a detailed survey of the development of the individual Silesian principalites from the mid-12th century . Until the end-13th century, the work consolidates information found in other primary sources such as the Chronica Polanorum and the work of Martinus Gallus. However, its survey of Silesian history after that time is original. The Epytaphia ducum Slezie provide details on the dates of death and relationships of the Silesian dukes and members of their families from the early 13th to the mid-14th century which are unavailable elsewhere . Later Silesian history, with particular emphasis on the duchy of Sagan, is dealt with in the Catalogus abbatum Sanganensium, divided into five parts which were written variously between the late-15th and early 17th centuries. This work is available in the Scriptores Rerum Silesiacarum series .\n\nChapter 1. DUKES of SILESIA 1138-1159 (PIAST)\n\nWŁADYSŁAW of Poland, son of BOLESŁAW III \"Krzywousty/Wrymouth\" Prince of Poland & his first wife Zbislava Sviatopolkovna of Kiev (1105-30 May 1159) . The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum names (in order) the five sons of Bolesław III \"Vladislaum, Boleslaum, Mesiconem, Kazimirum, Henricum\", specifying that Władysław succeeded in Silesia . The Annales Capituli Cracoviensis record the birth in 1105 of \"Vladizlaus secundus\" . The Chronica principum Polonie records that the mother of \"Boleslaus suo primogenito Wladislao filio\" was \"ex quadam Ruthena nobili\" . He succeeded in 1138 as WŁADYSŁAW II \"Wygnaniec/the Exile\" Prince of Krakow and Silesia. He was expelled by his brother Bolesław IV: the Annales Capituli Cracoviensis record that in 1146 \"Wladizlaus fugit et Cracovia devastatur\" . In 1146, Konrad III King of Germany (whose half-sister was Władysław's wife) unsuccessfully tried to reinstate him . After Bolesław IV refused tribute to Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\" King of Germany, the latter invaded Poland in Aug 1157, forced Bolesław and his other brothers to submit, and compelled them to accept arbitration with their brother Władysław . [The Annales Cracovienses Compilati record the death in 1148 \"Wladyzlaus\" . This person has not been identified. The entry could indicate the exiled Duke Władysław II, the date being mistaken, but his own death is recorded in the same source in 1159.] The Annales Capituli Cracoviensis record the death in 1159 of \"Wladizlaus dux Polonie\" and the Annales Cracovienses Compilati the death in 1159 of \"Wladyslaus in exilio\" . The Epytaphia ducum Slezie record the death \"4 Non Iun\" of \"dux Wladizlaus Cracovie, Gnezdne, Syrazye, Kalisie et Slezie, pater fundatoris Bolezlai\" .\n\nm ([1120/25]) AGNES of Austria, daughter of LEOPOLD III \"der Heilige\" Markgraf of Austria [Babenberg] & his second wife Agnes of Germany [Staufen] ([1108/1113]-Altenburg/Thür 24/25 Jan [1160/63], bur Kloster Pforte an der Saale). The information concerning the wife of Duke Władysław II is contradictory. The Continuatio Claustroneoburgensis names \"Agnes\" as second daughter of \"Liupoldus marchio Austrie\" and \"Agnetem imperatoris Heinrici IV filiam\", specifying that she married \"Poleslaus dux de Polan\" , although there appears to be no \"Bolesław\" at the time to whom this could refer. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"Agnetam\" as \"Leopoldis marchio et Henricus sororem germanam\" and wife of \"dux Vergescelaus de Polonia\" . Her origin is further confirmed by a charter dated Jan 1150 in which Cardinal-deacon Guido informs Konrad III King of Germany of the steps he took against \"ducis Poloniæ et coniugis eius sororis vestræ ducis W\" . On the other hand, according to the Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum, the wife of Duke Władysław was Christina, daughter of Emperor Heinrich IV (stating in one passage that \"Heinricum quintum\" was \"fratrem uxoris [=Wladislai]\" and in a later passage that she was \"filia imperatoris Henrici quarti Cristine domine\") . The Chronica principum Polonie also states that \"Boleslaus suo primogenito Wladislao filio\" married \"filiam imperatoris Cristinam\" . The Epytaphia ducum Slezie provides a third possibility, naming her \"Adilheidis uxor eius filia imperatoris Heinrici IV\" (the entry follows that recording the death of Duke Władysław, to whom \"eius\" presumably refers) when recording her death \"VIII Kal Sep\" . The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum specifies that \"filia imperatoris Henrici quarti Cristine domine\", mother of \"Boleslam, Mesicone, Conrado Loripade\", was \"in Porta sepulta\" . It is chronologically implausible for the wife of Duke Władysław to have been the daughter of Emperor Heinrich IV, the births of whose known children are recorded between 1070 and 1086, assuming that the estimated birth dates of the couple's children are in the range [1127] to [1146] as shown below. The explanation is presumably confusion with the mother-in-law of Duke Władysław who was one of the emperor's daughters. Concerning her first name, the records of Kloster Neuburg make no known errors in recording the names of the numerous children of Leopold III Markgraf of Austria, although it is true that (as noted above) the name \"Boleslas\" is in error for \"Wladislas\". Onomastics help little in finding a solution, as both \"Agnes\" and \"Adelheid\" were names given to her descendants. The further complicating factor is the curious story concerning her grandson Jaroslav and his reported hatred of his stepmother \"Adelheid\" (see below), while elsewhere the second wife of Jaroslaw's father Bolesław is named Christina. The issue appears to be resolved by two necrology entries: the necrology of Kloster Neuburg records the death \"VIII Kal Feb\" of \"Agnes ducissa Polonie filia marchionis\" , and the necrology of Lilienfeld records the death \"VI Kal Oct\" of \"Agnes ux Wlaslai ducis Zlezorum filia fundatoris S Crucis\" .\n\nWładysław II & his wife had four children:\n\n1. BOLESLAW ([1127]-8 Dec 1201, bur Kloster Pforte an der Saale or Leubus) . The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum names (in order) the three sons of Władysław II \"Boleslam, Mesicone, Conrado Loripade\" . He was invested in 1163 as BOLESLAW I Duke of Breslau.\n\n- DUKES of BRESLAU.\n\n2. RYKSA ([1130/40]-16 Jun [1185]) . The primary source which confirms her parentage and her three marriages has not so far been identified. The De Rebus Hispaniæ of Rodericus Ximenes names \"Berengariam atque Richam\" as the wives of \"Aldefonsi Hispaniarum Regis\" . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"Rikissam\" as the only daughter of \"dux Vergescelaus de Polonia\" & his wife Agnes, specifying that \"primo fuit regina Suecie\", that by her second husband \"regi Russie nomine Musuch\" she was mother of \"Sophiam reginam Dacie et Rikissam\", the latter marrying \"imperatoris Castelle Alfunso\" , which contradicts other sources in many aspects. She was known as RIQUILDA in Spain . m firstly ([Oct/Dec] 1152) as his second wife, ALFONSO VII el EmperadorKing of Castile and Leon, son of RAYMOND de Bourgogne [Comté] & his wife doña Urraca Queen of Castile and León ([Grajal], Galicia 1 Mar 1105-Fresneda 21 Aug 1157, bur Toledo, Cathedral Santa María). m secondly (after 1162) RAYMOND BERENGER II Comte de Provence, son of BERENGER RAYMOND I Comte de Provence & his wife Beatrix Ctss de Melgueil ([1140]-murdered Nice 1166). m thirdly (after 1166) ALBERT [III] Graf von Everstein, son of ALBERT [II] Graf von Everstein & his wife ---. 1162/1197.\n\n3. MIESKO ([1132/46]-16 May 1211) . The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum names (in order) the three sons of Władysław II \"Boleslam, Mesicone, Conrado Loripade\" . He was invested in 1163 as MIESKO I Duke of Ratibor and Teschen.\n\n- DUKES of OPPELN.\n\n4. KONRAD ([1146/57]-17 Jan [1180/90]). The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum names (in order) the three sons of Władysław II \"Boleslam, Mesicone, Conrado Loripade\" . The Epytaphia ducum Slezie record the death \"16 Kal Feb\" of \"domicellus Conradus dux Glogowie filius eius [=Wladislai] frater fundatoris\" , the use of the descriptive \"domicellus\" suggesting he was a young adult when he died.\n\nChapter 2. DUKES of AUSCHWITZ [OŚWIĘCIM] 1315-1496 (PIAST)\n\nThe city of Oświęcim (Auschwitz in German) is located on the banks of the river Vistula, about 40 kilometres west of Cracow, in the southern part of present-day Poland. In medieval times, it lay in the extreme south-east corner of the duchy of Silesia and formed the eastern part of the duchy of Teschen. When Miesko I Duke of Teschen died in 1315, Auschwitz was separated as a separate duchy for his oldest son Wladislaw. It fell under Bohemian suzerainty after Jan King of Bohemia invaded Silesia in 1327. The duchy passed to a junior branch of the main Teschen family on the death in 1405 of Hanu III Duke of Auschwitz. Hanu IV, last duke of Auschwitz, declared himself vassal of Kazimierz IV King of Poland in 1454 and sold the duchy to the Polish king in 1457.\n\nA. DUKES of AUSCHWITZ [OŚWIĘCIM] 1315-1496 (PIAST)\n\nTwo brothers:\n\n1. WLADISLAW von Oppeln, son of MIESKO I Duke of Teschen [Piast] & his wife --- ([1275/80]-[Nov 1321/14 May 1324]) .

DUKES of BEUTHEN [BYTOM] and KOSEL [KOŻLE] 1281-1354 (PIAST)\n\nThe duchies of Beuthen and Kosel were established as the inheritance of Kasimir, second son of Wladislaw Duke of Oppeln who died in [1281/82]. Kożle [Kosel], today part of the town of Kędzierzyn-Kożle, lies at the confluence of the Kłłodnica and Oder rivers in southern Poland, while Bytom [Beuthen], about 40 kilometres due west of Kożle, is on the upper reaches of the river Oder. In medieval times the towns were adjacent to the duchy of Glogau and east of the duchy of Sagan, in the north-western part of Silesia. Kasimir Duke of Beuthen and Kosel swore allegiance to the king of Bohemia in Jan 1289. The autonomy of the area as a Silesian duchy was shortlived as Kasimirs grandson, Bolko II, died in [1354/55] without leaving male heirs when his lands were divided between Premislav Duke of Teschen (who later married Bolkos oldest daughter) and Konrad Duke of Oels (husband of Bolkos older half-sister) .\n\nKASIMIR von Oppeln, son of WLADISLAW Duke of Oppeln & his wife Euphemia of Poland [Piast] ([1253/57]-10 Mar 1312) .

The description of Wladislaw as Kasimirs brother has not been explained: they appear to have been first cousins.

DUKES of BRESLAU [WROCŁAW], DUKES of LOWER SILESIA 1163-1278 (PIAST)\n\nThe city of Wrocław [Breslau] straddles the river Oder in southern Poland. In medieval times, it lay at the heart of the duchy of Silesia, south-west of Oels, north-east of Schweidnitz, north-west of Brieg, and south-east of Liegnitz and Wohlau. After the death in 1159 of Władysław II of Poland, who had sought refuge in Silesia after his expulsion by his younger half-brother Bolesław IV, his older son Boleslaw I was confirmed as duke of Breslau after Emperor Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\" obliged his Polish uncle to recognise his rights to Silesia. Boleslaw Is duchy covered central and north-western Silesia (Lower Silesia), while his younger brother Miesko later ruled south-eastern Silesia centred on Ratibor and Teschen (also known as Upper Silesia). The fragmentation of Lower Silesia followed the death of Duke Heinrich II (Boleslaw Is grandson) in 1241 when his territories were split between his sons Heinrich (who took Breslau), Konrad (Glogau), and his oldest son Boleslaw II who retained the remaining part of Lower Silesia. Boleslaw IIs inheritance was further split between his sons Heinrich V (who took Liegnitz) and Bolko I (Jauer and Schweidnitz).\n\nBOLESLAW of Silesia, son of WŁADYSŁAW II \"Wygnaniec/the Exile\" Prince of Krakow and Silesia & his wife Agnes of Austria ([1127]-8 Dec 1201, bur Kloster Pforte an der Saale or Leubus) . The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum names (in order) the three sons of Władysław II \"Boleslam, Mesicone, Conrado Loripade\" . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"Bolislaum patrem ducis Vrescelavie Henrici\" as son of \"dux Vergescelaus de Polonia\" & his wife Agnes . The Annales Cracovienses Compilati name \"Boleslaus filius Wladyzlay cum fratre suo Meskone\" when recording that he took control of Silesia in 1163 . He was invested as BOLESLAW \"der Lange\" Duke of Silesia in 1163 after the intervention of Emperor Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\" who obliged their uncle Duke Bolesław IV to recognise his and his brother's rights. Boleslaw took Breslau, Liegnitz and Oppeln and, on behalf of his youngest minor brother Konrad who was becoming a monk at Fulda, Glogau, Sagan and Krossen . Petry suggests that the formal division of territories between Boleslaw and his younger brother only took place after the death of their paternai uncle Boleslaw IV Duke of Poland in 1173 . The Epytaphia ducum Slezie record the death \"1201 VII Id Dec\" of \"Bolezlaus dux Altus dictus, fundator Lubensis\" . The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum specifies that he was buried \"in Porta supra Salam\" . The Chronica principum Polonie states that Boleslaw was buried \"in Lubens\" .\n\nm firstly (1142) SVENISLAVA Vsevolodovna of Kiev, daughter of VSEVOLOD II Olegovich Grand Prince of Kiev & his wife Maria Mstislavna of Kiev (-[1155/63]). The Chronica principum Polonie names \"quadam Ruthena Wentezlava\" as the first wife of \"Boleslaus\" . Baumgarten names the first wife of Duke Boleslaw and gives her origin but only cites one secondary source in support .\n\nm secondly CHRISTINA, daughter of --- (-21 Feb [1204/08], bur Kloster Pforte an der Saale). The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum names \"Adilheidis soror imperatricis, uxoris imperatoris Conradi II\" as stepmother of \"Ieroslaus filius Boleslai, fundatoris Lubensis cenobii\", specifying that the latter \"cum patruo suo Mesicone\" expelled his father . The Chronica principum Polonie also names \"Adilheidam, sororem imperatricis, coniugis Conradi secundi imperatoris\" as the second wife of \"Boleslaus\" . It is assumed that \"Conradi secundi imperatoris\" refers to Konrad III King of Germany, who was never crowned emperor but if he had been would have been Emperor Konrad II. King Konrad's first marriage is estimated to [1115], so his first wife can be excluded as any of her sisters would have been too old to have been the wife of Boleslaw. King Konrad's second wife was Gertrud von Sulzbach, daughter of Berengar [I] Graf von Sulzbach. However, Graf Berengar's death is estimated to [1125], which also makes it unlikely that he could have been the father of the second wife of Boleslaw. No record has been found of Graf Berengar's second wife (who was the mother of Gertrud) having married again after her husband died, so it is unlikely that there were any uterine siblings of Gertrud. No suitable explanation has been found for this alleged origin of Boleslaw's second wife and these passages should be treated with caution. The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum specifies that \"Adelheydis\" died after her husband and was buried with him \"in Porta supra Salam\" . The name of the second wife of Boleslaw is confirmed by the Epytaphia ducum Slezie which record the death \"IX Kal Mar\" of \"Christina uxor eiusdem funddatoris [=Bolezlaus dux Altus dictus] secunda\" .\n\nBoleslaw & his first wife had two children:\n\n1. JAROSLAW (after 1142-22 Mar 1201). The Chronica principum Polonie names \"duos filios Jaroslaum, Boleslaum et filiam Algam\" as the children of Boleslaw and his first wife \"quadam Ruthena Wentezlava\" . The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum names \"Ieroslaus filius Boleslai, fundatoris Lubensis cenobii\" specifying that the latter \"cum patruo suo Mesicone\" expelled his father through hatred for his stepmother \"Adilheidis soror imperatricis, uxoris imperatoris Conradi II\", but when his father returned with military support Jarolslaw was installed as Bishop of Neisse and received the duchy of Oppeln for life . The passage in question should probably be treated with some caution as (Emperor) Konrad II died in 1152, when Boleslaw's son Jaroslaw would have been under ten years old and so unlikely to have engineered his father's expulsion. It is possible that the expulsion in question was that of Jaroslaw's grandfather, Duke Władysław II, which may conceivably had some relation with his own stepmother, although she was not named Adelheid nor was she apparently related to Emperor Konrad's wife. Bishop of Breslau 1198. The Annales Capituli Cracoviensis record the death in 1201 of \"Bolezlaus dux Zlesie et Iarozlaus filius suus episcopus Wratizlavensis\" .\n\n2.

DUKES of LIEGNITZ [LEGNICA] 1278-1675 (PIAST)\n\nThe city of Legnica [Liegnitz] is situated on the Olna river, a tributary of the Oder which it joins upstream from Wrocław [Breslau]. Located in the central part of Lower Silesia, the duchy of Liegnitz formed part of the territories allocated to Boleslaw II Duke of Lower Silesia at the partition agreed with his brothers in the mid-1240s. When Boleslaw died in 1278, Liegnitz was inherited by his eldest son Duke Heinrich V. It was united with the duchy of Breslau in 1290 when the townspeople of Wrocław preferred Heinrich V to Heinrich Duke of Glogau, the nominated successor of Heinrich IV \"Probus\" Duke of Breslau. After Heinrich Vs son and successor, Duke Boleslaw III, reached the age of majority he was obliged to transfer Breslau to his younger brother Heinrich VI. Both brothers swore allegiance to Jan King of Bohemia after he invaded Silesia in 1327. Liegnitz survived as an autonomous duchy under Bohemian and later Austrian suzerainty until the death aged 15 in 1675 of Duke Georg Wilhelm when it passed under Habsburg direct rule."
