So many features were unfortunately taken away with the update. Not sure why because I donât think any of it was doing anyone harm.\n\nI, like many others who use this app, am a musician and use it for practice purposes all the time and the most useful features were taken away. Examples:\n\nâ¢Double tapping to go backwards or forward 10 seconds has been removed. Now I have to touch and glide my finger and it never quite lines up, so I can never get it back exactly where I want it to be.\n\nâ¢Saving tempo and key changes has been removed. In all of my favorites and stored songs I had several key changes that could be saved so I donât have to fiddle with it each time I line up my songs in the queueâ¦UGH?! Why?!\n\nâ¢Wonât start from the beginning after pressing play. At any given point during a song you could hit the back button and start from the beginning. That has been removed. Now I have to use my finger to glide it back to the beginning and it never starts on the first tee. It always skipped the first couple seconds. Very annoying and strange and again, why did you remove that?!\n\nAnyways, a bit heartbreaking that I updated but maybe theyâll change it back one day.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHi there! All these features are still available, would you mind getting in touch at support@karafun.fr so we can help you use them? :) Thanks!"
