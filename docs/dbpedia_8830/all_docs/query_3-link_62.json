And yes, this is not a joke article.\n\nStoryline[]\n\nAfter events of many of Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, and Wario's adventure, Bowser had a new plan. Bowser used dark energy found deep in the dungeon of Bowser's Castle. With that energy Bowser, Petey Piranha, and the rest of the army became more powerful. They had captured the 5 heroes leaving room for only one hero who must save them. Pianta.\n\nAfter each world, a cutscene of that boss losing there Dark Energy and escaping back to Bowser's Castle from a Airship takes place. Once you get to the last 2 worlds that changes. In World 7, once the boss escapes, Pianta looks out into the distance to see Bowser's Castle.\n\nOnce Bowser is defeated, he looses all the Dark Energy and falls to the ground knocked out. He drops a key that Pianta then uses to free the heroes. They return to the Mushroom Kingdom. Pianta then waves goodbye and leaves to return to Isle Delfino.\n\nIf you collected all 7 Star Keys, you can fight Dark Bowser. He was the source of Dark Energy. Using the Star Keys, you can transform into a more powerful Pianta. You must fly around and use the Star Sword to shoot beams at Dark Bowser, or slash him. Once he is defeated, Pianta returns to Bowser's Castle as the Dark Energy is annihilated and explodes destroying Dark Bowser once and for all.\n\nCharacters[]\n\nPlayables[]\n\nCharacter Picture Character Info The unexpected hero!
