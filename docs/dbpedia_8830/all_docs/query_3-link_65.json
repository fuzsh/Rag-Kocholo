        "text": "Quick UltraStar DX setup reference guide\n\nHello folks! This page is here to help you quickly set-up Ultrastar Deluxe, and get ready to sing.\n\nIf you ever need more information, please either ask on our forums or the official Ultrastar Wiki.\n\nSetting up the software\n\nDownload UltraStar Deluxe from the official website. The installation is pretty self-forward.\n\nJust click âNextâ.\n\nRemember the destination folder. That's where you'll need to copy the song files later on.\n\nA few things to note on this screen.\n\nFor the best possible experience, use the game in Fullscreen mode and select your screen's native resolution (optimal ratio = 16:9).\n\nIf you plan to use other song packs with Ultrastar, set âTABSâ on. This will make it easier to browse the available songs. I suggest sorting either by Folder, or by Edition.\n\nInstalling the song pack\n\nThis is done simply by copying over files to your UltraStar installation folder.\n\nIf you've ever played Stepmania before, the process is similar.\n\nGo to the installation folder, and locate its /song/ subfolder.\n\nThis folder will contain all your song packs (usually, âEditionsâ).\n\nPlease note that song files are not directly copied into this folder, you need to take a few extra steps.\n\nCopy the song folders here. Each song folder will contain various files (mp3, video, pictures, and a raw TXT file).\n\nThats it! You're ready to go!\n\nQuick tree overview of the directory structure.\n\nIn-game configuration\n\nYou can tweak a few more game settings while in the game.\n\nThe game's options are located in the âToolsâ menu.\n\nThere are a lot of available settings. Explore and experiment!\n\nThis is probably the most important thing to set-up: your microphone (in the âRecordâ tab).\n\nFirst line: select your sound capture device. I'm using a Logitech USB microphone here, from a PS3 Rock Band kit.\n\nSecond line: additionnal options according to your sound capture device. Nothing specific in this case.\n\nThird line: select which player will use that device. In this screenshot, âPlayer 1â will be using the USB microphone. In the case of official Singstar microphones (wired or wireless), you'll see two âChannelsâ lines here, one per microphone (âChannel1â is the Blue microphone, âChannel2â is the red one).\n\nSelect a theme. I like the Deluxe/ Ribbon one, which features a clean video background!\n\nIn the âLyricsâ setting, you can adjust how the text will be displayed in the game.\n\nThis is my take on it. Pick anything you find enjoyable.\n\nAll set! Head over to the game itself, and beat these high scores!"
