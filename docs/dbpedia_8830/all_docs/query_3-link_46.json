        "text": "Vocals\n\nPick up your microphone and start singing. The game won't just score your performance but your pitch is constantly displayed so you can correct the mistakes and actually learn to sing... And then beat your friends in multiplayer mode, or do a duet with someone you love :)\n\nFor those who sing rather than well (or who just want more artistic freedom), a karaoke mode is provided. In this mode only lyrics are displayed and there are no notes or scoring.\n\nGuitar and drums\n\nPick up your keyboard like this... Or if you prefer, connect one of those guitar controllers you can buy for almost nothing at your local gaming store. Playing a plastic guitar with five buttons sure isn't like the real thing but it just happens to be a good deal easier to learn and thus a hit at your party. Just make sure that the guys holding your guitar controllers allow others to play too.\n\nPlaying drums is like the real thing, especially if you happen to be lucky enough to have one of those professional MIDI drum sets. For the rest of us the el cheapo band game controllers will have to do.\n\nDance\n\nLet the rhythm guide your feet when you show your dance moves on a dance pad, or just be a geek and use the keypad with your fingers instead. The graphics ain't hot yet but nonetheless you can dance all the same.\n\nFeatures\n\nVocals, guitars (lead/rhythm/bass), drums and dancing with multiplayer support\n\nExtremely good singing pitch detection (usable even with laptop or webcam microphones)\n\nIntelligent gameplay determines what the player attempted to do\n\nAvoid accidental hammer-ons / pull-offs, among other things\n\nNo more \"wtf, I didn't make any mistake there\" feeling\n\nControllers are autodetected (no need to configure keys)\n\nSong formats: FoF, UltraStar, SingStar XML, StepMania\n\nC++ for high performance, rapid development and solid code\n\nOpenGL 2.1 and SVG for nice graphics\n\nFree software, licensed under GNU GPL version 2 or later\n\nRequirements"
