        "text": "This page is for good quality software on GNU/Linux platforms based on the contributions of /g/ users. Please be aware that most games do not have a native port for GNU/Linux and therefore are not officially supported. A lot of Windows games, however, can be played through Wine with no degradation in quality, such as with Furcadia. Other games, such as Strange Flesh has a degregation of quality, due to lack of proprietary fonts. Otherwise, it runs well. In the past few years Wine and Proton have come very far with over 75% of the top thousand Steam games including games like The Witcher 3 and DOOM (2016) running with near native performance, many of the games that don't work usually have issues due to anti-cheat. However, if your computer is powerful enough, and you are willing to do some reading, with effort, you can spin up a VM and use PCI passthrough to get these games working and replace the need to dual-boot. DosBox is available for GNU/Linux as well.\n\nGames\n\nSee also: Games\n\nOpen Source\n\nFirst Person Shooter\n\nAlien Arena\n\nAlien Arena runs on the CRX Gaming Engine.

Primary focus is arcade systems, with console compatibility a happy accident due to them often sharing hardware. Focuses on accuracy, compatibility varies wildly.

They also develop their own open-source compatibility layer called Proton which is based on Wine, it works very well with an increasing number of windows games.\n\nInstallation\n\nInstalling Steam on GNU/Linux is pretty straight forward. Using Linux Mint 17.2 as an example:\n\nOpen the Software Manager.\n\nSearch for Steam.\n\nInstall the steam-launcher package.\n\nRun the Steam Launcher from the Application Menu, under Games.\n\nRead/Accept the Steam Install Agreement.\n\nThe launcher will download and install Steam. This is about 200mb.\n\nLogin to your account/create one.\n\nInstalling games\n\nIn the games section of the store, use the controls on the right to Narrow by Operating System and select Linux / SteamPlay.\n\nSelect the game, buy it if it's not free, and click Play Game.\n\nYou'll see the size of the game download, hit Next.\n\nYou'll have options to create shortcuts in the Application Menu and Desktop. Select whatever and hit Next.\n\nHit Finish.\n\nMonitor the download by click the \"Downloading\" status bar at the bottom of the screen.\n\nIf the download is slow, you can try changing the download server in View > Settings, Downloads, Download region. This will require a restart of Steam.\n\nOnce the game finishes downloading, the shortcuts will be available to launch the game.\n\nLutris\n\nLutris is an open-source game launcher written in Python for GNU/Linux which allows users to install games from a variety of platforms (runners) using ready available optimized community scripts. It supports launching games from emulators such as Dolphin and RPCS3 and linking to your Steam, GOG and Humble Bundle libraries allowing you to install and play your games straight away. Launchers like Battle.net and Epic Games Launcher can be installed through Wine in Lutris too and games like Overwatch can be played.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf games run slowly/have a low framerate, make sure you're using the official drivers for your GPU.\n\nFor nVidia GPUs, install the up-to-date drivers and then reboot. These drivers are often proprietary.\n\nFor even newer nVidia drivers or ATI drivers, check Ubuntu's Steam Wiki Page.\n\nIf you are having trouble with one game in particular, check the Steam GNU/Linux Forums or if you are running the game through Proton and having issues check the ProtonDB."
