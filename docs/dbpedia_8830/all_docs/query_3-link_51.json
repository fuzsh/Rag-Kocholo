It is the third home console installment in the series and the seventh overall. It was first released in November 20, 2015 in Europe and North America. Up to four players can locally play the game.\n\nThe game, as an installment in the Mario Tennis series, features traditional tennis gameplay with various Super Mario franchise elements mixed in. It features nine stadium-themed courts with various different gimmicks and retains several gameplay elements from two predecessors, Mario Power Tennis and Mario Tennis Open, while introducing Mega Battles, Jump Shots, and the titular Ultra Smash; Mega Battle is a mode where players can grow larger from picking up Mega Mushrooms to increase their offense and defensive capabilities, while Jump Shots enable players to leap into the air to perform faster and more powerful shots. The Ultra Smash is a special kind of shot that can only be performed when the opposing player loses form while returning a shot, and allows players to return the ball with an extremely fast and powerful smash shot, acting as a punishment mechanic. The Wii U GamePad is taken advantage of in two-player singles, allowing a second player to use a separate screen for the perspective of their character.[4] The software required 888 MB to be downloaded and installed from the Nintendo eShop until the game was eventually removed after the service's discontinuation on March 27, 2023. The game also features amiibo support, allowing players to use compatible amiibo to train it and play with a CPU-controlled character.\n\nThe game featured worldwide online multiplayer for the first time in the Mario Tennis series. Up to four players (including an amiibo) could use the game's online capabilities to play Singles and Doubles with people around the world over Nintendo Network. The service, however, was terminated on April 8, 2024, making the game no longer playable online.[5]\n\nGameplay[edit]\n\nThe game is played similarly to previous entries of the Mario Tennis series, and follows the basic rules of tennis. Players serve and hit the ball back and forth until one side misses the ball. Players earn 15 points for each successful shot, and win a game point if a player scores in their 40th point. If players are tied after the 40-point mark, a deuce commences, and either player has to score two consecutive points to win a game point. Winning a number of game points makes the player victorious in a set or a match. Matches can be divided into sets. If two players tie in a set, a Tiebreaker commences, where one player must reach seven points to win the set or match.\n\nPlayers can use the Wii U GamePad, Wii Pro Controller, or Wii Remote on its side to play the game. The game does not support motion controls for the Wii Remote, so the Wii Remote on its side is the only control option for it.[7]\n\nThe game works with amiibo. When a compatible amiibo is scanned into the game, that character appears in the game as a computer partner that can be trained,[4] similar to Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U. After every five matches in Knockout Challenge, it earns a random stat boost, and the amiibo character can get 10 in total. Players can access the amiibo training menu to change up stats, however, by spending coins to alter stat slots.[8] amiibo partners make it possible to play on 2 vs. 1 matches, though only with CPU opponents, making it the first and only Mario Tennis game where 2 vs. 1 matches are possible.[9]\n\nUnlike other installments, Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash does not provide a left-handed option.\n\nTypes of shots[edit]\n\nAll of the main five types of shots can be charged, in order to increase their power, by pressing the button or button combination before the ball arrives. While charging, movements are slower, so if the player needs it, the charge can be canceled by pressing . All of the main five type of shots also have a Chance Shot version, activated by going in a colored area and executing the shot of the respective color.\n\nFurthermore, Topspins, Slices, and Flats, in both the standard and Chance Shot version, can be performed as Jump Shots, executed by tapping the button corresponding to the shot twice, in which the character leaps before hitting the ball, resulting in shots that bounce higher.\n\nShot Button(s) Description Topspin Topspins are high shots that spin forward and bounce high. The Chance Shot version pushes the receiving opponent back. They leave a red trail and have the outline of a Fire Flower in the Chance Shot area. Slice Slices are low shots with backspin. They are slow and bounce low. The Chance Shot version has a deeply curved trajectory and spins the receiving opponent out of control for a short while. They leave a blue trail and have the outline of a Blooper in the Chance Shot area. Flat Flats are the fastest shots and don't make the ball spin. The Chance Shot version is a Smash. They leave a purple trail and have the outline of a star in the Chance Shot area. Lob → Lobs are very high shots with a high bounce aimed at the back of the court. The Chance Shot version is higher. They leave a yellow trail and have the outline of a Cheep Cheep in the Chance Shot area. Drop Shot → Drop Shots are low shots with a low bounce aimed at the front of the court. The Chance Shot version doesn't bounce. They leave a white trail and have the outline of a Bob-omb in the Chance Shot area. Simple Shot Simple Shots are version of all the five shots types that take longer time to charge, chosen automatically once the button for the Simple Shot is pressed. They can be used on Chance Shot areas as well, resulting in the correct type of shot being chosen automatically. They leave a light yellow trail. Leap Shot Leap Shots are shots in which the character leaps in an attempt to hit a distant ball. They very often result in high and slow Simple Shots.\n\nUltra Smash[edit]\n\nIf the opponent has made a mistake that results in a slow ball flying high in the air, a Special Chance Shot area appears. If the player performs a Jump Flat on said Chance Shot area an Ultra Smash is performed, resulting in a more powerful Smash.\n\nGame modes[edit]\n\nThe game offers various game modes. It includes Mega Battle, Classic Tennis, Knockout Challenge, and Online play.\n\nMega Battle[edit]\n\nThe default mode is the Mega Battle mode,[10] where Mega Mushrooms are randomly thrown into the court by a Toad that patrols each side, after a player serves the ball. If players run into a Mega Mushroom, they grow huge and get an advantage in ball stroke and ball reach. In doubles play, only one player per side can grow large at a time. This mode is for up to four players, and can be played with human- or computer-controlled opponents.\n\nClassic Tennis[edit]\n\nThis is where tennis is played normally without Mega Mushrooms.[10] Standard mode has the Chance and Jump Shots, while Simple mode lacks Chance and Jump shots and is therefore pure tennis like Mario Tennis games prior to Mario Tennis Open, without Special or Chance Shots.[11][12] This mode is also for up to four players, and can be played with human or computer-controlled opponents.\n\nKnockout Challenge[edit]\n\nKnockout Challenge is a single-player mode that replaces the Tournament modes from earlier installments of the Mario Tennis series.[10] Players try to beat an increasing number of CPU opponents, who gradually get harder over time.[8] The order of opponents is as follows: Toad, Luigi, Daisy, Yoshi, Wario, Sprixie Princess, Toadette, Boo, Peach, Waluigi, Donkey Kong, Bowser Jr., Rosalina, Mario, and Bowser (Dry Bowser in the 2nd sequence). Then the sequence repeats. After the 2nd sequence, the opponents will be randomized (though they'll never face the same opponent more than once in a row). If the player uses Toad or has Toad as an amiibo partner, the CPU-controlled Toad is substituted with Toadette. If the player uses one of the other characters or has one of the other characters as an amiibo partner, that character in the sequence is replaced by Toad. If the player uses Bowser or has Bowser as an amiibo partner, the CPU-controlled Bowser is substituted with Dry Bowser. If the player uses Dry Bowser, the CPU-controlled Dry Bowser is substituted with Bowser. If the player uses Dry Bowser and has Bowser as an amiibo partner, the CPU-controlled Bowser and Dry Bowser are substituted with Bowser Jr. The matches, by default, are Mega Battles (and Standard Tennis after the 2nd sequence) with Tiebreaker rules; the player has to win seven rounds in order to claim game victory. With every battle won, players earn coins, which can be spent on buying unlockables, such as star characters and courts.[8] amiibo characters can help the single players out; however, other human players cannot help the single-player.\n\nMega Ball Rally[edit]\n\nThe sole minigame of Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash, players rally a large ball for the highest score possible. After every 30 rallies, the ball gets smaller.[10][8] It can be played solo or for up to four players. When the game ends, players receive coins depending on how much the ball has been rallied.\n\nWhen the minigame ends, the music that plays depends on the number of players. In single-player mode, the losing music will play; however, in multiplayer mode, the victory music will play instead.\n\nOnline[edit]\n\nOnline can be played alone or with another player or amiibo character in Singles or Doubles. The game does not support lobbies or communities, whereas the only options are Singles and Doubles.[8] Similarly to Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U, online play is split into two categories: Play for Fun and Play a Serious Match. Play a Serious Match settings lets players play in ranked settings to grow their standing compared to their online opponents, whereas, Play for Fun still sets up matches based on online ratings, but these ratings are not affected in this mode.[8] Players can choose to play a Mega Battle, Standard match, or Simple match. They can also choose whether to play a tiebreaker game or a two-game, one set match.

In addition, Toad is playable in the Mario Tennis series for the first time since the Nintendo 64 installment, while Dry Bowser is playable for the first time in a home console Mario Tennis installment after previously being playable in Mario Tennis Open. Of the character-types, there are three All-Round, two Speed, two Technical, four Power, two Defensive, and three Tricky. The unlockable characters, in addition to the \"standard\" unlock methods, can be unlocked by purchasing them (using coins earned during gameplay) off the rewards menu. This is the last game to feature Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Waluigi in their normal clothing, as the next game, Mario Tennis Aces, would depict them with tennis uniforms.\n\nAll-Round: These characters have neither distinct advantages nor disadvantages.\n\nTechnical: These characters have good ball control, but often lack power.\n\nSpeed: These characters have quick movement at the cost of power.\n\nPower: These characters have powerful strokes that makes the ball travel quickly, but they lack agility.\n\nDefensive: These characters have great reach but are not agile.\n\nTricky: These characters' shots curve more than other characters' shots.\n\nAdditionally, using the Gold Mario amiibo gives players a CPU-controlled Gold Mario as a tennis partner.\n\nDefault[edit]\n\nCharacter Skill Type\n\nMario All-Round\n\nLuigi All-Round\n\nToad Speed\n\nPeach Technical\n\nDaisy All-Round\n\nRosalina (new) Power\n\nBowser Power\n\nWario Power\n\nWaluigi Defensive\n\nYoshi Speed\n\nBoo Tricky\n\nDonkey Kong Power\n\nUnlockable[edit]\n\nCharacter Skill type Unlock condition\n\nToadette (new) Tricky Play 10 Mega Battles or buy for 5,000 coins in the rewards menu\n\nBowser Jr. Tricky Play 10 standard matches in Classic Tennis mode or buy for 5,000 coins in the rewards menu\n\nDry Bowser Defensive Play 10 simple matches in Classic Tennis mode or buy for 5,000 coins in the rewards menu\n\nSprixie Princess (new) Technical Hit 100 consecutive shots in Mega Ball Rally or buy for 5,000 coins in the rewards menu\n\nNon-playable characters[edit]\n\nThese characters appear in the background as part of the crowd as world-building scenery.

During Mega Battles, a Toad can, at random intervals, toss a Mega Mushroom into the court.

When amiibo level up after completing a set amount of matches, a random stat out of the eight stats get enhanced. In addition, each stat has its own slot limitations: for example, an amiibo character cannot have more than three speed stats in their inventory. Once all ten stat slots are filled, the amiibo cannot obtain any more stats though players can remove gained stats for a fee of 5,000 coins, so the slot can be filled by another stat. These are the following stats that can be enhanced:\n\nStroke (Three slots) - \"Increases the power of your amiibo character's strokes.\"\n\nServe (Two slots) - \"Increases the power of your amiibo character's serve and smash.\"\n\nAcceleration (Two slots) - \"Increases your amiibo character's acceleration speed.\"\n\nSpeed (Three slots) - \"Increases your amiibo character's maximum speed.\"\n\nCurve (Three slots) - \"Improves your amiibo character's ability to curve the ball.\"\n\nAgility (Four slots) - \"Quickens your amiibo character's reaction to the ball.\"\n\nControl (Two slots) - \"Improves your amiibo character's accuracy when aiming for corners.\"\n\nSkill (Three slots) - \"Improves your amiibo character's ability to use various shots and spins.\"\n\nStaff[edit]\n\nMain article: List of Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash staff\n\nMario Tennis: Ultra Smash was developed by Camelot Software Planning, who was responsible for developing all Mario Tennis titles, with assistance from Nintendo. Shugo Takahashi has directed the game, who was also the director of the previous title, Mario Tennis Open. The lead designers were also Shugo Takashi and Hiroyuki Takahashi. Motoi Sakuraba once again is responsible for the soundtrack for the game, as he was in other Mario Tennis titles. Just like in Mario Party 10, Rosalina's former voice actress Kerri Kane is mistakenly credited (misspelled as Kerry Kane), however most of the voices are recycled from Mario Kart 8, including Rosalina's, and she was voiced by Laura Faye Smith in that game.\n\nReception[edit]\n\nCritical reception[edit]\n\nMario Tennis: Ultra Smash received mixed reviews from critics with aggregate scores of 58 from 58 critics on Metacritic[15] and 55.78% based on 36 reviews on GameRankings.[16] Reviewers praised the graphics and presentation, but lambasted the stark lack of overall content and basic features, both offline and online, calling it bare-bones, especially when compared to the previous Mario Tennis games. Chris Carter of Destructoid was severely disappointed and harshly criticized the game, noting the lack of content, the forgettable Jump Shot and Mega Battle features, and the lack of lobbies or other extra features.[17] He ends by saying that players are \"better off just playing any other previous game in the series, which is particularly easy to do since the first game is on the Wii U's Virtual Console for just 10 bucks.\" He gave the game a 5.5/10. Marty Sliva of IGN had a similar opinion, stating that \"Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash is about as paint-by-numbers as you can get. The lack of modes, characters, and new ideas make it a step backwards from the series' debut on the Nintendo 64 back in 2000.\" He cites the Mega Mushroom feature as bad and gimmicky, appearing to be arbitrary and imbalanced. He also compared it unfavorably to its predecessors by stating \"that Mario Power Tennis on the GameCube managed to include more characters, interesting modes, and varied courses a decade ago is a bit insulting.\" He gave it 4.8/10, a score labeled as \"bad\". Kyle Hilliard of Game Informer expressed similar disappointment about the game's content, praising the game's core gameplay and the addition of Ultra Smashes and Jump Shots for being solid and fun but wishing the game offered much more.[18]\n\nReviews Release Reviewer, Publication Score Comment Wii U Chris Carter, Destructoid 5.5/10 \"There's no two ways about it -- Ultra Smash is a bare-bones game. If you came to this court expecting anything other than basic tennis, you will walk away disappointed. And even then, it doesn't handle the basics as well as its predecessors.\" Wii U Marty Sliva, IGN 4.8/10 \"Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash is as stripped-down a Nintendo sports game as I've ever played. The absence of modes, unimpressive unlockables, and tiring hook offer very little reason to keep playing. Sure, it's pretty, but that’s about all it has going for it.\" Wii U Kyle Hilliard,\n\nGame Informer 6.75/10 \"Mario Tennis Ultra Smash offers that same fun, silly take on tennis, but it doesn't provide much outside of the well-executed core game.\" Wii U Game Trailers 5.7/10 \"Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash feels like an unfinished game. The shallow mechanics quickly grow tiresome, and this is further emphasized by the lack of game modes and creativity that we'd expect from a Mario sports game.\" Wii U Scott Butterworth, GameSpot 6/10 \"While Ultra Smash successfully recreates the basic mechanics that earned earlier titles Mario Tennis and Mario Power Tennis critical acclaim more than a decade ago, it fails to solve a handful of underlying design issues and omits much of the content offered by its predecessors.\" Wii U Daan Koopman, Nintendo World Report 3.5/10 \"Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash isn't good in the slightest. While the game can be decent in passing, it's a horrible value when you stop and think about it.\" Wii U Chris Schilling, Eurogamer N/A \"Mario Tennis Ultra Smash feels stingy. It's a disappointment akin to visiting a favourite restaurant and ordering your usual, only to find the portions are half the size they were last time you came. It tastes as good as you remember, but you still come away feeling short-changed.\" Wii U Shabana Arif, GamesRadar 3/5 \"Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash falls short of expectations, with scant content and glaringly overlooked potential features overshadowing the solid gameplay, which carries the game, but unfortunately, not far enough.\" Aggregators Compiler Platform / Score Metacritic 58 GameRankings 55.78%\n\nGallery[edit]\n\nFor this subject's image gallery, see Gallery:Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash.\n\nMario\n\nLuigi\n\nPrincess Peach\n\nTennis rackets, each with Mario and Peach's emblem on\n\nReferences to other games[edit]\n\nMario Power Tennis: The announcers' voice clips returns.\n\nNew Super Mario Bros.: The Mega Mushroom, which originated in this game, appears in the Mega Battle mode.\n\nMario Kart Wii: The characters' voices become slightly lower-pitched when a Mega Mushroom is active.\n\nNew Super Mario Bros.
