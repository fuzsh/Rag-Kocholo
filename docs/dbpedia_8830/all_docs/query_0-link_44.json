        "text": "I've been excited for AMD's next-gen Zen CPU architecture since day one, and that excitement has built up over the last 12 months into the official Ryzen CPU architecture AMD teased earlier this month.\n\nRyzen will rock up to 16 threads of CPU performance with an 8-core processor starting at 3.4GHz, and performance in the levels of the Core i7-6800K and 6900K from Intel. Now we're hearing that motherboard makers have been \"rather aggressive about placing orders\" for Ryzen-capable motherboards, as they \"believe demand for the new platform will increase AMD's share in the worldwide desktop processor market in the second quarter of 2017\", reports DigitTimes.\n\nBetter yet, we're getting an idea of how far along the Ryzen CPU and compatible motherboards are, with DigiTimes' report continuing: \"The sources pointed out that they have started receiving high-end X370, mainstream B350 and entry-level A320 chipsets from AMD and are now in the final stage of finishing related testing and motherboard designing\".\n\nAMD appears to be ringing in the New Year bell a little early this year, with a tease on the official Twitter account for Radeon, with a simple tweet of \"New Year. New architecture\", teasing its next-gen Vega GPU architecture.\n\nAMD recently held their Tech Summit 2016 event in Sonoma, California - with our first look at a Vega 10-based graphics card with 8GB of HBM2, capable of driving DOOM at 4K 60FPS+ on its highest graphics settings.\n\nIt was only a week ago that a Vega 10 GPU of some sort received RRA certification, but so did a 'Polaris 12' graphics chip, too. Performance wise, we should expect Titan X level performance from a Vega 10 graphics card with 8GB of HBM2, and most likely ready to compete against NVIDIA's unannounced and unconfirmed - but teased GeForce GTX 1080 Ti.\n\nIf there's one thing that electric cars need, it's faster charging - and it looks like that's in the immediate future for Tesla Motors. Elon Musk, or the real life Tony Stark, has teased that the next generation is Superchargers will be pushing somewhere above 350kW.\n\nMusk fielded some questions over Twitter, Fred Lambert suggesting that Supercharger V3 will have 350kW output - but Musk had the reply of a lifetime, teasing: \"A mere 350 kW ... what are you referring to, a children's toy?\". If Tesla does indeed hit a doubling in power output, charging up their growing family of electric cars could be faster than ever before.\n\nWe could be looking at a stop at the service station, or a specific carpark, being able to charge your Tesla electric vehicle in minutes - impressive stuff.\n\nLG will be teasing something really quite futuristic during CES 2017 next week, with an easily-named \"Levitating Portable Speaker\"... which is exactly what it sounds like - a levitating speaker.\n\nThe upcoming Levitating Portable Speaker is an egg-shaped Bluetooth unit that has a round base, something LG calls the Levitation Station. The aptly-named Levitation Station (seriously, give that person a raise) includes electromagnets that provide the floating effect, as well as a subwoofer for bass. LG touts 360-degree sound with a 10-hour battery life, and it's also rated IPX7 for water resistance.\n\nThe coolest thing out of it all is that the speaker will automatically descend into the base when it needs to recharge, and I will buy one as soon as I can to test that out. Awesome stuff, LG.\n\nWe've been reporting about Crytek more than ever before, with mostly bad things - but then a great spark of excitement from a nearly secured $500 million investment from the Turkish government - and now, we have confirmation on Crytek developers' unpaid wages.\n\nAccording to an industry insider friend of ours, TweakTown can exclusively reveal that Crytek will pay 100% of their unpaid staff to all unpaid staff by January 13, 2017. This is just over two weeks from now, which I'm sure will coincide with Crytek's recent $500 million deal with the Turkish government. Not only that, but Crytek reportedly holds no debt - which means it should effectively be very steady with this new load of cash coming in, for what will hopefully be a very long time.\n\nGoogle might be spending tens of millions of dollars on advertising for its new Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, but people are experiencing issues all over the place - including me. Even after AUD$1249 outright, to say I'm mad at the situation of my Pixel malfunctioning like this being disappointing, would be an understatement.\n\nIn the last week my Pixel has been really quite bad, matching up with reports online that Pixel owners have been having their phone freeze, and you can't do anything with it - and it takes up to 60 seconds before the phone starts working, very randomly. The only way to get out of it is to hard reset Pixel by pressing the power and volume down buttons at the same time, and holding them down for 10 seconds.\n\nNot only that, but I've been noticing glitches with the camera and the fingerprint sensor not recognizing my fingerprint. A few weeks ago I was sitting in the cinema watching Arrival and at the end of the movie, I went to unlock my Pixel with my fingerprint - which was rejected, and so was my 4-digit security code. I couldn't get into my Pixel at all, and had to hard reset and wipe the entire smartphone and start again.\n\nApple will be opening up its new spaceship campus is nearing completion, with a beautiful 4K video shot with his drone, providing a Christmas/New Year update for us all. Check it out.\n\nThe footage looks great, showing that Apple is using 100% renewable energy for the campus, with the entire ring around Apple's new HQ plastered with solar panels. Matthew Roberts, the person behind the 4K drone footage said that there's around 65% of the total solar panels installed so far.\n\nApple has designed the campus where it will feature 3000 specially designed, and engineered curved glass panels that will measure in at around one mile in circumference. Steve Jobs said during a Cupertino City Council meeting a few years ago: \"There's not a single straight piece of glass in this building. We've used our experience in building retail buildings all over the world. We know how to make the biggest pieces of glass for architectural use. And, we want to make the glass specifically for this building here. We can make it curve all the way around the building... It's pretty cool\".\n\nOculus is in the headlines for all the wrong reasons today, with Oculus' Head of Computer Vision Dov Katz being arrested in a sting involving a police officer who was posting as a 15-year-old girl.\n\nTechCrunch reports that Katz meeting with what he thought was a 15-year-old girl at Embassy Suites in Tukwila, Washington - aftrer he had text messaged the 15-year-old girl agreeing to pay $300 with her for sex without a condom. The police officer pretended to be a 19-year-old who, closer to the time of meeting Katz, said she was being honest and act ually a 15-year-old. The Oculus engineer responded saying \"sure\", adding: \"do you have another pic?\".\n\nSome sickening stuff right there, with Katz ending being arrested without incident, with $600 found in the room along with his smartphone. The police officer in question said he arrested Katz for 'Commercial sexual abuse of a minor', but Katz said he was a hero, and instead was \"there to rescue her and call the police\".\n\nCrytek have had a turbulent year, but with the news that Turkish government will be investing a massive $500 million into the German developer, something Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım announced on December 24, without naming Crytek.\n\nPM Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım did say that three brothers living in Germany, \"who own a leading company in the gaming sector, were planning to invest in Turkey during his speech at the \"Turkey's 500 Large Service Exporters\" ceremony\", according to reports.\n\nThe three brothers in question are Cevat, Avni, and Faruk Yerli - who founded Crytek in 1999. The company spread into Istanbul, Budapest, Kiev, Seoul, Shanghai, and Sofia, but closed 5 of them just days ago. Crytek recently said the closures were so that it could refocus on its core strengths, developing innovating games and the technology that drives them.\n\nThe holidays can be an interesting time, with Intel rumored to be retiring its Core family of processors in 2019 with the release of Tiger Lake, which will be succeeded with a more efficient, faster approach to the x86 architecture.\n\nBitsandchips.it is reporting that Intel's next CPU family will be similar to what AMD has done with its Zen architecture, blending in power consumption/performance /price - and in order to save physical space (smaller die), and improve the power consumption/performance ratio, Intel will reportedly get rid of old SIMD and legacy hardware.\n\nThis means that we might not have 100% backwards compatibility, but these CPUs won't be here until 2020 - a long time from now. Intel will be able to make a lean, efficient x86 architecture that will compete with AMD's nearly-here Zen architecture. What I'm taking away from this is that AMD will be ahead of the game for a few years until Intel can get their act together with a new architecture to begin competing against the star-studded launch of Zen."
