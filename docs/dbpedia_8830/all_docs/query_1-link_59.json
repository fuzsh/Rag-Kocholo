My main interests are\n\nfigurative language use and the evolution of technology. My main goal in\n\nwriting is entertainment and in science is novelty. I’m more of the former\n\nthan the latter and more of a fan than a critic. I’m an aging\n\nBMX/skateboard zine kid. That’s where I learned to turn events and\n\ninterviews into pages with staples. The pages and staples have long since\n\ngiven way to text-links and scrollbars, but the rest is basically the\n\nsame. I still ride bikes, and I still skateboard. I do still commit quite\n\na bit to actual pages, too.\n\nMy main project from 1997 to 2007 was\n\nfrontwheeldrive.com. With that site, I established myself as what\n\nDisinformation called, “One of the Internet’s leading interviewers of\n\nsubculture and new-science icons.” I was most recently assistant editor of\n\nPaul D. Miller a.k.a. DJ Spooky’s edited collection ‘Sound Unbound:\n\nSampling Digital Culture and Music’ (MIT Press, 2008). My first book is an\n\nanthology interviews entitled ‘Follow for Now: Interviews with Friends and\n\nHeroes’ (Well-Red Bear, 2007), which Disinformation named one of the most\n\nimportant books published in 2007, and which Erik Davis called, “a crisp\n\nand substantial remix of the major memes of the last decade or so.”\n\nI hold a master’s degree in Communication Theory from San Diego State University\n\nand am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Communication Studies at The\n\nUniversity of Texas at Austin. Prior to graduate work, I earned a\n\nbachelor’s degree in Social Science, and spent over twenty years working\n\nas a writer, editor, and designer both on- and off-line. I have written\n\nabout technology, science, music, and culture for everything from glossy\n\nnational magazines and regional weeklies to hometown newspapers and\n\nhomegrown ‘zines, and I have written, edited, designed, and consulted for\n\nsuch diverse organizations as Microsoft, Nike, The MIT Press, MSN Music,\n\nESPN, the United States Army, Xbox, and Zero Skateboards.

During that time, EMI led the industry by embracing and exploiting new technologies and business models such as digital downloads and online music subscriptions, custom compilations, wireless services, high-definition audio and Internet radio.\n\nIn addition to seeking out, evaluating and executing business opportunities for the company on a global basis, Cohen served as both a strategist and key decision-maker for EMI’s global new media and anti-piracy efforts. He worked to establish company-wide digital policies, which have provided EMI’s artists and labels a substantial advantage in the digital music arena.\n\nPrior to his role at EMI, Cohen served as Executive Vice President of Digital Music Network Inc., where he co-founded and served as Chairman of the groundbreaking Webnoize conferences.\n\nCohen also led two highly successful new media consulting operations, DMN Consulting and Consulting Adults, attracting clients such as Amazon.com, Microsoft, Universal Studios, DreamWorks Records, Liquid Audio, Wherehouse Records/Checkout.com and various other entertainment, technology and new media organizations.

That’s where the\n\nband has come to reside, musically: deep in the pocket, that ever-elusive, funky trench\n\nwhere a band can entrance an audience, hypnotize it and hold on to it until the set or CD\n\nis finished.

Slightly Stoopid has built a large n’ loyal fan base, and has soared to one of the\n\nmost successful independent artists of this decade. The buzz surrounding the group\n\ncontinues to increase with each successive release; their album catalog sales have topped\n\nthe 700,000 mark and the group continues to fill the most prestigious concert venues\n\naround the world, and continues to create a legion of “Stoopidheads” in the process!

She uses a cello and a foot-controlled laptop to record layer upon layer of cello, creating intricate, haunting and compelling music.

She has been profiled on NPR’s All Things Considered, named a Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum, elected a governor of the San Francisco chapter of the Recording Academy and awarded a performing arts grant from the Creative Capital Foundation. Born in Canada and classically trained from the age of eight, Zoë spent her 20’s working at software startups while moonlighting as a cellist in rock bands.

That’s where the\n\nband has come to reside, musically: deep in the pocket, that ever-elusive, funky trench\n\nwhere a band can entrance an audience, hypnotize it and hold on to it until the set or CD\n\nis finished.

The buzz surrounding the group\n\ncontinues to increase with each successive release; their album catalog sales have topped\n\nthe 700,000 mark and the group continues to fill the most prestigious concert venues\n\naround the world, and continues to create a legion of “Stoopidheads” in the process!\n\nMike McGuire\n\nGartner, Research VP, Media\n\nMike McGuire is a research vice president for Gartner, Inc.’s Media Industry Advisory Services team.
