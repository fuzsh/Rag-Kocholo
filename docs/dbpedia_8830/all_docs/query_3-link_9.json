        "text": "UltraStar Play is a singing game with boundless possibilities because you can create and add your\n\nown songs.\n\nLinks\n\nBack it now on Kickstarter: Kickstarter.com\n\nWebsite: Ultrastar-play.com\n\nDiscord: Discord.gg\n\nYouTube: Youtube.com\n\nTLDR\n\nGameplay is similar to SingStar but with custom songs. And it runs on PC and mobile.\n\nOpen Source on Kickstarter, why?\n\nIt's good for you as a Unity dev AND the game itself.\n\nDevelopment needs time to finish most wanted features and create a proper release on Steam, Google Play, and the Apple App Store. With funding, this could be done in month. Without, it could take years or may never happen.\n\nAbout the Game\n\nIn UltraStar Play you sing along your favorite songs and try to hit notes for points. Feel like a\n\nsuperstar while you break the highscore! Invite your family and friends to rock the virtual stage\n\ntogether!\n\nCompanion App\n\nJump right to the fun, without the need to buy additional microphones, thanks to the UltraStar Play Companion App!\n\nWith the Companion App you can use your smartphone as microphone and browse the song list while others are still singing. A nice booster for the game flow.\n\nOf course other mics can also be used, for example from headsets or USB microphones.\n\nSong Editor\n\nUltraStar Play itself does not include any songs!\n\nInstead, it enables you to create a sing-along version of songs by yourself! Therefor, it builds on an established, simple, and open song format. Use the integrated song editor to create what you want.\n\nHey, I remember UltraStar Deluxe\n\nUltraStar Play follows in the footsteps of previous UltraStar games. It keeps the fun game play but\n\nimplemented on top of modern tools. This allows the game to evolve faster and build it not only for\n\ndesktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) but also for mobile devices (Android, iOS).\n\nUltraStar Play is an evolution, building on the widespread song format of its predecessors.\n\nCurrent Features\n\n• Open Song Format: UltraStar Play supports a widespread and open song format. Create\n\nand change songs as you please.\n\n• Song Editor: The integrated song editor lets you create a sing-along version of any song\n\nyou like.\n\n• Demo Songs: UltraStar Play itself does not include any songs due to copyright issues.\n\nHowever, there is a song package under Creative Commons license that can be downloaded\n\nin game.\n\n• Companion App: Use your smartphone as mic or browse the song list with the UltraStar\n\nPlay Companion App.\n\n• Solos, Duets, Groups: Sing a duet where each player has different lyrics and notes. Or\n\nthrow a party and sing with up to 16 players at the same time.\n\n• Playlists & Favorites: Handle large song collections by marking songs as favorites, adding\n\nplaylists, or searching for songs by language, year, artist, etc.\n\n• Entertained Audience: Each song can have a background video or image. A delight for\n\nboth, the audience and the singers.\n\n• Score Modes: A cooperative score mode emphasizes SINGING TOGETHER with your\n\nloved ones. You can also turn off scores and ratings completely.\n\n• Controller Support: No need to hang around your keyboard. Just use your gamepad to\n\ncontrol UltraStar Play.\n\nPlanned Features on Kickstarter\n\n• Party Modes: Play multiple rounds in teams or free-for-all with fun modifiers to the regular\n\ngame\n\n• Smartphone Control: Better event management by configuring players, microphones and\n\nfollowing songs using the Companion App while others are still playing.\n\n• Medleys: Select multiple songs to sing a shortened mix of these.\n\n• Online Multiplayer: Play together over the internet. Note that due to copyright issues, only\n\nsongs will be eligible that are available locally on each player’s device.\n\nOpen Source Solutions for Unity\n\nAn investment in UltraStar Play is also an investment in open source solutions for the Unity game engine.\n\nSo far, the development of UltraStar Play has led to libraries for translation, dependency injection, scene change animation, and a simple HTTP server library for Unity.\n\nBut there are even more interesting parts of UltraStar Play that could be turned into reusable libraries, for example the automatic smartphone connection when in the same local area network, real-time microphone recording and playback, or Material Design and Bootstrap Icons for UIToolkit.\n\nPlus, you can learn by example on this project. For example, a successful Kickstarter will lead to a demo how online multiplayer can be implemented.\n\nOr use ultrastar-play.com as a template for your game.\n\nThe website is a NextJS app with a professional Bootstrap theme, internationalization (i18n), static site generation (SSG), and React and TypeScript integration.\n\nConclusion"
