        "text": "Ever since the first Guitar Hero has been a huge hit since its first release, there has been many fan games and indie games inspired by the Guitar Hero series—and Rock Band series that Guitar Hero branched from—released over the years, recreating the gameplay of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band video game series.\n\nSince the original titles were exclusive on PlayStation 2 at the time, many inspired games were developed for PCs for versatility and easy access for custom content such as custom songs to allow an indefinite feeling of replay value and customization.\n\nGames inspired by Guitar Hero[]\n\nCommercial games[]\n\nRock Band[]\n\nMain article: Rock Band Wiki\n\nThe Rock Band franchise developed by Harmonix, in a way, is a branch of the Guitar Hero series and the spiritual successor to the classic Guitar Hero games developed by Harmonix, the company that developed the original Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, and Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s.\n\nWhen Guitar Hero was purchased by Activision and further developed by Neversoft, Harmonix created its competing rhythm video game series Rock Band that uses a full band—which Activision and Neversoft in response, created Guitar Hero World Tour as a full band title.\n\nLike with Guitar Hero, some games in this article are inspired by the Rock Band franchise. Here is a list of Rock Band games that were released over the years.\n\nRock Band (2007) - Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, Wii\n\nRock Band 2 (2008) - Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, Wii\n\nThe Beatles: Rock Band (2009) - Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii\n\nLego Rock Band (2009) - PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360\n\nLego Rock Band (Nintendo DS) (2009) - Nintendo DS\n\nRock Band Unplugged (2009) - PlayStation Portable\n\nRock Band Mobile (2009) - J2ME\n\nRock Band (iOS) (2009) - iOS\n\nRock Band 3 (2010) - Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii\n\nRock Band 3 (Nintendo DS) (2010) - Nintendo DS\n\nGreen Day: Rock Band (2010) - Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii\n\nRock Band Reloaded (2010) - J2ME, iOS\n\nRock Band Blitz (2012) - PlayStation 3 (PSN), Xbox 360 (XBLA)\n\nRock Band 4 (2015) - PlayStation 4, Xbox One\n\nRock Band VR (2017) - Microsoft Windows\n\nBefore creating Guitar Hero, Harmonix developed Frequency and Amplitude, which the handheld Rock Band games for Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable and Rock Band Blitz were based on gameplay-wise.\n\nRock Revolution[]\n\nRock Revolution is a rhythm game developed by Zoë Mode and HB Studios and published by Konami—the publisher of the GuitarFreaks franchise that Guitar Hero was inspired by—on October 15, 2008 in North America for Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, November 11, 2008 in North America for Wii, May 15, 2009 in Europe for Nintendo DS, and May 22, 2009 in Europe for Xbox 360. However, unlike Guitar Hero, Rock Band, or Konami's GuitarFreaks & DrumFreaks series, Rock Revolution did not receive well and sold only 3,000 copies in the first month of release.\n\nThe Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions would have their own guitar and drum controllers while the Wii version would use the motion controls of the Wii Remote and the Nintendo DS version utilized its touch screen and microphone.\n\nFortnite Festival[]\n\nMain article: Fortnite Festival on the Fortnite Wiki\n\nFortnite Festival is a Rock Band-styled subgame of Fortnite developed by Harmonix—now a subsidiary of Epic Games—and released by Epic Games on December 9, 2023 in the Fortnite ecosystem, available on macOS, Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, iOS, Nintendo Switch, Android, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 for free featuring artists such as The Weeknd, originals by Epic Games, and more.[1][2] Additional songs can be purchased for 500 V-Bucks each, but songs and gear can also be obtained by progressing through the Festival Pass (more through the Premium Festival Pass for 1,800 V-Bucks).[3][4]\n\nIt features two major game modes: Main Stage and Jam Stage.\n\nIn Main Stage, the player can play a variety of tracks in the standard Guitar Hero/Rock Band layout on Guitar, Bass, Drums, Keyboard, or Vocals on Easy, Medium, Hard, or Expert difficulty solo or with a band in online play. The player can also customize their rocker and their instrument on stage.\n\nIn Jam Stage, players can party up on any stage and play jams and mash-ups together. More jams are unlocked by progressing through the Festival Pass from the Main Stage.\n\nUpon release, only computer keyboards and gamepads were supported and guitar controllers were originally planned to be supported in January 2024 with the release of the PDP Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller,[5] however the controller's release date had been delayed till Spring 2024[6] with early adopters receiving it in March 2024.[7] Support for guitar controllers was added on April 23, 2024 (4 months after release).[8] In this update, however, only the PDP Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller, Rock Band 4 Rivals Wireless Fender Jaguar Guitar, and Rock Band 4 Wireless Fender Stratocaster Guitar are compatible with Fortnite Festival for Xbox One & Xbox Series S/X, PlayStation 4 & 5, and PC (Xbox One & Series X/S guitars for PC). Other instrumental controllers are not yet compatible but developers are looking into supporting other guitar controllers and instrumental controllers through custom keybinding.[9]\n\nIndie games[]\n\nGames with custom songs support[]\n\nRULES FOR USERS: Do NOT ask or answer where to find custom songs for these games on the WikiHero. For more information on this rule, see the NoPiracy template.\n\nThe follow indie-developed computer games below support custom songs. Most of these game's custom song formats are based on Frets on Fire's custom song format that is still being used in newer games to allow charts to be compatible with multiple games.\n\nFor Guitar Hero game mods or modified Guitar Hero games that support custom songs such as Guitar Hero II Deluxe (v2.0 Custom Edition and v3.0+), Guitar Hero World Tour: Definitive Edition, and FastGH3, see fan-made modifications.\n\nFor personal computer Screenshots Title Websites Developer Release date Latest version Active?

Guitar Zero, which is a look-alike clone of Guitar Hero II, also received some attention in 2006 and 2007 and had a sequel in 2008 that was based on Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, which was renamed to Frontman. However, Guitar Zero 2/Frontman received a cease and desist from Activision on October 2018 but was restored as Frontman with new graphics in February 2009, with no further response from Activision.[25] However, these early Guitar Hero-inspired games were short-lived, especially Freetar and its editor when Struyk joined Vicarious Visions and had to focus on his job than his side projects[26], and the Frontman team had difficulties contacting their programmer Callisto2002.[12]\n\nFrets on Fire was very popular and revolutionary at time for being one of the first Guitar Hero-inspired games, yet very basic, that it received a lot of unofficial mod support to enhance its gaming experience, most famously the MLH/Alarian Mod that eventually became its own standalone title called Frets on Fire X (or FoFiX for short), containing features from Rock Band and Guitar Hero World Tour including playable Drums and Vocals and gameplay elements. FoFiX is the only inspired game to support playable Vocals but lyrics were displayable in newer inspired games and even though newer inspired games replaced them, FoFiX still occasional receives updates to this day on its GitHub page.\n\nPhase Shift by DWSK became the next well-known Guitar Hero/Rock Band-inspired video game with more gameplay elements included in these later Guitar Hero titles especially when the Guitar Hero franchise originally discontinued in 2010. However, the PC version of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock with tools and game mods such as GHTCP and GH3+ seen more attention over the years, being video streamed on popular streaming websites like YouTube and Twitch by popular Guitar Hero players, that Guitar Hero III overshadowed Phase Shift, but Phase Shift still had its own unique features that it was sought for.\n\nPhase Shift included almost everything FoFiX could do plus many more including Real Guitar/Bass (playable with Rock Band 3's Pro Guitar), Pro/Real Drums (7-lane Drums playable with Rock Band 3's Pro Cymbals and MIDI drumkits respectively), and Dance support (Dance Dance Revolution-styled playable track) except for Vocals that FoFiX had but it still supported displayable lyrics, making it the game with most playable instrumental games and all of these new instruments can be charted in Editor on Fire. The standalone free version ended with v1.27 on January 2, 2015 while the game would be greenlit for a Steam release with an early access purchase for it on April 25, 2019[27] and new updates for the Steam version would include new graphical overhauls and better online play. However, shortly after, the Steam version's development was eventually put on indefinite hiatus—possibly canceled—in early May 2019, when its purchase was delisted from Steam with no direct explanation from the developers, which led to the disappointment of many fans.\n\nTwo years before that in 2017, a lot of attention was drawn to Clone Hero, a new competitor to FoFiX, Phase Shift, and Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock (modded PC version), while it was being developed in Unity by Ryan Foster, slowing acquiring features that Phase Shift had (minus Real Guitar/Bass and Dance) as well as improving its game engine and adding new gameplay features when a team was formed. It eventually supported Drums (4-lane, 5-lane, and Pro features for 4-lanes) during public testing and became the first Guitar Hero-inspired game to feature Guitar Hero Live's gameplay style and controller support. After years of development during its public testing period, v1.0 was officially released on November 29, 2022,[28] thus officially concluding Clone Hero's development.[16] Currently, Clone Hero is most popularly-played Guitar Hero-inspired game to date due to the attention it received with popular Guitar Hero III YouTube and Twitch streamers.\n\nIn 2020, a new competitor for Clone Hero was being developed known as Fret Smasher by Lavoie Studios. A private alpha testing occurred on February 23, 2020 in its Discord server[29] and an Early Access alpha release was published on Steam in June 1, 2021[30] and Discord users have a chance of gaining access to the Early Access Steam version to test features and report bugs. While it has a smaller number of playable instruments, it supports many features that Clone Hero already has but includes some features Phase Shift had that Clone Hero didn't such as custom careers. It, along with Clone Hero, aims for better online multiplayer experience with new and returning online game modes from Guitar Hero games.\n\nA notable difference between the gameplay experience of Fret Smasher and Clone Hero is the feeling of their game engines with no modifiers; Clone Hero's game engine was built for smooth and ease gameplay with a note-hit timing window of 140 ms to help new players play notes while Fret Smasher went back to a tighter, stricter gameplay experience with tighter a note-hit timing window of 120 ms and stricter HOPOs and strumming timings to increase challenge for skilled players,[31], but these can be altered with cheats like \"Infinite Frontend\" (extends HOPOs/Taps' pre-hit window to 120 ms) or \"Drunk Mode\" (doubles note hit window to 240 ms but score saving is limited) to make Fret Smasher play easier, or Precision Mode (reduces note-hit timing window) to make Clone Hero a bit more difficult.\n\nIn October 2022, a new Guitar Hero/Rock Band-inspired video game (graphically inspired by Rock Band) was in development called Yet Another Rhythm Game, or YARG for short. Like Frets on Fire X and Performous (formerly titled UltraStar Next Generation that was inspired by UltraStar, which was inspired by the SingStar series), it is an open-source video game where anyone can contribute in its development. It's first development release was on December 22, 2022. Many features and fixes were included over updates such as Pro Guitar support (from Rock Band 3) in v0.2.0 that Phase Shift also supports, Drums support in v0.2.1, Vocals support in v0.3.0, Pro Drums support in v0.4.0, additional audio file support in v0.6.1, vocal harmonies in v0.7.0 (for multiplayer on Vocals), song caching in v0.8.0—to discover, save songs' data, and reload them quicker—new graphics and audio engine in v0.9.0, tap notes, Rock Band 4's Brutal mode, .chart support, and macOS and Linux support in v0.10.0, whammy feature and Star Power's draining rate by beats in v0.10.5.\n\nAs of July 1, 2023, an Android port is in the works, being developed by ebellumat.[32] Unlike the Android port of Clone Hero, which does not support touchscreen controls other than being able to touch the input settings' menu, full touchscreen control is being planned in the Android port of YARG as well as having gameplay support in both portrait and landscape orientations. The only other known Guitar Hero-styled indie Android games that had custom songs and touchscreen support—albeit were short-lived and were left incomplete or buggy—are Live Studio Sessions (2017) by NewCreature and CloneHeroX (2020) by jayymmd.\n\nMobile and web games[]\n\nNewgrounds, Scratch, and similar sites spawned many Guitar Hero clones. Other websites also had Guitar Hero-inspired games playable on the web too. As Adobe Flash Player has been discontinued since December 31, 2020, Flash games these days can only be played on a Flash emulator like Newground Player or a web browser extension that has Flash emulation such as Ruffle.\n\nThe Google Play Store for Android and iOS App Store also spawned many rhythm games inspired by Guitar Hero and Rock Band, or the Dance Dance Revolution series.\n\nHomebrew for other gaming platforms[]\n\nList of indie-developed games for non-computer platforms based on the Guitar Hero series.\n\nD-Pad Hero (2009) by Kent Hansen & Andreas Pedersen - Nintendo Entertainment System (website)\n\nD-Pad Hero 2 (2010) by Kent Hansen & Andreas Pedersen - Nintendo Entertainment System (website)\n\nGame Hero (2011) by thunderstruck - Virtual Boy (Planet Virtual Boy webpage)\n\nGuitarFun (2008) by Hermes - PlayStation 2, Wii, PC (Wii: website translated · Gamebrew page · Wiibrew page; PS2: PSX-Place page · Internet Archive)\n\nGuitars on Fire (2009) by Daid - Wii (Gamebrew page)\n\nGunnar Hero (2007) by HardHat & Team Sushi - PlayStation Portable (website · Gamebrew Wiki page)\n\nROM hacks[]\n\nList of hacked games that include Guitar Hero-like gameplay elements.\n\nGuitar Hero 64 (2021) for Super Mario 64 (1996) by ArcticJaguar725 - Nintendo 64 (website)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe Guitar Hero franchise was inspired by GuitarFreaks, a rhythm video game arcade series created by Konami and published in Japan. GuitarFreaks also spin-off the DrumMania series. Konami also assisted in creating Guitar Hero Arcade and published Rock Revolution that did not receive well reviews and sales.\n\nBesides Guitar Hero, the 1999 rhythm arcade video game Guitar Jam developed by Namco may have also been inspired by the GuitarFreak series.[33]\n\n[]\n\nA list of every known rhythm game (including inspired titles) on Github documented by szymmirr - https://github.com/szymmirr/rhythm-games\n\nReferences[]"
