        "text": "Hi,\n\nI have just downloaded ultrastar yesterday and it is wonderfull. Allready added 50 songs to it :-) Great work guys.\n\nNow my question.\n\nIn ultrastar 0.4 there is an option to play with 2 (infact even 6 ???) players.\n\nWhat are the options to make this work ?\n\n- Having two soundcards with each a microphone on the microphone-jack ?\n\n- Having the singstar mics with the USB splitter and put it in one USB port of the pc ?\n\nI am pretty sure reading other messages those two options will work. But my final question is:\n\n- Having two USB mics and put them each in their own USB slot. Will this work ?\n\nAnd then I also have some questions about the singstar mics :\n\n- Are they sold seperatly ?\n\n- Is their quality much better then default pc microphones (like http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=103,CONTENTID=6776)\n\n- I know they will work in ultrastar. But will the mic also work in the normal windows environment ? Can I use them with skype for example ?"
