Best collection of tracks tho\n\nFirst I want to assure everybody that this app is not getting updated anywhere near as much as the update log would have you believe lolâ¦ it is simply compliance with Appleâs update frequency rule. App performance has never really âimprovedâ The entire three years Iâve been using it; at times it has gotten worse and then return to normal, but I deal with the same bugs Iâve been dealing with since I started on here. If you really look through the log youâll see that any time they make even the most minor of ACTUAL changes, they take care to point it out. The most recent actual change was a UI adjustment, that tried to help take the sting out of a recent-ish UI change that I personally dislike rather strongly. The community is pretty awesome as long as you are not a tool, and Iâve never seen a bigger collection of songs on any of the other apps. It also has slightly, to moderately less bots than the other apps Iâve seen as well. Social features suuuuuck but in some ways, I can appreciate the effect that has on the platform overall. It absolutely isnât intentionally so lol - same low effort results. Sometimes I wonder if there is just one person programming this, that barely knows how to program. Considering the cost of a pro membership, the absolute lack of any kind of decent functionality is not really acceptable IMO. Other apps have FAR more advanced social features, and have been around for far less time.\n\nDeveloper Response ,\n\nHey, you do raise some good points!
