And I need a free (no cost) solution.\n\nIdeally, players would be able to connect to each other directly (one player acts as a host).\n\nIf a server is needed, then players should at least be able to set up their own server.\n\nA possible solution is mentioned by Unity documentation: A “listen server” is hosted by one of the player’s machines. To establish a connection with this host, the documentation mentions some variations:\n\nOption A: Port Forwarding\n\nOption B: Relay server\n\nOption C: NAT Punchthrough\n\nPort forwarding works of course but it puts a burden on the user. I consider this a fallback if everything else fails.\n\nOut of the other options, I prefer NAT Punch, possibly with a Relay server as fallback.\n\nHowever, I still have some questions:\n\nAre there any example projects (e.g. on GitHub) to see NAT punch and Relay server implemented with Netcode for GameObjects?\n\nThe Unity documentation seems to imply that this is only a matter of the selected transport. Thus, I wonder how to use multiplayer community contributions to implement NAT Punch or the Relay server approach?\n\nWhat exactly does a relay server require? Can I configure a regular Nginx to work as Relay server for Unity or do I have to implement a dedicated application?\n\nIs there maybe existing and free (no cost) relay server infrastructure that one can use for an open source game?\n\nThanks for your help!"
