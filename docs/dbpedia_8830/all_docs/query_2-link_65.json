        "text": "December 02, 2007\n\nBlu:\n\nYeah, I'm into Animal Crossing now. I have the Master Sword in my house! I wanted the Triforce. y.y\n\nPokemon's okay, I guess...\n\nAnyways, questions!\n\n1. Why do you like Kirby?\n\n2. If you could make ANY Ability, what would it be? (I already have dibs on Plant! The awesome thorny vines would kill people, and he could SolarBeam people with the flower on top of his head! :D)\n\n3. If you were a kirby/batamon (WHATEVER,) what colors would ya' be, what Ability would you use the most, and what gender would you be? (Myself, I'd be that rockin' Ocean Blue spraypaint color! I'd be a girl with gray-blue eyes, and I'd use either Fighter or Ninja the most. Ninjas ROCK!)\n\n4. Do you like brussel sprouts?\n\n5. What's the easiest way to get a guy you like to like Kirby more, besides holding him hostage or bribing him or something?\n\n6. Would you enjoy sucking the face off of a n00b? I would, probably.\n\n7. What's the worst game you've EVER played?\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\n...\n\nKIRBY ROCKS!!! :P\n\nThank you, and good night!\n\nDisaster: 1. Classified information.\n\n2. DISASTER\n\n3. Pink male with red shoes and purple eyes and DISASTER ability\n\n4. I like throwing them at people.\n\n5. Force the games onto them and make them play the games under your witness.\n\n6. ...Ew?\n\n7. Any game my sister has bought.\n\nShiro: 1. he eats his yogurt from a tube\n\n2. the \"fire-Diddgery-from-a-cannon\" ability would be a fan favorite!\n\n3. i'm not a kirby! question answered.\n\n4. no.\n\n5. lend them a kirby game or something as an example. if they don't like it there's not much more you can do about it.\n\n6. you would, wouldn't you\n\n7. too many to name!\n\nDiddgery: 1. I guess because the first video game I played was Kirby's Adventure? Also I like fun games, and I think Kirby is fun... most of the time.\n\n2. Mage Kirby. Forget the parlor tricks of Magic - I want some lightning bolts shooting from Kirby's hands.\n\n3. (make-your-own Diddgery Kirby!! use your imagination, kids!)\n\n4. Augh! Bleh! Ewww! Grugh! ...No.\n\n5. Kirby Super Star and Kirby's Dream Land 3.\n\n6. That's horrifying.\n\n7. I don't know, maybe Quest 64?\n\nWildrows: 1) I...I don't even know why I like Kirby. OH MY LIFE IS A LIE!\n\n2) Perhaps some kind of Polearm ability? Kirby's covered just about everything, so I dunno.\n\n3) Blue and Green, most definatly, with gray eyes. I'd probably stick to Sword.\n\n4) No.\n\n5) Um. Hostage situations are a no-no. Lend him a game.\n\n6) ...\n\n7) Lots. I don't remember any names, they were that bad.\n\nAsotoku: 1) It's a simplistic game, something you can just pick up and play, I suppose?\n\n2) Um.. Time? Stop time and smack everything about. Start time and everything explodes at once.\n\n3) I'd be that charcoal (?) Kirby from that one GBA game. I.. I can't remember which one. :) Obviously I'd be male. And I'd have... Throw?\n\n4) No.\n\n5) You didn't say blackmail wasn't an option.\n\n6) No.\n\n7) The bad one.\n\nDark Hamsterlord:\n\nIn the Kirby Superstar remake for the DS, I would personally want to see another game mode added in (perhaps unlocked by clearing Milky Way Wishes)\n\nMy question is simple:\n\nWhat would YOU like to see in the Kirby Superstar remake for the DS?\n\nDisaster: Nothing major should be added to an already perfect game.\n\nShiro: the game is fine as is.\n\nDiddgery: Dyna Blade: Episode 2 since that \"TO BE CONTINUED..\" at the end of Dyna Blade still bothers me\n\nWildrows: I can't really think of anything either.\n\nAsotoku: Wi-fi co-op. Especially for GCO.\n\nZURA:\n\nHi guys. I got my opinion on the theme, and some questions.\n\nI think that a Waddle Dee trophy would be awesome.\n\nNow onto some questions.\n\n1. How would you react if Pawapurokun was in Brawl? I mean, he was in that other obscure fighting game Snake was in.\n\n2. How does the mailbag process work?\n\n3. When do custom titles come back?\n\n4. How is the mailbag staff determined?\n\nThanks for taking the time to answer all of these\n\nShiro: 1. ...who?\n\n2. ...what?\n\n3. ...when?\n\n4. ...why?\n\nDiddgery: 1. I would think 'oh, ZURA must be happy about this.'\n\n2. CANCER AND MADNESS\n\n3. When allmighty master of disks decides to do it up.\n\n4. Tentacle-picked by Ultros.\n\nDisaster: 1. A little too obscure, I think.\n\n2. Magic.\n\n3. NEVER! AHAHAHAHAahaha...\n\n4. Coolness contest. And you have to be a staff member elsewhere on KRR, I think.\n\nWildrows: 1. Um. Uh. Who?\n\n2. Chaos.\n\n3. No idea.\n\n4. Chaos.\n\nAsotoku: 1. ZURAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n\n2. We decide a date and time to do it, to begin with. Then I put it off for another month. On the day, two or three of us meet up at the required time. We hang around and wait for everyone else. I find mail with actual questions, and we answer them. I struggle with the terrible coding that RMD made when he set the mailbag up. We think of a witty way to end it, and Disaster uploads it to KRR for the world to see.\n\n3. Who knows!?\n\n4. Well, unless something big happens, the general mailbag staff will always be Asotoku/Diddgery/Disaster. Wildrows/Shiro will generally accompany us, unless they're doing something else at the time, in which case I will look for suitable replacements in the IRC channel.\n\nMKFreak:\n\nDear RMD(if he's still alive XD)and other people that aren't as cool as RMD,\n\nG'day mates-oh,wait,I'm not Australian...Anyways,\n\nI'll go along with the theme. I would like to see everything that was in the original KSS implemented...that's all I can ask for. XP\n\nAnd now my question: If any of you have played Kirby Canvas Curse,how far have you gotten?\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nMKFreak\n\nAsotoku: Just to clear things up, RMD isn't coming back.\n\nHyarion:\n\nYep, I'm back... Looks like it's time to write up another mailbag letter!\n\n...Ah, I nearly forgot to mention that I'm actually Da Bomb-Omb, finally getting around to using my standard web identity on these. In case you were wondering (probably not, but what the heck, I'll explain anyway), Hyarion is Tolkien-related. It literally means \"south-son\" or \"son of the south\", which is a rough translation of Benjamin into the Quenya mode of Elvish. Yes, I AM a Tolkien buff. Enough about me, though.\n\nSo, as of this writing, Dedede was announced for Brawl a few days ago. We all saw it coming, heheh. Heck, RMD is even saying it on the mailbag page. Still, it doesn't make it any less awesome. I especially like how his B+Up move is his jump/stomp move he's had in nearly every game you fight him in... Hm, at any rate, I don't think there's really any more characters from the Kirby franchise that could be playable, just an Assist Trophy here and there. Anyways, this was last mailbag's subject. On to the current one!\n\nKirby Ultra Star, huh? I can't really think of much they could do to improve on Superstar, as that was my favorite game of the series (never played Dream Land 3. :P) It looks like the graphics are getting an overhaul, but that's not really a good enough reason to buy a remake. I think the mechanics are tuned to perfection and don't need any work, and there's certainly already enough powers in the game, though I wouldn't mind if a few of the newer powers are added in. Perhaps they could flesh out a few of the games or even add a whole new one... Ah, I just remembered. Multiplayer! If they do multiplayer right, this would be a game I would definitely buy. Single-card helper mode... Wi-Fi cooperative or competitive... The possibilities are endless. Don't screw this chance up, HAL!\n\nAh, before I forget...\n\nOBJECTION! http://objection.mrdictionary.net/go.php?n=2288070\n\nHeheh, sorry, but that last mailbag put me in a Phoenix Wright frame of mind, not to mention the third game just came out over here (I imported it a while back, though. :P)\n\nNow for the obligatory question... How does the mailbag get answered? IRC, chat room, closed topic on a forum, or what? Also, while I'm on the topic, how did you get to answer this mailbag, anyhow? I probably know most of the answers to the latter question, but I'll ask for the heck of it.\n\nWell, that's all for now... I'll be around for the next mailbag! See you around!\n\nDisaster: 2) Chaos.\n\n4) Chaos.\n\nShiro: oh my god, where are the questions- oh, there they are! we answer the questions in an IRC chatroom. as for who gets to answer, we must kill a man without any hesitation before we are true members of the mailbag clan.\n\nAsotoku: OBJECTION!\n\nBlue Kirby:\n\n\"Blue Kirby:\n\nKirby and Meta Knight have been confirmed in Super Smash Bros Brawl! Yay! But here's one question ... with assist trophies and possibilities of playable characters ... who else do you think might join in for the fun ... I think Dedede will be an excellent character.\n\nRMD:dedede will be playable\n\nDisaster: I DUNNO KNUCKLE JOE MAYBE\n\nAsotoku: IDK, MY BFF FOREVER, KNUCKLE JOE?\n\nDiddgery: Like those guys said Knuckle Joe is an Assist Trophy but I am hoping Rick appears or maybe Gooey that'd be swell.\n\nShiro: if i hear one more person throw a fangirl seizure over putting more kirby characters into brawl i'm going to dropkick diddgery through a concrete floor. again.\n\nDiddgery: ;^;\"\n\nWhat do you think on how RMD was right ... Dedede's playable! Now, what do you think his final smash will be? If that appears before this mailbag, ignore it and answer this ...\n\nI want ALL of you to be playable in Brawl.\n\nDiddgery: RMD's a psychic. He has amazing powers of foresight that you can't even comprehend.\n\nDisaster: DARK DEDEDE\n\nDARK DEDEDE\n\nShiro: i think RMD is secretly sleeping with sakurai. as for dedede's final smash, if they base it off the dedede from the games, i have no clue. if they base it off dedede from the anime, i will kill myself.\n\nDisaster: Final Smash: Clobberin' that there Kirby\n\nWildrows: Dedede almost seems like old news now. He could get possessed by Dark Matter for his Final Smash, but who knows? I'm already playable in Brawl, that is, unless Jigglypuff is cut, then there's no Jigglypuff Kirby, then I'm not playable.\n\nAsotoku: I want ALL of me to be playable in Brawl, too. It'd be an unfair disadvantage if it were only my legs.\n\nvinnyboy:\n\nWell, I hate to ask this, but do you guys watch Anime Music Videos? (Maybe don't know because I'm idiot.)\n\nThe Fugitive:\n\nHow do you guys feel about the only Kirby games on the horizon being a remake and a game that's been delayed for several years? It's absolutely no wonder that the community really has no choice other than to gravitate towards Brawl, which actually does seem to be more Kirby focused than it is to a lot of other series.\n\nOh Sakurai, you cad.\n\nWe know each stage in Brawl will have several different songs. So far, we know about Meta Knight's stage, and that jazz Revenge of Meta Knight song it has going on. Care to speculate on what other songs the stage might include?\n\nWildrows: Hi RMD.\n\nDisaster: GOURMET RACE SUPER DX SPECIAL PLATINUM EDITION\n\nDiddgery: Sand Canyon 3 from Kirby's Dream Land 3 might fit with Battleship Halberd, if it's given a quicker tempo. And I'd totally like to hear Factory Inspection from Kirby 64 again, since that was one of the four or five worthwhile tracks from that game. Oh, and perhaps the boss music from Kirby Super Star.\n\nShiro: FLYING BATTERY ZONE\n\nDisaster: Actually, the main Great Cave Offensive theme and The Arena theme would both make good songs in Brawl, I think.\n\nAsotoku: RMD, you cad. How did you know what the mailbag theme was going to be? And why are you hiding under a faux name!? Why are you even sending mail to the mailbag!?! YOU DIED >:(\n\nSunKirby:\n\nHI! I've just registered in the KRR and I'm just 10 years old. What should I do first? How can I do stuff around? Is there anything \"unlocked\" when I registered? Can you pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease guide me at the beginning? Thanks,Thank You,THANKS and THANK YOU!!!\n\nShiro: i... uh.. er.. . i am not entirely sure we're the people you should come to when taking your first steps in KRR.\n\nDisaster: \"Unlocked\"? Since when is KRR a video game?... I want to play KRR too! D:\n\nDiddgery: ...Read the forum rules?\n\nWildrows: Well, nothing is kept locked at KRR except for the staff room. You should go read the forum rules before you start posting, though.\n\nAsotoku: Oh, Disaster. How mean. I mean, your ability to post in topics is 'unlocked' when you register.\n\nTechnically.\n\nNot grasping at straws.\n\nAt all.\n\nAmos teh Famous:\n\nHey I am looking for a date.\n\nCan you hook me up with an 19-24 year old woman. Preferably one with red hair and telekenetic powers, unless she is hot headed and blows up people's heads when she gets mad. If she does not have red hair, then that is okay as long as she is telekenitic. But if she can read my mind, then she is not my type. Thanks.\n\nShiro: you'd want wildrows for that\n\nWildrows: Dale? Is that you? We told you a million times, KRR is not a dating service.\n\nDisaster: You're asking for a 19-24 year old woman on a site whose main demographic is 10-14 years old.\n\nDiddgery: I really hope nobody asks for a girl with a horn on her forehead\n\nAsotoku: Teru? Is that you?\n\nSnukky (Bukky Kat!):\n\n(1)I wish Diddgery was on the KSS remake for the DS. WHO'S WITH ME?\n\n(2)Who knows any glitches for that game?\n\n(3} RMD sux.\n\nDiddgery: 1) Someday I hope to make a video game along the lines of Diddgery's Amazing Adventure.\n\n2) Nope.\n\n3) RMD IS AWEOMSE\n\nShiro: 1. what is it with you people and putting diddgery in video games\n\n2. if you press the power button, your game turns off! see if it works on your computer.\n\n3. WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP!\n\nAsotoku: DETECTIVE GUMSHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOE!\n\nWildrows: 1. The Kirby series has enough cute. Any more would overload it into looking bad.\n\n2. lol Shiro you're so mean.\n\n3. What? RMD is aweomse!\n\nDisaster: 1. He's your partner for Horn... Needle ability.\n\n2. Super Star is flawless.

Kirby does have two (I think?) GBA games, and it is very common for DS games to have extras when you add a GBA game. Atleast, it WAS very common, but now Nintendo has amnesia and forgot Gameboy ever exsisted. But if Nintendo did this, what kind of extra's would you like to see from the two games?\n\nDiddgery: I can really only think of different colors for Kirby.\n\nWildrows: Unlockable Kirby's Adventure with Super Star style abilities.\n\nShiro: VS MODE??????\n\nDisaster: Abilities (and their respective enemies) from NiDL and KatAM that aren't in Super Star.\n\nAsotoku: With NiDL & Ultra Star together you should be able to play through the KSS stages as Meta Knight.\n\n...Apart from RoMK, of course.\n\nNot Rita:\n\nHi there, I'm not Rita. I am... Atir. *cough* Anyways, I have a question. How do you guys manage to put up with idiots? And as for the theme, I'd have to say Burnin' Leo. Can't wait for your answer.\n\nP.S. I am not Rita. The fact that we look alike is a complete coincidence. *shifty eyes*\n\nP.S.S. Rita says that she likes the original MK, the one from the Japanese version.\n\nDiddgery: If you're not Rita, doesn't that make you Runt?\n\nShiro: to dispose of, as one would say in the vernacular 'laem n00bs', we simply hand out fresh lemon-scented disposable diddgerys. or is that diddgeries?\n\noh my god i don't know\n\nDisaster: I counter idiocy with sarcasm and lethargy.\n\nAsotoku:\n\nmnmnmnmnmnmnmn:\n\nmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmmmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmn\n\nmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmnmn\n\nWildrows: opopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopoppopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopop\n\nDiddgery:\n\nOh!
