UltraStar is a clone of SingStar, a music video game. Ultrastar lets one or several players score points by singing along to a song or music video and match the pitch of the original song well. Ultrastar displays lyrics as well as the correct notes similar to a piano roll. On top of the correct notes Ultrastar displays the pitch recorded from the players. Ultrastar allows several people to play simultaneously by connecting several microphones possibly to several sound cards. To add a song to Ultrastar, a file with notes and lyrics is required, together with an audio file. Optionally a cover image, a backdrop image and a video may be added to each song.

The source code of Ultrastar is available bundled with a copy of the GNU General Public License (a free software license) and also a binary of the non-free library BASS, of which source code is not available. There's nothing telling which files the GNU GPL applies to or what versions of the license may be used. To use Ultrastar, one must link the source code together with BASS. As the GNU GPL is a strong copyleft license, linking GPL code with BASS and distributing the result is a violation of the GPL.

Ultrastar comes preloaded with a short sample from Jamelia's hit "Superstar". The original UltraStar is programmed in Kylix/Delphi and made for Microsoft Windows operating-system. There are also ports available in C++ programming language for other operating-systems such as Linux, BSD and other UNIX platforms.

UltraStar Deluxe was started as a modification of Ultrastar. Whiteshark initially offered to collaborate with Corvus5, but this offer was declined. Instead Whiteshark started to add some features on his own with the help of Mota. The first release is known as X-Mas mod, due to a release date around Christmas time. This attracted the attention of other developers that were willing to help. The team grew and the source code departed more and more from the original. Smaller features are often implemented in both projects allowing them to benefit from one another. Though the different projects' implementations of such features often differ. UltraStar Deluxe is different in three key ways from UltraStar. Significant effort has been put into improving reliability by repairing bugs. The second difference is the visual appearance. Sparkling stars and various other effects have been added in addition to skin support. Many effects are also based on the Singstar on PS3. Many new features have been implemented:

*More video formats are supported, such as DivX, XviD, FLV, Avi and WMV.

*Singing screen with golden notes, line bonus and popups

*Party mode with various game types. This includes support for plugins that allow further extension of such game types.

*Improved song management and selection with the ability to search for songs and use playlists

*More detailed statistics screen
