        "text": "Stunning pictures have emerged charting the incredible story of a French princess who had a fling with Queen Victoria's grandson before travelling the world as a big game hunter when she was forced to marry another man.\n\nBlack and white photographs show British-born Hélène of Orléans escaping her unhappy marriage to an Italian prince by touring Africa.\n\nHélène had earlier been barred from marrying Queen Victoria's grandson, Prince Albert Viktor the Duke of Clarence and Avondale, because of their different religions.\n\nThe young royal - dubbed the Wandering Princess in a new book - went on to marry Italian Prince Emanuele Filiberto di Savoia, Duke of Aosta in June 1895 and they lived in Naples where she became known for her charity work.\n\nBut in a bid to escape the boredom of court life, the intrepid princess frequently set off for hunting and photography trips across Africa.\n\nHélène was born in 1871 in Twickenham, London, after her family was exiled in 1848, she was raised in France after the law of banishment against the dynasty was repealed.\n\nShe fell in love with Prince Albert - the eldest son of the future Edward VII and grandson of then reigning Queen Victoria - during a visit to Scotland in 1890 when she was 16 and he was 23.\n\nThey embarked on a whirlwind romance and exchanged dozens of messages, with the Prince describing her as his 'beloved one' and 'an angel upon Earth.'\n\n'Nothing on Earth would turn my resolve to stick to you whatever happens, even if I had to wait 50 years or more.'\n\nHowever, marriage to a Roman Catholic would have seen Albert forfeiting his claim to the British throne.\n\nHélène offered to become an Anglican while the prince considered renouncing his succession rights, once telling his brother: 'You have no idea how I love this sweet girl now, and I feel I could never be happy without her'.\n\nQueen Victoria is said to have relented after initially being opposed to the union, but Hélène's father refused to countenance the marriage.\n\nThe Princess took the final option she had left and sought an audience with Pope Leo XIII in the hope he would allow any children she had to be raised as Protestants.\n\nBut in an account of the meeting, a friend told how she found Hélène 'in tears by the Holy Father’s knee. The Holy Father said, \"It is useless, you know I cannot compromise on the principles I represent\".'\n\nPrince Albert, known as Eddy to his family, eventually became engaged to Princess Victoria Mary of Teck, a German Protestan in December 1891. But he died from pneumonia in 1892 at the age of just 28.\n\nWidowed in 1931, Hélène was married for a second time in 1936 to Colonel Otto Campin.\n\nPhotos of her travels have emerged in a new book, The Wandering Princess: Hélène de France, Duchess of Aosta (1871-1951) by Edward Hanson.\n\nThe book's preface says: 'Hélène's life was one of broken expectations. Her one great romance, with Queen Victoria's grandson, was not allowed to flourish because of the difference in religion.\n\n'When she did marry, it was with the hope of large inheritance from her great-uncle and godfather, the Duc d'Aumale, and the possibility that she and her husband might eventually succeed to the throne of Italy; neither happened.'\n\nMr Hanson said that the only part of her life 'that never let down her expectations' was when she set off on 'a life travelling, hunting, and photographing in Africa'.\n\n'The starting point for this biography came when I purchased a small collection of postcards at the Olympia Book Fair in London. The dozen or so notes were mainly written by Hélène to her childhood friend Renee Saint Maur, daughter to Camille Dupuy, her parents' private secretary,' said Mr Hanson.\n\n'The cards were sent from France, Italy, and Switzerland, from Egypt and Ethiopia, and even from a hospital ship off the coast of Libya, a first indication to me of the widespread travels and interests of this woman.\n\n'In her youth, she was renowned as a beauty; when she chose to drape herself with royal jewels for special occasions or official photographs, there was no disputing her regal dignity and poise, which some chose to interpret as pride and haughtiness.\n\n'However, Hélène was actually more comfortable in simpler garments, most especially the travelling clothes she wore during her many trips to Africa.'"
