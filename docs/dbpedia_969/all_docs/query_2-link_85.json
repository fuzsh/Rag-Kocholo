Daewongun was restored to power, only to be forcibly taken to China by Chinese troops dispatched to Seoul to prevent further disorder.[4] In August 1882, the Korean government sent a mission to Japan and agreed to the stationing of Japanese troops to guard the legation in Seoul\n\n1894\n\nThe outbreak of the Donghak Peasant Revolution in 1894 changed Japanese policy toward Korea. Korea had negotiated with Russia to counterbalance Japan’s growing influence. So Chae-pil and Protestant missionaries introduced Western political thought to Korea. Protesters took to the streets, demanding democratic reforms and an end to Japanese and Russian influence in Korean affairs. The Korean government asked for Chinese assistance in ending the revolt, and Meiji leaders decided upon military intervention to challenge China.\n\n1895\n\nWhen China sent troops into Korea, Japan responded by sending its own troops. Japan won the First Sino-Japanese War, and China signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895\n\n1896\n\nWhen he heard the news, Daewongun returned to the royal palace the same day.[10] On 11 February 1896, King Gojong and the crown prince moved from Gyeongbokgung palace to the Russian legation in Seoul, from where they governed for about one year, an event known as the Korean royal refuge at the Russian legation.\n\n1897\n\nAmong its many stipulations, the treaty recognized “the full and complete independence and autonomy of Korea,” thus ending Korea’s protectorate relationship with the Chinese Qing dynasty, leading to the proclamation of the Korean Empire in 1897.\n\n1904\n\nold korean picture postcard\n\n1907\n\nIn June 1907, the Second Peace Conference was held in The Hague. Emperor Gojong secretly sent three representatives to bring the problems of Korea to the world’s attention. The three envoys were refused access to the public debates by the international delegates who questioned the legality of the protectorate convention. Out of despair, one of the Korean representatives, Yi Jun, committed suicide at The Hague.[14]\n\nIn response, the Japanese government took stronger measures. On 19 July Emperor Gojong was forced to relinquish his imperial authority and appoint the Crown Prince as regent. Japanese officials used this concession to force the accession of the new Emperor Sunjong following abdication, which was never agreed to by Gojong. Neither Gojong or Sunjong was present at the ‘accession’ ceremony. Sunjong was to be the last ruler of the Joseon Dynasty, founded in 1392.[\n\nHis Imperial Majesty Emperor Sunjong Munon Muryeong Donin Seonggyeong of Korea, the last Korean monarch.\n\nIn 1910 Japan formally annexed Korea, the centuries-old Joseon Dynasty ended along with Korean independence, and the two surviving former monarchs were both imprisoned. Gojong died in 1919 and is widely speculated to have been poisoned by his Japanese jailers. The Empire of Japan went on to rule Korea with an iron fist until their defeat by the Allied forces in 1945. Thus the empire that ended in the dropping of two atomic bombs got its start in, among other places, the Korean peninsula. Much of the drama of that takeover played out in and around this palace\n\n1908\n\nold Korean Picture Postcard 1908\n\n1910\n\nJapan-Korea Annexation Treaty\n\nGeneral power of attorney to Lee Wan-Yong signed and sealed by the last emperor, Sunjong (李坧) on August 22, 1910 (隆熙4年).\n\nBy 1910, the number of Japanese settlers in Korea reached over 170,000, creating the largest overseas Japanese community in the world at the time.\n\nthe Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty in 1910.[16]\n\nThe treaty became effective the same day and was published one week later. The treaty stipulated:\n\nArticle 1: His Majesty the Emperor of Korea concedes completely and definitely his entire sovereignty over the whole Korean territory to His Majesty the Emperor of Japan.\n\nArticle 2: His Majesty the Emperor of Japan accepts the concession stated in the previous article and consents to the annexation of Korea to the Empire of Japan\n\n1911\n\nIn 1911 a proclamation, “Matter Concerning the Changing of Korean Names” (朝鮮人ノ姓名改称ニ関スル件) was issued barring ethnic Koreans from taking Japanese names and to retroactively revert the names of Koreans that had already registered under Japanese names back to the original Korean ones.[56][56\n\nMarch First Movement (삼일 운동)\n\nThe March First Movement, or Samil Movement, was one of the earliest displays of Korean independence movements during the Japanese occupation of Korea. The name refers to an event that occurred on 1 March 1919, hence the movement’s name, literally meaning “Three-One Movement” in Korean. It is also sometimes referred to as the Manse Demonstrations (만세운동). During the series of demonstrations that began that day and spread throughout Korea, 7,000 people were killed by Japanese police and soldiers.\n\nAt 2 P.M. on the 1 March 1919, the 33 nationalists who formed the core of the Samil Movement convened at Taehwagwan Restaurant in Seoul, and read the Korean Declaration of Independence that had been drawn up by the historian/writer Choe Nam-seon and the poet/Buddhist monk Manhae (also known as Han Yongun). The nationalists initially planned to assemble at Tapgol Park in downtown Seoul, but they chose a more private location out of fear that the gathering might turn into a riot. The leaders of the movement signed the document and sent a copy to the Japanese Governor General, with their compliments.\n\nWe herewith proclaim the independence of Korea and the liberty of the Korean people. We tell it to the world in witness of the equality of all nations and we pass it on to our posterity as their inherent right. We make this proclamation, having back of us 5,000 year of history, and 20,000,000 of a united loyal people. We take this step to insure to our children for all time to come, personal liberty in accord with the awakening consciousness of this new era. This is the clear leading of God, the moving principle of the present age, the whole human race’s just claim. It is something that cannot be stamped out, or stifled, or gagged, or suppressed by any means.\n\nThe March 1st movement resulted in a major change in Japanese imperial policy towards Korea. Japanese Governor-General Hasegawa Yoshimichi accepted responsibility for the loss of control (although most of the repressive measures leading to the uprising had been put into place by his predecessors) and was replaced by Saito Makoto. Some of the aspects of Japanese rule considered most objectionable to Koreans were removed. The military police were replaced by a civilian force, and limited press freedom was permitted under what was termed the ‘cultural policy’. Many of these lenient policies were reversed during the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II.\n\nWomen also found new opportunities after the movement to express their views for the first time in Korea. Ideas of female liberation were allowed to be printed after the rebellion. Such journals as the Sin yoja (New Woman) and Yoja kye (Women’s World) were printed.\n\nThe March 1 Movement was a catalyst for the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai in April 1919.\n\nOn May 24, 1949, March 1st was designated a national holiday in South Korea.\n\n1913\n\nDai Nippon Homeland postal stationer green Horse card used in Korea cds 7.1.12(1913.)\n\n1914 1915 1916 1917 1918\n\n1919\n\nGojong died in 1919 and is widely speculated to have been poisoned by his Japanese jailers.

Much of the drama of that takeover played out in and around this palace\n\nUpon Emperor Gojong’s death,the crownprince still a kid and anti-Japanese rallies took place nationwide, most notably the March 1st Movement of 1919. A declaration of independence was read in Seoul.\n\nSince on March 1, 1919, Anti-Japanese demonstration continued to spread, and as the Japanese national and military police could not contain the crowds, the army and even the navy were also called in 1912\n\nObjection to Japanese rule over Korea continued, and the March 1st Movement was a catalyst for the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea by Korean émigrés in Shanghai on 13 April 1919. The modern South Korean government considers this Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea the de jure representation of the Korean people throughout the period of Japanese rule.\n\nMarch First Movement (삼일 운동)\n\nThe March First Movement, or Samil Movement, was one of the earliest displays of Korean independence movements during the Japanese occupation of Korea.

With the growth of the wartime economy, the government recognized landlordism as an impediment to increased agricultural productivity, and took steps to increase control over the rural sector through the formation of the Central Agricultural Association, a compulsory organization under the wartime command economy.\n\n1931\n\n1932\n\nThe Japanese occupation of Korea after annexation was largely uncontested militarily by the smaller, poorly-armed, and poorly-trained Korean army. Many former soldiers and other volunteers left the Korean peninsula for Manchuria and Primorsky Krai in Russia. Koreans in Manchuria formed resistance groups known as Dongnipgun (Liberation Army), which traveled across the Korean-Chinese border, using guerrilla warfare tactics against Japanese forces.\n\nThe Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1932 and subsequent Pacification of Manchukuo deprived many of these groups of their bases of operation and supplies. Many were forced to either flee to China, or to join the Communist-backed forces in eastern Russia. One of the guerrilla groups was lead by the future leader of communist North Korea, Kim Il-Sung, in Japanese controlled Manchuria. Kim Il-Sung’s time as a guerrilla leader was formative upon his political ideology once he came to power\n\n1933 1934 1935 1936\n\n1937\n\nDai Nippon postal stationer brown horse 2 sen used in Korea CDS 21.9.12(1937)\n\n1938\n\nthe first ethnic Korean to be elected into the House of Representatives in 1932; he was re-elected in 1938 and continued to serve throughout World War II.\n\n1939\n\nused private made postcard with Dai Nippon homeland definitive stamps cds 1.1.14(1939)\n\nUsed homemade cover with Dai Nippon Homeland definitive numeric Koban 2 sen red stamps ,used in Korea CDS 19.11.14(1939)\n\nHowever, under Japanese rule, many Korean resources were utilized for Japan.[29] Economist Suh Sang-Chul points out that the nature of industrialization during the period was as an “imposed enclave,” so the impact of colonialism was trivial. Another scholar, Song Byung-Nak, states that the economic condition of average Koreans was aggravated during the period despite the economic growth. Most Koreans at the time could access only a primary school education under restriction by the Japanese, and this prevented the growth of an indigenous entrepreneurial class. A 1939 statistic shows that among the total capital recorded by factories, about 94 percent was Japanese-owned. While Koreans owned about 61 percent of small-scale firms that had 5 to 49 employees, about 92 percent of large-scale enterprises with more than 200 employees were Japanese-owned\n\n1940\n\nNam Dae Mon picture postcard used 2.4.1940\n\n1941\n\n.\n\nDai Nippon Postal stationer used at Korea 16.5.16(1941)\n\nDai Nippon Postal stationer used in Korea 24.10.16(1941)\n\nOn 9 December 1941, shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, under the presidency of Kim Gu, declared war on Japan and Nazi Germany. The Provisional Government banded together various Korean resistance guerilla groups such as the Korean Liberation Army, which was involved in combat on behalf of the Allies in various campaigns in China and parts of South East Asia. Tens of thousands of Koreans volunteered for the National Revolutionary Army and the People’s Liberation Army. The communist-backed Korean Volunteer Army (KVA) was established in Yenan, China, outside of the Provisional Government’s control, from a core of 1,000 deserters from the Imperial Japanese Army. After the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation, the KVA entered Manchuria, where it recruited from the ethnic Korean population and eventually became the Korean People’s Army of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n\n1947\n\nUsed Dai Nippon Postal Stationer 4c added dai Nippon 1 cent cds 19.2.27(1942) sent to Korea after the World War II.\n\n3.Korea During World War II (1941-1945)\n\nA.The Chronologic Historic Collections\n\nKuniaki Koiso, Japanese Governor-General of Korea, implemented a draft of Koreans for wartime labor.\n\n1942\n\n1943\n\nDai Nippon Military Postal Card used with added dai nippon homeland stamp one sen brown cds 10.6.18(1943)\n\nUsed Korean Picture postcard naval post mark 24,6.03(1943)\n\nDai Nippon Horse 2 sen postal stationer used in Korea cds syowa 9.5.18 (1943),in Indonesia this postcard was overprint added nominal 1 sen.\n\n1944\n\nIn 1944, when the Japanese were losing the war, the political situation in China became uncertain.

Before 1944, 18,000 Koreans passed the examination for induction into the army. Koreans provided workers to mines and construction sites around Japan.

My great-grandfather’s name is Yongsun Lee, my grandfather’s name is Wongil Lee and my dad’s name is Eal Hyung Lee. Yongsun was a high school principal while Wongil had a high school diploma, which may be an equivalent to a junior high school education in present South Korea. He became a church elder around the age of 23 at Taiyuan Korean Church at Taiyuan, China. On March 5, 1938, my Dad was born at Tientsin, China. My Grandfather was so happy to have a son. He also loved the Lord very much and donated more than a tithe to God so that the Lord God could bless his business. My father told me that Grandpa was a man of God. Taewon is near Beijing, China.\n\nAlthough Wongil had no college education, he knew many languages: Korean, of course, Japanese, and Chinese, and often acted as an interpreter in the church. Once a Japanese pastor gave a sermon about the birth of Jesus Christ. He mimicked all kinds of animal sounds to express the joy of Jesus Christ’s birth. Grandfather was put into a trap because he couldn’t make the sounds as the pastor did. So, he said, “Birds make bird sounds. Tiger makes tiger sounds. And so on,” and avoided the predicament. Everyone laughed at the church.\n\nIn China, Grandpa was a very rich man. He once owned a lucrative coal mining and other businesses in China. He used to send my dad to a nursery by his personal chauffeur in a rickshaw. Milk was delivered to his home, and a huge ice cube was placed in a living room to cool the house and drinks. At then, refrigerator and air conditioner were not available.\n\nMy grandmother was also a woman of God. She married Wongil in an arranged marriage between Wongil’s parents and her family. They actually did not see each other before they fell in love.\n\nIn fact, they were married the same way that Rebekah and Isaac were married in Genesis 24. Their marriage was a miracle when they were both Christian. When my dad was born, my grandmother tried to teach my dad about the Bible since my dad was like a baby Jesus to her.\n\nIn 1944, when the Japanese were losing the war, the political situation in China became uncertain. Grandfather sent Grandmother and her children to North Korea where my Great-grandfather lived. During her stay in North Korea, Grandmother visited her mother’s home at Harbin, China. Unfortunately, Grandmother suffered from typhoid during her visit but miraculously recovered from her illness through the grace of God. At then typhoid was a deadly disease. Before the Japanese surrender in August 15, 1945, communications between China and North Korea were interrupted. Grandmother was worried about my grandfather and returned to Taiyuan, China, in June, 1945. A year later, they were able to return to Korea with very little things in their possessions, most left in China in fear of being killed by the Communist.\n\nIn 1947, the Lee family decided to leave North Korea to avoid the religious suppression of Communist North Korean regime. They tried to board a ship but fortunately got caught by the North Korean Army. The boat was too small, and with so many people on board, it might have sunk if it sailed that evening. The Lord God was with them. They were jailed and were miraculously released from the North Korean prison camps. Finally, they boarded another ship the next day to flee to South Korea. They were encamped at a refugee camp near Kaesong slightly north of the 38th Parallel. After they were released from the camps, they rode a train to Seoul. They met an old friend of Grandfather’s and stayed at their home for a few months, until they found a shelter arranged by Sung-nam Church. When they found their new home, they started to make a living. Grandfather told my Dad, “Eal, if you sell 10 Hershey bars, then the whole family can eat one Hershey bar.” My father was so excited and sold 10 Hershey bars. Keeping his promise, Grandfather prayed to God by thanking Him for providing his family a chocolate bar and divided it into seven pieces among the family. My Dad recalled that he never tasted such a delicious chocolate bar in his life.\n\nWhen the Korean War broke out, many refugees came down to South from North Korea. They begged for food as they passed by the Lee family. Grandmother shared their meal with them. She had this faith that God will provide. Instead, they starved.\n\nDuring the Korean War, the American and South Korean forces under the command of General Douglas MacArthur made their offensive move to Inchon, cutting off the North Korean supply line. After the American and South Korean forces landed at Inchon in September 15, 1950, they started to move into Seoul by bombing the North Korean positions. Dad told me that many died during the U.N. offensive campaign against the North Koreans. Yongsun, Great-grandfather, was one of those casualties and was hit by a shrapnel from a mortar into his chest. There was nothing they could do. My great-grandfather was bleeding. He was dying. My grandfather asked to follow his prayer and said, “Oh Lord, please accept my soul in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.” My great-grandfather barely finished his last prayer.\n\nMy Dad loved his grandfather very much and often told me about him. He really considered him to be his very best friend ever known to him. My father told me that Yongsun used to give him a ride on his shoulders when my dad was three or four. Yongsun loved my dad very much because my dad was the eldest son of the Lee family.\n\nDuring the war, there were many wounded and dead. Wha-soon, my aunt, was shot by an American bullet through her leg. Their house was lost by bombs. The whole city was on fire. Eun-man would have been my uncle. He was sick and crying. Dad saw his younger brother’s flesh touching his own bones. At the age of nine months, Eun-man no longer weeped anymore. Grandmother could not believe that Eun-man was not old enough to hear the gospel and started to weep for Eun-man.\n\nDespite all the hardship, Grandpa thanked God and prayed, “Thank you, Lord. Thank you for choosing me the same way you had chosen Job. When I go through my trials, I know that I am saved.” Wongil never complained to God. He was always faithful to the Lord although he had faced many trials.\n\nAfter the Korean War, my grandfather owned a small pulpit gown business, Sung-Eui-Sa (The Robe) which became the largest gown company in Korea. It served many pastors, church chairs, judges, and scholars in Korea. Wongil, my grandfather, had a portrait of Jesus Christ in his home always whether they were happy or in hardship. He stared at the portrait and smiled, but my father never understood why my grandfather bought that portrait. Even though God took everything that my grandfather had owned during the war, he was not financially rewarded. Despite the past hardships, he rarely complained to the Lord.\n\nMy dad married Minja Chung, my mother, on October 24, 1968. He was captain of the Republic of Korean Army, and he later was accepted to Stanford University as a graduate student in the materials science and engineering department. Later on, I was born and they named me Yosuk. My dad probably told all of his friends at Stanford that he had a son. Young-Shin, my grandmother, was so excited that I was born. Her grief disappeared when I was born. She probably thought that my birth replaced her Eun-man during the Korean War. Although I do not know Eun-man’s fate, I hope that Grandmother got to see Eun-man in her arms once again in heaven.\n\nAs my grandfather grieved over the loss of his wife to cancer, he did not complain to God. The Lord gave him a more Godly wife than Job’s who said, “Curse God and die.” [Job 2:9] He really felt that he was more blessed than Job.\n\nWhen I was four years old, I saw my grandfather pale and weak. He was really old, and he needed a wheelchair to move around the apartment at Stanford during his visit. My dad was getting a Ph.D. at Stanford and he noticed that Wongil’s health was deteriorating. I did not realize that he was about to die, and my dad took care of my grandfather. My dad told me that he always feared my grandfather because he hardly spoke, but he knew he loved him. My dad helped Wongil take a bath and defecate, and yet Wongil did not curse his Jesus. A few months later, he returned to Korea and ascended into heaven.\n\nThe HIstory Of Japanese Occupation Korea.\n\nKorea under Japanese rule\n\nHistory of Korea\n\nThis article is part of a series Prehistory Jeulmun period Mumun period Gojoseon 2333–108 BCE Jin Proto–Three Kingdoms 300–57 BCE Buyeo, Goguryeo, Okjeo, Dongye Samhan (Ma, Byeon, Jin) Three Kingdoms 57 BCE–668 Goguryeo 37 BCE–668 Baekje 18 BCE–660 Silla 57 BCE–935 Gaya 42–562 North and South States 698–926 Unified Silla 668–935 Balhae 698–926 Later Three Kingdoms 892–936 Taebong, Hubaekje, Silla Goryeo Dynasty 918–1392 Joseon Dynasty 1392–1897 Korean Empire 1897–1910 Japanese colonial period 1910–1945 Provisional Gov’t 1919–1948 Division of Korea 1945–present North, South Korea 1948–present By topic Timeline List of monarchs Linguistic history Science and technology history Art history Military history Naval history\n\nKorea Portal\n\nv · d · e\n\nKorea was under Japanese rule as part of Japan’s 35-year imperialist expansion (22 August 1910 to 15 August 1945). Japanese rule formally ended on 2 September 1945 upon the Japanese defeat in World War II that year.\n\nKorea was occupied and declared a Japanese protectorate in the 1905 Eulsa Treaty, and officially annexed in 1910 through the annexation treaty. Japan’s involvement in the region began with the 1876 Treaty of Ganghwa during the Joseon Dynasty and increased with the subsequent assassination of Empress Myeongseong (also known as “Queen Min”) in 1895. The 1905 and 1910 treaties were eventually declared “null and void” by both Japan and South Korea in 1965.\n\nIn Korea, the period is usually described as “Japanese Imperial Period” (Hangul: 일제시대, Ilje sidae, Hanja: 日帝時代). Other terms include “Japanese forced occupation” (Hangeul: 일제 강점기; Ilje gangjeomgi, Hanja: 日帝强占期) or “Wae (Japanese) administration” (Hangeul: 왜정, Wae jeong, Hanja: 倭政). In Japan, a more common term is “Joseon of the Japanese-Governed Period” (日本統治時代の朝鮮, Nippon Tōchi-jidai no Chōsen?).\n\nContents\n\n1 Background\n\n1.1 Debate to conquer Korea in Japan\n\n1.2 Treaty of Ganghwa\n\n1.3 Imo Incident, 1882\n\n1.4 Gapsin Coup, 1884\n\n1.5 Donghak Revolution and protests for democracy, 1894\n\n1.6 Assassination of Empress Myeongseong, 1895\n\n1.7 On the road to annexation\n\n2 Annexation of Korea\n\n2.1 Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty\n\n2.2 Independence movement\n\n2.3 World War II\n\n3 Economy and exploitation\n\n3.1 Japanese migration and land confiscation\n\n3.2 National Mobilization Law\n\n4 Politics and culture\n\n4.1 Assimilation of the royalty\n\n4.2 Cultural genocide\n\n4.3 Name changes\n\n4.4 Education in Korea under Japanese rule\n\n4.5 Relocation of cultural artifacts\n\n5 Koreans in the Japanese military\n\n6 Japanese brutalities\n\n7 Atomic bomb casualties\n\n8 Japan’s coverup efforts\n\n9 South Korean presidential investigation commission on Korean collaborators\n\nBackground\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century, various Western countries actively competed for influence, trade, goods, and territory in East Asia; Japan sought to join these modern colonial powers. The newly modernised Meiji government of Japan turned to Korea, then in the sphere of influence of China‘s Qing Dynasty. The Japanese government initially sought to separate Korea from Qing and make Korea a Japanese satellite in order to further the country’s security and national interests.[1]\n\nIn January 1876, following the Meiji Restoration, Japan employed gunboat diplomacy to pressure Korea to sign the Treaty of Ganghwa, an unequal treaty,[2] which opened three Korean ports to Japanese trade and granted extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens. The rights granted to Japan under the treaty were similar to those granted western powers in Japan following the visit of Commodore Perry.[2]\n\nDebate to conquer Korea in Japan\n\nMain articles: Seikanron and Sonnō jōi\n\nThe debate referred to as Seikanron (Debate to conquer Korea) was a major political conflagration which occurred in Japan in 1873. Saigō Takamori and his supporters insisted that Japan should confront Korea due to Korea’s refusal to recognize the legitimacy of Emperor Meiji as head of state of the Empire of Japan, and insulting treatment meted out to Japanese envoys attempting to establish trade and diplomatic relations. Those in favour also saw the issue in Korea to be an ideal opportunity to find meaningful employment for the thousands of out-of-work samurai, who had lost most of their income and social standing in the new Meiji social and economic order. These samurai posed a threat to the government, and (as a samurai himself) Saigō sympathized with their situation. According to orthodoxy, “Saigo himself volunteered to go to Korea as a special envoy, inviting an assassination attempt that would provide justification, if any were needed, for a punitive expedition.”[3]\n\nThe arguments against invading Korea were outlined in Okubo Toshimichi‘s “7 Point Document,” dated October 1873, in which he argued that action against Korea was premature because Japan was in the stages of modernizing and an invasion would be far too costly for Japan to sustain. Okubo’s views were supported by the anti-war faction, which mostly consisted of those returning from the Iwakura Mission in 1873. Iwakura Tomomi, the diplomat who had headed up the mission, had the emperor reverse the decision to send Saigo as an envoy to Korea, thus putting an end to the debate.\n\nTreaty of Ganghwa\n\nMain article: Treaty of Ganghwa\n\nThe Treaty of Ganghwa, also known in Japan as Japanese-Korea Treaty of Amity (Japanese language: 日朝修好条規 Nitchō-shūkōjōki, Korean language: 강화도조약),ganghwadojoyak signed on February 27, 1876, was designed to open up Korea to Japanese trade. It ended Korea’s status as a protectorate of China and opened three ports to Japanese trade.\n\nImo Incident, 1882\n\nIn 1882, followers of Heungseon Daewongun, the de facto ruler of Korea who had been forced into death by the supporters of Empress Myeongseong, staged a coup against the Empress and her allies.[4] Daewongun’s forces, or “old military,” killed Japanese officers in charge of training the new Korean Army and attacked the Japanese legation.[4] Japanese diplomats,[5] policemen,[6] students[7] and some Min clan members were also killed during the incident. Daewongun was restored to power, only to be forcibly taken to China by Chinese troops dispatched to Seoul to prevent further disorder.[4] In August 1882, the Korean government sent a mission to Japan and agreed to the stationing of Japanese troops to guard the legation in Seoul.[4]\n\nGapsin Coup, 1884\n\nMain article: Gapsin Coup\n\nSee also: Korean independence movement\n\nThe struggle between Daewongun’s followers and those of Empress Myeongseong was further complicated by competition from an independent Korean faction and a conservative Korean one. While the former sought Japan’s support, the latter sought China’s.[4] On December 4, 1884, a Korean independence group, assisted by the Japanese, attempted a coup and established a pro-Japanese government under the reigning king, dedicated to the independence of Korea from Chinese suzerainty.[4] However, this proved short-lived, as conservative Korean officials requested the help of Chinese forces stationed in Korea.[4] The coup was put down by Chinese troops, and a Korean mob killed both Japanese officers and Japanese residents in retaliation.[4] Some leaders of the independence faction, including Kim Okgyun, fled to Japan, while others were executed.[4]\n\nDonghak Revolution and protests for democracy, 1894\n\nMain article: Donghak Peasant Revolution\n\nThe outbreak of the Donghak Peasant Revolution in 1894 changed Japanese policy toward Korea. Korea had negotiated with Russia to counterbalance Japan’s growing influence. So Chae-pil and Protestant missionaries introduced Western political thought to Korea. Protesters took to the streets, demanding democratic reforms and an end to Japanese and Russian influence in Korean affairs. The Korean government asked for Chinese assistance in ending the revolt, and Meiji leaders decided upon military intervention to challenge China. When China sent troops into Korea, Japan responded by sending its own troops. Japan won the First Sino-Japanese War, and China signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895. Among its many stipulations, the treaty recognized “the full and complete independence and autonomy of Korea,” thus ending Korea’s protectorate relationship with the Chinese Qing dynasty, leading to the proclamation of the Korean Empire in 1897.\n\nAssassination of Empress Myeongseong, 1895\n\nThe Japanese minister to Korea, Miura Goro, orchestrated a plot against 43-year-old[8] Empress Myeongseong (“Queen Min”[9]), and on 8 October 1895, she was assassinated by Japanese agents.[10] In 2001, Russian reports on the assassin were found in the archives of the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation. The documents included the testimony of King Gojong, several witnesses of the assassination, and Karl Ivanovich Weber‘s report to Lobanov-Rostovsky, the Foreign Minister of Russia. Weber was the chargé d’affaires at the Russian legation in Seoul at that time.[10] According to a Russian eyewitness, Seredin-Sabatin (Середин-Cабатин), an employee of the Korean king, a group of Japanese agents and members of the Hullyeondae army entered the royal palace,[11] killed Empress Myeongseong and desecrated her body in the north wing of the palace.[12]\n\nWhen he heard the news, Daewongun returned to the royal palace the same day.[10] On 11 February 1896, King Gojong and the crown prince moved from Gyeongbokgung palace to the Russian legation in Seoul, from where they governed for about one year, an event known as the Korean royal refuge at the Russian legation.\n\nOn the road to annexation\n\nFlag of the Japanese Resident General of Korea. (1905-1910)\n\nThe rivalry between Russia and Japan exploded into the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, which Japan won.[13] Under the Treaty of Portsmouth, signed in September 1905, Russia acknowledged Japan’s “paramount political, military, and economic interest” in Korea.[13]\n\nA separate agreement was signed in secret between the United States and Japan at this time, which subsequently aroused anti-American sentiment among Koreans decades later.[13] The Taft-Katsura Agreement between the U.S. and Japan recognized U.S. interests in the Philippines and Japanese interests in Korea. Given the diplomatic conventions of the times, however, the agreement was a much weaker endorsement of the Japanese presence in Korea than either the Russo-Japanese peace treaty or a separate Anglo-Japanese accord.[13]\n\nTwo months later, Korea was obliged to become a Japanese protectorate.[13] A large number of Koreans organized themselves in education and reform movements, but by then Japanese dominance in Korea was a reality.[13]\n\nIn June 1907, the Second Peace Conference was held in The Hague. Emperor Gojong secretly sent three representatives to bring the problems of Korea to the world’s attention. The three envoys were refused access to the public debates by the international delegates who questioned the legality of the protectorate convention. Out of despair, one of the Korean representatives, Yi Jun, committed suicide at The Hague.[14]\n\nIn response, the Japanese government took stronger measures. On 19 July Emperor Gojong was forced to relinquish his imperial authority and appoint the Crown Prince as regent. Japanese officials used this concession to force the accession of the new Emperor Sunjong following abdication, which was never agreed to by Gojong. Neither Gojong or Sunjong was present at the ‘accession’ ceremony. Sunjong was to be the last ruler of the Joseon Dynasty, founded in 1392.[15]\n\nAnnexation of Korea\n\nJapan-Korea Annexation Treaty\n\nMain article: Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty\n\nGeneral power of attorney to Lee Wan-Yong signed and sealed by the last emperor, Sunjong (李坧) on August 22, 1910 (隆熙4年).\n\nIn May 1910, the Minister of War of Japan, Terauchi Masatake, was given a mission to finalize Japanese control over Korea after the previous treaties (the Japan-Korea Protocol of 1904 and the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty of 1907) had made Korea a protectorate of Japan and had established Japanese hegemony over Korean domestic politics. On 22 August 1910, Japan effectively annexed Korea with the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty signed by Lee Wan-Yong, Prime Minister of Korea, and Terauchi Masatake, who became the first Japanese Governor-General of Korea. Later research has invalidated most of these treaties. For example,\n\nThe scholars succeeded in revealing that Japan coerced Korea to sign two treaties that led to the colonization of the latter, pointing out that they were illegal. By using threats and intimidation, the island nation concluded the Japan-Korea Protocol in 1905 and the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty in 1910.[16]\n\nThe treaty became effective the same day and was published one week later. The treaty stipulated:\n\nArticle 1: His Majesty the Emperor of Korea concedes completely and definitely his entire sovereignty over the whole Korean territory to His Majesty the Emperor of Japan.\n\nArticle 2: His Majesty the Emperor of Japan accepts the concession stated in the previous article and consents to the annexation of Korea to the Empire of Japan.\n\nBoth the protectorate and the annexation treaties were declared void in the 1965 Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea because both treaties were obtained under threat of force, and that the Korean Emperor, whose royal assent was required to validate and finalize any legislation or diplomatic agreement under Korean law of the period, refused to sign the document.[17][18]\n\nIndependence movement\n\nMain article: Korean independence movement\n\nUpon Emperor Gojong’s death, anti-Japanese rallies took place nationwide, most notably the March 1st Movement of 1919. A declaration of independence was read in Seoul. It is estimated that 2 million people took part in these rallies. The Japanese violently suppressed the protests: According to Korean records, 46,948 were arrested, 7,509 killed and 15,961 wounded; according to Japanese figures, 8,437 were arrested, 553 killed and 1,409 wounded.[19] According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, about 7,000 people were killed by Japanese police and soldiers during the 12 months of demonstrations.[20]\n\nAfter suppression of the uprising, some aspects of Japanese rule considered most objectionable to Koreans were removed. The military police were replaced by a civilian force, and freedom of the press was permitted to a limited extent. Two of the three major Korean daily newspapers, the Dong-a Ilbo and the Chosun Ilbo, were established in 1920.\n\nPhoto memorialising the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, 1919\n\nObjection to Japanese rule over Korea continued, and the March 1st Movement was a catalyst for the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea by Korean émigrés in Shanghai on 13 April 1919. The modern South Korean government considers this Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea the de jure representation of the Korean people throughout the period of Japanese rule.\n\nThe Japanese occupation of Korea after annexation was largely uncontested militarily by the smaller, poorly-armed, and poorly-trained Korean army. Many former soldiers and other volunteers left the Korean peninsula for Manchuria and Primorsky Krai in Russia. Koreans in Manchuria formed resistance groups known as Dongnipgun (Liberation Army), which traveled across the Korean-Chinese border, using guerrilla warfare tactics against Japanese forces. The Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1932 and subsequent Pacification of Manchukuo deprived many of these groups of their bases of operation and supplies. Many were forced to either flee to China, or to join the Communist-backed forces in eastern Russia. One of the guerrilla groups was lead by the future leader of communist North Korea, Kim Il-Sung, in Japanese controlled Manchuria. Kim Il-Sung’s time as a guerrilla leader was formative upon his political ideology once he came to power.[21]\n\nWithin Korea itself, anti-Japanese rallies continued on occasion. Most notably, the Gwangju Students Anti-Japanese Movement on 3 November 1929 led to the strengthening of Japanese military rule in 1931, after which freedom of the press and freedom of expression were curbed. Many witnesses, including Catholic priests, reported that Japanese authorities dealt with insurgency severely. When villagers were suspected of hiding rebels, entire village populations are said to have been herded into public buildings (especially churches) and massacred when the buildings were set on fire.[22] In the village of Jeam-ni, Hwaseong, for example, a group of 29 people were gathered inside a church which was then set afire.[23] Such events deepened the hostility of many Korean civilians towards the Japanese government.\n\nWorld War II\n\nOn 9 December 1941, shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, under the presidency of Kim Gu, declared war on Japan and Nazi Germany. The Provisional Government banded together various Korean resistance guerilla groups such as the Korean Liberation Army, which was involved in combat on behalf of the Allies in various campaigns in China and parts of South East Asia. Tens of thousands of Koreans volunteered for the National Revolutionary Army and the People’s Liberation Army. The communist-backed Korean Volunteer Army (KVA) was established in Yenan, China, outside of the Provisional Government’s control, from a core of 1,000 deserters from the Imperial Japanese Army. After the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation, the KVA entered Manchuria, where it recruited from the ethnic Korean population and eventually became the Korean People’s Army of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\n\nTogo Shigenori (Park Moo-Duk, 박무덕) was the most prominent ethnic Korean serving Imperial Japan, as a Minister of Foreign Affairs and as a Minister of Greater East Asia during World War II. Korean general Hong Sa-ik (Kou Shiyoku) served as an Imperial Japanese Army General.\n\nFollowing the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the impending overrun of the Korean peninsula by Russian forces, Japan surrendered to the Allied forces on 15 August 1945, ending 36 years of Japanese occupation. American forces under General John R. Hodge arrived at the southern part of Korea on September 8. Colonel Dean Rusk proposed splitting Korea at the 38th parallel at an emergency meeting to determine postwar spheres of influence.\n\nThe representatives of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea were not allowed to participate in the San Francisco Peace Conference as their government lacked widespread international diplomatic recognition, nor was the Provisional Government a signatory to the treaty of peace with Japan[24]\n\nEconomy and exploitation\n\nOpening of railway from Seoul to Busan\n\nThe Korean economy went through significant changes during the Japanese occupation. There is no academic consensus on the influence of Japanese rule on the development of Korea. Some scholars argue that economic developments occurred during the period, while others claim that Japanese rule worsened the economic condition of Korea.[25] There were some modernization efforts however, and by the late 19th century, Seoul became the first city in East Asia to have electricity, trolley cars, water, telephone and telegraph systems all at the same time.[26] But Korea remained a largely backward agricultural economy at the turn of the century.[27] “Japan’s initial colonial policy was to increase agricultural production in Korea to meet Japan’s growing need for rice. Japan had also begun to build large-scale industries in Korea in the 1930s as part of the empire-wide program of economic self-sufficiency and war preparation.”[28]\n\nAccording to scholar Donald S. Macdonald, “for centuries most Koreans lived as subsistence farmers of rice and other grains and satisfied most of their basic needs through their own labor or through barter. The manufactures of traditional Korea–principally cloth, cooking and eating utensils, furniture, jewelry, and paper–were produced by artisans in a few population centers.”[27]\n\nDuring the early period of Japanese rule, the Japanese government attempted to completely integrate the Korean economy with Japan, and thus introduced many modern economic and social institutions, and invested heavily in infrastructure, including schools, railroads and utilities. Most of these physical facilities remained in Korea after the Liberation. The Japanese government played an even more active role in developing Korea than it had played in developing the Japanese economy in the late nineteenth century. Many programs drafted in Korea in the 1920s and 1930s originated in policies drafted in Japan during the Meiji period (1868-1912). The Japanese government helped to mobilize resources for development and provided entrepreneurial leadership for these new enterprises. Colonial economic growth was initiated through powerful government efforts to expand the economic infrastructure, to increase investment in human capital through health and education, and to raise productivity.[27]\n\nHowever, under Japanese rule, many Korean resources were utilized for Japan.[29] Economist Suh Sang-Chul points out that the nature of industrialization during the period was as an “imposed enclave,” so the impact of colonialism was trivial. Another scholar, Song Byung-Nak, states that the economic condition of average Koreans was aggravated during the period despite the economic growth. Most Koreans at the time could access only a primary school education under restriction by the Japanese, and this prevented the growth of an indigenous entrepreneurial class. A 1939 statistic shows that among the total capital recorded by factories, about 94 percent was Japanese-owned. While Koreans owned about 61 percent of small-scale firms that had 5 to 49 employees, about 92 percent of large-scale enterprises with more than 200 employees were Japanese-owned.[25][30][31]\n\nVirtually all industries were owned either by Japan-based corporations or by Japanese corporations in Korea. As of 1942, indigenous capital constituted only 1.5 percent of the total capital invested in Korean industries. Korean entrepreneurs were charged interest rates 25 percent higher than their Japanese counterparts, so it was difficult for large Korean enterprises to emerge. More and more farmland was taken over by the Japanese, and an increasing proportion of Korean farmers either became sharecroppers or migrated to Japan or Manchuria as laborers. As greater quantities of Korean rice were exported to Japan, per capita consumption of rice among the Koreans declined; between 1932 and 1936, per capita consumption of rice declined to half the level consumed between 1912 and 1916. Although the government imported coarse grains from Manchuria to augment the Korean food supply, per capita consumption of food grains in 1944 was 35 percent below that of 1912 to 1916.[28]\n\nThe Japanese government created a system of colonial mercantilism, requiring construction of significant transportation infrastructure on the Korean Peninsula for the purpose of extracting and exploiting resources such as raw materials (timber), foodstuff (mostly rice and fish), and mineral resources (coal and iron ore). The Japanese developed port facilities and an extensive railway system which included a main truck railway from the southern port city of Pusan through the capital of Seoul and north to the Chinese border. This infrastructure was intended not only to facilitate a colonial mercantilist economy, but was also viewed as a strategic necessity for the Japanese military to control Korea and to move large numbers of troops and materials to the Chinese border at short notice.\n\nFrom the late 1920s and into the 1930s, particularly during the tenure of Japanese Governor-General Kazushige Ugaki, concentrated efforts were made to build up the industrial base in Korea. This was especially true in the areas of heavy industry, such as chemical plants and steel mills, and munitions production. The Japanese military felt it would be beneficial to have production closer to the source of raw materials and closer to potential front lines for a future war with China.[32]\n\nBy the early 1930s, Japanese investment was curtailed by the Great Depression, competition for investment opportunities from the potentially more lucrative Manchukuo, and by Japan’s own limited economic capacity. [33]\n\nJapanese migration and land confiscation\n\nTerauchi Masatake, the first Japanese Governor-General of Korea, reestablished the preexisting Korean land-ownership system.\n\nPrior to the annexation of Korea, from around the time of the First Sino-Japanese War, Japanese merchants began settling in towns and cities in Korea seeking economic opportunity. By 1910, the number of Japanese settlers in Korea reached over 170,000, creating the largest overseas Japanese community in the world at the time.\n\nMany Japanese settlers were interested in acquiring agricultural land in Korea even before Japanese land ownership was officially legalized in 1906. Governor-General Terauchi Masatake facilitated settlement through land reform, which proved extremely unpopular with most of the Korean population. The Korean land ownership system was a complex system of absentee landlords, partial owner-tenants, and cultivators with traditional (but no legal proof of) ownership. Terauchi’s new Land Survey Bureau conducted cadastral surveys that reestablished ownership by basis of written proof (deeds, titles, and similar documents). Ownership was denied to those who could not provide such written documentation; these turned out to be mostly lower-class and partial owners who had only traditional verbal cultivator rights. Although the plan succeeded in modernizing the land ownership and taxation structures, it added tremendously to the bitterness and hostility of the time by enabling a huge amount of Korean land to be seized by the government and sold at subsidized costs to Japanese willing to settle in Korea as part of a larger effort at colonization.[34]\n\nJapanese landlords included both individuals and corporations such as the Oriental Development Company. Many former Korean landowners as well as agricultural workers became tenant farmers, having lost their entitlements almost overnight.\n\nHeadquarters of the Oriental Development Company in Seoul\n\nIt is estimated that by 1910 perhaps 7 to 8 percent of all arable land was under Japanese control. This ratio increased steadily; during the years 1916, 1920, and 1932, the ratio of Japanese land ownership increased from 36.8 to 39.8 to 52.7 percent. Conversely, the ratio of Korean ownership decreased from 63.2 to 60.2 to 47.3 percent. The level of tenancy was similar to that of farmers in Japan itself; however, in Korea, the landowners were mostly Japanese, while the tenants were all Koreans. As was often the case in Japan itself, tenants were forced to pay over half their crop as rent, forcing many to send wives and daughters into factories or prostitution to afford to pay taxes.[34]\n\nLee Yong Hoon, a controversial professor at Seoul National University and a leading critic of the “New Right” Foundation (뉴라이트재단), which is often called as “New Chinilpa,”[35][36] states that less than 10% of arable land actually came under Japanese control and rice was normally traded, not robbed. He also insists that Koreans’ knowledge about the era under Japanese rule is mostly made up by later educators.[37][38][39] Many of Lee’s arguments, however, have been contested.[40]\n\nKorea suffered from famine due to its economy’s overtaxation and lagged behind Japan in the rise of agricultural cooperatives and advances in cash crop production and mechanized agriculture.\n\nBy the 1930s, the growth of the urban economy and the exodus of farmers to the cities had gradually weakened the hold of the landlords. With the growth of the wartime economy, the government recognized landlordism as an impediment to increased agricultural productivity, and took steps to increase control over the rural sector through the formation of the Central Agricultural Association, a compulsory organization under the wartime command economy.\n\nNational Mobilization Law\n\nSee also: Koreans in Japan and Sakhalin Koreans\n\nKuniaki Koiso, Japanese Governor-General of Korea, implemented a draft of Koreans for wartime labor.\n\nFrom 1939, labor shortages as a result of conscription of Japanese males for the military efforts of World War II led to organized official recruitment of Koreans to work in mainland Japan, initially through civilian agents, and later directly, often involving elements of coercion. As the labor shortage increased, by 1942, the Japanese authorities extended the provisions of the National Mobilization Law to include the conscription of Korean workers for factories and mines on the Korean peninsula, Manchukuo, and the involuntary relocation of workers to Japan itself as needed.\n\nOf the 5,400,000 Koreans conscripted, about 670,000 were taken to mainland Japan (including Karafuto Prefecture, present-day Sakhalin, now part of Russia) for civilian labor. Those who were brought to Japan were often forced to work under appalling and dangerous conditions.[41] About 60,000 are estimated to have died between 1939 and 1945 from harsh treatment, inhumane working conditions and Allied bombings.[42] The total deaths of Korean forced laborers in Korea and Manchuria is estimated to be between 270,000 and 810,000.[42] The 43,000 ethnic Koreans in Karafuto, which had been occupied by the Soviet Union just prior to Japan’s surrender, were refused repatriation to either mainland Japan or the Korean peninsula, and were thus trapped in Sakhalin, stateless; they became the ancestors of the Sakhalin Koreans.[43]\n\nMost Korean atomic-bomb victims in Japan were drafted for work at military industrial factories in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.[44] In the name of humanitarian assistance, Japan paid South Korea 4 billion yen and built a welfare center for those suffering from the effects of the atomic bomb.[45]\n\nIn 1938, an estimated 800,000 ethnic Koreans were living in Japan as immigrants. The combination of immigrants and forced laborers during World War II brought the total to over 2 million by the end of the war, according to estimates by the American occupation authorities. In 1946, some 1,340,000 ethnic Koreans were repatriated to Korea, with 650,000 choosing to remain in Japan,[46] where they now form the Zainichi Korean community. A 1982 survey by the Korean Youth Association showed that conscripted laborers accounts for 13 percent of first-generation Zainichi Koreans.\n\nPolitics and culture\n\nResidents of the Korean peninsula, whether ethnic Korean or Japanese, did not have the right to vote or to hold office in Japan’s House of Representatives. The election law was amended in 1945 to allot 18 seats of the House of Representatives for the Korean peninsula, which did not go into effect because of the end of the war later the same year. Koreans in Japan were eventually given the right to vote and to hold office. Pak Chun-Geum (박춘금, 朴春琴) was the first ethnic Korean to be elected into the House of Representatives in 1932; he was re-elected in 1938 and continued to serve throughout World War II. Several members of the Korean royalty and aristocracy were appointed to the House of Peers, including Pak Yeong-Hyo (박영효, 朴泳孝) in 1932. Thirty-eight Koreans were elected into local assemblies in 1942.\n\nAssimilation of the royalty\n\nSee also: House of Yi\n\nFollowing the forced dissolution of the Korean Empire and the assassination of Empress Myeongseong at the hands of Japanese agents, Korean Palace Guard officers, Korean Army officers, Korean employee of Japanese, Korean Mandarinates (including Military Minister of Korea),[47] the Korean royalty was incorporated into the Imperial Household of Japan. The Emperor of Japan, Viscount Terauchi Masatake, Resident-General, and His Majesty the Emperor of Korea Yi Wan-Yong, Prime Minister, who upon mutual conference and deliberation had agreed to the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty,[17] made an effort to intermarry the royalty of the two houses in an attempt to validate the annexation of Korea. Yi Eun, then the Imperial Crown Prince of Korea, married Masako of Nashimotonomiya. Pro-Japanese Koreans (or Chinilpa) who supported or helped the annexation were also given peerage titles under the Japanese kazoku system. Lee Wan-Yong, the last prime minister of the Korean Empire, was given the title of hakushaku (Count) (which was later raised to koshaku, or Duke). In total, 76 Koreans were given peerage titles. After Korean independence, all titles were invalidated, and recipients formally charged with treason.\n\nCultural genocide\n\nThe Japanese colonization of Korea has been mentioned as a case in point of “cultural genocide” by a graduate student of the Comparative Genocide Studies group.[48]\n\nFocus was heavily and intentionally placed upon the psychological and cultural element in Japan’s colonial policy, and the unification strategies adopted in the fields of culture and education were designed to eradicate the individual ethnicity of the Korean race.[48]\n\nInitially, the Japanese sponsored several Korean language newspapers to counter the strong anti-Japanese message of the chief Korean publication Hwangson Sinmun (1898–1910). These papers included The Chosun Ilbo (1904).[49] The Korean language newspaper Maeil Sinbo (매일신보; 每日新報) continued publication until the Japanese surrender in 1945.[49][50]\n\nJapanese colonial authorities took many photographs of scenes of abject poverty in Korea, but did not take a single photograph of the main palace at Gyeongbokgung.[51]\n\nOther means of cultural suppression included altering public monuments, including several well-known temples, palaces, scripts, memorials, and statues. Songs and poems originally dedicated to Korean Emperors were re-written to adore the Japanese Emperor. Carved monuments underwent alterations to the Chinese characters to delete or change part of their meaning. Sungnyemun, a virtual symbol of Korea, was altered by the addition of large, Shinto-style golden horns near the roofs (later removed by the South Korean government after independence). The primary building of Gyeongbokgung was demolished and the Japanese General Government Building was built in its exact location. The Japanese colonial authorities destroyed 85 percent of all the buildings in Gyeongbokgung.[52]\n\nMany ancient Korean texts that were discovered mentioning Korean military and cultural exploits or Japan’s behavior as the Wokou were deleted methodically; in general, the awareness of Korean history among Koreans declined during this period; the new generation grew up with little or no awareness of their own heritage. Japan altered the history to rationalize the occupation of Korea to the international community by depicting the Koreans as backward and in need of modernization. In order to justify their need to take over their neighbors, “the Japanese convinced themselves that, despite being of the same race,” says Michael Breen, “the Koreans were actually hardly human.”[53] This was possible in part because Korea had sealed itself off from outside contact for centuries.\n\nThe Japanese Government conducted excavations of archeological sites and preserved artifacts found there.[54] Since many of the Japanese ideas were not supported by archeology, Japan decided to demonstrate their theories by moving a stone monument (棕蟬縣神祠碑), which was originally located at Liaodong, into Pyongyang,[55] and then distorted the location of Chinese commanderies such that they existed in Pyongyang. All these actions are viewed as an effort by Japan to destroy the ancient culture of Korea.\n\nResentment of the harsh treatment of Koreans eventually led to a revival of Korean nationalism, including in-depth research projects into Hangul (the Korean alphabet), which resulted in the standardization of the Korean writing system by scholars such as Lee Hui-Seung (이희승) and Choe Hyeon-bae (최현배) in the 1930s, as well as underground publications of books about historical Korean figures. Historians such as Shin Chae-ho were active in trying to present a Koreanized version of ancient history using textual material.\n\nName changes\n\nMain article: Sōshi-kaimei\n\nAttempts were made to better segregate individuals of Korean and Japanese ancestry. In 1911 a proclamation, “Matter Concerning the Changing of Korean Names” (朝鮮人ノ姓名改称ニ関スル件) was issued barring ethnic Koreans from taking Japanese names and to retroactively revert the names of Koreans that had already registered under Japanese names back to the original Korean ones.[56][56] By 1939, the focus had shifted towards colonial assimilation, and Imperial Decree 19 on Korean Civil Affairs (조선민사령; “勅令第19号「朝鮮民事改正令」”)[57] went into effect, whereby ethnic Koreans were permitted to surrender their Korean family name and adopt Japanese surnames. Although officially voluntary, many argue official compulsion and harassment existed against individuals, especially Korean government employees, who refused to create a new Japanese-style name.[58] There is disagreement as to whether this was the result of individual practices by low-level officials, the policy of some regional government organizations, or the overall intention of the colonial government. Others argue that Koreans felt compelled to adopt Japanese family names in order to avoid discrimination by Japanese. A country study conducted by the Library of Congress states that “the Korean culture was quashed, and Koreans were required to speak Japanese and take Japanese names.”[59][60][61] This name change policy, called Changssi-gaemyeong (창씨개명; 創氏改名), was part of Japan’s assimilation efforts.[62][63] The policy was extremely unpopular, with only some 9.6 percent of Koreans changing their last names to a Japanese one during the colonial occupation.[64] A number of prominent ethnic Koreans working for the Japanese government, including General Hong Sa-ik, insisted on keeping their Korean names. Another ethnic Korean, Park Chun-Geum (박춘금, 朴春琴), was elected as a member of the Lower House from the Tokyo Third District in the general election in 1932 and served two terms without changing his Korean name, but has been registered as chinilpa by the current Republic of Korea government.\n\nAfter the liberation of Korea from Japanese rule, the “Name Restoration Order” was issued on 23 October 1946 by the U.S. Army Military Government in Korea south of the 38th parallel, enabling Koreans to restore their names if they wished. Many Zainichi Koreans chose to retain their Japanese names, either to avoid discrimination, or later, to meet the requirements for naturalization as Japanese citizens.[65]\n\nEducation in Korea under Japanese rule\n\nKeijō Imperial University, Seoul\n\nFollowing the annexation of Korea, the Japanese administration introduced universal education[citation needed] patterned after the Japanese school system, with a pyramidal hierarchy of elementary, middle and high schools, culminating at the Keijō Imperial University in Seoul. As in Japan itself, education was viewed primarily as an instrument of “the Formation of the Imperial Citizen” (황민화; 皇民化) with a heavy emphasis on moral and political indoctrination. The Japanese colonial government provided educational material for Korean culture and language to some degree, such as a textbook of Hangul[66] and grammar to mix Hangul with Chinese characters (in the version designed by Kakugorō Inoue).[67] Classes focused mostly on teaching the history of the Japanese Empire as well as glorification of the Imperial House of Japan. The history of Korea was not part of the curriculum. As in Japan itself, students were made to worship at the school’s Shintō shrine regardless of their religious beliefs, bow before portraits of the Emperor, and copy the Imperial Rescript on Education. As the Japanese administrative policy shifted more strongly towards assimilation from the 1930s (同化政策; dōka seisaku), all classes were taught in Japanese with Korean language becoming an elective. During colonial times, elementary schools were known as “Citizen Schools” (국민학교; 國民學校; gungmin hakgyo) as in Japan, as a means of forming proper “Imperial Citizens” (皇國民; Hwanggungmin) from early childhood. Elementary schools in South Korea today are known by the name chodeung hakgyo (초등학교; 初等學校) (literally “Elementary School”) as the term gungmin hakgyo has recently become a politically incorrect term.\n\nAlthough the Japanese education system in Korea was detrimental towards the colony’s cultural identity, it helped lay the foundation of future economic growth by improving Korea’s human capital. By 1940, 38 percent of school-age Koreans were attending elementary school. Children of elite families were able to advance to higher education, while others were able to attend technical schools, allowing for “the emergence of a small but important class of well-educated white collar and technical workers… who possessed skills required to run a modern industrial economy.” The Japanese education system ultimately produced hundreds of thousands of educated South Koreans who later became “the core of the postwar political and economic elite.” [68]\n\nRelocation of cultural artifacts\n\nThe Japanese rule of Korea resulted in the relocation of many cultural artifacts to Japan. The issue over where these articles should be located began during the U.S. occupation of Japan.[69] It is known that at least 100,000 Korean artifacts were removed during Japanese rule.[69] In 2002, the controversy was reignited when two Koreans stole two statues from a west Japanese temple.[70]\n\nThe Chosun Ilbo (Korean Daily News) reports that valuable Korean artifacts can still be found in Japanese museums and private collections. According to an investigation by the South Korea government, there are 75,311 cultural artifacts that were taken from Korea. Japan has 34,369 and the United States has 17,803.[71] Korea frequently demands the return of these artifacts, but the United States and Japan do not comply.[72]\n\nOn August 10, 2010, Prime Minister of Japan Naoto Kan promised to return Korean artifacts which were seized during 1910-1945, while expressing “deep remorse”.[73]\n\nKoreans in the Japanese military\n\nKorean military participation until 1943[74] Year Applicants # accepted 1938 2,946 406 1939 12,348 613 1940 84,443 3,060 1941 144,743 3,208 1942 254,273 4,077 1943 303,294 6,300\n\nStarting in 1938, Koreans both enlisted and were conscripted into the Japanese military and the first “Korean Voluntary” Unit was formed. Among notable Korean personnel in the Imperial Army was Crown Prince Euimin, who attained the rank of lieutenant general. Some later gained administrative posts in the government of South Korea; well-known examples include Park Chung Hee, who became president of South Korea, Chung Il-Kwon (정일권,丁一權), prime minister from 1964 to 1970, and Paik Sun-Yup, South Korea’s youngest general, famous for his defense of the Pusan Perimeter during the Korean War. The first ten of the Chiefs of Army Staff of South Korea graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and none from the Korean Liberation Army.[75][76]\n\nRecruitment began as early as 1938, when the Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchuria began accepting pro-Japanese Korean volunteers into the army of Manchukuo, and formed the Gando Special Force. Koreans in this unit specialized in counter-insurgency operations against communist guerillas in the region of Jiandao. The size of the unit grew considerably at an annual rate of 700 men, and included such notable Koreans as General Paik Sun-Yup, who served in the Korean War. Historian Philip Jowett noted that during the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, the Gando Special Force “earned a reputation for brutality and was reported to have laid waste to large areas which came under its rule.”[77]\n\nDuring World War II, American soldiers frequently encountered Korean soldiers within the ranks of the Japanese army. Most notably was in the Battle of Tarawa, which was considered during that time to be one of the bloodiest battles in U.S. military history. A fifth of the Japanese garrison during this battle consisted of Korean laborers who were trained in combat roles. Like their Japanese counterparts, they put up a ferocious defense and fought to the death.[78][79]\n\nStarting in 1944, Japan started conscription of Koreans into the armed forces. All Korean males were drafted to either join the Imperial Japanese Army, as of April 1944, or work in the military industrial sector, as of September 1944. Before 1944, 18,000 Koreans passed the examination for induction into the army. Koreans provided workers to mines and construction sites around Japan. The number of conscripted Koreans reached its peak in 1944 in preparation for war.[80] From 1944, about 200,000 Korean males were inducted into the army.\n\nAfter the war, 148 Koreans were convicted of Class B and C war crimes, 23 of whom were sentenced to death (compared to 920 Japanese who were sentenced to death), including Korean prison guards who were particularly notorious for their brutality during the war. Justice Bert Röling, who represented the Netherlands at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, noted that “many of the commanders and guards in POW camps were Koreans – the Japanese apparently did not trust them as soldiers – and it is said that they were sometimes far more cruel than the Japanese.”[81] In his memoirs, Colonel Eugene C. Jacobs wrote that during the Bataan Death March, “the Korean guards were the most abusive. The Japs didn’t trust them in battle, so used them as service troops; the Koreans were anxious to get blood on their bayonets; and then they thought they were veterans.”[82][83] Korean guards were sent to the remote jungles of Burma, where Lt. Col. William A. (Bill) Henderson wrote from his own experience that some of the guards overlooking the construction of the Burma Railway “were moronic and at times almost bestial in their treatment of prisoners. This applied particularly to Korean private soldiers, conscripted only for guard and sentry duties in many parts of the Japanese empire. Regrettably, they were appointed as guards for the prisoners throughout the camps of Burma and Siam.”[84] The highest-ranking Korean to be prosecuted after the war was Lieutenant General Hong Sa-Ik, who was in command of all the Japanese prisoner-of-war camps in the Philippines.\n\nIn 2002, South Korea started an investigation of Japanese collaborators. Part of the investigation was completed in 2006 and a list of names of individuals who profited from exploitation of fellow Koreans were posted.[85] The collaborators not only benefited from exploiting their countrymen, but the children of these collaborators benefited further by acquiring higher education with the exploitation money they had amassed.[86]\n\nThe “Truth Commission on Forced Mobilization under the Japanese Imperialism Republic of Korea” investigated the received reports for damage from 86 people among the 148 Koreans who were accused of being the level B and C war criminals while serving as prison guards for the Japanese military during World War II. The commission, which was organized by the South Korean government, announced that they acknowledge 83 people among them as victims. The commission said that although the people reluctantly served as guards to avoid the draft, they took responsibility for mistreatment by the Japanese against prisoners of war. Lee Se-il, leader of the investigation, said that examination of the military prosecution reports for 15 Korean prison guards, obtained from The National Archives of the United Kingdom, confirmed that they were convicted without explicit evidence.[87]\n\nJapanese brutalities\n\nDuring Japanese colonial rule of Korea, many Koreans became victims of Japanese brutalities. Korean villagers hiding resistance fighters were dealt with harshly, often with summary execution, rape, forced labour, preventable famine, and looting.[88][89][90][91][92][93]\n\nSince on March 1, 1919, Anti-Japanese demonstration continued to spread, and as the Japanese national and military police could not contain the crowds, the army and even the navy were also called in. There were several reports of atrocities. In one notable instance, Japanese police in the village of Jeam-ri, Hwaseong herded everyone into a church, locked it, and burned it to the ground. They even shot through the burning windows of the church to ensure that no one made it out alive. Many of participants of the March 1st Movement were often subjected to torture and execution.\n\nDuring World War II, many Korean men were pushed into forced labor, and the toll of forced laborers from Korea in mainland Japan comes to 450,000.[94] Korean women also became victims of Japanese called the comfort women, who was served in the Japanese military brothels. Historians estimate the number of comfort women between 10,000 and 200,000, which included Japanese women.[95][96] According to testimonies, cases included that of Japanese officials and local collaborators kidnapping or recruiting poor rural women from Korea and other nations for sexual slavery under guise of offering factory employment. There is evidence the Japanese government intentionally destroyed official records regarding Comfort Women.[97][98] Japanese inventory logs and employee sheets on the battlefield show some documentation of government-sponsored sexual slavery. In one instance, names of known Comfort Women were traced to Japanese employment records. One such woman was falsely classified as a nurse along with at least a dozen other verified comfort women who were not nurses or secretaries. Currently, the South Korean government is investigating hundreds of cases on these lists.[99]\n\nKoreans, along with many other Asians, were experimented on in Unit 731, a secret military medical experimentation unit in World War II. The victims who died in the camp included at least 25 victims from the former Soviet Union, Mongolia and Korea.[100]\n\nColonial Korea was subject to the same Leprosy Prevention Laws of 1907 and 1931 as the Japanese home islands. These laws directly and indirectly permitted the segregation of patients in sanitariums, where forced abortions and sterilization were common. The laws authorized punishment of patients “disturbing the peace,” as most Japanese leprologists believed that vulnerability to the disease was inheritable.[101] In Korea, many leprosy patients were also subjected to hard labor.[102]\n\nAtomic bomb casualties\n\nMany Koreans were drafted for work at military industrial factories in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.[44] According to the secretary-general of a group named Peace Project Network, “there were a total of 70,000 Korean victims in both cities”. Japan paid South Korea 4 billion yen and built a welfare center in the name of humanitarian assistance, not as compensation to the victims.[45]\n\nJapan’s coverup efforts\n\nhhtp://www.Driwancybermuseum.wordpress.com\n\nMany argue that sensitive information about Japan’s occupation of Korea is difficult to obtain, and that this is due to the fact that the Government of Japan has covered up many incidents that would otherwise lead to severe international criticism.[97][98][103] Koreans have often expressed their abhorrence of human experimentation carried out by the Imperial Japanese Army where people often became human test subjects in such macabre experiments as liquid nitrogen tests or biological weapons development programs (See articles: Unit 731 and Shiro Ishii). Though some vivid and disturbing testimonies have survived, they are largely denied by the Japanese Government even to this day.[103][104]\n\nThe Japanese Government was recently accused of the burial of non-Japanese test-subject bodies from World War II several dozen feet below buildings in Japanese urban areas (such as the bodies found under the Toyama No. 5 apartment blocks) in order to cover up wartime experiments. The government denied any responsibility. The existence of unmarked mass graves on the “west side of Tokyo is deeply troubling”. The testimony of Toyo Ishii, a nurse involved in the coverup, was downplayed or ignored.[103][104][105] “After more than 60 years of silence, the 84-year-old nurse’s story is the latest twist in the legacy of Japan’s rampage.” These coverups and falsification of data have made accurate assessment of Japan’s impact on Korea very difficult.\n\nSouth Korean presidential investigation commission on Korean collaborators\n\nIn 2006, Roh Moo-hyun, the President of South Korea, appointed an investigation commission into the issue of locating descendants of pro-Japanese collaborators from the times of the 1890s until the collapse of Japanese rule in 1945.\n\nIn 2010, the commission concluded its five volume report. As a result, the land property of 168 South Korean citizens has been confiscated by the government, these citizens being descendants of pro-Japanese collaborators.[106]\n\n[edit] See also\n\nKorean independence movement\n\nProvisional Government of the Republic of Korea\n\nJapanese war crimes\n\nJapanese-Korean disputes\n\nChinilpa\n\n[edit] Notes and references\n\nthe end @ copyright DR Iwan Suwandy 2011\n\nMUSEUM DUNIA MAYA DR IWAN S.\n\nDr IWAN ‘S CYBERMUSEUM\n\nTHE FIRST INDONESIAN CYBERMUSEUM\n\nMUSEUM DUNIA MAYA PERTAMA DI INDONESIA\n\nDALAM PROSES UNTUK MENDAPATKAN SERTIFIKAT MURI\n\nPENDIRI DAN PENEMU IDE\n\nTHE FOUNDER\n\nDr IWAN SUWANDY, MHA\n\nWELCOME TO THE MAIN HALL OF FREEDOM\n\nSELAMAT DATANG DI GEDUNG UTAMA “MERDEKA\n\nShowroom :\n\nThe Driwan’s Cybermuseum\n\n(Museum Duniamaya Dr Iwan)\n\nPlease Enter\n\nDMC SHOWROOM\n\n(Driwan Dai Nippon Cybermuseum)\n\nShowroom :\n\nThe Driwan Dai Nippon War’s book\n\n(Buku Karangan Dr Iwan “Perang Dai Nippon)\n\nFrame One:\n\nIntroductions\n\n1.I have the complete collection of postal and ocument history during Dai Nippon Occupations Java Island 1942-1945, chronology day per day from the Capitulation day on March,8th.1945 to August,17th,1945(2605) ,also until The Japanese Army back Home to their homeland Dec.1945 but the Dai nippon revenue still used by Republic Indonesai until 1947.\n\n2.

The Japanese were quickly able to advance down the Malayan peninsula, forcing the Commonwealth forces to retreat towards Singapore. The British lacked aircover and tanks; the Japanese had total air superiority. The sinking of HMS Prince of Wales and HMS Repulse on December 10, 1941 led to the east coast of Malaya being exposed to Japanese landings and the elimination of British naval power in the area. By the end of January 1942, the last Allied forces crossed the strait of Johore and into Singapore. Hong Kong surrendered to the Japanese on Christmas Day.\n\nIn the Philippines, the Japanese pushed the combined Filipino-American force towards the Bataan peninsula and later the island of Corregidor. By January 1942, General Douglas MacArthur and President Manuel L. Quezon were forced to flee in the face of Japanese advance. This marked among one of the worst defeats suffered by the Americans, leaving over 70,000 American and Filipino prisoners of war in the custody of the Japanese.\n\nOn February 15, 1942, Singapore, due to the overwhelming superiority of Japanese forces and encirclement tactics, fell to the Japanese, causing the largest surrender of British-led military personnel in history. An estimated 80,000 Indian, Australian and British troops were taken as prisoners of war, joining 50,000 taken in the Japanese invasion of Malaya (modern day Malaysia). Many were later used as forced labour constructing the Burma Railway, the site of the infamous Bridge on the River Kwai.\n\nDuring 1943 and 1944, Allied forces, backed by the industrial might and vast raw material resources of the United States, advanced steadily towards Japan. The Sixth United States Army, led by General MacArthur, landed on Leyte on 19 October 1944. In the subsequent months, during the Philippines Campaign (1944–45), the combined United States and the Philippine Commonwealth troops, together with the recognized guerrilla units, liberated much of the Philippines.\n\nDai nippon War Part Three.\n\n“The Dai nippon War In China”\n\nProlog\n\nDAI NIPPON WAR IN CHINA\n\n(3)1932\n\n(a)january 1932\n\nThe Japanese seized the Northeastren China Province in 1932.In manchuria a violent tension had arisen in shanghai between dai Nippon and chinese, a tension which led the landing of Dai Nippon Marines on January 28th 1932 for what was expected to be a rapid and simple action-the dispersal of the Chinese defensive forces.Mao Comunist local pst office issued the thirs stamps nominal 4 cent design Communist emblem in the star.\n\n(b) The Japanese stamps used at Daeren. manchuria 1932.\n\n(c)The vintage picture photo from vintage dutch enciclopedia, Emperor Puyi (the young man with jacket) with the Dai Nippon soldier and the Manchuira government official(P)\n\n(d)Januaty 1932\n\nROC soldier moving to the front after Dai Nippon invasion of Shanghai in January 28th,1932.\n\n(e) The Vintage picture photo book illustration .Profile of Araki Sadao, Dai Nippon General and menistry of war of prime menistry Inoekai (Dec 1931-Jan 1934).
