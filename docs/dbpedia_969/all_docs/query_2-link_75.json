        "text": "Married to the rather weak and hesitant king Friedrich Wilhelm III, and she showed both courage and intelligence in a difficult situation for the country. In 1806 she and a group of followers realized that reforms were needed in order to revitalize the kingdom, and she used the crisis for a new start. As the politicians and military leaders did not know what to do, she personally met Napoleon I in Tilsit in 1807, and tried to limit the consequences of the Prussian defeat to the Napoleonic forces. She became a European myth of female beauty, charisma and warmth of her heart. Mother of 7 children, she died of a pneumonia, and lived (1776-1810).\n\nAfter the death of her husband, Ludwig Friedrich, she was regent for son Friedrich Günther (1793-1807-67). In the first year of her reign, the Principality joined the Confederation of the Rhine (Rheinbund), which meant that it stood under the protection of Napoleon until 1813 and 2 years later, the state joined the German Federation (Deutschen Bund). As he did not show any interest in the government, she remained de-facto in charge of the government until her death. He Günther was succeeded by his younger brother Albert (1798-1867-69). She was also known as Caroline Louise Ulrike, and lived (1771-1854).\n\nMother of Obanosa of Benin (1804-16), his successor Ogbebo reigned for less than a year. As Queen Mother she was a senior town chief. She lived in her own palace outside the capital. She did not appear in public and did not have an official role in the political system, but she was always \"consulted\" by important political decisions, and her vote was necessary in the political decision process. As widow of the former king and mother of the present, she was given semi-male status. She had a \"wife\" with the title of Amoda, she was surrounded by Amada, naked boys and has a whole court of officeholders.\n\nAlso known as Cheng I Sao, she took over as leader of the enormous pirate fleet which included between 1.500 and 1.800 ships and 80.000 male and female pirates when her husband, Cheng I, was killed in a typhoon in 1807. He had created a powerful confederation controlling the sea-lanes from Hong Kong to the Vietnamese border. Born into a family practicing piracy for many generations, he fought with rebel forces in Vietnam. When he returned to China in 1801, he made himself leader of the pirates in the Kwang-tung Province, and by 1806, virtually every Chinese vessel passing the coast paid protection money. Although Cheng's corsairs avoided large European vessels, they captured foreign sailors and held them for ransom. After Cheng Shih became leader of the pirates she issued a code of laws that added even more power to the pirate confederation. The code was short and severe. Anyone caught giving commands on his own or disobeying those of a superior was to be decapitated. It was a capital offence to pilfer from the common treasury or steal from the villagers who regularly supplied the pirates. Desertion or absence without leave resulted in a man's ear being cut off and his being paraded through his squadron. Raping female captives was also a capital offence, and if there was fornication by mutual consent, the pirate was to be beheaded and the female captive cast overboard with a weight on her legs. The pirate confederation was so strong that for years it held power over the Chinese military along the coast, and they made an alliance with the western powers and in 1809 the pirates were defeated. Nothing is known about what happened to her afterwards.\n\nGoverned in the name of her husband, Jaswant Rao Holkar, who after the defeat of Scindia of Gwalior in 1803, took on the British forces and defeated Col. William Monson and besieged Delhi. He was however, defeated by Gen. Gerard (Lord) Lake at Dig and Farrukhabad in November of 1804, and was compelled to make peace a year later. Soon after, he became insane and died in 1811. Afterwards she was regent for Malhar Rao III Holkar (1801- 1833), until she was deposed and beheaded on the banks of the Sipra and her remains thrown into the river, 20th December 1817. The new regent was Rani Krishnabai. She was daughter of Ajiba, a priest of the Manbhoo sect.\n\nHer father, Vira Raja, left her as his successor. Her uncle, Linga Raja, however, after acting as regent in her name, announced in 1811, his own assumption of the government. He died in 1820, and was succeeded by his son Vira Raja, a youth of twenty, and a monster of sensuality and cruelty. Among his victims were all the members of the families of his predecessors, including Devammaji, and in 1834 the British deposed him. Coorg or Kodagu was an ancient kingdom in present day's Karnataka, and the area is inhabited by many ethnic minorities.\n\nTogether with her husband, Manuel Ascencio Padilla (1774-1816), she was co-ruler of the Eastern Bolivian area on the boarder to Argentina that was established during the wars for independence. When Bolivia declared its independence in 1809, her husband and she raised a small army to fight for an independent republic. Her husband was killed early into the war, but she continued to fight against royalist forces until Bolivia became an independent republic in 1826 when Spanish forces were finally overthrown. Juana Azurduy had managed to form a small \"republiqueta\" (little republic) with the territory her small army held. This republiqueta was basically under siege from 1810 until 1825 when other republican armies under Simon Bolivar were able to join her remote forces. She lived (1781-1862).\n\nIn 1809 her husband, Karl XIII became king after his nephew, Gustav IV Adolf, had been deposed. Karl had been regent for Gustav Adolf during his minority 1792-96. She became leader of the Gustavian Party, and worked for the declaration Gustav Adolf's son, prince Gustav as king, with her husband as regent. She was politically influential also because her husband had a stroke shortly after ascending to the throne. The following year, Prince Christian August of Augustenborg was elected as heir to the throne and assumed the name Karl August. He died the same year and subsequently Jean Baptiste Bernadotte was elected heir and adopted by her and her husband, but they never had a close relationship since she still preferred prince Gustaf as heir. Hedwig Elisabeth Charlotta was mother of one son who died one week old, and died 6 months after her husband, having lived (1759-1818).\n\nWhen her elder sister Regent Maharani Gowri Lakshmi Bayi died after childbirth in 1815 she was only thirteen years of age and being the only female left in the family, besides her deceased sister's little daughter, she became Regent Maharani on behalf of her nephew, the heir, Maharajah Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma. She was on her accession actively counselled by her brother in law, Raja Raja Varma of the Changanssery Royal family as well as her husband, Raghava Varma, who belonged to the Royal family of Kilimanoor. Her first act was to appoint a new Dewan, and she continued the reforms of her older sister. Christians got more freedom and some of the restrictions put on some of the lower castes were removed, she also introduced health reforms. er mother, Princes Atham of the Travancore, was the Senior Rani of Attingal. Her first husband was Raghava Varma of the Kilimanoor Royal family and after his death she married his brother After his death in 1824, she married again, but did not have any children. She lived (1802-53).\n\nIn 1810 her husband, Louis Bonaparte abdicated as king in favour of their second surviving son, Napoleon Louis (b. 1804) after four years on the throne, and appointed her as regent, before going into exile. The following year she gave birth to a fourth son who was put in the care of his paternal grandmother, Madame de Souza. After Napoleon I's surrender, she received the title of Duchesse de Saint-Leu, and lost the rank of Queen. Her husband only received the title of Count de Saint-Leu. In 1814 she and Louis Napoleon were divorced. Her third son Louis Napoleon was later first elected President and then became emperor Napoleon III of France. Hortense was daughter of Vicomte Alexander de Beauharnais and the later Empress Joséphine (see below), and she spend the years from five to 10 on Martinique when her parents separated. She lived (1783-1837).\n\nTook active part in the government during the reign of her brother, Alexander I of Russia. After their marriage in 1809 her husband, Georg von Oldenburg (1784-1812) was appointed Governor-General of Tver province and she took an active part in his reign. When Napoleon annexed the German territories on the Baltic, including her husband's Grand Duchy, her brother protested against what he considered a personal offence, and together with other events this resulted in the war between France and Russia. The Tsar adopted the reactionary ideas of a patriotic group, which she dominated, and during the Napoleonic Wars in 1812-15 she formed a special regiment of chasseurs. In 1812 some conspirators planned to deposed Tsar Alexander and put her on the throne. 1816 she married her cousin King Wilhelm of Wurttemberg and she dedicated her time on establishing charitable institution, education and culture. The daughter of Pavel I Petrovich Romanov, Tsar of Russia and Sophie Marie Dorothea von Württemberg, known as Tsarina Maria Fyodorovna, she was mother of two sons by her first husband, and two daughters by her second, and lived (1788-1819).\n\nDominated the naval operations of the War of Independence in 1821. After her husband, Bouboulis was killed during a battle with Algerian pirate ships in 1811; she took over his trading operations and the preparation for the revolution. She became a member of the Filiki Etaireia, the secret organization which was preparing the revolution all over Europe, and had the Agamemnon, her flagship, and three more war ships built at her own expenses. Finally, she boarded the Agamemnon and personally took part in the sieges of Nafplion and Monemvasia by sea, as well as in the sacking of Tripolis by land. She took part in the battle of Argos and other battles of the Peloponese at the head of her own private army. The Daughter of the Hydriot captain Stavrianos Pinotsis, she was born in the prison of Constantinople, and she murdered during a family feud. She lived (1771-1825).\n\nArrived in London in 1812 with her husband, the Russian ambassador, Fürst Christoph von Lieven (1777-1839). She supported him loyally and, having made a position for herself in English society, began to render him invaluable service in furthering Russian foreign policy. She identified those political figures that could be of use and applied herself to persuading or manipulating them. Her choice of lovers was dictated entirely by her perception of Russias interests, and included Metternich, Wellington, Aberdeen, Canning, Grey and Guizot. She was the spider at the heart of a fine and complex web. In the 1820s the sessions of the Congress of Verona actually took place in her drawing room, and she acted as a conduit between diplomats and brought together ministers who misunderstood or distrusted each other. Among others she had a significant role in ending Britains isolation under Canning and in avoiding a European crisis over the Greek question in the mid-1820s. She was intimate with George IV and badgered prime ministers and influenced the shape of their cabinets. The Russian interests she served had broadly coincided with British ones to begin with, but they began to diverge, and the crises of 1830 over the revolutions in France, Belgium and Poland revealed just how far removed absolutist Russias policies were from the liberal instincts of British society. By the time of her husbands recall in 1834, Dorotheas position had become untenable. \"There never figured on the Courtly stage, a female intriguer more restless, more arrogant, more mischievous, more (politically, and therefore we mean it not offensively) odious than this supercilious Ambassadress,\" ran a scorching valediction in The Times.

She worked in particular to overcome the taboos placed on women in the islanders' traditional religion and scored a major victory in persuading Kamehameha II to eat publicly with women.

To ensure the Kamehameha line, she married the two leading contenders for the throne, King Kuamalii of Kauai and his son. She worked closely with the Christian missionaries and was baptized in 1825.

Queen Pomare politely agreed, but as soon as the warship left Papeete, she sent a letter to Queen Victoria, asking for British protection. Britain declined to interfere, which opened the door for a Frenchman to trick several Tahitian chiefs into signing a document requesting that Tahiti be made a protectorate of France. The French were in fact interested in a South Pacific port, and when word of the document reached Paris, a ship was dispatched to Papeete. Tahiti became a French protectorate in 1842. Unaware of the document she continued to resist. Her subjects launched an armed rebellion against the French troops, who surrounded her Papeete palace and forced her to retreat to Raiatea. The fighting continued until 1846, when the last Tahitian stronghold was captured and the remnants of their guerrilla bands retreated to Tahiti Iti, the island's eastern peninsula.

She achieved the status of warrior when she single-handedly turned a Blackfoot ambush in order to protect a fort that was sheltering both Crow and white families. Her victories were many, and were counted by her growing herd of horses and the scalp locks she collected. She was made a part of the Council of Chiefs and became known as Woman Chief. So powerful was she that she was ranked third in a band of 160 lodges. She acquired four women who took care of her home, her holdings, and performed the womanly duties she had no taste for. White men who crossed Pine Leaf's path along the fur trade route were totally confounded by her. Since there was nothing in their own cultures they could compare to Pine Leaf, she became known as the Absaroka Amazon among the white traders. Following the Treaty of Laramie in 1851, Pine Leaf gave up her warrior ways to became active in peacemaking with the tribes of the upper Missouri and often visited her own people, the Gros Ventre. While there was an uneasy peace, which lasted for several years, Pine Leaf was ambushed and killed by her own blood - the Gros Ventre.

She was responsible for enforcing Hawaiis first penal code, proclaimed by the King in 1835. She became a Christian in 1830, and was involved in the persecution of Hawaiian Catholics and attempts to expel French priests.

Returning secretly in 1832, she organized a small, unsuccessful uprising in an attempt to win the throne her son Henri, later known as the Comte de Chambord, who was born almost eight months after the assassination of her husband, the French prince, Charles Ferdinand, duc de Berry. For these activities she was imprisoned. However, when it became obvious that the Duchesse was pregnant, she was forced to reveal her secret second marriage to an Italian count. This marriage alienated her royalist supporters, and the French government released her from prison, but she was sent into exile again. She was daughter of Francisco I of the Two Sicilies, and lived (1798-1870).\n\nIsabella succeeded to the Spanish throne on the death of her father, Ferdinand VII, when Salic Law was set aside, but her uncle, Don Carlos, disputed her rights. This led to the First Carlist War, 1833-1839, while her mother, and then General Baldomero Espartero, served as regents. Her reign was one long succession of palace intrigues, back-stairs and antechamber influences; barrack conspiracies, military revlots to further the ends of the political parties and 60 different governments. She often interfered in politics in a wayward, unscrupulous manner that made her very unpopular. She showed most favour to her reactionary generals and statesmen, to the Church and religious orders, and was constantly the tool of corrupt and profligate courtiers and favourites who gave her court a bad name. She went into exile at the end of September 1868, after her generals had made a slight show of resistance that was crushed at the battle of Alcolea by Marshals Serrano and Prim. Other events of her reign were a war against Morocco, which ended in an advantageous treaty for Spain and some Moroccan cession of territory; some progress in public works, especially railways and a slight improvement in commerce and finance. She was rumoured to have chosen her Bourbon cousin, Francisco de Asis, titular king, as husband because he was impotent, and they largely lived apart, though they did have children. She abdicated in 1870 in favour of her son, Alfonso XII, who ruled from 1874. Even though she eventually returned to Spain, she never again exerted much political power or influence. She was mother of around 14 children of whom only her son, Alfonso XII, and four daughters survived. She lived (1830-1904).\n\nWidow of Fernando VII, she was in charge of the regency for daughter Isabel II. She liberalized the constitution and sanctioned certain anticlerical measures. In 1833 she secretly married Fernando Muñoz, which made her highly unpopular when discovered. The following year Don Carlos instigated the first Carlist War. He was defeated in 1837, but the war was not officially concluded until 1839. In the meantime María Cristina was pressured into appointing a Progressionist minister and accepting a new compromise constitution. In 1840 the Progressionist leader, General Baldomero Esparto revolted, forcing her to resign and leave the country. Esparto then took over as regent. She later made an attempt to return, but failed, and retired in exile to France in 1854. She lived (1806-78).\n\nHer titles included the role of Sovereign of The Channel Islands and Lord of Mann. Also Princess of Hanover, Duchess of Braunschweig and Lüneburg. It was during her reign that the modern idea of the constitutional monarch, whose role was to remain above political parties, began to evolve. But Victoria herself was not always non-partisan and she took the opportunity to give her opinions - sometimes very forcefully - in private. After the death of her husband, Albert of Sachsen-Coburg-Gotha, in 1861, she sank into depression. She was persuaded to open Parliament in person in 1866 and 1867, but she was widely criticised for living in seclusion and quite a strong republican movement developed. (Seven attempts were made on Victoria's life, between 1840 and 1882) With time, the private urgings of her family and the flattering attention of the Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. During Victoria's long reign, direct political power moved away from the sovereign, but she showed that a monarch who had a high level of prestige and who was prepared to master the details of political life could exert an important influence. The mother of nine children, she lived (1818-1901).\n\nWhen Kekāuluohi succeeded her half-sister, Kina'u, she declared: \" The authority hitherto possessed by my mother Kaahumanu II. Until her decease is now transferred to my other mother (Miriam Kekāuluohi) though Victoria Kamehamalu II is her superior, but still under my direction.\" Initially, she was considered something of a \"place-holder\" for Kīnaus infant daughter Victoria Kamāmalu, who would later assume the office. As Kuhina nui she signed, with the king, all official documents; conducted all executive business affecting the Crown; received and transferred government lands; and served as special Councillor to the king, with exclusive veto power over his decisions. She was a co-signer with Kamehameha III of the country's first Constitution in 1840, which provided for an elected representative body, a first step toward the common people gaining political power. The constitution also codified for the first time, the responsibilities and authority of the Kuhina Nui. As a child she was betrothed to a prince of the Pomare line of Tahiti, but because of the prince's early death, the union never took place. In 1809 she married the first of her seven husbands, her uncle Kamehameha, as a companion in his final years, until his death in 1819. She then married her cousin, King Lihohilo Kamehameha II (1797-1824) and later to Kana'ina and one of her two children, William Charles Lunalilo, later became king of Hawai'i. . She was daughter of Alii Kalaimamahu and Alii Kaheiheimalie Kalakaua, both Governors of Maui, and died from influenza, after having lived (1794-1845).\n\nThe Senior Queen, Samrajyalaxmi Devi, has been working to bring to been about the downfall of General Bhimsen Thapa since 1837 as he was accused of having poisoned her infant son, Devendra Bikram Shah. He was therefore arrested and out on irons. Her husband, king Rajendra Birkrama Shah (1816-47), was unable to rule himself, and she took the reigns. She made several appointments of senior state managers and miltary commanders. When Pushkar Shah was dismissed from the office of Mukhtiyar she expressed her desire to pass the rest of her life in Banaras and left in the beginning of 1842. Her husband followed her in an attempt to persuade her to return. The East India Company Government did not permit her to enter India territory and she then came back to Kathmandu and suggested that her husband become should abdicate so that she carry on the administration as Regent with Prince Surendra Bikram Shah on the throne. But since he did not agree to this proposal she then again left fro the Tarai. This time King Rajendra did not follow her. Soon after she returned to Kathmandu because she was suffering from malaria. No physician was ready to treat her at risk of his life. The result was that she died in October 1842."
