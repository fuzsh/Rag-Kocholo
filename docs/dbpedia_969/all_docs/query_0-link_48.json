        "text": "Get excited, everyone: it’s time to review the bridal garb of another just-married princess! On Saturday, Maria Theresia of Thurn and Taxis, a member of a German princely family, married British artist Hugo Wilson in Bavaria. Let’s have a gander at the jewels, shall we?\n\nAlthough the Thurn and Taxis family sold off many of their most spectacular royal jewels after the death of Maria Theresia’s father, Prince Johannes, the family does still have some baubles in the vaults. But the bride chose not to attempt any of the skyscraper tiaras from the family’s collection, instead wearing a rather delicate floral headband.\n\nThe little flower crown encircled the bride’s head — you can see it here beneath her veil. It’s difficult to tell what it’s made of — possibly a light metal? No matter what the material is, the flower crown is a far cry from her mother’s bridal tiara a generation ago: the pearl and diamond tiara from the French crown jewels.\n\nThe TnT family is known for its eccentricities, and lest you think that Maria Theresia went wholly conservative with her bridal attire, have a glance at her Vivienne Westwood bridal gown! The skirt is made of an intriguing printed fabric. I’ve been wondering whether perhaps this is a screen printing of one of her new husband’s paintings on the gown? If anyone knows, please pipe up in the comments! (Here are some examples of his work, just for stylistic comparison.)\n\nMaria Theresia’s mother, the larger-than-life Princess Gloria, has toned down her look considerably over the decades, though she still has a flair for the dramatic in her dressing. For her daughter’s wedding, Gloria wore a pink gingham dirndl, accessorizing with pearls, white gloves, and a white fur.\n\nBut check out the necklace worn by the bride’s sister, Elisabeth! I can’t help but love the incredible exaggeration of this piece, and I always like dark purple against icy blue. It’s ridiculous, but it’s so ridiculous that it’s kind of chic.\n\nThe whole Thurn and Taxis clan was adorably excited at the wedding. The tall, phone-wielding man in the center of the photo is Maria Theresia’s brother, Albert. He’s the 12th Prince of Thurn and Taxis. Trivia fact: the TnT family got their princely title from a Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I, because they were the Postmasters General of part of the Holy Roman Empire! Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night…\n\nA good semi-royal wedding always brings tons of familiar faces out of the woodwork. Tatiana Casiraghi, daughter-in-law of Princess Caroline of Monaco, wore purple satin and an absolutely ENORMOUS pair of earrings.\n\nThe Casiraghis are linked to German royalty via Princess Caroline’s (estranged) marriage to Ernst August of Hanover. His two sons attended the wedding with their mother, Chantal. She wore a jacket that came with its own accessories, but she also added a couple of large rings and an oversized wristwatch.\n\nThe bride’s mother was born into a Bavarian noble family, the Schönburg-Glachaus. Gloria’s sister, Countess Maya of Schönburg-Glachau, paired pearls with her striped dress. Her daughter, Pilar Flick, also wore a single-stranded necklace.\n\nGloria’s brother, Count Alexander of Schönburg-Glachau, attended his niece’s wedding with his wife, Irina. She’s the one wearing the coral and gold jacket, and she appears to have gotten the big-earring memo from the Casiraghi camp.\n\nThe groom’s family may not be from noble or royal lineage, but they certainly fit the bill sartorially at the wedding. The groom’s mother paired a pendant necklace with her yellow dress. I can’t quite decide if his sister is wearing a separate necklace or if the piece is an embellishment on her dress, but I like it. (Her hat, unfortunately … not so much.)\n\nBack to the nobles, then. This is Alexander, the Hereditary Prince of Isenburg and his wife, Sarah. You might be more familiar with two of Alexander’s sisters: Sophie, who is married to Georg Friedrich of Prussia, and Katharina, who is married to Martin of Austria-Este (brother of Prince Lorenz of Belgium). Sarah has apparently gone light on the jewels, but I can understand why: her coat does all the talking here.\n\nOne more noble guest for our post today, this time from Italy. Alessandra Borghese is a close friend of Gloria of Thurn and Taxis; both princesses are passionate about their Catholic faith. It looks like there may be the hint of a pearl necklace beneath her optical-illusion ensemble, but who can tell?\n\nSo, readers: what are your feelings on the jewels and frocks at this particular princely wedding?\n\nMaria Letizia Bonaparte, Duchess of Aosta (source)\n\n“Diamonds with a History”\n\n(originally appeared in the New York Times, 16 Aug 1891)\n\nThe magnificent diamond tiara and necklace [1] which the Duchess of Aosta [2] wore when she appeared in full dress on her recent visit to England are the famous jewels which the Emperor Napoleon [3] gave to Princess Clotilde [4] in 1859 on her marriage, and they were worth a good fortune.\n\nPrince Napoléon and Maria Clotilde of Savoy, ca. 1859 (source)\n\nWhen Princess Clotilde fled to Italy in September 1870, she took these jewels with her, and placed them in charge of King Victor Emmanuel [5], who peremptorily refused to give them up to Prince Napoleon, who was anxious to convert them into money; but he never succeeded at recapturing them, although he frequently attempted to do so. The Duchess of Aosta left Paris on Saturday for Moncalieri, near Turin, on a visit to her mother, Princess Clotilde.\n\nNOTES, LINKS, AND CREDITS\n\n1. Here’s the only image that I’ve seen of Letizia wearing a tiara — and she appears to be wearing two???\n\n2. Maria Letizia Bonaparte (1866-1926) was the Duchess of Aosta in 1891. Her parents were Napoléon Joseph Bonaparte (commonly known by the title of “Prince Napoléon”), who was the nephew of Napoléon I, and Maria Clotilde of Savoy, who was the daughter of King Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy. Letizia married the Duke of Aosta (who unfortunately was also her maternal uncle) in 1888; he died two years later.\n\n3. Napoléon III of France (1808-1873), who was the first cousin of the Duchess of Aosta’s father, Napoléon Joseph Bonaparte, Prince Napoléon.\n\n4. Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy (1843-1911), the mother of the Duchess of Aosta.\n\n5. King Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy (1820-1878), Clotilde’s father.\n\nThe annual Gala de la Croix-Rouge is one of the biggest social events of the year in Monaco. This year, Prince Albert and Princess Charlene represented the princely family at the gala, and Charlene gave us a bit of glitter to gawk at.\n\nCharlene chose diamonds to accessorize her dark blue Dior gown, including a pair of diamond earrings. I’ve seen speculation that the jewels were made by Van Cleef and Arpels, but I’ve not heard confirmation of that. Update: Thanks to The Royal Couturier on Twitter for giving me a bit of extra info — the earrings are Graff, like the headband, not VC&A!\n\nShe also followed in the footsteps of Queen Letizia of Spain, nestling a diamond headband into her hair. The piece was reportedly made by Graff. Maybe we’ve got a new headband trend on our hands?\n\nAnd here you can see that she also added a diamond bracelet to her right wrist.\n\nThis year’s gala was also one of most prominent appearances that Charlene has made since announcing her pregnancy. She’s due to give birth at the end of the year.\n\nThe Grimaldis weren’t the only royals at the gala this year. Their close friends, Prince Carlos and Princess Camilla of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, were also in attendance. Carlos and Camilla, who use the titles of Duke and Duchess of Castro are members of the royal family that used to rule part of Italy. They’re related to most of the reigning royals who practice Catholicism, and they’re also good friends with the Danish royals.\n\nCamilla even sat beside Prince Albert during dinner. She chose gold jewelry, which coordinated with the golden sleeve embellishment on her white gown. Her rather interesting necklace features a large golden butterfly.\n\nAnd here’s a fuller look at that gown, plus what I think is a butterfly ring on her left hand. God love Camilla — she always brings a little Vegas sparkle to the royal events she attends!"
