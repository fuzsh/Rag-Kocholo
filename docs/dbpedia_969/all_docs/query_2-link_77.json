        "text": "I think it's perfectly understandable to call the dispute a full-fledged controversy; two branches of the family are claiming to be the senior line of the Royal House of the Two Sicilies. That's controversial!\n\nThe origins of the dispute go back to the year 1900, when Prince Charles of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, second son son the Head of the House, Prince Alfonso, Count of Caserta, signed the Act of Cannes, in which he renounced, for himself and his descendants, his position in the Two Sicilies succession. He did this in order to marry the Infanta Maria Mercedes of Spain, sister of King Alfonso XIII and, at that time, the heiress-apparent to the Spanish throne. Upon renouncing his rank and titles in the Two Sicilies succession, he was made a member of the Spanish Royal House with the title of Infante and the qualification of Royal Highness, and a Spanish subject. His own father the Count of Caserta would not allow him to keep his rank as a Sicilian prince under these terms. For the newly created Infante Don Carlos of Spain, it presented few problems as his older brother Ferdinando Pio, Duke of Calabria was expected to inherit the claim and it was assumed he would have children; if not, there were younger brothers in the family to carry on the Two Sicilies succession.\n\nAs fortune would have it, Ferdinando Pio died without issue in 1960. For several years, as it was obvious that the childless Duke of Calabria would have no sons, he regarded his younger brother Prince Rainieri, Duke of Castro, as his successor. However, his nephew Infante Don Alfonso of Spain, son of the late Don Carlos, dismissed his father's renunciation, stating that it had been conditional, and only in effect in the case that his mother, Infanta Maria Mercedes, had succeeded to the throne of Spain (which she obviously did not). Althought he verbage of the Act of Cannes had set forth no such condition, Don Juan, Count of Barcelona and Head of the Royal House of Spain supported Don Alfonso's contentions, as did Spain's dictator, Gen. Francisco Franco, although it is notable that in giving this recognition neither Don Alfonso nor his son the Infante Don Carlos, the current pretender to the title Duke of Calabria, were obliged to give up their status and rank in the Spanish Royal House nor their citizenship as a result. So while they dismissed the Act of Cannes as a dead issue, they continue to enjoy the rights and privileges it bestowed on them. Don Alfonso died in 1964, and his son Don Carlos has styled himself \"Duke of Calabria\" and Head of the House since then. True, he married a daughter of the late Comte de Paris, yet her father did not recognize his claims to the headship of the Royal House.\n\nHowever, most of the knights of the various Bourbon-Two Sicilies chivalric orders, most notably the Constantinian Order of St. George, honored the legality of the Act of Cannes and recognized Prince Rainieri, Duke of Castro, as the legitimate successor to the late Duke of Calabria as Head of the Royal House and Grand Master of the chivalric orders in 1960. He died in 1973, and was succeeded by his son Prince Ferdinando, Duke of Castro; it is his son, Prince Carlo, also styled Duke of Calabria, who is the father of the little Princess Maria Carolina who was recently baptised at the Palace of Caserta. Europe's royals turned out in large numbers for the event, with the notable exception of Spain's royal family.\n\nOriginally posted by Perillos@Dec 3rd, 2003 - 2:34 pm\n\nHowever, most of the knights of the various Bourbon-Two Sicilies chivalric orders, most notably the Constantinian Order of St. George, honored the legality of the Act of Cannes and recognized Prince Rainieri, Duke of Castro, as the legitimate successor to the late Duke of Calabria as Head of the Royal House and Grand Master of the chivalric orders in 1960\n\nAh, yes, the Castro branch of the Two-Sicilies family is known for hawking worthless orders.\n\nNow, on to the more substantive points of your post:\n\nThe origins of the dispute go back to the year 1900, when Prince Charles of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, second son son the Head of the House, Prince Alfonso, Count of Caserta, signed the Act of Cannes, in which he renounced, for himself and his descendants, his position in the Two Sicilies succession. He did this in order to marry the Infanta Maria Mercedes of Spain, sister of King Alfonso XIII and, at that time, the heiress-apparent to the Spanish throne. Upon renouncing his rank and titles in the Two Sicilies succession, he was made a member of the Spanish Royal House with the title of Infante and the qualification of Royal Highness, and a Spanish subject. His own father the Count of Caserta would not allow him to keep his rank as a Sicilian prince under these terms. For the newly created Infante Don Carlos of Spain, it presented few problems as his older brother Ferdinando Pio, Duke of Calabria was expected to inherit the claim and it was assumed he would have children; if not, there were younger brothers in the family to carry on the Two Sicilies succession.\n\nThere were family and political dynamics led to the Act of Cannes and they can not be ignored. The Count of Caserta had been chief of staff to the Duke of Madrid, who was the Carlist pretender to the Spanish throne. Spain's liberal government was hostile to the marriage, as the Carlists were known conservatives and the government was afraid that Carlos aka Charles would politically influence his wife in the event she became Queen regent. Thus it was the deemed prudent that the Princess of Austurias distance herself from her future-father-in-law. The government advised the *minor* King Alfanso to refuse the Two Sicilies Order of San Januarius. The Count of Caserta was furious at the Spanish Royal Court and at the possibililty that his son son could be forced to renounce his Two-Sicilies Claim. Thus he pre-emptively had the Act of Cannes drawn up (allegedly poorly worded). Signed in 1900, it included an undertaking to renounce \"eventual\" rights to the Two Sicilies Crown...\"In execution of the pragmatic decree of 1759\"\n\nHowever:\n\na). The Pragmatic Decree of 1759 did not require a renunciation under these circumstances. It was designed to avert a unification of the Spanish and Two Sicilies Crowns , as Spain wasn't allowed domains in Italy after the Succession Wars. So only when and if the Princess of Austarias became Queen would any renunciation have been necessary -- if the Two-Sicilies monarchy had been intact. Remember, the Bourbon-Two-Sicilies family ceased to have any Italian domains after the 1860s. Thus there was no possibility of the Crowns being united.\n\nB). Only the circumstances envisaged in the Pragmatic Decree allowed for renunciation. If the circumstances didn't exist then the renuncation wasn't valid. According to the house law all 'legitimate' issue of recgonized marriages were eligable for succession.\n\nc). Two-Sicilies civil law prohibited renuncations of *future* inheritances. So did French Law (and the the Act was signed in France). Italian law (where the signatories were citizens) also did not recognize renuncations of future inheritances.\n\nEurope's royals turned out in large numbers for the event, with the notable exception of Spain's royal family\n\nEr, no. Who turned up? The Grimaldis and Claire and Laurent (who used to jet set with Carlo and Camilla in Monte Carlo). Sweden, Denmark, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Norway, Britain, Austria, Bavaria, etc. etc. etc. were not represented. The Castro branch are *not* taken seriously by the reigning (and most formerly reigning) houses of Europe. They would not want to offend the King of Spain. The best they could do for their elder daughter was a Bonaparte. And look who the son married -- the daughter of a *convicted* criminal who fled to South America and a b rated movie actress and sometime dancer. The manners of the 'Duchess' have also been commented on by the 'knights' of the orders her husband represents.\n\nMy goodness, Sean - you're quite partisan about this, aren't you?\n\nThe \"worthless orders\" offered by the \"Castro branch\" might be of no value in the eyes of the Infante Don Carlos of Spain and his supporters, but it is rather telling that, in 1960, most of the members of these Orders (which I suppose would not be written off as \"worthless\" at that time) recognized the Duke of Castro's father Prince Rainieri as the successor to the deceased Ferdinando Pio, Duke of Calabria, and not Don Carlos' father, the Infante Don Alfonso of Spain.\n\nRegarding the substantive bits - I'm familiar with the technical points refuting the legality of the Act of Cannes made by adherents of the Infante Don Alfonso of Spain and his son Don Carlos; however these are technicalities which in no way erode the original intent of the Act; they carry about as much weight as saying that Prince Carlo had his fingers crossed behind his back when he signed it. Whatever necessities, proscriptions, or circumstances existed prior to its signing, or legal loopholes emerged after the fact, these do not alter the original intended purpose - by signing, Prince Carlo signed away his \"eventual\" rights to the Two Sicilies succession in order to become an Infante of Spain and a Spanish subject. Had he remained \"Prince Carlo of the Two Sicilies\" and had his wife become \"Princess Carlo of the Two Sicilies\", then all would have been covered easily by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1759 in the event that Mercedes succeeded to the Spanish throne - and as she did not, their son Don Alfonso would have smoothly succeeded his uncle Ferdinando Pio as Head of the House of Two Sicilies without further ado in 1960. However, back in 1900, the parties concerned took it a step beyond what was covered in the Pragmatic Sanction of 1759 - instead of Mercedes joining her new husband's house, he joined hers - he became an Infante of Spain and a subject of King Alfonso XIII upon his marriage, and not \"in the eventuality\" of his wife's succession. Prince Carlo understood the implications and never tried to rescind his actions. Conversely, when the full weight of implication became apparent to his son and grandson in 1960, never did they once consider that in order to become Head of the Royal House of the Two Sicilies it would be adviseable, prudent, and wholly necessary to renounce their Spanish titles and ranks. That's why the Knights of the Two Sicilies chivalric orders refused to recognize them - their \"king\" could not be the subject of another \"king\", even of the non-reigning variety. All the legal technicalities and loopholes proffered by the Infantes of Spain and their adherents were designed as an exercise in \"having their cake and eating it too\". It had to be one or the other - not even the Pragmatic Sanction of 1759 would allow for both.\n\nNow, as far as the guest list for the baptism of Maria Carolina goes, \"the best they could do...was a Bonaparte\" is just a bit misleading, wouldn't you say? Having Prince Laurent of Belgium as a godfather is nothing to sneeze at, and in my humble opinion, a LOT better than a Bonaparte. But just for added flavor, the Duke and Duchess of Bragança attended, as did Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, with some of his Karageorgevich cousins in tow as I recall, and several Orléans family members - you might want to consult the past issue of \"Point de Vue\" that carried the full-color spread of the event. It seems that today's royals are not so fiercely partisan over these issues as their \"fans\" like us are that they can't come together for a joyous occasion and a splendid event.\n\nSean:\n\nHere a list of the guests at Princess Maria Carolina's christening - I forgot all about Prince Kardam of Bulgaria, The Duke of Aosta, the Princes Alexander of Liechtenstein, and the Countess Secco d'Aragona (née Archduchess Katherina of Austria)...\n\nThe event was attended by the following members of the Royal House of Bourbon Two Sicilies: H.R.H. the Duchess of Castro; Donna Edoarda Crociani and her daughter Cristiana; H.R.H.

The Calabria's (both of them) don't really interest me. I'm just repeating historical facts. Actually, you're the one who comes across as a Castro sycophant!\n\nRegarding the substantive bits - I'm familiar with the technical points refuting the legality of the Act of Cannes made by adherents of the Infante Don Alfonso of Spain and his son Don Carlos; however these are technicalities which in no way erode the original intent of the Act; they carry about as much weight as saying that Prince Carlo had his fingers crossed behind his back when he signed it. Whatever necessities, proscriptions, or circumstances existed prior to its signing, or legal loopholes emerged after the fact, these do not alter the original intended purpose - by signing, Prince Carlo signed away his \"eventual\" rights to the Two Sicilies succession in order to become an Infante of Spain and a Spanish subject.\n\nIt doesn't matter what the intent was. If it was signed under duress and *not* legally valid do to the the laws of the the time and place, then the decree is invalid. It's that simple. Intent (or whisful thinking, for that matter) does not make an illlegal document legal. The loopholes did not emerge \"after the fact\". These were the laws of the time and thus in effect at the time of signing.\n\nPrince Carlo of the Two Sicilies\" and had his wife become \"Princess Carlo of the Two Sicilies\", then all would have been covered easily by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1759 in the event that Mercedes succeeded to the Spanish throne - and as she did not, their son Don Alfonso would have smoothly succeeded his uncle Ferdinando Pio as Head of the House of Two Sicilies without further ado in 1960. However, back in 1900, the parties concerned took it a step beyond what was covered in the Pragmatic Sanction of 1759 - instead of Mercedes joining her new husband's house, he joined hers - he became an Infante of Spain and a subject of King Alfonso XIII upon his marriage, and not \"in the eventuality\" of his wife's succession.\n\nCarlo becoming an Infante of Spain doesn't mean anything. In 1868 Prince Gaetano of the Two Sicilies married the (then) Spanish heiress presumptive Infanta Isabela. He too was created Infant of Spain. A decree was drawn up stating that he he would lose his Two Sicilies rights in the event the Infanta became Queen Spain. However, it was never signed because she never did become Queen. So, if you look at precedent (which was in keeping with the Pragmatic Law of 1759), the signed decree was not necessary in addition to be ing illegal. Also, by marrying into another royal house one does not necessarily lose their memebership in their own house, particularly if that house is no longer reigning.\n\nI get PdV weekly, thank you. You specifically wrote that *only* the Spanish royal house was absent. This is a falsehood and I exposed it as such. And by Bonaparte for their daughter I was referring to Princess Beatrice of the Two Sicilies. As far as Laurent being nothing to sneeze at, well, he's a friend of the father's (the two used to jet set together) and 10th in line to the Belgian throne. He's never been the most popular member of the Belgian RF (but that's another story) and his substantive accomplishments are few when compared to those of his siblings. Perhaps married life will change him. In any event, a princely title does not necessarily make one 'nothing to sneeze at'.\n\nNow, as far as the guest list for the baptism of Maria Carolina goes, \"the best they could do...was a Bonaparte\" is just a bit misleading, wouldn't you say? Having Prince Laurent of Belgium as a godfather is nothing to sneeze at, and in my humble opinion, a LOT better than a Bonaparte. But just for added flavor, the Duke and Duchess of Bragança attended, as did Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, with some of his Karageorgevich cousins in tow as I recall, and several Orléans family members - you might want to consult the past issue of \"Point de Vue\" that carried the full-color spread of the event. It seems that today's royals are not so fiercely partisan over these issues as their \"fans\" like us are that they can't come together for a joyous occasion and a splendid event.\n\nAs for the other other families you mention, many would not consider them as royalty because they do *not* belong to reigning houses. Again, you specifically said that *only* the Spanish royal house was absent. Not true. Some of the the Karageorgevichs are, in my opinion, rather taky and dubious people, as are some of the Orleans and Emanuelle Filberto, IMO (making money of his 'title' bydoing commercials, shacking-up with every other girlfriend, not practicing saf sex, getting a girl who has posed topless pregnant and then having to marry her , etc., etc.). In short, with the Bragances being the exeption, tThese aren't really the creme de la creme of European royalty and society. But to each their own. It just proves my point that most of the reigning houses will have nothing to do with the Castro's. The King of Spain is the senior Bourbon and, in his view, the Infant Don Carlos is the head of the Two Sicilies house. This seems to be good enough for the reigning houses of Europe. And I'm not partisan on the issue. I just know a lot about most of the reigning and non-reigning houses (both European and non) and can discern between a legal and an illegal document. Many would consider those attending as not being royal\n\nI will write about the chivalric orders when I have more time this afternoon or tonight.\n\nRegards,\n\nS.\n\nOriginally posted by Perillos@Dec 4th, 2003 - 8:12 pm\n\nSean:\n\nHere a list of the guests at Princess Maria Carolina's christening - I forgot all about Prince Kardam of Bulgaria, The Duke of Aosta, the Princes Alexander of Liechtenstein, and the Countess Secco d'Aragona (née Archduchess Katherina of Austria)...\n\nThe event was attended by the following members of the Royal House of Bourbon Two Sicilies: H.R.H. the Duchess of Castro; Donna Edoarda Crociani and her daughter Cristiana; H.R.H. Princess Beatrice and her children; T.I.H. Prince Jean Christophe and Princess Caroline Napoleon; H.R.H. Princess Anna and her children, Nicolas and Dorothèe Cochin; T.R.H. Prince Louis Alphonse and Princess Cristina; H.R.H. Prince Alexander.\n\nThe Corciani's are not members of the Two Sicilies House, thank you. Also, half the individuals you list are not royals, which you claim they are. Former Italian counts, marquises, barons (they're all a dime a dozen in Italy), do not qualify as royalty.\n\nAs far as the Bonaparte's and the the likes of Feycal of Tunisia...well, the latter are not really regarded as royalty and they where in attendence because they are closely related to the family. The latter and his sister jet set with Carlo and Camilla. They are not members of reigning houses. You specifically said only the house of Spain was the noteable exception. With respect to Archduchess Catharina, she is married to an Italian Count (although the title is one of pretension) and she was not there as an official representative of the Austrian House. In any event, wit the exception of the Lichtenstien's and Laurent and Claire (whom I already acknowledged) they are not members of reigning houses.\n\nNo doubt the event was well attended, but you specifically said only the house of Spain was the noteable exception. This was incorrect and that was my contention. No matter how many other names you list will change that. That was my point. Moreover, one can attend an event one is invited to without supporting the claims of the host (e.g Kubrat and et al also attend events on the Infant Don Carlos' side). As you say, they were participating in a joyous ocassion.\n\nSean:\n\nTo address your contention first, I used the term \"noteable exception\" in regards to the absence of Spanish royals at Maria Carolina's baptism, not \"sole exception\". \"Noteable\" means \"worthy of notice\", not \"solitary\". I really didn't feel that it was necessary to list every single royal house, reigning and non-reigning, that was not represented at the event in my original post, but simply to note that it was \"noteable\" that the Spaniards did not attend. Considering the fact that this was not a state event, but a private celebration, and given the past enmity between the two families, I'd venture a guess that they weren't invited. As far as reigning monarchies sending representatives in an official capacity, we can review the differences between \"private celebrations\" and \"state events\" in more depth if you feel it necessary to do so. Even if every reigning monarch, consort , and heir-apparent in Europe had attended, they all would have been there in an unofficial capacity as it was private function.\n\nAs for the rest, I've never seen quite so many hairs being split simultaneously in my life! Yes, I realize that the majority of names listed were non-royal aristocrats and \"nobiltà vecchia\" (and no, I didn't claim they were royal - thanks again for putting words in my mouth). However, I note with satisfaction that you did catch the names of those whose royal status is generally unquestioned (even if they don't satisfy your rather exacting moral standards, or come from non-reigning houses, or simply aren't appealing to you) who you conveniently left off when you capped the royalty on the guest list at the \"jet-setting\" Grimaldis, Prince and Princess Laurent, and \"a Bonaparte\". I hate to burst your bubble, but several scions of reigning royal houses have their share of moral and behavioral shortcomings as well. Their messes just get cleaned up more quietly.\n\n(And just in case you feel compelled to subtlely remand me for referring to the Grimaldis as \"royalty\", I already know the technicalities, thank you - it's just that there's no such word as \"princelty\").\n\nI salute your vast and varied knowledge, even if I don't necessarily agree with your interpretations or share your conclusions. We could go around and around on this issue and it would get us nowhere, as the two factions of the House of the Two Sicilies themselves have been unable to put it to rest and end it amicably for 43 years. I have no vested interest in either branch of the Two Sicilies house beyond a somewhat academic interest in the dispute and an independently formed opinion - just as you do.\n\nBy the way, the senior Bourbon is Luis Alfonso, not Juan Carlos. Speaking in terms of strict primogeniture, that is, although you may qualify things in terms of reigning and non-reigning, or apply particular moral filters in your assessments."
