        "text": "Death of Charles II, king of Spain\n\nHis reign lasted from 1665 to 1700. His parents were Philip IV (King of Spain) and Maria (daughter of emperor Ferdinand III). He first got married with Maria Louisa of Orleans and when she died, in 1689, he got married with Maria Ana of Neuberg. Known as \"the Bewitched\" he is noted for his extensive physical, intellectual, and emotional disabilities—along with his consequent ineffectual rule. He died in 1700, childless and heirless, with all potential Habsburg successors having predeceased him.\n\nPhilip V First Reign\n\nPhilip was born at the Palace of Versailles, on 19 December, 1683. His parents were Louis, Dauphin of France and Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria. He first got married with Maria Luisa of Savoy. When she died, in 1714, he got married with Elisabeth of Parma. In his later reign Philip helped his Bourbon relatives to make territorial gains in the War of the Polish Succession and the War of the Austrian Succession by reconquering Naples and Sicily from Austria and Oran from the Ottomans.\n\nPhilip V First Reign\n\nDecrees of the Kingdom of Valencia\n\nThe Decree of Nueva Planta of the Kingdom of Valencia was a decree issued by Philip V of Spain on June 29, 1707 during the War of Spanish Succession, in which were abolished the charters and the institutions of the Kingdom of Valencia.\n\nDecrees of the Kingdom of Aragon\n\nPhilip V declared the \"abolished and repealed of all the charters, privileges, practice and custom hitherto observed in the kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia, being my will that they be reduced to the laws of Castile and to its form of government\", This was justified based on three arguments: breaking the oath of allegiance to the king, the absolute rule of the king in all his kingdoms and states and the right of conquest that allowed him to impose his law on the territories conquered.\n\nIsabella Farnese of Parma First Reign\n\nShe was the consort queen of Spain.\n\nDecrees of the Principality of Catalonia\n\nThey abolished the Parliament and the Council of One Hundred.\n\nThe viceroy was replaced by a commander in chief and Catalonia was divided into twelve \"Corregidurías\", therefore the batlled remained.\n\nThe somatenes (armed militias in Catalonia and Aragon) are prohibited.\n\nTaxing the urban and rural properties and benefits of labor, trade and industry was established.\n\nThe official language of the Court ceased to be Latin and was replaced by the Castilian.\n\nLouis I Reign\n\nLouis I succeeded the throne after the abdication of his father, Philip V, who also regained the throne after the death of Louis I from smallpox. He ruled 7 months and 17 days.\n\nLouis I Reign\n\nPhilip V Second Reign\n\nHis second reign was due to the death of Louis I, his son, who his rule lasted less than a year.\n\nPhilip V Second Reign\n\nHe became ill and he named his son as king but only lasted eight months.\n\nThe First Family Compact\n\nFrance backed Spain's right to recover possessions in Italy. Italy became an obsessive factor in its foreign policy ; this obsession coincided with the ambitions of Philip V's second wife, Isabella Farnese of Parma. In 1734, Spanish troops recovered Naples and Sicily and Isabella's older son, Charles, was crowned King of Naples.\n\nThe Second Family Compact\n\nIn support of France's involvement with the Austrian War of Succession, resulted in the installation of Charles's younger brother Philip as duke of Parma and Piacenza in 1748.\n\nFrancisco José de Goya y Lucientes\n\nHe was a Spanish romantic painter and printmaker, regarded both as the last of the Old Masters and the first of the moderns. Goya was court painter to the Spanish Crown; throughout the Peninsular War he remained in Madrid, where he painted the portrait of Joseph Bonaparte, pretender to the Spanish throne, and documented the war in the masterpiece of studied ambiguity known as the Desastres de la Guerra. He was a model for painters such as Manet, Picasso and Francis Bacon.\n\nFerdinand VI Reign\n\nHe was born on 23 September, 1713 in Real Alcázar de Madrid. His parents were Philip V of Spain and Maria Luisa of Savoy. He got married with Barbara of Portugal. He started his reign by eliminating the influence of the widow Queen Elisabeth of Parma and her group of Italian courtiers. The most important tasks during the reign of Ferdinand VI were carried out by the Marquis of Ensenada, the Secretary of the Treasury, Navy and Indies. He suggested that the state help modernize the country.\n\nCharles III Reign\n\nHe was born on 20 January, 1716 in the Royal Alcazar of Madrid. His parents were Philip V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese. He got married with Maria Amalia of Saxony. The third Treaty of Vienna, stated he would not be able to join the Neapolitan and Sicilian territories to the Spanish throne. He was later given the title of Lord of the Two Sicilies.\n\nCharles III Reign\n\nCharacteristics of the Neoclassical Architecure\n\nIt employed the same classical vocabulary as Late Baroque architecture. However, it tended to emphasize its planar qualities, rather than sculptural volumes. Projections and recessions and their effects of light and shade were more flat; sculptural bas-reliefs were flatter and tended to be enframed in friezes, tablets or panels. Its clearly articulated individual features were isolated, autonomous and complete in themselves.\n\nThe photograph shows the White hall of the Gatchina palace.\n\nThe Third Family Compact\n\nEngland and France sought Spanish support in the Seven Years War. The pact, which dealt with political and commercial relations and with the entry of Spain into the war, also included the Bourbon ruler of the Two Sicilies and the Infant Philip, duke of Parma. Spain entered the war (1762) but was of small use to France; the economic and political provisions of the pact proved to be more enduring than the military ones.\n\nGaspar Melchor de Jovellanos wrote the Honest Offender\n\nHe was an ilustrated Spanish writer, lawyer and politician. Jovellanos's prose works, especially those on political and legislative economy, constitute his real claim to literary fame. In them, depth of thought and clear-sighted sagacity are couched in a certain Ciceronian elegance and classical purity of style. Besides the Ley Agraria, he wrote Elogios, and an interesting set of diaries or travel journals (1790–1801, first published in 1915) reflecting his trips across Northern Spain.\n\nFloridablanca Count was Secretary of the State\n\nJosé Moñino y Redondo was a Spanish statesman. He was the reformist chief minister of King Charles III of Spain, and also served briefly under Charles IV. He was arguably Spain's most effective statesman in the eighteenth century. In Spain, he is simply known as Conde de Floridablanca.\n\nCharles IV Reign\n\nTomás Zumalacárregui\n\nHe was a Basque Carlist general. The proclamation of the king's daughter Isabel as heiress was almost the occasion of an armed conflict between him and the naval authorities at Ferrol. He gradually obtained full possession of Navarre and organized the forces known as aduaneros and the Guías de Navarra. He won the battles of Alsasua, Alegría de Álava, and Venta de Echavarri. He died on 24 June, 1835.\n\nEl Baile de San Antonio de la Florida\n\nEl Baile de San Antonio de la Florida or dancing on the banks of the Manzanares is a cardboard painted by Francisco Goya for the dining room of the Prince of Asturias in the Brown Skin. In this work you can still see the imprint of Mengs and Bayeu, still supervising Goya cartons. The Aragonese describes the picture as «dos majos y dos majas que bailan seguidillas». In a second term musicians, a military and a pestle is observed. In the background, appears the church of San Francisco el Grande.\n\nGoya was Deaf\n\nGoya's position was secured with Charles III, but at the age of 46 years he suddenly collapsed. He suffered a grave and mysterious illness and was blind, paralysed and closed to madness. He was stone deaf after he recovered. In spite of all his ill health, Goya gained two more sponsors, Duke and Duchess of Alba. It was said that Goya and the Duchess of Alba were lovers and that she inspired two of his most famous paintings: The Naked Maja and The Clothed Maja.\n\nWar of Pyrenees\n\nThe Great War, also known as the War of Pyrenees, faced The the Kingdom of Spain against the revolutionary France, between 1793 and 1795. Spain lost Roussillon and Cerdanya.Peace between Spain and France was signed on November 7, 1659.\n\nThe Execution of Louis XVI\n\nThe execution of Louis XVI, by means of the guillotine, took place at the Place de la Révolution. It was a major event of the French Revolution. After events on the 10 August 1792, which saw the fall of the monarchy after the attack on the Tuileries by insurgents, Louis was arrested, interned in the Temple prison with his family, tried for high treason before the National Convention, found guilty by almost all, and condemned to death by a slight majority.\n\nCapricho \"Tal para cual\"\n\nGoya produced his first etchings, los Caprichos in which he showed the folly of humans. They are full with monsters, witches and goblins. The central image is called 'The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters' and shows the nightmare which Goya fears when reason 'sleeps'. One of his Caprichos is called \"Tal para cual\" and he painted it in 1799.\n\nCharles IV's Family Painting by Goya\n\nCharles IV of Spain and his family is an oil on canvas painting by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya who began to work on this painting in 1800 and completed it in the summer of 1801.The royal family is apparently paying a visit to the artist's studio, while Goya can be seen to the left looking outwards towards the view.\n\nThe Spanish Defeat at Trafalgar\n\nThe Battle of Trafalgar was a naval engagement fought by the Royal Navy against the combined fleets of the French and Spanish Navies, during the War of the Third Coalition of the Napoleonic Wars. Twenty-seven British ships of the line led by Admiral Lord Nelson defeated thirty-three French and Spanish ships of the line under French Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve. The prevailing tactical orthodoxy at the time involved manoeuvring to approach the enemy fleet in a single line of battle.\n\nNapoleonic Troops in Spain\n\nTretay of Fountainebleau\n\nThe Treaty of Fontainebleau was a political agreement that was signed between Napoleon Bonaparte of France and Charles IV of Spain on October 27, 1807, in Fontainebleau, France. It was agreed that Portugal and all Portuguese dominions were to be divided between the signatories; by this accord Napoleon wanted to secure and ensure the Continental Blockade he had imposed on Britain in 1806 by capturing the Portuguese ports.\n\nThe photograph shows the partition of Portugal, proposed by Napoleon.\n\nAbdication of Bayonne\n\nThe Abdications of Bayonne is the name given to a series of forced abdications of the Kings of Spain that led to the Peninsular War. The failed El Escorial Conspiracy preceded the Mutiny of Aranjuez, which forced King Charles IV to abdicate the throne to his son Ferdinand VII in 1808 by order of the Spanish Royal Council.\n\nFerdinand VII First Reign\n\nWhen his father's abdication was extorted by a popular riot at Aranjuez in March 1808, he ascended the throne but turned again to Napoleon, in the hope that the emperor would support him.\n\nEvents of 2 May 1808\n\nOutbreak of the Peninsular War: The people of Madrid rise up in rebellion against French occupation. Francisco de Goya later memorializes this event in his painting \"The Second of May\" in 1808.\n\nJoseph I Reign\n\nHe was born on 7 January, 1768. His parents were Carlo Buonaparte and Letizia Ramolino. He was the elder brother of Napoleon Bonaparte, who made him King of Naples and Sicily and later King of Spain. His arrival sparked the Spanish revolt against French rule, and the beginning of the Peninsular War. During his reign, he ended the Spanish Inquisition.
