The only child of Prince Roland Bonaparte and Marie-Félix Blanc born in 1882, her paternal grandfather was Prince Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte, a nephew of Emperor Napoleon I, while her maternal grandfather was François Blanc, the principal real-estate developer of Monte Carlo from whom she inherited her great fortune. In 1907, she married Prince George of Greece and Denmark, the second son of King George I and Queen Olga of Greece, making her an aunt of King George II, King Alexander, and King Paul of Greece, Queen Helen of Romania, the Duchess of Aosta (a short-lived Queen of Croatia), the Duke of Edinburgh, Princess Margarita of Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, Princess Cecile, Grand Duchess of Hesse), Princess Theodora, Margravine of Baden, Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, Princess Paul of Yugoslavia, Princess Sophie of Greece and Hanover, and Prince Michael of Greece among others. The couple had two children, Prince Peter and Princess Eugenie, and lived together on her French Estates, though when he was in Athens or Copenhagen, the Princess preferred to be in Paris of Vienna. An author of sexual research, Princess Marie was closely linked with Sigmund Freud, contributing to the popularity of psychoanalysis, and enabling Freud’s escape from Vienna. During the Coronation of her niece-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, the Princess famously psychoanalyzed the future French President François Mitterrand. Princess Marie died of leukemia in Saint-Tropez in 1962, and was cremated in Marseille, before her ashes were interred at the Greek Royal Cemetery in Tatoï Palace.\n\nCartier Olive Wreath Tiara | Diamond Star Tiara | Pearl Brooch\n\nCartier Olive Wreath Tiara\n\nDiamond Star Tiara\n\nPearl Brooch\n\nShare this:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
