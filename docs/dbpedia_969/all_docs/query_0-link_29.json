        "text": "Napoleon V was the first Emperor of France since the creation of the Imperial State of France since it's creation as a German Puppet State. Before that he was pretender of the Bonapartist French throne after the death of his paternal distant cousin Napoleon, Prince Imperial son of Napoleon III who had no heirs since he foolishly decided to die in the Anglo-Zulu without being married or having any children. Napoleon V ruled the Imperial State of France since it's creation as a Puppet State until his death in 1926 at age 63.\n\nHistory[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nHe was born in the Palais Royal of Paris during the Second French Empire the son of Prince Napoleon and his wife, Princess Marie Clothilde of Savoy, daughter of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. Two younger siblings would soon follow: Prince Louis (1864–1932) and Princess Maria Letizia Bonaparte (1866–1926), later the Duchess of Aosta. At the time of his birth, he was third in the line of succession to the throne behind Napoléon, Prince Imperial and his father. The Empire came to an end in 1870 with the abdication of the Emperor Napoleon III.\n\nBecoming Heir of the Bonaparte Dynasty[]\n\nHe was appointed head of the house of Bonaparte at the age of 18 in the will of Napoléon Eugène, Prince Imperial, who died in 1879, and so became Napoleon V to his supporters, though his younger brother, Prince Louis, a colonel in the Russian Imperial Guard, was preferred to him by many Bonapartists. The decision by the Prince Imperial to bypass Prince Victor's father led to a complete breakdown in relations between father and son. In May 1886 the French Republic expelled the princes of the former ruling dynasties and so Prince Victor left France for exile in Belgium.\n\nDreyfus Affair[]\n\nAt the time of the death of President Félix Faure in 1899, during the Dreyfus affair, a number of political factions attempted to take advantage of the disorder and Prince Victor announced to a delegation from the Imperialist committee that he would take action to restore the French Empire when he felt that the time was favourable. In order to achieve this, he announced he would place himself at the head of the movement with his brother, Prince Louis, fighting beside him who he said would be \"bringing to the Bonapartist forces his prestige and his military talents as well as his rank in the Russian army\". The Duke of Orléans, rival claimant to the throne, also had forces available and they were ready to cross the French frontier at same time as the Bonapartist forces. In the end the anticipated outbreak in France did not materialise and the French Third Republic survived one of its gravest crises.\n\nWorld War I[]\n\nThe Germans had conqured France with Spain and Italy, Spain made the Duke of Orléans's son the King of France in their region, however the Germans decided to send Victor, Prince Napoleon to France to become the French Emperor. After the Germans crowned him Napoleon V, Emperor the French booed Victor and his coalition calling them German puppets and \"The man who made us fail to get his throne back.\" The Imperialists had gotten huge disrespect from the French Republicans who threw slander at them and called Napoleon V a dumb boon who has no Ideas of a Radical Government and a German Puppet.\n\nAfter World War I[]\n\nThe merciless execution of Alfred Dreyfus, because he was a \"loyalist Jew Republican\" caused a division in France again, but Napoleon V sided with the \"anti-Dreyfusards\" Army which called them German Puppets and Proxies by the Republicans. The \"anti-Dreyfusards\" Army began killing band gunning down Dreyfus's Family and people who thought his execution was unfair or people who tried to protest his innocence. The Republicans who were Pro-Dreyfus were so hurt that they with the Republicans called Napoleon V a murderer and a German puppet as they left for the third republic. French Jews also left as they made slurs against Napoleon V as the \"Jew killer\" and \"Nazi Puppet\".\n\nNapoleon V died in 1926 at age 63, he was succeeded by his son Napoleon VI.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nOn 10 November/14 November 1910, at Moncalieri, Prince Victor was married to Princess Clémentine of Belgium (1872–1955), daughter of Leopold II of Belgium and Marie Henriette of Austria. They had two children:"
