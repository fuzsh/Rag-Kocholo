brief, the infant’s cries ivere piercing, and long In fact, his power of voice was out of all proportion to his size, for although he was full-term, he was frail and almost puny But little dogs often bark the loudest Indeed he went on yelhng almost without a halt until his aunt had finished his washing and put on his new long frock Thus by what IS knoivn as precipitate delivery but with rough bucolic imdwifery Napoleon Bonaparte was born about nud-day on 15 August 1769 ^ Many anecdotes appear in the hterature concerning his birth, some of them entertaining, most of them apocryphal It is very difficult for a famous man to be born in the textbook manner by which ordinary men are dehvered He must arrive either in a log cabin or in a caul, be untimely ripped from his mother’s womb, or be found in a basket m the bulrushes Amongst the fruits of fame in later life are the tales of miraculous deeds m infancy Some of those tales are bred of adulation, but human nature being what it IS, some alas arise from self-conceit Dr Hereau, who was after- wards surgeon to Napoleon’s mother, no doubt heard his version of the birth from her own hps, and she should have surely known, as she was there ® Napoleon’s personal version he gave to Dr Antommarchi at St Helena but he may not be quite so rehable, even though he too was there He said that he did not fall upon the cold hard paving stones of the parlour floor but upon a cherished heirloom carpet which lay ready This carpet of woven wool was said to have been brightly decorated with figures of the heroes of Homer’s Iltad and of Alexander the Great and Caesar It is never too soon to start meeting the right sort of people However, the rug has now gone, even the house in Ajaccio which is today exhibited to visitors as his birthplace is not the origmal one but is a building of later construction although on the same site There have also previously arisen certain confusions concerning the exact date of his birth This confusion largely arose from evidence m the marriage certificate of Napoleon and Josephine de Beau- harnais, which indicates that the War Office had supplied a state- ment at the tune to the effect that he was born at Corte on 5 Feb- ruary 1768 of the legitimate marriage of Charles Bonaparte and ^ See also Arthur Chuquet, La jfeunessc de MapoUon, Pans 1897, Vol 1, p 62 *J JtapoUon a Samte

The eager bndegroom in his haste to get mamed had not worried about such details in the history of being bom The error was subsequently discovered and the War Office ex- plained, no doubt with proper apologies, that they thought it was Napoleon’s elder brother Joseph who was being married But again they were wrong, for Joseph’s birthday was 7 January not 5 Feb- ruary So they said it was a typist’s error, or rather a writer’s shp But perhaps it was not the fault of the War Office at all It is possible, even probable, that Napoleon himself dehberately falsified his age for the purposes of his wedding ceremony, stating that he was twenty-eight when in fact he was only twenty-six Josephme cer- tamly exercised her woman’s pnvilege, for she gave her age as twenty-mne whereas she was actually thirty-three They both per- haps had ivished to minimize the difference m their ages, and in order to close the gap m years they thus conspired to meet each other about half-way This attitude of ready compromise was no doubt most praiseworthy and propitious at the threshold of their matnmomal life but it probably produced the snare in the mamage certificate mto which several unsuspecting historians have fallen The certificate of baptism of Napoleon at Ajaccio, which is dated 21 July 1771, states that he was bom on 15 August 1769, and he himself, both m his Epoques de ma Vie and m his Memoirs of the history of France, confirms this date This date is also given in the birth certificate forwarded by his parents to the Ecole Royale Mihtaire of Bnenne when he was there His father in a note written at the time of his daughter Pauhne’s birth on 20 October 1780 sets out all the facts, plainly stating that his eldest son Joseph was bom at Corte in Corsica on 7 January 1768, and that his second son Nap- oleon was bom at Ajaccio on 15 August 1769 This date of his birth can thus be traced and confirmed with certainty 2 Corsican Conflicts Corsica at the time of Napoleon’s birth was a wild disordered primitive country All through the ages the island had been the shuttlecock m games of war and peace between all the nations bordering the inland sea and it happened now to be in the hands of the Republic of Genoa The Corsicans, led by their great patriot Pasquale Paoh, had been strugglmg for years in guerilla warfare agamst the Genoese m search of independence, and in 1764 had enhsted the support and military aid of Louis XV of France It was the same old story as had been enacted in so many of the Mediter- ranean islands — and indeed as is still being enacted It was not long, however, before the Corsicans found themselves fighting not the Genoese, but those very French forces who had been sent to their aid Then in a treaty signed on 15 May 1768 the Genoese quietly sold Corsica to France for a round two million pounds But Paoh and his patriots were far from accepting this arrangement so tidily concluded over their heads, and continued their fight with re- doubled fury against the French invaders Now Napoleon’s father, Charles-Marie Bonaparte, had married his mother, Maria Letizia Ramohni, on 2 June 1764 when he was only eighteen years of age and she was not yet fourteen All the pulsing blood and all the leaping imagination of young Charles- Mane had drawn him into this fight at the side of Paoh and he fought first here and then there all over the island, through all the early years of his marriage A war in Corsica in the eighteenth century is not quite the same thing as a war in Europe in the twentieth century , Charles-Marie did not marry his bride and then leave her to languish while he went to the front, he married her and took her with him, for all her tender years Nor did they wait in taut and tense frustration until the war was over before they had their children, they had them as they went This guerilla fighting against the French forces was earned on 4 CORSICA B 6 Napoleon Immortal m the rough forests and the mountainous countryside Much of the terrain was httle more than desert, austere and sparsely popu- lated, quite devoid of roads, even of tracks or paths Malaria and other endemic diseases were rife The towns and even the coastal capital of Ajaccio were small and many like Charles-Marie had left their homes for the open maquis The villages were scattered, the houses mostly prumtive, the women received no schoohng, and as they helped with much of the manual labour they were physically tough True, in the coastal belt the countryside was green and lush, cactus and jumper, myrtle and lavender grew in glorious profusion Olive groves and almond trees, vineyards and orangeries ran down to the warm blue of the Mediterranean sea But the French occupied progressively more and more of these coastal areas and Paoh’s resistance forces, ill-equipped and poorly armed, were gradually driven into the inland wilderness And Charles-Marie and Letizia went with them Their first two children, a son born in 1 765 and a daughter born in 1 767, died in infancy, neither of them a year old When their next child, Joseph, was born on 7 January 1768 they were at Corte in the centre of the island, and as they moved along he had to be carried in his mother’s arms He was less than a year old when Letizia found herself pregnant yet again, pregnant with Napoleon But Paoh’s fight was failing, he was decisively beaten at Ponte Novo and on 13 June 1769 embarked at Porto Vecchio with a hand- ful of his die-hards and sailed to England into voluntary exile Corsica then became finally recogmzed as an mtegral part of France Charles-Marie at first was determined to embark with Paoh, but he took one long silent look at his wife’s eyes, then one quick glance at her growing figure and he realized it was impossible Through the intermediation of Pietra-Santa, Letizia’s grandfather, who had friends on the other side, they obtained a safe-conduct from the French general m command. Marshal de Vaux, and together with their baby Joseph returned to their home at Ajaccio There only a few weeks afterwards Letizia gave birth to her son Napoleon Conceived in the throes of war, earned in embryo through months of nomad strife, this child, though born at last at home in peace, could justly claim a baptism of fire long before he saw first light He was lucky to have been born at home, yet it is intriguing to think that had his father persisted in his plan to go into exile Corsican Conflicts y with Paoh, taking his gestant wife ivith him, Napoleon would then have been born in England Would he have there grown up to lead a British army'^ The consequences of such an eventuahty upon the subsequent history of Europe are fascinating food for thought Such a turn of events was not so speculative as it might at first seem, for there is subsequent confirmation of how very near his parents were at this tune to saihng for England And there is also evidence enough of young Napoleon’s later ready facihty in chang- mg his loyalties, if opportumty dictated such a change It is for instance on record that he himself, when a student at Bnenne after his father’s death, remarked bitterly that he could never forgive him for desertmg Paoh and the cause of Corsican independence But fate and the obstetric tables decided otherwise The journey back from Niolo on Monte Rotondo to Ajaccio was a severe ordeal for poor Letizia m her advanced condition They had to go by pathways through wild wooded country, fording the rivers as they came to them In order to cross the swollen river Liamone, Charles- Mane mounted her upon a horse which he had borrowed The horse stumbled m midstream and was swept along by the swift current Her husband carrymg Joseph shouted to her to let go the reins and to strike out into the nver, while he and one of the gmdes at the same tune leapt into the water to her rescue But Letizia clung with her knees into the horse, got it under control agam and managed to brmg it safely to the bank It was a close thmg and a temfymg moment for the young expectant mother I wonder whether this pre-natal expenence of Napoleon xn utero IS the explanation which psychiatrists would give for his later aversion to the sea and the navy'^ In his early youth he wanted to join the navy but changed his mmd and entered the artillery m- stead Had it been otherwise, had he continued his naval trainmg, would he in 1803 have succeeded, instead of so signally fading, in his attempt to cross the Channel for his mvsision of England^^ Corsica became finally French in June 1769 Just two months later Napoleon was born in Ajaccio, and by that precarious mar- gm of time did the future Emperor of France succeed m being bom an honest Frenchman 1 See also p 29 3 Heredity, Ancestors, Parents The Bonaparte family was of Italian origin, and the name was spelt Buonaparte until Napoleon himself adopted the spelhng Bonaparte about 1 796 It was also spelt Buona Parte and Napoleon sometimes imtialled his decrees with the letters B P In derivation I suppose It means ‘of good family’ For the sake of umfonmty I have adopted throughout the spelling ‘Bonaparte’ There are records, some of them of rather obscure or doubtful origin, concerning various very early members of the family The first member of whom a little more authentic information remains was Guillaume, or Guglielmo, called Bonaparte (1235-64) He went from his native Florence in Tuscany to live in Sarzana near Genoa, became a member of the council, and was well settled there in 1264 About this same time there was also a Nicolas, or Nicolo, Bonaparte who was bamshed from Florence m 1268 He went and settled in the nearby town of San Mmiato, also in Tuscany In CEuvres de Napoleon,'^ there is given a line of descent m the earlier periods of the family from 1268 to 1752, but it is somewhat disjointed Also there are some biographical fragments about various early members of the family In these volumes it is mentioned that in 1752 another Nicolas Bonaparte, an army captain, presented to a commission which was set up by the Duke of Tuscany, a request for his genealogy to be investigated He sought to establish a claim to a Florentine title of nobility This invesbgation was undertaken and his claim was said to have been substantiated ^ CEuvres de J^apoUon Bonaparte (Genealogte de JCapoUon Bonaparte Pricis chronologtgue ethistoriquedelaviede XapoUon Bonaparte, Vaxio 1821 5 volumes See also D Morali, Stona genealogtca della famiglta Bonaparte scritta da un San Mxnxalese, Florence 1846 L Ambrosini and A Huard, La Famxlle xmpiriale Hxsloxre de lajamille Bona- parte depuis son origxne jusqu’ en j 85 o.

Her husband’s death during the following year meant, however, the end of her child-bearmg Still, she was surely entitled, if anyone was, to say ‘consummatum est’ Thirteen children m less than twenty years was a good level of productivity even by Corsican standards Whatever other defections his family may have registered against him and however improvident his wife may have considered hun to be, no one could deny that Gharles-Marie was both an attentive husband and an energetic progemtor Napoleon himself says ‘My father died in 1785 If he had hved, my mother was capable of having twenty children ’ A reasonable obstetrical prognosis*^ Having fought so vigorously with Paoh to regain the independ- ence of his native land both against the Genoese and then against the French, Charles-Marie finally became reconciled to the sub- jugation of the island forces and the estabhshment of the new rdgime Indeed in the course of time he was offered and accepted various appointments of political importance and trust m the island under the French authority, and at least on one occasion he went to Versailles and Pans as a representative of Corsican interests Several times he also went to France for health reasons Early m hfe he began to suffer from rheumatism or arthritis, and for this he consulted several doctors in Corsica He followed multifanous courses of diet and took literally gallons — or htres — of medicme, he visited the spa at Montpelher in France and there he seemed to derive some benefit Then he developed digestive symptoms especially pain after meals This was about the begmmng of the year 1784, and m June he went to Pans to consult Dr de la Sonde, the Queen’s physician On his way there he visited his son Napoleon, who was then a student at the Ecole Royale Militaire at Brienne in ^ See Gourgaud, Journal inidU de Sainte H/lene de 1815-1818, published in 1899, Vol 2, p 71 The Family jy Champagne He spent Uvo months m Pans and seemed at first to get some rehefj although he had been gettmg ‘thinner and thinner, and could not digest what he ate’ Napoleon told Antommarchi about all this m conversation one day at St Helena ^ ‘He was attacked by constant vomitmg, and no thing passed through, or remained m his stomach He consulted physicians and gorged himself ivith medicmes ivithout denvmg the least benefit from either ’ Upon advice ‘he ate quantities of jmcy pears and took a great deal of exercise and got well again’ This sounds like treat- ment by a firesh fimt regime He returned to Corsica, but the symp- toms soon recurred and he was worse than ever As he had pre- viously obtained some relief from his arthritis by his visit to Mont- peUier, he decided to go there agam, and his eldest son Joseph and his brother-m-Iaw young Fesch accompamed him when he sailed on 9 November 1784 ^But as Napoleon went on to tell Dr Antom- marchi ‘His hour had come, all medicines proved unavaihng, and he died His complamt had appeared smgular, he was opened, and it -was found that he had a scirrhosis m the pylorus ’ He also remarked that when his father ‘saw the grave half opened’, he suddenly became a very rehgious man and ‘passionately fond of pnests’ Joseph was ivith his father at MontpeUier ivhen he died, but Napoleon, stdl at school at Bnenne, did not learn of his loss till some tune afterwards Charles-Mane died on 24 February 1785,

Minister of the Interior, re- quested Napoleon, who was then First Consul, to permit them to raise a monument m memory of his father But the request was refused, with the observation ‘Do not let us disturb the repose of the dead ’ Later still however, m 1803, unknown to Napoleon, Louis Bonaparte had the body of his father exhumed and trans- ferred to his castle at Saint-Leu, near Pans, where he set up a monument over the tomb ^ When m after years the Chateau of Saint-Leu became the property of the prince of Conde, father of the due d’Enghien, the tomb and monument disappeared, al- though it IS said his bones were preserved ^ A post-mortem was performed upon Charles-Mane the day after his death, and a full report of the pathological findings was wntten out and remained in the possession of the family, probably m Joseph’s hands This was m later years shown to Docteur le baron Dubois, the celebrated accoucheur of Mane Louise, who made a true copy and sent it to Napoleon’s brother Louis m 1811 This copy, made by Dr Dubois, is still extant The following is the text (my translation) The opening of the body of Monsieur Bonaparte has confirmed the opinion of the Doctors of Ajaccio, as to the cause of the persistent, stub- born and ‘hereditary’ voimting which carried him off When he amved in this town and consulted us, we could only agree wth the opinion of the Doctors, and we recogmzed, as they did, that the large tumour in his abdomen (bas-ventre) was located in the walls of the stomach, near its distal opening, and that there was reason to believe that the pylorus ivas involved there In accordance with this opinion, we concluded, as did the Corsican Doctors, that this vomiting was mcurable, that it would end the life of the patient, and that treatment could at most only prolong his days, and relieve the various symptoms which accompamed the vomiting The autopsy was performed by Monsieur Bousquet, surgeon-m-chief of the Vermandois regiment, and Monsieur Fabre, student in surgery of this town, who signed here with us, in the presence of several officers of that regiment ^ M Foissy, La Patmlle Bonaparte depuis Js64jmqu'o nos jours.

of the stomach, near the pylorus The ‘granular’ area may have been secondary glands m the region of the pancreas, and possibly of the hver There were no secondaries in the lungs He had himself been left orphaned when he was fourteen years of age, and he now left his son Napoleon fatherless at fifteen Ebs wife Letizia was thirty-five, a widow with eight children, the youngest less than one year old There were several members of her family and of his, who were near at hand to help her, it is true Napoleon’s great-uncle Lucien was archdeacon of the chap- ter of Ajaccio, and he became adviser and general administrator to the famil y, but he was already gettmg on m years and indeed he died only some six years later Letizia had many a long furrow still to plough, for she had attained the age of eighty-six when she died in 1836 5 Infancy and Childhood We have run ahead a htde m the chronological sequence of Napo- leon’s medical history in order to tell of some of the last events in the life of his father which have important bearmgs on the later story Let us go back to him, a baby in his home at Ajaccio, re- covered from the shock of bemg born but now grappbng with the task of being fed As the war was over and life m the town quiet and peaceful again, Letizia was busy makmg the home comfortable for her husband and the two babies, rearranging the rooms, engaging maids Charles-Mane lost no tune m ingratiatmg himself with the new French administration, and very soon he obtamed an appomt- ment from the Governor as a Counsellor m the local Tribunal It was m this happier and more orderly atmosphere that Napoleon was reared in his earliest years He was small and far from robust when he was bom and he failed to thrive His mother decided her milk was insufficient for his needs and started to make enquiries amongst the village folk for a wet-nurse In a few days she heard of a young woman whom she had known under her maiden name of Camilla Carbone who was married to Augustin Ilari a local Ajaccio sailor They already had a daughter Giovanna and she was now breast-feeding a new- born son Ignazio So Letizia went to see her Camilla was not the luscious and romantic beauty that her name might conjure up, but she had her qualities, and they were quahties far more com- mendable for the post of a wet-nurse She was young and she was strong and she was healthy, deep of bosom if shallow of mind, with a clear skin and a kind heart, and most important of all she had plenty of milk What are mere good looks when weighed against such values^ In any case beauty is in the eye of the beholder and if she was now to be formally introduced to Napoleon, it would surely not be the shape of her nose which would attract him Nor so 21 Infancy and Childhood was It her eyes upon which he was yearning to feast, but something more satisfymg that he was cravmg to devour His mother, however, must have had some difficulty injudgmg in advance the quahty of Camilla’s milk, and would at that eighteenth-century stage of med- ical knowledge have had to depend upon somewhat primitive catena of its composition She could not seek the professional opmion of some biochenucal Solomon, she would have had to rely upon the cursory observations of her two eyes — a. look at the girl’s complexion, a glimpse at her general physique and a furtive glance at the cut of her jib On this evidence she would have had to base her choice of milk content, just as we all every day have to accept the container for the thing contamed, be it the label on a tin of jam or the vintage on a botde of wine The fact that Camilla is authoritatively recorded as having had excellent imlk must there- fore have been estabhshed upon subsequent evidence, to wit its beneficial effects upon her fast fattemng young ‘fils de lait’ An- other case of the proof of the puddmg being in the eating At that time the engagement of a wet-nurse was a much more common mode of dietary or means of therapy than it is today Why has the practice passed into desuetude'^ For today we have every facihty for testing the milk and for testing the mother too, in order to ensure sufficiency m the one and salubrity m the other And with these safeguards the bounties which the wet-nurse offers seem to have certain attractions compared with the cold and un- yielding alternative of food in a bottle For her milk is always ready, it needs no warming, and the cat cannot intrude and knock It over Camilla was engaged, and she did her job to everybody’s satis- faction, not least Napoleon’s She also cared for him, or helped m domg so She is said to have given to him as much if not more attention (and milk) than she gave to her own son Napoleon thus had a double stimulus to the development of an Oedipus complex, but we shall discuss that matter later Camilla’s own son Ignazio appears to have resented greatly this transference of his mother’s attention to his milk-brother, not to mention the denegation of his nght of access to his own legitimate terntory, for when he grew up he too became a sailor, like his father, volunteered for the Bntish Navy and fought against France, his mother-land Let the psych- ologists sort that out G 22 Mapoleon Immortal Napoleon certainly never forgot his first nurse and the affection and care she had bestowed on him in his earhest days Many years afterwards when, as General Bonaparte, he was returning to France from his campaign in Egypt, he paid a visit to Ajaccio As he sailed into the harbour a crush of httle boats pressed close around the ship, the crowds all cheering wildly He landed on the quay and m the throng there was one woman standing all in black She moved a half pace forward as he passed, and caught his glance at once Napoleon recognized his old nurse Carmlla She flushed in her confusion, then greeted him qmte simply ‘Caro figho’ ‘Madre,’ he called back in Figaroman delight It is said that she was carrying a little basket and from this she now produced a glass of milk Presenting it to him she murmured softly ‘My son, I have given you the milk of my heart Now I have no more to offer but some milk from my goat ’ True or not, the story is not altogether out of character, for she became quite a wit m her middle age She was present in Paris at his coronation as Emperor She met the Pope Pius VII, and she met the Empress Josephine The Pope gave her his blessing, Josephine gave her some diamonds A wet-nurse with an opportune eye for capitalizing her privileged position starts with a very great advantage On account of his being rather feeble as a baby, Napoleon’s baptism had been delayed, and it was only when he was nearly two years old that the ceremony was finally arranged This took place on 21 July 1771, in the Cathedral at Ajaccio, and was per- formed by Archdeacon Lucien, his great-uncle He was baptized at the same time as his sister Mane-Anne This was the Marie- Aime who was born on 14 July 1771, and ivho died voung She must not be confused with the later daughter also named Marie- Aime born in 1777 who survived till middle age The baptismal certificate is still preserved A friend of his father’s, Lorenzo Giubega, stood godfather to both the children, and Gert- rude Paravicini was godmother Gertrude was Charles-Mane’s sister, aunt of the children, and you will remember that it was she who was with Letizia on the day when Napoleon was born She mamed her cousin also named Paravicini and she died m 1788 The name given him in the baptismal register was Nabuhone, that bemg the Ajaccio version of the Itahan Napoleone, and of the French Napoleon It was not a common one m France and in Infancy and Childhood 23 Corsica was rare There had, however, been previous members of that name m the Bonaparte family One of his great-uncles, a brother of his grandfather Joseph was, as we have seen, called Napoleon Its derivation is variously given It may be from the Greek meamng ‘of the New City’ as in ‘Napoli’ or ‘Naples’ (Neos = neiv, and Pohs = city ) Others connect ‘Icon’ with ‘lion’ Much play has been made with the name both in recorded speech and in caricature At school in France when he told the other boys his name was Napoleone, proudly using the Italian form, they tittered behind their fingers and called him ‘La Faille au Nez’, and they laughed aloud at his Corsican dialect All his life he liked his more melhfluous Napoleone, and when he found himself referred to with inverted affection in England as ‘Bony’ he would curse the bar- barians for their lack of a sense of music ^ As a young child he was not what mothers call a beautiful baby He had an unusually big head which wobbled about loosely on his shoulders hke a balloon on a string His face was rather pinched, his body puny, his hps were very pale and thin of line He was an irritable and crabby infant, obstinate m many ways, a difficult child, ‘highly strung’ and sometimes ‘turbulent’ His first lessons commenced when he was five at a small local school It was really a school for httle girls, and he was the only boy In conversation with Dr Antommarchi in his last years at St Helena, when he was playing one day with Arthur, the little son of the Grand Marshal Bertrand, Napoleon recounted some memories of his childhood ‘This httle fellow is as independent as I was at his age, but the fits of passion to which I gave way, proceeded from more excusable motives I leave you to judge — I had been placed in a school of young ladies, the mistress of which was known to our family, and being a pretty boy, and the only one there, I was caressed by every one of my fair schoolfellows I might generally be seen with my stockings down, and covering half my shoes, and in our walks I constantly held the hand of a charming httle girl, who was the cause of many broils and quarrels My mahcious comrades, jealous of my Giacominetta, combined these two circumstances together in a song which they made, and whenever I appeared in the street they followed me, singing, “Napoleone di mezza Calzetta, fa I’amore ' See also Bougon, ‘Les Manies de Napoleon ler’. La Chronique MidicaU, 1905, Vol la, p 524 2^ Napoleon Immortal a Giacoimnetta'” I could not bear to be laughed at’ This girls’ school was not his only early education A certain Abbe Recco, a teacher at the College at Ajaccio, also taught him, especially in learning to read On another occasion at St Helena he asked Antom- marchi to pierce the ears of httle Hortense Bertrand, so that he could put in the ear-rings which he had given her, and at this, her brother Arthur started stamping and storming Napoleon then re- counted how he too as a httle boy in his Ajaccio days was ‘just as resolute at his age, noisy, quarrelsome and feared nobody’ He often fought with his brother Joseph, hitting, biting, punchmg, scratching, no holds barred, and ruefully admitted that his mother dealt with him appropriately ‘Her affection was tempered by severity, she punished and rewarded without distinction ’ He remembered it all He had an extraordinary retentive and comprehensive memory throughout his life Most of us have to clear out old memones in order to make room for new, yet it is curious how certain trivial and unimportant events of our child- hood can remain as sharp and vivid images in our minds in later life One remembers there were twelve steps on the stairs up to the nursery, or recalls every detail about buying a beautiful yellow canary one rainy day at the pet shop with the green door and paying the lady ninepence for it The more one thinks of it, the more curious it seems Why should particular isolated occurrences be selected and put away in the pigeon-holes of memory when so many other events of the penod have been forgotten, events no doubt of far greater importance and sigmficance^ The psycho- analysts say that many of the unremembered expenences have been lost or submerged in the unconscious ego because they are distasteful or repugnant to our conscious minds And they — the pyschoanalysts — claim that they can salvage and restore them to our advantage Be that as it may, it still does not explain why certain other recollections, trivial inconsequential ones, are chosen by our perverse minds to persist so long and so vividly, and to be treasured up so preciously all through the hurly-burly of the years Durmg these years of his childhood up to the age of ten he had no serious illnesses or accidents He had occasional bowel disorders, and sometimes bouts of constipation It has been said that some trouble with the secretion of his bile’- was the cause of a dry skm ^ Cabanes, An ckevet de VEmpereur^ p 38 Infancy and Childhood 25 and a sallow complexion But surely his bile had nothmg what- ever to do with his complexion, the tint of which was his natural colounng, mtensified by the Corsican sun Letizia had a deep devoted love for all her children, and they had true affection for her — mingled with a httle fear no doubt For she brought them up with Spartan rigour and iron disciphne It was she and not their father who administered on more than one occasion a proper dose of physical persuasion One such belt- mg which Napoleon got as a boy he remembered all his days This was one of the major, not one of the minor, events which stuck m his memory from his childhood He relates how one day his mother caught him and his young sister Pauhne jeering at their crippled grandmother behind her back, and how she promptly dealt Pauhne a good spanking upon an adipose and promment part of her anatomy Napoleon managed to escape because, as he explamed, it was easier to hft Pauline’s petticoats than it was to unbutton his pants But his mother always administered her justice on a basis of equahty of the sexes and when later he had gone to his room she followed, bolted the door, and gave him a gluteal reminder which it did not need a psychoanalyst to retneve from the hmbo of repressions But then they say that repression of the child may breed revolution in the man Perhaps it did 6 ^And then the whining schoolboy^ When Napoleon was seven years old, his father put his name down for a place at one of the ficoles Mihtaires in France Dunng recent years, all the ardent zeal and all the fiery fervour which Gharles- Mane had previously shown in Paoli’s fight for Corsican indepen- dence had been transferred to support for the new French regime He was not quite ignorant about which side his bread was buttered, nor was he the man to let the faihngs of yesterday spoil the pros- pects of tomorrow As a consequence he had managed to secure for himself several posts of importance, and now when he sought assistance for his son the Governor of the island, the Comte de Marbeuf, supported his application, and less than two years later word was received that Napoleon had been granted a place at the Military College of Tiron His elder brother Joseph w'as to study for the church, but neither of the boys could speak a single word of French Italian, and only the curious Corsican dialect of that, was all they spoke The Comte de Marbeuf accordingly advised that both of them should go at once to France, and he recommended a College at Autun ivhere they could cram the basic elements of French in preparation for their subsequent studies Thus it was arranged, and on 15 December 1778 Charles-Marie with Joseph and Napoleon sailed from Ajaccio for Marseilles, waving farewell to Letizia on the quay, with two young children clutching at her skirts and a new-born infant huddled in her arms Just over a fortnight later on i January (1779), the two boys, their tongues silent with awe, their bladders clamant with anxiety, were mtroduced to the master of the College at Autun in Burgundy ^ Napoleon was just over lune years of age He was put in charge of * The date is confirmed by Napoleon m his opaques de ma Vte See also

other languages he had no aptitude, and less desire, to learn them, and throughout his life he spumed all other tongues but Itahan and French Whereas he stayed at this school for so short a penod, Joseph remamed for some five years to contmue his general educa- tion and pursue his ecclesiastical studies All the time Napoleon ivas at Autun, there is no doubt he was grossly miserable He was not by any means a sociable boy, mdeed he was qmte the reverse He spent his spare time wandermg alone, brooding, pensive, and solemn, if not actually sullen A boy of mne, for the first time away from

instead of the entry at Tiron, he had recommended his son for a bursary at the Fcole Royale Mihtaire at Bnenne Accordmgly with his superficial smattering of French, Napoleon left Autun and went to

Principal was a Monsieur Louis Berton, an understanding though severe man Amongst Napoleon’s contemporary students there, two of those who later made their names were Charles-fitienne Cesar de Gudin, land Champion de Nansouty, but the one who was subsequently to prove his mtimate friend and confidant was Fauvelet de Bour- rienne, who m later years became his private secretary and also wrote his memoirs At school at Brienne, Bourrienne was his closest, if not his only friend Many conflicting tales and doubtful anecdotes are told of Napo- leon’s life while at tlus school, but we can deduce a general picture of him there He was not a particularly bright student although he applied himself well, and no doubt his scanty knowledge of French handicapped him very considerably He was still certainly very far from happy, and he found the atmosphere and the compamonship both uncongemal The other students teased hun constantly, calhng him an uncouth Corsican, and laughing at his accent He for his part reviled all Frenchmen, to him they were the oppressors, the ravishers of his beloved native land As at Autun, he remained a sohtary boy, rather melancholic in disposition, and he took no mterest whatsoever in games Gharlet’s painting depictmg the young Napoleon at Brienne catches the atmosphere very well Twice he wrote to his parents imploring them to come and take him home He was slim but held himself erect and his health was excellent ^ In September 1783 when he had been at the school over four years Chevalier de Keralio, the mspector-general for all the ficoles Militaires, made one of his regular inspections at Brienne and he wrote a report from which we obtain a first hand and enlightening account of him at this age, of his health, his mental make-up and character

completed his fourth course He imll make an excellent sailor, [my italics] he deserves to pass to the Mihtary School at Pans From his very early days he seems to have settled clearly m his mmd that he wanted to be a soldier or a sailor In the first years at Bnenne he was destmed for the navy, but soon after the date of Keraho’s report his mother came to see him at the school and she too had defimte views on his career Though some deny that his mother ever visited him, Montholon m his Memoires^ says that m conversation at St Helena Napoleon told him of this visit ‘When my mother came to see me she was so distressed at my thinness and at my altered character ’ He explamed that this was because he worked so hard, even doing lessons when he should have been at play His mother m addition to other admomtions did everythmg she could to dissuade him from the navy, saymg m her maternal anxiety that there he would have to face not only the penis of shot and shell but also the hazards of fire and water — especially ivater Some time durmg his final year at Bnenne he changed his mind about the navy, and decided to study for the artillery instead What was it that influenced him, at the age of fourteen years, to switch from the navy to the army^ His mother had ahvays been a guiding force m the family, was it she who had now decided his career for him , was it another case of the mother of the man bemg the back-stage author of his greatness^ Or was it a case of pre- natal influence noiv producmg m him a fear of the sea^ For you remember that while carrymg him, his mother was foUowmg the army mth her husband m Corsica and m the thick of those cam- paigns she, with her heart m her mouth and ivith Napoleon m her womb, had expenenced a baptism of Are They also experienced a baptism of water when on that terrifying occasion she was swept away down the stream by the ragmg torrent of the Liamone nver Did this at the same tune disturb the embryomc Napoleon^” Pre- natal influence is credited with many far-reachmg effects even by mothers of the present day Recently a lad of twenty with a con- gemtal malformation of his fingers came to hospital and asked if anything could be done for it He said he thought his hand looked Memoires de Montholon, Vo\\ 2, pp 17-18 * See p 7 ^0 Napoleon Immortal like a frog His mother, he explained, while weeding in the garden just before he was born, had put her hand upon a large fat frog, and it gave her such a fnght that when he was born he was found to have his right hand withered into the shape of that frog Did Napoleon’s mother’s fright, when she was nearly droivned a month or so before he was bom, likewise disturb her baby’s mind? ,One may smile at such old wives’ tales On the other hand there is no doubt it profoundly distressed the mother and it is possible that when she pictured m imagination her son’s career at sea, some deep subconscious urge directed her to dissuade him from the navy before it was too late As a httle boy he had spent all his days by the sea at Ajaccio, many men of the village were sailors, and he was in and out of boats so frequently Determmed as he was from childhood to enter one of the armed services, is it any wonder that his first and natural inclination was towards the navy? But what- ever the factor which now altered his mind, pre-natal influence, maternal persuasion, scholastic bent or youthful instinct, there is no doubt that this decision of the boy Napoleon to turn from the navy to a career in the army, changed the course of events not only in his life but in that of France and perhaps of Europe Naval men are seldom politicians, it is the army which seems to sow the seed and promote the growth of such aspirations It is the Wellmgtons and not the Nelsons who most often seek to capitalize m political fields their former glory in the fighting hne But even if Napoleon had developed his same ambitions, he imght, had he been seques- tered in the navy, have missed those very opportumties of pohtical power which brought him to his ultimate supremacy He would have remained a frustrated square peg in an uncomfortable round hole But as occurred in so many of his judgements and vital deci- sions in later hfe, he chose even at this early stage m his education the right and proper course Had he continued his career in the navy, would he have beaten Nelson at Trafalgar? Would the French under Marshal Ney or some other Commander then have defeated Wellington at Waterloo? Thus by one small decision is the face of history changed So slight a turn by the helmsman’s hand, so great a shift in the journey’s end The year after his mother’s visit his father came to see him This was on 21 June 1784 Charles-Marie was already a very sick man and was going to Pans to seek medical advice from Dr de la Sonde, ^And then the whining schoolboy at the same time takmg his daughter Mane-Anne to school at Samt-Cyr This as it transpured was the last time that Napoleon saiv his father before his death On his way back to Corsica after his visit to the physician, Charles-Mane called at the school at Autun, collected Joseph and took him home with him What Dr de la Sonde’s opmion was we do not know, but it would seem that the aihng man now reahzed the gravity of his illness and wanted to have his eldest son at home to assist ivith the famil y affairs Shortly afterwards he received final confirmation that his second son had been given a place at the Mihtary School of Pans and accordingly on 30 October 1 784 Napoleon left Bneime Today m the village of Bnenne-le-Chateau stands a statue of him as a boy, his left hand holds a book, his right hand holds a pose, for it IS stuck ivith pompous ostentation between the buttons of his pouting waistcoat The student’s text-book is qmte m period, the hand stuck in the waistcoat is anachronisbc It was indeed much later than this tune before he first commenced such exhibitionist poses It was a quiet and introspective boy of fifteen who left the school at Bnenne ivith no flourish and no regrets ^ At the Mihtary School of Pans, that great and imposing edifice facing the Champs de Mars, he was now to be engaged upon the strictly mihtary train- ing which was to fit him for a commission in the artillery He was still of frail rather than of robust bmld, thm and inchned to be short m stature He -was not at all athletic but studious and some- thing of a dreamer, he had no ear whatever for music, and no aptitude for languages His coUoqmal Itahan was rapid and fluent, and he would often break into it when he was angry, his French was, however, improving Mathematics and history were his strongest subjects, the precise and the exact had always been his inchnation His handwriting was quite atrocious There was at this time a deep psychological conflict disturbing his youthful mmd He was here in an unnatural environment He to himself personified his native Corsica, his homeland, his father, he himself, had aU been persecuted and beaten mto subjection by ^ Napoleon says in his Epoqius de ma Vie ‘Parti pour I’ecole de Pans

Immortal monarchical France, yet paradoxically here was he now in that very country, surrounded by the luxury of the French nobihty, their sons his school-fellows, and he hving on the King’s bounty Here was his problem While at Brienne he was still of immature years, and his young mind had been unable to cope with this conflict of circumstances He was at odds with the people around him He felt he was in an unfnendly world, his fellow-students liable to reject him On dealmg with this difficult and frustrating situation the only means at the disposal of such a boy is withdrawal from all ordinary contacts to live in a separate world of phantasy Thus It was that Napoleon at this time seems to have been on the thres- hold of schizophrema He was gloomy, unsociable, taciturn, and egocentric He had till now been very much dominated by his mother, dominated it is true by respect and devotion rather than by fear And he was experiencing difficulty in that transition through which a boy normally passes at this age, the transibon from a fixation upon his mother to an identification with his father Now, however, he had passed on to the Mihtary School of Pans, he was older, and his expanding mind was maturing with his age His enthusiasm and his ambition in his mihtary career were grow- ing and he began to see purpose in his efforts, and a goal He seemed to react qmte suddenly, the former conflicts of his mind were sublimated into intensive study and vigorous energy in his work at school He began slowly to gam confidence again He be- came expansive, even assertive While at this military school he once thought of writing and publishing a poem about his hero Paoh and his fight for Corsican freedom, no doubt intending to paint himself into the picture as a local patriot avenging his native land But when this project came to the ears of the masters, he was reminded that he was an eUve du Roi and that this attitude might meet with the disapproval of the authorities He was advised to modify his bombastic patriotism for Corsica and to exhibit a little more partiality for France He took the hint, but the mere fact of his having contemplated writing on such a subject demonstrates the fifteen-year-old boy’s changing mentahty Less than four months after his arrival at the school in Pans, his father died Although he was the second son in birth, he had become the first son m responsibility, Joseph had always played second fiddle to his brother With his father’s death, his retarded 'And then the whining schoolboy psychological development forward into the stage of identification with his father, was sudden, sharp, and salutary and from then on- wards he found his real self-confidence The problems posed by his former feehngs of incompatibihty with the world and the people around him had given him a sense of infenonty This now dis- appeared and he manifested an altogether new attitude towards his fellow-students, he approached them ivith an air of authority, and was mdeed described as ‘haughty, egoistic, sharp m rephes, qmck and harsh m his repartees, ambitious’ ^ It will be recalled that his father had returned to Corsica m August 1784 As his health got no better he decided m November to come back to Paris He brought Joseph wth him and on the journey he called at Aix and consulted Dr Tumaton who advised him to go to Montpelher There Charles-Mane was treated by Dr La Mure, Dr Sabatier, and Dr Barthez, but he went steadily down- hill, and as we have seen, he died on 24 February 1785 ^ Napoleon did not get word of his father’s death for several weeks, but when he did, he wrote to his great-uncle, the Archdeacon Lucien, requestmg him to stand tn loco parentis to the family He also wrote to his mother Pans March 28, 1785 Dear

shall meet again He also had one great enemy, Le Picard de Phehppeaux Neither the one nor the other did he forget all his life After exactly one year at the college he received his commission ivith the rank of beulenant-en-second He was then sixteen years of age Out of fifty-eight heutenants coimmssioned from all the schools of France, he was placed forty-second in the order of merit, so he was not the brightest student by a long way But he could at least boast that he was the first Corsican known to have qualified from this school He passed out on 28 October 1785, and after spending two days in saying his farewells, farewells which seem to have been with real regret, he set out by coach and boat to jom the Rdgiment de La Fere at Valence This was his first proud postmg 7 The Lieutenant at Valence If corsets and cosmetics make the woman, mili tary uniforms and moustaches make the man They were two very smart young officers who vaulted from the boat at Valence as soon as it came broadside to the pier that early November mommg m 1 785 Napoleon and his fhend Alexandre Demazis each wore a sparkhng new uniform, and each bore with proud self-consciousness a sub-heutenant’s badge The dress regaha of the Regiment de La Fere was, in their own avowed opmion, the finest in the whole of the French Army, and the most stylish both in cut and m colour And if at this pubertial period Napoleon was no Adonis m face or in figure, his umform could cover qmte a multitude of sms and physical deficiencies After leavmg Pans on this flush exciting journey, to sally forth upon their first commission, the two young men had dined in style at Fontamebleau and then slept at an mn at Sens that same mght A jogghng coach conveyed them to Chalons-sur-Saone and thence they took a boat on to Lyon, and down stream along the Rhone to their destination at Valence Napoleon at once reported to his regimental commander, le chevaher de Lance This regiment was one of the crack umts of the army, the one which later was to be designated the First Regiment He was attached to the bombardiers of the Fifth Bngade The regiment -was also the one which always provided the two compames detailed for duty overseas in Corsica and for this added reason he had been so very anxious to secure a posting to it Upon arrival m the town of Valence, he was allotted to a billet at the private home of a certam Monsieur Bou, a prosperous local merchant with a large house and a lone daughter The house was most attractive, the daughter was fifty But Mademoiselle Mane- Claudine Bou, may her tribe too increase, had a heart of sohd gold, her middle age had mellowed her in kindlmess and her spinsterhood had never soured her soul Instead it had sharpened her maternal 35 gS Napoleon Immortal instincts and when this mere boy came to her home she mothered him with all her tender care And just what did the mere boy look like at sixteen years of age^ An historian, A M Franck, from Valence, more than a century later set his mind to collecting any local information about the young officer’s boyhood in the town He then presented his gleanings at a public lecture m the year 1897 under the title ‘Valence en 1785 et le lieutenant Bonaparte’ He described Napoleon at this period of his hfe as small, beardless, pale, thin his shoulders looked so narrow in his uniform which hung loosely as he moved, about his neck a high pleated cravat, long straight hanging locks hid his temples, his cheeks were hol- low, his mouth had an air of seriousness as if pursed up with care, his eyes were alert and observant His voice was deep and of low tone, he spoke seldom and always briefly, his strong but cross irascible nature printed upon his face all the signs of firmness as well as those of obstinacy, in short his whole aspect was that of a meditative and reserved young man, httle given to conversation, defiant yet shy Madame Junot, Duchesse d’Abrant^s, records a very similar picture of him ^ This house where Napoleon was billeted is large and three stones in height It still stands in the Grand’rue on the corner with what was formerly the rue du Croissant and is now marked the rue Lieutenant Bonaparte Directly opposite the house in this very narrow street is the picturesque old Maison des Tetes built m 1532 and adorned on its fagade and in its porch with scores of weather- beaten sculptured heads A large high mural plaque today indicates where his billet was, and you may mount the stairs and see his room, if you enquire pohtely of the present owner of the Galeries Bonaparte on the ground floor By degrees the shy retiring lad appears to have come out more and more from the hermitage of his introspection, and after a feiv months we hear of him accepting various social invitations to homes about the town He had arrived here quite unknown, and his nature then was such that he made friends very slowly Amongst those who invited him out, there was one family in particular with whom he found himself at home and quickly at his ease This was the house of Madame Gregoire du Colombier She was a leading figure of the town, a lady of great charm, fifty-four years of age, intelligent, * Duchesse d’Abrantfa, Vol i, p 28 The Lieutenant at Valence cultured and distinguished Young Napoleon felt at once the warmth of her kindly heart, and thereafter often sought the wisdom of her counsel She had one daughter, Carohne Napoleon was then six- teen, and Carohne ivas just a httle older His shyness found a match in her demureness, and in this common ground of understanding a real friendship soon grew up between them Into his romantic teen- age ruminations there seem to have come at times vague thoughts of marriage If, as Monsieur Franck records, his voice had already broken, he was apparendy qualified for matrimony m terms of maturity if not in terms of money The love which they both vowed to each other, if artless and chaste, was for that none the less sincere Quite the antithesis, however, from the courtship which was being simultaneously waged by his friend Alexandre Demazis, who havmg been earher smitten by the attractions of another Valence girl named Adelaide, pursued her ‘with great strides, his eyes vnde, his blood boding, his love fierce’ But so far as one can discover m the sequel, Adelaide was apparendy not only very attracbve, she was also a very good runner Napoleon met his more placid Carohne one early summer morn- ing in the orchard and with his heart thumpmg hard against his nbs and his courage firmly grasped m both his hands went so very dangerously far as to liken his pouting hps to the chemes which he picked and gave to her But he went no further There is m existence the manuscript of a love story which he commenced to ivnte while at Valence Was this ivntten around Carohne^ In any case the symphony remained unfinished In 1792 she married a Monsieur Garempel de Bressieux, a retired army captam, and went to hve at Lyon Napoleon did not see her again for tiventy years But as is the curious way with the romances of sweet sixteen, the longer the retrospect the happier the memory In 1805 she ivrote to him and they met at Lyon as he was passing through the toivn on his way to Milan to be crowned King of Italy In later years her husband was granted an official government post, her brother a heutenancy, and Carohne herself was appomted lady-in-waitmg to Madame M6re In 1810 her husband became a Baron of the Empire Thus should every lover who has loved and lost, reward his rival who has loved and won In his last years at St Helena, Napoleon more than once thought of her and spoke with a gloiv of emotion of his boyhood flame, his Carohne, and warmed his chilhng heart before his D ^8 Napoleon Immortal memories of Valence Among the county families of the town in whose society he was entertained, one other girl also seems to have made some impression on him This was Mademoiselle de Lauberie de Saint-Germain She, however, never touched his heart as Caroline had done Twenty years later, however, she was appointed a lady-in-waiting to the Empress, and her husband Bachasson de Montahvet was made a Count Napoleon’s memory was long His nepotism never caused a blush when granting favours to his family, nor did discretion hold his lavish hand when showering patronage upon former friends Blood is thicker than water, and the flames of youth burn brighter than the flres of middle age Napoleon had good reason for retaimng very happy recollections of Valence all his life He arrived an unknown lad, he had a nature which often made him rather unattractive company, the kindness he received he never afterwards forgot It IS stated that on 14 August while still stationed in the town he went with a detachment of his regiment to Lyon where a minor insurrection had broken out, and that while there he had an attack of fever and was looked after by a Mademoiselle Agier (or Atgier) from Geneva There is a good deal of doubt whether in fact this journey ever took place, and if he was ill at the time it was probably no more than just a cold or influenza In any case he was back in Valence a fortnight later Having now done one full year of service he was due for leave He looked forward so eagerly to a holiday with his fanuly in Corsica He had first left home for France in December 1778, and had never been back since Nearly eight years Now he was seventeen On 1 September 1 786 he packed his kitbag and set out for home 8 Return to Corsica and a Consultation with Dr Tissot He leaned against the gunwale of the boat as it sailed into the harbour of Ajaccio, has hands were tightly clenched upon the rail, his eyes alert, as he stood tense and waiting It was a thnlhng moment on that sunny day of 15 September 1786 ^ Everythmg, everybody seemed new and almost strange to him He was only mne, when eight long years ago he had sailed away wth his father from this very spot, away to school m France Now’ he w’as returning aU alone, for his father had died the year before His mother had altered httle m appearance despite the three more children she had borne But if Napoleon sais' some changes in his Corsica, the Cor- sicans saw even more changes m him He was noiv an officer m the army of France with an air of purpose printed on his face and a growing sense of duty m his heart The death of his father at such an early age, leaving behind this large family, created many difficulties for them Letizia was a capable and careful mother but the administration of the family lands and the full direction of their finances were problems alto- gether far too ponderous for her untutored mmd Of her eight children, at the timeivhen Napoleon arrived home, Joseph was away at the Umversity of Pisa studying law, Luaen was still at school at Bnenne, Mane- Anne was in France a pupil at the convent of Samt- Louis at Saint-Cyr, Louis, Pauhne, Carohne, and Jerome, aged eight, six, four, and two, were traihng their mother's skirts in proper anthmetic progression The family finances were rather strained, and this at the moment was adding appreciably to their

claimed by the farmly from the local Government in respect of some land and a plantation of mulberry trees As soon as he got home Napoleon realized his mother’s difficulties, and at once got to grips with them First his great-uncle Lucien That he was getting old was the lesser portion of his trouble His increasing incapacity was in much greater measure due to the fact that he was badly crippled with gout and for the past fifteen months had been completely bedridden The family had consulted several doctors of the island, but without securing the slightest benefit What more could they do'’ At Lausanne in Switzerland was a medical man with a good name and a world- wide reputation, a certain Dr Tissot, who had written m 1768 a Traite de la Sante des gens de lettres and had also published a book on Onanisme ^ In the former work he had indulged m some panegyrics upon Pasquale Paoli and this partisanship no doubt recommended him strongly to Napoleon’s mind But why the book on onanism should give him any reputation for the cure of gout, it is difficult to discern In any case Napoleon probably did not know what onanism meant, so the versatile physician’s interest in this subject would not have deterred him from his plan He was completely unknown to the doctor, but for all his youthful years he was evidently beginning to show himself a person of initiative Without hesitation and without introduction of any kind he decided to take the overt hberty of writing directly to Dr Tissot regarding his great-uncle’s health So he sent him the following letter ® ^ Coston, Vol 2, p 80

of London, of the Medico-physical Academy of Basle, and of the Economic Society of Berne Lausanne, Switzerland Ajaccio, Corsica I April 1787 Sir, You have spent your days teachmg humamty, and your reputation has penetrated into the very mountains of Corsica, where people practise little of the art of medicine Indeed the brief but glonous praise winch you have given to their beloved general [Paoh], is sufficient to fill their hearts with gratitude, to which, in the circumstances, I am happy to be able to testify on behalf of all my compatriots Not havmg the honour of being known to you, and having no claim other than the esteem which I hold for your work, I make bold to ask a favour and to seek your advice for an uncle of mine who has gout It IS a poor start to this my consultation when I tell you that the patient in question is seventy years of age, but. Sir, remember that some men live even to a hundred and more and my uncle’s constitution is such that he might well be numbered amongst those thus privileged, he is of medium height, has never subjected himself to any abuse, either of women or of the table, neither too sedentary [a life] nor too little [exercise], has never been agitated by those violent passions which disturb the animal economy He has had almost no illnesses at all throughout his entire lifetime I shall not say, as Fontenelle does, that he possesses the tivo great qualities for life, a good body and a bad heart, but I believe that having always been rather egotistical, he found himself in the happy position of one \\\\ho never had to exert himself to the full An old Genoese who had gout once predicted to him ivhen he was young that he would be afflicted with this malady, a prediction which he founded upon the observation that my uncle had very small hands and feet and a very large head I think you will be of the opinion that the fact that this prediction has proved correct is no more than a result of chance His gout, in fact, seized him at the age of thirty-Uvo, his feet and knees have always been the site affected, sometimes it subsided for as long as fourteen years without flanng up again, an attack lasted one or two months Ten years ago, amongst other occasions, the gout returned and the attack lasted nine months It will be hvo years in June since the gout affected his feet since then he has been continuously confined to his bed From his feet gout spread to his knees, which were considerably swollen, from that time all use of his knees has been impossible, cruel pain de- veloped in his knees and feet, his head was affected by it, and he passed the first two months of his time in bed in constant distress, little by litde, although he had no treatment, the knees became less swollen, the feet got better and the patient had no other trouble be) ond his inability to bend his knees as the result of the settling of the gout in his thighs [aux jarrets], that is to say in the nerics and artenes which control movement ^ Napoleon Immortal If he tries to move his knees acute pam arrests the movement He sleeps without moving, his bed is never remade, the mattress is simply shaken up and the blankets and pillows rearranged He eats well, and digests his food, talks, reads, sleeps and his days go by without him moving at all, and without his being able to enjoy the pleasant sunshine He implores the help of your science, if not to cure him at least to shift his wretched trouble to some other part of his anatomy Humanity, Sir, bids me hope that you will deign to reply to this request so poorly propounded by me, who myself have for the past month been tormented by a tertian fever [une fifevre tierce], which makes me wonder whether you will be able to read this seribble I conclude. Sir, by expressing to you the perfect esteem which the reading of your works has inspired in me and the sincere thanks which I hope to owe to you Sir, I am with the deepest respects, your very humble and most obedient servant BUONAPARTE, Officier d’artillene au regiment dc La Ffere ^ This letter written by Napoleon throws light on various aspects of his mentality at this time In the first place it shows the temerity, indeed the rank pre- sumption, of the lad of seventeen He and his family were in per- sonal trouble, so nothing whatsoever was to be allowed to stand m the way of his endeavour to get what he wanted It sigmfied nothing that he did not know Dr Tissot, nor Dr Tissot him, that he was far enough away in another country, that he was asking for expert advice without the patient being first examined by the medical man Moreover he makes no mention of paying a fee for the advice which he was seeking, and to camouflage the point of his presumption, he makes a doleful reference to his own illness Was this in order to cull sympathy or did he want more gratuitous advice, just for good measure^ In the second place there is a record scribbled on the back of this letter which indicates Dr Tissot’s curt reaction to its receipt He of course could not foresee the heights to which his young and unknown correspondent would one day climb, yet he did not brus- quely throw the letter into his waste-paper basket He wrote on the back of It ‘Lettre non rdpondue, peu intdressante’, and he preserved it m his files The third feature of this letter is that it shows how badly Napoleon wrote French In the original form as he penned it, there are many mistakes in spelling, m tense and gender, and in ^ This IS my translation mainly from the Eynard original version Return to Corsica construction, although others who have since quoted this letter have taken upon themselves the task of correcting the errors and present- ing a mce fair copy One might imagine that he would have con- sulted his great-uncle not only about the symptoms of his complaint but also upon the actual \\mtmg of the letter to the doctor, for the Archdeacon of Ajaccio was a man of education On the other hand his natural tongue was also Itahan so perhaps any assistance he might have given to his Corsican nephew m the matter of wntmg a letter m French nught have sounded rather hke a stammermg Spamard teaching an Englishman to learn German It is strange too that Napoleon nowhere m his letter mentions his uncle’s name nor his ecclesiastical position m Ajacao, he merely refers to him as ‘an uncle of mine’ Perhaps had he done so, Dr Tissot might have been a httle more comphant towards a request to assist a churchman, and a distmguished one at that The fourth thmg to be noted about the letter is, I think, that for a boy of his years he gives what is really a very good account indeed of his great-uncle, of the past history of his illness, and of his present clmical condition A pity Dr Tissot did not ansi\\er, for otherwise we might have had a very lUuminatmg correspondence One other matter of mterest from the medical pomt of view is mentioned m this letter, and that is the information iv’e get from Napoleon’s oivn hand of the illness which he himself suffered durmg this his first return to Ajaccio He was ill with a fever which he calls ‘fievre tierce’ dunng the whole of March Did he really mean tertian malana^ The disease was common m Corsica but this is the earhest mention we have of his suffering from it There ivere certainly other feverish attacks in the course of the next few years and we shall have to watch developments In another place he also records that he had a ‘cnse d’hypocondne’ about this time, though what he means by that is even more obscure ^ It may have been these indispositions, it may have been the urgency of the family affairs, or it may have been merely that he was greatly enjoymg his hohday at home, but whatever the reason, he wrote to the Colonel of his regiment askmg for a further five and a half months’ leave He enclosed a medical certificate from his local doctor — quite m the modem manner He also i\\TOte ‘m view 1 See Georges Barral, ‘La Sante dc Napoleon ler’. La Chrorttqui MiiicaU, igoo, Vol 7, pp 34-42, 104-7, 227-35 ^ Napoleon Immortal of my lack of funds and of the costly treatment, I request that the leave be granted with pay’ ' The other difficulty which neither the Archdeacon nor Joseph nor Letizia had been able to clear up, and which Napoleon no\\V set himself to tackle with a will, was this problem of the payment' due to them from the government authorities for the plantation of mul- berry trees which some years earlier Charles-Marie had undertaken to establish Remembering that to date he had been at Ajaccio for just one year, he now decided without further delay to go over the heads of the local officials and to proceed straight to Pans in order to seek a solution There he intended to buttonhole the Controller- general and to pour his case directly down his more compassionate ear Full of hope and free of heart he embarked on 12 September (1787) 9 The Lights and Shades of Pans The brown leaves were already beginning to fall and clutter the pavements of the boulevards when he amved m Pans in the first days of October He got a room at the Hotel de Cherbourg, rue du Four-Saint-Honore, which is now No 33 rue de VauviUiers in the market place just behind the Louvre, and bustled straight into his business He must have succeeded almost beyond his expectations, for it was only a matter of a few weeks before he had arranged all his affairs He also got sanction for a further six weeks leave And then his thoughts turned suddenly elsewhere Up to the age of sixteen he had been continuously hvmg at school, then for a year under strict surveillance as a young officer in his first regimental post This was followed by a year at home at Ajaccio He had been, as Frederic Masson remarks, ‘toujours chaste’ Now for the first time in his life he found himself alone and at large in Pans ‘A Pans’, as Masson also says, ‘c’est la femme qui le fait Pans ’ He thought one evening he would go for a stroll — to seek as he naively puts it ‘une experience philosophique’ He records the whole story of that evemng in his own words ^ Thursday, 22 November 1787, Pans Hotel de Cherbourg, rue du Four-Saint-Honore 1 had come out from the Italiens and was isalkmg rapidly along the alleys of the Palais-Royal My emotions, stirred by these strong feelings which are part of my very nature, made me indifferent to the cold, but as my imagination cooled, I became conscious of the seventy of the weather and sought the shelter of the arcades I ivas just by the iron gates when my eyes fell"
