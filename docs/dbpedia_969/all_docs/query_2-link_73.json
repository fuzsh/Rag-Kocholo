Australian politician, writer and lawyer, born in Geelong. Educated at Melbourne University, he was a public servant, high school teacher, television and radio performer, university lecturer and lawyer before serving as a Labor MP in the Victorian Parliament 1972–77 and the Australian House of Representatives 1977–98. He took a leading role in reviving the Australian film industry, abolishing the death penalty in Australia, and was the first politician to raise public awareness of global warming, the ‘post‑industrial’ society, the IT revolution, biotechnology, the rise of ‘the Third Age’ and the need to preserve Antarctica as a wilderness. In the *Hawke Government, he was Minister for Science 1983–90, Prices and Consumer Affairs 1987, Small Business 1987–90 and Customs 1988–90. He became a member of the Executive Board of UNESCO, Paris 1991–95 and National President of the Australian Labor Party 1992–2000, 2005–06. He was Deputy Chairman of the Constitutional Convention 1998. His books include Decades of Decision 1860– (1965), Joseph II (1968), Age of Apocalypse (1975), and he edited The Penalty is Death (1968). Sleepers, Wake!: Technology and the Future of Work was published by Oxford University Press in 1982, became a bestseller and has been translated into Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Swedish and braille. The fourth edition was published in 1995. Knowledge Courage Leadership: Insights & Reflections, a collection of speeches and essays, appeared in 2016. He received a DSc for his services to science in 1988 and a DLitt in 1993 for his work on information theory. Elected FTSE (1992), FAHA (1993), FAA (1996) and FASSA (2003), he is the only person to have become a Fellow of four of Australia’s five learned Academies. Awarded an AO in 1993, named as one of Australia’s 100 ‘living national treasures’ in 1997, he was elected a Visiting Fellow Commoner of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1999. His autobiography, A Thinking Reed, was published in 2006 and The Shock of Recognition, about music and literature, in 2016. In 2014 he received an AC for services ‘as a leading intellectual in Australian public life’. Sleepers, Wake NOW! will be published by Scribe in 2020.\n\nv\n\nAbbreviations AC/AO\n\nCompanion/Officer of the Order of Australia\n\nGCSI/ KCSI/ CSI\n\nGrand Cross/Knight Commander/ Dame Commander/Companion of the Order of the Star of India\n\nADC\n\nAide de camp\n\nAIDS\n\nAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome\n\nGCVO/ KCVO/ DCVO/ CVO\n\nGrand Cross/Knight Commander/ Dame Commander/Companion of the Royal Victorian Order\n\na.k.a.\n\nalso known as\n\nALP\n\nAustralian Labor Party\n\nBAFTA\n\nBritish Academy of Film and Television Arts\n\nGOC\n\nGeneral Officer Commanding\n\nBBC\n\nBritish Broadcasting Corporation\n\nILO\n\nInternational Labour Organization\n\nBEF\n\nBritish Expeditionary Force\n\nKC/QC\n\nKing’s/Queen’s Counsel\n\nKG/LG\n\nKnight/Lady of the Order of the Garter\n\nCC/OC\n\nCompanion/Officer of the Order of Canada\n\nKGB\n\nCommittee of State Security (former USSR)\n\nCCP\n\nChinese Communist Party\n\nKP\n\nKnight of St Patrick\n\nCERN\n\nConseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire\n\nKT\n\nKnight of the Thistle\n\nCH\n\nCompanion of Honour\n\nMEP\n\nMember of the European Parliament\n\nCIA\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency\n\nMIT\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nCNRS\n\nCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique\n\nMP\n\nMember of Parliament\n\nNASA\n\nCPSU\n\nCommunist Party of the Soviet Union\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nDFC\n\nDistinguished Flying Cross\n\nNATO\n\nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization\n\nDSO\n\nDistinguished Service Order\n\nOM\n\nOrder of Merit\n\nEC\n\nEuropean Community\n\nPC\n\nPrivy Counsellor\n\nEU\n\nEuropean Union\n\nRA\n\nRoyal Academician, London\n\nFAA\n\nFellow of the Australian Academy of Science\n\nRAF\n\nRoyal Air Force\n\nSDP\n\nSocial Democratic Party\n\nFBA\n\nFellow of the British Academy\n\nSI\n\nFBI\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\n\nInternational System of Units (Système international d’unités)\n\nFRCP\n\nFellow of the Royal College of Physicians\n\nSPD\n\nSozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\n\nUK\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nFRS\n\nFellow of the Royal Society\n\nUN\n\nUnited Nations\n\nFRSA\n\nFellow of the Royal Society of Arts\n\nGBE/ KBE/ DBE/ CBE\n\nGrand Cross/Knight Commander/ Dame Commander/Companion of the Order of the British Empire\n\nGCB/ KCB/CB\n\nGrand Cross/Knight Commander/ Companion of the Order of the Bath\n\nGCMG/ KCMG/ DCMG/ CMG\n\nGrand Cross/Knight Commander/ Dame Commander/Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George\n\nUNESCO United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization US(A)\n\nUnited States (of America)\n\nUSSR\n\nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics\n\nVC\n\nVictoria Cross\n\nWHO\n\nWorld Health Organization\n\nvii\n\nIntroduction For more than 60 years I have worked in short bursts on my magnum opus, the Dictionary of World Biography (DWB). It demonstrates my preoccupation, even obsession, about making sense of the world to myself and sharing those insights with others. The work, inevitably, is highly personal, even semi-autobiographical, projecting my involvement in politics, teaching history, extensive travel, and absorption in music, literature, the arts, religion, philosophy, ethics, and decades of work with a disaster relief organisation and campaigns to reduce blindness. As a student in 1950, I was profoundly influenced by the great philosopher Bertrand Russell, and observed him in Melbourne at close quarters. He said: ‘Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind’. I set out the convolvulated history of the Dictionary of World Biography in my autobiography A Thinking Reed (Allen and Unwin, 2006). A variant of the text appeared as the Introduction in six editions of the DWB published by ANU Press 2014–19. ‘True Biographies of Nations?’ (edited by Karen Fox, ANU Press, 2019), a collection of papers presented at a seminar in Canberra in July 2016 about dictionaries of biography generally, includes my own contribution, ‘Writing a Dictionary of World Biography’. This Introduction draws from all three sources. In the mid-1950s I had been puzzled that no comprehensive biographical dictionary was available in paperback at a modest price. I determined to fill the gap. As a university law student I had been concerned that so many contemporaries had either a sketchy, or nonexistent, grasp of recent political history, let alone familiarity with great composers, philosophers or discoverers in other disciplines, such as medicine. References to my heroes Bertrand Russell, Albert Schweitzer or Albert Einstein drew a blank. Important and controversial Australians, such as Billy Hughes, John Thomas Lang or Percy Grainger, were forgotten, or had never been known. I was trying to pursue the concept of ‘the abundant life’ and I felt pained that so many had no access to the unfamiliar. If they knew nothing of Bach or Michelangelo, they were missing something significant. I always planned that my DWB would be more than a collected list of names, dates and places. I intended to provide a hook, something to encourage readers to pursue the subject – in effect, sharing my enthusiasms. In comparison to national dictionaries of biography, my attempt has been an overview, analogous to what H. G. Wells had attempted, if that does not sound too pretentious, admittedly limited by my lack of expertise in some areas and remoteness from primary sources, but fortified by the (small c) creator’s knowledge and experience. While I was teaching history and literature at Dandenong High School, I typed away furiously on my old Olivetti. I retain three bound volumes of my first draft bearing the final date of 5 May 1959, when I was only 26. ix\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\nThe text runs to 837 foolscap pages, with about 430,000 words and 6,000 entries. Amendments and new entries over the next 20 years were pasted in. Some of the original text survives in later, much expanded, editions, now about double in length. I always intended to include entries on the living in my DWB. When I finished my first draft in 1959, while Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo, Franklin Roosevelt and Josef Stalin were dead, Churchill, de Gaulle, Chiang, Eisenhower, MacArthur, Tito and Zhukov were still alive. It would have given a very lopsided account of World War II and the post-war world to have eliminated the quick in favour of the dead. I was confident, perhaps overconfident, about the quality of my research. I had sent drafts to many subjects, inviting comments, and received valuable information from E. M. Forster, P. G. Wodehouse, Ezra Pound, Oskar Kokoschka, Vladimir Nabokov, Graham Greene, Iris Murdoch, Noam Chomsky and John Updike. Igor Stravinsky wrote: ‘Glad you corrected all those absurd inventions of my so called “biographers” and, not critical, but critinitical [sic] reviews in musical periodicals you mention … Thanking you very much for all these corrections.’ Obsessed about correcting error, I did not necessarily accept everything that my subjects told me. My approach was opinionated and subjective. I set my entries in the broad sweep of history, pointed to relationships between major characters and their times, and challenged errors in other reference books. I was making judgements all the time. I included cross references (*) and a bibliography to encourage discursive reading. Apart from teaching, my long period on the television quiz show Pick-a-Box had just begun. Eisenhower, Khrushchev, Mao, de Gaulle, Macmillan and Menzies held office and (other than me) only Queen Elizabeth II is a link with that bygone era. I wrote to Penguin Books in Harmondsworth, London, and received a thoughtful and encouraging letter from the then general editor A. S. B. Glover, a tattooed Buddhist with a photographic memory. In January 1961, I took my first draft to London and arranged a meeting with Penguin Books. Charles Clarke, a senior editor, began by reviewing my entry on the psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung, and this impressed him enough to offer me a contract and a generous advance. Unfortunately, soon after the contract was signed, Clarke left Penguin for the Tavistock Institute, and years of uncertainty and confusion followed. There were deep divisions within Penguin Books, and very strong differences of opinion about whether they should be publishing general reference books at all. Glover left too. After the departure of Glover and Clarke, the project drifted for years. There was obvious concern about the credibility of a young antipodean author, of whom they knew nothing. I was then advised that M. Vibart Dixon, a former editor-in-chief of Chambers’s Encyclopedia, had been brought in to edit my material. Oddly, I never met, spoke to or corresponded with him. He died in 1967. An attempt to break up the text and send it off to specialist editors ended in high farce. In 1969 I received the first page proofs only to find that many entries in the letters B (Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz, Boulez, Brahms, Britten, Bruckner, Byrd) and H (Händel, Haydn,\n\nx\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\nHeine, Hemingway, Herodotus, Holbein, Homer, Horace, Victor Hugo, Jan Hus) had gone missing. Confucius and Goya had dropped out too. After a blazing row, Penguin pulled the plug and after more years of delay offered a handsome cash settlement in 1977. After another hiatus there came an unexpected invitation for the work to be published by Macmillan in London. The offer had been arranged by M. Vibart Dixon’s son. Dixon, a committed Anglophile and empire loyalist, had weeded out many of my non-British entries and presumably was responsible for the dropped out entries. Despite my reservations, I weakly agreed to the offer, anxious to see my work in print, even if it meant sharing royalties (and credit) with Dixon’s family. Then another fiasco. Despite promises that I would see the final proofs to ensure that missing entries were inserted, the work went to printers and binders without material on hundreds of subjects, including George Bush Sr, then US Vice President, Hua Guofeng, China’s head of state, François Mitterrand, France’s President and two Australian stars, Patrick White and Gough Whitlam. The volume was published in London in October 1981 as Macmillan Dictionary of Biography by Barry Jones and M. V. Dixon. A biographical note on the authors read ‘Dixon’s work on the Macmillan Dictionary of Biography was completed before he died in 1967’. This seemed to be self-evident. I protested vigorously. The work received a generous review in the Times Literary Supplement by Sir William Haley, former editor of Encyclopedia Britannica, to which I responded angrily. I wrote a sharp attack on the bungled project, which appeared in Private Eye. The Rutledge Dictionary of People by Barry Jones and M. V. Dixon, published in New York in 1981, was news to me, as was the St Martin’s Press Dictionary of Biography (New York, 1986). Through Brian Stonier, Macmillan Publishers Australia took over the rights from London and published three editions to my satisfaction. In 1994, Michael Wilkinson of Information Australia, Melbourne, published a much expanded edition, renamed Dictionary of World Biography, dropping M. V. Dixon as co‑author, launched jointly by former prime ministers Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser. Further editions followed in 1996 and 1998, the last copublished with The Age. I revised interminably, especially after discussions with people such as Isaiah Berlin, Francis Crick, James Watson, Peter Medawar, Max Perutz, Peter Doherty, Michael Tippett, Karl Popper, Henry Moore, Sidney Nolan, David Hockney, Patrick White, John Coetzee, Ernst Gombrich and Benoît Mandelbrot. Then, after 1998 came a long hiatus, when multi-volume or single-volume reference books such as Encyclopaedia Britannica or the Columbia Encyclopedia were going out of print because of the availability of millions of entries on Wikipedia. In 2011, Garry Sturgess conducted a long series of interviews with me for the National Library of Australia’s oral history project. He was an enthusiast for the DWB and helped to persuade the National Centre of Biography at The Australian National University (ANU), xi\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\nwhich does the editorial work for the Australian Dictionary of Biography (ADB), to exhume, update and revise my obsession. He worked for years on a documentary film, Barry Jones: In Search of Lost Time (2018), which won him a PhD from ANU. At ANU, Melanie Nolan and Tom Griffiths were enthusiasts and encouragers and proposed that the DWB appear both as an ebook and in traditional printed form. Gareth Evans, ANU Chancellor at the time, was a benign influence. After decades of frustration, working on the project with Michael Wilkinson and then the ANU team proved to be stimulating, enjoyable and productive. In 2014 ANU E Press produced the work, revised and rewritten again, in paperback and online. Michael Wilkinson published a handsome hard-cover version in 2016 in conjunction with ANU Press. Inevitably, my work is semi-autobiographical, reflecting my own experience, understanding, attempts to grasp a world view, dealing with diversity and trying to neutralise prejudice. I was always a very rapid and – more important – efficient reader, and over the decades I have consumed thousands of books, including novels, biographies, plays and poetry, as well as being an assiduous visitor to art galleries and museums, a modest collector of artworks and archaeology, and a concert hall habitué. Travel was also a very important factor. In Paris in May 1958, I had witnessed the collapse of the Fourth French Republic, and this, followed by years commuting to France as Australia’s representative to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO: 1991–95) and the World Heritage Committee (1995–96), fuelled my interest in French history, especially the French Revolution, art, music, politics, science and architecture. I have visited France more than 40 times. My obsessions included revolutionary and political history, Montaigne and Pascal, Debussy and Ravel, Proust, films, churches and cathedrals, Cavaillé-Coll organs, menhirs and dolmens in Brittany, and prehistoric cave art in the Dordogne. Entries on de Gaulle, Mitterrand, Chirac and Macron, Simone Veil and Viollet-le-Duc have been enlarged as I better understand complexities. It was inevitable that there would be some bias in entry selection towards the twentieth and twenty-first centuries – the lifetime of my readers, reflecting their desire for information to understand the context of how we live now, the impact on politics, revolutions, ideology, technology, science, World Wars I and II, the Cold War, literature, art, film, music and the media. Of my 30 longest entries, 11 subjects were active in the twentieth or twenty-first centuries. I have made some attempts to write about The Beatles, who have had (I am told) a continuing influence. Despite my long, and increasingly unhappy, career in politics, I tried to be clinically detached in my entries on public figures, and would immodestly point to entries on Harold Macmillan, Margaret Thatcher and Richard Nixon. However, I have not disguised my loathing of totalitarian systems, whether Left or Right, and entries on Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini and Mao are obvious examples. I felt that my explanation of ideologies was a strength and over many years I have tried to cover my areas of weakness, such as sport, popular music, ballet, ornithology, gardening and fourteenth-century Islamic tiles.\n\nxii\n\nI was exhilarated by the challenge to rethink and rewrite my positions on great historical figures after many years of deep reading, travel and reflection. Time in Egypt, Spain, Turkey, Brazil, Peru and Cambodia led to fresh insights, major revisions and expansions of many\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\nentries – for example, Tutankhamun, Dilma Roussef, Fujimori and Pol Pot. Visits to Rome in 2013 and 2014, followed by reading Mary Beard’s SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome (London: Profile, 2015), fed my obsessions about the Caesars, the papacy, early church architecture and Caravaggio, resulting in significant revision and expansion of many entries. Similarly, nine days in Iran in 2015 led to a reconsideration of Ferdowsi, Hāfez, Sa’di, Rumi, Omar Khayyam, al Ghazāli and the Shi’ite/Sunni schism. Time in Bourges, Chinon, Blois and Canterbury led to rethinking about Jacques Coeur and early capitalism, Eleanor of Aquitaine, the Dukes of Guise, Thomas Becket and Geoffrey Chaucer. Access to Nobel Prize archives provided insight into the selection (and rejection) process. I drew attention to contemporary recognition, or lack of it. In the entry on James Joyce, I pointed to the long list of great writers who had failed to win the Nobel Prize for Literature: Ibsen, Tolstoy, Strindberg, James, Hardy, Conrad, Gorki, Proust, Rilke, Musil, Joyce, Woolf, Pound, Borges, Malraux, Greene and Auden. Writing The Shock of Recognition: The books and music that have inspired me (Allen and Unwin, 2016) forced me to rethink the achievements of Homer, Dante, Chaucer, Montaigne, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Johnson, Gibbon, Sterne, Dickens, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Proust, Joyce, Beckett, Kafka, White and Coetzee, Bach, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Wagner, Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky and Shostakovich. This, inevitably, led to extensive revision, or indeed recomposition, of many entries in the DWB. The latest edition of the DWB (2019) has the equivalent of 940 full pages of text, more than 8,500 entries and 910,000 words. Four factors determined entry length: likelihood that the entries would be frequently consulted, availability of resource material, degree of influence that the subjects had on how we live (language, inventions, medicine, war, nutrition, religion, philosophy, information, exploration, entertainment, the arts and so on), and the extent of cross-referencing to other subjects in the DWB. Of the 30 longest entries, 10 are of English-speaking subjects (Shakespeare, Franklin Roosevelt, Lincoln, Churchill, Joyce, Dickens, Ford, Oliver Cromwell, Washington, Margaret Thatcher), seven German (Wagner, Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, Hitler, Goethe, Marx), three Italian (Michelangelo, Dante, Columbus), two each are French (Napoléon, Proust), Russian (Tolstoy, Stalin) and Spanish (Picasso, Cervantes), and one each are Greek (Homer), Aramaic (Jesus), Chinese (Mao) and Hindi (Gandhi). Nine are writers, 12 political leaders, four composers, two artists and one each are religious (Jesus), political philosopher (Marx) and manufacturer (Ford). It is a matter for regret that only Jesus, Mao, Gandhi and possibly Homer were not of European ancestry. That reflects the cultural biases that influence me and my potential readers. I try to compensate, but it is a formidable task. My Shakespeare entry, by far the longest, has 2,386 words, with 56 cross-references (indicated by *), emphasising his life, his sources, the context of his work in the times of Elizabeth I and James I, and his influence on later writers, and including a bibliography. Thirty-seven plays are referred to, but in context, not set out in tabular form.\n\nxiii\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\nIn recent editions I have made significant changes in the names for subjects, moving away from or adding to the familiar Anglophone versions (Philip > Felipe > Philippe) to the spelling in the original language, or the nearest equivalent, for example Samuel (Shmu’el), or Jinnah, Muhammad Ali (originally Mahomedali Jinnabhai) or Yongle (‘perpetual happiness’: personal name Zhu Di). How tactful does an encyclopedist have to be in writing about living subjects? Publishing serious entries on the living may inhibit discussion of sensitive issues such as sexuality, mental and physical health, addictions and obsessions, or financial links, and much primary source material will be inaccessible or embargoed. Postponing treatment of subjects still living, and presumably not eager to be eligible, gives future biographers space and time to reflect instead of rushing to judgement. I had no such inhibition with my DWB and emphasised linkages between past and current subjects. Since turning 87, my writing and revision for the DWB has been stimulated by a sense of urgency, with time running out. Christine Fernon has been an exemplary editor and I am deeply grateful for her skills, resourcefulness, good humour, erudition (despite the odd lapse) and patience over seven years. When I refer to the DWB as ‘our book’, I mean it. Barry O. Jones\n\nxiv\n\nA Aalto, (Hugo) Alvar (Henrick) (1898–1976). Finnish architect and designer. He set up practice in 1923 in central Finland, moving to Turku in 1927, then to Helsinki in 1933, collaborating with his wife Aino Marsio (1894–1949). He gained a national reputation with the Viipuri Municipal Library (1930– 35), destroyed in World War II, and an international one with his Finnish pavilions at the World’s Fairs at Paris (1937) and New York (1939–40). He made imaginative use of wood with brickwork, glass, copper and cement and also developed functional plywood furniture, mass-produced in his own factory. His range of commissions, including the Maison Carré in Paris, Baker House in Cambridge, Mass., and the Finlandia Concert Hall, Helsinki, was extensive: factories, museums, churches, theatres, department stores, private houses and public housing. He was professor of architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 1945–49. Aaron (c.14th–13th centuries BCE). Hebrew High Priest. In the Bible story, with his brother *Moses, he led the Israelites from Egypt to Canaan (Palestine) and became their first high priest, but while Moses was receiving the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai he made a golden calf for the people to worship (Exodus xxiii). Abbado, Claudio (1933–2014). Italian conductor, born in Milan. He was principal conductor of La Scala, Milan 1971–86, the London Symphony Orchestra 1979–88, the Vienna State Opera 1986–91 and succeeded von *Karajan at the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra 1990–2002. He won many awards for his recordings. Abbas (566–653). Arab merchant.

Ottoman khedive of Egypt 1892–1914. He supported the nationalist and Pan-Islamic cause and clashed with the British de facto rulers *Cromer and *Kitchener.

Exiled to Switzerland, he died in Geneva. Abbas, Ferhat (1899–1985). Algerian politician. Trained as a pharmacist, he founded the Algerian Popular Union in 1938 and in 1943 sought political concessions from the Allied authorities who rejected his moderate demands and jailed him. In 1956, in Cairo, he became leader of the Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN) and was first president of the provisional government of the Algerian Republic 1958–63 until displaced by his rival Ahmed *Ben Bella and imprisoned 1963–64.

In the September 2013 election the Liberal-National Party Coalition won a commanding victory and he became Prime Minister 2013–15. His pugilistic style, highly effective in opposition, proved counter-productive in government, and he was defeated by Malcolm *Turnbull in a party room ballot in September 2015. He campaigned passionately against recognition of same-sex marriage and against effective action to combat climate change and played a major role in forcing Turnbull from the prime ministership (August 2018). Abboud, (El-Ferik) Ibrahim (1900–1983). Sudanese soldier and political leader. His military service was mostly spent with the Sudan Defence Force, serving with the Allies in World War II.

He fought against the Fatimid (Muslim) dynasty and the Christian rulers of Leon and Navarre, capturing Seville (913) and Toledo (933). He promoted toleration for Christians and Jews and his reign was the golden age of Andalusian civilisation in architecture, the arts, education and science. From 936 he built the great palace Medinat al-Zahra, near Córdoba. Abd el-Krim, Mohammed (1882–1963). Moroccan nationalist leader. A Berber, he was a teacher, editor and judge who organised the first liberation movement in North Africa against French and Spanish rule.

Exiled to the island of Reunion 1926–47, he went to Egypt to head the Maghrib Bureau and died in Cairo. He was a major influence not only on African nationalists but also on *Ho Chi Minh. Furneaux, R., Abdel Krim: Emir of the Rif. 1967. Abdulhamid II (1842–1918). Ottoman sultan and caliph 1876–1909. Son of Abdulmecid I (1823– 1861), he was brought to power after the mental collapse of his brother Murad V (1840–1904) and appeared at first to be sympathetic to reform. He ruled as an absolute monarch from 1878. He lost Romania, Bulgaria and parts of Serbia and Bosnia after the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78), was known as ‘the Red’ or ‘the Damned’ in Europe after the massacre of 200,000 Armenians (1894–95) and went to war with Greece (1896–97) over Cyprus. He used Germans to train his army and encouraged the completion of the Berlin to Baghdad railway. He encouraged PanIslamism as a counterbalance to Western influences and became obsessed with the fear of assassination. Deposed by the Young Turks, he was succeeded by his brother *Mehmed V and held as a prisoner in Istanbul until his death. 2\n\nAbdullah I (Abdullah bin al-Hussein) (1882–1951). King of Jordan 1949–51, formerly Emir 1921–46 and King 1946–49 of Transjordan. Born in Mecca, son of *Hussein, later King of the Hejaz, with the rest of his Hashemite family he actively supported Britain in World War I in bringing down the Ottoman Empire. Designated as king of the newly created Iraq in 1920, he declined the throne; it was taken up by his brother *Faisal, who had been rejected in Syria. Abdullah took control of the Emirate of Transjordan instead, working closely with the British in Palestine, and showing some willingness to co-operate with Jewish settlement. The Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan became fully independent in 1946 and was renamed as Jordan in 1949. On the creation of Israel (1948) and the partitioning of Palestine, Abdullah annexed the West Bank for Jordan and was assassinated by a Palestinian nationalist. His greatgrandson Abdullah II (1962– ) succeeded *Hussein as king in 1999. Abdul Rahman Putra, Tunku (1903–1990). Malayan prince (Tunku) and politician. Educated at Cambridge University, he was called to the bar, and joined the public prosecutor’s department of his state of Kedah in 1949. In 1952 he was nominated to the federal executive and legislative councils, became Chief Minister (1955) and then first Prime Minister 1957–70 of the Malayan Federation (renamed Malaysia in 1963). Signapore was pushed out of the federation in 1964 and Sabah (British North Borneo) and Sarawak added. The UK awarded him a CH (1961) and Australia an AC (1987). Abe Shinzō (1954– ). Japanese politician, born in Nagato. Member of a political dynasty and grandson of *Kishi Nobusuku, he studied at Seikei University and in California.

In 2013 the LDP won a majority in the upper house as well. Abe was an economic interventionist and rightwing nationalist who argued a revisionist position about Japan’s role in World War II. His ‘apology’ for wartime excesses, given on the 70th anniversary of the Japanese surrender (August 2015) was regarded as grossly inadequate by China and the Republic of Korea. Abelard, Pierre [Peter in English usage] (1079– 1142). French philosopher and theologian. Of a noble Breton family, he became a lecturer in Paris. He seduced and married a 17-year-old pupil, *Héloïse, whose uncle, Fulbert, canon of Notre Dame, eventually had him castrated. She became a nun and he a monk. Later his retreat at Nogent-surSeine, known as Le Paraclet, was visited by scores of disciples. Convicted of heresy, he was eventually absolved by the pope. His own account of his life and\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\nhis correspondence with Héloïse have perpetuated one of the most famous love stories of the world. In 1817 the two were laid together in one tomb in the Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris. His contribution to the philosophical problem of universals was that a general word (e.g. ‘pink’) does not have meaning by standing for a single quality (e.g. pinkness) that somehow exists, but rather by being tied to a mental concept we acquire by noticing similarities between different things (e.g. pink ones). He extolled the use of reason in religion while giving a place to faith. One of his best known works is Sic et non (Yes and No), which revealed the contradictions in the works of the early Christian Fathers. Gibson, E., Héloïse and Abelard. 1953. Abercrombie, Sir (Leslie) Patrick (1879–1957). British town planner. He first practised as an architect in Manchester and was professor of civil design at Liverpool 1915–35. During these years, plans for preserving Stratford-on-Avon and other English towns made him well known. He was professor of town planning at University College, London 1935–46, and the ‘Greater London Plan’ 1943 was his major achievement. Abercromby, Sir Ralph (1734–1801). Scottish soldier. After being trained for the law he was commissioned in the 3rd Dragoon Guards in 1756, and fought with distinction in the Seven Years War and the French wars at the close of the century. He was knighted in 1795 and, as leader of the West Indies campaign which immediately followed, received fresh acclaim. While Commander-in-Chief of British forces in the Mediterranean he made (June 1801) a successful chief of landing at Aboukir Bay, Alexandria. The French counter-attack was repulsed but Abercromby died of wounds. Aberdeen, 4th Earl of, George Hamilton-Gordon (1784–1860). Scottish Peelite-Whig politician, born in Edinburgh. His family owned large estates, his parents died early and he succeeded his grandfather as earl in 1801. Educated at Harrow and Cambridge, he had a passion for the classics and archaeology. Originally a diplomat and a successful negotiator, as a youthful Ambassador to Vienna 1813–14 he organised the final coalition against *Napoléon and felt haunted by war. Originally a Tory, he was Foreign Secretary 1828–30 and again under *Peel 1841–46. He broke with the Conservatives over the Corn Laws and became leader of the Peelite faction in 1850. Prime Minister 1852–55, he led a coalition between the Whigs and his own minority group. He cultivated good relations with the United States. He took Britain, reluctantly, into the Crimean War 1853–56 and military failure, coupled with internal tensions between *Palmerston and Russell, enfeebled his government and he was happy to resign. *Gladstone regarded him as ‘lovable’, a sentiment not widely shared: *Disraeli detested him.\n\nAberhart, William (1878–1943). Canadian politician. Originally a clergyman, then a schoolteacher, he became Premier of Alberta 1935– 43 and attempted to implement in Canada the Social Credit policies of Major C. H. *Douglas. His scope of action was limited by the overriding authority of the Federal Government. Abraham (Abram) (c.2100–2000 BCE). Hebrew patriarch, born in Ur of the Chaldees (Mesopotamia). According to the biblical account (Genesis xi:26ff), by his wife Sarah (Sarai) he was ancestor of the Israelites, through *Isaac. The Qu’ran (Koran) claims him as progenitor of the Arabs by his wife Hagar (through his son Ishmael: *Muhammad was a descendant). Genesis describes how Abraham, at the call of God, migrated with Sarah his wife and his whole household to Canaan (Palestine). His faith was tested when God commanded him to sacrifice his son Isaac. Only at the last moment, he was told to substitute a ram. According to tradition he died, and was buried, in Hebron. Abu-Bakr (Abdullah ibn Abi Quhaafah) (c.573–634). First caliph of Islam 632–34. Born to a merchant tribe in Mecca, he became the first male convert to Islam and *Muhammad’s chief adviser in Medina (622–32). His daughter A’ishah (Ayesha) became one of Muhammad’s wives. On his son-in-law’s death he assumed leadership of Islam as khalifa (‘deputy or successor’). His claim was disputed by Muhammad’s son-in-law *Ali, whose followers became known as Shi’ites. He was succeeded as caliph by *Umar. The first four caliphs, known as ‘Rashidun’ (‘rightly guided’), were chosen by consensus among the imams. Achebe, Chinua (1930–2013). Nigerian novelist, poet and critic. His Things Fall Apart (1958) was the biggest selling novel by an African writer: 10 million copies in 50 languages. He won the Man Booker Prize in 2007. Acheson, Dean Gooderham (1893–1971). American lawyer, born in Connecticut. Educated at Yale and Harvard, he was a law clerk to Justice *Brandeis and became an attorney in 1921. Undersecretary of the US Treasury 1933, he resigned over a matter of principle, worked as an international lawyer in Washington, then went to the State Department as Assistant Secretary 1941–45 and Undersecretary 1945–47. He formulated the *Truman Doctrine (1947), in which US aid was offered to countries under threat from the USSR. He was a major architect of the *Marshall Plan (1947) which provided support for the rebuilding of Western Europe. As Truman’s Secretary of State 1949–53, despite his hard line in the Cold War in organising NATO (1949), he was attacked as a Communist sympathiser after *Mao’s victory in China and the onset of the Korean War. Memoirs of his years at the State Department, Present at the Creation (1970), won the Pulitzer Prize for history.

English historian, born in Naples. Grandson of a former prime minister of the Kingdom of Naples, he was brought up in the household of the 2nd Earl Granville, who married his widowed mother, and studied in Munich where he acquired his mastery of historical method. He was a Liberal MP 1859–65 but reached his greatest fame as professor of modern history at Cambridge 1895– 1902, where he planned the original Cambridge Modern History. Though a Roman Catholic, his liberalism made him strongly oppose the dogma of papal infallibility (1870). He coined the maxim (1887): ‘Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.’ Mathew, D., Lord Acton and His Times. 1968; Mathew, D., Acton: The Formative Years. 1972; Chadwick, O., Acton and History. 2002. Adam, Adolphe Charles (1803–1856). French composer. A professor at the Paris Conservatoire from 1848, his best known work is the ballet Giselle (1841), but he also wrote popular operas, now forgotten, for the Opera-Comique. Adam, Robert (1728–1792). Scottish architect, born in Kirkcaldy. Brought up on the family estate in Kinross-shire, in 1754 he was sent by his father (himself an architect of distinction in the Palladian tradition) to Italy, where, without neglecting the Renaissance masters, he made a special study of the antiquities of Rome, Pompeii and Herculaneum. Across the Adriatic the ruins of *Diocletian’s palace at Spalato (Split), much more complete than they are today, provided a theme for a book, fully illustrated by his own drawings; published in 1764. In 1760 he set up in practice in London with his younger brother James Adam (1730–1794) who acted mostly as his assistant. Out of his studies gradually emerged the so-called Adam style, based on the principle that exterior, interior and furnishings should form a harmonious whole. Details were largely elegant adaptations of Roman and Greek models. They designed and built the Adelphi (i.e. the brothers) Terrace (1768–72), an unfortunate financial speculation but an artistic triumph which was destroyed and replaced in 1936– 38. Outstanding among the many Adam country houses are Harewood in Yorkshire, Kedleston in Derbyshire, Syon and Osterley near London. The famous town houses were a later phase. Robert, unmarried, a Member of Parliament 1768–74, elected FRS, was buried in Westminster Abbey. Adams, Ansel Easton (1902–1984). American photographer. His richly textured, stark images of landscape, especially national parks in California and the southwest, established his reputation. He helped to secure recognition of photography as an academic subject and wrote technical manuals. 4\n\nAdams, Gerry (Irish: Gearóid Mac Ádhaimh) (1948– ). Irish politician, born in Belfast. An active civil rights campaigner in Northern Ireland, he was interned 1971–76, and worked with the Provisional wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), but insisted that he was not a member. President of Sinn Féin 1983–2018, he was an abstentionist MP 1983– 92; 1997–2011 in the UK House of Commons. He supported an end to terrorism after 1994, was a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly 1998– 2010, then transferred to the Dail Éireann 2011– . Adams, Sir Grantley Herbert (1898–1971). Barbadan Labour politician. Educated at Oxford University, he became a successful lawyer (and cricketer) in Barbados. He was premier of Barbados 1954–58 and the first and only Prime Minister of the West Indies Federation 1958–62. Adams, Henry (Brooks) (1838–1918). American historian, born in Boston. Grandson of John Quincy *Adams and son of Charles Francis Adams (1807– 1886), he was educated at Harvard and travelled extensively in Europe. His father became US Minister to Great Britain 1861–68 and Henry served as his private secretary throughout, returning to the US to find that his services and knowledge were rebuffed in *Grant’s Washington. He taught history at Harvard 1870–77 and edited the North American Review 1870–76. He moved to Washington, opposite the White House, and there wrote his great History of the USA. During the Administrations of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison (9 volumes, 1889–91), which set new standards in documentation and was published at his own expense. Lesser historical work followed, but in later life Adams turned to general literature, having already written Democracy (1880), a slashing satirical novel of Washington society. He toured the world (including Polynesia and Australia) with John *Hay 1890–92. Living in France in 1897, he became anti-Semitic and anti-Dreyfusard. Mont-Saint-Michel and Chartres (privately published 1904, commercially 1913) is a study of the unifying forces of medievalism symbolised by these great buildings. The Education of Henry Adams, (privately published 1907, commercially 1918), is an ironic and deeply pessimistic autobiography, written in the third person, which speculates about the disintegrative forces of modern life. The Education posthumously won the Pulitzer Prize (1919).

C., The Mind and Art of Henry Adams. 1957. Adams, John (1735–1826). 2nd President of the US 1797–1801. Born in Braintree (Quincy), Massachusetts, and educated at Harvard College, he was cousin of Samuel *Adams. He became a leading lawyer and politically a strong supporter of the colonial\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\ncause, relying upon the argument ‘No taxation without representation’. However, he revealed his fairness by defending British soldiers who had fired upon and killed some of a group of Boston citizens who had been baiting a sentry. He was prominent in the continental congresses, and signed the Declaration of Independence (1776) which he had helped to draft. He was appointed diplomatic representative to France (1778) and Holland (1781) and with *Franklin and *Jay negotiated the treaty of Versailles (1783), which brought the War of Independence to an end. After serving as the first US minister to Great Britain 1785–88, he returned home, and as a leading member of *Washington’s Federalist Party he became the first vice president of the US 1789–97, bewailing the lack of power of ‘this most insignificant office’. When Washington announced his retirement in 1796 he was elected President of the US, narrowly defeating *Jefferson in the first contested poll but lost to Jefferson in the 1800 election. He returned to his home at Quincy, wrote several books analysing the machinery of American Government, and died on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence on the same day as Jefferson. Dying at 90 years 8 months, he was the longest lived US President until Ronald *Reagan. McCullough, D., John Adams. 2001. Adams, John (Coolidge) (1947– ). American composer, born in Massachusetts. A clarinettist, he studied composition at Harvard with Roger Sessions and Leon Kirchner, taught composition himself at the San Francisco Conservatory 1971–81 and was composer in residence with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra 1982–85. His works include Shaker Loops (originally a string septet 1978, set for orchestra 1983), Grand Pianola Music (1982), Harmonium for large orchestra and chorus (*Donne and *Dickinson, 1984), the successful opera Nixon in China (1987), the song cycles Fearful Symmetries (*Blake, 1988) and The Wound-Dresser (*Whitman, 1989). The opera The Death of Klinghoffer was premiered in 1991. Later works include Violin Concerto (1993), On the Transmigration of Souls (choral, 2002), Dr Atomic (opera, 2005), The Gospel According to the Other Mary (opera-oratorio, 2013), Scheherezade.2 (dramatic symphony, 2014) and Girls of the Golden West (opera, 2017). He describes himself as a ‘post-style’ composer. Adams, John Couch (1819–1892). English astronomer and mathematician, born in Cornwall. Self-taught, then educated at Cambridge, in 1845 he predicted the existence of the planet Neptune from calculations on irregularities in the orbit of Uranus. Delay in publication resulted in his sharing credit for discovery of the planet with *Le Verrier who, working independently, presented similar calculations to the Académie française in 1846. Other notable work by Adams included researches on the moon’s motion. Awarded the Copley Medal in 1846, he was professor of astronomy at Cambridge from 1859–92.\n\nAdams, John Luther (1953– ). American composer, born in Mississippi. He played in rock bands, studied in California and lived in Alaska 1978– 2014. Enormously prolific and experimental, his works, profoundly influenced by the environment and a sense of place, include Become Ocean (2013), Ten Thousand Birds (2014) and Become Desert (2018). Adams, John Quincy (1767–1848). 6th President of the US 1825–29. Born in Braintree, eldest son of John *Adams, his natural precocity was increased by accompanying his father on diplomatic missions. At the age of 14 he was secretary to the American Ambassador in St Petersburg and at 16 to his father, Ambassador in Paris. He graduated at Harvard in 1787, started work as a lawyer, but was soon recalled to diplomacy as minister to Holland 1794–96, to Portugal 1796 and Prussia 1797–1801. US Senator from Massachusetts 1803–08, he supported *Jefferson on the Louisiana Purchase, disagreeing with the Federalist Party. Minister to Russia 1809–14, he was appointed a justice of the United States Supreme Court in 1811 but declined this office. He negotiated the peace treaty of Ghent with England in 1814, and was Minister to Great Britain 1815–17. As Secretary of State under President *Monroe 1817–25, he negotiated a treaty with Spain (1819) which added Texas, California and the Oregon Territory to the US, fixed the border with Canada and formulated the ‘Monroe Doctrine’ (1823). There were four major candidates in the 1824 presidential election: Andrew *Jackson, Adams, Henry *Clay and William Crawford (1772–1834). As no candidate had a majority in the Electoral College, with Clay’s support, Adams was elected by the House of Representatives. He imposed tariffs, promoted national infrastructure and encouraged education and science. Embittered by slander and defeat by Jackson in the presidential election of 1828, he retired to Quincy only to show his resilience by securing election to the House of Representatives. Here, from 1831 until his death he was known for his vehement attacks on slavery. In 1841 he argued before the Supreme Court to secure the freedom of slaves on the ship Amistad. The earliest surviving photograph of a US president was taken of Adams in 1843. Known as ‘Old Man Eloquent’, he died in the House after a vigorous speech. Lipsky, G.

He left school early, went into advertising, was central to the revival of the Australian feature film industry, produced 12 films and, from the 1980s, was an influential broadcaster, interviewing thousands of major figures and pursuing unpopular causes. He chaired the Commission for the Future 1985–90 and was a prodigious collector\n\n5\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\nof artefacts. Author of 20 books, he became a ‘living national treasure’. Minor planet 5133 Phillipadams was named for him in 1990. Adams, Sam(uel) (1722–1803). American politician, born in Boston. The first distinguished member of the Massachusetts family which played such an important part in American history, Adams squandered his inheritance, mismanaged his post as a tax collector, but showed great talent as a political agitator and fiery propagandist. By fomenting and publishing the grievances of the American colonists as a radical leader in the state House of Representatives, he played a decisive part in the contrivance of events, such as the Boston Tea Party (1773), that led to the Declaration of Independence, of which he was a signatory. Adams, William (1564–1620). English sailor. The first Englishman to settle in Japan (1600), he became the principal adviser on shipbuilding and trade: because of his usefulness he was not allowed to leave. He established a post there for the East India Company. Addams, Charles Samuel (1912–1988). American cartoonist. A regular contributor to the New Yorker from 1940, his black humour, often featuring a family of grotesques, was the basis for the television series ‘The Addams Family’ (1964–66) and a film (1991). Addams, Jane (1860–1935). American social reformer, born at Cedarville, Illinois. She founded (1889) the Hull House social settlement in Chicago and worked for female suffrage, social justice and the cause of peace. From 1916, she received 91 nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize, sharing it in 1931 with N. M. *Butler. Tims, M., Jane Addams of Hull House. 1961. Addington, Henry, 1st Viscount Sidmouth (1757–1844). English Tory politician. He entered parliament in 1784, was Speaker of the House of Commons 1789–1801 and Prime Minister during *Pitt’s temporary retirement 1801–04. The Treaty of Amiens 1802 with *Napoléon was a brief respite, but war broke out again in 1803. Pitt turned against him but after reconciliation took him into his own ministry. He received his peerage in 1805 and was almost continuously in office until 1824. As home secretary 1812–21 he was responsible for many repressive measures and incurred odium as a result of the ‘Peterloo Massacre’ of 1819. Minister without Portfolio 1821–24, his opposition to *Canning’s policy of recognising the independence of the Spanish colonies in South America led to his final retirement. He opposed Roman Catholic emancipation and parliamentary reform. Ziegler, P., Addington. 1962.\n\n6\n\nAddison, Joseph (1672–1719). English essayist. He was chiefly remembered as the founder of and chief contributor to the Spectator (first published 1711). A sickly, precocious child, he was educated at\n\nCharterhouse and Oxford. His poem The Campaign (1704), written to celebrate *Marlborough’s victory at Blenheim, won him a post as Commissioner of Excise. Similar posts maintained him in comfort for the rest of his life. He became the main contributor to the Tatler, founded (1709) by his boyhood friend Richard *Steele, who later joined him on the Spectator. The declared aim of both men was to ‘enliven morality with wit and to temper wit with morality’, and it is likely that the influence of both on English manners in the 18th century was more profound than the elegance and sober good sense the papers would suggest. Addison’s tragedy Cato (1713) was highly successful. Smithers, P., The Life of Joseph Addison. 1954. Addison, Thomas (1793–1860). English physician and pioneer endocrinologist. His early work was on the action of poisons on the human body, and in his Elements of the Practice of Medicine (1839) he printed an important account of appendicitis. But he is mostly remembered for his researches into the glands, and for his pioneering work on anaemia. On the basis of autopsies, he suggested in 1849 a connection between anaemia and diseases of the suprarenals. This work was extended in his book On the Constitutional and Local Effects of Disease of the Supra-Renal Capsules (1855), in which he identified ‘idiopathic’ anaemia (later known as Addisonian anaemia). He also identified what became known as ‘Addison’s disease’, a condition of the suprarenal capsules which produced weakness, a bronze pigmentation of the skin, and fatality in the patient. Singer, C. and Underwood, E. A. Short History of Medicine. 1962. Adelaide (1792–1849). British queen consort 1830–37. Daughter of the Duke of Saxe-CoburgMeiningen, she married (1818) the Duke of Clarence, later *William IV of Great Britain. The capital of South Australia is named after her. Hopkirk, M., Queen Adelaide. 1946. Adenauer, Konrad (1876–1967). German Christian Democratic politician, born in Cologne (Köln). Son of a civil servant, he was educated at the universities of Freiburg, Munich and Bonn, became a lawyer in 1900, a Cologne councillor in 1906 and Lord Mayor (Oberburgermeister) 1917–33 until removed by the Nazis. Imprisoned briefly 1933 and 1944, he was inactive in politics until the end of World War II. Lord Mayor again 1945, in 1946 he founded the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which although largely Catholic included Protestants and narrowly won the first post-war election of August 1949. He served as the first Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany 1949–63. At 73 his appointment was intended as provisional but ‘Der Alte’ kept hold until his unwilling retirement at the age of 87. He was also Foreign Minister 1951–55. His shrewdness and\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\nstubbornness won him respect inside Germany and he established friendship with *Churchill and *de Gaulle. He negotiated the Federal Republic’s entry into NATO, the Common Market and other international bodies and, with his successor Ludwig *Erhard, initiated Germany’s ‘economic miracle’. Adès, Thomas (1971– ). English composer, pianist and conductor. He studied at King’s College, Cambridge, with early successes paralleling Benjamin *Britten. His works include a piano quintet (2000) and an opera, The Tempest (2004). Adler, Alfred (1870–1937). American psychologist. He was an eye specialist before taking up psychiatry and working with *Freud, from whom he finally broke in 1911 (mainly because he disagreed with Freud’s undue emphasis on infantile sexuality), and established his own system. He stressed the link between hereditary physical defects and psychological states but is best known for the importance he ascribed to the will to dominate and its frustration. He coined the term ‘inferiority complex’. Bottome, P., Alfred Adler: Apostle of Freedom. 3rd ed. 1957. Adler, Felix (1851–1933). American sociologist, born in Germany. Son of a rabbi, he established the first child-study group and the first free kindergarten in the US. He was a pioneer of the Ethical Culture movement aimed at providing ethical and moral teaching outside the churches. Adler, Larry (1914–2001). American mouth organist. He toured constantly from the 1930s and commissioned works by *Vaughan Williams, *Milhaud and *Arnold. A political activist, he moved to England during the *McCarthy period. Adorno, Theodor W(iesengrund) (1903–1969). German philosopher and musicologist. He worked in the UK, US and Germany, attempting to explain modern music in the context of Marx and Freud and wrote extensively on *Mahler, *Schoenberg and *Berg. Adrian (Hadrianus) IV (Nicholas Breakspear) (c. 1100– 1159). Pope 1154–59. The only English pope, born near St Albans, he became a canon of a monastery at Avignon in France and was cardinal bishop of Albano in Italy (1146–54). As Pope he reasserted papal power (*Arnold of Brescia), crowned *Friedrich I (Barbarossa) Emperor in 1155, but later opposed him on the basis of his theories of papal supremacy. Adrian (Hadrianus) VI (Adriaan Florensz Boeyens) (1459–1523). Pope 1522–23. Born in Utrecht, he became a distinguished theologian. As tutor to the young Charles of Burgundy and the Low Countries (later King of Spain and emperor *Charles V), he attained political and ecclesiastical preferment. Inquisitor-General of Aragon in 1516, cardinal in\n\n1517, he became (1522) the last non-Italian pope until *John Paul II. Zeal for reform within the Church combined with opposition to all doctrinal change won him enemies both in Rome and among Luther’s adherents. Moreover his inability to prevent the Turkish seizure (1522) of Rhodes from the Knights of St John marked his political failure. Adrian, Edgar Douglas, 1st Baron Adrian (1889– 1977). English physiologist, born in London. He was educated at Westminster and Trinity College, Cambridge, and trained for medicine at St Bartholomew’s Hospital, London. Foulerton Research Professor at the Royal Society 1929–37, he discovered methods for measuring electrical signals in the nervous system and demonstrated the transmission, by nerve impulses, of sensation and muscular control. He shared the 1932 Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology with Sir Charles *Sherrington for their discoveries on the function of neurons. In Cambridge he became Professor of Physiology 1937–51, Master of Trinity College 1951–65 and Chancellor of the University 1967–75. Awarded the OM (1942), the Copley Medal (1946) and a peerage (1955), he was President of the Royal Society 1950–55. His later research was on the electrical activity of the brain itself. A.E. (pen name of George William Russell) see Russell, George William Ælfric of Eynsham (c.955–1010). Anglo-Saxon scholar and writer. The best known scholar of his time, and the most prolific writer in Old English, he wrote homilies, sermons, a colloquy between the teacher, the pupil and such characters as ploughman, hunter, etc., a paraphrase of the early books of the Old Testament and Lives of the Saints. Aeschines (389–314 BCE). Athenian orator. The great rival of *Demosthenes, the famous speech against Ctesiphon and only two others survive. He was important as chief spokesman of the party of appeasement in the face of the encroachments of *Philip II of Macedon and so delayed the resistance advocated by Demosthenes until too late. Aeschylus (c.525–456/5 BCE). Greek tragic dramatist, born near Athens. A member of an old noble family, he was a soldier who fought against Persia at Marathon (490), Salamis (480) and Plataea (479). Comparatively little is known of his life, except that he was popular in Athens, acted in his plays, was regarded as impious and made three long visits to Gela in Sicily, where he died. The earliest Greek tragedian, and, with *Sophocles and *Euripides, one of the three greatest, he was the first dramatist to present two characters on stage simultaneously (additional to the chorus). He also developed the use of dialogue, costumes, music and scenery. (In the Oresteia trilogy he first presented three characters on stage.) Of about 80 plays, only seven survive. He competed 7\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\nin the Dionysia, an annual drama competition, more than 20 times, winning 13 of them (losing once to Sophocles). The Persians deals with the historic struggle of the Greeks against *Xerxes, the remainder are inspired by ancient legends of gods and heroes. Comprising the great trilogy of The Oresteia are Agamemnon, telling of the King’s murder on his return from Troy by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover Aegisthus, The Choephoroe, in which Orestes and his sister Electra avenge their father, and The Eumenides, which relates the pursuit of Orestes by ‘Furies’, his trial and final acquittal by the goddess Athena. Other surviving plays are The Suppliants, Seven Against Thebes and Prometheus Unbound. All deal with the expiation of sin. Murray, G. G. A., Aeschylus the Creator of Tragedy. 1940. Aesop. Greek author of beast fables, probably legendary. He is supposed to have lived in the 6th century BCE but even his existence is uncertain. The first collection of Greek fables, now lost, was made in the 4th century BCE by Demetrius of Phaleron. A metrical collection by Babrius (probably 2nd century CE) contains the first Greek fables to survive. Clearly, the fables ascribed to Aesop originated in many countries and were the work of many hands. Æthelberht (or Ethelbert) (c.560–616). King of Kent 560–616. Overlord of southern England, he married a Christian, the Frankish princess Bertha. which facilitated his own conversion (597) by St *Augustine of Canterbury. This link with the Franks probably stimulated him to issue a code of laws, the first known to have been written down in England. Æthelred (or Ethelred) I (840–871). King of Wessex 865–71, brother and predecessor of *Alfred (Ælfræd) the Great. The brothers worked in perfect harmony in their efforts to keep the Danes at bay, and, though the devout king was still at his prayers when the Battle of Asldown (871) began, the Danes sustained their first decisive defeat. He died soon afterwards at Merton. Æthelred (or Ethelred) II (known as ‘the Unready’) (968–1016). King of England 987–1016. The son of *Edgar the Peaceful he succeeded his murdered halfbrother *Edward the Martyr. He was called ‘Unraed’ (lacking in counsel or good sense) because of his vacillating policy towards the Danes, sometimes bribing, sometimes fighting them. His reign was one of unrest and treachery to which he contributed, for example by a general massacre of Danes on St Brice’s Day 1002. The Danish leader, *Sweyn Forkbeard, responded with fierce reprisals, defeated Ethelred and compelled him to flee to the court of the Duke of Normandy, the brother of Emma, Ethelred’s second wife and mother of *Edward the Confessor. He returned to England in 1014. Roach, L., Æthelred the Unready. 2016. 8\n\nÆthelstan (or Athelstan) (c.895–939). King of the Anglo-Saxons 924–27, King of the English 927–39. Son of *Edward the Elder, and grandson of *Alfred the Great, he continued and extended their policy of unification by bringing the north of England and much of Wales under his rule. The marriages arranged for his sisters with the royal houses of France and Germany confirmed his position as one of the great medieval kings. He ruled England firmly but also addressed his efforts to the liberation of slaves, care of the destitute and improvement of the coinage. At the end of his reign (937) he defeated a confederacy of Scots, Welsh and Danes in a desperate encounter at Brunanburh (Bourne in Lincolnshire). Æthelwulf (d. 858). King of Wessex 839–58. Son of *Egbert and father of *Alfred the Great, he was pious, judicious and absentee, but kept the Vikings at bay. Aga Khan. Hereditary title held by the spiritual head of the Isma’ili (Shi’ite) Muslims, which claims descent from Fatimah, daughter of the prophet *Muhammad. The first Aga Khan, Hasum Ali Shah (1800–1881), fled from Persia to India, where his services to the British won him recognition and the title ‘His Highness’. His grandson, Aga Khan III (1877–1957), born in Karachi, succeeded his father as 48th Imam of the Nizari-Isma’ili Muslims in 1885, was educated at Eton and Cambridge. He became first President of the All-India Muslim League 1912. A moderate reformer, he advocated ending purdah, represented India at international conferences and at the League of Nations 1932–38, and was President of the League of Nations Assembly 1937–38. He gained notoriety as a racing enthusiast whose horses won the Derby five times. He was buried in Egypt. His grandson Shah Karim al-Hussaini, Aga Khan IV (1936– ) campaigned to relieve global poverty and advance women’s rights. Agassiz, (Jean) Louis (Rodolphe) (1807–1873). Swiss-American biologist, born in Switzerland. A pupil of *Cuvier and *Humboldt, he graduated in medicine (1830), worked in Paris and in 1832 accepted a professorship at Neuchâtel. His early work on fossil fishes was followed by a systematic study of glaciers. In 1846 he went to America and in 1848 became professor of natural history at Harvard, and became an influential, and much admired, teacher. A vigorous critic of *Darwin’s theories of natural selection and the origin of species, he proposed ‘polygenism’—the concept that human races had different origins. His ideas were used to provide a scientific justification for racism, unfairly, as Agassiz opposed slavery. A scientific expedition to Brazil 1865–66 led to the publication of A Journey in Brazil (1868). Only four volumes of his Contributions to the Natural History of the United States were issued before his death. His son Alexander Agassiz (1835–1910) who became curator of the Harvard Museum on his\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\nfather’s death. His son Alexander wrote much on oceanography, coral formations and the embryology of star fishes, etc.\n\nwas probably exaggerated—he was recalled by the jealous emperor *Domitian. His biography, written by his son-in-law *Tacitus, survives.\n\nMarcou, J., Life, Letters and Works of Louis Agassiz. 1972.\n\nAgrippa, Marcus Vipsanius (63–12 BCE). Roman engineer, architect, commander and governor. As governor of Gaul (39), he crossed the Rhine and began colonising Germany. A strong supporter of Octavian, later known as *Augustus, he destroyed the navy of Sextus *Pompeius off Sicily (36). From 33 he enlarged and expanded Rome’s water supply. His victory at Actium (31) over the fleets of *Antony and *Cleopatra enabled Octavian to become the undisputed master of Rome. Augustus’s daughter Julia became Agrippa’s third wife and their daughter *Agrippina continued the imperial line. His Pantheon (27–25 BCE), originally rectangular, was destroyed by fire in 80, rebuilt, first by *Domitian, then (126 CE) by *Hadrian, but Agrippa’s portico remains. He also developed the Campus Martius (24 BCE). The Pont du Gard, one of the greatest Roman aqueducts, originally regarded as Agrippa’s work, is now dated to 40–60 CE.\n\nAgesilaus (c.444–360 BCE). King of Sparta. Famous for his military skill, his early successes were against the Persians in Ionia, but it was in the long war against an alliance of the other Greek states that he won his most famous victory, that of Coronea (394). In the Theban war, though defeated by *Epaminondas at Mantinea (362), he maintained his country’s defence. Agnelli, Giovanni (1866–1945). Italian industrialist. Originally a soldier, in 1899 he founded FIAT (Fabbrica Italiana Automobili Torino) which became the biggest Italian car and weapons manufacturer. *Mussolini appointed him to the Senate in 1923 and he was a generous philanthropist. Agnew, Spiro Theodore (1918–1996). American Republican politician. Son of a Greek migrant (the family name was Anagnostopoulos), he served in the forces, then became a supermarket manager. County executive in Baltimore 1962–67, he had a meteoric rise to become Governor of Maryland 1967–69 and Richard *Nixon’s Vice President 1969– 73 and seemed a likely nominee for president in 1976. When the Justice Department prosecuted him for receiving ‘kickbacks’ from Maryland contractors, he pleaded ‘no contest’ in court, was fined, placed on probation and resigned (October 1973) as Vice President. He then joined an international real estate investment firm. Agoult, Marie Catherine Sophie de Flavigny, Comtesse d’ (1805–1876). French novelist. Her novel Nélida (1846), written under the pen name Daniel Stern, depicted her relations with the musician Franz Liszt. One of her daughters by *Liszt, Cosima, married Richard *Wagner. Agricola, Georgius (Georg Bauer) (1495–1555). German scholar. Trained as a humanist at Leipzig, and a friend of *Erasmus, he became a physician in the mining town of Joachimstal, Saxony (1527–33), and his close observation led to the writing of his great work De re metallica (1533–53), posthumously published in Venice. Regarded as the foundation of systematic metallurgy, it was translated into English by Lou and Herbert *Hoover (1913). Agricola, Gnaeus Julius (40–93 CE). Gallo-Roman soldier and administrator. Born to a senatorial family, Governor of Britannia (Britain) 78–85, he consolidated the Roman hold on Wales, pushed the frontier into Caledonia (Scotland), built a large fort at Inchtuthil (in modern Perthshire), and his fleet made the first circumnavigation of the British Isles since *Pytheas. Shortly after defeating the Caledonians at Mons Graupius (83)—although the scale of the battle\n\nAgrippa von Nettesheim, Heinrich Cornelius (1486–1535). German physician, theologian, philosopher and courtier, born in Cologne. Educated at his birthplace, he had a stormy career, became court physician and astrologer to *François I, and was jailed as a heretic. His major work De occulta philosophia (1531) attempted to link scientific knowledge with magic, the occult and cabbalistic tradition. The Faust legend owes much to his reputation. Agrippina (14 BCE–33 CE). Roman matron. Daughter of *Julia and *Agrippa, she became wife of Germanicus, nephew of *Augustus’s successor, *Tiberius, whom she wrongly blamed for her husband’s death. She died in exile. Of her children Gaius, nicknamed *Caligula, became emperor, her daughter, the younger Agrippina (15–59), was the mother of the emperor *Nero by her first husband and probably poisoned her third, the emperor *Claudius. Notorious for her cruelty and depravity, she was eventually put to death by her son Nero. Aguinaldo y Fama, Emilio (1869–1964). Filipino politician and insurgent. Born to a wealthy and influential family, he led guerrilla campaigns against the Spanish occupation, and, after invasion by US forces, became head of a revolutionary government 1898–99 and first President of the Philippines 1899– 1901, the first head of a constitutional republic in Asia. Aguinaldo designed the national flag. When the United States invaded and defeated the Spanish, establishing direct rule in 1901, the first Filipino Republic ended and Aguinaldo retired to private life. In 1935 he contested the first election for the Presidency of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, losing heavily to his former supporter Manuel *Quezon. In 1945 he was accused of collaboration with the Japanese occupation and was jailed.\n\n9\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\nAhab (d.c.853 BCE). King of Israel c.875–852 BCE. His confiscation of Naboth’s vineyard earned him the wrath of the prophet Elisha. His evil genius was his wife *Jezebel who persuaded him to introduce the worship of Baal. He was killed in battle with the Syrians by a man who ‘drew his bow at a venture’. See I Kings xvi:29–xxii:40. Ahasuerus. Biblical name of several Persian kings. The one who made *Esther his queen has been questionably identified with *Xerxes I (reigned 485– 464 BCE). The name Ahasuerus was also attributed to the legendary Wandering Jew. Ahern, Bertie (1951– ). Irish politician. He was Lord Mayor of Dublin 1986–87, Leader of Fianna Fail 1994–2008 and Prime Minister (Taoiseach) 1997– 2008. He worked with Tony *Blair in negotiating peace in Northern Ireland (1998). Ahmad Shah Durrani (1722–1772). Emir of Afghanistan 1747–72. At first a successful general in the service of *Nadir Shah, on the latter’s death he conquered extensive territories of which Afghanistan was the central part. This survived the collapse of his wider empire on his death and he is thus regarded as the founder of modern Afghanistan. He was also a poet. Ahmadinejad, Mahmoud (1956– ). Iranian politician, born in Abadan. A Shi’ite, his father was a grocer and barber and his mother claimed direct descent from *Muhammad. Trained as an engineer and teacher, he held a series of appointed offices, including Mayor of Tehran 2003–05, and became a leader of the Alliance of Builders of Islamic Iran. Elected as President in 2005 (narrowly defeating Hashemi *Rafsanjani), he served 2005–13. As President, he directed domestic and economic policies, but was subordinate in religious and cultural areas, and foreign policy, to the supreme leader, Ali *Khamenei, and the Council of Guardians. An intransigent opponent of Israel, he clashed repeatedly with the United States, especially over Iran’s nuclear program. There were massive protests against the conduct of the 2009 election. Ahmed Khan, Sir Sayyid (1817–1898). Indian Muslim educator and jurist. He worked in the judicial department of the East India Co. 1841–76, was a major influence in the revival of Urdu as a literary language, and reformed the organisation of Muslim education.

He studied animation, cinematography and photography, lived in the US 1981–93, then became an architect (with the FAKE design group). He made many documentary films about urban and social problems, became an influential blogger in China from 2005, campaigning for human rights and exposing government failures in the Sichuan disaster relief. He was imprisoned and beaten up several times, and accused of fraud and plagiarism. He created powerful sculptural installations, for example Forever Bicycles (2011) and Tree (2013). Aidan, St (d.651). Irish monk. Summoned by King *Oswald to become bishop of Northumbria, he left Iona in 635 and founded the monastery and see at the island of Lindisfarne. Thence his missionary journeys restored Christianity in northern England. Aiken, Conrad (Potter) (1889–1973). American poet, critic and novelist, born in Georgia. He lived in England for many years.

The third of the Mughals, he succeeded his father Humayun, and having gained the allegiance of the warlike Rajputs extended his rule over most of India. Fatehpur Sikri, 35 km from Agra, his wonderful new capital of red sandstone, symbolised the new era. He divided the country into provinces, each under a viceroy to secure law and order, promote trade and collect taxes, but Akbar himself maintained absolute central control. One of his aims was to establish a new religion containing all that was best in existing faiths and so abolishing the strife between the various sects. Among the religious leaders summoned for this purpose were Jesuit missionaries from Goa. Smith, V., Akbar the Great Mogul, 1542–1605. 2nd ed. 1919; Giri, S., Akbar. 2009.\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\nAkhenaten (or Ikhnaten: ‘Servant of the Sun disc’) (d.c.1336 BCE). Egyptian pharaoh of the XVIIIth dynasty. As Amenhotep (or Amenophis) IV, he succeeded his father Amenhotep III around 1379 BCE and may have been co-ruler with him. His mother was a commoner. He became a devotee of the sun disc (‘Aten’), an entirely rational object of worship, changed his name, and is sometimes exaggeratedly claimed as the founder of monotheism. This new religious emphasis may have been aimed at the political power of priests devoted to Amun (or Amen)-Re, also a sun-god. Amun’s name was replaced by Aten in the official religion, essentially optimistic nature worship. Weak physically, Akhenaten was no hunter, athlete or warrior but patronised the arts which flourished in his time. Some of his poems have survived. He moved his capital from Thebes to a new city Akhenaten, now Tell el Amarna. The beautiful sculptured head of his wife *Nefertiti, frequently reproduced, is in the Neues Museum, Berlin. The religion of Amun was restored by his son *Tutankhamun. Aldred, C., Akhenaten: Pharaoh of Egypt. 1972. Akhmatova, Anna (pseudonym of Anna Andreyevna Gorenko) (1889– 1966). Russian poet.

She was a leader of the Acmeist movement which was led by her husband Nikolai Gumilov and included *Mandelstam. Gumilov was executed in 1921 and Akhmatova was placed under ban 1923–40 and 1946–56. Her long Poem Without a Hero (1940–62) achieved international recognition and she is regarded as Russia’s greatest woman poet. Akihito (regnal name Heisei, i.e. ‘achieving peace’) (1933– ). Emperor of Japan 1989–2019. Son of *Hirohito, he was educated at the Gakushuin High School and Gakushuin University, graduating in political science. He travelled widely and married a commoner, Michiko Shoda, in 1959. He pursued interests in ichthyology, publishing 25 papers on a taxonomic study of the gobiid fish. In 1992 he became the first Japanese emperor to visit China, then went to the United States in 1994 and to the United Kingdom in 1998, where he was made an honorary KG. He abdicated in favour of his son *Naruhito in April 2019. Aksakov, Sergei Timofeivich (1791–1859). Russian novelist.

Alanbrooke, Alan Francis Brooke, 1st Viscount (1883–1963). British field marshal, born in France. From a leading Ulster family (*Brookeborough) he joined the army in 1902. As GOC 2nd Army Corps, in France 1939–40, he showed great skill in extricating his troops at Dunkirk (May–June 1940), then became Commander-in-Chief of home forces 1940–41, succeeding Sir John *Dill as Chief of the Imperial General Staff 1941–46 and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He had the best strategic mind of the British generals and *Churchill wanted him to be Supreme Commander for the reconquest of Europe, although their relations were sometimes stormy. In 1946 he was created Viscount and given a KG and the OM. Alarcón y Mendoza, Juan Ruiz de (1581–1639). Spanish dramatist, born in Mexico. He came to Spain and moved in the circle of Lope de *Vega. He is best known for his comedies of manners but also wrote heroic dramas. Interest in his work revived in modern times after a period of neglect. Alaric (c.370–410). Visigoth chief 395–410. A nobleman, born in modern Romania in the reign of the emperor *Theodosius I, he commanded Gothic auxiliaries in the Roman army, but on the death of the emperor in 395 broke with Rome and invaded Greece. The eastern emperor *Arcadius tried to win him over by appointing him Governor of Illyricum 396–400. He invaded Upper Italy on behalf of the emperor but in 402 was defeated by *Stilicho, the general of the western emperor Honorius. After another defeat (403) he changed sides but the bribe of huge sums of gold made by Stilicho was not paid by the emperor. When two advances upon Rome (408 and 409) had failed to secure a satisfactory settlement, Alaric entered the city as a conqueror and gave it over to pillage (410), though as an Arian Christian he forbade the desecration of religious buildings. A plan to reach Africa by way of Sicily to find a home for his people was foiled by his death in southern Italy. Alba, Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of (1507– 1582). Spanish soldier and administrator. Alba had already gained a military reputation with the armies of the emperor *Charles V in Italy, Tunisia, France and against Lutheran princes in Germany, but had equally incurred odium for intolerance and pride 11\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\nwhen Charles’ son, *Philip II of Spain, sent him (1567) as Governor-General to the Netherlands to crush the independence movement and stamp out Protestantism. In the first task he began successfully by forcing *William the Silent (of Orange) to disband his army and take refuge in Germany. However, his subsequent cruelty (in five years 18,000 people were executed by his Council of Blood and 100,000 forced into exile) stirred up the antagonism that inspired William the Silent’s subsequent leadership and led to the emergence of Holland as a separate state. Meanwhile in 1573, ill and exhausted, Alba had asked to be recalled.\n\nwhose ambition to endow her sons with Spain’s lost Italian duchies Alberoni (first minister 1714, cardinal 1717) fostered. The policy, which involved war (1718) with the Quadruple Alliance (Great Britain, France, Austria, Holland), failed and despite his sound internal administration Alberoni was dismissed.\n\nAlban, St (d.209 or 251 or 304 AC). RomanBritish martyr. Alban’s very existence is a matter of controversy, and his name may be drawn from ‘Albion’, or from ‘alba’ (‘bright’) with a feast day on the summer equinox. He may have been a soldier, possibly a Roman convert, condemned for giving shelter to a priest. Most early accounts agree that he was the first Christian martyr in Britain, beheaded in Verulamium, now St Albans. A church was built on the presumed site of his execution in 429. *Bede’s account is the longest, but he sets the date too late, after Christianity was being tolerated in the Roman empire. Many shrines were devoted to St Alban in Britain and Europe, and he has been proposed as a replacement for St *George as England’s patron saint.\n\nAlbert I (1875–1934). King of the Belgians 1909– 34. An enthusiastic naturalist, he succeeded his uncle *Leopold II and gained worldwide admiration for his defiance of German aggression in World War I and for leading the remains of his army throughout. He died in a mountaineering accident in the Ardennes. His widow Elisabeth, Duchess of Bavaria (1876– 1965) was a patron of the arts, especially music, and radical causes. His grandson, Albert II (1934– ) was King of the Belgians 1993–2013, abdicating in favour of his son Philippe.\n\nAlbanese, Anthony Norman (1963– ). Australian Labor politician, born in Sydney. Brought up by a single mother, he first met his father in Italy in 2009. Educated at St Mary’s College and Sydney University, he became a ministerial staffer, party official and Federal MP 1996– . Under *Rudd and *Gillard he was Minister for Infrastructure and Transport 2007–13 and Deputy Prime Minister 2013. Defeated by Bill *Shorten in 2013, he was Leader of the ALP 2019– . Middleton, K., Albanese. Telling It Straight. 2019. Albee, Edward Franklin (1928–2016). American dramatist. His early plays were influenced by *Jarry and *Ionesco but after Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1962) he returned to mainstream naturalism. He won Pulitzer Prizes with A Delicate Balance (1967) and Seascape (1975). Albéniz (y Pascual), Isaac (Manuel Francisco) (1860–1909). Spanish composer. A prodigy as a pianist, he later studied under *Liszt, toured the US, South America and Europe. He worked in London 1890–93 and four of his six operas have English libretti. His greatest work was the piano suite Iberia (1906–09, later orchestrated by E. F. Arbos). He was a friend of *Debussy and a student of folk music.\n\n12\n\nAlberoni, Giulio (1664–1752). Italian cardinal. Son of a gardener, he went to Spain as secretary to the Duc de Vendôme. He soon gained ascendancy at court, which was strengthened when he brought about the marriage of *Felipe V with Elizabeth (or Isabella) Farnese,\n\nHarcourt-Smith, S., Alberoni. 1963. Albers, Josef (1888–1976). German-American painter and designer. He worked at the Bauhaus, migrated to the US in 1933 and taught at Harvard and Yale. His famous series Homage to the Square influenced the development of op art and Minimalism.\n\nAlbert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (Franz Albrecht August Karl Emmanuel von Wettin) (1819–1861). British Prince Consort, born in Coburg. The second son of Ernst, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, he was educated in Brussels and Bonn and (after strenuous encouragement from their uncle *Leopold I of Belgium) married his cousin, Queen *Victoria in February 1840. The marriage was passionate and happy and they had nine children. For several years he was virtually the queen’s private secretary, which aroused political mistrust although his judgment was good. Deeply interested in music, the fine arts, architecture, science and manufacturing, the Great Exhibition of 1851 at the Crystal Palace was a tribute to his organising skills. He became a field marshal, chancellor of Cambridge University 1847–61 and was created prince consort in 1857. His death, now thought to have been from Chrone’s disease, devastated the queen who remained in seclusion for many years. London’s Albert Hall (1867) is one of many memorials to him. Weintraub, S., Albert: Uncrowned King. 1997. Albert Victor Christian Edward (von Wettin), Duke of Clarence and Avondale (1864–1892). British prince, born in Windsor. Eldest son of the future *Edward VII, he was second in the line of succession to Queen *Victoria. Known as ‘Prince Eddie’, he died of influenza. His fiancée *Mary of Teck married his brother, the future *George V, in 1893. A poor student, amiable but dim, he became, decades after his death, the subject of wild speculation, completely unsupported by evidence, that he was *Jack the Ripper.\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\nAlberti, Leon Battista (1404–1472). Italian humanist and architect, born in Genoa. Son of an exiled Florentine nobleman, he was one of the most versatile figures of the Italian Renaissance. His 10-volume treatise on architecture, De re aedificatoria (1485), was the first printed book on architecture and encouraged interest in classical forms. His buildings include churches at Mantua and the Rucellai palace at Florence. His plays, educational and moral treatises, and essays on law, politics and science reflect the extent of his interests. Gadol, J., Leon Battista Alberti. 1969. Albertus Magnus, St (Albrecht, Count of Bollstadt) (1193–1280). German philosopher. Renowned for the depth and breadth of his knowledge, he proved himself a great teacher of the Dominican order, his most famous pupil being St Thomas *Aquinas, with whom he contributed to the infusion of Aristotelianism into medieval theology. His work in natural science drew on many sources and he introduced the notion of affinity into chemistry. His work in these scientific fields gave him a reputation as a magician. Bishop of Regensburg 1260–62, he was canonised in 1931. Albrecht of Magdeburg (Albrecht von Hohenzollern) (1490–1545). German prelate. Son of the elector of Brandenburg, he became Archbishop of Magdeburg 1513–45, Archbishop and Elector of Mainz 1514– 45, Primate of Germany and a cardinal in 1518. Originally sympathetic to humanism, and influenced by *Erasmus, he spent extravagantly and borrowed heavily from the *Fuggers. His sale of indulgences, permitted by Pope *Leo X, provoked *Luther to publish his 95 theses. Albright, Madeleine (née Korbelová) (1937– ). American administrator, born in Prague. She was US Ambassador to the UN 1993–97 and Secretary of State 1997–2001, the first woman so appointed. She became a professor at Georgetown University, rejecting bids to enter Czech politics and wrote the memoir Madam Secretary (2003). She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. Albuquerque, Afonso de (1453–1515). Portuguese soldier. Raised at the court of King Alfonso V, he led an adventurous life, which included fighting against the Turks, before going to the East, where he succeeded (1507) Almeida as Viceroy. Goa, captured in 1510, became his capital and he gradually asserted control over Malabar, Ceylon, Malacca and some of the Indonesian islands. Intrigues at home led to his dismissal and he died on the way home. Alcaeus (620–after 580 BCE). Greek poet. He lived and worked on the island of Lesbos. Of his work, mainly battle songs, love songs and hymns, only fragments survive, but his Alcaic metre was used by others, especially by the Roman poet *Horace. Page, D., Sappho and Alcaeus. 1955.\n\nAlcalá Zamora, Niceto (1877–1949). Spanish politician, born in Priego. A Catholic conservative, he was a Cortes member 1905–31, Minister for Works 1917 and for War 1922 and Prime Minister 1931, negotiating *Alfonso XIII’s abdication. Elected as first president of the Spanish Republic 1931–36, he tried to reconcile all factions but showed little leadership and was distrusted by left and right. Removed in 1936, he went into exile in France, then Argentina, where he died. Alcibiades (c.450–404 BCE). Athenian leader. Brought up in the household of *Pericles, he became a brilliant but wayward member of the group of talented young men who found inspiration in discussions with Socrates. In the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta which opened in 431, Alcibiades planned and jointly led the disastrous expedition to Syracuse. On the eve of departure all the statues of the god Hermes were mutilated. For this Alcibiades was blamed and to avoid prosecution took refuge with the Spartans, whom he helped by stirring up revolts among the allies of Athens in Asia Minor. Failing, however, to retain Spartan confidence he fled to the Persian satrap Tissaphernes, whom he tried to win over to the Athenian side in the hope of obtaining his own recall. He failed with Tissaphernes, but, chosen by the Athenian forces in Samos to lead them, he was so successful in the Hellespont (Dardanelles) that he returned home in triumph. But his command was not renewed and he withdrew to Thrace, where he was murdered. Alcock, Sir John William (1892–1919). English aviator. With Arthur Whitten *Brown, he made the first aeroplane crossing of the Atlantic (14 June 1919) in a Vickers-Vimy, travelling about 3,154 km (1,960 miles) from Newfoundland to Clifden in Ireland in 16 hours 12 minutes. He died after an air accident in France. Alcott, Louisa May (1832–1888). American novelist. Her stories of family life in America, especially Little Women (1868), had phenomenal sales. She served as a nurse in the American Civil War. Stern, M., Louisa May Alcott. 1971. Alcuin (735–805). English scholar and poet, born in York. From a noble Anglo-Saxon family, he acquired his great learning at the Cloister School, York. In 782 he accepted an invitation from *Charlemagne to foster the revival of Latin language and literature throughout his empire. He spent much of his life at the imperial court at Aachen. He taught, among many others, the young princes, and even the emperor sometimes attended the classes. He was Charlemagne’s adviser in all matters concerning education. He promoted the use of Carolingian minuscule as lower case writing, and this became standard in Western Europe. From 796 he lived and taught at Tours, where he had become an abbot. 13\n\nDictionary of World Biography\n\nAldanov, M. A. (pseudonym of Mark Aleksandrovich Landau) (1886–1957). Russian novelist. He left Russia in 1919 and wrote a series of books on the French Revolutionary period. Later (in The Key etc.) he turned to the Russian revolution and in The Fifth Seal (1939) depicted the decline in revolutionary idealism that followed it. He lived in the US from 1941. Aldington, Richard (1892–1962). English poet, novelist and biographer. He wrote several volumes of Imagist and other poetry, the disillusioned war novel Death of a Hero (1929), and lively, controversial biographies of D. H. *Lawrence (Portrait of a Genius, but … , 1950) and T. E. *Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia, a Biographical Enquiry, 1954). He married (1913) the American poet Hilda *Doolittle. Aldrovandi, Ulisse (1522–1605). Italian naturalist, born in Bologna. From a noble family, after studying medicine at Bologna University and travelling, he became professor in 1560 and later first director of the botanic garden. Like many Renaissance scholars, Aldrovandi’s interests were wide ranging, and included archaeological remains and medicine. But his main passion was for natural history, especially the branches of botany, ornithology, embryology and the study of monsters. He observed the development of chicks by opening their eggs successively on each day of the incubation period, confirming that *Aristotle was correct in stating that the heart is formed prior to the liver in the embryo. Aldrovandi’s work had lasting interest chiefly through his pioneer collecting activities. His museum of natural history was amongst the largest in Europe. He planned to catalogue his collections in 14 volumes, but lived to complete only four—one on insects, and three on birds. He bequeathed his collections and manuscripts to Bologna. Bodenheimer, F. S., History of Biology. 1958. Aldus Manutius see Manutius, Aldus Aleichem, Shalom see Shalom Aleichem Alekhine, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich (1892–1946). Russian chess master. He became a French citizen and was world chess champion from 1927 (when he defeated José *Capablanca) to 1935 and again from 1937 until his death. Alekhine, A., My Best Games of Chess, 1924–1937. 1939. Aleksandr I (1777–1825). Tsar of Russia 1801– 25. He came to the throne after the murder of his father *Paul I. His education in humanitarian but abstract principles was directed by his grandmother, *Catherine the Great, but though he was at first liberal in outlook and ordered the preparation of elaborate schemes of reform, he shrank from putting all but a very small part into effect. He joined the coalition against *Napoléon, but was forced to 14\n\nconclude the treaty of Tilsit (1807). There the two emperors met and Aleksandr conceived a hero worship for the conqueror which postponed a further clash for five years. However, in 1812 Napoléon made the disastrous invasion into Russia which brought about his downfall. Aleksandr, the hero of the hour, was thus a leading figure at the Congress of Vienna (1814–15). With Austria and Prussia he formed the ‘Holy Alliance’, intended to preserve the status quo, but under the influence of *Metternich became increasingly reactionary, though he gave Russian Poland a constitution under his sovereignty. He was succeeded by his brother, *Nikolai I. Palmer, A., Alexander I. 1974. Aleksandr II (Aleksandr Nikolaievich Romanov, known as ‘the Liberator’) (1818–1881). Tsar of Russia 1855–81. Son of *Nikolai I, as Tsarevich he travelled extensively, from Siberia to England, succeeding to the throne after defeat in the Crimean War. Defeat created the atmosphere for reforms, the greatest of which was the emancipation of 10,000,000 serfs and their families (1861). He sold Alaska to the US in 1867, reformed the judicial system, abolished corporal punishment in the military, created limited local self-government (zemstvo), built railways and was sympathetic to the Finns. He married his mistress in 1880. He survived assassination attempts in 1866, 1879, 1880 but was killed by a bomb in St Petersburg. Mosse, W. E., Alexander II and the Modernisation of Russia. 1958; Radzinsky, E., Alexander II: The Last Great Tsar. 2005. Aleksandr III (Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Romanov) (1845–1894). Tsar of"
