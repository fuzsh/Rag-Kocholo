Livre d’heures Maria Stuart. Faksimile-Ausgabe der Handschrift aus dem Besitz des herzoglichen Hauses Württemberg. Handschrift, entstanden 1510/15 in Tours. [Altshausen, private collection, House <strong>of</strong> Württemberg] Darmstadt, 1988. 4 x 5.2 cm, 300, 208 pp. This is the smallest book <strong>of</strong> hours known and because <strong>of</strong> its history, the refined quality <strong>of</strong> its script and the high standard <strong>of</strong> its illuminations, one <strong>of</strong> the most precious MSS in private ownership. It was created around the time <strong>of</strong> François I. While the script can be connected to Ge<strong>of</strong>roy Tory, the miniatures point to the “School <strong>of</strong> Rouen” (in Rouen around 1500, but by 1510-20 situated near the Royal Court in Tours or Paris). It came into Mary Stuart’s possession approximately two generations after its creation and is a complete book <strong>of</strong> hours with all the textual features <strong>of</strong> its genre: beautifully written small humanistic script using pages <strong>of</strong> 21 lines, delightful, diversely arranged border decorations, numerous gold initials on colored background, 14 miniatures depicting scenes with complete figures in detailed landscapes and richly embellished interiors. Commentary: Hansmartin Decker-Hauff, Eberhard König, Myra D. Orth & Johannes Rath<strong>of</strong>er. Limited edition <strong>of</strong> 980 copies, bound in full leather, with clamshell linen case. € 1780 15th c. Messale di Giorgio di Challant, secolo XV - Aosta. [Aosta, Collégiale Saint-Pierre & Saint-Ours] Scarmagno, 1993. 34 x 51 cm, 352, 147 pp. Among the major works <strong>of</strong> late medieval figurative art in its possession, the ancient Collegiate Church <strong>of</strong> Sts. Peter and Orso in Aosta has a work <strong>of</strong> great historic value: the Missale Magnum Festivum Georgii Challandi, which was commissioned in the late 15th century by a descendant <strong>of</strong> the most powerful and illustrious feudal family in the Aosta Valley, Giorgio di Challant, the prior <strong>of</strong> the Aosta Collegiate Church from 1468 to 1509 and governor <strong>of</strong> the Duchy <strong>of</strong> Aosta. This is an illuminated missal comprises <strong>of</strong> 176 parchment folios. The illuminations are <strong>of</strong> high artistic quality, as is exemplified in the large plate <strong>of</strong> the Crucifixion that precedes the Canon, and those representing the Conception <strong>of</strong> the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Nativity, the feasts <strong>of</strong> St. Orso, St. Peter and Paul, St. John the Baptist, Easter, the Pentecost, Corpus Domini, the Assumption <strong>of</strong> the Virgin Mary, the Birth <strong>of</strong> the Virgin Mary and All Saints' Day. In these works the decorative and figurative elements, which <strong>of</strong>ten draw inspiration from nature, transcend merely stylistic decoration to become a necessary and expressive part <strong>of</strong> the entire iconographic layout and the text. Besides the many scenes represented—true masterpieces <strong>of</strong> a particular art form that differs considerably from the Italian schools <strong>of</strong> the time—the decorations in the margins with their warm, vivid colors and the large initial decorative letters, many <strong>of</strong> which are rendered in gold leaf, reveal the artist's uncommon ability in varying the arrangement <strong>of</strong> the decoration without lapsing into repetition. Commentary in It-Fr-Eng. Limited edition <strong>of</strong> 333 copies, bound in quarter brown calfskin with blind toolings and wooden boards with tie-strings; slipcase with wooden headboards and brown calfskin sides with blind toolings."
