This then made Maria Letizia a great-niece of Emperor Napoleon. Her mother Maria Clotilde was a daughter of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy.

Maria Letizia was Amadeus' second wife, as his first spouse Maria Vittoria del Pozzo della Cisterna had died in 1876. Due to the large age difference, Maria Letizia was only three years older than Amadeus' eldest child.\n\t\n\tThe couple lived in Turin and had one son: Prince Umberto, Count of Salemi who was killed during World War One.    Prince Amadeo died two years after their marriage in Turin, on 18 January 1890.\n\t\n\tDuring her widowhood, Maria Letizia maintained an open and scandalous relationship with a military man twenty years her junior. Upon her death on 25 October 1926, he was revealed to be the sole heir in her will, as her son died in 1918.",
