Olga is married to her third cousin Prince Aimone of Savoy-Aosta.\n\nEarly life[edit]\n\nPrincess Olga was born on 17 November 1971 in Athens, Greece. She grew up in Paris and New York, spending summers at the family's island retreat at Patmos, Greece.[1] She chose to attend boarding school in England, studied history in Rome, and is a graduate of Princeton University.[2] She also holds a degree from Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. Although Olga worked for a while in interior decoration, she went to Panama to photograph and study phalaena. Later, as a lepidopterist, she helped to set up and then worked in the Liquid Jungle Lab in Panama in co-operation with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. She is also a journalist and filmmaker.\n\nDynastic status[edit]\n\nUnlike other members of the Greek Royal Family, Olga was not deemed a full member of the Greek royal house under the monarchy, despite being born of a marriage recognized by King Constantine II of Greece (pursuant to Greek legislative decree 1298/1949). As daughters of a non-dynastic marriage, she and her elder sister, Princess Alexandra, are not accorded the traditional style of Royal Highness, nor do they bear the titular suffix \"and Denmark\".[3][4]\n\nAs one of the youngest known great-great-grandchildren of Christian IX of Denmark, she is related to many monarchs in Europe, despite being far younger than most of them, including:\n\nVia King Christian IX himself, she's a third cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, via her great-grand aunt Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom, King Harald V of Norway, via the former British Queen Consort, as well as via another great-grand uncle, King Frederick VIII of Denmark, who is also the ancestor of Margrethe II of Denmark and her sisters, as well as from Queen Sofia of Spain and Constantine II of Greece (being related to the Greek siblings via another great-grand aunt, Princess Thyra of Denmark, as well as a third cousin once removed of Charles, Prince of Wales, King Felipe VI of Spain, King Philippe of Belgium and Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\n\nVia King George I of Greece, she's a second cousin of Charles, Prince of Wales and his younger siblings, Queen Sofia of Spain and her younger siblings, as well as Queen Alexandra of Yugoslavia, and King Michael I of Romania, as well as Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, and his youngest siblings, as well as the deceased Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta and Paul Brandram.\n\nFinally, she's a fourth cousin of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, because he's descended from her great-great-granduncle, Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.\n\nEngagement, marriage and children[edit]\n\nEngagement[edit]\n\nHer engagement to Prince Aimone of Savoy, son of Amedeo, 5th Duke of Aosta, was announced in May 2005. Aimone and Olga are second cousins; both being great-grandchildren of the French pretender Jean d'Orléans, duc de Guise. They are also second cousins-once-removed, as George I of Greece is Aimone's great-great-grandfather and Olga's great-grandfather. Olga's father, Prince Michael of Greece and Denmark, Aimone's late paternal grandmother, Princess Irene, Duchess of Aosta (née Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark), and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (born Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark), were all first cousins.\n\nMarriage[edit]\n\nThe couple wed, after a three-year engagement, on 16 September 2008 at the Italian embassy in Moscow, the city in which Aimone is employed. Their religious marriage took place on 27 September at Patmos,[5] where it was expected that the Patriarchal Exarch of Patmos, Archimandrite Andipas Nikitaras, would preside at the Church of the Evangelismos of the Virgin Mary at Pano Kambos, with a reception following on the site of a former school.[6] Since the Second Vatican Council marriages celebrated according to the rite of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, to which the exarchate belongs, may be recognized as canonically valid.[7] A canonical dispensation was obtained from the Catholic Archbishop of Moscow, Mons. Paolo Pezzi, who was the local Ordinary of prince Aimone.[8]\n\nChildren[edit]\n\nOn 7 March 2009, Princess Olga gave birth to a son named Umberto in Paris, France.[9][10] On 24 May 2011 in Paris, Olga gave birth to another son, named Amedeo Michele. A day after his birth Amedeo was granted the title Duke of the Abruzzi by his paternal grandfather.[11] On 14 December 2012, Olga gave birth to a baby daughter, Isabella Vita Marina, in Paris, France.[12]\n\nTitles and Styles\n\n17 November 1971-16 September 2008: Her Highness Princess Olga of Greece\n\n16 September 2008-present: Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Apulia, Princess of Greece\n\nReferences[edit]"
