        "text": "The “Local History” in recent decades has been re-evaluated because it is considered important in the understanding of complex processes of historical, social and economic value. These include emigration that since the end of the nineteenth century has seen the departure from Italy of millions of citizens. Since 2010, as part of the Historical – Cultural Association “Progetto Centola” and then of the “Mingardo/Lambro/Cultura” Group, a research project has been launched with the aim of reconstructing the vicissitudes of the many families of the Municipality of Centola (Cilento, SA) many of whom, over more than a century, have left their country of origin. Some of the results acquired have already been published, see References 1, 2 and 3. This volume reports the results of a study concerning the transoceanic emigration of citizens of Centola, towards the United States of America (period 1892 -1924) with particular attention to the qualitative, quantitative and anthropological aspects of the process.\n\nThis essay considers the topic of Italian migration since 1945 vis-à-vis the cultural landscape that is Italian California. We begin by recognizing an important premise: the need to adjust the conventional historical periodization of Italian migration to the United States by outlining the on-going history of Italian migration to the United States and specifically through an analysis of the continued migration directed towards California as a destination. Aspects of this essay borrow heavily from two other essays, both of which were similarly co-authored and which themselves are found in our two co-edited volumes: New Italian Migrations to the United States, Volume 1, Politics and History since 1945 and Volume 2, Art and Culture since 1945 (both released in 2017 with the University of Illinois Press). Although in those books the California case study is not taken on directly as it is here.\n\nPrior to the massive wave of emigration to South America during the nineteenth century, inhabitants of rural communities in the western French Pyrenees emigrated in large numbers to Saint-Domingue and other Caribbean islands. This article examines the connections between migratory movements and the organization of these communities into “house societies” (Lévi-Strauss) in which the continuation of the “house” was paramount and no new “houses” could be founded. Adopting a microhistorical approach, it analyzes the complex role of inheritance rights in the decision to emigrate and reconstructs the networks that made emigration possible. Unlike the traditional belief that sons were forced to leave because they were deprived of their share of inheritance, the family unit fully supported the emigration of its younger members. This article also argues that emigration simultaneously resulted from and undermined the “house system.”"
