In Italy it is common for aristocratic families to have “funerals more nobilium”, reserved to aristocratic families. A distinctive gesture is to place the coffin on the floor and to cover it with the family’s standard. This tradition is common only in Italy.\n\nhttps://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funerale_more_nobilium\n\nAnyway this is the lying-in-state but ceremonially similar.\n\nIn Italy, it is a sign of utmost respect to place the coffin on the floor.

This tradition is common only in Italy.\n\nhttps://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funerale_more_nobilium\n\nAnyway this is the lying-in-state but ceremonially similar.\n\nThe tradition of placing the coffin on the floor was also followed in the funeral of Queen Fabiola, although she was not Italian.\n\nWith the presence of the President of the Senate, today the Italian State was represented at the highest level\n\nHe stated in an interview that he was there for two reasons, private and official. First and foremost, he was there for Emanuele Filiberto, which whom he is good friends but also because he recognises the part that the House of Savoy played in the history of Italian unification, saying that with the House of Savoy, it's not a question of \"light\" or \"shadow\" but light AND shadow.\n\nI haven't seen pictures of VE's two younger sisters, but at least some of Princess Maria Gabriella's grandchildren were present:\n\nhttps://media.gettyimages.com/id/19...=2ili1UmSXcjmI-EPs0jpp-Wib2yer6st2aoD8JMPPZQ=\n\nIn this image, the young woman behind Luisa should be Gabriella Janssens (b.2004, daughter of Elisabeth Balkany and her husband Olivier Janssens), with one of her younger brothers, probably Victor\n\nThanks. Have already wondered who they are. Good to know that there seems to be a relationship between EF and his cousin Gabriella.\n\nAccording to La Stampa, the House of Savoy announced that the following Royals will be present at tomorrow's funeral:\n\nGrand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, Prince Albert II of Monaco, Queen Sofia of Spain, Princess Astrid and Prince Lorenz of Belgium, Archduke Martin of Austria, Prince Leka of Albania, Charles and Camilla of Bourbon Two Sicilies, the Royal Prince of Saudi Arabia, Grand Duke George of Russia, Prince Jean Christophe Bonaparte, the Count and Countess of Paris, the Duke and Duchess of Parma, the Princes of Serbia (the Crown Prince and Princess?), the Royal Prince of Saudi Arabia, the Prince of Portugal of Braganza royal family (the Duke of Braganza?).\n\nPrince Aimone and Princess Olga will also be present.\n\nhttps://www.lastampa.it/torino/2024...fettuosa_dei_windsor_ma_nessuno_di_-14058991/\n\nI'm not sure if it's completely reliable, but I definitely expected Prince Albert of Monaco and somebody from Belgium and Luxembourg, and it seems that Henri and Astrid, children of two of VE's Belgian first cousins will be there; I'm surprised to see Queen Sofia listed, after the infamous incident at Felipe and Letizia's wedding.\n\nAccording to La Stampa, the House of Savoy announced that the following Royals will be present at tomorrow's funeral:\n\nGrand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, Prince Albert II of Monaco, Queen Sofia of Spain, Princess Astrid and Prince Lorenz of Belgium, Archduke Martin of Austria, Prince Leka of Albania, Charles and Camilla of Bourbon Two Sicilies, the Royal Prince of Saudi Arabia, Grand Duke George of Russia, Prince Jean Christophe Bonaparte, the Count and Countess of Paris, the Duke and Duchess of Parma, the Princes of Serbia (the Crown Prince and Princess?), the Royal Prince of Saudi Arabia, the Prince of Portugal of Braganza royal family (the Duke of Braganza?).\n\nPrince Aimone and Princess Olga will also be present.\n\n.\n\nThat is an unexpectedly impressive guest list. I regret, however, that none of the Protestant monarchies will send representatives.\n\nRoyals who will be present at the funeral:\n\nQueen Sofia of Spain\n\nPrincess Astrid of Belgium and Prince Lorenz\n\nPrince Albert II of Monaco\n\nKing Albert and Paola of Belgium\n\nPrince Alexander of Serbia and Princess Katherine\n\nPrince Leka of Albania\n\nDuke and Duchess of Braganza and Duarte de Sousa Araújo Martins (spouse of Infanta María Francisca)\n\nMohammad bin Salman\n\nGrand Duke George of Russia\n\nJean Christophe Bonaparte\n\nCount and Countess of París\n\nDuke and Duchess of Castro\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/C3I2ATcItos/?igsh=ZjVoZGIwN2Nsc2Nh\n\nAlso the Duke of Aosta and Princess Olga.\n\nThe Prince of Naples is to be cremated. The ashes will return to Superga, there is no space left for a coffin.\n\nThat is an unexpectedly impressive guest list. I regret, however, that none of the Protestant monarchies will send representatives.\n\nBut then the only time Vittorio Emanuele and Marina where present at an Event in a protestant monarchy was the danish Royal Wedding in 2004. And there are no family relations to them like to the catholic Families.\n\nBut yes indeed a quiet good guestlist. Would not have expected such a turnout\n\nSurprised not see the Pahlavis not on the list considering the late Prince’s links to the family as well as Filiberto’s friendship with CP Reza Pahlavi.\n\nAccording to La Stampa, the House of Savoy announced that the following Royals will be present at tomorrow's funeral:\n\nGrand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, Prince Albert II of Monaco, Queen Sofia of Spain, Princess Astrid and Prince Lorenz of Belgium, Archduke Martin of Austria, Prince Leka of Albania, Charles and Camilla of Bourbon Two Sicilies, the Royal Prince of Saudi Arabia, Grand Duke George of Russia, Prince Jean Christophe Bonaparte, the Count and Countess of Paris, the Duke and Duchess of Parma, the Princes of Serbia (the Crown Prince and Princess?), the Royal Prince of Saudi Arabia, the Prince of Portugal of Braganza royal family (the Duke of Braganza?).\n\nPrince Aimone and Princess Olga will also be present.\n\nhttps://www.lastampa.it/torino/2024...fettuosa_dei_windsor_ma_nessuno_di_-14058991/\n\nI'm not sure if it's completely reliable, but I definitely expected Prince Albert of Monaco and somebody from Belgium and Luxembourg, and it seems that Henri and Astrid, children of two of VE's Belgian first cousins will be there; I'm surprised to see Queen Sofia listed, after the infamous incident at Felipe and Letizia's wedding.\n\nWhich Saudi Prince? Quite surprised to know of any links to the Saudis. The only link to Saudi is that Filiberto opened one of his restaurants in Riyadh.\n\nIt strikes me that Queen Sofia is on the list Due to the latest references that Victor Manuel made about King Juan Carlos, but also because she did not attend the funeral of her cousin the Duke of Aosta who was son of the Princess Irene of Greece, sister of King Paul..Everyone expected that the Queen Sofia went to her cousin Amadeo's funeral, however she did not attend, which is why her presence seems very strange to me. :\n\nIt strikes me that Queen Sofia is on the list Due to the latest references that Victor Manuel made about King Juan Carlos, but also because she did not attend the funeral of her cousin the Duke of Aosta who was son of the Princess Irene of Greece, sister of King Paul..Everyone expected that the Queen Sofia went to her cousin Amadeo's funeral, however she did not attend, which is why her presence seems very strange to me. :\n\nPerhaps Queen Sofía did not attend the Duke of Aosta's funeral because of the Covid pandemic. It seemed as though only Amedeo's immediate family was present for his funeral, and they were all wearing masks. It might have been too great a health risk for the Queen."
