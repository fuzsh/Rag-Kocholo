        "text": "Hey, does anyone remember that bright young Bonaparte kid? Showed up out of nowhere, shot across Europe like a shooting star, had a great career ahead of him, and then BAM! Vanished. Anybody know what he’s up to these days?\n\nWell, he died of stomach cancer on a small South Atlantic island in 1821, and good riddance too, but his family is still around. Honestly, it’s pretty amazing. Napoleon was a dominant presence in European politics for less than two decades, and during that time virtually every member of his family managed to marry someone important. And while the family lost it’s political importance after 1871, its members remain embedded throughout the world. They’re like kudzu. Turn over any leaf or rock in the world and you’re likely to find a member of the House of Bonaparte or one of it’s associated families. There have been Bonaparte politicians and generals and Kings and scientists and artists and revolutionaries, in virtually every country in Europe and quite a few beyond. In this article, I’d like to conclude the truly mammoth task of tracing these lines. Going through Napoleon himself and each of his siblings and children, I’ll trace the lines of descent to the present day (to the best of my ability) and note people of interest. Please note this is a non-exhaustive list, as many people are not important enough for any information to be available about them. So think of this as a highlights tour.\n\nLet’s finish this.\n\nPrevious Installments: Part One, Part Two, and Part Three\n\nPauline Bonaparte (1780-1825)\n\nPauline was the sixth Bonaparte sister. Her brother arranged her marriage to General Charles Leclerc in 1797, though it does not seem to have been her wish. In 1801, Napoleon appointed him Governor-General of Saint-Domingue and ordered him to suppress the insurrection that had overthrown French authority on the island and restore slavery. Though Leclerc was able to capture Toussaint Louverture, the self-proclaimed President of Haiti, the expedition was soon bogged down in a morass of guerilla warfare and a yellow fever epedemic. Pauline entertained herself during this time by engaging in a number of extramarital affairs and cataloging local plant-life. In 1802, Leclerc died to yellow fever and Pauline returned to France. In 1803, she married Camillo Borghese, the Prince of Sulmona. This marriage appears to have been no more happy than the first. In 1806 Napoleon made her Princess and Duchess of Guastalla but she sold the territory to Parma for six million francs. Upon the Fall of the First French Empire, Pauline visited Napoleon on Elba, the only one of his siblings to do so. Her home in Paris was used by the Duke of Wellington during the occupation of France, and remains the residence of the British Ambassador to France to this day. She had one son, Dermide Louis Napoleon, born in 1798, but he died in 1804.\n\nElisa Bonaparte (1777-1820)\n\nElisa Bonaparte is noteworthy mainly for being the only one of Napoleon’s sisters to exercise direct political power. In 1805, she was made Princess of Piombino and Lucca, a role which she seems to have embraced enthusiastically. Though not popular with her subjects, Elisa introduced new legal and penal codes, reformed the clergy, worked to encourage charity and sanitation, and established compulsory public education. She was also a notable patron of the arts. In 1809, she was made Grand Duchess of Tuscany, though she was given much less independence from Napoleon’s orders there. Like several of his other siblings, relations between the two cooled as the fortunes of war turned and Bonaparte found it necessary to demand more and more resources from their fiefdoms. After the Fall of the First French Empire, Elisa remained in Italy, where she financed a number of archeological digs. She died of disease in 1820, the only one of Napoleon’s siblings to predecease him.\n\nElisa married a minor Corsican nobleman named Felice Pasquale Baciocchi, and they had four children. Jérôme Charles (1810–1811) and Felice Napoleon (1798–1799) did not survive into adulthood. Federico Napoleon (1814–1833) lived slightly longer but there does not appear to any information about him. Elisa Napoléone Baciocchi (1806-1869) was the only child to live into adulthood. There is very little information about her either. She lived in Italy most of her life, though she moved to Paris briefly after the establishment of the Second Empire. She supported various Bonapartist Restoration attempts. She was apparently mostly interested in managing her estates. Her only son was Charles Félix Jean-Baptiste Camerata-Passionei di Mazzoleni (1826-1853). He received a high-ranking judicial appointment in the Second Empire, but committed suicide at the age of twenty-six, supposedly after being forbidden from marrying an actress.\n\nJérôme Bonaparte (1784-1860)\n\nJerome Bonaparte was the youngest of Napoleon’s brothers, and perhaps the least accomplished. He had no independent career at all prior to his brother’s assumption of power. He served in the French Navy, during which he married an American woman in Baltimore named Elizabeth Patterson in 1803. Upon his return to France, his brother forced the couple to divorce (helping to precipitate the open break between the Bonapartes and the Papacy) and ordered Jerome to marry a German princess. He was then installed as King of Westphalia, a new French satellite state created in western Germany. Here Jerome became notorious for the extravagance of his court, racking up comparable expenses to the French Imperial Court. During the invasion of Russia he was reprimanded by his brother for attempting to take his entire entourage on campaign with him, after which he threw a tantrum and returned to Westphalia. During the second French Empire he held several ceremonial positions such as Marshal of France and President of the Senate before his death in 1860.\n\nJerome Bonaparte had four legitimate children, as well as several bastards, which is thankfully many fewer than some of his brothers. We’ll start with his eldest son, Jérôme Napoléon Bonaparte (1805-1870), founder of the American branch of House Bonaparte. While on leave in Baltimore, Jerome had fallen in love with a local heiress, Elizabeth Patterson, and married her. Upon their return to France, she was already pregnant, but they immediately ran into the righteous fury of Napoleon Bonaparte, who wanted Jerome available to make a diplomatic marriage. When the Pope would not annul the marriage, Napoleon did so by an Imperial Order, and forbid Patterson from setting foot on French soil, which she had hoped to do so as to ensure her son would have French citizenship. What Jerome thought of all of this I do not know—but he does not seem to ever seen his first wife or son again.\n\nJerome Napoleon was born in England, where his mother took refuge, but grew up in Baltimore. He graduated from Mount St. Mary’s College, and attended Law School at Harvard University. He was the founding president of the Maryland Club, an exclusive gentleman’s club in Baltimore. It is mostly known for supporting Confederate independence during the Civil War and being one of the last private clubs in America to forbid female membership. Lovely. Perhaps most notably, it is generally believed that he was the inspiration for the Titles of Nobility Amendment, a proposed constitutional amendment that would have stripped U.S. citizenship from anyone who accepted a foreign title of nobility. It was accepted by Congress in 1810, and came within two states of ratification, but alas fell short. Jerome Napoleon married Susan May Williams, another (very wealthy) Baltimore heiress, and had two children, Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte II (1830-1893) and Charles Joseph Bonaparte (1851-1921).\n\nThe elder son, perhaps seeking to follow his grand-uncle’s footsteps, chose a military career. In 1848 he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1852 and beginning service as a Second Lieutenant in the Mounted Riflemen Regiment in Texas. His service lasted only until 1854, however, when he resigned to take up a post as a Lieutenant of Dragoons in the newly declared Second French Empire, ruled by his cousin Napoleon III. His career seems to have been quite successful; he fought in the Crimean War, the Second War of Italian Independence, the French Colonial Campaigns in Algeria, and the Franco-Prussian War, receiving the Légion d’honneur and rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. After the Empire’s dissolution in 1871, he returned to the United States and married a woman named Caroline Le Roy Appleton Edgar. They had two children, one of which is alleged to have “numerous descendants” but I can find no information about any of them. His younger brother chose a very different career path.\n\nCharles Joseph received his law degree from Harvard University Law School and opened a law practice in Baltimore, however his real interest seems to have been in politics. In 1885, he helped found the Reform League of Baltimore, which fought for fair elections and municipal reform with a fair degree of success, culminating in the 1895 elections in which reformist Republicans seized control of the city government from the Democratic Party machine. In 1894 he was one of a number of progressives (including Theodore Roosevelt and Louis Brandeis) who met in Philadelphia to found the National Municipal League, which fought for similar reforms nationwide. He was also chairman of the National Civil Service Reform League, a member of the Board of Indian Commissioners, and a Maryland Presidential Elector in the 1904 Election. In 1905, his friend President Roosevelt appointed him as Secretary of the Navy. In 1906, he became Attorney General, a post he retained until the end of the Roosevelt Administration in 1912. Here, Bonaparte served as the point man for Roosevelt’s efforts to break up the Trusts, earning the name “Charlie the Crook Chaser” for his efforts to break up the tobacco monopoly. In perhaps his most enduring legacy, in 1908 he established a Bureau of Investigation within the Justice Department.\n\nAfter the end of his tenure as Attorney General, Charles Joseph seems to have retired from public life. Though he married, he did not have any children. Thus brings us to the end of the Patterson-Bonapartes. But back in Europe, Jerome Bonaparte and his new, Imperially-Approved, wife, Princess Catharina of Württemberg, had produced a new, legitimate line of heirs.\n\nTheir first child was Jérôme Napoléon Charles Bonaparte (1814-1847). He was born in Trieste, a year after his father’s deposition from the Throne of Westphalia. Jerome Napoleon Charles lived most of his life at his grandfather’s court in Württemberg, where he attended a military academy and served in the Württemberger Army, eventually attaining the rank of colonel. He seems to have been a French patriot, despite never setting foot in the country, or at least he is quoted by a visiting French novelist as saying: “Eternal glory to whoever makes France happy!” He was perennially sick from childhood, and died unmarried and without issue at the age of thirty-two. His younger sister was Mathilde Bonaparte (1820-1904). Raised in Italy like her siblings, she was briefly engaged to her cousin Louis Napoleon but broke this off when he was thrown in jail by the French authorities when he tried to take over the country. (Don’t worry, he eventually made it work.) In 1840, she married Count Anatole Demidov, an influential and wealthy Russian nobleman, in Rome. The marriage was deeply unhappy, with Anatole’s insistence on maintaining his mistress apparently a severe point of contention. In 1846, she fled to Paris with her lover Émilien de Nieuwerkerke, taking with her husband’s jewelry. A legal separation was eventually hammered out by a St. Petersburg Court, though Anatole was never able to recover his property.\n\nIn Paris, Princess Mathilde became a prominent salon holder, hosting many gatherings of the artistically important and successful. She was only member of the Bonaparte family to remain in France following the Fall of the Second Empire in 1871. In 1873, she married the artist Claudius Marcel Popelin. She is a minor character in Marcel Proust’s In the Shadow of Young Girls In Flower, the second volume of In Search of Time Lost. She died in 1904 without issue.\n\nJerome and Catharine’s third child was Prince Napoléon Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte (1822-1891), commonly known as Prince Jérôme Napoléon or “plom-plom”. Additionally, within the army he was known as “Craint-Plomb” (“Afraid-of-Lead”), a reference to him missing the Battle of Solferino. Like so many Bonapartes, he returned to France after the Revolution of 1848 and won election to the Assembly representing Corsica. After his cousin Louis’s seizure of power in 1852, he became a close advisor to the new Emperor, advocating for intervention in Italy to support the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia and the Italian Nationalists, a policy that would lead to the Treaty of Turin, the Second Italian War of Independence, and the founding of the Kingdom of Italy. As part of this alliance, he married King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy’s daughter Princess Maria Clotilde in 1859. At court, he also became the leading advocate of anti-Clerical policies, opposing in this the influence of Empress Eugenie. At various times, he held the posts of Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain, Govenor of Algeria, Divisional Commander in the Crimean War, and Corps Commander in the Second Italian War of Independence. After the fall of the monarchy in 1871, he relocated to Switzerland, where he died in 1891, leaving behind three children.\n\nHis youngest child, and only daughter, was Maria Letizia Bonaparte (1866-1926). She is only notable for her marriage to Amadeus, Duke of Aosta, an Italian nobleman who had briefly been King of Spain between 1870 and 1873. He was also her uncle. The marriage, in 1888, attracted considerable attention, as it was the highest-profile event a Bonaparte had been involved with since the fall of the Second Empire, and there was briefly some serious speculation of a Bonaparte Revival in France. She had one son, Prince Umberto (1889-1918). He seems to have had a troubled youth; in 1911 he was expelled from the Livorno Naval Academy after accusations of theft and inappropriate relationships with some women in town, and his cousin King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy had him imprisoned for eighteen months in Moncalieri Castle that same year because of “various misdemeanors and pranks”. When the First World War broke out, he volunteered for the Royal Italian Army, serving throughout the war as a lieutenant in a cavalry regiment. He was awarded a silver medal for bravery, but died of influenza a month before the Armistice, leaving no issue.\n\nMaria Letizia’s older brother was Louis Bonaparte (1864–1932). Like his nephew Umberto, he served in the Italian Army, but left the service in 1890 to join the Russian Army. In 1895 he became a colonel, and in 1902 he was appointed Governor of Yerevan with orders to suppress fighting between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. In 1910 he retired with the rank of Lieutenant-General. During WWI he returned to service as the Russian Liaison Officer with the Third Italian Army. After the war he traveled to Japan and the United States before retiring to his estates in Switzerland. He never married and had no children.\n\nNow, Jerome was probably the least competent of all of the Napoleon Brothers but he managed to excel in one respect: He maintained a viable male bloodline. Napoleon, when he wrote the rules of succession for the House of Bonaparte, specifically excluded the possibility of succession via the female line (Napoleon was a misogynistic asshole btw). This meant that none of the children of his three sisters were could claim the Imperial French Throne. His brother Joseph only fathered daughters. His brother Lucien had many sons, but all of them were stricken from the succession when Lucien, an ardent Jacobin, repudiated Napoleon’s assumption of Imperial Authority. Louis Bonaparte had one surviving son, the future Emperor Napoleon III. He in turn also had only one son, Napoléon, Prince Imperial. When he died fighting the Zulus in 1879 (It’s complicated), leadership of House Bonaparte and the claim to the Imperial Throne fell to Victor, Prince Napoléon (1862-1926).\n\nVictor was hailed by his supporters as Emperor Napoleon V, though his “reign” was very contentious. His father lived until 1891, and was never reconciled with the fact that he had been bypassed in the chain of succession (I do not know why the Prince Imperial chose to do this), and the two were not on good terms. Additionally, many Bonapartists believed that Lieutenant-General Louis Bonaparte would have been a better choice. His moment of glory came during the Dreyfus Affair, when for a time it seemed that the French Republic was on the verge of collapse. Victor announced that when the time was right, he and his brother Louis would invade France at the head of an army, restoring the Empire. It is not clear to me that anyone had informed Louis of this. Whatever the case may be, the French government weathered the crisis, and the Legions of Loyal Bonapartists never materialized. In 1910, Victor married Princess Clémentine of Belgium, the daughter of King Leopold II. Yes, the one who killed half the population of the Congo. Small world! It seems to have been a genuinely happy marriage; she wrote to her sister, saying, “My good husband, gentle, adoring, tender, loving, intelligent, connoisseur of people and things. He is beautiful, this Prince. Napoleon is a love, I adore him.” Awwww. Victor died in 1926. Charles Maurras, the French Far Right political theorist of Action Française, complained of Victor that he had “not offered any new ideas since 1884”.\n\nVictor and Clémentine had two children. The older was Marie Clotilde Bonaparte (1912-1996), who had a lot of children but didn’t do anything of interest. None of her children seem very interesting either. Her younger brother was Louis, Prince Napoléon (1914-1997). Continuing the internationalist trend of the Bonapartes, Louis had a cosmopolitan upbringing, spending time in Belgium, England, and Switzerland. Upon his father’s death he took the title Napoleon VI. When World War II broke out, he attempted to join the French Army, but was refused due to French laws banning the members of the former dynasties from residence in France (a very sensible law imho). Not deterred, he enlisted in the French Foreign Legion under the name Louis Blanchard. He saw some fighting in North Africa before the Armistice in 1941, and when the Legion demobilized he attempted to travel to England to join De Gaulle. He was arrested and imprisoned, but released shortly, after which he joined the Organisation de résistance de l’armée, a Resistance force formed of former French soldiers. He served in the Charles Martel Brigade under the conclusion of hostilities. Also in the same unit was his cousin Joachim, Prince Murat, who was killed in action in 1944. For his service, he received the Légion d’honneur, the Croix de guerre, the, Médaille de la Résistance, and the 1939–1945 Commemorative War Medal. Postwar, he became a businessman.\n\nNapoleon VI had four children. Of his daughters, Princess Catherine and Princess Laure, I can find no information. His younger son, Prince Jérôme Napoléon (1957-?), is currently a librarian at the University of Geneva, as well as being the current Bonaparte heir. His older son is where things get interesting. Charles, Prince Napoleon, (1950-?), has an economics degree from the Sorbonne, and has written a number of books, including “A History of Urban Transportation”, and a number of histories of the Bonaparte family. He’s worked in banking and real estate, and spent some time as a professor at the American Institute of Foreign Policy. In addition, he’s dabbled with politics; running for mayor of Ajaccio in 2000 and mayor of Nemours in 2008, but winning neither election. He did however serve for a term of office on the Ajaccio City Council, holding the post of Deputy Mayor at one point. He’s been married twice, with four children. His first wife, Princess Béatrice of Bourbon-Two Sicilies is daughter of the current pretender to the Throne of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. His daughters Caroline and Sophie do not seem to have done anything of interest. His adopted daughter Anh is of interest because she’s a Vietnamese adoptee. Vietnamese Bonapartes! What a world. His son and heir is named Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon (1986-?), who has lived a fairly uninteresting life. He’s worked in New York as an investment banker for Morgan Stanley and in London for the Blackstone Group. He is unmarried and without issue.\n\nSo far, a normal portrait of a modern aristocratic family. But when Napoleon VI died in 1997, he threw the entire Bonapartist world into chaos, declaring in his will the disinheritance of Charles, Prince Napoleon in favor of Jean-Christophe.\n\nAccording to Napoleon VI’s lawyer this was due to Charles holding “republican and democratic opinions…. He has deprived himself of all rights to dynastic heritage in remarrying without his father’s permission… which is against the rules of the imperial family.” Charles in turn argued that his father had been misled by Wicked Counselors: “Without doubt, he had a mood swing, exploited by conservative elements in his entourage with whom I have long clashed…. I am fighting so that my family ceases to be the victim of attempted manipulation.” Additionally, there is a very complicated dispute over whether or not Napoleon VI had the legal authority under the laws of House Bonaparte to alter the succession. Frankly, I’m pretty sure he did, but I am neither a Bonapartist or a lawyer. Either way, since 1997 both Charles and Jean-Chrisophe have claimed the title of Napoleon VII, and Bonapartists have schismed into two camps. Both father and son seem to have a sense of proportion about this dispute, and reportedly remain on good terms, but it does not seem likely that this dispute will be resolved until one of the claimants deaths.\n\nAre we at the end of our journey though the Wonderful World of Bonapartes? Yes, in more ways than one. As I’ve mentioned, due to Napoleon’s rules excluding succession through the female line, every brand of the Bonaparte family except Jerome’s ran out of legitimate heirs a generation or two ago. Now the time seems to be coming for the Jeromists as well. Jean-Christophe does not have children, and all his siblings are female. His heir is his uncle Prince Jérôme Napoléon, who is also childless. Unless things change, the last line of Bonaparte heirs will end within a few decades, though presumably the “official Imperial pretender” will become some distant cousin or other. But I wouldn’t worry too much. The legitimate line may end, but the Bonaparte Family is too vast, too entrenched, too widespread to be destroyed by anything less than a nuclear war or the Revolution of the Proletariat. And if the Revolution does come, it wouldn’t surprise me to see a Bonaparte or two leading the charge."
