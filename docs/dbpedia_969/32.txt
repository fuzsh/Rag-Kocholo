Maria Letizia Bonaparte, Duchess of Aosta (source)

“Diamonds with a History”

(originally appeared in the New York Times, 16 Aug 1891)

The magnificent diamond tiara and necklace [1] which the Duchess of Aosta [2] wore when she appeared in full dress on her recent visit to England are the famous jewels which the Emperor Napoleon [3] gave to Princess Clotilde [4] in 1859 on her marriage, and they were worth a good fortune.

When Princess Clotilde fled to Italy in September 1870, she took these jewels with her, and placed them in charge of King Victor Emmanuel [5], who peremptorily refused to give them up to Prince Napoleon, who was anxious to convert them into money; but he never succeeded at recapturing them, although he frequently attempted to do so. The Duchess of Aosta left Paris on Saturday for Moncalieri, near Turin, on a visit to her mother, Princess Clotilde.
