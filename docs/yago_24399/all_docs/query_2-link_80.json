After a spurt of rapid growth, followed by an economic crisis, it is back on track with a considerably more advanced economy than previously. Its educational system has been substantially upgraded, although certain aspects remain poor, and its governance is more democratic than ever, despite some glaring issues. Although much remains to be done, its achievements are considerable. Part of this can probably be traced to those aspects where Thailand differs from the others. Most notably, it was the only country to avoid colonization and thus has a stronger sense of nationhood and deeper cultural roots. It is also nearer to China, Indochina, and Burma, once a serious disadvantage, now a plus as those countries also seek to modernize. Thailand, with its similarities and uniqueness, its advantages and drawbacks, presents a varied picture that is often hard to grasp. Yet, the authors of the Historical Dictionary of Thailand have managed to describe an amazing number of aspects: history and politics, economy and society, and religion and culture. They have also focused on many of the leading personalities, whether politicians or military men, educators or writers, and monks or kings. To this can be added major cities and provinces, political parties and international organizations, and ethnic groups and grassroots movements. Together with a handy chronology and a selective, but quite comprehensive bibliography, this is an extremely helpful introduction to an extremely interesting country. This second edition of the Historical Dictionary of Thailand builds upon the first. Harold E. Smith, who coauthored the first edition, and wrote the predecessor Historical and Cultural Dictionary of Thailand, is the lead author this time. He knows Thailand well, having twice been a visiting professor at Thai universities, and having traveled widely there. He also lectured and wrote extensively about Thailand before becoming ix\n\n05-241 (01) Front.qxd\n\nx •\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:20 AM\n\nPage x\n\nEDITOR’S FOREWORD\n\nprofessor emeritus of sociology at Northern Illinois University. This time he was aided by Gayla S. Nieminen, who studied the Thai language in Bangkok and has also visited periodically, and who is presently researching educational agencies. Most unfortunately, the other coauthor of the first edition, May Kyi Win, has since passed away but her contribution remains. A longtime observer, she was the curator of the Donn V. Hart Southeast Asia Collection of Founders Memorial Library at Northern Illinois University. This book is in a sense a tribute to her and to a country she loved. Jon Woronoff Series Editor\n\n05-241 (01) Front.qxd\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:20 AM\n\nPage xi\n\nPreface\n\nInterest in Thailand by Westerners and others grew rapidly after World War II. Today, Thailand continues its longtime role as a leader in Southeast Asian affairs. With its export-oriented economy, it has a significant role in international trade. During the colonial period and later when communism threatened, Thailand remained a stable and independent nation. In this volume, we have attempted to provide some glimpses of Thailand’s long history since the 13th century. Biographical sketches include those of former kings and the present king, who have been revered leaders of the kingdom, and of the military and civilian leaders who have been prominent since 1932. Many significant events are briefly chronicled in a focus on domestic affairs of this important nation in Southeast Asia. The impact on Thailand of neighboring countries and Western nations including France, Great Britain, and the United States is also treated. The pattern of discussion is to name the country followed by the phrase “relations with.” Family names in Thailand began to be used after 1916, but the pattern of referring to one another by first name continues. Thai biographical entries in the book are alphabetized by first name, while all other biographies are alphabetized in the Western manner by surname. The dictionary section of this book is organized so that entries are arranged alphabetically. A topic can be explored further by using the numerous cross-reference words in most entries, which are indicated by boldface type. Additional information is provided at the end of each entry under see also and a list of related entries. The name “Thailand” became official in 1939. Since the late 18th century, the nation had been called “Siam.” An alternative name for the country, historically, was the name of the capital city, e.g., Ayutthaya, the name of the country (kingdom) for more than 400 years. In English, xi\n\n05-241 (01) Front.qxd\n\nxii •\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:20 AM\n\nPage xii\n\nPREFACE\n\nthe word “Thai” is used to refer to people who speak a particular language that is part of the Tai-language family. We have tried to avoid confusion between “Thai” and “Tai” by including with the word “Tai” the word language. For instance, one of the Tai-language words that appears frequently is “wat,” which in translation is “Buddhist temple compound.” No precise standard exists for the romanization of the Tai-language script. In this work, the authors have employed what we considered a generally used romanization of Tai words and expressions. We have been guided by romanization of Tai words utilized by the Thai government and by Thai writers who have used English in their publications. In this book, most Tai-language words appear beside the English equivalent. A Chronology of Events in Thailand appears before the dictionary section. This can be a handy reference or a kind of time framework for those who wish to explore specific time periods of Thai history. A series of maps showing the provinces of Thailand in each of the six regions begins on page viiii. This is followed on the next page by a listing of the provinces by region. This key to the location of provinces corresponds to the listing in appendix D. Harold E. Smith and Gayla S. Nieminen Northern Illinois University DeKalb, Illinois, U.S.A.\n\n05-241 (01) Front.qxd\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:20 AM\n\nPage xiii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nOur focus on Thai studies began in early 1964 through an opportunity to teach and conduct research at a university in Thailand. Absorption in the Thai experience was expanded in early 1965 by an offer to continue a second year. A decade later brought another opportunity for universityconnected teaching and continuation of studies of the Thai family and the modern Thai medical profession. Financial support was from the Educational (Fulbright) Foundation of Thailand. As the senior author developed a specialty in the sociology of Thailand, he learned much from American colleagues and Thai university faculty. Among the Thais were Snit Smukarn, Paitoon Cruago, Suphat Sotthitada, Chamrieng Bhavichitra, Chalermsri Dhamabutra, Prasert Bhandachat, Narong and Ruthjaporn Prachadetsuwat, Chaiwat Roongrungsee, Noppadol and Nisada Wedchayanon, and Buskorn Prugsapongse.

Around 10,000 BCE, ethnic groups of SEA peoples were becoming differentiated. They had domestic animals. Rice was cultivated. Outrigger canoes were used. From 5,000 BCE, metallurgy practices used bronze and copper. Prehistoric settlements existed at Ban Chiang and other sites. From 3,000 BCE, iron work was used. 2000 BCE–800 CE A distinctive civilization was shared by SEA peoples present in northern SEA and south China. Gradually, Tai-language speakers migrated south and west.\n\nEarly Kingdoms and Polities 800–1350 CE 800–1200 Dvaravati, a Mon civilization, occupied what now is central and western Thailand. In the 11th century, Mon centers fell under domination of the Khmer kingdom of Angkor. In the 12th century, Chiang Saen, Phayao, Nakhon Si Thammarat, and other small polities of Tai-language speakers were established with their own chieftains, typically as vassals. ca 1240 First independent polity of Tai-language speakers, Sukhothai, established by Sri Indraditya after the defeat of the Khmer garrison. 1259–1296 The beginnings of the Lan Na kingdom established by Mangrai in Chiang Saen. Gradually, he expanded the kingdom taking over adjacent polities with temporary capitals at Chiang Rai and Fang; his big prize was capturing the Mon kingdom of Haripunjaya, another xxiii\n\n05-241 (01) Front.qxd\n\nxxiv •\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:21 AM\n\nPage xxiv\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\ntemporary capital. He established a new permanent capital at Chiang Mai in 1296. 1279–1300 King Ramkhamhaeng built the Sukhothai Kingdom into a great power. A stone inscription of his was the first known written use of the Tai-language alphabet. High-quality glazed ceramics were produced commercially at Sukhothai and nearby towns. 1317–1355 For four decades, the Lan Na kingdom was a vassal state of the Mongols.\n\nAyutthaya and Other Kingdoms, 1350–1569 1351–1547 The city state Ayutthaya was founded by U Thong (Ramathibodi), its first king. He soon asserted suzerainty over smaller states in the area. The Sukhothai kingdom, after a failed war, succumbed in 1438 and became a part of the Ayutthaya kingdom. In both Ayutthaya and Lan Na royal power was built on personal relationships between ruler and ruled. What this pattern lacked was control of manpower, a fatal weakness against attacks by Burmese armies. For two centuries, the Ayutthaya kingdom was ruled by 18 kings of two dynasties. Trailok was famous for innovations in civil and military administration. Portuguese officials from Malacca opened the first European embassy in Ayutthaya for trade expansion in 1511. 1355–1526 An age of restoration of the politically strong Lan Na Kingdom. Six famous kings were among its rulers in this period. There was cultural development from Ceylonese Buddhism. The Pali Chronicle, Jinakalamali, was completed. 1526–1776 The Lan Na Kingdom declined under weak kings and became a vassal of Burma. For two centuries, Lan Na, under Burmese domination, was used as a military base for attacks against Ayutthaya and Lan Xang. 1548–1569 Chakraphat, King of Ayutthaya, successfully defended his kingdom from Burmese attacks. The forces of the next king, Suryamahin, were defeated by the Burmese armies. Ayutthaya was occupied by the Burmese and plundered in 1569.\n\n05-241 (01) Front.qxd\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:21 AM\n\nPage xxv\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xxv\n\nEmpire of Ayutthaya, 1569–1767 1569–1584 For 15 years, the Ayutthaya kingdom was under Burmese suzerainty and Maha Thammaracha, son-in-law of Chakraphat, was the vassal king. Prior to this, in 1567, King Chakaraphat, sent his grandson, Naresuan, as hostage to the Burmese capital. During the kingdom’s weakness, Cambodian forces captured the eastern territory and removed the population. 1584–1592 The independent state of Ayutthaya was restored after the armies led by Naresuan defeated the Burmese. Naresuan became king. A Burmese invasion was repulsed in a Nong Sarai battle when Naresuan killed the Burmese crown prince. He became famous for this victory. 1600s Siam (or Sayam) became the accepted name among Westerners for the Ayutthaya kingdom. Asian and European traders and Christian missionaries brought changes to Siam’s art, sculpture, and architecture. Dutch traders, who arrived in Ayutthaya, established a trading company. The British East India Company opened trading posts in Ayutthaya, Chiang Mai, and Pattani. 1629–1656 Prasat Thong reigned as king of the Ayutthaya kingdom. A Japanese embassy was opened in the kingdom in 1634. 1656–1688 A period of preeminence of the Ayutthaya kingdom due to its large territory, and extensive trade, under the reign of King Narai. A French ambassador and Catholic missionaries arrived, sent by Louis XIV, King of France. The French East India Company began operations in Ayutthaya. King Narai signed a Treaty of Alliance with France in 1686 and French garrisons were established in the kingdom capital and at Mergui. 1688–1758 Phetracha became king and arranged the ouster of foreign troops. Some missionaries were imprisoned temporarily. King Borommakot reigned for 25 years with success. He strengthened Buddhism and governmental administration. 1767 Three Burmese armies overcame the defenses of the Ayutthaya kingdom. The city of a million persons was destroyed and burned. Population and plunder moved to Burma.\n\n05-241 (01) Front.qxd\n\nxxvi •\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:21 AM\n\nPage xxvi\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\nBangkok Empire, 1767–1932 1767–1782 A resurgent Siamese kingdom was established by Taksin who became king and reigned from his capital at Thonburi. Rival kings and chiefs on the northeast and south became vassals. A Siamese army led by Thong Duong and his brother Bunma conquered Vientiane and brought back to Siam the two sacred images, Emerald Buddha and Phrabang Buddha. Lan Na became a vassal of Siam in 1775 after the defeat of the Burmese garrison with Taksin’s help. 1782–1808 General Thong Duong (later called Rama I) became the Siamese king and initiated the Chakri dynasty. He built a new capital for the kingdom at Bangkok. Rama I organized much construction and directed the completion of a definitive text, Tipitaka, of the Buddhist scriptures. The attempted invasions of five Burmese armies were defeated by the Siamese. Rama I also arranged the Three Seals Law Code, a reformulation of previous laws from the Ayutthaya period. Two Burmese attempted invasions of Lan Na were defeated with aid from the Siamese. Vassal King Kavila was confirmed as ruler of the entire northern area (former Lan Na) by Rama I. Ramakian, a Siamese version of the famous Hindu epic, Ramayana, was translated and set to verse. 1809–1824 Siam was ruled by Rama II (Loetla), who was known for his literary works. 1824–1851 Siamese King Rama III (Nangklao) stabilized the nation by overcoming rebellions in the east and south. He strengthened Buddhism. The 1826 Burney treaty with Great Britain was signed. Siam was powerful and prosperous with trade and added vassal states and territories. 1833–1944 Both Baptist and Presbyterian missions were founded in Siam. An American, Dan Bradley, M.D., the first medical doctor, arrived and began practicing medicine. Bradley led in creating the first Tai-language newspaper to be published in Siam. The first school with instruction in both English and the Tai language was opened by American missionaries. 1851–1868 King Mongkut became king. A scholar of European languages and a variety of disciplines, he established friendly relations with European states. He saw the necessity of possible sacrifices to pre-\n\n05-241 (01) Front.qxd\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:21 AM\n\nPage xxvii\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\n• xxvii\n\nserve Siam’s independence due to confrontations of colonizing powers. He began the process of modernizing Siam’s government and employed European advisors. The unofficial name ‘Siam’ instead of Bangkok Kingdom became official in 1856 with its use in a treaty with Great Britain. The Bowring Treaty of Commerce and Friendship was followed with similar treaties made with the United States and nine other Western nations. Mongkut led in founding The Royal Gazette. It was the first periodical in the Tai language. 1868–1888 Chulalongkorn was king for 42 years. He promoted education and opened a Siamese school in the Royal Palace.

France obtained northeast Laos, the entire east bank of the Mekong. Siam recognized the French protectorate in Cambodia, ceded to France Sayaburi and a part of Champassak, and ceded the Cambodian provinces of Battambang, Siem Reap, and Sisophon. Negotiations were extremely difficult but Chulalongkorn and his advisors enabled Siam to keep its independence. 1892–1908 King Chulalongkorn was instrumental in modernizing the Siamese government. The Belgian, Rolin-Jacquemyns, was employed as an advisor. Siamese administrative improvements resulted in an AngloFrench agreement that recognized the Kingdom of Siam. Siam’s first railroad was completed between Bangkok and Ayutthaya. The Sangha Law of Buddhism was decreed by King Chulalongkorn. 1910–1925 Vajiravudh was king of Siam for 15 years. He promoted Siamese nationalism and ordered the people to adopt surnames. His interest in writing and poetry was accompanied by wide circulation of imported novels and films. Chulalongkorn University was founded. It offered programs in medicine, civil service, and engineering. Compulsory education to the fourth grade was proclaimed. In 1918, Vajiravudh sent to Europe a military force to aid the Allies in World War I. The gesture helped later to negotiate new treaties with Western nations.\n\n05-241 (01) Front.qxd\n\nxxviii •\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:21 AM\n\nPage xxviii\n\nCHRONOLOGY\n\nThese treaties provided Siam with trade tariff autonomy an end to existing extraterritoriality. The metric system of weights and measures was adopted. 1925–1935 Prajadhipok was king of Siam for 10 years in a period when the absolute monarchy was quite unpopular.

It has abundant natural resources and a society whose relatively well-educated people reflect a mix of modern and traditional culture. Three elements are basic to societal integration, namely: a high regard for their present monarch; Buddhism, the predominant Thai religion; and self-esteem based on a strong economy and the nation’s ability historically to maintain independence when neighboring states were colonized by Great Britain and France. Thailand’s strategic location made the country a valuable ally of the United States in the Indochina war. It also offers a fascinating example of an economically undeveloped society that acquires capitalism and a market economy, and adapts to globalization. Thailand’s national capital, Bangkok, is also a world capital with headquarters of several United Nations and other international agencies. Thailand has a parliamentary government with the king as head of state.\n\nLAND AND PEOPLE Geography The area of Thailand is slightly smaller than that of France and consists of 513,000 square kilometers (approximately 200,000 square miles). The country has good soils and a monsoon climate. Thailand’s suitability for wet-rice agriculture attracted settlers prior to and during the nation’s early history. Thailand’s border countries include Burma on the west, Laos on the northeast, Cambodia on the southeast, and Malaysia on the extreme south. Much of the eastern border is the Mekong River. Most boundaries are the result of treaties required of Thailand and it neighbors by Britain and France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 1\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n2 •\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 2\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTopography and water drainage divide Thailand into four natural regions. The Southern Region consists chiefly of a long peninsula called the Isthmus of Kra, which is shared with Burma on the west. There is a short coastline on the Indian Ocean and a long coastline on the Gulf of Thailand/Pacific Ocean. Trade routes across the peninsula contributed to the early development of this region. The terrain is chiefly rolling and mountainous and large rivers are absent. Natural resources include forestry products and tin mining. There are also fisheries, coconut plantations, and rubber production. Tourism is also active. The Northern Region has low mountains with a north-south orientation that are part of the Himalayas. In both the river valleys and the broad plain farther south, wet-rice agriculture prevails. Its several rivers come together in the southern part of the region to create the headwaters of the Chao Phraya River, which is an important resource for transportation and irrigation. The Northeast (Isan) Region is mostly a plateau with rolling low hills and small lakes and has only fair soils. While there are monsoon rains with flooding, the region experiences a long dry season. The red porous soils do not retain moisture very well with a limiting impact on crop production. The Central Region is an area with normally sufficient rainfall and alluvial soils so that it is the chief part of Thailand where rice is produced for both domestic consumption and export. The Chao Phraya River, which drains south into the Gulf of Thailand, along with a complex network of canals and two lesser rivers, sustains an agricultural economy and provides waterways for moving people and goods. The region includes Bangkok, the nation’s capital, which is the center of a large metropolitan area and an extensive economic trading system. Climate Thailand has a humid tropical climate. Monsoons are an important weather factor. In the summer, warm humid air arrives from the southwest with much rainfall. In November through January, cool dry air arrives from the northeast. Normal rainfall amounts to 230 to 250 centimeters (90 to 100 inches) annually. The Northern, Northeast, and Central Regions of the country have a tropical savanna climate with\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 3\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 3\n\nmarked wet and dry seasons and rainfall that amounts to about one half of that in the southern region. Natural Resources Thailand is fortunate to have extensive fertile land, which has been and continues to be utilized for the production of rice and other crops. Large annual exports of rice have given Thailand the name “rice bowl of Asia.” A large agricultural population is a source of cheap labor for urban manufacturing and other Thai industry. Thousands of low-skilled Thai are employed abroad. In earlier centuries, this huge manpower resource made the state the dominant military power in Southeast Asia. Fish are a basic part of the diet of agricultural villagers. The annual catch, including the part marketed, is estimated at more than three million tons. Forests have in the past been a very prominent natural resource for villagers. For the central government, historically, forests provided valuable exports chiefly to China and included elephant tusks, spices, gems, precious metals, and other items. From the mid- to late-1980s, forests meant a place for thousands of farm families to carve out a farm. Since less than 25 percent of the kingdom’s total land remains in forests, further removal of trees is now illegal. Population National censuses have been taken in the nation at 10-year intervals for the past nine decades. The population of Thailand in the year 2000 was 60,606,947 by national census count. The nation’s annual growth rate between 1990 and 2000 was 1.05 percent, which is a significant decline from the annual two percent and larger growth rates of previous decades. Census figures also revealed considerable variation in growth rates among the four regions. The provinces near Bangkok, the national capital, were among the fastest-growing areas. Language (Tai) The word Tai refers to both a language family and to persons who speak one or more of the Tai-language dialects. A particular Tai dialect,\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n4 •\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 4\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSiamese, was the native tongue of a majority of the occupants of the Central Region of Thailand. They gained power there in 1351 and a Tai kingdom was established. Siamese gradually became more widely used, especially in government administration. When compulsory education was instituted in the early 20th century, Siamese was more widely adopted and gradually replaced other dialects. Today, the national language is called Thai.\n\nHISTORY Early History The origins of the nation of Thailand are shrouded in prehistory. Findings of archaeologists indicate that there were human settlements in Southeast Asia (SEA) as early as 6,000 years ago. Writers of prehistory have indicated the likely migrations for centuries of several ethnic peoples into lightly settled SEA from what today is south China. These included the Mon, the Khmer, and the Tai. When the earlier SEA kingdom of Funan’s power declined, Mon peoples established kingdoms there. Visiting missionaries in the eighth century brought Buddhism, which the Mon Dvaravati kingdom adopted. Sanskrit place-names in today’s Thailand reflect other enduring Indian influences including art and literature of the Mon. In the 10th century, Dvaravati and its diverse peoples was conquered by and incorporated into a Khmer empire centered on Angkor (Cambodia today). During the seventh to the 13th centuries, several Tai-speaking tribal groups emerged. Present-day Thai inhabitants are descended from the mix of the early peoples who settled in SEA including the Mon, the Khmer, inhabitants who preceded these migrations, and others. Meanwhile, on the narrow southern peninsula that constitutes the western border of the Gulf of Thailand, the city-state Tambralinga (Nakhon Si Thammarat today) was settled by Indian immigrants early in the first century C.E. They obtained control of the trade routes between India and Indochina across the isthmus. Theravada Buddhism, introduced there by the Mon, was adopted. After a successful conquest, the states of the isthmus were incorporated into a Tai kingdom in the 13th century.\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 5\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 5\n\nEarly Kingdoms Sukhothai (ca 1240–1438)\n\nBy the 13th century there were numerous principalities with Tai chiefs throughout the central and southern areas of Southeast Asia. Culturally and politically, these Tai leaders assimilated ideas of organization, administration, and political power from the previous empires of the region that had largely weakened and declined. As a result of successful military conflict with forces of the Angkor empire, a small kingdom named Sukhothai emerged in the central part of SEA. Sri Indraditya and his son Ban Muang were the first kings (reigned ca 1240–1279). Another son, Ramkhamhaeng (reigned 1279–1298), the third king, was reputed to be very successful in battle. During his 19-year reign, the Sukhothai kingdom grew to a large size and included principalities that were sometimes fought over with other Tai kingdoms. Ramkhamhaeng’s reign is remembered as one of the first in which the Siamese language in written form appeared. He provided a written record of much of his reign and is credited with the design of the Tai alphabet. Lan Na (1259–1774)\n\nThe pattern of conquest and control among small principalities on the Southeast Asian mainland in the 13th century and in later times is illustrated in the life and work of Mangrai (reigned 1259–1317), a Tai prince who founded the Lan Na Kingdom. Some five centuries later the state he developed became a part of Thailand. After becoming ruler of Chiang Saen in 1259, he was able to extend his rule over neighboring principalities including Haripunchai, a large Mon kingdom. Mangrai also founded a number of cities to which he brought farm and crafts families from the vassal principalities. The Northern Region of Thailand today corresponds chiefly to the territory of Lan Na. The language and culture of the people there retain much of its earlier character. An Early Tai Golden Age: Ayutthaya (1351–1767) Ayutthaya was a famous and powerful kingdom of the Tai-speaking people. Its capital city (Ayutthaya) was situated on the Chao Phraya\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n6 •\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRiver in what today is central Thailand. The kingdom was founded in 1351 by U Tong, descendant of a wealthy merchant in Lopburi who married into a royal family. U Thong reigned with the name Ramathibodi I and established the Buddhist religion within his realm. He also compiled a law code and tried to unify a kingdom that included partially independent principalities and tributary provinces owing allegiance to the king. Within one hundred years, Ayutthaya was the strongest power in Southeast Asia. From the Angkor kingdom, concepts of the role of the monarch were adopted. These included notions of the king as having universal power and being lord of the land. Agriculture, especially wet-rice agriculture, flourished. Any surplus was sold abroad, and Ayutthaya became a center of economic activity. Contacts with Western nations in the 16th and 17th centuries focused chiefly on trade. A major threat to the security of Ayutthaya was the rising power of Burma in the 16th to 18th centuries. In a two-year invasion, Burmese forces captured Ayutthaya in 1767. The inhabitants and treasures were moved to Burma; the city was destroyed and left in ruins. During the more than 400 years of its existence, the kingdom had a succession of 33 rulers. Some of the more famous kings were Ramathibodi I, Borommatrailokanat, Chakraphat, Naresuan, and Narai. (See also kingship, monarchy.) The Bangkok Era and Siam: The Rattanakosin Era King Taksin reigned (1768–1782) in a capital at Thonburi. During this 15-year period he overcame rivals and made secure the entire territory of the former kingdom of Ayutthaya. He was supported by Chinese merchants who aided with needed supplies. His army also assisted in freeing Lan Na from Burmese control, and made it a vassal state. Thong Duang, one of two Tai-speaking army generals who were key to these military successes, ascended the Thai throne after Taksin was deposed. He reigned as Yot Fa, but was designated Rama I by a descendant. He chose Bangkok as capital of the kingdom. This book uses the term Bangkok Era for this period; it is called Rattanakosin. King Rama I (reigned 1782–1809) demonstrated a variety of strengths including that of military leader, effective administrator, and creator of language arts. He also restored the Buddhist religion and con-\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 7\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 7\n\nstructed many new monasteries. To make manpower more available for the four-month service in the kingdom, Rama I initiated a system in which all freemen were tattooed with a label. To promote national unity in the kingdom, Rama I revived previous state ceremonies that reflected respect for the king, Buddhism, and loyalty to the state. He initiated the Chakri dynasty, which continues in Thailand today. King Rama III (1824–1851) also ascended the throne in a peaceful manner, a pattern that continued through the Chakri dynasty. Coping with Western interests in Southeast Asia became an important concern of the kingdom during his reign. The treaty signed in 1826 with Great Britain dealt with national boundaries and trade. This began a constructive pattern for future kingdom relations with the West. The agreement resulted in a considerable increase in trade. The many Western ships arriving annually at Bangkok brought increased contacts with the West. Major difficulties overcome by King Rama III concerned vassal states on the eastern border and in the peninsula region. Mongkut became King Rama IV (1851–1868) of the Chakri dynasty after 27 years as a Buddhist monk. While in the monastery, he found expression for his brilliant mind and great curiosity. He learned foreign languages, read extensively, and gained knowledge of Western societies. Mongkut handled negotiations with visiting diplomats from European nations effectively, compromising when necessary to preserve the kingdom’s independence from the grasp of colonialism. It was in the Burney treaty of 1856 that the name Siam began to be used instead of Bangkok Kingdom. Chulalongkorn, Rama V (reigned 1868–1910), is the only former king of Siam whose memory is honored in a celebration that occurs annually (on October 23). When well into his reign in the mid-1880s, Chulalongkorn launched a two-pronged plan of government reform with increased royal power. With the death of Suriyawong (Chuang Bunnag), who was regent and a powerful adviser, the king was able to take back power held by the Bunnag family. The accomplishment of his goals was gradual but complete by the early 20th century, when a new governmental administration was established throughout the kingdom. In addition, a national army was created for which there was male conscription. A series of taxes on the lucrative domestic and export trade of Siam, which were enacted in the 1880s, resulted in substantial enhancement of royal government revenues, but spelled the end of the tributary system\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n8 •\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nand related powers of local lords and chieftains. In the face of threats of colonization by Great Britain and France, King Chulalongkorn succeeded in maintaining the independence of the kingdom. However, this came at a huge cost to Siam. Treaties reveal the large losses of territory granted to the colonies of these two European powers. Vajiravudh or Rama VI (reigned 1910–1925), created a quasi-military organization, the Wild Tigers, which gave him a personal following and helped increase a sense of Siamese nationalism. King Vajiravudh saw personal identity and national defense as aspects of the Siamese kingdom worth fighting for. In 1921 he led the enactment of a law instituting compulsory education in the primary grades. Desired new treaties with European and other foreign powers were negotiated in the mid1920s with the aid of an American foreign advisor, Francis Sayre. The onerous inequalities imposed previously by these foreign powers were removed. Prajadipok, Rama VII (reigned 1925–1935), came to the throne when the monarchy was in low esteem. Political activities in Bangkok were on the rise. Young men with advanced degrees from the West were openly discussing political topics including criticism of monarchical rule. A peaceful revolution in 1932 by military personnel and civilian leaders changed the Siamese monarchy from an absolute to a constitutional one. Prajadipok abdicated in 1935. Bhumibol Adulyadej, Rama IX (reign began in 1946), became king at the death of his brother, Ananda, the previous king. During the first four years of his reign, he completed studies in Switzerland. Returning to Siam, he was crowned king in 1950. Through his efforts, the monarchy of the kingdom has a very high status. King Bhumibol is held in high esteem by the Thai people. Constitutional Era Military Ascendance\n\nA coup d’etat in 1932, led by civilians and army officers, changed the Siamese monarchy from an absolute to a limited one. The promoters of this significant event had been educated in Europe where they had studied of democratic institutions. During the period 1932–1988 the prevailing pattern was government by military officer cliques led by an army general. Cohesion within the army as an organization and its pre-\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 9\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 9\n\nmier role as guardian of the nation contributed to its ascendancy. A constitution and a national assembly were two elements begun by the 1932 coup promoters that were continued in most successive national governments. The two regimes of Phibun Songkhram (1938–1944) and (1948–1957) left their mark on Thai history. His dismissal of the parliament in 1938 signaled the return of absolute power, this time by the army. Measures introduced by the Phibun regime included increased government control of the economy and society at the expense of the Chinese who were dominant in business activities. In 1939 Phibun arranged the change in the country’s name from Siam to Thailand. During the 1941–1944 Japanese occupation of Thailand in World War II, the West considered Phibun a Japanese ally. His regime ended in 1944 when it appeared that Japan was losing the war. Phibun’s second term as prime minister (1948–1957) began with a coup and absolute army control after a four-year period of civilian regimes. In the late 1940s and in the 1950s, as Thailand faced a threat of communism, Phibun forged a military alliance with the United States that brought the kingdom military assistance. In exchange, Thailand permitted the United States to establish bases there for air war against North Vietnam. Military and other U.S. aid to Thailand during the 1950s and 1960s totaled about US$2 billion. Phibun initiated a pattern of shared power with the administrative bureaucracy that facilitated control of the kingdom. Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat was next in seizing power and became prime minister in 1958. Sarit established agencies with capable technicians to implement economic development plans. His regime was followed by that of general Thanom Kittakachorn when Sarit died in 1963. Both were authoritarian administrators, and dissent was suppressed. Radio and television were used to rationalize and strengthen military dominance. For at least the past three decades, Thailand had been undergoing marked change. The Thanom government was confronted by rapid population growth, gradual industrialization, better educated youth, an emerging middle class, insurgency in the countryside, and the spread of Western democratic ideals. A student uprising in 1973, which was joined by residents and the city police of Bangkok, ended the Thanom regime. King Bhumibol Adulyadej led in restoring order and appointed a new prime minister. Businessmen in Bangkok city\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n10 •\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nwelcomed this fall of military power and actively participated in a return of parliamentary rule. Parliament was restored in 1974, but three subsequent short-lived democratic governments (1973–1976) were ended by an army coup in 1976. The regimes of General Kriangsak Chomanan (1977–1980) and General Prem Tinsulanonda (1980–1988) responded somewhat to the pressure in Thai society for democratic institutions. Members of the parliament cooperated with Prem in securing desired legislation, another step toward Thai democracy. Competent technocrats and members of the parliament were included in his Council of Ministers. The many refugees flooding in from Laos and Cambodia were problems faced by Prem. Toward Democracy\n\nThe short regime of Chatchai Choonavan (1988–1991) as prime minister was unique in two respects. First, his administration was fully elected. His appointed cabinet consisted mostly of businessmen members of parliament instead of mainly military officers or bureaucrats. Second, it revealed the growing influence of provincial businessmen politicians and economic development in the provinces. Later, provincial politicians became national party leaders. Their power developed through patronage politics. To a large extent, this change reflected globalization of the Thai economy and its rapid growth. New cuts in the military budget reflected the weakened military role in Thai politics. A move to restore military control was led by General Suchinda Kraprayoon in 1991 and he became prime minister. Suchinda’s ascendency was opposed in massive street demonstrations with leaders from the growing middle class. In the ensuing riot, army troops killed or injured numerous persons. The king again played a crucial role in ending the crisis. During 1991–2001, there were seven different Thai national governments. Three of these came to power through the rural electorate that voted for the candidate who paid the most. Two regimes were deposed by pressure from Bangkok business interests and middle-class activists who brought charges of regime corruption and lack of leadership to deal with serious national problems. Urgent needs during this period included decentralization of the government, urban traffic congestion, farmer protests, and the severe economic crisis of 1997–1998.\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 11\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 11\n\nThere were two regimes in which Chuan Leekpai was the prime minister (1992–1995 and 1997–2001). Both followed elections in which 12 or more political parties participated. In the second, businessmen held the important ministries, since Chuan and his party had reorganized to include both Bangkok business interests and provincial concerns. In 1957, his administration attempted to implement the financial and political reform measures that accompanied the economic recovery loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Amendments to the constitution were passed by the parliament, which lowered the voting age from 20 to 18, affirmed the equality of women, and prohibited members of the cabinet and National Assembly from holding monopolistic concessions with government or state bodies. Chuan’s administrations were confronted by demonstrating farmer groups numbering in the thousands. From a semipermanent encampment near the government administrative offices, they militated effectively and obtained policy changes regarding the rights and financial needs of farmers. The new constitution enacted by parliament in August 1997 embodied significant political reforms. It was the crowning achievement of an effort by a broad spectrum of reform groups. Three new commissions were created, one each for fair and clean elections, a constitutional court, and to counter corruption. Together with subsequent legislation, passage of this constitution has made Thailand a more open and democratic society. A decade of change that preceded the adoption of the 1997 constitution was marked by wide participation of new social groupings in public affairs with ongoing discussions about political and constitutional reform. The Thai media provided assistance to the urban activists seeking public support in favor of political reform. Elections for the National Assembly were held in 2000 and 2001, the first to be organized and monitored by the election commission. The 2000 Senate election seated 200 members, while the House of Representatives election in 2001 seated 500 members. The January 2001 election for the House of Representatives brought a new prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, head of the Thai Rak Thai Party. He attracted the votes of numerous rural residents. Thaksin barely survived when he was tried in the constitutional court for allegedly misreporting his total financial assets as is required of elected officials. His rise to power was aided by his image as a successful businessman even though he used bribes to obtain business concessions from politicians in government.\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n12 •\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 12\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHis election also demonstrates the increased role of business in the Thai political power structure.\n\nECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT For the first 500 years of its long history, Thailand’s economy was based chiefly on wet-rice agriculture. The great majority of the population were agricultural villagers who were largely self-sufficient in food and other necessities. In these early years, rice and other home grown foods were extracted by the king from the rice growers, which along with high value forest products were essential staples for the monarch, his support staff, and the royal armies. In addition, these products were traded by the royal court for weapons and wealth, providing the king with status and political control. Since the late 1500s, the Royal Thai leadership has utilized trade as a foundation for economic growth. In the early 1800s, China’s demand for forest products collapsed while at the same time areas in Asia that had been colonized became new markets for rice export. Rice production was increased in the alluvial plain of the Central Region and the river valleys in the North Region, beginning Thai commercial rice agriculture. Trade contacts with negotiators from the West in the 1850s marked Thailand’s early entry into global export markets. In 1850, most of Thailand was forested land and the kingdom’s population was less than five million. The following century saw a continuing deforestation and the creation of farm settlements. The opening and cultivation of new rice lands eventually had the effect of a 25-fold increase in the production of rice. Other commercial farm products increased also. While rice became the main engine of wealth accumulation in the first half of the 1900s, by the 1970s, nearly 70 percent of Thai farmers were commercial producers. Beginning in 1955, the government set up a rice monopoly that bought the farmers’ rice for export sale. The price paid to rice producers was 15 to 35 percent below the export price. This was a type of tax revenue obtained from producers of surplus rice that the national government used to finance infrastructure projects for urban industrial development. This tax mechanism represented a transfer of wealth from the producers of surplus rice to the urban economy until it was ended in 1986.\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 13\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 13\n\nIn the late 1950s, Thai government leaders began to promote economic growth in the private sector to replace the previous state enterprise approach. Five-year economic plans were developed by economists and political leaders, the first of which was published in 1961. As a result, industrialization advanced in Thailand and major urban banks were influential in allocating credit toward economic growth. Technocrats became influential in economic policy making in the 1980s. Together with key business leaders and bankers, they moved Thailand toward an export-oriented economy. Multinational firms in Thailand, especially Japanese, changed their focus from labor-intensive products and resource-based industries to technology-based products such as auto parts, computer parts, and electronic goods. By 1986, Thailand’s export economy had eclipsed the previous one that was predominantly agrarian. Sino–Thai businessmen were crucial to growth in the economy. A spectacular economic boom developed in Thailand with four main elements. First, expanding existing firms and many new ones produced goods and services sold to richer countries. Labor for urban industry was adequately supplied by migrants from up-country farms. Second, Thai firms found a niche in globalized business, drawing on and adapting their experience in the home market, and applied that expertise abroad. Third, new sources of capital led to expansion by both Bangkok and provincial businessmen who invested in infrastructure and services that facilitated development. Fourth, economic growth fed excess investment in real estate and financial services in Bangkok and vicinity. In addition, consumer goods production expanded in response to the growing incomes of the population. As in earlier times, the huge expansion of industry, population, wealth, financial services, retail services, political power, and amenities has been concentrated in Bangkok and adjacent provinces. When compared to the smaller growth in the provinces, an extreme imbalance is revealed. While an economic slowdown was evident by 1994, the Thai government failed to respond. Three factors stand out. Government expenses exceeded income, the Thai currency (the baht) became over-valued from its tie to the U. S. dollar, and large amounts of foreign money entered the kingdom without well-managed investment. In 1997, a severe economic crisis struck Thailand. Finance companies, banks, and corporations suffered large losses from which many did not recover. The IMF quickly\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n14 •\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 14\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\narranged loans and supervised adjustments in economic policy. A recovery period began in 1999, which continues. Manufactured exports have returned to the mid-1990s level, but annual growth is slower. Other impacts of the economic crisis include major foreign ownership of banks, financial assets, export industries, and retail companies. Further, the Thai economy is more open than before; the earlier dominant role of local capitalism has been replaced to a large extent by multinational capitalism.\n\nSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT Rural Society\n\nFor centuries, the agricultural village has been the center of social life for the people of Thailand. While urban society has been growing for the past century, the village as a social center remains. The village defines one’s identity and each member feels a loyalty to it. Festivals, entertainment, educational and religious activities take place at the village Buddhist temple grounds, a sort of community center. Celebrations of Buddhist religious holidays and ceremonies when young men enter the Buddhist monkhood continue to be occasions for social interaction. Nevertheless, Thai agricultural villages have changed. They no longer have the sameness of earlier centuries. In addition to farming, there may be other economic activities there such as brick making, etc. While villagers formerly cooperated in the planting and harvesting of rice and in many other ways, such cooperative events have declined considerably. Villagers have also begun to participate in the political campaigns of local office seekers. The movement of many young men and women out of villages in the past 25 years to work in the cities and send home remittances to their families has aided in improving the standard of living. In addition to providing aid to parents, migrating to the city is seen by young people, especially women, as a way to become upto-date or modern (thansamy). The rural kin group continues to have meaning for its members. Most of those who go to the city return to the village later to settle down, or return temporarily to help with planting and harvesting of rice. That the thousands of Thai agricultural villages can serve as a place of security was demonstrated in 1997–1998 at the time when Thailand experienced a severe economic crisis. Between one\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 15\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 15\n\nand two million of the unemployed workers in urban industry returned to their home villages. Urban Society\n\nThe official 2000 Census of Population indicated that the urban population has shown significant growth since 1990, while the very large rural population has declined slightly. Of the kingdom’s 76 provinces, five had an urban population that was more than one half of the provincial total and in another five the urban part was at least one third of the total. Beyond that, 14 provinces contained at least one large city of 50,000 or more. Rapid economic growth in the 1985–1994 period brought higher living standards. It also created a consumer culture among middle-income Thais. With high salaries and easy credit, many Thais bought a car and a home in the suburbs. As more white-collar workers attained middle class status, they became more active in politics. Thailand is still male-dominated, but women have made gains. They outnumber men in government civil service and in the teaching profession. Women are active in nearly all professions and urban careers. However, in corporate settings, they have less opportunity for advancement. Television emerged in the 1980s as a main broker of a new Thai culture. Widespread TV viewing of Thai-produced dramas has become a nightly occurrence. The dramas emphasize both popular Thai novels and Thailand’s position as an important part of the world. Other urban traits projected in the dramas include prosperity, modernity, individualism, and globalism, which together constitute a unique perspective of the Thai identity. An interesting contrast in world views was reported by Thai social scientists Pasuk Phongpachit and Chris Baker. They pointed to a rural Thai world view that embraces ideas of “other-oriented” social relationships, a profound religious faith and spiritual life, an inner harmony, and feelings of contentment with life. The urban Thai view is “self-oriented,” chiefly focused on individual happiness, material comforts, seeking pleasure and recognition, and neglectful of religious values. Education\n\nIn the premodern period when Thailand was a rural society, almost the only education available was to study at the village Buddhist temple.\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n16 •\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 16\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThere, boys and young men who were interested could learn to read, work with numbers, and study the Buddhist scriptures. Beginning in the 20th century, the Thai national government has pursued a vigorous program of educational development. By midcentury, elementary schools had been established in the kingdom’s agricultural villages as well as in all towns and cities and completion of six grades was compulsory for all children. Today, compulsory attendance is required for preschoolers, as well as those at primary, lower, and upper secondary levels, to complete 12 grades. Higher education and its availability has been expanding since the late 19th century. The emphasis initially was on training for medicine, law and agriculture, and for the civil service. Today, the numerous Thai colleges and universities offer the whole range of academic studies found in Western countries. In addition to bachelors’ degree programs, masters’ and doctoral degree programs are offered in many fields. Significant research is conducted at many universities, government agencies, and private organizations. Social Problems\n\nThailand faces a variety of social problems including prostitution, drug and alcohol abuse, crime, corruption, increased divorce, mental health needs, justice shortcomings, and environmental pollution and degradation. Social and income inequities have increased. Between 1981 and 1994, the average income of the top 10 percent of the kingdom’s households tripled, while the incomes of the lowest 10 percent hardly changed at all. In manufacturing, many migrant female workers are exploited with very low pay and poor or unsafe working conditions.\n\nSUMMARY AND OUTLOOK Among the beneficial impacts of the 1997–1998 Thai economic crisis was a noticeable trend for working-class people to be innovative in selfemployment and become entrepreneurial. This has been apparent in the production, processing, and marketing of new foods. In the middle class, adjustments and coping strategies include an increase in mutual assistance between individuals and families, sharing of information, and building social relationships. The growth of consumer associations\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 17\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 17\n\nis an example. In both the working and middle classes, patterns of consumption reflect budgeting and use of more products from Thailand and fewer imported Western goods. The Economy\n\nWhile the Thai economy has become more open, the current focus of a limited number of exports produced and marketed globally by Thai branches of multinational corporations will most likely continue. However, strong influences will persist in advocating local Thai-owned capitalism and resisting the transfer of economic power to international corporations or dominant countries. To some extent this transfer has already occurred and was tied to International Monetary Fund pressures for policy reforms in government finance, law, and social programs. The continued production of rice and other food crops in Thailand, while widely taken for granted, is an absolutely basic essential in order to provide food for the Thai population. While enhanced irrigation facilities for rice growing and intensive farming techniques to improve yields are urgent, dynamism in agriculture will probably come, as in the past, from the responsiveness and adaptability of Thai farmers rather than from government programs. Technology\n\nThailand’s weakness in technology became apparent in the 1994 economic slowdown, which revealed the great need for upgrading technological capabilities in Thai commodity production and marketing. Thailand has the capacity to generate or acquire new technology and is responding to this challenge. The response to the technology training gap in the kingdom’s educational system has begun in the Ministry of Education, which is upgrading both the instruction of and emphasis on technology. Universities with engineering programs as well as vocational schools can be expected to respond to this challenge. Politics and Civil Society\n\nThe use of elections to create new governments is a remarkable achievement after nearly 60 years of new governments occurring by military coup. When governments obtain legitimacy by succeeding in\n\n05-241 (02) Intro.qxd\n\n18 •\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:26 AM\n\nPage 18\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nan election there is a distinct gain in societal stability. The long movement toward democracy in the Thai body politic has achieved a degree of success since 1992. The 1997 Constitution was a significant accomplishment in this regard, giving a powerful boost to the opening of politics to new ideas and middle-class activism. Thailand is in a critical period in which it faces an array of competing interests regarding the nature of the social and political changes needed and the means to bring them about. The growing activism in Thai civil society bodes well for further democratic advance. A warning for the future, however, was expressed by King Bhumibol Adulyadej in December 2001. In his address to top government officials and other Thai leaders, he asserted that Thailand was in a major decline and faced possible catastrophe. He cautioned that when government officials use one set of ethical standards for their own behavior and a different set of standards for others, they lose the moral authority essential to successful leadership.\n\n05-241 (03) A-Da.qxd\n\n9/8/05\n\n5:32 AM\n\nPage 19\n\nThe Dictionary\n\n–A– ABBOT (CHAO AWAT). The head monk of a Buddist temple compound (wat). His appointment is made at a higher level of the Buddhist monkhood (sangha), of which he is a part. He has administrative, custodial, clerical, and possibly disciplinary tasks. He selects subordinates, supervises instruction, and is responsible for the functioning of the temple in accordance with approved procedures. Buddhism and temple activities have a major role in village life. Thus, the abbot is often a key community leader in village affairs such as road repair, water improvement, and agricultural development. Abbots are appointed largely on the basis of their seniority and popularity with laymen and other Buddhist monks. Abbots are also found in higher levels of the Buddhist monkhood, and serve as religious administrators of a district, province, or region. These positions correspon"
