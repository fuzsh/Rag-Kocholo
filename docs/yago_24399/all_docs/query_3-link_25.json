        "text": "\"Suwanni Sukhontha (Thai: สุวรรณี สุคนธา) was a nom de plume of Suwanni Sukhonthiang (Thai: สุวรรณี สุคนธ์เที่ยง) (1 March 1932, Phitsanulok (พิษณุโลก)3 February 1984, Bangkok), a Thai novelist and SEATO Literary Award recipient.\n\nLife\n\nSuwanni was a daughter of Mr Yoi (Thai: ย้อย) and Mrs Taeng-on (Thai: แตงอ่อน), having one elder sister.\n\nShe completed a primary education at Changwat Phitsanulok's Chaloem Khwan Female School (โรงเรียนเฉลิมขวัญสตรี), and spent two years for a secondary education at Bangkok's Pho Chang Campus (วิทยาลัยเพาะช่าง) of Rajamangala University of Technology (มหาวิทยาลัยเทคโนโลยีราชมงคล) Rattanakosin prior to continuing a higher education at Silpakorn University's (มหาวิทยาลัยศิลปากร) Faculty of Painting, Sculpture and Graphic Arts. In 1951, Bhumibol Adulyadej awarded her a Bachelor of Arts (Painting).\n\nAfter her education, Suwanni was instated as a government teacher at the Bangkok's School of Arts for three years, and ;later a permanent lecturer attached to Silpakorn University, respectively.\n\nSuwanni married Thawi Nanthakhwang (Thai: ทวี นันทขว้าง), a lecturer and artist at the same University. The couples issued four children, and later divorced. Following divorce, Suwanni spent her all life with a long-time friend, Sirisawat Phanthumasut (Thai: ศิริสวัสดิ์ พันธุมสุต).\n\nOn 3 February 1984, while Suwanni was doing marketing at the outskirts of Bangkok, she was fatally assaulted by a young ruffian who wanted to steal her car for purchasing narcotic. Her dead body was discovered left in the dense grasses wayside. When she was murdered, she was 52.\n\nLiterary works\n\nWhile being a lecturer at Silpakorn University, Suwanni started composing novels. In 1965 came her first short story, \"Chot Mai Thueng Puk\" (Thai: จดหมายถึงปุก; \"A Letter to Puk\") together with using a penname \"Suwanni,\" which was later changed to be \"Suwanni Sukhontha\" upon suggestion of Pramun Unhathup (Thai: ประมูล อุณหธูป), editor of Siam Rat Weekly.\n\nHer first novel, \"Sai Bo Yut Sane Hai\" (Thai: สายบ่หยุดเสน่ห์หาย; \"Fragrance Still Shone, Even Though Midmorning Came\"), met with a jubilant welcome which influenced her to retire from the office at Silpakorn University and spend her full time to compose novels. Suwanni also started publishing and became an editor of \"Lalana Magazine\" (Thai: นิตยสารลลนา; \"Female Magazine\") until her last day.\n\nThe distinctive points of Suwanni's literary works were that her characters were mere ordinary people with hearts, souls, feelings and passions like the readers, this was contrary to those of other writers at that time. Moreover, her novels usually reflected the down sides of the human beings, and the language she used was common but satirising the Thai society.\n\nMany of Suwanni's novels and her own colourful life have been made into television series and motion pictures for many times, the most notable is 2002 version of \"Once in a Blue Moon\" in which Sinjai Plengpanich (สินจัย เปล่งพานิช) played as her.\n\nAwards\n\nMany of her works brought her a number of awards, including:\n\n\"Khao Chue Kan\" (Thai: เขาชื่อกานต์; \"His Name is Kan\")  Best SEATO Literary Award in 1970;\n\n\"Duai Pik Khong Rak\" (Thai: ด้วยปีกของรัก; \"With the Wings Of Love\"), \"Phra Chan Si Nam Ngoen\" (Thai: พระจันทร์สีน้ำเงิน; \"Once in aa Blue Moon\") and \"Soi Saeng Daeng\" (Thai: สร้อยแสงแดง; \"Vermilion Bracelet\")  National Book Weeks' Awards in 1973, 1976 and 1981, respectively.\n\nNotable novels\n\n\"Bang Thi Phrung Ni Cha Pian Chai\" (Thai: บางทีพรุ่งนี้จะเปลี่ยนใจ; \"Maybe I would Change my Mind Tomorrow\")\n\n\"King Fa\" (Thai: กิ่งฟ้า; \"Legs of Heaven\")\n\n\"Khao Chue Kan\" (Thai: เขาชื่อกานต์; \"His Name is Kan\")\n\n\"Khon Roeng Mueang\" (Thai: คนเริงเมือง; \"She Who Cheers the City\")\n\n\"Kao-i Khao Nai Hong Daeng\" (Thai: เก้าอี้ขาวในห้องแดง; \"A White Chair in a Red Room\")\n\n\"Khwam Rak Khrang Sut Thai\" (Thai: ความรักครั้งสุดท้าย; \"Last Love\")\n\n\"Khuen Ni Mai Mi Phra Chan\" (Thai: คืนนี้ไม่มีพระจันทร์; \"No Moon on this Night\")\n\n\"Khuen Nao Thi Luea Dao Pen Phuean\" (Thai: คืนหนาวที่เหลือแต่ดาวเป็นเพื่อน; \"Stars are my Only Friends on this Cold Night\")\n\n\"Chamon\" (Thai: จามร; \"Chamon\")\n\n\"Duean Dap Thi Sop Tha\" (Thai: เดือนดับที่สบทา; \"Night Falls at Sop Tha\")\n\n\"Dok Mai Nai Pa Daed\" (Thai: ดอกไม้ในป่าแดด; \"A Flower in a Sun Forest\")\n\n\"Duai Pik Khong Rak\" (Thai: ด้วยปีกของรัก; \"With the Wings Of Love\")\n\n\"Thale Rue Im\" (Thai: ทะเลฤๅอิ่ม; \"The Sea Can Never Be Enough\")\n\n\"Thong Phrakai Saet\" (Thai: ทองประกายแสด; \"Gold which Sparkles with Coral\")\n\n\"Mae Si Bangkok\" (Thai: แม่ศรีบางกอก; \"She is the Grace of Bangkok\")\n\n\"Ngu Rong Hai, Dok Mai Yim\" (Thai: งูร้องไห้ ดอกไม้ยิ้ม; \"A Crying Snake and a Smiling Flower\")\n\n\"Phra Chan Si Nam Ngoen\" (Thai: พระจันทร์สีน้ำเงิน; \"Once in a Blue Moon\")\n\n\"Phrung Ni Chan Cha Rak Khun\" (Thai: พรุ่งนี้ฉันจะรักคุณ; \"And I Will Love You Next Day\")\n\n\"Phu Ying Khon Nan Chue Sela\" (Thai: ผู้หญิงคนนั้นชื่อเสลา; \"Her Name is Sela\")\n\n\"Rueang Khong Ket\" (Thai: เรื่องของเกด; \"Story of Ket\")\n\n\"Rueang Khong Nam Phu\" (Thai: เรื่องของน้ำพุ; \"The Story of Nam Phu\")  The story of her son, Wongmueang Nanthakhwang (Thai: วงศ์เมือง นันทขว้าง) or Nam Phu (Thai: น้ำพุ) who died of heroin overdose at the age of 18.\n\n\"Luk Rak\" (Thai: ลูกรัก; \"My Beloved Son\")\n\n\"Sai Bo Yut Sane Hai\" (Thai: สายบ่หยุดเสน่ห์หาย; \"Fragrance Still Shone, Even Though Midmorning Came\")\n\n\"Soi Sawat\" (Thai: สร้อยสวาท; \"Chains of Love\")\n\n\"Sam Ngao\" (Thai: สามเงา; \"Three Shadows\")\n\n\"Suan Sat\" (Thai: สวนสัตว์; \"The Zoo\")  The book has been translated into Japanese and is now used in Thai secondary education and tertiary education as book for education.\n\n\"Roi Saeng Daeng\" (Thai: ร้อยแสงแดง; \"Hundreds of Crimson Glows\")\n\n\"Thanon Sai Rommani\" (Thai: ถนนสายรมณีย์; \"A Road to Amusement\")\n\n\"Wan Wan\" (Thai: วันวาร; \"Yesterday\")\"\n\n[Quelle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suwannee_Sukhontha. -- Zugriff am 2011-12-07] \"At the same time, the Khmer Rouge(ខ្មែរក្រហម) retreated west, and it continued to control certain areas near the Thai border for the next decade. These included Phnom Malai, the mountain areas near Pailin (ក្រុងប៉ៃលិន) in the Cardamom Mountains (ជួរភ្នំក្រវាញ) and Anlong Veng (ស្រុកអន្លុងវែង) in the Dângrêk Mountains (ជួរ​ភ្នំ​ដងរែក).[32]\n\nThese Khmer Rouge bases were not self-sufficient and were funded by diamond and timber smuggling, military assistance from China channeled by means of the Thai military, and food from markets across the border in Thailand.[33]\n\n[...]\n\nEastern and central Cambodia were firmly under the control of Vietnam and its Cambodian allies by 1980, while the western part of the country continued to be a battlefield throughout the 1980s, and millions of landmines were sown across the countryside. The Khmer Rouge, still led by Pol Pot, was the strongest of the three rebel groups in the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, and received extensive military aid from China, Britain and the United States and intelligence from the Thai military.\n\nIn an attempt to broaden its support base, the Khmer Rouge formed the Patriotic and Democratic Front of the Great National Union of Kampuchea in 1979. In 1981, the Khmer Rouge went as far as to officially renounce Communism[32] and somewhat moved their ideological emphasis to nationalism and anti-Vietnamese rhetoric instead. However, some analysts argue that this change meant little in practice, because, as historian Kelvin Rowley puts it, \"CPK propaganda had always relied on nationalist rather than revolutionary appeals\".[35]\n\nAlthough Pol Pot (ប៉ុល ពត) relinquished the Khmer Rouge leadership to Khieu Samphan (ខៀវ សំផន) in 1985, he continued to be the driving force of Khmer Rouge insurgency, giving speeches to his followers. Journalists such as Nate Thayer who spent some time with the Khmer Rouge during that period commented that, despite the international community's near-universal condemnation of the Khmer Rouge's brutal rule, a considerable number of Cambodians in Khmer Rouge-controlled areas seemed genuinely to support Pol Pot.[36]\n\nWhile Vietnam proposed to withdraw in return for a political settlement excluding the Khmer Rouge from power, the rebel coalition government as well as ASEAN, China and the US insisted that such a condition was unacceptable.[32] Nevertheless, in 1985 Vietnam declared that it would complete the withdrawal of its forces from Cambodia by 1990 and did so in 1989, having allowed the government that it had instated there to consolidate and gain sufficient military strength.[35]\n\nAfter a decade of inconclusive conflict, the pro-Vietnamese Cambodian government and the rebel coalition signed a treaty in 1991 calling for elections and disarmament. In 1992, however, the Khmer Rouge resumed fighting, boycotted the election and, in the following year, rejected its results. It now fought the new Cambodian coalition government which included the former Vietnamese-backed Communists (headed by Hun Sen) as well as the Khmer Rouge's former non-Communist and monarchist allies (notably Prince Rannaridh). In July 1994 a \"Provisional Government of National Union and National Salvation of Cambodia\" was established by Khmer Rouge authorities.\n\nThere was a mass defection in 1996, when around half the remaining soldiers (about 4,000) left. In 1997, a conflict between the two main participants in the ruling coalition caused Prince Rannaridh to seek support from some of the Khmer Rouge leaders, while refusing to have any dealings with Pol Pot.[35][36] This resulted in bloody factional fighting among the Khmer Rouge leaders, ultimately leading to Pol Pot's trial and imprisonment by the Khmer Rouge. Pol Pot died in April 1998. Khieu Samphan surrendered in December.\n\nOn December 29, 1998, the remaining leaders of the Khmer Rouge apologized for the 1970s genocide. By 1999, most members had surrendered or been captured. In December 1999, Ta Mok and the remaining leaders surrendered, and the Khmer Rouge effectively ceased to exist. Most of the surviving Khmer Rouge leaders live in the Pailin area or are hidden in Phnom Penh.\"\n\n[Quelle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_rouge#Fall. -- Zugriff am 2011-11-30]\n\n\"Since at least 1978, several lawsuits have been filed against the companies which produced Agent Orange, among them Dow Chemical, Monsanto, and Diamond Shamrock.\n\nHy Mayerson of the law firm The Mayerson Law Offices, P.C. was an early pioneer in Agent Orange litigation, working with renowned environmental attorney Victor Yannacone in 1980 on the first class-action suits against wartime manufacturers of Agent Orange. In meeting Dr. Ronald A. Codario, one of the first civilian doctors to see afflicted patients, Mayerson, so impressed by the fact an M.D. would show so much interest in a Vietnam veteran, forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on Agent Orange and the effects of dioxin on animals and humans to Codario's office the day after he was first contacted by the doctor.[50] The corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on the U.S. government.[51]\n\nThe Mayerson Law Offices, P.C., with Sgt. Charles E. Hartz as their principal client, filed the first Agent Orange class action lawsuit, in Pennsylvania in 1980, for the injuries soldiers in Vietnam suffered through exposure to toxic dioxins in the Agent Orange defoliant.[52] Attorney Hy Mayerson co-wrote the brief that certified the Agent Orange Product Liability action as a class action, the largest ever filed as of its filing.[53] Hartz's deposition was one of the first ever taken in America, and the first for an Agent Orange trial, for the purpose of preserving testimony at trial, as it was understood that Hartz would not live to see the trial because of the brain tumor that began to develop while he was a member of Tiger Force, Special Forces, and LRRPs in Vietnam.[54][55] The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans lead expert, Dr. Ronald A. Codario, M.D., including about 100 hundred articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade, as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed, what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans, and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reaction.[50]\n\nIn 1984, the class-action suit was settled out of court for $180 million; slightly over 45% of this was ordered to be paid by Monsanto alone.[56][57] Many veterans who were victims of Agent Orange exposure were outraged the case had been settled instead of going to court, and felt they had been betrayed by the lawyers. \"Fairness Hearings\" were held in five major American cities, where veterans and their families discussed their reactions to the settlement, and condemned the actions of the lawyers and courts, demanding the case be heard before a jury of their peers. Federal Judge Julius Weinstein refused the appeals, claiming the settlement was \"fair and just\". By 1989, the veterans' fears were confirmed when it was decided how the money from the settlement would be paid out. A totally disabled Vietnam veteran would receive a maximum of $12,000 spread out over the course of 10 years. Furthermore, by accepting the settlement payments, disabled veterans would become ineligible for many state benefits that provided far more monetary support than the settlement, such as food stamps, public assistance, and government pensions. A widow of a Vietnam veteran who died of Agent Orange exposure would only receive $3700.[58]\n\nIn 2004, Jill Montgomery, a spokesperson for Monsanto, said Monsanto should not be liable at all for injuries or deaths caused by Agent Orange, saying: \"We are sympathetic with people who believe they have been injured and understand their concern to find the cause, but reliable scientific evidence indicates that Agent Orange is not the cause of serious long-term health effects.\"\"\n\n[Quelle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_orange#US_veterans_class_action_lawsuit_against_manufacturers. -- Zugriff am 2011-11-30]\n\n\"Situated in Wimbledon, the Buddhapadipa temple (วัดพุทธปทีป) was the first Thai Buddhist temple to be built in the UK. It is home to monks and nuns, but welcomes visitors of any faith to view the grounds and temple as long as they are respectful.\n\nIts white exterior walls are put into contrast by the red and gold colours of the roof and decorations of the frames of the windows and doors.\n\nInside the temple hall, the walls are covered with paintings showing the life of the Buddhafrom his birth to his death. There are pictures of his birth in Lumbini (Nepal), his renunciation, his enlightenment, and finally his death. The murals were painted by artists Chalermchai Kositpipat and Panya Vijinthanasarn in a surreal style using brilliant colors that, at first glance, seems very unlike classical Thai painting. However, they revive the tendency found in traditional Thai mural paintings to situate episodes from Buddhist myth in scenes populated with figures and objects from contemporary life. The murals were started in the 1980s, and among the many figures in the scenes are portraits of Mother Theresa and Margaret Thatcher, as well as the temple's patrons and the artists themselves.\n\nThe main doorway leading out from the shine room has a grand painting of the Buddha meditating to reach enlightenment, directly above it. On the right side of the Buddha are the angry figures of Mara's army, trying to disrupt the Buddha, and distract him from reaching enlightenment. The name 'Mara' means delusion. On the left side of the Buddha is the army of Mara looking more subdued and respectful. They are like this because the Buddha has reached enlightenment, and they could not distract him. Just above the doorway is the figure of Nang Thoranee, the earth goddess. During the climax of Mara's assault, the Buddha touches the earth with his hand. The earth goddess appears to bear witness to the merit the Buddha has accumulated in his many lives, and the water she squeezes from her hair washes away the armies of Mara.\n\nAlso in the room is a great shrine built for the Buddha. There are three statues of the Buddha in it; the back one is black, the middle statue is gold, and the front statue is green and smaller than the other two. These statues are surrounded by candles and other decorations.\n\nAlso within the grounds are a house, pond, and several bridges. In the gardens signs are posted, each sign giving a message of wisdom to those who stop to read them.\"\n\n[Quelle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wat_Buddhapadipa. -- Zugriff am 2011-12-07]\n\n\"Queen Rambhai Barni of Siam (Thai: รำไพพรรณี ;RTGS: Ramphaiphanni), formerly Her Serene Highness Princess Rambhai Barni Svastivatana (Thai: รำไพพรรณี สวัสดิวัตน์ ;RTGS: Ramphaiphanni Sawatdiwat; born 20 December 1904  22 May 1984), was the wife and Queen Consort of King Prajadhipok of Siam.\n\nEarly life\n\nHer Serene Highness Princess Rambhai Barni Svastivatana was born on 20 December 1904, to Prince Svasti Sobhana the Prince of Svastivatana Visishta (a son of HM King Mongkut and Princess Piyamawadi - :เจ้าคุณจอมมารดาเปี่ยม) and Princess Abha Barni Gaganang. She was given the nickname by courtiers as Thanying Na or Princess Na (Thai: ท่านหญิงนา). At the age of 2 she entered the Palace, as with tradition to be 'given' to a Queen for education; in Princess Rambhai Barni's case it was HM Queen Saovabha (เสาวภาผ่องศรี), wife of HM King Chulalongkorn (her aunt), from then on she lived at Dusit Palace.\n\nAfter the death of King Chulalongkorn in 1910, She was moved to the Grand Palace, where she studied at the Rajini School (or Queen's School) set up by Queen Saovabha. During this period she became very close with her cousin and Queen Saovabha's youngest son HRH Prince Prajadhipok Sakdidej, the Prince of Sukhothai. In 1917, after completing his studies abroad and his tradition monkhood, Prince Prajadhipok and Princess Rambhai Barni were married at Bang Pa-In Palace, under the blessings of her new brother-in-law; HM King Vajiravudh. the couple lived at the Prince's Bangkok residence the Sukhothai Palace.\n\nQueen\n\nIn 1925, King Vajiravudh died without leaving any issue, the crown was then passed on to his younger brother and heir. Princess Rambhai Barni's husband ascended the throne as King Prajadhipok (or Rama VII), she was immediately given the appropriate title of Queen Consort of Siam. Prajadhipok followed his brother's abandonment of polygamy and instead had one Queen. Both the King and the Queen received modern (and therefore European) educations in their youths, once they inherited the throne they set about modernizing the institution of monarchy copying European dress and customs.\n\nThe King and Queen preferred to spend most of their time away from Bangkok, preferring instead to stay at the summer beach resort town of Hua Hin in Prachuap Khiri Khan province at a Summer Palace, which was called Klai Kangwon (Thai: วังไกลกังวล) (or Far from Worries), which they had built. It was here in June 1932 that the Royal couple was told of the Revolution instigated by the Khana Ratsadon (การปฏิวัติสยาม พ.ศ. 2475 or การเปลี่ยนแปลงการปกครองสยาม พ.ศ. 2475), which demanded of the absolutist King a constitution for the people of Siam. The event would be a turning point for Rambhai Barni and her husband as the absolute rule of the House of Chakri was replaced by a constitutional regime.\n\nIn 1933, the Royal couple left Siam, for Europe where the King was due to have an eye operation in England. Despite the long distance the King continued to fight with his government back in Bangkok, through letters and telegrams. The fight came to a head when the government refused to accept Prajadhipok's ancient power of pardon. The King first threatened, but when he was ignored decided to on 2 March 1935 to abdicate his throne, he was succeeded by his nephew Ananda Mahidol. The Royal Couple settled in Surrey, first at Knowle House then at Glen Pammant.\n\nLife in Exile\n\nThe couple moved again to Vane Court, the oldest house in the village of Biddenden in Kent. they led a peaceful life there, gardening in the morning and the King writing his autobiography in the afternoon. In 1938 the royal couple would move again to Compton House, in the village of Wentworth in Virginia Water, Surrey. The couple had no children, but adopted the infant son of one of Prajadhipok's deceased brothers. (The stepson, Prince Jirasakdi, would later serve as a RAF fighter pilot during the Battle of Britain. He died on duty in 1942.)\n\nDue to active bombing by the German Luftwaffe in 1940, the couple again moved, first to a small house in Devon, and then to Lake Vyrnwy Hotel in Powys, Wales, where the former King suffered a heart attack. King Prajadhipok eventually died from heart failure on 30 May 1941.\n\nLeader of the Resistance\n\nAfter the King's death, the Queen became more involved in politics. In December 1941 the Japanese Empire invaded and occupied Thailand, the Japanese government forced the Thai government to declare war on both Great Britain and the United States of America. The Free Thai Movement (ขบวนการเสรีไทย) set up partially by Thai exiles living abroad; the movement included many diplomats, students and members of the Royal Family.\n\nThe Queen and her brother, HSH Prince Subhasvastiwongse Snith Svastivatana, made clear their Free Thai sympathies and used their connections to assist like-minded students in organising a resistance movement in Britain. She was among the four women who volunteered for non-military tasks with the Free Thai. Despite not being an official member, the Queen assisted the movement through fund raising and lobbying influential Ministers.\n\nReturn and death\n\nIn 1949, the Queen was invited to return to Thailand, bringing with her the King's ashes. After her return she continued to carry out many official duties on behalf of the new King Bhumibol Adulyadej. She spend the rest of her life at the Sukhothai Palace. Dying in 1984 at the age of 79.

The project is interesting because it was renegotiated at the instigation of the Thai government. Its outcome suggests that the overall aid relationship is more important to Thailand than a single project, and that Thai aid planners are willing to forgo particular benefits in favor of the more general benefit of maintaining the flow of Japanese aid.\n\nThe loan for the port project was included in the Eleventh Yen Loan package agreed upon in September 1984. Negotiations for the loan had been concluded 1983, and the design phase had been started by late autumn of that year. Port construction was due to begin in 1984, with completion scheduled for 1988.\n\nNegotiations for the project hit a snag in December 1983. The Minister of Communications, under whose jurisdiction the portworks were to be carried out, asked for a suspension of the Laem Chabang loan, and the Port Authority of Thailand accordingly notified the companies that had been short-listed for the engineering survey to postpone submission of their designs. In early January he notified the NESDB [National Economic and Social Development Board / สำนักงานคณะกรรมการพัฒนาการเศรษฐกิจและสังคมแห่งชาติ] that his ministry intended to cancel the engineering design portion of the Laem Chabang loan already agreed to in the previous loan package and to call for a new port design to triple its capacity to twelve berths. He also proposed cancellation of planned negotiations for the construction phase of the project, due to start in early 1984.\n\nThe minister publicly argued that OECF [Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund / 海外経済協力基金] loans hurt the Thai construction industry by favoring Japanese firms. The ministry was also unhappy with Japanese-funded construction of Don Muang Airport [ดอนเมือง] in Bangkok, and linked its displeasure over the course of that project with the decision on the Laem Chabang loan. Consequently, it announced it would seek alternative sources for funding the project. The NESDB agreed to suspend the loan negotiations pending official notification to the OECF, and the prime minister called for a meeting in late January to consider the situation.\n\nThe Japanese response was firm. Tokyo threatened the Thai Cabinet with the possibility that cancellation of the port loan would endanger future loans. One Japanese official commented that the cancellation would amount to breach of contract. As such, it would be legitimate grounds for cancelling the entire annual loan package.\n\nThe dilemma the NESDB faced in the Laem Chabang case illustrates the potential difficulties of playing principal to two separate agents. On the one hand, the Japanese government, represented by the embassy, was concerned that an already-agreed to loan be carried forward. Muscat notes that the donor was adamantly against cancellation of any ESDP project funded by yen loans. On the other hand, the prime minister, who usually supported the NESDB during this period, faced the issue of keeping a coalition government intact. Party rivalries tended to revolve around disputes between military factions and individual party leaders. Such rivalries were clearly present in the cabinet Prem had put together in 1983 and which tackled the Laem Chabang cancellation issue: while Prem was able to appoint technocrats to many cabinet posts, four other parties were represented as well. Nevertheless, the communications minister was a member of a small party (his post was its only portfolio) and a rival military faction.\n\nThe ministers argument against the loan was weak, as well. Party leaders were interested primarily in government projects for their pecuniary benefits. Thus, he did not cancel the loan for the obvious reason that the port project was too expensive and not worth the estimated cost of construction, but because it was too small. His alternative plan was to increase the number of berths in the project threefold. Had he argued for cancellation of port construction entirely he might have found allies among opponents of the entire Eastern Seaboard development scheme. That his interest in the loan lay elsewhere meant he could not.\n\nThe Japanese position was strengthened by the fact that the Thai Ministry of Finance favored continuation of the project under OECF financing. The ministry had not officially notified the OECF of the proposed cancellation. In fact, in early January it went ahead with its request that a loan for the ports construction be included in the upcoming Eleventh Yen Loan. On January 26 the Eastern Seaboard Development Committee decided to overturn the communications ministrys proposal to cancel the Laem Chabang loan.\n\nThe Eastern Seaboard Development Committees decision to overrule the communications ministry was conditioned by two factors: Thailands dependence on Japanese aid for development financing in the Eastern Seaboard and the Thai Ministry of Finances opposition to cancellation. The first conditioned the second. Japan could compel Thai acquiescence by threatening to cancel future tending if the port loan did not go through, because its threat was credible. By the 1980s Japan supplied up to two-thirds of all bilateral aid to Thailand in any given year. More important, from the Eastern Seaboard Development Committees point of view, Japan was far and away the largest donor of aid to the Eastern Seaboard. Five projects in the Eastern Seaboard, in addition to the Laem Chabang construction project, were included in the short list for Japanese lending in 1984. If Thailand cancelled the Laem Chabang loan, it ran the risk of endangering the entire Eastern Seaboard program. The NESDB, the Eastern Seaboard Development Committee, and the finance ministry all had stakes in the resolution of the dispute in Japans favor. The communications ministrys particularistic action, in contrast, ran the risk of cutting off future benefits for other Thai government players. The convergence of interests between the Japanese government and the financial authorities in the Thai government created a powerful alliance that the communications ministry could not oppose successfully. The ministry found itself in a weak position because it was unable to find alternative sources of finance for the project by the January 26th meeting.\n\nThe lack of alternative aid sources undoubtedly figured in the finance ministrys calculations to meet the Japanese demand, and weakened the communications ministrys ability to hold out for a better deal. Given the choice between concessional aid terms in a period of increasing external debt and arguments about the impact of Japanese aid on the Thai construction industry in general, it is not surprising that the finance ministry sided with Japan. Accommodation in this case was accomplished by quashing the objections of the dissident ministry.\"\n\n[Quelle: Potter, David M. <1961 - >: Japan's foreign aid to Thailand and the Philippines. -- New York : St. Martin's, 1996. -- 206 S. : Ill. ; 22 cm. -- ISBN 0-312-12563-1. -- S. 145ff. -- Faire use]\n\n\"Since HIV/AIDS was first reported in Thailand in 1984, 1,115,415 adults had been infected as of 2008, with 585,830 having died since 1984.[1] 532,522 Thais were living with HIV/AIDS in 2008.[1] In 2009 the adult prevalence of HIV was 1.3%.[2] CIA World Factbook has listed the 2009 statistics for HIV prevalence by country, and according to these, Thailand has the highest prevalence of HIV in Asia.[3] In 2010 the press reported that Thailand \"has the highest HIV prevalence in Southeast Asia\".[4][5]\n\nPrevalence\n\nAfter Thailands first case of HIV/AIDS was reported in 1984, the incidence of infection increased steadily in the country. In 1991, the government adopted a strategy to combat the disease, and in recent years, the number of new infections has declined. However, HIV prevalence had remained the same from 2003 to 2005 (1.4 percent) with more people receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART).[6]\n\nThailands early cases of HIV/AIDS occurred primarily among men who have sex with men (MSM). The virus then spread rapidly to injecting drug users (IDUs), followed by prostitutes. Between 2003 and 2005, there were increases in HIV prevalence from 17 to 28 percent among MSM in Bangkok. In addition, prevalence among IDUs still ranges from 30 to 50 percent. In 2005, more than 40 percent of new infections were among women, the majority of whom were infected through intercourse with long-term lovers. Money and a low level of condom use due to womens activity in the illegal sex trade are factors responsible for the spread of HIV among this group. Although the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Thailand has declined, the epidemic has moved to the general population and there is a greater need to match prevention efforts with recent changes in the epidemic.[6]\n\nAs of 2011, IDUs in Thailand are the among the most vulnerable to HIV/AIDS and number between 40,000-97,300.[7]\n\nSeveral factors put Thailand at risk of a resurgence of HIV/AIDS cases. Awareness of HIV status is low. For example, 80 percent of HIV-positive MSM had never been tested or thought they were HIV-negative, according to a 2006 study cited by UNAIDS. A large portion of IDUs  35 percent according to one study  use nonsterile injecting equipment. Other research has noted an increased trend of erratic condom use by female prostitutes. In some cases, women selling sex reported using a condom in just over one half of commercial sex encounters. Finally, premarital sex, once taboo, is increasingly common among young Thais, only 20 to 30 percent of whom use condoms consistently, according to the United Nations Development Program.[6]\n\nThailand has a high tuberculosis (TB) burden, with a 63 new cases per 100,000 people in 2005, according to the World Health Organization. Approximately 7.6 percent of TB patients are co-infected with HIV, HIV-TB co-infections pose a challenge to providing treatment and care for both diseases.[6]\n\nNational response\n\nThailands initial response to the epidemic was weak.[citation needed] However, since the National AIDS Control Program was moved from the Ministry of Public Health to the Office of the Prime Minister in 1991, the countrys HIV/AIDS prevention efforts have been recognized[by whom?] as among the worlds most successful. The Ninth National Economic and Social Development Plan (20022006) emphasized the adoption of a human-centered approach to bring about reform through the public health system, especially the health care system. Thailands policy on AIDS has worked toward educating its citizens on HIV/AIDS and prevention measures; developing a system of medical, public health, social, and consultation services to improve the quality of life of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); developing medical biotechnology, medicine, and AIDS vaccination research; and working with all parties involved, such as the government and private sector, to prevent and alleviate the HIV/AIDS situation.[6]\n\nThailands HIV/AIDS activities include conducting a public education campaign targeting the general public and most-at-risk populations (MARPs), improving sexually transmitted infection (STI) treatment, discouraging men from visiting sex workers, promoting condom use, and requiring sex workers to receive monthly STI tests and carry records of the test results.[6][8]\n\nIn 2004, Thailand received a third-round grant from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to prevent HIV/AIDS among IDUs and increase care and support for them. Objectives of the grant are to train peer leaders within IDU communities; create harm-reduction centers; educate health care providers, police, prison staff, and policymakers; and provide peer-based outreach, education, counseling, referral services, and HIV testing support. The U.S. Government provides one-third of the Global Funds contributions.[6]\n\nSince the change of government in 2006, Thailand has reinvigorated its HIV/AIDS prevention and control efforts. In 2007, Thailand adopted a three-year strategic plan that focuses on scaling up HIV prevention efforts, particularly for people most likely to be exposed to HIV and for difficult-to-reach populations. Early in 2007, the government announced that it was breaking patents on drugs to treat HIV. Thus, the government continues to strive for achieving universal access to treatment. As of the end of 2006, 88 percent of HIV-infected people were receiving ART, according to UNAIDS.[6]\n\nDespite the efforts put into anti-HIV strategies, it is estimated that condom use remains quite low: in 2010, the Department of Disease Control (DDC) estimated that 60% of sexually active teenagers, more than 50% of MSM and 40% of sex workers do not regularly use condoms.[9]\"\n\n[Quelle: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS_in_Thailand. -- Zugriff am 2013-01-25]\n\n\"Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục (Vietnamese pronunciation: [ŋo ɗîɲ tʰùkp]) (6 October 1897  13 December 1984) was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế, Vietnam and a member of the Ngô family who ruled South Vietnam in the years leading up to the Vietnam War. He was the founder of Dalat University.\n\nWhile Thục was in Rome attending the second session of the Second Vatican Council, the 1963 South Vietnamese coup overthrew and assassinated his younger brother Ngo Dinh Diem (1901 - 1963), who was president of South Vietnam. Thục was unable to return to Vietnam and lived the rest of his life exiled in Italy, France, and the United States. During his exile, he was involved with Traditionalist Catholic movements and consecrated a number of bishops without the Vatican's approval for the Palmarian (Iglesia Cristiana Palmariana de los Carmelitas de la Santa Faz) and Sedevacantist movements. As a result, he was excommunicated by and reconciled with Holy See a number of times.\n\nFamily\n\nNgô Đình Thục was born in Huế to an affluent Roman Catholic family as the second of six sons born to Ngô Đình Khả (1850 - 1925), a mandarin of the Nguyễn dynasty who served Emperor Thành Thái (1879  1954) during the French occupation of Vietnam.\n\nThục's elder brother, Khôi, served as a governor. Khôi was reportedly buried alive by the Việt Minh right after the August Revolution in August 1945 for having been a mandarin of the French-controlled Emperor Bảo Đại's (1913 - 1997) administration. Three other brothers, Diệm, Nhu and Cẩn, were all politically active. Diệm had been Interior Minister under Bảo Đại in the 1930s for a brief period, and sought power in the late 1940s and 1950s under a Catholic anti-communist platform as various groups tried to establish their rule over Vietnam. Diệm led a coup, overthrowing the emperor and becoming president of South Vietnam in 1955. Diệm (1901 - 1963), Nhu (1910 - 1963) and Cẩn (1911 - 1964) were all later assassinated during the 1963 South Vietnamese coup.\n\nCardinal François Xavier Nguyễn Văn Thuận (19282002) was Thục's nephew.\n\nCareer in Vietnam\n\nAt age twelve, Thục entered the minor seminary in An Ninh. He spent eight years there before going on to study philosophy at the major seminary in Huế. Following his ordination as a priest on 20 December 1925, he taught at the Sorbonne. He was selected to study theology in Rome, Italy, and returned to Vietnam in 1927 after having been awarded three doctorates from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome in philosophy, theology, and Canon law. He then became a professor at the College of Vietnamese Brothers in Huế, a professor at the major seminary in Huế, and Dean of the College of Providence. In 1938, he was chosen by Rome to direct the Apostolic Vicariate at Vĩnh Long. He was consecrated a bishop on 4 May 1938, being the third Vietnamese priest raised to the rank of bishop.\n\nIn 1950 Diệm and Thục applied for permission to travel to Rome for the Holy Year celebrations at the Vatican but went instead to Japan to lobby Prince Cường Để (1882 - 1951) to enlist support to seize power. They met Wesley Fishel, an American academic consultant for the U.S. government. Fishel was a proponent of the anti-colonial, anti-communist third force doctrine in Asia and was impressed by Diệm. He helped the brothers organise contacts and meetings in the United States to enlist support.[1]\n\nWith the outbreak of the Korean War and McCarthyism in the early 1950s, Vietnamese anti-communists were a sought-after commodity in the United States. Diệm and Thục were given a reception at the State Department with the Acting Secretary of State James Webb, where Thục did much of the talking. Diệm also made links with Cardinal Francis Spellman (1889  1967), the most politically influential cleric of his time. Spellman had studied with Thục in Rome in the 1930s and became one of Diệm's most powerful advocates. Diệm managed an audience with Pope Pius XII (1876  1958) in Rome with his brother's help. Spellman helped Diệm to garner support among right-wing and Catholic circles. As French power in Vietnam declined, Diệms support in America, which Thục helped to nurture, made his stock rise. Bảo Đại made Diệm the Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam because he thought Diệm's connections would secure funding.\n\nDiệm's rule\n\nIn October 1955, Diệm deposed Bảo Đại in a fraudulent referendum organised by Nhu and declared himself President of the newly proclaimed Republic of Vietnam, which then concentrated power in the Ngô family, dedicated Roman Catholics in a Buddhist majority country. Power was enforced through secret police and the imprisonment and torture of political and religious opponents. The Ngôs' policies and conduct inflamed religious tensions. The government was biased towards Catholics in public service and military promotions, as well as the allocation of land, business favors and tax concessions.\n\nBuddhist unrest and downfall of Diệm\n\nMain articles: Huế Phật Đản shootings and Xá Lợi Pagoda raids\n\nIn May 1963, in the central city of Huế, where Thục was archbishop, Buddhists were prohibited from displaying the Buddhist flag during Vesak celebrations commemorating the birth of Gautama Buddha, when the government cited a regulation prohibiting the display of non-government flags at Thục's request. A few days earlier, Catholics were encouraged to fly Vatican flags to celebrate Thục's 25th anniversary as bishop. Government funds were used to pay for Thục's anniversary celebrations, and the residents of Huếa Buddhist strongholdwere also forced to contribute. These double standards led to a Buddhist protest against the government, which was ended when nine civilians were shot dead or run over when the military attacked. Despite footage showing otherwise, the Ngôs blamed the Việt Cộng for the deaths, and protests for equality broke out across the country. Thục called for his brothers to forcefully suppress the protesters. Later, the Ngôs' forces attacked and vandalised Buddhist pagodas across the country in an attempt to crush the burgeoning movement. It is estimated that up to 400 people were killed or disappeared.\n\nDiệm was overthrown and assassinated together with Nhu on 2 November 1963. Ngô Đình Cẩn was sentenced to death and executed in 1964. Of the six brothers, only Thục and Luyện survived the political upheavals in Vietnam. Luyện was serving as ambassador in London, and Thục had been summoned to Rome for the Second Vatican Council. After the Council (196265), for political reasons and, later on, to evade punishment by the post-Diệm government, Archbishop Thục was not allowed to return to his duties at home and thus began his life in exile, initially in Rome.\n\nExile\n\nThục moved to Toulon, France, where he was assigned a confessional in the cathedral until about 1981. He at least once concelebrated the Mass of Paul VI (the new rite of Mass promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1969) in the vernacular. One author claims Thục served at the Mass of Paul VI as an acolyte several times.\n\nConvinced of a crisis devastating the Roman Catholic Church and coming under the increasing influence of sedevacantist activists, Thục consecrated several bishops without a mandate from the Holy See. In December 1975 he went to Palmar de Troya, where he ordained Clemente Domínguez y Gómez (1946 - 2005)who claimed to have witnessed an apparition of the Blessed Virgin Maryand others, and the following month he consecrated Dominguez and four followers as bishops. In May 1981 Thục consecrated a French priest, Michel-Louis Guérard des Lauriers (1898 - 1988), as bishop. Des Lauriers was a Dominican, an expert on the dogma of the Assumption and advisor to Pope Pius XII, and former professor at the Pontifical Lateran University. In October 1981, he consecrated two Mexican priests and former seminary professors, Moisés Carmona (of Acapulco) and Adolfo Zamora (of Mexico City). Both of these priests were convinced that the Papal See of Rome was vacant and the successors of Pope Pius XII were heretical usurpers of papal office and power. In February 1982, in Munich's Sankt Michael church, Thục issued a declaration that the Holy See in Rome was vacant, intimating that he desired a restoration of the hierarchy to end the vacancy. However, his newly consecrated bishops became a fragmented group. Many limited themselves essentially to sacramental ministry and only consecrated a few other bishops.\n\nThục may have performed other consecrations besides the five bishops at Palmar de Troya and the three sedevacantists in 1981. There are claims that he consecrated two priests, Luigi Boni and Jean Gerard Roux, in Loano in Italy on 18 April 1982, but a Dr. Heller, of Una Voce in Munich, has said that Thục was with him in Munich on that date. The bishops consecrated by Thục proceeded to consecrate other bishops for various Catholic splinter groups, many of them sedevacantists. Thục departed for the United States at the invitation of Bishop Louis Vezelis (1930 - 2013), a Franciscan former missionary priest who had agreed to receive Episcopal Consecration by the Thục line Bishop George J. Musey, assisted by co-consecrators, Bishops Carmona, Zamora and Martínez, in order to provide bishops for an \"imperfect council\" which was to take place later in Mexico in order to elect a legitimate Pope from among themselves.\n\nThục died at the monastery of the Vietnamese American religious Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix (Dòng Đức Mẹ Đồng Công) on 13 December 1984, at Carthage, Missouri, aged 87.\"\n\n[Quelle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng%C3%B4_%C4%90%C3%ACnh_Th%E1%BB%A5c. -- Zugriff am 2016-08-24]"
