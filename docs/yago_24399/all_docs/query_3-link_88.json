        "text": "This article describes changes in the 'religious geography' of Thailand's Malay-dominated southern provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat since the 1960s. These have been led by a range of religious entrepreneurs returning to these parts of southern Thailand from the Middle East and South Asia. We begin by conceptualizing local Islamic diversity in ways that move beyond binaries such as the new and old schools (kaum muda-kaum tua) and accept that the vast majority of Malays in southern Thailand remain conservative, rural traditionalists. We provide relevant details about the background, overseas educational influences and the forms of religious activism pursued by leaders of local modernist, reformist and revivalist religious franchises. We also point out the different strategies pursued by these religious entrepreneurs and that the operational centres for many of these movements are located in Yala. This article argues that Middle Eastern influences in southern Thailand have been exaggerated, while South Asian influences have been overlooked, and that the Malaysian State of Kelantan has played an important role in diversifying the religious geography of these southern provinces.\n\nAlthough historically Sufi orders (turuq, sg. tariqa) have been an important element of Thailand’s Islamic traditionalist majority, these regrettably have received almost no scholarly attention. The reasons for this neglect are complicated. Beyond (non-negligible) methodological constraints and difficulties in attaining access to some orders not open to outsiders, a double marginalization is observable. In addition to being located at the periphery of Southeast Asia’s “Islamic arc” (Tagliacozzo 2013), those studying Islam in Thailand have focused on but more has been written on religiously motivated violence, and the (revivalist) Tablighi Jama’at and (reformist) Salafiyyah which developed mass followings during the twentieth century, than the turuq they replaced. These range from those violently resisting Bangkok’s project of assimilation in the far-south since 2014, to the revivalist Tablighi Jama’at and reformist Salafiyyah that are now found throughout the country. This paper redresses such neglect by presenting a historical anthropology of Thai tariqa based on fieldwork among sufi orders in Thailand since late 2012. I begin by introducing some of the most important sufi personalities who, during the twentieth century, returned from educational sojourns in the Middle East, Java, and Kelantan, with permission (ijazah) to initiate or revive a range of sufi orders in Central Thailand (Ayutthaya and Bangkok), the Southern Thai-speaking upper south (Pang-nga Bay and Songkhla), and parts of the Malay-speaking far-south (Narathiwat). I describe ways in which orders widely distributed throughout the Muslim World such as the Qadriyyah, Shadhiliyyah, and Ahmadiyyah-Idrisiyyah, have been localized by Muslim communities in Thailand. I argue that successful doctrinal and ritual innovations are frequently championed by familiar people advocating and embodying something strange. The variety of localized global turuq that I present, challenge a number of assumptions about the cultural geography of Islamic diversity in contemporary Thailand.\n\nAlthough historically influenced by Theravada Buddhist for more than a millennium, Thailand’s ethnic, linguistic, and religious homogeneity has been over-asserted by state-makers, and erroneously assumed by some scholars. After descendants of Chinese immigrants, widely regarded as Thailand’s largest and most successfully assimilated ethnic minority, Malays residing south of Satun and Songkhla are over three times more numerous that the Northern Khmer of southern Isaan, its next most populous ethnic minority. Practically all Thai citizens self-identifying as Melayu are Muslims, and Islam is Thailand’s largest religious minority. Nevertheless, not all Muslims self-identify as Malays, and Islam has long been acknowledged as being anything but a monolith. In addition to being an ethnically diverse ecumene, its sectarian divisions mirror those present throughout Southeast Asia. Some surmise Thailand’s Muslims being divided between “Malay-Muslims”, and “Thai-Muslims” who are either traditionalist or reformist in orientation. This paper proposes perspectives on Thailand’s Muslim mosaic based multi-sited fieldwork among Sufi orders (Ar. turuq, tariqa [sg.]) with visible and viable followings from among the Central Thai-speaking, Southern Thai-speaking, and Malay-speaking Muslim communities. This paper seeks to articulate alternatives to the double-barreled binaries that have provided the theoretical ballast in previous explorations of Muslim ethnic and religious diversity. Whilst relevant details of these hereunto unstudied Sufi orders are provided, this paper’s considers the significance of their presence in three cultural milieu between Ayutthaya and Narathiwat over the details of the spiritual lineages (Ar. silsilah) or litanies (Ar. wird) of individual orders. Rather than where these orders have come from, I concentrate on both their adoption by Central Thai, Southern Thailand, and Malay-speaking Muslims, and the manner in which they have been adapted in ways that reflect these regional identities. Most tariqa might remain within the cultural milieu where they have been localized, but boundaries between these are far from fixed.\n\nThis paper describes the movements, personalities and processes in Thailand’s Malay dominated provinces of Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat that have led to unprecedented diversity within the ummah. Like the rest of Thai/Malay peninsula, although the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Thailand’s far-south are conservative traditionalists, the size and influence reformist Islam continues to increase. This is particularly the case among urban Malays. While the roots of reformism were sown in the 19th century by luminaries such as Syeikh Daud al-Fatani (1769-1847), and Syeikh Ahmed al-Fatani (1856-1908), the most important reformist personality in the early 20th centuries was Haji Sulong (1895-1945). Since his return from Saudi Arabia in the 1990s, Dr Ismail Lutfi Japakiya, the founding of rector of Yala Islamic University (Thailand’s first Islamic university) has emerged as the leader of Saudi style salafism. I conclude by considering the impact of the Tablighi Jama’at, a South Asian revival movement, on Islamic diversity in South Thailand since its arrival in the 1980s. A important point infrequently made in analysis of the Tablighi Jama’at is that both reformists and traditionalists are involved in this important revivalist movement.\n\nThis chapter describes how ethnic identifications, language and religion in present-day Cabetigo have been affected by the Thai and Islamic influences described in previous chapters. While the Muslims in Cabetigo are comfortably bilingual ethnic Malays who adhere to traditionalist expressions of Islam, significant religious, linguistic and ethnic diversity exists. The chapter begins by describing how reformist and revivalist movements dealt with in the previous chapter have increased religious diversity—even division—in Cabetigo. I delineate the various ways in which Muslims identify themselves, but also the factors that affect which strategic identity is chosen at any given time and place. This chapter concludes with an account of how the bilingualism in Cabetigo brought about the widespread adoption of Thai by urban Malays.\n\nThis paper is part of a historical ethnography of sufi orders (turuq) between the Thailand’s Central plains and Malay far-south. In contrast to the modernist, reformist, and revivalist Islamic movements firmly embedded in Thailand’s religious landscape, next to nothing is known about these movements, for a variety of reasons. In Thailand sufi practitioners lack the numbers found in other parts of Muslim Southeast Asia, and most sufi tariqa are now marginal to the Muslim mainstream. Although in some parts of the country some still resemble secret societies, in others they engage through websites, social media, and TV channels. I begin with a prolegomena pointing out that despite its long history in South Thailand, sufism has almost been entirely neglected by scholars. In four substantive sections, I consider the personalities and processes that between the late 1800s and 1920s contributed to the Ahmadiyyah-Idrisiyyah established a presence in the Thai/Malay Peninsula. Although my interests are predominantly in connections with Patani/Pattani, I also reveal that Ahmadiyyah influence reached Bangkok through another curiously – and circuitous – route which highlights the importance its influence in the Hijaz as late as the 1940s"
