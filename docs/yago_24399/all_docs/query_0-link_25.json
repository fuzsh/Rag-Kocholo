        "text": "Seen Above: King Prajadhipok of Siam with his wife Queen Rambhai Barni in England.\n\nOn May 30th (2024), the Thai people honor the 83rd anniversary of the death of King Prajadhipok (à¸§à¸±à¸à¸à¸¥à¹à¸²à¸¢à¸§à¸±à¸à¸ªà¸§à¸£à¸£à¸à¸ à¸£. 7), the last absolute monarch of Thailand, or Siam, as it was known back then.\n\nKing Prajadhipok (Rama VII) was born on November 8, 1893, becoming the youngest child born to King Chulalongkorn and Queen Saovabha Phongsri.\n\nSomdet Chaofa Prajadhipok Sakdidej (à¸ªà¸¡à¹à¸à¹à¸à¹à¸à¹à¸²à¸à¹à¸²à¸à¸£à¸°à¸à¸²à¸à¸´à¸à¸à¸¨à¸±à¸à¸à¸´à¹à¸à¸à¸à¹) ascended the Thai throne on November 26, 1925, following the death of his brother, King Vajiravudh (Rama VI).\n\nEducated in England at Eton and the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, King Prajadhipok brought a unique perspective to his reign, combining Western education with deep respect for Thai culture and traditions.\n\nHowever, his 9 year reign as Siam’s last absolute monarch was fraught with challenges from the outset. Siam was undergoing significant social, economic, and political changes. The impact of the Great Depression, coupled with internal political strife and increasing demands for modernization and democratic reforms, placed immense pressure on the Thai monarchy.\n\nKing Prajadhipok: The Virtuous Thai King\n\nDespite these challenges, King Prajadhipok strove to embody the 10 Virtues of a Righteous Thai Ruler (à¸à¸¨à¸à¸´à¸à¸£à¸²à¸à¸à¸£à¸£à¸¡), a set of Buddhist principles that guided his actions and decisions as a monarch.\n\nThese virtues include generosity, morality, self-sacrifice, honesty, gentleness, self-control, non-anger, non-violence, patience, and uprightness â principles which later were embraced with great devotion by like King Bhumibol Adulyadej the Great, who assumed the throne in 1949.\n\nKing Prajadhipok was committed to modernization and reform. He recognized the need for a constitutional monarchy and worked towards drafting a constitution that would limit the powers of the monarchy and increase the role of the people in governance.\n\nThis move was a reflection of his moral and ethical commitment to justice and fairness, as well as his sincere belief that Thai citizens needed a greater voice in the governing of the Kingdom’s affairs.\n\nHis reign saw the establishment of the first constitution of Thailand in 1932, following a coup attempt led by the Khana Ratsadon (à¸à¸à¸°à¸£à¸²à¸©à¸à¸£) or People’s Party, a group of military and civilian leaders advocating for democratic reforms.\n\nThe transition from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy was a profound change for Siam/Thailand, one that King Prajadhipok navigated with a deep sense of responsibility and adherence to the virtues of patience, uprightness, and non-violence, ensuring the transition was conducted without any loss of “flesh and blood”.\n\nKing Prajadhipok’s personal life also mirrored these virtues. He was known for his simplicity and modesty, often engaging directly with his subjects and showing a genuine concern for their welfare. His charitable activities and efforts, particularly in education and healthcare, were driven by the virtue of generosity.\n\nHe became the first Thai King to personally award degrees to graduating university students, handing out degree cards to new graduates of Chulalongkorn University in 1930.\n\nThis tradition was maintained by King Bhumibol Adulyadej during much of his reign, until graduating classes became too large and additional Royal family members needed to assist in the ceremonies.\n\nKing Prajadhipok’s Abdication of the Thai Throne\n\nKing Prajadhipok’s avoidance of violence, preferring peaceful solutions over military interventions, was viewed as weakness by powerful players in Thailand’s military factions. This led to an inability to exert influence over the new “democratic” regime (which he had deep concerns about) and eventually his abdication from the Thai throne in 1935.\n\nIn his letter of abdication, written from self-imposed exile in England, King Prajadhipok wrote:\n\nââ¦I am willing to relinquish the power that previously belonged to me to the people in general. But I refuse to cede all my powers to anyone or any group, especially to use those powers without absolute authority and without listening to the true voice of the people.\n\n(à¸à¹à¸²à¸à¹à¸à¹à¸²à¹à¸à¹à¸¡à¹à¸à¸à¸µà¹à¸à¸°à¸ªà¸¥à¸°à¸­à¸³à¸à¸²à¸à¸­à¸±à¸à¹à¸à¹à¸à¸à¸­à¸à¸à¹à¸²à¸à¹à¸à¹à¸²à¸­à¸¢à¸¹à¹à¹à¸à¸´à¸¡à¹à¸«à¹à¹à¸à¹à¸£à¸²à¸©à¸à¸£à¹à¸à¸¢à¸à¸±à¹à¸§à¹à¸ à¹à¸à¹à¸à¹à¸²à¸à¹à¸à¹à¸²à¹à¸¡à¹à¸¢à¸´à¸à¸¢à¸­à¸¡à¸¢à¸à¸­à¸³à¸à¸²à¸à¸à¸±à¹à¸à¸«à¸¥à¸²à¸¢à¸à¸­à¸à¸à¹à¸²à¸à¹à¸à¹à¸²à¹à¸«à¹à¹à¸à¹à¸à¸¹à¹à¹à¸ à¸à¸à¸°à¹à¸ à¹à¸à¸¢à¹à¸à¸à¸²à¸°à¹à¸à¸·à¹à¸­à¹à¸à¹à¸­à¸³à¸à¸²à¸à¸à¸±à¹à¸à¹à¸à¸¢à¸ªà¸´à¸à¸à¸´à¸à¸²à¸à¹à¸¥à¸°à¹à¸à¸¢à¹à¸¡à¹à¸à¸±à¸à¹à¸ªà¸µà¸¢à¸à¸­à¸±à¸à¹à¸à¹à¸à¸£à¸´à¸à¸à¸­à¸à¸à¸£à¸°à¸à¸²à¸£à¸²à¸©à¸à¸£)\n\nNow, I see that my wish to give the people a true voice in the country’s decision-making has not been achieved.

His reign, though marked by challenges and eventual abdication, is remembered for his dedication to the principles of righteousness and virtue, guiding Thailand through one of its most transformative periods.\n\nHis efforts laid the groundwork for modern Thai democracy under a Constitutional Monarchy and served as a powerful example of virtuous leadership that King Bhumibol the Great would later embody to even a greater degree during his long 70 year reign.\n\nDid King Bhumibol ever meet King Prajadhipok?\n\nIt is an intriguing question as to whether King Prajadhipok ever met with King Bhumibol Adulyadej during the 1930s, while the then “Prince Bhumibol” was studying as a child in Switzerland, considering the close proximity to England. However, there is no documented evidence that such a meeting occurred.\n\nThere is one connection between the two Kings that many people are not aware of. King Bhumibol was bestowed with the name “Bhumibol” (à¸ à¸¹à¸¡à¸´à¸à¸¥) by King Prajadhipok on the occasion of his birth in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1927.\n\nIt seems divinely clairvoyant that King Prajadhipok chose to bestow the baby prince with the name “Bhumibol” (à¸ à¸¹à¸¡à¸´à¸à¸¥), considering the great unlikelihood the child would ever assume the thrown of Thailand.\n\nThe name “Bhumibol” is derived from Sanskrit and can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. à¸ à¸¹à¸¡à¸´ (Bhumi): meaning “land” or “earth.”\n\n2. à¸à¸¥ (Bol): meaning “strength” or “power.”\n\nTherefore, the name à¸ à¸¹à¸¡à¸´à¸à¸¥ (Bhumibol) translates to “Strength of the Land” or “Power of the Land.” This name turned out to match perfectly with King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s destiny â as he was known for his dedication to the development and welfare of Thailand, often symbolizing the strength and unity of the nation."
