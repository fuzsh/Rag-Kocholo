        "text": "George Bush and Meditation: Wat Sanghathan – Nonthaburi\n\nIf you’re looking for a quiet sanctuary this coming Visaka Bucha Day, Wat Sanghathan is the perfect place to escape the clamour of Bangkok’s busy temples and relax in peaceful surroundings. Located just outside of Bangkok, on the west bank of the Chao Phraya River, this temple is just off the tourist radar and often gets overlooked by the majority of visitors. The best way to get there is to take the express boat to Nonthaburi pier and cross the river with the ferry then take a taxi or get in one of the red pick-up trucks. The temple is located off Rattanathibet Road down mangrove-lined roads and has 50 acres of secluded landscape gardens.\n\nGeorge W. Bush in a Buddhist Temple\n\nThe temple features numerous wood sculptures, the most exquisite of which is the wood temple near the floating meditation area. This marvellous temple is entirely made up of wood which has been beautifully carved to show characters from Thai mythology and folklore. Inside the wood temple there are numerous wood columns that have been carved to represent different countries and religions from around the world. The column that represents England, for example, has London buses carved on it and the Houses of Parliament. The United States of America shows a Native American Indian profile and, two airplanes flying into the Twin Towers. The column for Iraq has a carving of George W. Bush with a finger pointing in the air and next to him stands a soldier holding an automatic weapon. There are columns showing about 18 countries and religions such as Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Jainism. There is no column depicting Thailand but other Southeast Asian countries such as Cambodia and Myanmar can be found. The wood temple is definitely worth a visit and is a great place to relax.\n\nFlora and Fauna\n\nWat Sanghathan blends seamlessly into its natural surroundings, with small ponds and trees to create shade from the hot sun. Birds and animals abound and you will see turtles and frogs in the ponds as well as numerous small lizards in the trees. A few dogs will be lazing around in the sun, which is pretty typical for Thailand (the dog that always lies on the threshold to 7-Eleven, for example). There are plenty of places to sit down and take in the ambiance of the temple grounds.\n\nUposatha Hall\n\nRising out of the tree canopy is the octagonal glass Uposatha Hall which houses the Luang Por Tho Buddha image. All around the hall are images painted onto the glass walls depicting the Buddha and his disciples. You will see a few people meditating in here and many people walk around the outer perimeter of the temple in a ritual known as wien tien.\n\nMeditation centre\n\nThe temple is most popular as a meditation centre and visitors are allowed to stay at the centre for 7 days. If you want to stay for longer, you have to request permission from Ajarn Sanong Katapunyo. The temple is friendly to foreigners and some of the monks can speak English. People who wish to stay there have to show there passport and provide two passport-sized photographs. You will also be required to agree to the eight precepts:\n\n– Refrain from killing any living creature.\n\n– Refrain from taking anything which does not belong to you.\n\n– Refrain from any sexual activity.\n\n– Refrain from telling lies or speaking impolitely.\n\n– Refrain from drinking intoxicating liquors and taking drugs.\n\n– Refrain from eating after 12 o’clock mid-day.\n\n– Refrain from dancing, singing, listening to music, wearing jewellery, perfumes and cosmetics.\n\n– Refrain from lying on a high and luxurious bed.\n\nIf you do wish to stay at the temple, be aware that mobile phones and smoking are not permitted and there is a daily schedule that must be followed:\n\n– 04.00 a.m. Morning chanting until 04.30 – followed by sitting meditation.\n\n– 06.00 a.m. Warm drinks.\n\n– 07.30 a.m. Walking meditation.\n\n– 09.00 a.m. Food from the Buffet.\n\n– 12.30 p.m. Chanting and Meditation until 13.30 p.m.\n\n– 15.30 p.m. Communal cleaning.\n\n– 16.30 p.m. Walking meditation.\n\n– 17.30 p.m. Drinks and rest period.\n\n– 19.00 p.m. Evening chanting.\n\n– 20.00 p.m. Sitting meditation at the Dhamma Hall.\n\nStaying at the temple is a great way to immerse yourself in a different side of Thai culture and escape the hectic pace of modern life. The temple has modern amenities such as payphones and an ATM and there are a few toilets located around the vicinity.\n\nFor more information about retreats at Wat Sanghathan, contact:\n\nWat Sanghathan Meditation Center\n\nBangphai, Muang, Nonthaburi 11000, Thailand\n\nTel: +66 (0)89 0500052, +66 (0)84 0066080\n\nE-mail: vimokkha@hotmail.com\n\nThe Nine Kings of the Chakri Dynasty: Rama II – The Poet King\n\nThe second king of the Chakri dynasty was born in 1767, the same year that Ayutthaya fell to the Burmese. His father was Thong Duang, the man who would later become Rama I. At that time, Thong Duang had been appointed Luang Yokrabat[1] in the provincial town of Ratchaburi, where he met and married Nak (later Queen Amarinda). She gave birth to Chim on February 24, 1767, in Amphawa, Samut Songkhram. Chim was just 16 years old when his father became king and was raised to the title of Prince Itsarasunthon. In 1807 he was appointed uparat (deputy-king) and served as such until his father’s death in 1809, when senior court officials chose him as successor to the throne. However, Prince Thammathibet – the son of Taksin and Rama I’s daughter – plotted to take power for himself with the help of numerous supporters. His plot was discovered before it was implemented and all conspirators were executed, including the prince’s male offspring. After his execution, Prince Thammathibet’s wealth, palace, servants and rice were passed on to the son of the new king-elect. The day after the executions, the anointing ceremony took place and Prince Itsarasunthon officially became king. No royal naming system was established at the time of his accession to the throne. He was later named Buddha Loetla Nabhalai and is commonly called Rama II.\n\nReformation\n\nDuring his reign, Rama II introduced numerous reforms. One of the first things he did was to order a complete census of manpower. At the time, Thai society was broken up into four main classes: chao (royalty), khunnang (nobility), phrai (commoners) and that (slaves). Ordinary phrai were expected to perform four months corvée[2], but many of them were able to avoid their duty by circumventing the registration process. In an attempt to remedy this, Rama II issued a decree that aimed to settle all disputes regarding registered status. Runaway phrai were given the opportunity to return to their patrons and were promised that they would not be punished if they did so of their own free will. If they chose to remain in hiding, they would be forcefully arrested and imprisoned. Furthermore, tattooing the wrists of phrai who had not yet been tattooed or had changed status was to be carried out to clearly show who their master (nai) was. The practice of tattooing the wrists of commoners was introduced by King Taksin.\n\nIn 1811, Rama II appointed eight committees to the task of surveying all arable land in the central plains area. He ordered that all land must be cultivated and anyone found to own large stretches of uncultivated land would be required to hand it over to the state. All landowners were obliged to pay a land tax, which was usually paid in rice – a tax known as khawka. As well as practical reforms, the king ordered that customary ceremonies were to be carried out before measuring land, such as making offerings to the spirits of the field. People were prohibited from working upon the fields on ceremonial days and anyone caught doing so would have his land confiscated and given to others.\n\nRama II was a devout Buddhist and he did much to educate the Siamese people on the teachings of the Buddha. He translated the Buddhist texts from Pāli into Thai so that people would understand the prayers and in 1817 he revived the Visakabucha festival, which commemorates the day that the Buddha attained enlightenment and passed into nirvana. When a virulent strain of cholera broke out in 1820, the king relieved all people of their duties so that they could take part in chanting sacred mantras and making merit. All animals were released and allowed to roam freely while prisoners were freed. No living being was to be killed during the ceremony. Not long after, the epidemic abated. The king’s course of action shows his strong belief in the Buddhist concept of karma and it seems he attempted to fight the disease through merit making.\n\nGolden Age of Rattanakosin Literature\n\nIt was well known that Rama II was a lover of the arts and in particular the literary arts. He was an accomplished poet and anyone with the ability to write a refined piece of poetry would gain the favour of the king; this led to him being dubbed the “poet king”. It was because of this special circumstance that the poet Sunthon Phu was able to elevate himself from phrai status to khun and later phra[3]. Sunthon – also known as the drunken writer – authored numerous works, many of which are still read and studied today. Rama II rewrote much of the great literature from the reign of Rama I in a modern style. He is attributed with writing a popular version of the Thai folk tale Ramakien and wrote a number of other dance dramas such as Sang Thong. The king was a musician of renown, playing and composing for the fiddle and introducing new techniques for playing certain instruments. He was also a sculptor and is accredited with sculpting the face of the Niramitr Buddha in Wat Arun. Because of his remarkable artistic achievements, Rama II’s birthday is now officially celebrated as National Artists’ Day (Wan Sinlapin Haeng Chat) and is held in honour of those artists who have contributed to the artistic and cultural heritage of the kingdom.\n\nThe White Elephant King\n\nThe discovery of white elephants in Thailand has always been taken as an auspicious omen and they hold a revered place in Thai society due to their symbolic relationship to monarchy, religion and national identity. Rama II had several white elephants and because of this he was nicknamed “The White Elephant King”. Towards the end of his reign, the death of two white elephants was a cause for great concern and was seen as a sign of impending misfortune. Not long after, on July 21, 1824, Buddha Loetla Nabhalai became ill and died. His reign lasted almost 15 years.\n\nDuring Rama II’s reign, Siam was mostly a peaceful country and much of his time was dedicated to promoting the arts and religion. He took a somewhat backseat role in the ruling of Siam and preferred to withdraw from administrative duties, leaving much of the work to the nobles. He was the father of 73 children to 40 mothers, outdoing his father in number of offspring but falling short in number of years; he was 16 years younger that Rama I when he died.\n\n[1] “Luang Yokrabat” is a title given to nobility that serve as legal officers, appointed by the king and attached to a provincial centre.\n\n[2] Unpaid labour required of people of low social class.\n\n[3] Khun and Phra are both forms of conferred nobility, with Phra being higher than Khun.\n\nThe Nine Kings of the Chakri Dynasty: Rama I – The Founding Father\n\nTEFL Teaching in Thailand: Pros and Cons\n\nTaking the Leap\n\nSo you’ve made up your mind to escape from the rat race and travel to Thailand to teach English. Friends have told you how easy it is to find work there and you don’t want to miss out on the action any longer. You’ve probably spent months thinking about and organizing it, doing online TEFL courses, having a criminal record check, getting the right visa and eagerly reading “The Rough Guide to Thailand.” But, as the old adage says: “the proof of the pudding is in the eating,” and a travel guide is no better than a recipe book – it shows you how to make cake, but you can’t eat the book. Your real adventure begins the minute you set foot on Thai soil.\n\nThis guide aims to outline some of the pros and cons of being a TEFL teacher in Southeast Asia’s most popular destination and give you a few pointers on what to expect. If you’re planning to teach in Thailand for the first time or have already been here for a while, this is the perfect starting point. Most of the information does not apply to long-term teachers and residents.\n\n“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.” — Mark Twain\n\nPros\n\nYou’ve Got a Friend\n\nTeaching in Thailand is a rollercoaster ride of learning curves with a healthy balance of highs and lows and the people you meet will make you laugh, inspire you and force you to re-evaluate long-held beliefs. Thailand’s TEFLers are a mixed bunch of characters who have chosen to abandon their home country for reasons innumerable. The personalities will range from escapist to exhibitionist and you will meet plenty of “big” characters. TEFL teachers usually hail from all the English speaking nations and some European countries. Whatever you think of your colleagues, be prepared to pal-around with other teachers as you become aloof to tourists yet don’t quite feel affiliated with the lifers. One thing is for sure, you’ll never get bored of working alongside a group of people who are courageous and crazy enough to jump head first into Thailand’s TEFL scene.\n\nThe Best Things in Life are Cheap\n\nNewcomers to Thailand are always impressed by the low cost of living. You will live relatively cheaply and most people pay in the region of 5,000 to 6,000 baht per month (£120/$200) for their accommodation. Pricier properties go up in luxury but the typical teacher’s apartment will have one room, a shower, balcony, air-con and furniture. As with most things in Thailand, though, nothing is set in stone and apartments will vary greatly. Many of the schools will help you with accommodation and recommend apartment blocks that have other teachers living in them.\n\nEating out is cheap and coming all the way to Thailand to eat alone in your room is fine, but you could have done that at home. The real benefit from your time abroad will come from immersing yourself in the culture. Food on the soi (street) is cheap and you will pay the equivalent of £0.60/$1 for a meal. Despite being a Buddhist country, Thailand does not cater well to vegetarians and you may want to consider giving up your vegetarianism while you stay. Some foreign teachers avoid eating food from the street vendors at first, partly because they don’t know how or what to ask for and partly because the hygiene standards seem low compared to what we’re used to in the west. In truth, food on the soi is what good food should be: natural, healthy, cheap, free from big corporations. When you buy food on the soi, you know the money is going into the pockets of Thai people. Eat at McDonalds and the profits are going to some fat cat businessman – eat it at your own peril.\n\nPublic transport is dirt cheap in Thailand and central Bangkok has a BTS (Skytrain) and MRT (underground). The BTS costs between 15 and 40 baht and is a fast and convenient way to get around. Buses are cheaper and you will pay 20 baht at the most. Some buses are free, though these are old rickety buses that still have hydraulic powered doors and no air-con; worth a ride for the novelty. Taxis are relatively cheap but always ask the driver to use the meter, some drivers will ask for a fixed fare upfront. The benefit of taxis is they’re always cool inside and offer a welcome respite from the humid Bangkok climate.\n\nEasy as ABC\n\nBecoming a teacher in Thailand is easy and many people arrive with no prior experience. Because of the high demand for English teachers, you will quickly get hired on the strength of being a native speaker. Be prepared to be thrown in at the deep end but expect the nerves to melt away and be replaced by satisfaction in seeing the smiling faces of the kids you teach. Most of the schools that hire TEFL teachers have light schedules and you will have some free time through the day. While some schools let you go home in your free time, others insist you stay on the school premises.\n\nResources are provided and there will usually be a legacy left behind from previous teachers such as flash cards, games, toys etc. It helps to brush up on your knowledge of classroom games before you arrive, though you will pick ideas up from other teachers. Some schools will provide a Thai teaching partner who will help to translate things into Thai and keep discipline in the classroom.\n\nLearning the Lingo\n\nThey say that learning a new language improves intelligence and expands our perception of the world around us. Many teachers learn to speak Thai and tackle it with enthusiasm; others are none the wiser after one year. The basics are easy to learn and in a short time you will be able to order food, give directions to the taxi driver and have basic conversations. Fluency really depends on how much you motivate yourself and many people take courses to move beyond the basics. Thai is a tonal language and has five tones much like Chinese does. The tones aren’t quite as mysterious and perplexing as they seem once you get used to hearing them. There are numerous books and websites to help you learn to read, speak, and write Thai, but there is no better way to learn it than to spend time around the locals and make an effort to have a conversation. While books are good, they lack the subtle inflections, variations and colloquialisms. Many people learn Thai better if they have a Thai girlfriend/boyfriend and this is by the far the most natural way to learn. Learning Thai can be fun and challenging and if you put in the effort, you will surprise yourself when you suddenly realize you understand a conversation in Thai. Your experience of Thailand will be markedly improved by learning to speak the language.\n\n“A different language is a different vision of life”. — Federico Fellini\n\nLa Dolce Vita\n\nThe question most people have before they come to teach English in Thailand is: how much will I get paid and will it be enough to live on? The truth is, it varies from school to school, person to person, and you don’t need me to tell you that it’s often down to the efforts of the individual. However, I will list here the average wages and common ways to boost your income.\n\nThe average starting wage for an inexperienced teacher will be in the region of 30,000 baht; sounds a fortune, doesn’t it. However, that translates into roughly £600/$1,000 per month, though most TEFL teachers can live comfortably on that. You can supplement your wages by doing overtime and many teachers build up a number of private students. Depending on the students, you will be able to charge around 500 baht per hour for private tuition. With a little extra effort, you could bump up that 30,000 per month to 40 or 50, depending on how hard you want to work. Most TEFL teachers come alone and don’t have any dependents so for the average teacher, 30-35,000 is more than enough to live the good life for a year or two.\n\nThere are, of course, other ways to earn extra money. Many travelers look for ways to make money on the internet and there are numerous writing jobs available if you look around (I personally make an average of 9,000 baht per month from writing). Some teachers end up blogging about living in Thailand, which can lead to writing for newspapers, magazines and websites. Some become highly sought after for their in-depth knowledge of the country and a few go on to write books. Indeed, there is a whole genre of fiction and travel literature written by foreigners living in Thailand.\n\nSo, even though starting wages are low in comparison to the wages of those who have been teaching longer and have the proper qualifications (some teachers earn up to 100,000 baht per month), you can live comfortably and do all the sightseeing and traveling you want to on the wages you’re paid.\n\nCons\n\nThe cons are hard to weigh up, simply because there isn’t much to complain about. However, it would be naïve to insinuate that everything is hunky-dory for TEFL teachers, and there are one or two things that can be a nuisance, or in some cases a nightmare. The aim of this section is not to put you off, but to let you know what to expect.\n\nFarang!\n\nLet’s get one thing straight: if you have round eyes and a big nose and live in Thailand, you will never be accepted as one of their own. You are, quite simply, a “farang.” Thai people don’t mistake Chinese people for Japanese, or Cambodians for Malaysians. However, all “big noses” seemingly come from the same place: Farangdom. Doesn’t matter if you’re German, British, American, Australian, Swedish, French; you’re a farang, that’s all they know. You have to get used to being stared at and you will start to understand what it’s like to be a celebrity; it goes to your head, believe me. Ignore the stares and whispering and take it with a pinch of salt.\n\nThe origins of the word farang are unclear but it is generally believed that the word originated with the Indo-Persian word farangi, meaning foreigner. By the way, “farang” is also the Thai word for guava.\n\n90 Day Report\n\nOnce you have a work permit and visa, you will have to report to immigration every 90 days to show your face and let them know that you’re still providing a useful service to the country and not just bumming around. It’s easy to forget to go and a few teachers occasionally do. In the event that you forget, you will have to pay a fine of 2,000 baht. Luckily, there’s a 14-day window, so you can report seven days before or seven days after. It takes two hours max to do your 90 day report and if the immigration office is nearby, you can often fit it in during a free period. Don’t go between the hours of 12 p.m. and 1 p.m. or you’ll find the immigration officer eating lunch.\n\nHomeward Bound\n\nFor many who visit the Land of Smiles, the hardest thing is leaving it all behind and once you’ve fallen in love with Bangkok’s urban jungle, Chiang Mai’s mountains or the southern islands, you may not want to go home. Going back to your home country can be a major come-down after a year or two of living a stress-free life in a warm, tropical climate. Many choose not to return, or if they do, they do it to get a proper teaching qualification so they can come straight back and get a higher paid job. Teaching in Thailand will not be something that you forget easily, and whether your experience is a dream come true or a living hell, you won’t be left indifferent.\n\nRay Malcolm is the author of “Bangkok in the 1930s” a travel guide with a historical twist, available for $1.99 on Rama, an iPhone app found on iTunes: http://bit.ly/iTunesRama or through the developer’s website at http://www.crimsonbamboo.com."
