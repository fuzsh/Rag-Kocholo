Today, we will discuss how the Buddhist belief in “karma” is also woven into the […]\n\nHow Men Vs. Women Speak Thai\n\nI was recently watching Khru Bo’s YouTube Channel “IWantToLearnThai” â a channel I highly recommend for intermediate Thai language students who want to practice their listening skills. Khru Bo does an excellent job with her choice of subject matter, her pacing and repetition, and her overall presentation. However, when watching her videos I was reminded […]\n\nThe Hidden Dharma of Thai Language & Culture\n\nThe deep connection between the Buddhist culture of Thailand and the Thai language is illustrated best by the usage of “tham” (à¸à¸£à¸£à¸¡), meaning dharma.

The kings of the Ayutthaya and Rattanakosin periods had many wives, classified in different categories, the highest level being that of “Pharaya Luang” (à¸ à¸£à¸£à¸¢à¸²à¸«à¸¥à¸§à¸) or “Royal Wife”.

With the Thai New Year’s festival of Songkran upon us, I thought it a good time to discuss the word for fun in Thai, which is saÌnoÌok (à¸ªà¸à¸¸à¸). Like the […]\n\nHeet Sip Song: Isaan Thailand Merit Making Traditions\n\nHeet Sip Song (à¸®à¸µà¸à¸ªà¸´à¸à¸ªà¸­à¸) are monthly merit-making events in the Isaan region of Northeast Thailand.

Sip Song meanwhile means “twelve,” referring to each of the monthly merit making events throughout the year. […]\n\nPhu Phan Museum Rotunda Mural – Sakon Nakhon Art\n\nPreviously, we’ve talked about bas-relief Thai artwork, how it’s made, and classic examples of it at the Ajarn Fun Acharo Museum at Wat Pa Udom Somphon.

This underground resistance group worked against the Japanese occupation of Thailand, which began in 1941 after the Thai government under Field Marshal Plaeck Phibunsongkhram (à¹à¸à¸¥à¸ à¸à¸´à¸à¸¹à¸¥à¸ªà¸à¸à¸£à¸²à¸¡) was coerced into an alliance with Japan.

Historically, Kings around […]\n\nThe Thai Word for Love: Its Cultural Meaning in Thailand\n\nI’ve written before how the Thai language shapes Thai culture and the personality of the Thai people. For example, how the brevity of the language encourages concrete thought versus abstraction. Today, I’m going to talk about how the sound of a single word informs Thai culture. That word is “love”. Or as it’s said in […]\n\nThe Isaan Monks of Thailand’s Forest Tradition\n\nSakon Nakhon is considered by many to be the spiritual mecca of Northeast Thailand (Isaan).

In the Thai language, the Buddhist Era is referred to as “PuttaSakarat” (à¸à¸¸à¸à¸à¸¨à¸±à¸à¸£à¸²à¸). It gets abbreviated to the initials “à¸à¸¨” when written beside dates, as frequently is seen in […]\n\nKhanom Dok Bua: Cheap Thai Pancake Dessert\n\nKhanom Dok Bua (à¸à¸à¸¡à¸à¸­à¸à¸à¸±à¸§) is a sweet Thai pancake found occasionally at outdoor markets in Thailand.

The polite particle khraÌp (for a man) or khaÌ (for a woman) will of course also be tacked onto the end of the phrase, so it becomes “saÌ-waÌt-dee khrap/kha”. In Thailand guidebooks […]\n\nSecret Thai Hangover Cure & The Hang Energy Drink\n\nYears ago in Thailand there was a popular hangover drink called Hang that was made by the famous Thai energy drink maker Osotspa, creators of the Kingdom’s top-selling energy drink, M-150.

Artwork on the street is referred to as “Soi Sin” or “Sin Nai Soi” in the Thai language.
