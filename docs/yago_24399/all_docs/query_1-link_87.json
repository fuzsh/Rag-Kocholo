In this case, the king's full costume that involves the full regalia also includes a belt. This belt probably belonged to HM Queen Sri Bajarindra, but I haven't yet found a photograph of the queen wearing it. HM Queen Sirikit has worn it on several occasion, though not of late.\n\n​\n\nAttachments\n\nemb01.jpg\n\nemb02.jpg\n\nemb03.jpg\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nK\n\nkokeno\n\nCommoner\n\nJoined\n\nJun 24, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n44\n\nCity\n\nBANGKOK\n\nCountry\n\nThailand\n\nOther Royal Jewel\n\nThe Chakri Belt.\n\n​\n\nAttachments\n\ncb01.jpg\n\ncb02.jpg\n\ncb03.jpg\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nK\n\nkokeno\n\nCommoner\n\nJoined\n\nJun 24, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n44\n\nCity\n\nBANGKOK\n\nCountry\n\nThailand\n\nOther Royal Jewel\n\nThe Thai-style Tiara\n\n​\n\nTiaras were common in Europe but were only introduced to Siamese Royals during King Rama V's reign, probably after his travels in Europe. Though King Rama V's queens and consorts were in pocessions of some beautiful tiaras, they were only worn as necklaces. The photographs of tiaras being worn by Thai Royal ladies were of the Princess Sri Rattanakosin, King Rama V's daughter, and the Princess Consort Indrasakdi Sachi, Rama VI's consort.\n\n​\n\nAttachments\n\nd02.jpg\n\ntt02.jpg\n\ntt03.jpg\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nK\n\nkokeno\n\nCommoner\n\nJoined\n\nJun 24, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n44\n\nCity\n\nBANGKOK\n\nCountry\n\nThailand\n\nOther Royal Jewel\n\nNine Gems Belt\n\n1.

Queen Sirikit was a most elegant and beautiful woman. She won the hearts of those who saw her. She measured right up there with Jackie Kennedy and QEII and Grace Kelly.\n\nI have a short story that was published , about a beauty competition of the day, with 6 beautiful women, the 3 , I have mentioned plus Fabiola of Belgium, and I cannot think of the 6th.
