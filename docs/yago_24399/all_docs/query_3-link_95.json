However, there hasn’t been much […]\n\nPhra Pidta Amulets & Coins in Thailand\n\nPhra Pidta amulets are one of Thailand’s most coveted.

The readers of DestinAsia recently ranked Bangkok the best city to visit in […]\n\nKon Mee Sanay: Charming & Enchanting Thai Women\n\nIn Thailand the two most common words used to describe an attractive woman are suÌay (à¸ªà¸§à¸¢) and naÌraÌk (à¸à¹à¸²à¸£à¸±à¸), which translate to “beautiful” and “cute,” respectively. But sometimes you may feel that neither of these words are the right one to describe a truly captivating Thai woman. In the Thai language, the compound word “mee […]\n\nDai Yin: The Art of Hearing & Speaking in Thailand\n\nWhen discussing how the Thai language impacts Thai culture, people often talk about the multiple meanings of the Thai word “jai” (heart, mind, and spirit), and the hundreds of other words with “jai” as a prefix or suffix â which are popularly categorized as “Thai Heart Talk“. However, there’s another word that’s important to understanding […]\n\nKing Prajadhipok: The Last Absolute Monarch of Thailand\n\nSeen Above: King Prajadhipok of Siam with his wife Queen Rambhai Barni in England. On May 30th (2024), the Thai people honor the 83rd anniversary of the death of King Prajadhipok (à¸§à¸±à¸à¸à¸¥à¹à¸²à¸¢à¸§à¸±à¸à¸ªà¸§à¸£à¸£à¸à¸ à¸£. 7), the last absolute monarch of Thailand, or Siam, as it was known back then.

The term “Atthamiâ means “eighth day of the lunar monthâ and “Bucha” means “to honor or pay homage.” The day falls on the eighth day of the waning […]\n\nProstration in Thailand: A Buddhist History & Tradition\n\nEvery few years in Thailand, the subject of prostration comes up. Sometimes it’s brought up by Thai university students at a major Bangkok university like Chulalongkorn. Other times its criticisms made by foreign journalists or academics who, despite having lived in Thailand, have a poor understanding of the Thai language and Thai Buddhism â both […]\n\nPhra Khun Paen: Thai Love Spells & Amulets\n\nSacred amulets that provide good fortune in various ways (including love) are very popular in Thailand.

It commemorates three significant events in the life of Siddhartha Gautama, the historical Buddha: his birth, his enlightenment, and his passing away, which are said to have all occurred on the same day: the full […]\n\nKarma in Thai Language & Culture\n\nPreviously, I talked about how Thai language and culture is intertwined with the “dharma” or teachings of Buddhism â the word “tham” (à¸à¸£à¸£à¸¡) being the Thai word for “dharma,” as well as a root word for many other Thai words. Today, we will discuss how the Buddhist belief in “karma” is also woven into the […]\n\nThe Hidden Dharma of Thai Language & Culture\n\nThe deep connection between the Buddhist culture of Thailand and the Thai language is illustrated best by the usage of “tham” (à¸à¸£à¸£à¸¡), meaning dharma. While the word “tham” has additional meanings, such as justice, righteousness, normality, and lawfulness, these meanings always are intertwined with dharma â which refers to the teachings of the Buddha and […]\n\nThe Royal Ploughing Ceremony in Thailand – A History\n\nThe Royal Ploughing Ceremony, known in Thai as “Raek Na Khwan,” is an ancient rite observed in Thailand that marks the traditional beginning of the rice-growing season and accompanying rains. The phrase “Raek Na Khwan” (à¹à¸£à¸à¸à¸²à¸à¸§à¸±à¸) translates to “The First Field of Khwan” â Khwan being a life sustaining spirit that is said to exist […]\n\nDying Well the Buddhist Way in Thailand\n\nBuddhist monks in Thailand often teach that death is the most important test we take in life. Other tests can be taken over and over again, always with an opportunity for improvement. But we have only one chance at the test called death. And it’s a test we may be forced to take unexpectedly at […]\n\nThe Ten Virtues of a Righteous King of Thailand\n\nSeen Above: King Bhumibol Adulyadej the Great, along with the current King of Thailand, HM Maha Vajiralongkorn (in uniform), in Sakon Nakhon Province As we approach Coronation Day in Thailand, now is a good time to reflect on the “Tenfold Virtues of the Ruler,” otherwise known as the Dasavidha-Rajadhamma. These principles are a Buddhist Dharma […]\n\nCoronation Day – Thailand Public Holiday (2024)\n\nSeen Above: His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn of Thailand at his Coronation Ceremony Coronation Day is a national public holiday in Thailand, which in the Thai language is called “Wan Chat-Mongkol” (à¸§à¸±à¸à¸à¸±à¸à¸£à¸¡à¸à¸à¸¥).

The kings of the Ayutthaya and Rattanakosin periods had many wives, classified in different categories, the highest level being that of “Pharaya Luang” (à¸ à¸£à¸£à¸¢à¸²à¸«à¸¥à¸§à¸) or “Royal Wife”. […]\n\nHow to Greet a Monk in Thailand – Saying Hello\n\nOne of the most fascinating things you can do in Thailand is to visit temples off the beaten tourist track. If you take this path of the intrepid traveler, you’ll likely encounter Thai monks. It’s therefore important to know how to greet a Buddhist monk properly, so that they will feel at ease on seeing […]\n\nThe Thai Belief in Khwan: Spiritual Gift Giving in Thailand\n\nThose who have lived in Thailand likely know that the Thai word for gift is “khong-khwan” (à¸à¸­à¸à¸à¸§à¸±à¸). But have you ever wondered about the origin of this word? Students of the Thai language are familiar with the word “khong” (à¸à¸­à¸), which means “of” or “belonging to”. But what, or who, is “khwan” (à¸à¸§à¸±à¸)? The meaning […]\n\nNamo Tassa: Thai Chanting at Temples in Thailand\n\nIf you have visited a Thai temple during any kind of ceremony or merit making, you likely have heard monks leading the “Namo Tassa” chant, which is a fundamental recitation in Theravada Buddhism (the religion of Thailand) â and a chant which always precedes any other Thai chanting. The Namo Tassa comes from the Pali […]\n\nSanook Culture in Thailand & The Thai Word for Fun\n\nPreviously I talked about the Thai word for love, raÌk (à¸£à¸±à¸), and the feelings it evokes compared to the word for love in other languages. With the Thai New Year’s festival of Songkran upon us, I thought it a good time to discuss the word for fun in Thai, which is saÌnoÌok (à¸ªà¸à¸¸à¸). Like the […]\n\nHeet Sip Song: Isaan Thailand Merit Making Traditions\n\nHeet Sip Song (à¸®à¸µà¸à¸ªà¸´à¸à¸ªà¸­à¸) are monthly merit-making events in the Isaan region of Northeast Thailand. The word “heet” in Isaan means “a time-honored tradition” â being related to the Thai word “jareet” (à¸à¸²à¸£à¸µà¸), which has the same meaning. Sip Song meanwhile means “twelve,” referring to each of the monthly merit making events throughout the year. […]\n\nPhu Phan Museum Rotunda Mural – Sakon Nakhon Art\n\nPreviously, we’ve talked about bas-relief Thai artwork, how it’s made, and classic examples of it at the Ajarn Fun Acharo Museum at Wat Pa Udom Somphon. There is a lovely bas-relief tile mural at the Phu Phan Museum’s open air rotunda. However, the museum hasn’t taken the necessary steps to protect the tiles with proper […]\n\nSeri Thai in Northeast Thailand | Free Thai Movement WW II\n\nThe Seri Thai Movement, meaning “Free Thai Movement,” was a significant part of Thailand’s history during World War II. This underground resistance group worked against the Japanese occupation of Thailand, which began in 1941 after the Thai government under Field Marshal Plaeck Phibunsongkhram (à¹à¸à¸¥à¸ à¸à¸´à¸à¸¹à¸¥à¸ªà¸à¸à¸£à¸²à¸¡) was coerced into an alliance with Japan. Volunteers in Northeastern […]\n\nThe Thai King who Smiles and Never Rests\n\nDuring his 70 year reign, King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great of Thailand was popularly known as “the Father of all the Land” (à¸à¹à¸­à¸«à¸¥à¸§à¸à¸à¸§à¸à¹à¸à¹à¸à¸à¸´à¸). He wasn’t regarded as a stern parent, but a kind father who always had Thailand’s best interests at heart. This aspect of HM King Bhumibol doesn’t get discussed enough. Historically, Kings around […]\n\nThe Thai Word for Love: Its Cultural Meaning in Thailand\n\nI’ve written before how the Thai language shapes Thai culture and the personality of the Thai people. For example, how the brevity of the language encourages concrete thought versus abstraction. Today, I’m going to talk about how the sound of a single word informs Thai culture. That word is “love”. Or as it’s said in […]\n\nThai Kaloeng Tribe of the Mekong Basin & Phu Phan Mountains\n\nAbove Photo: Thai Kaloeng women from the early 1900s. Note that Siamese women commonly went topless (or semi-topless) until the mid 1800s, when the colonial powers started visiting. Then the practice began to fade, but continued in Northeast Thailand (Isaan) until the 1930s. The Thai Kaloeng (à¹à¸à¸à¸°à¹à¸¥à¸´à¸) â also spelled Tai Kaleung or Thai Kalerng […]\n\nThe Thai Yoi Tribe of Northeast Thailand\n\nSeen Above: Thai Yoi faculty members at Sakon Nakhon Rabjabhat University, dressed in traditional indigo-dyed attire. The Thai Yoi (à¹à¸à¹à¸¢à¹à¸¢) immigrated to Northeast Thailand from the region around the Hom Thao Huse River (à¹à¸¡à¹à¸à¹à¹à¸²à¸®à¹à¸­à¸¡à¸à¹à¸²à¸§à¸®à¸¹à¹à¸) in the Khammouane Province of central Laos. First arriving in Sakon Nakhon during the 1800s, tribe members settled largely in Amphur […]\n\nThe Buddhist Era: How to Read Thai Dates\n\nThailand is the only country that uses the Buddhist Era calendar as its official date system, so it’s an important aspect of Thai life to understand. In the Thai language, the Buddhist Era is referred to as “PuttaSakarat” (à¸à¸¸à¸à¸à¸¨à¸±à¸à¸£à¸²à¸). It gets abbreviated to the initials “à¸à¸¨” when written beside dates, as frequently is seen in […]\n\nThailand’s Buddhist Vision of Hell in Literature & Temples\n\nDepictions of Hell at Thai temples will often feature sinners in a boiling cauldron of blood or water, as seen here at Wat Khao Tham Phra in Sakon Nakhon (Northeast Thailand). Terrifying representations of hell have been used by most societies to encourage good behavior and tamp down on evil. Thailand is no different in […]\n\nSufficiency Economy Rajabhat University Project for Thailand\n\nIn honor of King Bhumibol Adulyadej the Great, and to strengthen the legacy of his Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, we have developed a project proposal for Rajabhat Universities in Thailand. Rajabhat universities are publicly funded universities, similar to State Universities in the United States. In fact, like State Universities, Rajabhat Universities started out as “Teacher’s Colleges,” […]\n\nA Defense of Thailand’s Sufficiency Economy Philosophy\n\nKing Bhumibol the Great of Thailand had many accomplishments during his 70 year reign, but his greatest legacy might be his promotion of a Sufficiency Economy, which is a socio-economic philosophy that emphasizes moderation, self-sufficiency, and resilience to external shocks. His Majesty first introduced the concept of Sufficiency Economy in the late 1970s and early […]\n\nThe Architecture of Village Houses in Northeast Thailand\n\nIn the early 1960s, Pete Seeger made famous the Malvina Reynold’s song “Little Boxes,” which satirized the cookie-cutter existence of life in the suburbs of America, where people “all come out the same”. Today, the monotonous march of mechanized living stretches worldwide. Even in Thailand, there are neighborhoods filled with houses that all look alike, […]\n\nSecret Thai Hangover Cure & The Hang Energy Drink\n\nYears ago in Thailand there was a popular hangover drink called Hang that was made by the famous Thai energy drink maker Osotspa, creators of the Kingdom’s top-selling energy drink, M-150. Hang was made in 3 different formulas (Original, Foreplay, and Virgin), which included ingredients that improved liver function, settled stomachs, and boosted cognitive function. […]\n\nThai Journalist Day – Remembering Rong Wongsawan\n\nIn Thailand, “Journalist Day” (à¸§à¸±à¸à¸à¸±à¸à¸à¹à¸²à¸§) occurs every year on March 5th. Formally known as “National Mass Communication Day” (à¸§à¸±à¸à¸ªà¸·à¹à¸­à¸ªà¸²à¸£à¸¡à¸§à¸¥à¸à¸à¹à¸«à¹à¸à¸à¸²à¸à¸´), this day for honoring Thai journalists coincides with the establishment of the Journalists Association of Thailand on March 5th, 1955. Fifteen pioneering Thai journalists joined together to form the journalists association, including Choti Maneenoi (à¹à¸à¸à¸´ à¸¡à¸à¸µà¸à¹à¸­à¸¢) […]\n\nBuddhist Prayer Beads (Rosary) in Thailand\n\nIn Thailand, the use of “rosary” beads for prayer and meditation is common among Buddhist monks. However, their use in meditation among the Thai people occurs only among the most devoted of the Kingdom’s 67 million Buddhists. Thais frequently use prayer beads as a personal talisman (much like they use a sacred amulet). They will […]\n\nChao Pu Thala & The Phu Thai Tribe of Northeast Thailand\n\nThe Phu Thai (à¸à¸²à¸§à¸ à¸¹à¹à¸) are one of several tribal peoples who live in Northeast Thailand, including Sakon Nakhon and the neighboring province of Nakhon Phanom. It’s believed that the Phu Thai migrated from Laos into the Northeast (Isaan) from the 15th to the 18th centuries, with a spiritual belief system that combines Buddhism with animism […]\n\nChao Pu (Phaya) Yommarat – Phra Yom Mantra\n\nAt Wat Pra That Phon Thong there is a small pavilion with a statue of an unusual figure not ordinarily seen at a Thai temple. It is a statue of Chao Pu Yommarat (à¹à¸à¹à¸²à¸à¸¹à¹à¸¢à¸¡à¸£à¸²à¸). This is not actually a specific historical figure but refers to the distinguished 14 Thai men who were awarded the Royal […]\n\nLuang Pu Fan Acharo: Mystical Teachings & Mantra\n\nSeen above: Ajarn Fan Ajaro smoking a cigar to repel mosquitoes, as was a customary practice at the time.

Born in 1899, Ajarn Fan was a disciple of Ajarn Man Phuritatto, the co-founder of the Thai […]\n\nPreta: Hungry Ghost Spirits in Thailand\n\nThai culture is filled with supernatural spirits or ghosts, such as Nang Tani (the spirit who haunts wild banana trees) and the cannibalistic Phi Pop who will eat your internal organs with glee. These spirits are part of Thai folklore rather than Buddhist traditions, thus you’ll rarely, if ever, see one depicted inside a Thai […]\n\nBlind Thai Singers & Musicians: Who Are They?\n\nWhile efforts have been made to improve the lives of blind people in Thailand, many obstacles continue to exist for Thais who are visually-impaired. This is especially true in rural provinces like Sakon Nakhon where access to resources are difficult. It’s been estimated that only 10% of Thailand’s blind have the opportunity to receive rehabilitation, […]\n\nThailand: Misconceptions Vs. Reality\n\nRecently there was a photo making the rounds in Thailand of two tourists at Phuket Airport wearing Speedos and flip flops. This reminded me that there is a big difference between how many foreigners view Thailand versus how it exists in reality. Thanks to films like The Hangover, comedy skits on TV shows, and YouTube […]\n\nThailand Soft Power: Spreading Thai Cultural Values\n\nIn recent months, there has been a lot of talk about “soft power” in Thailand, with Prime Minister Settha Thavisin creating the National Soft Power Strategy Committee to guide initiatives that will develop and promote soft power industries such as Thai food, tourism, music, and sports. The term “soft power” refers to a countries ability […]\n\nAvoiding Criticism in Thailand while Achieving Success\n\nIn Thai culture, criticism is avoided. As a result, Thailand is often criticized! According to the critics, the Thai people’s avoidance of criticism is stifling the kingdom’s growth into a first world country and economic powerhouse like Japan and South Korea. However, the rulers of Thailand (stretching back to King Mongkut of the mid- 19th […]\n\nWhy Learn Thai? The Cognitive, Cultural & Health Benefits\n\nWhen people talk about the best foreign language to learn, you’ll often hear suggestions like Spanish, French, German, Mandarin, or Japanese. What you rarely, if ever, hear suggested is the Thai language, as it is spoken only in Thailand â which has a population of about 70 million, and is still considered a developing country. […]\n\nThai Marriage Advice – Counseling of Buddhist Monks\n\nIn Thailand there are few professional marriage counselors, except in the upper class social circles of Bangkok. Thai marriage counseling traditionally has been handled by head monks at village temples, and this practice continues to this day â although only a small percentage of Thai couples seek out this assistance when having problems. When Thai […]\n\nGenerosity in Thailand: Having a Water Heart (Nam Jai)\n\nThe Thai word for generosity is “kwaam mee naÌam jai” (à¸à¸§à¸²à¸¡à¸¡à¸µà¸à¹à¸³à¹à¸), which means to “have a water heart”. In Thailand, water is a symbol of abundance. The water in the fields produce rice, and the water in the rivers produce fish. To have a “water heart” thus means to have a heart that creates abundance. […]\n\nTraveling the Eightfold Path in Buddhist Thailand\n\nTraveling in Thailand can be a lot of fun, which is why millions visit the Land of Smiles every year. However, the Kingdom also offers a unique opportunity for personal development and self-growth, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in Thai culture â an experience which can challenge your comfort zones, while providing fresh perspectives on […]\n\nLittering in Thailand: How to Solve the Problem\n\nAnyone who has visited Thailand knows that the Kingdom has a littering problem. It’s not only Thais who are guilty of littering. Tourists are sometimes to blame â especially those who come from countries where littering is common, and strong social stigmas are absent. Thailand has tried many familiar solutions to tackle the littering problem. […]\n\nTraditional Thai Family Culture & Values\n\nThe traditional Thai family has taken a hit in recent decades. The decline began as Thailand started its transition from a predominantly agrarian society to a country with a large manufacturing base and tourism industry. This caused large numbers of young Thai fathers (and mothers) to move to the Bangkok metropolitan area (and other cities) […]\n\nHow to Make Merit in Thailand\n\nIn Thailand, “making merit” is an important activity for Buddhists. In the Thai language, it’s referred to as “tham boon” (à¸à¸³à¸à¸¸à¸), which means “do good deeds”. The word “boon” is derived from Pali word “punya,” which means a tool to purify the mind. Buddhists thus view merit as a tool for purifying the heart of […]\n\nWhy Does Thailand Have So Many Temples?\n\nIn our last post, we answered the question, “How many temples does Thailand have?” Now, let’s move on to another commonly asked question, “Why does Thailand have so many temples?” To begin, it should be recognized that temples in Thailand are not simply places of worship. They also function as a unique kind of Thai […]\n\nHow Many Temples Does Thailand Have?\n\nEveryone knows that Thailand has a lot of temples, but just how many exactly? The number of temples in Thailand is tracked by the Buddhist Monastery Department (à¸à¸­à¸à¸à¸¸à¸à¸à¸¨à¸²à¸ªà¸à¸ªà¸à¸²à¸). According to the department’s latest figures, there is currently 43,005 temples in Thailand (only five of which do not have Thai monks living on the premises). Of […]\n\nA New Thailand Curriculum Framework (Competency-Based)\n\nFor decades education reform has been on the agenda in Thailand, with experts encouraging a transition from the current content-based curriculum to a competency-based curriculum (CBC). This new curriculum framework would emphasize the acquisition of skills and knowledge that can be applied to daily life, instead of the rote content learning that typifies the education […]\n\nMetal Bodh Gaya Chedi in Thailand w/ Baby Buddha Statue\n\nThailand is a Kingdom of Temples. It also is filled with sacred chedis (stupas), especially in the Northeastern province of Sakon Nakhon. Many chedis in Thailand are inspired by the famous Buddhist chedis of India. For example, Phra Chedi Sadaeng Pathom Thesana (à¸à¸£à¸°à¹à¸à¸à¸µà¸¢à¹à¹à¸ªà¸à¸à¸à¸à¸¡à¹à¸à¸¨à¸à¸²) is a replica of the Dhamek Stupa located in Varanasi, India, which […]\n\nDo Thais Like Foreigners Who Can Speak Thai?\n\nForeigners in Thailand are notorious for their bad takes about Thai people and culture. And although it is counterintuitive, the worst takes are often by foreigners who have lived in Thailand the longest. We were reminded of this again recently on seeing a farang teacher warn “newbies” against learning to speak Thai. The old expat […]\n\nWan Ok Phansa: Its Meaning & History in Thailand\n\nWan Ok Phansa (à¸§à¸±à¸à¸­à¸­à¸à¸à¸£à¸£à¸©à¸²) literally means the “Rains Retreat Exit Day”.

In 2023, it is celebrated on October, 29th, the first day of […]\n\nRespect in Thai Culture & Language\n\nRespect is an integral part of Thai culture. It is deeply entwined with how the people of Thailand conduct themselves in their personal, professional, and public lives. Respect also is related to other aspects of Thai culture, such as saving face, being “greng jai,” and performing the wai greeting. Thailand remains a very hierarchical society. […]\n\nKing Bhumibol Adulyadej Memorial Day: Royal Projects\n\nHM King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great Memorial Day (Oct. 13th) honors the life and achievements of King Rama IX, who was the longest-reigning monarch in Thai history.

In Thailand, there are basically three kinds of toilets: the traditional Thai toilet, the Western flush toilet, and a combination of the two.
