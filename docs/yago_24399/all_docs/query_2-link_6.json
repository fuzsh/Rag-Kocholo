        "text": "Lining Ratchadamnoen Avenue are rows of architecture that mostly date back to over 70 years ago. In the past five years, some of these buildings have been turned into museums for people to visit and learn about Thai history and art. Nonetheless, not many people know there are at least five museums along this avenue and each of them are within walking distance. To promote visits to these five museums, the King Prajadhipok Museum and the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration have been running the Museum Route campaign until the end of this month.\n\nThe museums are the King Prajadhipok Museum and its sister museums the Thai Cabinet Museum, the Royal Thai Orders and Decorations Museum, plus the Parliament Permanent Exhibition. There are also the Nitas Rattanakosin Museum (Rattanakosin Exhibition Hall) and the Ratchadamnoen Contemporary Art Centre. Under the campaign, a free shuttle service from the city hall near the Giant Swing to the five museums is available on Saturdays and Sundays every 20 minutes throughout the day except from between noon-1pm. In addition, the opening hours of some of these museums are extended on weekends and admission is free under certain conditions.\n\nThe objectives of the project are to promote museum visits, enhance co-operation among Thai museums and increase the number of visitors to each museum. Another special aim is to celebrate the 60th birthday of Her Royal Highness Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn who wishes to see the development of museums nationwide for the sake of education.\n\nOn this museum route, each trip begins at the King Prajadhipok Museum which tells of the lives and work of King Rama VII and Queen Rambhai Barni through exhibitions, old documents, photos and the two monarchs' personal belongings.\n\nStepping onto the first floor of the adjacent Rambhai Barni building, visitors will enter the Parliament Permanent Exhibition, which is about the National Administration Advisory Council founded under absolute monarchy in the reign of King Rama V, which was to change in 1932.\n\nWalking up to the second floor, visitors reach the Thai Cabinet Museum which mainly tells of national administration during the periods of Sukhothai, early Ayutthaya and Rattanakosin, as well as the national administration at present. It details the history and important information of all the constitutions and cabinets since 1932.\n\nStrolling to the third floor, visitors enter the Royal Thai Orders and Decorations Museum which displays all kinds and levels of royal Thai decorations and orders as well as foreign royal decorations that were given to Thai royals and ministers.\n\nAbout 500m away and next to Wat Ratchanaddaram is the Nitas Rattanakosin Museum. It houses a permanent exhibition about Bangkok that uses modern technology and focuses on interactive self-learning. Visitors are educated about the capital of Thailand through models, four-dimensional mixed media, multi-touch media, multimedia and animation. It has nine exhibition rooms.\n\nSeparated from the Nitas Rattanakosin Museum by a small alley is the Ratchadamnoen Contemporary Art Centre. The centre was established in 2010 to serve as a new art space, a learning centre, an art gallery and a place for students and the public to join in creative art and cultural activities.\n\nTo experience all the important things these museums have to offer, visitors should spend at least two hours each at the King Prajadhipok Museum, the Nitas Rattanakosin Museum and the Ratchadamnoen Contemporary Art Centre and about half an hour in each of the other places. By taking the first Museum Route van at 10am, visitors are most likely to see everything in one day.\n\nTravel Info\n\nFor more information about the Museum Route, contact the King Prajadhipok Museum on 02-280-3413/4 ext 111 or 105, or the King Prajadhipok Institute's communication centre on 02-141-9752/4."
