        "text": "On 21 February 2024, Mrs. Cholatip Kambhu Sangrat, spouse of the Ambassador, led the delegation of the ASEAN Spouses’ Circle in Washington DC to pay a visit to the Larz Anderson House. This historic mansion served as the accommodation for King Prajadhipok and Queen Rambhai Barni during their visit to the United States in 1933, marking the first ever visit of the King of Thailand to the United States.\n\nThis mansion was also the venue for a dinner reception to commemorate the 190th anniversary of Thai-U.S. diplomatic relations in June last year, which was attended by more than 250 friends of Thailand and the U.S. who have contributed greatly to the Thai-U.S. alliance."
