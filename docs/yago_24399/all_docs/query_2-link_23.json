        "text": "With a population of under four million and some 42.5 million sheep, New Zealands image to the outside world has been one of a conservative nation - sitting out on the periphery of the world - a meticulously clean, green coin du monde, as the French would say it so neatly.\n\nAsians excelled at the shearing exercise\n\nThat is still basically true to most of the world. But to the ever-increasing number of tourists, New Zealand is the new frontier of adventure, sport, breath-taking scenery and a magnificent, unspoiled environment.\n\nOn the world stage, who would know that New Zealander Richard Pearse took the worlds first flying machine aloft - two years before the better-known Wright Brothers were air-borne in 1904?\n\nEveryone knows that Sir Edmond Hillary was the first person to conquer the - up to that time, 1953 - insurmountable Mount Everest; but would anyone know that New Zealander Baron Ernest Rutherford split the atom in 1919 - some 25 years before the technology reached European war-mongers? He also succeeded in detecting and transmitting wireless waves a year before Marconi (ca. 1900).\n\nNew Zealand broke the United States hold on the longest-standing sporting record - the Americas Cup - thrashing the mighty Americans in San Diego in 1995 and humiliating the not-so-mighty Italians this year at Auckland.\n\nA Maori war canoe on display at Waitangi National Reserve\n\nNew Zealand, in 1893, was the first country to give women the franchise (not all men were too happy about that - and many still are unhappy), and the first country to introduce the eight-hour working day (EVERYONE was happy about that!).\n\nAnd, as you fasten your jacket with velcro tabs, to board an Air New Zealand flight bound for the new adventure-land, be reminded that a New Zealander invented the tear-back velcro strip, used to fasten a huge range of items - from running shoes and boat-fittings to watches and art gallery exhibits - around the world.\n\nSome 250 km due north of Auckland, along the Twin Coast Discovery Highway, a well-surfaced and most scenic route, is the marvellous Bay of Islands - certainly one of New Zealands show places.\n\nOn the way, as one finds all over New Zealand, are several places of historic, cultural and, always, of scenic interest. Close to the Bay of Islands is the birthplace of the nation, the Waitangi National Reserve.\n\nThis splendidly laid-out natural park is, indeed, a walkway through the countrys by-ways of history, from the early Polynesians of a millennium ago, up to the arrival of the European some 800 years later. The Bay of Islands, in fact, was a focus of the South Pacific whaling industry, with the town now known as Russell as the centre. The introduction of muskets, as a major item of trade and barter, was the catalyst for the many conflicts which broke out.\n\nAt Sheepworld, a hands-on experience\n\nThe Treaty of Waitangi, finally signed by more than 500 Maori chieftains, was enshrined on 21 May, 1840. All the artefacts have been preserved in superb condition and even the massive Maori War Canoe which used to carry up to 80 warriors is on display, re-launched each year, to commemorate the anniversary of Waitangi.\n\nThe beauty of this 500-hectare reserve is not only a monument to New Zealand history, but it is also a tribute to one of the worlds cleanest, greenest countries. The park and its environs are immaculate - so much so that I felt like suppressing a sneeze which crept up on me!\n\nThe Cream Trip, which leaves from the lovely little seaside town of Paihia, is a journey into Natures own swimming pool, as our craft moved among a huge number of islands, calling at many for mail deliveries and supplies on what used to be a dairy run. All through the shimmering gulf we were accompanied by schools of dolphins, innumerable sea birds and many other manifestations of unfettered Nature at her best.\n\nPaihia itself, in spite of its smallness, is remarkably cosmopolitan, with many good restaurants, bars and coffee shops, all in walking distance along the seafront.\n\nA stay at the Abri Apartments in Paihia was like living in a tree-house. After so many years surviving in some of the worlds most clamorous cities like New York and Bangkok, the peace, quiet and tranquillity of this beautifully appointed unit (only two), was overwhelming. As one local resident said it so well, the silence here is deafening.\n\nA meal at the Only Seafood Restaurant, with certainly the best seafood I have ever tasted, was well complimented with a crisp, clean Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc. Thank you New Zealand Tourism Board and Air New Zealand for a return to life the way it should be!\n\nBack on the road to Auckland there was time for a stop at Sheepworld. On the way there, as fate would have it, the radio on my Budget Rental car (which I am most happy to report, by company policy, had removed cigarette lighter and ash tray, with a rather forceful strip sealing the gap thus created), had a newscast which went something like this: Due to a shrinking market for lamb and wool, the sheep population of New Zealand is down to 42.5 million. (That is still about 11 sheep for every man, woman and child in the country.)\n\nThe announcer pointed out that this latest count had taken years to complete because, every time a census-taker was sent out to count sheep, he or she inevitable fell asleep!\n\nThe visit to Sheepworld was, again, another great experience, with the Asians in the group excelling at the hands-on shearing operation.\n\nThen, it was back to Auckland, for the end of this New Zealand odyssey and fly back to grubby, noisy Bangkok.\n\nSo, Pattaya Mail readers can now relax, for this is the last of the New Zealand epics which have been featured over the past month. But be forewarned, this special Mail correspondent has not yet been to the South Island!\n\nWith the Thai Baht hovering around 17-18 to the New Zealand dollar, there could hardly be a better time to Go South than now.\n\nIndependence Day is the national holiday of the United States of America commemorating the signing of the Declaration of Independence by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nAt the time of the signing the US consisted of 13 colonies under the rule of Englands King George III. There was growing unrest in the colonies concerning the taxes that had to be paid to England. This was commonly referred to as Taxation without Representation as the colonists did not have any representation in the English Parliament and had no say in what went on. As the unrest grew in the colonies, King George sent extra troops to help control any rebellion. In 1774 the 13 colonies sent delegates to Philadelphia Pennsylvania to form the First Continental Congress. The delegates were unhappy with England, but were not yet ready to declare war.\n\nIn April 1775 as the Kings troops advanced on Concord Massachusetts Paul Revere would sound the alarm that The British are coming, the British are coming as he rode his horse through the late night streets. The battle of Concord and its shot heard round the world would mark the unofficial beginning of the colonies war for independence.\n\nThe Liberty Bell, with its inscription - Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land Unto All the Inhabitants Thereof\n\nThe following May the colonies again sent delegates to the Second Continental Congress. For almost a year the congress tried to work out its differences with England, again without formally declaring war.\n\nBy June 1776 their efforts had become hopeless and a committee was formed to compose a formal declaration of independence. Headed by Thomas Jefferson, the committee included John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Philip Livingston and Roger Sherman. Thomas Jefferson was chosen to write the first draft which was presented to the congress on June 28. After various changes a vote was taken late in the afternoon of July 4th. Of the 13 colonies, 9 voted in favor of the Declaration, 2 - Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted No, Delaware undecided and New York abstained.\n\nTo make it official John Hancock, President of the Continental Congress, signed the Declaration of Independence. It is said that John Hancock signed his name with a great flourish so King George can read that without spectacles!\n\nThe following day copies of the Declaration were distributed. The first newspaper to print the Declaration was the Pennsylvania Evening Post on July 6, 1776. On July 8th the Declaration had its first public reading in Philadelphias Independence Square. Twice that day the Declaration was read to cheering crowds and pealing church bells. Even the bell in Independence Hall was rung. The Province Bell would later be renamed Liberty Bell after its inscription - Proclaim Liberty Throughout All the Land Unto All the Inhabitants Thereof.\n\nAnd although the signing of the Declaration was not completed until August, the 4th of July has been accepted as the official anniversary of United States independence. The first Independence Day celebration took place the following year - July 4, 1777. By the early 1800s the traditions of parades, picnics and fireworks were established as the way to celebrate Americas birthday. And although fireworks have been banned in most places because of their danger, most towns and cities usually have big firework displays for all to see and enjoy."
