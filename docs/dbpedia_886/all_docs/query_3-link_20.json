        "text": "EUROPEAN UNION COMMON POSITION Chapter 27: Environment - Main contents\n\nCONFERENCE ON ACCESSION Brussels, 22 December 2010\n\nTO THE EUROPEAN UNION\n\n– CROATIA – PUBLIC\n\nAD 50/10\n\nLIMITE\n\nCONF-HR 41\n\nACCESSION DOCUMENT Subject: EUROPEAN UNION COMMON POSITION Chapter 27: Environment\n\nAD 50/10 CONF-HR 41/10 1 EUROPEAN UNION COMMON POSITION\n\n(Revision of CONF-HR 5/10)\n\nChapter 27: Environment\n\nThis position of the European Union is based on its general position for the Accession Conference with Croatia (CONF-HR 2/05), and is subject to the negotiating principles endorsed by the\n\nAccession Conference (CONF-HR 5/05), in particular:\n\n– any view expressed by either party on a chapter of the negotiations will in no way prejudge the position which may be taken on other chapters;\n\n– agreements - even partial agreements - reached during the course of the negotiations on chapters to be examined successively may not be considered as final until an overall\n\nagreement has been established;\n\nas well as to the requirements set out in points 13, 16 and 26 of the Negotiating Framework.\n\nThe EU underlines the importance for Croatia of compliance with the Stabilisation and Association Agreement as well as the Accession Partnership, which constitute basic elements of the preaccession strategy.\n\nThe EU encourages Croatia to continue the process of alignment with the acquis and its effective implementation and enforcement, and in general develop already before accession, policies and instruments as close as possible to those of the EU.\n\nThe EU notes that Croatia, in its addendum (CONF-HR 36/10) of 11 November 2010 to its position CONF-HR 17/08 accepts the acquis under chapter 27 as in force on 1 November 2010, while requesting some transitional measures.\n\nAs an overall response to Croatia's requests for transitional periods, the EU recalls its general negotiating position that transitional measures are exceptional, limited in time and scope, and accompanied by a plan with clearly defined stages for the application of the acquis. They must not involve amendments to the rules or policies of the EU, disrupt their proper functioning, or lead to significant distortion of competition.\n\nIn the light of the 4 June 2004 agreement and the relevant European Council and Council conclusions the EU calls on Croatia to continue to fully respect its commitment not to apply any aspect of the Croatian Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone to the EU Member States until a common agreement in the EU spirit is found. The EU notes that the above mentioned commitment shall also be respected, inter alia, from the entry into force of the Arbitration Agreement between\n\nSlovenia and Croatia, signed in Stockholm on 4 November 2009, until the arbitration award has been fully implemented.\n\nHorizontal legislation\n\nThe EU takes note of the progress made by Croatia in further aligning its legislation with the acquis in this sector. Croatia will need to continue to put emphasis on its implementation, in particular in the area of environmental assessments and climate change, especially on implementation of the EU Climate and Energy Package (which includes legislation on the EU Emission Trading System (EU\n\nETS), effort sharing, carbon capture and storage, fuel quality and CO2 and cars), as well as on\n\nF-gases and ozone layer legislation. The EU notes that a regulation and a programme for development and management of the Environmental Protection Information System was adopted allowing for collection and processing of environmental data and reporting to the European\n\nEnvironment Agency (EEA) in line with the acquis. The EU takes note of the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding on Croatia's participation in the Civil Protection Financial\n\nInstrument and the Memorandum on its participation in the Community Civil Protection\n\nMechanism. The EU notes that Croatia will join the European Environment Agency upon accession.\n\nAs regards climate change, the EU takes note that Croatia has been aligning its legislation with the acquis in this field, has committed itself to align with the remaining acquis in this area by 2011 and to implement it by the date of accession, while requesting some transitional periods. The EU takes note that the National Strategy for the implementation of the UN Framework Convention on\n\nClimate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol was prepared and the relevant Action Plan adopted in 2008 as part of the National Air Quality Protection and Implementation Plan for the period 2008-2011. The EU notes the transposition of Directive 2003/87/EC i establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community, the adoption of a National\n\nAllocation Plan (NAP) and the establishment of a registry. The EU takes note that Croatia has undertaken to have the amendments introduced to Directive 2003/87/EC i by Directives\n\n2008/101/EC and 2009/29/EC so as to include aviation activities in the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community partially transposed by the end of 2010. The EU notes that Croatia foresees to complete transposition including incorporation of relevant elements of the Commission Decision 2009/339/EC on the inclusion of monitoring and reporting guidelines for emissions and tonne-kilometre data from aviation activities in 2011. The EU underlines the importance of Croatia respecting its commitments under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. The EU takes note that, as regards the post-2012 climate regime, Croatia associated itself with the\n\nCopenhagen Accord and proposed a GHG (greenhouse gas) reduction target for itself as well as expressed its will to, upon its accession to the EU, be a part of the EU mitigation effort.\n\nThe EU takes note of the climate change acquis already implemented by Croatia, which includes inter alia the Monitoring Mechanism Decision (280/2004/EC). The EU notes that Croatia indicates that it is in a position to ensure fulfilment of the reporting obligations under this Decision in a timely and complete manner upon its accession to the EU.\n\nThe EU notes that Croatia has requested a transitional period as regards the application of Directive 2003/87/EC i establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading (EU ETS) within the Community, as amended, until 31 December 2012. The EU notes that Croatia started monitoring of emissions in January 2010, meaning that verified emissions will not be available before March 2011. Pursuant to the procedures for considering and accepting the NAP provided for in Article 9, paragraph 1 and Article 11, paragraph 2 of Directive 2003/87/EC i, Croatia will not be in a position to revise the existing NAP within the deadlines set in these Articles, namely by January\n\n2012. Furthermore, in view of the changes in the EU ETS as of 2013, a NAP for Croatia would only be valid for 2012, and in the new centralised system in place from 2013 there will be no more\n\nNAPs. In view of this, the EU considers the request by Croatia to join the EU ETS in 2013 acceptable.\n\nThe EU further notes that Croatia has requested specific transitional periods from the application of certain provisions of Directive 2003/87/EC i as last amended by Directive 2009/29/EC until\n\n31 December 2013 relating to the aviation sector. The EU notes that Croatia has requested to be fully included in the EU ETS for aviation as from 1 January 2014. The EU finds these requests acceptable, and to this effect Directive 2003/87/EC i shall be applied in Croatia as set out in section 1, part A of the Annex of this document.\n\nThe EU takes notes that Croatia, with regard to Directive 2003/87/EC i, as last amended by\n\nDirective 2009/29/EC so as to improve and extend the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme of the Community, has requested that the average annual total quantity of allowances issued by Croatia to be taken into account for the calculation of the EU-wide quantity of allowances for the period 2013-2020 (referred to in Article 9, first paragraph, second sentence) be 9,080 Gg CO2eq, which will be adjusted on the basis of Article 9a (this adjustment resulting from the change of scope of Directive 2009/29/EC, which will render necessary the adjustment, in accordance with Article 10 of Decision 406/2009/EC, of the maximum quantity of emissions for Croatia under Article 3 of that Decision). The EU further notes that it is necessary to determine by how much to increase the\n\nCommunity-wide quantity of allowances pursuant to Articles 9 and 9a of Directive 2003/87/EC i as a result of the accession of Croatia (\"Croatian Total Cap\"). The EU notes that the best available data method was used to calculate the Croatian Total Cap and that the EU-wide total cap will be raised only with the amount of auctioning rights that Croatia will receive pursuant to Article 10(2) of\n\nDirective 2003/87/EC i. The EU therefore considers this request acceptable, and to this effect\n\nDirective 2003/87/EC i shall be amended as in section 2, point 1 of the Annex of this document.\n\nWith regard to auctioning rights related to increases in the percentage of allowances to be auctioned by Member States, it is necessary to determine the auctioning rights for Croatia for the installations which will be included in the EU ETS from 2013 onwards. The EU notes that Croatia has requested that a provision in respect of Croatia be added to Annex IIa of Directive 2003/87/EC i, as amended by Directive 2009/29/EC, relating to increases in the percentage of allowances to be auctioned by\n\nMember States pursuant to Article 10(2)(a) for the purpose of Community solidarity and growth in order to reduce emissions and adapt to the effect of climate change as follows: 'Croatia 26%'. The\n\nEU notes that these calculations have been based on accepted data such as Eurostat data. The EU finds this request acceptable, and to this effect Annex IIa of Directive 2003/87/EC i shall be amended as in section 2, part 1(b) of the Annex of this document.\n\nThe EU also notes that Croatia has requested a transitional period from the application of\n\nRegulation (EU) No 920/2010 until 31 December 2012 and from the application of Articles 16, 29, 41, 46 and 54, and Annex VIII of the same Regulation relating to the aviation activities until\n\n31 December 2013 with regard to all flights between two aerodromes situated in Croatian territory, and all flights between an aerodrome situated in Croatian territory and an aerodrome situated in a country outside the EEA area. On the basis of the information provided by Croatia, the EU considers this request acceptable, as it is linked to the above request to join the EU ETS only in\n\n2013. To this effect Regulation (EU) No 920/2010 shall be applied in Croatia as set out in section 1, part A of the Annex of this document.\n\nWith regard to Decision 406/2009/EC on the effort of Member States to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Community's greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments up to\n\n2020 (Effort Sharing Decision, ESD), the EU takes note that Croatia has requested that a provision in respect of Croatia be added to Annex II of the ESD as follows: Croatia 11%. The EU notes that the limit of greenhouse gas emissions from the economic sectors not covered by the EU ETS, the percentage of which shall be added to Annex II, has been determined for the period 2013-2020 on the basis of per capita GDP for 2005, according to the same rules and principles applied for\n\nMember States under Decision 406/2009/EC. The EU finds the requested percentage of +11% acceptable, and to this effect Decision 406/2009/EC shall be amended as in section 2, point 2 of the Annex of this document.\n\nThe EU takes note that Croatia continues the preparations for the full implementation of the acquis in the field of fluorinated greenhouse gases (Regulation (EC) No 842/2006) and ozone layer protection (Regulation (EC) No 1005/2009 i) as well as committed to transpose all the remaining acquis related to climate change (ESD, Carbon Capture and Storage Directive, fuel quality\n\nDirective, CO2 and cars Regulation) which will be completed by the end of 2011.\n\nAs regards administrative capacity, the EU notes Croatia's continued capacity building, at the national, regional and local level, in line with the Action Plan. The EU takes note of the new structure of the Croatian Environment Agency in place since December 2008 providing for a substantial increase in staff and better division of tasks in response to the acquis requirements.\n\nAir quality\n\nThe EU takes note that Croatia has reached a high level of alignment with the acquis in the field of air quality. The EU notes that Croatia has ratified protocols to the Convention on Long-Range\n\nTransboundary Air Pollution and the Gothenburg Protocol. The EU notes that the National Air\n\nQuality Protection and Implementation Plan for the period 2008-2011 were adopted in May 2008. The EU underlines the need to continue implementing the acquis, including through upgrading and further development of the monitoring network. The EU notes that Croatia also needs to continue taking measures to gradually reduce the pollution, along the limit values for certain pollutants set by the acquis.\n\nThe EU takes note that Croatia has withdrawn its requests for transitional periods until\n\n31 December 2017 with regard to Article 5, paragraph 1 and Annex III of the Directive 1999/30/EC i on limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead in ambient air (i.e. Article 13, paragraph 1 and Annex XI, item B of Directive 2008/50/EC i) in the part related to application of limit values for particulate matter PM 10 in ambient air for the agglomerations of Zagreb, Rijeka, Sisak and Kutina, as well as regarding Article 4, paragraph 1 and Annex II, Item 1 of the Directive 1999/30/EC i (i.e. Article 13, paragraph 2 and Annex XI, item B of Directive 2008/50/EC i) in the part related to the limit values for nitrogen oxides in ambient air for the agglomerations of Zagreb and Rijeka.\n\nThe EU notes that measures will be taken, in line with the National Air Quality Protection and\n\nImprovement Plan, to reduce the pollution to meet the requirements of the acquis. The EU considers that the planned measures to reduce concentration levels and the use of Article 22 of\n\nDirective 2008/50/EC i will provide for adequate implementation of the Directive. The EU will closely monitor the attainment of the different environmental objectives.\n\nWith regard to the application of provisions of Annex XIV of Directive 2008/50/EC i related to the establishment of the national exposure reduction target (ERT) and the average exposure indicator\n\n(AEI) for PM 2,5 , the EU takes note that Croatia has requested that the reference year for AEI be\n\nX+2, X representing the year of Croatia's accession to the EU. The EU considers this acceptable, and to this effect Directive 2008/50/EC i shall be applied in Croatia as set out in section 1, part B of the Annex of this document.\n\nAs regards Croatia's request for a transitional period until 31 December 2012 with regard to\n\nArticle 3 paragraph 2, Article 4 paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, Article 5 paragraph 2 and Article 6 paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Directive 94/63/EC i on the control of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions resulting from the storage of petrol and its distribution from terminals to service stations, the EU takes note of the information Croatia has provided in an implementation plan concerning the type, throughput, location and number of installations covered by the Directive, and a current degree of their compliance, as well as an implementation plan with assessment of costs, information on financing sources and timetables for investment. The EU can accept the request for a transitional period until 31 December 2012, and to this effect Directive 94/63/EC i shall be applied in Croatia as set out in section 1, part B of the Annex of this document.\n\nWith regard to Croatia's request for a transitional period until 31 December 2012 with regard to\n\nArticle 3, paragraph 2, subparagraph e, Article 4, paragraph 1, subparagraph e, and Article 4, paragraph 5 of Directive 98/70/EC i, the EU notes Croatia's clarification that following the adoption of Directive 2009/30/EC i which has amended the respective Articles, this request now relates to\n\nArticle 3, paragraph 2, first subparagraph, Article 4, paragraph 1, first subparagraph, and Article 4, paragraph 2, first subparagraph of the Directive, respectively. The EU takes note that during this period modernisation of the two refineries would be completed allowing for production of fuels complying with the requirements of the acquis. This pending, only a part of the liquid fuels produced in domestic refineries would comply with requirements of the Directives.\n\nThe EU takes note of the more detailed information Croatia provided concerning types, quality and quantity of fuels produced by the domestic refineries (including types and quantity of those complying with the acquis requirements), and of the fuels exported and imported, fuel prices and market structure. Croatia also provided an implementation plan for the refineries, including assessment of costs related to investments, identification of financing sources and a timetable with milestones. The EU can accept the request for a transitional period until 31 December 2012, and to this effect Directive 98/70/EC i shall be applied in Croatia as set out in section 1, part B of the Annex of this document.\n\nThe EU takes notes of Croatia's clarification that its request for a transitional period as regards\n\nDirective 1999/32/EC i does not cover the provisions of Article 4a, paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, referring to ships sailing in the SOx Emission Control Areas and Article 4c, in the parts where Article 4a is referred to, as these provisions are already binding upon it and are fully implemented by Croatia under Annex VI of the international Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships\n\n(MARPOL 73/78).\n\nAs regards administrative capacity, the EU takes note of the continued capacity strengthening of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, Physical Planning and Construction, including inspection services, and of the Croatian Environment Agency. The EU underlines the importance of a proper monitoring of the air quality. In this regard, the EU notes that the Meteorological and Hydrological Service started as of April 2009 performing expert tasks related to air quality monitoring through its Service for Air Quality.\n\nWaste management\n\nThe EU takes note that Croatia is highly advanced in its transposition of the acquis in this sector.\n\nThe EU also notes that Croatia has continued alignment with the new Framework Directive on\n\nWaste 2008/98/EC. The EU notes the establishment of a system for management of certain categories of waste (packaging waste, waste oils, waste batteries and accumulators, end-of-life vehicles, electrical and electronic equipment, waste tyres). The EU notes that Croatia operates systems for collection and treatment of certain categories of waste, including electrical and electronic equipment, packaging waste and end-of-life vehicles. The EU encourages Croatia to pursue the work on implementation, and to ensure that it complies with the acquis in particular as regards construction of the waste management centres and remediation of the existing landfills and hot-spots.\n\nThe EU takes note that Croatia in its addendum CONF-HR 36/10 modified its request for a transitional period from 31 December 2015 to 31 December 2018 with regard to Article 14, point c for items 2-7 of Annex I of Directive 1999/31/EC i on the landfill of waste. Croatia has provided an implementation plan for the Directive, including plans on remediation and closure of the existing landfills, number of landfills, envisaged costs, financing sources and timetable with milestones.\n\nCroatia has also provided information related to construction of new landfills complying with the acquis requirements, including costs, financing sources and a timetable with milestones. The EU notes that Croatia assessed, taking into account the considerable investment needs and the scope of work to be undertaken, that the deadlines for establishment of an integrated waste management system needed to be extended to 2018. The EU notes that during the period until 2018 remediation of the existing landfills and their conversion into transfer stations or recycling yards will continue in parallel with the construction of the new landfills within the waste management centres, complying with the requirements of the Directive. The EU considers that the requested transitional period until 31 December 2018 for the remediation of existing landfills and the building of new waste management centres to comply with the requirements of the Directive is acceptable, and to this effect, Directive 1999/31/EC i shall be applied in Croatia as set out in section 1, part C of the Annex of this document.\n\nThe EU takes note of Croatia's request for a transitional period until 31 December 2020 with regard to Article 5 paragraph 2, points a, b and c of the Directive 1999/31/EC i on the landfill of waste. The EU notes that during this period the share of biodegradable municipal waste going to landfills would be gradually reduced to reach the requested level of 35 % of the amount in the reference period. Croatia has provided an implementation plan for the Directive, providing standardised data on the amount of biodegradable municipal waste going to landfill in the reference period and currently, and a plan outlining gradual reduction of that amount with a timetable and milestones, as well as related costs.\n\nThe EU considers that on the basis of the information provided by Croatia its request for a transitional period until 31 December 2020 is acceptable, and to this effect, Directive 1999/31/EC i shall be applied in Croatia as set out in section 1, part C of the Annex of this document.\n\nThe EU takes note that Croatia requests to set 1997 as a base year instead of 1995 as stipulated in the Directive, since systematic monitoring of waste-management related data could not be implemented in 1995, whereas data are available for 1997. The EU considers these reasons adequate and can therefore accept Croatia's request to use 1997 as a base year. To this effect,\n\nDirective 1999/31/EC i shall be applied in Croatia as set out in section 1, part C of the Annex of this document.\n\nThe EU takes note that Croatia continues to pursue efforts on strengthening administrative capacity in this area, in line with the Action Plan, specifically at the regional and local level and of the inspection services responsible for acquis implementation and enforcement. The EU takes note of the strengthening of the Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund providing financial resources for development and implementation of several projects, including remediation of landfills, construction of waste management centres and establishment of systems for collection and treatment of certain categories of waste.\n\nWater quality\n\nThe EU takes note that Croatia has adopted the new Water Act and the Water Management\n\nFinancing Act in December 2009. Croatia has started adopting implementing legislation which it plans to have in place by the end of 2010. The adoption of these Acts as well as the implementing legislation, which Croatia has committed to have in place by 2010, fulfils the requirements of the first closing benchmark as set out in the EU common position (CONF-17/08).\n\nThe EU further takes note of Croatia's action plan as regards River Basin Management Plans, in which Croatia sets out that it foresees adoption of its two River Basin Management Plans for the\n\nDanube and the Adriatic river basin districts in November 2011. The EU notes that Croatia has committed to transposing Directive 2008/56/EC i establishing a framework for Community action in the field of marine environmental policy and to implementing it in accordance with the deadlines stipulated therein.\n\nThe EU takes note of the information provided by Croatia concerning implementation of Directive 2000/60/EC i establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (Water\n\nFramework Directive). The EU takes note of the fact that Croatia has withdrawn its request for a transitional period until 31 December 2020 with regard to Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC i. The\n\nEU underlines that the development in this area will be closely monitored.\n\nThe EU takes note that Croatia has reduced its request for a transitional period from\n\n31 December 2030 to a maximum of 31 December 2023, with intermediate deadlines until\n\n31 December 2018 and 31 December 2020, with regard to Articles 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of\n\nDirective 91/271/EEC i concerning urban waste water treatment.\n\nThe EU notes that during this period construction of the urban wastewater collection and treatment systems, meeting the acquis requirements, would be completed. The EU takes note of the information Croatia provided on the implementation of this Directive, specifically with regard to the identification of sensitive areas and on the current status with regard to wastewater collection and treatment systems. The EU also takes note of the additional information Croatia provided with regard to the request for transitional periods for the implementation of this Directive, namely an implementation plan, including costs and sources of financing, strengthening administrative capacity, timetable and milestones, reflecting priorities set out by the Directive and including a break down by different categories. The EU notes that Croatia has designated all inland waters as sensitive areas, whereas other waters are designated as normal areas with the concurrent appropriate treatment.\n\nThe EU takes note that the shortening of the deadlines for meeting the requirements of the Directive in relation to Croatia's initial position, has significantly increased annual investments foreseen.\n\nAnnual investment costs foreseen have also increased due to the expansion of the areas designated as sensitive in comparison to Croatia's initial position. The EU acknowledges that implementation of this Directive requires important financial outlays and thus necessitates a thorough balancing with other investment needs. The EU therefore invites Croatia to make best use of all available resources. The EU also notes that Croatia has provided a plan with clearly defined stages for the application of the Directive, covering costs and financing strategies. The EU can accept the requested transitional period, and to this effect Directive 91/271/EEC i shall be applied in Croatia as set out in section 1, part D of the Annex of this document.\n\nWith regard to Directive 91/676/EEC i on the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates, the EU takes note that Croatia has withdrawn its requests for transitional periods until\n\n31 December 2012 with regard to Article 6 of the Directive 91/676/EEC i concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources, in relation to monitoring of surface waters and groundwater. The EU notes that Croatia provided a timetable, milestones, estimated costs and sources of financing related to development of the monitoring network and the monitoring programme. The EU notes that Croatia has committed to set up the monitoring of surface waters and groundwaters by the date of accession at the latest.\n\nThe EU further notes that Croatia has withdrawn its request for a transitional period until\n\n31 December 2019 with regard to Article 5, paragraph 4 which refers to the measures stipulated in Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC i, pertaining to the construction of livestock manure storages. The EU notes that Croatia will prepare an Action Programme, pursuant to Article 5, at the latest by the date of accession within which it shall establish the necessary intermediary period for farms in terms of fulfilling the requirement of construction of livestock manure storages. The EU notes that this intermediary period that this intermediary period will not exceed the first Action Programme period, namely four years after accession.\n\nThe EU takes note that Croatia has withdrawn its request for a transitional period until\n\n31 December 2020 with regard to Article 9 and 14 in relation to Annex I part B and Annex III of the Directive 98/83/EC i on the quality of water intended for human consumption. The EU notes that Croatia now requests a transitional period until 31 December 2018 with regard to the microbiological parameters as set out in Annex I – Part A and Part C of the Directive. The EU notes that during this period construction of public water supply systems ensuring compliance with the acquis are to be completed. The EU notes that the implementation plan Croatia provided reflects the priorities set out by the Directive, including detailed information on different parameters, current limit values and their alignment with the acquis requirements, estimated investment costs, sources of financing, a timetable and milestones. The EU considers that the request for a transitional period is acceptable, and to this effect Annex I of Directive 98/83/EC i shall be applied in Croatia as set out in section 1, part D of the Annex of this document.\n\nThe EU notes that Croatia will start implementing directly the new Bathing Water Directive\n\n2006/7/EC as of the date of accession.\n\nThe EU takes note of the ongoing capacity building of the Ministry of Regional Development,\n\nForestry and Water Management, including both directorates for water management. The EU underlines the importance of a continued strengthening of administrative capacity in the water quality sector, in particular at the regional and local level, and with respect to inspection services, in line with the Action Plan. The EU takes note of Croatia's intention to finalise reorganisation of\n\nCroatian Waters by the end of 2010, so as to allow for a better division of tasks and effective water management, in line with the requirements of the acquis. The EU also stresses the importance of continuing to develop coordination mechanisms and improving cooperation between administrative bodies involved in the acquis implementation and enforcement in the field of water quality.\n\nNature protection\n\nThe EU takes note of the continued progress by Croatia in its alignment with and implementation of the acquis in this area. The EU notes that the National Strategy and the Action Plan for the\n\nProtection of Biological and Landscape Diversity in Croatia were adopted in 2008.\n\nWith regard to Directive 92/43/EEC i on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, or Habitats Directive, the EU takes note of Croatia's confirmation that a list of proposed sites of Community importance will be prepared by the date of accession and submitted to the\n\nCommission and that Croatia will apply the protection measures foreseen in Article 6(2), 6(3) and 6(4) of the Directive on the day of accession for all sites included in the national lists. With regard to Directive 2009/147/EC i on the conservation of wild birds (Wild Birds Directive), the EU takes note of the confirmation by Croatia that the list of special protection areas will be designated by the date of accession and the confirmation by Croatia that it will apply in these areas the protection measures under the Directive by the date of accession.\n\nThe EU notes that Croatia has withdrawn its request for a reservation with respect to finalising the list of marine NATURA 2000 sites. The EU notes that with regard to the finalisation of this list in line with the requirements of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC i and the Birds Directive\n\n2009/147/EEC, Croatia will submit to the Commission a substantial list of marine Natura 2000 sites by the date of accession on the basis of scientific knowledge available at that moment. The EU notes that Croatia will pursue research and development of scientific data on the basis of which a\n\nsubsequent comprehensive set of designations will be finalised.\n\nThe EU takes note of Croatia's requests for amendments to Annexes to the Habitats Directive and Wild Birds Directive. As regards amendments to the Annexes of these Directives, the EU recalls the importance of these Directives for a balanced and sustainable development. The EU notes also\n\nCroatia's request for granting authorisation for sale of certain species according to Article 6(1) of\n\nDirective 79/409/EEC i. The EU takes note of the scientific information Croatia provided substantiating the request.\n\nThe EU further takes note of Croatia's intention to request geographical restrictions, in particular with regard to hunting certain species which are not threatened in Croatia and thus qualify as game species and with regard to trade in such species in cases where they have been captured by legal means. The EU takes note of the scientific information Croatia provided substantiating the request.\n\nThe EU underlines the importance of further administrative capacity building in the field of nature protection, in particular at the regional and local level, including public institutions for management of national and nature parks, and other protected areas, and with respect to the inspection services\n\n(nature protection inspection and veterinary inspection). The EU stresses also the need to continue improving coordination mechanisms and cooperation between the numerous administrative bodies involved in the acquis implementation and enforcement in this area.\n\nIndustrial pollution control and risk management\n\nThe EU takes note of Croatia's full alignment in this sector in particular of the IPPC and Seveso II Directives. The EU also notes that definitions related to installations have been aligned with the acquis. The continued alignment in this sector, including the alignment of definitions of installations, fulfils the requirements of the second closing benchmark as set out in the EU common position (CONF-HR 17/08).\n\nThe EU takes note of Croatia's request for a transitional period until 31 December 2017 with regard to Article 5 paragraph 2 of the Directive 2008/1/EC i on integrated pollution prevention and control\n\n(IPPC). The EU notes Croatia's commitment that during this period the existing IPPC installations are to be modernised to comply with the requirements of the acquis. The EU takes note that Croatia has completed the inventory of IPPC installations and started the issuance of IPPC permits. The EU notes that Croatia provided an implementation plan for the Directive, including detailed information concerning type, number and location of the IPPC installations, a time schedule for issuing permits for them, as well as plans for their alignment, including estimated costs, sources of financing and a timetable with milestones. Croatia also provided export figures for industrial plants concerned and information on the potential transboundary effects and Croatia's ability to meet requirements of other pieces of the EU environment acquis resulting from a delayed compliance.\n\nThe EU takes note that Croatia has specified its initial request for a single transitional period for all installations and now requests transitional periods for 67 existing installations for which compliance dates range from 31 December 2012 to 31 December 2017. The EU underlines the importance of this Directive for environmental protection, including transboundary aspects, and the internal market. The EU notes the confirmation by Croatia that all new and substantially changed installations will operate in accordance with the Directive's requirements by the date of accession at the latest, or by the start of operation where this takes place after accession. The EU recalls that transitional periods are only granted on a case by case basis. In view of the above, the EU can accept the requested transitional periods as specified in the implementation plan, and to this effect\n\nDirective 2008/1/EC i shall be applied in Croatia as set out in section 1, part E of the Annex of this document.\n\nThe EU takes note of Croatia's request for a transitional period until 31 December 2017 with regard to Article 4 paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Directive 2001/80/EC i on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants. The EU takes note of Croatia's commitment that during this period the plants will be brought into compliance with the Directive requirements. The EU takes note of the information provided by Croatia on the number of the\n\n\"existing\" and the \"new\" plants (as defined in the Directive). The EU also takes note of the implementation plan Croatia provided, including information on the current and envisaged SO 2 ,\n\nNO x and dust emissions, estimated investment costs, source of financing, a timetable and milestones.\n\nThe EU notes that the necessary investment costs are high and therefore need to be spread over time. The EU also notes that the request is accompanied by a plan with clearly defined stages for the application of the acquis. The EU also takes note of Croatia's commitment that all other combustion plants will comply at the date of accession and that important improvements will be reached by 2017. In view of the above, the EU can accept the requested transitional periods, and to this effect Directive 2001/80/EC i shall be applied in Croatia as set out in section 1, part E of the\n\nAnnex of this document.\n\nThe EU takes note that Croatia has modified its request for a transitional period until\n\n31 December 2015 with regard to 74 installations with regard to Article 5 and Annexes IIA and IIB of the Directive 1999/13/EC i on the limitation of emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents in certain activities and installations. The EU notes that Croatia now requests a transitional period for the same duration, namely until 31 December 2015, for a total of\n\n49 installations.\n\nThe EU notes that in Croatia's implementation plan for this Directive a detailed compliance timetable is given for each installation, including more detailed information on type, location of installations, estimated costs of investment and sources of financing, and information on the potential transboundary effects of a delayed compliance, and calls on Croatia to continue to explore possibilities to limit the negative effects of a possible transitional period, including potential distortion of competition. The EU notes Croatia's clarification that during the requested transitional period these installations will be modernised to comply with the requirements of the Directive. The EU notes that in the revised addendum CONF-HR 36/10 Croatia supplements its request regarding a derogation from the full implementation of Directive 1999/13/EC i by requesting a transitional period up to 31 December 2015 for the application of Article 5(3)(b) of this Directive concerning the requirements to apply BAT (best available techniques) for coating processes in shipbuilding within six shipyards. The detailed information is also contained in the implementation plan.\n\nThe EU notes that the necessary investment costs are high and therefore need to be spread over time, that the request would not lead to significant distortion of competition in the internal market and that the request is accompanied by a plan with clearly defined stages for the application of the acquis. In view of the above, the EU can accept the requested transitional periods.\n\nThe EU notes Croatia's continued strengthening of the administrative capacity in this sector, in line with the Action Plan, particularly of inspection services.\n\nChemicals\n\nThe EU notes that Croatia has fully transposed Directive 98/8/EC i concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market and is a party to the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent\n\nProcedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade.\n\nThe EU notes that Croatia has started preparations for implementation of Regulation (EC)\n\n1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals\n\n(REACH) and adopted in April 2008 the implementing Act, which will enter into force upon accession. The EU notes that the National Chemicals Strategy has been adopted as well as a\n\nNational Strategy for Chemicals Safety. The EU notes that Regulation 1907/2006 i is also addressed under chapter 1, Free movement of goods.\n\nThe EU takes note of several requests put forward by Croatia in the revised addendum regarding the application of the REACH Regulation.\n\nThe EU takes note that Croatia requests the following adaptation periods for application of Articles 23, paragraphs 1 and 2, and 28 of the REACH Regulation defining the deadline for the registration and pre-registration of the substances mentioned therein:\n\n– in case of Croatian accession on or before 1 January 2012, an adaptation period of six months after the accession date for pre-registration of phase-in substances as referred to in Article 28. The dates for the first and second registration deadline prescribed by Article 23, paragraphs 1 and 2 would fall on the same date, namely 31 May 2013, whereas the third registration\n\ndeadline under Article 23, paragraph 3 remains unchanged.\n\n– in case of a later accession, Croatia requests an adaptation period of six months after the accession date for pre-registration of phase-in substances as referred to in Article 28. The dates for the first and second registration deadline prescribed by Article 23, paragraphs 1 and\n\nregistration deadline under Article 23, paragraph 3 remains unchanged.\n\nAD 50/10 CONF-HR 41/10 21 The EU also notes Croatia's request for a transitional period of six months from the accession date for application of Articles 6, 7, 9, 17, 18 and 33 of the Regulation. The EU also notes Croatia's request for an adaptation period for application of transitional arrangements specified for any substance included in Annex XIV: if the latest application date falls before accession, and if the latest application date falls less than six months after the accession date, Croatia requests an adaptation period of six months from the date of accession for sending applications for authorisations.\n\nWith regard to the issue of the transfer of rights from the Only Representative to Croatian companies upon Croatia's accession to the EU, the EU notes Croatia's request for clarification of the issue of fees. The EU confirms that no fees will be imposed when transferring 'ownership' of data in the dossier from the Only Representative to the parent company, provided that no changes are made in the dossier or there is no new information which would require processing by the European\n\nChemicals Agency (ECHA) and payment of a fee in line with the REACH Regulation. Certain additional information that is specific to dossiers submitted by a manufacturer, but which is normally not contained in a registration submitted by an Only Representative can also be included without triggering a fee. In those cases it will be assumed that all registration costs by the Only\n\nRepresentative have already been covered by the Croatian manufacturer. Practical details of implementation of the ownership transfer procedure, and the evidence which Croatian companies will have to present to ECHA, will be agreed with the European Commission and ECHA by the date of Croatia’s accession to the EU at the latest.\n\nThe EU notes Croatia's commitment to implement the REACH Regulation as from the date of its accession. As to Croatia's requests for adaptation of the deadlines described above, the EU finds these acceptable, in order to allow sufficient time for preparation of the registration dossiers and authorisation applications. To this effect, Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 i shall be applied in Croatia as set out in section 1, part F of the Annex of this document.\n\nAs regards administrative capacity, the EU takes note that the Ministry of Health and Social\n\nWelfare (MoHSW) is the lead agency for the organisation and coordination of thematic inspectoral surveillances on chemicals. The Department for chemicals within the MoHSW and the heads of departments of the seven county sanitary inspection services are in charge of the coordination of inspectoral surveillance. The EU further notes the importance of continued strengthening of administrative capacity, including of the Croatian Institute of Toxicology and the sanitary inspection, in line with the Action Plan.\n\nGenetically modified organisms (GMOs)\n\nThe EU takes note that Croatia has completed aligning its legislation in this sector and continues to progress with its implementation. As regards administrative capacity, the EU takes note of the establishment of the Department for Development of the Scientific System within the Ministry of\n\nScience, Education and Sports and the Department of Plant Production within the Ministry of\n\nAgriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development, both competent for GMOs. The EU also notes that within the MoHSW, the Department for GMO Control is responsible for inspecting and monitoring contained use of GMOs thereby completing the overall system of inspection services for GMOs.\n\nThe EU notes Croatia's continued strengthening, in line with the Action Plan, of the capacity of the bodies competent for GMOs, including laboratories and inspection services. The EU notes in this respect that the Department for GMO Control within the MoHSW and the heads of department of the seven county sanitary inspection services are in charge of the coordination of inspectoral surveillance. The EU notes also that Croatia in 2009 established two Councils: the GMO Council and the \"Council for deliberate release of GMOs into environment and their contained use\".\n\nNoise\n\nThe EU notes that Croatia has completed aligning its legislation in this sector with the acquis. The EU invites Croatia to continue work on implementation, notably on development of noise maps and action plans.\n\nThe EU notes Croatia's continued strengthening of the capacity of sanitary inspection. The EU also notes that the MoHSW is responsible for the organisation and coordination of inspections related to noise. To this end, inspectors from the MoHSW and the heads of department of the seven county sanitary inspections services are in charge of coordinating inspectoral surveillances.\n\nForestry\n\nThe EU notes that Croatia has completed alignment of its legislation in this sector with the acquis, and continues its implementation. The EU notes the implementation by Croatia of the National\n\nForestry Programme, the establishment of the gene- and the seed banks, as well as setting up the genetic bank of forest tree species. The Forest Fire Register has been operational since 2009.\n\nThe EU notes the continued strengthening of the administrative capacity in this area, including the Forestry Directorate in the Ministry of Regional Development, Forestry and Water Management, forestry inspection and the Forestry Advisory Service.\n\nAdministrative capacity and alignment of the legislation\n\n1.\n\nThe EU takes note of the completion of alignment in the sectors forestry, GMOs and noise.\n\nThe EU also notes that Croatia has continued alignment as regards horizontal legislation, air quality, water quality, waste management, nature protection and chemicals.\n\n2.\n\nWith regard to capacity building of administrative bodies at all levels, the EU takes note that\n\nCroatia has, in line with the Action Plan, continued to strengthen that capacity. The EU notes that most ministries and expert institutions were reorganised during 2008 and the beginning of 2009 in order to strengthen administrative capacities and enable more efficient enforcement of legislation.\n\nThe EU also notes that Croatia has continued to improve coordination of work.\n\nThe EU notes that Croatia has continued its alignment in the sectors indicated above, continued to strengthen its administrative capacity, further improved its coordination of work and demonstrated that adequate administrative structures and enforcement capacity will be in place by accession.\n\nThus, the requirements of the third and fourth closing benchmarks set out in the EU common position (CONF-HR 17/08) have been fulfilled.\n\n* * *\n\nIn view of all of the above considerations, the EU notes that, at this stage, this chapter does not require further negotiations.\n\nMonitoring of progress in the alignment with and implementation of the acquis will continue throughout the negotiations. The EU underlines that it will devote particular attention to monitoring all specific issues mentioned above with a view to ensuring Croatia's administrative capacity.\n\nParticular consideration needs to be given to the links between the present chapter and other negotiation chapters. A final assessment of the conformity of Croatia's legislation with the acquis and of its implementation capacity can only be made at a later stage of the negotiations. In addition to all the information the EU may require for the negotiations in this chapter and which is to be provided to the Conference, the EU invites Croatia to provide regularly detailed written information to the Stabilisation and Association Council on progress in the implementation of the acquis.\n\nIn view of all the above considerations, the EU will, if necessary, return to this chapter at an appropriate moment.\n\nFurthermore, the EU recalls that there may be new acquis between 1 November 2010 and the conclusion of the negotiations.\n\n________________________\n\nANNEX\n\nLEGAL AMENDMENTS ARISING FROM THE DCP\n\n1. TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS\n\nA. HORIZONTAL LEGISLATION\n\n1.\n\n32003 L 0087: Directive 2003/87/EC i of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC i (OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32).\n\n(a) With regard to all flights between two aerodromes situated in Croatian territory, and all flights between an aerodrome situated in Croatian territory and an aerodrome situated in a country outside the EEA area (referred to as \"additional aviation activities\"), the following transitional arrangements to Directive 2003/87/EC i shall apply:\n\n(i) By way of derogation from Article 3c(2), the period referred to in Article 13(1) and\n\nbeginning on 1 January 2013 shall start on 1 January 2014 for the additional aviation\n\nactivities.\n\n(ii) By way of derogation from Article 3c(4), the Commission shall decide, following the\n\nprocedure referred in that same provision, on the historical aviation emissions for the\n\nadditional aviation activities within 6 months from the date of accession of Croatia to\n\nthe EU.\n\n(iii) By way of derogation from Article 3d(2), from 1 January 2014, the percentage of allowances to be auctioned for the additional aviation activities shall be the proportion of the allowances remaining after calculating the number of allowances to be allocated free of charge under point (d) of Article 3e(3) and calculating the number of allowances to be set aside in a special reserve under Article 3f.\n\n(iv) By way of derogation from Article 3d(3), the attributed aviation emissions from additional aviation activities shall be decided upon by the Commission for the reference year 2010 on the basis of the best available data. The number of allowances to be auctioned by Member States whose total attributed aviation emissions includes those from flights arriving from a Croatian aerodrome, shall be adjusted from the year 2014, in order to reallocate auctioning rights related to these emissions, to Croatia.\n\n(v) By way of derogation from Article 3e(1) the monitoring year for the additional aviation activities shall be 2012, and any application for an allocation of allowances shall be made to the Croatian competent authorities by 31 March 2013.\n\n(vi) By way of derogation from Article 3e(2), Croatia shall submit applications related to the additional aviation activities by 30 June 2013.\n\n(vii) By way of derogation from Article 3e(3), the Commission shall adopt a decision on the matters referred to in points (a) to (e) thereof, in relation to the additional aviation activities by 30 September 2013.\n\n(viii) By way of derogation from point (d) of Article 3e(3), for the additional aviation activities the number of allowances to be allocated free of charge shall be calculated by multiplying the benchmark specified in point (e) by the sum of the tonne-kilometre data included in the applications submitted to the Commission in accordance with paragraph 2 adjusted to account for the average change in aviation tonne-kilometre activity covered by the EU ETS relative to 2010 levels. If necessary, the benchmark may be subject to a uniform correction factor to be applied by the Commission.\n\n(ix) By way of derogation from Article 3e(3), for the additional aviation activities, the benchmark referred to in point (e) thereof shall be the same as that calculated for aviation activities covered by the EU ETS from 1 January 2012.\n\n(x) By way of derogation from Article 3e(5), the date of issue of allowances for the additional aviation activities, shall be 28 February 2014.\n\n(xi) By way of derogation from Article 3f, with regard to additional aviation activities, any reference to the second calendar year of the period starting in 2013 shall be as 2014 and any references to the third calendar year of that period shall be to 2015.\n\n(xii) By way of derogation from Article 14(3), for the additional aviation activities, the date set therein shall be 1 January 2013.\n\n(xiii) By way of derogation from Article 18a(1), with regard to additional aviation activities, the reattribution of administrative responsibilities for aircraft operators to Croatia shall take place during the year 2014, after fulfilment by the operator of its 2013 obligations, unless a different date is agreed between the former administering authority and Croatia following a request by the aircraft operator within 6 months from the date the\n\nCommission publishes an update of the list of operators which takes into account the accession of Croatia to the EU. In this case, reallocation shall take place no later than year 2020 with regard to the trading period beginning in 2021.\n\n(xiv) By way of derogation from point 6 of Annex I to the Directive, additional aviation\n\nactivities shall not be included until as from 1 January 2014.\n\n(b) Articles 9a(1) and 11 shall apply to Croatia as from 1 January 2013.\n\n2.\n\n32010 R 0920: Commission Regulation (EU) No 920/2010 of 7 October 2010 for a standardised and secured system of registries pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC i of the European Parliament and of the Council and Decision No 280/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 270, 14.10.2010, p. 1).\n\n(a) Articles 3 and 6 shall apply in Croatia as from 1 January 2013.\n\n(b) Articles 16, 29, 41, 46 and 54, and Annex VIII, relating to the aviation activities, shall apply in Croatia as from 1 January 2014.\n\nB.
