        "text": "Yesterday, Slovakia and Hungary rejected the proposal of the European Commission (EC) to replace the lost shipments of Russian oil with an alternative route through Croatia, saying that it was too expensive.\n\nDeliveries from the largest Russian oil exporter Lukoil via Ukraine were suspended in July after the Ukrainian authorities banned Lukoil from using the Druzhba oil pipeline connecting Russia with Eastern Europe.\n\nEarlier this month, Hungary and Slovakia asked the EC to intervene and mediate because they were threatened with disruption of security of supply, Reuters reported.\n\nHowever, they reject the EC's proposal to use the free capacity on the JANAF Adriatic pipeline in Croatia in order to provide both countries with supplies of oil that does not originate from Russia.\n\n\"Croatia is simply not a reliable country for transit,\" said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto. \"Croatia has increased oil transit prices five times since the outbreak of war in Ukraine.\"\n\nSlovakia, whose Hungarian-owned company \"Slovnaft\" already receives part of its oil through JANAF, announced yesterday that it had received a letter from the Croatian government offering to secure deliveries.\n\n“But at what cost? What capacity? Nobody knows that today,\" said Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar.\n\nReuters writes that Slovakia wants the EC to force Ukraine to fully restore flows from Russia, but has also said it will seek another solution in case the European Union's executive body does not do so.\n\nFollowing Russia's invasion in 2022, the EU banned its members from importing oil in an attempt to get rid of Russian fossil fuels, but granted exemptions to Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to find alternative routes and supplies.\n\nGrlić-Radman: We are taken aback\n\nCroatia is taken aback by the politically deeply offensive statement of the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and considers it not a friendly gesture, said Croatian Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Gordan Grlić Radman, Croatian media reported.\n\n\"We are unpleasantly surprised by Sijart's statement,\" Grlić Radman said.\n\n\"It is a politically deeply insulting statement that we really did not expect from the representative of a country whose ill-intentioned moves we have long responded to with extreme restraint and moderation, guided above all by the awareness that we are neighboring and friendly countries,\" he added.\n\nHe also commented on Budapest's departure from the EU's foreign policy direction.\n\n\"Such a statement is made by the representative of a country whose reliability is amply spoken by the fact that it is faced with questioning of its foreign policy engagement and in fact 'soloing', at the very beginning of its presidency of the Council of the European Union, Grlić Radman said.\n\nThe Croatian Ministry of Economy also responded to Sijart's comments.\n\n\"JANAF continuously invests in the maintenance and safety of its transportation and storage system, and in February 2023, together with representatives of the MOL Group, the transportation capacity of the pipeline was tested on the section towards the Hungarian border. It was determined that it can transport 1,2 million tons of crude oil per month, and JANAF is fully able to meet the crude oil needs of the MOL Group refineries in Bratislava and Budapest,\" the statement said.\n\nThat ministry called on Hungary to \"refrain from further baseless accusations and untruths and to return to constructive dialogue in the interest of mutual prosperity and energy security and ultimate energy independence.\"\n\nJadranski naftovod rejected the allegations from Sijart's statement.\n\n\"It is completely untrue that JANAF increased fees in the past three years. The methodology used to calculate fees takes into account the length and level of utilization of the capacity of an individual section of the pipeline, as well as the negotiation process, and is not tied to a legal entity. JANAF's calculation methodology is known to the representatives of the Hungarian side and is not arbitrary in any case. In this way, we ask Mr. Sijart why the Hungarian side avoids the transportation of crude oil through the JANAF system. We are convinced that the cost of transport is not a factor here.\n\nReuters reports that despite protracted negotiations over transit fees, JANAF and Hungary's MOL managed to sign a one-year contract in May 2023 to transport and store 2,9 million tons of crude oil on the Adriatic pipeline for MOL's Hungarian and Slovakian refineries."
