        "text": "The present area of the Republic of Croatia has had many different social and political circumstances and opportunities for economic development in the past. In relation to Western countries and the rest of Central Europe, Croatia’s development has often been slower, although some branches of the economy have achieved good results. Wars, their consequences, and the subordinate status of the country within state formations, particularly since the First World War, have shaped the economic situation. The economy of any country, including Croatia, is subject to the cause-and-effect association of complex natural geographic, socio-geographic, geo-positional, geo-strategic, historical and other factors. Its population, traffic position and connections, natural energy and ore potentials, along with opportunities to valorise agricultural land, harness and safeguard water supplies, forests and other natural resources, are all extremely important. In terms of sectors, the most significant proportion in the structure of the national economy, about 34% (as high as 49% in 1990), is taken up by secondary activities (industry, mining, construction, craft production). Tertiary activities (transportation, tourism and other service industries) account for about 55% (37% in 1990). Primary activities account for “only” 11% (14% in 1990). These indicators do not reveal the complexity of relations between the different sectors. So, for example, in the primary sector, agriculture as a part of the agro-industrial complex of the country, significantly represented in industrial production too, makes a contribution to tourism and other activities, and so makes a greater overall contribution than the percentage figures show. A fall in the proportion of secondary activities, i.e. production industry activities, is evident, and this is having a negative effect on the country’s further development. One essential component of economic development in Croatia is regional diversity, which enables the different potentials of the Pannonian lowland, Dinaric highland and Adriatic coastland areas of the country to be combined. The wealth of economic resources allows permeation and complementarity, reflected in the creation of joint national wealth. The essential features of the specifically agrarian, industrial, transportation and energy basis of the Pannonian areas, the forestry and livestock basis of the highland area, and the tourist, maritime, shipbuilding and agrarian strengths of the Adriatic area, open the way towards the stable, balanced prosperity of Croatia within Europe. A further contribution is made by the country’s significant maritime traffic orientation, and the important transverse transit traffic routes lying between the Pannonian lowlands and the Adriatic Sea, along with the longitudinal routes along the Adriatic coast (Adriatic-Ionian motorway) and the Sava Basin. In connection with these routes, the most significant economic areas have developed, with centers as the bearers of economic development. These economic centers of gravity are distributed polycentrically throughout Croatia, although the supremacy of Zagreb's economic core is obvious. This means the most important economic area is linked to Zagreb and the wider Zagreb region, while Rijeka, Split, Osijek, Zadar, Slavonski Brod and Varaždin are complex economic centers of gravity in regions of higher or lower economic growth. The urbanized areas of other prominent centers also display growth: Koprivnica in northwest Croatia, Sisak, Karlovac, Vinkovci, Vukovar, Bjelovar, Požega, and Đakovo in Pannonian Croatia, and Pula, Šibenik and Dubrovnik in Adriatic Croatia. However, polycentric, economic development has not been spatially uniform, and smaller economic foci are mostly associated with previous municipal centers. There has been little development in smaller, mostly rural settlements, particularly in the less developed karst, most of the highlands, and the island areas of Croatia."
