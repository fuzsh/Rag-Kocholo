        "text": "Latitude: 45° 13’ N Longitude: 14° 32’ E\n\nBritish Admiralty Chart: 2719\n\nAdmiralty Pilot: 47 Time Zone: GMT +1 h\n\nLocode: HROMI\n\nPort of Omišalj Approach\n\nDepth outside bay approx 55 m, inside bay 30 m with mud and rocks bottom, width at entrance to bay approx 700 m. The port is approached by Vela Vrata, the main channel, which connects Kvarner Bay with the Bay of Rijeka. A Traffic Separation Scheme has been established in Vela Vrata. Large tankers proceed from Vela Vrata to the N part of Rijeka Bay, making a large turn before steering for Omisalj inlet. Chemical tankers and gas carriers may follow a more direct route for the entrance to Sepen Bay. The approach channels to both terminals are marked by lights and light buoys.\n\nPort of Omišalj Anchorage\n\nAn area SW of Urinj with depths of 54-62 m (30-34 fm) is designated for tankers and vessels carrying dangerous cargo.\n\nIt is enclosed by the following points:\n\na) 45°14’1 N ; 14°29’4 E\n\nb) 45°15’1 N ; 14°27’1 E\n\nc) 45°17’8 N ; 14°28’0 E\n\nd) 45°16’1 N ; 14°31’8 E\n\nFor vessels carrying liquefied gas anchorage place is in radius 1,5 NM from position 45° 11,1’ N ;14° 28,7’ E. The bottom is muddy and the holding ground fairly good. However, during NE strong gales (in winter) vessels may be forced to leave this anchorage and seek shelter under the lee of Krk Island.\n\nPort of Omišalj Pilotage\n\nCompulsory. Pilot boarding tankers 6 miles NE of Point Jablanac; however tanker over 200.000 DWT may be boarded on request in the N part of Kvarner, approx 5 miles SSW of Point Prestenice light. Pilot VHF CH 9.\n\nTides / Current / Weather\n\nThe max. tidal range in the bay is normally 1.1 m (3’06”), but the height of tide is much affected by wind conditions. In strong SE winds it may be increased by up to 0.6 m (2’) and in strong NE winds, the low water may be as much as 0.3 m (1’) below. The currents near the terminals are negligible, but in Vela Vrata the S-going current may attain a velocity of 4 knots during strong NE winds. Winds from NE and SE prevail. During the winter season NE winds Bora can reach hurricane force; SE winds may form waves of up to 3 m in Rijeka Bay.\n\nGarbage disposal\n\nAvailable by barge.\n\nBunkers\n\nAvailable by barge from Rijeka on completion of discharge and at anchorage but must be advised at least 48 hrs in advance.\n\nRepairs\n\nRepairs to vessels of up to 60.000 dwt can be undertaken in Rijeka. The shipyard Viktor Lenac in Rijeka has two floating docks with lifting capacities of 12.000 and 24.000 t respectively. There is one floating crane of 100 t lifting capacity in port of Rijeka."
