        "text": "Key Insights\n\nThe considerable ownership by state or government in Jadranski naftovod d.d indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy\n\nA total of 2 investors have a majority stake in the company with 64% ownership\n\nEvery investor in Jadranski naftovod d.d. ( ) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that state or government own the lion's share in the company with 41% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nFollowing a 5.9% increase in the stock price last week, state or government profited the most, but institutions who own 40% stock also stood to gain from the increase.\n\nIn the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Jadranski naftovod d.d.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Jadranski naftovod d.d?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Jadranski naftovod d.d. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Jadranski naftovod d.d's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nHedge funds don't have many shares in Jadranski naftovod d.d. Our data shows that Croatian State Pension Fund is the largest shareholder with 37% of shares outstanding. With 26% and 15% of the shares outstanding respectively, Restructuring and Sale Center and Croatia are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nTo make our study more interesting, we found that the top 2 shareholders have a majority ownership in the company, meaning that they are powerful enough to influence the decisions of the company.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. We're not picking up on any analyst coverage of the stock at the moment, so the company is unlikely to be widely held.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Jadranski naftovod d.d\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nOur data cannot confirm that board members are holding shares personally. Given we are not picking up on insider ownership, we may have missing data. Therefore, it would be interesting to assess\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 13% stake in Jadranski naftovod d.d. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nPrivate Company Ownership\n\nIt seems that Private Companies own 5.5%, of the Jadranski naftovod d.d stock. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the .\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.
