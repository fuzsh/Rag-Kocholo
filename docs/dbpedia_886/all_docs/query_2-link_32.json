        "text": "On January 24th a memorandum of understanding was signed in Zagreb, Croatia between Kazakhstan’s national oil and gas company KazMunayGas (KMG) and the operator of the Croatian oil pipeline system, Jadranski naftovod (JANAF). The memorandum was signed by the deputy chairman of KMG, Bulat Zakirov, and the chairman of JANAF, Stjepan Adanić.\n\nAfter the signing ceremony Mr. Adanić commented that the deal will strengthen exports of Kazakh oil to European markets.\n\nKazakhstan’s ambassador to Croatia Akylbek Kamaldinov, who attended the signing ceremony, emphasized that Kazakhstan is playing an important role in ensuring that the EU receives reliable supplies of energy resources. He noted that the partnership between KMG and JANAF will make a significant contribution to strengthening energy security.\n\nJANAF operates the oil terminal on the island of Krk and the Adria oil pipeline system in Croatia, which plays a key role in transporting oil and petroleum products to the countries of south-eastern Europe. From January-November 2023 more than $303 million worth of Kazakh oil was pumped along this route."
