        "text": "Croatian company Jadranski naftovod (JANAF) has commissioned its first solar photovoltaic power station at its Žitnjak-Zagreb Terminal in Croatia.\n\nStjepan Adanić, chairman of the JANAF management board, said: “The commissioning of the solar photovoltaic power station can be regarded as JANAF’s first step towards contemplating and implementing long-term low carbon development strategy as regards the renewable energy sources.”\n\nThe solar cells cover an area of 600 m2 on the ancillary building of the terminal, and will produce around 108,540 kWh of electricity annually, saving HRK 70,000 per year, and reducing CO2 emissions by 65 tonnes. JANAF funded the construction of the project through its own funds.\n\nHe added: “In a new development strategy of the company, a special focus will be put on identifying the development projects, particularly in the renewables sector, and possibly also in other compatible, propulsive and highly profitable industries of high technologies, with the aim of realising higher revenues and creating new additional values.”\n\nHe also said that JANAF will look at projects that they can finance through European funds such as the Innovation Fund, the European Green Deal and the Recovery Plan.\n\nFor more information visit janaf.hr/en\n\n4th January 2021"
