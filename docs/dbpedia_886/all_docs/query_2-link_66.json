        "text": "Europe is set to see more major solar power facilities Earlier this week, Greek PPC Renewables invited bids from contractors to build a solar power plant with an installed capacity of 550 MW, the biggest in Greece. In Serbia, Fintel Energia and MK Group are developing a 660 MW agrisolar project, which will combine crop production with electricity generation, and in Croatia, El Sun Energy plans to build a 950 MW solar power plant. In France, a 1 GW solar power project is under way, while a power plant with 3,5 million solar panels and a nameplate capacity of 1.35 GW is being installed in Turkey‚Äôs Konya province, south of Ankara.\n\nIndigenous Canadian solar power project to save 290,500 gallons of diesel per year. By ERIN KILGORE Renewable energy farm in British Columbia could be the country‚Äôs largest off-grid solar project. A First Nation indigenous group in Canada has launched a solar power project for what that country‚Äôs federal government is referring to as likely the largest off-grid renewable energy project of its kind in Canada. The project is receiving almost CAD$16 million in government funding The solar power project will be located in the province of British Columbia. It is receiving nearly CAD$16 million (USD$11.67 million) in federal and provincial government funding. It will be built in Anahim Lake, British Columbia, which is home to the Ulkatcho First Nation. Electricity in Anahim Lake is currently diesel generated, as it is not connected to the electrical grid. The solar farm installation will allow the First Nation to substantially reduce their reliance on diesel fuel. https://lnkd.in/dEdrUhYk\n\n‚òÄÔ∏è ‚ÄòWorld‚Äôs largest‚Äô solar plant goes live The 5 gigawatt (GW) installation in China‚Äôs Xinjiang province can generate up to 6.09 billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually. That‚Äôs enough power to light up a country the size of Papua New Guinea for a year. It‚Äôs been built by state-owned Power Construction Corporation. Surging investment in solar is helping China progress towards its 2030 target of having 1.2 terawatts of renewable energy capacity five years early. It‚Äôs 430GW of installed solar capacity is more than double the rest of the world combined. The world‚Äôs next two largest solar plants are also in China ‚Äì the Ningxia Tenggeli and Golmud Wutumeiren complexes can each generate up to 3GW of power. P.S. Europe‚Äôs largest installation is a 605-megawatt installation in Leipzig, Germany, that recently went live.\n\nüåû 2023 Solar energy update Norway üåû >300MW installations in 2023 100% increase in total solar power in Norway! 200% increase 2022-2023 But this is just the beginning! In 1-1,5 years Solar energy in Norway will pass Thermal energy in the total installed capacity. And since wind power on land has stopped in 2022/23 solar is catching up. But I also noticed a change in solar installations. And we have seen that developing the past two years. Businesses and people are installing solar panel more and more during peak solar production seasons. I strongly recommend customers of solar not to wait until spring/summer until you buy solar panels. Purchase early as possible and get them ready well before spring and summer season.

The latest 160 MW Cosoveni project is witnessing one of the fastest tracks toward grid injection, compared to industry, amidst an almost metalic rougthness of the legal entourage that envelops renewable projects all across the EU. Rom√¢nia stands out as the fastest growing RES gigapoles in #Europe and an excellent achiever for the last investment period (2014-2020). From institutions to private the interest is high in the exploitation of the #renewable resources at their's cheapest LCOE design possible and large scale PV is now delivering exactly that. #EneroFurnizare #energyinvestment\n\nNext 10MW of solar PV plant is now connected to the grid! Great news for the Polish renewable energy sector! European Energy‚Äôs team successfully finalized the PV solar plant #Krzecin 10 MW in the Pomeranian region of #Poland. All 3 stations are online now. All 43 inverters are only available and in production now. DNO Switch commands have already been successfully tested in the past. Internal Active Power and reactive power (without DNO) test was successful. European Energy - Polska has 130 MW of installed capacities both wind and solar, as well as 5 GW are in the development pipeline. Since its inception in 2004, European Energy has achieved monumental success by installing approximately 3 GW of Renewable Energy Source (RES) projects on a global scale. In 2022 alone, the company demonstrated its formidable presence by investing around 800 million EUR, and in 2023 with over 1 GW under construction and a remarkable 60 GW under developmental stages in 28 countries.

This powerhouse will not only be Brazil's largest solar plant, but also a green hydrogen hero, powering up an 11.4 GW hydrogen and ammonia facility in Parna√≠ba. With construction set to start in 2025 and an investment of BRL10.3bn, this project is shining a light on renewable energy's potential in Brazil.

FRV added that its foray into Finland coincided with Will & Must‚Äôs plans to reach 1,000 hectares of land dedicated to solar ready for deployment by 2027. ‚ÄúWe are excitedly looking forward to cutting Finland‚Äôs emissions and rapidly boosting the overall green transition together with FRV, which brings to the emerging Finnish photovoltaic market an unparalleled amount of experience in large-scale projects,‚Äù stated Matti Parpala, Mikke Veps√§l√§inen, and Anssi Voipio, Founding Team of Will & Must. ‚ÄúWe also strive to develop the projects in close cooperation with different stakeholders. This way, we hope to demonstrate the benefits to local landowners and communities, which in turn should ensure social acceptance so that the projects can be efficiently constructed.‚Äù In addition to Finland, FRV‚Äôs global renewables pipeline of developments totals 24 GW in countries that include Italy, Spain, Greece, Poland, UK, Chile, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand. #cleanenergy\n\nRestart Energy agrees grid connection for Romania‚Äôs second biggest solar park Agrovoltaics, a subsidiary of Romania‚Äôs Restart Energy group, has concluded an EUR 11.3 million grid connection agreement with transmission system operator (TSO) Transelectrica for the second largest solar park in the country. The 500 MW project will be financed by the US export credit agency, according to a statement from the company. Restart Energy expects construction to begin in the second quarter of 2025 and the project to be completed by the end of 2026. The photovoltaic park, located in the town of ≈ûimand in Romania‚Äôs Arad province, should be able to supply electricity to about 200,000 households. The solar park‚Äôs annual electricity output is projected at over 800,000 MWh. This should help reduce carbon emissions by about 400,000 tons per year, or a total of 12 million tons throughout the operating life of the facility, resulting in EUR 1 billion in environmental benefits, according to the statement.\n\nOriana Power Stock Soars on Successful Solar Project Completion! ‚òÄÔ∏è TrueRE - Oriana Power Ltd, a leader in solar energy solutions, is shining bright!
