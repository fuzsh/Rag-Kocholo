        "text": "Zagreb, 2 August 2024 - to all media - PRESS STATEMENT Reaction of JANAF to the Statements Made by the Hungarian Foreign Minister Zagreb – \"Jadranski naftovod, Plc. rejects the allegations in the statements made by Peter Szijjarto, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary. JANAF makes continuous investments in the maintenance and safety of its transportation and storage system. In February 2023, together with several representatives of MOL Group we tested the transportation capacities of the pipeline in the section towards the Hungarian border and established that it has a capacity of transporting 1.2 million tonnes of crude oil a month. Therefore, JANAF is capable of meeting the needs for crude oil of the MOL Group refineries in Bratislava and Budapest to the full extent. Longstanding partnerships with the largest regional and global vertically integrated oil companies and oil traders are proof of the reliability and trust that JANAF enjoys in the international market. MOL Group is one of those partners: at the moment, MOL Group and JANAF have an ongoing oil transportation contract, just like they did over the last years. The statement made by Mr. Szijjarto regarding MOL Group being unable to conclude a multiannual contract with JANAF is completely untrue. The statement regarding JANAF raising fees over the last three years is completely untrue. The methodology applied to calculate the fees takes into consideration the distance and the level of capacity utilisation for a specific pipeline section, as well as the negotiation process, and is not related to the legal entity. Representatives of the Hungarian side are familiar with JANAF’s calculation methodology, which is by no means arbitrary. We hereby ask Mr. Szijjarto why the Hungarian side avoids crude oil transportation through the JANAF system. We are convinced that the price of transportation is not a factor in the matter. Croatia is a reliable and open country for conducting business, entirely contrary to the statements made by minister Szijjarto. We are completely certain that the many Hungarian entrepreneurs successfully conducting business in Croatia would also reject the statements made by minister Szijjarto. JANAF is technically and organisationally completely prepared to supply central European refineries with the adequate quantities of oil for operations at full capacity. We therefore hope that open negotiations and cooperation will produce a satisfying solution for continuing our longstanding partnership.\" - stated JANAF Plc. Management Board"
