        "text": "Trading a life of crime fighting for absurdist comedy.\n\nWhile still a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department I reached a crisis point. My celebrity had overtaken me insofar as being the \"Writing Cop\" was concerned, and I had to resign just to save my colleagues from the media attention. I considered my first two novels, The New Centurions and The Blue Knight to be merely \"moonlighting\" books, that is, something I did as a hobby apart from my \"real\" work as a cop. The third, The Onion Field, was nonfiction where I had become an investigative reporter. But now I was a \"civilian\" after 14 years and I had a need to write another novel, but one with a distinctive voice that would sustain me if I were able to remain in the writing game. I think my main inspiration was Catch-22, a brilliant novel that I had first read in college as a young cop.\n\nWhat Joseph Heller did in his masterpiece was to dramatize the insanity of war and the stresses that drove people to madness by writing his very serious story using all of the tools of absurdist comedy: irony, satire, hyperbole, and incredible gallows humor. The juxtaposition of a belly laugh followed by a horrific scene produced nearly unbearable dramatic tension throughout that book.\n\nI thought that there are many things in common between war and police work, and dark defensive humor is also the weapon of the street cop as protection against fear and horror and premature demoralizing cynicism that can produce an overwhelming emotional threat. I had personally known more cops who killed themselves than were killed by villains. And I thought, from now on I'll write stories that are the opposite of police procedurals which tell how the cop acts on the job. I'll flip it and dramatize how the job acts on the cop, and gallows humor will be my most potent weapon. The first one was The Choirboys, and that's the voice that I have tried to keep ever since, with a tip of my hat to Joseph Heller. ï¿¼\n\nJoseph Wambaugh's latest Hollywood Station book is Hollywood Hills (Little, Brown & Co., Nov. 2010)."
