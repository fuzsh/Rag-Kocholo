        "text": "This week is the 50th anniversary of Joseph Heller's satirical war novel Catch-22. For some, it's an opportunity to reflect on Heller's innovative injection of absurdist humour into the American post-war novel. For others, it's a moment to recall with fondness a novel they enjoyed years ago. And for me, it's been an excuse for something more humble: actually reading the damn thing.\n\nI've owned a copy for years. But let's face it, it's 500-plus pages long, there are more than 50 characters, and everybody knows what a Catch-22 is – it's one of those things where you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. So did I really need to bother reading it at this late stage?\n\nWell, having arrived 50 years late to the party, I'm pleased to finally be able to answer that question with a wide-eyed, emphatic, rapturous yes.\n\nThe Catch-22 itself is a bureaucratic idiocy so sublime it leaves you staring out the window with wonder. As many of you will already know, the novel is set on a made-up island off the coast of Italy during the second world war, where an American bombing group is stationed. Desperate to impress his superiors, Colonel Cathcart keeps raising the number of missions his men have to fly. Our hero, Yossarian, has flown 50. Driven half-mad by his will to live, he wants out. But he's thwarted by Catch-22, a clause which states that pilots don't have to fly if they are certified as insane, but that being driven mad by fear is fundamentally rational. As it's described in the novel: \"Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to.\" The result, put simply, is that no one can get off the ride.\n\nIt's hard to describe briefly just how gloriously, envelopingly hilarious this logic becomes as the novel unfolds. (I can't remember another book which I've had to put down so frequently to get on with the serious business of guffawing.) Its core paradox – that insanity is sanity – burrows inside everything.\n\nFor Heller, delineating the foolishness of war – and perhaps of bureaucracies more generally – becomes an ecstatic project. Madness runs through every exchange; absurdity informs every character. He creates a whole universe of folly, one where Colonel Cathcart \"had courage and never hesitated to volunteer his men for any target available\". And where Doc Daneeka asserts: \"It's not my business to save lives\". And where Milo, an entrepreneurial officer, bombs his own airfield after striking a deal with the Germans.\n\nIt also manifests in Heller's gleeful use of repetition. Words and phrases are continually paired up so that everything plays snap with everything else. (For instance: \"Dobbs and Captain Flume were so deeply disturbed by Hungry Joe's shrieking nightmares that they would begin to have shrieking nightmares of their own.\") Nothing is allowed to reside in meaning something: instead, everything is mocked by its own echo. The effect, which accumulates over hundreds of pages, is a merciless, absurdist comedy which hints at the awful emptiness at the heart of things.\n\nThe power of Catch-22, for me, is the way in which it plunges into that emptiness at the end of the novel, when the source of its comedy is finally revealed. Throughout, the novel's comic surface has been punctured by shards of Yossarian's traumatic memories of a bombing raid in which a young, enlisted solider bled to death from flak wounds.\n\nBut it's only near the end, when Yossarian finally gives in and reflects fully on the episode – its gruesome details and savage lack of meaning – that the novel is transposed into a tragic key. Sure, it's been funny. But all along the comedy has been an expression of horror; it springs from outraged, stupefied humanity. There seems to be something up for grabs in Catch-22's circular logic – where madness begets laughter, and laughter begets madness – that makes me immediately go back and read it again; which is an impulse I think Heller, Yossarian and the rest of the gang would understand."
