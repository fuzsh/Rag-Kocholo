        "text": "Heller, Joseph\n\nPublication: New York: Simon & Schuster, 1994.\n\nNotes: A terrific association copy of this reissue of Catch-22, one of the great World War II novels and a defining book of the 1960s. This copy is inscribed to Nina Bourne, who was the advertising director at Simon and Schuster when Catch-22 was published. In the new introduction that Heller wrote for this edition, he credits Bourne for her creative ad campaign that helped get this first novel noticed.\n\nThe New York Times' obituary for Bourne noted, \"The campaign she created for Catch-22 is now regarded as a classic. Ms. Bourne was the most passionate in-house champion of the book, a darkly comic tale of World War II by a first-time novelist.\" In Heller's new introduction, written for this edition, he mentions Nina Bourne and describes with wonder her ad campaign (but for some reason doesn't quite link the two).\n\nThis is one of 750 numbered copies signed by Heller issued to coincide with the publication of Catch-22's sequel Closing Time; there was also a new trade hardcover edition released at the same time.\n\nEdition + Condition: Moderate spine fading, else a near copy in a near fine, slipcase. This is no. 375 of 750 signed by Heller on the limitation page.\n\nThis copy is additionally inscribed on the front pastedown, \"Dear Nina, I want you to have a copy of this special edition of a novel with which you are now eternally associated, especially since there are not very many people who want to pay $125 to own one and some have come to me gratis. Also, it's possible you may not have yet seen your glorious name in the preface. Best, as always, Joe. May 24, 1995. East Hampton, N.Y.\"\n\nNina Bourne was close friends with Robert Gottlieb, the editor at Simon & Schuster who discovered Heller and worked with him for years on Catch-22. When Gottlieb left S&S for Knopf, Bourne went with him, which explains why Heller thought she might not have seen the preface to this edition. Gottlieb inherited this book when Bourne died in 2010 and it comes from his estate (with provenance).\n\nItem No: #364154\n\nSold"
