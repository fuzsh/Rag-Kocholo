        "text": "I finished reading Catch-22 by Joseph Heller. I don’t think I’ve ever read a funnier novel or more devilishly detailed characterization. It’s ranked #7 on Modern Library’s Top 100 Novels list.\n\nThe novel satirizes war and the dismissive attitude toward human life that war, by its very nature, encourages. The war machine takes over until there’s nothing human left. Pushing absurdities to the limit. It’s the kind of humor that spotlights horror.\n\nI’m obsessed with satire. What a gift to be able to make people laugh AND drive home a larger message. I’m working on a novel that I think is ripe for satire, but hoo boy, I’m intimidated to even try it. I’m trying to convince myself to be brave.\n\nHeller spent 7 years on the novel.\n\nFun Fact: Catch-22 was originally named Catch-18. Check out this inside look at the title change from The Atlantic between Heller and his editor, Gottlieb:\n\nThe “major, major idiom” phrase at the end is a reference to one of the characters in the novel, Major Major."
