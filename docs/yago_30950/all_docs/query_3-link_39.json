        "text": "\"A CROTCHETY old fogey of 28\" is how Joseph Heller, with shrewd self-knowledge, described his zanily exaggerated alter ego, Yossarian, the cynical bombardier hero of \"Catch-22.\" I found that description when I recently reread Mr. Heller's classic 1961 novel before settling down with an advance copy of his new one, \"Closing Time,\" which purports to be a sequel to \"Catch-22\" and which will be published by Simon & Schuster next month. That description of Yossarian reminded me of my first impression of Mr. Heller, whom I met in 1974 when his second novel, \"Something Happened,\" appeared. He struck me immediately as a crotchety old fogey of 51. He was also amusing and occasionally almost charming.\n\nFive books later, Mr. Heller has evolved into an even more crotchety old fogey of 71. During the only time that I formally interviewed him -- in 1979, just before the publication of his third novel, \"Good as Gold\" -- he did his best to appear winsome, in the evident belief that being seen as lovable would help sell his new book. But the minute he knew the article was safely locked up, the winning ways all but vanished.\n\nText:\n\nFor 20 years now, I have managed to overlook his frequent sulkiness, his gluttonous table manners and his tendency to growl No before he even knows what the question is. I have stayed on good terms with him largely because I relish his aberrant sense of humor and his skewed way of looking at life -- an outlook he insists has changed little since he wrote \"Catch-22.\"\n\nFor many years Joseph Heller and his first wife, Shirley, lived across the courtyard from my husband and me in an apartment building on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. (They separated in 1981 and were divorced in 1984.) More recently, we have become neighbors on Long Island, where Mr. Heller now lives full time with his second wife, Valerie. She was his nurse in 1982, when he struggled to recover from a terrifying neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome, which temporarily paralyzed him. It was while he was convalescing (and falling in love) that Mr. Heller was briefly transformed into someone genuinely amiable, almost angelic. But it took him no time to get used to the idea that he was going to survive, and the amiability quickly evaporated.\n\nIn \"Closing Time,\" fans of \"Catch-22\" will find Yossarian once again fearfully trying to sidestep his own imminent death. When the story opens, the twice-divorced Yossarian is living uneasily in Manhattan, knowing that this time there's no possible way out. Yossarian is now 68, although he should be 78, since 50 years have supposedly passed since he was 28 in \"Catch-22.\" (Confronted with this bent chronology, Mr. Heller says, \"I know, but I decided to ignore it.\")\n\nIn any case, even at 68, Yossarian is too old to sit naked in a tree, as he did in \"Catch-22,\" feigning the insanity that might get him out of flying that next bomber mission he knows will be the death of him. He now calculates (in common with Mr. Heller) that with luck he has seven more years before disintegration sets in and the best he can do is deny, deny, deny -- something that Mr. Heller, if not Yossarian, has been perfecting all his life. Not long after I got to know him, Mr. Heller recommended a book he had found enlightening. It was \"The Denial of Death.\"\n\nAlso alive in \"Closing Time\" are Milo Minderbinder, the calculating mess officer who is now a billionaire arms merchant on a global scale; Milo's foulmouthed sidekick, ex-Pfc. Wintergreen; and the ever-meek Chaplain Tappman, who becomes a sequestered secret weapon when he is discovered by his physicians to be urinating heavy water.\n\nIt is unusual for an author to write a sequel to a classic work of his own and even more singular that he should take up the narrative decades later. While he appears, in \"Closing Time,\" to be fictionally confronting his own mortality again, he is, at 71, very fit. He works out regularly. He has a full head of fluffy white hair. And he is once again in his prepublication winsome mode. Recently, Mr. Heller agreed to answer some questions (and to evade some others) about this hazardous return that he began seven years ago.\n\nBarbara Gelb: You must have been aware, in attempting a sequel to a book as famous and cherished as \"Catch-22,\" and one that has sold in the millions, of the gamble involved. Didn't it make you nervous?\n\nJoseph Heller: No, but I was aware of certain limitations and certain possibilities and certain risks that I was taking. I knew that the new novel should not emulate the old novel on which it was based. \"Closing Time\" takes place 50 years later. It had to be sufficiently different to justify existing on its own.\n\nB.G.: I was surprised to find only a handful of characters from \"Catch-22\" in \"Closing Time.\" How did you determine which characters you would abandon and which, aside from Yossarian, you would bring along?\n\nJ.H.: I omitted most of those characters because they did not fit my concept of the new novel. I did consider, in my early notes, using Colonel Cathcart [ the group commander who kept raising the number of missions ] because I needed some military men for my Washington scenes. But he would have been 90 years old now and hardly credible. This was going to be a novel in which Yossarian himself would be just a part, just incorporated into a broader canvas of our present times. And while \"Catch-22\" begins with Yossarian, \"Closing Time\" begins with the first-person story of a man named Sammy Singer, who becomes the novel's focal character. He announces the scope and concept of this novel in the first sentence: \"When people our age speak of the war it is not of Vietnam but of the one that broke out more than half a century ago and swept in almost all the world.\" In my vision of the book that I wanted to write, Sammy Singer was a paramount narrator -- and much more reliable than Yossarian.\n\nB.G.: And with Sammy, you are for the first time writing seriously about an angst-ridden, authentically Jewish character, aren't you, rather than about such symbolically alienated characters as Yossarian, the mock-Assyrian, and Slocum, the deracinated, generic misfit? I don't include the Jews in \"Good as Gold,\" who were caricatures, or in \"God Knows,\" who were biblical parodies. Am I right in assuming you wanted, this time, to write about Joe Heller, the aging nonobservant Jew, looking back at his life?\n\nJ.H.: I suppose this is the first time I've written seriously about Jewish characters. And it's the first time I've written seriously, rather than satirically, about marriage. There's a different sensibility in this novel, in the Jewish background of two of the characters -- Sammy and his friend, Lew Rabinowitz -- and their wives and, through them, their children. I'm saying, here, that marriage is a most satisfactory state. Sammy and Lew both love their wives, say so, praise them, rely on them. \"Closing Time\" treats marriage as an optimum, desirable state. Yossarian misses it.\n\nB.G.: These characters have the same background as Joe Heller: the Coney Island childhood, the struggling immigrant parents. But then, so does Yossarian -- who, we learn in \"Closing Time,\" is divorced and has been something of a philanderer; he has many of your somewhat cynical social and political and sexual attitudes. He also has aspects of your wary, if loving, relationship with your son -- not to mention a romance with a nurse that is reminiscent of your courtship of Valerie. Are Yossarian and Sammy the two conflicting sides of Joseph Heller?\n\nJ.H.: No. . . . Yes. This is not autobiography. I am not the subject of this novel -- although, in this particular book, I've used more of the details of my own experience and background than I've ever done before. Sammy is based on me and on a friend named Gerald Broidy, for whom I wrote promotional copy in the advertising department of Time magazine during the late 50's, and whom I still see. Many details of Sammy come from my own life and work experience. Many details I give to Yossarian also come from my own life and experience.\n\nB.G.: Would you agree that this self-description by Yossarian in \"Closing Time\" accurately describes Joe Heller: \"a man who likes to be alone much of the time, thinks and daydreams a lot, doesn't really enjoy the give-and-take of companionship all that much, falls silent much of the time and broods and is indifferent to everything someone else might be talking about\"?\n\nJ.H.: That is me, yes.\n\nB.G.: While you're being so candid, will you explain the significance, in \"Closing Time,\" of all three of your main characters -- Sammy, Lew and Yossarian -- having sons all named Michael?\n\nJ.H.: It's to suggest an effect of shared experience, but I don't want to interpret symbolic or esthetic elements of the book before it's available; it's up to the reader to make those interpretations.\n\nB.G.: I won't ask you to interpret any more symbolism, even that of your subterranean basement beneath the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan that obviously represents Hades, and of the terminal itself -- with its hordes of homeless, its runaways, its depraved, and its Police Department holding pen -- which represents a kind of limbo, if not hell. Let me ask you, instead, how you did the research for that. It's all very convincingly described.\n\nJ.H.: I found a very good researcher, Ken Miller, who gave me his own descriptions and also looked up newspaper accounts and other written material for me. I never went near the terminal myself for this book. The only time I ever was inside was long ago, when I went to visit the man I call Lew in the book, when he was ill with Hodgkin's disease, in a place that was best reached by bus.\n\nAND the information about police procedures in the terminal, as well as a detailed physical description of all its levels, came from our mutual friend Jerry McQueen, whom you probably recognized as the model for Larry McBride in \"Closing Time.\" He's the softhearted ex-homicide cop who has retired from the Police Department and who, in this novel, is an even softer-hearted supervisor with an undefined but genial agenda in the Port Authority. After Jerry assured me there was no actual subbasement there, I was free to invent one.\n\nB.G.: So Jerry McQueen is still being useful to you. Do you remember the role he played in your first night out, after you had barely begun to recover from Guillain-Barre syndrome? You had brought Valerie home with you as your nurse. That must have been around 12 years ago.\n\nJ.H.: Wasn't that the night we went to the Russian Tea Room? I couldn't walk, I was still in a wheelchair.\n\nB.G.: And you were still having difficulty with your speech, and with chewing. I couldn't believe you really wanted to dine out in your condition.\n\nJ.H.: I had all you people taking good care of me. I knew it would all work out.\n\nB.G.: Yes, but you were as startled as the rest of us when, without a word, Jerry rolled his car over the curb and pulled it to a stop on the sidewalk, only inches from the restaurant's front door, sprang out, seized you in his arms and whisked you inside. I've never seen you so ebullient, so purely joyful. That night I've always thought you were as close to euphoria as you have ever come.\n\nJ.H.: It was more than euphoria, it was genuine happiness.\n\nB.G.: You informed yourself of every detail of your illness, once you were recovering, didn't you? You even wrote a book about it, \"No Laughing Matter.\" Disease is a theme that runs through all your books. Yossarian, then and now, is abnormally knowledgeable about the minute symptoms of various arcane diseases, fears he has the diseases -- or will soon get them -- and checks himself compulsively into hospitals. Where does this obsession with disease come from?\n\nJ.H.: Nobody knows with certainty what shapes a personality. But I can guess. I could assert that it came from the death of my father during a bungled operation when I was 5. Few people, however, adhere anymore to the Freudian models of developmental theory. I don't. I can point to people whose fathers died and who are not morbidly obsessed. And, conversely, there are others who are similarly obsessed, and whose fathers did not die early deaths.\n\nIt's very hard for me to find a specific cause for the sensitivity to disease that insistently shows up in my work. That it's there, I know. It's been with me for a lifetime. But these fears grow smaller with age, and since Guillain-Barre I'm less afraid of disease. I've never been a hypochondriac. All my life I've gone to doctors only when there were strong symptoms -- and that's been rather infrequently.\n\nB.G.: You said earlier that you don't write about yourself, that \"Closing Time\" is not autobiographical, yet you seem to be deliberately calling attention to autobiographical aspects by your several references in this new book to a character named Joey Heller, and even mentioning Joey's rather widely known bout with Guillain-Barre.\n\nJ.H.: [ Growing a bit cross. ] These autobiographical details of reality are intended to supply a dimension of the factual to a book that's essentially a work of fiction.\n\nB.G.: Speaking of autobiographical detail, I notice that in this book you have a mother bidding a controlled, unemotional goodbye to a soldier-son (Sammy), and then collapsing into uncontrollable grief and tears after he's out of sight. This is something you once told me actually happened between you and your mother, something that profoundly shocked you.\n\nJ.H.: Yeah. But it didn't shock me at the time. I was told about it by my sister long afterward.\n\nB.G.: In \"Closing Time,\" what is Yossarian really meant to be experiencing when he descends, with McBride, deep into the bowels of the Port Authority Bus Terminal and finds himself in the company of, among others, a lot of dead writers?\n\nJ.H.: [ Chuckling. ] What he is experiencing is a cerebral vascular accident -- a transient ischemic attack, in which people hallucinate. That whole episode is a hallucinatory experience. But the things he hallucinates in that underground may have meaning beyond the literal.\n\nB.G.: Well, are you saying that to be in the company of other writers is to be in hell?\n\nJ.H.: No. But if you consider the various areas the writers are found in -- there's the area for those we know were depressed, the one for suicides, the one for alcoholics -- and there's Kafka and Proust. I might be saying that the life of a novelist -- even a successful novelist -- too often can be hell.\n\nB.G.: I asked because I remember your telling me once that in your experience novelists aren't really comfortable in each other's company.\n\nJ.H.: It's true, we don't seem to be. We don't form close friendships, not the ones I know. Maybe they just don't like to be with me.\n\nB.G.: Do you like to be with them?\n\nJ.H.: I do find it somewhat surprising that so many American novelists eventually seem to fall into a state of despair. We've had so many reports of instances of alcoholism and depression and suicide. [ Emphatically. ] I'm not there -- yet. I'm doing very well emotionally -- or I think I am.\n\nB.G.: I find your frequent references to \"Death in Venice\" an interesting literary keynote of Yossarian's obsession with death, and also your use of Wagner's \"Ring\" as a musical counterpoint -- but aren't you stretching a bit in your analogy of Yossarian with Siegfried?\n\nJ.H.: Yes. And Yossarian knows he is kidding around when he extends that parallel.\n\nB.G.: Are you saying that you equate Yossarian's -- and by extension Joe Heller's -- death with \"Gotter dammerung?\"\n\nJ.H.: No, it's not just Yossarian, it's Yossarian in the midst of this cataclysmic atmosphere that I think I've created for the novel. If there is one thesis to this novel, it's that things are coming to an end. They certainly are coming to an end for Yossarian -- and for me and you -- that whole generation that lived through World War II. If you have any question about it, the reappearance of all those ancient men my age and over at the recent celebration of D-Day should dispel that doubt.\n\nB.G.: But are you saying, through Yossarian, that it's your fantasy that when you go, you'd like to know you're taking everyone with you -- or, rather, that when you're annihilated, you want no one else left, either?\n\nJ.H.: No. Of course not. I think the statement in the book actually goes something like this: Milo asks Yossarian, \"Do you really care now if the world comes to an end shortly after you're dead?\" And Yossarian thinks and answers, truthfully, \"No.\"\n\nB.G.: And are you, at the same time, consoling yourself with the thought that the dead, whom you will later, if not sooner, be joining, are, perhaps, more interesting and congenial than the living -- as witness all the brilliant writers wandering that subbasement of the bus terminal?\n\nJ.H.: Again, no. I would not want to be with the drunkards, misfits and suicides Yossarian thinks he is seeing down there. I would much rather be with Kurt Vonnegut or Norman Mailer or Gore Vidal. At least we have the same frame of reference.\n\nB.G.: Getting back to the Port Authority Bus Terminal as a symbol for hell --\n\nJ.H.: It's symbolic, yes, but it's also very real and present. The terminal is a hell on earth.\n\nB.G.: But at the same time, you have also replicated, in that subterranean abode of the dead, the idyllic Coney Island of your boyhood -- with its colossal amusement park and that dazzling carousel and the Cyclone roller coaster and all those other alluring rides and games. That sounds more like your idea of Paradise.\n\nJ.H.: Well, Sammy and Lew -- and even Yossarian -- when they look back at Coney Island, they recall it as a very happy place to have grown up in.\n\nB.G.: Am I right about there being less food in \"Closing Time\" than in your other novels?\n\nJ.H.: Yes, there's less attention to eating. It did not fit this picture.\n\nB.G.: But you do have that burlesque of a wedding feast in the bus terminal near the end, featuring two consecutive meals -- a lavish dinner, followed almost immediately by a lavish supper.\n\nJ.H.: That does fit the picture.\n\nB.G.: Do you still eat two dinners a night?\n\nJ.H.: If they're offered. I can get very hungry after a big meal. My digestion, like Yossarian's, is still perfect.\n\nB.G.: Is \"Closing Time\" your summing-up? Your swan song?\n\nJ.H.: My summing-up, yes. Not my swan song.\n\nB.G.: Will you write another novel?\n\nJ.H.: I have nothing else to do."
