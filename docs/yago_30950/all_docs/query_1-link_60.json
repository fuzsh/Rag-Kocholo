        "text": "SE­LECTING TEN NOVELS that sum up the era we refer to as “the Six­ties” would be a task worthy of a minor Greek demi-deity. And by the Six­ties, I am re­fer­ring to the whole peace-love-do-your-own-thing coun­ter­cul­ture: pot and acid and con­scious­ness ex­pan­sion and free love—lots and lots of free love—and rock & roll and Zap Comix and you know the rest.\n\nSuch a list would not even en­ter­tain the pos­si­bility of in­cluding most main­stream nov­el­ists, in­cluding best-sellers like Saul Bellow, James Mich­ener, Philip Roth, John Up­dike, or my fa­vorite au­thor, James Clavell.\n\nMy first thoughts for such a list would go to sci­ence fic­tion ti­tles that were adopted by coun­ter­cul­tural types (for the sake of con­ve­nience, we’ll call them “hip­pies”), es­pe­cially Frank Her­bert’s Dune and Robert Hein­lein’s Stranger In A Strange Land.\n\nThis ar­ticle orig­i­nally ap­peared on my other blog on Oc­tober 7, 2014. It is posted here now as it fits the theme of this site.\n\nAny such list would have to in­clude J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit and Lord Of The Rings trilogy (which is ac­tu­ally one novel in three large vol­umes). If more fan­tasy books were avail­able, no doubt some would have at­tracted at­ten­tion, but until the un­prece­dented suc­cess of the Tolkien books, few Amer­ican pub­lishers had any fan­tasy in print.\n\nBut there are two so-called main­stream novels that should make any­one’s Top 10 Six­ties Novels: Ken Ke­sey’s One Flew Over The Cuck­oo’s Nest and Joseph Heller’s Catch-22. 1\n\nFor­tu­nately, four years ago I pub­lished a piece on Heller’s book, “Yos­sarian Lives! (and He’s an Oc­to­ge­narian).” As it fits the theme of this site, I have ap­pro­pri­ated it and moved it here. It is in­dented be­tween the first image below (the cover of the first edi­tion of the book) and the final image (Yos­sarian in the cockpit of his plane).\n\nThis is the first US edi­tion of Catch-22 by Simon & Schuster (June 1961) is bound in blue cloth with the top edges of the pages stained red. “First Printing” ap­pears on the copy­right page. The dust jacket has $5.95 on the bottom of the front flap and the au­thor’s pic­ture on the back with no blurbs.\n\nI forgot Yossarian’s birthday!\n\nI found an ar­ticle ti­tled “Catch-22: A Paradox Turns 50 And Still Rings True” for NPR Books and thought, “Holy Min­derbinder! It’s Yossarian’s birthday and I forgot!” I thought this be­cause I saw the Oc­tober in the article’s date­line and reg­is­tered it as for this Oc­tober of 2014. It is not—it was for 2011, meaning that I did forget Yossarian’s birthday. And Doc Daneeka’s and Orr’s and Aarfy’s and Milo’s. But so what!\n\nIf you are over 50—or if you are one of the un­usu­ally lit­erate among the seem­ingly func­tion­ally il­lit­erate gen­er­a­tions that have been fol­lowed us—and you haven’t read Catch-22, you are missing a touch­stone of the post-WWII Amer­ican cul­tural psyche of the ‘we-are-f*cking-up-badly-but-I-still-give-a-damn’ crowd. 2\n\nWhy is Catch-22 a touch­stone? The book’s bitter but ironic de­scrip­tion of modern war-making specifically—and all other forms of uni­lat­eral, au­thor­i­tarian decision-making generally—describes the hypocrisy and in­sanity of our times and jus­ti­fies the para­noia of just about everyone better than any screed ever written by a rad­ical lefty or righty!\n\nThis is the first Dell pa­per­back edi­tion of Catch-22 (1962) that I read in the late ’60s. I found it at Back Date Books & Mag­a­zines on South Main Street in Wilkes Barre, where pa­per­backs were 10¢ each or three for a quarter, with or without the cover intact.\n\nThere was only one catch\n\nMerriam-Webster de­fines catch as a noun as “a hidden problem that makes some­thing more com­pli­cated or dif­fi­cult to do.” This is how Heller de­scribes the catch in his story:\n\n“There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which spec­i­fied that a con­cern for one’s safety in the face of dan­gers that were real and im­me­diate was the process of a ra­tional mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more mis­sions. Orr would be crazy to fly more mis­sions and sane if he didn’t, but if he were sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn’t have to; but if he didn’t want to he was sane and had to.” 3\n\nThe novel’s nar­ra­tive deals with Cap­tain John Yossarian’s at­tempts to find a way out of the war and back home to nor­malcy. I am not going to say any­thing more, ex­cept that the im­por­tance of the book is not in the plot. 4\n\nIf Catch-22 had been made as a black and white film in Eu­rope and came with sub­ti­tles, it would have been a crit­ical rave and an art-house fave.\n\nA corol­lary to the main meaning of catch-22 also found in the book is that “Catch-22 states that agents en­forcing Catch-22 need not prove that Catch-22 ac­tu­ally con­tains what­ever pro­vi­sion the ac­cused vi­o­lator is ac­cused of violating.”\n\nIn the case of the novel, the “agent” stating the corol­lary is an MP, so one could apply this corol­lary to anyone with a police-state men­tality, who ap­pear to abound in our society.\n\nAll catch-22s exist as a threat to the freedom and dig­nity of the in­di­vidual, which should make every catch-22 some­thing to be loathed by everyone, re­gard­less of one’s po­lit­ical bent.\n\nFi­nally, the book is beau­ti­fully written, very funny (if black hu­mor­ously so), oc­ca­sion­ally tragic, and al­ways en­ter­taining and pos­sibly even illuminating!\n\nA must-read to be read now for anyone who has for­gotten the spirit of ‘the Six­ties’ or just never grokked it! And there are many edi­tions to choose from!\n\nPrior to the In­ternet, you would have had to have been a col­lector who haunted spe­cialist used book­stores to see any­thing but new books or the more common ti­tles as used books. Now, finding var­ious edi­tions of fa­vorite books from dif­ferent pub­lishers in dif­ferent coun­ties can be done in a few min­utes at your computer!\n\nThis is the first UK edi­tion by Jonathan Cape (1962), which sports much more in­ter­esting art­work on the dust-jacket.\n\nCatch-22 as a movie\n\nIn 1970, Para­mount Pic­tures turned the suc­cessful novel into an un­suc­cessful movie: Catch-22 was pro­duced by John Calley and Martin Ran­so­hoff and was di­rected by Mike Nichols from a screen­play by Buck Henry.\n\nIt starred Alan Arkin as Yos­sarian and in­cluded Martin Balsam, Richard Ben­jamin, Art Gar­funkel, Jack Gil­ford, Bob Newhart, An­thony Perkins, Jon Voight, and Orson Welles, along with young­sters Bob Bal­aban, Charles Gordin, and Martin Sheen. Plus there’s one of the era’s the sex­iest ac­tresses, Paula Pren­tiss.\n\nBy “un­suc­cessful” above I mean that it did not light the fire of many critics and was a box-office dis­aster, losing mil­lions for Para­mount. Its rep­u­ta­tion as a cin­e­matic dis­aster has fol­lowed it for al­most fifty years.\n\nBut for some of us, Catch-22 was one of the best films of 1970, a year full of fine films. It was an as­tounding adap­ta­tion of por­tions of the book. The movie did cap­ture the bleak, black humor and the often sur­real sit­u­a­tions. While the cast was uni­formly ex­cel­lent, Jon Voight shone as Milo Min­derbinder, es­pe­cially his boy­ishly en­thu­si­astic ex­pla­na­tion of his deal with the Ger­mans to bomb one another’s camps to save time and money.\n\n“Catch-22 was not re­garded as a great suc­cess with the con­tem­po­rary [1970] public or critics. The film ap­peared as Amer­i­cans were be­coming re­sentful of the bitter and ugly ex­pe­ri­ence of the Vietnam War, leading movie­goers to quit seeing [most] war movies of all kinds. 5\n\nDe­spite the film’s com­mer­cial and crit­ical fail­ures, it was nom­i­nated for a BAFTA Award for Best Cin­e­matog­raphy and re­tained a cult fol­lowing. A modern re­assess­ment has made the film a cult fa­vorite; it presently holds an 88% Fresh rating on Rotten Toma­toes.” (Wikipedia)\n\nAs one of the few who saw the movie in the the­aters in 1970, I en­joyed it and rec­om­mended it to others. If memory serves me well (as it still usu­ally does), a very fa­vor­able re­view ap­peared in Rolling Stone that said some­thing along the line of “If this film had been made in Eu­rope, in black and white, and came with sub­ti­tles, it would be a crit­ical rave and an art-house fave.”\n\nThis is the first UK pa­per­back edi­tion of Catch-22 from Corgi Books (1964). It fea­tures a cover that im­me­di­ately brought to my imag­i­na­tion Hitler and Nazis and the SS and swastikas. Ef­fec­tive, Yah? Nein?\n\nAnother blessing from the Internet\n\nSo, is Catch-22 rep­re­sen­ta­tive of the era we refer to as the six­ties? Hell yes! It’s far more rep­re­sen­ta­tive than a lot of the comic books that are turning up as over-produced, over-hyped movies that people sali­vate over. It’s far more rep­re­sen­ta­tive than a lot of the lame rock al­bums that are men­tioned as “clas­sics” from the era.\n\nI am saying this as someone who loves ’60s rock and writes paeans to their glory in my other blogs.\n\nI am saying this as someone who loves comic books and bought them all back then.\n\nI am saying that as one of the few who saw the movie in the the­aters in 1970, I en­joyed it then, I have en­joyed re­watching it since, and I am still rec­om­mending it to others—and that in­cludes you!\n\nHoly Min­derbinder! It was the 50th an­niver­sary of the pub­li­ca­tion of CATCH-22 and I forgot! Share on X\n\nFEA­TURED IMAGE: Alan Arkin as Everyman Yos­sarian dis­playing his at­ti­tude to­wards his su­pe­rior of­fi­cers who keep in­creasing the number of combat mis­sions he has to fly be­fore they let him go home.\n\nFOOT­NOTES:\n\n1 I would un­der­stand anyone wanting to con­sider other main­stream titles—I keep looking at John Barth’s Giles Goat-Boy and sev­eral Kurt Von­negut novels.\n\n2 You know who you are: the ‘I-can’t-read-or-write-cursive-or-sit-through-a-whole-book-and-don’t-give-a-damn’ crowd foisted upon us by an un­der­funded school system, a lost civ­i­liza­tion, and de­ranged politi­cians who seem hell-bent on cre­ating the ne­ces­sity for an ever greater wel­fare so­ciety while damning wel­fare simultaneously.\n\nThis latter crowd is sim­ilar to, but not nec­es­sarily syn­ony­mous with, such groups as those termed ‘li­brulls’ and ‘pro­gres­sives’ and ‘six­ties left­overs.’ They are not to be con­fused with the con­ser­v­a­tive ‘everybody-else-is-f*cking-up-badly-but-I-still-give-a-damn’ crowd, be­tween which there are more sim­i­lar­i­ties than their leaders want us to be aware of. But that’s an­other story.\n\n3 Since the ex­ample is spe­cific to the plot of Heller’s novel, here is a more gen­er­al­ized de­f­i­n­i­tion of the ‘logic’ be­hind Heller’s con­cept for prac­tical, everyday usage:\n\n“A catch-22 is a para­dox­ical sit­u­a­tion from which an in­di­vidual cannot es­cape be­cause of con­tra­dic­tory rules. Catch-22s often re­sult from rules, reg­u­la­tions, or pro­ce­dures that an in­di­vidual is sub­ject to but has no con­trol over be­cause to fight the rule is to ac­cept it.\n\nAn­other ex­ample is a sit­u­a­tion in which someone is in need of some­thing that can only be had by not being in need of it. One con­no­ta­tion of the term is that the cre­ators of the catch-22 have cre­ated ar­bi­trary rules in order to jus­tify and con­ceal their own abuse of power.” (Wikipedia).\n\n4 Of course, as so many vet­erans of the Eu­ro­pean and Pa­cific the­aters of op­er­a­tion dis­cov­ered when they did re­turn home in 1946, their ‘nor­malcy’ wasn’t everyone else’s ‘normal’ anymore.\n\n5 Critic Lucia Boz­zola wrote, “Para­mount spent a great deal of money on Catch-22, but it wound up get­ting trumped by an­other 1970 anti-war farce, Robert Alt­man’s M*A*S*H.”"
