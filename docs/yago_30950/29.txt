"Catch-22" is a satirical novel by American writer Joseph Heller, published in 1961. The book tells the story of American military pilots during World War II. The main plot revolves around a young pilot named Yossarian, who is constantly in a state of paranoia and fear for his life. However, in order to avoid dangerous combat missions, he needs to prove his mental disorder, but here comes the infamous "Catch-22" - a rule stating that anyone who claims to be insane to avoid combat missions is considered sane enough to fly. This absurd and circular logic creates a powerful and darkly humorous critique of bureaucracy and the insanity of war. "Catch-22" remains a classic and influential work in American literature.
