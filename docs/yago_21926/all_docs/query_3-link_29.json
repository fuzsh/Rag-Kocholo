        "text": "Lilli Palmer, an actress on stage, screen and television for more than 50 years, died of cancer Monday in her Los Angeles home. She was 71 years old.\n\nMiss Palmer appeared opposite many leading men of her day, including Fred Astaire, Gary Cooper, Clark Gable, William Holden and Rex Harrison.\n\nIn the 1940's and 50's, she frequently appeared in films and on the New York stage with Mr. Harrison, her first husband, whom she married in 1943. The two made a romantic Hollywood couple, whose appearances were chronicled by society writers. They were divorced in 1957.\n\nBrooks Atkinson, the New York Times drama critic, wrote of their appearance together on Broadway in 1950 in John Van Druten's ''Bell, Book and Candle'': ''Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer play the leading parts with the most beguiling sort of virtuosity. During the last two years New York has seen and admired them separately. Now they are giving a performance together that will have to be described as magic.'' Had Own TV Program\n\nThe two also appeared in Christopher Fry's ''Venus Observed'' (1952) and Peter Ustinov's ''Love of Four Colonels'' (1952) as well as the 1952 film ''The Four Poster'' in which they played shy newlyweds. Miss Palmer in 1953 was named best actress at the Venice International Film Festival for her part in that film. She and Mr. Harrison also performed together in numerous television productions and in 1951 Miss Palmer had her own weekly television program.\n\nOf Miss Palmer's portrayal of Cleopatra in George Bernard Shaw's ''Caesar and Cleopatra'' on Broadway in 1949, Mr. Atkinson wrote that if Miss Palmer's performance ''were any better, mortal theater goers would be dissatisfied with about everything else in the theater. Miss Palmer has caught all the innocence and capriciousness of the part and expressed the myriad aspects of it with lucidity and daintiness.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
