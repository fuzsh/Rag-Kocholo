        "text": "Jan de Hartog's affectionate little tribute to the felicities of matrimony and the double-bed, teasingly tagged \"The Four Poster\" and conveyed through only two characters on the stage, is still a two-character operation in the wistful film version of it made by Producer Stanley Kramer and presented at the Victoria and Sutton Theatres yesterday. The husband and wife of the union, which is documented over a period of forty-five years in seven little boudoir encounters, are the only persons seen on the screen. And the only place in which you see them is in their bedroom. It is plainly a tricky little film.And to be quite candid about it, it is piously sentimental, too—much more so than the stanchly comic version that began a run year on the Broadway stage. Where that delightful recountal concludes with the husband and wife rather gallantly departing the bedchamber in which they had lived for so many years, this one has the wife preceding her husband out of the chamber by way of death—and then returning in her more youthful manifestations to coax and beguile him into joining her in the beyond.This frankly heart-tearing conclusion, which is occasioned by the fact that Allan Scott wrote the script from the stage version that was originally presented in London—not the one that was later presented in New York—is also anticipated by prior sentimentalities in the film, such as the death of the son, which are aggrandized much more than they were on the Broadway stage.The consequence is a series of glimpses of a marriage, from wedding night to final death, that is gay and amusing in some phases, solemn and poignant in other ones and is eventually brought to a fade-out in a forced glow of melancholy sweetness and smiling gloom.The consequence is also a picture that at times runs exceedingly thin and tends to promote some inspection of the plausibility of its characters. Rex Harrison and Lilli Palmer, who play the drama's two roles, are fluid and charming performers but they are stuck with a difficult job. They are asked to pretend to be People who talk a great deal on minor points and whose natures and personalities have no real consistency.Clever and continental, they are nonetheless cast in the roles of presumably innocent, naive and Victorian Americans. Suave and worldly in appearance, they are even expected to convey a sense of confusion and embarrassment in approaching their nuptials. The subtleties of homely suggestion that Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy got on the stage are obviously not in the performances that Mr. Harrison and Miss Palmer give.However, they are fetchingly nimble in getting about the single set that an audacious Mr. Kramer has serenely provided for them. Their faces are bright and mobile, which is good, for Director Irving Reis has shot much of them in close-up for the climate of intimacy. And, regardless of plausibility, they are pleasant company, being graciously domestic people and blandly and winsomely droll.To space the episodes of the story and to suggest the outside world, Mr. Kramer has used cartoon sequences created by U. P. A., the company of animators that is doing wonders in the cartoon field. These little animated drawings, while full of gay humor and charm—except for one sobering abstraction, symbolizing the brutality of war—are not altogether consistent with the sentimental mood of the film and have the distracting nature of unrelated entertainment interludes.\n\nTHE FOUR POSTER, screen play by Allan Scott, based on the play by Jan de Hartog; directed by Irving Reis; cartoon sequences created by United Productions of America and directed by John Hubley. A Stanley Kramer Company Production presented by Columbia Pictures. At the Victoria and the Sutton Theatres.John . . . . . Rex HarrisonAbby . . . . . Lilli Palmer"
