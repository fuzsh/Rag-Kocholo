        "text": "Rex Harrison became a legendary star of stage and screen during a career that spanned most of the 20th century, but it would be wrong to think he was beloved by all. With six marriages and a fatal love affair, it’s safe to assume that his reputation for being hard to work with extended into the domestic sphere. He may have been Doctor Dolittle in his time, but these days, he’s what we call a Trashy Divorces All-Star.\n\nWant early, ad-free episodes, limited series, Zoom hangouts, and more?
