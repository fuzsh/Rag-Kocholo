This stylish English actress joined the chorus line at the London Palladium at age 13, then toured with her sister Kim in a music-hall act. A sophisticated comedian, Kay Kendall played minor roles in film early in her career, before turning to stage repertory. Seventeen forgotten movies later, she burst forth with a showy role and a drunken trumpet solo in the engaging comedy Genevieve with Dinah Sheridan and Kenneth More; it was chosen as Best British Film of 1953.\n\nIn 1955, during the filming of the aptly titled The Constant Husband, Kendall met and fell in love with Rex Harrison, while his wife Lilli Palmer was in Munich making her first German film. This was not the first extramarital indulgence of Harrison's but certainly the most serious. When a doctor told Harrison that Kendall had leukemia and only three years to live, he divorced Palmer and married her. Kendall was not informed of the seriousness of her illness.\n\nIn her first U.S. picture in 1957, Kendall teamed up with Gene Kelly, Mitzi Gaynor and\n\nTaina Elg for MGM's Les Girls and was a rollicking success with both the critics and the public. She then played wife to husband Harrison in the film The Reluctant Debutante. Wrote Jay Nash and Stanley Ross: \"Let's all say a prayer for the immortal soul of Kay Kendall, who died a year after this film was released, and whose few performances captured on screen continue to be a delight for anyone who sees them.…It's Kendall's film from start to end as she is charming, loveable, bubbly, and funny in what was to be her penultimate motion picture. If there is such a thing as reincarnation, let Kendall come back soon.\" Kay Kendall's life was cut short by myeloid leukemia in 1959; she was 32.\n\nsources:"
