ACTION: Final rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or we) prescribes final late-season frameworks from which States may select season dates, limits, and other options for the 2004-05 migratory bird hunting seasons. These late seasons include most waterfowl seasons, the earliest of which commences on September 25, 2004. The effect of this final rule is to facilitate the States' selection of hunting seasons and to further the annual establishment of the late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. DATES: This rule takes effect on September 23, 2004. ADDRESSES: States should send their season selections to: Chief, Division of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, ms MBSP-4107-ARLSQ, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240. You may inspect comments during normal business hours at the Service's office in room 4107, 4501 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian Millsap, Chief, or Ron W. Kokel, Division of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, (703) 358-1714. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations Schedule for 2004 On March 22, 2004, we published in the Federal Register (69 FR 13440) a proposal to amend 50 CFR part 20. The proposal provided a background and overview of the migratory bird hunting regulations process, and dealt with the establishment of seasons, limits, the proposed regulatory alternatives for the 2004-05 duck hunting season, and other regulations for migratory game birds under Secs. 20.101 through 20.107, 20.109, and 20.110 of subpart K. On June 9, 2004, we published in the Federal Register (69 FR 32418) a second document providing supplemental proposals for early- and late-season migratory bird hunting regulations frameworks and the regulatory alternatives for the 2004-05 duck hunting season. The June 9 supplement also provided detailed information on the 2004-05 regulatory schedule and announced the Service Migratory Bird Regulations Committee (SRC) and Flyway Council meetings. On June 23 and 24, we held open meetings with the Flyway Council Consultants at which the participants reviewed information on the current status of migratory shore and upland game birds and developed recommendations for the 2004-05 regulations for these species plus regulations for migratory game birds in Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, special September waterfowl seasons in designated States, special sea duck seasons in the Atlantic Flyway, and extended falconry seasons. In addition, we reviewed and discussed preliminary information on the status of waterfowl as it relates to the development and selection of the regulatory packages for the 2004-05 regular waterfowl seasons. On July 21, we published in the Federal Register (69 FR 43694) a third document specifically dealing with the proposed frameworks for early-season regulations. In the August 30, 2004, Federal Register (69 FR 52970), we published final frameworks for early migratory bird hunting seasons from which wildlife conservation agency officials from the States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands selected 2003-04 early-season hunting dates, hours, areas, and limits. Subsequently, on September 1, 2004, we published a final rule in the Federal Register (69 FR 53564) amending subpart K of title 50 CFR part 20 to set hunting seasons, hours, areas, and limits for early seasons. On July 28-29, 2004, we held open meetings with the Flyway Council Consultants, at which the participants reviewed the status of waterfowl and developed recommendations for the 2004-05 regulations for these species. On August 24, 2004, we published in the Federal Register (69 FR 52128) the proposed frameworks for the 2004-05 late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. This document establishes final frameworks for late-season migratory bird hunting regulations for the 2004-05 season. We will publish State selections in the Federal Register as amendments to Secs. 20.101 through 20.107, and Sec. 20.109 of title 50 CFR part 20. Population Status and Harvest A brief summary of information on the status and harvest of waterfowl excerpted from various reports was included in the August 24 supplemental proposed rule. For more detailed information on methodologies and results, complete copies of the various reports are available at the address indicated under ADDRESSES or from our Web site at http://migratorybirds.fws.gov. Review of Public Comments and Flyway Council Recommendations The preliminary proposed rulemaking, which appeared in the March 22, 2004, Federal Register, opened the public comment period for migratory game bird hunting regulations. The supplemental proposed rule, which appeared in the June 9, 2004, Federal Register, discussed the regulatory alternatives for the 2003-04 duck hunting season. Late- season comments are summarized below and numbered in the order used in the March 22 Federal Register document. We have included only the numbered items pertaining to late-season issues for which we received written comments. Consequently, the issues do not follow in direct numerical or alphabetical order. We received recommendations from all four Flyway Councils. Some recommendations supported continuation of last year's frameworks. Due to the comprehensive nature of the annual review of the frameworks performed by the Councils, support for continuation of last year's frameworks is assumed for items for which no recommendations were received. Council recommendations for changes in the frameworks are summarized below. 1. Ducks Categories used to discuss issues related to duck harvest management are: (A) Harvest Strategy Considerations, (B) Regulatory Alternatives, (C) Zones and Split Seasons, and (D) Special Seasons/ Species Management. The categories correspond to previously published issues/discussion, and only those containing substantial recommendations are discussed below. A. Harvest Strategy Considerations Council Recommendations: The Atlantic, Central, and Pacific Flyway Councils and the Upper- and Lower-Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended the adoption of the ``liberal'' regulatory alternative, with the exception of some specific bag limits described below in section 1.D. Special Seasons/Species Management. More specifically, recommendations concerned sections iii. Black Ducks, iv. Canvasbacks, and v. Pintails. [[Page 57141]] Service Response: The Service is continuing development of an AHM protocol that would allow hunting regulations to vary among Flyways in a manner that recognizes each Flyway's unique breeding-ground derivation of mallards. For the 2004 hunting season, we believe that the prescribed regulatory choice for the Mississippi, Central, and Pacific Flyways should continue to depend on the status of midcontinent mallards and that the regulatory choice for the Atlantic Flyway should continue to depend on the status of eastern mallards. For the 2004 hunting season, the Service is continuing to utilize the same regulatory alternatives as those used last year. The nature of the restrictive, moderate, and liberal alternatives has remained essentially unchanged since 1997, except that extended framework dates have been offered in the moderate and liberal regulatory alternatives since 2002. Also, the Service agreed last year to place a constraint on closed seasons in the western three Flyways whenever the midcontinent mallard breeding-population size (traditional survey area plus Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin) is [ge]5.5 million. Optimal AHM strategies for the 2004 hunting season were calculated using: (1) Harvest-management objectives specific to each mallard stock; (2) the 2004 regulatory alternatives; and (3) current population models and associated weights for midcontinent and eastern mallards. Based on this year's survey results of 8.36 million midcontinent mallards (traditional surveys area plus Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin), 2.51 million ponds in Prairie Canada, and 1.11 million eastern mallards, the prescribed regulatory choice for all four Flyways is the liberal alternative. Therefore, we concur with the recommendations of the Atlantic, Mississippi, Central, and Pacific Flyways regarding selection of the ``liberal'' regulatory alternative and adopt the ``liberal'' regulatory alternative, as described in the June 9 Federal Register. D. Special Seasons/Species Management iii. Black Ducks Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended allowing States the opportunity to return to a 2-black-duck daily bag limit providing they close the black duck season one day for each day a 2-black-duck bag limit is employed. No offset would be required for days when the black duck bag limit was restricted to 1 bird. Both increased bag days and closed days must be consecutive, except that 1 split is allowed. Service Response: Last fall the Service began working with the Atlantic Flyway Council and others to develop assessment procedures that could be used to better inform black duck harvest management in the United States. These procedures were intended to help the Service assess the biological implications of any proposed changes to hunting regulations, as well as complement the ongoing effort to develop an international program for the adaptive management of black duck harvests. Based on one phase of this assessment framework, historical harvest rates of black ducks generally have been consistent with the dual management objectives of maximizing sustainable harvest and attaining the North American Waterfowl Management Plan population goal for black ducks. Since 1995, however, overall harvest rates of black ducks have been higher than what seems to be optimal for meeting these management objectives. Unfortunately, not all phases of the assessment work were completed this year, mainly predicting changes in black duck harvest rates associated with proposed changes in hunting regulations. Therefore, the Service believes that it is premature to adopt any proposed changes to black duck hunting regulations without first considering the appropriateness of departing from the traditional management objectives. Further, if regulatory changes are deemed appropriate, any proposal to do so should be accompanied by an assessment to predict what changes in harvest rates would result. Additional concerns relate to the reliability of the black duck breeding ground survey data and the lack of coordination with the Mississippi Flyway or other stakeholders. Thus, we do not support the Atlantic Flyway Council's proposal and encourage the Atlantic Flyway to complete the assessment work we requested last year. iv. Canvasbacks Council Recommendations: The Atlantic and Pacific Flyway Councils and the Upper- and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that the Service allow a ``restrictive'' canvasback season consisting of a 1-bird daily bag limit and a 30-day season in the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways and 60-day season in the Pacific Flyway. The Central Flyway Council recommended that canvasbacks be managed using the ``Hunter's Choice Bag Limit'' (described in the August 19, 2003, Federal Register (68 FR 50016)). However, until the ``Hunter's Choice Bag Limit'' becomes available, the Council recommends a 39-day season with a 1-bird daily bag limit, which may be split according to applicable zones/split duck hunting configurations approved for each State. Service Response: Based on regulatory actions in recent years and recommendations from the Flyway Councils, the canvasback harvest strategy was modified this year in the July 21 Federal Register to allow partial seasons within the regular duck season. The modification allows a canvasback season length equal to that of the ``restrictive'' AHM regulatory alternative if a full season is not supported, but the reduced harvest from the restricted season predicts a spring abundance the following year equal to or greater than the objective of 500,000 birds. Otherwise, the season on canvasbacks is closed. Further, based on a recommendation from the Pacific Flyway Council, Alaska has a 1- bird daily bag limit for the entire regular duck season in all years unless the Service determines that it is in the best interest of the canvasback resource to close the season in Alaska as well as the lower 48 States. This year's spring survey resulted in an estimate of 617,228 canvasbacks. However, the estimate of ponds in Prairie Canada was 2,512,608, which was 25% below average. The allowable harvest in the United States calculated from these numbers is 109,000, which is below the predicted U.S. harvest of 119,000 associated with the ``liberal'' duck season alternative. Thus, for 2004-05, a canvasback season the entire length of the regular season is not supported. However, the ``restrictive'' season length within the regular duck season is expected to result in a harvest of about 62,000 canvasbacks, and is supported. Thus, we will adopt a season length at the level of the ``restrictive'' AHM alternative (i.e., 30 days in the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways, 39 days in the Central Flyway, and 60 days in the Pacific Flyway) for this year. Seasons may be split according to applicable zones/split duck hunting configurations approved for each State. v. Pintails Council Recommendations: The Atlantic, Central, and Pacific Flyway Councils and the Upper- and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended a ``restrictive'' season for pintails consisting of a 1-bird daily bag limit and a 30-day season in the Atlantic [[Page 57142]] and Mississippi Flyways, a 39-day season in the Central Flyway, and a 60-day season in the Pacific Flyway. Service Response: For the past two years, partial seasons (``restrictive'' AHM alternative) have been used for pintails, which was a departure from the existing interim pintail harvest strategy. This year, the Service requested that the Flyway Councils review the existing strategy; specifically, the provision that provides for a full season with a 1-bird daily bag limit whenever the pintail population exceeds the closure threshold established in the strategy, regardless of projected population impacts. Discussions resulted in our July 21 decision to modify the existing strategy for 2004 as follows: Season closed when the breeding-population estimate (BPOP) is less than 1.5 million and the projected Fall Flight is less than 2.0 million. Partial season (restrictive alternative) when the BPOP or Fall Flight exceeds the closure level but the BPOP is less than 2.5 million and projections in the strategy predict a decline in the following year's BPOP (not including a 6% growth factor). Full season, minimum 1-bird daily bag limit when the BPOP exceeds 2.5 million, regardless of the following year's BPOP projection. All other existing provisions of the strategy continue to apply. Based on the modified strategy, a pintail breeding-population estimate of 2.18 million and a Fall-Flight projection of 2.64 million results in a projected 20 percent decline in next year's breeding population with a full season and 1-bird daily bag limit. Therefore, we are adopting a season length at the level of the ``restrictive'' AHM alternative (i.e., 30 days in the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways, 39 days in the Central Flyway, and 60 days in the Pacific Flyway) for this year. Seasons may be split according to applicable zones/split duck hunting configurations approved for each State. In addition, we recommend that further review of the strategy be cooperatively undertaken during the coming year prior to finalizing a pintail strategy to be used until a full incorporation of pintails into the formal AHM process is achieved. 4. Canada Geese B. Regular Seasons The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended that the Atlantic Population (AP) Canada goose season consist of a 45-day season with a daily bag limit of 3 geese in the New England and Mid-Atlantic Regions with a framework opening date of the fourth Saturday in October and a closing date of January 31. In the Chesapeake Region (except Back Bay, Virginia), the Council recommended a season length of 45 days, with a daily bag limit of 1 goose during the first 25 days and 2 geese during the last 20 days of the season. The framework opening date in the Chesapeake Region would be November 15 and the closing date would be January 31. The Council recommended that remaining AP harvest areas (i.e, Northeast Hunt Unit in coastal North Carolina and Back Bay, Virginia) remain closed. The Upper- and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended a number of changes in season length, season dates, bag limits, and quotas for Minnesota, Iowa, and Missouri in response to changes in the status of the Eastern Prairie Canada goose population and in Kentucky, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Illinois in response to changes in the status of the Mississippi Valley Population Canada goose population. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended increasing the season length in Humboldt and Del Norte Counties in California from 16 days to 100 days and increasing the daily bag limit for small Canada geese from 1 to 2 per day. Service Response: We concur with all the Council recommendations. Further, last year we encouraged the Atlantic Flyway to specify population objectives for AP geese and provide a strategy to guide future harvest management. We appreciate the Flyway's effort during this past year to provide this information. C. Special Late Season Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended that Connecticut's special late Canada goose season become operational. Service Response: We concur. 5. White-Fronted Geese Council Recommendations: The Pacific Flyway Council recommended increasing the season length in the Balance-of-the-State Zone in California from 86 days to 100 days and increasing the daily bag limit for white-fronted geese from 2 to 3 per day except in the Sacramento Valley Special Management Area (west). Service Response: We concur. 6. Brant Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended a 50-day season with a 2-bird daily bag limit for Atlantic brant in 2004. Service Response: We concur. NEPA Consideration NEPA considerations are covered by the programmatic document, ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES 88- 14),'' filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on June 9, 1988. We published a Notice of Availability in the Federal Register on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582). We published our Record of Decision on August 18, 1988 (53 FR 31341). In a proposed rule published in the April 30, 2001, Federal Register (66 FR 21298), we expressed our intent to begin the process of developing a new Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the migratory bird hunting program. We plan to begin the public scoping process in 2005. Endangered Species Act Consideration Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543; 87 Stat. 884), provides that, ``The Secretary shall review other programs administered by him and utilize such programs in furtherance of the purposes of this Act'' (and) shall ``insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out * * * is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of [critical] habitat. * * *'' Consequently, we conducted formal consultations to ensure that actions resulting from these regulations would not likely jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitat. Findings from these consultations are included in a biological opinion, which concluded that the regulations are not likely to adversely affect any endangered or threatened species. Additionally, these findings may have caused modification of some regulatory measures previously proposed, and the final frameworks reflect any such modifications. Our biological opinions resulting from this Section 7 consultation are public documents available for public inspection at the address indicated under ADDRESSES. Executive Order 12866 The migratory bird hunting regulations are economically significant and were reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under [[Page 57143]] Executive Order 12866. As such, a cost/benefit analysis was initially prepared in 1981. This analysis was subsequently revised annually from 1990 to 1996, and then updated in 1998. We have updated again this year. It is further discussed below under the heading Regulatory Flexibility Act. Results from the 2004 analysis indicate that the expected welfare benefit of the annual migratory bird hunting frameworks is on the order of $734 million to $1.064 billion, with a midpoint estimate of $899 million. Copies of the cost/benefit analysis are available upon request from the address indicated under ADDRESSES or from our Web site at http://www.migratorybirds.gov. Regulatory Flexibility Act These regulations have a significant economic impact on substantial numbers of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). We analyzed the economic impacts of the annual hunting regulations on small business entities in detail as part of the 1981 cost-benefit analysis discussed under Executive Order 12866. This analysis was revised annually from 1990 through 1995. In 1995, the Service issued a Small Entity Flexibility Analysis (Analysis), which was subsequently updated in 1996, 1998, and 2004. The primary source of information about hunter expenditures for migratory game bird hunting is the National Hunting and Fishing Survey, which is conducted at 5- year intervals. The 2004 Analysis was based on the 2001 National Hunting and Fishing Survey and the U.S. Department of Commerce's County Business Patterns, from which it was estimated that migratory bird hunters would spend between $481 million and $1.2 billion at small businesses in 2004. Copies of the Analysis are available upon request from the address indicated under ADDRESSES or from our Web site at http://www.migratorybirds.gov. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act This rule is a major rule under 5 U.S.C. 804(2), the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. For the reasons outlined above, this rule has an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. However, because this rule establishes hunting seasons, we do not plan to defer the effective date required by 5 U.S.C. 801 under the exemption contained in 5 U.S.C. 808 (1). Paperwork Reduction Act We examined these regulations under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. The various recordkeeping and reporting requirements imposed under regulations established in 50 CFR part 20, subpart K, are utilized in the formulation of migratory game bird hunting regulations. Specifically, OMB has approved the information collection requirements of the Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program and assigned clearance number 1018-0015 (expires 10/31/2004). This information is used to provide a sampling frame for voluntary national surveys to improve our harvest estimates for all migratory game birds in order to better manage these populations. A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act We have determined and certify, in compliance with the requirements of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, 2 U.S.C. 1502 et seq., that this rulemaking will not impose a cost of $100 million or more in any given year on local or State government or private entities. Therefore, this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Civil Justice Reform-Executive Order 12988 The Department, in promulgating this rule, has determined that it will not unduly burden the judicial system and that it meets the requirements of sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988. Takings Implication Assessment In accordance with Executive Order 12630, this rule, authorized by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, does not have significant takings implications and does not affect any constitutionally protected property rights. This rule will not result in the physical occupancy of property, the physical invasion of property, or the regulatory taking of any property. In fact, these rules allow hunters to exercise otherwise unavailable privileges and, therefore, reduce restrictions on the use of private and public property. Energy Effects--Executive Order 13211 On May 18, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13211 on regulations that significantly affect energy supply, distribution, and use. Executive Order 13211 requires agencies to prepare Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking certain actions. While this rule is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, it is not expected to adversely affect energy supplies, distribution, or use. Therefore, this action is not a significant energy action and no Statement of Energy Effects is required. Federalism Effects Due to the migratory nature of certain species of birds, the Federal Government has been given responsibility over these species by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We annually prescribe frameworks from which the States make selections regarding the hunting of migratory birds, and we employ guidelines to establish special regulations on Federal Indian reservations and ceded lands. This process preserves the ability of the States and tribes to determine which seasons meet their individual needs. Any State or tribe may be more restrictive than the Federal frameworks at any time. The frameworks are developed in a cooperative process with the States and the Flyway Councils. This process allows States to participate in the development of frameworks from which they will make selections, thereby having an influence on their own regulations. These rules do not have a substantial direct effect on fiscal capacity, change the roles or responsibilities of Federal or State governments, or intrude on State policy or administration. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 13132, these regulations do not have significant federalism effects and do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Regulations Promulgation The rulemaking process for migratory game bird hunting must, by its nature, operate under severe time constraints. However, we intend that the public be given the greatest possible opportunity to comment. Thus, when the preliminary proposed rulemaking was published, we established what we believed were the longest periods possible for public comment. In doing this, we recognized that when the comment period closed, time would be of the essence. That is, if there were a delay in the effective date of these regulations after this final rulemaking, States would have insufficient time to select season dates and limits; to communicate those selections to us; and to establish and publicize the necessary regulations and procedures to implement their decisions. We therefore find that ``good cause'' exists, within the terms of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, and these frameworks will, therefore, take effect immediately upon publication. [[Page 57144]] Therefore, under authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (July 3, 1918), as amended (16 U.S.C. 703-711), we prescribe final frameworks setting forth the species to be hunted, the daily bag and possession limits, the shooting hours, the season lengths, the earliest opening and latest closing season dates, and hunting areas, from which State conservation agency officials will select hunting season dates and other options. Upon receipt of season and option selections from these officials, we will publish in the Federal Register a final rulemaking amending 50 CFR part 20 to reflect seasons, limits, and shooting hours for the conterminous United States for the 2004-05 season. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 20 Exports, Hunting, Imports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation, Wildlife. The rules that eventually will be promulgated for the 2004-05 hunting season are authorized under 16 U.S.C. 703-712 and 16 U.S.C. 742 a-j. Dated: September 9, 2004. Craig Manson, Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. Final Regulations Frameworks for 2004-05 Late Hunting Seasons on Certain Migratory Game Birds Pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and delegated authorities, the Department has approved the following frameworks for season lengths, shooting hours, bag and possession limits, and outside dates within which States may select seasons for hunting waterfowl and coots between the dates of September 1, 2004, and March 10, 2005. General Dates: All outside dates noted below are inclusive. Shooting and Hawking (taking by falconry) Hours: Unless otherwise specified, from one-half hour before sunrise to sunset daily. Possession Limits: Unless otherwise specified, possession limits are twice the daily bag limit. Flyways and Management Units Waterfowl Flyways: Atlantic Flyway--includes Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia. Mississippi Flyway--includes Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. Central Flyway--includes Colorado (east of the Continental Divide), Kansas, Montana (Counties of Blaine, Carbon, Fergus, Judith Basin, Stillwater, Sweetgrass, Wheatland, and all counties east thereof), Nebraska, New Mexico (east of the Continental Divide except the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation), North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming (east of the Continental Divide). Pacific Flyway--includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and those portions of Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, and Wyoming not included in the Central Flyway. Management Units: High Plains Mallard Management Unit--roughly defined as that portion of the Central Flyway that lies west of the 100th meridian. Definitions: For the purpose of hunting regulations listed below, the collective terms ``dark'' and ``light'' geese include the following species: Dark geese: Canada geese, white-fronted geese, brant, and all other goose species except light geese. Light geese: snow (including blue) geese and Ross' geese. Area, Zone, and Unit Descriptions: Geographic descriptions related to late-season regulations are contained in a later portion of this document. Area-Specific Provisions: Frameworks for open seasons, season lengths, bag and possession limits, and other special provisions are listed below by Flyway. Compensatory Days in the Atlantic Flyway: In the Atlantic Flyway States of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, where Sunday hunting is prohibited statewide by State law, all Sundays are closed to all take of migratory waterfowl (including mergansers and coots). Atlantic Flyway Ducks, Mergansers, and Coots Outside Dates: Between the Saturday nearest September 24 (September 25) and the last Sunday in January (January 30). Hunting Seasons and Duck Limits: 60 days, except pintails and canvasbacks which may not exceed 30 days, and season splits must conform to each State's zone/split configuration for duck hunting. The daily bag limit is 6 ducks, including no more than 4 mallards (2 hens), 3 scaup, 1 black duck, 1 pintail, 1 canvasback, 1 mottled duck, 1 fulvous whistling duck, 2 wood ducks, 2 redheads, and 4 scoters. A single pintail and canvasback may also be included in the 6-bird daily bag limit for designated youth-hunt days. Closures: The season on harlequin ducks is closed. Sea Ducks: Within the special sea duck areas, during the regular duck season in the Atlantic Flyway, States may choose to allow the above sea duck limits in addition to the limits applying to other ducks during the regular duck season. In all other areas, sea ducks may be taken only during the regular open season for ducks and are part of the regular duck season daily bag (not to exceed 4 scoters) and possession limits. Merganser Limits: The daily bag limit of mergansers is 5, only 1 of which may be a hooded merganser. Coot Limits: The daily bag limit is 15 coots.
