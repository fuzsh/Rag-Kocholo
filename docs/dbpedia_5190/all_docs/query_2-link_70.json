Dave was a great host, and responded quickly to any questions. The house is located on a low-traffic residential street in a Adirondack wooded setting (nice for walks). It's obvious that the house and property are well maintained - kitchen, laundry, and bedrooms were clean and have lots of sunlight. There is a gradual sand-access area to the beautiful lake, and a nice dock where we moored our small boat. We've stayed at several properties on Brant Lake, and Horicon 18 is a winner.”\n\nOwner's Response\n\n“Glad you all had a good time! Some coolish nights, but a lovely and quiet June week!”\n\nDate of Stay: August 2011\n\nPosted On: 3/1/12 by Cathi T.\n\n“Our family has had the good fortune to have rented \"18\" for a week each summer for the past 25+ years. Our boys (now grown men) have wonderful memories of their vacations there. The cabin is located in one of the best sections of beautiful Brant Lake - secluded from the main road so no worries with young children. And privacy from your neighbors. It is definitely a \"little piece of heaven\".”\n\nPrint Reviews\n\n*Reviews and owner responses are the subjective opinions of the reviewers and owners.
