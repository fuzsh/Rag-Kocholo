        "text": "The search continued Wednesday for an elderly Troy man who was last seen during an Adirondack hunting trip on Sunday. Time Warner Cable News' Matt Hunter talked with forest rangers and members of the hunting party who are hopeful he'll be found soon.\n\nHORICON, N.Y. â Three days following their Sunday morning hunting trip, Gerry Gendron was back in the woods surrounding Warren County's Lily Pond on Wednesday, joining the search for his friend, Tom Messick.\n\n\"It's already been too long. We need to get him out,\" said Gendron, who belongs to the same hunting and fishing club as Messick. \"We have known him forever. He is a great guy and we just want to get him back.\"\n\nJoined by numerous agencies and at least 50 volunteers, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Forest Rangers are leading the search for the missing and partially blind 82-year-old Troy man who's hunted the woods in this section of the Adirondacks near Brant LakeÂ for decades.\n\n\"It's a typical Adirondack landscape,\" said DEC Forest Ranger Rick Schroeder, the incident commanderÂ of the search for Messick. \"Monday night and Tuesday night were well below freezing and down into the 20s. Without any kind of fire or anything of that sort, it could be challenging.\"\n\nIn what's commonly referred to as a \"drive\" maneuver, Gendron says Messick and another older man from the hunting party were left behind at a post while the younger members walk through the woods toward them, hoping to push the deer in that direction.Â\n\n\"We tried to do a small, simple push to try and keep those guys safe, and something went wrong with the communication,\" Gendron said.\n\n\"Tom and his friend, his hunting companion, started moving and once they separated, that was the last time Tom was seen by his hunting friend,\" Schroeder said.\n\nSeveral areas in the search grid have already been completed. Despite having neither time or ideal conditions on their side, search members have no intention of stopping.\n\n\"We are confident we can have a positive resolution,â Schroeder said. \"We always look. That is the only way we think about this.\"\n\n\"We just want to bring him home,â Gendron said. \"If anybody can help, we would appreciate it.\""
