        "text": "An injunction is a court order requiring an individual or entity to either perform or stop performing a specific action. In states where a complete injunction has been implemented, the Department of Education will not be able to enforce the 2024 regulations. Those states will not be required to comply with the 2024 Title IX Regulations if the injunction is still in place on August 1, 2024.\n\nStates: AL, AR, FL, GA, IA, ID, IN, KY, LA, MO, MS, MT, NE, ND, OH, OK, SD, SC, TN, TX, VA, WV, AK*, KS*, UT*, WY*\n\n*The 7/2/24 preliminary injunction ordered will also apply to enforcement in various schools attended by members of the plaintiff organizations. The complete list will be determined by the Court, by 7/15/24, but if your school is attended by any member of Young America's Foundation or Female Athletes United, or attended by the minor child of a member of Moms for Liberty, the injunction likely applies to your school as well, for now.\n\nVarious states, along with organizations and private individuals, have filed lawsuits challenging the legality of the 2024 Regulations. Most of these lawsuits have requested a preliminary injunction. These states are those where the lawsuit is still pending and the judge has not yet reached a decision regarding the preliminary injunction (or the merits of the case).\n\nAs of 7/31/24, all states challenging the 2024 Title IX have been granted temporary or preliminary injunctions. The litigation remains pending in those 26 states.\n\nUnderstanding the 2020 regulatory compliance requirements is crucial for all Title IX practitioners. Due to the non-retroactive nature of the 2024 Regulations, ATIXA will continue to offer training and resources specific to the 2020 Regulations. You can access 2020-compliant trainings, 2024-compliant trainings, or both, as needed. ATIXA is committed to supporting you through these evolving times, regardless of which regulatory framework (2020 or 2024) applies. We especially encourage those new to the Title IX field or transitioning roles, especially in states with injunctions against enforcement of the 2024 Regulations, to enroll in a 2020 course now. A refresher is highly recommended if it’s been over a year since your last ATIXA training. Additionally, frequent turnover in the field often leads to gaps in staffing the Title IX Coordinator role. If your institution’s Coordinator role has had a recent lapse in coverage, sending a team member to a 2020 Regulations course will ensure compliance with the appropriate framework for incidents occurring within the 2020-2024 timeframe.\n\nFor those in states affected by the injunctions, it’s important to note that any plans to move away from live hearings or to a model where your Investigator or Coordinator is also your Decision-maker may be disrupted. This change may not happen in the short term or at all.\n\nPlease consult your legal counsel. ATIXA’s position is that Title IX has long protected sexual orientation and gender identity to the extent that such forms of discrimination typically rely on sex stereotypes or characteristics. In that sense, the 2024 Regulations were not so much an expansion of Title IX as a clarification of its scope. However, this interpretation may continue to conflict with some state laws, so you must engage your attorneys regarding the implications, risks, and go-forward plans. Complying with state law could still get you sued under Title IX whether or not the 2024 Regulations go into effect. If you cannot prepare to comply with the 2024 Regulations in advance, you still may benefit from having a plan for implementing training, policies, and procedures as quickly as possible if you need to do so. Stay informed and prepared by viewing ATIXA’s 2024 Title IX Regulations Injunction Tracker.\n\nThe existing need for Resolution Support Services (RSS) remains. Live hearings and separate investigations are still required under the 2020 Regulations. Many institutions may benefit from hiring external consultants like TNG Consulting (ATIXA’s parent company). We have a deep bench of expert consultants and partners to manage live hearings, investigations, and decision-making for you.\n\nIf your existing need requires more comprehensive complaint resolution, TNG offers The FAIR Center—a wraparound solution to support institutions with case management, investigations, resolutions (formal and informal), and comprehensive interim staffing for all your office and team needs. With TNG’s expertise, you can be confident that your complaint resolution process will exemplify professionalism and fairness. The uncertainty in the field will prompt schools and institutions to consider both RSS and The FAIR Center when making staffing decisions.\n\nContact Us Today"
