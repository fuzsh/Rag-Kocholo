        "text": "Plattsburgh, NY – Assemblymember Jon D. Rivera (District 149) of Buffalo recently visited the Adirondacks, where he explored the area’s recreational opportunities and potential for sustainable environmental tourism.\n\n“The Adirondack region is a natural gem of our state’s unparalleled environmental beauty. My tour reinforced the critical role that tourism plays in the economic vitality of upstate New York. It is essential that we continue to support and promote sustainable tourism practices to preserve these stunning landscapes for future generations and ensure that they too have access to this wealth of recreational opportunities,” Rivera said.\n\nThe trip is Rivera’s latest in a series of tourism-centric travels intended to shed light on the state’s growing tourism sector and its potential to stimulate economic growth, create quality job opportunities and contribute to maintaining vibrant communities. During the visit, Rivera met with regional leaders and hosted various meetings and activities to discuss environmental assets, the economic vitality of the region and tourism challenges post-pandemic. » Continue Reading.\n\nOne of my Saranac Lake brothers, Dermott Morgan, aka GIN MATTERS, just wrote a book.\n\nHe had a book signing earlier this month in Lake Placid, where I picked up a copy and we spent some time chatting about his new book and book writing journey.\n\nWith his approval and blessing, I wanted to share my review.\n\nFor a brief introduction to GIN MATTERS & his HUNTING CAMP world, click the link & read on.\n\nWell, another interesting event popped up on Facebook, so I messaged my friend and she said “I’m in!” So, we signed up for a session in the Hive House at BowTerra Farm. We met in Canajoharie and took a short ride just outside of Palatine Bridge (if you’re looking for\n\nsomething to do on a nice day, this trip is worth it if just for the scenic Mohawk Valley views). The owner, Brad Bowers, met us in the driveway with a container of freshly picked gooseberries and said “these are for you.” Wow–what a welcome! I had never seen nor eaten gooseberries. (The farm’s Facebook page provides suggestions as to how to use them.)\n\n» Continue Reading.\n\nTo pay attention, this our endless and proper work.\n\n— Mary Oliver\n\nOn July 26, 1926, newsman Albert Evans arrived at his office in the old Harrietstown Town Hall, on the daily beat for the Adirondack Daily Enterprise. He had no way of knowing his place of work would soon be reduced to ashes.\n\nLate that night, the bell in the old clock tower — which long had served as the fire alarm for the village — tragically sounded its own demise. Albert Evans stood on the sidewalk, watching as fire climbed the wood frame building. There was a sudden crack. Down came the clock hand, and he reached out and caught it.\n\n» Continue Reading.\n\nThe Adirondack Park is more popular with tourists than ever before.\n\nIt’s mountain vistas, clear lakes and pristine wilderness is something to be coveted and protected at all cost for future generations.\n\nUnless you are a Supreme Court justice.\n\nBy a 5-4 vote on Thursday, June 27, the Supreme Court blocked the requirement that factories and power plants in the Midwest cut air pollution that drifts into the Eastern states because it believes that agencies such as the EPA don’t have that type of authority.\n\nThis is the agency that has cleaned up pollution significantly in our country over the past 50 years.\n\nTen years ago, the Environmental Protection Agency implemented standards to stop other states from ruining our environment here in New York. The problem dated back to the 1970s when the emissions from coal-burning power plants in the Midwest contaminated Adirondack lakes.\n\nBy 1990, federal research showed that more than 700 Adirondack lakes and ponds – about 25 percent of the total – were too acidic to support native life. Spruce and fir forests in the high elevations were dying.\n\nThe Adirondack Park was in crisis.\n\n» Continue Reading.\n\nA common myth is that tornadoes don’t happen in mountains. While it is indeed less likely due to the high elevations which have cooler/more stable air, it is still possible. And when it does happen, it’s more intense as tornadoes grow in strength with elevation. So in the off chance of it happening, it’s important to know what to do. The key is to look for caves/rock shelter and get as far away from the opening as possible, then lie flat and cover the back of your head with an object or your arms. Even a simple overhang reduces your exposure to debris (and flying debris can be the most dangerous part of a tornado—not the wind itself!). Typically with tornadoes, you should avoid areas with many trees, but this can be impossible on a mountain. So seeking shelter in a cave or under an overhang is the best bet to protect yourself.\n\nTornado severity is rated on an “EF scale” from 0 (weakest) to 5 (strongest). Even EF-0 tornadoes, like the one that struck Warren County this month, can have winds exceeding 80 mph, enough to knock down trees and utility poles.\n\nSigns of a tornado approaching (info from Safety Guidelines: During a Tornado | Tornadoes | CDC):\n\nRotating funnel-shaped cloud.\n\nApproaching cloud of debris.\n\nDark or green-colored sky.\n\nLarge, dark, low-lying cloud.\n\nLarge hail.\n\nLoud roar that sounds like a freight train.\n\nIf you are outdoors, a tornado is approaching, and there is no proper shelter (avoid cars/small buildings like mobile homes, which are sometimes more dangerous than being outside), go to a low-lying area such as a ditch or ravine, and again, lie flat and cover the back of your head. Avoid open fields.\n\nPhoto at top: Tornado damage in Rome. NYS DEC photo.\n\nI hope you survived the series of strong storms, and even tornados, that crossed the state last week. Fifteen tornados were recorded across the state. which was more than five Midwestern states had during that same period. For those climate change deniers who were hit by these storms, it probably will not change your views. How many 100-year storms would it take to change your mind since we’ve had several already this year all across the country? Not one mention of this in Trump’s acceptance speech to run for the Republican party’s nominee for the office of President of the United States. Each one of these storms has changed the nature of the landscape, the lives of the people living there and the wildlife and their habitat that would also be affected if they lived through it.\n\n» Continue Reading.\n\nHousing organization building four new homes on Both Meadow Trail\n\nAdirondack Roots will build four new, single-family homes in Keene aimed at moderate-income families, and is accepting applications from potential homeowners. Homes in the Both Meadow Trail development will cost about $160,000 each and be reserved for families that meet income qualifications based on family size: Someone in a single-person household, for example, would qualify if they earned up to $72,480, while total income for a six-person household could go as high as $120,120.\n\n“Our housing shortage means that families and individuals who could have afforded homes 10 years ago now find themselves priced out of the market,” said Megan Murphy, the executive director of Adirondack Roots, a non-profit housing organization based in Elizabethtown. “The Both Meadow Trail project is aimed squarely at people who may already be living in and contributing to our communities, such as renters or those looking to age in place, but have not been able to find the right opportunity.”\n\n» Continue Reading."
