        "text": "Also goes by Dodge County Ledge Park. Not a place for small kids. Wear good,sturdy shoes. The main attraction to this park are the trails that take you around and through the rocky outcroppings which are the same type of formations that the Dells is known for. This park can be divided into 3 sections: The lower ledge; the main section and the upper ledge. The main trail map) runs the edge where the overlook is and winds around wooded camp area. From this main trail you have access to both lower and upper sections; the difference being the sloped trail to the lower ledge area is quite steep; dangerously steep in some areas.\n\nGeologically it is the Niagara Escarpment that literally forms the backbone in Wisconsin starting from the Campbellsport – Dundee area north through the thumb of Door County, arching gracefully north to Upper Michigan curving the southwestern edge of Canada’s Georgian Bay and plunges south to Port Dover where is heads east and travels all the way to New York.\n\nThe trails at Horicon Ledge are moderate to difficult; assuming good weather conditions and being aware of your surroundings. Meaning you simply cannot hike the path while staring at your phone.\n\nOne of the best features of Horicon Ledge are the public day camping spots; I believe there are 3 of them (not including unreserved shelters); two of those sites have fire rings.\n\nI can’t guarantee there will be picnic benches so bring your folding chairs as a precaution.\n\nHoricon Ledge County Park also has RV/Tent camping rentals that is monitored by the on site Park Ranger who lives at the registration office where firewood can also be purchased (both camp registration and firewood purchases are self-managed). At the stop sign you will see a small parking area where you can pick up the trail. Continuing ahead (north); to your left is the first area of day camp sites; the road will curve right to the pass good/proper bathroom, shower areas and a small lending library. Up the hill you are entering the upper Ledge section; a nice playground area next to a picnic shelter and you are entering the main camp area Like any proper camp, you find road becomes a one way that will loop back to near the main rest area and day camp There are other day camp areas (picnic areas on map), but no where as nice and centralized\n\nFIREWOOD BAN NOTICE: From June 1st – September 30th, Dodge County is under the Emerald Ash Borer Quarantine. It is illegal to transport firewood from Dodge County into an unquarantined County. Personally I have brought in firewood (from Kwik Trip) that has a certified sticker and that was allowed, though the Ranger told me personally they prefer visitors to buying the wood onsite.\n\nOther Horicon related activities, here is the link for the Horicon Chamber of Commerce, showing Marsh Boat Tours/Canoe Rentals, their Aquatic Center, The HORICON WILDLIFE REFUGE, and the Horicon Marsh Education and Visitor Center.\n\nDodge County does offer some great parks that also has public firepits. In fact, Dodge County has one of the best managed county park systems.\n\nWhere to find: Off of Highway 33 to Cty Rd TW North Travel time is a 1/2 hour east from Beaver Dam or west from West Bend. N7403 Park Road, Horicon, WI 53032. Phone: 920-386-3700. The entrance road will fork; head straight to the lower section, or turn right which will take you to where the Ranger station is located for camp site registration and also where the firewood can be purchased.\n\nWhat to expect: Cliffs, ledges, mossy crags,slippery hills and rocks. This park is a popular campground, but one of the bennies to this park are the public picnic areas on the upper level that has its own firepit, one large, and 2-3 smaller sites and split wood for sale. NOTE FIREWOOD BAN NOTICE. This park is gated, ranger controlled and visitors not camping have to leave at closing (7pm?). I recommend calling first. LETTERBOXING LOCATION"
