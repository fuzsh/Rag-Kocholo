Huston took a handoff and headed off to what looked like an end run. With the defenders converging on him, the fast end pulled up short and tossed a 38-yard pass to Harry Jacunski all alone in the end zone. After the play, the poker-faced Huston broke into a grin. Passing, it seemed, was not that difficult. Most of the Green Bay passes were thrown by Tony Canadeo and Irv Comp, since star tailback Cecil Isbell had quit to coach the Purdue Boilermakers. Isbell explained why he quit while still young - \"I had not been up in Green Bay long when I saw Lambeau around the locker room and tell players like Herber and Gantenbein and Hank Bruder that they were all done with the Packers. I sat there and watched and then I vowed it would never happen to me. I'd quit before they came around to tell me.\"\n\n​\n\nTHE STEAGLES\n\nLooking ahead to the 1943 season, the second one since the U.S. entered World War II, the National Football League faced a major problem. Like baseball, most of the players had been drafted by the armed forces. Unlike baseball, the NFL did not have a vast minor league system to draw on. The league had limped through the 1942 season with about 1/3 of its players in the service. Attendance had plummeted 20%. At its annual meeting in April, 1943, the NFL took stock. 150 more players had been lost to the armed forces. Most teams were decimated. The Pittsburgh Steelers had only 6 players under contract. The Philadelphia Eagles had 16, more than most clubs. The Cleveland Rams received permission to drop out of the league for the 1943 season. The good news from this move was that the Rams' 14 players could be disbused among the nine remaining clubs. The bad news was that an odd number of teams created a scheduling problem. The 1943 draft was mostly a waste of time as almost all the college draftees were already military draftees. Some players were coaxed out of retirement, led by the legendary Bronko Nagurski, who joined to the Bears at age 35 after 5 idle years. However, the Steelers still faced dire straits and might have to shut down as Cleveland had one. The Pittsburgh problem and the scheduling dilemma were solved by merging the Steelers with their cross-state rivals, the Eagles, for the 1943 season. The team would play four of its home games at Shibe Park in Philadelphia and two in Pittsburgh. Earl \"Greasy\" Neale of the Eagles and the Steelers' Walt Kiesling would be co-coaches. (This arrangement worked only after Neale took over the offense and Kiesling the defense.) The uniforms were the green and white of the Eagles. League standings would list the club as Phil-Pitt. However, sportswriters and fans preferred \"Steagles.\" (SOURCE: Golden Moments in Sports Archives)\n\nNAME NO POS HGT WGT COLLEGE YR PR A G HOW ACQUIRED\n\nChet Adams 27 T 6- 3 240 Ohio State 1 5 26 10 FA-Cleve (1942)\n\nPaul Berezney 47 T 6- 2 220 Fordham 2 2 27 10\n\nCharley Brock 29 C 6- 1 210 Nebraska 5 5 27 6 1939 Draft-3rd\n\nLou Brock 16 HB 6- 0 195 Purdue 4 4 25 10 1940 Draft-3rd\n\nTony Canadeo 3 HB 6- 0 195 Gonzaga 3 3 24 10 1941 Draft-7th\n\nIrv Comp 51 HB 6- 3 192 St. Benedict 1 1 24 9 1943 Draft-3rd\n\nLarry Craig 54 E 6- 0 208 S.

At least, the little Mr. Nineteen Forty-Three that arrived in Green Bay did. The point is that the little guy, who replaced the battered Nineteen Forty-Two, ushered in the Green Bay Packers' 25th year in professional football - the sliver jubilee of the pay sport in this city. Of course, the war and its recruits may have something to do with Green Bay celebrating its 25th football birthday, but regardless the Packers still will be in their 25th year. They'll still hold a franchise, even though world events could force them from action. Coach Curly Lambeau launched pro football in Green Bay back in 1919, and, after two years of freelance ball, entered the NFL. The Packers remain as one of the three teams in the circuit since it was started, the other two being the Bears and Cardinals of Chicago. In the Bears' first year, they were known as the Staleys...COVERS FOUR DECADES: Lambeau's career in pro football - and the Packers (both the same) - represent four decades - 1910, 1920, 1930 and 1940. He covered the \"roaring twenties\" with one championship, and skipped over the \"depression thirties\" with four titles. The \"warring forties\" are still without a championship, but remember that Lambeau opened this decade with three seconds in the Western division...FIRST TIME EVER: When Hal Van Every cavorted for the Second Air Force Bombers against Hardin-Simmons in the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, New Year's day, it was the first time a former Packer ever played in a bowl game after he saw action with Green Bay. Generally, the Packer stars get into a bowl before they come here, but Van Every is an exception - made possible by the war. He scored the winning touchdown by the way...'I LIKE TO SCORE': Tackle Al Klug of Marquette suggested something the other day that pro coaches ought to try. Klug, who likes to score, asked his coach, Tom Stidham, to figure out some sort of a tackle-around play so \"I can score\". The rules forbid a tackle from carrying the ball from his position but he could always switch to end. Can you imagine Baby Ray, Ernie Pannell, Bill Lee or Paul Berezney \"flashing\" on tackle-around plays?...THIS AND THAT: Advertisers spent approximately $100,000 in getting up the souvenir program for the NFL's \"pro bowl\" game in Philadelphia Dec. 27. Before the Bear-Washington title test, veteran George Musso gave the Bruins a pep talk. Tony Canadeo, Packer halfback, left Green Bay this week for his home in Chicago. He'll go into the Navy Air corps sometime in March. Packer fullback Ted Fritsch has been placed in 4-F by his Stevens Point draft board. Coach Curly Lambeau was ready in case a draft session was held at the recent league meeting. He had complete reports from his numerous scouts on nearly every outstanding player in the country.\n\nPACKER NOTES\n\nJAN 6 (Wisconsin Rapids) - Ted Fritsch, former Central State Teachers college athlete, and more recently a fullback on the Green Bay Packers, probably has played in his last professional football game for the duration. Fritsch, whose high school days were spent at the little school at Spencer, where his brother Mike does the coaching, left last week with the draft contingent of Portage county for physical examinations in Milwaukee. Since the conclusion of the Green Bay Packer schedule, Ted has been employed as a substitute mail carrier at the post office in Stevens Point. He registered in that city while attending college there. Fritsch was Eddie Kotal's personal contribution to the Green Bay Packer club. When the Packer organization hired Eddie as backfield coach late last spring, it has no idea that Kotal would also bring the 1942 Packer fullback. But Fritsch, who is built like a bull and yet is extremely light on his feet, more than filled the bill for Curly Lambeau. Naturally Ted wasn't a Clark Hinkle in his first season of professional football. As a matter of fact, try and name anyone who has been the equal of the Hink. Possibly Bronko Nagurski and Ernie Never, but who else? Norm Standlee was a great line plunger for the Bears, but who wouldn't be with that Bear line to open the holes? For a rookie Fritsch did a splendid job. His field goal kicking contributed to the Packer scoring and he saved the Green Bay team from certain defeat in New York by breaking away for a long run in the closing minutes of the game against the Giants to enable the Packers to escape with a 21-21 tie. Another example of a small town boy who made good in a big way.\n\nPACKER FANS OF BROOKLYN, N.Y., HELPS LAMBEAU FIND GRID TALENT\n\nJAN 8 (Green Bay) - If football is still active next fall, Brooklyn is determined that the Green Bay Packers win the National league championship. 'Tis a rare statement, indeed, and Coach Curly Lambeau nearly swooned when he read it in a letter from a representative of the Brooklyn Chapter, Green Bay Packer Fans. The missive was signed: \"Chapter President\". The letter listed a raft of outstanding college players, after pointing out that \"please do not deem this as an insult to your coaching proficiency as we are aware that you have scouts for the very work we undertook but we have so thoroughly covered the football picture this year we cannot see how anyone could surpass us on the subject.\" It might be explained that the Packers have paid scouts throughout the country keeping their eyes open for possible pro talent. In addition, there are many other personal friends of Lambeau who are on the watch for material. But this letter is something new, said Lambeau...CONCLUDED TEAM'S NEEDS: The letter points out that \"we have covered every Packer game very closely, and most of the college contests. Therefore we consider ourselves in a position to accurately approximate the Packer status, in reference to the coming season. Our society has concluded the team's needs and has listed the college players most likely to succeed in the pro ranks.\" The chapter explains that it realizes that it is \"pretty much impossible to corner these stars, due to the war, and the fact that other clubs will grab off some of these players. But you can pick some of them.\" Here is part of the letter telling of the players, written mostly in note form:...SCHREINER GREATEST: \"Ends: Schreiner, Wisconsin, if not in service could be greatest of college crop. A natural pick, but probably won't be available for your pick. Currivan, Boston college, a close second, another natural choice. Then there are Poschner, Georgia, Dove of Notre Dame and Ferguson of California. But the three darkhorse predictions are Al Hurst, Tennessee, Marty Comer, Tulane, and Bob Shaw, Ohio State. Then follow Suesoff, Washington State, Gantt, Duke, Motl, Northwestern, and Smith, UCLA. Tackles: The Big Ten has four naturals for the pro league, Dick Wildung, Minnesota, Paul Hirschbrunner, Wisconsin, Chuck Csuri, Ohio State, and Al Wistert, Michigan. The best prospect, though, is big Don Whitemire from Alabama's great line. Also Johnson, Kentucky, Donaldson, Penn, Bouley, Boston College, Stamm and Banducci, Stanford, Wickett, Oregon State, and Palmer, TCU.\"...GUARD KINGPIN BASE: \"Guards: The kingpin prospect here is Canale of Boston college, an immovable object on defense. Also come Lin Houston, Ohio State, Nick Burke, Northwestern, and Chuck Taylor, Stanford. Along with Ruark, Georgia, Ramsey, William and Mary, and Agase, Illinois. Hardy of Georgia Tech is tops but light for pro ball. Other good ones are Lescouli, UCLA, and McIntrye, Fordham. Centers: Harrison, Washington, Sabasteanski, Fordham, Manning, Georgia Tech, and Pregulman, Michigan, all on an even base. Backs: The backs the Packer need the most are the breakaway artists, and here they are: Black, Mississippi State, Gafford, Auburn, Daley, Minnesota, Steuber, Missouri, and Hillenbrand, Indiana. Also some welcome additions would be Jenkins, Vanderbilt, Kennedy, Washington State, Holovak, Boston college, Filipowicz, Fordham, Connolly, Boston college, Johnson and Longnere, William and Mary, Craft, Alabama, Waterfield, UCLA, Day, Oregon State, Griffin, Illinois, and Sarringhaus, Ohio State.\n\nPACKER FANS WELCOME DORAIS AS NEW DETROIT LIONS COACH\n\nJAN 12 (Green Bay) - Signing of Gus Dorais, the accomplished Detroit lawmaker and football coach, is welcome news around these parts. It means that the Green Bay Packer-Lion rivalry, just a spark the past few years, may start to burn. Besides making it hot for Coach Curly Lambeau's lads and at the same time interesting for the customers, Dorais' entrance in the National league could give the Chicago Bears one more worry in the Western division. In the last three years, the only headache the Bears had was the Packers. Good friends off the field but deadly enemies on the gridiron, Dorais and Lambeau started something back in 1937 when the College All-Stars nipped a dog-tired Packer club, 6-0, in Soldiers' field in Chicago. This should make for a lot of interesting copy come next fall. Lambeau is looking for Dorais to build up the old Detroit-Packer rivalry that resulted in more than one sellout crowd at City stadium. The Detroit game was shifted to Milwaukee last fall, and in 1941, the Packers defeated Detroit, 23-0, before a disappointed gathering. Detroit clubs featuring Ernie Caddell, Dutch Clark, Ace Gutowsky, Lloyd Cardwell and many others drew almost as well as the Bears not so long ago...PASSED TO ROCKNE: Lambeau considers Dorais one of the best coaches in the country, and believes he'll succeed because he is a great exponent of the forward pass. Dorais was one of the game's first great forward passers three decades ago while pitching aerials at Notre Dame to his roommate, Knute Rockne. His University of Detroit elevens have used the airways for nearly 18 years and a .700 winning average.\n\nISBELL, HUTSON VOTED TO ALL-LEAGUE TEAM\n\nJAN 13 (Green Bay) - Cecil Isbell and Don Hutson, the Green Bay Packers' peerless passing combination, today were named to the NFL's 12th annual mythical all-league team. Packer Charles (Buckets) Goldenberg, a ten-year veteran, made right guard on the second team. Receiving honorable mention were tackle Buford (Baby) Ray, halfback Tony Canadeo and quarterback Larry Craig...HUTSON'S SIXTH YEAR: Hutson was the only unanimous choice. It was the fifth consecutive year he was named to the first string, and the sixth time in eight seasons that he topped the vote among ends. Isbell also was a member of the first team last year. The committee of nine newspapermen evinced a definite preference for Isbell over Sammy Baugh of Washington at halfback, principally because he is a better ball carrier and because of his greater passing productivity. He delivered at least one touchdown pass in his last 23 consecutive league games. Like nine of its predecessors, the team is dominated by Western division players. Five places went to Chicago's once invincible Bears. Three of them, including Danny Fortmann, guard; Clyde Turner, center; and Sid Luckman, quarterback, were first team selections in 1941. It was the fifth successive year for Fortmann, and the second year in a row that he missed being a unanimous choice by one first place vote...ARTOE, FAMIGLIETTI NAMED: Other Bears selected were tackle Lee Artoe and fullback Gary Famiglietti. It marked the first time since 1934, when New York won the title and placed five men on the all-league team, that one club has supplied so many first team selections. Tackle Wee Willie Wilkin and end Bob Masterson are the only members of the champion Washington Redskins voted first string berths. Guard Bill Edwards of New York and Bill Dudley of Pittsburgh, the rookie of the year, complete the eleven. Famiglietti, 230-pound line plunger who took over the Bears' fullbacking when Bill Osmanski was injured on the sixth play of the opening game here at Green Bay, polled four first place votes to beat out Andy Farkas of Washington by a margin of two points. Dudley, the league's ground gaining champion, is the first rookie to be chosen since Davey O'Brien was named quarterback in 1939. Like Fortmann, he missed being a unanimous choice by one vote, although he also appeared on all nine ballots. Sid Luckman's only opposition for quarterback came from Sammy Baugh, the Redskins' field general and passing paragon. Baugh missed first team selection when the committee split its ballot, some of the selectors placing him at halfback. Luckman received six first place votes...GUARD RACE WIDE OPEN: Failure of a Washington guard to make either the first or second team came as something of a surprise after the superb performance of Dick Farman, Steve Slivinski and Clyde Shugart in the championship game. Outside of Fortmann, however, the race for the guard positions was wide open with seven men receiving first team votes. There seemed to be little question about whom the committee consider the league's best centers. Chuck\n\nCherundolo, who played 25 consecutive quarters for Pittsburgh, and Turner received all the votes, except two for the second team, which went to Mel Hein, retiring star of the New York Giants. At end, opposite Hutson, Masterson took a commanding lead over George Wilson of the Bears and Perry Schwartz of Brooklyn, largely because of a better rounded performance, which combined Wilson's rugged play with Schwartz's pass receiving.\n\nPRO FOOTBALL SHATTERS CROWD RECORDS; 1,725,764 NOSES\n\nJAN 15 (Chicago) - A greater attendance than in any previous year since professional football was organized, watched teams of the NFL during 1942. Spectators totaled 1,725,764 despite the uncertainties of war and the most wretched weather conditions in 10 years, according to Elmer Layden, commissioner of professional football. Layden said 14 charity games drew 453,652 fans and preseason exhibitions were played before 156,958 more. The remaining 1,115,154 attended the regularly scheduled games of the championship season - a total that was 6 percent less than the record number attracted to the same number of games the previous season. However, 16 of the 1942 games, 30 percent of the regular schedule, were played in adverse weather. Layden said a better break from the elements in any five or six of these games would have sent the 1942 attendance above the all-time high of 1,186,616 for the regular schedule, set in 1941. Green Bay's annual visit to Chicago to engage the Bears topped attendance for regular contests, drawing 42,787 to Wrigley field on Nov. 15\n\nPACKERS' HUTSON REPEATS AS MOST VALUABLE PLAYER\n\nJAN 28 (Green Bay) - Doh Hutson, the Green Bay Packer end who capitalized on 'scientific loafing' to become a gridiron success, today was named the most valuable player in the NFL. The selection marked the second straight year Hutson has won the Joe F. Carr trophy. The eight-year Green Bay veteran, who will celebrate his 30th birthday Sunday, is the first performer ever to repeat in the most valuable player balloting. Previous winners of the award made in memory of the founder of the pro league were Mel Hein of the New York Giants; Parker Hall of the Cleveland Rams; and Ace Parker of the Brooklyn Dodgers...SIX FIRST-PLACE VOTES: His selection was a runaway in the poll of nine newspapermen in league cities. The glue-fingered Packer end received six first place votes for an aggregate of 39 points. Only two other players received consideration. They were Bill Dudley, the great rookie back of the Pittsburgh Steelers, who had 18 points as as the result of two first place and four second place votes, and Sammy Baugh of the Washington Redskins, who totaled 15 points on one first place and five second place votes. Announcement of Hutson's selection was made by the NFL office in Chicago. Coaches and competent critics attribute Hutson's play in eight seasons in the pro league to his \"scientific loafing\", a phrase which describes his seeming indifference to what goes on around him on a football field. His ability to elude defensemen to catch passes from Cecil Isbell can be traced to a baffling \"change of pace\" in his running. He has the uncanny knack of getting a step's \"jump\" on any player trying to cover him. The selection committee in outlining the reasons for Huston's selection said:...CONSIDER NUISANCE VALUE: \"The selection did not rest alone on his great pass catching ability. Also considered were his nuisance value as a disrupter of enemy defenses and his ability to transform the Packers into a confident, powerful aggregation in clutch situations.\" A product of the University of Alabama, Hutson, who operates the Don Hutson Packer Playdium here, holds more records than any player in the league's 22-year history. His pro grid marks total 17. Popular and active in civic affairs, he recently was named chairman of the Brown County Red Cross drive. Hutson led the league in scoring last season for the third straight time, the first player ever to accomplish that trick. He posted 138 points in 11 league games. He recently was named to the all-league team for the sixth time...GAINED 5,515 YARDS: The marks that set Hutson apart from other superstars of pro football, however, are his pass catching achievements. In eight seasons he's caught 336 passes for a gain of 5,515 yards and 72 of his catches were good for touchdowns. Huston has played in 91 games during his pro career and has caught at least one pass in 89 of those encounters. The passes have ranged in gains from four inches to 92 yards.\n\nISBELL TAKES PASS FROM HUTSON IN MANITOWOC FETE HONORING CECE\n\nFEB 5 (Green Bay) - Cecil Isbell, just a bit over his football weight, reversed his usual gridiron procedure here Thursday night and caught a pass from Don Hutson that went for a touchdown in the hearts of Manitowoc grid fans. The football in this case was a distinguished service medal which designated Isbell as the outstanding young man of Manitowoc for 1942. His achievements on the football field for the Green Bay Packers as well as his business activities here led to selection of Isbell as the receiver. Cece is in the water softening business here. Introduced by Del Brault, president of the Junior Chamber of Commerce which sponsored the banquet in the Hotel Manitowoc, Hutson gave an address before passing the award to Isbell, who, in turn, delivered a brief \"thank you\" message. Nearly 100 persons attended. Admitted that he was \"blessed with outstanding passers from Dixie Howell (at Alabama) up to Isbell,\" Hutson said he owed Isbell \"more than anything I know. He was responsible for any success I might have had on the gridiron.\" The Packer pas catcher recalled many times during the last season when 'we could have run with the ball\". One of these incidents was a four-inch touchdown pass against Cleveland last fall...COULD TAKE BEATING: Hut praised Isbell as the \"only passer in the National league who can take a beating if he knows a play will work the next time.\" The receiver, who completed his 13th year of football last fall, said the best break he ever got was in coming to Green Bay because \"Curly Lambeau played the kind of football that I liked to play.\" Admitting that he was prejudiced, Hutson said that \"football was the greatest game in the country. It develops good habits, a clean, health body, and is now preparing young men for a bigger game that we can't lose.\"\n\n​SAYS PRO LOOP WILL CARRY ON\n\nFEB 11 (Kaukauna) - Earl (Curly) Lambeau, coach of the Green Bay Packers, believes there will be sufficient players available next fall to guarantee a full campaign for the NFL. Declaring that sandlots are not a good source of pro league material, Lambeau said at a high school banquet last night that National league teams could replenish their rosters with former college stars and ex-professionals who have been out of football only a few years and who have not yet been accepted for military service. \"Mel Hein, Clarke Hinkle, Don Hutson, Joe Stydahar and Johnny Blood, among others, were pressing or past the 30-year mark while still starring,\" Lambeau said, supporting his view that younger men several years out of college can still make a go of it in the pro league. \"If necessary our training periods could be lengthened to give these men an opportunity to regain their poise, and we also could adopt the free substitution rule to give them a better break in actual competition.\" He added that he disagreed with Elmer Layden, commissioner of the league, who said recently that the pro league \"may have to go to the sandlots for players.\" The dinner was in honor of Paul Little, Kaukauna coach.\n\nTHIRD SCORING TITLE FOR HUTSON\n\nFEB 17 (Green Bay) - Don Hutson, who is strictly a case for Thurman Arnold, cornered five more NFL records in 1942 as he won the scoring championship for the third straight season. It was no more a contest than the race for honors for receiving, which Hutson has monopolized for the last two years. The veteran Green Bay end froze out all of his competitors by scoring twice as many point as his nearest rival, Ray McLean of the Chicago Bears. McLean finished with 54, Hutson with 138. The mere winning of the scoring championship was a record in itself. No player had ever won three straight scoring titles, and only the redoubtable Dutch Clark had been able to finish first that many times. But with his typical leisurely indifference, Hutson added new records for touchdowns scored on forward passes (17), total touchdowns (17) and extra points in one season (33). Together with a field goal that gave him 138 points, also a new record. Previous highs for touchdown passes was ten, total touchdowns 12 and total points, 95, all of which Hutson set in 1941. The former record for most extra points in a season was 28, established by Automatic Jack Manders of the Bears, in 1934. These performances served to put Hutson's three lifetime scoring records farther beyond the reach of future\n\nNational leaguers. He now has caught 72 touchdown passes, scored 74 touchdowns and brought his total points for eight seasons to 524. Two big days on consecutive weekends were the deciding factors in his touchdown records. Against the Chicago Cardinals on Nov. 1 and the Cleveland Rams on Nov. 8, he lugged three passes over the goal line. This brought to six the number of times he has scored three times on passes against one opponent. Hutson kicked six extra points against the Chicago Cardinals on Nov. 1 to give him a total of 24 points for the day, the second largest ever scored by a National league player...MCLEAN CATCHES EIGHT: McLean, rapidly developing the only approach to Hutson's receiving ability in football, caught eight touchdown passes and returned a punt 89 yards against the Chicago Cardinals on Oct. 11 to nose out his teammate, All-League fullback Gary Famiglietti, for second place. Famiglietti smashed over enemy goal lines eight times to lead the league in touchdowns running. He was followed by two other Bears, rookie Frank Maznicki , who added 21 extra points to two touchdowns and four field goals for 45 points, and Hugh Gallaraneau, recently commissioned a lieutenant in the marines, who scored seven touchdowns. Team scoring slumped off slightly, ten clubs totaling 1,747 points in 55 league games against 1,812 in 1941. There were only 129 touchdowns scored by rushing. In 1941, National leaguers produced 144 times through this method. This deficit, however, was made up by 108 touchdowns by passing, against 100 the previous season. The Chicago Bears retained the team scoring championship with a total of 376 points and set a record for extra points by kicking 46. Washington rang up a new mark for safeties, scoring two. The only other team record was established by Green bay, which bettered its old mark of 20 touchdown passes, set in 1938. Led by Hutson, the Packer went over 28 times via the air. The Bears also broke the old record, scoring 21 times on passes.\n\nTURNER BEST PASS STEALER\n\nFEB 19 (Chicago) - Clyde (Bulldog) Turner, the Chicago Bears 235-pound center, turned out to be the best patrolman in the NFL passing traffic in 1942 - intercepting eight enemy tossers to establish a record. In the Bears' last game of the season, Turner filched a pass thrown by Bud Schwenk of the Chicago Cardinals to beat out the league's most consistent record-wrecker, Don Hutson. The Green Bay Packer star was in for several steals and may have made another had he not seen only limited action in his last game against Pittsburgh because of an injury. Art Jones of Pittsburgh and Marshall Goldberg of the Cardinals jointly held the interception record of seven, notching that mark in 1941...RUNS BACK 42 YARDS: Turner's longest runback of an interception was 42 yards against the Cardinals Oct. 11, and it have him his only touchdown of the season, official league statistics showed today. O'Neal Adams, New York Giant rookie, was credited with the longest return, going 66 yards for a score against Washington Sept. 27, in the only game the National championship Redskins lost. Passing accuracy was slightly improved in 1942, with only 9.7 percent of all passes thrown in league games being intercepted as compared with 9.9 percent the previous season. Only seven interceptions were returned for touchdowns in 1942, against a record total of 10 in 1941.\n\nJOE LAWS THIRD BEST PASSER BY MAKING TWO OUT OF THREE\n\nFEB 23 (Green Bay) - Things you might have missed in the NFL's batch of 1942 statistics - Joe Laws, aging Green Bay Packer halfback, was the third-best passer in the league - in percentage. Joe completed two out of three passes for a percentage of. 667. He gained 76 yards in the two completions and the longest, 62 yards, for a touchdown. The league had two perfect pitchers - Merle Hapes of the New York Giants and Len Janiak of the Cleveland Rams. Janiak threw one pass and completed it for 11 yards and 1.000, while Hapes completed two out of two tosses but lost 12 yards in the attempts. Anyway, Laws set some sort of a goal for the league's aerial champ, Cecil Isbell, to shoot at...Believe it or not, those poor Detroit Lions, who didn't win a game all year, shared a \"championship\" with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Both teams made all of their points after touchdown. Detroit only scored five touchdowns and Brooklyn 13. The Packers missed points after touchdown only twice after their 41 touchdowns...Green Bay and the Chicago Cardinals turned in the best performances in field goal kicking, each making five out of ten attempts. New York and Pittsburgh each tried 16 field goals, and each made three...Champ Seibold, the Oshkosh giant who played with the Packers several years back and who last year made a comeback with the Cardinals, was the only tackle to score a touchdown last fall. He did it against the Bears by intercepting a pass. Seibold was one of 45 players who scored one touchdown last season...Perry Schwartz of Brooklyn and the Packers' Hutson were the only pass receivers who gained over 70 yards in any one reception. Hutson picked one off for a 73-yard gain against the Cards and Schwartz snagged a pass for 71 yards. Eight players bettered 60 or more yards in a single catch, one of which was a 64-yard gain by Andy Uram in the Card game...The Cardinals favored neither passing nor rushing last season, scoring six times by each method for their dozen touchdowns. On the other hand, Pittsburgh was definitely rushing minded, counting 21 T.D.'s by rushing and only two by passing. The Packers were up in the air most of the time, scoring 28 times in the ozone and only 13 by rushing.\n\nRED SMITH TO COACH BREWERS BALL CLUB\n\nMAR 5 (Green Bay) - Richard (Red) Smith, manager of the Green Bay Bluejays for the last two seasons and long identified with baseball as a player, coach and manager, has been signed as a coach by the Milwaukee Brewers for the 1943 season. Contracts of nine Green Bay players also went to the Brewers, although it is unlikely that any of them will engage in professional baseball this year because of the war. Eight already are in uniform and the ninth is a reserve who is likely to be called for service soon...REPORTS IN APRIL: Smith said that he probably will report for work with the Milwaukee club sometime in April. He will be relieved of his duties in time next fall so that he may continue to serve as line coach for the Green Bay Packers. For the last several months he has been assistant director at the Columbus Community club. Becoming manager of the Bluejays in 1941, Smith carried the club to the Wisconsin State league championship. He had another strong team last year, finishing only one game behind the first-place Sheboygan club...LONG WITH BREWERS: Smith has been identified with the Brewers since 1936, although during the last two years he served only during the spring training period. In 1936 he was the Brewers' catcher for part of the season, and finished as manager of the Fieldale farm club. The next two seasons he was manager at Hopkinsville, another farm team, and in 1939 he was in Milwaukee all season as coach. The following year he returned as coach, but spent part of his time with the Brewer farm system.\n\nNATIONAL FOOTBALL CIRCUIT TO DRAFT PLAYERS IN CHICAGO\n\nMAR 5 (Chicago) - The player draft will highlight the annual business meeting of the NFL here April 6-8. The draft originally was scheduled last December, but postpones because of wartime uncertainties. The delay has given club owners in the professional league additional time to survey the field and determine what collegiate gridders will be available next fall. Other important matters to be discussed are the 1943 schedule and rules revisions. Commissioner Elmer Layden recently conferred with War Manpower Commissioner Paul V. McNutt and Defense Transportation Director Joseph B. Eastman and will report the outcome of those meetings to the league.\n\nDUNN, BLOOD ONCE SCORED T.D. ON 140-YARD PLAY AFTER PUNT\n\nMAR 11 (Green Bay) - Did you ever hear about the Red Dunn-Johnny Blood 140-yard touchdown play? Probably not, because it happened in Providence, R.I., back in 1929 after the Green Bay Packers had sewed up their National league championship. Dunn and Blood stood on their own 20 at opposite sides of of the field waiting to take a Providence punt, according to Spike Spachmann, former Packer ticket manager who saw the game?...\n\nWATCHING SCENERY?: The long punt came to Dunn who ran up the sidelines to the Packers' 40, where he stopped and passed diagonally across the field to Blood who stayed on his own 20, apparently to watch the scenery. With the Providence gridders on Dunn's side of the field, Blood ran unmolested down his sideline for 80 yards and a touchdown. That makes a total of about 140 yards. The Packers won the game, 28 to 0. Incidentally, Blood, now a private at Chanute field, kept on running and went clear up the side of a banked motorcycle track which circled the field. He made gestures on his way down the track...HUTSON IN INDIA: Don Hutson of the Packers made \"Victory\", a publication for the India Command, writes Lieutenant A.M. Lison to his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred M. Lison, 126 S. Madison street. The paper comments: \"Seems silly for a guy to risk life and limb butting through a wall of human flesh just to gain five yards when Hutson gets 20 yards catching a pass with nobody around. He is the biggest single drawing card in the game today. People exclaim that all Hutson can do is catch passes. Wrong. But he can do that better than any man who ever lived.\"...WORK AND PLAY: Sturgeon Bay and Manitowoc provide an excellent \"working grounds\" for the 1943 Green Bay Packers - if they are required to work during the day and practice at night. S.B. has regular bus service, too...REAL OLDTIMER: During the 1942 season end Joe Carter of the Green Bay Packers carried the distinction of being the only charter member of the Philadelphia Eagles still playing. 32 or over, Carter played with the Eagles since they entered the National league in 1933. He led the league in pass receiving in 1934.\n\nPLAYER DRAFT CAN'T BE MUCH WORSE FOR BAYS THIS YEAR\n\nMAR 16 (Green Bay) - The 1943 NFL draft to be held in Chicago April 6, 7 and 8 couldn't be much worse for the Green Bay Packers than the 1942 draft. Coach Curly Lambeau selected 20 players a year ago and got just one - Bob Ingalls, University of Michigan center. Ingalls is a private in the air corps at Atlantic City, N.J. The '43 draft is expected to be nothing more than a formality. In many instances, selections will be made only to establish property rights for the athletes when the war is over. Each coach, however, is expected to carry briefcases with notes on scores of players who are married and have children...Sergeant Bob Adkins, former Packer blocking back, writes Mrs. Sue L. Wallen that he has received a package from the Sullivan Post, American Legion. He adds \"thanks and I am making good use of everything.\"...Don Hutson was the only Packer scoring in all three departments of play last season. He scored 17 touchdowns, kicked 33 extra points and booted one field goal in the final game. Rookie fullback Ted Fritsch was the only other Packer to boot a field goal, kicking four of them. He added one extra point but failed to score a touchdown...Chuck Sample went through a bruising NFL season as a Packer fullback and came out with nary a scratch. One week at Camp Grant, Ill., and he had a broken ankle, receiving while sauntering about the military premises...Coach Curly Lambeau is considering a survey among his 1942 Packers in order to get a line on their intentions for next season. Thus far, the results are encouraging with a number of the gridders planning to return next fall.\n\nROHRIG REACHED PEAK WHILE PLAYING WITH ARMY ALL-STARS\n\nMAR 23 (Green Bay) - Although Herman Rohrig was a standout in prep, collegiate and professional football, the second lieutenant at Kessler field, Miss., claims he did not reach his peak last fall when he played with Major Wallace Wade's Western Army All-Stars. Rohrig, a left halfback with the Packers in 1941, operated with John Kimbrough and a raft of other stars with Wade's team for what could be called his second \"pro\" season. The All Stars played only professional opponents. With Nebraska, Rohrig tossed a 40-yard touchdown pass against Stanford in the Rose bowl and carried a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown against Missouri...Charley Brock, Packer center who is well known for his famous ball theft in the Chicago Cardinals game last fall, may help coach spring football at Nebraska. Guard Buckets Goldenberg is now showing Milwaukeeans something about handball in physical education classes there, which should qualify him as a jack of all trades. Buckets, in his day, has played football, baseball and competed in track; sold real estate; wrestled in the pro ring; managed an investment company; and more recently opened a restaurant...'Tis said that Don Hutson would not be here today if he had not caught the touchdown pass that beat the Chicago Bears here in 1935 on the first play of the game. Coach Curly Lambeau was said to have told Hutson to keep right on running out of the stadium if he failed. And Hutson was running toward the west gate, too, when he snared Arnie Herber's 70-yard peg for the T.D...Guard Russ Letlow has completed boot training at Great Lakes and in all probability will be available to play on the Great Lakes eleven next fall. Tony Canadeo of the Naval Air corps will get his pre-flight training at Monmouth college. Private Pete Tinsley of the U.S. Army is losing weight at Miami Beach, Fla.\n\nBAYS DRAW $2.96 FROM EACH FAN AT TILT WITH ARMY\n\nMAR 31 (Green Bay) - Chalk up another \"victory\" for the Green Bay Packers. They drew $2.96 from each of the 14,146 persons attending the Western All-Star game in Milwaukee last fall, an average higher than for any other club in the National league, according to simple division of official figures released by the league office. Of gross receipts of $48,450.35, a total of $41,918.46 was paid to the Army Relief Fund. A total of $3,144.40 was taken out for taxes and the remainder for bare expenses. Although some of the other Army Relief games involving league teams contributed more than $41,918.46, the per customer gift was surprisingly low in comparison with the Packer figure. For instance, the 34,355 persons attending the Brooklyn Dodger-Eastern Army game contributed $46,093.05 or an average of only $1.34, or $1.62 less than the Packer figure...50,962 PAY $1: Take the Washington-Western Star game at Los Angeles which drew 50,963 persons. The amount to army relief was $52,873.74 or slightly over $1 per person. one case, War Relief got less than $1 per head. The New York-Army tussle at New York packed in 33,105 persons but only $20,615 for an average of nearly 63 cents per fan. The Giants' second game, at Syracuse, did better as 29,294 person contributed $49,549 for an average of just over $1.60. And Coach Curly Lambeau wasn't fooling last fall when he stated that expenses for the Army game would be cut to rock bottom. Let's figure the expenses for the eight games by deducting the taxes plus the Army Relief total from the gross receipts...BAY EXPENSES LOW: The Packers' expenses of $3,387.49 were the absolute low. Next were the New York game at Syracuse which cost the Giants $4,476.90. Other expense figures: New York at New York, $51,796.05; Bears at Boston, $28,476.87; Washington at Los Angeles, $27,222.23; Detroit at Detroit, $13,258.74; Brooklyn at Baltimore, $10,342.45; Chicago Cardinals at Denver, $9,975.79. In all, the league contributed $324,133.94 from the eight games attended by a total of 240,833. Other relief games like the College All-Star tilt and the Pro Bowl battle resulted in a relief melon of $514,671.46. The grand total raised for relief is $680,384.07. Here's another feather in the Packer hat:...BEST BOND EFFORT: The outstanding item in bond sales, which totaled approximately $4,000,000 at league games and rallies, is credited to Coach Curly Lambeau and his passing combination, Cecil Isbell and Don Hutson, who received a treasury citation for selling $2,100,000 worth in a single night's rally in Milwaukee.\n\n​PRO GRIDMEN ENROLLED AT M.U. MEDICAL SCHOOL\n\nAPR 1 (Milwaukee) - Paul Berezney, a tackle with the Green Bay Packers last year, and Bill Combs, Philadelphia Eagles end, are students at the Marquette university school of medicine. Both are reserves in the armed forces. Berezney a lieutenant in the medical administrative corps of the Army and Combs an engineer in the Navy.\n\nPACKERS FIELD TO BE PLOWED UP!\n\nAPR 1 (Green Bay) - After heated discussion last night, the city council voted to plow under the Packer football field for use as a community victory garden this summer. Plowmen began to turn the sod this morning, and by Friday it is expected the field will be ready for cultivation. A woman's committee by noon today had secured a list of 47 women's groups who will form the first vanguard of Gridiron Gardeners. Councilmen decided to convert City stadium from football to food because of the acute shortage of both fresh and canned vegetables. At first Joannes or Fisk park were considered as sites, but proponents gave way when it was pointed out that the ticket windows will make ideal outlets both for handing out work assignments and distributing the produce. In addition, the high walls will keep out marauders...WHAT'S A LITTLE TILE: Conversion of the field to a garden will force the Green Bay Packers to use the West High stadium as a practice field, a shift which football spokesmen said they would gladly make in the interests of victory. It does not affect the Packer game schedule, however, as the corporation had earlier decided to play games this season only before army and navy camps. Chief council opponents of the measure to convert the field to food said that plowing will destroy the tile foundation on which the sod is laid, and which was put in at some cost. However, as proponents argued, what is tile when the city needs carrots. In addition, a 23rd ward councilman pointed out that salvage from the field can go into the tile collection campaign which will open next week to gather badly needed material from the Sturgeon Bay housing project...THERE'S A WAR ON: News of the city's latest sacrifice for war shocked Green Bay citizen when they heard it this morning. However, when they got into first shock, most admitted the wisdom of turning turfs into turnips and other needed articles. Leaders of the movement plan to turn the shower room into dressing compartments and lockers for the football farmerettes and others who will care for the crops. It is expected that the shifts of clubhouse women will do the bulk of the work in view of the shortage in manpower. In the fall produce will roll out through ticket windows and stadium gates as those who believe in Lirpa Loof stand in line to call for their beets at the box office. Those who wish to volunteer for gardening on the gridiron are advised to get their hoes sharpened up for today is - April Fool!\n\nAPRIL FOOL GAGS BROUGHT MANY LAUGHS AND THRILLS TO CITY\n\nAPR 2 (Green Bay) - Green Bay citizens fell for the Press-Gazette's Lirpa Loof gags Thursday - hook, line and sinker. The comment on the Packer field yarn was almost unbelievable; the city's girls were preparing to welcome a battalion of six-foot soldiers at that imaginary camp off the Cedar Creek road; and scores of persons were wondering where in Sam Hill is Sir C. Sandwich Hamm. It be wise to explain Lirpa Loof before someone starts to connect Mr. Loof hook, line and sinker. Lirpa Loof is April Fool spelled backward, and this story is designed as an explanation for a lot of shocked Green Bayites. The Packer field plow up hoax really took the cake. It was splattered under a picture of a farmer behind horses and plow, slicing up City stadium grass. It was said that the city council had just voted to plow up the field and use it for a community victory garden but of course there had been no such action...ZIMONICK GAVE HAND: The trick photography employed was the secret of success because more than one person interviewed on the street commented that \"it's a shame to cut up a the field like that\", or some similar statement. Most citizens admitted they were \"darned mad\" about the whole thing. Few of them noticed that a 23rd ward councilman was involved in the council voting. It can be revealed that there are only 22 wards in the city. What made it 'worse\" was that the April Fool part of the story was \"jumped\" onto Page two. In their hurry, disgust and despair, many readers didn't turn the page. They just shook their heads, said, \"Well, I'll be ---\". and looked at the picture again. Now about that trick photography. Clarence Bredell, Press-Gazette photographer, went to the Zimonick Brothers trucking garden and snapped a hired hand plowing up a piece of land. It was all \"fixed\" up since Mr. Zimonick isn't ready to plow yet. Bredell loaded his camera again and drive two miles to City stadium where he 'shot\" the field and East stands from the northwest corner. From the negatives he developed the prints. The horse farmer, his plow and the part that was plowed up was cut out of the print - 'twas like cutting out paper dolls - and pasted onto the print of the stadium. The plate was engraved from the \"double\" picture and that's what you saw on Page 1 Thursday night...LAMBEAU GOT A JOLT: Coach Curly Lambeau got a jolt when he grabbed the Press, but quickly survived when he got to thinking about it. In fact, Lambeau said he had a hard time convincing people that the field wasn't going to be plowed up; \"they thought I was pulling an April Fool joke.\" Another \"error\" besides the 23rd ward councilman, deliberately put in the story was that the \"city council voted to convert the area into a garden.\" It would be up to the board of education to say yes or no to cutting up the field and forming the Gridiron Gardeners.\n\nMANDEL OBJECTS TO FREEZING OF PRO FRANCHISES\n\nAPR 3 (New York) - The NFL will start a three-day meeting in Chicago Tuesday to decide what's what for next fall. And indications are that the answer for most clubs will be \"football is what\". Three or four clubs have hinted that they'd like to suspend for the duration but Prexy Jack Mara of the Giants figures that if the others vote to play, the lukewarm gents will string along with them. Otherwise the word is that the franchise likely will be \"frozen\" and the remaining players distributed among the other clubs. What's more interesting, Mara said, will be to see whether the clubs draft college players for this season or pick the big name guys in hope that they'll still be available after the war...OPTIMISTIC NOTE: Still quoting Mara: \"From what we have heard, there will be a good many football players next fall - boys in the various reserves who don't expect to be called until December or January and those who have been deferred. As long as we can get eleven men (maybe just a few more, eh, Jack) and the other guys can get eleven they'll be football at the Polo Grounds. Maybe we'll have to put a call out before the games and get some of those old A-1 Americans or old Monday morning quarterbacks in the stands to come and help us.\"...CONTROVERSIAL NOTE: Very much agin' freezing franchises is owner Fred Mandel of the Detroit Lions. \"Unless the owners are in some branch of the armed forces,\" he says, \"I feel that the franchise should be taken up. If a club quits because it hasn't the fortitude to take a losing season financially, or hasn't the aggressiveness to dig up the players, I think it should forfeit its right to play in the league.\"\n\nLAMBEAU TO TAKE 500 NAMES TO CHICAGO SESSION NEXT WEEK\n\nAPR 3 (Green Bay) - Coach Curly Lambeau's famous briefcase will be loaded with the names of 500 prospective Green Bay Packer footballers when he goes to Chicago next week for the annual spring meeting of the NFL. There's a catch, though. Four hundred of the names represent boys who are in service or will be eligible for Uncle Sam's activity next fall, the time the National league will start its own form of activity...25 YEARS OLD: Of the remaining 100 gridders, Lambeau expects to gather up enough boys to form the \"silver\" edition of the Packers. It will be 25 years ago that Lambeau collected a crowd of boys and launched pro football in Green Bay. The coach expects to salvage about 15 players from the 1942 team. Complete historical data has been obtained on each of the 500 boys. Chief items of interest to Lambeau are their previous experience and status in the draft. About 70 percent of the players are married and about half of them have children. Lambeau isn't asking for any signatures yet. \"We'll wait until after the meeting and see where we stand.\" If the go-ahead signal is flashed, Lambeau said he'd have some of the new boys under contract \"very soon\". In previous years, the gridders were signed shortly after they were drafted...DRAFT A FORMALITY: Incidentally, the draft at the Chicago meeting will be nothing more than a formality, chiefly to give the various teams player rights. Just about all of the 1942 collegiate stars are in service. A report by Commissioner Elmer Layden on his recent visit to Washington where he conferred with Paul V. McNutt and other officials is expected to be a highlight of the meeting. Since his trip to Washington, Layden has said that the league will operate next fall. Lambeau believes that no rule changes will be made, except possibly a new ruling on substitution. A member of the league's rule committee, Lambeau thinks unlimited substitution would make a more colorful and faster game. It would also give \"older\" players more opportunity to rest themselves...DRAW UP SCHEDULE: League officials will also draw up the 1943 schedule, although all of the teams know already who their opponents will be under the league's schedule setup. The Packers, for instance, will play host to the Washington Redskins, Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Eagles next fall. They also will play home-and-home series with teams in the Western division - Chicago Bears, Chicago Cardinals, Detroit and Cleveland. Previous to 1933, when the National league divided into its present Eastern and Western divisions, the schedule-making representatives had a merry time jockeying around in the effort to secure the most advantageous setup for each season. Now each team in each section must play its co-members twice during the season, home-and-home. It is then up to the individual clubs to book the other three games with any of the five in the other division. The latter are rotated.\n\nNATIONAL FOOTBALL EXECUTIVES MEET IN CHICAGO\n\nAPR 5 (Chicago) - Executive of the NFL will go into a huddle here Tuesday to make plans for the professional game's kickoff of 1943. The three-day annual meeting, probably the most important in the league's 23-year history because of wartime difficulties, will decide for certain how to carry on this year. Commissioner Elmer Layden reiterated that ten teams will take the field and that the usual 55-game schedule will be played. Problems to be tackles include the annual players draft, which was postponed from last December, and ratification of the 1943 schedule.\n\nGRID PROS WILL PLAY; LAYDEN TELLS PARLEY\n\nAPR 6 (Chicago) - \"We can and will play football next fall,\" optimistically declared Elmer Layden, league president, as owners and coaches of the NFL assembled here Tuesday for a three day discussion of war created problems. \"Pro football still has to be shown,\" he said, \"that it cannot continue in the face of whatever demands selective service or the war in general make upon it.\" \"It's not going to be easy, I know,\" he added. \"Our easy source of playing material, college football, is gone for the duration. We're going to have to work to get players and prepare our teams for the schedule. And we can do it.\" Layden said there were certainly enough 3-A players available \"somewhere in the country\" to allow each club a workable minimum in 1943. He said that even under an accelerated selective service schedule not all players would necessarily be taken by fall. Reports continued to persist, as the league's executive committee convened Monday as a prelude to the league meeting, that two or four clubs would disband and ask that their territorial rights be \"frozen\" for the duration. Layden staunchly maintained, however, that he had not been notified officially that any league members intended to fold. With the manpower problem the chief concern, it was regarded as almost certain that the player limit would be reduced from 33, probably to 25. To permit full use of the limited material, it was also considered certain that the rules committee would recommend adoption of the free substitution rule. The agenda originally called for the player draft on Tuesday, but Fred Mandel of the Detroit Lions sought postponement until Thursday. Mandel attempted last week to get the player draft postponed indefinitely, but was defeated in a telephonic poll. The Lions owner's ostensible reason for the postponement was the illness of his new coach, Gus Dorais. Dorais is at his Detroit home recuperating from a skull fracture. There was no assurance, however, that he would be able to come here Thursday either. Thus the move generally was construed as one designed to stall the draft until after a general business meeting at which time all clubs would be forced to \"show their hands\" by making clear cut statements of their operating intentions in 1943.\n\nPLAYERS DON'T WORRY LAMBEAU\n\nAPR 6 (Chicago Tribune) - Manpower shortage in pro football? Banish the thought, declared Curly Lambeau, the old warrior from Green Bay, last night as he prepared to participate in the NFL's three day get together starting today. Lambeau, with gray building up at the temples, has been in pro football since he was a boy. His contemporary of those early days, Lt. Comm. George Halas of the Chicago Bears, has detached himself from navy duties long enough to participate in the league's important discussions. But Lambeau is the dean of the active pro gents. \"As I look at it,\" said Curly, \"we had our big problem last year after losing 18 of our players. Well, somehow or other we got over that hurdle and managed to have a pretty fair team. Sure, we have our troubles, but for the Packers, 1942 was a tough year.\" The war is a challenge to pro football, says the master of the forward pass offense. \"Well, our roster looked pretty sad this time a year ago,\" reminisced Curly. \"Something had to be done. Someone told me about a fellow named Bob Flowers who was working in California, but who had been quite a center at Texas Tech. Well, I got Bob. We went to Baltimore for an exhibition game with the Washington Redskins. One of our players played 60 minutes. You guessed it - he was Bob Flowers. He'd been out of football for two years, but he got right back in the groove in a hurry. We had another example. Fred Vant Hull had been quite a ball player at Minnesota, but none of the pro teams had gone out of their way to line him up. With this player shortage staring at us, we jumped at the chance to give the boy a chance. When the season ended he was one of our best tackles, and he had been out of football for two seasons.\" Lambeau, a year ago, went through what many of the league clubs will be experiencing for the first time. He ridiculed any expression that the league can't find 250 to 300 ablebodied athletes and carry on with an exposition of pro football. \"A lot of good boys like Flowers and Vant Hull slipped away from us,\" he declared. \"A football player might be a trifle rusty after a two or three year layoff, but he'll come back quicker than you think. There are any number of Flowers and Vant Hulls who'll welcome the chance to play. It's up to us to find 'em.\" The master of the Packers almost is convinced that Don Hutson, his all-time all-league end, really means to retire. But he isn't crying. He's waiting for the results of this meeting before putting any pressure to get another typical Green Bay team.\n\nNATIONAL GRID LOOP MAY OPERATE WITH ONLY SIX CLUBS NEXT FALL\n\nAPR 7 (Green Bay) - Coach Curly Lambeau of the Green Bay Packers today indicated that six clubs - three in each division - may operate in the NFL in 1943. In a long-distance call to Green Bay from the league's annual spring meeting at the Palmer House in Chicago this morning, Lambeau said there is a strong possibility that one or two more clubs may drop out. Cleveland decided to quit for the duration late Tuesday afternoon...MERGE TWO TEAMS: Remaining clubs would be Green Bay, Chicago Bears and Detroit in the Western division, and New York, Washington, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh in the Eastern section. To make three clubs in the east, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh would merge. If six clubs form the league, the teams would play a home-and-home basis, Lambeau believed. The league is expected to vote on this possibility late today. The annual draft will be held at 10 o'clock Thursday morning. Lambeau described Cleveland's move to quit as \"a healthy situation,\" although he added that none of the owners and coaches wanted to see the Rams in the background. The Packer coach added that Cleveland's move cleared the way for \"a smaller but more effective league.\"...VOTE FREE SUBSTITUTION: Lambeau, a member of the league's rules committee, said the group unanimously voted free substitution for next season. It was the only rule change, and all other rules were \"frozen\" for the duration. The league is expected to approve free substitution late today. The player limit will be up for vote today or late Tuesday.\n\nBIG PROBLEMS CONFRONT PROS\n\nAPR 7 (Chicago) - With the Cleveland Rams a wartime casualty, the NFL's future was clouded by the possibility other clubs might drop out long before the 1943 schedule is inaugurated next September. Cleveland petitioned to suspend \"for the duration\" Tuesday and league officials countered by giving the Rams permission to drop out for the coming season. The Cleveland club must notify the league by March 1, 1944, of its future intentions. An extension of the suspension order can be obtained upon request. The withdrawal of the Rams immediately multiplied the league's problems. President Elmer Layden had a schedule drawn and was to submit it for approval today. However, the playing card must now be revised completely, and he doubted if the new chart could be ready for study at the present meeting...PARTICIPATE IN DRAFT: Despite dropping out of the league, Cleveland will go through with its participation in the player draft Thursday, but its title to the 20 college seniors it selects will be short-lived. The players the Rams select in the draft, coupled with 90 on the reserve list and 28 on the active list, immediately will be out up for grabs by the remaining nine clubs. Layden announced the following method would be used for distribution of the accumulated Cleveland talent: The names of all players on the active, reserved and drafted list will be placed in a hat. Then from another hat the clubs will select numbers from one to nine to determine the order in which the Rams gridders will be drawn. Players known to be in the armed services will be scratched from the Cleveland lists before selections are made...AVAILABLE TO PLAY: Coach Chile Walsh of the Rams estimated \"that between 14 and 15 players on the active list remain available for play next season\" but be declined to divulge names of those performers. \"I do not believe it would be fair to the clubs to divulge this information,\" he said. Walsh said the suspension action wasn't a surprise to him. \"I was well aware of the situation when I signed my coaching contract a month ago,\" he said. \"My contract contains a war clause, but I anticipate that I will remain with the Rams until all necessary work is completed.\" Reeves and Levy gained control of the Rams on July 1, 1941 when they purchased franchise from Homer Marshman. The latter had paid $10,000 for a new franchise in the league in 1937...NEVER A WINNER: The Rams never had a winning team during the six-year tenure in the league. The best mark was five victories, five losses and a tie in 1939. Last season the club finished seventh in the standings with five triumphs and six losses. Cleveland's withdrawal focused attention on the difficulties the league faces, and while its lead was not followed immediately, four other club owners were known to be skeptical of their ability to operate. They were not \"stampeded\" into withdrawing along with the Rams because, as one official explained, \"it is a long time before any money has to be placed on the table to indicate you mean business. You can play cards for a long time as long as every draw in the game is a free one.\"\n\nPRO LEAGUE REDUCES PLAYER LIMIT TO 25\n\nAPR 7 (Chicago) - Club owners of the NFL cut the player limit today from 33 to 25 to meet manpower difficulties and voted to permit free substitution of players for the 1943 season against the wishes of most of the coaches. Elmer Layden, commissioner, said man mileage would be reduced 37 percent by adoption of the 25 player limit a cut in the schedule from 55 to 45 games, agreed upon tonight. Each team will meet the other eight clubs and, in addition, will play two other contests with traditional rivals for a total of 10 games. A rough draft of the revised schedule failed to satisfy the owners, however, and Layden was commissioner to submit it later for approval by mail. Reduction of the player limit brought about the change in the substitution rule. Coaches argues against making the rule permanent and were of the opinion that it was against the best interests of the professional game. In agreeing to reduce the player limit some of the club owners said they did not believe any of the nine teams would be able to carry 25 players throughout the season. Curly Lambeau, coach and part-owner of the Green Bay Packers, said, however, that he was of the opinion that he could muster at least 150 players if necessary. Charles (Gus) Dorais, new coach of the Detroit Lions, will be unable to attend tomorrow's draft session, at which 200 graduating collegians will be selected. Dorais has been undergoing hospital treatment in Detroit for a skull fracture and his physician refused him permission to make the trip. Although the Cleveland Rams have dropped out for the duration, their coach, Charles (Chili) Walsh, will be retained on full salary.\n\nNATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE CONDUCTS DRAFT OF MANPOWER TODAY; 1,000 COLLEGIANS LISTED\n\nAPR 8 (Chicago) - The NFL plunged its annual player draft Thursday morning. Off giant blackboards carrying approximately 1,000 names, each of the clubs set about to establish negotiating rights with 20 men. In a normal year the draft list included only about 400 names. The urgency of the times, however, and the need for manpower to keep the league operating influenced the officials to expand the list. Although he is already in the marines, coaches were virtually unanimous in the belief that Frankie Sinkwich, star of Georgia's Rose bowl eleven, would be the No. 1 to be drafted. It was believed most clubs would take several big name stars for \"window dressing\" purposes, then settle down to draw performers who might be on hand for use next fall. The draft has been postponed twice. It was originally scheduled for last December but delayed because of \"uncertain conditions.\" Rescheduled for Tuesday it was put off until Thursday at the request of Fred Mandel, owner of the Detroit Lions. Mandel sought the delay in the hope his newly appointed coach, Gus Dorais, would be able to attend. Dorais, recovering from a skull fracture, has been forbidden by his physician, however, to make the trip here. Detroit, which lost 11 straight games last season to finish in the league cellar, got first choice. Philadelphia, the Chicago Cardinals Brooklyn, Cleveland, New York, Pittsburgh, Green Bay, Chicago Bears and Washington followed the Lions. Although Cleveland will not operate next season, it was permitted to participate in the draft. The players the Rams select, plus those now on its active and reserve lists, then will be distributed among the nine other league members.\n\nPACKERS GET ADAMS, RAM TACKLE, AT DRAFT MEETING\n\nAPR 9 (Chicago) - Coach Curly Lambeau of the Green Bay Packers left here today with the makings of a powerful line - designed to operate with the Isbell-Hutson combination - and a handsome schedule setup for the 1943 season. Lambeau's \"making\" centered about Chet Adams, the 235-pound (married) tackle of the Cleveland Rams. The Bay coach drew Adams' number out of a hat containing names of the suspended Cleveland roster. A four-year veteran, Adams stands six feet three, and lists \"special investigator\" as his job. Lambeau's first choice in the NFL draft, held at the closing meeting at the Palmer house Thursday, was Dick Wildung, All-American tackle from the University of Minnesota...SELECT 19 LINEMAN: The Packer coach selected 19 linemen, indicating that he intends to put a powerful forward wall on the field next fall. He named three University of Wisconsin linemen: Dick Thornally, tackle, Lloyd Wasserbach, center, and George Makris, guard. The league will adopt a schedule at a place to be named later. In final sessions Thursday, the circuit abolished the home-and-home game rules and adopted a rule whereby every club must play one extra game with a team in its own division. Lambeau indicated that three clubs may discontinue operations before the June meeting. If six clubs play, the league will operate on a home-and-home basis, however. The \"for sure\" teams are Green Bay, New York, Washington, Detroit, Chicago Bears and either the Chicago Cardinals or a combination of the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia clubs...DRAWS MIKE HOLOVAK: Lambeau was elated over drawing Mike Holovak, great Boston college fullback, out of the Cleveland hat. Holovak was Cleveland's first choice in the draft. Other former Rams selected by the Packers are Jim Shepherd, Oregon; Bert Davis, Utah, and Dick Kieppe, Michigan State. The presence of one \"corn college\" player in a bevy of All-America stars drawn in the first five rounds of the league's draft served to jolt the gridiron experts. The \"unknown\" who popped up among the \"big name\" stars was Irv Comp from little St. Benedict college at Atchison, Kas., who was the second choice of the Bays...LAMBEAU PULL SURPRISE: While other teams in the pro circuit were scrambling for talented backs, Lambeau pulled the surprise of the draft meeting by picking Comp. He indicated his anxiousness to obtain Comp by signing him before the draft meeting, losing him by a league ruling and then regaining him through draft channels. Comp is a 205-pound Milwaukee boy. He attended the University of Wisconsin for part of his freshman year and then transferred to St. Benedict where he played four seasons under a pair of former Notre Dame stars, Don Elser and Marty Peters. Elser and Peters were the ones who \"tipped\" Lambeau, himself a former Irish star, on Comp's ability. When Lambeau investigated the gridder, he found portly Steve Owen of the New York Giants also on his trail. Comp, currently working in a defense plant, considered both offers and then agreed to sign with the Packers...COMP WAS \"EXPOSED\": Lambeau went into the draft meeting gloating over his good fortune, but his optimism was short-lived as President Elmer Layden ruled Comp had not been \"exposed\" to a draft period and therefore had to be put up for \"grabs\". While that was a jolt it didn't stop Lambeau for long. He picked Wildung as his first player and then took Comp on the second round. Comp figures to be available for football next fall. He is 4-F because of a serious defect in his vision. Wildung was the only lineman chosen on the first round of the draft. The other nine teams picked backfield men...300 PLAYERS DRAFTED: A total of 300 players, in contrast to the\n\nto have a big year in view of the fact that he made a good showing as a freshman here last season. Paul, a student at the Marquette university medical school, weighs 220 pounds and stands six feet, two inches tall. Married and the father of a daughter, Berezney played to years with the Kenosha Cardinals after graduating from Fordham university. With the Cardinals, he earned money to continue his medical work at Marquette. Lambeau took a liking to Berezney's play during an exhibition game in Kenosha in 1941. Berezney was one of the \"seven blocks of granite\", as the Fordham university line of 1938 and 1939 was known. He was a teammate of Harry Jacunski, a former Packer who expects to return this year.\n\nHAWAIIAN FLASH JOINS BAY PACKERS\n\nJUL 20 (Green Bay) - Babe Webb, the flashy Hawaiian halfback, who was supposed to join the Green Bay Packers last season, has signed a contract for 1943 action. Webb, the third Packer under contract, wired Coach Curly Lambeau from Honolulu where he is employed with the news that \"I'm going to make it this time.\" Webb could not get passage a year ago with the result that the Packers had Webb's contract but no Webb. The Hawaiian, who is believed to be on his way to the states now, will report for the opening practice Aug. 15. The former New Mexico star who was placed on the Border conference all-star team in 1939 was recommended last year by Red McQueen, sports editor of the Honolulu Advertiser. He had been playing with the Honolulu Bears, a semi-pro squad, and according to McQueen, Webb is the \"sweetest running back I have ever seen.\" McQueen wrote Lambeau that Webb is interested in starting a professional football career. Lambeau feels that Webb should add considerable speed to the backfield. He goes 185 pounds, which is large for the average Hawaiian. Lambeau made his acquaintance with McQueen when the Packers played there in 1933. Lambeau was informed that Webb is a good passer. He undoubtedly will be one of the many players trying to fill the shoes left vacant by the resignation of Cecil Isbell, the front half of the Isbell-to-Hutson combination, who accepted a coaching position with Purdue university.;\n\nHUTSON STILL CLAIMS THAT HE WILL RETIRE\n\nJUL 21 (Green Bay) - Just about every big time athlete turns to golf when he retired - or is about to retire - from\n\nhis specialized sport. Babe Ruth, the Sultan of Swat, Joe Louis of boxing fame and a 101 others have picked up the clubs and retired to the links. This brings up the nationally known football pass catching and scoring champion - Don Hutson, by name. Hutson, who was 30 last December, has put in eight years of professional football with the Green Bay Packers; four years with the University of Alabama; and two years with Pine Bluff, Ark., High school - a total of 14 seasons of gridiron activity. If you haven't put two and two together, it might be explained that (1) Hutson is a golf addict, and (2) Hutson feels no different about retiring than one day last winter when he told the radio and newspapers that \"1943 would be a good year to retire.\" The spectacular backstop was cornered Tuesday afternoon just before - you guessed it - leaving for a gold match. \"Guess I cannot give you anything of a story,\" Hutson smiled as retirement, Cecil Isbell and many other questions were fired at him. \"I certainly have no intentions of playing this fall, and feel the same as I did last winter when I told you after that radio talk that 1943 would be the year to retire.\"...GOOD PASSERS HELP: Hutson pointed out that he made up his mind long before it was announced that Isbell would join the Purdue university coaching staff, but added that any success he had on the gridiron was due largely to good passers like Isbell. The former (?) Packer intimated that he has played enough football. \"Eight years is a mighty long time at an end or backfield position,\" he explained. And it might be added that Hutson dashes from 20 to 50 yards (average) every time the ball is snapped on offense - not to mention those 60, 70 and 80-yard touchdown runs. Under the new substitution rule, however, it can be pointed out that Hutson could be used only for offense. he could be inserted into action only when the Packers had the ball and removed on defense without a yardage penalty. President and manager of Don Hutson's Packer Playdium, Inc., the football star believes the loss of Isbell will be a tough blow to the Packers. \"Cece is a great team player and would have held an inexperienced backfield together,\" he said...LEFT HALFBACK IMPORTANT: \"A left halfback (Isbell's position) is as important to a football team as a pitcher is to a baseball team.\" Hutson said. And in Isbell's case, the similarity of the two positions is quite noticeable because Cece did all of the pitching. Retirement for Huston now would mean bowing out at the peak of his career. The Packer end broke something like 16 scoring and pass receiving records last fall. He was named the most valuable for the second straight season in 1942, and was again a unanimous choice for his position.\n\nFORMER PACKERS DOING ALL RIGHT IN UNCLE SAM'S NAVY\n\nJUL 21 (Green Bay) - Three former Green Bay Packer linemen are doing all right in the Navy. Lieut. (jg) George Svendsen, who played center and also coaches at Antigo, has been reported sent to sea on active duty. Gus Zarnas, a guard, has been commissioned an ensign and detached from Great Lakes for duty. Lieut. Milt Gantenbein, who played a lot of end for Wisconsin's Badgers before joining the Packers, has been transferred from the naval air station at Jacksonville to the base at Norman, Okla.\n\nPACKERS HAVE TILTS AT HOME WITH BEARS, LIONS; PLAY REDSKINS, CARDS IN MILWAUKEE\n\nJUL 22 (Green Bay) - Official word on the Green Bay Packers' home contests was released from Coach Curly Lambeau's office today just as the Packer mentor was going into a strategic huddle with his left halfback - Cecil Isbell. The Packers will play two NFL games in Green Bay and two of the same nature in Milwaukee. Guests at City stadium will be the Chicago Bears on Sept. 26 and the Detroit Lions on Oct. 10. Opposing the Bays at Milwaukee will be the champion Washington Redskins on Oct. 17 and the Chicago Cardinals on Nov. 14...OPEN LEAGUE PLAY: The Bear game will open\n\nleague action for both clubs, following the 1942 pattern when the Bears and Packers launched firing here Sept. 27. On Oct. 3, Lambeau's men will visit Chicago for a game with the Cardinals. This game, incidentally, will be the first pro league battle of the season in the Windy City. After the Oct. 10 and Oct. 17 dates with Detroit and Washington, the Packers go to Detroit and the Redskins, the Packers go to Detroit Oct. 24 and to New York Oct. 31. The classic Bear-Packer struggle in Chicago is set for Nov. 7. After the Card game in Milwaukee, the Bays close their season in the east - at Brooklyn on Nov. 21 and at Pitt-Phil Dec. 5. In order to save precious miles, the Packers will warm up in the east with two exhibition games, visiting Baltimore for a game with Washington Sept. 5 and Pittsburgh for a game with the combined Phil-Pitt team Sept. 12. The Pitt-Phil game was originally scheduled for Milwaukee Sept. 19. Under present plans the Packers will remain in the east for the two exhibitions...CHANGE ISBELL'S MIND: Lambeau is conducting conferences with Isbell, the Manitowoc merchant and, more recently, backfield coach at Purdue university, in an effort to get the shape passer to change his mind. Although realizing that Isbell has a great chance with Purdue, Lambeau feels that \"Cece is making a mistake by leaving professional football at this time.\" Announcement of Isbell's position with Purdue was made at the Lafayette, Ind., school last week. Isbell, in a telephone conversation here, admitted that \"I hated to get started in a coaching career.\" Isbell was a Purdue hero before coming to Green Bay five years ago. Both Isbell and his pass catcher, Don Hutson, hit the jackpot with the Packers last season, but Lambeau sees no reason why they cannot repeat their outstanding performances. Hutson announced Tuesday that he had no intentions of playing this fall. Lambeau thus far has three players under contract - Paul Berezney, a tackle, and backs Babe Webb and Irv Comp. Berezney will be starting his sophomore year here, although he put in two years with the Kenosha Cardinals after a great career at Fordham. Webb is the Hawaiian star who was supposed to report last season, but was unable to do so because he could not get passage from Honolulu. Comp, who heroed at St. Benedict's college, will come here with a reputation of being the \"greatest ever\" in Coach Harry Stuhldreher's book. Stuhldreher has Comp at Wisconsin for a year. Lambeau will herd his Packers onto the practice field for the first time Sunday, Aug. 15. By that time he expects to have 25 under contract.\n\nPACKERS SIGN MCPHERSON, GIANT NEBRASKA, PROFESSIONAL CENTER\n\nJUL 23 (Green Bay) - Forrest McPherson, who preceded Charley Brock at the University of Nebraska, has signed a contract with the Green Bay Packers, Coach Curly Lambeau announced today. McPherson, a 230-pound center who stands six feet, two inches tall, is the fourth Packer under contract. Brock, who is expected back for his fifth season, became the regular center at Nebraska when McPherson bowed out in 1934. McPherson formerly played with the Philadelphia Eagles and the Los Angeles Bulldogs. His home is in Burbank, Calif....WANT MORE MONEY: Lambeau has resumed negotiations with a large number of Packer veterans who returned their contracts unsigned. Most of the players are asking higher wages despite increases in salaries and living allowances specified in the contracts. A definite decision on Cecil Isbell's status is expected next Tuesday or Wednesday. Lambeau conferred with Isbell in Manitowoc, where Isbell has a water softener business, Thursday. Halfback Isbell recently signed as backfield coach at Purdue university and announced his retirement from professional football. Player activities are booming around the NFL. Philadelphia seems to be the hotbed since the combined Eagles-Pittsburgh Steelers team started an informal practice this week. Coach Greasy Neale had about 15 signed players out...HEWITT IS SIGNED: Among them were Bill Hewitt, former Chicago Bear and one of the few gridders who plays without a helmet; Jack Hinkle of Syracuse, backfield mate of Tom Harmon and Jack Kimbrough on the 1941 New York Yankees; Charlie Gauer, of Hampton-Sydney; and Dean Steward of Ursinus. The Chicago Cardinals have announced that they will practice at Carroll college in Waukesha, starting Aug. 20. New Card coach Phil Handler has signed Andy Puplis, former Notre Dame quarterback. Married and the father of two children, Puplis had been coaching at Maywood (Ill.) High. Things have been quiet in the Chicago Bear camp. Latest signee is Bob Steuer, the great Missouri halfback, who has been invited to play with the College All-Stars against Washington in Evanston, Aug. 25...TEN DETROIT MEN: Coach Gus Dorais has about ten players signed at Detroit, and this week announced that Joe Bach, 42, former University of Notre Dame lineman, will be the line coach of the Lions. Bach was one of the \"seven mules\" who helped Notre Dame's \"four horsemen\" to gridiron fame in the early 20s. In 1935 and 1936, Bach was head coach of the Steelers. Little news is coming out of New York and Brooklyn, although Stout Steve Owen, coach of the Giants, is said have over 20 players already under contract. Pete Cawthon, new coach of the Dodgers, is on a scouting trip in the South.\n\nusual 200 gridders, were drafted in an effort to buoy the chances of getting full squads next fall. The choices were made from a list of prospective performers that totaled 1,150 players. Most of the 300 gridders picked already are in the armed services and shrewd pro circuit observers estimated that \"not more than 10 percent\" of those drafted would report. The reporting percentage a season ago was 28.5, with 57 out of the 200 selectees joining their clubs.\n\nLAMBEAU SATISFIED WITH DRAFT RESULTS\n\nAPR 9 (Chicago) - Curly Lambeau and his right hand bower, the roly poly Red Smith, came out of the annual NFL draft meeting here Thursday night all smiles, and no wonder. They got everybody they really wanted for their Packers and a few they hardly dared hope to get. They got who they insisted was the best college tackle in the country last season. Dick Wildung of Minnesota; one of the best all-around fullbacks, Royal McKay of Texas; the best center, Buddy Gatewood of Baylor; one of the best guards, Bob Barnett of Baylor; the far west's best tackle, Norman Veery of Southern California, and a collection of others as good as any they have ever been able to draw out of these annual \"grabs\", including Irv Comp of St. Benedict's. The selection of Comp in the draft, after Lambeau had signed him as a free agent, followed what threatened for a while to become the year's \"cause celebre\" of the league. Lambeau signed him Sunday as the rules of the league specified he could: \"No player shall be permitted to play on any club (or be signed) until his class has been graduated. The foregoing shall be construed to mean the class to which the player belonged when he first entered a collegiate institution.\" Comp enrolled at Wisconsin in 1937, so that his class was the class of '41. He never finished his freshman year at Wisconsin, however, subsequently enrolled at St. Benedict's, and, after four years of football there, was graduated last February. Comp's first collegiate class was clearly the class of '41. At the start of Thursday's meeting, however, Elmer Layden, president of the league, arbitrarily included Comp on the draft list. He returned the contract Lambeau had sent in, declared Comp's case a little \"unusual\" and flatly refused to entertain Lambeau's protest. It was hardly an auspicious beginning for Green Bay in the draft but it all ended well enough when Lambeau, on his second choice, still had a chance to pick Comp. He did. Wildung was the first choice. The players Lambeau hardly dared hope to get were those drawn in the \"grab bag\" by which the league disposed of the veterans and men drafted by the inactive Cleveland club. Lambeau wanted Chet Adams, one of the best tackles in the league, and Mike Holovak, the Boston Thunderbolt, above all others, but figured it was something too good to happen. And yet when he dug into a hat he came up with both. For the time in the history of the draft, 30 men were drawn instead of 20, and the selections continued from shortly before noon until 9 o'clock at night.\n\nPACKER GRID DRAFTEE COMMISSIONED IN NAVY\n\nAPR 12 (Los Angeles) - Ken Snelling, UCLA fullback who was drawn by the Green Bay Packers in Thursday's draft, has been commissioned an ensign in the navy and will leave soon for training at Fort Schuyler, N.Y. The 212- pound Snelling led the 1942 Bruins' Rose Bowl team in scoring with 45 points.\n\nFREE 'SUBBING' MAY REVOLUTIONIZE PRO FOOTBALL; MAKE TEAMS TOUGH\n\nAPR 23 (Green Bay) - Buried among the headlines of the recent NFL conclave in Chicago was this item: League coaches unanimously approve free substitution rule adopted by rules committee. The free substitution ruling was hardly noticed when Cleveland decided to drop from the circuit and coaches started drafting the nation's gridiron stars, but when the 'law\" is applied next fall the game may be revolutionized. What will F.S. do to the Green Bay Packers next fall? Coach Curly Lambeau explains that men like Cecil Isbell and Don Hutson, who specialize in offense, can be taken out when the Packers go on defense. Generally, Lambeau can make a substitution any time he wants to. Under the old rule, a player could reenter the game only once during the first three quarters but int he final frame two players could reenter...CHANGE ENTIRE STRATEGY: Lambeau believes the rule will change the entire strategy of the game. In future years - possibly not in 1943 because there will be a shortage of players - coaches will employ two teams, once for defense and the other for offense. Coaches are always confronted with players who have certain weaknesses on offense or defense, but free substitution will give the pilots an opportunity to put their best players - defensively or offensively - on the field at the same time. Lambeau expects the rule to result in a better brand of football...WILL HELP TEAMS: The rule was passed chiefly to help player-shorted teams this season. With a large number of \"old timers\" on the bench, the rules committee, composed of Lt. Comdr. George Halas, Steve Owen, Ray Flaherty, Bert Bell and Lambeau, figured that the F.S. rule would give those \"boys\" more chance for rest and at the same time make them feel that they can go all-out when on the field. There were any number of occasions in 1942 when the Packers, and other teams in the league, could have used the free substitution rule. In the second Bear game, for instance, Hutson, despite the fact that he reached his defensive peak last season, could have been taken out when the Bears had the ball - which was often. Hutson, it may be recalled, was operating on an injured ankle and bruised ribs...LAMBEAU ON SCOUTING TRIP: Lambeau left today on a three-day scouting trip around the midwest. He expects to confer with - and sign - about 12 players. One of his chief goals will be Chet Adams, the 235 pound tackle who played with Cleveland the last four years. Lambeau drew Adams' name out of a hat when the Ram players were thrown up for grabs at the league meeting. Adams, together with Baby Ray and Tiny Croft, will form the nucleus of the 1943 Packer line. Adams, an investigator for the Erie railroad, is married and expects to be in civilian clothes most of this year.\n\nLAMBEAU IS WINNER\n\nMAY 4 (Green Bay) - Curly Lambeau has won more than one battle off, as well as on, the football field. His most recent triumph was at the meeting of the NFL some weeks ago and is described by Chester Smith of the Pittsburgh Press: \"The league meeting wasn't without its hilarious by-play. This time it centered around Curly Lambeau of the Green Bay Packers, who discovered he was being made the victim of a whispering campaign by his old friend, George Halas of the Chicago Bears. George went around, telling everybody that the Packers, who have 18 eligible men, were a downright menace to the league and should not be helped in any way. What Halas purposely neglected to mention was the strength of his own team; it suited his purpose better to throw the burden of suspicion on Curly Lambeau. When it came time to draw for the players freed by Cleveland, all the names were dropped into a hat and the owner pulled them in turn, designated by a previous draw. Lambeau extracted No. 9, and there was a great laugh, for the magnates were sure Curly couldn't possibly get Chet Adams, the standout Ram tackle whom everybody wanted. One after another, the owners walked up to the hat and withdrew the slips. Faces fell as they learned the prizes they had won, until it came to Lambeau's turn. His slip read \"Chet Adams\", and the man from Green Bay let loose a bellow that rocked the room. The next order of business was the drawing of the college players Cleveland had picked. Now the goal was Mike Holovak, the Boston college fullback. Mike is in the navy, but he is so well thought of that everyone was perfectly willing to wait for him to come back. When 28 names had been pulled, Holovak's name was still in the hat, and Greasy Neale of the Philadelphia Eagles and Lambeau were left to decide which was to be the lucky coach. You guessed it. Neale missed, and Holovak became Green Bay property. The owners even joined in Lambeau's merriment on this occasion. They knew they had been taken for a ride, but it was such a boomerang on Halas they almost enjoyed the sensation.\"\n\nWAR WORK SUGGESTED FOR PACKER GRIDDERS\n\nMAY 4 (Green Bay) - Coach Curly Lambeau of the Green Bay Packers threw a little more light on the 1943 professional football setup at a luncheon meeting of the Kiwanis club Monday noon, with these statements: (1) Packer football will play a definite part in the morale of the city of Green Bay and war factories of northeastern Wisconsin; (2) Packer players may be given jobs in war industries here or in nearby communities; (3) Practice may be held late in the afternoon after the gridders finish war work; (4) The Packers feel it their duty to go ahead and operate pro football as a morale builder here as well as in other National league cities; (5) Professional football asks no deferments for its players. Under work or fight orders, Lambeau expressed the opinion that player may have to start their eight-hour war work day at 7 o'clock in the morning and practice after work. He recalled that the oldtimers played and worked at the same time, and saw no reason why the present crop of players could not do the same...MANPOWER BIG PROBLEM: The coach admitted that manpower is the biggest problem of the league teams, but quickly added that there are still 200 or 250 players available for action on the gridirons. Discussing the league teams, Lambeau explained that there is a possibility that the circuit may operate with six clubs last fall - Green Bay, New York, Washington, Detroit, the Chicago Bears and a combination of the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh clubs. He pointed out that Cleveland \"did right in disbanding for the duration because both of the Ram owners are in service.\" With six or nine clubs operating, Lambeau stated that the Packers will have an attractive home schedule to offer fans of Wisconsin since New York and Washington, the top clubs of the Eastern division, are due in Packerland. In the even six teams play, a home-and-home schedule will be worked out...FREE SUBSTITUTION AID: Adoption of the new free substitution rule was described by Lambeau as an important move by the league. \"Boys like Hutson and Isbell and a host of others who are experts on offense can be rested while we are on defense. Then, too, lads who are new to the game or have some offensive or defensive handicap can be drilled in one or the other department of play.\" Lambeau announced that Chet Adams, the Cleveland Ram ace who was picked out of a hat when Cleveland quit, will be able to play with Green Bay - \"if there are no further developments\". Adams is married and wants to play next fall, he added. Looking over prospects for next year, Lambeau said he expects to open with a right end - \"something we didn't have last year\". Harry Jacunski, rejected by the navy and the father of two children, will be at right end, with Hutson at left. The tackles will be similar to last year with the addition of Adams being the only real change. The coach failed to make a definite prediction for guard or center but said that Charley Brock may not return. Buckets Goldenberg will \"help us considerably if he decides to play\". Guards lost include Pete Tinsley, Fred Vant Hull and Russ Letlow...FRISTCH AT FULL: Of the 1942 backfield, only Tony Canadeo and Chuck Sample, halfback and fullback, respectively, are lost to service. Stepping in at fullback will be Ted Fritsch, the Stevens Point flash who has been placed in 4-F. After Lambeau's talk, the official Packer film, \"Packer Highlights of 1942\", was shown. Among interesting scenes were Charley Brock's steal of the ball and his ensuing touchdown run, the disputed out-of-bounds play during the first Bear game here last fall; and the spectacular pas catching of Don Hutson. In fact, the entire show was dotted with Isbell-Hutson aerials. The disputed play involved Andy Uram, who took a pass from Cecil Isbell on about the Bear 35-yard line and ran down the sidelines for a touchdown. The referee ruled that Uram stepped out on the 20. The picture, however, showed that Uram did not step out. The Kiwanians let out a mighty \"NO\" when Lambeau asked: \"Did he step out?\" The particular shot was run backwards and in slow motion.\n\nURGE CONTINUATION OF SPORTING EVENTS\n\nMAY 21 (Two Rivers) - Football and other sports should continue if at all possible, Cecil Isbell, ace passer of the Green Bay Packers told members of the Junior Chamber of Commerce last night at their installation dinner in he banquet room of the J.E. Hamilton Community house. The famed football star told the membership and guests that sports is \"one of the greatest morale builders civilians and service men have\" and cited several instances of how the boys in service await with interest results of sporting events in this country.\n\nPRO FOOTBALL TEAMS CONSIDER CONSOLIDATIONS FOR NEXT FALL\n\nJUN 9 (Pittsburgh) - NFL teams, struggling to keep going despite increasingly acute manpower shortages, may turn to consolidations that would produce a six or seven team league next fall. That possibility was suggested today by Art Rooney, co-owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, who pointed out that only four of the 10 teams in the league last fall have announced they will operate this year. The others are definitely out or doubtful starters. Rooney listed his own team and the Philadelphia Eagles in the doubtful class. \"Understand,\" he said, \"we're going to make every effort to put a Steeler team on the field. But the outlook is not too good. If we can't round up enough men, we're going to ask about a merger with the Eagles. Perhaps the two Chicago teams may also want to merge.\" A spokesman for the Eagles said at Philadelphia that the consolidation \"has been discussed\" but added that the final decision is being withheld until the league meeting in Chicago June 19. He said the Eagles have a maximum possible total of 14 players available and \"couldn't begin to field a team now.\" Rooney reported only five holdovers from last year's great Steeler club available for this season. Aggravating the manpower shortage is the fact that most of the 1942 college stars, who normally would fill the gaps in the league roster, already are in the armed forces. The Eagles, for instance, selected 30 players at the league draft meeting and not one will be available this year. As to the Chicago merger, Rooney said he understood both the Bears and Cardinals, in addition to loss of their regular coaches, face acute player shortages. Brooklyn, too, has been hit hard. The Cleveland Rams have announced they definitely will not operate. Only the champion Washington Redskins, Green Bay, New York and Detroit have declared they are ready to operate next fall.\n\nLAYDEN HOLDS OPTIMISTIC VIEW FOR PRO LEAGUE\n\n​JUN 14 (Chicago) - Pointing to the success of baseball as a pattern for the future, Elmer Layden, commissioner of the NFL, said today he was confident the nine club owners who last April pledged themselves to carry on would go ahead with their 1943 plans after a league meeting in Chicago Saturday and Sunday.
