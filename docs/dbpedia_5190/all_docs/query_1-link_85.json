        "text": "Dave,\n\nI came up with a nice story about my fictional route.\n\nThe Enfield and Eastern Railroad\n\nI don't have any good pictures yet, but my Enfield and Eastern, is located in the eastern portion of New England. What we have today is a far cry from what the original company was when it was originally formed in the early 1830s.\n\nIn 1640 the settlers founded the small village of North Amerhill, which is located on what is now known as the Enfield River. The great falls at this location supplied the Native Americans with fish and the settlers found the falls to be perfect site for their grist mills. The area was very prosperous, and during the 1750s, numerous grist mills were in operation. The river also became quite an important transportation route as the area was located quite a distance away from the more populous coastline.\n\nIn 1828, George Enfield built the first textile mill. He used the water as power for his mill, and his business became quite successful. By 1831 other mills had been built in the same area. The river supplied both power for the mills and transportation of the finished goods to the sea port at Eastport. As time went on, other business entrepreneurs built their own textile factories, and due to the increase in mills, there were now problems with the transportation of goods. The skiff operators had to battle constantly with low water during the summer months as the mills drew off the water to power their equipment. Eventually fights broke out amongst the mill owners and the shippers, and nothing was being transported anywhere. The local economy started to suffer as the mills ran out of raw materials, and anything that was transported, had to go on a very long and difficult overland journey.\n\nLate in 1831 and early 1832, the discussion started about building a railroad from Enfield to the seaport of Eastport, which is located about 65 miles way. Work started immediately on the surveying for the route, and money was raised from the different towns, which became stock holders in the new railroad. The new rail company ran its first trains as far as Wrentham in mid-1834.\n\nThe Enfield Railroad, which it finally became known as, changed its name numerous times as it reached the different towns along the route, and even changed from Railway to finally Railroad at the end. By 1838 the new \"railroad\" finally reached Eastport, which was the final destination of this line. The original Enfield line followed the former tow path that ran along the river in the valley. The rail line bypassed the major cities along the way, but none the less did quite wells as it supplied services to the smaller towns such as Factoryville, Brimley, and Franklin Mills on its short branch that ran up that way.\n\nIn 1845 the Boston & Maine built its line to Eastport. They ran their line up on bluff above the river, and connected the major cities such as Pembroke, Wrentham, Acton, Bowman, and Eastport. The original Enfield Railroad never built a main passenger terminal like the B&M did, but shared the terminal with the B&M. During this time, the two companies coexisted nicely and interchanged traffic at different points along the way. The B&M even supplied passenger service to Factoryville and Brimley along the old River Line. A branch was also built to Willows Point. This line served the shoe mills at Devereaux, and the residents out on the point with commuter service to Eastport. The venerable B&M also had the advantage too of connecting the more genteel towns of Parkdale, Cottage Hill, and Radford. These towns had commuters that traveled to both Eastport and Boston. By 1885 the B&M had merged in the operations of the old Enfield RR as it swallowed up numerous other short lines in New England. The ERR became the River Line, which it is still known as today, while the original B&M became the Eastport Branch.\n\nEastport is located out on a cape just above Cape Ann between Plum Island and Seabrook, New Hampshire. The Merrimack River is on one side with the Enfield River on the more southern end. This cape forms a safe quiet harbor that is protected from the storms that hit the area during the winter months. The service along these lines was quite successful as the B&M transported commuters and goods to and from Eastport, Boston and other points west and north. They also built an interchange at Ipswich Junction where the line crossed the former Eastern Railroad, which by 1888 was now controlled 100% by the B&M.\n\nThe line was double-tracked over much of the route during the 1890s as the New Haven had gained control of the B&M. Like other parts of the New Haven, there were plans to electrify the system but this never came about. The panic of 1910 put the system into bankruptcy. JP Morgan had caused problems with his illegal stock manipulation schemes and this caused the panic. The bankruptcy lasted until just after WW1, and the boom times of the 1920s brought some prosperity back to the area once again. By 1925 the system was back on its feet after trimming a few shorter and less profitable lines in and around South Acton, Wrentham, and Acton.\n\nLike other railroads in the country, the Great Depression took its toll on the service. There were some more branch trimmings around Acton and Wrentham this time, but the service boomed again during WWII as the mills were supplying textiles and shoes to the troops during the war. This uptick in manufacturing and shipping took its toll on the rail infrastructure, and sections were rebuilt and a few were single tracked. The system continued to operate quite successfully up through the 1950s, but as the mills closed one by one, when the original purpose of the rail lines ceased, the freight service was cut back to a less frequent basis. By this time, the lines handled more incoming than outgoing goods, and were mostly there to serve as commuter lines rather than freight lines.\n\nIn the 1970s, the lines still hosted a daily 5-days’ per week freights and daily commuter service. The passenger service was now handled by the MBTA, but run by the B&M. The passenger trains were now RDCs instead of locomotive hauled, but they served the purpose quite well. The old Willows Point branch was still successful as well, with a local based out there on the point with its 5-day freight operation as well.\n\nIn 1982 Guilford Transportation took over. This spelled the beginning of the end of New England rail operations as we know it. Immediately they caused a strike as they busted the unions, and changed the number of crew members on the trains. They also went through great lengths to discourage freight service on the branch lines. What was once a daily except for weekend service to Eastport and Willows Point became once a week if needed. The as needed freight became once a month single train that took all day and then some to travel to Willows Point due to the poor track conditions. The lines became so weeded over with small trees growing out of the sidings, and there were frequent derailments as rails collapsed under the weight of standing trains. The yards were mostly ripped up now since there was no use for any car storage. The only good track was that to Eastport because it was owned by the MBTA for commuter service.\n\nBy 1989 GTI wanted out, and threatened to cancel all freight service on the route. The residents, who had been fighting the declining service for years wanted to run the lines themselves. Over the years, GTI was brought to court, but nothing was done to improve service. In 1992 a stalemate was broken after a state judge ordered the company to give up and either operate the service, or let someone else take over. Surprisingly they let someone else take over.\n\nIn 1994, the Enfield and Eastern was born. This little company, which inherited a broken down system with lots of rusty tracks, and an amalgamation of different locomotives, started running trains again. Initially the service was as needed, just as GTI had left it, but as time has gone on, the freight service is coming back albeit slowly and steadily. It will never be at the pre-Guilford, or the pre-1950s levels, but there will be some service on the line.\n\nIn late 2005, the Enfield and Eastern became the designated operator of additional Guilford lines including former Plymouth and Bristol. These lines are part of the Maine Division, which runs up the coast from Newburyport along the former Eastern Railroad as far as Portland Maine, and consists of some smaller, but separated branches such as the Plymouth and Bristol and Bristol and Sandy Point.\n\nRecently passenger service has been increasing almost to the point where it was prior to the Guilford takeover, and much credit can be given to GEPTA and GPTA (Greater Eastport Transit Authority and Greater Plymouth Transit Authority) as well as the MBTA (Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority) and of course Amtrak. There is through service from Enfield to Boston as well as trains from Bristol to Boston and Eastport.\n\nAs said before, the freight service has been a bit slower coming back, but it has been on a slow and, steady basis. The freight carried today, on the original line, is no longer textiles. Instead it includes, sand, gravel, coal, manufactured goods, plastic pellets, fish, poultry, livestock, and beer from a brewery that is on the line. On the Maine Division, an Enfield and Eastern subsidiary the South Bristol Industrial serves a large industrial park located just outside of Bristol. Located \"in the woods\", is a large number of plastics and other manufacturing companies as well as a recently relocated ethanol refinery.\n\nThe equipment used is an eclectic selection of diesels ranging from some older RS3s and other switchers to some Geeps and GEVOs purchased from Guilford, CSX, Norfolk Southern, and Conrail. The passenger equipment is from the MBTA and Amtrak.\n\nJC, what a very cool story, well done. I felt as though I was reading the story of a real railroad! I feel this is what gives a fictional railroad it's soul. I think your story contains a rich history and paints a picture of the railroads brightest and darkest days but still shows signs of a new life in the present day. It would be nice to see a timeline in pictures of the railroad but doing the same on my route would be a lot of work. Still it would be cool to see some early steamers working in the early days of the L&A.\n\nIn writing my route's history/story I can keep my route in focus so it can maintain it's proper feel. When you see my screen shots you will see a railroad struggling to stay alive and maintain its identity faced with the fact it has to get by on hand me down locomotives and rolling stock. Still the Levi shops are renowned for making a silk purse out of a sows ear out of any locomotive that shows up in the shops\n\nI sincerely hope others write about they're routes, be it past or present. This is the beauty of our hobby; a chance to express our imagination to not only ourselves but to share it with others.\n\nDave\n\nYou're welcome, Dave!\n\nI too find that a convincing story helps keep the focus on the railroad's purpose, and sets the tone of what it will look like. This I find is very important because it sets the difference between a model railroad and the real deal.\n\nI tried to capture a real railroad here, and in some ways this is true history. In the Blackstone Valley, which runs in the Worcester - Providence region, the mill owners did go to battle with the Blackstone Canal operators during the early days. In fact it was because of this that the current Providence and Worcester RR was born. Later on they were a stepchild of the New Haven, but split just as the Penn Central came along, and have survived very nicely since then.\n\nGuilford too is/was not such a nice company, and did cause a massive strike on the B&M, MEC, and the then recently included D&H during the mid-1980s. Sadly this forced many businesses away from rails, and the D&H ended up insolvent. The state of Maine brought Guilford to court many times, and recently the Maine Eastern has now taken over operations up through Augusta. The good news is they are running passenger service up there once Amtrak makes it to Brunswick, ME. The Maine Eastern is a former MEC branch line, and they have done a nice job hauling cement, lime, plastics, steel, and lumber. At some point, I hope to merge in the DEM I'm working on with my route. There will be an interchange setup with the ME, and this will be run as a separate railroad.\n\nI've also made up sections of my route where there isn't quite a plausible connection, but it can exist by using a merged section like going from Wrentham to Bristol. This is the recently acquired Mountain Division. This was actually a merger of the L&N River Sub by Fireball. The route required quite a bit of reworking, replacing and updating, but the terrain fit perfectly with New England even though it took place 900-plus miles south. By replacing hardwoods with pines, I've turned Kentucky into New Hampshire. It wasn't quite as easy as that, but it does look pretty convincing. My dad saw the route the other day when I was driving and thought it was northwestern New Hampshire up near Whitefield and Colebrooke.\n\nThe town names are real, but come from various parts of New England whether they're in Vermont, New Hampshire, Mass., Maine, or even Connecticut. If I hear or see a name I like, I write it down for later. I've added quite a few this way just by looking at maps.\n\nYour idea of backdating sounds great, but I agree that would be way too much work. Perhaps this could be done on one section just for photography purposes. I could picture some nicely framed black and white shots of some old steamers pulling the varnish into one of the stations.\n\nI look forward to seeing your pictures. Your route sounds really cool.\n\nJohn\n\nHere's a little more imagineering... The Sandy Point Branch of my Enfield and Eastern.\n\nPRNews Wire: (Eastport, Bristol, 12/24/2011) The Enfield and Eastern Announces a new addition to its stable of short lines.\n\nThe Enfield and Eastern, a successful operator of short line railroads and its own operations in the New England region, announces today that the company has officially been appointed designated freight operator of the former Maine Central branch from Sandy Point to Bristol. The company said it will operate the Sandy Point line as an integrated operation on an as needed basis with its own nearby South Bristol Industrial, and plans to attract businesses to the area.\n\nAbout the Sandy Point Branch:\n\nThe Sandy Point branch is a new addition to the Enfield and Eastern. This line was initially built as the Sandy Point and Bristol and ran under wires as an interurban. The line flourished during the early 20th century primarily with its tourist trains out to the point. The Maine Central purchased the line in 1922, and the line was converted to steam operation then. There was some work done during this time to realign some of the route away from the water’s edge and to improve the grades, which were too steep for running steam, but fine for much lighter electric operation. As time went on, the branch soldiered on with less and less traffic, and passenger service was officially terminated in 1950 as the automobile took away the passenger service, and the LCL freight moved to trucks. The Maine Central still served this branch with a daily from Bristol freight, which in the latter years, consisted of perhaps no more than a car or two, sometimes more during the summer, when the fishing industry is at its highest peak. During the 1970s there was talk off and on of restarting passenger service to Bristol, but that never happened. The station rotted away and was torched during the early 1980s vandals. The hulk sat there boarded up and forgotten beside the tracks that were more grass than freight cars. When Guilford took over during the early 1980s, the company petitioned to abandon the line, however their petition was denied. They continued to operate the line with less and less maintenance until a washout occurred during a Nor’easter. The company then embargoed the operations and then petitioned again to abandon the line. This time the petition was granted, and the State of Maine purchased the ROW.\n\nIn more recent times, the area has seen a boom in tourist business with its beautiful location along the river, and its attractive Georgian brick buildings making up a bulk of the town. As the town reinvented its self from a fishing village to tourist maven, a group of locals formed a tourist railroad. This line initially ran to where the washout occurred, and returned. The power was that used by the nearly defunct Sandy Point Industrial along with some old rebuilt (actually just repainted) passenger cars). The service was quite successful, and saved the line from becoming a rail trail. With the successful tourist operation, the state provided funds to repair the washout so service could continue to Bristol. Today in conjunction with the Greater Plymouth Transit Authority (GPTA), Amtrak provides passenger cars and locomotives for passenger service between Sandy Point, Bristol, and Plymouth. The total trip time is about 50 minutes between Plymouth and Sandy Point. At this point there are no plans for passenger service further than Plymouth, although discussions have taken place off and on about extending service to Laurel Valley and to Enfield. This plan however would require rebuilding a long abandoned connecting branch from Sandy Point Junction to the Bristol-Lynnwood-Wrentham main line, also known as the “Mountain Division”.\n\nToday the Sandy Point Branch exists primarily as a passenger connection to Bristol. There are still some seasonal freight operations in and around the seafront area, with the fishing and fish processing industry being the primary business on the line, and is handled by an interchange at Sandy Point with the Sandy Point Industrial. At this time, there are no other online industries on this branch, making Sandy Point the only freight destination however there are ongoing efforts to attract new freight business.\n\nAbout the Enfield and Eastern:\n\nThe Enfield and Eastern runs numerous short line operations in addition to its own lines. These smaller companies are scattered throughout the region and are responsible for much of the smaller switching and terminal operations for the parent company. These short lines, like the Enfield and Eastern, operates various equipment from many manufacturers. The youngest locomotives are around 45 years old, and the oldest around 60. The E&E operates primarily EMD power with a smattering of ALCO here and there. Sadly the ALCOs are disappearing as they age and the parts are more difficult to get. The mainline locomotives consist of GP38s and GP40s purchased on the used market from Conrail and other operators in the northeast. Recently there has been an introduction of pooled power from CSX and Norfolk and Southern, which also operate run through coal trains to the various power plants along the line.\n\nThis regional rail service handles a variety of freight ranging from food products, plastics, and chemicals to gravel. In the greater Bristol area, the rail line handles warehousing and logistics services for regional trucking companies, scrap metal, plastics, biofuel, manufactured goods, gravel, and sand with service provided by its wholly-owned subsidiary, the South Bristol Industrial Railroad.\n\nOn Friday, just prior to this announcement, the E&E common stock closed at $22.80 per share with 20,000,000 shares still outstanding. A majority of shares are owned and controlled by company officers. The company recently reported pre-tax profit of $12 million (GAAP), and posted a dividend of $0.02 per share. This statement is presented under the Safe Harbors Act of 1938, and reflects current financial standings, and do not reflect future financial liability or stability of the operation. Past performance does not guarantee future results."
