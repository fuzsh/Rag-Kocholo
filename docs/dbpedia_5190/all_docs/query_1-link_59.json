ACTION: Final rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or we) prescribes final late-season frameworks from which States may select season dates, limits, and other options for the 2011-12 migratory bird hunting seasons. These late seasons include most waterfowl seasons, the earliest of which commences on September 24, 2011. The effect of this final rule is to facilitate the States' selection of hunting seasons and to further the annual establishment of the late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. DATES: This rule takes effect on September 21, 2011. ADDRESSES: States should send their season selections to: Chief, Division of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, ms MBSP-4107-ARLSQ, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240. You may inspect comments received on the migratory bird hunting regulations during normal business hours at the Service's office in room 4107, Arlington Square Building, 4501 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA. You may obtain copies of referenced reports from the street address above, or from the Division of Migratory Bird Management's Web site at http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/, or at http://www.regulations.gov at Docket No. FWS-R9-MB-2011-0014. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ron W. Kokel, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, MS MBSP-4107-ARLSQ, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240; (703) 358-1714. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations Schedule for 2011 On April 8, 2011, we published in the Federal Register (76 FR 19876) a proposal to amend 50 CFR part 20. The proposal provided a background and overview of the migratory bird hunting regulations process, and addressed the establishment of seasons, limits, and other regulations for hunting migratory game birds under Sec. Sec. 20.101 through 20.107, 20.109, and 20.110 of subpart K. Major steps in the 2011-12 regulatory cycle relating to open public meetings and Federal Register notifications were also identified in the April 8 proposed rule. Further, we explained that all sections of subsequent documents outlining hunting frameworks and guidelines were organized under numbered headings. On June 22, 2011, we published in the Federal Register (76 FR 36508) a second document providing supplemental proposals for early- and late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. The June 22 supplement also provided detailed information on the 2011-12 regulatory schedule and announced the Service Regulations Committee (SRC) and Flyway Council meetings. On June 22 and 23, 2011, we held open meetings with the Flyway Council Consultants at which the participants reviewed information on the current status of migratory shore and upland game birds and developed recommendations for the 2011-12 regulations for these species plus regulations for migratory game birds in Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands; special September waterfowl seasons in designated States; special sea duck seasons in the Atlantic Flyway; and extended falconry seasons. In addition, we reviewed and discussed preliminary information on the status of waterfowl as it relates to the development and selection of the regulatory packages for the 2011-12 regular waterfowl seasons. On July 26, 2011, we published in the Federal Register (76 FR 44730) a third document specifically dealing with the proposed frameworks for early-season regulations. On August 30, 2011, we published in the Federal Register (76 FR 54052) a final rule which contained final frameworks for early migratory bird hunting seasons from which wildlife conservation agency officials from the States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands selected early-season hunting dates, hours, areas, and limits. Subsequently, on September 1, 2011, we published a final rule in the Federal Register (76 FR 54658) amending subpart K of title 50 CFR part 20 to set hunting seasons, hours, areas, and limits for early seasons. On July 27-28, 2011, we held open meetings with the Flyway Council Consultants at which the participants reviewed the status of waterfowl and developed recommendations for the 2011-12 regulations for these species. Proposed hunting regulations were discussed for late seasons. On August 26, 2011, we published in the Federal Register (76 FR 53536) the proposed frameworks for the 2011-12 late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. This document establishes final frameworks for late-season migratory bird hunting regulations for the 2011-12 season. There are no substantive changes from the August 26 proposed rule. We will publish State selections in the Federal Register as amendments to Sec. Sec. 20.101 through 20.107, and 20.109 of title 50 CFR part 20. Population Status and Harvest The following paragraphs provide preliminary information on the status of waterfowl and information on the status and harvest of migratory shore and upland game birds excerpted from various reports. For more detailed information on methodologies and results, you may obtain complete copies of the various reports at the address indicated under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT or from our Web site at http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/NewsPublicationsReports.html. Review of Public Comments and Flyway Council Recommendations The preliminary proposed rulemaking, which appeared in the April 8, 2011, Federal Register, opened the public comment period for migratory game bird hunting regulations. The supplemental proposed rule, which appeared in the June 22, 2011, Federal Register, discussed the regulatory alternatives for the 2011-12 duck hunting season. Late- season comments are summarized below and numbered in the order used in the April 8 and June 22 Federal Register documents. We have included only the numbered items pertaining to late-season issues for which we received written comments. Consequently, the issues do not follow in successive numerical or alphabetical order. We received recommendations from all four Flyway Councils. Some recommendations supported continuation of last year's frameworks. Due to the comprehensive nature of the annual review of the frameworks performed by the Councils, support for continuation of last year's frameworks is assumed for items for which no recommendations were received. Council recommendations for changes in the frameworks are summarized below. Wherever possible, they are discussed under headings corresponding to the numbered items in the April 8 and June 22, 2011, Federal Register documents. [[Page 58683]] 1. Ducks Categories used to discuss issues related to duck harvest management are: (A) Harvest Strategy Considerations, (B) Regulatory Alternatives, (C) Zones and Split Seasons, and (D) Special Seasons/ Species Management. The categories correspond to previously published issues/discussion, and only those containing substantial recommendations are discussed below. A. Harvest Strategy Considerations Council Recommendations: The Atlantic, Central, and Pacific Flyway Councils and the Upper- and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended the adoption of the ``liberal'' regulatory alternative. Service Response: We continue to use Adaptive Harvest Management (AHM) protocols that allow hunting regulations to vary among Flyways in a manner that recognizes each Flyway's unique breeding-ground derivation of mallards. In 2008, we described and adopted a protocol for regulatory decision-making for the newly defined stock of western mallards (73 FR 43290; July 24, 2008). For the 2011 hunting season, we continue to believe that the prescribed regulatory choice for the Pacific Flyway should be based on the status of this western mallard breeding stock, while the regulatory choice for the Mississippi and Central Flyways should depend on the status of the recently redefined mid-continent mallard stock. We also recommend that the regulatory choice for the Atlantic Flyway continue to depend on the status of eastern mallards. For the 2011 hunting season, we are continuing to consider the same regulatory alternatives as those used last year. The nature of the ``restrictive,'' ``moderate,'' and ``liberal'' alternatives has remained essentially unchanged since 1997, except that extended framework dates have been offered in the ``moderate'' and ``liberal'' regulatory alternatives since 2002. Also, in 2003, we agreed to place a constraint on closed seasons in the Mississippi and Central Flyways whenever the midcontinent mallard breeding-population size (as defined prior to 2008; traditional survey area plus Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin) was >= 5.5 million. Optimal AHM strategies for the 2011-12 hunting season were calculated using: (1) Harvest-management objectives specific to each mallard stock; (2) the 2011 regulatory alternatives; and (3) current population models and associated weights for midcontinent, western, and eastern mallards. Based on this year's survey results of 9.46 million midcontinent mallards (traditional survey area minus Alaska plus Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan), 4.89 million ponds in Prairie Canada, 798,413 western mallards (382,588 and 415,825 respectively in California-Oregon and Alaska) and 746,000 eastern mallards (strata 51- 54, 56 and the northeastern United States), the prescribed regulatory choice for all four Flyways is the ``liberal'' alternative. Therefore, we concur with the recommendations of the Atlantic, Mississippi, Central, and Pacific Flyway Councils regarding selection of the ``liberal'' regulatory alternative and will adopt the ``liberal'' regulatory alternative, as described in the June 22, 2011, Federal Register. D. Special Seasons/Species Management iii. Black Ducks In 2008, U.S. and Canadian waterfowl managers developed an interim harvest strategy that will be employed by both countries until a formal strategy based on the principles of AHM is completed. We detailed this interim strategy in the July 24, 2008, Federal Register (73 FR 43290). The interim harvest strategy is prescriptive, in that it calls for no substantive changes in hunting regulations unless the black duck breeding population, averaged over the most recent 3 years, exceeds or falls below the long-term average breeding population by 15 percent or more. The strategy is designed to share the black duck harvest equally between the two countries; however, recognizing incomplete control of harvest through regulations, it will allow realized harvest in either country to vary between 40 and 60 percent. Each year in November, Canada publishes its proposed migratory bird hunting regulations for the upcoming hunting season. Thus, last fall the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) used the interim strategy to establish its proposed black duck regulations for the 2011-12 season, based on the most current data available at that time: breeding population estimates for 2008, 2009, and 2010, and an assessment of parity based on harvest estimates for the 2005-09 hunting seasons. Although updates of both breeding population estimates and harvest estimates are now available, the United States will base its 2011-12 black duck regulations on the same data CWS used, to ensure comparable application of the strategy. The long-term (1998-2007) breeding population mean estimate is 929,100, and the 2008-10, 3-year running mean estimate is 858,300. From 2005-09, 45 percent of the black duck harvest occurred in Canada and 55 percent in the United States; this falls within the accepted parity bounds of 40 and 60 percent. Based on these estimates, no restriction or liberalization of black duck harvest is warranted. iv. Canvasbacks Council Recommendations: The Atlantic, Central, and Pacific Flyway Councils and the Upper- and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended a full season for canvasbacks with a 1-bird daily bag limit. Season lengths would be 60 days in the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways, 74 days in the Central Flyway, and 107 days in the Pacific Flyway. Service Response: Since 1994, we have followed a canvasback harvest strategy that if canvasback population status and production are sufficient to permit a harvest of one canvasback per day nationwide for the entire length of the regular duck season, while still attaining a projected spring population objective of 500,000 birds, the season on canvasbacks should be opened. A partial season would be permitted if the estimated allowable harvest was within the projected harvest for a shortened season. If neither of these conditions can be met, the harvest strategy calls for a closed season on canvasbacks nationwide. In 2008 (73 FR 43290; July 24, 2008), we announced our decision to modify the Canvasback Harvest Strategy to incorporate the option for a 2-bird daily bag limit for canvasbacks when the predicted breeding population the subsequent year exceeds 725,000 birds. This year's spring survey resulted in an estimate of 692,000 canvasbacks. This was statistically similar to the 2010 estimate of 585,000 canvasbacks and 21 percent above the 1955-2010 average. The estimate of ponds in Prairie Canada was 4.9 million, which was 31 percent above last year and 43 percent above the long-term average. Based on updated harvest predictions using data from recent hunting seasons, the canvasback harvest strategy predicts a 2012 canvasback population of 756,000 birds under a liberal duck season with a 1-bird daily bag limit and 697,000 with a 2-bird daily bag limit. Because the predicted 2012 population under the 1-bird daily bag limit is greater than 500,000, while the prediction under the 2-bird daily bag limit is less than 725,000, the canvasback harvest strategy stipulates a full canvasback season with a 1-bird daily bag limit for the upcoming season. [[Page 58684]] v. Pintails Council Recommendations: The Atlantic, Central, and Pacific Flyway Councils and the Upper- and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended a full season for pintails, consisting of a 2-bird daily bag limit and a 60-day season in the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways, a 74-day season in the Central Flyway, and a 107-day season in the Pacific Flyway. Service Response: The current derived pintail harvest strategy was adopted by the Service and Flyway Councils in 2010 (75 FR 44856; July 29, 2010). For this year, optimal regulatory strategies were calculated with: (1) An objective of maximizing long-term cumulative harvest, including a closed-season constraint of 1.75 million birds, (2) the regulatory alternatives and associated predicted harvest, and (3) current population models and their relative weights. Based on this year's survey results of 4.43 million pintails observed and a mean latitude of 51.7 for the breeding population, the optimal regulatory choice for all four Flyways is the ``liberal'' alternative with a 2- bird daily bag limit. vi. Scaup Council Recommendations: The Atlantic, Central, and Pacific Flyway Councils and the Upper- and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended use of the ``moderate'' regulation package, consisting of a 60-day season with a 2-bird daily bag in the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways, a 74-day season with a 2- bird daily bag limit in the Central Flyway, and an 86-day season with a 3-bird daily bag limit in the Pacific Flyway. Service Response: In 2008, we adopted and implemented a new scaup harvest strategy (73 FR 43290 on July 24, 2008, and 73 FR 51124 on August 29, 2008) with initial ``restrictive,'' ``moderate,'' and ``liberal'' regulatory packages adopted for each Flyway. Further opportunity to revise these packages was afforded prior to the 2009-10 season and modifications by the Mississippi and Central Flyway Councils were endorsed by the Service in July 2009 (74 FR 36870; July 24, 2009). These packages will remain in effect for at least 3 years prior to their re-evaluation. The 2011 breeding population estimate for scaup is 4.32 million, up 2 percent from, but statistically similar to, the 2010 estimate of 4.24 million. Total estimated scaup harvest for the 2010-11 season was 358,000 birds. Based on updated model parameter estimates, the optimal regulatory choice for scaup is the ``moderate'' package in all four Flyways. vii. Mottled Ducks Council Recommendations: The Central Flyway Council recommended removal of the restriction in Texas requiring a 5-day delay in the opening date of the mottled duck season from the opening of the general duck season (i.e., must be closed the first 5 days of the duck season). Service Response: We remain concerned about the status of mottled ducks, particularly those in the Western Gulf Coast Population (WGCP). In 2009, the Central and Mississippi Flyways implemented restrictions in either bag limit or season length in an attempt to achieve harvest reductions we believed were appropriate given the status of those mottled ducks. In the Central Flyway, the restrictions included a delay of 5 days in the opening date when dusky ducks (mottled duck, black duck and their hybrids, or Mexican-like duck) may be taken in Texas. Although the harvest estimates associated with those restrictions did not achieve the targeted 30 percent reduction, the reduction approached what we believed was appropriate for the current status of the WGCP. Therefore, we do not support removal of this restriction and believe that regulations in effect for the last two hunting seasons are appropriate for the 2011-12 season, including the delay in the opening date in which dusky ducks may be taken in Texas. xii. Other Council Recommendations: The Central Flyway Council and the Upper- Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that the daily and possession bag limits for redheads during the 2011-12 duck hunting season be 3 and 6, respectively. Service Response: While we recognize the desire to provide additional hunting opportunity for redheads, at this time we do not support the recommendations to increase the daily bag limit of redheads from 2 to 3 birds. As we have done with other species (such as canvasbacks, pintails, etc.), we believe that changes to redhead daily bag limits should only be considered with guidance from an agreed-upon harvest strategy that is supported by all four Flyway Councils and the Service. Thus, we suggest that the Flyways work collaboratively to develop a redhead harvest strategy, which would include: (1) Clearly defined and agreed-upon management objectives; (2) clearly defined regulatory alternatives; and (3) a model that can be used to predict population responses to harvest mortality. If the development of a harvest strategy for redheads is a priority for the Flyways, a conceptual framework for a redhead harvest strategy could be discussed at the Harvest Management Working Group meeting in November 2011. However, we note that if the Flyway Councils wish to implement a redhead harvest strategy for the 2012-13 season, a draft strategy needs to be available for review and discussion by the February 2012 SRC meeting, finalized by the Flyways Councils at their March 2012 meetings, and forwarded as a recommendation for SRC consideration at the early season SRC meeting (June 2012). 4. Canada Geese B. Regular Seasons Council Recommendations: The Central Flyway Council recommended increasing the Canada goose daily bag limit from 3 to 5 geese in the east-tier States. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended several changes to dark goose season frameworks. More specifically, they recommended: 1. Within the basic dark goose bag limit for California, Oregon, and Washington: Remove the dark goose bag limit exception for Oregon of not more than one cackling Canada or Aleutian Canada geese per day. 2. Within the Northwest Special Permit Zone for Oregon: Increase the dark goose bag limit exception of not more than 2 cackling Canada or Aleutian Canada geese per day to not more than 3 cackling Canada or Aleutian Canada geese per day. 3. Within the Tillamook County Management Area of the Northwest Special Permit Zone for Oregon: Increase the dark goose bag limit from not more than 3 per day, including not more than 2 cackling Canada or Aleutian Canada geese, to not more than 4 per day, provided this total include not more than 3 cackling Canada or Aleutian Canada geese. 4. Within the Northwest Zone for Oregon: Restrict the bag limit for cackling Canada and Aleutian Canada geese to not more than 3 cackling Canada or Aleutian Canada geese per day within the overall daily dark goose bag limit of not more than 4 per day. 5. Within the South Coast Zone for Oregon: Remove the dark goose bag limit exception, within the basic dark goose bag limit, of up to 4 cackling Canada and Aleutian Canada geese per day. [[Page 58685]] 6. Within the Southwest Zone for Oregon: Remove the dark goose bag limit exception, within the basic dark goose bag limit, of up to 4 cackling Canada and Aleutian Canada geese per day. 7. In Washington's Areas 2A and 2B (Southwest Quota Zone): Increase the daily bag limit from 2 to 3 cackling geese. 8. In California's Northeastern Zone: Remove the restrictions on small Canada geese (Aleutian and cackling geese). 9. Increase the daily bag limit for Canada geese in the Pacific Flyway portion of Colorado from 3 birds to 4 birds, and possession limit from 6 to 8 birds. 10. In Idaho, consolidate the current goose zones to correspond with duck hunting zones. Service Response: We do not support the Central Flyway Council's recommendation to increase the dark goose daily bag limit in the east- tier States from 3 to 5 geese. While we agree that the Flyway's proposed bag limit increase would likely result in an increased harvest of resident Canada geese (Great Plains Population), there are other Canada goose populations that would also be subjected to additional harvest pressure, including the Tall Grass Prairie (TGP), Western Prairie, and the Eastern Prairie populations. We recognize the continuing problems posed by increasing numbers of resident Canada geese and that migrant populations of Canada geese in the Central Flyway are above objective levels. We also understand the Flyway's desire to provide as much hunting opportunity on these geese as possible, and we share the philosophy that hunting, not control permits, should be the primary tool used to manage populations of game birds. However, we also recognize that hunting is not necessarily the most appropriate or effective tool to address these issues in all areas. Although States have used some of the additional tools provided to them through annual hunting regulations, Statewide Special Canada goose permits, and implementation of the preferred alternative in the Resident Canada Goose Environmental Impact Statement, we believe several of these tools are not being used to the extent available. Thus, we encourage the States to work with Service staff to better identify the most appropriate tool, or tools, for the various situations and conflicts in the affected States. Further, as we stated last year (75 FR 58250; September 23, 2010), we believe that more progress needs to be made regarding monitoring Canada goose populations in east-tier States, as well as collaboration with the Mississippi Flyway regarding impacts to shared goose resources, including progress on a revision to the TGP Population Management Plan. We would consider increasing bag limits in the future if progress is made on these fronts, particularly on the management plan. We support all of the Pacific Flyway goose recommendations. Originally, Oregon's Tillamook County Management Area was established to provide protection for Aleutian Canada geese originating from Semidi Island, Alaska. Modification of the closure area, as proposed by the Council, will reduce the closure area by approximately 22 percent. However, the Council notes that the original closure area included non- goose use areas and the refuge recommended reducing the closure area as the Semidi Island birds do not use the entire closure area. Most of the proposed newly open area constitutes agricultural lands, primarily dairy pastures and hay fields, and opening these lands to goose hunting is expected to help relieve depredations caused by wintering geese. While we expect goose harvest in the Management Area to increase due to this proposed change, harvest will continue to be monitored by check station and goose distribution and collar surveys, focused on Semidi birds. The recommendations for removal of small Canada goose restrictions in eastern Oregon and for 1-bird daily bag limit increases to address agricultural damage issues in Oregon and Washington are not expected to increase harvest of these populations substantially. We believe these populations are at levels that can sustain these minor increases in harvest without jeopardy to their long-term sustainability. However, we note that long-term solutions to agricultural depredation issues will not be completely addressed through harvest regulations and encourage the States of the Pacific Flyway to continue to work to implement the other approaches detailed in the Flyway's Canada goose depredation plan. The removal of within bag limit restrictions on small Canada geese (Aleutian and cackling Canada geese) in California's Northeastern Zone is intended to simplify goose hunting regulations, and we expect little or no increase in harvest. Few, if any, Aleutian geese occur in that portion of California and despite restrictive daily bag limits, the abundance of cackling geese in the Klamath Basin has declined from the tens of thousands in the late 1990s to essentially zero in recent years as cackling goose distribution has shifted northward. However, since that time, the Aleutian Canada goose population has grown from less than 1,000 birds in 1976 to over 110,000 in 2011. Regarding the proposed increase in the daily bag limit in Colorado from 3 to 4 Canada geese, we note that removal of this more restrictive bag limit makes it consistent with most of the remainder of the flyway. Further, population measurement data support an increase in the bag limit as counts from both the spring breeding survey and post-hunting indices have increased over the last 3 years. In Idaho, the recommendation to consolidate the current goose zones to correspond with duck hunting zones is intended to reduce regulatory complexity in State and Federal regulations. We have no issue with this recommendation. C. Special Late Seasons Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended changing Rhode Island's experimental late Canada goose season status to operational. Service Response: We agree with the Council's recommendation to change the status of Rhode Island's late Canada goose season from experimental to operational. Based on band recovery data submitted by the Council, there were no direct recoveries of migrant geese and the special late season meets the established criteria for special Canada goose seasons of < 20 percent migrant harvest. Further, between 1997 and 2011, only 7 banded Canada geese recovered were migrants (all of which were indirect recoveries). 5. White-Fronted Geese Council Recommendations: The Mississippi and Central Flyway Councils recommended that the white-fronted goose season option of a 72-day season be increased to 74 days and the 86-day season option be increased to 88 days. Daily bag limits associated with each season option would remain unchanged. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended extending the latest closing date for white-fronted geese in California's Sacramento Valley Special Management Zone to December 28 and in California's Balance of State Zone to March 10. Service Response: We support the 2-day increase in the season length in the Mississippi and Central Flyways. These increases are consistent with the newly revised management plan for mid-continent white-fronted geese. [[Page 58686]] We also support the Pacific Flyway Council's recommendations to extend the framework closing dates in California's Balance of State Zone and the Sacramento Valley Special Management Area (SMA). In the Balance of State Zone, expanding the framework closing date to March 10 is intended to allow additional hunting opportunity and potentially reduce goose crop depredation complaints. The Council notes that the white-fronted goose population is currently about 700,000 birds and above the population goal of 300,000 birds. In the SMA, extending the closing date to December 28 is expected to increase the harvest of Pacific white-fronted geese while still protecting the less numerous Tule subspecies. Tule greater white-fronted geese currently number approximately 14,578 based on preliminary indirect population estimates. However, over-lapping this relatively small number of Tule geese are burgeoning populations of Pacific greater white-fronted geese within the SMA. The Council estimates that the harvest of Tule geese are low, as determined by measurements of hunter-harvested white- fronted geese at public hunting areas within the SMA; and the range of hunter-harvested adult Tule geese at the public hunt areas in the SMA since 1999 has ranged from a low of 13 (2005-06) to a high of 86 (2000- 01). We agree with the Council's assessment. NEPA Consideration NEPA considerations are covered by the programmatic document ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES 88- 14),'' filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on June 9, 1988. We published a notice of availability in the Federal Register on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582). We published our Record of Decision on August 18, 1988 (53 FR 31341). In addition, an August 1985 environmental assessment entitled ``Guidelines for Migratory Bird Hunting Regulations on Federal Indian Reservations and Ceded Lands'' is available from the address indicated under the caption FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. In a notice published in the September 8, 2005, Federal Register (70 FR 53376), we announced our intent to develop a new Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the migratory bird hunting program. Public scoping meetings were held in the spring of 2006, as detailed in a March 9, 2006, Federal Register (71 FR 12216). We released the draft SEIS on July 9, 2010 (75 FR 39577). The draft SEIS is available either by writing to the address indicated under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT or by viewing our Web site at http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds. Endangered Species Act Consideration Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543; 87 Stat. 884), provides that, ``The Secretary shall review other programs administered by him and utilize such programs in furtherance of the purposes of this Act'' (and) shall ``insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out * * * is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of [critical] habitat. * * *.'' Consequently, we conducted formal consultations to ensure that actions resulting from these regulations would not likely jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitat. Findings from these consultations are included in a biological opinion, which concluded that the regulations are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species. Additionally, these findings may have caused modification of some regulatory measures previously proposed, and the final frameworks reflect any such modifications. Our biological opinions resulting from this section 7 consultation are public documents available for public inspection at the address indicated under ADDRESSES. Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has determined that this rule is significant and has reviewed this rule under Executive Order 12866. OMB bases its determination of regulatory significance upon the following four criteria: (a) Whether the rule will have an annual effect of $100 million or more on the economy or adversely affect an economic sector, productivity, jobs, the environment, or other units of the government. (b) Whether the rule will create inconsistencies with other Federal agencies' actions. (c) Whether the rule will materially affect entitlements, grants, user fees, loan programs, or the rights and obligations of their recipients. (d) Whether the rule raises novel legal or policy issues. An economic analysis was prepared for the 2008-09 season. This analysis was based on data from the 2006 National Hunting and Fishing Survey, the most recent year for which data are available (see discussion in Regulatory Flexibility Act section below). This analysis estimated consumer surplus for three alternatives for duck hunting (estimates for other species are not quantified due to lack of data). The alternatives are (1) Issue restrictive regulations allowing fewer days than those issued during the 2007-08 season, (2) Issue moderate regulations allowing more days than those in alternative 1, and (3) Issue liberal regulations identical to the regulations in the 2007-08 season. For the 2008-09 season, we chose alternative 3, with an estimated consumer surplus across all flyways of $205-$270 million. We also chose alternative 3 for the 2009-10 and the 2010-11 seasons. In the April 8 proposed rule, we proposed no changes to the season frameworks for the 2011-12 season, and as such, we again considered these three alternatives. Population status information discussed in the August 26 proposed rule supported selection of alternative 3 for the 2011-12 season. For these reasons, we have not conducted a new economic analysis, but the 2008-09 analysis is part of the record for this rule and is available at http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/NewReportsPublications/SpecialTopics/SpecialTopics.html#HuntingRegs or at http://www.regulations.gov at Docket No. FWS-R9-MB-2011-0014. Regulatory Flexibility Act The annual migratory bird hunting regulations have a significant economic impact on substantial numbers of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). We analyzed the economic impacts of the annual hunting regulations on small business entities in detail as part of the 1981 cost-benefit analysis. This analysis was revised annually from 1990-95. In 1995, the Service issued a Small Entity Flexibility Analysis (Analysis), which was subsequently updated in 1996, 1998, 2004, and 2008. The primary source of information about hunter expenditures for migratory game bird hunting is the National Hunting and Fishing Survey, which is conducted at 5- year intervals. The 2008 Analysis was based on the 2006 National Hunting and Fishing Survey and the U.S. Department of Commerce's County Business Patterns, from which it was estimated that migratory bird hunters would spend approximately $1.2 billion at small businesses in 2008. Copies of the Analysis are available upon request from the Division of Migratory Bird [[Page 58687]] Management (see ADDRESSES) or from our Web site at http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/NewReportsPublications/SpecialTopics/SpecialTopics.html#HuntingRegs or at http://www.regulations.gov at Docket No. FWS-R9-MB-2011-0014. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act This rule is a major rule under 5 U.S.C. 804(2), the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. For the reasons outlined above, this rule would have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. However, because this rule would establish hunting seasons, we do not plan to defer the effective date under the exemption contained in 5 U.S.C. 808(1). Paperwork Reduction Act We examined these regulations under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The various recordkeeping and reporting requirements imposed under regulations established in 50 CFR part 20, subpart K, are utilized in the formulation of migratory game bird hunting regulations. Specifically, OMB has approved the information collection requirements of our Migratory Bird Surveys and assigned control number 1018-0023 (expires 4/30/2014). This information is used to provide a sampling frame for voluntary national surveys to improve our harvest estimates for all migratory game birds in order to better manage these populations. OMB has also approved the information collection requirements of the Alaska Subsistence Household Survey, an associated voluntary annual household survey used to determine levels of subsistence take in Alaska, and assigned control number 1018-0124 (expires 4/30/2013). A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act We have determined and certify, in compliance with the requirements of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, 2 U.S.C. 1502 et seq., that this rulemaking would not impose a cost of $100 million or more in any given year on local or State government or private entities. Therefore, this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Civil Justice Reform--Executive Order 12988 The Department, in promulgating this rule, has determined that this rule will not unduly burden the judicial system and that it meets the requirements of sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988. Takings Implication Assessment In accordance with Executive Order 12630, this rule, authorized by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, does not have significant takings implications and does not affect any constitutionally protected property rights. This rule would not result in the physical occupancy of property, the physical invasion of property, or the regulatory taking of any property. In fact, these rules would allow hunters to exercise otherwise unavailable privileges and, therefore, reduce restrictions on the use of private and public property. Energy Effects--Executive Order 13211 Executive Order 13211 requires agencies to prepare Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking certain actions. While this rule is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, it is not expected to adversely affect energy supplies, distribution, or use. Therefore, this action is not a significant energy action and no Statement of Energy Effects is required. Government-to-Government Relationship With Tribes In accordance with the President's memorandum of April 29, 1994, ``Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal Governments'' (59 FR 22951), Executive Order 13175, and 512 DM 2, we have evaluated possible effects on Federally-recognized Indian tribes and have determined that there are no effects on Indian trust resources. However, in the April 8 Federal Register, we solicited proposals for special migratory bird hunting regulations for certain Tribes on Federal Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and ceded lands for the 2011-12 migratory bird hunting season. The resulting proposals were contained in a separate August 8, 2011, proposed rule (76 FR 48694). By virtue of these actions, we have consulted with Tribes affected by this rule. Federalism Effects Due to the migratory nature of certain species of birds, the Federal Government has been given responsibility over these species by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We annually prescribe frameworks from which the States make selections regarding the hunting of migratory birds, and we employ guidelines to establish special regulations on Federal Indian reservations and ceded lands. This process preserves the ability of the States and tribes to determine which seasons meet their individual needs. Any State or Indian tribe may be more restrictive than the Federal frameworks at any time. The frameworks are developed in a cooperative process with the States and the Flyway Councils. This process allows States to participate in the development of frameworks from which they will make selections, thereby having an influence on their own regulations. These rules do not have a substantial direct effect on fiscal capacity, change the roles or responsibilities of Federal or State governments, or intrude on State policy or administration. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 13132, these regulations do not have significant federalism effects and do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism summary impact statement. Regulations Promulgation The rulemaking process for migratory game bird hunting must, by its nature, operate under severe time constraints. However, we intend that the public be given the greatest possible opportunity to comment. Thus, when the preliminary proposed rulemaking was published, we established what we believed were the longest periods possible for public comment. In doing this, we recognized that when the comment period closed, time would be of the essence. That is, if there were a delay in the effective date of these regulations after this final rulemaking, States would have insufficient time to select season dates and limits; to communicate those selections to us; and to establish and publicize the necessary regulations and procedures to implement their decisions. We therefore find that ``good cause'' exists, within the terms of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, and these frameworks will, therefore, take effect immediately upon publication. Therefore, under authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (July 3, 1918), as amended (16 U.S.C. 703-711), we prescribe final frameworks setting forth the species to be hunted, the daily bag and possession limits, the shooting hours, the season lengths, the earliest opening and latest closing season dates, and hunting areas, from which State conservation agency officials will select hunting season dates and other options. Upon receipt of season selections from these officials, we will publish a final [[Page 58688]] rulemaking amending 50 CFR part 20 to reflect seasons, limits, and shooting hours for the conterminous United States for the 2011-12 season. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 20 Exports, Hunting, Imports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation, Wildlife. The rules that eventually will be promulgated for the 2011-12 hunting season are authorized under 16 U.S.C. 703-712 and 16 U.S.C. 742 a-j. Dated: September 8, 2011. Eileen Sobeck, Acting Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. Final Regulations Frameworks for 2011-12 Late Hunting Seasons on Certain Migratory Game Birds Pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and delegated authorities, the Department has approved the following frameworks for season lengths, shooting hours, bag and possession limits, and outside dates within which States may select seasons for hunting waterfowl and coots between the dates of September 1, 2011, and March 10, 2012. These frameworks are summarized below. General Dates: All outside dates noted below are inclusive. Shooting and Hawking (taking by falconry) Hours: Unless otherwise specified, from one-half hour before sunrise to sunset daily. Possession Limits: Unless otherwise specified, possession limits are twice the daily bag limit. Permits: For some species of migratory birds, the Service authorizes the use of permits to regulate harvest or monitor their take by sport hunters, or both. In many cases (e.g., tundra swans, some sandhill crane populations), the Service determines the amount of harvest that may be taken during hunting seasons during its formal regulations-setting process, and the States then issue permits to hunters at levels predicted to result in the amount of take authorized by the Service. Thus, although issued by States, the permits would not be valid unless the Service approved such take in its regulations. These Federally authorized, State-issued permits are issued to individuals, and only the individual whose name and address appears on the permit at the time of issuance is authorized to take migratory birds at levels specified in the permit, in accordance with provisions of both Federal and State regulations governing the hunting season. The permit must be carried by the permittee when exercising its provisions and must be presented to any law enforcement officer upon request. The permit is not transferrable or assignable to another individual, and may not be sold, bartered, traded, or otherwise provided to another person. If the permit is altered or defaced in any way, the permit becomes invalid.

Special Youth Waterfowl Hunting Days Outside Dates: States may select 2 days per duck-hunting zone, designated as ``Youth Waterfowl Hunting Days,'' in addition to their regular duck seasons. The days must be held outside any regular duck season on a weekend, holidays, or other non-school days when youth hunters would have the maximum opportunity to participate. The days may be held up to 14 days before or after any regular duck-season frameworks or within any split of a regular duck season, or within any other open season on migratory birds. Daily Bag Limits: The daily bag limits may include ducks, geese, tundra swans, mergansers, coots, moorhens, and gallinules and would be the same as those allowed in the regular season. Flyway species and area restrictions would remain in effect. Shooting Hours: One-half hour before sunrise to sunset. Participation Restrictions: Youth hunters must be 15 years of age or younger. In addition, an adult at least 18 years of age must accompany the youth hunter into the field.

The season must end no later than the second Sunday in December (December 11) or upon attainment of 10 trumpeter swans in the harvest, whichever occurs earliest. The Utah season remains subject to the terms of the Memorandum of Agreement entered into with the Service in August 2001, regarding harvest monitoring, season closure procedures, and education requirements to minimize the take of trumpeter swans during the swan season. Nevada: No more than 650 permits may be issued. During the swan season, no more than 5 trumpeter swans may be taken. The season must end no later than the Sunday following January 1 (January 8) or upon attainment of 5 trumpeter swans in the harvest, whichever occurs earliest. In addition, the States of Utah and Nevada must implement a harvest-monitoring program to measure the species composition of the swan harvest. The harvest-monitoring program must require that all harvested swans or their species-determinant parts be examined by either State or Federal biologists for the purpose of species classification. The States should use appropriate measures to maximize hunter compliance in providing bagged swans for examination. Further, the States of Montana, Nevada, and Utah must achieve at least an 80- percent compliance rate, or subsequent permits will be reduced by 10 percent. All three [[Page 58693]] States must provide to the Service by June 30, 2012, a report detailing harvest, hunter participation, reporting compliance, and monitoring of swan populations in the designated hunt areas.
