ACTION: Final rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: This rule prescribes final late-season frameworks from which States may select season dates, limits, and other options for the 1999- 2000 migratory bird hunting seasons. These late seasons include most waterfowl seasons, the earliest of which generally commence on or about October 1, 1999. The effect of this final rule is to facilitate the selection of hunting seasons by the States to further the annual establishment of the late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. State selections will be published in the Federal Register as amendments to Secs. 20.101 through 20.107, and Sec. 20.109 of title 50 CFR. DATES: This rule takes effect on September 27, 1999. ADDRESSES: States should send their season selections to: Chief, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, ms 634-ARLSQ, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240. You may inspect comments during normal business hours in room 634, Arlington Square Building, 4401 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jonathan Andrew, Chief, or Ron W. Kokel, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, (703) 358-1714. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations Schedule for 1999 On May 3, 1999, we published in the Federal Register (64 FR 23742) a proposal to amend 50 CFR part 20. The proposal dealt with the establishment of seasons, limits, and other regulations for migratory game birds under Sec. 20.101 through 20.107, 20.109, and 20.110 of subpart K. On June 17, we published in the Federal Register (64 FR 32758) a second document providing supplemental proposals for early- and late-season migratory bird hunting regulations frameworks and the proposed regulatory alternatives for the 1999-2000 duck hunting season. The June 17 supplement also provided detailed information on the 1999- 2000 regulatory schedule and announced the Service Migratory Bird Regulations Committee and Flyway Council meetings. On June 22-23, we held meetings that reviewed information on the current status of migratory shore and upland game birds and developed 1999-2000 migratory game bird regulations recommendations for these species plus regulations for migratory game birds in Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands; special September waterfowl seasons in designated States; special sea duck seasons in the Atlantic Flyway; and extended falconry seasons. In addition, we reviewed and discussed preliminary information on the status of waterfowl as it relates to the development and selection of the regulatory packages for the 1999-2000 regular waterfowl seasons. On July 22, we published in the Federal Register (64 FR 39460) a third document specifically dealing with the proposed frameworks for early-season regulations for the 1999-2000 duck hunting season. The July 22 supplement also established the final regulatory alternatives for the 1999-2000 duck hunting season. On August 3-4, 1999, we held meetings, as announced in the May 3 and June 17 Federal Registers, to review the status of waterfowl. On August 27, 1999, we published a fourth document (64 FR 47048) which dealt specifically with proposed frameworks for the 1999-2000 late- season migratory bird hunting regulations. On August 27, 1999, we published a fifth document (64 FR 47072) containing final frameworks for early migratory bird hunting seasons from which wildlife conservation agency officials from the States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands selected early-season hunting dates, hours, areas, and limits for the 1999-2000 season. On August 31, 1999, we published in the Federal Register (64 FR 46336) a sixth document consisting of a final rule amending subpart K of title 50 CFR part 20 to set hunting seasons, hours, areas, and limits for early seasons. This document, which establishes final frameworks for late-season migratory bird hunting regulations for the 1999-2000 season, is the seventh in the series. Review of Flyway Council Recommendations, Public Comments, and the Service's Response. The preliminary proposed rulemaking, which appeared in the May 3 Federal Register, opened the public-comment period for late-season migratory game bird hunting regulations. The public comment period for late-season issues ended on September 7, 1999. We received recommendations from all four Flyway Councils. Written comments received through September 7, 1999, relating to the proposed late- season frameworks are summarized and discussed in the order used in the May 3 Federal Register. Only the numbered items pertaining to late seasons for which written comments were received are included. We received recommendations from all four Flyway Councils. Some recommendations supported continuation of last year's frameworks. Due to the comprehensive nature of the annual review of the frameworks performed by the Councils, support for continuation of last year's frameworks is assumed for items for which no recommendations were received. Council recommendations for changes in the frameworks are summarized below. General Written Comments: The Wildlife Management Institute supported the proposals for the 1999-2000 season. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) expressed concern that the general public was not well represented in the regulations- development process and requested establishment of a system directly involving the non-hunting public. In addition, they believed that all migratory bird seasons should be closed or severely restricted for those species either lacking reliable population data or which data indicates significant and sustained declines. HSUS recommended all seasons open at noon, mid-week, to reduce the large kills associated with the traditional Saturday openings and that hunting during the one- half hour before sunrise be eliminated. Service Response: As we have stated previously, when the preliminary proposed rulemaking document was published in the Federal Register on May 6, 1999, we announced the comment periods for the early-season and late-season proposals and gave notice that the process of promulgating hunting regulations ``must, by its nature, operate under time constraints.'' Ample time must be given to gather and interpret survey data, consider recommendations and develop proposals, and to receive public comment. Scheduled dates are set to give the greatest possible opportunity for public input. We are obligated to, and do give serious consideration to all information received as public comment. We have long recognized the problems associated with the length of time necessary to establish the final frameworks, and in conjunction with States, Flyway Councils, and the public, [[Page 52125]] and continue to seek new ways to streamline and improve the process. As we stated in the August 27 Federal Register, our long-term objectives continue to include providing opportunities to harvest portions of certain migratory game bird populations and to limit harvests to levels compatible with each population's ability to maintain healthy, viable numbers. Annually, we evaluate the status of populations and consider the potential impacts of hunting. We believe that the hunting seasons provided herein are consistent with the current status of populations and long-term population goals and there is no evidence to suggest the frameworks provided are not appropriate. Regarding mid-week season openings, we have previously stated in the Federal Register (58 FR 50190) that a State may choose to delay its opening date to correspond with a particular day of the week or to close earlier to maximize the number of weekends that hunting is allowed. In regard to shooting hours, we have compiled information which demonstrates that shooting hours beginning one-half hour before sunrise do not contribute significantly to the harvest of nontarget species. Consistent with the Service's long-term strategy for shooting hours, published in the September 21, 1990, Federal Register (55 FR 38898), the frameworks herein provide for shooting hours of one-half hour before sunrise to sunset, unless otherwise specified. 1. Ducks The categories used to discuss issues related to duck harvest management are as follows: (A) General Harvest Strategy, (B) Framework Dates, (C) Season Length, (D) Closed Seasons, (E) Bag Limits, (F) Zones and Split Seasons, and (G) Special Seasons/Species Management. Only those categories containing substantial recommendations are included below. A. General Harvest Strategy Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council, the Upper- Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council, the Central Flyway Council, and the Pacific Flyway Council recommended adopting the ``liberal'' alternative for the 1999-2000 duck hunting season. The Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended adoption of the ``liberal'' alternative, except that they recommend framework dates of the Saturday nearest October 1 to the Sunday nearest January 20 for all States. The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended adoption of the ``liberal'' alternative, except that they recommend a 60-day season for all States regardless of the framework closing date. Specific details are discussed in B. Framework Dates. Written Comments: The Delta Waterfowl Foundation and the National Wildlife Federation supported the selection of the ``liberal'' alternative. An individual from Minnesota questioned the breeding population estimate and recommended the 45-day season alternative. Service Response: Since 1995, Adaptive Harvest Management (AHM) strategies have been based on the status of midcontinent mallards, which are defined as those breeding in the traditional survey area, and in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. An optimal regulatory choice is based on breeding population size and prairie water conditions, and on the weights assigned to four alternative models of population dynamics. The same regulatory alternative is applied in all four Flyways, although season lengths and bag limits are Flyway-specific. The 1999 harvest strategy for midcontinent mallards is based on: (1) An objective to maximize long-term harvest and achieve a population goal of 8.7 million; (2) regulatory alternatives that are unchanged from last year; and (3) model weights that are similar to last year. Based on a breeding population size of 11.8 million mallards in the mid- continent region (traditional survey areas and Lake States) and 3.9 million ponds in Prairie Canada, the optimal regulatory choice for midcontinent mallards in 1999 is the ``liberal'' alternative. Modifying the AHM protocol to account for mallards breeding eastward and westward of the midcontinent region is perhaps the most challenging technical issue facing duck harvest managers. Never before have we tried to consider the status of multiple mallard stocks in such a formal way, nor have we attempted to give all Flyways the ability to choose regulations that are tied to their particular derivation of mallards. Although progress has been significant, there are a number of outstanding technical issues. The Service and AHM working group have assigned a high priority to addressing these issues, and hope to fully integrate eastern mallards and western mallards into the AHM process in 2000 and 2001, respectively. In the interim, we are exploring optimal harvest strategies targeted for eastern mallards. A harvest strategy has been derived based on: (1) an objective to maximize long-term harvest; (2) regulatory alternatives that are unchanged from last year; and (3) a ``working model'' of population dynamics. Based on a breeding population size of 1.1 million mallards and spring precipitation of 8.3 inches, the optimal regulatory choice for eastern mallards in 1999 is the ``liberal'' alternative. By next year, we hope to be able to prescribe Flyway-specific regulations for those cases where the optimal regulatory choice is different for midcontinent and eastern mallards. Therefore, we agree with the Flyway Councils and are utilizing the ``liberal'' alternative for the 1999 duck hunting season. B. Framework Dates Council Recommendations: The Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended adoption of the ``liberal'' alternative, except that they recommend framework dates of the Saturday nearest October 1 to the Sunday nearest January 20 for all States. The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended a 60-day season for all States regardless of their selected framework closing date. Written Comments: The HSUS recommended that season openings be delayed by 2 weeks in all breeding areas in order to allow ducks time to leave natal marshes before being subjected to hunting. Service Response: Frameworks for the 1999-2000 duck hunting season were established in the July 22 Federal Register, with the finalization of the 1999-2000 regulatory alternatives. As we indicated in our July 22 response, we continued the use of the 1998-99 regulatory alternatives published in the August 5, 1998, Federal Register, for the 1999-2000 hunting season with one exception. For the States of Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee, we offered the use of a 51-day season in the ``liberal'' alternative and a 38-day season in the ``moderate'' alternative with a January 31 framework closing date in both alternatives. Framework opening and closing dates for all other States are unchanged from those published in the August 5, 1998, Federal Register. For a complete discussion of this issue, you should refer to the July 22 Federal Register. Regarding HSUS's comment on the framework opening date, the Service reiterates previous responses that the frameworks provided herein are appropriate and that there is no evidence to indicate that they have adversely impacted local populations. [[Page 52126]] F. Zones and Split Seasons Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended the Service allow ``3 zones with 2-way splits in each zones'' as an additional option beginning in 2001. Further, the Council recommended that zone-split guidelines be finalized by July 2000 so that States have adequate opportunity to select their desired approach. The Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that the Service add ``3 zones with 2-way splits permitted in one or more zones'' as an additional option beginning in 2001. Further, because of the public input process many States undertake, the Committee recommended that States have up to one year to choose this option prior to the 2001 regular duck season regulations process. The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that the Service consider offering all States the option of choosing 3 zones with a split season in each zone in the year 2001. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended the Service engage the Flyway Councils in an evaluation of the guidelines for zoning and split seasons, prior to the 2001 ``open season'' on regulation changes. Written Comments: The HSUS urged the Service to discontinue all split and special seasons and recommended that any State establishing such seasons reduce the total number of hunting days by a minimum of 10 days. Service Response: We acknowledge the recommendations from the Councils pertaining to the guidelines for selecting zone and split options for duck hunting. Accordingly, we will work with all the Flyway Councils in the next year to review the existing guidelines, and plan to finalize these guidelines during next year's (2000-01) late-season regulations process. The final guidance will then be available for use by all States in the ensuing year as they solicit public input for zone and split configurations for use during 2001-05. In regard to the recommendation that split and special seasons be discontinued, we note that States always have the option of selecting a continuous season with no splits. Furthermore, we are not aware of any information suggesting that split and special seasons are causing detrimental impacts to populations. G. Special Seasons/Species Management i. Black Ducks Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended that the individual Atlantic Flyway States continue to achieve a 42 percent reduction in their black duck harvest during the 1999-2000 season compared with the 1977-81 base-line harvest. Written Comments: The HSUS recommended closing the season for black ducks until recovery of the population. Service Response: We agree with the Atlantic Flyway Council's recommendation and acknowledge the Council's concern for the population status of black ducks. Black duck populations remain below the North American Wildlife Management Plan goal and while the decline seems to have halted, little increase is evident. Harvest estimates increased 16% in the U.S. (8% in the Atlantic and 36% in the Mississippi Flyways) during the 1998-99 hunting season and we reiterate our concern about the effects of longer duck seasons on black duck harvests and recommend that States maintain harvest restrictions achieved since the 1983 Environmental Assessment. Higher harvests and lower midwinter population estimates in the Mississippi Flyway in recent years are of particular concern. Although efforts are underway to develop an international harvest strategy, and possibly an AHM approach, interim harvest restriction alternatives should be considered where appropriate. Thus, we believe the harvest restrictions identified in the 1983 Environmental Assessment should be maintained until a revised harvest strategy is developed. ii. Canvasbacks Council Recommendations: The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council requested to know the population level at which an increase in the canvasback bag limit would be warranted. Service Response: We continue to support the canvasback harvest strategy adopted in 1994. This strategy allows a daily bag limit of 1 bird during any open season. Seasons with a daily bag limit greater than 1 would require revision of the strategy, and we believe that more experience with the present strategy is needed before revisions are considered. Current population and habitat status suggest that a daily bag limit of 1 canvasback during the 1999-2000 season will result in a harvest within levels allowed by the strategy. However, monitoring data collected during the last 5 years suggest that harvest models have consistently predicted levels of harvest lower than those observed. For the 1999-2000 season, the strategy still prescribes an open season, even when accounting for this additional harvest. However, we believe that, beginning in the 2000-01 season, the harvest models (some of which were based on data from about 30 years ago) should be replaced with these more contemporary data. We will present the proposed harvest levels at next winter's Flyway Technical Section meetings for review. iii. Pintails Council Recommendations: All four Flyway Councils recommended a daily bag limit of 1 pintail in the 1999-2000 hunting season as prescribed by the Interim Pintail Harvest Strategy. Written Comments: The Nevada Waterfowl Association requested the Service determine the sex ratio of the adult portion of the continental pintail population. They believed that there is an abnormally high percentage of males in the adult population and that these excess males could provide additional opportunity without impacting the overall population. Service Response: We concur with the Councils' recommendations. Considering the current status of the population (3.1 million breeding birds) and the expected recruitment rate (1.00), the strategy prescribes a bag limit of 1 pintail for all Flyways under the ``liberal'' alternative. iv. Scaup In the past year, we have continued to indicate our growing concern for the status and trends of North American scaup. We distributed a status report on scaup and provided some initial guidelines concerning a scaup harvest strategy to the Flyway Councils and others for consideration in the development of recommendations for the 1999-2000 hunting season. In response to this information, all four Flyways discussed the issue at their winter meetings. Following Council comments on the initial harvest guidelines (presented in the July 22 Federal Register), we revised the harvest guidelines and developed a draft harvest strategy that was distributed to the Councils for consideration at their summer meetings. Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended a daily bag limit of 3 scaup until adoption of a harvest strategy for lesser and greater scaup. The Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended a daily bag limit [[Page 52127]] of 3 scaup. The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended no scaup restriction in the overall daily bag limit. The Central Flyway Council recommended adoption of the draft harvest strategy with the exception of the prescription. The Council recommended a prescription for scaup bag limits based on the status of lesser scaup as follows: < 2.5 million, bag limit of 1; 2.5-3.5 million, bag limit of 2; 3.5-4.0 million, bag limit of 3; and > 4.0, the bag limit for scaup should equal the regular daily duck limit as determined by the AHM process. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended no internal bag restrictions on scaup in the Pacific Flyway for the 1999-2000 hunting season. Written Comments: The Nevada Waterfowl Association was concerned about a potential 2-bird daily bag limit restriction on scaup in the Pacific Flyway. They urged careful evaluation of the expected results before implementation of such a restriction. The HSUS recommended closing the season for scaup until recovery of the population. Service Response: We remain concerned about the status of lesser scaup. Lesser scaup populations have declined 1% per year since 1995 and 3% per year during the last 10 years. Lesser scaup harvest has varied over the years in the U.S. with lows around 100,000 in 1990 but since has increased in recent years to over 500,000. These recent increases have occurred concurrent with liberalizations in season length and bag limits with the implementation of AHM. For the 1999-2000 season, we are establishing a a bag limit of 3 scaup in the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Central Flyways, and 4 scaup in the Pacific Flyway. This action is only for one year. These bag limit reductions maintain the current differentials in the full duck bag limit that presently exist among Flyways. While we note a general feeling among the Flyway Councils that some reduction is appropriate, we acknowledge that this is not unanimous among Flyways. However, we believe that if a reduction in harvest is needed, all should participate. We will continue to work with the Flyway Councils to develop a harvest strategy to be formally adopted prior to next year's hunting season. 4. Canada Geese Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended that a limited hunting season for AP (Atlantic Population) Canada geese be permitted in 1999-2000 throughout AP harvest areas (those areas closed in 1998) in the Atlantic Flyway. For the Mid-Atlantic and New England AP Areas, the Council recommended a 15-day season with framework dates of November 1--January 20. The daily bag limit would be 1 Canada goose. For the Chesapeake Region AP Areas, the Council recommended a 6-day season with framework dates of November 15 to January 20. The daily bag limit would be 1 Canada goose. Additionally, in Delaware and Maryland the harvest would be limited to 2,100 and 12,200 birds, respectively, and all Canada geese must be tagged and the season limit will be the number of tags issued to each permittee. In Southern Region AP Areas, the Council recommended the season remain closed. In all open areas, the season could be split into two segments, but must run concurrent with duck seasons. The Atlantic Flyway Council also recommended modification of the frameworks for the regular season in Erie, Butler, and Mercer Counties, and designated portions of Crawford County, in Pennsylvania. The Council recommended changing the existing 70-day season with October 1 to January 31 frameworks to a 40-day season between November 15 and January 15, with a daily bag limit of 2 geese per day. The Council also recommended modification of the framework opening date in southwestern New York to November 1 and allowing Maryland to divide their regular resident Canada goose season into 3 segments on an experimental basis for the 1999-2000 season. The Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended a number of changes in season lengths, bag limits, zones, and quotas for Canada geese in Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, and Illinois, primarily to allow increased harvest of Mississippi Valley Population (MVP) Canada geese, and in Minnesota, Iowa, and Missouri, primarily to allow increased harvest of Eastern Prairie Population (EPP) Canada geese. The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council also recommended several changes in season lengths, quotas, etc., primarily to allow increased harvest of MVP Canada geese. All of these changes are based on improved population status and current management plans. The Central Flyway Council made several recommendations. In the East Tier, the Council recommended an increase in the Canada goose (or any other goose species except light and white-fronted geese) season from 93 days to 95 days with a daily bag limit of 3. Outside framework dates would be the Saturday nearest October 1 (Oct. 2, 1999) and the Sunday nearest February 15 (Feb. 13, 2000). In the Eastern Goose Zone of Texas, the Council recommended an additional season alternative of 107 days with a 1 Canada goose daily bag limit. The framework closing date under both alternatives would be February 21. In the West Tier, the Council recommended dark goose outside framework dates of the Saturday nearest October 1 (October 2, 1999) and the Sunday nearest February 15 (February 13, 1999), with daily bag and possession limits of 5 and 10, respectively. In the Western Goose Zone of Texas, the Council recommended a daily bag limit of 5 dark geese, to include no more than 2 white-fronted geese, with a framework closing date of February 21. The Pacific Flyway Council made several recommendations for dark geese (see also item 5. White-fronted Geese). The Council recommended the bag limit for dark geese be increased from 2 to 3 in the Rocky Mountain Population zones in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada (except Lincoln and Clark Counties) New Mexico, and Utah. The Pacific Flyway Council also recommended that Washington and Oregon be allowed to split the dark goose season in the Dusky quota zones into 3 segments. Additionally, they recommended that the Harney, Lake, Klamath, and Malheur goose zone in Oregon be re-defined to include only Lake County. The Council also recommended that white-fronted and cackling Canada geese be allowed during the first 44 days in the Northeastern Zone of California. Finally, the Council recommended several boundary adjustments to the closure zones for dark geese in the Balance-of-the State Zone in California. Written Comments: An individual in Alabama requested a February framework closing date for geese. Service Response: We support the Atlantic Flyway's request to reinstate the regular season on the Atlantic Population of Canada geese in the areas described. Numbers of breeding pairs in northern Quebec increased substantially this spring from last year's estimate, which suggests this population is showing signs of recovery. An increase in nesting densities was also encouraging, although predation will likely limit nest success to ``good'' in the Ungava Bay area and only fair along the Hudson Bay Coast. A slight increase in the fall flight is predicted. While we remain cautious about resuming a sport [[Page 52128]] harvest, we recognize that the Action Plan criteria have been triggered. For the near future, we remain optimistic about the recovery of this population, particularly with average or better production since 1997, which should continue the expansion in the number of breeding pairs. Regarding the Central Flyway Council's recommendations, we support their request to increase the Canada goose (or any other goose species except light geese and white-fronted geese) season from 93 to 95 days with a daily bag limit of 3 for the entire East Tier. We also support the Council's recommendation for an additional season alternative of a 107-day season with a 1 Canada goose daily bag limit in the Eastern Goose Zone of Texas. Further, we support the Council's recommendation for outside framework dates and believe that all dark goose seasons in the East Tier should have consistent outside dates of the Saturday nearest October 1 (Oct. 2, 1999) and the Sunday nearest February 15 (Feb. 13, 2000). In the West Tier, we support the Council's recommendation for an increase in the aggregate dark goose bag and possession limits from 4 and 8 to 5 and 10, respectively. However, in the Western Goose Zone of Texas, we do not support an increase in the white-fronted goose daily bag restriction from 1 to 2. While we are aware that the whitefront harvest (about 5,000) in this zone is small, we are concerned about the status of white-fronted geese breeding in the Interior of Alaska, which migrate through this area. These birds clearly have lower survival rates than Mid-Continent white-fronted geese from other breeding areas, but indices of abundance and long-term trends are less certain. We also realize that harvest of these birds also occurs in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the Mexico Highlands; however, we believe that the Management Plan serves as the appropriate mechanism to address cooperative harvest management strategies for these birds. We also do not support the recommended framework closing date of February 21 in the West Tier and believe that dark goose outside dates should be consistent with the East Tier. Thus, we are establishing framework dates of the Saturday nearest October 1 (Oct. 2, 1999) to the Sunday nearest February 15 (Feb. 13, 2000) for the entire Western Tier. Regarding the other recommendations from the Flyway Councils: we concur with the framework modifications in Pennsylvania, New York, Maryland; changes in season lengths, bag limits, zones, and quotas for Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, and Missouri; bag limit, zone boundary, and framework modifications in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Washington and Oregon. C. Special Late Seasons Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended an experimental late season between January 15 and February 15 for Erie, Butler, and Mercer Counties, and designated portions of Crawford County, in Pennsylvania. The Upper-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended the establishment of experimental late Canada goose seasons for Minnesota and Ohio. The Lower-Region Regulations Committee of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that the Service work closely with the Council's Technical Section in evaluating the cumulative effects that special seasons may have on non-target populations. Written Comments: The HSUS opposed special late seasons targeting resident geese. They believe that such hunts fail to target the populations ostensibly responsible for conflicts with humans and as such are ineffective. Service Response: We concur with the recommended changes in the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways and will continue to work with the Mississippi Flyway Council's Technical Section to assess the cumulative effects of special seasons. Regarding the HSUS's comment that such hunts fail to target specific populations, we recognize the problems caused by increasing populations of resident geese and the continuing concern for the status of certain migratory flocks. However, as we have stated previously, we remain committed to focusing these special seasons on locally-breeding and/or injurious Canada goose populations. The Service and the Flyway Councils have cooperatively reviewed and structured these special seasons to accomplish that objective while protecting migratory flocks. We do not wish to increase the composition of migrants in the harvest beyond that which is currently identified in the criteria for these seasons. 5. White-fronted Geese Council Recommendations: The Upper- and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that seasons for white-fronted geese increase from 70 days and 2 geese to 86 days and 2 geese or 107 days and 1 goose, with a framework closing date of February 15, consistent with the Mid-Continent white-fronted goose plan. The Central Flyway Council recommendations regarding dark geese in the West Tier involve white-fronted geese (see item 4. Canada Geese). For the East Tier, the Council recommended a 95-day season with framework dates of the Saturday nearest October 1 (October 2, 1999) to January 31, with a daily bag limit of 2 whitefronts. In the Eastern Goose Zone of Texas, the Council recommended a 86-day season with a daily bag limit of 2 whitefronts or an alternative 107-day season with a daily bag limit of 2 whitefronts for 44 consecutive days and 1 for the remaining 63 days. The framework closing date would be February 21. The Pacific Flyway Council recommendations regarding dark geese also involve white-fronted geese (see item 4. Canada Geese). The Council recommended the bag limit for dark geese be increased from 2 to 3 in the Rocky Mountain Population zones in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada (except Lincoln and Clark Counties) New Mexico, and Utah. The Pacific Flyway Council also recommended that Washington and Oregon be allowed to split the dark goose season in the Dusky quota zones into 3 segments. Additionally, they recommended that the Harney, Lake, Klamath, and Malheur goose zone in Oregon be re-defined to include only Lake County. The Council also recommended that white- fronted and cackling Canada geese be allowed during the first 44 days in the Northeastern Zone of California. Finally, the Council recommended several boundary adjustments to the closure zones for dark geese in the Balance-of-the State Zone in California. Further, the Council supported the liberal whitefront frameworks proposed by the Mississippi and Central Flyway Councils. Service Response: As we noted above, the Central Flyway Council's recommendations for dark geese include whitefronts in the West Tier and are further addressed in item 4. Canada geese. For the East Tier, we do not support an increase in the season length and bag limit from 72 days and 2 birds, or 86 days and 1 bird, to 95 days and 2 birds with a framework closing date of January 31. For the Eastern Goose Zone of Texas, we also do not support a 107-day season alternative with a daily bag limit of 2 whitefronts for 44 consecutive days and 1 bird for the remaining 63 days with a framework closing date of February 21. We believe that the whitefront season length and daily bag limit should be 86 days and 2 birds or 107 days and 1 bird for both the Mississippi Flyway and the East Tier of [[Page 52129]] the Central Flyway. We believe that equitable hunting opportunity between the Mississippi Flyway and the East Tier of the Central Flyway is appropriate because Mid-Continent white-fronted geese are managed as one population. This equitable approach is consistent with the ``base regulations'' identified in the cooperative management plan. Finally, in the absence of any guidance for liberalizations, we believe that this level of liberalization should be viewed as the ``liberal alternative'' beyond the ``base regulations'' identified in the management plan for these harvest areas. Regarding framework closing dates, we do not support recommendations for a whitefront framework closing date of January 31 in the East Tier and a framework closing date of February 21 for the Eastern Goose Zone of Texas. We will utilize a dark goose framework closing date of the Sunday nearest February 15th for the entire East Tier. This date is consistent with the framework closing date for dark geese in the West Tier. We believe that the change in harvest related to this alignment of framework closing dates would be negligible, and consistent framework closing dates would facilitate the simplification of dark goose hunting regulations in the Central Flyway. We also acknowledge the completion of the Cooperative Management Plan for Mid-Continent White-fronted geese (1998). The Plan supports the combining of Eastern and Western Segments of Mid-Continent whitefronts into one population. However, we believe that a major shortcoming of the Plan surfaced this year relating to the guidance provided for the setting of hunting regulations. Although ``base regulations'' are clearly defined in the Plan, no guidance is provided for liberalizations or restrictions from base regulations. This year, the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended liberalizations different than those recommended by the Central Flyway Council, although the plan calls for the same ``base regulations.'' Further, the population objective (600,000) and associated thresholds identified in the Plan appear to have little relationship with recent population estimates derived from the fall population survey conducted since 1992. Additionally, we believe that cooperative management plans are an appropriate mechanism to address International issues related to special harvest considerations and information data needs, e.g. interior Alaska whitefronts. We are aware of the 5-year revision schedule for this plan and encourage the Central and Mississippi Flyways to work with the Pacific Flyway, Canada and Mexico to address these issues in the next plan update. We concur with the other Flyway Council recommendations. 6. Brant Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended an increase in the daily bag limit for brant from 2 to 4 birds. The Upper- and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended seasons for brant be modified to include an option of 107 days and 1 brant in addition to the current 70 days and 2 brant. The Committees do not expect this additional option to increase brant harvest in the Flyway, but would allow states to set dark goose season dates to coincide. Written Comments: The Atlantic Flyway Council subsequently recommended the brant daily bag limit remain at 2 birds. Their revised recommendation was based on new information from the Arctic breeding grounds indicating a strong possibility of very limited brant production this year. Service Response: In the Atlantic Flyway, we concur with the change back to a 2-bird daily bag limit based on reports from the Baffin Island and surrounding areas that there was no appreciable production this year. Although an increase to a 4-bird daily bag would be consistent with the Atlantic Brant Hunt Plan based on the population status (171,628 in the mid-winter survey), we believe it prudent to conserve the breeding stock and not liberalize the bag limit during a year of poor production. In the Mississippi Flyway, we concur with the creation of a 107-day season option. 7. Snow and Ross' Geese Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended allowing the use of an unlimited number of splits in the snow goose season. The Central Flyway Council supported the late-winter light goose hunting season in the Rainwater Basin area of Nebraska per the plan agreed to by the Service and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. Written Comments: The Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources requested that the Service allow States in the Chesapeake Bay Region (including Delaware) the ability to split their snow goose season up to 47 times. They believed this would be the most effective method for discouraging snow geese from depredating wetlands and agricultural fields. Under this scenario, the season would not have to be closed for more than one day at a time. Alternately, they requested the use of zones and the ability to split their snow goose season up to 15 times. Under this scenario, the season would be closed for 3-day periods each week. Both alternatives would be considered experimental and would be evaluated by use of farm surveys, monthly aerial surveys, biweekly snow goose surveys, and harvest surveys. The HSUS believes that the proposed bag limits for snow geese in the Atlantic and Central Flyways are too high, devaluing the birds. Service Response: We are sympathetic towards the depredation issues brought forward by the Atlantic Flyway Council in Delaware and Maryland where too many greater snow geese are causing extensive agricultural damage and wetland degradation during closed segments of their hunting seasons. It remains to be seen whether an increase in the number of split seasons will resolve this problem, but to provide temporary relief, we agree to explore this option further pending an evaluation. We propose that Delaware and Maryland be guided by the existing restrictions on splits for geese (3-way split season) until the end of the regular duck season. After such time, they will be permitted to hunt on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, involving two splits per week until the framework closing date of March 10, 2000. This season would be experimental, limited to this year only, and requires an evaluation. We will reevaluate the effectiveness on this approach prior to next year. Both States should actively seek landowner support to reduce their crop damage problems by allowing hunter access on their fields to hunt snow geese. At this time, we do not support the recommendation for use of unlimited splits during snow goose seasons. In 1997, we allowed an increase from 2 to 3 season segments for geese in all four Flyways. This increase resulted in a more consistent use of split-season options among all Flyways. In addition, within any established season, a State may also designate certain days as non-hunt days, if that hunt strategy is desired. The use of zoning for light geese remains a management tool that is currently not contained by specific guidelines for use by a State. We believe that the current ability to divide a 107-day season into 3 segments with the [[Page 52130]] unlimited use of zones provides adequate flexibility for States to set seasons for light geese. Regarding the hunt strategy for the Rainwater Basin, we appreciate the Central Flyway Council's support of the late-winter light goose hunting strategy for the Rainwater Basin Area of Nebraska and propose to implement the strategy this year. Regarding snow goose bag limits, last year we changed the daily bag limit for light geese from 10 to 20 in the Atlantic Flyway and eliminated the possession limits in the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Central Flyways because it was no longer a useful management tool. At this time, we see no compelling evidence to change and will continue use of this framework for the 1999-2000 season. 8. Swans Written Comments: The HSUS requested that the Service close swan hunting seasons in Utah, Nevada, and the Pacific Flyway portion of Montana, citing that these seasons were threatened trumpeter swan recovery and winter range expansion. Service Response: We would refer the HSUS to our detailed response in the September 27, 1995, Federal Register (60 FR 50042) concerning the establishment of a general swan season. Enhancing Rocky Mounting Population trumpeter swan range expansion while retaining most aspects of tundra swan hunting were covered in detail in our 1995 Environmental Assessment ``Proposal to Establish General Swan Seasons in Parts of the Pacific Flyway for the 1995-99 Seasons'' (August 1995) which compares various alternative strategies for reconciling conflicting swan management strategies. Copies are available at the address indicated under the caption ADDRESSES. 10. Coots Written Comments: The HSUS believes that the bag limits for coots are too high, devaluing the birds. Service Response: Available information indicates that harvest pressure on coots is relatively light and there is no evidence to suggest the frameworks provided are not appropriate. 10. Moorhens and Gallinules Written Comments: The HSUS believes that the bag limits for moorhens are too high, devaluing the birds. Service Response: Available information indicates that harvest pressure on these birds is relatively light and there is no evidence to suggest the frameworks provided are not appropriate. NEPA Consideration NEPA considerations are covered by the programmatic document, ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES 88- 14),'' filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on June 9, 1988. We published a Notice of Availability in the Federal Register on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582). We published our Record of Decision on August 18, 1988 (53 FR 31341). Copies are available from the address indicated under the caption ADDRESSES. Endangered Species Act Considerations As in the past, we design hunting regulations to remove or alleviate chances of conflict between migratory game bird hunting seasons and the protection and conservation of endangered and threatened species. We conducted consultations to ensure that actions resulting from these regulatory proposals will not likely jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitat. Findings from these consultations are included in a biological opinion and may have caused modification of some regulatory measures previously proposed. Final frameworks reflect any modifications. The biological opinions resulting from Section 7 consultation are public documents available for inspection in the Service's Division of Endangered Species and the Office of Migratory Bird Management, at the address indicated under the caption ADDRESSES. Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 This rule is economically significant and was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under E.O. 12866. Regulatory Flexibility Act These regulations have a significant economic impact on substantial numbers of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). We analyzed the economic impacts of the annual hunting regulations on small business entities in detail and issued a Small Entity Flexibility Analysis (Analysis) in 1998. The Analysis documented the significant beneficial economic effect. The primary source of information about hunter expenditures for migratory game bird hunting is the National Hunting and Fishing Survey, which is conducted at 5-year intervals. The Analysis was based on the 1996 National Hunting and Fishing Survey and the U.S. Department of Commerce's County Business Patterns from which it was estimated that migratory bird hunters would spend between $429 and $1,084 million at small businesses in 1998. Copies of the Analysis are available upon request. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act This rule is a major rule under 5 U.S.C. 804(2), the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. For the reasons outlined above, this rule has an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. However, because this rule establishes hunting seasons, we do not plan to defer the effective date under the exemption contained in 5 U.S.C. 808(1). Paperwork Reduction Act We examined these regulations under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. We utilize the various recordkeeping and reporting requirements imposed under regulations established in 50 CFR Part 20, Subpart K, in the formulation of migratory game bird hunting regulations. Specifically, OMB has approved the information collection requirements of the Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program and assigned clearance number 1018-0015 (expires 09/30/2001). This information is used to provide a sampling frame for voluntary national surveys to improve our harvest estimates for all migratory game birds in order to better manage these populations. A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act We have determined and certify in compliance with the requirements of the Unfunded Mandates Act, 2 U.S.C. 1502 et seq., that this rulemaking will not impose a cost of $100 million or more in any given year on local or State government or private entities. Civil Justice Reform--Executive Order 12988 The Department, in promulgating this rule, has determined that these regulations meet the applicable standards provided in Sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988. Takings Implication Assessment In accordance with Executive Order 12630, these rules, authorized by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, do not have significant takings implications and do not affect any constitutionally protected [[Page 52131]] property rights. These rules will not result in the physical occupancy of property, the physical invasion of property, or the regulatory taking of any property. In fact, these rules allow hunters to exercise privileges that would be otherwise unavailable; and, therefore, reduce restrictions on the use of private and public property. Federalism Effects Due to the migratory nature of certain species of birds, the Federal government has been given responsibility over these species by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We annually prescribe frameworks from which the States make selections and employs guidelines to establish special regulations on Federal Indian reservations and ceded lands. This process preserves the ability of the States and Tribes to determine which seasons meet their individual needs. Any State or Tribe may be more restrictive than the Federal frameworks at any time. The frameworks are developed in a cooperative process with the States and the Flyway Councils. This allows States to participate in the development of frameworks from which they will make selections, thereby having an influence on their own regulation. These rules do not have a substantial direct effect on fiscal capacity, change the roles or responsibilities of Federal or State governments, or intrude on State policy or administration. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, these regulations do not have significant federalism effects and do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Government-to-Government Relationship With Tribes In accordance with the President's memorandum of April 29, 1994, ``Government-to-Government Relations with Native American tribal Governments'' (59 FR 22951) and 512 DM 2, we have evaluated possible effects on Federally recognized Indian tribes and have determined that there are no effects. Regulations Promulgation The rulemaking process for migratory game bird hunting must, by its nature, operate under severe time constraints. However, we intend that the public be given the greatest possible opportunity to comment on the regulations. Thus, when the preliminary proposed rulemaking was published, we established what we believed were the longest periods possible for public comment. In doing this, we recognized that when the comment period closed, time would be of the essence. That is, if there were a delay in the effective date of these regulations after this final rulemaking, the States would have insufficient time to select season dates and limits; to communicate those selections to us; and to establish and publicize the necessary regulations and procedures to implement their decisions. We therefore find that ``good cause'' exists, within the terms of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, and these frameworks will, therefore, take effect immediately upon publication. Therefore, under authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (July 3, 1918), as amended, (16 U.S.C. 703-711), we prescribe final frameworks setting forth the species to be hunted, the daily bag and possession limits, the shooting hours, the season lengths, the earliest opening and latest closing season dates, and hunting areas, from which State conservation agency officials will select hunting season dates and other options. Upon receipt of season and option selections from these officials, we will publish in the Federal Register a final rulemaking amending 50 CFR part 20 to reflect seasons, limits, and shooting hours for the conterminous United States for the 1999-2000 season. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 20 Exports, Hunting, Imports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation, Wildlife. The rules that eventually will be promulgated for the 1999-2000 hunting season are authorized under 16 U.S.C. 703-712 and 16 U.S.C. 742 a-j. Dated: September 15, 1999. Donald J. Barry, Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. Final Regulations Frameworks for 1999-2000 Late Hunting Seasons on Certain Migratory Game Birds Pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and delegated authorities, the Department has approved frameworks for season lengths, shooting hours, bag and possession limits, and outside dates within which States may select seasons for hunting waterfowl and coots between the dates of September 1, 1999, and March 10, 2000.
