        "text": "Lake George, lake, northeastern New York state, U.S. It is 32 miles (51 km) long, 1–3 miles (1.6–5 km) wide, and extends northward from Lake George village to Ticonderoga, where it is connected to Lake Champlain through a narrow channel that descends 220 feet (67 metres) in a series of cataracts and waterfalls. Located in the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains at an elevation of 320 feet (98 metres) above sea level and surrounded by low mountains—including Mounts Fivemile, at 2,258 feet (688 metres), and Black, at 2,665 feet (812 metres)—the lake is of glacial origin, has a maximum depth of about 200 feet (60 metres), and is fed by mountain streams and submerged springs. Dotted with islands, it is a popular resort area noted for its scenic beauty.\n\nLake George was known to the Mohawk Indians as Andiatarocte (“Place Where the Lake Contracts”). The first Europeans to see the lake were probably Father (later St.) Isaac Jogues, a French Jesuit missionary, and his companions, René Goupil and Guillaume Couture, who were brought to the area by their Mohawk captors in 1642. Father Jogues returned to the lake in 1646 and christened it Lac du Saint-Sacrement. In 1755 General Sir William Johnson renamed it for King George II. James Fenimore Cooper refers to it in his novels as Lake Horicon.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nWater and its Varying Forms"
