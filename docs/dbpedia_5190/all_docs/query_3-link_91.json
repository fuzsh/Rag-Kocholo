Bradley was seriously injured by running against a switch near the west end of the platform at the C.M.&St.P. depot. Mr. Bradley has law offices in the Majestic building, Milwaukee, and was en route to a family gathering at his parents' home in Madison on Thanksgiving, where his wife was on a visit. He had a package for his mother-in-law, Mrs. A. C. Bittner, Clyman Street, and as he left the train at the depot a gust of wind blew his hat off. He called to the brakeman to hold the train till he regained his hat, and after getting it he started for the train on a run, thinking it had started, and ran against the switch at the end of the platform. As he boarded the train the passengers noticed the blood streaming from his forehead and a deep gash therein. When the train reached the Junction [just down the tracks] he was taken from it to a carriage and conveyed to the Bittner home on Clyman Street, where Dr. Moulding found it necessary to use five stitches in sewing up the wound. He is getting along nicely under the doctor's treatment and will be all right again in a short time.\n\nDiphtheria\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 04 1908\n\nVERY FEW CASES OF DIPHTHERIA IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. As president of the board of education of the city of Watertown, the undersigned has made it his official business to communicate with the superintendent and principals of the public schools of this city regarding the number of pupils who have been attending the public schools and are at present down with the disease diphtheria, and they say that all told only eight cases have been reported to them. One in the High School, four in No. 2 School, two in No. 3 School and one in No. 4 School. Many false rumors have been set afloat to the contrary, hence it is well that the public know the correct state of affairs. James W. Moore, President Board of Education. Watertown, Wis., December 2, 1908.\n\nMr. and Mrs. James Duffy\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 04 1908\n\n25th Wedding Anniversary.\n\nMr. and Mrs. James Duffy of the town of Clyman were most agreeably reminded last Friday evening of an important event in their lives which took place on Nov. 28th, 1883. Just 25 years have passed since they became life partners, and a number of their intimate friends invaded their hospitable home last Friday evening to remind them of that happy event. The \"bride and groom\" received their friends cordially, and quickly discovering the cause of the invasion, tendered an unconditional surrender which the \"enemy\" accepted. The visitors were very hospitably entertained and wedding festivities quite as real as those of '83 followed, to the enjoyment and delight of all present. At a very late hour the guests reluctantly departed for their respective homes leaving after them the pleasant memory of neighborly friendship, as well as sincerely expressed wishes for the continued happiness of one of Clyman's most worthy and respected households. [Juneau Telephone]\n\nJohn I. Beggs line to Beaver Dam\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 04 1908\n\nW. C. Stone of Watertown Here Yesterday in Interest of Road.\n\nRoad to be here January 1, 1910.\n\nBeaver Dam Citizen: W. C. Stone of Watertown was in the city yesterday in the interest of the Milwaukee Electric and Light Company, who propose to build an electric railway into Beaver Dam next year. The road is now completed from Milwaukee to Watertown and is equipped with cars that are models for interurban travel.\n\nMr. Stone said: \"The plans of the company are to build a line from Watertown to Fond du Lac, and thus connect with the Fox River Valley lines, which the company owns. When this line is completed cars will be run from Green Bay direct to Chicago. We will run sleeping and dining cars and make quick time, too.\n\n\"We are getting ready to build our road into Beaver Dam, having purchased property for right of way in Watertown and toward Beaver Dam. We will use the very best materials in the construction of the road. We use 80 and 90 pound rails, and concrete foundations. We do not build roads to sell, but build them to operate and benefit the towns that we go through.\n\n\"I believe that the first road that builds into Beaver Dam should be the one to be granted the franchise. We are going to build from Watertown to Fond du Lac, thus making a trunk line from Green Bay to Chicago, and will have the road in operation by January 1, 1910. The line will go through Waupun and other towns north of there. All we ask is fair treatment, but of course if Beaver Dam don't want us to come we will build around your city.\"\n\nMr. Stone left on the 4:57 train yesterday afternoon, and will return here in a few days to take the matter up with the council.\n\nContinuous Advertising\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 04 1908\n\nAdvertising must be continuous, for the generations are changing and people today are not taking any patent medicines advertised 30 years ago, unless the advertising has been kept up. Proof of the forgetfulness of the changing generations is seen in the fact that clowns and minstrels do not have to change jokes, counting on the certainty that the audience is changed. To advertise a big Christmas sale and not follow it up with a reduction sale would be to let the public forget you.\n\nAnnual Conference\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 04 1908\n\nThe annual conference of the Advent Christian churches of Wisconsin convened at the Moravian Church Tuesday evening and will continue over Sunday. There will be preaching at 10:30 a. m. and 2:30 and 7:30 p. m. each day. A number of minister delegates and visitors are in attendance. There will be a song service at 7:80 o'clock and preaching at 8 o'clock. The business sessions of the conference began Thursday at 9 a. m. The public is cordially invited to attend all the sessions of this conference.\n\nRev. D. C. Meinert\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 04 1908\n\nRev. C. Kreider, principal of the Moravian seminary at Lititz, Pa., visited in the city on Monday, and while here announced that Rev. D. C. Meinert, of Nazareth, Pa., formerly pastor of the Moravian church in Watertown, has been appointed assistant principal of Linden Hall seminary at Lititz.\n\nRobbed in Chicago\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 11 1908\n\nJohn Borchardt of Watertown was robbed of a wallet containing $975 by pickpockets on a West Madison street car while returning to the home of relatives at 597 Homan Avenue from the stock show in Chicago last week. He formerly worked at the meat market of Nowack & Meyer in West Main Street [223 W Main, Watertown] and is at present stopping at R. Woelffer's in this city [Robert Woelffer ran a boarding house at 717 W Main]. His overcoat pocket was cut with a knife and the pocketbook containing the money taken therefrom. He had been conducting a meat market in Chicago and had recently sold his interest to his partner.\n\nPublic School No. 2 / Lincoln School\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 11 1908\n\nPublic School No. 2, about which we heard so much of late, was built 40 years ago. It has never been remodeled as some are inclined to think, but shortly after water works and sewage were introduced in this city, the old vaults in the rear of the school were condemned and toilet rooms provided for in the basement of the school. A small addition in front of the school was built to provide suitable entrance to these toilet rooms, but no alterations were made inside of the school other than changing the stairway. If the plans of the Board of Education are carried out, a school will be built to take the place No. 2 that will be a credit to the city, and a school large enough for many years to come, unless our city's population will increase faster than any of our people anticipate, and even should it do so, the plans of this school will be such that extra rooms can readily be added without in any way marring its exterior appearance or detracting from the interior arrangement. [School No. 2 was replaced by Lincoln School the following year; the 1909 Lincoln building was gutted by fire in 1946]\n\n↓ More on new Lincoln School↓\n\nWill Build New Public School\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 11 1908\n\nAt a regular meeting of the Board of Education held last Wednesday evening, the Board took official action to erect a public school in place of No. 2 School in the 4th ward. For several mouths past this matter has been discussed unofficially by the Board and members thereof have visited several of the new schools in Madison, seeking information of the latest school buildings, and have had architects Claude of Madison and Uehling of Milwaukee here looking over No. 2 school to ascertain if anything could be saved to the taxpayers by having it enlarged and remodeled. Both architects decided that it would be cheaper and better to build an entire new school building, hence on Wednesday night the Board passed preambles and resolutions deciding to build a new school on the same plans as the Doty School at Madison.\n\nThis is an eight room building for school purposes proper, including a kindergarten room, and besides, has a teachers' room, and in the large basement, a domestic science room and a manual training room. The building is heated by steam and its ventilating system changes the air every seven minutes. It is fitted out with all modern improvements, every room is well lighted and its sanitary features most carefully planned.\n\nThe building cost, complete with furniture, is $25,000. The Board of Education will present a communication to the city council at its next regular meeting requesting it to provide ways and means for raising the funds for the erection of this building. The taxpayers of Watertown in general are in favor of this new building, and we believe the council also and mayor are enthusiastic for the improvement. Plans and specifications will be drawn at once, and as soon as the ways and means are settled for the payment of the building, the contract will be let, and work commenced as soon as the weather will permit in the spring.\n\n↓ More on new Lincoln School↓\n\nLincoln School Plans Readied\n\nWatertown Gazette, 02 05 1909\n\nThe plans have been ready for some time for the new school house which the Board of Education contemplates building to take the place of the old one in the Fourth Ward, known as No. 2, which long since has outlived its usefulness.\n\nMany parents of children attending this school have for months past urged the necessity of a new school building, and the Board of Education has time and again been told that the State Board of Health would be called in to condemn the building if some action was not speedily taken for the erection of a new building. The Board has for months been at work formulating plans for a new building, after first having considered the question of enlarging and remodeling the old one, but two competent architects consulted by the board declared it would cost nearly as much to remodel the old one as to build a new oneand then it would only be a \"patched-up\" building. The new school building contemplated will accommodate about three-eighths more pupils than the old one, and the Board of Education, which has given this matter its close attention, declares the new building is just what the situation demands and for many years in the future will suffice the needs of that section of the city. At the meeting of the council last Tuesday evening the following communication was submitted:\n\nTo the Hon. the Mayor and Common Council of the City of Watertown, Wis.\n\nGentlemen: At a regular meeting of the Board of Education, Dec. 2, 1908, a resolution that it is necessary to erect a new school building in place of the present school building No. 2, in the Fourth Ward of this city, was unanimously adopted.\n\nThe probable cost of such proposed building will be thirty thousand dollars ($30,000). At a special meeting of said Board of Education January 21, 1909, the plans herewith submitted for your approval were duly adapted.\n\nThe material in said old school building may be used in the erection of a new school building, and it would be advisable to authorize and instruct said Board of Education to offer the same for sale in the call for sealed proposals for a new building to contractors, the proceeds which may be derived therefrom to be applied on the contract price for such new building.\n\nWatertown, Wis., Feb. 2, 1909. By order of the Board, Carl R. Feld, Clerk.\n\nThe matter was laid over for further consideration by the committees having the matter in charge.\n\nThe Board of Education is now ready to proceed in this matter and has been for some timeit is now up to the council to hurry the matter alongthe school board cannot be held responsible for further delay and the people must now deal with the City Council if this matter is not speedily disposed of.\n\nThe Board of Education believes the council should hold a special meeting forthwith and settle this matter. On this question The Daily Times of Wednesday evening says when it came up before the council Tuesday evening:\n\n\"The proposition for a new school to replace the present No. 2 school was debated and after all was said the matter was laid over for two weeks. It was evident that the members agree to disagree on the school question, but it would be much wiser it they got together on this point. A new school is badly needed and no patchwork will go with the city. But some of the aldermen evidently believe that they can play horse with the people and children's health. There should be no baby play in this matter. It is something which concerns the health of the children attending school. It can very easily be taken out of the hands of the school board and city council when a question of health is involved, which is the status of the matter at present.\"\n\nRobbed of Clothes and Money\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 11 1908\n\nLast Sunday night Frank C. Blakely, employed by the Southern Wisconsin Power Co. erecting towers for the electric cables in this vicinity, was robbed of clothing valued at $28.75 and $4.45 in money. He has been boarding at the Buena Vista House in North Fourth Street and had for a roommate, Wm. Daw, who was also employed by the power company. When he discovered his loss, he also found that Daw was missing, but it is not known whether he took Blakely's property or not.\n\nX Ray at St. Mary's Hospital\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 11 1908\n\nAn X-Ray machine has just been installed at St. Marys Hospital in this city. This machine adds greatly to the already fine equipment at St. Marys Hospital and the management are doing all in their power to make it the equal of any hospital in the state and in this good work are entitled to the hearty support of all our people.\n\nHook and Ladder Co.

Eaton.\n\nTelepah\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 18 1908\n\nEminent Critic Praises Work\n\nof Local Author\n\nIn answer to a request for an impartial criticism on his new book, entitled Telepah,\" Joseph A. Salick is in receipt of a communication dictated by Charles H. Cochrane, who has under his charge the department of literary revision of the Cochrane Publishing Co. of New York City.\n\nCochrane is noted as one of the most able and fair of literary critics. The Boston Globe says of him: \"Mr. Cochrane is well-known as a careful and a skillful manipulator of good English.\" Among many others endorsing Mr. Cochrane's abilities in this connection are The Washington Post, Boston Journal of Education, Review of Books, New York Times, New York World, Broadway Magazine, Van Norden Magazine, etc.\n\nIn reporting on the review Mr. Cochrane says, in part: \"This (Telepah) is an exceedingly strong production. It appeals to the very best class of readers, but goes away over the heads of the herd. One of the benefits to the author would be a recognition of his literary ability, giving him entrance to the best literary circles, and creating a demand for his work among high-grade magazines.\n\nIn view of this extraordinary splendid recognition and endorsement of \"Telepah by so eminent a literary critic and so undoubted an authority as Mr. Cochrane, Watertown, the birthplace of the author, will, through its citizens, undoubtedly extend to Mr. Salick the substantial encouragement which his literary work deserves.\n\nThe editor, who has read \"Telepah\" with absorbing interest, would suggest that our citizens individually purchase liberally the still remaining books of the first edition, and reserving a copy for themselves, use the remaining ones as holiday gifts.\n\nTelepah: A Dramatic Poem\n\nBy Joseph Aloysius Salick\n\nPublished by Press of the Times Pub. Co., 1907\n\n166 pages\n\nTELEPAH BOARD. Design on wood. Looks like someone spilled alphabet soup right in the center of this board from Salem, MA. Instructions on the back claim that the Telepah is \"a medium for the purpose of thought transference or materialization, and is believed to be one of the most successful and practical instruments for this purpose.\"\n\nCross Reference:Telepah, full text\n\nMrs. William Lister\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 18 1908\n\nThe old pioneers of Watertown are fast passing away and this week it is our sad duty to record the death of one of Watertowns oldest and most esteemed ladies, Mrs. Wm. Lister, who died at her home, 631 Milford Street, Friday evening, Dec. 11, 1908. She had been in poor health for over two years past, and gradually grew weaker till death relieved her. Deceased's maiden name was Sarah A. Johnson; she was born at Isington, England, July 12, 1831, and shortly after being married came to America in 1856, settling in this city, where she has ever since resided. No lady who has ever resided in Watertown was better known or better liked than was Mrs. Lister. She possessed a cheerful and frank disposition and all who knew her prized her dearly as a friend and neighbor.\n\nShe was a most charitable lady and ever strove to aid and assist all who were less fortunate than herself and her many good deeds have been the cause of much good in the world, hence it may be well said of her that she well and faithfully carried out the will of her Creator.\n\nShe was an old and esteemed friend of the editor, being one of the very first ladies and neighbors we met when coming to Watertown away back in November, 1861. During all the years since, from our childhood on, she has ever been our friend, and now that she has passed to the great beyond, we, with her many other friends, mourn her death as that of a true and faithful friend and neighbor.\n\nHer husband and four children, seven grandchildren and two great grandchildren survive her. Her children are: Mrs. Martha Weissert of this city, Mrs. G. J. Wilbur and W. E. Lister of Chicago, and Alfred P. Lister of Seattle, Washington. Monday afternoon at two o'clock her funeral took place from St Paul's Episcopal Church, and her remains were laid at rest in Oak Hill Cemetery. Among those from out of town . . .\n\nSaloon Back Rooms\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 18 1908\n\nNOTICE\n\nA person has written to me as the citys executive in which is described a most villainous offense which the writer alleges was actually committed in this city last Sunday night. The letter lacks the force it should have because it is without proper and identifying signature, but owing to its terrific impeachment of order, law and decency, it must be considered.\n\nFrom its nature, it appears to me as perhaps genuine [and] if so the writer has but one recourse and that is to acquaint the officials with the names of the alleged offenders and their alleged victim. If a bona fied charge, the law will be in behalf of such outraged person.\n\nOn the other hand, if the facts of this pitiful and prayerful anonymous letter is [are] not substantiated by some responsible person within a few days, it will be treated as a \"hoax.\"\n\nNow writer; be brave and make good but, if a joker, forever hold your silence.\n\nDecember 16, 1908\n\nYours truly,\n\nArthur Mulberger, Mayor.\n\nMayor Mulbergar has caused the above notice to be published, and it is hoped the matter complained of therein will be thoroughly sifted.\n\nThe Ietter referred to in the mayor's notice as read by him before the city council last Tuesday night. The writer says she is the mother of a young girl who came home last Sunday night in an intoxicated condition, and if what the mother says she told her is true, a crime has been committed that \"cries to heaven for vengeance.\" A committee of the retail liquor dealers association was before the council Tuesday night and its spokesman told the mayor that he understood things of an unsavory nature were being carried on in some saloon back rooms and they should be suppressed. The mayor appointed Aldermen Humphrey, Tetzlaff, Strauss, Hartwig and Klemann to confer with the saloon keepers committee on the subject and report at a special meeting Friday evening.\n\nNearly Killed by Electric Wire\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 18 1908\n\nLast Tuesday afternoon C. H. Pfeiffer of Milton, who has been but a short time employed here by the Watertown Gas and Electric Co., came near being killed while at work on an electric light pole in Western Avenue. He was working on a lead wire from the power house at the dam and he placed his arm on another wire, making a complete circuit, voltage of 2300 passing through his body. He was rendered unconscious and was held suspended from the wires. A fellow workman went to his rescue and jerked him from the wires. His hand and arm were terribly burned. At this writing it is thought he will recover from his injuries.\n\nPicture of D. W. Ballou\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 18 1908\n\nAn excellent life-size picture of D. W. Ballou, editor of The Watertown Democrat from 1854 to 1876, has recently been placed in the gentlemen's room at the public library. Mr. Ballou was one of the most noted editors in the west in his time, and articles from his paper were always read with a great deal of interest.\n\nFiremen's Ball\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 18 1908\n\nThe Phoenix Fire Co. will give a grand ball at Turner opera house on Saturday evening, January 30, 1909, to which the public is cordially invited. Tickets 50 cents. A good time is promised all who attend.\n\nRed Cross Stamps\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 18 1908\n\nEin Watertowner Soll Immer Dabei Sein\n\nIn the American National Red Cross campaign against tuberculosis Wisconsin is doing her part. And Watertown is a credit to the state. Let all native sons of Watertown, far and near, make an effort to maintain this enviable reputation. This city has, up-to-date, had a consignment of 8,000 Red Cross stamps, of which number 2,000 have been sold outright.\n\nHelp the good work along. Elsewhere in this issue we publish an interesting article on this subject from The Ladies Home Journal. It should be read by all patrons of The Gazette.\n\nThe Saturday Club has pledged itself for 1,000 stamps. The Board of Education sanctions this movement and 1,400 stamps have been placed in the schools. The teachers are glad to interest the children in this charity, because of its educational value, realizing that an evil of this kind can best be stamped out through the younger generations.\n\nOur neighbor, Johnson Creek, goes on record for 1,000 Red Cross stamps in one day, for three leading producers.\n\nNotice to Subscribers\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 18 1908\n\nSubscribers to The Gazette are earnestly requested to keep in mind the regulations of the post office department regarding newspapers and keep their subscriptions paid up. While the amount of annual subscriptions is a small item to the subscriber, it is of considerable importance to the publishers under the present rule of the government.\n\nChristmas No Fast Day\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 18 1908\n\nAlthough Catholics are expected to observe every Friday as a fast day they will not be called upon to abstain from meat on Friday, Dec. 25, as that is Christmas day. Through all the centuries when Christmas has fallen on Friday, a general dispensation for a feast day has been granted. New Year's Day will be observed as a fast day, however.\n\n↓ More on New Years Day fasting↓\n\nCatholics May Eat Meat New Years Day\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 01 1909\n\nThroughout the entire world on Friday next, New Year's day, Catholics may eat meat, the pope having granted a special dispensation on that day. Notice of said dispensation was read in all the Catholic churches last Sunday.\n\nBranch Undertaking Parlor\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 18 1908\n\nBrooks & Boyle, the West Main Street undertakers, have opened a branch of their business in that line at Waterloo. They are experts in the undertaking business and any one in Waterloo or vicinity requiring their services will find them first-class people to deal with.\n\nSold Bowling Alleys\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 18 1908\n\nJohn C. Gruel has sold his bowling alleys in Madison Street [202-204, where M&I Bank is today] to Edw. Schultz, traveling salesman for Wiggenhorn Bros. Mr. Gruel contemplates locating on the Pacific coast.\n\n↓ More on bowling↓\n\nState Bowling Tourney\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 25 1908\n\nGreat Interest in Meet\n\nWatertown will enter three and possibly five teams in the state bowling tourney, which will be held here next month, according to John Gruel, the well known Watertown knight, who was in Milwaukee yesterday visiting Secretary Woodbury of the Wisconsin State Bowling Association.\n\n\"Interest in the tourney is at a fever heat in Watertown,\" said Gruel, \"and I expect that at least three teams will enter. Several other bowlers are also talking of coming so it is not unlikely that five teams will represent Watertown. The game is booming out there and tourney prospects look especially bright.\"\n\nCharles F. Moll, president of the Wisconsin-Illinois Baseball league and a former official of the state bowling association, who has just returned from a trip around the state, says that the tourney is attracting attention all over Wisconsin. \"The bowlers all over the state are talking of the event,\" said Matt, \"and if a record is ever to be established, now is the time. [Milwaukee Sentinel, Dec 18]\n\nAt the Water Works Station\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 25 1908\n\nThere is a rumor current that the report of the Water Works Commission will show marked progress in more ways than one. The amount of water pumped was enormous on account of the Van Camp Company taking such large quantities, perhaps $300.00 worth each month, and it is claimed that the saving in fuel amounts to four-fifths of a cent less on each 1000 gallons pumped as compared with the work done at the pumping station the year preceding the management by Albert Donner. We await the arrival of matter to be published concerning progress at the pumping station, and hope that rumors of economy there are true, for we are informed that all the employees in the water works department have been very watchful.\n\n↓ More on Water Works Station↓\n\nImprovements at the\n\nCity Water Works Plant\n\nWatertown Gazette, 03 05 1909\n\nSince it has become an open secret, as well as a patent fact, that there has been notable improvements going on at the water works plant during the past year, we frequently hear words of approval on every hand; not a few who have noticed minor matters for several months, now recall little incidents that would have gone by practically a dead letter or unnoticed. In several places water pressure gauges have been put on and there has been no disposition to growl if taxpayers and firemen desired to know if the pressure was up to the point promised or required; all are satisfied that the men at the pumping station do not go to sleep or neglect their duty.\n\nThe great saving in fuel may in some way explain why the large, dense volume of black smoke has been cut down. It belched forth from the chimney years ago in quantities large enough and for periods long enough when the wind was right to completely envelop a long train of freight cars; and would the writer be wide of the mark in saying that it was as safe to walk upon. We opine that one could have ambulated thereof as safely as on the grimy black clotheslines in the neighborhood, in other words it cast a gloom that shrouded our beautiful city in streaks of darkness, after causing taxpayers not inclined to be profane to disobey the commandment \"Thou Shalt Not Swear.\" This, it is safe to say, was not confined to the breadwinner alone, but to the housekeeper as well.\n\nNow that the men who ride the hose wagons praise the pressure, and that the amount of water pumped was increased thirty-two million gallons last year, and to help this along the fuel saved has amounted to nearly $500, resulting in cutting down the smoke fully one-half, we would very naturally infer that the boys in charge of the pumping plant have done their best and arrived at the end of the rope.\n\nHowever, if there is any opening to go farther with this good work, that meets with the hearty approval of our trusty city officials, and residents in general, we are of the opinion, that it would be a mistake to block the way of progression or improvement in the plant at the foot of First Street, and that the ones on the city pay rolls employed therein should be applauded for past efforts, and encouraged if they can go further with improvements.\n\nNot a murmur of disapproval have we heard of the above action of the City Council on Jan. 19th when the pay of employees at the power house was raised and it is on record that \"sober and reliable men\" are at the helm.\n\nDuring the year past water was pumped for 2 and 67-100 cents per 1000 gallons; under former management it cost 3 and 37-100 cents per 1000 gallons.\n\nWhen Mr. Donner took charge at the plant the boilers were badly \"scaled,\" or in other words the incrustations on the flues were so thick and heavy that the distance between the flues had been closed so much as to hardly admit of the passage of a lead pencil between them. Therefore the cutting down of the coal bills might perhaps be charged up to the removal of incrustations and careful firing, which means better combustion; resulting invariably to less dense, black smoke, thereby reducing the fuel expense as well as the dirt, soot, work, worry and waste.\n\nMr. Donner has proven to our people that he is not and does not intend to be one of the swivel-chair breed of hybrids who sometimes travel on a record that might have been incubated at or near Paducah, Kentucky. The hammer heads and yellow hammers will have something to do to keep up with our superintendent and his aides at the waterworks.\n\nHorse Shot\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 25 1908\n\nDuring the noon hour on Monday a team of horses owned by John C. Schumann, who resides east of this city, became frightened by a street car while they were standing in front of Neuman & Kerr's commission store in West Main Street [217-219 W Main] and ran away. The driver was about to get in his rig when an interurban car came from the west and the horses whirled around and ran east, running into Val. West's sleigh in front of Kusels' Hardware store and making a wreck of it; they continued east and ran with great force against an iron post of the street car company on Main Street bridge and finally came to a halt on the Merchant's National Bank corner, where they ran into another iron post, one of the horses breaking its leg. In order to relieve it of its misery Chief of Police Block shot it. The horse was valued at $150.\n\nOut-Door Art Association\n\nWatertown Gazette, 12 25 1908\n\nA meeting of the Out-Door Art Association was held at the Public Library last Wednesday evening. President H. Wertheimer presided and Supt. P. Roseman awarded the prizes. The report of the committee on out-door art prizes was as follows:\n\nTo the Officers and Members of the Watertown Out-Door Art Association:\n\nYour committee appointed to pass judgment upon the work of contestants for prizes offered for best work done in beautifying unsightly places beg leave to report that on or about June 20 they visited twenty two sites and that Sept 19 or a few days later they again visited the same sites for the purpose of deciding upon the best work done.\n\nThe committee was surprised at the results achieved and it is after careful consideration, point by point, that a decision has been reached.\n\nTo Reginald Humphrey, ten years of age, has been awarded first place, because he effected the greatest transformation. His grounds at 602 Lafayette Street were in a crude statesome parts even uglyand out at them he evolved an attractive surrounding, suggestive of beauty.\n\nGerhardt Trachte, 813 Third Street, is awarded second place because his work was specially good in design. It could almost rank with that of a professional landscape gardener in this particular.\n\nArthur Krebs, fourteen years of age, improved upon and rounded out his work of last year so that this year his grounds at 217 Seventh Street could be called beautiful. To him is awarded third place.\n\nAdolph Stiemke is entitled to fourth place because of the unity and harmony in this work. His work is a good example of what the society intended to accomplish by offering a prize, viz: to make and keep beautiful a spot whose utility is a necessity.\n\nHerman Kohlbry, 511 North Church Street, also had much to overcome in the way of necessary hindrances, but showed considerable ingenuity in overcoming them and presented an attractive back yard, as well as an improved lawn and boulevard. To him is given fifth place.\n\nAt Ellsworth Millers 302 Ninth Street we found a model back yard in regard to neatness; the result of persistent and careful attention. To him is given sixth place.\n\nThe committee also wishes to make honorable mention of John Keck, 800 Second Street; Freddie Wolf, 512 North Montgomery Street; Arthur Buege, 706 Market Street; Fred Hollenbeck, 408 Washington Street, and Harold Cruger, 416 Washington Street, all of whom worked well and did their part toward beautifying our city\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nIdaline Stone,\n\nElla Wilder,\n\nWilliam J. Stuebe.\n\nChristmas Day 1908\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 01 1909\n\nChristmas was an ideal day in Watertown in every respect. The weather was delightful and everybody seemed to be happy and well provided for. There are very few real poor people in our city and the few that are here were well provided for by charitably inclined people. Large congregations attended the religious services, and special musical programs were rendered at all the churches - the music at St. Bernards, St. Henry's, St. Paul's, St. John's, St. Mark's and the Congregational churches being particularly good.\n\nChristmas Celebration Cancelled\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 10 20 1993\n\nWatertowns annual Old-Fashioned Christmas parade and holiday kickoff celebration has been cancelled, according to Jack Erdmann, executive director of the Watertown Area Chamber of Commerce, sponsor of the event. The parade has been cancelled because of a lack of a chairman to oversee the parade which has been the main event of the celebration, Erdmann explained. We are disappointed that no one would step forward to chair or co-chair the parade this year, but a few people have expressed interest in doing it next year, he said, adding that he did not feel a change in date had any bearing on the lack of a chairman. Old-Fashioned Christmas celebration has traditionally been held on the first Sunday of December, but last year the parade committee decided to change the date to the last Sunday of November.\n\nCinch Party\n\nWatertown Gazette, 11 20 1908\n\nA large crowd attended the cinch party at St. Henry's school hall last Monday evening given by the Young Ladies' Society of St. Henry's Church. Frank Kehr, Leo Koser and Frank Butzler were awarded the prizes.\n\nEMS Contracts\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 10 20 2008\n\nA resolution entering EMS contracts with the villages of Lowell and Reeseville will be on the agenda of the council. The 2009 contract with Lowell is for $5,708 and the contract with Reeseville is $11,254.\n\nThe Watertown Fire Department will provide EMS coverage to Reeseville and Lowell by providing one ambulance staffed with two firefighters or paramedics.\n\nAll patients, except those who are critically ill or injured, will be taken to Watertown Regional Medical Center.\n\nIn the event that the fire department is committed to previously received requests for service and is unable to respond, mutual aid agencies will be contacted and dispatched to the call. These circumstances would not be considered a breach of contract.\n\nSchool Breakfast Program\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 10 18 1998\n\nHalf of the schools in the Watertown Unified School District participate in the federally subsidized school breakfast program and, by the end of the year, all are expected to take part. Three elementary schools in the district and the middle school have breakfast programs, food service supervisor Armando Martinez said. On Monday, Watertown High School will join the initiative. The remaining three elementary schools are expected to begin programs before the end of the school year, he added.\n\nDoug Dupre\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 10 17 1983\n\nDoug Dupre knew he was doing the right thing back in May when he turned over an envelope of money to San Francisco police. Being honest has now paid off for the Maranatha Baptist Bible College sophomore. He received a check this week for about $6,400 for the unclaimed cash. Dupre discovered the booty on the bus trip home from school last spring. After his first year of college here, Dupre boarded a bus the evening of Friday, May 27, for what would normally be an uneventful trip across country. The mundane turned exciting when Dupre heard a man, who boarded with another in Salt Lake City, crying about a lost envelope. He says the pair were trying to scare the people on the bus with their yelling, but never mentioned the brown paper envelope contained money. Dozing off to sleep like other passengers, Dupre woke early Monday, May 30, and decided to clean up. That's when he found the package next to his shaving kit.\n\nPolka Fanatic\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 10 17 1998\n\nA Watertown man who has been keeping time with the polka since discovering his talent as a youngster is still going strong after more than two decades. Merlin Schwartz has been living the life of a musician while working a day job and raising seven children with his wife, Betty, since he was 21 years old. Along with his family, which now includes 16 grandchildren, it's the polka he loves. The strong, steady beat of Wisconsin's state song seems to follow him everywhere. It's in the background when he talks on the telephone. It plays in his kitchen and echoes through the walls of his Meadow Street home. He even carries four cases of polka tapes with him on the road as a salesman for Berres Brothers Coffee of Watertown.\n\nEd Rindfleisch\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 10 14 1958\n\nAt the plenary board meeting of the Bethesda Lutheran Home Association this morning, Dr. Otto F. Dierker, board member for the last 15 years and board president for the last 10 years, announced his retirement. Dr. Dierker was an eye, ear, nose and throat specialist in Watertown for 29 years, having retired from active practice in December, 1953. Since his retirement, Dr. Dierker has been active in representing the cause of the Bethesda Lutheran Home at conventions throughout the U.S. and Canada.\n\n↓ More on Bethesda↓\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 10 16 1958\n\nThe Bethesda Lutheran Home Association in its annual meeting Oct. 21 elected as its new president Ed Rindfleisch of Jefferson, well known in Watertown business circles through his association with the local Rindfleisch Farm Hatchery Store. Until yesterday he was the secretary of the association and a member of the plenary board. He succeeds Dr. Otto F. Dierker who announced his retirement earlier this week.\n\nGoes to Sheboygan\n\nProf. W. P. Roseman Elected School Superintendent\n\n03 31 1916\n\nProf. W. P. Roseman of LaCrosse, formerly of Watertown, was elected superintendent of the public schools of Sheboygan last week at a special meeting of the board of education, and will assume the duties of his office as soon as he can arrange his private affairs. Prof. Roseman is a native of Wisconsin, and has given practically all of his life to educational work. He is a graduate of the state normal school at Platteville and of the University of Wisconsin and has done extensive graduate work in both the Universities of Wisconsin and Chicago, especially along the lines of vocational training. He served as superintendent of the public schools of Reedsburg for six years and at Watertown for seven years.\n\nWisconsin Telephone Co.\n\nExpansion Plans\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 10 23 1958\n\nReports which have been in circulation for some time relative to expansion plans of the Wisconsin Telephone Co. for Watertown, including introduction of a dial system, were revealed to members of the City Council at their committee meeting yesterday afternoon. The company revealed plans for construction of an addition to its present building which is directly west of the Market Street parking lot. In order to carry out such a plan the company would need the parking lot and has offered to purchase it from the city. The addition would conform in color and design with the present building and would be two stories high. It would be approximately 100 by 100 feet.\n\n↓ More on parking lot matter↓\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 11 06 1958\n\nCouncilman George Shephard said this morning that he believes the City Council will give favorable consideration to any proposal the Wisconsin Telephone Co. presents to the City Council relative to the proposed purchase of the Fifth Street parking lot for future expansion purposes by the telephone company. The plan for a 100 by 100 building addition to the present telephone building, which adjoins the lot, was conveyed to the Council at a recent meeting but a definite plan and proposal are still to be given the councilmen.\n\n↓ More on parking lot matter↓\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 11 14 1958\n\nThe property of St. Luke's Lutheran Church in North Fourth Street, running through to North Fifth Street, is one of the sites that has been proposed as an alternate city off-street parking lot to take the place of the South Fifth Street lot in the event the latter is purchased by the Wisconsin Telephone Co. to enable the utility to carry out its recently announced expansion program. That was reported to the City Council last night by the City Plan Commission which has been making a preliminary survey of possible sites to replace the present parking lot.\n\n↓ More on parking lot matter and St. Lukes↓\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 01 06 1959\n\nThe Wisconsin Telephone Co. failed to have a representative at yesterday afternoon's City council committee meeting to outline a proposal relative to replacing the South Fifth Street parking lot in the event it is sold to the company for its announced expansion program. City manager C C. Congdon in his letter to the Council outlining the agenda for discussion had stated that the company representative would be present. But he did not appear and as a result the Council did not get information for which it has been waiting.\n\n↓ More on parking lot matter and St. Lukes↓\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 01 23 1959\n\nIt was announced today at the office of City Manager C. C. Congdon, that the Wisconsin Telephone Co. now plans not to begin expansion work on its Watertown facilities until about April of 1960. The telephone company is seeking to purchase the present South Fifth Street parking lot from the city for its expansion project. Since it does not propose to begin expansion until 1960, the company will have ample opportunity to prepare plans and specifications for a new parking lot which it proposes to furnish the city on the present St. Lukes property in North Fourth Street.\n\n↓ More on North Fourth Street parking lot matter↓\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 09 01 1960\n\nInformal negotiations for at least two more property purchases to eventually extend the parking facilities in the North Fourth Street parking lot, recently opened, have been underway here. One involves the Grabow property, north of the present lot, fronting on North Fourth Street, and the other is the Hesse property in North Fifth Street. Prices have been secured on both properties and Councilman George Shephard is preparing to bring the matter into the open at next week's council meeting. The Grabow property would permit the extension of Madison Street through to North Fifth Street.\n\n↓ More on North Fourth Street parking lot matter↓\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 10 08 1960\n\nIndications are that nothing further will be done, at least for the time being, on the question of acquiring a North Fourth Street property and a North Fifth Street property in order to extend Madison Street from North Fourth to North Fifth Streets. At this week's council meeting, the council was informed that the price tag on the Theodore Grabow property, located at 123 North Fourth Street, is $15,000 and the tag on the John Hesse property, located at 120 North Fifth Street, is $14,000, making a total of $29,000. This report, made by Acting City Manager Glenn Ferry disclosed that both property owners were willing to enter into a 90 day option at these figures, on the condition that they could retain the properties until July. The price, in each instance, far exceeds assessed valuation.\n\n1858 Tax List\n\nWatertown Democrat, 12 30 1858\n\nTreasurers Notice. Notice is hereby given that the Tax List of the city of Watertown for the year 1858 has been delivered to me for collection, and that taxes on personal property must be paid within twenty days from the first publication of this notice, to wit: the 23d day of December instant, and taxes and assessments or real estate before the fourth Monday of January next and that all tracts and parcels of land specified in such tax list upon which the taxes and assessments shall not be paid by that day will be sold at the office of the City Treasurer on Second Street, in said city, commencing on Monday, the 24th day of January next, at 10 oclock a.m., and continuing from day to day until all of said lands are sold. D. S. Chadwick, City Treasurer. December 13, 1858.\n\nMr. Cyrus Whitney\n\nWatertown Democrat, 01 06 1859\n\nBARN BURNING. Last Thursday night, the 23d inst., about 7 oclock, the barn of Mr. Cyrus Whitney, whose farm and residence lies about a mile south of this village, was discovered to be on fire. The barn being filled with hay, corn stalks and unthrashed rye, burned with fearful rapidity and in less than two hours it was a smoldering heap of ruins. It was supposed to be the work of an incendiary and suspicion was at once fastened upon a man named Patrick Tearney, a day laborer upon the Wisconsin Central Railroad, who had, prior to the barn burning, boarded at Mr. Whitneys house, where a difficulty arose between Patrick and his wife, which resulted in his expulsion from the house and his wife being retained as a servant by Mrs. Whitney. Patricks treatment of his wife was of so gross a nature that the sympathies of Mr. Whitneys family were enlisted in her behalf, and upon two occasions, when her husband came to annoy her, he was forcibly thrust out of doors. Patrick, not relishing the unceremonious treatment, made threats of having satisfaction upon Mr. Whitney, which resulted in his being arrested upon suspicion. He was examined before Justices Bird and Savage last Thursday; District Attorney Hall on part of the State and Daniel F. Weymouth, for defendant. The testimony for the defense all tended to show the Patrick was home on the night of the fire, which was about three-fourths of a mile from Mr. Whitneys barn. He was accordingly acquitted.\n\nThere is no doubt but that the barn was set on fire by some evil-disposed person, as no one belonging to the farm had been near the barn later than between five and six oclock. The loss sustained in barn and produce cannot be less than $1,000. Mr. George L. Chaplin, who owns the farm adjoining Mr. Whitney, had 159 bushels of barley stored in the barn, which was also burned up.  Jeffersonian of the 30th inst.\n\nDebate on Spiritualism\n\nWatertown Democrat, 01 06 1859\n\nTo the Editor of the Watertown Democrat:\n\nA few evenings since, the following resolution was laid before the Young Mens Association of this city for discussion:\n\nResolved, That Modern Spiritualism is contrary to Nature and Revelation.\n\nAt first it was accepted and arrangements were made to debate the question involved, but for some reason best known to themselves the majority have seen fit to back out after the opposite party had engaged a gentleman from abroad to meet them. Notwithstanding this rather cool and unfair treatment the resolution will be discussedat least one side of itnext Tuesday evening, January 11th, at Coles Hall, by Ira Porter, Esq., of Waukegan, Illinois, at which time if there are any who feel disposed to express their views on this question they will have an opportunity to do so. A special invitation is extended to the clergymen of this city to come and hear Mr. Porter. The lecture will be free. All who may dissent from the opinions promulgated will be at liberty to refute them if they can. There will be no choking or dodging. The doctrines of Modern Spiritualism are either true or falseit is the fact that is wanted, no matter what it is or where founded.\n\nINVESTIGATION.\n\nJanuary 5th, 1859\n\n↓ More on Spiritualism ↓\n\nWatertown Democrat, 01 27 1859\n\nTo the Editor of the Watertown Democrat: Dear SirA kind friend has transmitted to me your published notice of my late effort in Watertown to demonstrate that Modern Spiritualism is not contrary to Nature and Revelation and has requested me to reply through your paper. I desire to make no reply further than to thank you for the tone and temper of your criticism. You have good naturedly given me credit for sincerity and the formation and expression of my opinions on that occasion and have dismissed me with the very harmless brandA HUMBUG. This is a concise and easy way of disposing of the subject and I am pleased with it because it gives me reason to infer, from the fact that that epithet had been applied to other men on the occasions and proved harmless, that in this case also you knew it would do no hurt. If you had turned up your hypocritical nose and cried humbug with an air of seriousness I should have been half displeased with the imputation, but the style in which you wielded that harmless old weapon is as much to sayMr. Porter, you know my bread and butter requires that I must thrash you a littleI hope you will excuse me while I call you A humbug.\n\nIra Porter / Waukegan, January 15th, 1859.\n\nRev. Mr. Kaltenbrunn\n\nWatertown Democrat, 01 06 1859\n\nDWELLING HOUSE BURNED. Last Thursday night, the 30th ult, about three miles south on Jefferson Road, the dwelling of Rev. Mr. Kaltenburn [Kaltenbrunn], pastor of the Moravian Church, was entirely destroyed by fire. We have not learned whether any contents were saved or whether it was insured.\n\n1958 Watertown High Football Squad\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 10 27 1958\n\nFrank Schmitt, aggressive tackle and linebacker, has been named most valuable player on the 1958 Watertown High School football squad and the four seniors on the club, Ralph Krueger, Tom Justman, Joe Rhodes and Schmitt were elected co-captains at a squad meeting.

Manager awards went to Dick Plenge, Dick Leiknes, Al Krause and Tom Hornickle.\n\nMarket and Emmet Street Bridge Proposed\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 10 27 1983\n\nA proposal to reroute east-west through traffic in downtown Watertown from Main Street onto Madison and Market streets received mixed reviews during a public informational meeting and hearing Wednesday before the Community Development Committee. The plan was developed by the committee with professional assistance from the Madison engineering firm of Donahue and Associates. Major projects include construction of a bridge over the Rock River connecting Market and Emmet streets and extension of Market Street east to Main Street through purchase of all or portions of properties at 115 and 205 College Avenue and 921 Main Street. [File on bridges]\n\n↓ More on Proposed Market and Emmet Street Bridge↓\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 02 21 1984\n\nFailing to receive a single vote, plans to begin design work on a Rock River bridge connecting Market and Emmet streets were scrapped Tuesday night by the Watertown Common Council. In addition, the council rejected a resolution authorizing plans on the development of a one-way loop system using Market and Madison streets. The loop system would have used Market Street as the eastern route from First Street to about Tenth and Main streets through the purchase of all or portions of properties of 115 and 205 College Avenue and 921 Main Street.\n\nChief Reviews Work of Fire Department\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 10 28 2008\n\nWatertown Fire Chief Henry Butts talked about the current role of the city's fire department during the seventh annual state of the community luncheon sponsored by the Watertown Area Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Watertown Fire Department is responsible for providing fire and emergency medical services to the entire city of Watertown and portions of the townships of Emmet, Milford, Shields and Watertown. The fire department also provides emergency medical services to the villages of Lowell and Reeseville. The entire area the fire department supplies services to is approximately 101 square miles. The fire department responded to 2,083 calls in 2007.\n\nThe Watertown Fire Department also provides a number of other services, including paramedic intercepts and mutual aid responses. The fire department only responds to vehicle crashes in the city that include injuries or creates a hazardous situation.\n\nThe fire department has a budget of $2,186,348 in 2008, which is up about $21,000 from 2007's total of $2,165,587.\n\nAs of Nov. 14, The Watertown Fire Department will consist of a fire chief, five assistant fire chiefs, 24 full-time firefighters or paramedics and 15 paid on-call firefighters.\n\nThe firefighters and paramedics work 24-hour shifts, averaging 56 hours per week. They come in at 7 in the morning and they go home 7 o'clock the next morning.\n\nThe training division handles the monthly training for the full-time and paid on-call firefighters and the goal for each firefighter is 20 training hours per month.\n\nThe fire department also provides several fire prevention and public education programs, which includes station tours, school visits, fire prevention contests and presentations of the Survive Alive House, a miniature dwelling built on a trailer that gives students the opportunity to practice lessons they learned from a brief, prior lecture.\n\nFirefighter/Paramedic Jim Acker also took some time during the luncheon to discuss the duties of Watertown Professional Firefighters IAFF Local 877, the union that represents the city's fire lieutenants and full-time firefighters. Acker, who serves as the group's president, said the Watertown Professional Firefighters IAFF Local 877 is run like any business and its members conduct a meeting every month.\n\nComplete article on Watertown Daily Times website:\n\nhttp://wdtimes.com/articles/2008/10/28/news/news2.txt\n\nRich Block\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 11 01 1998\n\nHORICON - Six new inductees were admitted to the Rock River Baseball League Oldtimer's Association Hall of Fame Saturday. Rich Block of Watertown was recognized for more than four decades of work with the Watertown Cardinals. If it weren't for Rich Block, I don't think that there would be much baseball in Watertown, said banquet emcee Will Eske.

Beverly Enterprises, a California-based firm that operates many nursing homes in the Midwest, has owned Skilled Care since May 1982. Schroeder said the employees suggested the name change, and, along with residents of the facility, petitioned Beverlys Northern District office for the change. The residents and employees selected the name in a vote, said Schroeder. The nursing home at 122 Hospital Drive is undergoing a $60,000 redecorating project. The entire facility, including patients rooms, the lobby, restrooms and dining room, will get new paint, carpet and wallpaper.\n\n↓ More on Beverly Terrace↓\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 11 05 1983\n\nOur main goal is to make Beverly Terrace as much like home as possible. Our environment is different here but there are lots of things we can do to make our residents feel as at home as possible, stated Duane Floyd, new administrator of the skilled care nursing home facility. Floyd, who became administrator of the 130-bed home a month ago, has several programs in mind to enhance the homey atmosphere. A $175,000 remodeling project is underway and will be completed early in 1984. An open house for the public will be scheduled when the remodeling is completed.\n\n↓ More on Beverly Terrace↓\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 09 14 2005\n\nBeverly Enterprises, of Fort Smith, Ark., owner and operator of Beverly Terrace Nursing Home, 121 Hospital Drive, of Watertown, is in the process of being sold.

Projected to be complete by August 2010.\n\nComplete article on Watertown Daily Times website:\n\nDr. Frederick Lemke's Legacy\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 05 26 2001\n\n[abstract] Dr. Frederick Lemke left in his will over $2.5 million to be used for scholarships for Watertown High School students.\n\nRuth Lemke, sister of Dr. Frederick Lemke was a treasure chest full of stories about herself and her brother, and especially the profound influence their parents had on them and their educational pursuits.\n\nThe vast majority of her brother's estate was given for the scholarship program to honor their parents, the Rev. F. W. and Ruth Lemke. Rev. Lemke was the pastor of what is now Watertown Moravian Church at Fifth and Cole streets. He served that congregation from 1912 to 1936 when he retired.\n\nReflecting on the large role their parents played in getting their children to understand the value of higher education, she told the group, \"I remember the many years of guidance and the vision we received from them. Our parents were committed to education.\" She said it was because of that commitment from her parents that her brother, Dr. Frederick, decided to leave the large estate for scholarships to Watertown High School students so they too could have quality educations.\n\nIn his early years Dr. Lemke was a paper carrier for the Watertown Daily Times, delivering newspapers in the North Fourth Street area. Later, at the age of 14, he worked at Village Blacksmith. By the time he graduated from Watertown High School in 1922 he was valedictorian of his class. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1926, and a year later received his Master of Arts degree, and by 1933 he had received his doctorate and began a lifelong career at Heidelberg College in Tiffin, Ohio. It was the college his father had recommended because of its quality education and religious connections.\n\n2001 scholarship recipients were Ellen Coughlin, Heidi Pennel, Roberta Massuch, Christopher Spoehr and Lance Fischer.\n\nThe Watertown Area Community Foundation, a tax exempt organization, is managing the Lemke funds.\n\nThe Lemke scholarship has eclipsed the Joseph E. Davies scholarship in both dollar value and number of awards.\n\nCatherine Eagen Called By Death\n\n-----\n\nPassed Away At Watertown\n\nLast Friday Morning, January 8, 1915\n\nMrs. Catherine Eagen, widow of the late Mr. William Eagen of the town of Shields, died at her home in Washington Street, Watertown, at 3:45 oclock last Friday morning. Death followed an illness with bronchitis of nine days duration, though she had been in failing health suffering from a general breakdown for the past three years.\n\nOnly one daughter and one brother of the immediate family survive, but her loss will be mourned by a large circle of friends who recognized those fine qualities of motherhood and womanhood which were hers and which made her one of the best loved women of the community.\n\nMrs. Eagan was born in New York City October 31, 1887. With her parents, the late Mr. and Mrs. John Driscoll, she came to this vicinity when in her tenth year. The family became pioneer residents of the town of Shields near the village of Richwood. She married Mr. William Eagen when she was 19 years of age, and had she lived until January 19, she could have celebrated the fifty-eighth anniversary of her wedding.\n\nThe home which herself and husband occupied was but a mile and a half from the home of her parents. Mr. Eagen died January 18, 1886. With her daughter, Miss Mary A. Eagen, Mrs. Eagen continued to reside on the farm for a few years, but in 1891 they moved to Watertown. The daughter survives as does one brother, Mr. John Driscoll, Peoria, Arizona.\n\nWilliam Eagen, the husband, who died in 1886, was a brother of Peter Eagen of Richwood and of the late Thomas Eagen of this city.\n\nThe funeral of Mrs. Eagen was held at St. Bernards Church, Watertown, last Monday morning, Jan. 11, 1915. Interment in St. Bernards Cemetery.\n\nDowntown Hours\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 11 13 1983\n\nBeginning Sunday, downtown merchants will be open on Sundays from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. year around. The decision was made earlier this week by the Downtown Watertown Business Association and is voluntary for each downtown business. Some individual stores will not be open on Sundays, but most retail outlets were receptive to the additional store hours. Expanding hours for businesses was done for several reasons. The first was to allow business people a better opportunity to shop. The association's vote to support more shopping hours was also based on national studies which indicate Sunday is one of the peak shopping times of the entire week.\n\nNew Tracks\n\nWatertown Daily Times, 11 13 1998\n\nBuilding railroads has always been slow, backbreaking work but it's becoming more efficient with the development of new technology in the past decade. Much of that new technology is at work in Watertown this week, as Canadian Pacific Railway installs new track from the city west to Columbus. The new track will allow for faster, safer and smoother runs for the approximately 20 cargo and passenger trains which use the rails each day. The old clickety-clack is gone, said Don McCall, project manager, as he watched an Amtrak train slowly roll by Tuesday afternoon. The railroad industry is changing. There's so much technology compared to 20 years ago.\n\nAmerican Red Cross - Watertown Chapter\n\n1943\n\nCOMMITTEE CHAIRMEN\n\nROLL CALL\n\nE. Chas. Doerr\n\nDISASTER\n\nG. H.

Martha Kelm, aged 15 years, skated into a hole nearby where Block went in and was rescued by her companions. There are so many holes under and around Main Street bridge and near the Masonic Temple in the ice that it is very dangerous to skate in that vicinity. The policemen have chased skaters away from these places time after time, and warning has been given in the newspapers but it seems to do no good and these are just the places some skaters like to be around. It would seem that they court danger, and do not fear death by the drowning route . . . Jack Peterson, a singer at the Lyric Theatre, skated into an opening in the ice near Main Street bridge last Tuesday morning and came near drowning. Charles A. Salick heard his cries for assistance and was the first on the scene to help rescue him. Frank B. Weber was also quickly on the scene and with the assistance of Joseph Hoeffler and R. H. Radtke they succeeded in rescuing the young man. He had a very narrow escape from a watery grave.\n\nWatertown City of Homes\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 01 1909\n\n\"Watertown is growing slowly but steadily,\" said F. E. Woodard at the Plankinton. \"There is no city in the state better situated for manufacturing than Watertown, and this fact has been recognized by the manufacturing interests. Labor is plentiful and steady employment appreciated. There are more people owning their own homes in Watertown than any other city in the state, or northwest, for that matter. The last census puts Watertown third in the list of cities of the country in that respect. Baltimore ranks first, the second city I do not remember, but we are third. More homes were built there last year than in any year before, which shows that the home spirit is not decreasing.\n\nThe time is not far distant when Watertown will become a great center for interurban traffic. With the extension of the interurban lines north and south, as planned by the Beggs interests, our city will become the junction point. Eventually a Iine will be built west to Madison, which will add to the importance of the city as a railroad center. That this will be of material benefit to the business interests has already been shown through the line which was built through from Milwaukee to Watertown. It brings business to the city, and when the other lines are built these benefits will be increased. Preparations are being made for the extension north, which will be built, I understand, as soon as franchises are secured. There is an opposition company in the field, but we favor the Beggs company, as we believe this promises the best for Watertowns interests. It looks now as though, when the census is taken in 1910, the city will have about 12,000 inhabitants, which is a satisfactory increase in the decade elapsing since the census of 1900.[Milwaukee Sentinel, Dec. 27]\n\nA Fine Orchestra\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 01 1909\n\nMonday evening a large audience was at Turner opera house to hear the famous Schildkret Hungarian Orchestra under the auspices of the Men's Club of the Congregational Church. The music furnished was of a high order and was greatly appreciated by all present. Three violins, a cello, a bass violin, piccolo, clarinet, flute and dulcimer constituted the orchestra, and each was an artist in his particular line.\n\nJohn B. Ratto, in character studies from life, on January 25th will be the last of the series of entertainments by the Men's Club.\n\n↓ More on Congregational Church↓\n\nRepeat Christmas Music\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 01 1909\n\nThe special musical program prepared by the choir of the Congregational Church and rendered with marked success last Sunday will be given again January 3 in the morning. Mrs. Feld will again sing the Message of the Angels. The three anthems contain solos by Miss Alma Feldschneider and Messrs. William Richards, Wolfram, Exner and John Schempf. At the vesper services at 4 p.m. the Junior Choir will repeat two anthems, which include several solo parts. Miss Alma Feldschneider will sing and Frank Sloan will contribute a violin solo. In the morning the pastor's subject is \"Time, a False Standard;\" in the afternoon the theme is \"If the New Year Were Your Last.\"\n\nJuvenile Band at Richwood\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 01 1909\n\nEd. Boch, William Thauer, Irving Schoeberle, Herbert Lange, Percy Volkert, Raymond Volkert, Winfield McCall, Francis McCall, Edward McCall, Vernon Etscheid, Raymond Carroll, Bennie Carroll, Freddie Ihde, Arthur Seibel, Oscar Lemmerhirt, Edw. Giese, Leo Zoellick, Theo. Hoefs and Oscar Hoefs have organized a juvenile band at Richwood, with Herbert Schroeder as instructor. Shortly after organizing, the band paraded around Richwood, headed by Peter Thauer, John Scheberle, John Carroll, H. F. Lange and F. J. McCall. H. F. Lange officiated as drum major and F. J. McCall as sergeant at-arms.\n\n↓ More on bands in Richwood↓\n\nOld-Time Richwood Band\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 08 1909\n\nThe Juneau Telephone of last week says:\n\nAnd once upon a time, in the dim and distant past, there was another band in Richwood. It was organized in 1869 or 1870, with Prof. John Miller of Watertown as instructor. The band consisted of twelve members, as follows: John Driscol, leader; Jerry Driscol, John Kelley, John Carroll, John McCall, William Hanley, Philip Riley, John Kerr, Henry Bergen, Michael Quinn, James J. Solon and Stephen White. The rehearsals, once or twice a week, were held in the old red school house at Richwood and the meetings were a source of considerable pleasure to the members, as they greatly relieved an otherwise monotonous life. The first time the band attempted to march and play, at the same time, there was a \"parting of the ways.\" The great feat was attempted at a picnic in Adam Schneider's grove. Each player had his eyes glued to his little book and, with red face and bulging cheeks, he proceeded on his journey over sticks, stones and logs. When the \"tune was finished two of the boys were in Norton's marsh, one fell down and the other nine were scattered through the brush, several rods apart. The marked feature of the selection were explosive notes caused by high stepping. Later on, however, the boys learned how to play some and in 1872 came right to the front in the Greeley campaign [Horace Greeley, an unsuccessful candidate for President in 1872]. About the year 1874, some of the original members began to drop out and others took their places. The organization continued to exist until the instruments were sold to the Sacred Heart College boys in Watertown about 1877 or 1878. Of the twelve original members, all are living except Bill Hanley, who died many years ago. John Discoll lives in Janesville, Jerry Driscoll resides at Superior . . .\n\nWilliam Williams\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 01 1909\n\nWilliam Williams has sold his 200 acre farm in the town of Emmet to his neighbor Christian Weisenberg, the consideration being $26,000. This is one of the finest farms in Wisconsin, and $130 an acre is certainly a fancy price. Mr. Williams will remove to this city about April 1st.\n\nPaul Thom's Dancing Social\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 01 1909\n\nA large crowd attended Paul Thom's dancing social at Turner opera house last Tuesday evening and as usual at Mr. Thom's socials all in attendance had a fine time. The music was fine and the dancing program a most excellent one.\n\nWilliam Zier\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 01 1909\n\nSeriously Injured. Last Tuesday at Fort Atkinson William Zier of this city was seriously injured. He was employed by the Dornfeld-Kunert Co., placing a fire escape on a building in that city and fell a distance of 18 feet to the ice on the river below where he was working. The same evening he was brought to his home in this city and it is hoped that he will shortly recover from his accident.\n\nFiremen Hold Meeting\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 01 1909\n\nAnchor Volunteer Hose Co.

All present pronounced it a delightfully pleasant social.\n\nCold Weather\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 08 1909\n\nTuesday reminded one of a balmy day in spring, and as the snow and ice melted the water ran in tiny brooks into Rock River, but within a few short hours that same evening the thermometer dropped to 24 below zero, and Wednesday we experienced one of the coldest days ever known in this vicinity. All day long Wednesday and Wednesday night the thermometer registered below zero and, at this writing, Thursday a.m., the mercury is still hovering around the zero mark. A change of over 75 degrees less in than 24 hours is the pace in the weather that kills the sickly and weak ones of the human race and almost freezes the marrow in the bones of the strongest mortal, and even the ice man exclaims: Hold, I have enough!\n\n↓ More on Winter of 1908-1909 ↓\n\nA Terrible Storm\n\nWatertown Gazette, 02 05 1909\n\nOne of the worst storms that has ever visited this section of the country set in here last Thursday night. It started with a strong wind, accompanied with wet snow and sleet and finally wound up with a terrific blizzard. Nearly two feet of snow fell during the night and the following day, and since then Watertown might well be styled the white city. Ice and snow stuck to everythingtrees, shrubbery, telegraph, telephone and electric light poles and wires, buildings of every description, fences and in fact everything out of doors, and the weather having remained cold for several days the winter scenes were charmingly beautiful. The scenes in the city park and on the West side of the river on Washington, Church and Montgomery streets were particularly grand. This is the pleasant side of the storm. Great damage was done throughout the city to trees and shrubbery of all kinds, the telephone and electric services. Over 400 telephones were put out of service for nearly a week, and for twenty-four hours the electric service was rendered useless. The rural mail service was badly crippled, only one carrier making his complete route on Friday. The Interurban railway service between Watertown and Milwaukee was at a standstill from Thursday evening till 6 o'clock Sunday evening, when a car was started from here to Milwaukee. Monday morning the street car tracks were cleared of ice and snow from the terminus at the C.&N.W. depot to the limits of the city, and the service is once more on schedule time. The fire alarm system is still demoralized and it will take some time before the lines can be repaired. From Thursday night till Monday morning the weather was quite severe, ranging from zero to 10 below.\n\nWright - Rogan\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 08 1909\n\nEdward L. Rogan and Miss Caroline R. Wright were married at 8 o'clock Thursday morning, January 7, 1909, by Rev. Father Schweitzer in the presence of a large number of friends and relatives. Charles Kehr and wife, brother-in-law and sister of the bride, attended them. After partaking of a wedding feast at the home of the bride's parents in [504] Clyman Street, the groom and his bride left on a brief wedding tour, at the conclusion of which they will return to this city. They will be at home to their friends after January 14th at 205 Church Street. The groom is manager of the Western Union Telegraph office in this city, and is a grandson of the late Hon. Patrick Rogan, one of Watertown's first citizens. He is one of Watertown's most esteemed young men and has secured for a bride an amiable and accomplished young lady. She is a daughter of Joseph Wright and wife, Clyman Street, and a member of one of Watertown's oldest and best known families.

Work on the garage will be commenced as early as possible in the spring. It will be 40x100 feet, two stories high. The company will handle the Rambler, the Mitchell and the Reliable Dayton machines. Mr. Roach was formerly a resident of Waterloo and while a resident of that village was elected in 1896 sheriff of this county, but for several years past he has been engaged in the automobile business in Milwaukee. Mr. Copeland has been for many years the C.&N.W.Ry. agent at Jefferson Junction, and is well and most favorably known hereabouts. Mr. Roach resides at 502 North Church Street.

The car was very simple to drive, and easy and cheap to repair. It was so cheap at $825 in 1908 (the price fell every year) that by the 1920s a majority of American drivers learned to drive on the Model T.\n\nFord created a massive publicity machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new product. Ford's network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in virtually every city in North America. As independent dealers, the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the Ford but the very concept of automobiling; local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to explore the countryside.

The Flyer was an automobile\n\nmanufactured by the Flyer Motor Car Company from 1913-1914.\n\nWatertown Gazette, 05 17 1923\n\nJim Spear took out a fliyer on the route Thursday. He has used the old nags in delivering mail for better than twenty five years and at last gave up the struggle and want to gas. Jim was the first mail carrier appointed from the Watertown post office and probably one of the first appointed in Wisconsin where rural delivery was instituted. The first delivery of rural mail in the United States was made from the post office at Sun Prairie as an experiment. Jim Spear took the only route from Watertown at that time which was known as number one up through the west side of the town of Emmet and later was transferred to number three. He is probably the oldest rural carrier in point of service in the United States. And he is not so awfully old at that.[Daily Times]\n\nThe editor of The Gazette hopes Jim Spear will live 25 more years, and live to enjoy his fliver on his rural route unless Uncle Samuel retires him on a good big pension. Jim is well liked by every man, woman and child on his route, and is especially liked by all the young ladies. He is thorough in his work, obliging to his patrons and is a regular encyclopedia of the route's doings, the past the present and on future events. During the Gazette editor's administration as postmaster in the Watertown post office there is nothing we enjoyed so well as a ride with Jim Spear over Jim's 27 mile routeit was a real treat and Jim kept one royally entertained from start to finish and at the same time never failed to call our attention to all the good and bad things on his route relative to the delivery of and collection of mail.\n\nWatertown Advancement Assn\n\nBanquet at New Commercial Hotel\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 08 1909\n\nOn Friday evening of this week the Watertown Advancement Association will hold a banquet at the New Commercial Hotel, at which a few from outside the city will be present. Aside from the banquet matters of general interest to the city will be discussed and means taken to still further advance our enterprising little city. The officers and executive committee of this association since its organization several years ago have done a great deal to advance the city's interests, and they have been ably assisted in their good work by the majority of our business men. It can be truly said that the Watertown Advancement Association has done more towards the welfare of its home town than any like association in the west. An annual event of the kind to be held at the New Commercial Friday evening would be a good thing and help to keep up an interest in the good work being done by the association.\n\n↓ More on Advancement Association↓\n\nMusic at Advancement Association Banquet\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 22 1909\n\nThe music rendered at the Advancement Association banquet at the New Commercial Hotel last week was furnished by Frank Bremer and Miss Edna Goeldner of this city, and John Heubner of Oconomowoc. It was thoroughly enjoyed by all present.\n\n↓ More on Advancement Association↓\n\nJohn I. Beggs Guest of Honor\n\nWatertown Gazette, 01 15 1909\n\nAN ELABORATE AFFAIR\n\nAdvancement Association Banquet at New Commercial Hotel\n\nJohn I. Beggs Guest of Honor\n\nThe Advancement Association of this city gave a banquet at the New Commercial Hotel last Friday evening, the guest of honor being John I. Beggs, president of the Milwaukee Heat, Light and Traction Co., 62 in all being seated at the banquet table. It was nearly 9:30 o'clock when all were seated at the table ready to partake of the good things prepared by Mrs. Brandenburg, the proprietor of this popular hotel. Nothing was left undone by her to make the affair a successin the parlor to the west of the dining room the Weber-Stube orchestra dispersed an excellent musical program during the progress of the banquet. The banquet room decorations were in red, white and blue, old glory occupying a conspicuous place to one side, and the table decorations were in green and red stringers of smilax being stretched the entire length of the two long tables and beautiful red and green shaded candelabra, with red and green candles, added beauty to the elegantly arranged tables. The menu served was delicious and the promptness with which one course followed the other was indeed a credit to the pretty waiters and the proprietor of the hotel. A better satisfied crowd of people never sat down to a banquet and all complimented Mrs. Brandenburg on its excellence. It would do credit to some of the famed caterers of the larger cities.\n\nWhen the inner man had been completely satisfied, then the flow of wit and reason followed. Ex-Mayor Herman Wertheimer, president of the Advancement Association, presided as toastmaster and certainly filled the roll well. Mayor Arthur Mulberger was the first to respond to a toast, and he eloquently referred to the building of the interurban railway into our city and extended a most hearty welcome to the guest of honor, John I. Beggs. Mr. Beggs responded, prefacing his remarks by saying:\n\nWhen a town is so provincial that it cannot see any benefits from a railway line, let it sleep and pass into the chaos which its people want. If a city is progressive, lines of railway will come and help it, but there is no inducement for capital to invest when the people oppose or obstruct. You may think this is only talk, but how many people in this section will put their money into it with all the franchises we have?\"\n\nHe stated that with proper encouragement from the citizens of Watertown, it would become the hub of a great system of interurban railways extending to all quarters of the compass. He called on the people of our city to get together on all questions tending to the city's welfare, cast aside all petty differences and success would certainly crown their efforts. He said a short time ago representatives of the Inter-County Fair called on him to ascertain if it were not possible to build the interurban railway this year as far south as the fairgrounds so that it could be of use in time for the 1909 annual fair. In response to this wish he said the railway would be built as far as the fairgrounds in time for the fair, but it seems there is a proviso attachedhe wants a right of way in Second Street south to the fairgrounds, and thence the line would be continued to Johnson Creek, Jefferson and Janesville, the old survey as granted by the franchise south in Montgomery Street to be abandoned.\n\nH. W. Heinrich, vice president of the M. D. Wells Shoe Co., was called on for a few remarks and he stated that Watertown is an ideal spot for factory purposes. He said his factory started here five years ago with about 37 employees and that now 178 find employment, and that in the near future the capacity would be doubled; that he never in all his experience found a more contended lot of workers . . . that whereas he did not get all he asked from the people in the way of financial encouragement, he was well satisfied with his treatment.\n\nShould Mr. Beggs not get all he asks, we hope he will be also well satisfied with his treatment, as we believe the rank and file of our people appreciate his efforts bringing his railway into our city and are willing to extend him every encouragement that does not tend to the detriment of the city.\n\nW. D. Sproesser, William F. Voss, Drs. Whyte and Werner, Fred Kusel, Gordon Bacon, H. G. Grube, Supt. W. V. Roseman and Gustav Buchheit also made a few interesting remarks. On the motion of Mr. Buchheit, J. I. Beggs and H. W. Heinrich were voted honorary members of the Watertown Advancement Association, the motion being carried by a rising vote"
