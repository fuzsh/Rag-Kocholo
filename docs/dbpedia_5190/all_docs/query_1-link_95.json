        "text": "Main Births etc\n\nGlens Falls is a city in Warren County, New York, United States and is the central city of the Glens Falls Metropolitan Statistical Area.[4] The population was 14,700 at the 2010 census.[5] The name was given by Colonel Johannes Glen, the falls referring to a large waterfall in the Hudson River at the southern end of the city.[6]\n\nGlens Falls is a city located in the southeast corner of Warren County, surrounded by the town of Queensbury to the north, east, and west, and by the Hudson River and Saratoga County to the south. Glens Falls is known as \"Hometown U.S.A.\", a title given to it by Look Magazine in 1944. The city has also referred to itself in the past as the \"Empire City.\"[7]\n\nHistory[]\n\nAs a halfway point between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry, the falls was the site of several battles during the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War. The then-hamlet was mostly destroyed by fire twice during the latter conflict, forcing the Quakers to abandon the settlement until the war ended in 1783. Fire also ravaged the village in 1864, 1884, and 1902.[7]\n\nThe area was originally called Chepontuc (Iroquois; \"difficult place to get around\"), also referred to as the \"Great Carrying Place,\" but was renamed \"The Corners\" by European-American settlers.[7] In 1766 it was renamed Wing's Falls for Abraham Wing – the leader of the group of Quakers who established the permanent settlement – and for the falls on the Hudson River. Wing's claim to the name of the falls and the hamlet was transferred to Colonel Johannes Glen of Schenectady in 1788, either on collection of a debt, as a result of a game of cards, or in exchange for hosting a party for mutual friends, depending on which local legend is believed.[6][7][8] Colonel Glen changed the name to \"Glen's Falls,\" though it was often printed with varying spelling such as \"Glenn's,\" or \"Glens\". The spelling \"Glens Falls\" came to be the common usage.[6]\n\nA post office was established in 1808.[7] Glens Falls became an incorporated village in 1839,[7] and was re-incorporated in 1874 and 1887, expanding the village to what would become the city limits[9] when the city charter was granted by the state legislature in 1908,[9] at which time the city became independent from the town of Queensbury.\n\nIn 2003, with permission from Queensbury,[10] Glens Falls annexed approximately 49 acres (0.198 km2) of the town. The land, known as Veterans Field[11] or the Northway Industrial Park, is on Veterans Road between Luzerne Road and Sherman Avenue[10] and is just east of I-87.[12] The land was vacant at the time.[10] A thin, 0.5 miles (0.80 km) strip of Sherman Avenue[13] was part of this annexation,[11] in order to comply with state law regarding contiguity of annexed land. Both the city and town share ownership of this stretch of highway as a result.[13]\n\nHistoric sites[]\n\nGlens Falls has two historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the equivalent New York State Register of Historic places. The Fredella Avenue historic district includes a series of unique concrete block structures. The Three Squares Historic District comprises the majority of the Central Business District.[14] In addition, several individual structures are listed, some below. Glens Falls does not have a local preservation law protecting these historic resources from demolition or alteration.\n\nCrandall Public Library – While the library has existed since 1893, it did not have its own permanent home until 1931, with the completion of the library building in City Park, on property willed to the library by local entrepreneur Henry Crandall. The building was designed by Charles A. Platt and built by Robert Rheinlander; it was renovated and expanded in 1969. Its first renovation and expansion since then was completed in November 2008, involving the demolition of the 1969 addition.[15][16] The library is a part of the Southern Adirondack Library System.\n\nCivil War Monument – A limestone obelisk located in the intersection of Glen, South, and Bay streets, the monument was dedicated in 1872 to honor the 644 men from Queensbury who served in the Civil War. Ninety-five names, those of the men who died, are engraved on the monument.[17] Many battles of the war are listed.\n\nDeLong House – Presently the home of the Glens Falls/Queensbury Historical Association and the Chapman Historical Museum. A Greek Revival and Second Empire edifice on the corner of Glen and Bacon Streets. A Queen Anne style carriage barn is part of the property.\n\nThe Feeder Canal– Across from this historic canal is a hydro-electric power-plant on the Hudson River at Glens Falls. The canal was created circa 1820 to feed water into the Champlain Canal. During the early 19th century, the New York State Canal System was crucial to the development of the state's economy. Lime, marble, lumber, and agricultural commodities were shipped from Glens Falls from the docks at the base of Canal Street.\n\nFirst Presbyterian Church - The congregation was chartered in 1803; its fifth house of worship was constructed in 1929. It was designed by Ralph Adams Cram in his \"presbyterian style\" of neo-gothic architecture.[18]\n\nFort Amherst Road – Located near this road is the site of the former Fort Amherst. The fort is no longer extant, but portions of the wood foundations were known as late as 1880. The fort constituted a block house marking the halfway point on the road between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry at the head of Lake George. This fort system, erected by the British, was built to secure the northern territories of the colony from incursions from the French during the French and Indian War. A restored fort house complex is available for viewing in the nearby town of Fort Ann.\n\nLouis Fiske Hyde House – The center among a triplet of revival-type residences constructed for the daughters of Samuel Pruyn by the architects Robert Rheinlander and Henry Forbes Bigelow, Hyde House currently houses The Hyde Collection, a world-class museum of European, American, and contemporary art. The principal collection is presented in its original domestic context as a private collection.\n\nThe Oldest Building in Glens Falls – In 1864 a massive fire destroyed most of buildings in the central business district. The oldest building in Glens Falls, located in the downtown area, is one of the few buildings in the city that predates 1864. The stone and brick structure at the bottom of the hill was erected circa 1815 and served as Calvin Robbin's blacksmith shop.\n\nQuaker Meeting House – The Quaker Meeting House, an Italianate edifice on Ridge Street, was built in 1875 and originally contained no heating system.\n\nSt. Mary-St. Alphonsus Regional Catholic School – formerly known as St. Mary's Academy, the school is located on the corner of Warren and Church streets. It is in the neo-Gothic style of architecture and designed by Ralph Adams Cram. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It features a Great Hall with a two-story stained glass window designed by Henry Lee Willett Studios of Philadelphia.\n\nA New York State historical marker referencing American Modernist painter Wilhelmina Weber Furlong was placed near City Hall in 2013, during the Warren County Bicentennial. Furlong spent about a decade at the end of her life living and teaching in Glens Falls.[19][20]\n\nGeography and climate[]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 3.9 square miles (10 km2), of which 3.8 square miles (9.8 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) (2.54%) is water.\n\nThe city is located on the Hudson River, in the Adirondack foothills, at the border of Saratoga County, New York.\n\nClimate data for Glens Falls, NY, 1981–2010 normals Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Average high °F (°C) 28.7\n\n(−1.8) 32.9\n\n(0.5) 42.6\n\n(5.9) 56.8\n\n(13.8) 68.2\n\n(20.1) 76.8\n\n(24.9) 81.1\n\n(27.3) 79.1\n\n(26.2) 70.8\n\n(21.6) 58.4\n\n(14.7) 46.6\n\n(8.1) 34.2\n\n(1.2) 56.4\n\n(13.6) Average low °F (°C) 8.9\n\n(−12.8) 11.2\n\n(−11.6) 21.6\n\n(−5.8) 33.9\n\n(1.1) 44.0\n\n(6.7) 53.4\n\n(11.9) 58.0\n\n(14.4) 56.4\n\n(13.6) 47.7\n\n(8.7) 36.4\n\n(2.4) 28.6\n\n(−1.9) 17.2\n\n(−8.2) 34.8\n\n(1.6) Precipitation inches (mm) 2.86\n\n(72.6) 2.08\n\n(52.8) 2.94\n\n(74.7) 2.98\n\n(75.7) 3.61\n\n(91.7) 3.55\n\n(90.2) 4.09\n\n(103.9) 3.68\n\n(93.5) 3.37\n\n(85.6) 3.50\n\n(88.9) 3.30\n\n(83.8) 3.05\n\n(77.5) 39.01\n\n(990.9) Avg. precipitation days (≥ 0.01 in) 11.6 9.4 10.7 11.3 12.6 12.0 11.0 10.9 9.3 10.8 11.4 11.3 132.3 Source: NOAA[21]\n\nDemographics[]\n\nHistorical populations Census Pop. %± 1850 2,717 — 1860 3,780 39.1% 1870 4,500 19.0% 1880 4,900 8.9% 1890 9,509 94.1% 1900 12,613 32.6% 1910 15,243 20.9% 1920 16,638 9.2% 1930 18,531 11.4% 1940 18,836 1.6% 1950 19,610 4.1% 1960 18,580 −5.3% 1970 17,222 −7.3% 1980 15,897 −7.7% 1990 15,023 −5.5% 2000 14,354 −4.5% 2010 14,700 2.4% Est. 2016 14,328 [3] −0.2% sources:[22][23]\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 14,354 people, 6,267 households, and 3,415 families residing in the city.
