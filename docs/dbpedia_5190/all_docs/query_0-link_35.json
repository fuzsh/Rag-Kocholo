        "meta_description": "Welcome to Horicon Marsh! At more than 33,000 acres, Horicon Marsh is one of the largest freshwater marshes in the United States and is a critical rest stop for thousands of migrating ducks and Canada geese. It is recognized as a Wetland of International Importance, as both Globally and State Important Bird Areas and is also a unit of the Ice Age Scientific Reserve. Located in Dodge and Fond du Lac counties, Horicon Marsh is fed by the Rock River which flows through the refuge following a course through southern Wisconsin and eventually ending in the Mississippi River at Rock Island, Illinois.",

        "text": "The marsh provides critical habitat for more than 300 species of birds as well as muskrats, red foxes, turtles, frogs, bats, dragonflies, fish and much more.\n\nMuskrat\n\nMuskrats are often seen swimming or feeding on cattails and make their homes in cattail “huts” throughout the refuge. The original “marsh managers”, they create open areas of water for waterfowl to swim and feed.\n\nRedhead duck\n\nOriginally established for this species, the refuge supports the largest nesting population of redhead ducks east of the Mississippi River. Thousands use the marsh each year.\n\nAmerican white pelican\n\nAmerican white pelicans nest abundantly on islands in the interior of the marsh and may be seen feeding in large groups - “herding” fish into shallower water for easier dining."
