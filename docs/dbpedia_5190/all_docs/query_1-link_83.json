As of the 2020 census, the population was 65,737.[1] The county seat is Queensbury.[2] The county is named in honor of General Joseph Warren, an American Revolutionary War hero of the Battle of Bunker Hill.[3]\n\nWarren County is part of the Glens Falls, NY Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Albany-Schenectady, NY Combined Statistical Area.\n\nHistory[]\n\nWhen counties were established in the Province of New York in 1683, the present Warren County was part of Albany County. The county was enormous, covering the northern part of New York State, all of the present State of Vermont, and, in theory, extended westward to the Pacific Ocean. It was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont. On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Charlotte County (named for the British queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz), contained the eastern portion.\n\nIn 1778, the name Charlotte County was changed to Washington County to honor George Washington, the American Revolutionary War general and later President of the United States of America.\n\nIn 1788, Washington County was reduced in size by the splitting-off of Clinton County. This was a much larger area than the present Clinton County, including several other counties or county parts of the present New York State. Washington County was slightly enlarged by the transfer of the Town of Cambridge from Albany County to Washington County in 1791.\n\nIn 1813, Warren County was split off from Washington County, receiving its name in honor of General Joseph Warren. County officials first met in the Lake George Coffee House in the hamlet of Caldwell (known today as Lake George Village). James Caldwell, a patenee of the Town of Caldwell, donated land within the hamlet to serve as the county seat beginning in 1819.[3]\n\nLake George is the site of a YMCA conference center, the Silver Bay YMCA, founded in 1900 and one of only a few of its type in the United States .[5] The Silver Bay Inn was built in 1904 and is on the National Register of Historic Places.[6]\n\nIn 1963, the courthouse in Lake George village was closed and operations moved several miles south to its present-day location at the Warren County Municipal Center main campus in Queensbury.[7][8]\n\nGeography[]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 932 square miles (2,410 km2), of which 867 square miles (2,250 km2) is land and 65 square miles (170 km2) (6.9%) is water.[9]\n\nWarren County is situated in the eastern portion of New York State in the Adirondack Mountains. The eastern border is Washington County. The highest peak in the county is Gore Mountain at an elevation of 3,198 feet (975 m).[10]\n\nAdjacent counties[]\n\nEssex County - north\n\nWashington County - east\n\nSaratoga County - south\n\nHamilton County - west\n\nClimate[]\n\nThe climate of Warren County is humid continental, as is most of New York State.[11] In the winter, bouts of cold, dry air arrive from Canada, and interior sections of North America.[11] In the summer, the Gulf Stream can bring days of hot, moist, humid air to the county.[11] Extratropical storms often affect the county; in the winter, Nor'easters bring heavy snow and rain, and sometimes high wind. Fall and spring are generally relatively mild and pleasant, with fall foliage regarded as some of the most stunning in the country. In the summer and fall, back door cold fronts move in from the north and bring thunderstorms, sometimes severe.[11]\n\nMonthly Normal High and Low Temperatures For Lake George, New York on the top and average monthly precipitation in inches on the lower section.

The Republicans currently hold 16 of 20 seats on the county legislature, and George W. Bush won the county with 55% of the vote in 2004. Both of Warren County's representatives in the state legislature, Elizabeth O'C. Little in the Senate and Teresa Sayward in the Assembly are Republicans. Currently Republicans constitute 51% of registered voters in Warren County, while Democrats account for 23%.[14]\n\nDemocrats have been steadily making inroads in recent years; Senator Charles Schumer won the county by 56% in his re-election bid in 2004, and the Democrats recently gained a majority on the Glens Falls City Council. John Hall, a Democrat, picked up the county judgeship position in 2003. In 2006 Republican John E. Sweeney was unseated in the district by Kirsten Gillibrand as Member of Congress.[15] In 2009 Congresswoman Kirsten Gillibrand was selected by Governor David Paterson to replace Hillary Clinton as New York's junior Senator. Democrat Scott Murphy was elected to replace Gillibrand in a special election for the NY 20th congressional district.\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama narrowly carried Warren County over John McCain, with Obama receiving 16,281 votes countywide to McCain's total of 15,424 votes.[16] This was only the second time since 1964 that Warren County had voted for the Democratic nominee, the other being 1996, when Bill Clinton won with a plurality. In 2012, Obama won again by a similar margin over Republican nominee Mitt Romney. In 2016, Donald Trump flipped the county back to the Republicans, with an 8.5 percent margin of victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In 2020, Warren County voted for Trump again by a very narrow margin of just 57 votes, despite moving 8 points towards the Democratic ticket of former Vice President Joe Biden and junior California senator Kamala Harris. Warren is one of six New York counties that Trump won by less than 500 votes.\n\nWarren County has 20 county supervisors,[17] which represent 11 of the county's towns and the City of Glens Falls:[15]\n\nBolton: Ronald F.

The Law Enforcement Division includes both Investigative Services, Patrol Services and the Communications Center. Patrol Services have specialized units that operate under the control of the Division Commander.[18] The sheriff's office provides boat patrols on Lake George and Schroon Lake.[19]\n\nDemographics[]\n\nHistorical populations Census Pop. %± 1820 9,453 — 1830 11,796 24.8% 1840 13,422 13.8% 1850 17,199 28.1% 1860 21,434 24.6% 1870 22,592 5.4% 1880 25,179 11.5% 1890 27,866 10.7% 1900 29,943 7.5% 1910 32,223 7.6% 1920 31,673 −1.7% 1930 34,174 7.9% 1940 36,035 5.4% 1950 39,205 8.8% 1960 44,002 12.2% 1970 49,402 12.3% 1980 54,854 11.0% 1990 59,209 7.9% 2000 63,303 6.9% 2010 65,707 3.8% U.S. Decennial Census[20]\n\n1790-1960[21] 1900-1990[22]\n\n1990-2000[23] 2010-2020[1]\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 63,303 people, 25,726 households, and 17,056 families residing in the county.
