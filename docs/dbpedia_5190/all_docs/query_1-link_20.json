Baitfish without a receipt or with a receipt that is older than 10 days shall be considered uncertified bait.\n\nUncertified Baitfish\n\nUncertified baitfish are those that have not been tested to verify that they are free of specified diseases.\n\nUncertified baitfish purchased from a bait dealer can only be used on the same body of water that they were collected in.\n\nUncertified baitfish cannot be transported overland by a motorized vehicle (e.g., car) except within a designated overland transportation corridor.\n\nThe seller of uncertified baitfish outside of an overland transportation corridor is required to provide the same receipt information as for certified baitfish (see above) and also include the name of the waterbody in which the uncertified bait fish can be used and a warning to the purchaser that the baitfish may not be transported overland by motorized vehicle.\n\nPersonally Harvested Baitfish\n\nCollection, Use, and Transportation\n\nAny person who has a fishing license or is entitled to fish without a license may collect minnows (except carp, goldfish, or endangered or threatened species), killifish, mudminnows, darters, sticklebacks, stonecats, smelt, alewives, and suckers for personal use in hook-and-line fishing only (sale prohibited) by angling and with the gear types listed in the Gear for Taking Baitfish table. All other species must be immediately returned to the water.\n\nSpecial regulations associated with personally harvesting alewife and blueback herring in the Hudson River can be found in the Tidal Hudson River Special Regulations.\n\nBaitfish or other legally taken fish species intended to be used as bait may only be used in the same waterbody from which they were caught for bait in hook-and-line fishing. These fish may only be used in a waterbody where it is legal to use fish as bait.\n\nTransportation of personally harvested baitfish overland by a motorized vehicle is prohibited except within a designated overland transportation corridor.\n\nSmelt, suckers, alewives, and blueback herring taken for human consumption only may be transported at any time.\n\nSmelt may be taken only by angling in the Hudson River downstream of the Troy Dam and in Lake Champlain, Upper and Lower Saranac Lakes, Lake Clear (Franklin County), Chazy Lake, and their tributaries to the first impassable barrier.\n\nPossession or use of minnow traps and nets is prohibited on units of state land/waters where the use or possession of baitfish is prohibited.\n\nGear for Taking Baitfish\n\nGearTimeWatersSeine or scap net: maximum size 36 square feetSunrise to sunsetAll non-trout watersMinnow trap: maximum length 20\", maximum entrance diameter 1\", must be marked with owner's name and addressAnytimeWaters open to baitfish useSeine: maximum size 36 square feetAnytimeLakes Erie & Ontario excluding their inlets, outlets, bays\n\nNiagara River\n\nHudson River below Troy DamCast net1 maximum 10 feet in diameterAnytimeHudson River below Troy DamIn addition, alewives are the only fish that may be taken as follows:Gill nets: maximum length 25 feet, maximum area 200 square feet, maximum size 1\" barAnytimeCanadice, Canandaigua, Cayuga, Hemlock, Keuka, Owasco, Otisco, and Seneca lakes.Stunning may be used to collect stonecats. Stunning means tapping a stone with an implement or other stone.1 The only place where cast nets may be used is in the Hudson River below the Troy Dam\n\nNatural Baits\n\nSee Natural Baits Regulations for information about taking and using species such as salamanders and snakes, frogs, aquatic insects, rusty crayfish and fish eggs as bait.\n\nSpecies Prohibited for Use as Bait\n\nCarp, goldfish, lamprey larvae, round goby, European rudd as well as species listed as endangered or threatened in New York State may not be used for bait.\n\nUse of Dead Fish as Bait\n\nAny dead fish, or parts thereof excluding eggs, that are legal to possess and are not prohibited for use as bait, that have been packaged for commercial sale and have been preserved by methods other than by freezing only (e.g., salted minnows) can be used in any waterbody where it is legal to use fish as bait and do not require a receipt.\n\nEach package of dead bait fish must be individually labeled, identifying the:\n\nname of the packager/processor,\n\nname of the species,\n\nquantity of fish contained, and\n\nmeans of preservation.\n\nRestrictions on Use and Possession of Marine Baitfish\n\nBaitfish collected in the Marine and Coastal District (see Definitions) may be transported overland only for use in the Marine and Coastal District in the following counties: Queens, Kings, Richmond, New York, Bronx, Suffolk, Nassau, Rockland, and Westchester.\n\nOverland Transportation Corridors\n\nThree defined overland transportation corridors were designated for the purposes of allowing the transport and use of uncertified baitfish by anglers in specific areas of the state. Uncertified baitfish are only allowed to be used on the same body of water where they were collected within these corridors. The three overland transportation corridors are intended to primarily serve anglers fishing the following major waterbodies:\n\nLake Erie-Upper Niagara River\n\nLower Niagara River-Lake Ontario-St. Lawrence River\n\nTidal Hudson River\n\nTransporting Within an Overland Transportation Corridor\n\nPurchased Uncertified Baitfish\n\nUncertified baitfish purchased from a bait dealer may be transported within a designated overland transportation corridor provided a receipt, issued by the seller and retained by the purchaser while in possession of the baitfish, contains the following:\n\nseller's name,\n\ndate of sale,\n\nspecies of fish,\n\nnumber of each species sold,\n\nwaterbody the baitfish must be used in,\n\noverland transportation corridor the baitfish must be transported within, and\n\na warning that the baitfish may only be transported within that overland transportation corridor.\n\nPersonally Collected Baitfish\n\nPersonally collected baitfish taken from a waterbody within an overland transportation corridor may be transported within that corridor. These baitfish may only be used within the same waterbody where they were collected.\n\nDesignated Overland Transportation Corridors\n\nUpper Niagara River/Lake Erie\n\nView larger version of the map (PDF)\n\nThe geographical area associated with the New York portion of Lake Erie and the Upper Niagara River west of and including a line starting at I-90 at the Pennsylvania border, then continuing east to its intersection with I-290, then continuing north along I-290 to its intersection with State Rte. 62, then continuing west to its intersection with I-190, then north to its intersection with the Lower Niagara River.\n\nBaitfish collected from the New York portion of the Upper Niagara River/Lake Erie waterbody may be transported within this corridor.\n\nHudson River\n\nView larger version of the map (PDF)\n\nThe geographical area associated with the Hudson River south of the Federal Dam at Troy starting at the eastern shore of the Hudson River at the Federal Dam in Troy, continuing east on W.
