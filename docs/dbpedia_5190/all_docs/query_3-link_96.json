The notice given out on behalf of the Federal Reserve banks is careful to say that what the Reserve banks have engaged to do is simply to purchase from the Reichsbank up to a total of $25,000,000 of prime commercial bills. The Federal Reserve banks are unquestionably authorized to engage in the purchase and sale of commercial bills, but that means merely in the ordinary course of their business and not for the purpose of helping out a foreign bank. Nor was the Federal Reserve System, or any of the different Reserve banks ever intended to act in the capacity of a central bank. Yet more and more the Federal Reserve banks are being operated as if they were central banking institutions. What section of the Reserve Act can be pointed to as giving authority to act in such capacity? What reason have the Reserve banks for wanting to purchase German commercial bills outside of the desire to place a fund at the disposal of the Reiehsbank with a view to helping Germany out of its present troubles? That the action is of a meritorious character as far as the act itsell is concerned is not to be construed as furnishing warrant for it unless express authority to that effect can be found in the law itself. As explained by us on numerous previous occasions, the Reserve banks carry all the cash reserves of the member banks, these latter not being required to hold a single dollar of reserve in their own vaults, and the utmost precaution should at all times be taken to prevent the Use of the reserves held by the Reserve banks for any purpose other than that designed by the Act. Moreover, these reserves can only be made available for loaning or for the purchase of bills or the extension of credits, by putting out Reserve notes. Observe now that the Reserve Act describes these Reserve notes as being \"obligations of the United States which shall be receivable by all National and member banks and Federal Reserve banks, and for all taxes, customs and other public dues.\" We are therefore prompted to ask again, as we have done many times before, what right or power have the Reserve banks to issue notes in this country which are declared to be obligations of the United States for the purpose of making loans or extending credits to foreign countries? And be it remembered that the volume of these Federal Reserve notes keeps steadily increasing week after week, no recent week having been an exception to the rule, and the total the present week standing at $1,674,189,000 as against only $1,402,869,000 12 months ago on June 25 1930. Here is an increase in the volume of these Federal Reserve notes outstanding during the past year in the huge sum of $271,320,000. To be sure, gold holdings in this same period of 12 months have increased in amount of $323,415,000, this reflecting the large gold importations that have occurred, but what can be the object of acquiring all this gold through the issuance of Reserve notes instead of allowing it to go into circulation in the shape of gold certificates? We have referred above to the prompt response which the stock and commercial markets made to the action of the President in his move for the relief of Germany. Aside from the tremendous rise which occurred on the Stock Exchange, the most conspicuous improvement was seen perhaps in the sudden 4637 demand which sprang up for copper. The demand for the metal was active, both on domestic account and on foreign account. At the same time, considerable improvement occurred in the price of the metal. Last week some copper sold at as low as 73 / 4c. a pound for supplies delivered at the factories in Connecticut. This week sales have been at a full lc. a pound higher, or at 8%c. Of course even this last mentioned figure is extremely low, and few of the copper mines can produce copper at that price at a profit, but, at any rate, the point of importance is that there has been a substantial change for the better. The grain markets also responded with some advances in prices, though here, also, these prices remain inordinately low. Thus July wheat at Chicago, as against 55%c. on Thursday of last week, sold up to 59c. on Wednesday of this week, though closing yesterday at 58Y8c. Cotton made a much more substantial advance, spot cotton here in New York selling up to 10.35c. yesterday as against 8.60c. on Thursday of last week and 8.25c. on June 9. The steel trade, however, continues extremely depressed, and the output of steel has further declined the present week. The steel mills of the country are now operating to only 36% of capacity as against 38% last week and 57% when at the peak in March. The \"Iron Age,\" moreover, tells us that \"additional recessions seem inevitable unless sentiment, which now appears to be veering, actually undergoes a marked change.\" At the same time, the price situation remains very unsatisfactory, though hopes of an improvement are being built, strange as it may seem, upon the probability that the petition of the railroads for higher rates will raise the cost of iron and steel shipments, and that a coal strike in Western Pennsylvania and West Virginia may have the same effect, by reason of the higher price that may have to be paid for the coal. The \"Iron Age\" says that \"the plea of the carriers for higher rates, although not unopposed, has been sympathetically received by an unusually large proportion of the industrial shippers, suggesting part, if not all, of the 15% advance asked for will be granted. An increase of 10%, it is estimated, would raise steel-making costs $1 a ton, an increment which would doubtless stiffen mill prices and sharply stimulate shipments prior to the effective date of the new rates.\" In the market for scrap steel price conditions are extremely unsatisfactory. The \"Iron Age\" says that during the past week heavy melting steel has declined 25c. a ton at Pittsburgh and Detroit, and $1 a ton at Philadelphia.\" The \"Age\" adds: \"The purchase of sizable tonnage of heavy melting grade at Pittsburgh at $10 delivered, brought the market in that district to as low a level as has been reached in the present century, that price having been touched only once before, in December 1914.\" The dividend record by railroad and other corporations also continues distressing. We have already referred to the reduction in the dividend of the Pennsylvania RR.from a basis of 8% per annum to 6%. The Baltimore & Ohio, after the cut in the dividend three months ago from 7% to 5%, made no further reduction the present week. The Central RR. of N. J. omitted the semi-annual dividend of $2 a share customarily paid around July 15. The quarterly dividend of $2 a share was declared as usual. The Pittsburgh & West Virginia deferred action on the quarterly dividend of $1.50 a share ordinarily 4638 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE paid about July 30. The Laclede Steel Co. reduced its quarterly dividend from 50c. a share to 25c. The New York Air Brake Co. declared 25c. a share on common as compared with 40c. three months ago, 60c. a share on Feb.1 last, and 90c. a share in the different quarters of 1930. A whole host of companies omitted dividends altogether, either on common stocks or their preferred shares. The list includes the International Paper and Power Co. on the two classes of preferred shares; the U.S.Industrial Alcohol Co. on common; the Oliver United Filters, Inc., on class B stock; the Abitibi Power & Paper Co. on 6% cum.preferred stock; the Brompton Paper Co.on common stock; the St. Lawrence Paper Mills Co. on the 6% cum. preferred stock; the St. Lawrence Corp. on the $2 cum. class A stock; the Western Mfg. Co. on the $3.50 cum. pref. stock; the Intercontinent Power Co. on 7% cum. pref.; the United States Lines on the $1 cum. pref. stock, and the Skelly Oil Co. on the 6% cum. pref., and Stern Bros. on $4 cum. class A pref. The Federal Reserve banks the present week show increases all around in the different holdings of bills and discounts, with the exception that the holdings of acceptances remained virtually unchanged, standing the present week at $106,390,000 as against $106,814,000 last week. The discount holdings, representing direct borrowing by the member banks, are reported at $197,678,000 this week as against $185,388,000 last week. The biggest change of all, however, is the increase in the holdings of Government securities, which for a long time has been held at slightly less than $600,000,000, and last week were reported at $599,004,000 but the present week are up to $618,503,000. A new item this week is \"foreign loans on gold\" for amount of $16,700,000, supposed to represent loans to the Reichsbank on gold in transit. Altogether, total bill and security holdings this week stand at $947,334,000 against $900,454,000 a week ago. The volume of Federal Reserve notes in circulation increased during the week from $1,668,313,000 to $1,674,189,000, while gold reserves rose from $3,355,289,000 to $3,382,589,000. Brokers' loans by the reporting member banks in New York City show a slight further decrease the present week, following larger or smaller decreases in each of the nine previous weeks. This week's furthur decrease is only $13,000,000, but added to the *430,000,00 reduction in the nine weeks preceding, makes a total contraction for the 10 weeks of no less than $443,000,000. Loans for own account further decreased during the week by $5,000,000,falling from $1,070,000,000 to $1,065,000,000; loans for account of out-of-town banks fell from $177,000,000 to $170,000,000, and loans\"for account of others\"from $172,000,000 to $171,000,000. The grand aggregate of all the loans in the three categories combined is now only $1,406,000,000, which compares with $3,416,000,000 12 months before on June 25 1930. The stock market this week enjoyed a sensational and specticular advance in prices of a nature and character rarely witnessed before, and of a magnitude to which few parallels can be found covering such a brief space of time. It was all due to the action of President Hoover in proposing to the nations of the world a one-year moratorium for German reparations and intergovernmental debt payments. Intimations of what was contemplated were (Vot.. 132 given in the statement issued Friday evening of last week by President Hoover, but which went no further than to say that since his return from the Central West he had 'been in conference with the leaders of both political parties who happened to be in Washington with respect to steps which this country might take to assist in economic recovery both here and abroad, and directed particularly to strengthening the economic situation in Germany. This acted like wildfire in the half-day session on Saturday, the dealings being of very large magnitude for a halfday session, notwithstanding that so many of the brokers were away over the week-end, and prices spurted up with great rapidity in all parts of the market. The advances in leading speculative issues ran all the way from 23 4 to 163 / 4 points, with U. S. Steel up 6 points, Union Pacific 10 points, Atchison 11 points, and Auburn Auto 163 / 4 points. On Sunday morning the daily papers published the President's full statement given out Saturday afternoon. This revealed the President's definite proposal of a complete suspension of all reparations and intergovernmental debt payments for a full year from July 1 1931. As a result, a wave of optimism spread all over the country, and the stock market on Monday fairly; boiled, with transactions running in excess of 4/ 1 2million shares, and with another sweep upward in prices extending all through the list, the rise being only second to that enjoyed on Saturday. On Tuesday, on realizing sales and intimations that the President's proposals might meet with opposition on the part of France, prices suffered a moderate reaction. On Wednesday, however, prices swept upward again on a wave of great enthusiasm, and trading was on such a scare that the day's transactions ran in excess of 5,000,000 shares. United States Steel common advanced to above par and gains for the day in the active specialties ran from 3 points up to 12 points, National Lead having this latter gain to its credit. Other contributing factors, in addition to the foreign debt moratorium, acted as a further stimulus to the rise of prices on that day. The announcement of an increase of 45c. in the wholesale price of cigarettes with indications of a corresponding advance in retail prices served as a basis for bullish demonstrations in the case of the tobacco stocks, and the advance in the price of copper, due to demand, also served to propel the shares upward, while maintenance of the existing dividend rates by the Baltimore & Ohio RR. and Westinghouse Elec. & Mfg. served us a stimulating influence on the market generally. Besides this, the action of the Federal Radio Commission in upholding the Radio Corp.'s plea to be permitted to retain 1,400 of its licenses gave strength to the shares of the latter company. One especially gratifying feature of the market all week has been the fact that bond values have also been rising, not alone for the different railroad issues which previously had been under pressure for weeks and months, but also for foreign issues in which latter German issues have, of course, been especially prominent, though Australian and many other foreign bonds have also participated in the improvement. Reactionary tendencies were in evidence on Thursday, but only in a minor degree, and prices were also well maintained on Friday, notwithstanding heavy sales to realize profits. The traction issues have been an exception to the rule, and have lagged behind most of the week owing to the develop- JUNE 27 1931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE ment of some new drawbacks in the scheme for amalgamating all the different local properties. Only 38 stocks touched new low levels for the year during the week, while 30 stocks established new high levels. Call loans on the Stock Exchange did m) 1 2% all week, thereby repeating the deviate from 1/ record of many previous weeks. Trading has, of course, been on a large scale in the execution of the buying orders which came into the market in a perfect flood, and transactions have run up to 4,000,000 and 5,000,000 shares a day. At the half-day session on Saturday the sales on the New York Stack Exchange were 1,508,105 shares; on Monday they were 4,588,280 shares; on Tuesday, 2,600,490 shares; on Wednesday, 5,066,056 shares; on Thursday, 4,317,380 shares, and on Friday, 3,116,860 shares. On the New York Curb Exchange the sales last Saturday were 247,040 shares; on Monday, 781,297 shares; on Tuesday, 452,146 shares; on Wednesday, 741,222 shares; on Thursday, 685,477 shares, and on Friday, 572,233 shares. As compared with Friday of last week, prices show huge advances all around. General Electric closed 8 on Friday of last yesterday at 45 ex-div. against 381/ week; Warner Bros.

In foreign financial markets, as in this country, the complexion of financial affairs was changed completely this week by the hopefulness occasioned by the proposal of President Hoover for a one-year suspension of German reparation and intergovernmen tal war debt payments. The change produced on the stock markets in London, Paris, Berlin and elsewhere by the pronouncement was as startling as the proposal itself. Gloominess prevailed on all markets until Saturday of last week, and trading proceeded on the narrowest basis to the steady accompaniment of declining quotations. All this was suddenly changed when it became known early last Saturday that conversations among Administration leaders in Washington were proceeding on the debt and reparations questions. The Continental markets which were open last Saturday registered an immensely favorable response, although this was counteracted at Berlin by the need for credit rationing by the Reichsbank. When trading was resumed on the London. and Continental markets Monday, stocks surged upward on an enthusiastic buying 4640 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE For,. 132. movement clearly produced by the sole circumstance the shares of the institution receded slightly.

He remarked also that an abnormal flow of gold into the United States is lowering the credit stability of many foreign countries, diminishing their buying power for our exports and thus adding to our own difficulties. \"Wise and timely action should contribute to relieve the pressure of these adverse forces in,foreign countries and should assist in the re-establishment of confidence, thus forwarding political peace and economic stability in the world.\" Remarking on the need for Congressional approval of the step, Mr. Hoover stated that it amounted to a suggestion to the American people that they be wise creditors in their own interest and be good neighbors. \"I wish to take this occasion also to frankly state my views upon our relations to German reparations and the debts owed to us by the Allied governments of Europe,\" Mr. Hoover continued. \"Our Government has not been a party to, or exercised a voice in, domination of reparation obligations. We purposely did not participate in either general reparations or the division of colonies or property. The repayment of debts due to us from the Allies for the advances for war and reconstruction was settled upon a basis not contingent upon German reparations, or related thereto. Therefore, reparations is necessarily wholly a European problem with which we have no relation. I do not approve in any remote sense of the cancellation of the debts due to us. World confidence would not be enhanced by such action. None of our debtor nations has ever suggested it. But as the basis of the settlement of these debts was the capacity under normal conditions of the debtor to pay, we should be consistent with our own policies and principles if we take into account the abnormal situation now existing in the world. I am sure the American people have no desire to attempt to extract any sum beyond the capacity of any debtor to pay, and it is our view that broad vision requires that our Government should recognize the situation as it exists. This course of action is entirely consistent with the policy which we have hitherto pursued. We are not involved in the discussion of strictly European problems, of which the payment of German reparations is one. It represents our willingness to make a contribution to the early restoration of world prosperity, in which our people have so deep an interest. I wish further to add that while this action has no bearing on the conference for limitation of land armaments to be held next February, inasmuch as the burden of competitive armaments has contributed to bring about this depression, we trust that by this evidence of our desire to assist we shall have contributed to the good-will which is so necessary to the solution of this major question.\" Publication of this proposal last Sunday throughout the world was followed by instant evidences of popular approval in all leading countries with the exception of France. Even on the basis of the first Washington intimations, made available last Saturday,stock exchanges in all markets registered sweeping advances. Leading figures in finance and politics in the United States gave unqualified approval, and hardly a single important dissenting voice was raised. Throughout much of the current week, also, favorable expressions have been made available day after day, while the markets for securities and corn- (Vol,. 132. modifies have maintained their favorable trends with but few interrupations. It is now indicated that even France will give qualified approval to the step, while the enthusiasm aroused elsewhere shows no sign of diminishing. A statement issued by Secretary of State Stimson last Sunday gave some indication of the background for the proposal, while compilations of the debt and reparations payments due all around during the coming fiscal year made plain the actual significance of the move for all countries. \"Since the financial situation in Germany has been under consideration,\" Mr. Stimson said, \"the President has been making every effort to gather information in regard to it which should be accurate and authentic. He recently made a request for such information from the German Government, requesting that it be of the highest authority. He has received a response in the form of a letter to him from President von Hindenburg, and considers its contents as confidential to himself. The information thus obtained corresponds to that obtained from other official and private reports, and which is publicly current.\" It was reported at the same time in Washington press dispatches that Secretary Mellon had presented an outline of the European situation to Mr. Hoover in transatlantic telephone conversations, while information which \"gave Mr. Hoover some concern\" was presented by Senator Dwight W. Morrow, who had just returned from abroad. \"Mr. Morrow is understood to have reported,\" a Washington dispatch to the New York \"Herald Tribune\" said,\"that high officials of the German Government were becoming fearful that they might not be able to hold the lines against a popular uprising unless the economic situation were relieved promptly.\" It was also disclosed that Mr. Stimson had broached the proposal to the ranking diplomats of Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Belgium late June 19. \"Mr. Stimson was careful to explain to the envoys with whom he conferred,\" the dispatch said, \"that the United States was making no concessions unless the Allies went all the way and relieved Germany from all debt payments except those obligatory for the payment of interest on Dawes or Young plan bonds sold to the general public.\" Calculations were quickly made by Treasury officials on the possible effects of the plan announced by President Hoover. It was shown that Germany would be relieved of payments under the one-year suspension of $406,440,660, provided all the creditor nations agreed to the plan. In some later estimates, also made at Washington, it was computed that the relief to be extended Germany would amount to as much as $425,000,000. Of especial importance, in view of the turn taken by the international negotiations on the project, is the fact that about $155,000,000 of the amount would consist of unconditional annuities under the Young plan. The amounts due from Germany were to have been paid to the larger powers in approximately the following amounts: France, $199,706,000; Great Britain, $86,228,000; Italy, $45,448,000; United States, $15,745,000; Belgium, $5,121,000; others, $54,190,000. When the siphoning of the payments to the United States in order to pay the war debts is taken into consideration, it would appear that the sacrifice would fall in about the following amounts: United States, $246,000,000; France, $86,750,000; Great Britain, $19,963,000, and Italy, $9,138,000. Rana 271931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE The early consultations with Senators and Congressmen, together with later expressions of approval rapidly made it appear that the necessary legislation for the debt suspension will easily be granted when Congress meets next December. There was some talk of an extra session, but this was dispelled almost immediately by assurances that none will be called. With the formal acceptance of the proposal virtually assured in the United States, attention turned this week to the reaction in other countries and to the legal aspects of the proposal which other governments will have to face. Explanations were given and misunderstandings cleared up, so that the full implications of the proposal might stand revealed. It was also disclosed that President Hoover told Secretaries Stimson and Mellon, and UnderSecretary of State Mills of what he had in mind as long ago as June 5, when it appeared that the collapse of the Austrian Kreditanstalt and other difficulties might lead to more extensive financial troubles throughout Central and Eastern Europe. Fifteen other nations are principally concerned in the Washington proposal for a one-year debt suspension and attention was centered Monday on the diplomatic steps that might assure prompt acceptance by such countries. \"It was urged upon foreign diplomats by the State Department that the best way to hold the gains in world business confidence resulting from the proposal was to assure the execution of the plan,\" a report to the New York \"Herald Tribune\" said. \"This depends on its unconditional acceptance by all interested powers.\" Press dispatches from France told of a decidedly unfavorable reaction in the press of that country, based mainly on the heavy sacrifice entailed and the effectual abrogation of the Young plan for a year. In order both to avoid the sacrifice and assure continued operation of the Young plan, French opinion veered toward the making of reservations. Italy also appeared disposed to accept only with diplomatic reservations. \"In anticipation of such proposals,the State Department made it clear during the day that President Hoover's plan was not open to negotiation, and that it would have to be accepted or rejected without reservation,\" the \"Herald Tribune\" report said. Rumors gained circulation that a conference of nations might be called in order to consider the matter, but on this point also a firm attitude was taken in Washington. Secretary Stimson said, according to Washington reports, that no conference of nations was needed to clarify or modify the proposal, which could only be weakened by weeks of debate or discussion. Prompt and unequivocal acceptance of the plan by Great Britain and its extension to the British Dominions forms perhaps the most important diplomatic result immediately apparent. Germany was cheered immensely by the step, while the practical benefits to that country were emphasized by an immediate cessation of the heavy flight of capital which occasioned such huge gold transfers last week and the virtual stripping of the foreign exchange holdings of the Reichsbank. These developments and the further indications of widespread support in this country overshadowed the perturbing indications that counter-proposals would probably be made by the French Government. Such counter-proposals would hardly accord with the spirit of the declaration by President Hoover, it was pointed out, and efforts were continued to find a way out of the diffi- 4643 culties thus presented. The situation was considered somewhat delicate, and it resulted Tuesday in the indefinite postponement of a radio address in which Mr. Stimson expected to explain the proposal. A complete and cordial Italian acceptance of the proposal was announced formally in Washington Wednesday, and it thus appeared that the French attitude presented the only important stumbling block to the prompt application of the debt suspension. Diplomatic endeavors in Washington were concentrated on the French aspect of the matter beginning Wednesday. It was made known both in Washington and London that Secretary Mellon would leave the British capital for Paris.Thursday, and it was assumed that he would discusg various phases of the project with French aficials. Secretary Stimson issued a brief statement in Washington late Wednesday indicating that the French counterproposals would be the subject of negotiations. \"The President's proposal was drawn on broad, simple outlines,\" Mr. Stimson said. \"The object was very clear, namely, to secure a postponement for one year of the burden of these payments. Those outlines will not be departed from. We are making substantial headway, but on such a subject involving so many different debts and nations there are necessarily many details which must be filled in after careful study and conversations. These conversations must necessarily be carried on in the regular diplomatic way through the diplomatic channels and not through the press.\" Mr. Stimson added later in the day that he felt very optimistic, and that \"if anything happens to the President's plan it would be a crime.\" In Germany the proposal by President Hoover was hailed with unbounded enthusiasm, and the Government headed by Chancellor Heinrich Bruening indicated its immediate official acceptance. The joy manifested at first has been dissipated to a degree by the reservations on which the French Government is insisting, but, on the other hand, it is considered probable that a vastly improved diplomatic atmosphere between French and Germany will result from suggestions for A parley between the leaders of the two governments similar to that recently held at Chequers. The gain for Germany is very substantial, even if, as now appears likely, the French reservations on unconditional annuities prevail. That relief in one form or another would have to be extended Germany was made exceedingly clear late last week on the basis of the Reichsbank statement and the continuing flight of capital from Germany. The legal minimum of 40% note coverage was rapidly being approached, a Berlin dispatch to the New York \"Herald Tribune\" said, with the drain showing no sign of ending. The Reichsbank last Saturday had to take the serious step, accordingly, of stopping the quotation of private discount rates and giving notice that bills of exchange would be honored only at the counters of the Reichsbank itslf. This was tantamount to a restriction of credit, which is much dreaded in Germany. It was indicated in the report, moreover, that a credit might possibly be arranged in favor of the Reichsbank by other banks of issue in order to tide the institution over its immediate difficulties. This credit, in the amount of about $100,000,000, was under negotiation all the current week, and was announced by the Fed- 4644 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE [vol.. 132. eral Reserve Bank of New York, the Bank of EngAn electric response was made in Great Britain land, the Bank of France, and the Bank for Inter- to the news that President Hoover had proposed a national Settlements late Thursday. one-year suspension of intergovernmental debt payAn official announcement in Berlin last Sunday ments, and unqualified official approval quickly stated that the proposal of President Hoover had followed.

Although such obligations are a matter for discussion and settlement between the governments concerned, the Chancellor of the Exchequer remarked: \"We felt that we would be interpreting the wishes of the country in deciding freely to offer the Dominions and India the same concession as proposed for foreign countries under the same conditions.\" He stated that the British proposals will involve a loss for the current British budget of up to E11,000,000. \"This is a serious sacrifice for the taxpayers of the country,\" Mr. Snowden said,\"but we hope the step which we are taking will be more than justified by the help it will give in reviving confidence and prosperity.\" In this instance, also, Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Lloyd George associated themselves completely with the action of the Labor Government, so that the matter remains non-partisan and removed from the dangers of party disputes. Mixed feelings were aroused in France by the debt suspension proposal of the United States Government, which turned out to be far more sweeping than had been looked for in that country on the basis of early reports. There was, on the one hand, a very pronounced sense of relief over the evidence that an effort would be made to help Germany financially. But, on the other hand, instantaneous and serious objections were raised to the suspension of the $100,000,000 portion of the unconditional annuity payment due France on reparations account. The chief consideration molding French opinion in this fashion was the lack of faith in the good word and intentions of Germany, Paris reports said. It was widely hinted that at the end of the year of grace, it might well prove to Germany's advantage to make the situation appear quite as bad or worse than at present. There was much editorial questioning, moreover, of what the United States might be expected to do in the event that Germany is unable or unwilling to resume payments a year hence. That these expressions were largely political and that different ideas prevailed in some informed quarters is perhaps best illustrated by the international credit of $100,000,000 extended the Reichsbank Thursday, in which the Bank of France participated to the extent of about $25,000,000. French uncertainties regarding the proposal were apparent throughout the past week. Official consideration of the matter was started Tuesday in an atmosphere that was influenced markedly by the favorable reception of the news on the Bourse. A reply to President Hoover was drafted by Premier Pierre Laval in collaboration with Foreign Minister Briand and other members of the Cabinet. Although this note was not made public until yesterday, when it was placed before the Chamber of Deputies for discussion, its substance has been well known since Tuesday. Authoritative summaries were made available Wednesday, after dispatch of the document to Washington. While expressing entire sympathy with the aims of the American proposal, the French Government makes the reservation that in order to maintain the functioning of the Young plan, Germany should continue to pay the regular installments of the unconditional annuities into the Bank for International Settlements in marks. The Young plan is the law of France, it is pointed out, and it is hoped that the legality of the plan will remain unimpaired. The willingness is expressed, however, to 4645 place the unconditional annuities of the fiscal year at the disposal of the B. I. S. for reinvestment in Germany and other Central European countries suffering from financial distress. \"In making this reply,\" a Paris dispatch of Wednesday to the New York \"Times\" said, \"the French Government did not take into account only its own legal position or its public opinion. It acted in the hope that Washington would accept the reservation and in a belief, which was founded on good information, that the German Government was ready to accept that reservation.\" Germany would probably be the more ready to agree, it was pointed out, since the whole scheme might fail if the French reservations were not accepted. It was also remarked in the \"Times\" dispatch that virtually all the Continental European nations which are fellow sharers with France in the unconditional payments feel themselves compelled to maintain the principle of the Young plan. The reaction in Washington to the French note was one of unconcealed disappointment over the suggested modifications. Protracted conferences were held at the White House between President Hoover, Secretary Stimson and Ogden L. Mills, Acting Secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Stimson remarked to press correspondents late Wednesday that Administration officials were in the midst of negotiations and conversations that would probably take much time. \"I am very optimistic,\" the Secretary'added. \"If anything happens to the President's plan it would be a crime.\" It was, nevertheless, reported in Washington dispatches that the contentions of France occasioned no surprise in Washington, since it had been known in advance that the alterations would be suggested. The French Government also, a dispatch to the New York \"Times\" said, expressed apprehension that a cessation of the Young plan payments for a year might mean a scrapping of the plan at the end of that period. The Administration in Washington, it was added, realizes fully that it cannot undertake to force its views on a sovereign nation without regard for the sensibilities or the arguments of that nation. \"There will be no effort Spared to convince the French,\" the report continued, \"that their apprehension that a suspension of all reparations payments would scrap the plan or that a resumption of annuities at the end of the moratorium year cannot be assured, is unfounded; and to assume that the negotiations are doomed to failure is to overlook the history of more complex international situations.\" Increasing optimism in Administration circles over the possibility of complete international acceptance of the proposal for a debt moratorium was reported in Washington, Thursday. Confidence prevailed, it was said, that the French Government's objection to including the unconditional payments in the arrangements sought by the President will be withdrawn ultimately. \"France, it is being contended, cannot stand out against the universal endorsement that has been given the President's proposal,\" a \"Times\" dispatch remarked. \"A failure of the Hoover plan through French refusal to accept it in its entirety was characterized as unthinkable.\" Secretary Stimson let it be known, Thursday, that he expected to sail for Europe to-day on his planned trip which is to combine vacation and diplomatic activities. The departure of the Secretary may be regarded as a carefully considered step, which will 4646 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE have the effect of allowing France further breathing space to contemplate the situation, a report to the New York \"Herald Tribune\" said. Important, also, are the activities of Secretary of the Treasury Andrew W. Mellon, who arrived in Paris Thursday after long conferences on the situation with London officials. It was admitted in Washington that Mr. Mellon went to Paris at the request of President Hoover, in order to take an active part in the effort to convince French of the desirability of complete acceptance of the debt suspension proposal. Publication of the complete French reply to President Hoover in Washington and Paris yesterday discloses that the French Government declares itself \"in cordial agreement with the lofty sentiments which inspired the proposal.\" In response, it was stated, the French Government is prepared to ask its Parliament for authority to \"forego the retention of any payment to be made by the Reich\" for a period of one year. The note places emphasis upon the risks of treating conditional and unconditional annuities alike and states that the French Government has a \"moral interest of the first order in not postponing in any way the payment of the unconditional annuity, even during the period contemplated by Mr. Hoover.\" Arguing that extension of 'credit is the best means of meeting the dangers now threatening German economy,the Government states that it is prepared to place all the unconditional annuities due it during the year at the disposal of the B. I. S., and suggests that other beneficiaries under the Young plan adopt the same procedure. Such sums, it is remarked, could be utilized at once in improving credit conditions in Germany and other Central European countries. \"Lastly,\" the note states, \"it will be advisable to contemplate before the expiration of the period of one year an examination of methods to be taken by Germany for the resumption of her payments.\" An acknowledgment of this communication by Secretary Stimson was made public at the same time. Appreciation was expressed by Mr. Stimson of the cordiality of the French response, and it was suggested that advantage be taken of the presence in Paris of Secretary Mellon to discuss with Mr. Mellon and Ambassador Edge the various problems arising out of the original proposal and the French answer. Secretary of State Stimson also issued a formal statement on the note, in which he recalled that Mr. Hoover's plan does not propose a reconsideration or impairment of any international agreements, including the debt agreements. A simple postponement only was suggested, and the method of accomplishing this, as well as the ultimate payment of the postponed amounts, are matters requiring negotiation and settlements between different governments, it was stated. Suggestions in the method proposed by France which do not accomplish the full measure of relief desired must be the subject of further discussion with a view to modification, the statement added. Discussions in Paris will continue, with a view to early conclusion, Mr. Stimson declared. In Paris it was announced yesterday that French officials will begin conferring with Mr. Mellon and Ambassador Edge this afternoon. Texts of the interchanges between the French and American governments on the debt suspension proposal were placed before the Chamber of Deputies in Paris yesterday, and after an adjournment of an [VoL. 132. hour for study of the documents, interpellations on the matter were taken up. These quickly developed into a severe attack on the Laval Ministry by various party leaders, and into harsh charges and counter-charges. Regarding the need for defending the integrity of the Young plan, all the Chamber seemed to be agreed, reports said. Louis Mann, leader of the Nationalists, led the attack by declaring that the United States had delivered an ultimatum to France demanding acceptance of the Hoover proposal. This was emphatically denied by Premier Laval. M. Mann insisted that the United States desires to come to the aid of Germany to save the American capital invested in the Reich. Alfred Margaine, a RadicalSocialist, stated that in his opinion an understanding prevails among the British and the Americans. Notwithstanding such violent statements, most of the important groups voted during a recess to support the French reply to the Hoover proposal. The session continued last night, with Premier Laval demanding an immediate decision by the Chamber in order that he might proceed with the negotiations with Secretary Mellon and Mr. Edge. After a little early uncertainty, Italy ranged itself behind the proporal of President Hoover, with the sole reservation that some \"observations\" may be made at a later date. Almost all other interested countries also have given favorable expressions on the question. The immediate reaction in Italy, when the proposal was made known, was one of complete approval from an economic viewpoint, notwithstanding the severe losses that would be occasioned by a suspension of unconditional annuities. The loss to Italy would exceed by about $9,000,000 the sum due annually to the United States and Britain on war debt payments. One political reservation was suggested in early dispatches from Rome. This related to the Austro-German customs union project, which the Italian Government is understood to regard with disfavor and which it was suggested this week must be abandoned. In the formal acceptance of the Hoover proposal, however, such views found no expression. Premier Mussolini instructed Ambassador Nobile Giacomo de Martino to deliver a note at the State Department in which the notable sacrifices of Italy are recalled, but which expressed \"cordial acceptance in principle\" of the proposal. \"It is my intention,\" the note said, \"to send later on to the American Government some observations of mine aiming at an operation at the same time equitable and practical,such as certainly is in the purposes of President Hoover.\" Reactions of the coterie of European nations that act politically in close accord with the French Foreign Office were much in accordance with expectations. In Belgium the proposal was received with enthusiasm on the Bourse and in business circles, but the attitude of the Brussels Government was a more cautious one. The Cabinet met Monday to consider the situation, but decided to await developments before taking an official stand. Camille Gutt, a financial expert, was dispatched to Paris for consultations. Yugoslavia also was reported as undecided on the answer to be made to the proposal, with the likelihood that the French attitude would dictate the Belgrade response. In Czechoslovakia and Poland the attitude was one of reserve, while Greece awaited further information on its own position with regard to Bulgarian reparations payments. Austria JUNE 27 1931.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE greeted the proposal warmly, Foreign Minister Schober stating Tuesday that it \"cannot be overvalued.\" Hungary also gave unqualified approval. Japan adopted a very sympathetic attitude to the proposal, although some uncertainty was expressed as to whether alteration of the Versailles Treaty was involved. Successive attempts to form a new Cabinet in Austria to replace that of Dr. Otto Ender, which resigned June 16 after guaranteeing the foreign liabilities of the Kreditanstalt, were terminated last Saturday, when Dr. Karl Buresch formed a new coalition Government of the Christian-Socialist, Pan-German and Agrarian parties. Dr. Buresch, who was Governor of the Province of Lower Austria, was asked by President Miklas to take the Chancellorship after Mgr. Ignatz Seipel attempted unsuccessfully to form a coalition. The new Cabinet is substantially the same as that of Dr. Ender, most of the important Ministers retaining their portfolios. The chief change consists of the appointment of Dr. Joseph Redlich, an international financial authority, to the Finance Ministry to replace Dr. Guertler. Echoes of the financial crisis caused by the difficulties of the Kreditanstalt and the attempts to secure foreign aid were again heard in Vienna this week. Foreign Minister Schober made a confidential statement before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Austrian Parliament, Wednesday, of which the substance is reported in a dispatch to the New York \"Times.\" \"Dr. Schober asserted,\" the dispatch remarked,\"that France, when asked to lend the Austrian Government enough money to stave off the recent currency crisis, imposed conditions which would have made Austria a subservient State.\" He confirmed, it was added, that the conditions imposed by the French Government were, first, a demand that Austria relinquish the proposed customs union with Germany; second, that Austria ask a League of Nations inquiry into her • financial conditions and promise in advance to accept the advice given, and, third, that Austria obligate herself to inform France before concluding any future treaties affecting the political or economic situation in Europe. On receipt of these terms, they were shown to Sir Eric Phipps, British Ambassador to Vienna, it is said. \"The British Minister communicated with his Government,\" the report states, \"which is said to have agreed that the French conditions were intolerable, and the result was the Bank of England's advance of $21,000,000.\" 4647 attended by an expansion of £566,000 in circulation, reserves increased only £1,461,000.

The proportion of reserves to liabilities is now 59.11% compared with 58.03% a week ago and 48.79% a year ago. Loans on government securities decreased £445,000 and those on other securities £677,051.

Time money quotations hardened slightly early in the week, but otherwise no changes whatever were registered. Call loans were quoted at 13/2% on the Stock Exchange for all transactions, whether renewals or new loans. Offerings in the unofficial street market were reported in every session at 13i% or a concession of IA of 1% from the official level. Interest was occasioned by the announcement of four prominent savings banks in New York over the last week end that their interest rate on deposits would be reduced from 4 to 332% beginning July 1. This movement has been in progress for some time, and it was emphasized by a similar action on thrift accounts by a leading commercial bank, which lowered its rate from 23/2 to 2%, according to an announcement made Thursday. Brokers loans against stock and bond collateral declined $13,000,000 in the tabulation of the New York Federal Reserve Bank for the week to Wednesday night. Gold movements reported by the Federal Reserve reflect the financial crisis in Germany and depressed Canadian exchange, but as heavy gains in the metal again were made here the items are of general interest to the money market. The gold statement for the week to Wednesday night shows imports of $8,711,000, chiefly from Canada and Latin America, and a net decrease of $11,257,000 in the stock of the metal held earmarked for foreign account. An export of $10,000 was reported. The daily statement for Thursday reflected an import of $1,000,000 from Canada, while yesterday's statement showed a net gold gain of $27,510,000, divided into imports of $14,510,000 from Germany and $3,010,000 from Canada, and a decrease of $10,000,000 in the stock of metal held under earmark. The aggregate of earmarked gold held here is now placed unofficially at about $24,000,000. the outside figures. Quotations now are 13i% for 0® for 60 days; 13.,1%@)1%% for 90 30 day; 13(7 4@2% days; 13 4@1%% for four months, and 1Y for five and six months. Prime commercial paper was in excellent demand throughout the week but the supply of paper has continued short of the requirements. Rates for choice names of four to six months' maturity remain at 2Q234%. Names less well known and shorter choice names are still quoted at 23/2@23%. The market for prime bank acceptances was slow this week and the demand largely for short maturities during the forepart of the week, but it showed some improvement on Thursday and Friday. The supply of paper has been quite plentiful and greatly exceeded the demand. Rates are unchanged. The quotations of the American Acceptance Council continue at: For bills up to 90 days, 1% bid, %% 8% bid, 1% asked; / asked; for four months' bills, 11 for five and six months, 1%% bid and lh asked. The Federal Reserve Banks suffered a further decrease in their holdings of acceptances during the week from $106,814,000 to $106,390,000. Their holdings of acceptances for foreign correspondents from $378,717,000 to $367,700,000.

The foreign exchange market in New York is exceptionally inactive and quotations from day to day reflect European activities rather Dealing in detail with call loan rates on the Stock than transactions on this side. The range for Exchange from day to day, there was again no sterling exchange this week has been from 4.86% deviation at any time from the figure of 13/2%, this to 4.865 % for bankers' sight bills, compared with to 4.86% last week.

Following Monday's high points and activity in exchange the market dropped back and rates became irregularly easier. During the week sterling developed renewed firmness with respect to French francs, German marks, and most of the leading currencies. It is thought that the pound would have been much firmer at this time with respect to the dollar but for the untoward developments in the German financial situation since May 31. Despite the world-wide depression sterling is receiving fairly good support from tourist requirements and other seasonal factors, but the market is less inclined than it was a few weeks ago to expect the rate to go as high as 4.87. Nevertheless, London bankers are extremely optimistic over the exceptionally strong position of the Bank of England, but this optimism is largely curbed owing to the fact that so much of the gold acquired in recent weeks came from Germany to the great disturbance of all financial centres and foreign exchange transactions Money rates are easing off in London and it would seem that the Bank of England is disinclined to interfere with this tendency, whereas for a long time previously it had made every effort to hold money rates in London steady, if not firm, while its gold reserves were being replenished. There is even some talk in the market of a possible reduction in the Bank of England's official rate of rediscount, now at 23/2%, in July. Many bankers doubt that such a reduction will be made, but if it is and if bill rates in London are allowed to work lower, the policy will be pursued solely for the purpose of improving conditions in Germany and Central Europe. The Bank of England's gold holdings in the past week increased £2,026,783 to £164,013,586. Present bullion holdings compare with £157,773,290 on June 25 1930. It is believed that regardless of the large amount of gold received from Germany in recent weeks, the English bank plans to bring its gold holdings up to about £170,000,000 in preparation for autumn drain. The present increases in bullion make a total acquisition of £11,935,000 since May 28, when the Bank began to get gold from Germany. In order to relieve the general financial situation and the German crisis in particular, the Bank of England, the Bank of France, the Bank for International Settlements, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have joined in extending a temporary credit of $100,000,000 to the Reichsbank. The credit has been expected in this market for some time, but surprise is expressed that the amount involved was not larger. It is understood that the credit will run for 21 days. Its purpose is to enable the Reichsbank to meet heavy half-yearly settlements of June 30 and to stimulate improvement in the mark. The share of the New York Federal Reserve Bank is $25,000,000. On Saturday the Bank of England bought £36,092 in gold bars, received £19,000 in sovereigns from abroad, sold £92,717 in gold bars, and exported £12,000 in sovereigns.
