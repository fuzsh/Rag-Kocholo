        "text": "1980 was a year of baseball in Glens Falls, highlighted with Mayor Edward Bartholomew’s whirlwind recruitment of the White Sox, the Double A franchise of the Chicago White Sox, that played at East Field in Glens Falls for five seasons.\n\nGlens Falls was in competition with Schenectady and Pittsford and Worcester, Mass., among other cities, to land the team when Eastern Baseball League President Patrick McKiernan visited on Feb. 29, according to Post-Star archived reports.\n\nOn March 5, McKiernan told the city Common Council, “If you can deliver a field, you can have a baseball team.”\n\nOn March 12, the Common Council voted unanimously to develop East Field on Dix Avenue as a lighted-multi-use sports stadium.\n\nTeam ownership agreed to play home games the first season in the afternoons, if the city could install lights for the 1981 season.\n\nAs it turned out the lights were installed partway through the 1980 season.\n\nThe contract was signed April 7, and on April 19, Bartholomew, dressed in a White Sox uniform, threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the home opener.\n\n“God only knows how the White Sox franchise will fare in Glens Falls,” Post-Star reporter Dan Amon wrote. “But he at least gave a hint Saturday with mid-60s sunshine that attracted more than 6,000 fans to the hone opener at East Field.”\n\nThe announced attendance was 6,124, but many more watched the game for free from outside the East Field fence, Amon reported.\n\nIt seemed inconsequential that the White Sox lost the game to the Waterbury Reds.\n\nGlens Falls was ready for baseball – and not a minute late.\n\n“It was none of that nine-to-five stuff that got the field ready, but round-the-clock cooperation,” said city Public Works Superintendent Nicholas Sciartelli.\n\nAnother big crowd was on hand on Aug. 12 for a double header against the Lynn, Mass. Sailors, when the new field lights were turned on for the second game.\n\nLynn won the first game, but Glens Falls triumphed under the lights.\n\n“The story Tuesday night may have been the lights at East Field, but the Glens Falls White Sox put on their own light show, bombing the Lynn Sailors 14-3,” The Post-Star reported.\n\nIndeed, Old Man Winter, or Mother Nature, whichever gender metaphor you prefer, had been merely taking a nap to awake eight days later and dump more than two-and-a-half feet of snow on Glens Falls and the surrounding area in a Valentine’s Day blizzard that was anything but a sweetheart.\n\n“The city and the surrounding district was at the center of the storm scene, and, according to Professor C.L. Williams, between 30 and 32 inches had fallen before the wrath of the elements had been spent,” The Post-Star reported.\n\nWilliams, a physics and chemistry teacher at Glens Falls Academy, tracked the local weather and filed detailed monthly reports with the city Water Department.\n\nThirty-two inches of snow was reported in Hudson Falls, 39 inches in Fort Edward, and 45 inches in Corinth, the hardest hit of communities in the region.\n\nIn Glens Falls, it was the heaviest 24-hour snow fall since 1888, coming after just 13.5 inches of snow in the entire month of January 1914.\n\n“Those people who long wished for an old fashion winter have no cause to complain of the blizzard which descended in our midst and promises to remain for some time,” The Post-Star editorialized.\n\nLight snow began falling in Glens Falls at 10 p.m. Feb. 13, and had grown heavy by the next morning, continuing to fall until about 4 p.m. on Saturday, Valentine’s Day.\n\nDrifting would continue to be a problem, particularly on rural highways, for several days.\n\nDowntown shops and many area factories closed at noon Saturday.\n\nThe Union Bag Company shut down machines, fed its workers 600 sandwiches and then sent them home, staying shut down until Wednesday.\n\nThe twenty-five cent chicken pie supper at Psychical Hall was postponed until Tuesday.\n\nTrolley and rail service was interrupted, shifting transit demand to a limited number of horse-drawn taxies.\n\n“A well-known liveryman stated last evening that if all the horses in the city could have been secured Saturday noon they could not possibly have accommodated the demand for them.”\n\nEven horses had difficulty getting through the snow.\n\n“One (Hudson Falls) grocery firm with possibly more determination than its competitors sent its delivery sleigh across the Whitehall bridge,” The Post-Star reported. “Upon reaching a point near Feeder and LaBarge streets, the snow was found to be so deep that the animal could not move.”\n\nIt was peril mixed with artistry.\n\n“After the storm, the city, especially the business district, presented a sight beautiful to the eye,” The Post-Star reported.\n\nA Norse spirit prevailed as residents planted U.S. flags and comical signs in the tops of 10-to-12-foot snow banks.\n\nWhere a tunnel was shoveled through a snow bank to the entrance of Eastern Estate Tea Company, someone planted a sign, “Subway to Eastern Estate Tea Company.”\n\nThe blizzard brought an economic boom for able-bodied workers.\n\n“Scores of men who had been out of work for months were made happy by being given employment shoveling snow.”\n\nYet, the employment came at a cost.\n\nThe Hudson Valley Railway Co. took a $7,500 hit to its bottom line – the equivalent of $195,000 in 2019 dollars -- $5,000 for manpower and an estimated $2,500 in lost fares.\n\nThe company hired 75 men and used 15 teams of horses to clear snow from the tracks and haul the snow away.\n\nTrolley service was resumed in phases, starting with service between Glens Falls, Hudson Falls and Fort Edward at 6 p.m. Saturday and the first trolley car sent from Glens Falls to Troy at noon Sunday.\n\nThe Post-Star editorialized that city officials should not be lax in clearing snow from the streets.\n\n“It is not the time to stop to consider the expense. The health and comfort of our residents count more than money,” the editorial advised. “Get busy, ye city servants, and remove the snow.”\n\n—————\n\nSources: The Post-Star Feb. 3, 6, 16, 18, 19, 1914.\n\nHall’s, established in the early 1900s, sold its ice cream around Glens Falls from horse-drawn wagons as well as at its plant, and was a wholesale supplier to restaurants and grocery stores.\n\nIt is among several former ice cream manufacturers in Glens Falls.\n\nOthers include The Sugar Bowl and Dobert’s.\n\nBy 1922 Hall’s was a major wholesale supplier of premium ice cream around northern New York and Vermont.\n\n“It’s a broad statement but nevertheless a true one that go where you may you will find no more completely equipped ice cream plant than that operated by Hall Ice Cream Company on Maple Street,” The Post-Star reported.\n\nLocal customers could call “Ate-Ate-Ate,” a tongue-in-cheek homonym for the actual three-digit telephone number, to place an order.\n\nThe company advertised its product as a healthy dessert option.\n\n“One quart of ice cream is equal in energy food value to 1 2/3 lbs. of beefsteak; 3 ¾ lbs. of chicken; 4 1/3 lbs. of beans; 10 ¾ lbs. of tomatoes; 1 1/6 dozen of eggs,” claimed a 1921 advertisement in The Post-Star.\n\nByron E. Hall established Hall Ice Cream in the early 1900s at the Crandall Block, at the corner of South and Glen Streets.\n\nHe later incorporated the company with himself as president, Charles Smith, the plant superintendent, as vice president, and Powell J. Smith, brother of Charles, as secretary/ treasurer.\n\nPowell J. Smith also was associated with Empire Automobile Co.\n\nThe company moved in 1910 to 2 Maple Street, and then in 1914 to a newly constructed brick plant at 4 Maple St., the building that now is the offices of the Newell & Klingbiel law firm.\n\nBy 1915 the company was making 15 flavors of ice cream.\n\nIn 1916, the company had $25,000 in capital – the equivalent of $604,702 in 2020 dollars.\n\nIn January 1930, the company and plant were sold to Borden’s Ice Cream, which continued to use the Hall name, at least for a time.\n\nHall moved to Warrensburg, bought a restaurant, and was president of Warrensburg Chamber of Commerce.\n\nCharles Smith stayed on with Borden as manager of the Glens Falls plant, and later managed other Borden plants.\n\nPowell J. Smith increased his role with Empire Automobile Co.\n\nA “loud sounding horn” speaker was set up on the shop’s front counter, and the door was opened to determine if the music could be heard in the park and elsewhere.\n\nThe test was deemed a success.\n\n“Every note could be clearly heard as far away as the front of the Empire Theatre (about a block-and-a-half away on South Street) and in the rear of City Hall,” The Post-Star reported the next day. “No static nor any other disturbances marred the entertainment. The music and songs could be plainly heard throughout the park, as plainly and clearly as a band,” The Post-Star reported.\n\nSome mistakenly thought the music was coming from a phonograph.\n\n“The best tribute to the genius of the members of the firm was the comment of one man that he never appreciated radio until he heard last night’s concert.”\n\nThe concert included a full-live concert broadcast from WGY in Schenectady, other musical selections broadcast from stations in Louisville, Kentucky and Minneapolis, Minnesota, and news reports from The Detroit News.\n\nEarly on in commercial radio, music was primarily performed live.\n\nFederal law required stations to notify listeners if the station was broadcasting recorded music.\n\nWGY, which broadcast into the Glens Falls area, was one of the nation’s first commercial radio stations.\n\nEdgar A. Rice, a young Schenectady musician, conducted the studio orchestra when WGY made its first broadcast at 7:47 a.m. on Feb. 20, 1922, according to a station history on file at The Folklife Center at Crandall Public Library.\n\nWGY and its owner, General Electric Co., were pioneers in virtual concert technology, developing the first condenser microphone used in commercial radio in August 1922.\n\nIn 1922, relatively few families had radios in their homes.\n\n“I now have a radio receiving outfit in my library where I am entertained and inspired after a day or evening of work,” syndicated columnist George Matthew Adams wrote in his “Today’s Talk” column, published May 6, 1922 in The Post-Star. “I wish and hope that the time will come when every home may listen in. … It’s so marvelous!”\n\nRetailers such as Morf and Galusha staged public radio concerts to introduce radio technology, and hopefully entice people to buy radios.\n\n“A radio demonstration will be given under the auspices of the Odd Fellows in I.O.O.F. hall Friday evening at 7:30, old time. Richard Lawton of Glens Falls will be the operator. … A program of music and speeches will be given, broadcasted by the General Electric station in Schenectady. It is probable that Pittsburgh and Newark (stations) also will be heard,” The Post-Star reported on March 4, 1922.\n\nA radio concert was to be the main attraction of the upcoming Christian Endeavor Society fundraising social and sale at Hudson Falls Baptist Church, The Post-Star reported on June 7, 1922.\n\n“Glen Cornell, a local radio agent, will provide the equipment and furnish the operator. … “All those who desire are cordially invited to come and listen to the radio,” The Post-Star reported on June 7, 1922.\n\nThe second annual Industrial Exposition for Warren and Washington Counties, Sept. 11-16, 1922, at the Glens Falls Armory, featured radio concerts each afternoon and evening.\n\nRadio dealers weren’t the only ones using radio concerts to attract business.\n\n“C. Fay Newell has installed a radio phone in the read of his Broadway (Fort Edward) jewelry store and yesterday afternoon several invited friends listened with much interest to a concert given in the General Electric Company’s building in Schenectady,” The Post-Star reported on April 6, 1922.\n\nRadio enthusiasts in Glens Falls formed a club that had a club house on Thomson Avenue.\n\nMembership, like many social clubs of that era, was exclusive to males, but women were invited to some gatherings.\n\n“The Glens Falls Radio Club members last evening held the first in a series of ladies’ nights,“ The Post-Star reported on April 8, 1922. “More than fifty persons listened to a fine program picked up from several broadcasting stations and set their watches by the Arlington time signals.”\n\nLeonard Williams gave a talk about radio waves and the parts and functions of radios.\n\n“After the radio program, instrumental and vocal selections were rendered by members of the club, vocal numbers by Henry Gilbert being particularly pleasing.”\n\nLater in April, club members gathered to listen to a WGY experimental live broadcast of chimes being played at Watervliet, where they were recently cast for installation at the McKim Memorial Tower of the Church of the Epiphany at Washington, D.C.\n\n“Those who heard the concert said the chimes could be heard distinctly,” The Post-Star reported on April 28, 1922.\n\nIt would be more than two decades before AM radio broadcasting would take root in Glens Falls.\n\nThe first of several short-lived local radio stations went on the air in 1930.\n\nWWSC, the longest continuously operating radio station in Glens Falls, went on the air Dec. 18, 1946, and will celebrate its 75th anniversary this winter.\n\nWSET, later WBZA and now WMHL, went on the air on May 28, 1969.\n\nThe Glens Falls region enthusiastically embraced the “bicycle craze” of the 1880s and 1890s, a national phenomenon brought on by the inventions of safety bicycles, pneumatic bicycle tires and coaster brakes.\n\nNumerous bicycle clubs were formed in the greater Glens Falls area,\n\n“It is stated that several bicyclists of Glens Falls and Sandy Hill contemplate organizing a local club and joining the National Wheelman’s League,” The Morning Star reported on July 13, 1883.\n\n“A movement is a foot among several young bicyclists of Glens Falls to organize a club here, which will doubtless be accomplished in a few weeks, providing suitable quarters can be obtained,” The Morning Star reported on Nov. 3, 1883. “About forty persons have already signified their intention of becoming members of the organization, nine of whom are owners of machines in the Columbia pattern,” with a large front wheel and a tiny back wheel.\n\nOne of the local bicycle clubs, The Glens Falls Bicycle and Athletic Club, was established on March 22, 1887, and by early May had 107 members.\n\nThe club evolved into The Glens Falls Club, an elite men’s social club that had its club rooms on the upper floors of the building at the corner of Glen and Ridge Streets, the building where Northeastern Fine Jewelry is now located.\n\nThe Fort Edward Bicycle Club, another local club, often joined cross-country touring bicycle groups that passed through the area, riding along on the stretch between Fort Edward and Glens Falls, and sometimes on to Lake George.\n\nLocal clubs included several exclusive “century” clubs, so named because membership was restricted to cyclists that had ridden at least 100 miles in a single day.\n\nThe bicycle craze dwindled in the early 1900s, due to multiple factors, including the advent of the automobile, the laying of trolley tracks along road-side paths that bicyclists had used, and the development of other recreational pursuits, according to the National Museum of American History.\n\nBetween 1900 and 1905, the number of bicycle manufacturers in the United States dropped from 312 to 101.\n\nFor about the next 50 years, bicycling would be a mode of transportation primarily limited to children and teenagers.\n\nBut at the peak of the craze, bicycling was enjoyed by riders of all ages.\n\n“The bicycle craze has struck the line of boys over sixty years old, and several have ordered wheels,” The Morning Star reported on June 17, 1898.\n\nBicycle racing also was popular in Glens Falls.\n\n“Nature donned one of her highest smiles yesterday after noon, and the managers of the bicycle meet were correspondingly happy,” The Morning Star reported on Aug. 6, 1895. “The attendance was large and all things conspired to make the event a success.”\n\nThe program at The Mile Track, a harness racing track on Upper Coolidge Avenue, between Dixon Road and Sherman Avenue, featured both competitive and exhibition events.\n\nIn 1888, Dr. Birdsall built a hotel at Glen Lake, where many of his former Brooklyn patients came to vacation.\n\nEarly 20th century Post-Star history writer Howard Mason divided Glens Falls physicians into two categories: those who drove their own horses and those who had a driver.\n\nBirdsall was of the latter category – having a driver who chauffeured him around Glens Falls in a Victorian carriage, with the top down on days the weather was favorable.\n\nBirdsall apparently had farm animals on his property, because in 1886 the doctor won second place at the Warren County Fair for a six-month-old sow.\n\nBirdsall owned a St. Bernard dog, which, in 1894, wandered down Ridge Street and “quickly took possession” of a ham that was part of a merchandise display in front of the I. N. Scott & Sons grocery store.\n\n“Mr. Scott started in pursuit, but was unable to overtake the thief. He followed the dog, however, to Dr. Birdsall’s residence, and there found the animal enjoying a hearty meal, a good portion of the ham having already been devoured,” The Morning Star reported. “A number who witnessed the incident were heartily amused.”\n\nNo doubt, Dr. Birdsall paid for the ham.\n\nTo get an idea of the expanse of the mansion when it was a single-family home, nearly 200 people attended the wedding of Birdsall’s daughter in the parlor and dining room.\n\n“The stately mansion of Dr. and Mrs. Stephen T. Birdsall was transformed into a bower of floral beauty last evening, when their daughter, Miss Lillian Eloise Birdsall and Charles Blanchard Price, of Newark, N.J., were married amid a proliferation of Easter lilies, azaleas, roses and palms,” The Morning Star reported on April 23, 1908. “It was one of the prettiest weddings seen in Glens Falls in many a day and the most brilliant society event of the season.”\n\nPhil Rose Apartments owned the mansion for many years, dating back to around World War II until a few years ago.\n\nGrand Ridge Apartments owns it now.\n\nThe distinctive, historic brick structure still stands on Ridge Street.\n\nThe former house of worship has been used for offices since the 1970s.\n\nThe congregation organized in 1873, and met temporarily at 3 p.m. on Sundays at First Baptist Church of Glens Falls until land could be purchased and a sanctuary built.\n\nThe foundation was laid in October 1874, and construction was finished in 1875, at a cost of $1,300 – the equivalent of about $30,000 in 2021 dollars.\n\nQuaker faith had been common locally ever since Abraham Wing, a Quaker, founded Queensbury and Glens Falls in 1762.\n\nThe faith was long-noted for its emphasis on pacificism, abolition of slavery and equal rights for women.\n\nQuaker meetings are distinguished by allowing anyone who wishes to speak or pray.\n\nThe Rev. John Henry Douglas become the Glens Falls congregation’s first regular pastor in 1879, pastoring locally for about two years.\n\nHopefully the Glens Falls congregation was more generous than some of his earlier congregations had been.\n\n“My wife and child lived years in poverty. We tasted not of meat or wheat bread,” he said, speaking to a gathering of Quaker pastors in 1884.\n\nDouglas believed sermons should get to the point.\n\n“Don’t try to preach a long sermon. Just deliver the message that burns in the heart,” he advised. “Mind the life, whether the sermon be three minutes or three hours long. Be natural.”\n\nIn 1885, the Glens Falls congregation hosted the New York State Friends annual meeting.\n\n“The train which arrived here at four o’clock yesterday afternoon and at 7:30 in the evening brought large delegations of Friends, and the number now in town will approximate 130,” The Morning Star reported on May 28, 1885.\n\nMore would arrive in the days to come for pre-conference activities leading up to the May 29 opening of the six-day conference.\n\n“It has been an accepted maxim that the advent of Friends always brings a rain, but this is certainly a notable exception, as finer weather could not have been granted,” The Morning Star reported, of the opening day.\n\nEvangelist George W. Willis of Ohio, known as ‘the boy preacher,” was among the speakers.\n\nThe Rev. William Allen, a former black slave, was another speaker.\n\nAllen was born a slave April 2, 1818 in Greene County.\n\nHe was separated from his family at age 11 when his owner sold him.\n\nHis mother’s parting words were: “My boy, be good and kind to everybody. Love the Lord and he will take you out of trouble after a while.”\n\nAllen was freed at age 27 and went to Indiana where he learned to read and write, and later became a Quaker pastor.\n\n“His style of address is forcible and clear, illustrative and eminently practical,” The Morning Star reported.\n\nAfter the closing session, many of the conferees visited Lake George before leaving Glens Falls on the early train June 4.\n\n“The weather has been unusually pleasant, and even Sunday, when it was raining, the meeting house was crowded to its utmost capacity.”\n\nThe Glens Falls “Band of Hope,” a temperance organization, met at the brick church in the mid-1880s.\n\nIn 1886, the congregation broke from the Quaker tradition of exclusive a cappella singing when it accepted the loan of an organ from Dr. Stephen Birdsall, who lived in the nearby mansion at the corner of Ridge and Williams streets, a historic structure that is now an apartment building.\n\nIn 1973, the Glens Falls congregation left the building when the congregation merged with the South Glens Falls congregation.\n\n“Numbering about nine or ten active members, the Society of Friends will leave the brick church on Ridge Street they have occupied for the past 98 years,” The Post-Star reported.\n\nGary Walrath, director of the Glens Falls Historical Museum, now the Chapman Historical Museum, urged that the building be preserved, a wish that has been fulfilled.\n\n“The new and the old must not be in conflict with each other,” he said.\n\nSources: The Morning Star, Feb. 27, June 4, 1884; May 28, 29, June 4,5, 1885; The Glen’s Falls Republican, Jan. 26, 1873; Oct. 13, 1874; The Granville Sentinel, March 26, 1886; The Post-Star May 25, 1973; “History of Warren County,” H.P.

Braydon, music was an essential element of life.\n\n“Characterizing music as a luxury is not only inaccurate but dangerous,” he said in 1941. “Musical instruments should be considered tools of education and of trade.”\n\nIt all started in 1911, when Braydon left the Cluett & Son piano store, where he had worked for five years, to strike out on his own as a representative of Hallet, Davis & Co., the third largest piano manufacturer in the world, at the time.\n\n“Mr. Braydon belongs to a younger set of Glens Falls business men. He is well liked by all who know him and is a hustler,” The Post-Star reported on Oct. 16, 1911. “His rise in the piano world should be rapid.”\n\nBraydon also sold Conway, Lexington and Strauss pianos, working out of his home for a few months until he leased space in the Knickerbocker block on Warren Street, later the site of the Rialto Theatre.\n\nIn 1915, Braydon took on Fred B. Chapman, treasurer of Finch, Pruyn & Co., as a partner, and the business was moved to the Glens Falls Y.M.C.A. building on Glen Street, where Spot Coffee Café is now located on the ground floor.\n\nIn 1919, the business moved to its long-time location at what is now the intersection of Glen Street and Hudson Avenue.\n\nThe building previously was the First National Bank.\n\nBraydon and Chapman gave away plaster of paris souvenir figurines of the RCA “His Master’s Voice” dog at the 1919 grand opening of their new location.\n\n“It is quite evident that Braydon and Chapman have struck a popular chord with the public, because even the most sanguine expectations of an always critical public were surpassed so far as the completeness of the establishment is concerned,” The Post-Star reported on Nov. 13, 1919.\n\nOpening of the new store ushered in “a new epoch in the history of musical instrument and merchandising” in Glens Falls, The Post-Star reported on Nov. 12, 1919.\n\nThe business occupied all three floors of the building, accessible using an Otis elevator.\n\nEach room was decorated in a different color scheme.\n\nThe building later was renovated and expanded.\n\nBraydon’s wife operated the business after he died.\n\nNed Spain bought the business in 1965 and closed it in 1971 to focus on another musical store he operated at Colonie Center mall in the Albany area.\n\nA third roller skating rink, apparently short lived, opened at a vacant storefront at 104 Glen St.\n\nThe enthusiasm spread around the area.\n\n“The (Warrensburg) town meeting excitement is lost in the prospects of a roller skating rink in town,” the Warrensburg correspondent reported in The Morning Star.\n\nBradley Opera House in Fort Edward began offering skating March 13, with about 75 skaters turning out.\n\nSkating rinks opened at the Wilbur building and at Middleworth Hall at Sandy Hill, now Hudson Falls, and elsewhere in Washington County.\n\n“The roller skating fever struck Argyle on Friday the 21st (of March), … since which time people of all ages have been seen approaching the town hall with light, elastic step and smiling, joyous countenance,” the Washington County Advertiser reported. “But, alas, the bandaged head and halting gait on the homeward trail told another tale. The epidemic will doubtless soon be over.”\n\nWithin months roller skating rinks would open in Chestertown, Fort Ann, Saratoga, Schuylerville, Port Henry, Watertown, and Amsterdam, some of which were operated by Glens Falls entrepreneurs.\n\nThe propensity of rinks led to competition.\n\nThe manager of the rink at the Wilbur building at Sandy Hill offered free round-trip excursion sleigh transportation from downtown Glens Falls.\n\nOther rinks staged special events such as professional trick skating performances, masquerade parties and potato races – in which a bushel of potatoes was placed on one end of the rink, and an empty basket at the other.\n\nThe skater that successfully carried the most potatoes from one basket to the other won.\n\nRoller skating in Glens Falls was temporarily halted when the “Second Great Fire of Glens Falls” swept through downtown on April 28, 1884, destroying Meredith B. Little Opera House and Glens Falls Opera House, among other buildings.\n\nBut roller skating would not be stopped for long.\n\nAn out-of-town investment group already had plans in the works for construction of a new rink, designed specially for roller skating, at the corner of Wait and Horicon streets.\n\n“The floor will be of yellow birch, which is considered the best and most durable that can be procured,” The Morning Star reported. “The interior will be conveniently arranged, modern style, and lighted with gas throughout.”\n\nJapanese lanterns were hung, bunting put up, and a 13-piece brass band hired for the July 3 grand opening, that featured a trick, fancy and acrobatic skating demonstration by the Nicholas twins of North Adams, Mass.\n\nBetween 150 and 200 skaters turned out.\n\nOther nights the rink would draw as many as 250 skaters.\n\nTwo other short-lived rinks – The Glen on Warren Street and The Bijou in the Crandall Block, opened in late 1884 or early 1885.\n\nLike Humpty Dumpty in the nursery rhyme, the rink at the corner of Wait and Horicon streets had a great fall.\n\nA year or so after the opening, the owners stopped paying their bills.\n\n“It was run under competent management for some time, but when the roller skating craze commenced to wane, the building was sold at public auction,” The Morning Star reported.\n\nMrs. M.A. Gould, who owned the land the skating rink was built on, was the buyer.\n\nGould’s daughter, for a time, attempted to keep the venture operating as a roller skating rink, but the building fell into disrepair.\n\nIn early 1887, village officials condemned the building, and on Feb. 27 the roof collapsed around 1 or 2 a.m. due to the weight of heavy snow, and the building had to be demolished.\n\nDuring its short run, roller skating brought new revenue to area theaters, as roller skating sessions filled nights in between theatrical productions, nights on which the theater otherwise would be dark.\n\nBut in the long run, roller skating damaged theater floors and competed with other forms of entertainment.\n\n“The Middleworth Hall floor, which cost between three and four hundred dollars, was of the very best quality of Georgia pine, and which was considered the best floor for dancing purposes in this section of the country, is completely ruined by the roller skating,” the Washington County Advertiser reported.\n\nWhitmore & Clark’s Minstrel Company disbanded in 1884, ending its season $2,000 in the red – the equivalent of about $53,000 in 2020 dollars – the first year the company lost money.\n\n“The company was a strong one, but the skating rinks everywhere took all the change there was laying around loose,” The Morning Star reported.\n\nSkating was blamed for siphoning off revenue from other businesses, such as a barber in Sandy Hill who had to lay off help.\n\n“He alleges as a reason that the young men who heretofore got shaved two or three times a week now only shave once and spend their money at the rink.”\n\n—————\n\nSources: The Morning Star Feb. 29, March 5, 8, 14, 15, 20, 22, 24, 29, April 1, 5, 8, 16, 29, June 11, July 3,4, 1884;

Was it a plane? Was it a hot air balloon carrying the actor who portrayed Super Man?\n\nActor Christopher Reeve was scheduled to visit the closing day of the Adirondack Balloon Festival in 1990 to take a balloon flight with pilot Thomas Ford of Queensbury, The Post-Star reported several times before and during the festival.\n\nIt is not clear from news reports if Reeve did, in fact, take the flight.\n\nTwenty years ago — 2000\n\nThe Food Channel cable television network filmed an episode of the show “Food 911” at the 2000 Adirondack Balloon Festival.\n\nHost Tyler Florence prepared a picnic dinner of fried chicken, baked beans and potato salad.\n\nPilot Van Anderson of Morgantown, Va. transported the host on a short balloon ride.\n\nTen years ago – 2010\n\nThe conditions for ballooning looked excellent, both in the air and on the ground, for the opening launch at Crandall Park in 2010.\n\n“OK – I’ll tell the people to come. … There will be thousands of them,” said Walter Grishkot, the festival’s co-founder and long-time organizer.\n\nOne who had already come was a woman wearing a vest covered with ballooning pins, an obvious veteran of festivals past. “That woman with all the pins, if she jumped in the lake, she’d go straight down (to the bottom)!”\n\nWalt made his way around the park, telling stories, selling programs and selling posters, as he had done at 37 previous festivals. He went through the same spiel with everyone he met, laughing at his own jokes as if he was hearing them for the first time.\n\nPoking a little fun at the ballooning team from Saga City, Japan, he asked, “OK – do we have anyone here from Brooklyn?”\n\nThe balloonists laughed – once the joke made its way through translation.\n\nIt would be the organizer’s last Adirondack Balloon Festival.\n\nGrishkot died on May 11, 2011, at age 85.\n\nPortions of this column are excerpted from Thompson’s 2011 book “The Biggest Kid at the Balloon Festival: The Walter Grishkot Story,” available locally at The Chapman Historical Museum gift shop.\n\nThe 1,200-seat Paramount had the largest seating capacity of any theater in the Glens Falls area when it opened on Jan. 22, 1932.\n\n“The new theatre building is of such beauty and design as to warrant admiration of thousands who will inspect it,” The Post-Star reported at the time.\n\nThe theater had a “modestly Colonial” exterior and a Spanish interior design.\n\nIts 22-to-24-inch wide seats provided comfort, and the theater was wired with the latest in sound technology.\n\nOrganist Bob Hamilton performed on a three-manual organ positioned on an elevator-raised platform.\n\n“A very striking effect takes place when music is heard and the organist comes up from seemingly nowhere,” The Post-Star reported.\n\n“Two Kinds of Women,” starring Miriam Hopkins, Phillips Holmes and Irving Pichel was the opening-night feature film.\n\nAdmission for all seats was 50 cents – the equivalent of $9.06 in 2020 dollars.\n\nOver the decades, attendance at the theater, as at downtown movie theaters around the nation in general, waned as new multi-screen theaters opened outside downtown.\n\nAround 1976, the owner of The Paramount put it up for sale, asking $85,000.\n\nIn June 1978, Kamyr Inc., a company that manufactured machinery for the paper industry, bought the building for $40,000 and closed the theater.\n\nKamyr owned The Queensbury Hotel, across the street, and had its office building at the corner of Ridge and Lawrence streets.\n\nBy that time, The Paramount was showing salacious movies, which Kamyr officials thought detracted from the neighborhood’s quality of life.\n\nIn March 1979, Mark Frost, then an announcer at WWSC radio and now editor of The Chronicle weekly newspaper, organized a group that made a last-ditch effort to find an investor that would buy the building and reopen it as a theater showing older and foreign films.\n\nKamyr demolished the building in August 1979 to develop a parking lot in conjunction with an expansion of its office building.\n\nThe Paramount was the last of four historic movie theaters to close downtown.\n\nThe Park, on Park Street, closed in 1933. Developer Elizabeth Miller bought the building in 2014, and renovated it for a performing arts center and restaurant that opened in 2018.\n\nEmpire Theatre, on South Street, closed in 1949. Developer Mike Kaidas bought the building in 2007 and renovated it for a retail, office and apartment complex.\n\nThe Rialto, on Warren Street, was demolished in 1969.\n\nThe State Theater, on Warren Street, closed in 1953 and the building was demolished in 1969.\n\n————\n\nSources: The Post-Star Jan. 22, 1932; June 1, 1933; Dec. 29, 1947; Feb. 27, March 18, 1970; June 13, 24, 1978; March 17, Aug. 22, 1979; July 19, 2014; “Bridging the Years,” The Glens Falls Historical Association, 1978\n\n“The twenty-seventh annual fair of the Warren County Agricultural Society will commence today, apparently under very favorable circumstances,” The Morning Star of Glens Falls reported on Sept. 11, 1883. “The society has spared neither pains nor expense to make this one of the most successful exhibitions ever held here, and have offered extra inducements in the way of premiums and amusements.”\n\nA new 2,000-seat grandstand, overlooking the half-mile harness racing track, had been built earlier in the year.\n\nAn August drought had left farmers pessimistic about the harvest.\n\n“The pastures are baked and dried up so that stock can get neither sufficient food nor water,” The Morning Star had reported on Aug. 29. “In some localities water has to be carted to them in barrels and hay from the late harvest fed out to keep the animals from starving.”\n\nWeather suddenly shifted to the opposite extreme a few days later, and an early frost damaged corn and buckwheat crops in some parts of Warren County.\n\nStill, it was time for the annual celebration of agricultural lifestyle, and Glens Falls businesses were ready to host the influx of visitors.\n\n“Glen Street, from Monument Square to the fairgrounds, will be sprinkled daily (to keep dust down), as will the track at the grounds.”\n\nA dozen 10-foot x 6-foot banners, advertising local businesses, had been hung around the outside of the fairgrounds fence.\n\nIn Domestic Hall, giant crayon portraits of Russell Mack Little, co-founder and president of Glens Falls Insurance Co., and of Dr. A.W. Holden, a local physician, historian and newspaper writer, were displayed.\n\nAgricultural Hall had 303 entries, and the Home Industry building about 550 entries.\n\nLocal wagon and carriage makers, Nelson LaSalle, Griffen & Wood, Miller & Snyder, Joubert & White, and J.P. Bullard exhibited at Manufacturer’s Hall.\n\nAt Floral Hall, the W.F. Bissel piano and organ dealership was set up on one side, and the Wilson and Singer sewing machine companies on the other.\n\n“The usual number of refreshment booths, vendors, and catch-penny gamesters are in attendance, all eager to reap a golden harvest during the fair.”\n\nFair week weather was mixed, and managers wound up extending the fair an extra day to make up some events that were postponed due to rain.\n\nAttendance was generally strong.\n\nOn Day #1, the weather “was all that anyone could wish, and the countenances of the managers …, as well as all others interested in the welfare of the exhibits, wore a smile.”\n\nAs of 6 p.m., receipts were $497 – the equivalent of $12,685 in 2020 dollars – about $50 more than the 1882 first day receipts.\n\nReceipts the second day were $300, about the same as the previous year.\n\nMoulton & Johnson’s minstrel band and harness racing were the major attractions.\n\n“An exciting race took place in the morning between G.W. Conklin’s Topsy and W.S. Tuttle’s Jerry, which was won by the former. The race was trotted on a wager of a new hat. The horses were well matched and made a close race, which was watched with interest by a number of spectators.”\n\nAbout 5,000 people, an “unusually large” crowd, attended on Day #3, despite a drizzling rain that began about 1 p.m. and turned into heavy showers, lasting the rest of the day.\n\nVolunteer firefighter hose racing was the featured event, featuring four departments from Glens Falls.\n\nHose racing was a sport that involved a team of firefighters pulling a hose cart on a track for a measured distance, usually 100 yards but sometimes as much as 400 yards.\n\nAt the finish line the team connected a nozzle, and released a spray of water.\n\nA combination of speed and skill, and maybe a bit of luck, was required to win.\n\n“The Cunninghams showed the finest burst of speed of the day,” but finished second to the Littles.\n\n“They (Cunninghams) passed under the wire in quicker time than any of their competitors, and would probably have won first prize had their pipe man been more agile.”\n\nThe Colvins and The Cashions also competed.\n\nTempers flared at the victory celebration, and Roger Sullivan, a member of The Colvins, “assaulted” Daniel O’Leary, foreman of The Littles.\n\n“Officer Reed, who was present, took the assailant before Justice Stearns.”\n\nThe judge, at O’Leary’s request, released Sullivan upon payment of court costs.\n\nDay # 4 receipts were $205.50 ahead of the previous year.\n\nA one-hour storm at about 3 p.m. forced the cancellation of harness racing events, because the track was too wet to race safely.\n\nManagement extended the fair an extra day, which provided an opportunity for a firefighter hose race rematch, of sorts.\n\nThis time there were three teams: The Colvins, The Cashions and The Cunninghams, who had picked up a few ringers.\n\n“A short time previous to the start, the editor of a Morning Star contemporary, who represents the Colvin Hose Company, entered a protest against Cunningham Hose, claiming that the latter team was composed of picked runners, including two members of the Little Hose.”\n\nPresumably the “editor” filing the protest was Addison B. Colvin, publisher of The Glens Falls Daily Times and patron of The Colvin Hose Company, or perhaps one of Colvin’s staff.\n\n“The judges, however, decided not to interfere, as it was previously understood who were to run in each company.”\n\nThe victorious Cunninghams set a new Glens Falls record.\n\nThe county fair came to Glens Falls after a group of local residents in 1869 bought 28 acres of land off Lincoln Avenue and Kensington Road, to the south of Crandall Park, and constructed the half-mile track and several buildings.\n\nThe fairgrounds became outmoded when the one-mile track at Broad Acres was constructed around 1890.\n\nArthur W. Sherman and R.A. Little bought the old fairgrounds in 1895 for housing development, and opened up Coolidge and Horicon Avenues.\n\n———\n\nSources: The Morning Star Aug. 29; Sept. 1, 11-17, 1883; “Listening In,” Dennis O’Connell, published 2009 by City of Glens Falls; “Bridging the Years,” published 1978 by Glens Falls Historical Association\n\n“It is large enough to accommodate about a dozen people,” The Morning Star had reported earlier in March. “Mr. Crandall is quite enthusiastic over the launch.”\n\nIt was great addition to the park that Crandall, a Glens Falls lumber baron, real estate investor and philanthropist, started in 1883. He purchased an initial parcel of land, which included the pond, for $30,000 – the equivalent of about $765,000 in 2020 dollars, and gradually added adjoining land.\n\nHis life and career embodied the great American rags-to-riches dream.\n\n“No boy in this city was in poorer circumstances than I was when I set out on life’s journey,” Crandall said around the time of his 92nd birthday. “But everyone can reach success if he will refrain from bad habits and cultivate the habit of saving money.”\n\nBy 1899 he had increased the park land and surrounding property to 70 acres.\n\nAddison B. Colvin, publisher of the Glens Falls Times, wrote in 1931 about when workmen in 1899 were building the monument in Crandall Park, which the lumber baron – who used a five-point star as his log mark – and his wife, and horse, would later be buried underneath.\n\nAs the legend goes, one of the workmen quipped, “Mr. Crandall, when you are buried here, after a time you will be forgotten.” So, Henry took off a shoe and stocking and left his footprint in the cement.\n\nEarly amenities of the park such as a rudimentary golf course, elaborate fountain, and a Civil War cannon are long gone, and forgotten by many. The fountain and cannon were melted down in 1942 to make armaments for World War II. The golf course disappeared some time in the early 20 th century.\n\nBut Crandall, who died in 1913, has not been forgotten, and some suggest his child-like spirit still inhabits Henry’s playground, a park open for all to enjoy.\n\n“Each succeeding day develops new beauties at Crandall Park, and the increasing number of visitors shows that they are appreciated,” The Morning Star reported in 1900.\n\nThe golf course, a five-hole course set up using tomato cans and crude clubs, was constructed in 1901. Croquet also was a popular sport. “A number of ladies who play croquet at Crandall Park gave a luncheon at the golf house Saturday evening in honor of J.R. Duell, to show their appreciation of the excellent condition in which he has kept the grounds,” The Morning Star reported. “Mr. Duell was very pleasantly surprised and wishes to thank the ladies for their kindness.”\n\nBy summer of 1901, use of the park had become so great that Glens Falls village trustees hired a special constable, at an annual salary of $5, to patrol the park.\n\nCrandall generously allowed community groups to use the park, such as the Glens Falls Woman’s Club, which moved its Sept. 22, 1909 clambake to Crandall Park a few days before the event, after selling more tickets at $1.50 each – the equivalent of $42.49 in 2020 dollars – than what Harris’ Grove, the original location, could accommodate. “Crandall Park will be the scene of one of the greatest and most enjoyable gatherings ever held there,” The Post-Star reported. “Fun will run rampant, and there will be an abundance of things eatable, the much-coveted clam being agreed to sacrifice his life in honor of the occasion.” Funds raised benefited the Warren County visiting nurses service.\n\nCrandall set aside one acre of the park in 1910 for the newly organized Boy’s Conservation League of Glens Falls, an organization for boys ten and older, to plant 1,200 white pine saplings that the state Department of Forestry was to deliver in Arbor Day. The club planted 2,000 more saplings in 1913.\n\nMayor S.D. Kendrick said a few kind words at 2 p.m. Dec. 23, 1911, and the curtain opened for the debut program of first-run silent films, illustrated sing-along reels, and live entertainment, including Richard Cole and a colleague singing a duet, “Silver Threads Among the Gold,” written by lyricist Eben Eugene Rexford, a Johnsburg native.\n\nEarl Benedict led a four-piece orchestra of violin, piano, saxophone and drums.\n\nVaudeville acts, booked through the United Family Time Circuit, joined the regular lineup two days later.\n\nAmong the acts appearing at the theater in its first few weeks were magician Frederick Hurd, shadowgraph artist Frazee, and comedian Floretta Clark.\n\nCapacity afternoon and evening crowds became the norm at the 800-seat theater.\n\n“The Park Theatre is offering the best ten cents worth of amusement to be found in the city,” The Post-Star reported.\n\nThe dime admission – the equivalent of $2.70 in 2020 dollars – would be a bargain today, even when adjusted for inflation.\n\nA six-lane bowling alley opened in the theater’s basement in mid-January, with four lanes for large pins and two lanes for candle and duck pins.\n\nThe owners intended to draw spectators, not just bowlers, by organizing three local bowling teams, the “Park Five,” the “Park Candlers,” and the “Champions” to compete with top teams visiting from out of town.\n\nThe Post-Star heralded the advent of The Park Theatre as not just an entertainment bonanza, but an economic development catalyst.\n\n“There is no doubt that the new theatre will do much toward putting Park Street on a plane with the leading streets in the city.”\n\nThe original owners, who sold the theater two years later, were all Park Street business men.\n\nJames and Fred Bellen owned a bottling works, Isaac Ginsburg a discount department store, and Joe Miller a restaurant.\n\nThe Park was the only motion picture theater operating in Glens Falls at the time.\n\nThe Empire Theatre on South Street was still booking only live stage shows at the time.\n\nThe former Wonderland Theatre had operated at 23 Ridge Street from February 1907 to October 1909, and there had been a couple of early temporary makeshift motion picture theaters in downtown.\n\nNew owners that purchased The Park Theatre in 1913 installed a pipe organ, which was improved with added features in 1916.\n\nIn 1919 the pipe organ was moved to the newer Rialto Theatre on Warren Street, as The Park switched its focus to just motion pictures.\n\nThe Rialto Corp. was operating both theaters at the time.\n\nThe Depression era economy and competition from newer motion picture theaters brought an end to the operation, but it would eventually have a second life as a theater more than eight decades later.\n\nThe Park Theatre closed temporarily in late 1932.\n\nIt re-opened in January 1933, showing second-run features, but closed permanently a few months later.\n\nBy that time, four other theaters were showing motion pictures downtown: The Rialto, Paramount, State and Empire.\n\nThe Glens Falls Post Co., publisher of The Post-Star and Glens Falls Times, purchased the theater building in 1937, and used it as a printing plant until the 1970s.\n\nThe building fell into disrepair over the years, and at one point was slated for demolition, but a community advocacy organization stopped it.\n\n“Movie folks will always draw larger crowds than Veeps,” Walter Winchell wrote in a September 1957 syndicated column. “When Richard Nixon visited Glens Falls, NY, about 1,500 people turned out. When actress Natalie Wood arrived there to film ‘Marjorie Morningstar,’ near there, over 8,000 greeted her.”\n\n(Nixon flew into Warren County in 1954 to speak at a National Association of Governors conference at The Sagamore in Bolton Landing. But that’s another story for another time.)\n\nWinchell’s math may have been a little bit off.\n\nThe Lake George Mirror estimated about 4,000 people, still a big crowd, turned out at Warren County airport the evening of Aug. 19 to watch planes land.\n\nArthur P. Irving, publisher of The Post-Star and Glens Falls Times, was there to greet the celebrities on behalf of Joseph Freiber, owner of Scaroon Manor, a resort hotel on the border of Warren and Essex counties, where about two-thirds of the movie would be filmed.\n\nThe land where the hotel once stood is now a state Department of Environmental Conservation campground.\n\nMost of the cast and crew – about 50 people -- arrived on a chartered United Airlines DC7B flight with space for up to 104 passengers, the largest plane to land at Warren County airport, up to that point.\n\nThe plane flew in from Hollywood.\n\nWood arrived on a separate flight from New York City, for about three weeks of filming.\n\nCast and crew were transported from the airport, in Queensbury, to the resort via bus.\n\nThere also was a large crowd, “almost like a circus day,” at the Glens Falls rail yard for the arrival on Aug. 16 of a freight train loaded with cameras, motion picture equipment, costumes and props.\n\nEntertainment writers frequently interviewed actors and actresses during the three-week filming over dinner at The Queensbury Hotel.\n\nIt would be nice to say that the publicity coup for the Adirondacks was the result of some well-thought-out Chamber of Commerce recruitment strategy.\n\nThe truth is that a site selection consultant remembered his honeymoon at Scaroon Manor 22 years earlier, and suggested it would be the ideal location for scenes set at “Southwinds Hotel” in the Catskills.\n\n“They went, they saw, and decided this was the place that had the beauty, joyousness and excitement of an eastern mountain playground,” wrote Post-Star reporter Alice C. Armstrong.\n\nWarner Brothers hired many regular resort guests and area residents as extras.\n\nTrumpet player John Marine of Hudson Falls, a member of Glens Falls City Band, performed background music in several outdoor scenes.\n\nSteve Gitto and The Blue Jacks, a Glens Falls area four-piece band, performed in several scenes.\n\nThe band would be the first to separately record “A Very Precious Love,” which Kelly sang in the movie.\n\nThe movie version of the song was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Song category.\n\nThe movie, based on the novel of the same name by Herman Wouk, revolved around Hunter College student Marjorie Morgenstern, who while working at a summer camp, fell in love with a 32-year-old aspiring playwright working at a nearby summer theater.\n\nThe movie was noted for including scenes depicting Jewish religious life, including a Passover Seder.\n\nIt won a Hollywood Foreign Press award for best film promoting international understanding.\n\nThe French Theatre Association selected it as best film of the year.\n\nCarolyn Jones, who portrayed Marsha Zelenko, won a Golden Globe for Most Promising Newcomer – Female.\n\nThe 19-year-old Wood, who abandoned her previous trademark pixie haircut, viewed the role as her evolution from child star to adult actress.\n\n“It shows the transition of a naïve, wide-eyed girl into a mature woman with a real understanding of life,” Wood told Glens Falls Times reporter Hal Boyle.\n\nThere was off-camera intrigue with actor Robert Wagner, Wood’s boyfriend and later husband, on location much of the time.\n\n“Wagner, who isn’t in the film, haunts the set all day and is definitely in the picture as soon as cameras cease grinding,” Boyle wrote. “After work, he and Natalie, who is chaperoned by her mother and young sister, Lana, are as close as two holes in Swiss cheese.”\n\nLana, 11 years old, had a small part in the movie.\n\n—————\n\nSources: The Post-Star Aug. 15, 19, Sept. 6, 7,251957; April 25, July 18, 1958; Aug. 7, 1965; Glens Falls Times Aug. 14, 29, 30, Sept. 10, 19, 1957; Lake George Mirror, Aug. 23, 1957; imbd.com"
