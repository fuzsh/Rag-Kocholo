We have the right as constituents to go directly to our legislators and speak to them about issues that matter to us. Using our voices to inform legislators about the issues through storytelling is one of the most democratic actions we can take and is a proven tactic in building support. In this session, we will review how to effectively meet with your legislators, including how to define proper roles, make a hard “ask,” and effectively follow up. We will build on commonly known best practices and layer in advanced techniques to help get you closer to your goal.\n\nPresenters\n\nClaire Douglass, National Campaigns Manager, National Audubon Society\n\nTalya Tavor, National Campaigns Manager, National Audubon Society\n\nMaddox Wolfe, Coastal Campaigns Manager, National Audubon Society\n\nJaime Sigarán, National Campaigns Associate, National Audubon Society\n\nFledge the Next Generation! Build a Student Campus Chapter\n\nCollege-age students and Audubon chapter leaders will learn how to engage and integrate the next generation of bird lovers and conservationists into Audubon. Participants will learn pragmatic lessons for achieving that goal through an Audubon campus chapter. You will learn how to build bridges between today’s leaders and the next generation of young conservationists. Presenters created the Green Bay Audubon Student Conservation Chapter at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay; they are eager to share with others how easy it is to create and support a local student campus chapter.\n\nPresenters\n\nBrandon Byrne, Student Secretary, Green Bay Audubon Student Conservation Chapter\n\nJacob Woulf, Student Secretary, Green Bay Audubon Student Conservation Chapter\n\nErin Giese, Staff Advisor to Green Bay Audubon Student Conservation Chapter and President of Northeastern Wisconsin Audubon Society\n\nWorking with Nontraditional Partners to Achieve Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Goals\n\nThoughtful engagement of new and nontraditional partners in our work can have a great impact in our communities. This session will focus on developing nonconservation partners for engagement programs to better tie Audubon work into the life of the community. This panel will illustrate key steps for co-developing programs with community partners using experiences from Birmingham Audubon’s long-term efforts with Putnam Middle School, a predominantly African-American Birmingham, Alabama, public school, and Audubon Great Lakes’ Wild Indigo program for engaging communities of color in Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit, Michigan. We will discuss recruiting partners, assessing community interests, and involving partners in event/project planning.\n\nPresenters\n\nTroy Peters, Engagement Manager, Audubon Great Lakes\n\nAnsel Payne, Executive Director, Birmingham Audubon Society\n\nCarina Ruiz, Community Engagement Manager, Audubon Great Lakes\n\nStrengthening Network and Membership Diversity: Conversations Beyond Difference\n\nAchieving racial and cultural diversity and inclusion are important goals for our network because the United States is a diverse nation and growing increasingly so. As a result, it is important that we have the tools to understand the barriers and challenges that impede us in our efforts to engage people in opportunities that strengthen our mission to protect birds and the places they need. This session will explore ways to have conversations that bolster the knowledge of our chapters and communities. We will explore strategies and provide tools that address three critical questions: Why don’t we talk about race and cultural differences? Why should we? How can we talk about race and culture without fear, guilt, and shame?\n\nPresenters\n\nDeeohn Ferris, Vice President of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, National Audubon Society\n\nAllison Manswell, Path Forward Consulting\n\nTykee James, Government Affairs Coordinator, National Audubon Society\n\nDigital Storytelling and Social Media Mastery\n\nFacebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube, and more—trying to keep up with the ever-growing suite of social media platforms can seem overwhelming. How can you survive, much less thrive? In this session, we will show how focusing on basic principles of digital storytelling will help ensure you have the tools to adapt to social media trends and weather the changing digital landscape. We will also explore free and low-cost tools that can help you do more in less time. Learn which platforms are best to reach, engage, and activate your audiences and how you can build a vibrant, supportive online community.\n\nPresenters\n\nElizabeth Sorrell, Vice President of Audience Engagement, National Audubon Society\n\nPreeti Desai, Director of Social Media and Storytelling, National Audubon Society\n\nBuilding Your Plants for Birds Program\n\nThis session is for chapters that have not participated in Plants for Birds activities before. Audubon’s Plants for Birds team has developed a suite a resources to support native plant activities wherever they occur across the country (including customizable templates, presentations, etc.). The team will spend the first half of the session showcasing the various resources and the second half of the session facilitating small groups in the use and customization of the resources.\n\nPresenters\n\nJohn Rowden, Director of Community Conservation, National Audubon Society\n\nMarlene Pantin, Partnerships Manager, National Audubon Society\n\nRoslyn Rivas, Plants for Birds Program Coordinator, National Audubon Society\n\n12:00pm – 1:00pm\n\nLunch\n\n1:15pm – 2:45pm\n\nAudubon’s Vision: Restoring the Gulf of Mexico for Birds and People\n\nThis session will highlight Audubon’s vision for bird recovery in the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of the BP oil spill and other stressors such as climate change and hurricanes. Learn about Audubon’s Gulf Restoration Plan and how it is used to inform conservation action. Participants will see the importance of community engagement, coastal stewardship, and habitat restoration for Gulf flagship birds, understand how the modeling can inform conservation planning, and discuss how equity, diversity, and inclusion are vital to successful restoration efforts.\n\nPresenters\n\nKara Lankford, Director, Gulf Coast Restoration, National Audubon Society\n\nNicole Michel, Ph.D., Senior Quantitative Ecologist, National Audubon Society\n\nCharles Allen, Community Engagement Director, Audubon Louisiana\n\nSarah Pacyna, Director, Coastal Bird Stewardship Program, Audubon Mississippi\n\nRenewable Energy, Climate, and Birds\n\nAudubon’s 2014 Climate Report tells us that we need to transform our energy sector more rapidly with renewable energy or 314 species of birds may face severe declines by 2080. Wind and solar energy both have impacts on birds. This session will provide tools and strategies to advocate for renewable energy projects that are well sited to avoid, minimize, and mitigate effectively the impacts on birds.\n\nPresenter\n\nGarry George, Renewable Energy Director, National Audubon Society\n\nBuilding an Effective, Mission-Driven Board\n\nThis session provides tools to reboot your recruitment practices to achieve an effective, mission-driven, diverse board. Most boards understand the potential benefits of diversity and inclusion in building an effective, mission-driven board. This session builds on Audubon’s Statement on Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, focusing specifically on board composition. Strategic board composition does not happen without conscious effort. Learn how to define what constitutes the ideal board—not just in terms of expertise, experience, and networks, but also in how it reflects the organization’s goals of diversity and inclusion. Then you can achieve this vision through focused and disciplined board recruitment.\n\nPresenter\n\nVicki Clark, Senior Governance Consultant, BoardSource\n\nFinding Volunteers to Support Your Chapter and Audubon's Mission\n\nDedicated volunteers have been helping birds for more than 100 years of Audubon's history. This session will focus on finding new volunteer leaders who will keep Audubon strong for the next 100 years. Learn about sources for potential volunteers and how to describe opportunities available through your organization. Engaging diverse volunteer applicant pools will be an area of special focus. Examples of volunteer recruitment methodologies will be provided for you to use with your fellow chapter leaders.\n\nPresenter\n\nNina Lapitan, Volunteer and Rental Services Manager, Aullwood Audubon Center\n\nPlease Note: This session is also offered on Sunday at 1:15pm.\n\nBring Power to Issue-based Advocacy Campaigns\n\nAudubon work is based on evidence-based science, which not only gives us a framework and a skillset to understand the world, but an edge when it comes to protecting birds. But facts alone are not enough to change hearts and minds. Understanding how to acquire and apply power helps us envision a world different from our own—a better world—and what role we play in changing it. In this session, you will learn what power is, how to get it, and what we can do to advance Audubon’s policy agenda once we have it.\n\nPresenters\n\nClaire Douglass, National Campaigns Director, National Audubon Society\n\nTalya Tavor, National Campaigns Manager, National Audubon Society\n\nMaddox Wolfe, Coastal Campaigns Manager, National Audubon Society\n\nJaime Sigarán, National Campaigns Associate, National Audubon Society\n\nAudubon Careers: Panel with David Yarnold and other key Audubon staff\n\nThis panel discussion, for young professionals and leadership volunteers at varying stages of their careers, will provide useful insights into life journeys that lead to working for Audubon. Audubon staff have remarkably varied career backgrounds, and collectively they work together to further Audubon’s mission and achieve our ambitious conservation goals. Their experiences will help you chart your own path towards a career that helps birds and the places they need.\n\nModerator\n\nRaymond Sessley, Fund II Foundation Apprentice, Campus Chapter Program, National Audubon Society\n\nBirdability: Getting the Mobility-Challenged Outside Birding!\n\nForty-seven years ago, Virginia Rose broke her back in a horsebackriding accident and has used a wheelchair since. About twenty years ago, she began birding and joined Travis Audubon in Austin, Texas. One year ago, Virginia Rose launched Birdability. Her mission: to show others with mobility challenges what birding offers them, the possibilities, the successes, the learning, the joy! Rose has created a three-prong approach to achieve her mission: 1.) Identify mobility-challenged members and accessible birding sites through Audubon Societies nationwide; 2.) Identify and approach the mobility-challenged communities; 3.) Identify and approach the most accessible U.S. birding festivals. The ultimate goal? To create mobility-challenged birding teams in cities across the country. Once established, city teams can host other teams. The Austin birding team invites the Seattle team to bird the accessible Austin sites, and then Seattle reciprocates! Make it happen!\n\nPresenters\n\nVirginia Rose, Board Member, Travis Audubon Society\n\nMelanie Furr, Director of Education, Atlanta Audubon Society\n\nSuccessful Connections: Latino Communities and Bird Conservation\n\nAudubon centers on opposite coasts engage diverse communities and develop genuine collaboration with nontraditional partners.

Applying for any job—constructing an effective résumé, writing an attention-getting cover letter, preparing for an interview—can be complicated and confusing. In this session we will discuss early career opportunities at Audubon, including internships and fellowships. We will guide students and early career professionals through the structure of a résumé, how to convey your experience and passion in a cover letter, and the do’s and don’ts of an interview. Participants will also learn about career opportunities at Audubon and about the Audubon jobs website.\n\nPresenter\n\nGustavo Figueroa, Student Outreach Associate, National Audubon Society\n\nNew Tools for Advancing the Diversity of Boards and Members and Engaging New Audiences\n\nMany chapter leaders think about diversity as one of their most significant challenges. Often, leaders ask, How can we diversify our boards and staff, increase our membership, and engage more volunteers and people in our mission and programs? To support and assist these efforts, Audubon is developing EDI Model Plans—user-friendly, online templates and tools that provide clear guidance in the form of advice, best practices, goals, and strategies. This session will be a demonstration of these new tools and an opportunity to provide input to improve practicality and effectiveness.\n\nPresenters\n\nDeeohn Ferris, Vice President of Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, National Audubon Society\n\nDesiree Loggins, Network Action Manager, National Audubon Society\n\nMaking Your Voice Heard\n\nPeople of color, white women, and other marginalized groups all report that they spend a lot of time and energy trying to make their voices heard. Making sure that your experience and expertise are heard and acknowledged has been described as “taking control of your narrative.” The ability to control your narrative is a learned skill—one that can be learned by those just starting out in conservation, volunteering, the general workforce, and on lobby days. This conversation will explore tactics that you can use to make sure that your voice is heard.\n\nPresenters\n\nMartha Harbison, Network Content Editor, National Audubon Society\n\nNicole Michel, Ph.D., Senior Quantitative Ecologist, National Audubon Society\n\nLisa Hardaway, Vice President, Communications, National Audubon Society\n\nJoanna Wu, GIS Analyst/Biologist, National Audubon Society\n\nMoving Your Members to Action with Effective E-mails and Websites\n\nYour website and e-mails are the public face of your organization.
