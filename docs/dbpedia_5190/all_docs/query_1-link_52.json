ACTION: Final rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service or we) prescribes final late-season frameworks from which States may select season dates, limits, and other options for the 2008-09 migratory bird hunting seasons. These late seasons include most waterfowl seasons, the earliest of which commences on September 27, 2008. The effect of this final rule is to facilitate the States' selection of hunting seasons and to further the annual establishment of the late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. DATES: This rule takes effect on September 25, 2008. ADDRESSES: States should send their season selections to: Chief, Division of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, ms MBSP-4107-ARLSQ, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240. You may inspect comments during normal business hours at our office in room 4107, 4501 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, Virginia. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Blohm, Chief, or Ron W. Kokel, Division of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, (703) 358-1714. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations Schedule for 2008 On May 28, 2008, we published in the Federal Register (73 FR 30712) a proposal to amend 50 CFR part 20. The proposal provided a background and overview of the migratory bird hunting regulations process, and dealt with the establishment of seasons, limits, and other regulations for hunting migratory game birds under Sec. Sec. 20.101 through 20.107, 20.109, and 20.110 of subpart K. Major steps in the 2008-09 regulatory cycle relating to open public meetings and Federal Register notifications were also identified in the May 28 proposed rule. Further, we explained that all sections of subsequent documents outlining hunting frameworks and guidelines were organized under numbered headings. On June 18, 2008, we published in the Federal Register (73 FR 34692) a second document providing supplemental proposals for early- and late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. The June 18 supplement also provided detailed information on the 2008-09 regulatory schedule and announced the SRC and Flyway Council meetings. On June 25 and 26, we held open meetings with the Flyway Council Consultants, at which the participants reviewed information on the current status of migratory shore and upland game birds and developed recommendations for the 2008-09 regulations for these species plus regulations for migratory game birds in Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands; special September waterfowl seasons in designated States; special sea duck seasons in the Atlantic Flyway; and extended falconry seasons. In addition, we reviewed and discussed preliminary information on the status of waterfowl as it relates to the development and selection of the regulatory packages for the 2008-09 regular waterfowl seasons. On July 24, 2008, we published in the Federal Register (73 FR 43290) a third document specifically dealing with the proposed frameworks for early-season regulations. On August 27, 2008, we published in the Federal Register (73 FR 50678) a rulemaking establishing final frameworks for early-season migratory bird hunting regulations for the 2008-09 season. Subsequently, on August 29, 2008, we published a final rule in the Federal Register (73 FR 51088) amending subpart K of title 50 CFR part 20 to set hunting seasons, hours, areas, and limits for early seasons. On July 30-31, 2008, we held open meetings with the Flyway Council Consultants, at which the participants reviewed the status of waterfowl and developed recommendations for the 2008-09 regulations for these species. On August 29, 2008, we published in the Federal Register (73 FR 51124) the proposed frameworks for the 2008-09 late-season migratory bird hunting regulations. This document establishes final frameworks for late-season migratory bird hunting regulations for the 2008-09 season. We will publish State selections in the Federal Register as amendments to Sec. Sec. 20.101 through 20.107, and 20.109 of title 50 CFR part 20. Population Status and Harvest A brief summary of information on the status and harvest of waterfowl excerpted from various reports was included in the August 29 supplemental proposed rule. For more detailed information on methodologies and results, complete copies of the various reports are available at the address indicated under ADDRESSES or from our Web site at http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/reports/reports.html. Review of Public Comments and Flyway Council Recommendations The preliminary proposed rulemaking, which appeared in the May 28, 2008, Federal Register, opened the public comment period for migratory game bird hunting regulations. The supplemental proposed rule, which appeared in the June 18, 2008, Federal Register, discussed the regulatory alternatives for the 2008-09 duck hunting season. Late- season comments are summarized below and numbered in the order used in the May 28 and June 18 Federal Register documents. We have included only the numbered items pertaining to late-season issues for which we received written comments. Consequently, the issues do not follow in direct numerical or alphabetical order. We received recommendations from all four Flyway Councils. Some recommendations supported continuation of last year's frameworks. Due to the comprehensive nature of the annual review of the frameworks performed by the Councils, support for continuation of last year's frameworks is assumed for items for which no recommendations were received. Council recommendations for changes in the frameworks are summarized below. General Written Comments: An individual commenter protested the entire migratory bird hunting regulations process, the killing of all migratory birds, and the Flyway Council process. Service Response: Our long-term objectives continue to include providing opportunities to harvest portions of certain migratory game bird populations and to limit harvests to levels compatible with each population's ability to maintain healthy, viable numbers. Having taken into account the zones of temperature and the distribution, abundance, economic value, breeding habits, and times and lines of flight of migratory birds, we believe that the hunting seasons provided herein are compatible with the current status of migratory bird populations and long-term population goals. Additionally, we are obligated to, and do, give serious consideration to all [[Page 55603]] information received as public comment. While there are problems inherent with any type of representative management of public-trust resources, we believe that the Flyway-Council system of migratory bird management has been a longstanding example of State-Federal cooperative management since its establishment in 1952. However, as always, we continue to seek new ways to streamline and improve the process. 1. Ducks Categories used to discuss issues related to duck harvest management are: (A) Harvest Strategy Considerations, (B) Regulatory Alternatives, (C) Zones and Split Seasons, and (D) Special Seasons/ Species Management. The categories correspond to previously published issues/discussion, and only those containing substantial recommendations are discussed below. A. Harvest Strategy Considerations Council Recommendations: The Atlantic and Pacific Flyway Councils and the Upper- and Lower-Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended the adoption of the ``liberal'' regulatory alternative. The Mississippi Flyway Council opposed the implementation of the western mallard Adaptive Harvest Management (AHM) protocol and recommended the midcontinent mallard AHM protocol should be used for all three western Flyways. The Central Flyway Council also recommended the ``liberal'' alternative. However, as part of their Hunter's Choice experiment, they recommended continuation of the following bag limits: In Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, the daily bag limit would be six ducks, with species and sex restrictions as follows: five mallards (no more than two of which may be females), two redheads, two scaup, two wood ducks, one pintail, one mottled duck, and one canvasback. For pintails and canvasbacks, the season length would be 39 days, which may be split according to applicable zones/split duck hunting configurations approved for each State. In Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming, the daily bag limit would be five ducks, with species and sex restrictions as follows: two scaup, two redheads, and two wood ducks, and only one from the following group--hen mallards, mottled ducks, pintails, canvasbacks. Written Comments: The Wisconsin Conservation Congress and the Wisconsin Waterfowl Association opposed the removal of the Alaskan mallards from the mid-continent mallard stock. Service Response: As we stated in the August 29 proposed rule, we are continuing development of an AHM protocol that would allow hunting regulations to vary among Flyways in a manner that recognizes each Flyway's unique breeding-ground derivation of mallards. In the July 24 Federal Register, we described and adopted a protocol for regulatory decision-making for the newly defined stock of western mallards. For the 2008 hunting season, we believe that the prescribed regulatory choice for the Pacific Flyway should be based on the status of this western mallard breeding stock, while the regulatory choice for the Mississippi and Central Flyways should depend on the status of the recently redefined mid-continent mallard stock. In defining the western breeding stock, based on available data, mallards breeding in Alaska were disassociated with the mid-continent mallard stock and reassigned to the western stock. We also recommend that the regulatory choice for the Atlantic Flyway continue to depend on the status of eastern mallards. For the 2008 hunting season, we considered the same regulatory alternatives as those used last year. The nature of the restrictive, moderate, and liberal alternatives has remained essentially unchanged since 1997, except that extended framework dates have been offered in the moderate and liberal regulatory alternatives since 2002. Also, in 2003, we agreed to place a constraint on closed seasons in the western three Flyways whenever the midcontinent mallard breeding-population size (as defined prior to 2008; traditional survey area plus Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin) was >=5.5 million. As we described in the July 24 Federal Register, redefinition of the midcontinent mallard stock through the removal of Alaska necessitated that both the population constraint (North American Waterfowl Management Plan goal plus Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin) and the closed season constraint in the midcontinent mallard objective function be rescaled to 8.5 million and 4.75 million, respectively, in order to appropriately reflect the change in stock definition and to achieve performance of the mid- continent mallard strategy that is comparable to performance prior to the stock redefinition. Optimal AHM strategies for the 2008 hunting season were calculated using: (1) Harvest-management objectives specific to each mallard stock; (2) the 2008 regulatory alternatives; and (3) current population models and associated weights for midcontinent, western, and eastern mallards. Based on this year's survey results of 7.87 million midcontinent mallards (traditional survey area minus Alaska plus Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan), 3.06 million ponds in Prairie Canada, 913.8 thousand western mallards (381.1 and 532.4 thousand, respectively, in California-Oregon and Alaska), and 815 thousand eastern mallards, the prescribed regulatory choice for all four Flyways is the liberal alternative. Therefore, we concur with the recommendations of the Atlantic, Mississippi, Central, and Pacific Flyway Councils regarding selection of the ``liberal'' regulatory alternative and will adopt the ``liberal'' regulatory alternative, as described in the June 18 Federal Register. Regarding Hunter's Choice, we support continuation of the Central Flyway Council's recommendation for a 3-year evaluation of the Central Flyway's Hunter's Choice duck bag limit. The Central Flyway's Hunter's Choice regulations are intended to limit harvest on pintails and canvasbacks in a manner similar to the season-within-a-season regulations. Hunter's Choice regulations should also reduce harvests of mottled ducks and hen mallards, while maintaining full hunting opportunity on abundant species such as drake mallards. For the species included in the aggregate bag limit, the harvest of one species is intended to ``buffer'' the harvest of the others, thus reducing the harvest of all species included in the one-bird category. The Central Flyway has accumulated 4 years of baseline information on harvests resulting from ``season-within-a-season'' regulations in the Central Flyway; the season length for pintails and canvasbacks in season- within-a-season States under the ``liberal'' alternative will be 39 days. Five States (Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming) were randomly assigned to Hunter's Choice regulations and the remaining five States (Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Oklahoma) serve as controls (season-within-a-season regulations) as the evaluation proceeds. The overall duck daily bag limit is reduced from six to five for the Hunter's Choice States. While we continue to support the Central Flyway's Hunter's Choice experiment, we reiterate that we believe implementation of this experiment should not preclude any future changes in hunting regulations that may be deemed necessary on an annual basis for any other duck species in the Central [[Page 55604]] Flyway, if such changes are deemed necessary. Regarding the Mississippi Flyway Council's opposition to the western mallard AHM protocol, we have cooperated with the Pacific Flyway during the past several years to develop a protocol for managing the harvest of the western stock of mallards. As we discussed above, in July 2008, we formally adopted the western mallard protocol (73 FR 43290). This decision resulted in Alaska mallards being removed from the midcontinent mallard stock and placing them in the western mallard stock. This change resulted in a 70 percent increase (10 to 17 percent) in the frequency of closed seasons in the Central and Mississippi Flyways under the midcontinent mallard AHM protocol. As we also discussed above, to address this concern, we modified the closed season constraint for midcontinent mallards from 5.25 to 4.75 million mallards. This change is also consistent with changes in mallard breeding populations in Alaska over the past 2 decades, and therefore, expresses the closed season constraint in terms of more contemporary mallard breeding distributions. We recognize the concerns expressed by the Mississippi Flyway Council with regard to implementation of the western mallard protocol. However, we believe that establishment of a western mallard protocol is justified, and we have made an appropriate adjustment to the midcontinent mallard protocol to reduce the impact of removing Alaska from that stock of birds. With regard to potential impacts of higher frequency of liberal seasons in the Pacific Flyway on midcontinent mallards, a preliminary joint optimization of western and midcontinent mallards was assessed. The preliminary analysis suggested that joint optimization does not result in a significant difference in the performance of either protocol. Therefore, we believe an independent harvest strategy for western mallards poses little risk to the midcontinent stock. With regard to the potential impacts of near- permanent liberal regulations in the Pacific Flyway on other species of waterfowl, it is presently unclear how such impacts would be assessed. However, we are committed to monitoring of these potential impacts and will discuss any findings with all of the Flyway Councils prior to implementing any appropriate regulatory changes to address such impacts. B. Regulatory Alternatives Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended that the Service propose a process and time line by June 2009 for review and modification of the regulatory alternatives for implementation by the 2011 season. Service Response: We plan to address this issue within the context of the new Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) for the migratory bird hunting program (see NEPA Consideration for further discussion) and anticipate the issuance of the draft SEIS by the date desired by the Atlantic Flyway Council. D. Special Seasons/Species Management iii. Black Ducks Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended that black duck harvest regulations remain unchanged for the 2008-09 season. Service Response: In the July 24 Federal Register we described the black duck interim harvest strategy developed by U.S. and Canadian waterfowl managers that will be employed by both countries to make regulatory decisions over the next three seasons (2008-09 to 2010-11), allowing time for the development of a formal strategy based on the principles of AHM. The interim harvest strategy is prescriptive, in that it calls for no substantive changes in hunting regulations unless the black duck breeding population, averaged over the most recent 3 years, exceeds or falls below the long-term average breeding population by 15 percent or more. The strategy is designed to share the black duck harvest equally between the two countries; however, recognizing incomplete control of harvest through regulations, it will allow realized harvest in either country to vary between 40 and 60 percent. The 2008 composite estimate (based on hierarchical modeling and both Service and Canadian Wildlife Service survey data) for the Eastern Survey Area is 683,400. The 1998-2007 mean estimate is 713,800 and the most recent 3-year running mean estimate is 721,6000. Based on these estimates, we agree with the Atlantic Flyway Council that no restriction or liberalization of harvest is warranted. iv. Canvasbacks Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended a full season for canvasbacks consisting of a 1-bird daily bag limit and a 60-day season in the Atlantic Flyway. The Upper- and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council reiterated their recommended alternative canvasback harvest management strategy that uses threshold levels based on breeding population size in order to determine bag limits (detailed in the June 18 Federal Register). Using their strategy would result in a 1-bird daily bag limit and a 60-day season in the Mississippi Flyway. The Central Flyway Council, as part of their Hunter's Choice experiment, recommended a full season (74 days) for canvasbacks with a 1-bird daily bag limit in Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming and a 39-day season with a 1-bird daily bag limit in Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended a closed season for canvasbacks. Written Comments: The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (Minnesota) and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (Wisconsin) expressed concern over our proposal to close the canvasback season. Minnesota believed that basing this decision solely on the results of the current model was inappropriate. They urged us to consider the Mississippi Flyway Council's recommendation. Wisconsin also supported the Mississippi Flyway Council's recommendation and suggested that our 2008 breeding population estimate was likely to be low. The Wisconsin Waterfowl Association stated that we had arbitrarily closed the canvasback season and that our survey figures were unacceptable and unbelievable. Similarly, the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation and the Wisconsin Conservation Congress also expressed frustration with the proposed canvasback closure and supported the Mississippi Flyway Council's recommendation for an open season using threshold levels based on breeding population size in order to determine bag limits. One individual expressed skepticism in the accuracy of the canvasback harvest strategy and population estimate. Service Response: Since 1994, we have followed a canvasback harvest strategy that if canvasback population status and production are sufficient to permit a harvest of one canvasback per day nationwide for the entire length of the regular duck season, while still attaining a projected spring population objective of 500,000 birds, the season on canvasbacks should be opened. A partial season would be permitted if the estimated allowable harvest was within the projected harvest for a shortened season. If neither of these conditions [[Page 55605]] can be met, the harvest strategy calls for a closed season on canvasbacks nationwide. In the July 24 Federal Register we announced our decision to modify the Canvasback Harvest Strategy to incorporate the option for a 2-bird daily bag limit for canvasbacks when the predicted breeding population the subsequent year exceeds 725,000 birds. This year's spring survey resulted in an estimate of 489,000 canvasbacks. This was 44 percent below the 2007 estimate of 865,000 canvasbacks and 14 percent below the 1955-2007 average. The estimate of ponds in Prairie Canada was 3.06 million, which was 39 percent below last year and 11 percent below the long-term average. According to the Canvasback Harvest Strategy, the allowable harvest in the conterminous United States is 24,700 birds, which is less than the expected harvest in the United States for all four flyways under their respective restrictive season lengths (61,758 birds). Thus, the Canvasback Harvest Strategy stipulates a canvasback season closure for the upcoming season. Last year, the estimate of canvasback abundance was a record-high of 865,000 birds. In response to Flyway requests for additional harvest opportunities due to that estimate, we increased the daily bag limit to 2 birds per day. As expected, the harvest of canvasbacks increased last year, but not to the extent that could explain the large decrease in the estimate of canvasback abundance this spring. We have conducted a comprehensive review of canvasback survey information, with a particular focus on the change in estimates between 2007 and 2008. Investigations into the estimation procedures for canvasbacks revealed that numbers of canvasbacks observed during the May survey increased across many survey areas last year, but counts were consistently lower in those same areas this spring. We found no anomalies in the data, leading us to conclude with confidence that the estimate this year is as reliable as previous estimates. Annual canvasback estimates typically have higher variances than for most other species counted during May, and large changes from year-to-year have happened historically. It is possible that the discrepancy between this year's estimate and last year's record-high estimate are purely the result of sampling variation, but other factors may have contributed. However, we support the completion of the Hunter's Choice experiment in the Central Flyway. For the last 2 years, the average harvest of canvasbacks in the U.S. portion of the Central Flyway has been about 14,800 birds. This, together with the average expected harvest in Alaska (350 birds), is below the allowable U.S. harvest resulting from the strategy this year. Thus, we will allow the States in the Central Flyway an open season on canvasbacks this year according to the Hunter's Choice experimental design, but the seasons on canvasbacks would be closed in the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Pacific Flyways. v. Pintails Council Recommendations: The Atlantic and Pacific Flyway Councils and the Upper- and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended a full season for pintails consisting of a 1-bird daily bag limit and a 60-day season in the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways, and a 107-day season in the Pacific Flyway. The Central Flyway Council, as part of their Hunter's Choice experiment, recommended a full season (74 days) for pintails with a 1- bird daily bag limit in Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming and a 39-day season with a 1-bird daily bag limit in Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Service Response: Based on the current strategy, along with an observed spring breeding population of 2.61 million, an overflight- bias-corrected breeding population of 4.24 million and a projected fall flight of 4.47 million pintails, the Pintail Harvest Strategy prescribes a full season and a 1-bird bag in all Flyways. Under the ``liberal'' season length, this regulation is expected to result in a harvest of 569,000 pintails and an observed breeding population estimate of 3.53 million in 2009, not considering any potential effect from continuation of the Hunter's Choice evaluation in the Central Flyway. Furthermore, we agree with the Central Flyway Council's recommendation to adopt a 39-day ``season-within-a-season'' for pintails in Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. We understand that this departure from the pintail strategy is a necessary part of the experimental ``Hunter's Choice'' season. vi. Scaup Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended that the following regulatory packages for scaup be allowed for the Atlantic Flyway for the next 3 years and that we use their harvest prediction methodology to predict scaup harvests in the Atlantic Flyway: (1) Under the restrictive harvest policy, a 40-day season with a 1- bird daily bag and a 20-day season with a 2-bird daily bag. The 20 days with the 2 bird daily bag shall be 20 consecutive hunting days; (2) Under the moderate harvest policy, a 60-day season with a 2- bird daily bag; and (3) Under the liberal harvest policy, a 60-day season with a 4-bird daily bag. For 2008-09, the Council recommended implementation of the restrictive season package, based on results of the scaup harvest model. The Upper- and Lower Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended a 60-day season with a 2-bird daily bag limit for the 2008-09 season. They further recommended a restrictive and moderate regulatory package of 60 days with a 2-bird daily bag limit and a liberal regulatory package of 60 days with a 4-bird daily bag limit. The Central Flyway Council recommended the continuation of the Hunter's Choice bag limit for the 2008-09 season. After completion of the Hunter's Choice experiment, the Central Flyway Council recommends the following potential scaup regulatory alternatives (season lengths and daily bag limits) for Central Flyway States: (1) Restrictive Policy--74 days with a 1-bird daily bag limit; (2) Moderate Policy--74 days with a 2-bird daily bag limit; and (3) Liberal Policy--74 days with a 6-bird daily bag limit. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended the adoption of the following scaup regulation packages for the Pacific Flyway for the next 3 years: (1) Restrictive season package: 86 days, 2 bag limit. (2) Moderate season package: 86 days, 3 bag limit. (3) Liberal season package: 107 days, 7 bag limit. In addition, the Pacific Flyway Council requested that split and zone configurations be available to individual States for scaup seasons, similar to the split and zone options we previously provided for pintail seasons. For 2008-09, the Council recommended implementation of the restrictive season package, based on results of the scaup harvest model. Written Comments: The Mississippi Flyway Council requested consideration of an alternative restrictive regulatory option for the 2008-09 season. The Council proposed a 45-day season with a 2-bird daily bag and a 15-day season with a 1-bird daily bag. Under their regulatory option, the Council estimates that the harvest would be 84,000 scaup, [[Page 55606]] a level similar to the Service's target harvest level of 83,000 scaup for the Mississippi Flyway. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (Minnesota) and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (Wisconsin) both expressed concern over implementation of the proposed scaup harvest strategy and requested the Service reconsider its proposal. Minnesota recognized the declines in the scaup population but believed that reduction in harvest are not likely to lead to future breeding population increases. They further question the use of the scaup harvest strategy and support the Mississippi Flyway Council's recommendation. Wisconsin also supported efforts to reverse the long-term decline in scaup populations but believed that harvest is not the driving factor. They believe the Service's proposal is unreasonably restrictive. The Wisconsin Waterfowl Association expressed support for the Mississippi Flyway Council's recommendation of a 45-day season with a 2-bird daily bag and a 15-day season with a 1-bird daily bag. The Wisconsin Conservation Congress supported a 60-day season with a 2-bird daily bag limit. Delta Waterfowl Foundation recommended delaying implementation of the scaup harvest strategy until the Service could fully consider the recommendations of the scaup harvest strategy review panel (see July 24 Federal Register). They remain deeply opposed to both the process in and the implementation of the scaup harvest strategy. The Oneida Lake Association opposed proposals for scaup harvest reductions and urged the Service to develop an improved harvest model supported by all stakeholders. Twelve individuals expressed displeasure with the proposed implementation of the scaup harvest strategy. They raised various concerns related to the potential impacts of the strategy on diving duck hunters and the validity of the scaup harvest model. Most did not believe that harvest reductions were warranted this season. Several other individuals expressed support for our proposal. Service Response: As we have stated over the last several years, the continental scaup (greater Aythya marila and lesser Aythya affinis combined) population has experienced a long-term decline over the past 20 years. Over the past several years in particular, we have continued to express our growing concern about the status of scaup (see the May 28 Federal Register for a review of the actions we have taken over the last few years to synthesize data relevant to scaup harvest management and frame a scientifically-sound scaup harvest strategy or for a complete list of reports see http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/reports/reports.html). In the July 24 Federal Register, we adopted a scaup harvest strategy that resulted from 5 years of development and review in cooperation with the Flyway Councils. The 2008 scaup breeding population estimate was 3.74 million. Total estimated scaup harvest in 2007-08 was 295,000. Employing these estimates as the input to the scaup harvest strategy, the optimal harvest for the 2008-09 hunting season is 200,000 (including the 40,000 scaup harvest expected in Canada and Alaska). The available harvest results in a recommendation for a restrictive package in all four Flyways (except Alaska). We appreciate the time and attention that the Flyways have given this issue. We further support the recommendations received from the Atlantic, Central and Pacific Flyways for their restrictive, moderate and liberal packages for scaup. We also support the packages recommended by the Mississippi Flyway for their moderate and liberal packages. However, the restrictive package originally recommended by the Mississippi Flyway (see Council Recommendations above) is not projected to be sufficient to achieve the required harvest reductions. In further consultation with the Mississippi Flyway Consultants at the July SRC meeting, we accepted the same season structure recommended by the Atlantic Flyway for restrictive seasons in the Mississippi Flyway that is expected to result in a harvest that is within the allowable allocation for the Mississippi Flyway (as a portion of the 200,000 indicated above). In addition, we have adopted the alternative harvest prediction models suggested by the Atlantic, Central, and Pacific Flyway Councils (see July 24 Federal Register for additional discussion). We also support the proposal by the Pacific Flyway to afford States the opportunity to use their existing zone/split rules for their respective States when choosing scaup season frameworks. Regarding the new recommendation from the Mississippi Flyway Council in response to our August 29 proposed rule (see Written Comments above), as we stated above, we continue to support the recommendations for scaup season structures of the Atlantic, Central and Pacific Flyway Councils, but do not support the new recommendation offered by the Mississippi Flyway Council. Alternatively, we proposed in the August 29 Federal Register a scaup season structure for the Mississippi Flyway that met the established guidelines. While we appreciate the additional comments from the States of Minnesota and Wisconsin, and the Mississippi Flyway Council offering an alternative season structure to both their original recommendation and the season structure we proposed, this new proposal does not conform to the guidelines. Thus, we do not support the recommendation. We reaffirm our support for employing the general scaup harvest strategy adopted this year and for continuing efforts to improve and refine this strategy. However, in consideration of the concerns expressed by the Mississippi Flyway Council and the two member States, we will continue to work with all four Flyway Councils to re-examine the guidelines for structuring scaup seasons during the next regulatory cycle. For the coming season, we will adopt scaup season structures as initially proposed. vii. Mottled Ducks Council Recommendations: The Upper- and Lower Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended continuation of a 60-day season and a 3-bird daily bag limit for mottled ducks for the 2008-09 waterfowl season. They further recommended that given adequate justification for a 30 percent reduction in harvest, and no further analyses of effects of harvest regulations on mottled duck harvests sometime in the future, the following: (a) Season length of 45 days with a daily bag limit of 1 per day in years when AHM prescribes a liberal or moderate regulations package. (b) Season length of 30 days with a daily bag limit of 2 per day in years when AHM prescribes a restrictive regulations package. (c) Outside the mottled duck breeding range, mottled duck season length and bag limits would be the same as for hen mallards. The Central Flyway Council recommended that no further harvest reductions were warranted at this time. Service Response: We did not propose any changes to mottled duck regulations for the 2008-09 season. Because of our long-standing concern about the status of mottled ducks, we are encouraged by the progress made to date on improving population monitoring programs for this species in the Gulf Coast region. We look forward to working with the Flyways on continued development of such surveys. Further, we appreciate the [[Page 55607]] Mississippi Flyway Council's recommendations on potential regulatory packages that could serve to reduce harvest pressure on mottled ducks if deemed necessary at some future date. We will take under consideration the Council's recommendation regarding regulations in areas outside the mottled duck breeding range. We also recognize that the Central Flyway Council has taken voluntary restrictions in mottled duck regulations in the past and, together with reductions in harvest resulting from the Hunter's Choice experiment, have reduced harvest pressure on mottled ducks, primarily in Texas. viii. Wood Ducks Council Recommendations: The Atlantic and Central Flyway Councils and the Upper- and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended that the wood duck bag limit in the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Central Flyways be increased to 3 birds per day during the regular duck season for an experimental 3-year period beginning in 2008. Service Response: We support the proposal to increase the daily bag limit for wood ducks from 2 to 3 birds in the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Central Flyways beginning in 2008. We do not, however, believe that this change warrants an experiment because the assessment work that justifies the bag limit increase has already been done. However, we recognize the importance of maintaining the current wood duck banding effort that is needed to assess the effects of the change. Further, we look forward to continuing involvement by the Flyways in developing a wood duck harvest strategy, including (1) determining specific harvest management objectives; (2) determining regulatory alternatives; (3) designation of and support for appropriate population monitoring programs; and (4) designation of the appropriate test criteria for making management decisions. We would like the Flyways to develop this strategy for implementation during the 2010-2011 hunting season. viii. Youth Hunt Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommended that the Service allow States to select any 2 weekend days, holidays or other non-school days for their youth waterfowl hunting days. Service Response: We do not support the Atlantic Flyway's proposal to allow the selection of any 2 weekend days, holidays, or other non- school days for their youth waterfowl hunting days. In 2000, we expanded the special youth waterfowl hunt to 2 consecutive days in order to reduce travel and scheduling conflicts for youth hunt participants--issues identified by the Flyways as problems with promoting participation under the original 1-day youth hunt guidelines (65 FR 51496). The following year, we further supported a change to 2 consecutive hunting days to address the inability of some States in the Atlantic Flyway to hunt on Sundays (66 FR 44010). As we stated in 2003 when presented with a similar proposal by the Atlantic Flyway, we believe the proposal is inconsistent with the original purpose put forth by the Flyway Councils in 2000 to facilitate travel and scheduling of youth hunt participants (68 FR 51658). 4. Canada Geese B. Regular Seasons Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council forwarded a number of recommendations concerning Canada geese. First, the Council recommended that we modify the existing criteria for delineation of Atlantic Flyway Resident Population (AFRP) Canada goose hunting zones in the Atlantic Flyway by proposing that AFRP hunting zones may not contain more than 10 percent of all Atlantic Population (AP) band recoveries, or more than 10 percent of all North Atlantic Population (NAP) recoveries, within a State from 2002-2007. Second, the Council recommended that we adopt the following criteria for evaluation of AFRP hunting zones in the Atlantic Flyway during 2008-2010: (1) All areas holding an AFRP regular season must collectively account for no more than a 1 percent direct recovery rate for adults for any migrant goose population during the open AFRP regular seasons. Areas contributing disproportionately to the cumulative recovery rate will be identified and these areas may be eliminated to stay below the 1 percent threshold; (2) AFRP hunting zones must not account for more than 10 percent of all AP band recoveries, or more than 10 percent of all NAP recoveries, in any State during the 3-year period 2008-2010; (3) If a season is closed for any migrant population, AFRP hunting zones would remain open as long as they do not result in exceeding the cumulative 1 percent adult recovery rate threshold; and (4) Band recovery data will be examined annually, and at 3-year intervals all available data will be examined to determine if zone modifications and/or changes to opening and closing framework dates are needed to ensure continued compliance with the above criteria. As a result of the above delineation criteria modifications, the Council recommended modifications to existing AFRP hunting zones in New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland beginning in 2008, and that we extend the opening and closing framework dates for Canada geese in AFRP harvest zones in Pennsylvania (from the fourth Saturday in October to March 10), Maryland and Virginia (from November 15 to March 10), and North Carolina (from October 1 to March 10). They also recommended allowing Connecticut and New York to establish new AFRP harvest zones with framework dates between 1 October and 15 February and bag limits of 5 geese per day. With regard to frameworks in Southern James Bay Population (SJBP) harvest zones, the Council recommended allowing Pennsylvania a 70-day Canada goose hunting season, with a 3-bird daily bag limit, between the second Saturday in October and February 15; Virginia, a 40-day season between November 15 and January 14 with a 3-bird daily bag limit and an experimental season between January 15-February 15 with a 5-bird daily bag limit; and North Carolina a 70-day season with a 5-bird daily bag limit between October 1 and December 31. In addition, they recommended modifying the SJBP harvest zone in Pennsylvania to include the former Pymatuning Zone and that portion of Mercer, Crawford and Erie Counties north of Interstate 80 and west of Interstate 79 including Lake Erie, Presque Isle, and the area within 150 yards of the Lake Erie shoreline. The Upper- and Lower-Region Regulations Committees of the Mississippi Flyway Council recommended a number of changes in Canada goose zones, seasons lengths, and bag limits for several States in the Flyway. These changes are a result of approved revisions to the Southern James Bay Population (SJBP) Canada goose harvest strategy and management plan that were made in agreement with the Atlantic Flyway. These changes are consistent with the revised harvest strategies for Canada geese in the Mississippi Flyway. The Pacific Flyway Council recommended revising Idaho zone designations for 2 counties (Adams and Valley Counties from Zone 2 to Zone 1), and reducing the bag limit on dark geese in Wyoming from 4 to 3 geese. Written Comments: The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries requested a change in the zone [[Page 55608]] boundary between the AP and SJBP Canada goose hunting zones based on concerns from farmers that large numbers of Canada geese are depredating crops. They requested the zone boundary between the two populations be moved further east to allow more liberal regulations (i.e., longer season or larger bag limit) in the area of concern. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries requested removal of the requirement to issue a permit for Canada goose hunting. They stated that recent changes to their licensing structure effectively meet this requirement. The Virginia Farm Bureau supported the request to move the zone boundary between the AP and SJBP Canada goose hunting zones. They further supported extending the season into February and March to address depredation concerns and expanding the daily bag limit for AP geese from 2 to 3 per day. Service Response: We concur with the Atlantic Flyway Council's recommendations to modify existing criteria for delineation and subsequent evaluation of AFRP hunting zones. Evaluations of AFRP seasons since 2002 have demonstrated that these seasons have met the established criteria of less than a 1 percent direct recovery rate of migrant geese. We note that a migrant (AP, NAP, SJBP) direct recovery rate of 0.35 percent was realized for the 2005-2007 period. AFRP zones have resulted in higher hunter opportunity and higher AFRP goose harvests, and current North Atlantic Population Canada Goose Low Harvest zones have shown to be effective in minimizing NAP harvest. The Atlantic Flyway Council's proposed modification to allow certain portions of existing NAP Harvest zones to become AFRP zones will allow for greater harvest opportunity on AFRP geese while further protecting NAP stocks. Current direct recovery rates of NAP geese in the United States are 2.9 percent, equating to a harvest rate of < 6 percent. As band return data accumulate, adjustments to existing AFRP zones and establishment of new zones should utilize these data. We will continue to evaluate these AFRP seasons annually through leg band recoveries and at 3-year intervals a comprehensive evaluation of all available data will occur to ensure compliance with established criteria. Lastly, we note that these proposed modifications for delineation of new AFRP zones in certain portions of existing NAP harvest zones are in accordance with the current North Atlantic Population Canada Goose Management Plan. We also concur with the Atlantic Flyway Council's recommendations to modify AFRP hunting zones in Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania, establish new AFRP zones in Connecticut and Long Island, New York, and modify the AFRP zone season opening and closing framework dates in Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. These recommended changes all conform to the existing criteria, as amended above, for delineating AFRP hunting zones and establishing AFRP season framework dates. We further note that resident Canada geese are overabundant in many areas of the Atlantic Flyway and currently number approximately 1.0 million birds, significantly above the goal in the Atlantic Flyway Resident Canada Goose Management Plan of 650,000 geese. All of the Flyway's objectives to increase the harvest of resident Canada geese are consistent with those identified in the Service's 2005 Final Environmental Impact Statement on Resident Canada Goose Management (70 FR 69985, November 18, 2005). We also concur with the Atlantic Flyway Council's recommended frameworks for the SJBP harvest zones in the Atlantic Flyway. We note that the SJBP Management Plan was recently revised and approved by both the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyway Councils and guides management decisions in both flyways. The plan goal is to maintain the SJBP at a level that can sustain use throughout its current range, while allowing for the management of resident Canada geese. A key part of the plan is a harvest strategy designed to test the resident Canada goose buffering hypothesis. This hypothesis states that large populations of resident Canada geese are now buffering the harvest of SJBP geese, and therefore liberalization in hunting regulations will result in more harvest of resident Canada geese, and not SJBP Canada geese. Further, genetic studies and analysis of band recoveries indicate SJBP harvest zones in many States no longer function as concentration zones for SJBP geese and may therefore be ineffective at protecting SJBP geese. We agree that these reductions in hunting opportunity and hunting pressure on resident Canada geese may not be warranted when many SJBP harvest zones hold a smaller proportion of SJBP geese than they did historically. The newly revised SJBP plan also calls for holding regulations stable for a 5-year period (2008-2013). If the spring population estimate falls below 50,000 in combination with either an unabated negative trend in the estimate over 3 years or more, and evidence of unsustainable harvest rates, then appropriate regulation changes will be implemented as/when necessary in both the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways. We believe that these proposed regulation changes will provide for increased hunting opportunity and harvest of AFRP geese, while maintaining the SJBP at levels identified in the 2008 plan. We do not agree with the requests from the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries and the Virginia Farm Bureau for moving the zone boundary between the AP and SJBP Canada goose hunting zones. We have no biological information to warrant such a change, and a request of this nature should be brought through the Atlantic Flyway Council. We also do not support the request to increase the daily bag limit of AP geese in Virginia. The Atlantic Flyway Council considered the status of the AP Canada goose population and concluded that no liberalization of hunting regulations was warranted for that population, and we concur with their conclusion. Regarding the request from the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries to remove the requirement for a permit to hunt Canada geese, we concur. As they stated in their comment, recent changes to their licensing structure effectively meet this requirement. We also concur with all of the recommendations forwarded by the Pacific Flyway Council. Some of these changes are designed to afford greater protection to Tule white-fronted geese and the Service strongly supports these efforts (see discussion under 5. White-fronted Geese). In addition, the other changes in Canada goose seasons are relatively minor and are being undertaken for administrative reasons and are not expected to impact populations. 5. White-Fronted Geese Council Recommendations: The Pacific Flyway Council recommended the following area, bag, and season length changes described below: (1) In the Lake County portion of the Harney, Lake, and Malheur County Zone reduce the daily bag limit for white-fronted geese from 2 to 1; (2) In the Klamath County Zone of Oregon, for hunting days occurring after the last Sunday in January, change the daily bag limit of 2 white-fronted geese to a bag limit of 1 white-fronted goose and 3 white geese; (3) Reduce the bag limit on dark geese in Wyoming from 4 to 3 geese. [[Page 55609]] Service Response: We concur with the proposed changes in goose frameworks proposed by the Pacific Flyway Council. In general, these changes are designed to afford greater protection to Tule white-fronted geese and we strongly support these efforts. Tule greater white-fronted geese continue to be of concern because of low population numbers. In Oregon, Tule white-fronted geese are predominantly encountered in Lake County where the bag limit for white-fronted geese has been two for some time. Because of the continued concern for Tule geese, and uncertainty about their true population size, we agree with the Pacific Flyway Council that a reduction in harvest is warranted. This change will keep Tule goose harvest in Oregon at minimum levels and support ongoing research efforts to assess population status. We note, however, that indices to the Pacific population of white- fronted geese exceed management plan goals and this population is responsible for numerous agricultural depredation complaints in the Klamath Basin as well. However, given the concerns over the status of population of Tule white-fronted geese, which, as documented through telemetry observations, are present in at least very low numbers in the Oregon portion of the Klamath Basin during this time period, further assessment is warranted. 6. Brant Council Recommendations: The Atlantic Flyway Council recommends a 60-day season with a 3-bird daily bag limit for Atlantic brant. Service Response: We concur with the Atlantic Flyway Council's recommendation. The 2008 Mid-Winter Index (MWI) for Atlantic brant was 160,618 brant. The Brant Management Plan prescribes a 60-day season with a 3-bird daily bag limit when the MWI estimate is above 150,000 and productivity and food supplies are deemed sufficient to sustain additional harvest opportunity. We note that productivity for 2008 looks very good on the main breeding grounds and that productivity in 2007 was good, with approximately 28-31 percent young in the fall productivity surveys. Thus, we agree with the Council that an increase of 10 days with the associated daily bag limit increase is the proper approach for the upcoming season. 7. Snow and Ross's (Light) Geese Council Recommendations: The Pacific Flyway Council recommended several area, bag, and season length changes for light geese: (1) In the States of California, Oregon, and Washington, increase the light goose season length to 107 days, and in the States of California and Oregon, increase the bag limit to 6 light geese per day and extend the light goose framework ending date to March 10; in Washington, the light goose bag limit remains at 4; (2) Increase the bag limit to 10 light geese per day in all other States of the Pacific Flyway with a framework ending date of March 10; and (3) In the Klamath County Zone of Oregon, for hunting days occurring after the last Sunday in January, change the daily bag limit of 2 white-fronted geese to a bag limit of 1 white-fronted goose and 3 white geese. Service Response: We support the proposed changes for light geese in the Pacific Flyway. Last year the Flyway's December goose count exceeded 1 million for the first time, representing a doubling of this index since 1999. Light goose indices (Snow and Ross' geese combined) indicate that all recognized populations currently exceed management plan goals. In some areas of the Pacific Flyway, these goose populations are leading to increasing depredation complaints. In addition, numbers of light geese breeding on Wrangle Island, Russia, a colony that has been of concern in the past, has recovered to near record levels in the past few years. We support efforts to increase harvest of these geese in aid of limiting further population growth and perhaps avoiding the overabundance problems associated with the species that have been documented in the mid-continent region. NEPA Consideration NEPA considerations are covered by the programmatic document ``Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FSES 88- 14),'' filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on June 9, 1988. We published a notice of availability in the Federal Register on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582). We published our Record of Decision on August 18, 1988 (53 FR 31341). In addition, an August 1985 environmental assessment entitled ``Guidelines for Migratory Bird Hunting Regulations on Federal Indian Reservations and Ceded Lands'' is available from the address indicated under the caption ADDRESSES. In a notice published in the September 8, 2005, Federal Register (70 FR 53376), we announced our intent to develop a new Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the migratory bird hunting program. Public scoping meetings were held in the spring of 2006, as detailed in a March 9, 2006, Federal Register (71 FR 12216). We have prepared a scoping report summarizing the scoping comments and scoping meetings. The report is available by either writing to the address indicated under ADDRESSES or by viewing on our Web site at http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds. Endangered Species Act Consideration Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543; 87 Stat. 884), provides that, ``The Secretary shall review other programs administered by him and utilize such programs in furtherance of the purposes of this Act'' (and) shall ``insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out * * * is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of [critical] habitat * * *.'' Consequently, we conducted formal consultations to ensure that actions resulting from these regulations would not likely jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of their critical habitat. Findings from these consultations are included in a biological opinion, which concluded that the regulations are not likely to adversely affect any endangered or threatened species. Additionally, these findings may have caused modification of some regulatory measures previously proposed, and the final frameworks reflect any such modifications. Our biological opinions resulting from this section 7 consultation are public documents available for public inspection at the address indicated under ADDRESSES. Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has determined that this rule is significant and has reviewed this rule under Executive Order 12866. OMB bases its determination upon the following four criteria: (a) Whether the rule will have an annual effect of $100 million or more on the economy or adversely affect an economic sector, productivity, jobs, the environment, or other units of the government. (b) Whether the rule will create inconsistencies with other Federal agencies' actions. (c) Whether the rule will materially affect entitlements, grants, user fees, loan programs, or the rights and obligations of their recipients. [[Page 55610]] (d) Whether the rule raises novel legal or policy issues. Regulatory Flexibility Act The regulations have a significant economic impact on substantial numbers of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). We analyzed the economic impacts of the annual hunting regulations on small business entities in detail as part of the 1981 cost-benefit analysis. This analysis was revised annually from 1990-95. In 1995, the Service issued a Small Entity Flexibility Analysis (Analysis), which was subsequently updated in 1996, 1998, 2004, and 2008. The primary source of information about hunter expenditures for migratory game bird hunting is the National Hunting and Fishing Survey, which is conducted at 5-year intervals. The 2008 Analysis was based on the 2006 National Hunting and Fishing Survey and the U.S. Department of Commerce's County Business Patterns, from which it was estimated that migratory bird hunters would spend approximately $1.2 billion at small businesses in 2008. Copies of the Analysis are available upon request from the address indicated under ADDRESSES or from our Web site at http://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/reports/reports.html or at http://www.regulations.gov. Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act This rule is a major rule under 5 U.S.C. 804(2), the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. For the reasons outlined above, this rule has an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. However, because this rule establishes hunting seasons, we do not plan to defer the effective date under the exemption contained in 5 U.S.C. 808(1). Paperwork Reduction Act We examined these regulations under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The various recordkeeping and reporting requirements imposed under regulations established in 50 CFR part 20, Subpart K, are utilized in the formulation of migratory game bird hunting regulations. Specifically, OMB has approved the information collection requirements of our Migratory Bird Surveys and assigned control number 1018-0023 (expires 2/28/2011). This information is used to provide a sampling frame for voluntary national surveys to improve our harvest estimates for all migratory game birds in order to better manage these populations. A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act We have determined and certify, in compliance with the requirements of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, 2 U.S.C. 1502 et seq., that this rulemaking will not impose a cost of $100 million or more in any given year on local or State government or private entities. Therefore, this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. Civil Justice Reform--Executive Order 12988 In promulgating this rule, we have determined that it will not unduly burden the judicial system and that it meets the requirements of sections 3(a) and 3(b)(2) of Executive Order 12988. Takings Implication Assessment In accordance with Executive Order 12630, this rule, authorized by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, does not have significant takings implications and does not affect any constitutionally protected property rights. This rule will not result in the physical occupancy of property, the physical invasion of property, or the regulatory taking of any property. In fact, these rules allow hunters to exercise otherwise unavailable privileges and, therefore, reduce restrictions on the use of private and public property. Energy Effects--Executive Order 13211 On May 18, 2001, the President issued Executive Order 13211 on regulations that significantly affect energy supply, distribution, and use. Executive Order 13211 requires agencies to prepare Statements of Energy Effects when undertaking certain actions. While this rule is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866, it is not expected to adversely affect energy supplies, distribution, or use. Therefore, this action is not a significant energy action and no Statement of Energy Effects is required. Government-to-Government Relationship With Tribes Due to the migratory nature of certain species of birds, the Federal Government has been given responsibility over these species by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Thus, in accordance with the President's memorandum of April 29, 1994, ``Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal Governments'' (59 FR 22951), Executive Order 13175, and 512 DM 2, we have evaluated possible effects on Federally recognized Indian tribes and have determined that there are no effects on Indian trust resources. However, in the May 28 proposed rule we solicited proposals for special migratory bird hunting regulations for certain Tribes on Federal Indian reservations, off-reservation trust lands, and ceded lands for the 2008-09 migratory bird hunting season. By virtue of these actions, we have consulted with all the Tribes affected by this rule. Federalism Effects Due to the migratory nature of certain species of birds, the Federal Government has been given responsibility over these species by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. We annually prescribe frameworks from which the States make selections regarding the hunting of migratory birds, and we employ guidelines to establish special regulations on Federal Indian reservations and ceded lands. This process preserves the ability of the States and tribes to determine which seasons meet their individual needs. Any State or tribe may be more restrictive than the Federal frameworks. The frameworks are developed in a cooperative process with the States and the Flyway Councils. This process allows States to participate in the development of frameworks from which they will make selections, thereby having an influence on their own regulations. These rules do not have a substantial direct effect on fiscal capacity, change the roles or responsibilities of Federal or State governments, or intrude on State policy or administration. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 13132, these regulations do not have significant federalism effects and do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Regulations Promulgation The rulemaking process for migratory game bird hunting must, by its nature, operate under severe time constraints. However, we intend that the public be given the greatest possible opportunity to comment. Thus, when the preliminary proposed rulemaking was published, we established what we believed were the longest periods possible for public comment. In doing this, we recognized that when the comment period closed, time would be of the essence. That is, if there were a delay in the effective date of these regulations after this final rulemaking, [[Page 55611]] States would have insufficient time to select season dates and limits; to communicate those selections to us; and to establish and publicize the necessary regulations and procedures to implement their decisions. We therefore find that ``good cause'' exists, within the terms of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, and these frameworks will, therefore, take effect immediately upon publication. Therefore, under authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (July 3, 1918), as amended (16 U.S.C. 703-711), we prescribe final frameworks setting forth the species to be hunted, the daily bag and possession limits, the shooting hours, the season lengths, the earliest opening and latest closing season dates, and hunting areas, from which State conservation agency officials will select hunting season dates and other options. Upon receipt of season selections from these officials, we will publish a final rulemaking amending 50 CFR part 20 to reflect seasons, limits, and shooting hours for the conterminous United States for the 2008-09 season. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 20 Exports, Hunting, Imports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation, Wildlife. Dated: September 18, 2008. Lyle Laverty, Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks. PART 20--[AMENDED] The rules that eventually will be promulgated for the 2008-09 hunting season are authorized under 16 U.S.C. 703-712 and 16 U.S.C. 742a-j. Final Regulations Frameworks for 2008-09 Late Hunting Seasons on Certain Migratory Game Birds Pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and delegated authorities, the Department has approved the following frameworks for season lengths, shooting hours, bag and possession limits, and outside dates within which States may select seasons for hunting waterfowl and coots between the dates of September 1, 2008, and March 10, 2009. General Dates: All outside dates noted below are inclusive. Shooting and Hawking (taking by falconry) Hours: Unless otherwise specified, from one-half hour before sunrise to sunset daily. Possession Limits: Unless otherwise specified, possession limits are twice the daily bag limit. Flyways and Management Units Waterfowl Flyways Atlantic Flyway--includes Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia. Mississippi Flyway--includes Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. Central Flyway--includes Colorado (east of the Continental Divide), Kansas, Montana (Counties of Blaine, Carbon, Fergus, Judith Basin, Stillwater, Sweetgrass, Wheatland, and all counties east thereof), Nebraska, New Mexico (east of the Continental Divide except the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation), North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming (east of the Continental Divide). Pacific Flyway--includes Alaska, Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and those portions of Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, and Wyoming not included in the Central Flyway. Management Units High Plains Mallard Management Unit--roughly defined as that portion of the Central Flyway that lies west of the 100th meridian. Definitions: For the purpose of hunting regulations listed below, the collective terms ``dark'' and ``light'' geese include the following species: Dark geese: Canada geese, white-fronted geese, brant (except in California, Oregon, Washington, and the Atlantic Flyway), and all other goose species except light geese. Light geese: Snow (including blue) geese and Ross' geese. Area, Zone, and Unit Descriptions: Geographic descriptions related to late-season regulations are contained in a later portion of this document. Area-Specific Provisions: Frameworks for open seasons, season lengths, bag and possession limits, and other special provisions are listed below by Flyway. Waterfowl Seasons in the Atlantic Flyway In the Atlantic Flyway States of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, where Sunday hunting is prohibited statewide by State law, all Sundays are closed to all take of migratory waterfowl (including mergansers and coots). Special Youth Waterfowl Hunting Days Outside Dates: States may select 2 consecutive days (hunting days in Atlantic Flyway States with compensatory days) per duck-hunting zone, designated as ``Youth Waterfowl Hunting Days,'' in addition to their regular duck seasons. The days must be held outside any regular duck season on a weekend, holiday, or other non-school day when youth hunters would have the maximum opportunity to participate. The days may be held up to 14 days before or after any regular duck-season frameworks or within any split of a regular duck season, or within any other open season on migratory birds. Daily Bag Limits: The daily bag limits may include ducks, geese, tundra swans, mergansers, coots, moorhens, and gallinules and would be the same as those allowed in the regular season. Flyway species and area restrictions would remain in effect. Shooting Hours: One-half hour before sunrise to sunset. Participation Restrictions: Youth hunters must be 15 years of age or younger. In addition, an adult at least 18 years of age must accompany the youth hunter into the field. This adult may not duck hunt but may participate in other seasons that are open on the special youth day. Tundra swans may only be taken by participants possessing applicable tundra swan permits. Atlantic Flyway Ducks, Mergansers, and Coots Outside Dates: Between the Saturday nearest September 24 (September 27) and the last Sunday in January (January 25). Hunting Seasons and Duck Limits: 60 days. The daily bag limit is 6 ducks, including no more than 4 mallards (2 hens), 1 black duck, 1 pintail, 1 mottled duck, 1 fulvous whistling duck, 3 wood ducks, 2 redheads, and 4 scoters. For scaup, the daily bag limit may be 2 for up to 20 consecutive hunting days, which may be split according to applicable zones/split duck hunting configurations approved for each State, and 1 for the remainder of the season. A daily bag limit of 2 scaup may also be included in the 6-bird daily bag limit for designated youth-hunt days. Closures: The season on canvasbacks and harlequin ducks is closed. Sea Ducks: Within the special sea duck areas, during the regular duck season in the Atlantic Flyway, States may choose to allow the above sea duck limits in addition to the limits applying to other ducks during the regular duck season.
