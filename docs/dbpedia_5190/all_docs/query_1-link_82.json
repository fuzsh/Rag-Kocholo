        "text": "This announcement is for general use – local conditions may vary and are subject to sometimes drastic changes.\n\nListen for the weekly Adirondack Outdoor Recreation Report Friday mornings on WNBZ (AM 920 & 1240, FM 105 & 102.1), WSLP (93.3) and the stations of North Country Public Radio.\n\nThe Adirondack Almanack publishes occasional Forest Ranger incident reports which form a stern reminder that wilderness conditions can change suddenly and accidents happen. Be aware of the latest weather conditions and carry adequate gear and supplies.\n\nSPECIAL NOTICES FOR THIS WEEKEND\n\n** indicates new or revised items.\n\n** VICTORIA DAY WEEKEND\n\nA higher number of people can be expected in the backcountry and on the waters this weekend due to the weather forecast and Canada’s Victoria Day Holiday. Visitors to the Eastern High Peaks Wilderness should be aware that trailhead parking lots and interior campsites will often fill to capacity on Victoria Day weekend. Please plan accordingly and seek backcountry recreation opportunities in other areas of the park.\n\n** HIGH WATERS – FLOODING\n\nDue to additional rains this past week, most waters remain well above normal. Caution should be used when crossing streams without foot bridges. Trails and campsites adjacent to waters may be flooded. Some low-lying waterfront properties remain submerged by high waters. Many boat launches in the region remain flooded, making it risky to launch and retrieve boats. Boaters and paddlers should be aware that waters are cold and swift and may contain logs, limbs and other debris. High waters also conceal navigation hazards such as boulders, rock shelves, docks and other structures that normally are easily seen and avoided. Consult the latest streamgage data and use extreme caution.\n\n** LAKE CHAMPLAIN REMAINS ABOVE FLOOD STAGE\n\nDuring the recent flooding Lake Champlain reached the highest level ever recorded on the USGS gauge at Burlington; the lake remains above flood stage. The Ausable Point Campground is closed, as is the campground access road. Many Valcour Island campsites and access points are flooded. Due to the high waters, floating docks have not been installed and bathrooms are closed at Peru Dock, Port Douglas, Willsboro Bay and other boat launches. The pump station is closed at the Peru Dock Boat Launch. Launching and retrieving boats will be difficult, especially for boaters not familiar with the location of ramps, walkways, docks, posts, etc. that are now underwater.\n\n** BITING INSECTS\n\nIt is “Bug Season” in the Adirondacks so Black Flies, Mosquitos, Deer Flies and/or Midges will be present. To minimize the nuisance wear light colored clothing, pack a head net and use an insect repellent.\n\n**BLOWDOWN\n\nSaturated soils have resulted in additional trees being toppled on and over tails and campsites. Blowdown may be present, especially on lesser used side trails.\n\n** ROAD CLOSURES\n\nMany secondary roads and backcountry roads remain closed due to flooding and/or mud season. Gates on roads designated for motor vehicle traffic will be reopened when conditions warrant.\n\n** WET AND MUDDY CONDITIONS\n\nThis is a good time to stay off wet trails. While snow is still present above 3,500 feet, lower and mid-elevation trails are wet and muddy. Be prepared by wearing waterproof footwear and gaiters, and remember to walk through – not around – mud and water on trails.\n\n** SNOW AT ELEVATION\n\nA foot or more of snow is present in elevations from 3500 feet to tree line. Snow may be found below 3500 feet on north and east facing slopes. Wear proper clothing and footwear (NO running shoes or shorts) and expect it to take much longer to traverse trails with snow.\n\n** ADIRONDACK PADDLEFEST IN OLD FORGE\n\nAdirondack Paddlefest 2011 will be held in Old Forge from Friday to Sunday, May 20-22. Now in its 13th year, Paddlefest is the largest on-water Paddlesports Show and Sale in the US. Thousands of paddlers will be in Old Forge to test paddle hundreds of different models of canoes, kayaks and whitewater boats. Paddling industry representatives and experts from companies such as Current Designs, Dagger, Ocean Kayak, Oxbow SUP, Wave Sport, Delta and Pyranha will be on hand to answer questions. Waterfront venues will be offering presentations, including Choosing the Perfect Kayak Paddle and Easier Paddling for All Skill Levels. There will also be classes on Tandem Canoe Paddling, Basic Kayak Strokes and a Kayaking clinic for kids. Other events will include live music, a concert on Saturday night, plus an art show. Admission is free for kids 12 and under, $5 for adults (per day) with a $20 test paddle fee that will be applied to admission fees and any boat purchases.\n\n** AUSABLE RIVER TWO-FLY CHALLENGE\n\nNow in it’s 12th year Now in its 10th year, Ausable River Two-Fly Challenge tournament brings together fly fisherman from across the United States, who want to test their skills on the acclaimed river, while at the same time promote the 35-mile long river as a fishery and raise money to protect it. Rules for the catch and release tournament are simple. Anglers are allowed to bring two barb-less hook flies, of any combination or patterns and once the flies are lost or unusable – you’re out. The tournament starts noon on Friday, May 20th and runs through Saturday evening. More information, including times and costs, is available online.\n\n** 19th ANNUAL HORICON MILL POND CHILDREN”S FISHING DERBY\n\nThe town of Horicon will host Barney Barnhardt children’s fishing derby at Mill Pond on Route 8 in Brant Lake (which includes a new handicapped accessible fishing pier) Warren County fish hatchery will stock the pond with several hundred rainbow trout. The derby is open to all kids 15 and under. Last year, nearly 250 kids took part; Fishing is banned in the pond after it is stocked until the derby.\n\nBEAR CANISTERS NOW REQUIRED IN HIGH PEAKS\n\nThe use of bear-resistant canisters is required for overnight users in the Eastern High Peaks Wilderness, and recommended throughout the Adirondacks, between April 1 and November 30. All food, toiletries and garbage must be stored in bear-resistant canisters.\n\nKnow The Latest Weather\n\nCheck the weather before entering the woods and be aware of weather conditions at all times — if weather worsens, head out of the woods.\n\nFire Danger: LOW\n\n** Central Adirondacks LOWER Elevation Weather\n\nFriday: Intermittent showers and thunderstorms, mostly cloudy, high near 65.\n\nFriday Night: Chance of showers and thunderstorms, mostly cloudy, low around 49.\n\nSaturday: Chance of showers and thunderstorms, partly sunny, high near 68.\n\nSaturday Night: Chance of showers and thunderstorms, mostly cloudy, low around 45.\n\nSunday: Partly sunny, with a high near 66.\n\nThe National Weather Service provides a weather forecast for elevations above 3000 feet and spot forecasts for the summits of a handful of the highest peaks in Clinton, Essex and Franklin counties. [LINK]\n\nRock Climbing Closures\n\nAll rock climbing routes on Moss Cliff in Wilmington Notch and the Upper and Lower Washbowl Cliffs at Chapel Pond remain closed to allow for peregrine falcon nesting. DEC has confirmed that peregrine falcons are nesting on the Nose on Poke-o-Moonshine Mountain and 54 climbing routes remain closed including Garter and Mogster (Routes #26 through #82 in Adirondack Rock) through the nesting season. See Adirondack Rock Climbing Route Closures for more information.\n\n** Warmwater Sportfishing Open\n\nThe fishing season for many popular warmwater sportfish species, including walleye, northern pike, pickerel, tiger muskellunge, and catch and release fishing for black bass (largemouth and smallmouth bass) is open in many waters across the state. Muskellunge fishing season and the regular (harvest) season for black bass open on the 3rd Saturday in June (June 18). Spring also provides outstanding fishing opportunities for yellow perch, sunfish and crappie. A complete listing of 2011 warmwater fishing hotspots recommended by DEC biologists can be found online.\n\n** Use Baitfish Wisely\n\nAnglers using fish for bait are reminded to be careful with how these fish are used and disposed of. Careless use of baitfish is one of the primary means by which non-native species and fish diseases are spread from water to water. Unused baitfish should be discarded in an appropriate location on dry land. A “Green List” of commercially available baitfish species that are approved for use in New York State has now been established in regulation. A discussion of these regulations and how to identify approved baitfish species is available online. Personal collection and use of baitfish other than those on the “Green List” is permitted, but only on the water from which they were collected and they may not be transported overland by motorized vehicle. Anglers are reminded that new regulations for transportation of baitfish are currently under consideration, and these proposed regulations can be viewed online.\n\n** Preventing Invasive Species and Fish Diseases\n\nAnglers are reminded to be sure to dry or disinfect their fishing and boating equipment, including waders and boots, before entering a new body of water. This is the only way to prevent the spread of potentially damaging invasive plant and animal species (didymo and zebra mussels) and fish diseases (Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia (VHS) and whirling disease). Methods to clean and disinfect fishing gear can be found online.\n\n** Lake Champlain Anglers\n\nWarmwater anglers on Lake Champlain are requested to report any catches of sauger to Emily Zollweg at the DEC Region 5 office in Warrensburg at (518) 623-1264. The status of sauger, a close relative of the walleye, has been unknown in the lake for a quite some time, until a single sauger was caught in a DEC survey last spring. Sauger can be distinguished from walleye by the three to four saddle-shaped dark brown blotches on their sides, the distinct black spots on the first dorsal (back) fin and the lack of a white tip on the lower lobe of the tail fin.\n\nTrout Season Opened April 1st\n\nTrout (brook, rainbow, brown and hybrids, and splake) and landlocked Salmon season opened April 1st, but the season is still suffering from high and cold waters. With large lakes like Lake Champlain and Lake George at record levels, smaller lakes and ponds are your best bet. For catch and size limits view the freshwater fishing regulations online.\n\nSpring Turkey Season Opened May 1\n\nDEC biologists expect the spring turkey harvest to be well below the state’s 10-year average of about 34,000 birds, and likely below last year take of 25,807. This is likely to be a third year of poor production in the Adirondacks. 2009 was one of the worst poult production years on record and as a result there will be fewer 2-year-olds, last year’s poor production means fewer yearlings (jakes). Because those birds make up most of the spring turkey harvest, it will likely be considerably lower than average.\n\nADIRONDACK LOCAL BACKCOUNTRY CONDITIONS\n\nNORTHVILLE PLACID TRAIL\n\n** West Canada Lakes Wilderness: The bridge over West Canada Creek on the Northville-Placid Trail has been washed away.\n\nThe Northville Placid Trail (NPT) is the Adirondack Park’s only designated long distance hiking trail.

See Adirondack Rock Climbing Route Closures for more information.\n\nNorton Peak Cave / Chateuagay Woodlands Conservation Easement Lands: Norton Peak Cave has been reopened to the public following the expiration of the cave closing order on March 31. The cave is a bat hibernacula with white nose syndrome present. DEC is considering whether to close all bat hibernacula caves on state lands and easements to protect the bat population. It’s best to stay out of caves at this time.\n\nGENERAL ADIRONDACK NOTICES\n\nAccidents Happen, Be Prepared\n\nWilderness conditions can change suddenly and accidents happen. Hikers and campers should check up-to-date forecasts before entering the backcountry as conditions at higher elevations will likely be more severe. All users should bring flashlight, first aid kit, map and compass, extra food, plenty of water and clothing. Be prepared to spend an unplanned night in the woods and always inform others of your itinerary.\n\nCave And Mine Closings\n\nWhite nose syndrome, the fungal disease that’s wiping out bat populations across the northeast has spread to at least 32 cave and mine bat hibernation sites across the New York state according to a recent survey. Populations of some bat species are declining in these caves and mines by 90 percent. White nose was first discovered in upstate New York in the winter of 2006-2007 and is now confirmed in at least 11 states. An order closing all bat hibernacula caves on state lands and easements to protect the bat population expired on March 31. DEC is reconsidering whether continuing the closing to protect the bat population is warranted. At this time it’s best to stay out of caves that may contain bats.\n\nPractice ‘Leave No Trace’ Principles\n\nAll backcountry users should learn and practice the Leave No Trace philosophy: Plan ahead and be prepared, travel and camp on durable surfaces, dispose of waste properly, leave what you find, minimize campfire impacts, respect wildlife, and be considerate of others. More information is available online.\n\n——————–\n\nWarnings and announcements drawn from DEC, NWS, NOAA, USGS, and other sources.
