        "text": "The forest health specialist zones were redrawn to better align with the new integrated forester teams, areas and districts. New coverage zones will go into effect on June 25, 2017.\n\nLinda Williams has changed coverage zones and is now located in Woodruff. Her new landline is 715-356-5211 ext. 232, but her cell phone number remains the same.\n\nMike Hillstrom has also changed coverage zones and is now located in Fitchburg. His new cell phone number is 608-513-7690.\n\nWe have 2 forest health specialist vacancies this field season, so we apologize in advance if it takes a little longer to respond to your inquiries. Coverage of the vacant zones is as follows:\n\nCentral Zone: Mike Hillstrom will cover Adams, Green Lake, Juneau, Marathon, Marquette, Portage, Waushara and Wood counties. Linda Williams will cover Lincoln County. Todd Lanigan will cover Taylor County.\n\nEast Central Zone: Linda Williams will cover Brown, Menominee, Oconto, Outagamie, Shawano and Waupaca counties. Bill McNee will cover Calumet, Door, Kewaunee and Manitowoc counties.\n\nWritten by: Rebecca Gray, forest health team leader, Fitchburg (rebecca.gray@wisconsin.gov), 608-275-3273.\n\nI’ve identified oak wilt in Plum Lake Township, Vilas Co, west of Sayner. This is the first find of oak wilt in Plum Lake Township. The closest known oak wilt location is 6.7 miles from this new site. The tree rapidly dropped its leaves last July, and when it didn’t leaf out this spring the homeowner called me. Upon examining the tree I was able to find an oak wilt pressure pad, which is the fungal spore mat that forms under the bark and causes the bark to crack, which is how beetles can get access to the spores and move them to other oaks.\n\nThe oak wilt map has been updated. Oak wilt is not common in our northern counties so the map highlights in pink the townships where oak wilt has been identified in the northern counties. The oak wilt guidelines for timber sales were updated about a year ago and list some exceptions and modifications for situations in which it is not necessary to implement the cutting restrictions during the high risk time period of the year (April 15 – July 15 in the north).\n\nHomeowners and those not doing timber sales should try to avoid pruning, wounding, or cutting oaks during the high risk time period of April 15 – July 15 in the north. This is the time of year when the beetles that can spread the spores overland will be attracted to fresh wounds on your trees; if you prune, wound, or cut your oaks during this period the beetles can introduce oak wilt to your tree. If it is necessary to prune, wound, or cut trees during that period, wound paint should be applied.\n\nOak wilt is always fatal to trees in the red oak group, which includes northern red oak, northern pin oak, and black oak. Trees that were infected with the oak wilt fungus this spring will begin rapidly dropping their leaves in July and August.\n\nWritten by: Linda Williams, forest health specialist, Woodruff, (Linda.Williams@wisconsin.gov), 715-356-5211 x232.\n\nStorms, storms, and more storms! It seems like we’ve had a lot of storms that brought severe weather this year. Storm damage to oaks at this time of year creates the risk of oak wilt introduction in new areas as the beetles that can spread oak wilt are attracted to the fresh wounds from the storm damage. Pine that is damaged by the storm can be infested by bark beetles, or blue stain can enter the wood via hail wounds, or Diplodia can kill branches that were damaged by wind or hail. When blowdown or tornado damage occurs it presents some additional forest health concerns with staining and decay. We have some information available online regarding storm damage, which currently highlights the May 16 tornado but applies to all tornado/wind damage to your trees.\n\nSome of the storms during the past month are highlighted below.\n\nContinue reading “Storm damage in May and June” →\n\nA late frost severely impacted newly emerging oak leaves in many northeast Wisconsin counties including Brown, Outagamie, Oconto, and Shawano. Due to the development stage, oaks were the most heavily impacted compared to other species, and oaks in the open were more severely impacted than oaks in forests. Many oaks in open areas had to send out additional leaves, which were then tattered by strong storms that pelted them with heavy rain, hail, and strong winds. Oak leaves in the counties mentioned may look a little rough for the remainder of this year.\n\nThe late frost also contributed to damage on ash leaflets, which, in addition to early anthracnose infections on the leaflets has caused ash in some northeastern counties to drop their damaged leaflets, leaving them mostly bare. They will send out additional leaves to get them through the summer.\n\nWritten by: Linda Williams, forest health specialist, Woodruff, (Linda.Williams@wisconsin.gov), 715-356-5211 x232.\n\nAs anticipated, anthracnose is common on a number of deciduous tree species statewide this spring, especially maple and ash. Many of the maple samples we’ve seen also have tar spot. The cool, wet, humid conditions this spring were ideal for fungal leaf diseases. Anthracnose symptoms appear as patches of brown or black, dead leaf tissue which may cause leaves to curl or shrivel up as damage progresses. Trees may drop the infected leaves but will send out new leaves within a few weeks.\n\nDamage to other species, including aspen, cottonwood and willow appears to have been caused by frost damage. These tree species likely became active and had the buds swell during the early warm up in February, then suffered damage to the buds and twigs from the cold weather thereafter. Although the damage was severe in some cases it seems that the trees produced new buds and are working on sending out additional leaves.\n\nSignificant dieback was noted in many locations around the state, including on some hybrid poplar in Shawano County, on trembling aspen in central and northern Oconto County, and on big toothed aspen in western Vilas County. We had reports of impacted aspen, cottonwood and willow from south central, southwest, central, west central and northcentral Wisconsin. Forest health specialists in Minnesota report similar damage.\n\nKeep impacted trees healthy by watering (where possible) during hot and dry periods to help the trees recover.\n\nWritten by: Mike Hillstrom, forest health specialist, Fitchburg, (Michael.Hillstrom@wisconsin.gov), 608-513-7690"
