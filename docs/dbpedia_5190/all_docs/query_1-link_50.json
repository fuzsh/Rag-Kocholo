        "text": "Amy FeiereiselHere's what you said about spring and climate change in the North Country\n\nOn the first day of spring, March 19, the NCPR newsroom started a year-long series reporting on climate change in the North Country. Our goal is to look at how climate change is impacting every aspect of our lives — from the economy to agriculture to people’s gardens to the whole North Country culture — and what people are doing to adapt.\n\nOur first step was to ask what North Country residents think we should report on through an online survey. About 180 people responded from all over the region, from Schroon Lake to Lowville, Peru to the Fulton Chain, Potsdam to Lake George.\n\nWe asked people what concerns them most about climate change, what questions they want answered, and the changes they’ve noticed in their own environment. The news team has been reading through responses, and there are lots of stories on the way, from Climate Change Diaries to stories of resilience and adaptation.\n\nHere, some of what folks said about this past winter and this spring.\n\nConcerns over the loss of winter, for culture and economic activity\n\nIn the 140 years that’s been recorded, this was New York’s warmest winter ever. That’s alongside seven other states in the Midwest and Northeast.\n\nIn our survey, there were lots of observations of that change.\n\nThe temperature did not drop below zero this winter for the first time in my 49 years of living in the North Country. - Northeast Adirondacks.\n\nI live on the St. Lawrence River. There was minimal ice on the river in 2021-22 and no ice at all 2023-24. Our average snowfall in Alexandria Bay is 62\". Last year we had approx 20\" and this year I measured 10\". - Alexandria Bay\n\nWe bought our house in Tupper Lake in 1991. The roof structure had some damage and we were concerned about the snow load. I bought a small electric snow blower that I could use to keep the snow off the roof. I cleared it off 2-3 times each winter and the snow depth was always up to my crotch. I cannot remember the last time I needed to blow off my roof. - Tupper Lake\n\nFor people's day to day lives, the warmer winter meant fewer opportunities to cross country ski, snowmobile, and ice fish.\n\nCommunity ice skating rinks with natural ice are quickly becoming a thing of the past in small towns across the region. Gone are the days of flooding the local park and having ice all winter. Now it is a constant cycle of making ice, seeing it melt and rebuilding. Some municipalities have just given up on even trying to offer this. - Lewis County\n\nOur son, 9, just started snowboarding this year, and he was only able to go out a handful of times, due to lack of snow. - Watertown\n\nThe biggest impact I've seen is the decrease of recreational opportunities because of the lack of snow. The seasons for ice skating, tubing, and skiing were so short this year. - Lowville\n\nThis year in particular we saw the lack of snow, but generally, year after year, we never know what the winter will bring in terms of ice on the lake. It seems the large ice fishing communities that used to spring up on the lake are a thing of the past. - Crown Point\n\nThat also meant big economic impacts for winter tourism, and that was a top concern for respondents when it comes to climate change.\n\nI worry about our traditional seasonal jobs. Many people are/were reliant on tourism in our area. The impacts of climate change have severely impacted tourism. I have hope because North Country residents are survivalists at heart and self-reliant so (they'll) make changes that are necessary to continue to live here. - Potsdam\n\nI work as a volunteer ski patroller at Gore Mountain. I’ve certainly (especially this year) seen warmer and wetter winter with less snow...which might be nice in Clifton Park. At Gore, we’ve skied through rain in January and February, and had a greater reliance on man-made snow. The mountain, often frozen solid through the coldest months, was noisy with the sound of running water, snow melt, really. - North Creek\n\nEvery snow storm started and ended with rain. We certainly saw an effect on guest traffic, especially mid-week skiers. - Wilmington\n\nThere were lots of memories shared about winters past, and sorrow or grief over what's been lost.\n\nMy biggest concern is the loss of true ADK winters. - Schroon Lake\n\nWarm and cold spells, early ice, confused gardens\n\nLots of folks noted that bodies of water near them had the ice go out very early.\n\nI live on a small body of water, about a mile long. Ice out was a full month earlier than usual this year. Ice thickness is half of what it was forty years ago. - Horicon\n\nThe foremost change this year has been the lack of snow and the fact that the lake has opened up earlier than anyone can remember. - Cranberry Lake\n\nI live in Newcomb, one of the coldest parts of the Adirondacks and in the heart of the Park! I live on a small lake that seems to be frozen solid later each fall and had ice out earlier. - Newcomb\n\nThe winter was full of spring-like warm spells, and then a return of cold.\n\nSpring is sooner and sometimes more damaging, as birds and plants emerge only to be frozen a week later. - Beekmantown\n\nVery little hard ground freeze over winters. Plants and ground critters up to six weeks. No tick death for 4 years now. This winter the flower garden never really died off. - Lake George\n\nMarch this year came in like a lamb and went out like a lion. So the term “climate chaos” is apt. Nothing is predictable and all of our ecosystems rely on stable weather patterns. - Canton\n\nPeople shared garden reports, with folks talking about flowers and fruit trees coming up or budding early in March, and then getting covered in snow and ice.\n\nMy garden has no idea what to do. I have garlic overwintering in a raised bed that sprouted in February. I had tulips blossom last week that I currently have covered with a bucket because of the colder temperatures and snow we received this week. - DeKalb\n\nLast year we had a warm spell such that red maple trees budded out in early March and then froze. The trees then barely leafed out in the summer. Will they recover this year? - Pierrepont\n\nHardiness zones changing means big changes for North Country agriculture\n\nIn New York, the average annual temperature is 3 degrees warmer than it was in 1970, and in the northeast, our winters are warming three times faster than our summers. Those warmer winter temperatures are actually changing what can grow here and when.\n\nOne important marker of that is the United States' ‘Plant Hardiness Zone Map,’ which is made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It divides the country into zones, which are defined by their long-term, average coldest winter temperatures.\n\nLots of North Country residents use this map to pick plants that will survive and grow in their area. Explore the map here.\n\nI have lived in the North Country for almost 20 years. Maple sugaring was always after mid-March. Robins came in mid-March. Geese came in later. Now these events have moved to February...my maple trees were fully leafed out on May 1 last year (as opposed to May 10 in previous years). I can grow Zone 5 plants easily (used to be Zone 4 only). - Canton\n\nThe official Plant Hardiness Zone Map was updated in the Fall of 2023; the previous one was made in 2012. The new map shows that about half of the country has moved into a warmer hardiness zone.\n\nIn the North Country, the zone of 3b — which has winters with lows of -35 to -30 degrees Fahrenheit — has disappeared altogether from our map. A lot of what was 4a is now a warmer zone, 4b. And some areas in Clinton, Jefferson and Warren counties are now 5a for the first time ever.\n\nKen Kogut is an avid gardener and former DEC biologist. He lives between Canton and Potsdam, which is classified 4b now.\n\n\"We’re right on the cusp of being a zone 5,\" he said, \"and if you look at this past winter, I think our coldest day was -8 maybe? So you see this trend of getting warmer, so as a gardener and someone who has fruit trees and berries, you think, is this good or is this bad? Well it’s good, but it’s also bad because we don’t lose those erratic temperature changes that can still occur for us.\"\n\nThe volatility of weather and erratic temperatures\n\nMany people noted that what stands out to them the most about our changing climate is the volatility of weather; erratic swings in temperature, more flooding, and stronger windstorms, and even tornadoes (there have been some particularly severe wind storms in Lewis County in the last two years).\n\nI'm concerned because storms seem far more severe. The rain that was suspended in clouds longer than normal will suddenly be released in a deluge, causing flooding and damaging roads and trails. - Burke\n\nOne noticeable impact has been an increase in high winds and fast-moving weather fronts. The drop in barometric pressure is tough on people with arthritis or other inflammatory conditions. Our family visits us at Thanksgiving and Christmas. This year we had rain both times! - Lake Clear\n\nThe largest impact I’ve noticed is the lack of predictability in weather patterns, especially regarding winter weather. From 60 degrees for a few days in January to the teens the next few days, up and down, never allowing for snowpack, resulting in a months long mud season. - Potsdam\n\nIn the past few years we've seen a series of intense tornadoes and weather events. Rain events have flooded yards at the bottom of the hill I live on. - Lewis County\n\nRain and more rain...and humidity\n\nMore precipitation is a big part of the climate change trend in New York.\n\nThe northeastern U.S. has experienced about a 70% increase in heavy precipitation from 1958 to 2010, and that’s more than any other region in the country. So while it’s not wetter everywhere, it truly is wetter here, and stormier.\n\nMy family land (acquired around 1980) is wetter than it's ever been. My mother bought that land specifically for how dry it was. Parts that have always been bone dry now have standing water for large portions of the year.\n\nWe have noticed: milder winters, heavy rain downpours, lake not freezing as long, more black flies and mosquitos, winter starts later but less snow. - Schroon Lake\n\nVery wet, flooding; rivers and marshes are high. - Stony Creek\n\nWhen we first bought our farmhouse, I planted a vegetable garden where the traditional garden used to be, and harvested tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, and string beans. Slowly this area had increased rainfall, and, since the property is on gently sloping land, the increased groundwater leached nutrients from the soil. For many years I've not been able to have a garden there, and 3 dwarf apple trees that the excavator moved there from an addition on the west, finally died. - Schroon Lake\n\nWith increased rain and storms, humidity has increased in the region as well.\n\nI used to come to the ADKs to vacation, and the increase in humidity from the summers I experienced decades ago to those experienced now is oppressive. - Keeseville"
