Their opponents from Pool A include Galeries Tower, Farm Fresh, and Nxled.\n\nThe Chargers, with a perfect 5-0 record, will face the Highrisers (0-5) at 1 p.m. This match will be followed by the HD Spikers (4-1) taking on the Foxies (2-3) at 3 p.m., and the Solar Spikers (3-2) battling the Chameleons (1-4) at 5 p.m. in Pool D.\n\nOly Okaro, the prolific Akari import, will continue to lead the team, supported by key locals such as Grethcel Soltones, Joy Soyud, Ivy Lacsina, Camille Victoria, and Ced Domingo.\n\nThe Highrisers will rely on their Thai import, Chuewulim Sutadta, alongside local talents France Ronquillo, Dimdim Pacres, Graze Bombita, RJ Doromal, Roselle Baliton, and Andrea Marzan.\n\nMeanwhile, Cignal will be returning from a tough 25-15, 17-25, 19-25, 22-25 loss to Akari earlier this week. They will be led by MJ Perez, Ces Molina, Roselyn Doria, Chin Basas, Jacqueline Acuna, Riri Meneses, and playmaker Gel Cayuna.\n\nCapital1, fresh off an 18-25, 25-20, 25-19, 25-18 victory over ZUS Coffee, will aim to continue their winning form with the help of import Marina Tushova and locals Norielle Ipac, Des Clemente, Jenya Torres, and Leila Cruz.\n\nIn Pool C, the top teams from Pool A—Chery Tiggo, Creamline, and PLDT—will face off against Choco Mucho (1-4), Petro Gazz (2-3), and ZUS Coffee (0-5) on Tuesday. All three teams currently hold identical 4-1 records.\n\nThe top four teams from each pool will advance to the knockout quarterfinals.\n\n(ia/mnm)"
