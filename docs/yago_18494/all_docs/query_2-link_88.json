Based on MMDA Statistics, there have been 2,242 Fatalities in Metro Manila alone with the infamous EDSA & Commonwealth Killer Highways racking up 13% of total victims.\n\nThese 2,242 Fatalities in Metro Manila for the past 7 years could have saved breadwinners, daughters, & sons from a cruel & untimely death. With the severe lack of Road User Segregation, we face the horror of 1 DEATH PER DAY in the menacing streets of the behemoth city of Metro Manila.\n\nWith this Philippine Movement, we are stepping up to support the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020 as declared by the United Nations, World Health Organization, Global Road Safety Partnership, and the International Federation of Red Cross & Red Crescent Societies.\n\nJOIN THE PHILIPPINE MOVEMENT NOW ! ! !\n\n=================================\n\nDEDICATED & IN MEMORIAM : Alfredo \"Mang Padi\" Padilla\n\n> 70 year old Ex Professional Athlete\n\n> Friend, Fellow Biker and Comrade Advocate\n\nWith blessings from his family, we started this campaign in his honor and to all the countless fatalities in Metro Manila who have lost their dreams in an instant.\n\nJune 18, 2010\n\nCrushed to Death by a 10 Wheel Trailer Truck\n\nalong UN Avenue in Pandacan, Malate, Manila\n\n=================================\n\nBicycle Law Senate Bill 2688 \"Bicycle Act of 2011\"\n\nhttp://www.senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=15&q=SBN-2688\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/BICYCLE-LAW-SB-2688-Sen-Villar-Read-Take-Action/241878925875480\n\nSENATOR MANNY B. VILLAR\n\nEXPLANATORY NOTE\n\nIt is a declared policy of the State to protect and pr'lmote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them. Concomitant to this is the State duty to protect the environment enroute to a balanced and healthful ecology. The development of the bicycle occurred over a 'period of around seventy years and yet; throughout that period, cyclists had no legal right to use the roads or walkways.\n\nThe first Bicycle Law was enacted by the New York State Legislature in 1887 entitled, \"An Act in relation to the use of bicycles and tricycles\"]. As the years went on, simultaneous with the growing popularity of the bicycle, several American states followed suit and enacted their own bicycle related ordinances aiming to give cyclists equal rights, privileges and duties with respect to road usage. In 1968, the cyclists' right to the road was enshrined in international law with the enactment of the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic.\n\nIn the Philippines, one of the first laws related to bicycle use was enacted by the Marikina City Council in 1996 which dwells on the use of all streets, avenues, alleys, sidewalks, bridges, parks, and other public places as bicycle lanes. In 200 I, another ordinance from the same city created a Bikeways Office tasked to create, supervise and. manage bikeways in the city. Recently, another bicycle ordinance was approved on second reading in the City of Davao.\n\nIt is no wonder that different cities and municipalities are following the bicycle law model which Marikina has pioneered. Bicycle riding not only promotes health and leisure but also provides for an alternative solution to high fuel prices, increasing tqlllsport fares, traffic management, air and noise pollution and high cost of motorized vehicles including maintenance and parking fees. Of recent, the Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex has integrated a bicycle lane in its road network.\n\nThis bill seeks to provide a framework for a bicycle law on a national level so that Filipino commuters may find a cheaper alternative to get to their destination while saving the environment from harmful emissions.\n\nThus, the passage of this bill is earnestly sought."
