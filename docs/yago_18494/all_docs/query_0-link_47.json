        "text": "Manny Villar is famous for his “Sipag at Tyaga” slogan, which reflects his modest beginnings. But more than that, the former Senate President has used his wise judgement in business.\n\nHe ventured into affordable mass housing developments before moving up to provide for the upscale market and pursued investments in other property segments, including integrated community development projects.\n\nEven with “sipag at tyaga” if one is not employing the right business judgement and management skills, Villar would not have achieved the status as the country’s richest.\n\nVillar’s story resonates with most Filipinos’ journey to uproot themselves from poverty. At a very young age, Villar was already helping his mother sell shrimp and fish in the Divisoria market, the country’s famous bargain center. He finished his college education from the University of the Philippines Diliman, where he also earned his master’s degree in Business Administration and Accountancy.\n\nVillar married his college sweetheart Cynthia Villar with whom he has three kids.\n\nHis wife Cynthia now serves as a Senator together with their son Mark, who once served as secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways. His only daughter is now a member of the House Representative for Las Pinas while he co run the family’s bustling business empire with another son Paolo."
