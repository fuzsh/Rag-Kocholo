The Nacionalista Party began in the early 20th century as the main vehicle for Philippine independence from Spain and later the United States. It dominated national politics for decades and produced several presidents. During the Japanese occupation, political parties were banned but the Nacionalistas went dormant. It was revived in the late 1980s by the Laurel family. Current leaders include Manny Villar and Alan Peter Cayetano. Prominent past members included presidents Quezon, Laurel, Quirino, Magsaysay, and Garcia. The party supports Filipino nationalism, conservatism, and economic liberalism.",
