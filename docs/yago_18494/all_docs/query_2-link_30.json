        "text": "Sen. Manuel Villar remained the only billionaire member of the Senate last year, with Sen. Francis “Chiz” Escudero the poorest, based on their Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) for 2012.\n\nVillar, whose family owns a highly successful real estate business, declared P1,452,615,408 in assets for 2012. He has no listed liabilities. His combined net worth with his wife, incoming Senator Cynthia Villar, was the only one that broke the billion peso mark.\n\nEscudero, who was re-elected in the recently concluded midterm polls, meanwhile has the lowest net worth at P4,017,082 — a dip of almost P6 million from his P9,867,082 net worth in 2011. The decrease occurred after his marriage with Christine Elizabeth Flores was annulled.\n\nBased on his 2011 SALN, Escudero owned two condominium units in New Manila, Quezon City, a 1995 Range Rover Classic, a 1969 BMW 2002, and a 1996 Toyota Land Cruiser. But in his 2012 SALN, the condo units were no longer declared under his real properties, Also, his finances went down by P300,000 and his jewelry and other properties by P450,000.\n\nOn the other hand, Escudero's earnings from his endorsements, however, were noticeably missing from his 2012 SALN. These include his endorsements of meat products, a herbal supplement and a computer school. GMA News Online was still trying to reach Escudero for comment as of posting time.\n\nBelow are the 24 senators of the 15th Congress and their respective net worths based on the 2012 SALNs they submitted to the Senate Secretariat.\n\nSen.
