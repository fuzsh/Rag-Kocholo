        "text": "SENATOR CYNTHIA VILLAR is chair of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Food and the Committee on Government-Owned Corporations. But before she could get to her favorite advocacies, she first had to tackle politics questions thrown to her by members of the Bulong Pulungan media forum at Hotel Sofitel, when she graced the forum last Tuesday, September 8, 2015.\n\nSenator Villar is not running for any post in 2016, so you hear not the candidates’ vote-getting statements, but straightforward comments on the issues at hand.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nBangsamoro Basic Law (BBL)\n\n“Malabo na.”\n\nThe Senator said the chance of getting the BBL passed is bleak for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, there’s not enough time. “We have only five weeks to go from now (September 8) to October 7 (the last working day of the Senate as it will go on break on October 8), we have only five weeks. I don’t think we will be able to pass it.”\n\nSecond, it seems no one’s interested. “At the House, they don’t have a quorum. Sometimes, the lack of quorum is a sign… that they don’t want to do something about it.”\n\nThird, the BBL might just not work: “If you see the original version, matatakot ka.”\n\nVillar pointed out the original provides for a big budget for the Bangsamoro government, giving it powers similar to those of the national government, thus opening for the possibility that the Bangsamoro will become a separate state.\n\n“You don’t try to give chances that people will separate from each other,” she said.\n\nThe Senator noted that even amendments to the BBL presented by Senator Bongbong Marcos will have a hard time getting the nod of Congress: “Bongbong wants to discuss the bill but it doesn’t mean he’s in favour of passing it… Because do you think they (rebels) won’t go to war if there’s a BBL?”\n\nText scam\n\nThe text scam is a personal battle for Senator Villar: “For the last two years, (the scammers) have been telling people that they won something in a raffle of the Villar Foundation. It’s black propaganda against us and at the same time they are asking the people for money. Usually the victims are the poor people. “\n\nFor example, one victim was a janitor at the NAIA (Ninoy Aquino International Airport). The Senator said the janitor told her someone texted him, telling him he won a house and lot in a Villar Foundation raffle. The scammer texted a bank account number and instructed him to deposit P5,000 in the bank account— to be able to win his raffle prize. He did, but he never received the prize.\n\n“That P5,000 must had been his entire one-month salary. I pitied him, so I just gave him the money he lost,” Villar said. “But I cannot go on reimbursing what people claim they lost— because that might be another scam.”\n\nPointing out the urgency of the issue, she added that recently, the National Bureau of Investigation arrested members of a syndicate which had collected P100-million worth of load.\n\nThus, Senator Villar is presenting a bill to regulate text messaging through mandatory registration of pre-paid Subscriber Identity Module (SIM). But those opposing the bill say it is an invasion of people’s privacy.\n\nVillar is optimistic the bill will be passed because another issue against unregulated text messaging is that it is used messaging is used by terrorists: “The Committee against terrorism is headed by Senator Tito Sotto, so we are working together on this bill.”\n\nNacionalista Party candidates\n\nThere are three vice presidentiables in the Nacionalista Party— Senator Allan Cayetano, Senator Antonio Trillanes, and Senator Bongbong Marcos. “We cannot comment (on who the party will support) until they decide what to do,” Villar said.\n\nShe added: “There is news that there will be a proclamation at the Philippine Arena about (Vice President Jejomar) Binay and Bongbong tandem.”\n\nHow much a presidential candidate would spend in the 2016 Election\n\n“Depends. If people think you have money, they will expect much from you…You might have to spend P2 to P4 billion.”\n\nAutomated election\n\n“We know the program can be hacked or changed.”\n\nI told her Smartmatic assured the machines cannot be cheated.\n\nThe Senator just fell silent and simply pursed her lips.\n\nTwo-party system\n\nVillar lamented the party system in the Philippines. The presidential system, she pointed out, should really have a two-party system. The parliamentary form, on the other hand, has multi-party.\n\n“Here, we have mixed it up. We have a multi-party system in the presidential form. Kaya medyo magulo tayo,” she said. “When someone wins as president, everybody joins his party. When he loses, everybody goes to the other party.”\n\nThe Senator pointed out the problem with our party system: “A party here has no clear platform.”\n\nShe addded, “But at NP, we try to stand for something.”\n\nShe pointed out an example given by her husband, former Senate President Manny Villar: “When we asked for independence from foreigners, it was the NP who was in power. We asked for political independence. But we later realized it is not enough that we have political independence. To be truly independent, we have to be economically independent too. We can be economically independent if the people are not poor. If they don’t depend on anybody, they can stand for something.”\n\nAgriculture and Food\n\nWith politics issues all done with, Villar finally got to go to Agriculture. She said she chose the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Food because if you look at statistics, specifically the figure on poverty, all the poor people are in agriculture: “Because the national average of people living below the poverty line is 25%. At least one-fourth of our population are living below the poverty threshold of P5,000 a month. Some 40% of our fishermen are living below the poverty line. among our coconut farmers, 60% are also living below the poverty line. So you will realize why our poverty threshold is 25%— because even if other sectors are able the poverty line, the statistics are pulled down by the agriculture sector.”\n\nShe added: “So if you want to reduce poverty, go to agriculture. Then you try to learn what’s wrong with our agriculture, why are the people poor? So you study and look for solutions to reduce poverty.”\n\nHer solutions:\n\nOn the El Nino or drought:\n\nPlant crops that will need less water to grow.\n\nCreate a catchment basin to store oversupply of water during rainy season, which can be used for irrigation.\n\nOn illegal fishing\n\n“There’s a study that if we cannot prevent illegal fishing, in 36 years, the ocean would be a virtual desert and we will rely on aquaculture for our fish needs. That’s why we passed an amendment to the Fisheries Code of 1998 providing sanctions on illegal fishing.\n\nBut “…there is such a thing as municipal water, that’s 15 kilometers from the post. That’s for the small fisherfolks and it’s under the control of the local government. When we passed the Fisheries Code, we did not touch that. When you pass something, you don’t touch the local government code or it will be very controversial…”\n\nOn rice smuggling\n\n“Consistently, 600,000 metric tons a year are smuggled,” Villar said.\n\nShe said that if this number is not added to the official statistics on rice importation, there will be an oversupply, and consequently, the price of rice would be too low for rice production to be profitable for our farmers.\n\nSo Villar proposes that the rice importation should be a government-to-government transaction so there will be no smuggling.\n\nBut because of the trade liberalization policy, importation of rice by private groups is encouraged— which, on the other hand, also encourages smuggling. “So, it’s a tedious work for the Bureau of Customs to determine which is smuggled and which is not,” Villar said, shrugging her shoulders.\n\nOn lack of farmers’ qualified heirs\n\nFamily farms may eventually be extinct because children of family farms are not interested in the industry since the income is not lucrative enough.\n\n“Corporate farms will not work,” Villar said. “We have to make family farms earn to motivate the children not to leave the farms.”\n\nThe solution, Villar said, is to teach farmers to mechanize, and how to plant crops other than rice so their income will increase.\n\nVillar added: “Otherwise we will have a problem with food security by 2050.”\n\nTraaaffiiic\n\nThe prediction on food security, no matter how horrible, unfortunately is not the star issue nowadays. Villar’s problem is not agriculture, but, like the rest of us mortals, it’s getting through traffic.\n\n“I’m afraid to go to EDSA,” she quipped. “If you dare go back and forth through EDSA, you’ll not get anything done.”\n\nTraffic is no problem in Las Pinas, her bailiwick.\n\n“We have the C-5, remember?” she asked, referring to the controversial road construction that, unfortunately, was a major issue that frustrated Manny Villar’s bid for the presidency in 2010.\n\nOn the Villars’ political future\n\n“My son (Mark Villar) is not sure about running for the Senate in 2016. He still has one term for Congress. He might run for the Lower House.\n\n“My husband will not run (for any post) in 2016. In 2010 his focus was politics. But now he has gained back the momentum (of running the business) so it’s already difficult for him to go back (to politics).\n\n“My term in the Senate ends in 2019. If I want to, I can still run for a second term.”\n\nDuring Bulong Pulungan, standing, from left: Joy Fong, Vanity; Cynthia Santiago, Woman Today; Rina David, Philippine Inquirer; Aida Sevilla, Philippine Inquirer; Mila Alora, Philippine Information Agency; Frank Evaristo, Rotary Manila; Jullie Yap Daza, Manila Bulletin, presenting Senator Villar certificate of appreciation ; Bob Zozobrado, Manila Standard; Beth Tagle, Newsmakers; Pete Dacuycuy, publicist; and Bulong moderator Deedee Siytangco, Manila Bulletin."
