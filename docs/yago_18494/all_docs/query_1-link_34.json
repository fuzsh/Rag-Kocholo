        "text": "Outgoing Senator Cynthia Villar on Wednesday disclosed that she is eyeing mayoral position or a congressional seat in Las Piñas City.\n\n\"I want to run for mayor kaya lang may (but there are) other considerations. So we'll see,\" Villar told reporters in an interview.\n\nHowever, Villar said her husband, former Senate President Manny Villar, wants her to run for Congress as she confirmed that their daughter, Las Piñas Representative Camille Villar, will run for the Senate.\n\n\"Gusto ni Manny ako kasi nga wala na sa Congress si Camille,\" the senator said.\n\n(Manny wants me to run for Congress because Camille will leave her congressional post.)\n\nBut despite this, Villar said she will decide on which post she will vie for in October where the period of filing of candidacy is scheduled.\n\n\"[In] the end ako rin ang magde-decide,\" she said. \"Alam mo minsan pag nagde-decide kayo, you decide in a manner na parang wise. You make wise decision... Di naman kami emotional about this.\"\n\n(In the end, I will be the one who will decide. When we decide, we decide in a manner that is wise. We are not emotional about this.)\n\nShould she run for mayor, Villar said a relative of hers will run for Congress.\n\nBut Villar said she will not reach out to her niece to ask her to back down.\n\n\"Di kasi ako kumakausap nang ganon eh. Lumapit sila sa akin. Hindi ako lalapit sa kanila,\" she said.\n\n(I do not do that. They should be the ones who approach me. I will not reach out to them.)\n\nAccording to Villar, she will run against her niece, Las Piñas Vice Mayor April Aguilar.\n\nVillar said someone has already volunteered to be her vice mayor, but she did not disclose the person’s identity.\n\nAsked if her husband would like to return to politics, Villar said, \"Not in his wildest imagination. Happy [na] happy siya sa kanyang business.\"\n\n(He is very happy with his business.)"
