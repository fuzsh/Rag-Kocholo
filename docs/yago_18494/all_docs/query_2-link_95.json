        "text": "By Junex Doronio\n\nMANILA — Commission on Elections (Comelec) Chairman George Garcia revealed on Thursday (08 Aug 2024) that a “foreign entity” is attempting to interfere in the Philippine elections.\n\nThis discovery comes after identifying the firms behind an ongoing “demolition job” against Comelec.\n\nIn a press conference, Garcia pointed to a US-based company that allegedly opened a US bank account in his name, accusing him of holding offshore accounts to stash bribe money.\n\n“Who is behind opening the account or making deposits to make it appear as mine? It wasn’t erased [from Marcoleta’s presentation]… Jaleo Consulting LLC sent it. When I saw that, I was shocked because this is direct intervention in the Philippine election by a foreign entity, which is strictly prohibited,” Garcia stated.\n\nComelec previously banned Smartmatic from participating in all future procurements after it was implicated in a US bribery case involving former Comelec Chairman Andy Bautista.\n\nIn a statement, Smartmatic denied any involvement in the “demolition job” against the country’s poll body.\n\n(ia/mnm)"
