        "text": "Published February 12, 2013 5:34pm\n\nDespite their history, former Senator Jamby Madrigal on Tuesday called former Las Piñas Rep. Cynthia Villar her \"friend\" during the proclamation rally of the Liberal Party (LP).\n\nDuring LP's proclamation rally in Plaza Miranda, Madrigal introduced each of her fellow senatorial candidates on the LP slate.\n\nWhen she was about to introduce Villar, she said:\n\n\"Susunod, alam ko na malakas ang sigaw ng mga tao diyan... ang aking kaibigang si Cynthia Villar,\" she said.\n\n\"Magva-Valentine's na... buksan natin ang puso natin para sa isa't-isa,\" she added.\n\nMadrigal had locked horns with Villar's husband, Sen. Manny Villar. after she accused him of corruption in connection with the C-5 road extension project.\n\nMrs. Villar, however, had said that she and her husband have moved on from issues regarding Jamby and former President Benigno Aquino III, who won the 2010 presidential elections. Manny Villar and Madrigal also sought the presidency in 2010. “Hindi tayo dapat mag-dwell sa past because we cannot be successful that way,\" Cynthia Villar had said. \"We should be positive.\"\n\nShe said this was the reason why she decided to run under a coalition led by Aquino’s LP, under which Madrigal is also running. — Kimberly Jane Tan/RSJ, GMA News"
