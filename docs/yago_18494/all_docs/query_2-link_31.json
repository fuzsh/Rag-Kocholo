        "text": "Convention has stereotyped kids born into wealth as spoiled brats, pleasure-seekers, and lacking self-initiative. Admittedly, there are those.\n\nBut such generalization of rich kids is being debunked by those who lead purposeful lives despite their entitlements and hefty bank accounts, .\n\nPEP.ph (Philippine Entertainment Portal) lists the heiresses of the country's billionaires who occupy a spot in the top 15 of Forbes' Philippines' Richest 2022.\n\nThey are all accomplished women who are not just continuing and growing their family businesses, but also investing in causes for the betterment of society.\n\nCAMILLE VILLAR\n\nCamille Villar is the youngest and only daughter of former Senate President Manuel “Manny” Villar and Senator Cynthia Villar.\n\nPHOTO: Camille Villar on Facebook\n\nManny Villar ranks as the second richest in the Philippines, with a net worth of $7.8 billion grown primarily from his real-estate business.\n\nCamille is a graduate of Bachelor of Science in Management from the Ateneo de Manila University.\n\nShe obtained her Masters of Business Administration (MBA) from the esteemed Institution de Estudios Superiores de la Eprese (IESE) in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nThe unica hija of the Villars has followed in her parents' entrepreneurial and political footsteps.\n\nShe is on her second consecutive term as the representative for the lone district of Las Piñas City.\n\nIn 2021, she was elected as one of the deputy speakers of the House of Representatives.\n\nAmong the bills she has filed in Congress is an act that requires entrepreneurship to be included as a separate subject in the K-12 program curricula.\n\nHer other bills focus on women’s health; micro, small, and medium entrepreneurs; and children’s welfare.\n\nLate last year, the congresswoman was named Government Hero of the Year by the Stevie Awards for Women in Business in Las Vegas, USA.\n\nShe was hailed for her COVID-19 response, particularly for the program \"May Bahay Sa Bakuna,\" which raffled off a house and lot. She established the incentives campaign to encourage her constituents to get vaccinated.\n\nOn the business front, Camille sits as the president and CEO of AllValue, the family’s retail corporation that includes home stores, supermarkets, and food establishments.\n\nAccording to her official website, she is also a director in Starmalls Inc., Golden Bria Holdings Inc., and Vista Land & Lifescapes Inc.\n\nCamille dipped her toes in showbiz as well, which probably gave her the impetus to file House Resolution 451.\n\nThis bill aims to increase the incentives and assistance the government gives to the country’s contenders for the Best International Film category of the Oscars.\n\nShe was one of Willie Revillame’s co-hosts on Wil Time Bigtime from 2012 to 2013 and on Wowowillie in 2013.\n\nCamille is married to Erwin Genuino.\n\nThey have a six-year-old son named Tristan and are currently expecting their second child.\n\nKATRINA RAZON\n\nEnrique Razon chairs the behemoth International Container Terminal Services (ICTSI) and is the country’s third richest man worth $5.6 billion.\n\nHis daughter Katrina is the CEO and founder of KSR Ventures, which invests in sustainable businesses and social enterprises.\n\nIn 2019, KSR Ventures invested $600,000 in agri-tech startup NXTLVL Farms, an urban farming company that has since been rebranded as Urban Fresh and given Katrina a board seat.\n\nShe empowers local brands. In September 2022, Katrina spoke at the Forbes Global CEO Conference in Singapore about her advocacy championing Pinoy entrepreneurs.\n\nAt the age of 16, Katrina also started a music career using the screen name DJ Katsu.\n\nHer love for music, arts, and culture is evident in her being a producer of Wonderfruit Festival, a premium sustainable lifestyle festival held in Thailand.\n\nA neurocentric yoga devotee, she puts in two hours daily for the practice and films yoga videos for her YouTube channel.\n\nPHOTO: @katrinarazon on Instagram\n\nHer posts on Instagram show Katrina’s love for travel, nature, and wildlife.\n\nIn 2020, she climbed to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa at 19,341 feet above sea level.\n\nMore than just an adventure, her Kilimanjaro climb had the purpose of raising funds for nature conservation projects in Asia and Africa.\n\nMost recently, Katrina held a wildlife photo exhibit at the Awethentic Gallery in Singapore and donated the proceeds of the exhibit to the African Parks Network.\n\nANA MARIA ABOITIZ-DELGADO\n\nAna Maria Aboitiz-Delgado hails from the Aboitiz family, the country’s fifth richest with a combined net worth of

focus on digitalization, which proved to be much needed during the pandemic.\n\nShe led the team that introduced the first fully digital bank branch in the country, making Union Bank the first local bank in the country that has put in place a mobile banking app for the convenience of its clients.\n\nShe has also been a member of the Board Audit Committee of the Aboitiz Group of Companies since 2020.\n\nIn 2020, Ana was named Promising Young Banker in the Philippines by The Asian Banker.\n\nShe also received the Agora for Outstanding Achievement in Marketing Management from the Philippine

education.\n\nShe also established the Entrepreneurs School of Asia (now Thames International School) in the mid-2000s.\n\nShe returned to PAL in 2011, and, in 2019, she took the reins at the nations’s flag carrier.\n\nShe was appointed officer-in-charge, and was also the company’s executive vice president, treasurer, and chief administration officer.\n\nAt present, she concurrently serves as a director of PAL, Philippine National Bank, and Air Philippines Corp.

AND SISTERS SOFIA, PATRICIA, CRISTINA, AND MONICA\n\nBeatriz Susana, also known as Bea Jr., and Sofia Zobel-Elizalde are daughters of Jaime Zobel de Ayala, whose family ranks eight on the list, and $2.55 billion net worth.\n\nWhile their brothers Jaime Augusto and Fernando focus on the family’s business side of the conglomerate, the sisters are more known for their philanthropy.\n\nBeatriz Susana, also known as Bea Jr., left her life in Manila and moved to El Nido, Palawan in 2017 together with her daughter Paloma. The mother and daughter spearhead Kalye Artisano, a cultural hub putting local artists and businesses at the forefront. The mixed-use artisan center is found within the 325-hectare Lio Tourism Estate, the first eco-sustainable tourism development in the country.\n\nPHOTO: Joseph Pascual for Town and Country Philippines\n\nBefore this, Bea Zobel Jr. was busy promoting the cultural preservation of Bohol. It began with urging the local government to save the ancestral homes in Baclayon from demolition. The houses were instead converted into tourist lodgings, helping the municipality’s tourism income.\n\nBea continued creating eco-tourism programs for both Baclayon and Dauis, through the Bezo Recreational and Aquatic Services for Bohol (Braabo) and Dauis Renaissance Company, Inc.\n\nMeanwhile, Sofia Zobel-Elizalde used her passion for dancing to discover and hone Filipino talent, especially those who lack the financial capacity. After studying at Elmhurst School for Dance in England, Sofia went on to become a member of Ballet Philippines while getting her degree at Assumption College.\n\nPHOTO: LinkedIn\n\nAfter eight years with the ballet company, she retired to start her own dance school. She founded Steps Dance Studio in 1994, and eventually set up the Steps Dance Studio Scholarship Foundation, Inc. This allows Sofia to regularly take in scholars who pursue their love for dance and change their lives.\n\nIn addition, Sofia is also the vice president of the interactive children’s museum Museo Pambata.\n\nJust like Bea and Sofia, their sisters Patricia, Cristina, and Monica are likewise involved in different philanthropic activities through the Ayala Foundation and other organizations."
