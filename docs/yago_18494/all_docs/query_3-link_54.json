        "text": "INSTEAD OF COWERING IN THE SHADOWS OF HER ILLUSTRIOUS PARENTS, Camille Villar has woven her own story and fashioned a career that traverses both the public and private spheres.\n\nShe honed her business acumen by absorbing the lesson from her father, former Senate President, and successful entrepreneur, Manny Villar. She polished her own credentials by obtaining a Bachelor of Science in Management from Ateneo de Manila University and a Master’s Degree in Business Administration from the prestigious Institution de Estudios Superiores de la Eprese (IESE) Business School in Barcelona.\n\nAt the young age of 34, Camille has been managing all the retail business operations of Villar Group under AllValue, and has overseen the rapid growth and expansion of AllValue group of companies, over the last six years. Her vision and entrepreneurial spirit played a critical role in establishing its Mall and Retail Business.\n\nShe is the President and CEO of AllValue. She is also a Director of Vista Land & Lifescapes, Inc., Starmalls, Inc., and Golden Bria Holdings, Inc. She was President of AllHome until May 2019, Brittany Corporation from 2010 to 2013 and the Head of Corporate Communications for Vista Land from 2008 to 2010.\n\nShe successfully steered AllHome Corporation, which has recently undergone a successful listing in the Philippine Stock Exchange. Under her helm, AllHome has become the fastest growing full line home center in Philippines. It is a young company with aggressive expansion plan. It will grow to 70 stores across the Philippines by end 2020.\n\nJUST LIKE HER FATHER AND MOTHER, INCUMBENT SENATOR CYNTHIA VILLAR, she decided to navigate into the world of public service.\n\nShe ran and convincingly won as Representative of the lone district of Las Piñas City in 2019. And while she was introduced to the political world by accompanying her mother and father in political activities at a very young age.\n\nCamille Villar, has crafted her own identity as a public servant dedicated to improving education, especially for the youth and women, strengthening entrepreneurship, and supporting small and medium enterprises as effective tools in ending poverty.\n\nCamille loves to travel with her family, relaxing and checking out business trends globally. But she also enjoys simply staying at home playing with Tristan, her 4-year-old son, and watching documentaries, historical fiction, and news channels with her husband, Erwin Genuino."
