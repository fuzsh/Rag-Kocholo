Their names have been synonymous with real estate, business, and, lately, OFWs, but health is actually one of their top agenda when it comes to public service. And although they live complicated business and political lives, they make sure they keep their family life simple.\n\nText by Framelia V. Anonas\n\nPhoto by Jermaine So-Reyes\n\nFORMER Senate President Manny Villar and Rep.Cynthia Villar, known for sipag at tiyaga (industry and perseverance), entrepreneurship, business acumen, and wealth, are hands-on when it comes to providing healthcare to people.\n\nDuring his second term, for example, Sen. Manny Villar upgraded the Las Pi�as District Hospital (LPDH) by adding a new building to expand its services and provide better facilities to patients. To educate the youth on the dangers of drug abuse, he launched the �Sagip-Bukas� Drug Prevention Program in all Las Pi�as private and public schools. His record would show bills he filed that aimed to improve the Filipinos� quality of life through basic healthcare, among others.\n\nYet despite all his support in improving healthcare provision, Sen. Villar appears to be largely unsatisfied.\n\nWe need change\n\n�We need a radical change,� says Sen. Villar when asked on how he thinks of the country�s health sector. �We need to have more radical change than what we had in the past, particularly in the provision of healthcare to our people.�\n\nIf we don�t make change, healthcare provision in the country will continue to deteriorate, he states.\n\nSen. Villar categorizes the health problem in the country into two: requirements and budget. Sadly, for him, both are wanting. Requirements, he says, are all about human resources, medicine and supplies, and hospital equipment and facilities.\n\n�The problem on medicine and supplies is related to corruption, so we need to address this corruption in the system,� he says. Because these items can be easily hoarded they are prone to corruption. He recommends the use of generic medicines to �reduce the chances of corruption in medicine and medical supplies.�\n\nBigger budget for health\n\nSen. Villar recommends a bigger budget to increase the pay of government doctors and nurses. Bigger budget would also mean being able to afford more nurses. If the government has to hire more personnel, then it should be nurses, not clerks, he says. Moreover, budget increase would also mean better and more equipment for government health facilities.\n\n�For me, we have to totally revive the system,� he tells. He underscores the country�s need to have more creative approach, other than Philhealth, in addressing the health problem of the Philippines. He mentions the �radical approach� to healthcare being implemented in Thailand in which life-threatening diseases are being treated for free. Sen. Villar is convinced that this service should be the responsibility of the state.\n\n�When somebody needs chemotherapy for example, the state should be responsible in providing this to the patient,� he says. These services were available during the time of former First Lady Imelda Marcos, he recalls. �I want to revive this program in which all hospitals will be able to provide free treatments such as chemotherapy and dialysis. It is so saddening that presently, some of our loved ones die without even being given a second chance to live.�\n\nSupport to health facilities\n\nIf the man of the house thinks macro, his lady takes care of the details. Rep. Cynthia Villar, known as a champion for women, children and family, initiated programs aimed at advancing and protecting their welfare.\n\n�Since the beginning, Manny and I have been supporting Las Pi�as District Hospital, a facility operated by the Department of Health,� Rep. Villar reveals. �It used to be a very small hospital, so we helped develop it from scratch.�\n\nRep. Villar says that every six months, they introduce something new to the hospital to upgrade its services or develop its physical plant. �We act as oversight to the hospital, and we are very proud of what has become of it.� The 150-bed facility currently serves 4,000 to 5,000 patients daily.\n\nThe Villars recently put up elevators at LPDH. Prior to that, they dedicated a ward, then a laboratory, fire system, and water system, all in six-month spurts. Now they are planning to build a multi-purpose hall.\n\nIt also helps that she is the chair of the National Red Cross-Las Pi�as Chapter and that her office is right beside the hospital. This facilitates blood donation procedures. �We educate the people by telling them that if they donate blood, they can have free blood when they need it,� she says.\n\nMedical missions\n\nAccording to Rep. Villar, one of the priorities of the Senate Spouses Foundation Inc, of which she is the president, is organizing medical-dental missions. The foundation also gives priority to supporting the Philippine General Hospital, including the renovation of its 15 charity wards with 750 beds.\n\nLikewise, having been un-animously elected as the President of the Lady Legislators of the 13th Congress, she also spearheaded activities that support women and health. �We organize pap smear checks yearly in different parts of the country. We also visit breast cancer patients. We support the Breast Cancer Unit of the East Avenue Medical Center,� she elaborates.\n\nRep. Villar is also active in the Cervical Cancer Network. �We all know that cervical cancer is one of the top killers of Filipinas. Yet many of the poor women do not undergo pap smear. In fact, they are even afraid of it. They need to raise their awareness and be educated.�\n\nFor Rep.Villar, education is crucial to be able to have a healthy life. Government�s thrust of teaching people proper lifestyle is commendable, she says. �Education is really necessary in preventing diseases. It does not only save lives but also money,� she adds.\n\nKeeping the marriage happy\n\nDespite their high-profile status in the Senate and in the Lower House, the senator and the congresswoman have kept their marriage intact and unblemished. The couple has known each other for 40 years and has been married for 33 years. �It�s no longer the giggly romance type,� Rep. Villar admits. �When you�re older, being together happily is really a great effort. I think we�re staying together because we share memories and interests, and we support each other.�\n\nHaving the same interest is a crucial thing, Rep. Villar says. Sharing the same interest began when they were both business students, and continues up to now that they are both government officials.\n\n�We both love trying out new restaurants,� reveals Rep. Villar. �We also love to try different types of cooking and go to new places. Sometimes our children go with us if they�re not too busy.�\n\nFamily bonding\n\nFamily bonding is an important shared activity. Both of them say that they always make it a point to have family time together. �When they were younger, it was family tradition to have dinner time together,� recalls Sen. Villar. �Now that they are older, we make sure that everyone is around during Christmas no matter where they live or work.�\n\nRep. Villar adds, �This is the occasion when we really bond. We stick to simple schedule and simple activities, but the children love it and they always look forward to it. They show that they can stand time with us.�\n\nBecause of this pleasant experience, she advises families to have some sort of a tradition that their children will look forward to every year.\n\n�This Valentine�s Day, we might have simple dinner together,� says Rep. Villar. �We do live complicated business and political lives, but we make sure that we keep our family life simple.�"
