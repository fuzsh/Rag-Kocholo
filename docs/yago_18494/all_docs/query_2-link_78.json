One pack of instant noodles costs P5.00.\n\nSince pandesal is more expensive than instant noodles, the latter has become the poor man’s food of choice.\n\nYou know, one pandesal is good for one person only, while one pack of instant noodles, added with lots of water, can feed a clan. Besides, you really can’t enjoy pandesal without palaman or filling. Instant noodles, which come in a variety of flavors, are much tastier. Sopas pa lang, ulam na. The soup is already the main dish itself.\n\nBut by July, or the days after this month, the poor may no longer be able to afford the noodles.\n\nThat was the dire prediction of Ernesto N. Chua, head of the Malabon Long Life Trading Company, and chairman of the Philippine-Turkish Business Council.\n\nChua, along with Atty. Kristine Alcantara, senior project associate of the Trade Advisory Group of Citibank Center, came to Bulong Pulungan last Tuesday, June 10, to air the side of Turkey on the flour issue.\n\nAt the Bulong Pulungan, from left: Atty. Kristine Alcantara, Ernesto Chua, and Deedee Siytangco, Bulong moderator.\n\nWheat Woes\n\nThe Philippines does not grow wheat, so we import wheat flour, then local millers process the product, and sell them to bakeries and other manufacturers who turn the flour into bread and other flour-based products like pastries, cookies, noodles, lumpia wrappers.\n\nToday, there are two groups of local flour millers fighting over the importation of wheat flour.\n\nAt one side is the Philippine Association of Flour Millers (PAFMIL), composed of 14 milling companies importing their flour mostly from the United States.\n\nIn 2004, a group of 11 milling companies started to import flour from Turkey, one of the top 10 wheat producers of the world.\n\nChua’s Malabon Long Life is one of the 11 companies.\n\nThe flour from the U.S. costs more than the flour from Turkey. Thus the local millers patronizing the U.S. product reportedly saw Turkish flour as a threat, since naturally, consumers—bakers, noodle manufacturers– prefer reduced cost of the flour they use for their products.\n\nChua gave Bulong media a paper from local millers who have formed the Turkish Flour Yeast and Ingredients Promotion Group (TFYI) which said “certain interest groups have taken steps to derail the growing relationship between the Turkish flour industry with the local one.”\n\nIndeed, local newspapers have been publishing news stories about allegations that Turkish flour is of poor quality, and that Turkey is “dumping” its unwanted flour in the Philippines.\n\nDefining Dumping\n\nIn the Bulong forum, Atty. Alcantara first tackled the issue about the quality of Turkish flour. She presented a video showing Turkey has well perfected wheat flour production since the country has been in the business since 12,000 years ago.\n\nAlcantara also enumerated reasons Turkish flour costs lower than U.S. flour: low raw material cost, low freight rates, and low overhead.\n\nChua defended Turkish flour against the “dumping” allegations, pointing to the TFYI paper which presented a World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement on the definition of a “dumped” product:\n\n“A product introduced into the commerce of another country at less its normal value, if the export price of the product exported from one country to another is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary course of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption on the exporting country.”\n\nChua said the Turkish flour exported to the Philippines may not be considered of less its normal value.\n\nHe explained there are two kinds of flour: the hard flour used for bread, and the soft flour used for noodles, biscuits, pastries, and lumpia wrappers.\n\nBread is the staple food in Turkey– its population consumes the hard bread the county produces. So what Turkey exports is its soft flour. The product, Chua pointed out, has been exported to over 120 nations including developed countries like Japan and South Korea.\n\n“If our flour is of bad quality, it wouldn’t have been patronized by such countries,” Chua pointed out.\n\nBut alas, the negative publicity about Turkish flour has led to tariff sanctions about importation of the product.\n\nPAFMIL, the group of millers importing their flour mostly from the U.S.—and selling the product at a cost higher cost than the Turkish flour—filed an “anti-dumping” case against Turkish Origin Wheat Flour on March 14, 2013.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture started investigation of the allegations and eventually imposed preliminary duty against the Turkish flour.\n\nChua and his group lament the tax imposition because to be able to pay the tax, the importers will be forced to increase the cost of the wheat flour they buy from Turkey.\n\nTo be affected are small bakeries, and other small and medium businesses especially in the provinces, who have opted for the cheaper Turkish flour.\n\n“But the ones who will ultimately suffer are the poor,” he said. “The cost of instant noodles which uses Turkish soft flour will rise, and the poor may not be able to afford the one food item they have turned to—since pandesal or other bread using hard flour has become expensive for them.”\n\nWho’s Killing Who?\n\nChua said the local millers using the U.S. flour worry that the lower priced Turkish price might kill the flour milling industry and workers employed by the industry would lose their job.\n\n“But I hope the government will take into consideration that the local milling industry is not labor intensive,” he said, “because the milling process is done mostly through machines.”\n\nHe added, “The industry employs only a little over 1,000 persons. Compare that number to the hundreds of thousands poor people who will be affected (by the tax imposition and the consequent rise of the commodity’s price),” Chua said.\n\nHe said that since they’ve been selling their flour at a high cost, the local millers have already been enjoying big profit.\n\n“They can find means to cushion what they fear as threat of the Turkish flour,” he added.\n\nLevelling the Playing Field\n\nChua also pointed out the positive effect of the competition the Turkish flour has brought upon the industry.\n\n“It’s levelling the playing field,” he said. “Competition will keep all of us on our toes—to give our market better quality products and more efficient service.”\n\nHe cited as an example the fast-food industry: “Before, when McDonald’s was the only burger restaurant in the Philippines, it could command prices so high only the well-off could afford their burgers. With the entrance of Jollibee and other fast-food restaurants, now, to stay competitive, McDonald’s has been offering burgers everyone can afford.”\n\nThe Department of Agriculture announced the anti-dumping duties is “provisional” and takes effect for one month in June—while the Tariff Commission, in the meantime, investigates the dumping allegations by the local flour millers.\n\nThose importing Turkish flour are already paying a regular import tax. With the DA ruling, they will have to shell out more– 21.79 percent will be imposed on hard flour used for bread, 39.26 percent on biscuit flour, and 35.21 percent in soft flour.\n\nIf the tax imposition continues, importers of Turkish flour may reduce volume of their imports, or worse, no longer patronize the product and look for other sources of flour.\n\nThe Philippines imported 144,000 metric tons of Turkish flour last year. Reports say importation of Turkish flour may drop to 50 percent by July.\n\nChua said the price of flour-based commodities may then soar to as much as 20 percent. That’s plus 40 centavos to your P2.00 pandesal, or a total of P2.40 apiece. Or if that’s too high a cost for consumers, bakeshops may retain the usual price—but reduce the size of your pandesal.\n\nAs for noodles, the 20 percent markup means plus P1.00 to the P5.00-pack.\n\nWith no regular income, or no income at all, the poor then may have to beg, steal, or borrow to have food on the table—or forget about eating.\n\nThen, what will be put to a test is this age-old tenet: that man does not live by bread—or noodles– alone.\n\nMILESTONES\n\nFLOWERS for JOANNE and JULLIE\n\nBulong Pulungan honored Joanne Ramirez,Philippine Star section editor/columnist and editor-in-chief of PeopleAsia Magazine, who received the prestigious Rotary Club of Manila Tourism Awards 2014, Lifestyle Tourism category.\n\nBulong also honored Jullie Yap Daza of Manila Bulletin who celebrates her birthday this June 15.\n\nDuring floral presentation, from left: Frank Evaristo, president of Rotary Manila; Chanelle Garvey, Hotel Sofitel director of Sales and Marketing; Joanne Rae Ramirez; Adam Laker, Sofitel general manager; Jullie Yap Daza, and Deedee Siytangco.\n\n— Cynthia U. Santiago Photos by Edmundo L. Santiago\n\nC!\n\nJune 4, 2014\n\nWATER, WATER EVERYWHERE…\n\nBut Not a Drop To Drink\n\nFOUR centuries ago, in 1798, the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote the long poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner from where we get the popular quote, Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink.\n\nThe Rime is about a sailor whose ship encounters a storm. An albatross appears and guides the ship to a safer part of the ocean. Instead of being grateful, the sailor shoots the bird. Angered, the spirits blow the ship into uncharted waters. In the end, as his punishment, the sailor suffers a fate worse than death: with the dead bird on his neck, he lives to wander around, telling his story to anyone who would care to listen to him.\n\nA Dam Story\n\nFast forward to 2014. At the Bulong Pulungan media forum at Hotel Sofitel on Tuesday, June 3, Atty. Jesus Santos (below, right), head of the National Association of Lawyers for Justice and Peace (NALJP), with Bulacan Fourth District Representative Linabelle Ruth Villarica, told the media a story parallel to The Rime.\n\nThe setting is not an ocean, but a mountain teeming with trees—the best of the best Philippine trees—narra, yakal, ipil, name it, this mountain has it.\n\nThe trees absorb the water from the rain so the water does not flow down the river at the foot of the mountain, the river does not overflow, and the people living around it do not suffer flood. Yes, the trees are like the albatross in The Rime, saving the people from disaster.\n\nBecause the rains bring so much water, the government decides to build a dam to collect the water and purify it, so that everyone even as far as Metro Manila enjoys plenty of water to drink.\n\nBut instead of being grateful, some people cut down the trees. Yes, like the sailor in The Rime kills the albatross.\n\nWill these bad people get punished? Like the sailor in The Rime?\n\nA Chilling Prophecy\n\nAtty. Santos told the Bulong forum that nobody’s getting punished yet.\n\nBut, he declared a chilling prophecy: everyone will soon suffer as a result of the ingratitude of the bad people.\n\nHe said the government had banned illegal logging on the mountain. But the thousands of logs they cut were left on the mountain. So, Santos said, one day when a heavy, heavy Ondoy-type storm comes, the water will push the logs down the valley, break the dam, and the water in it will flood not just the valley but all the towns and cities on its path.\n\nAnd yes, like in The Rime, we shall have water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink. And we shall see dead people around us—that is, if we are not yet dead. But if we live, we might just have heavy logs, if not hanging on our neck, pounding our being with intolerable guilt. Yes, like the Rime mariner bears the dead albatross. Like him, we shall forever tell our story. But will anyone listen?\n\nAtty. Santos, already in his 80s, passionately, on the verge of tears, expressed an appeal to media– he said his last wish before he dies– to help spread his story because unlike The Rime, which is fiction, his story is true and so disturbing.\n\n“I have documents to prove it,” Santos said, pointing to a big plastic box containing folders with papers, already yellow, about his advocacy to save the Angat Dam.\n\nBack to the Past\n\nLocated in Barangay San Lorenzo, Norzagaray, Bulacan, the Angat Dam, 131 meters high, collects the water overflowing from the Angat River. The water has been used to irrigate farm land in Bulacan and Pampanga, and the dam supplies 90 percent of drinking water as far as Metropolitan Manila.\n\nSantos said he has embarked on an intensive campaign to guard the mountains surrounding the Angat Dam from illegal loggers, way back from the time of President Ferdinand Marcos and down to the administration of Presidents succeeding him.\n\nSantos added that to their credit, the Presidents had ordered to ban illegal logging in the Angat Dam area, but the bad loggers somehow always find a way to continue their evil ways.\n\nThe loggers cut down the trees—some 6,000 as of last counting– to sell the logs which allegedly have been used as electric posts.\n\nSince the illegal logging could not be contained, the provinces around the Angat Dam had suffered floods.\n\nSantos said one unforgettable disaster was caused by Super Typhoon Kading on October 26, 1978. To prevent overflow of rain water from the Angat Dam, the National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR) opened the floodgates of the dam, allegedly without informing the residents around the dam beforehand. The water inundated several towns in Bulacan, and, Santos said, the disaster left at its wake 300 persons dead plus damage to property worth millions of pesos.\n\nSantos said he knows about the devastation so well because he served as lawyer for the victims’ families who filed a civil suit against NAPOCOR.\n\nAtty. Jesus Santos receiving guest certificate from Jullie Yap Daza (extreme left) with fellow Bulong members Domini Torrevillas and Frank Evaristo.\n\nBack to the Present\n\nSantos said that today, what’s going on at the Angat Dam area is what folks call carabao logging. He explained that apparently to avoid detection, illegal loggers are using carabaos to haul the logs down the Papaya River and toward Nueva Ecija where the bad businessmen collect them for sale.\n\nSo, since the logging business is still thriving, will Santos’s horrible prophecy come true?\n\nNot if Rep.Linabelle Ruth Villarica has her way.\n\nBack to the Future\n\nAt the Bulong Pulungan last Tuesday, Rep. Villarica announced that she has taken the rehabilitation of the Angat Dam as her major advocacy.\n\nRep. Villarica said she heads the Central Luzon block in the House of Representatives and the group’s top priority is to investigate the illegal logging practices around the Angat Dam.\n\nVillarica said the first step she will take is to write President Benigno Aquino III to bring to his attention the Angat Dam issue. She said along with her co-members in the Central Luzon block, she will relentlessly pursue the probe of illegal logging at the place.\n\nCritiques say The Rime of the Ancient Mariner points out man’s cruelty to Nature, and Nature’s inevitable grudging reaction to such violation.\n\nIn the poem, the wandering sailor tells his story to a man on his way to a wedding. The poem narrates the wedding guest goes home and wakes up the next morning a sadder but wiser man.\n\nIf that’s what you feel after reading this story, well, let’s drink—water—to that!\n\nText by CYNTHIA U. SANTIAGO Photos by EDMUNDO L. SANTIAGO\n\n-30-\n\nC!\n\nMay 21, 2014\n\nPAHIYAS! HOW TO MAKE A FIESTA MORE FUN!\n\nPAHIYAS comes from the Filipino word hiyas meaning jewel. And pahiyas means precious offering.\n\nFarming is such a tedious job, and disasters like droughts or typhoons so wreck the crops that the farmers’ ultimate recourse is to pray to God, through the intercession of the town’s patron saint, for protection against calamities, and promise a thanksgiving fiesta to honor God and their patron saint with offerings of their harvest.\n\nIn Lucban, Quezon, the fiesta, called Pahiyas, happens every May 15, the birthday of the town’s patron saint, San Isidro. San Isidro, a Spanish farmer, was said to be so pious, he prayed while angels ploughed the fields for him. A series of miracles attributed to his intercession led to his canonization as a Catholic saint.\n\nAn image of San Isidro flanked by rice wafers called kiping, in rainbow colors, and formed into chandeliers called aranya (above), or simply strung together into buntings (below).\n\nA Filipino fiesta, especially during summer time, can be daunting. The climate is hot and humid, and there’s heavy traffic because of the thick crowd of revelers.\n\nBut it’s actually more fun in the Philippines because of our fiestas. And you never really have enjoyed life until you’ve joined a fiesta, like the Pahiyas.\n\nThe good news is, there are 10 ways to make the Pahiyas more fun!\n\nPay it forward. That’s a no-brainer, but it’s so true. A friend, Violet Imperial, who owns the Nature Awareness and Conservation Inc., cared to include my husband Ed and me in Nature’s Pahiyas group tour — for free– last May 15.\n\nWe thought of paying the blessing forward by inviting our friends Joel and Bella Estrella to come along.\n\nThat really made the Pahiyas more fun.\n\nPicture, picture, from left: Marilen Tagal, Ana Alvarez, Bella Estrella,Violet Imperial, and me.\n\n2. Level up. To appreciate places you visit, it’s best to know their historical background.The Pahiyas package tour included a brief visit to the Underground Cemetery of Nagcarlan, Laguna, which was on the way to Lucban, Quezon.\n\nIf you’d been to the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas, you’d think you’re back there because the Nagcarlan cemetery grounds are enclosed by a wall with an arched gate very much like the “hump” of the Alamo wall—an influence of Spanish architecture, bringing you back to those years of Spanish colonization of various territories, America, Mexico, and the Philippines, among them.\n\nLet me just digress a little to share what I’d learned when my eldest brother Rolly and his wife Corette treated us to a tour of the Alamo in 2013.\n\nA symbol of patriotism, the Alamo was once a house for Spanish missionaries aiming to convert Indian tribes in San Antonio to Catholicism, very much like the mission of Spanish friars during the 300-year Spanish colonization of the Philippines.\n\nIn time, the Alamo convento was turned into a military garrison, which saw a number of battles, most famous of which was the 1836 Battle of the Alamo, where some 600 Texians, among them prominent names such as David Crockett, James Bowie, and William Barret Travis, died defending the Alamo against charging Mexican soldiers under the leadership of Mexican president Antonio López de Santa Anna who was out to establish Texas as a Mexican territory.\n\nLater, Texian Governor Sam Houston led a military offensive where Santa Anna was captured, and thus freed Texas, amid the victorious cries of “Remember the Alamo!”\n\nAt the Alamo, from left: Ed, me, my sister-in-law Corette, and my brother Rolly.\n\nLike the Alamo, the Nagcarlan Underground Cemetery is a historical landmark as it played a role in the Philippines’ struggle for freedom. The underground crypt served as a hiding place of patriots fighting against the Spaniards during the Revolution of 1896 and the Americans during the Filipino-American War. The underground cemetery also served as a safehouse for guerrillas fighting the Japanese during World War II.\n\nWe learned about the cemetery’s historical background from its tour guide, Emmanuel Sumague (above) whose first name, take note, means “God is with us.” And so at the cemetery’s chapel, we talked to God, asking Him to bless freedom fighters – which makes our tour fun, on a more profound level.\n\nAnd of course, we took pictures. Using Ed’s camera, I took a picture of him with Jojo Estrella (above, right).\n\nBella stops to smell the flowers. But these are Santans, which are so beautiful but have no fragrance. Ahh, life can sometimes be like that.\n\n3. Shop! Shop! The Pahiyas package also included shopping spree at Liliw, Laguna, popular for sturdy, fashionable shoes and slippers that cost half the price or much lower than the prices in Metro Manila department stores.\n\nI was so happy to buy an espadrille-denim one-inch heeled sandal for only P250. Something like it costs P699 in SM! I also got a black slipper for only P100. Costs P200-400 in SM.\n\nPark where you can avoid the traffic or the crowd. On Violet’s instructions, we parked outside the tail end of the town of Majayjay, a couple of meters before the entrance to the town of Lucban and into the Pahiyas village. It’s a long walk to the village, but at the end of the day, you’ll be thankful that you were so far away from the crowd—for then you were on this clear, wide road back to Majayjay, that gave you an easy escape back to Manila.\n\n5.Travel light. Earlier, Violet texted us to wear light clothes, bring a hat, water, extra shirt, and umbrella for it might suddenly rain.But you will be so busy taking pictures and shopping you won’t have time to change. I brought along a mini towel, which I asked Bella to put between my sweat-soaked blouse and my back. I didn’t bring an umbrella because I knew it wouldn’t rain. It didn’t. I didn’t bring a hat either… which must be providential, because I had an exciting experience about Pahiyas hats– but I am going ahead of my story.\n\n5. Be on tourist mode. No brainer, either. But if you don’t have the tourist mindset, it’s so easy to succumb to the temptation to complain about the long walk. When you’re in tourist mode, however, you only marvel at all the things there are to marvel at.\n\nWith Violet leading, Jojo and Belle, Ed and I simply marvelled at this street, flanked by houses with breathtaking murals of Lucban’s bountiful harvests.\n\nHere are pictures I took…\n\nIn earlier fiestas, the harvests were simply displayed on the façade of the houses to be blessed by the parish priest during the afternoon procession to honor the town’s patron saint. But in time the practice has become a competition, bringing out the Lucban folks’ amazing creativity. Above, this year’s grand prize winner which bagged P100,000.\n\nGirls with vegetable harvests posing for tourists.\n\nPeacock mosaic made out of coconut husks mounted on palm leaves.\n\nAll organic veggies you desire!\n\nHere are more, from Ed’s camera…\n\nA much better picture of the rice wafers fashioned into aranyas or chandeliers, and sunflowers, with a couple watching the festivities from their window.\n\nTomatoes, coconuts, bananas, and string beans used as hair for fiesta masks.\n\nA fiesta is never fun without games such as the Palo Sebo, where macho men show off their prowess in climbing bamboo poles greased with coconut oil.\n\nMommy and kids prefer to make a difference by decorating their house with Bird of Paradise flowers.\n\n7. Enjoy Lucban hospitality. Apparently following the Christian tenet that whatever you give will come back to you a hundredfold, every household cleans house, even makes major repairs, and cooks food enough to feed everyone– friends or strangers– who will enter their house on fiesta day. Yes, as they believe that the more they give, the more they will receive—especially in the form of bountiful harvests. Some, however, go as far as incur debts to follow tradition, thus the practice has been criticized. But that’s another story.\n\nNow, Violet told us we should have our picture taken by the window of a house. With all the decorations framing the window, it would be such a fantastic picture, she gushed.\n\nSo we went to this house whose residents—a grandma, a mother, and her daughter– warmly welcomed us, allowed us to go upstairs, to their window, to have this beautiful photo taken by Violet from down the street.\n\nThis, definitely, was more fun than just taking pictures of the houses.\n\n8. Have a piece of the Lucban Longaniza. Our hosts did not just allow us to have our picture taken from their window, they even invited us to partake of their handa—the buffet they prepared for visitors, which included the famous Lucban longaniza (sausage).\n\nBella and I are PHTVs (Praying Hard to be Vegetarians), but to be, well, polite, we took a piece each of the sausage. I then understood why God had not yet answered our prayer. He probably just wanted us first to have a piece each of the mouthwatering Lucban longaniza.\n\nLucban is also famous for its Pancit Habhab—a special noodle dish seasoned with vinegar sauce, and whose claim to fame is how it is eaten—the way farmers in the field, for lack of plates and spoons, habhab or lap up the noodles from banana leaves.\n\nTourists imitate the farmers’ way of eating Pancit Habhab.\n\n9. Buy and exchange hats. I was so grateful for our hosts’ hospitality, I wanted to give a tip to their daughter. But, I was told, “Silly, you don’t give tips here.”\n\nBut then I noticed the family was selling hats, so to express my appreciation, I bought a white hat with polka-dotted ribbon.\n\nThat made me feel good, and so made the Pahiyas more fun.\n\nLater, however, in another house, I saw a fuchsia mat hat which was what I really wanted to have. I asked the girl minding the displays if I could exchange my white hat with the fuchsia hat. The white hat cost P80. But I told her I’d give it to her at P50. I knew I’d lose P30 – but never mind, I considered it as my “tip” for our generous hosts.\n\nAnyway, the fuchsia hat cost P75. If the girl agreed to take my P50-white hat, then I would shell out only P25 for the fuchsia hat. She consulted her boss– a pretty lady, who took my white hat, tried it on, grinned from ear to ear, then, to my amazement, and delight, said, “Okay, deal!”\n\nThat’s one great way the Pahiyas was much, much more fun!\n\n10. Don’t forget your GPS. No, not the Geographical Positioning System, the techie gadget that has become so indispensable for drivers in the United States. In the Philippines, our GPS is called Kuya, the Filipino term for elder brother. There are a lot of Kuyas– men on the streets who, even it’s not fiesta time, generously give you directions to where you want to go. Bella and I enjoyed the spontaneous display of this Kuya generosity—both among the residents and the visitors– when somewhere along the way we got separated from Jojo and Ed, and eventually, from Violet.\n\nAt first, we didn’t mind losing our guide, because we were already at the church grounds, and the Pahiyas procession was about to start.\n\nWe saw members of the Camera Club of the Philippines standing on a strategic elevated platform and, in Pahiyas hospitality mode, kindly allowed us to go up the platform so that like them, we could take good pictures of the procession.\n\nThen, Violet texted us to get to our van as it was time to go back to Manila. That’s when we realized we were clueless on how to go back to our meeting place.\n\nSo we consulted the local GPS — about a dozen Kuyas–an old man, a policeman, a couple of barangay officials, a man with a walkie talkie, plus local versions of Tom and Tammie, Dick and Jane, and Harry and Harriet– and got a dozen different ways to get to our meeting place, which, no matter how generously described to us in detail, didn’t get us to where we wanted to go.\n\nBut thanks to the confusion, every street we turned to, we got glimpses of the long procession. I took a lot of photos but they didn’t turn out as sharp and bright as the pictures below, taken by Ed who must had been just a couple of blocks away from us…\n\nAfter watching the parade, we again tried to find our way back to our van, to no avail. Violet texted that we should follow signs going to Majayjay. But alas, the signs, apparently bumped out of place by the crowd, pointed either to the north or to the south.\n\nIn Boracay, the premier resort down south, there is a huge tent of the Department of Tourism apparently to seek and save the lost, but try as we did, we didn’t see any such salvation grace in Lucban. How I wished I had the direct line of Secretary Ramon Jimenez!\n\nSo, Bella and I finally resorted to what we should have done in the first place– consult the best GPS ever, God who knows Earth like the palm of His hand.\n\nBella and I sighed our prayers. And, true enough, where two are gathered in prayer, there God is in their midst… And voila! two members of our tour group just suddenly appeared before us, and led us to our meeting place.\n\nThe bountiful harvests, the burst of colors, the people’s creativity, hospitality, and generosity, the delicacies, our answered prayer – they all made the Pahiyas tour not only fun, but fantastically faith fortifying. Like any feast honoring God should really be.\n\nTrivia: On our way back to Manila, we inched our way through heavy traffic as other towns were also holding their own processions to thank God for their harvests and intercede for more.\n\nThen, we chanced upon this jeepney with more passengers than it should be loading. Suddenly, the tourist in Ed went pfft, Ed, the press photographer, emerged, and by force of habit, clicked his camera, like a true blue Fourth Estate watchdog does. As if on cue, I also just about forgot I was tourist, as automatically, I already began composing a caption for the picture. Something like… For better transportation provisions, who would these men gonna call: the Secretary or the Saint for Transportation—or both?\n\nText by CYNTHIA U. SANTIAGO"
