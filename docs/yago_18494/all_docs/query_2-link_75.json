Camille Villar, DPWH Sec. Mark Villar, Pasay City Mayor Imelda Calixto-Rubiano, Department of Trade and Industry Sec.

Danny Ricohermoso, executive vice president of Integrated Seafarers of the Philippines, Inc.\n\nOFWs turned successful entrepreneurs will also have its own segment with Gene Gutierrez, owner of Big Ben’s Gourmet and Big Ben’s Kitchen; Bianca Tolentino, owner of Cofficina Café + Co-work; and Princess San Diego, founder of What’s Your Flan.\n\nDialogue with government agencies will also happen with Atty.
