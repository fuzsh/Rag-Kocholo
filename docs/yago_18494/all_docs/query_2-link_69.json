        "text": "U.S. Background\n\nThe initial objections to a political dynasty stemmed from a general dissatisfaction with the British monarchy. The American founding fathers were against the abusive King George III who over-taxed the colonies to fund his lavish lifestyle. Many loathed the concept of “blue blood” divine rights and entitlements and believed that positions of leadership are derived from the people and should be used to serve them.\n\nHence Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of their 1789 Constitution provides that “No title of nobility shall be granted by the United States.” A counterpart provision is found in Article VI, Section 31 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution.\n\nYet, Americans do not generally frown upon dynasties. In fact they treat them as political royalty whose heirs are expected to preserve the family honor and pursue long-term development-oriented strategies. Dynasties work in the U.S. because open competition and institutional checks and balances ensure that no group can dominate the political conversation.\n\nThe first dynasty started with John Adams who was elected the second President of the United States while his son, John Quincy Adams, was the 6th. Over the years, the more prominent families that evolved into strong political brands were the Roosevelts, the Kennedys, the Bushes, and, if the 2016 presidential elections went the other way, the Clintons. Not as well-known are the Bayards of Delaware (six generations of U.S. senators) and the Breckinridges of Kentucky (a vice president, two senators, and six representatives.)\n\nPhilippine Setting\n\nTo confront our feudal past and combat patronage politics, the framers of the 1987 Philippine Constitution introduced a new Article II, Section 26: The State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities for public service, and prohibit political dynasties as may be defined by law.\n\nThere have been various attempts in the last 30 years to enable this constitutional prohibition. Unfortunately, these efforts have been in vain. The executive and legislative branches of government have not been able to muster the political will to go against a vainglorious self- interest to pass a defining law that would serve the national interest. It is only in the Sangguniang Kabataan (youth council) where a prohibition exists. Section 10 of R.A. No. 10742 forbids individuals from seeking a youth council position if related within the second civil degree of consanguinity or affinity to any incumbent elected national official or to any incumbent elected regional, provincial, city, municipal or barangay official in the same locality.\n\nIn his 2015 State of the Nation address, President Benigno Aquino III became the only sitting chief executive to urge the passage of an all-encompassing anti-political dynasty law. That call also fell on congressional deaf ears.\n\nThat political clans are lording it over the country’s 81 provinces, 146 cities and 243 Congressional districts is a political given. Noted political scientist Richard Heydarian estimates that between 70 percent and 90 percent of elected offices are now controlled by dynastic families.\n\nTheir influence has permeated into the party list system which was originally envisioned to provide a Congressional voice for the marginalized and underrepresented sectors of society. Of the 134 party-list groups that participated in the May 2019 midterm elections, at least 62 had ties to influential families. Of the 270 party-list groups that filed their Certificates of Candidacy for the May 2022 elections, a majority is controlled by political dynasties.\n\nClan influence is also seeping through the usually independent Senate. Judging by the latest survey results for the senatorial hopefuls in the upcoming May 2022 elections, there is a high probability that eight out of the 24 senators will be related parties- either parent/child (Binays and Villars) or sibling/sibling (Cayetanos and Ejercito/Estrada). If we count the almost father/son relationship of President Duterte and Senator Bong Go, that raises the number to 10. If Sarah Duterte is elected Vice President, she would be backed by these two senators. And if Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. wins the presidency, he would have a Senate ally in elder sister Imee Marcos. The cartelized executive and legislative branches of government will be “an all in a few families” affair."
