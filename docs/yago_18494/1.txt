Ultra bilyonaryo Manny Villar shared a touching message for his “dearest” wife, Senator Cynthia Villar, to mark the 48th year of their marriage.

The chairman of Vista Land & Lifescapes, Inc. said he could not wish for a better partner in life, may it be in politics or business.

“We were both 25 when we exchanged “I do’s”, 48 years later, we have a love that has stood the test of time, and a family that I could not be more proud of,” Villar wrote in the caption of his Instagram post, which featured a recent photo of the couple.

“Through thick and thin we’ve been partners, we’ve had each other’s back, and leaned on each other as a pillar of strength and a source of joy,” he added. “Happy anniversary, dearest Cynthia!”
