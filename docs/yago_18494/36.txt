September 13 was so special for them.

Manny Villar shared on Instagram a post with his wife Cynthia, President Bongbong Marcos and First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos.

It was a double celebration for the two couples because September 13 was the day Manny and Cynthia got married 47 years ago while Bongbong turned 65.

The four looked so happy to be all together on the special day.
