Author(s): Robert Silverberg

With a new introduction by author Robert Silverberg, and the first-ever map of Borthan, this classic sci-fi novel A Time of Changes, out of print since 1992, will delight fans of dystopian fiction

In the far future, Earth is a worn-out backwater and humanity is spread across the galaxy on worlds that began as colonies, but now feel like home, each with its own long history of a thousand years or more, and each with its own unique culture. One of the strangest is on Borthan, where the founding settlers established the Covenant, which teaches that the self is to be despised, and forbids anyone to reveal his innermost thoughts or feelings to another. On Borthan, the filthiest obscenities imaginable are the words "I" and "me."

For the heinous crime of "self-baring," apostates have always paid with exile or death, but after his eyes are opened by a visitor from Earth, Kinnall Darival, prince of Salla, risks everything to teach his people the real meaning of being human.

Review(s):

“Robert Silverberg's versatile, skeptical intelligence controls a lavish and splendid imagination. A Time of Changes is a canny fable of freedom and the ecstatic communion of souls.” —Ursula K. Le Guin

“No matter if Silverberg is dealing with material that is practically straight fiction, or going way into the future . . . his is the hand of a master of his craft and imagination.” —Los Angeles Times on A Time of Changes
