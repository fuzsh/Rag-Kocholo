Paperback: 7¾" x 5". Condition: Very Good: Light signs of wear. Cover Art: David Jackson (illustrator). 1986 Edition. © 1971: A stand-alone novel by Robert Silverberg. 1st printing of 1986 edition. Gollancz Classic SF Series #3:- Synopsis: This is the autobiography of Kinnall Darival, a prince of the province of Salla on the planet Borthan. The writing of such a book is an act of heresy for in the repressed society of Borthan the very words 'I' and 'me' are obscenities and the concept of 'autobiography' is unthinkable. For most of his life Kinnall holds as closely as anyone to society's moral code. But, forced into exile when his brother becomes ruler of Salla, he is introduced by a visiting Earthman to an idea, and a means of putting it into practice, which challenge his most basic beliefs. Fool or messiah, he sets a course which endangers not only himself but the lives of everyone close to him:- Review(s): "In 'A Time Of Changes' Robert Silverberg paints a marvellously rich and convincing portrait of the world of Borthan, it's people and its civilisation" / "A tremendous tour de force" - Manchester Evening News / "Robert Silverberg is one of the most imaginative and versatile writers ever to have been involved with sf" - Encyclopedia Of Science Fiction / "Robert Silverberg is doing more to bring science fiction back into the mainstream of literature than anyone" - Analog / "Enthralling and sensitive. Highly recommended" - TLS:- (original cost £2.95). Seller Inventory # 23.088.00003
