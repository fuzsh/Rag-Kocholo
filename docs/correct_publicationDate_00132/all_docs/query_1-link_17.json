Could you tell me if his earlier books are better?\n\nTry his Majipoor books started in the late '70s, one of the best science fantasy series I've come across. Also stories like Dying Inside, Nightwings, Downward To The Earth and Book Of Skulls are worth investigating.\n\nNever read Face Of The Waters, so I can't commet on that one.\n\nI finished 'The Time Hoppers'. No great revelations later. I thought he could have developed some ideas further.\n\nA question: The other Silverberg book I picked up was 'The Majipoor Chronicles' (of the Lord Valentine trilogy which several people here have now recommended including GOLLUM just above) but it is the second book of the trilogy. It seems to be a stand alone novel; I think the prologue to the book is actually the events of the first book. Should I read it, or wait and read 'Lord Valentine's Castle' first?\n\nI finished 'The Time Hoppers'. No great revelations later.

Should I read it, or wait and read 'Lord Valentine's Castle' first?\n\nYou really should wait.\n\nI have had the same problem. I have always seen the second book but havent been able to find the first book. Which is why i havent read the series yet.\n\nPlus its not a good idea to read a prologue that tells the story of the first book. Specially not when its his most famous series.\n\nYou really should wait.\n\nI have had the same problem. I have always seen the second book but havent been able to find the first book.

Specially not when its his most famous series.\n\nActually just to clarify, this book is mainly a series of short stories that connects one of the charatcers from Lord Valentine's castle BUT does little to progress the story of the main charatcer from Book 1. Therefore you can actually in this case read that book before getting Lord Valentine.\n\nYou will also find in the majipoor books that not all are direct sequels to previous books as they jump around 1,000 years at a time to different Lords in charge of the city.\n\nHere's a comment on Book 2 from the silverberg website:\n\nThis the second book in the series begun with Lord Valentine's Castle. This is a collection of stories set on Majipoor connected by short interludes with Hissune (one of the characters from Book 1). As the copyright page says: Portions of this book have appeared in somewhat different form in Omni, Fantasy & Science Fiction, and Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine. It adds some interesting details to the history and geography of the big planet, but does not really further the story of Valentine.\n\nCheers...."
