        "text": "November 15, 2016\n\nA Time for Changes by Robert Silverberg is difficult to rate and even more difficult to review. I can begin by saying that I liked it.\n\nSilverberg tells a good story, he’s a fine writer and his narration draws the reader in. Set in the distant future, on a planet inhabited by humans for thousands of years, but still with the knowledge of far off earth as an anachronistic home, we follow the life of Kenal, second son of a king in a strictly primogeniture hierarchy. The world is also strictly in the grips of a theocratic culture called the Covenant where it is profane, vulgar and even blasphemous to use “I”, “me”, or “myself” and these words are synonymous with the vilified concepts of “self bearing”.\n\nHere is where Silverberg gets you, the psychological, sociological setting where people are so ingrained in the idea that they cannot express individuality that the words, “I love you” are criminal. Kenal discovers a drug (a lot like cocaine – or ecstasy), scratched from a feral jungle people in the southern continent (hmmmm) that he becomes addicted to and which ruins his life among this society.\n\nPublished in 1972, and winner of the Nebula Award that year, Silverberg creates a tension where the common ideas of sharing and love have been turned upside down and our protagonist struggles with whether he is a drug fiend or a revolutionary cultural messiah.\n\nFebruary 9, 2017\n\nThis is a surprisingly different read.\n\nAt the very first, I thought it was going to be an alien-Odyssey, a SF treatment of the greek legend, with just a hint of something truly interesting, culturally, in that the entire race, or nearly the entire race, is devoted to self-abnegation.\n\nImagine, then, instead of relying on the world-building adventure that it began with, it turned into a very distinctive novel of the drug culture that reflects 1971 perfectly, changing Ulysses into Timothy Leary, and instead of being a Lotus Eater, he's become an LSD-like proponent of a drug that allows limited telepathy.\n\nAnd then the cultural cool-bit now comes to the fore as the full and major plot point, because it is considered evil to say \"I\", and it's even more evil to say \"I love you.\" How much worse is it when you can see right into the heart and mind of someone else who takes the drug with you? Is it a mystical entwining, an exploration of love and understanding? Or is it, as everyone else seems to think, a twisted aberration, an illegal and immoral pastime, or the destruction of everything good and right in the world? The tale of the gods does hold a moral, after all.\n\nHonestly, I've read a lot of great drug-culture books, fiction and non-fiction, but this reads as one of the very best, exploring the highlights and the problems within our own culture and especially of the 60's and 70's. Not only is it a fascinatingly good story in its own right, but it reflects our world in equal measure, serving a dual duty nearly effortlessly.\n\nJust a warning, though, for you readers who might get turned off by free-sex and shameless, almost laughable pornography: The novel has it. Just remember the times. It's all about throwing off the shackles of the accepted norm, after all, whether it's conformity, sexual repression, or opening your mind to new experiences. If you keep that in mind, I'm sure you'll get a kick out of this novel in the spirit it is offered.\n\nOh, and by the way, it was nominated for '72 Hugo and won the '71 Nebula. Interesting, no?\n\nApril 14, 2024\n\nI don’t write reviews.\n\nSilverberg explored an interesting idea: a society which actively shuns the idea of the self. Someone told me the other day that a secret is, in itself, a lie. I wasn’t sure if I agreed when I first heard that, but the more I reflect, including reading this story, the more I think he might be onto something. Imagine a world without secrets and division. Think of a world where you can openly tell everyone “I love you” and honestly mean it. Silverberg’s protagonist yearned for such a world. I do too.\n\nFebruary 8, 2016\n\nRobert Silverberg is a legend, one of the all-time greats, and among these all-time greats he is probably the most underrated. He has Hugo and Nebula Awards up the wazoo but is relatively unknown compared to the giants of the genre like Asimov, Clarke, and Heinlein, IMHO he belongs up there with them in term of accolades.\n\nA Time of Changes is one of his best novels if his Goodreads page is anything to go by. However, if you have never read anything by Silverberg before you may want to start with something more immediately accessible like Lord Valentine s Castle or Dying Inside. That said A Time of Changes is indeed an extremely good and unusual book. If you are in the mood for a thought provoking (but not action packed) book by all means dive straight into this one.\n\nThe novel gets off to a slow start and never really shifts into high gear. However, once you immerse into the story, characters and settings the fascination sets in, and the slow pace becomes a kind of virtue.\n\n“this planet was settled by men who had strong religious beliefs, who specifically came here to preserve them, and who took great pains to instill them in their descendants.”\n\nIn a nutshell, the story is set on a human colony planet called Velada Borthan where intimacy is taboo and self-denial is the norm. Their society operates under a Covenant that prohibits opening up one’s feelings except to a designated bondbrother and bondsister. The usage of first person pronouns “I” and “me” is considered obscene. The title of the book refers to the protagonist Kinnall Darival’s discovery of a drug that forms a temporary telepathic link between the drinkers. After his first experience with the drug, it becomes clear that the Covenant is preventing people from intimacy, and thereby from understanding and loving each other.\n\nIt is actually fairly difficult to synopsize this book briefly and interestingly but it really is a wonderful thought experiment that explores human relationship, religiosity, and empathy. A culture where people build walls around themselves to keep everybody at a distance and human interactions are always impersonal have far-reaching implications. In some way, it is an allegory for impersonal, taciturn human relationships we often encounter in real life.\n\nI hesitate to call A Time of Changes a “difficult book” as the narrative style is straightforward, and even the timeline is almost completely linear (except for the frame story at the beginning and the end) with only one plot stand and point of view. The possible difficulty lies in the unusual theme and slow, contemplative pacing. As usual, Robert Silverberg writes beautiful literary prose without lapsing into excessively lyrical passages. There is even some mild humour in the “polite circumlocution” dialogue which is the norm for this planet. For example:\n\n”I should not have said, “One would have a room,” but rather, “Is there a room to be had? ” At a restaurant, it is wrong to say, “One will dine on thus and thus,” but rather, “These are the dishes that have been chosen.” And so on and so on, twisting everything into a cumbersome passive form to avoid the sin of acknowledging one’s own existence.”\n\nIn writing this review I find that while I love the book I can not sell it very well because it is not a “fun read” as such, unless you enjoy pondering thought experiments. If you read this book and dismiss it as “boring” you may want to pause to examine what you want from a novel. If it is purely entertainment then this may not be the book for you. If you enjoy imagining how our society may operating under very different sets of rules A Time of Changes is endlessly fascinating. The Nebula Award (1971) for Best Novel is well deserved.\n\nSeptember 20, 2015\n\nThis is one of Silverberg’s best novels from his most prolific and creative period in the late 1960s/early 1970s, along with Downward to the Earth and Dying Inside.\n\nIt’s about a repressive human society on a distant planet called Borthan, in which the terms “I” and “myself” are obscenities, and “self-bearing” is a serious crime. It’s the story of Kinnall Darival, the second son of a Plutarch (essentially a prince), who must leave his home to avoid being a threat to his older brother’s claim to rulership. When he encounters an Earthman trader named Schweiz, he forms an intimate bond that would be unacceptable with others of his kind, and when the Earthman introduces him to a mind-altering drug that allows a direct and complete telepathic sharing of the souls of both users, this breaks down the rigid bonds inside him and catalyzes him to form a new movement (perhaps religion is more accurate) to open up others to their own feelings, since they must “learn to love themselves in order to love others”. The idea of using drugs to break down the artificial barriers of society and the mind is a vintage 1960s/1970s theme.\n\nIn surprising ways, this book resembled Evgeny Zamyatin’s We (1924) and Ayn Rand’s Anthem (1938) since it depicted a repressive society that demonizes the individual, venerates the group, and suppresses private feelings. In both books, the concept of “I” is forbidden, and people have numbers in place of names. However, those early dystopian classics were written by Russian emigrates who had escaped oppressive totalitarian regimes, and forcibly showed the dangers of suppressing free will and individualism. What is most interesting is that Anthem came to a radically different conclusion from A Time of Changes. Instead of exhorting readers to love themselves and others and break down barriers, Ayn Rand pushes her famous philosophy of objectivity, which emphasizes self-interest, reason, and individual freedom. Despite the outward similarities of concept, the messages couldn’t be any more different.\n\nI was also strongly reminded of Ursula K. LeGuin’s The Left Hand of Darkness. Both novels are set on distant planets settled by humanity but relatively isolated and somewhat undeveloped technologically. In LeGuin’s Gethen, the population consists of hermaphrodites that assume male and female aspects only when in heat (“kemmer”). When a human envoy named Genly Ai arrives, he goes through great difficulties understanding their cultures and recognizing his own shortcomings and gender biases. The plot has a lot of similarities as Genly’s companion Estraven is a powerful bureaucrat that is forced into exile and must hide in various guises as he travels to various kingdoms. This is similar to Kinnall Darival’s story, the second son of a septarch who must go into exile and disguise himself for political reasons at first, and later because he tries to spread the seditious new religion of self-discovery. Both books are journeys of self-discovery featuring spiritual awakenings and are highly recommended.\n\nFebruary 5, 2011\n\n4.0 to 4.5 stars Another intelligent and provocative story by Robert Silverberg who seems to have a real gift for evocative stories. This strong, emotional tale involves the journey of a repressed member of a repressed society to open himself up and find his “self.\"\n\nThe novel is set on a distant planet (originally colonized from an Earth over-populated and polluted). The planet's population lives by the \"Covenant\" whose most notable characteristic is the complete and utter denial of \"self.\" Words like \"I\" and \"me\" are obscenities and their use is a crime (known as self-bearing). The central character is Kinnall Darival, a noble who has always found himself troubled by the ways of his people. Kinnall, through the use of a new drug finds that he is able to link telepathically with others and share their thoughts and feelings. This \"sharing\" leads Kinnall to revolt against the oppressive culture. The novel is presented in the style of an autobiography, written by Kinnall while he awaits impending capture and imprisonment for his cultural crimes. I found this to be a very well written and powerful story by one of the masters of psychological science fiction. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!\n\nWinner: Nebula Award Best Novel (1972)\n\nNominee: Hugo Award Best Novel (1972)\n\nNominee: Locus Award Best SF Novel (1972)\n\nApril 10, 2017\n\nPuritans to the stars? Something like that. As usual, Silverberg delves into a complex issue with realistic characters & manages to keep them distant enough that I never manage to care about them.\n\nThis has an interesting premise, a belief system of self-containment that our main character eventually fights. There are elements from many great classics, Heart of Darkness, The Scarlet Letter, & others. I could appreciate the complex theme, the world building, & tragedy, but it never sucked me in. He's a great editor & a technically accomplished author, but I rarely connect with his characters. That made his books a slog when I was younger. I thought I'd give him another chance. Still the same for me, though. My library has a few other books by him, but I doubt I'll bother any time soon. Like Frank Herbert's books, our interests rarely overlap.\n\nMay 31, 2021\n\nThis book is far, far too preoccupied with its leading man's premature ejaculation.\n\nThe repetitive fact that he puts his penis in many willing receptacle women - but never sticks it in the one woman he truly lusts after - really distracted me from the story where he learns to bare his soul... or be human...\n\n....\n\n....\n\n....\n\nGuys, he gets high on a drug and it changes his life.\n\nThe End.\n\nIn case you're wondering, Kinnall does finally learn to control his ejaculations during sex, for a bit of orgasmic love with a prostitute, once he experiences mind-mingling with other human beings. I know we were all dying for that bit of closure.\n\nMarch 18, 2015\n\nThis 1971 novel won the Nebula Award and was nominated for the Hugo, but I have to confess I found it to be quite underwhelming.\n\nRobert Silverberg offers a first-person memoir of a future human (descended from Earthlings) on a far distant planet. In his society words like \"I\" and \"me\" are considered obscenities. Burdening others with one's individuality, sharing one's self with them, is held to be a sin that should be limited whenever possible. When he meets a man from Earth with a rare and illegal drug that allows individuals to fuse their consciousnesses, the protagonist questions and ultimately rebels against his culture's taboos, and he pays the price for his heresy.\n\nThe novel has problems. First, the world-building seems poorly thought out. If individuality and personal pride and sharing are evil -- if people must deflect attention from self by saying \"one\" instead of \"I\" or \"me\" -- why do they have personal names and take pleasure in having namesakes, for instance? Over and over again, when inconsistencies reared their heads, it occurred to me that Yevgeny Zamyatin (We) and George Orwell (1984) offered far more sophisticated explorations of how institutions may (try to) control language and how language in turn affects identity and self-perception, and they did it half a century before Silverberg wrote this.\n\nSecond, for the main character's \"time of changes\" to have the proper impact, the reader should empathize with him in some way and appreciate the depth and drama of his awakening and transformation. Instead, he's about as unsympathetic as they come: flat, uninspiring, oddly two-dimensional, and at times genuinely annoying. (I recognize there was a literary reason for his rambling discussions of his impressive genital size and premature ejaculation issues, but I won't miss them, that's for certain.)\n\nThird, the novel comes across as dated in a way that novels a century older or more do not because of Silverberg's handling of the consciousness-expanding drug. It bears all the hallmarks of a late-sixties/early-seventies flirtation with the counterculture -- from a safe distance. Karin Boye's depiction of a \"sharing\" drug in 1940's Kallocain is far more nuanced; for that matter, Robert Heinlein's exploration of the counterculture in Stranger in a Strange Land (published ten years before A Time of Changes) is far more challenging.\n\nIn short, if I can be forgiven for collapsing my review into LOLcat speech, I see what Silverberg's doing there, but he's doing it wrong. Or, to be more precise, everything this novel attempts has been done better elsewhere by others.\n\nJanuary 18, 2015\n\nWhen settlers first colonized Borthan, they set up a society and a religion called \"The Covenant\" that makes \"self-bearing\" into a taboo. People cannot share their deepest thoughts with others, with the sole exception being one's \"bond brother\" and \"bond sister\". One can never say the words \"I\" or \"me\", because that indicates a sort of self-infatuation, or \"self bearing\". Those words are the most terribly obscene words one can possibly utter.\n\nThis science fiction novel is written as an autobiography. The story is set in the far future, on the world of Borthan. Kinall Darival is a prince who feels threatened by his older brother. So he runs from his homeland, in order that his brother might not think him a threat to his throne.\n\nWhile in his self-exile, Kinall meets a man from Earth, who tempts him with a consciousness-raising drug. Neither of them knows exactly what the drug will do; as it turns out, it allows all those taking the drug to snoop around in the minds of the others present. It tends to raise one's consciousness and is also a mode of self-discovery. Kinall resolves to bring this drug to the masses, to allow everyone to share their minds with each other. This will allow people to break out of this taboo.\n\nThis book was first published in 1971, when hallucinogenic drugs were becoming mainstream and self-discovery and cultural freedom were the rage. The book is well written, but it is written in a dry style that is not particularly engaging. It is written as an autobiography, in a voice that is almost devoid of emotion. It is not an adventure story, more of a story of self-discovery. There are some great opportunities for exploring the conflicting philosophies, but those opportunities are not taken.\n\nMay 20, 2023\n\nThis book suffered a bit of being so tied to the hippy period in which it was written. Silverberg has a thing for incest which really hurts the story here as it is hard to get behind a protagonist that goes all out so he can bone his sister. The ideas aren't bad: (1) the society with no \"I\" pronoun kind of presages some of the current societal debates on pronouns; and (2) the mind-opening power of drugs and the dangers therein. And the prose is ok. But, I hesitate between 2- and 3-stars here because the story just didn't resonate with me, even if I ignored the somewhat repulsive incest obsession. This book somehow won a Nebula in 1972 over Ursula Le Guin's excellent The Lathe of Heaven which is a bit mind-boggling.\n\nMarch 17, 2024\n\nAn excellently written novel by Silverberg. It is written in the form of a memoir by one who has gone into hiding after taking on a mission to change the ways of his world by freeing its citizens of the covenants constraint of the forbidden practice of acknowledgment of one's self. Had Silverberg come up with this idea and attempted this in the 1950's, it might have a pulpier title like, \"The Man Who Dared Say \"I\". I'm glad the idea struck him twenty years later. This might be his master piece. If you care only to read one novel by Silverberg, this might be the one.\n\nJune 22, 2018\n\nDeși romanul ăsta are aproape 50 de ani, încă rezistă binișor timpului și cred că subiectul aproape mainstream îl salvează după atâta timp. Acțiunea se petrece pe planeta Borthan, o planetă cu mai multe continente și mai multe națiuni aflate în competiție, uneori în război. Timpul planetei e un timp ciudat: un soi de final de ev mediu, dar care păstrează încă resturi de tehnologie din anii primilor colonizatori: mașini, arme, chiar mașini zburătoare. În rest, cetăți, vapoare, agricultură și o economie destul de medievală.\n\nKinnall, personajul central, e fiul septarului provinciei Salla, și după ce fratele său devine rege, e obligat să rătăcească prin celelalte provincii rivale, de frica unui asasinat. Credința majoritară pe această planetă e cea a Legământului - religie care interzice destăinuirea sentimentelor și gândurilor proprii altcuiva decât prelaților numiți decantatori, precum e interzisă și folosirea pronumelor personale. Toată lumea se referă la sine folosind persoana a 3-a, un soi de ștergere a individualității ca prim pas pentru anularea sinelui orgolios și poate păcătos.\n\nDeși viața nu e așa dură cum am credea cu Kinnall, întâlnirea cu pământeanul Schweiz și descoperirea unui drog care leagă două suflete între ele, aruncă întreg sistemul de credințe în aer și-l transformă pe fiul fostului septarh în preot al unei erezii majore. Evident, nimic bun nu se anunță pentru viitorul personajului nostru.\n\nUn roman ingenios, deși plasat într-un context istoric cu multe intrigi de curte, dar care reușește în puține pagini să spună o poveste coerentă care cred că astăzi, dacă ar fi fost scrisă, ar fi ocupat multe sute de pagini și poate mai multe volume. Recomand, mai ales că apare o ediție nouă la Paladin.\n\nAugust 20, 2016\n\nNije loša, iako malčice zamorna. Fino zamišljen svijet i politički ustroj. (Npr. ne smiješ o sebi govoriti u prvom licu). Orginalna ideja. Silverbergova kritika na Zemljane i opijate jer jasna kao dan. Otvoren kraj je fino zamišljen, ali ipak romanu fali ono nešto. Osvojio je Nebulu, bio nominiran za Hugo i Locus, vjerojatno zbog te orginalnosti.\n\nŠto se stila tiče, ovo je malčice drugačiji Silverberg od onoga na kojega smo naviknula, ali i dalje tečan, jasan i vrlo vrlo jednostavan. Ne skrivam da volim Robertovo pisanje i ranije i kasnije radove.\n\nUglavnom, roman je fina zabava, dobra je radnja, no nije ona da te raspameti.\n\nSeptember 17, 2019\n\nA Time of Changes won the Nebula Award for best novel of 1971. I never numbered it as among my favorite Silverberg titles, and after having listened to the audiobook version I haven't changed my opinion. It's a very well-written book, nicely paced and plotted, swinging back and forth in time to heighten tension and underline events and emphasize points. Silverberg was at his best in portraying complex characters here. It's very much a novel of the 1960's, being the story of finding and being yourself with lengthy examinations of sex and drugs and philosophy. (I can't help but wonder if it mightn't have been written in some small part as a response to the most famous novel by science fiction's other famous Robert-- Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land.) There's no real speculative element other than drug-induced telepathy; one character is identified as an Earthman and it's stated that the planet is but one of many inhabited by humans, but I believe the real setting of the novel is California (and what a long, strange trip it is...) A Time of Changes is great literature, but not necessarily great science fiction. (I never understood the original cover that seems to portray a bird growing out of an aboriginal head... still don't...)\n\nFebruary 8, 2019\n\n7/10. Media de los 30 libros leídos del autor : 6/10\n\nLeí mucho a Silverberg de chaval. Junto a joyas como \"Tiempo de mutantes\" o \"El hombre en el laberinto\" (o incluso la saga e Majipur) tiene libros normalitos o malos-malos. Este le sube la media un poco.\n\nJuly 25, 2021\n\nAcabo en el autobús las últimas páginas de Tiempo de cambios con una sensación ambivalente pero de satisfacción. Satisfacción por haber leído una obra que trata temas de interés antropológico y social, que te deja reflexionando sobre los fundamentos de las sociedades y hasta qué punto estos pueden llegar a ser arbitrarios. En esta cuestión Silverberg vuelve a demostrar su capacidad para especular sobre sociedades humanas alternativas muy en la línea de las preocupaciones new wave del género en los años sesenta y setenta. Tiempo de cambios trata un tema inusual pero muy sugerente: el papel del tabú como norma que fundamenta una organización social. Lo único, eso sí, es que esta especulación tan potente no va acompañada de una trama al mismo nivel que hubiese acabado de hacer brillar la novela. Pero, sorprendentemente, no me ha molestado porque las ideas que maneja Silverberg son de alto voltaje y sus protagonistas profundamente humanos.\n\nJuly 23, 2008\n\n'A Time of Changes' is classic Robert Silverburg of the sort that he rightly recieves acclaim for, but it suffers in my opinion from the fact that Silverburg makes no attempt at all to really maintain the fantastic conceit which is at the heart of the story. That conceit of the story is a world where self-deprication is so esteemed as virtuous and putting oneself forward is likewise deemed immoral, that no one is allowed to refer to oneself in the first person. The pronoun 'I' therefore is a true profanity within the culture eliciting outrage from all hearers and bring harsh censure on those that would use it. Likewise intimacy is criminal, and no one is allowed to discuss thier inner thoughts and feelings and indeed is encouraged to act as if they have none. But Silverburg makes no real sustained attempt to write in this mode, nor does he offer us a real window into the thoughts of someone who has, by the standards of the world, properly lived in such self-denial. Instead, the narrator of the story is recounting past events after having obtained a more familiar sense of the value of self, and as such the story lacks some of the punch it might have if the narrator's new self-awareness was concealed until a more dramatic point in the story. Whenever maintaining the conceit is difficult in the narrative, Silverburg simply drops it and so you never quite feel the setting lives anywhere other than in the story. The setting never quite achieves existance as an interesting mental toy for the reader to play with and ponder, and we are left to do the invention that the author left undone.\n\nThat said, this is Robert Silverburg, and the story is well written and reasonably gripping. I particularly like how the sharing of self and the mingling of the self with the other leads not to a less defined or nebulous sense of self, but a greater and more refined one. This easily could have been a five star work had Silverburg managed to maintain the central conciet, and even so its still easy to see why this story won the Nebula for 1971.\n\nMarch 18, 2014\n\nAfter four years of successive losses, sci-fi great Robert Silverberg finally picked up his first Nebula Award in 1972. His 1967 novel \"Thorns\" had lost to Samuel R. Delany's \"The Einstein Intersection,\" his brilliant '68 novel \"The Masks of Time\" had been bested by Alexei Panshin's equally brilliant \"Rite of Passage,\" '69's time travel tale \"Up the Line\" had succumbed to Ursula K. Le Guin's \"The Left Hand of Darkness,\" while 1970's unforgettable \"Tower of Glass\" had been beaten by Larry Niven's \"Ringworld.\" But in '72, Silverberg finally copped the top prize given out by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, winning for his superb novel \"A Time of Changes\" and prevailing over Le Guin's \"The Lathe of Heaven\" and novels by Kate Wilhelm, Poul Anderson, T.J. Bass and R.A. Lafferty. (\"A Time of Changes\" was also nominated for the Hugo Award, ultimately losing to Philip Jose Farmer's \"To Your Scattered Bodies Go.\") Originally appearing in the March - May '71 issues of \"Galaxy\" magazine, the novel was released as a hardcover book in June of that year, and in conjunction with the author's three other remarkable novels of 1971--\"The Second Trip,\" \"Son of Man\" and \"The World Inside\"--demonstrate what a tremendous roll Silverberg was on during this phase of his lengthy career.\n\n\"A Time of Changes\" takes the form of a memoir written by the fugitive prince Kinnall Darival, who pens his story in the desertlike Burnt Lowlands of the planet Borthan, at least 1,000 years from today. Darival is currently the most wanted man on the planet, and his story explains why. First settled by Earthmen a millennium earlier, Borthan--or, at least, Velada Borthan, the only continent that has been civilized--is now a society run in conformity with the dictates of their \"Covenant.\" It is a society that severely frowns on any demonstration of the self. Speaking of one's feelings to another has been proscribed, to the point that even the use of such words as \"I\" and \"myself\" are deemed more offensive than the 21st century \"F bomb.\" Indeed, one may only speak of such intimate matters to one's bondsister or bondbrother (everyone, apparently, gets two) or to the professional \"drainers,\" who, in their quasireligious manner, seem to combine the attributes of both analyst and paid confessor. As Darival tells us from his crumbling shack in the middle of the burning desert, he had been forced to leave his province of Salla when his older brother, Stirron, had assumed the position of septarch, following the death of their father. He had found little welcome in the northern, ascetic province of Glin, and so had worked his way down to the southern, tropical province of Manneran, where he had wed the look-alike cousin of his bondsister Halum (who he'd been shamefully in love with), raised a family and risen to a position of prominence. All was going well with him until he'd encountered the roving Earthman named Schweiz, who made him realize what a repressive society he lived in, and with whom he'd partaken of a drug from the uncivilized southern continent of Sumara Borthan, which enabled its users to enter one another's minds and (gasp!) share feelings. And Darival's crimes were only compounded when, in company with Schweiz, he'd traveled to the unknown continent to get more of the drug, and come back to \"turn on\" the populace to a new covenant of love, feelings and mutual understanding....\n\n\"A Time of Changes\" is a beautifully written book, and as it turns out, Kinnall Darival is almost as good a writer as Silverberg himself (LOL!). He is an immensely likable and self-effacing man, imposing physically yet constantly telling the reader about his perceived \"shortcomings\" (such as his premature ejaculation problem), and his slow conversion from upright observer of the puritanical Covenant to a messiah of free love is wonderful to behold. The world of Borthan is meticulously described by the author, down to its history, geography, customs, flora and fauna, and can almost be seen as a warm-up for Silverberg's most elaborately detailed planet, Majipoor (although it took him eight novels and change to flesh out THAT world fully). Very much a novel of its time, with its emphasis on drugs and \"soul sharing\" and the liberating power of love, the book retains its great effectiveness today, over four decades later. As for that Sumaran drug, it is described in a manner that forcefully brings to mind LSD, especially when Kinnall and Schweiz spill the powder into some wine, drink it down, and wait a 1/2 hour or so for the effects to manifest. Those initial effects DO seem reminiscent of the lysergic experience, too, although no acid that I have ever heard of, unfortunately, enabled soul-to-soul telepathy between its users. A pity. As in \"Son of Man\" (an extremely psychedelic, borderline unreadable book that makes one wonder about the extent of Silverberg's own drug experiments during that period!), our lead character here gets to know what it feels like to be a woman (by doing the drug with his mistress); as does the telepath David Selig in the author's 1972 novel \"Dying Inside,\" our lead character also gets to experience a \"double orgasm\" (while doing the drug and having sex with that same woman). The book is absolutely compelling, fascinating and charming; a true \"page-turner\" that even contains some traces of genuine humor (in an apparent nod to \"Star Trek,\" the shipmaster who takes Kinnall and Schweiz to the southern continent is named...Capt. Khrisch!). \"My prose has its faults,\" Darival tells us at one point in his history, but there were certainly none that this reader could discern. In all, this is yet another wonderful creation from Mr. Silverberg, one of the best of the 15 or so that I have read so far, and surely deserving of that Nebula Award. To put it succinctly, and in a phrase that would surely shock and appall most of the inhabitants of Velada Borthan, \"As for myself, I loved it!\"\n\nNovember 15, 2009\n\nIt's a truism widely held that science fiction isn't so much about the future or the exotic locales it portrays as it is about the here and now, refracted through the lens of otherness. A Time of Changes certainly bolsters that theory. It won a Nebula award when it was published, possibly because of that very resonance with a particular time and place—but in the cold light of the 21st Century, it seems a little harder to read.\n\nThe story has two main quirks that intersect to create this impression. The first is an artful (but somehow not quite artful enough) portrayal of a society which has rejected the use of the personal pronoun - \"I\" and \"me\" are obscenities, which one uses only in extreme circumstances. This is a brilliant way to create an alien feeling for a human culture.\n\nHowever, the point of view is that of a heretic \"self-barer\" who has chosen to break the taboo against using these words, and hence the impact of this societal difference is muted for the reader. This strikes me as a missed opportunity; contrast with Jack Womack's pitch-perfect control of first-person diction in Random Acts of Senseless Violence, in which the protagonist's own voice changes continuously, subtly and believably as she descends social strata. In A Time of Changes, Kinnall of Salla speaks in the same rather smug and self-centered voice throughout, so we get less of a sense of the wrenching changes that must have taken place for him before he could write \"I mean to tell you all about myself\" on the first page of his memoir.\n\nThe second noticeable thing is the way that the planet's cultures look so much like those of... southern California in the Sixties. Oh, not in detail, of course - most of the planet Borthan is in thrall to the Covenant-based theocracy of its puritan founders, and its patchwork politics of petty fiefdoms bears little resemblance to California's regional differences. But Kinnall's journey of literal self-discovery, the paths he takes and the solutions he is given, seem very much those that would have appealed to—well, no, not someone already immersed in the counterculture of the time, but to someone who was interested in the counterculture.\n\nFor all of that, the story's still a good one. Silverberg was a masterful writer at the top of his form when he wrote this book. Also, the foreword by Silverberg, new to this edition, contains some interesting observations about the context in which the book was written. As an artifact of a time of changes, Silverberg's novel still holds interest.\n\nMay 8, 2017\n\nStoryline: 2/5\n\nCharacters: 2/5\n\nWriting Style: 2/5\n\nWorld: 1/5\n\nThis is my fifth Robert Silverberg book, and it reaffirmed for me what I regard as his most distinctive quality: the wide divide between potential and execution. In his heyday Silverberg was reportedly writing 250,000 a words a month, and his books show it. They betray that they were hatched by an imaginative and rascally mind, stitched together by someone with an instinctual feel for plotting, and then glossed over with a stain of science fiction trappings. Publish it quickly then begin anew. In the introduction to this one, Silverberg comments how he struggled for a week over how to subvert grammar to give his characters and civilization their alien identity. A week?! The ambitions Silverberg had here were grand, worthy of a great book. A mindset of the sort Silverberg was trying to create would take months, years perhaps, to tinker with, adjust, and get right. My complaint against Silverberg is that he didn't take his science fiction work as serious work. The novels he were writing were amusing paperback genre fiction that stood out because they had pretensions to something greater. He knew that he was onto something challenging in this book. The idea of the iconoclast in a culture of Stoics was fertile ground for plays with language, unique character development, and broad culture building. From start to finish, however, you can see how he shrugs off the bigger challenges and opts for the shortcuts. From the very way this was framed - as flashback - this gives him leeway to avoid the heavy work of a serious novel. Instead of showing us the breadth of the repressive culture, he simply tells us to take his word that it exists. The experiences of this rebel, we are told, cannot be expressed in words; we must simply believe Silverberg that they are truly shocking. Most of this book is soliloquy where the author claims society is overly restrictive, the protagonist is newly awakened, and the clash is dramatic. I never felt the restrictions, the awakening, or the drama.\n\nSilverberg notes that this idea of a society had been presented elsewhere Ayn Rand's Anthem. I haven't read that, though it is on my list of books to get to. I have to believe she handled it with more gravity. Two other, similar, books come to mind Ursula K. Le Guin's Left Hand of Darkness and Catherynne Valente's Palimpsest. Both were more deft with the elements of storytelling: plot, characters, and worldbuilding. If this review sounds embittered, it is because I am. This should have been a really good work, but I'm chagrined by just how expansive the gap was between potential and execution this time.\n\nJanuary 29, 2023\n\nThe first time a Silverberg novel didn't click with me. The prose is still smooth, but the narrative is aimless. Even worse, the central ideas have become repetitive and uninteresting as the exact same themes have been explored more effectively in every other Silverberg novel I've read.\n\nMay 2, 2023\n\nA incredible journey of self discovery, understanding of love, what it means to share your soul and how little importance status has in defining who you are.\n\nI‘ve lost myself in the story of this book only to emerge with a better understanding of what I need to do in life.\n\nOh and one more thing I really would like to try but you have to read the book to find out what that might be.\n\nApril 6, 2024\n\nI liked this, lots of good ideas and interesting twists along the way.\n\nMay 20, 2024\n\nLocal perv deals drugs\n\ngets high on his own supply\n\nshrugs off the harm done.\n\nJuly 24, 2021\n\nTremendament sorprès que una novel·la com aquesta, en què la trama és pràcticament inexistent m’hagi deixat enganxat fins al final. Té uns quants errors, alguns tocs masclistes i alguns fils que no s’acaben de tancar del tot, però la reflexió sobre les convencions socials i la llibertat en aquesta societat en què “jo” és un tabú és tan poderosa i et duu per camins tan interessants, sobretot sobre el paper exerceix la religió i la societat en el nostre llenguatge i la manera com veiem el món. I la degradació moral (o no) del protagonista està magníficament descrita. Les idees de Silverberg no deixen de fascinar-me."
