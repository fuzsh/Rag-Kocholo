        "text": "Amazon Barnes and Noble Kobo\n\nFirst in a projected eight volumes collecting all of the short stories and novellas SF Grandmaster Silverberg wants to take their place on the permanent shelf. Each volume will be roughly 150,000-200,000 words, with classics and lesser known gems alike. Mr. Silverberg has also graced us with a lengthy introduction and extensive story notes for each tale.\n\nThe Subterranean Collected Silverberg will vary greatly from the UK trade paperback series published in the 1990s. Due to the publisher's desire to limit the series to six volumes, many stories and, especially, novellas, could not be included. The Subterranean Collected Silverberg will be the definitive set.\n\nLimited: 125 signed numbered hardcover copies, bound in leather and cloth\n\nTrade: fully cloth bound edition\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nGorgon Planet\n\nThe Road to Nightfall\n\nThe Silent Colony\n\nAbsolutely Inflexible\n\nThe MacAuley Circuit\n\nThe Songs of Summer\n\nTo Be Continued\n\nAlaree\n\nThe Artifact Business\n\nCollecting Team\n\nA Man of Talent\n\nOne-Way Journey\n\nSunrise on Mercury\n\nWorld of a Thousand Colors\n\nWarm Man\n\nBlaze of Glory\n\nWhy?\n\nThe Outbreeders\n\nThe Man Who Never Forgot\n\nThere Was an Old Woman\n\nThe Iron Chancellor\n\nOzymandias\n\nCounterpart\n\nDelivery Guaranteed\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Beginning with his very first sale, \"Gorgon Planet,\" Hugo and Nebula award-winner Silverberg (A Time of Changes) collects 24 stories from the prolific first five years of his career (1953-1958), each piece with a lively headnote about its genesis, magazine venue and editor... Though none of his best-known or award-winning stories are included, these selections, which Silverberg deems the best of his early era, illustrate his apprenticeship and presage the Grand Master he has become.\"\n\nFrom SF Site:\n\n\"And there is a consistent ambition which clearly drives most of the stories here. All of this is unusual in the pulp science fiction of the time, and while they would lead to bigger and better things for Silverberg they also mean that these early efforts still retain interest for the reader today.\""
