With many looking to his work for inspiration, as he has lead the way for many years now, he is not only a writer of high standing, but he’s also one of the most prolific too. This has lead to him being one of the strongest voices currently going on the literary scene as well, as he continues to write in a evocative and inventive style. Building entire worlds within his novels, he’s managed to create a whole style that is all of his very own, with his work being immediately recognizable. It is also his characters that manage to draw readers in too, as they come alive off the page, quickly drawing the reader and keeping them there.\n\nEntertaining and engaging in equal measure, Silverberg writes in a manner which is extremely accessible and easy to follow. Whilst his stories may be rich and textured with highly complex narratives, he manage to navigate through all of this deftly, allowing his stories to stay seemingly light and breezy throughout. Not just that, but he also entertains, as he has gained acclaim from the general public, as well as gaining critical acclaim for his efforts over the years. Writing a number of series too, he is highly talented at creating large and expansive arcs that really reward the long-term readers too. It is this legacy that will continue to live on for many years to come, something that will carry on for quite some time yet.\n\nEarly and Personal Life\n\nBorn on the 15th of January in 1935, he would immerse himself in the science-fiction genre from a young age, using it as a form of escapism almost. Alluding to the fact that he may have been a fairly lonely child growing up, it was through the wide and expansive universes found within science-fiction that he found solace. Over the years he would work at developing this passion, building upon it, allowing it to evolve and shape itself through his formative years. Starting a science-fiction fanzine in 1949, he would bring this love of the genre to light, as he would start to explore his love of the field through a more creative format. This would be called ‘Spaceship’, and he would later go on to sell to Science Fiction Adventures, with a non-fiction piece which would be titled ‘Fanmag’.\n\nStudying and majoring in Comparative Literature, he would later go on to graduate from Columbia University in 1956. Keeping his personal life more separate from his novels initially, he would keep his fiction apart from his real life, allowing it to speak more for itself. This would also allow him to find himself in his far off worlds, giving them a very real and very grounded sense of personality throughout. Marrying the electronics engineer Barbara Brown, she would specialize in optics and radar, something which he would also divulge later on too. Currently living in the San Francisco Bay Area, he know lives with his wife and fellow science-fiction writer Karen Haber, where he continues to write to this very day.\n\nWriting Career\n\nSelling his first science-fiction novel, Robert Silverberg would release his debut story, making his arrival onto the literary scene in 1954. His first fictional piece would be called Gorgon Planet, as it would help establish his name as a writer, quickly allowing him to grow in prominence. Later going on to write under various different pseudonyms, he would also use pen-names such as Don Elliot, Robert Randall, Calvin M Knox and Ivar Jorgenson. Writing his first book in 1955, he would make his full literary debut with the book ‘Revolt on Alpha C’, which would also help establish his name. Known for creating fun and inventive adventures, he would bring a fast paced and exciting style of tone into his work.\n\nWinning various awards and nominations for his many different stories and novels, Silverberg would go on to gain the eye of the critical establishment too. Constantly pushing the form forwards, he would really work at making the most of his premises, always seeing what new directions he could take his material in. Over time he would also branch away from science-fiction too, as he would become known for writing erotic novels during his time too. Building vast and expansive worlds, his imagination has remained unparalleled over the years with many writers looking to explore these universes. It is this legacy that will continue to live on, with more and more readers discovering his work every day, which will not be stopping any time soon.\n\nDownward to the Earth\n\nPreviously published through the Roc publishing outlet, this was first released in 1969. A stand-alone title, it works on its own as a self-contained science-fiction story. Creating its own universe, it shows how far Silverberg came ever since his first release.\n\nResembling elephants somewhat, the Nildoror have been underestimated by many for a long time now. With their more fearsome counterparts, the Sulidoror, they are both judged by human standards, something which could prove to be detrimental to many. Holman’s World is now known as Belzagor once more, as it has been returned to the natives there, with the Company being sent away. Can previous head of the Company Edmund Gunderson gain the ear of Nildoror again? Will his journey to mend old ties be wasted? What will happen is he’s sent back downward to the Earth?\n\nValentine Pontifex\n\nInitially published through Eos, this originally came out in 1983. It would mark the third title in the ongoing ‘Lord Valentine’ series of novels. Continuing on from the last, it would provide the next episode in the long-running science-fiction saga.\n\nSet in the world of Majipoor, this looks at the background of Lord Valentines Castle conflict. Featuring Valentine Pontifex, it sees wizardry and treachery run rampant under his reign. Not only that, but Korsibar is plotting to take the throne with his twin sister. Will he succeed? Can the almighty Pontifex be defended? What will become of Valentine Pontifex?"
