It’s a post-apocalyptic story about twelve immortals who have divided most of the world among themselves into separate Empires, leaving a few other places to whoever claims them. Those few key other spaces include a mutant city, a computerized city with no human inhabitants,\n\nRead More\n\nBrad Hawley´s rating: 3.5 | Robert Silverberg | Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 2 comments |\n\nMaster of Life and Death by Robert Silverberg\n\nFuture Grand Master Robert Silverberg’s fifth sci-fi novel, Master of Life and Death, was originally released as one-half of one of those cute little “Ace doubles” (D-237, for all you collectors out there), back to back with James White’s The Secret Visitors. Published in 1957, this was one of “only” three novels that Silverberg would release that year (the others were The Dawning Light and The Shrouded Planet),\n\nRead More\n\nSandy Ferber´s rating: 3.5 | Robert Silverberg | Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 5 comments |\n\nInvaders from Earth by Robert Silverberg\n\nThere is apparently a marked difference in the novels that sci-fi great Robert Silverberg wrote before 1967 and the ones he penned from ’67 to eight or nine years after. Those two dozen novels of the 1954-’65 period, it has been said, are well-written, polished, plot-driven tales reminiscent of the pulp era of sci-fi’s Golden Age. But after author/editor Frederik Pohl gave Silverberg freedom to write as he chose in ’67, a new, more mature, more literate quality entered Silverberg’s work, and the two dozen novels that he wrote during this second phase of his career are often cited as his best.\n\nRead More\n\nSandy Ferber´s rating: 4 | Robert Silverberg | Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | no comments |\n\nStarman’s Quest by Robert Silverberg\n\nEditor’s Note: Being in the public domain, Starman’s Quest (1958) is available free in Kindle format.

I know that exploring complex themes is also of primary concern for Silverberg because he emphasizes theme in almost all of the forty-plus stories he included in his short story collections covering the period of time before his writing Planet of Death in 1960.\n\nRead More\n\nBrad Hawley´s rating: 2.5 | Robert Silverberg | SFF Reviews | 1 comment |\n\nRecalled to Life by Robert Silverberg\n\nTrue to his word, after announcing his retirement from the science fiction field in 1959, future Grand Master Robert Silverberg’s formerly prodigious output fell off precipitously. Although he’d released some 16 sci-fi novels from the period 1954 – ’59, not to mention almost 250 (!) sci-fi short stories, AFTER 1959 and until his major return in 1967, his sci-fi production was sporadic at best. In 1960, Silverberg only released one sci-fi book, Lost Race of Mars (a so-called “juvenile”),\n\nRead More\n\nSandy Ferber´s rating: 4 | Robert Silverberg | Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 2 comments |\n\nThe Seed of Earth by Robert Silverberg\n\nMen of a certain age may recall a particular trepidation that was attendant with the coming of their 18th birthday; i.e., the fear of being drafted into the armed forces. From 1940 until January ’73, males here in the U.S. could be drafted, even during peacetime, to fill vacancies in the Army and other services, and well do I remember the sigh of relief that many breathed when the draft disappeared, in favor of an all-volunteer system.

By that point, he’d already written, since his professional debut in 1954, some 250 (!) sci-fi short stories as well as 16 novels, and was surely entitled to some kind of a retirement! Ha! Some retirement!

As if by serendipity, while shopping the other day at the Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore extraordinaire Singularity, I found a volume of Silverberg short stories that, as it’s turned out, has fit the bill for me very nicely.

Before then, the author had written no less than two dozen sci-fi novels, starting with 1954’s Revolt on Alpha C not to mention dozens upon dozens of short stories (over 80 in 1958 alone, according to a certain Wiki site). But in 1967, a new maturity and literary quality entered Silverberg’s works, to the surprise of both his fans and fellow writers.\n\nRead More\n\nSandy Ferber and Kat Hooper´s rating: 4 | Robert Silverberg | Audio, Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 1 comment |\n\nThose Who Watch by Robert Silverberg\n\nThere is a certain aptness in the fact that I penned this review for Robert Silverberg’s Those Who Watch on January 15, 2015. That day, you see, happened to be Silverberg’s 80th birthday, so my most sincere wishes for many more happy and healthy birthdays must go out to the man who has become, over the years, my favorite sci-fi author.\n\nThese days, of course, Silverberg is one of the most honored and respected writers in his chosen genre;\n\nRead More\n\nSandy Ferber´s rating: 4 | Robert Silverberg | Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 5 comments |\n\nThe Time Hoppers by Robert Silverberg\n\nThis longtime sci-fi buff has a confession to make: Some time travel stories leave me with a throbbing headache. Not that I don’t enjoy them, mind you; it’s just that oftentimes, the mind-blowing paradoxes inherent in many of these tales set off what feels like a Mobius strip feedback loop in my brain that makes me want to grab a bottle of Excedrin.

It was Pohl, after all, who induced Silverberg to begin writing sci-fi again on a full-time basis, after the author’s “retirement” from the field in 1959. As then-editor of “Galaxy” magazine, Pohl (who helmed the publication from 1961-’69) promised Silverberg a greater freedom in his writing, with fewer of the literary shackles that had restrained the author till then (not that anyone would have ever realized it,\n\nRead More\n\nSandy Ferber´s rating: 5 | Robert Silverberg | Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | no comments |\n\nThe Man in the Maze by Robert Silverberg\n\nIn one of Robert Silverberg’s novels from 1967, Thorns, the future sci-fi Grand Master presented his readers with one of his most unfortunate characters, Minner Burris. An intrepid space explorer, Burris had been captured by the residents of the planet Manipool, surgically altered and then released. Upon his return to Earth, Burris was grotesque to behold, resulting in one very withdrawn, depressed, reclusive and psychologically warped individual indeed.

Dick‘s 1964-’66 period was the most intensely productive and prolific streak that any sci-fi author of note has ever enjoyed, with nine major novels produced during those three years. But as it turns out, Robert Silverberg, seven years P.K.’s junior, has got him beat by a mile. During the three-year period 1967-’69, Silverberg somehow managed the superhuman feat of releasing no less than 15 novels — six in ’67, three in ’68 and six again in ’69 — and all of them,\n\nRead More\n\nSandy Ferber´s rating: 5 | Robert Silverberg | Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 5 comments |\n\nHawksbill Station by Robert Silverberg\n\nAlthough it had been over 45 years since I initially read Robert Silverberg’s novella “Hawksbill Station,” several scenes were as fresh in my memory as if I had read them just yesterday; such is the power and the vividness of this oft-anthologized classic. Originally appearing in the August ’67 issue of Galaxy magazine, the novella did not come to my teenaged attention till the following year, when it was reprinted in a collection entitled World’s Best Science Fiction 1968.

The amazingly prolific author had entered a more mature and literate phase in his writing career in 1967, starting with his remarkable novel Thorns, and by 1969 was on some kind of a genuine roll.

But in Up the Line, he absolutely revels in it. He doesn’t miss a chance for his (all male) characters to fornicate with women at every possible opportunity both in the future and the past, in dozens of exotic time periods in Byzantium, Constantinople, Rome, etc. The act may be as old as time, but that doesn’t stop Time Courier Judd Elliot from trying to bed his great-great-great grandmother Pulcharia with a lusty enthusiasm and complete disregard for all social taboos that have existed for millennia.\n\nRead More\n\nStuart Starosta´s rating: 1 | Robert Silverberg | Audio, Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 16 comments |\n\nAcross a Billion Years by Robert Silverberg\n\nIn Across a Billion Years (1969), Robert Silverberg introduces us to Tom Rice, a young archaeologist in training, who is writing to his twin sister on their 22nd birthday in 2375.

Despite the dire warnings of 20th century prophets, humans have not exhausted the Earth’s resources. There is plenty of food for everyone, but because 90% of the land must be covered in farms, most of the people live in Urban Monads — 1,000-story skyscrapers housing 800,000 people each. Citizens aren’t allowed out of their building, and many aspects of society are rigidly monitored.

These so-called “stoner pictures” — such as Performance, El Topo, Pink Flamingos and Eraserhead — played for years as “midnight movies” and remain hugely popular to this day. Well, just as there is a genre of cinema geared for stoners, it seems to me that there could equally well be a breed of literature with a genuine appeal for those with an “altered consciousness.”\n\nRead More\n\nSandy Ferber´s rating: 3.5 | Robert Silverberg | Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 4 comments |\n\nA Time of Changes by Robert Silverberg\n\nAfter four years of successive losses, sci-fi great Robert Silverberg finally picked up his first Nebula Award in 1972.

And following 1972’s Dying Inside — whose central conceit of a telepath losing his powers has often been seen as corresponding to Silverberg’s self-professed, supposed diminution of his own writing abilities (not that any reader would ever be aware of it) — for the first time in the author’s career,\n\nRead More\n\nSandy Ferber´s rating: 5 | Robert Silverberg | Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | 11 comments |\n\nShadrach in the Furnace by Robert Silverberg\n\nIt’s the summer of 2012 and the Earth is a disaster.

As a result, his collections become two books in one: part short story collection and part portrait of the artist.To be honest, I think I like both parts equally.\n\nIn the Beginning: Tales from the Pulp Era consists of sixteen stories written from 1955 to 1959.\n\nRead More\n\nBrad Hawley´s rating: 4 | Robert Silverberg | Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | 3 comments |\n\nThe Collected Stories of Robert Silverberg Volume One: To Be Continued 1953-1958 by Robert Silverberg\n\nThough To Be Continued: 1953-1958 is the first official volume of the definitive collection of Robert Silverberg’s short stories, it should be read after In the Beginning: Tales from the Pulp Era (1955-1959), a collection of short stories that overlaps with To Be Continued only in terms of chronology: There are absolutely no stories duplicated in the two volumes, and in To Be Continued,\n\nRead More\n\nBrad Hawley´s rating: 4.5 | Robert Silverberg | Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | 3 comments |\n\nThe Collected Stories of Robert Silverberg Volume Six: Multiples 1983-1987 by Robert Silverberg\n\nSince 2006 Subterranean Press has been publishing all of the SFF stories that Robert Silverberg wants in his “definitive” collection in chronological order. I’m a fan of Silverberg’s stories, so I think this series is wonderful — it’s a sure way to get one copy of each of his most important stories in eight tidy volumes. Volume six, titled Multiples, contains fourteen stories and novellas published in the mid-1980s.\n\nIn a general introduction to Multiples,\n\nRead More\n\nKat Hooper´s rating: 4.5 | Robert Silverberg | Hugo Award, Nebula Award, Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | no comments |\n\nThe Last Song of Orpheus by Robert Silverberg\n\nFinally. After all of the conflicting information we get from the numerous myths, legends, writings, and operas about Orpheus, we have the true story told by Orpheus himself as he writes his life story for Musaeus (with some help from Robert Silverberg).\n\nIn The Last Song of Orpheus, all the bits and pieces of Orpheus’s life are tied together into a single chronological narrative and Orpheus tells his own version of how he obtained his famous lyre and used it to charm Pharaoh,\n\nRead More\n\nKat Hooper´s rating: 4 | Robert Silverberg | Stand-Alone | SFF Reviews | no comments |\n\nTimes Three by Robert Silverberg\n\nTime travel is one of Robert Silverberg’s favorite themes and he gives us three of his best time travel novels, and an introduction to each, in the collection Times Three from Subterranean Press.\n\nHawksbill Station (1968) is about a camp for 21st century American political dissidents who are permanently exiled to… the late Cambrian era. Hawksbill Station is a stark and lonely place — it’s all rocks, ocean, and trilobites.

He has garnered for himself four Hugo Awards and six Nebula Awards in the process. The man’s prolific work pace is understandably legendary.

The best story in the magazine, though, is one that is off-theme. “How Bria Died,” by Mike Aronovitz, is the tale of an unorthodox teacher who may well have taken his unusual teaching methods a step too far for the universe to abide. This horror story is fresh, original and written from a position of real authority: Aronovitz teaches English in a school much like the one in which his story is set.\n\nRead More\n\nTerry Weyna | Amal El-Mohtar, Catherynne M.

MacLeod, Kat Howard, Robert Silverberg, Theodora Goss | Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | no comments |\n\nThe September 2011 issue of Asimov’s Science Fiction is a mixed bag, with a couple of amazing stories and a few not so amazing. One of the former is “The Observation Post,” by Allen M. Steele. A recurring motif in science fiction is visitors from the future watching hot points in history, and for this story that hot point is the Cuban Missile Crisis. The story begins with a voyage in a blimp that seems fictional, like something out of a steampunk story, until one realizes that the Navy really did use a few blimps until November 1962,\n\nRead More\n\nTerry Weyna | Allen Steele, Robert Silverberg, Theodore Sturgeon | Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | no comments |\n\nMegan Lindholm’s “Old Paint” is the thoroughly enjoyable novelette about an old car beloved by a family that lets it roam free. The car comes from a time before cars were completely automated, when one could still actually drive them oneself instead of just programming in a destination. It’s so old that its nanotech paint is of a wood veneer on the side of a station wagon. The car is useful, if not exactly a favorite of the teenage boy in the family who’d like something a bit racier. At least, it’s useful up until the time it goes wild because of virus unleashed by a hacker group that did it just to prove they could.\n\nRead More\n\nTerry Weyna | Allen Steele, Megan Lindholm, Robert Silverberg | Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | 1 comment |\n\nSheila Williams, the editor of Asimov’s, says that the annual October/November issue is “slightly spooky.” There are a few frights in the magazine, as well as some solid science fiction, but overall, I was generally disappointed in this double issue.\n\nAlan Smale’s novella, “The Mongolian Book of the Dead,” was not one of the disappointments; to the contrary, it is a nicely imagined tale of what might happen if the Chinese decide to mount a military invasion of Mongolia — an independent landlocked country sandwiched between Russia and China.\n\nRead More\n\nTerry Weyna | Ekaterina Sedia, James Patrick Kelly, Jay Lake, Robert Silverberg, Vylar Kaftan | Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | 1 comment |\n\nThe February 2013 issue of Asimov’s is a delight from cover to cover. This time around, it’s the longer pieces that really given it is heft.\n\n“The Weight of the Sunrise” by Vylar Kaftan is a fascinating alternate history novella that offers a pointed perspective on American history, serving as a sort of bookend to the recent film, “Lincoln.” Slavery was an evil obvious even to those who practiced human sacrifice and saw nothing wrong with incestuous marriages of royalty, as did the Incas, as Kaftan makes clear.\n\nRead More\n\nTerry Weyna | James Patrick Kelly, Matthew Hughes, Robert Silverberg, Vylar Kaftan | Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | no comments |\n\nThe April/May 2013 issue of Asimov’s leads off with a difficult but exciting novella by Neal Asher entitled “The Other Gun.” It portrays a complicated universe in which humanity has found itself at war with a race called the prador, which is ruthless, merciless and completely uninterested in compromise. It has already exterminated several species when it runs into humans, and a survivor of one of those wars, a member of a hive species, has allied itself with humans. The narrator of this tale is a parasitologist and bio-synthesist who was working on a biological weapon to be used against the prador when he was reassigned to work for the Client,\n\nRead More\n\nTerry Weyna | James Patrick Kelly, Ken Liu, Linda Nagata, Naomi Kritzer, Robert Silverberg | Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | 2 comments |\n\nThe first of three novelettes in the February 2014 issue of Asimov’s is Derek Künsken’s “Schools of Clay,” a space opera that is almost incomprehensible. It concerns a race of beings that is modeled on bees, apparently, with queens, workers and new generations of princesses. These beings mine asteroid belts and seem to be partly machine and partly organic (though their nature is never spelled out, one of the serious shortcomings of this story). Some of these beings have souls, and some do not, though what “soul” means in this context is unclear.\n\nRead More\n\nTerry Weyna | Maurice Broaddus, Philip Jose Farmer, Robert Silverberg, Sarah Pinsker | Short Fiction | SFF Reviews | no comments |\n\nOur weekly exploration of free and inexpensive short fiction available on the internet.

I pretty much thought that the George Romero version was it — dead people wandering around holding their arms out in front of them and calling out “braaaaaaains,” looking to munch on the living. I never did know why they had to hold their arms that way, but they all did — I thought.\n\nJohn Joseph Adams has chosen his material wisely in The Living Dead,\n\nRead More\n\nTerry Weyna´s rating: 4.5 | Clive Barker, George R.R.

Ron Hubbard Presents Writers of the Future: Volume 30 edited by Dave Wolverton\n\nThe Writers of the Future contest is held in high regard within the SFF field, largely because of the many fine writers who have had a boost to their early careers through it and the prominence of the judges (and despite its association with L.

This volume contains some excellently-written stories and some which weren’t to my taste but were well done anyway.\n\nRead More\n\nMike Reeves-McMillan´s rating: 4 | L.
