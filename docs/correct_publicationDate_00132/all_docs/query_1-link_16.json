        "text": "Well, here's another thread on Silverberg that's been kicking around for a while:\n\nhttp://www.sffchronicles.co.uk/forum/7033-robert-silverberg.html\n\nI'll report back again soon when I have some more time to formulate my thoughts...\n\nForgot about that thread. I'd have probably written this post differently if I hadn't but oh well.\n\nI know this guy has written a lot of books. Like Phil Dick numbers.\n\nWay more than Dick - more like hitting on Isaac Asimov numbers.\n\nI know there was a period some time in the 60s that people say is when he wrote the best of his works. I've heard that Lord Valentines Castle, and Majipoor books in general, were written to mainstream and sell something commercial. But I've also know some people consider it one of his best. I'm considering reading it, but can't guarantee I'll finish, as fantasies like this usually bore me. I often find them dull.\n\nThat's the historical consensus regarding Silverberg's periods: commercial story factory, artsy great guy, more popular like-em-or-don't Majipoor, and the autumn of the post-Majipoor period. I don't regard the Majipoor books as fantasy, though. The original trilogy, at least, is planetary romance/science fantasy/science fiction but definitely not pure plain fantasy, though it should also appeal to fantasy fans.\n\nWhat are some books of his I should read? Any that aren't written in the 1st person? Or maybe some that are, but are different in approach then how I described Dying Inside?\n\nWell, I can describe what I've read and you can judge how they sound to you.\n\nMaster of Life and Death (1957) - not bad but not required - more serious than one might expect given the rep of his early stuff.\n\nThorns (1967) - supposed to be the first of the \"new\" Silverbergs - it was okay but disappointing given maybe unrealistic expectations. Dark, though.\n\nThe Man in the Maze (1969) - Decent retelling of the Philoctetes story.\n\nUp the Line (1969) - Bad mess of a very 60s time travel yarn. First-person.\n\nNightwings (1969) - A fixup novel of a far future earth that's not as good as the title story.\n\nDownward to the Earth (1970) - The first part of this riff on The Heart of Darkness is some of the best writing around before it concludes in an obvious and disappointing way.\n\nTower of Glass (1970) - Another book - Tower of Babel riffs - with some brilliant writing that didn't quite end perfectly for me.\n\nA Time of Changes (1971) - An anti- (or ultra-?) first-person novel of a society that disapproves of \"I\". Won a Nebula - it's more consistent but doesn't ascend as high peaks as some of the previous books.\n\nThe Book of Skulls (1971) - Not SFF at all - some college students seek immortality. Great book, if highly thematically problematic.\n\nThe Second Trip (1972) - This is an odd book - I don't remember it well but remember it being one of my favorites all the same.\n\nDying Inside (1972) - Almost certainly his masterpiece. But, if you don't like it, never fear - he's got plenty more worth reading and different.\n\nUnfamiliar Territory (1973 coll) - Silverberg's more famous as a novelist but I agree with Victoria that his stories are great - I find his 70s stories (maybe going back to the late 60s) to possibly be his best stuff. This is some excellent examples of those.\n\nBorn with the Dead (1974 coll) - A collection of three novellas whose famous title story is disappointing vs. expectations but still interesting and whose other two novellas are excellent.\n\nThe Feast of St. Dionysus (1975 coll) - Another great 70s collection of five novellas and novelettes.\n\nThe Stochastic Man (1975) - If you didn't like Dying Inside you'll probably want to avoid this, as it struck me as something of a related variant (and also first-person). On the other hand, the very fact that it has commonalities but differences might make it work for you. Probably not, though.\n\nCapricorn Games (1976 coll) - More great shorter stories.\n\nLord Valentine's Castle (1980) - Piqued at not getting a sufficient number of awards, Silverberg retired for all of maybe three years. On his return, he wrote this. Not my kind of thing and I loved it. Works well enough stand-alone.\n\nMajipoor Chronicles (1982 coll) - A collection of stories whose linking story takes place between the two Majipoor novels - provides a historical mosaic of the world and society.\n\nValentine Pontifex (1983) - A lesser novel than the first but a satisfying conclusion to the series.\n\nThe Conglomeroid Cocktail Party (1984 coll) - Arguably just a shade off his 70s stories, but the early 80s stories are still excellent and are probably more similar to their predecessors than his 80s novels are to his 70s novels.\n\nTom O'Bedlam (1985) - A story of a sort of psychic alien invasion - kinda neat, kinda minor.\n\nStar of Gypsies (1986) - A really annoying marysue of the Interstellar Gypsy King. First person, but completely different from Dying Inside.\n\n(I've still got The World Inside (1971 fixup - overpopulation), and Secret Sharers (1992 coll - the collected post-Conglomeroid 80s stories) in the Pile and actually just ordered Shadrach in the Furnace (1976 - his last pre-retirement work) because I got tired of looking for it.)\n\nAlso, I'm wondering how his books and his style compare to other authors Iv read, like PKD, Vonnegut, Delaney, van Vogt, etc?\n\nHe's less psychedelic (generally - there are exceptions) than Dick or van Vogt. He has a dark, sardonic streak, but it's very different from Vonnegut's \"and so it goes\". I haven't read a whole heck of a lot of Delany and don't really care for him but, of the authors cited, he may have more in common with him than the others."
