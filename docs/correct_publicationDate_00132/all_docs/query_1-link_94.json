        "text": "You can't plagiarize yourself.\n\nIt's actually pretty common for writers to turn a short story (or several) into a novel. Your only issues are about copyright.\n\nIf you self-publish the stories, you of course retain the copyright. If you use a traditional publisher (including magazines, websites, etc), you will have a contract (if you do not have a written contract, do not give permission for publication). The contract will specify what the copyright situation is and if there are any other limits.\n\nIt's common for the author to retain copyright but also be subject to some rules about it. For example, the short story publisher may have the right to publish it first (which seems easy, but sometimes projects get delayed). They may also insist on being credited if you republish the story.\n\nRead your contracts carefully to make sure there are no surprises later. And remember, you can always negotiate the terms.\n\nIf you rewrite your short stories to fit a novel format, then they aren't the same stories, though you should still keep the original agreements, if they are anything more than wisps of inspiration.\n\nIf you are purposefully writing your short stories as if each were a chapter in your novel, then they aren't really short stories, but rather serialization. That's fine, it just needs to be made clear in your contracts."
