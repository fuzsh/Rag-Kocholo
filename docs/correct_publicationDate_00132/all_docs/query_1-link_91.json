        "text": "Thoroughly enjoying but it has to hold us until august\n\nIntroduction:​\n\nIn the Arcana Imperii Universe, the Anti-spinward marches of the DHC (Directorate of Human Corporations) are the fastest growing part of the human expansion, with colonies spawning colonies as fast as new, habitable planets are discovered. And there are rumours of another alien race out there in the dark, and various alliances by human colonies that have led to proxy wars and brushfire conflicts. The DHC isn’t exactly a government and it doesn’t really have a spy service, but someone’s got to figure out what’s going on out there on the edge, and someone has to hold the line against a return to the Age of Chaos. It’s worth noting that the DHC has a merchant service that’s very like a space military, and a board of directors (the Seventeen) led by a chairperson (often called the ‘Doje’). The DHC is often resented out on the Fringe, especially by young planetary governments determined to experiment with all of the mistakes that humanity has made in the past. The DHC is devoted to the preservation of interplanetary trade under conditions that foster fair wages and some justice in the distribution of wealth, but it is also dedicated to covering its costs and making a profit on its most important trade item, xenoglas, which comes from the Starfish, who are, so far, the only aliens that humanity has met out in the void. Within the DHC, there is a division between the so-called ‘Core Worlds’ that were settled in humanity’s first burst of expansion during and after the ‘Collapse’ of Old Terra, and the younger frontier worlds. The core worlds, with their huge populations and regulated industry, provide every citizen with a level of wealth that makes life extremely comfortable for most. Out on the frontier, life is harder, and different. And there are levels of unfairness; the large populations in the core can always outvote the frontier worlds. But in the core, as in PTX, humanity retains a strong sense of history, and an insistence that the events of the Collapse never be repeated. On the frontier, old ways are sometimes born again. Readers of Artifact Space are aware that there is a conspiracy within the DHC and even inside the more authoritarian PTX to change the forms of government. That plot, and the tendrils of it that affected the Athens are linked to events in these stories, and will reach their fruition in Deep Black, the sequel to Artifact Space, due out in January 2024. Finally, a word on dates. All dates are ‘ad’ or so-called ‘Christian Era’. Now, let’s be honest, there is no simultaneity across the many light years of the human expansion. However, for the reader to best understand the progression of these stories and the development of the associated plots and discoveries, each story is dated. For comparison, the Athens and Marca Nbaro left the port of New London 2784.4.12 or (old calendar) 12 April 2784. In fact, the calendar of Old Terra remains the ‘standard’ for DHC operations, but no settled planet in the human sphere has a 24-hour day, much less a 365( ish)-day year. The dates are artificial.”\n\nNOTE THE ERROR IN RED above Deep Black is slated for release on August first 2024 according to its listing at Amazon and Audible.\n\n— Beyond the Fringe: An Arcana Imperii Collection by Miles Cameron\n\nBeyond the Fringe: An Arcana Imperii Collection\n\nQuote shared via Kindle: \"Introduction In the Arcana Imperii Universe, the Anti-spinward marches of the DHC (Directorate of Human Corporations) are the fastest growing part of the human expansion, with colonies spawning colonies as fast as new, habitable pl...\n\nThe new short story collection by Miles Cameron\n\nThanks, Raf! Had a look and it seems the original Path of the Fury was edited and reissued along with the prequel In Fury Born, so definitely going to have to read them both\n\nEDIT: Actually I read the info wrong and it seems that Path of the Fury was re-written and republished as In Fury Born, so they're not two books\n\nPath of the Fury (the original novel) is the second part of In Fury Born - it will be fairly clear when it starts as the first part is quite episodic and reads more like a succession of novellas, while the second (the original novel) is coherent with a storyline from the beginning to the end and still a great read 30 years after its publication (Path of the Fury was the first DW novel I've read in 1992-3 and made me a fan for good); there is a good reason why the author chose not to write sequels, but he started a prequel series set centuries in the past which shows how the Empire came to be etc - cowritten with R Fox, the first novel Governor was quite good (actually the audio version will be relasesd this month) and the second novel should be out this year I think"
