        "text": "I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôve really been enjoying these little author bios I‚Äôve posted as part of Vintage Month. When it comes to books themselves, I can usually walk the talk, but I‚Äôm woefully undereducated about the authors of said books. Well, here‚Äôs to less author ignorance! Also, we‚Äôre halfway through Vintage month. Are you having as much fun as I am? I‚Äôm realizing my chosen novels for Vintage month are more ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù, but that‚Äôs OK. Props to those of you who are reading the true classics like Wells and Verne!\n\nToday‚Äôs ‚Äúvintage‚Äù author is Robert Silverberg. He got his start in the 1950‚Äôs, and I feel bad calling him ‚Äúvintage‚Äù, since he is still writing today. Hopefully he won‚Äôt be too mad at me. üòâ\n\nI‚Äôm a sucker for Robert Silverberg. I got lucky, having read some of his award winning fiction first, and these days if a book has his name on it, there‚Äôs a good chance I‚Äôll buy it, even if it‚Äôs not a gem.\n\nHis writing career started early ‚Äì he sold his first short story at age 19, and his first novel, Revolt on Alpha C when he was only 20 years old. The novel would win him a 1956 Hugo for Best New Writer, and marked his entry into the world of science fiction publishing. For the next four years he wrote steadily for a handful of science fiction and fantasy magazines under the auspices of Frederick Pohl. Silverberg showed an uncanny ability to write what publishers and editors wanted, and this was both a blessing and a curse.\n\nI was introduced to Silverberg‚Äôs works through a much later series, his famous Valentine series, written in the 1980‚Äôs. A sci-fantasy series following Lord Valentine and his adventures on the futuristic planet of Majipoor, I recall being fairly speechless after reading the first volume, Lord Valentine‚Äôs Castle. My other half was concerned that my silence indicated I didn‚Äôt care for the story. Quite the opposite in fact, I clearly recall telling him that I wanted to learn how to juggle, and if we were to ever have a son that his first name would be Valentine. I read other books in the Valentine series as I can find them, but I‚Äôve yet to learn how to juggle.\n\nI went on to read Silverberg‚Äôs Dying Inside, which was recently republished by Orb books. Part of his earlier oeuvre, Dying Inside is about a telepath whose powers are slowly evaporating. It is a tragic and beautiful story, showing off Silverberg‚Äôs formal education in comparative literature. Dying Inside is the opposite of much of the pulp that Silverberg had been putting out en masse throughout the 1950s and 1960s. A few Silverberg titles later, and I was officially hooked.\n\nOver his 50+ years of writing, Silverberg has published in a massive variety of genres: science fiction, fantasy, mysteries, westerns, historical fiction, even adult erotica. There is plenty of pulp (much written under pseudonyms) in there, but plenty of gems as well, and he‚Äôs got Nebulas and Hugos to prove it. In 2004 Silverberg was presented with the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award from the SFWA.\n\nHe‚Äôs published nearly as much non-fiction as he has fiction, and if you have any history books from the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs by Lloyd Robinson, Franklin Hamilton, Lee Sebastian or Walker Chapman, you‚Äôve got yourself a Silverberg.\n\nStay tuned for my review of Silverberg‚Äôs Regan‚Äôs Planet.\n\nFor more information on Robert Silverberg, visit Majipoor.com, the Unofficial Robert Silverberg site, run by the dedicated and talented Jon Davis. Mr. Davis has cataloged everything Silverberg ever wrote under ever pseudonym he ever used, and there were a lot of them along with links to interview and excerpts of his books.\n\nRobert Silverberg currently lives in California.\n\nHave you read any Silverberg? what did you think of him? What Silverberg titles would you recommend to someone looking to start reading his work?"
