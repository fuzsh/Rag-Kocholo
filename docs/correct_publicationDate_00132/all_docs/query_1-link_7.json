        "text": "Robert Silverberg is an American science fiction author and editor. He’s a legend in the science fiction industry and won his first Hugo Award in 1956 for Best New Writer. He was known for his speed as a writer and in 1965 was said to have wrote and sold at least 50,000 words per week.\n\nThe constant writing led to big growths as a writer and his later writings were “deeply detailed, highly educated, beautifully figured books” according to Algis Burdys. In his personal life, Silverberg was married twice. He married his second wife, fellow sci-fi writer Karen Haber, in 1987 and that one stuck. The two live in the San Francisco area to this day.\n\nPublication Order of Dragonflight Books\n\nPublication Order of Gilgamesh Books\n\nPublication Order of Legends Books\n\nPublication Order of Majipoor: Lord Prestimion Books\n\nPublication Order of Majipoor: Lord Valentine Books\n\nPublication Order of Millenium Books\n\nPublication Order of New Dimensions Books\n\nPublication Order of New Springtime Books\n\nPublication Order of Nidorian Books\n\n(as Robert Randall)\n\nPublication Order of Regan Books\n\nPublication Order of Stellar Guild Books\n\nPublication Order of Time Gate Books\n\nPublication Order of Collected Stories Of Robert Silverberg Books\n\nPublication Order of Standalone Novels\n\nPublication Order of Short Stories/Novellas\n\nPublication Order of Short Story Collections\n\nPublication Order of Graphic Novels\n\n(with Philippe Thirault, Sean Jordan)\n\nPublication Order of Non-Fiction Books\n\nPublication Order of Robert Silverberg Omnibus Books\n\nPublication Order of Fire in Winter Books\n\n(with Karen Haber)\n\nPublication Order of Isaac Asimov's Wonderful Worlds Of Science Fiction Books\n\nPublication Order of Best Science Fiction of the Year Books\n\nPublication Order of The Men's Adventure Library Journal Books\n\nPublication Order of Anthologies\n\nIf You Like Robert Silverberg Books, You’ll Love…\n\nPoul Anderson\n\nArthur C. Clarke\n\nGreg Bear\n\nA Time of Changes was Silverberg’s 1971 Nebula Award winning novel. This book shows a far-future where humanity has moved beyond Earth to other planets. Those planets are no longer colonies, but homes of their own for their inhabitants. On of the strangest of these planets is Borthan, where the worst obscenities are the words “I” and “me.” They call it “self-baring” and it is a crime punishable by death. A visitor from Earth meets a Prince on this planet and open his eyes to a different way of living. He’ll have to risk everything to teach his people what he believes it is to be human.\n\nLord Valentine’s Castle is the first book in the Majipoor Cycle series of books. This book follows a man named Valentine who has no memories and no past. He travels across the vast lands of the magical plent of Majipoor in search of what he’s lost with a motley crew of entertainers. He begins to get answers, not from a person, but in the form of his dreams. The dreams tell him that he is much more than he seems and that it’s time to return home."
