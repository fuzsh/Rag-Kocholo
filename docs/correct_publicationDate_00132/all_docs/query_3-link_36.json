A prolific author, he has won the field’s prestigious Nebula and Hugo awards and has received more award nominations for his work than any other writer in the genre. Interestingly, despite his prominence in the field, Silverberg’s science fiction makes up only a portion of his total production—indeed, he has even left the field entirely to work in other genres on two separate occasions. Much of Silverberg’s work has been nonfiction, reflecting his interests in such varied topics as archaeology, conservation, history, and the natural sciences. He has received awards for several of these nonfiction books, while his Mound Builders of Ancient America: The Archaeology of a Myth has been hailed as one of the standard works on the subject. Still, this considerable success in the nonfiction field is overshadowed by his continuing popularity among science-fiction fans. As George R.R. Martin, writing in the Washington Post Book World, observed, Silverberg “is best known and best regarded for his work within science fiction.”\n\nSilverberg began his writing career while still a student at Columbia University in the 1950s. He had decided to become a science-fiction writer because of his own reaction to the genre as a boy. He told Jeffrey M. Elliot in Science Fiction Voices #2: “When I was a boy, I read science fiction and it did wonderful things for me. It opened the universe to me. I feel a sense of obligation to science fiction to replace what I had taken from it, to add to the shelf, to put something there for someone else that would do for them what other writers had done for me.” Silverberg’s first sales were to the science fiction magazines of the 1950s, and his first book, Revolt on Alpha C (1955), was a juvenile science-fiction novel. Upon graduation from Columbia in 1956, he became a full-time freelance writer. His work was already so popular that the World Science Fiction Convention, a gathering of the genre’s devotees, voted to give him the Hugo Award as the best new writer of 1955. At the time, Silverberg was only twenty years old.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Silverberg produced hundreds of stories for the science fiction magazines. His production was so voluminous that he was obliged to publish much of this work under a host of pseudonyms. Silverberg recalled that time to Charles Platt in Dream Makers: The Uncommon People Who Write Science Fiction: “I was courted by editors considerably back then, because I was so dependable; if they said, ‘Give me a story by next Thursday,’ I would.” George W. Tuma characterized these early stories in the Dictionary of Literary Biography as “conform[ing] closely to the conventions of science fiction: alien beings, technological gadgetry, standard plot devices, confrontations between [Earthlings] and extraterrestrial beings, and so forth.”\n\nIn 1959, a downturn in sales forced many science-fiction magazines out of business. No longer able to support himself by writing for the genre—and somewhat disillusioned by the formulaic nature of the work desired by publishers—Silverberg instead turned to writing articles for popular magazines, maintaining his high level of production by turning out two pieces every working day. By the early 1960s, he began writing juvenile nonfiction, a career transition he once recalled with some relief to CA. “I severed my connections with my sleazy magazine outlets and ascended into this new, astoundingly respectable and rewarding career,” he explained. In a few years Silverberg established himself as one of the most successful nonfiction writers in the country, publishing books about Antarctica, ancient Egypt, the U.S. space program, medical history, and a host of other topics for young readers. “I was considered one of the most skilled popularizers of the sciences in the United States,” the author remembered.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Silverberg maintained a rapid writing pace, publishing nearly two million words per year, not only juvenile nonfiction works but science-fiction novels, such as the highly praised Collision Course, 1963’s The Silent Invaders; many short SF stories; and rewrites of many of his earlier novels. He told Elliot that he managed to write prolifically due to intense concentration. “I concentrated on a point source and the words just came out right,” the author recalled.\n\nHowever, the years of prolific writing finally ended in the mid-1960s. Silverberg later cited two factors for the slowdown in his production at that time. The first was a hyperactive thyroid gland, brought on by prolonged overwork, which forced him in 1966 to slow his working pace considerably. The second factor was a fire in early 1968 at Silverberg’s New York City home. This fire, he once told CA, “drained from me, evidently forever, much of the bizarre energy that had allowed me to write a dozen or more significant books in a single year.”\n\nDespite the drop in production, the late 1960s found the author embarking on more experimental science-fiction writing. In fact, it is the work from this period that most observers credit as the beginning of his serious fiction in the genre. Thomas D. Clareson, although noting in his book Robert Silverberg that “from the beginning, he was a skilled storyteller,” marked 1969 to 1976 the period when Silverberg “conducted his most deliberate experiments and attained the most consistent command of his material.” 1967’s Thorns has been cited as the author’s transitional work through its focus on not only the physical universe, but the inner, psychic universe as reflected by philosophical, psychological, and social elements. In the novel, human protagonist Minner Burris has been physically altered to conform to beings on the planet Manipol. On Manipol, while now accepted for his appearance, Burris is emotionally isolated from native Manipolians due to his social, cultural, and psychological differences. Eventually returning to Earth, he finds himself rejected due to his unusual appearance. Burris’s resulting alienation from human society is contrasted with that of other characters, whose circumstances have set them apart while their inner natures continue to need the contact of fellow humans.\n\nIn part, the change in Silverberg’s science fiction of the late 1960s reflected shifts in the field as a whole. The New Wave, a movement of writers (including Silverberg) trying to break out of the genre’s pulp formulas and utilize the techniques of modernist literature, had a powerful influence on many writers in the field. New subjects and approaches were suddenly suitable for commercial science fiction. Referring to such novels as Nightwings (1969) and Hawksbill Station (1968) in an article in the New York Times Book Review, Theodore Sturgeon maintained that Silverberg “changed into something quite new and different—his own man, saying his own things his own way, and doing it with richness and diversity.” Tuma also saw a transformation in Silverberg’s work, stating that the author finally “found his unique approach to science fiction, in terms of both content and writing style.” Speaking of the novels Thorns and Hawksbill Station, as well as of the story “To See the Invisible Man,” Stableford saw Silverberg as using “science fictional ideas to dramatize situations of extreme alienation.”\n\nAs Silverberg sought to extend the range of science fiction, his experiments with style and narrative structure continued into the 1970s. “Having already proved that he could write every kind of SF story at least as well as anyone else,” Gerald Jonas commented in the New York Times Book Review, “Silverberg set out… to stretch both the genre and himself.” In 1971’s Son of Man, for example, Silverberg writes of a series of bizarre adventure sequences set on “not the physical planet Earth but the Earth of human perception—the model world of the mind,” as Stableford related. Clay, the novel’s aptly named protagonist, time-shifts to the future, where he meets several species of humanoids that have evolved in differing directions. In this future world, communication between beings involves sexual contact, and Clay eventually experiences unity and transcendence through understanding the heightened significance of physical union.\n\nDespite the fact that his new approach in his work put Silverberg in the forefront of the science fiction field—“By the 1970s Silverberg was writing science fiction much as such of his contemporaries as Barth, Reed, Bartheleme, and Coover were presenting their renditions of everyday American life,” Clareson commented in Voices for the Future: Essays on Major Science-Fiction Writers— Silverberg was dissatisfied with the response to his work. His books won awards, but their sales were poor and they often met with uninformed critical comments from science fiction purists. “I was at first bewildered by the response I was getting from the audience, ” Silverberg told Platt. “There are passages in Dying Inside or in Nightwings which I think are sheer ecstatic song, but people would come up to me and say, ‘Why do you write such depressing books?’ Something was wrong.” By 1975 all of Silverberg’s more serious books, upon which he had placed such importance, were out of print. At that point he announced his retirement from science fiction.\n\nFor the next four years, Silverberg wrote no new science fiction. Instead, he devoted his time to the garden of his California home. “I had had my career,” the author once recalled to CA. “Now I had my garden.” But in 1978 he was pushed back into the field after he and his first wife separated and she required a house of her own. To raise the necessary money, Silverberg decided to write “one last book.” The result, Lord Valentine’s Castle, was a massive novel that set a record (for its time) when it was offered to publishers at auction. Harper & Row paid the largest sum ever given for a science fiction novel, $127,500. Silverberg was a writer again.\n\nIn Lord Valentine’s Castle, Silverberg mixes elements from science fiction and heroic fantasy. The science-fiction elements include a far-future setting, the imaginary planet of Majipoor, and a host of exotic alien life forms. However, the plot is common to the fantasy genre. It involves a quest by the exiled prince of a distant planet to regain the throne of Majipoor, right the ancient wrong of dispossession committed against the planet’s original inhabitants, the primitive Metamorph peoples, and rejuvenate his own self-confidence. The clever combination of genre elements was praised by Jack Sullivan in the New York Times Book Review. Sullivan described Lord Valentine’s Castle as “an imaginative fusion of action, sorcery and science fiction, with visionary adventure scenes undergirded by scientific explanations.” In his book Robert Silverberg, Clareson stated that “whatever else it does, Lord Valentine’s Castle demands that its readers re-examine the relationship between science fiction and fantasy, for in this narrative Silverberg has fused the two together.”\n\nThe rich diversity of the planet Majipoor was remarked upon by several reviewers, including Patrick Parrinder, writing in the Times Literary Supplement. “Silverberg’s invention,” Parrinder wrote, “is prodigious throughout. The early sections… are a near-encyclopaedia of unnatural wonders and weird ecosystems. I suspect this book breaks all records in the coinage of new species.” John Charnay, writing in the Los Angeles Times Book Review, although believing the book “lacks depth of dialogue and emotion to match the grandeur of scenery and plot,” still found that “Silverberg’s inventiveness is intriguing.”\n\nThe success of Lord Valentine’s Castle drew Silverberg back into the writing life. He began to write stories for Omni magazine, where several old friends were working. In 1982 he published Majipoor Chronicles, a novel fashioned from several short stories set on the planet introduced in Lord Valentine’s Castle. Each story is an episode from Majipoor’s history, which has been stored on an experience-record. By using a futuristic reading machine, a young boy is able to relive these historical events. “As a result,” Michael Bishop commented in the Washington Post Book World, “the stories become something more than stories—vivid initiation experiences in the boy’s struggle to manhood. A neat trick, this.”\n\nWith the novel Valentine Pontifex, Silverberg did what he had once vowed he would never do: write a sequel to Lord Valentine’s Castle. Colin Greenland, writing in the Times Literary Supplement, who had maintained that Lord Valentine’s Castle was a weak novel that “satisfied readers’ wishes for a great big safe world where nice things flourish and evil succumbs to forgiveness,” saw Silverberg’s sequel as an “act of conscience for Lord Valentine’s Castle.” In Valentine Pontifex, Lord Valentine, now restored to his position as ruler of Maji-poor, faces opposition from the Piurivars, an aboriginal race dispossessed years before by Earthling colonists. The Piurivars release plagues and deadly bio-engineered creatures upon the humans. Finding that “the lazy pace through time and space” found in Lord Valentine’s Castle gives way in this novel “to a dance of conflicting emotions and political intrigue,” a reviewer for the Voice Literary Supplement regarded Lord Valentine’s Castle, Majipoor Chronicles, and Valentine Pontifex as related works forming a loose trilogy that “becomes a whole in a way that the form rarely achieves.”\n\nSilverberg continued the Majipoor series with The Mountains of Majipoor, Sorcerers of Majipoor, and Lord Prestimion. The Mountains of Majipoor “is a modest story,” recounted Roland Green in Booklist, “but the marvelously well realized world of Majipoor and Silverberg’s graceful prose carry it along in a fashion that most lovers of Majipoor will find highly satisfying.” Lord Prestimion, published in 1999, was also well received by critics. Jackie Cassada in Library Journal wrote: “Silverberg excels at balancing strong characters and complex plotting to achieve a rare example of epic fantasy told with a scientist’s eye for detail.”\n\nIn the years since his return from self-imposed “early retirement,” Silverberg has continued his work in the genre with both novels and short stories that expand upon his view of future worlds. Among those are 1988’s At Winter’s End, the following year’s To the Land of the Living, and Kingdoms of the Wall, which Silverberg published in 1993. Compared by one reviewer to the works of nineteenth-century fantasy writer Lord Dunsany, Kingdoms of the Wall follows the pilgrimage of a group of young alien beings to the summit of a daunting mountain range called Kosa Saag, or “the Wall.” The purpose of the pilgrimage is to learn from the gods who live at that great height. Traditionally, few pilgrims have ever returned from this annual trip, and none have ever returned sane. On the way, the group passes through numerous “worlds” at different levels of the mountains’ ascent, at one point coming across a space traveler, an “Irtiman” (Earthman), who has been stranded on their planet. He is weak from hunger and eventually dies. Finally, nearing the summit, the surviving members of the group are tempted to end their quest when they discover a land of magic where they can remain perpetually young. New York Times Book Review critic Gerald Jonas viewed the work as a religious parable “about the dangers of seeking more intimate contact with the powers that control the universe.” Disregarding the novel’s social or spiritual implications, Paul Di-Filippo lauded Kingdoms of the Wall in his Washington Post Book World review “for its first two-thirds, pure witchery, a Bosch-like canvas of strange creatures and places.… Kingdoms of the Wall proves once more, if it needed proving, that scaling and comprehending Robert Silverberg is just as exciting as tackling Kosa Saag.”\n\nIn Hot Sky at Midnight Silverberg examines the ecologic horrors that could result from an Earth polluted almost beyond habitability. Most areas of the planet cannot sustain life, and even in the more livable areas, residents must wear breathing masks and protect themselves from the sun with injections of a substance called screen, which darkens their skin. Huge stations in orbit around the planet provide more hospitable environments for humans. Victor Farkas, a blind corporate representative with heightened senses, travels to one of these stations, Nuevo Valparaiso, in search of a prodigiously talented genetic scientist who has fled the planet’s surface. Elsewhere on Earth, Nick Rhodes is CEO of a company involved in dubious experiments to create a new breed of humans hardy enough to survive in the harsh environment of the devastated Earth. Silverberg “delivers powerful images of a world blighted by ecological abuse, and a satisfying novel as well,” remarked a Publishers Weekly reviewer.\n\nStarborne finds humanity on the cusp of colonizing new worlds when the first interstellar exploration mission is launched. Aboard the starship Wotan are fifty young, brilliant scientists, all assigned the mission of finding and claiming a new and healthy outpost for the human race. They maintain contact with Earth via a crewmember named Noelle, a blind telepath. Their first attempt to explore a promising new world proves deadly, however, and the disastrous mission results in a dead crewmember and apparent damage to Noelle’s telepathic link to Earth. As the story progresses, the crew of the Wotan starts to believe that an outside alien force is interfering with their attempt to establish a foothold for mankind on other worlds. Booklist critic Carl Hays called the novel a “profound, masterfully rendered chronicle of humanity’s first voyage to the stars.”\n\nMany of Silverberg’s works have been supplemented in bookstores by reprints and limited editions of earlier, often unpublished works. His 1964 nonfiction work, Great Adventures in Archaeology, which contained the stories of ten working archaeologists of the time, was reprinted in 2002. Library Journal reviewer Michael Rogers mused that the “spirit of adventure is alive” within the book. In the Beginning: Tales from the Pulp Era contains sixteen of Silverberg’s earliest science fiction stories from the nascent years of the genre, as well as “autobiographical insights, glimpses into his creative process, and a mini-history of SF’s flaming pulp youth,” observed a Publishers Weekly reviewer. Though the stories are often rough-hewn and lacking in the subtlety and nuance of craft that would characterize Silverberg’s later work, they “do the job they were expected to do: entertain,” commented Booklist reviewer Regina Schroeder. To Be Continued: The Collected Stories of Robert Silverberg, Volume 1, inaugurates a series intended to gather together the majority of the author’s output. The first volume opens with his very first short fiction sale, “The Gorgon Years,” and includes two dozen tales from the first five years of Silverberg’s career, from 1953 to 1958. The collected tales in this volume “illustrate his apprenticeship and presage the Grand Master he has become,” observed a reviewer in Publishers Weekly. The second volume, To the Dark Star, 1962-69: The Collected Stories of Robert Silverberg, includes twenty-one stories that comprise Silverberg’s “first notable work,” pieces that will allow modern, younger readers of science fiction to “finally learn what all the completely justifiable fuss was about, commented another Publishers Weekly contributor.\n\nSeveral other collections have drawn together some of Silverberg’s best short fiction from the 1970s and 1980s. The Conglomeroid Cocktail Party, released in 1984, collects several short stories from the early 1980s. Stan Gebler Davies, writing in Punch, praised Silverberg’s ability to portray time travel realistically. Citing included works, such as “Needles in a Timestack” and “Jennifer’s Lover,” Davies noted that “SSilverberg is hooked on time-travel and comes as near as any writer to getting away with it.” Also with the publication of the first part of The Collected Stories of Robert Silverberg in 1992, Silverberg devotees were able to sample twenty-four of his most critically acclaimed short stories of the 1980s. In addition to the novella “Sailing to Byzantium,” winner of the Nebula Award, and Enter a Soldier. Later: Enter Another,” a Hugo winner, are lesser-known but equally well-written works, each prefaced by the author’s own introduction, which puts the story into the context of the author’s total oeuvre. James Sallis, in a Los Angeles Times Book Review piece, observed of Silverberg: “This man who speaks so insistently of simple craftsmanship again and again delivers, surreptitiously and a little abashedly, it seems, a rare kind of art.”\n\nIn addition to his voluminous work as a writer, Silverberg has also influenced science fiction with his work as an editor. For example, in Far Horizons: All New Tales from the Greatest Worlds of Science Fiction, Silverberg collects tales from notable authors who use the stories to revisit worlds and venues they popularized in their longer works. Orson Scott Card contributes a story related to his Ender series; Joe Haldeman goes back to the world he created in The Forever War; Ursula K. LeGuin again writes of the universe portrayed in her novel The Left Hand of Darkness; and Frederick Pohl revisits the Heechee. The stories “deliver good first-contact experiences for series novices as well as happy reading for longtime fans,” commented Sally Estes in Booklist. Library Journal critic Jackie Cassada named the book a “ssampler of the best of the genre.” Legends: Short Novels by the Masters of Modern Fantasy and Legends II: New Short Novels by the Masters of Modern Fantasy serve a similar function for the fantasy genre, allowing noted writers to craft new adventures in their familiar fantasy worlds. In Legends, Stephen King pens a new tale for his Dark Tower series; Terry Pratchett offers a new Discworld story; Raymond Feist writes from his Riftwar universe; and Silverberg himself contributes a new work based in Majipoor. Booklist reviewer Ray Olson called Legends II “excellent introductions for newcomers to the authors’ series: solid fare for established readers.”\n\nOver a writing career spanning several decades, Silverberg has produced an immense body of original fiction in several genres, authored numerous nonfiction works, and edited several highly praised collections. Commenting on Silverberg’s diversity, Martin reflected that “few writers, past or present, have had careers quite as varied, dramatic, and contradictory as that of Robert Silverberg.” As a writer of nonfiction, Silverberg has enjoyed success, but as a writer of science fiction, he is among a handful of writers who have helped to shape the field into what it is today. He is, Elliot declared, “a titan in the science fiction field.” There are “few science fiction readers,” Elliot continued, who “have not been enriched and inspired by his contributions to the genre, contributions which reflect his love of the field, and his deep respect for its readers.”\n\nIn his introduction to Galactic Dreamers: Science Fiction as Visionary Literature, Silverberg explains what he has been striving to attain in his work: “To show the reader something he has never been able to see with his own eyes, something strange and unique, beautiful and troubling, which draws him for a moment out of himself, places him in contact with the vastness of the universe, gives him for a sizzling moment a communion with the fabric of space and time, and leaves him forever transformed, forever enlarged.”\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nAldiss, Brian, and Harry Harrison, editors, Hell’s Cartographers: Some Personal Histories of Science-Fiction Writers, Harper (New York, NY), 1975.\n\nChildren’s Literature Review, Volume 59, Gale (Detroit, MI), 2000.\n\nClareson, Thomas D., editor, Voices for the Future: Essays on Major Science Fiction Writers, Volume 2, Bowling Green State University Popular Press (Bowling Green, OH), 1976.\n\nClareson, Thomas D., Robert Silverberg, Starmont House (New York, NY), 1983.\n\nClareson, Thomas D., Robert Silverberg: A Primary and Secondary Bibliography, G.K.
