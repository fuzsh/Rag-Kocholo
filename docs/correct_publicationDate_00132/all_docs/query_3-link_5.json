Kuhn Library & Gallery\n\nSpecial Collections\n\nUMBC\n\nhttp://aok.lib.umbc.edu/specoll/popcul.php\n\nThe Prodigy\n\nThe youngest science fiction author ever to earn a Hugo award, Robert Silverberg�s ascendance to the ranks of science fiction divinity commenced in the early 1950s as a budding pulp magazine talent.\n\nWith the publication of his first novel, Revolt on Alpha C, in 1955, the youthful writer was ushered into the professional arena and a literary career was born.\n\nStarblaze Editions, 1979\n\nBallantine Books, 1966\n\nAce Books, 1961\n\nAce Books, 1962\n\nCareer\n\nArbor House, 1982\n\nHis was a career that would see a mind-boggling production of published works including short fiction and nonfiction stories, novels, and anthologies for which the publishing industry could not be sated.\n\nNonetheless, it is Silverberg�s science fiction creations and particularly his supremely successful Majipoor series that would serve as the talismans of his success.\n\nThe Psychology of a Silverberg Character\n\nWarner Books, 1990\n\nRobert Silverberg�s later science fiction writings are notably distinguished for their character emphasis. Whether victim or villain, human or beast, Silverberg�s fictional characters possess a pulsing vitality and mortal quality of their own. They suffer pain, misfortune, and isolation but, true to their creator�s nature, they inevitably discover transcendence from their ills.\n\nWhile initially dark in theme, it is this empathetic style that has become exceedingly popular and made Robert Silverberg an enduring figure in the fickle realm of science fiction publishing.\n\nHis Legacy\n\nAvon Books, 1969\n\nBallantine Books, 1972\n\nCherished classics such as Nightwings, Dying Inside, The Book of Skulls, and the Majipoor trilogy have reaped Robert Silverberg numerous science fiction recognitions.\n\nAmong the most prestigious awards are 3 Hugo Awards, 5 Nebulas, the Jupiter, and the Prix Apollo. Silverberg was also presented with the Grandmaster Award by the Science Fiction Writers of America.\n\nContinued Excellence\n\nThese days, Robert Silverberg concentrates his boundless talents on churning out a fresh flow of science fiction novels. The most current results of his energies include the final books of the Majipoor Trilogy, as well as newcomers such as The Alien Years and The Longest Way Home.\n\nClearly, it is a relief to Silverberg�s vast readership that a writing career birthed in the imagination of youth and fed on the labors of prodigious production and determination has yet to rest its pen.\n\nSignet, 1971\n\nWarner Books, 1970\n\nAce Books, 1958\n\nWarner Books, 1990\n\nCredits\n\nSpecial thanks to Amy McGarrahan (Special Collections Intern) and Nicole Smith (Special Collections Student Assistant) for their work on this project.\n\nThis presentation was created in HTML using CSS.
