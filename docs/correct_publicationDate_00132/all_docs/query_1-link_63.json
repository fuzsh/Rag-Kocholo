        "text": "I had a big new Westeros book published last year (official publication date November 20, 2018) — FIRE & BLOOD, covering the history of the Targaryen kings from Aegon’s Conquest to the regency of Aegon III. It’s been doing rather well, thank you. Debuted at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list and is still in the top ten two months later. And just last week, we got a great review in KIRKUS, a notoriously tough journal.\n\nThe question of its Hugo eligibility is… well, trickier than usual.\n\nFIRE & BLOOD is eligible, certainly. But what category does it belong in?\n\nThere’s Best Novel, the “Big One” A DANCE WITH DRAGONS, A FEAST FOR CROWS, and A STORM OF SWORDS were all nominated for the Best Novel Hugo in years past (they all lost, to be sure, but never mind). In all of the promotional interviews I did leading up to the book’s release, however, I took pains to stress that FIRE & BLOOD was not a novel but rather a work of imaginary history (I used to say “fake history,” but some of my readers objected). I did not want anyone buying the book under the misapprehension that it was the latest volume in A SONG OF ICE & FIRE. After saying over and over again “this is not a novel,” it would be rather disingenuous of me to accept a Hugo (should it win, which I must admit is rather unlikely) or even a nomination in the Best Novel category.\n\nAlas, there is no Hugo category for “Best Imaginary History.”\n\nIt has been pointed out to me that the publication of FIRE & BLOOD makes me eligible for nomination in the new (relatively) Best Series category. Well, yes, I suppose. It depends on one’s definition of what constitutes a series. Worldcon’s definition is considerably broader than my own, for what it’s worth. Many SF writers have set their stories against a common background or “future history,” a term originated by Heinlein and popularized by Campbell. My own Thousand Worlds stories fit that template, but I don’t consider them a series. They share a background, but that’s all; except for the Tuf stories, there are no recurring characters, and the tales are set hundreds of years and hundreds of light years apart. (The Haviland Tuf stories, a subset of my Thousand Worlds, ARE a series, as I define the term). At the other extreme, you have what I’ll call “mega-novels,” stories spread across many books because of length. Tolkien’s LORD OF THE RINGS was not a series, as I see it, but one long novel published in three volumes.\n\nThose are my definitions, however. Not worldcon’s. The Hugo rules are much looser, and would seem to include future histories, mega-novels, and true series all in the same Best Series category.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I do not consider A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE to be a series. It’s one story. A huge complicated story, admittedly, one that will take seven volumes to tell (once I finish the last two). And in any case, FIRE & BLOOD is not strictly speaking a part of A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE. It’s imaginary history set hundreds of years before any of the characters in SONG were born. Yes, I suppose if you bundle FIRE & BLOOD, the five ASOI&F novels, and the three Dunk & Eggs novellas (collected as A KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS) together, you have a series of sorts. I wouldn’t even know what to call it. The Westeros series? The Seven Kingdoms series? Not GAME OF THRONES or ICE & FIRE, certainly. So…\n\nI don’t know.\n\nSo… if not Best Novel, and not Best Series, where would FIRE & BLOOD fit on the Hugo ballot? If anywhere?\n\nMy suggestion: Best Related Work.\n\nThat seems to be the best description of what the book actually is. It’s an imaginary history, related to five published ICE & FIRE novels, but not a novel and not a part of that story. A WORLD OF ICE & FIRE, the concordance we published several years ago, was its closest precursor. That volume got some nominations in Best Related Work, though it did not come close to making the final five. But there’s a precedent of sorts, so…\n\nIf you read and enjoyed FIRE & BLOOD and would like to nominate it for a Hugo, I would urge you to consider Related Work rather than Novel or Series. (If you haven’t read it yet, hey, you can still get autographed copies from the bookshop at the Jean Cocteau Cinema).\n\nAnd while I am the subject of the Best Related Work Hugo, let me make a recommendation that has nothing whatsoever to do with my own work (though my name is mentioned once, fwiw): ASTOUNDING, by Alec Nevala-Lee, an amazing and engrossing history of John W. Campbell Jr and his authors, Isaac Asimov, L. Ron Hubbard, and Robert A. Heinlein. Insightful, entertaining, and compulsively readable, it brings Campbell and his era back to life. I thought I knew a lot about Astounding, Campbell, and his authors, but Nevala-Lee goes way way deeper than any previous history I’ve read, and his book is full of stuff I never knew. Of course, I’d love to have my own book nominated (I value the Hugo more than any other award), but I suspect that ASTOUNDING will win the rocket in the end. It certainly deserves to.\n\nCurrent Mood: confused\n\nIt was twenty years ago today Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play. But for the guys in the band, it probably did not seem that long.\n\nA GAME OF THRONES was published in 1996. In 2016, to celebrate the twentienth anniversary, Bantam Spectra published a special deluxe leatherbound edition of the novel, lavishly and beautifully illustrated, with an introduction by John Hodgman.\n\nThe anniversary edition was a big success, and is still selling strongly two years later. (If you’d like to snag an autographed copy, you can get one from the bookstore at the Jean Cocteau. We are out of stock at the moment, but we have more on order, and I will be defacing them with my illegible scrawl as soon as they come in — which will, alas, probably not be in time for Xmas).\n\nSo… drum roll please… we’ve going to do it again.\n\nThe second volume of A Song of Ice and Fire, A CLASH OF KINGS, was published in 1999. (Seems like yesterday, honestly. And I still recall the three years between books, when readers would email me to ask what was taking so long for book two, since Other Fantasy Author [fill in your choice] put out a book a year, rain or shine, and why was I taking so long? Sigh. Those were the days, when I was only two years late). Next year will mark the twentieth anniversary of its release, so Bantam Spectra will be doing a deluxe leatherbound edition of CLASH as well.\n\nAs with GOT, the anniversary edition will be lavishly illustrated with both color plates and black and white.\n\nOur artist this time around will be an amazing young talent named LAUREN CANNON. You can see some samples of her work on her own website, here: http://navate.com/ I love her paintings, and we’re all looking forward to working with her, and seeing her unique take on my world and characters.\n\nCurrent Mood: cheerful\n\nIt’s been a couple of very exciting weeks for me and Archmaester Gyldayn.\n\nMy trip back east was a lot of fun, and hugely productive. I got to have Thanksgiving with my family in Jersey for the first time in more than a decade, I checked in with my editors, publishers, and agents, I had a blast on LATE NIGHT WITH STEPHEN COLBERT… and I signed 1600 copies of FIRE & BLOOD for the big launch at Loew’s Jersey. Being on the stage of that magnificent old movie palace with my friend John Hodgman, seeing my name on the marquee of a theatre where I saw BEN-HUR and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA as a kid in days gone by… there are no words for that.\n\nAnd the fans were great as well. Their excitement and enthusiasm was palpable. My thanks to everyone who came out… and to all of you who were not able to get tickets as well. Sorry about that. (The Friends of the Loew’s hope to have their balcony restored for the next time I return, which will mean a thousand more seats).\n\nFIRE & BLOOD was released the day after the Loew’s event, November 20… in the US, in the United Kingdom, and in various other countries around the world, where my translators had to work around the clock to get the translation done in time to allow simultaneous publication with the English editions. A number of them did just that, and my hat is off to them. Great work, folks.\n\nNo one really knew how well the book would do, least of all me. It’s a Westeros book, yes… but not a traditional novel, and not part of the SONG OF ICE AND FIRE/ GAME OF THRONES sequence. How would my readers react to a book of imaginary history?\n\nI’m thrilled to say that they have reacted very well.\n\nFIRE & BLOOD debuted at #1 on the NEW YORK TIMES bestseller list, for hardcover fiction.\n\nFIRE & BLOOD also debuted at #1 for the TIMES list in the United Kingdom.\n\nI’m informed that we were also #1 in Brazil, #2 in Spain, #5 in Germany, and #8 in France.\n\n(Other countries will need to wait on the translations).\n\nNeedless to say, I am thrilled. My thanks go out to Anne Groell, Scott Shannon, and David Moench, my team at Bantam Spectra, to Jane Johnson at Harper Collins Voyager in the UK, to my amazing agents Kay McCauley and Chris Lotts, and to all my editors and publishers and translators around the world. And thanks as well to the booksellers, without whose support those bestseller lists would not have been possible.\n\nAnd most of all, my thanks go out to my fans and readers. I know you want WINDS, and I am going to give it to you… but I am delighted that you stayed with me for this one as well. Your patience and unflagging support means the world to me.\n\nEnjoy the read. Me, I am back in my fortress of solitude, and back in Westeros. It won’t be tomorrow, and it won’t be next week, but you will get the end of A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE. Meanwhile, you have the final season of GAME OF THRONES coming, and the new show that is not yet officially called THE LONG NIGHT being cast, and a couple more shows still being scripted… and a few other cool things in the works as well.\n\nWinter is not the only thing that is coming.\n\nCurrent Mood: excited\n\nI am getting a flood of emails and off-topic comments on this blog about tonight’s episode of GAME OF THRONES. It’s not unanticipated.\n\nThe comments… regardless of tone… have been deleted. I have been saying since season one that this is not the place to debate or discuss the TV series. Please respect that.\n\nThere are better places for such discussions: Westeros, Tower of the Hand, Watchers on the Wall, Winter Is Coming, the comments sections of the television critics who regularly follow the show: James Hibberd, Alyssa Rosenberg, Mo Ryan, James Poniewozik, and their colleagues. I am sure all those sites will be having a healthy debate.\n\nI have a lot of fans asking me for comment.\n\nLet me reiterate what I have said before.\n\nHow many children did Scarlett O’Hara have? Three, in the novel. One, in the movie. None, in real life: she was a fictional character, she never existed. The show is the show, the books are the books; two different tellings of the same story.\n\nThere have been differences between the novels and the television show since the first episode of season one. And for just as long, I have been talking about the butterfly effect. Small changes lead to larger changes lead to huge changes. HBO is more than forty hours into the impossible and demanding task of adapting my lengthy (extremely) and complex (exceedingly) novels, with their layers of plots and subplots, their twists and contradictions and unreliable narrators, viewpoint shifts and ambiguities, and a cast of characters in the hundreds.\n\nThere has seldom been any TV series as faithful to its source material, by and large (if you doubt that, talk to the Harry Dresden fans, or readers of the Sookie Stackhouse novels, or the fans of the original WALKING DEAD comic books)… but the longer the show goes on, the bigger the butterflies become. And now we have reached the point where the beat of butterfly wings is stirring up storms, like the one presently engulfing my email.\n\nProse and television have different strengths, different weaknesses, different requirements.\n\nDavid and Dan and Bryan and HBO are trying to make the best television series that they can.\n\nAnd over here I am trying to write the best novels that I can.\n\nAnd yes, more and more, they differ. Two roads diverging in the dark of the woods, I suppose… but all of us are still intending that at the end we will arrive at the same place.\n\nIn the meantime, we hope that the readers and viewers both enjoy the journey. Or journeys, as the case may be. Sometimes butterflies grow into dragons.\n\n((I am closing comments on this post. Take your discussions to the other sites I have mentioned. And for those who may be curious as to the road the books are taking, I direct you to the WINDS OF WINTER sample chapters on my website))."
