        "text": "Ron Howard’s In the Heart of Sea sets sail with barrels of drama aboard, explores dudes being dudes and unleashes the most fearsome seabound villain this starboard side of Jaws.\n\nThe Oscar-winning director’s adaptation (*** out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday) of Nathaniel Philbrick’s novel doubles as a thriller and disaster film, though the plot seems shallow before the whaling ship Essex sets out and after it gets destroyed by one extraordinarily ticked-off marine mammal.\n\nThe legend of the real-life gigantic sperm whale inspired Herman Melville to pen his masterpiece Moby-Dick. In the movie, Melville (played by Ben Whishaw) finds one of the living crewmembers of the Essex, Thomas Nickerson (Brendan Gleeson), to regale him with, well, a whale of a tale.\n\nTom Holland stars as the orphaned teenage Nickerson on his first trip to find and bring back whale oil for the thriving industry in Nantucket, Mass., circa 1820. Sailing veteran Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth) is in prime position to captain the Essex, but politics lead to the ship coming under the leadership of the untested George Pollard (Benjamin Walker). George comes from a top-notch sailing family, while in certain circles Chase is mocked for being a \"landsman\" and not a true sea guy.\n\nChase puts pride aside for a paycheck as the newcomer’s first mate, yet with his ability on the water he clearly outshines the insecure Pollard, causing strife among them and putting the whole crew in bad straits.\n\nThe tide turns when on the way to South America, they start finding whales, brutally killing them — by the time they venture too far east and ultimately find a plethora of the creatures to harpoon, Howard has presented the sailors both as salt-of-the-earth men and greedy murderers in a sense.\n\nSo when a monstrous whale swims into their life, the audience almost understands the creature's point of view. It takes violent revenge on the Essex, absolutely annihilating the ship. And after what’s left of the crew gets away, it comes back for more destruction, leaving the sailors stranded for 90 days and forced to go to desperate lengths to get back home.\n\nMore so than other waterlogged pictures, Howard creates an immersive, gorgeously shot experience pitting man against beast in the ocean for the film’s most spectacular scenes, which are reminiscent of old-school scope of Mutiny on the Bounty and other watery adventures of yesteryear.\n\nCharles Leavitt’s screenplay focuses on the sailors bickering and bonding, though the most intense scenes come between Whishaw's and Gleeson’s quietly profound performances. As for the crew of the Essex, Chase is the most fleshed out — with a wife back home and a kid he’s never met — but many of the sailors have few qualities to differentiate them, which hurts the tale later when watching these men we don’t know waste away.\n\nHolland does a good job as the greenest seafarer of the bunch, Walker and Cillian Murphy (as second mate Matthew Joy) both add extra skill to the mix, but In the Heart of the Sea really gives Hemsworth a chance to shine. He’s not just the hammer-slinging Thor: The Aussie continues to make the most of his dramatic work — as in Howard’s 2013 Formula 1 film Rush — and showcases a considerable amount of gravitas.\n\nChase has a staredown with the magnificent whale in one key moment, him looking haggard and it filled with fury, that is as touching and human as any in Heart of the Sea’s deep end of emotion."
