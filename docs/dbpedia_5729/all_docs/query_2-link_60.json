        "text": "A RETELLING OF THE EVENTS of the January, 1879 Battle of Rorke’s Drift in the Anglo-Zulu War, in which a ragtag force of some hundred able-bodied British Army regulars successfully defended a remote supply depot from a vastly superior force of Zulu warriors, the 1964 film Zulu means a great many things to a great many people. It provided the great Welsh screen star Stanley Baker with a signature role as Lieutenant John Chard, and definitively broke through his thirty-year-old cockney costar, Michael Caine. It inspired a young Afrika Bambaataa in the Bronx River Projects to create his Zulu Nation youth movement, though its images of Afro-European combat, appearing in the midst of the civil rights struggle, remain necessarily racially loaded, and for some it’s the definitive screen image of imperial martial valor, epitomized in the moment when the defenders of Rorke’s Drift, fallen back to their last redoubt, raise their voices together to sing “Men of Harlech.”\n\nZulu reflects both the spiritual sullying of combat and the mythic self-image of the United Kingdom in the full flower of Empire, and it should take nothing away from this to note that the same “Men of Harlech” scene occurs, in a very similar context, in Apache Drums, a 1951 Western directed by the Argentinean-born director Hugo Fregonese and produced by the American Val Lewton for Universal-International pictures, or that the director of Zulu—full name Cyril Raker Endfield—whose sobriquet might fit in on the roll call of Eton, was in fact the son of an Eastern European Jewish immigrant raised in Scranton, Pennsylvania.\n\nEndfield is the subject of an eleven-film retrospective which opens today at Anthology Film Archives—among the many inducements to attend is an IB Technicolor print of Zulu, recommended above the DCP which circulated in the recent Rialto rerelease. His career began not in Pinewood but in Southern California, where he landed in September 1940, staying with his old friend, screenwriter Paul Jarrico, while he attempted to turn his credits in progressive theater and amateur magic into a studio job. Showing off his feats of prestidigitation for a bemused Orson Welles at Bert Wheeler’s Magic Shop on Hollywood Boulevard led to an apprenticeship for the Mercury Theater unit at RKO, and two years later Endfield had finally managed to launch himself as a director of short subjects. (His first, a propaganda effort called Inflation, was snuffed at the behest of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a foretaste of futures frustrations.)\n\nThe earliest of Endfield’s features to play AFA is The Argyle Secrets (1948), an independently produced quickie marked by an unusual level of political pessimism and a total absence of “sympathetic characters” which involves a race to find documents that prove prominent Americans struck contingency deals with the Axis powers in the event of an Allied loss, but he really made his name with two back-to-back films that might be classified as newspaper noirs. The Sound of Fury (1950) stars Frank Lovejoy as a down-on-his-luck regular Joe who, in order to put food on the table for his family, begins working as a driver for a slickster triggerman (Lloyd Bridges, whose preening “seduction” scene with Lovejoy is a highlight). Once Lovejoy’s character is caught and jailed, this fairly straightforward tale of a man undone by ambition takes on a wider social scope, as a newspaper columnist (Richard Carlson) condemns the accused in the court of public opinion, and is rewarded for his efforts by the appearance of a lynch mob. The didactic commentary of a European observer—“Violence is a disease caused by moral and social breakdown”—was a lamented carry-over from the source novel by Jo Pagano, which drew from an actual mob uprising that occurred in San Jose, but the film, some of it shot on location in Phoenix, has a wonderful feel for life lived tenuously on the rung just above poverty, and Endfield’s visceral handling of the movement of massed bodies in the concluding siege anticipates the director’s later work on Zulu.\n\nThe Sound of Fury sets its scene in the Sun Belt anytown of Santa Sierra, where Lovejoy’s character has come from Boston to look for work, while Endfield’s The Underworld Story of the same year goes back to the precincts of Salem to offer live-at-the-witch-trials reportage. Dan Duryea, Patron Saint of Seedy Blondes, arrives in a backlot New England town bristling with cutout steeples and assumes a job at the local newspaper where, purely for reasons of profit, he takes up the defense of a black domestic (Mary Anderson, playing against racial type) accused of killing her employer. The actual culprits are a father-son team of local bluebloods who can trace their lineage back to Concord—“It’ll be the word of a nigger against ours,” says actor Gar Moore, in a moment of brute candor rarely seen in films of the day—but when they can’t cover their tracks through backroom dealmaking with prominent citizens, they ally with Howard Da Silva’s crime capo.\n\nJust as he was starting to build up a head of steam, Endfield’s brilliant Hollywood career was cut short. Screenwriter Martin Berkeley named him as a communist before the House Un-American Activities Committee—and friends and collaborators Da Silva, Bridges, and Jarrico were also being fingered. Endfield’s engagement with radical politics had begun years before he came west. Born in 1914, Endfield was the son of a moderately well-off furrier, born in Łódź as Koniećpolski, but he showed little interest in taking over the store. (“Nothing like a small business,” sneers Da Silva in The Underworld Story, “Backbone of the country.”) His father’s fortunes took a setback in the Depression, but Cy’s scholastic abilities were enough to win him entry to Yale, though his status as a scholarship boy and a Jew developed his sense of class consciousness. (Also from The Underworld Story: “You know what’s under ivy? Little crawling things.”) We have a privileged insight into Endfield’s political thinking during this period—intuitive, compassionate, and skeptical—thanks to his ongoing correspondence with Jarrico, then called Israel Shapiro, detailed in a superb biography by Brian Neve, The Many Lives of Cy Endfield, which appeared last summer. After two and a half years at Yale, Endfield lit off for New York City and the politically engaged New Theatre League, his course in life set.\n\nUntil 1951, that is. Some blacklistees went to Paris. Others, like Sam Wanamaker, Edward Dmytryk, Carl Foreman, Joseph Losey, and Endfield, headed for London. Contrary to popular belief, they weren’t always greeted with open arms in their new homes, and in the first years of his exile Endfield had to operate under a plethora of pseudonyms: Charles de Lautour (his British “overseer” on set), Hugh Raker, and C. Raker Endfield. It was under the last that he had his first great success, on Hell Drivers (1957). Through the personage of a newcomer (Stanley Baker), this hard-bitten classic initiates viewers into the society of lorry drivers carrying short-haul ballast loads—a seemingly banal job, but encouraged by their supervisors and their own overweening pride, they daily risk life and limb to shave seconds off of their time.\n\nBaker, a sensitive performer of tough coal mining stock, had previously worked with Endfield in Child in the House (1956), and their teaming was regarded as such a success as to spawn multiple “sequels,” each featuring Baker performing feats of derring-do aboard a new mode of transit. The excellent Sea Fury (1958), which owes no small debt to Jean Gremillon’s Remorques (1941), was shot partially on location in northeastern coastal Spain, and features Baker as an out-of-work first mate who finds a job with the captain of a salvage tug—a rumpled, splenetic, alcoholic Victor McLaglen, in a marvelous final film role. (The climax, which shows off the same partiality for cockeyed, canted angles seen in The Sound of Fury’s boozy nightclub scene, takes place aboard an abandoned American freighter, tilted on its port side, called “The City of Scranton.”) Follow-up Jet Storm (1959), which takes place entirely aboard a London-to–New York airliner captained by Baker, may not be the first in-flight thriller ever made, but it’s the first that I know of. Taking place in the growing panic following the discovery of an on-board explosive, the film is bolstered by the presence of a fine ensemble cast including Richard Attenborough and rocker Marty Wilde, who croons a theme song with lyrics by Endfield himself. Jet Storm isn’t Endfield’s best work, but it is the purest distillation of a favorite theme that is something like his political philosophy: the importance of maintaining circumspection and calm in a crisis, whether a matter of resisting the “thoughtless emotionalism” of the mob in The Sound of Fury or the stiff upper lip that carries the day in Zulu.\n\nEndfield and Baker, along with screenwriter John Prebble, were the principal architects behind Zulu, but the filmmaker was unable to convert its success into a more stable career. His last completed feature as director was Universal Soldier (1971), and the next quarter century of his life was occupied with uncompleted projects, the design of an early handheld word processor (the “Microwriter”), and a reengagement with his old passion for sleight-of-hand card magic. (Magicians recur throughout his filmography, and the power of the entertainer over an audience and the nuances of crowd psychology were sources of continual fascination.) He had done a great deal in cinema, but late in life he rued the fact that he hadn’t done more—as should we, for there is much evidence here that Cy Endfield still had a few tricks up his sleeve.\n\n“Sound and Fury: The Films of Cy Endfield” runs November 20–December 8 at Anthology Film Archives in New York."
