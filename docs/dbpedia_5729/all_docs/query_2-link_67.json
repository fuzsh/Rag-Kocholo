        "text": "It is not explicitly mentioned in the movie, but it would be safe to assume that the story takes place in Australia itself, because the character Max keeps dwelling in the Australian outbacks in the first 3 installments, which span more than 20 years. So we can tend to believe that the character's fate is to dwell in the Australian Outbacks only.\n\nSecondly as we know that there is fuel-shortage scenario in the background of this dystopia. So traveling outside country seems less plausible. More so because Australia is an island and the nearest country New Zealand has an entirely different landscape. So taking a clue from the outdoors in this latest franchise, along with character info, we can assume that it takes place in Australia.\n\nIt might have been filmed anywhere in the world which can resemble Australia, but we have no indication in the 4th part that the story has changed its location.\n\nWe don't have enough information to be sure - at least, not from the film itself.\n\nNo character in Mad Max: Fury Road mentions they are, other than through reference to the 5 named places we get in Mad Max: Fury Road. These places are;\n\nThe Citadel (stronghold of Immortan Joe)\n\nGas Town (stronghold of The People Eater)\n\nThe Bullet Farm (stronghold of the Bullet Farmer)\n\nThe Green Place (home of the Vuvalini/the Many Mothers)\n\nThe Salt (implied to be a dried up seabed)\n\nNone of these places seem to be references to real world locations other than The Salt, and even that doesn't give us any information about the real world location of Mad Max: Fury Road other than it is meant to be within a couple of days driving distance to an ocean."
