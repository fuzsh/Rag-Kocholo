        "text": "Mad Max franchise creator George Miller has revealed that there is already a \"whole story\" planned for another Fury Road prequel after Furiosa.\n\nSpeaking to Entertainment Weekly about Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, the next installment in his blockbuster franchise, Miller teased the prospect of another Mad Max movie that would take place after the upcoming prequel. He explained that the idea would be to build the world out further with a story focused on Max.\n\n\"The writers know what happened to Mad Max in that year before, and we have a whole story of that.\n\nMiller confirmed there is an appearance from Max Rockatansky and his iconic car, the Interceptor, in Furiosa, even though the story centers around Imperator Furiosa, who is, this time, played by Anya Taylor-Joy, not Charlize Theron. While brief, the cameo from Max could potentially lead to another film in the future.\n\n\"In doing what we did in the preparation of Mad Max: Fury Road, we also wrote what happened to Max in the year before we encounter him in [that film],\" Miller explained. \"And as we get towards the end of [Furiosa], the chronology, basically, we had to see that Mad Max was lurking around somewhere because we do know what happened. The writers know what happened to Mad Max in that year before, and we have a whole story of that, which I would like to do sometime if I get the chance.\"\n\nMad Max: Fury Road, released in 2015, follows Max (Tom Hardy) as he joins forces with Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) against the tyrannical Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne) and his army, leading to a deadly high-speed jaunt across the Wasteland â€” which made it onto IGN's list of best ever car chases.\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga takes place 15 years prior, telling the origin story of the titular renegade warrior before she joined forces with Mad Max. She faces numerous trials after being snatched from the Green Place of Many Mothers and falling into the hands of Chris Hemsworth's cape-wearing Warlord Dementus.\n\nIt sounds like Miller has ambitions to make a movie that would lead into Fury Road, taking place much later than Furiosa, which races into theaters on May 24."
