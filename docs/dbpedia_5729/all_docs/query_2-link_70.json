        "text": "During what was supposed to be a routine flight yesterday afternoon (August 4) a vintage aircraft was forced to undertake a false landing in a Cambridgeshire field.\n\nThe Sea Fury aircraft departed from Duxford airfield on a routine flight yesterday afternoon, however during the course of their flight the pilot had to undertake a forced landing near Button End in Harston.\n\nBoth the pilot and passenger escaped with minor injuries, however the plane, known as 'Invincible', sustained \"significant damage.\"\n\nIWM Duxford statement\n\nA statement issued by the Imperial War Museums yesterday confirmed that the aircraft had sustained significant damage and a fuel leak.\n\nThey said: \"There has been an incident involving a Sea Fury aircraft which departed from Duxford airfield this afternoon (4 August) on a routine flight.\n\n\"The aircraft had to undertake a false landing, the pilot and passenger are receiving medical attention for minor injuries.\n\n\"The aircraft sustained significant damage and a fuel leak, an IWM Duxford fire team with specialist equipment and knowledge assisted Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service at the scene.\"\n\n\"A trail of smoke\"\n\nAn eyewitness who saw the plane flying over their house in Barton said there was \"a smoke trail evident and the engine sounded bad\" as it passed overhead.\n\nAbout the plane\n\nInformation available on aviation databases about the plane - G-INVN - says that it was built in 1951 at Hawkers, Kingston-upon-Thames with final assembly taking place at Langley.\n\nThe aircraft arrived at Duxford in 2009, and is now operated by the Norwegian Spitfire Foundation, who were established in 2012 to increase the visibility of Norwegian aviation history.\n\nAccording to the Foundation, the plane had previously suffered a crash in 1990, with a page detailing the history of G-INVN saying: \"It suffered engine failure shortly after take-off and make a wheels-up forced landing in a field near Castle Cary.\n\n\"Fuselage broke into three sections on collision with tree. After the accident, the remains were inspected and deemed unrepairable then put up for disposal.\"\n\nThe Foundation said the remains went initially to New Zealand then Wisconsin. It was rebuilt before arriving at Duxford in 2009 and being re-registered as G-INVN in 2018.\n\nThe Sea Fury was used by the navy, and by the time the Korean conflict broke out in June 1950, the Sea Fury was the Royal Navy's leading single-seat fighter plane.\n\nIn Korea, the Sea Fury planes saw their fair share of air combat against Soviet-built jet fighters, though the Sea Fury was eventually replaced in front-line service by the Hawker Sea Hawk jet fighter from 1953."
