        "text": "I am happy to say that I have found the worst movie ever made. Mad Max: Fury Road graced my DVR yesterday evening while I was catching up on some work and blogging. At this point, I am happy I made it through. There was no plot, Tom Hardy grunts a lot, Charlize Theron has half an arm, and everything is post-apocalyptic. That’s the good stuff. The bad stuff: everything else. I will not get that two hours and twenty three minutes back.\n\nAt the twenty minute mark, I was about to stop the movie but said to myself: “Self: let’s plow through”. It was providing some background noise, but as bad as it was, I was intrigued – like watching cheese on a pizza melt. Sort of gross but fun to watch.\n\nAn hour in I was fully engaged. I felt like a member of Mystery Science Theater 3000.\n\nThe close of the movie is exactly as you’d expect: horrible. After Charlize’s performance in The Devil’s Advocate, I thought she could do no wrong. I was wrong. Tom Hardy in Inception? Awesome. Tom Hardy in Mad Max: Fury Road? Like watching the cast of Party Down South do Algebra.\n\nI would rather watch Ishtar or Caddyshack 2 on purpose rather than watch Mad Max: Fury Road. Look at it like I took a bullet for all of you last night. Do not watch this movie."
