Abel Hewson and Captain Bellew become love rivals for 18 years old Josita. Both men go on a dangerous mission to salvage a floating wreck carrying explosives which will detonate on contact with any water, on which this rivalry comes between them and their work. The tug-boat crew also resent Abel Hewson being made their First Mate, especially Gorman. They are also competing against another tug-boat operator Captain Mulder for the salvage prize.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nStanley Baker – Abel Hewson\n\nVictor McLaglen – Captain Bellew\n\nLuciana Paluzzi – Josita\n\nGrégoire Aslan – Fernando\n\nFrancis de Wolff – Mulder\n\nDavid Oxley – Blanco\n\nGeorge Murcell – Loudon\n\nPercy Herbert – Walker\n\nRupert Davies – Bosun\n\nRobert Shaw – Gorman\n\nRoger Delgado – Salgado\n\nBarry Foster – Vincent\n\nJoe Robinson – Henrik\n\nDermot Walsh – Captain Kelso\n\nRichard Pearson – Kershaw\n\nFred Johnson – Doc\n\nJack Taylor – Donkeyman\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nVictor McLaglen was cast with a view to the American market.[3] He signed in February 1958.[4]\n\nStanley Baker and Cy Endfield had previously teamed on Hell Drivers.\n\nThe film was shot in Costa Brava, where Rank had filmed The Spanish Garden.
