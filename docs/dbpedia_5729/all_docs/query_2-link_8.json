This is largely because it spends far too much time focusing on the rivalry between Baker's drifter and Victor McLaglen's salvage vessel captain for the affections of Luciana Paluzzi's Spanish siren. This element of the plot is very much of its time let's say, because watching it",

This element of the plot is very much of its time let's say, because watching it in 2019, it's quite creepy to see McLaglen's 60-odd year old seadog letch over Paluzzi's teenager, especially when she's effectively thrust into his arms by her own father (Roger Delgado of Doctor Who fame) who believes the captain's fortunes will make not only his daughter's life, but his own that much more comfortable too. However, despite this element of the film sinking, it's worth saying that Paluzzi is a delight in her role, bringing both comic relief and a sex appeal that is hard to ignore.\n\nWhere the film really picks up is in the latter stages when it finally attempts to live up to the action and drama of the title. Here, Baker and Enfield once again perform a meditation on machismo and virility not dissimilar to that which was explored in the superior Hell Drivers, as the crew must launch a rescue bid during a raging storm and McLaglen's drunken old soak realises at last that it's a young man's game.\n\nIt's interesting to see an old hand like McLaglen appear alongside rising stars like Baker and Robert Shaw here. McLaglen, who had made his name in the glory days of old Hollywood, was clearly cast to attract the attention of the American market but considering his star was in the descent at this stage (this was his final film before his death in 1959) and he was filling time guest starring in TV horse operas means that this was an optimistic casting decision. I can't help feel that the film would have been stronger if the rivalry was actually between Baker and Shaw. Their characters are antagonistic towards each other (Shaw believing that Baker has stolen his promotion on ship out from under him) and their aggression is much more palpable. At the very least it would have made the romantic subplot less sleazy if played out between two young men."
