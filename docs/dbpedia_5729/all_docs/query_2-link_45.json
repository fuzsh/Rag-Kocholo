There's quite a selection of 1/48 scale kits available these days, including the old Falcon vacform, Hobbycraft, Trumpeter, the recent AMG offering and even Airfix releasing an all-new kit later in 2017.\n\nSix options are included in this release.\n\nColours ranges from variations of Extra Dark Sea Grey over Sky, silver paint, gloss blue and even Olive Drab.\n\nDetails are as follows:\n\nHawker Sea Fury FB.11 WG629 136/T 807 NAS RN HMS Theseus, Egypt 1952\n\nHawker Sea Fury FB.11 TF994 BC-C 803 NAS RCN HMCS Magnificent 1948\n\nHawker Sea Fury FB.11 115/NW RAN, Bankstown 1968 (based about two kilometres from where I live)\n\nHawker Sea Fury FB.11 FAR 42, Cuban AF, 1969\n\nHawker Sea Fury FB.50 Moroccan AF, Rabat-Sale, Morocco 1978\n\nHawker Sea Fury FB.50 6-16 860 Sqn, R. Netherlands Navy 1951\n\nA number of alternatives are included for a couple of the above subjects, resulting in even more options.\n\nFive sets of national markings are included - the Royal Navy and the RAN options share the blue-and-white portion of the roundels, with red dots and kangaroos completing the appropriate option.\n\nInstructions for the decal sheet are in full colour across one folded double-sided A4 sheet. Both side plus upper and lower views are provided for all six aircraft. Stencils are included.\n\nColour notes are supplied, along with model paint callouts for Xtracolor enamels and Xtracrylix acrylics.\n\nThe decals are beautifully printed and feature thin carrier film.\n\nThis release offers some interesting options for 1/48 Sea Furys, whatever kit you are building..\n\nHighly Recommended.\n\nThanks to Hannants for the review sample\n\nXtradecals are available online from Hannants' website\n\nReview Text Copyright Â© 2017 by Brett Green\n\nThis Page Created on 9 March, 2017\n\nLast updated 9 March, 2017"
