The ocean's fury transformed several Alaska communities into tangled devastation. This video commemorates the 40th anniversary of the disaster, featuring recent interviews with some of the lucky people who escaped the ocean's wrath. They describe in chilling detail what they saw and the thoughts that raced through their minds as they watched the black waves attack their communities that fateful day. The program also presents the science of tsunamis using 3-D computer graphics, and tells how to prepare for the next big one. Produced with the University of Alaska Fairbanks Earthquake Information Center and the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.\n\nWatch a clip from this video\n\nThis clip is also available on YouTube.\n\nItem details\n\nItem number: M-25D\n\nYear: 2004\n\nMinutes: 25\n\nISBN: 978-1-56612-096-8\n\nWhat others say"
