Sea Fury is a 1958 British action film directed by Cy Endfield and starring Stanley Baker, Victor McLaglen (in his final film), Luciana Paluzzi and Gr√©goire Aslan. The film's plot involves a violent rivalry that develops between two tug-boat operators in Spain. Some of the exteriors were shot in the Costa Brava. Sea Fury was instrumental in the comeback of director Cy Endfield, who'd been forced to flee Hollywood and seek work in London because of the Hollywood Blacklist.
