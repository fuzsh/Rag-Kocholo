        "text": "Discussion\n\nThe abuse of hallucinogens remains an important public health issue in the United States, with the prevalence of past month hallucinogen use reported to be 1.2 million in 201022. The number of new initiates for hallucinogens increased significantly from 200,000 in 2003 to 377,000 in 2010, despite a corresponding decline in the perceived availability of LSD and other hallucinogens during the same time period22,23. Additionally, the Drug Abuse Warning Network indicates the number of LSD and other hallucinogen-related emergency room visits almost doubled from 5,296 cases in 2004 to 10,607 cases in 200924. In this context, the introduction of a potent synthetic hallucinogen with little pharmacologic data on human effects is a major public health concern.\n\nOur study results indicate that the typical profile of a NBOMe user who experiences adverse effects is a young male who is a regular user of marijuana and other substances. NBOMe ingestion often presented as a toxidrome that began shortly after ingestion, characterized by prominent neuropsychiatric effects (agitation, delirium, perceptual disturbances, seizures) and autonomic instability (tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis, and dilated pupils), ranging in severity from mild to severe. Once brought to medical attention, majority of patients recovered, but a substantial number required extended stays in the ICU requiring ventilatory support. These are effects similar to toxidromes reported in users of synthetic cathinones (“bath salts”), PCP, MDMA, anticholinergics, cocaine, and other stimulants, where agitation and cardiovascular effects are prominent25–28. These findings also resemble prior reports of NBOMe toxicity that remained analytically unconfirmed. For example, in a study of 25 cases of NBOMe ingestion reported to the Texas poison control center in 2012 and 2013, 88% were male with a mean age of 17 (range 14–25). Tachycardia (52.0%), agitation (48.0%), and hallucinations (32.0%) were most commonly noted, with 2 (8.0%) fatal outcomes29. Considering the short period of time that NBOMes have been on the black market, the accumulating reports of fatalities and serious adverse effects are of considerable concern.\n\nMost drug ingestions lead to time-limited reactions that resolve once the substance is cleared from the body. Prolonged reactions become more common in overdoses or in binge usage, where protracted psychotic reactions or end-organ damage may occur. Yet, it is still concerning that 40% of the patients reported here required admission to an intensive care unit for management. This may suggest the possibility that these cases represent massive overdoses, that NBOMes have long-acting active metabolites, or that NBOMes are particularly prone to cause such toxic effects regardless of dose. Given that NBOMes are potent 5-HT2A agonists, and that agonism at the 5-HT2A receptor contributes substantially to the development of serotonin syndrome30, the adverse effects seen may represent severe cases of serotonin syndrome. However, the relative paucity of neuromuscular findings common in serotonin syndrome (i.e. hyperreflexia, tremors, clonus) may argue against this diagnosis30.\n\nMany of the patients were noted to be behaving aggressively towards others, and one patient stabbed himself as a suicide attempt. In the 2 fatal cases described by Walterscheid et al, both patients suffered violent deaths, as evidenced by the numerous contusions and hemorrhages found at autopsy19. These reactions are also similar to the aggressive behaviors sometimes seen in synthetic cathinone ingestions31. However, these violent reactions to ingestion of synthetic cathinones, PCP or psychostimulants are often idiosyncratic32, and it remains to be elucidated if NBOMes users are more prone to violent reactions.\n\nWithout knowing the actual dose ingested, it is difficult to ascertain if the adverse effects are dose dependent. Due to the extreme potency of this class of drugs, it is possible that individuals in this review had ingested much larger quantities of NBOMe than intended. The psychoactive dose can be as low as 50μg3, making it impossible to correctly identify an appropriate dose with the naked eye. For example, a 5mg dose, equivalent to 25–50 times the psychoactive dose, would appear no larger than a single grain of kosher salt33. Additionally, it remains unclear if the route of ingestion plays any significant role in producing adverse reactions. Even those individuals taking NBOMe through the oral route experienced seizures and prolonged hospital stays. For example in the case series reported by Hill and colleagues, six individuals presumably ingested the same material from the same batch that was mislabeled as 2C-B. Nevertheless, one individual experienced a marked agitated delirium requiring several days of intensive care treatment, even though he ingested it orally17. The five others, two of whom insufflated the material, were treated and discharged relatively quickly after treatment with benzodiazepines. The individual that injected the drug intravenously experienced a significantly prolonged hospital course with many medical complications including ARDS, pulmonary abscess, and anuria. This may suggest that the intravenous route is especially hazardous.\n\nThe overall prevalence of NBOMe in the general population is likely to be small, but it may be gaining popularity in certain populations. In an online survey of 22,289 individual drug users, 39.4% reported ever using LSD, while 2.6% reported any NBOMe use. The most commonly reported NBOMes were 25I-NBOMe (2.0%), followed by 25B-NBOMe (1.2%) and 25C-NBOMe (0.8%). Highlighting the relatively brief period in which NBOMes have been available, the vast majority (93.5%) reported the first use on NBOMe in 2012 or later. In regards to the source of the drug, the majority reported obtaining the drug from a website (41.7%) or from a friend (39.7%), while only a minority from a dealer (15.9%). Users from this survey noted that peak psychoactive effects appear approximately 2 hours after oral ingestion, or 45 minutes after insufflation. Duration of effect was noted to range from 3 to 13 hours.\n\nSimilar to LSD, NBOMes are often sold on a blotter paper, which are small pieces of paper infused with the drug. Blotter papers are often adorned with unique artwork or colorful designs to indicate a particular brand or drug33. Of great concern are reports that NBOMes are sold as LSD, not only because NBOMe produce similar psychological and somatic effects as LSD, but because the potency of NBOMes allow the use of blotters. Most other drugs of abuse are psychoactive at much higher doses (typically >10mg), making it difficult to contain a single dose on a blotter paper. Masquerading of NBOMe as LSD has an important consequence. Adverse reactions to LSD have been well described, with “bad trips” being a common time-limited adverse reaction that responds well to reassurance and benzodiazepines34. Suicide attempts while intoxicated on LSD have been rarely reported, and no fatal cases of overdoses from LSD have been reported6,7,34. Indeed, despite its potent agonism at the 5-HT2A receptor, no clear case of serotonin syndrome has been reported in the 50 years that this compound has been used and misused35. Therefore, users familiar with LSD may have a false sense of security when ingesting NBOMe inadvertently. Indeed, our review indicated that 4 (20%) of the patients thought they had ingested LSD, and two of those patients died, while another patient attempted suicide.\n\nPatients in this review were generally managed with intravenous fluids and benzodiazepines, and mechanical ventilatory support where indicated. This is in line with recommended management strategies for drug ingestions leading to toxic reactions, including serotonin syndrome, where the aggressive use of sedatives to reduce the agitation is paramount26,30. As such, even though no guidelines exist at this time, it appears that NBOMe ingestions should be managed using a similar approach. Therefore, the use of 5-HT2 antagonists may be an option to consider, particularly in those patients who are at least moderately ill30. Indeed in this review, one patient did receive cyproheptadine as part of the management17. The cases presented here provided minimal clinical information after the initial autonomic and neuromuscular issues resolved, suggesting patients generally did not present with persistent dysphoria, anxiety, paranoia, psychosis, delusions, or perceptual disturbances. However, given that these types of reactions can be seen following drug ingestions, it may be prudent to monitor for such persistent reactions and be prepared to provide antipsychotic medications.\n\nIn November of 2013, the Drug Enforcement Agency placed all three NBOMe analogs (25I, 25B, 25C) into schedule 1, making it illegal to manufacture, distribute, import/export, research, or possess these compounds36. A number of US states have also enacted laws to schedule these compounds, including Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Virginia37. Nine other countries are known to have enacted laws to control these substances, including Australia, Brazil, Denmark, Israel, Latvia, Russia, Slovenia, Sweden, and United Kingdom2,37.\n\nPresently NBOMes are not part of routine drugs of abuse screens available in hospital or other clinical laboratories. There are no rapid immunoassay screening tests or point of care devices which can detect the presence of NBOMes in urine specimens. Testing NBOMes in serum specimens is beyond the capabilities of all but perhaps a few hospital based laboratories. Presently, a few commercial reference laboratories offer a qualitative screen to identify the presence of 25I-NBOMe, 25C-NBOMe and 25B-NBOMe in blood, serum or urine. All published procedures for NBOMe analysis in biological samples utilize high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HPLC/MS) or HPLC/MS/MS. 25I-NBOMe has been identified in plasma17, urine16,17,19 and postmortem heart blood19 in cases of severe intoxication. Validated HPLC/MS/MS methods have been published for detection and quantification of 25I-NBOMe in serum13,38, urine38 and numerous postmortem fluids and solid tissues14. Additionally, validated quantification methods are available for 25C-NBOMe in serum38 and urine20,39, 25B-NBOMe in serum15 and urine15,20 and an additional six NBOMe derivatives in urine39. Serum specimens for NBOMe testing should be collected in the classic red top or gray top blood tubes. Gold top or tiger top tubes with clot activator and thixotropic serum separator gel should not be used for NBOMe specimens. All specimens should be stored refrigerated. When sending serum tubes and/or urine containers off site for testing, they should be double bagged in zip lock bags in the event of leakage and shipped overnight with “cold packs”.\n\nClinical suspicion should remain high for a possible NBOMe ingestion in patients presenting with recent use of hallucinogens, especially LSD or the hallucinogens in the 2C family. If possible, analytic confirmation should be obtained. Management of NBOMe ingestion should include aggressive fluid repletion and sedation using benzodiazepines. Patients should be made aware of the potential for ingesting NBOMes even if they feel confident about the source. As a harm reduction strategy, users should be advised against using hallucinogens alone without a sober sitter, avoiding “eye-balling” the dose due to overdose risk, and avoiding insufflating or injecting NBOMes. If a substance that may be NBOMe is found on a patient by a clinician, gloves should be used to avoid any direct contact and to take extreme caution to avoid inadvertent exposure—i.e. touching the mouth after handling the substance. In addition, caution should be exercised handling NBOMe powder to avoid making the compounds airborne.\n\nNBOMes are a novel class of potent 5-HT2A agonist hallucinogens, with accumulating evidence for users suffering severe adverse effects. In severe cases, death can occur even after ingesting a single dose. Limited data on human use of NBOMes precludes the ability to predict which users will develop these severe reactions, and as such both clinicians and patients need to be educated about the potential dangers. Additional research is needed to further evaluate the effects associated with NBOMe ingestion in humans."
