        "text": "Since our last update on summer transfers of Cameroonian players, the transfer window has closed in Europe. We’ve already reported here on some of the bigger transfers of the summer such as Samuel Eto’o’s long awaited move from Mallorca to Barcelona; Timothee Atouba’s transfer from Basel to Tottenham in England and Patrick Mboma’s move to Vissel Kobe in Japan. But here are some of the other transfers involving Cameroonian players which have taken place in the past few weeks since our last update…\n\nSamuel Eto’o and Carlos Kameni were not the only Cameroonians moving to new clubs in Spain. Eto’o’s former club Mallorca signed two Cameroonians but then loaned them out for the rest of the year to other clubs, attacking midfielder Daniel Ngom Kome was loaned to newly promoted Primera Liga team Getafe while Samuel Eto’o’s 17 year old brother David Eto’o was loaned to 2nd division Ciudad de Murcia in order to get playing experience.\n\nIn Germany, two forwards were loaned out for the season to new clubs. U-23 player Daniel Wansi left his Middle East club Al Nasr for Dynamo Dresden in Bundesliga 2. Francis Kioyo also was loaned by 1860 Munich to Rot Weiss Essen another Bundesliga 2 club.\n\nFranco-Cameroonian centerback Martin Ekani was loaned by Ligue 1 club Lens to Angers of Ligue 2 in the hope he will receive some more playing opportunities than he has been receiving at Lens.\n\nIn Turkey, Franco-Cameroonian forward Claude Bakadal left Diyarbakispor for newly promoted club Sebatspor. Meanwhile Ankaracugu, where Jean Emmanuel Effa Owona was signed earlier in the summer, went to Cameroon to sign a pair of midfielders, veteran Joseph Marie Tchango from Cotonsport and Herve Zengue from Union Douala.\n\nIn Greece veteran midfielder Jean Denis Ouanga joined Kallithea from Egaleo Athens while in Italy three young Cameroonians were loaned out to Serie B clubs to get some playing experience. Fullbacks Patrice Feussi and Antonio Ghomsi were loaned from Genoa to Salernitana and espoirs forward/right winger Thomas Job Iyock was loaned by Sampdoria to Pescara.\n\nIn England, 2000 Olympic Gold Medalist Serge Branco, previously released from his contract by Vfb Stuttgart in Germany, signed with Leeds United of the Coca Cola Championship (effectively the 2nd Division in England). Valery Mezague was loaned out for the season by Montpellier of France to Portsmouth of the English Premier League. Meanwhile Cambridge United of the lowest tier of England’s 4 professional levels, signed young midfielder Kingsley Mbome from the French amateur league.\n\nIn Belgium forward Emmanuel Kenmogne moved to 2nd Division Tubize from Mons. While in Switzerland, several Challenge League (2nd Division) clubs acquired Cameroonian players. Espoirs midfielder Francis Ze was loaned by Italy’s Sampdoria to FC Chiasso while FC Meyrin signed forward Achille Njanke from Delemont and the out of contract fullback Landry Ebanga Kebe.\n\nRight before the closing of the transfer window these transactions took place: sometime espoirs forward Emile Mbamba left Vitesse Arnhem of Holland to play Champions League football with Israel’s Maccabi Tel Aviv. 20 year old right back Patrice Kwedi moved from Croatia’s Dinamo Zagreb to Sweden’s IFK Goteborg. Then there is 2000 Olympian defensive midfielder Clement Beaud who left Vetra of Lithuania for Academica Coimbra of Portugal’s Super Liga. This transaction, however, has not yet officially been approved by the Portuguese league as Beaud did not arrive in Portugal in time to sign his contract before the transfer deadline cutoff and instead his contract was signed by his lawyer. It is expected that sometime this week the league will rule on whether Beaud’s transfer was registered in time. In the meantime he is training with his new club.\n\nHere is the complete list of transfers that we know of which have taken place this summer involving players from Cameroon:\n\nFrance\n\nLigue 1\n\n– Jean Hugues Ateba lb PSG (Nantes)\n\n– Herve Tum fw Metz (FC Basel)\n\n– Benoit Angbwa rb Lille (Nacional/Uruguay)\n\n– Luc Michel M’Beng fb out of contract (Caen)\n\n– Henri Bedimo Nsame mf Toulouse (first pro contract)\n\n– Jean Joel Perrier Doumbe rb Rennes (Auxerre)\n\n– Alexandre Song dmf Bastia (Bastia 2)\n\nLigue 2\n\n– Eugene Ekobo mf Cretiel (Beauvais)\n\n– Guy Ngosso dmf Sedan (Cotonsport/Cameroon)\n\n– Frederic Minye cb Sedan (Bonamoussadi/Cameroon)\n\n– Jean Jacques Ebentsi mf out of contract (LeHavre)\n\n– Joel Tchami fw Laval (Hertha Berlin amateurs)\n\n– Martin Ekani cb Angers (Lens)\n\nNational\n\n-Patrick Noubissie fb Roye (Sedan)\n\n-Paul Claudel Alo’o Efoulou mf Sannois St. Gratien (Racing)\n\n-Bertrand Tchami fw Pau (out of contract)\n\nSwitzerland\n\n-Augustine Simo mf FC Aarau (FC Zurich)\n\n-Samuel Ojong fw FC Thun (Neuchatel Xamax)\n\n-Jean Michel Tchouga fw Lucerne (Concordia Basel)\n\n-Francis Ze mf FC Chiasso (Sampdoria)\n\n-Achille Njanke fw FC Meyrin (Delemont)\n\n-Landry Ebanga Kebe fb FC Meyrin (out of contract)\n\nBelgium\n\n-Patrice Noukeu mf Mouscron (Geel/Div. 2)\n\n-Guy Bertrand Ngon A Mamoun lw St. Trond (Al Arabi/UAE)\n\n-Hans Eric Ekounga fw out of contract (Lokeren)\n\n-Francis Ambane fw out of contract (Lokeren)\n\n-Georges Mbida mf out of contract (Lokeren)\n\n-Samuel Ipoua fw St. Trond (out of contract)\n\n-Emmanuel Kenmogne fw Tubize (Mons)\n\nGermany\n\n-Serge Branco mf out of contract (VfB Stuttgart)\n\n-Jean Paul Ndjoumeck cb out of contract (Borussia Fulda)\n\n-Daniel Wansi fw Dynamo Dresden (Al Nasr)\n\n-Francis Kioyo fw Rot Weiss Essen (1860 Munich)\n\nSpain\n\n-Samuel Eto’o fw Barcelona (Mallorca)\n\n-Daniel Ngom Kome mf Getafe (Mallorca)\n\n-Idriss Carlos Kameni gk Espanyol (LeHavre)\n\n-Jacques Songo’o gk out of contract (Deportivo)\n\n-David Eto’o fw Ciudad de Murcia (Mallorca)\n\n-Pierre Wome fb/mf out of contract (Espanyol)\n\nPortugal\n\n-Rudolph Douala fw Sporting Lisbon (Uniao Leiria)\n\n-Clement Beaud mf Academica de Coimbra (Vetra)\n\nTurkey\n\n-Rigobert Song cb Galatasaray (Lens)\n\n-Alioum Saidou mf Galatasaray (Istanbulspor)\n\n-Emmanuel Effa Owona fw Ankaragucu (Elazigspor)\n\n-Joseph Marie Tchango mf Ankaragucu (Cotonsport)\n\n-Herve Zengue mf Ankaragucu (Union Douala)\n\n-Claude Bakadal mf Sebatspor (Diyarbakispor)\n\nGreece\n\n-Jean Denis Ouanga mf Kallithea (Aigeleo Athens)\n\nItaly\n\n-Patrice Feussi fb Salernitana (Genoa)\n\n-Antonio Ghomsi fb Salernitana (Genoa)\n\n-Thomas Job Iyock fw Pescara (Sampdoria)\n\nEngland\n\n-Mathias Doumbe cb Plymouth Argyle (Hibernian/Scotland)\n\n-George Elokobi df Colchester (1st pro contract)\n\n-Guy Ipoua fw Doncaster Rovers (out of contract)\n\n-Thimothee Atouba fb/mf Tottenham (Basel)\n\n-Serge Branco mf Leeds United (out of contract)\n\n-Valery Mezague mf Portsmouth (Montpellier)\n\n-Kingsley Mbome mf Cambridge United (French amateur league)\n\nScotland\n\n-Gustave Bahoken cb Livingston (Angers/France)\n\nRomania\n\n-Patrick Bengondo fw out of contract (Universitatae Craiova)\n\n-Eric Bieme mf out of contract (Universitatae Craiova)\n\nPoland\n\n-Innocent Hamga fb out of contract (Lech Poznan)\n\nIsrael\n\n-Emile Mbamba fw Maccabi Tel Aviv (Vitesse Arnhem)\n\nSweden\n\n-Patrice Kwedi rb IFK Goteborg (Dinamo Zagreb)\n\nJapan\n\n-Patrick Mboma fw Vissel Kobe (Tokyo Verdy)\n\nBy Coutler Martin, martin@camfoot.com"
