        "text": "The Use of Tracers in Transport Studies\n\nJoan Gil in Models of Lung Disease, 2020\n\nColloidal gold was first proposed as electron opaque tracer for electron microscopy by Faulk and Taylor in 1971. The spectacular growth in interest in this particulate tracer is due to the following advantages: the preparation method of gold sol is simple, rapid, and efficient; its coupling to proteins and polysaccharides implies adsorption and not covalent binding; the method is suitable for double labeling experiments using gold particles of different sizes; and the contrast of gold particles is higher than that of other particulate tracers such as ferritin. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) can be conjugated to gold sol (Au) to give an LDL-Au complex. When coupled to 5 nm gold, usually one or two gold particles label one LDL (Fig. 2a). The complex does not change significantly the size of native LDL particle and is more electron dense than LDL-ferritin conjugates (Fig. 2b). When conjugated to 20 nm gold sol, most complexes are made of ~ 8 LDL particles per one Au particle (Handley et al., 1981); in this case the size of the complex is greatly increased. Various ratios of LDL/Au particles may also be obtained (Fig. 2c-i).\n\nStages of Hypnotherapy\n\nAssen Alladin, Michael Heap, Claire Frederick in Hypnotherapy Explained, 2018\n\nSome practitioners prefer to combine hypnotic induction techniques; for example, the eye-fixation technique can be combined with the relaxation technique. As many of my patients have anxiety, I find the combined relaxation with counting method very effective and beneficial to the patients. In Appendix 2C I have provided a complete script for the relaxation with counting method, together with the deepening technique and the ego-strengthening suggestions. Novice hypnotherapists may use the script verbatim initially, and then gradually adapt it to suit their own personal style and preference.\n\nClinical Effects of 2C-B Abuse\n\nOrnella Corazza, Andres Roman-Urrestarazu in Handbook of Novel Psychoactive Substances, 2018\n\nIn 2013, almost half of the GDS respondents (n = 2,282, 46.4%) reported lifetime use of at least one NPS. With regard to psychedelic phenethylamines, 21.7% described lifetime use, with 18.4% corresponding to the 2C series and 2C-B being the most widely consumed (n = 291, 12.9%) (Palamar, Barratt, Ferris, & Winstock, 2016). In Australia, in a survey among regular ecstasy users, in the previous six months, 44% had consumed an NPS of which 2C-B (8%) and 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-I) (14%) were the most prevalent (Burns et al., 2014).\n\nFemale Nigerian asylum seekers in Italy: An exploration of gender identity dimensions through an interpretative phenomenological analysis\n\nPublished in Health Care for Women International, 2021\n\nFrancesca Tessitore, Giorgia Margherita\n\nFinally, (2c) I can’t imagine my future; it is unpredictable…gives also testimony of the impossibility of representativeness of the future. This unpredictability, on one hand, seems to be concretely connected to the asylum granting time and to the social-juridical suspension lived by asylum seekers. On the other hand, it also brings us back to the identity suspension lived that seems to configure a porous area in which not only the imaginative capabilities but also those of desire seem to be compromised:For now, my future is like a question mark…I am here since one year and I don’t know nothing… regarding my documents or Commission…regarding me… [Blessed]I can’t imagine my future…I am waiting just to know something more about it…I am trying to do my best… [Mercy]I can’t know how my future will be…I don’t know nothing about my document…there is a lot of delay for them… [Favour]\n\nWhat’s in a Name? Correlates of Ecstasy Users Knowing or Agreeing that Molly is Ecstasy/MDMA\n\nPublished in Journal of Psychoactive Drugs, 2018\n\nJoseph J. Palamar\n\nParticipants were also asked about lifetime use of other drugs, including powder cocaine, mushrooms, LSD, ketamine, methamphetamine; and nonmedical use of amphetamine, benzodiazepines, and opioids. Nonmedical use was defined as use to get high and/or use without a prescription (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2014). Participants were also asked about some new psychoactive substances (NPS), including synthetic cannabinoids, new dissociatives (e.g., methoxetamine [MXE]), 2C series drugs (e.g., 2C-E, 2C-I), and NBOMe (pronounced “N-bomb”; e.g., 25i-NBOMe)."
