Unlocking livestock development potential through science, influence and capacity development ILRI APM, Addis Ababa, 15-17 May 2013 Developing capacity Influencing decisions ILRI Research Methods Group (RMG): Unified research computing platform This document is licensed for use under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 3.0 Unported Licence May 2013 • Center for excellence • Mentoring students • Accurate projection for growth • Reduced overhead costs Isaac Kahugu and Alan Orth Delivering science Why unify? Until recently there was no institute-wide platform supporting ILRI’s data, computation, and research; efforts were often duplicated, leading to a mess of decentralized systems. Furthermore, the ad-hoc nature of the system limited the size and scope of projects we could undertake. • Better tools • Better analysis • Faster results What are we doing? Using the latest open-source “cloud” technologies we have built a strong, stable and secure foundation for institute-wide research. We are gradually incorporating aspects of legacy systems into the new platform. Through unification we are… Computation Data Support"
