        "text": "European law dramatically affected the terms of wealth exchange in marriage throughout colonial Africa. In the French mandate of Cameroon, laws governing bridewealth significantly altered the asset value of a wife and her children and with it the path towards prosperity for young unmarried men, as well as fathers, elders, and communities. In the years between the start of World War I and the end of World War II, the currency fluctuations, profit valuations, and market prices that increasingly entered into marriage arrangements in the rapidly expanding economy of Cameroon shocked Christian missionary societies, disquieted the French administration, and provoked unmarried African men whose pursuit of a wife and family became not only more onerous, but also steeped in risk. In response, the French administration set strict legal limits on the use of currency in bridewealth exchange, enforced through taxation and the etat civil. However, French law could not inhibit economic forces from rendering African communities increasingly competitive, particularly in the marital domain. In response, new African leaders—including priests, pastors, catechists, nuns, and organizers of pious brotherhoods—emerged to reform and renovate marriage culture. This paper discusses the confluence of an expanding colonial capitalist economy and burgeoning Christian devotion, which transformed ideologies regarding marriage and family building—the principal path to wealth, as well as spiritual grace—in modern Africa. It will analyze how marriage became a site of contestation between economic trends and religious movements and how Christian marriage reform movements derived from a crisis of economic inequality.\n\nPolygamy has been a longstanding practice in Africa, predating the introduction of Catholicism. It has served essential functions within various cultural contexts on the continent. However, Catholic theological teachings emphasise monogamy as the ideal form of marriage, viewing it as a sacrament ordained by God, as emphasised in the Gospels and the writings of St. Paul. The Church maintains that no human power can change this. Despite this, some scholars do not agree with the Church's stance against polygamy and its condemnation, particularly in Africa, where they believe it still has a role to play. They argue that the Church's teachings on marriage fail to appreciate the values of polygamy in Africa. This paper critically reflects on the arguments in favour of polygamy in Africa, focusing mainly on their ability or inability to promote gender equality and human dignity within marriage. Ultimately, the paper concludes that Catholic theological thinking on marriage is more conducive to mutual self-giving, love, equality, and respect among spouses than polygamy. The methodology employed is hermeneutical-critical reading of existing literature on the subject matter.\n\nIn this article, I study the predominantly African-American religious denomination, African Methodist Episcopal (AME). Between 1900 and 1940, the AME regularly sent African-American members to South Africa where they worked as missionaries. Close analysis of AME hierarchy and structure, demonstrates that the AME overwhelmingly preferred to send couples to work as missionaries. Consequently, African-American AME women who journeyed to South Africa were typically married and did not undertake mission work as a career. In comparison, the travel of South African women who converted to AME was not as circumscribed. African-American AME women were held to different standards than their South African counterparts, with the differing standards symbolising the predominant race and gender relations of the time. African-American women had to be married in order to enjoy the freedom to travel internationally, but, quite unusually, female South African converts surpassed this limited freedom and sojourned internationally as single women and pursued missionary careers.\n\nPolygamy is part of the social life of many cultures in the world. In the ancient Near East, it seems to be part of the culture of the people right from the time of the patriarchs and most of the ancient African societies. With the advent of Christianity to Africa in the 19 th and 20 th centuries, missionaries were at the crossroads on how to handle or accommodate polygamous families in the church when they gave their lives to Christ. It seems polygamous families were looked upon by the missionaries as the worst sinners, which cannot receive the grace of God. A position which upholds the church as the ultimate Judge, outside God's grace which is inconsistent with Biblical teachings. This development puzzles the minds of the learned class and some evangelical theologians and causes anxiety in the cultures where its practice had become the accepted norm of society before the introduction of Christianity. To some extent, it has contributed greatly to the setback in the progress of the work of salvation because those polygamous societies see Christianity as an enemy of their cultures. Besides, the view seems to prescribe a precondition for polygamists to repent hence he must forsake other wives and stick to the first wife in other to be accepted in the church. This has created some social problems which deserve the response of the church in the 21 st century. The Paper employs biblical and historical methods to throw more light on what the Bible says about polygamy and how the church should respond to cases of polygamy in the 21 st century devoid of crises of interest without negating the word of God."
