        "text": "In December 2023, Leapfrog released its lists of the country’s top hospitals. Leapfrog looked at general, teaching, children’s and rural hospitals specifically and ultimately chose 132 hospitals for its lists.\n\nTo evaluate hospitals, Leapfrog used unique criteria for each category. For instance, the organization examined ICU physician staffing and patient communication for children’s hospitals and volumes of complex surgeries such as hip and knee replacements for general hospitals.\n\nThe full lists of 132 hospitals, organized by category and state, are below.\n\nTop general hospitals\n\nCalifornia\n\nEl Camino Hospital\n\nKaiser Foundation Hospital – San
