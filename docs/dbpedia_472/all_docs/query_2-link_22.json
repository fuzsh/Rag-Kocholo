        "text": "MU-COM Annual Outcomes Report 2021-22\n\nThe MU-COM curriculum was designed to facilitate progressive achievement of the seven (7) core competencies enunciated by the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME). The competencies serve as the targeted educational outcomes for the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) program. The competencies include:\n\nOsteopathic principles, practice, and manipulative treatment: The student will apply osteopathic principles to the delivery of all aspects of patient care.\n\nPatient care and procedural skills: The student will demonstrate the essential knowledge, skills, and dispositions required to appropriately and compassionately care for patients.\n\nMedical knowledge: The student will demonstrate the appropriate knowledge of the clinical and biomedical sciences and their application to patient care.\n\nPractice-based learning and improvement: The student will investigate and evaluate patient care practices based on the principles of evidence-based medicine.\n\nInterpersonal and communication skills: The student will exhibit interpersonal and communication skills to appropriately interact with patients, families, and professionals.\n\nProfessionalism: The student will demonstrate the ethical, behavioral, and social science principles required for patient care and professional practice.\n\nSystems-based practice: The student will display awareness of health systems and global issues that impact healthcare and patient communities.\n\nMU-COM also reviews student progress related to the core entrustable professional activities (EPAs) using the competency crosswalk created by the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM).\n\nCOMLEX-USA\n\nThe National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME: www.nbome.org) administers the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination of the United States (COMLEX-USA). The examinations consist of three levels (Levels 1, 2CE and PE [currently suspended], and 3) and are designed to assess osteopathic medical knowledge, clinical skills, and other competencies required to practice as an osteopathic generalist physician.\n\nThe Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA: www.osteopathic.org) requires that all osteopathic students pass COMLEX-USA Levels 1 and 2CE prior to graduation. Graduates of COMs must also pass COMLEX-USA Level 3 during postgraduate (residency) training in order to obtain a license to practice medicine. COCA requires that all COMs publish first-time pass rates for students and graduates. MU-COMâ€™s pass rates are listed below.\n\nFor additional information related to the COMLEX-USA series, please visit the NBOME website: https://www.nbome.org/exams-assessments/comlex-usa/.\n\nCOMLEX Level-1 First-Time Pass Rates\n\nAcademic Year MUCOM Pass Rate (%) National Pass Rate (%) 2022-23 92.7 90.60 2021-22 86.99 92.20 2020-21 96.34 93.70 2019-20 94.19 94.34 2018-19 98.08 92.98\n\nCOMLEX Level-2CE First-Time Pass Rates\n\nAcademic Year MUCOM Pass Rate (%) National Pass Rate (%) 2022-23 96.97 94.50 2021-22 95.06 95.06 2020-21 97.99 96.54 2019-20 99.36 96.84 2018-19 98.06 95.60\n\nCOMLEX Level-3 First-Time Pass Rates\n\nReport Year MUCOM Pass Rate (%) National Pass Rate (%) 2022 100 96.25 2021 97.52 97.05 2020 98.65 97.01 2018-19 99.45 97.49 2017-18 99.09 95.43"
