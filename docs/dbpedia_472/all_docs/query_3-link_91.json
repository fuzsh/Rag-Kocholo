It has continued to be a public health hazard world‐wide, and a major cause of suffering and death to humans in sub‐Saharan Africa. The number of new human TB cases in most African countries has more than quadrupled since 1990, with roughly 735 thousand deaths occurring annually on the continent. Single and multi‐drug resistant (MDR) forms are already widespread, while a form that is resistant to both first‐line and some second‐line drugs, referred to as extensively drug resistant TB (XDR‐TB) is now gaining grounds. While many countries globally have made great progress in controlling the disease, the problem has persisted in Africa because the correct tools are not being deployed or adapted/adopted adequately for use on the continent In the present study we determined the best published PCR assay/combination for use in Cameroon; determined continent. study, the pattern of resistance of TB bacteria to first line TB drugs in parts of the country; determined the strains of MTBC circulating in the country and developed capacity for tackling the problem on a regional or continent‐wide scale.  Overall objective: To contribute to the control of TB •This was a cross‐sectional and hospital‐based molecular epidemiological survey in Cameroon through the development / validation •A combination of bacteriological, biochemical, molecular biology and of efficient tools and strategies for use. bioinformatics approaches were used  Specific objectives were to: •Sputa and urine were collected at selected hospitals and health centers in 7 1.

Determine the phenotypic drug resistance •Diagnostic PCR assays were based on purified DNA and bacterial thermolysate. pattern of isolated Mycobacteria to first line TB drugs in Cameroon •Genotyping was done by MIRU‐VNTR and Spoligotyping at the BecA Hub, ILRI, 3. Determine the genotypes of MTBC circulating in Nairobi Cameroon and predict possible routes of spread Map of TB incidence rates (Source: WHO, 2009 report) •Binary data for spoligotyping, and number of repeats for MIRU‐VNTR were 4. To strengthen the TB research capacity of the analysed using online bioinformatics programmes at www.miru‐vntrplus.org NEPAD/BecA Node in Buea, Cameroon •The combined targeting of the IS6110 and rpoB genes should yield the most sensitive PCR procedure for the diagnosis of TB in Cameroon •TB in Cameroon appears to be caused largely by M. tuberculosis and to a much smaller extent by M. africanum. • Following the re‐organisation of the Cameroon National TB control Programme, resistance to all first line anti‐TB drugs has declined significantly (p < 0.05 for West; and p < 0.01 for Centre) in comparison to previous studies, with ethambutol now showing no resistance in both Regions. •The prevalence of the Cameroon family TB genotype has dropped from 42% in 2003 to 34.25% in the present study (2009). The Ghana strain seems to be spreading in Cameroon, with Douala, the economic capital, being the epicenter. •Only three M. africanum isolates were detected in 265 isolates. This represents a significant drop in the relative prevalence of this species in Cameroon from 56% in the early 1970s to 9% in early 2000 to 1.2% in the present study.
