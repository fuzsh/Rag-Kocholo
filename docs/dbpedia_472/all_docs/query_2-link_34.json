        "text": "Abuse of new psychoactive substances is an emerging social problem. Several phenethylamines are internationally controlled substances as they are likely to be abused and have adverse effects. Phenethylamine analog 2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine (25I-NBOMe) has been reported as one of the most commonly abused psychoactive substance. However, the cardiotoxicity of this compound has not been extensively evaluated. Thus, in this study, we investigated the adverse cardiovascular effects of 25I-NBOMe, related to p21 (CDC42/RAC)-activated kinase 1 (PAK1). The cardiotoxicity of 25I-NBOMe was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, live/dead cytotoxicity assay, PAK1/CDC42 kinase assay, and inÂ vivo electrocardiography (ECG). Also, we analyzed the expression level of PAK1, which is known to play key roles in the cardiovascular system. In the MTT assay, cell viability of 25I-NBOMe-treated H9c2 cells or primary cardiomyocytes of ICR mice decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. Results from the inÂ vitro cytotoxicity assay in cardiomyocytes showed that 25I-NBOMe decreased the viability of H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes, and TC50 of 25I-NBOMe was found to be 70.4âÎ¼M. We also observed that 25I-NBOMe reduced PAK1 activity inÂ vitro. Surface ECG measurement revealed that intravenous injection of 25I-NBOMe (doses of 1.0 and 3.0âmg/kg, corresponding to serum concentrations of 18.1 and 28.6âng/mL, respectively) prolonged the QTc interval in SD rats. Furthermore, treatment with 25I-NBOMe downregulated the expression of PAK1 in the hearts of SD rats and H9c2 cells. In summary, our findings indicate that PAK1-related adverse effects of 25I-NBOMe can cause toxicity to cardiomyocytes and induce an abnormal ECG pattern in animals."
