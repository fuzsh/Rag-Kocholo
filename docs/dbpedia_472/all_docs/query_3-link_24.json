        "text": "üåü A New Chapter Begins üåü Today, I have stepped down as Chairman of Compass Pathways and have left the board of directors after an incredible 8-year journey. It's been a privilege to contribute to developing breakthrough therapies in mental health. Moving forward, I'm dedicating myself to innovating the broader mental health care ecosystem. I believe in the power of public-private collaboration to drive significant change. I look forward to sharing more of this future direction in the months ahead. Thank you to everyone who has helped us along the way! Here's the note that my co-founder, Ekaterina Malievskaia, and I shared with the Compass team today: Hi everyone As many of you have probably seen Kabir Nath's note and the press release, we wanted to share our thoughts and feelings in this moment of change. It has been an amazing journey from the earliest days when we were imagining how to help people who were struggling with their mental health and the inadequacies of care. That was over 10 years ago. As we spoke with dozens and eventually hundreds of people, the idea of Compass started to emerge. In 2016, we started to manufacture COMP360. When we received our first investor support and Lars Christian Wilde joined as co-founder in 2017, our momentum picked up and our core team started to form and grow to become who we are today. We are indebted to all of you who have changed your lives to be part of this mission to accelerate patient access to evidence-based innovation in mental health care. As we have seen the organisation grow and mature with Kabir‚Äôs principled and effective leadership, it has become clear to us that Compass has not only achieved escape velocity but is well on its way to progress our COMP360 treatment through our phase 3 trials in TRD and our earlier clinical research in other patient populations. It‚Äôs gratifying to see how we are helping some patients through their participation in our clinical trials. Founders and entrepreneurs are wired to start things, transforming ideas into organisations with ambition and momentum. We‚Äôve done that with Compass. We‚Äôve also realised that our overarching goal to transform mental health care requires more than a new treatment modality - and more than any single organisation can achieve. So, there‚Äôs more work to do - and after a bit of a break, that will start to take shape. In the meantime, thank you for all you do to extend and deepen the original vision. Keep our shared values in your hearts and minds - and you will be an unstoppable force! Patients and their families are counting on you. Growing up around the time of the original moon shots, George was always struck by what Mission Control said to astronauts as they escaped the bonds of gravity under their own power. It somehow feels fitting to use this in closing this chapter and our last email from this address. Farewell and godspeed Compass! Warmest regards -George & Katya\n\nFellow clinicians, here we are one month deep into 2024, and let me just make a wild guess: Change in your life and is unfolding in its typical, unpredictable way. This has certainly been true for me. I had some health goals for 2024, set to take effect Jan 1. But then my entire family got sick. For weeks. And then another professional priority needed my full attention. And I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs coming around the corner, but I am very confident it will not be a beautiful, clear runway laid out before me, making the changes I want both effortless and permanent. We all know change is a roller coaster, full of ups and downs. Yet it‚Äôs so easy for the mind to get attached to the dream of reaching our goals flawlessly, without any hiccups. But let's get real ‚Äì the messy, unpredictable journey of change is where the magic truly happens. Maybe you‚Äôre on an upswing with your goals for personal growth and well-being? Maybe you‚Äôre in the flow of some great forward momentum and want to bottle up that success for keeps? Or maybe, like me, you‚Äôve set an intention, only to see it dissolve completely in the incessant flow of life and the many other demands on your time and attention. Wherever you are, there is one timeless, gentle reminder that will never lead you off course: ‚ÄúBegin Again.‚Äù Think you‚Äôve arrived and got it all figured out? Begin again. Look again at what‚Äôs happening now. We falter and backslide when we begin to assume there is no more to learn. Feeling discouraged? Begin again. Change takes time, and it's completely human to stumble when you dare to commit to change. You're not alone, and every moment is a chance to start anew. As a psychologist, I have the privilege of witnessing the beautiful journey of change ‚Äì both in myself and in my clients. And let me tell you, real change doesn't happen without embracing the art of beginning again. And as clinicians we are never just witnesses to change. We are also actively learning, growing, and passing on that transformative energy to those in our care. Let‚Äôs all support each other in remembering to keep discovery alive as we make changes for ourselves and as we join each other in that larger journey toward change in healthcare. #healthcaretransformation #burnoutprevention #mentalhealthawareness #wellbeing #healthcare #burnoutrecovery #meaningfulwork #physicianburnout\n\nFriday reflection - A very productive week within PatientSource land. I'm a 76 üåû Heatwave baby, which has given me a warm affection for the sun and heat, cold water swimming felt very üëΩ üëæ However, in part thanks to 'Tony the Ice Cube ‚ùÑ King' Tony King taking daily outside cold showers (even through the winter!) and recently buying an ice tub, I relented at the tail end of our non summer... Firstly in a shorty wetsuit, but of late, swim shorts and skins... He was right, I have acclimatized, it is more psychological and once you're in and moving, it's pretty fantastic... Not as fantastic as the hot coffee and breakfast sat on the beach after! Just a great way to start the day, let's see how far I can go into the Autumn üçÇ My reflections whilst swimming - We've put the final plan around an exceptionally exciting partnership announcement that will go live early next week. We are talking hand to glove. Karen Ogilvie (Deane) - You can soon release that bated breath üòá Huge thanks to our 24/7/365 support partner CloudCoCo Plc - Lee Thatcher and Adam Fossett introducing us to Matthew Wood, Emma Scott, Sian Louise Draper, Clint McCarthy, Esther Martinez Diaz and Darryl Merkli over at Ingram Micro. We're going to create a stunning video piece depicting AWS innovation and an incredibly impactful application of our solution in health, we're so excited! Credit to Adeline Careme, Sophie Munro and Mingxian Jian at AWS who'd already been championing this customer story. Damian Quinn in his 'Greatest Showman' guise delivered numerous prospect client demos, including a potential move into the Private GP space. Credit to our client Brandon Centre - Here for Young People, CEO Julia Brown , and Dr Pavlos Rossolymos for their aspirations in how best to engage with young persons for their Mental Health support, it dramatically expanded our patient comms capabilities, something Private GPs highly value! We've potentially solved a nitty, gritty problem for one of our long-term clients, and did it in an archetypal SME way, I attended a webinar demo with the Quicksilva team at 11, contacted our client during the demo, they got excited, we were on a call with Daniel Cooper by 4:15 and we've got the construct of a project that will dramatically improve clinicians lives and give PatientSource the sublime functionality and ability to read / write to EMIS & TPP. Five hours, point to point.... A long term prospect has moved into a final due diligence stage whilst they decide to commission us or not, if we get the green light, it will spearhead a long term relationship that will be significantly mutually beneficial üôè An insightful The UK International Healthcare Management Association (UKIHMA) Members forum, skillfully chaired by Andy Ward & hosted at Royal Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, thanks to Daniel Saxton, Andrew Raynes CHCIO MSc & Eamonn Gorman! Plus plenty more.... Hope you all had a good week also, here's to the weekend.....\n\nThis week's been all about the power of self-efficacy - your confidence in your own ability to achieve something. I loved being reminded yet again about its core importance in 3 key areas of my work. üì¢ New founders need a truckload of confidence in their ability to energise networks, funders and teams to make their vision come to life. It was a pleasure to meet and advise - and hopefully support self-efficacy - in the new cohort 8 founders at ZINC this week (Manu Sidhu, MD Ren√©e Okhiria, MD Jean-Paul Efang Mbome), and also independent women's health founder Georgina Benjamin. Your passion and belief are inspiring! üîä It's a game-changer for health outcomes when people are self-managing. I believe including it in health content strategy and creation is crucial. It was great to find my new client is on the same page in a project kick-off meeting this morning. If you're looking to inspire and motivate action in the people who engage with your content, helping them to find that self-belief is crucial. Including prompts and techniques that increase self-efficacy alongside information shifts the dial (if you'd like to do more of this, get in touch as I offer reviews of existing content and strategy/plans for new content, too). ‚ñ∂ As a freelance consultant, I need to be clear about my own ability to deliver for new clients. I firmly believe this needs to be allied to a realistic evaluation of my own skills and experience - but also a willingness to learn, grow and collaborate with your clients and their users. So if my confidence wavers at any point I remind myself of all the projects I've initiated, learned from and delivered in the past - including: (1) leading the British Heart Foundation information and support response to the coronavirus pandemic (2) writing the first lay person's book on how to deal with PCOS, that led to a whole series and helped grow and support UK charity Verity (PCOS UK) with the publicity and royalties (3) redefining the sometimes narrow gynaecological vision of what women's health means by creating the essential guides as Chief Content Editor at Healthily (including thyroid problems, pain management, long Covid, winter health and sleep which all affect women more or differently to men). And encouraging, challenging and supporting founders to address these - hello Unravel Health, lovely to support you this week in your accelerator phase (Liza Levy Veronika Bridgman Alexandra Oti). None of which could be achieved without self-efficacy and collaboration from amazing colleagues. What ignites your confidence that you can achieve something when you take on a new challenge? #selfefficacy #womenshealth #founderjourneys #womenshealthmatters #healthyhabits #consulting #freelance Jenny Hargrave Estelle Stephenson Lawrence Bate Lina Eliasson PhD CPsychol Christina Jackson Jo Wheatley Fiona Bugler Amelia Glean Laurel Ives Jo Waters Michelle Pilley Danny Hearn Maria Sullivan Lynne Ruddick Kathryn Coles at White Rabbit Research\n\nThree Conversations ‚Äì helping us remember that people are humans! This week‚Äôs story answers a couple of questions that we are sometimes asked early in our work with new innovation sites. ‚ÄúWE‚ÄôVE KNOWN THESE PEOPLE A LONG TIME. THERE‚ÄôS NOTHING NEW WE CAN DO FOR THEM, IS THERE? ‚Äì But have we always taken the same approach & asked the same questions? No wonder we‚Äôve not done anything different. Let‚Äôs try a different approach this time & see where that leads! ‚ÄúIF I CAN‚ÄôT REFER ON, HOW WILL I MANAGE MY WORKLOAD?‚Äù ‚Äì You‚Äôre not alone in this work & the 3 Conversations approach encourages you to collaborate with & make connections to others who can advise or provide practical help. This saves time & stops people being batted around in our system. One example which shows this is Victor, a man in his mid 80‚Äôs who has a number of health issues including diabetes, heart & kidney disease, fluid in his legs, foot & neuropathy. When the innovator visited Victor to have a ‚Äúreview‚Äù conversation she spent some time learning about him, his time in the army in Cyprus, his interest in art & history, & that he had appeared as an extra in several TV historical dramas. He loved wildlife & had two pet birds as well as a bird feeding station outside his window. His toes were blue, & he was unsteady on his feet, which made him less inclined to go outside. Victor was pretty bored being stuck at home. The management of his extra care complex didn‚Äôt offer anything of interest to him & Bingo wasn‚Äôt his style. WHAT DID THE WORKER DO? - The innovator talked through a few ideas with Victor, to see how he felt about these & made connections to a companion caller group. She also arranged for the local library delivery service to regularly bring a bagful of books to his home for free, on subjects that interested him. She contacted Victor‚Äôs GP to request support and monitoring of his health conditions by district nurses & brought colleagues from the Reablement team into the conversation to work with Victor on his mobility & look at options for a motorised wheelchair so he could get into the garden to see the wildlife. WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED? ‚ÄìUsual practice would have meant going through the same old form with Victor, asking the same old ‚Äòtick box‚Äô questions & focusing on his clinical needs, rather than considering him as a human being with other interests & wishes. WHAT DID HAPPEN? ‚Äì Victor was able to have a more open conversation with someone who showed a genuine interest in him. Whilst his existing support plan didn‚Äôt change, the quality of his life did. His family contacted the team to say how grateful they were for the work they had done for their father. The innovator did a great job but was able to make use of the support of others around her to help with this. We are convinced that better listening leads to better results for people. The hardest part of this can be helping staff realise they are allowed to do this and are not on their own.\n\nHappy 2024 to you all; and what a great time to reflect on 2023. For me professionally, the focus was all in on twenty30 health; a few highlights below. üëç Just over a year into the twenty30 health journey, I am privileged to culminate my 20+ years of clinical, academic, technology and venture expertise, to have founded and to lead a whole-person, multimodal, technology-enabled start-up company, to deliver care to over 100 million Americans suffering daily with obesity and related metabolic diseases. üëå We have partnered with an outstanding legion of impactful investors, to provide encouragement, support and guidance - to navigate the early stages, when more is unknown than known. Michael Forman Jessie A. Benjamin South, CRPC¬Æ John Chadwick Claritas Capital John Gordon David Haines Front Row Fund Lenore Champagne Beirne Elton Brand Bright Ventures Ken Downey Tania Jovanovic Grant Theresa Sexton and many more. üëè Rob Draughon, Stephen Klasko, Krishnan Sridharan and Mike West have been monumental to advise, support and encourage me and the broader team, to advance our mission; to help patients with obesity and metabolic disease engage in their personalized care journey and achieve best outcomes. üò∑ Our clinical advisors have been committed and on point to drive forward whole-person, multimodal obesity care, for all who need and want it, across all parts of the USA. Shanu Kothari David Sarwer Aditi U Joshi MD, MSc, FACEP üôè Thank you to a number of my past patients I have had the privilege to take care of, who reached out again to share their stories, and to support our vision; to improve health through caring for all people with obesity. üí™ Strong work from all team members at twenty30 health, without whom, we would not have the clinical, growth, operations, technology, product, marketing, financial and administrative skills and expertise, to be where we are today. ü§û And now to 2024; whilst the hype on Ozempic and the GLP-1 market continues to increase, let's celebrate the shift in care and treatment, from obesity as a choice one makes, to obesity as a complex, chronic disease, underpinned in biology, affected by environmental factors, and eminently treatable. üëä No more stigma, bias or discrimination. That's it.\n\nEver since I first met the team, I have been touched by the power of Oxehealth and the good it can do. The Company brings 10+ years of clinical research to the behavioral health space, is used by 50% of NHS providers in England, and is poised to enter the US. I am thrilled by the opportunity to lead this incredible Company. But for me, this opportunity is deeply personal. While I am a firm believer in using LinkedIn as a professional platform, I have also learned that one has to be human to connect and contribute - with that in mind, I must share the ‚ÄúWHY‚Äù behind taking this wonderful opportunity. My appointment as the CEO of Oxehealth is a fulfilling moment for me that combines my personal and professional life. As some of you know, I tragically lost my brother-in-law four years ago from his mental health struggles. Jake was a wonderful light in our lives, and having it extinguished so unexpectedly was devastating. Ever since then, I have been a firm believer in the importance of behavioral health. We spend too much time discussing physical health and not enough time on the mental. As I progress in my career, I am reminded of how critical our mental fitness is to personal well-being. We all carry personal histories and perspectives that shape how we live life. My own history has created incredible clarity on the good that Oxehealth can do. In very simple terms, Oxehealth saves lives. Every 40 seconds, someone takes their life, adding just one second to improving that would save 53 people TODAY. Oxehealth enables those with acute mental conditions to get better in a dignified and personal manner. It is a technology that belongs in every behavioral health facility throughout the world. We have an incredible platform that utilizes deep learning to intelligently monitor patients in acute facilities, measuring their breathing, pulse rate, and activity. Nurses can monitor and manage patients with dignity and efficacy. The end result is to ensure a better quality of stay for a patient, an optimized discharge based on them truly being better, and a baseline for longer-term improvement - all while enabling the clinical team to work more efficiently. I am beyond excited to be part of this team and show how we will transform patient monitoring in acute behavioral health and beyond.
