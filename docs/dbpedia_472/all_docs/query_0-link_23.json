        "text": "Non-Communicable Diseases and Conditions\n\nMental health and mental illness: Eight articles that directly addressed mental health/illness met our criteria. These articles discussed the impact of mental disability on functioning. Four articles focused on depression [14–17]. Three of these studies addressed depression in people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA). Topics included the prevalence, predictors, or correlates of depression, and the efficacy of intervention. Two articles included participants with psychosis/schizophrenia and other mental illnesses [18, 19]. One article examined suicide [20]. No studies were found that discussed indigenous conceptualizations of mental health or mental illness, anxiety disorders, personality disorders, or eating disorders. Knowledge and awareness of mental health in the public and in health systems was addressed in three studies. St. Louis & Roberts [21], looked at attitudes about mental illness in general and discussed stigma of mental illness: compared to Canadians and Americans, people in Cameroon had more negative impressions of mental illness, were less likely to endorse advocating for treatment, were more likely to engage in stigmatizing behaviour, and viewed people with mental illness as unable to function in daily living. Keugoung et al [20] and Gaynes et al [14] assessed the capacity of district health systems to deliver quality mental health care. Results suggest that most people with depression or other mental illness did not seek biomedical treatment, there was a lack of specific guidelines for treatment of mental health disorders among primary healthcare facilities, and a general lack of professionals trained in mental health care [14, 20]. Regions with millions of inhabitants (such as the Far North region) did not have doctors trained in psychiatry [20]. People with severe mental illness living in rural districts were referred to a psychiatric hospital in Yaoundé and follow-up communication between doctors in this hospital and the patient´s local doctors did not occur [20]. Knowledge of mental health/illness was also limited. Eighty-seven percent of consulting nurses interviewed by Keugoung et al [20] were not able to name any signs of depression and did not know it was associated with suicide. No other studies were found that addressed health worker capacity to address other disabilities.\n\nNeurological conditions: The literature on neurological conditions was dominated by studies addressing knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of epilepsy. Of a total of 12 studies in this category, 11 addressed epilepsy [22–32] and one addressed Parkinson's Disease (PD) [33]. Studies surveyed the public, secondary school students, and healthcare providers in different health districts across Cameroon to determine prevalence of stigmatizing attitudes towards people living with epilepsy (PLWE). Discrimination against PLWE was the highest when concerning the prospect of marriage. While stigma was present among medical professionals, stigma was greatest amongst traditional healers. In Badissa Village, lower rates of stigmatizing attitudes were attributed to an epilepsy education and treatment program established 10 years prior to the study [28]. In contrast, districts which lacked an epilepsy education and treatment program at the time the studies were conducted (Akwaya Health District, Batibo Health District, Fundong Health District, Kumbo West Health District, Ebolowa and Sangmelima) showed high rates of stigmatizing attitudes. All 10 studies found that predictors of negative attitudes towards PLWE were the beliefs that epilepsy is contagious and a form of insanity. In contrast to studies that focused on quantifying the prevalence of stigmatizing beliefs, Allotey & Reidpath [22] and Cubo et al [33] qualitatively focused on the impacts of epilepsy and PD, respectively, on functioning. PLWE reported a lack of supportive relationships and disruptions to meaningful family relationships [22]. Caregiver burden was a factor in caring for PLWE as well as people with PD [22,33]. In regards to intimate relationships, hypersexuality was found among people with PD [33]. Restrictions placed on sexual intercourse by medical doctors and healers affected self-esteem for males and contributed to internalized stigma [22]. Restrictions placed on PLWE by medical care providers and cultural beliefs resulted in the internalization of a 'sick' role, which posed barriers to participation in productive activities [22]. PLWE reported being subject to high levels of discrimination which hindered their participation in community, social and civic life, and reduced their “social value” [22]. PLWE were excluded from employment opportunities, resulting in difficulties supporting their family and affording medications for their condition; 40/42 participants reported compliance with medications only when finances were available [22]. Furthermore, 30/42 participants reported interruptions in education due to seizures; some were expelled from school because of them [22]. Participation in domestic life was also hindered. For example, women were advised to stay away from open fires which resulted in an inability to participate in cooking - an important role for women in Cameroon [22].\n\nSensory conditions: The only sensory condition that was studied with regard to the impact on functioning was the loss of hearing [34, 35]. Studies addressing vision loss reported only prevalence and did not discuss impacts on functioning [36, 37]. De Clerck [34] addressed the low quality of life of deaf individuals. She found that societal attitudes were highly discriminating and questioned the ability of deaf individuals to participate in activities associated with 'full personhood' in Africa such as employment, marriage, having children, and supporting a family. Deaf individuals reported internalized stigma, negatively affecting perceptions of themselves and other deaf people [34]. Access to employment opportunities was restricted due to a lack of education and low literacy rates among people who are deaf [34, 35]. Jobs that were obtained were often difficult and precarious [34, 35]. The lack of employment opportunities for deaf individuals resulted in financial barriers and further marginalization [34]. Deaf individuals lacked supportive relationships, were often left out of the family [34], and experienced human rights violations such as sexual abuse [34]. Many deaf individuals were not aware of the Cameroonian legal system and lacked the knowledge to self-advocate [34, 35].\n\nPhysical disabilities: Of five studies addressing the impacts of physical disabilities, Bremer et al [38], Fernande and Paul-Iva [39] and Kiani [40] addressed participation restrictions for people living with mobility impairments (PLWMI). Kiani [40], Nanfosso and Zamo-Akono [41] and Zamo-Akono [42] addressed employment restrictions. All five studies found that having a physical disability made it difficult to participate in employment [38–42]. For PLWMI, participation in employment was impacted by a lack of access to education due to the physical inaccessibility of schools and financial barriers [38–40]. PLWMI reported reduced availability of health services [38–39] as medical consultation and transportation were costly and taxis often refused to provide service [38].Participants reported that healthcare workers were not informed nor sensitive to the needs of PLWMI, negatively impacting quality of service [38]. PLWMI reported a lack of supportive relationships and stigmatizing societal attitudes [38, 40]. Participation was restricted in their community, social, and civic life due to the inaccessibility of public spaces and societal attitudes [39]. Beliefs, such as disabilities are caused by divine punishment, can lead PLWD to avoid being in public spaces [39]. Participation in domestic life was difficult for PLWMI due to activity limitations for tasks such as fetching water and cooking, and participation in social life, such as marriage [38]. Fernande and Paul-Ivan [39] discussed the violation of rights of that PLWD face. Even though laws regarding accessibility exist in Cameroon, they are rarely adhered to and PLWD are left out of decision-making processes regarding open space planning and policies [39].\n\nMetabolic and cardiovascular conditions: Six articles regarding metabolic and cardiovascular conditions were included. Of these, four discussed knowledge, attitudes, or awareness of risk factors [43–46]. Four addressed the impact of these conditions on participation and functioning by examining management of disease through activity and lifestyle modifications [43–45, 47, 48]. These authors stressed the importance of reducing risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. Kiawi et al [43] found that knowledge of these topic areas in Douala, Yaounde, Bamenda and Garoua was limited, and diabetes was considered to be 'the sugar disease,' with its cause attributed solely to eating sweet foodstuffs. Diabetes was commonly self-diagnosed, using methods such as tasting one's urine. If the urine tasted sweet, it was assumed to be because of diabetes [47]. Diabetes was not seen as a big threat to ones' health and not viewed as a chronic condition [43]. Awah et al [44] reported that a reduction in risk factors was difficult due to the lack of a national policy programme on non-communicable diseases combined with low awareness of the need for a reduction of risk factors. Perhaps some progress was made as the results of a study conducted by Fezeu et al [46] indicated that individuals residing in the Bamenda health district had adequate general knowledge about risk factors, symptoms, treatments, and complications of diabetes. Examining societal beliefs that may be correlated to diabetes, Kaiwi et. al. found that poverty is associated with thinness and with walking as a means of transportation. As a result, having a larger body size was valued and walking as a form of exercise was not [43]. Hence, obesity, along with physical inactivity and poor diet, was often not believed to be associated with diabetes. Traditional beliefs regarding the cause of diabetes, such as that the disease is a result of a social transgression of the patient or punishment from ancestors for neglecting culturally important rituals, may lead people to seek traditional healers [47]. In addition, many patients did not have the financial means to follow recommended diets [44], to access biomedical services and medicines [48], resulting in reliance on more affordable traditional options [43].\n\nCancer: the search revealed two studies that addressed cancer. Neither addressed the impacts of cancer on participation in daily life, however they identified key factors resulting in delay in seeking care [49] or an unwillingness to seek care [50]. Inadequate health services and lack of knowledge and awareness about cancer combined with the role of traditional beliefs were discussed in both studies.\n\nInfectious diseases: Despite the large number of studies focusing on HIV infection, few studies examined disability related to HIV. Seven studies about infectious diseases addressed disability or functioning: six addressed HIV [51–56] and one focused on tuberculosis (TB) [57]. The main activity and participation restrictions faced by PLWHA identified in these six studies included: human rights violations, acquisition of necessities, engaging in work and employment; and engaging in intimate relationships. Jacobi et al. reported 12% of participants experienced violations of their human rights due to their HIV status [53]. Participants in this study reported being forced to change their residence or being unable to rent housing and some believed it was due to their HIV status [53]. Twenty-three percent of the participants lost their job at least once in the past 12 months and more than 40% of believed it was due to their HIV status [53]. Engaging in intimate relationships was hindered for PLWHA as 25% of participants isolated themselves and decided to refrain from marriage, sex, or having children due to internalized feelings of shame or guilt, self-blame, and low self-esteem [53]. Boyer found that PLWHA were discriminated against within their family [51]. Suzan-Monti et. al reported that among 1673 participants, 15% did not disclose their serostatus to their main partner, however, individuals who knew someone else with HIV in their family or social circle were more likely to disclose their HIV status [56]. PLWHA with stronger social supports reported better physical and mental health [52]. Access to healthcare and quality of care received was impacted by inability to pay for treatment, individual attitudes of healthcare professionals, and lack of services. In their study on HIV-related stigma, Rosenburg et al. reported that Cameroonian nursing students witnessed nurses providing poorer quality of care to a PLWHA than to other patients. This study reported that not only were PLWHA discriminated against by nurses, but nurses caring for PLWHA were also discriminated against [55]."
