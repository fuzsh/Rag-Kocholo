        "text": "Stress Management and Meditation\n\nMehwish Iqbal in Complementary and Alternative Medicinal Approaches for Enhancing Immunity, 2023\n\nGraves' disease patients not only had a considerably significant amount of stressful events in life, but they also had a huge impact of stressful and negative life events contrasted with normal controls and patients with toxic nodules (Matos-Santos et al., 2001). One of the studies documented a substantial rise in Graves' disease incidence throughout the civil war in Eastern Serbia (Paunkovic et al., 1998). Stress may give rise to a weakness in immunological surveillance, ultimately causing the synthesis of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (Ranabir & Reetu, 2011). Moreover, stress can lead to menstrual abnormalities, anovulation and amenorrhea in females. Amid newly imprisoned females, along with stress, 33% had irregularities of menstruation and 9% had amenorrhea (Allsworth et al., 2007), and in males, there can be changed morphology and motility of sperm and diminished sperm count (McGrady, 1984). Oligospermia, impotency and ejaculatory problems may be related to psychological components in males' infertility (Palti, 1969). Psychological stress may give rise to persistent stimulation of the neuroendocrine systems. Stress hormone (cortisol) promotes central obesity, a rise in ghrelin and a leptin drop, and encourages enhanced appetite and food consumption. This condition gives rise to the recent obesity epidemic (Siervo et al., 2009).\n\nAbdominal Ectopic Pregnancy\n\nBotros Rizk, A. Mostafa Borahay, Abdel Maguid Ramzy in Clinical Diagnosis and Management of Gynecologic Emergencies, 2020\n\nThe symptoms range from amenorrhea, abdominal pain, and vaginal bleeding to hemorrhagic shock. The most common clinical presentation of ectopic pregnancy is early trimester vaginal bleeding and/or abdominal pain [8]. The hidden nature of ectopic pregnancy lesions may lead to clinical emergencies. Acute clinical manifestations include acute pelvic, right or left upper abdominal, or diffuse abdominal pain. Abdominal tenderness, sickness, and hypovolemic shock occur during the phases of amenorrhea. Nonspecific symptoms, such as epigastric pain, dyspepsia, or irregular vaginal bleeding, sometimes anticipate the acute clinical evolution [6]. Rupture and hemoperitoneum must be considered in case of hypotension, tachycardia, abdominal tenderness with abdominal guarding, and low-grade fever [1].\n\nChanging “Unchangeable” Bodily Processes by (Hypnotic) Suggestions: A New Look at Hypnosis, Cognitions, Imagining, and the Mind-Body Problem\n\nAnees A. Sheikh in Imagination and Healing, 2019\n\nA surprisingly large number of Wilson and Barber’s [59, 60] excellent hypnotic subjects (60% of those asked) stated that they had experienced one or more false pregnancies (pseudocyesis). They had believed they were pregnant and they had had many of the symptoms. In addition to the cessation of menstruation (amenorrhea), they typically had experienced at least four of the following five symptoms: abdominal enlargement, morning sickness, breast changes, cravings for specific foods, and “fetal” movements. Two of these women had gone for abortions following which they had been told that no fetus had been found. All of the other false pregnancies terminated quickly when negative results were received from pregnancy tests. (In the comparison group of not-so-good hypnotic subjects, 16% had failed to menstruate at least one time previously and had believed they were pregnant. However, with the exception of one subject, who had had many of the symptoms of pregnancy, they had experienced only one symptom, namely, morning sickness.)\n\nThe effect of COVID-19 infection on the menstrual cycle: a cross-sectional investigation in the MENA region\n\nPublished in Human Fertility, 2023\n\nMohammad A. Alshrouf, Abdulrahman M. Karam, Muayad I. Azzam, Majed W. Al-Nazer, Minolia A. Al-Kubaisy, Abdallah Al-Ani, Nadia Muhaidat\n\nAside from its impact on physical health, the COVID-19 pandemic can negatively influence the mental health of the public (Huang & Zhao, 2020). Depression, stress, and anxiety had prevalence rates of 33.7%, 31.9%, and 29.6%, respectively, during the COVID-19 pandemic (Salari et al., 2020). This finding can be attributed to social isolation, financial hardship, fear of catching the virus, media attention, and the uncertainty of the future (Almeida et al., 2020). These stressors can activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, disrupting regular hormone release and resulting in amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and premenstrual syndrome (Abu Helwa et al., 2018; Rafique & Al-Sheikh, 2018; Valsamakis et al., 2019). As expected, these changes were more noticeable during the pandemic than before (Demir et al., 2021; Kurdoğlu, 2021; Ozimek et al., 2022; Phelan et al., 2021).\n\nMenstrual Changes and Reversal of Amenorrhea Induced by Classic Psychedelics: A Case Series\n\nPublished in Journal of Psychoactive Drugs, 2022\n\nNatalie Gukasyan, Sasha K. Narayan\n\nApart from limitations associated with recall bias and self-reporting in collecting the above case histories, there was no confirmatory testing of the drugs ingested, so we were unable to confirm that the drugs used were correctly identified. For example, there are cases of N-2-methoxybenzyl (NBOMe) drugs being sold as LSD (Zawilska, Kacela, and Adamowicz 2020). However, many such drugs that may be passed off as LSD belong to the same pharmacologic class of 5-HT2A agonists. A further limitation is a lack of laboratory testing to characterize any associated hormonal levels or abnormalities, which limits our ability to accurately hypothesize the mechanisms involved. For the two women with amenorrhea, the likely cause was functional hypothalamic amenorrhea given the description of stressful events immediately preceding cessation of menses. Finally, for the third case, we did not have information about subsequent treatment or lifestyle changes that may have also contributed to improved regularity during the time of her microdosing experience.\n\nPremature ovarian insufficiency: a toolkit for the primary care physician\n\nPublished in Climacteric, 2021\n\nI. Lambrinoudaki, S. A. Paschou, M. A. Lumsden, S. Faubion, E. Makrakis, S. Kalantaridou, N. Panay\n\nIt is particularly important that careful consideration is given to assessing the age of menarche and the regularity of menses (Table 1). Early menarche has been associated with subsequent POI. Primary or secondary amenorrhea are the pathognomonic symptoms which characterize the diagnosis of POI. The initial presentation may be with oligomenorrhea (menstrual irregularity), but it is important that POI is not over-diagnosed in those with regular cycles and no history of menstrual disturbance1. Although amenorrhea is not officially diagnosed unless menstruation has been absent for 6 months, there is general agreement that it is justified to commence investigations if menstruation has been absent for 3–4 months. Changes in the length, heaviness or intervals of menstruation should also be investigated, whether or not there are co-existing symptoms. It must not be forgotten that there are other common causes of amenorrhea, e.g. pregnancy, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), hyperprolactinemia or hypothalamic dysfunction due to stress/weight loss and that these need to be excluded in subsequent investigations."
