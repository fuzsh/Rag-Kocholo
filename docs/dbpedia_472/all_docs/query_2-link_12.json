        "text": "A new class of \"2C\" serotonin 5-HT2A receptor-agonist designer drugs, dimethoxyphenyl-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl) methyl] ethanamine (NBOMe) derivatives, became popular and easily obtainable over the Internet, which has resulted in their abuse in the US, Europe and Asia. These drugs have been the cause of severe intoxications and even deaths. Among the 2C derivatives, N-Benzyl-Oxy-Methyl (NBOMe) derivatives are concerning mainly due to several reports in the literature associated with acute toxicity over the last six years; the majority of these cases are related to 25I-NBOMe. In forensic analyses, immunoassays are important screening techniques; however, difficulty arises in detecting the relatively newer 2C class compounds, such as 25I-NBOMe, particularly at lower drug concentrations. Several studies in recent years have demonstrated the utility of mass spectrometry–based methods in the screening and detection of NBOMe derivatives. Metabolism studies on NBOMe derivatives are also increasing in the literature, especially LC-HRMS techniques are included in most of them."
