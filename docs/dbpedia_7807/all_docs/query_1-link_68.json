        "text": "No, and this can be guessed from the modest number of citations his GR = QM paper has received. It is true that Einstein's equations have a connection to quantum information and this work form which Susskind extrapolates is certainly interesting. But it doesn't make any claim of being applicable to the most basic quantum gravity observables which have always been scattering amplitudes with internal or external gravitons. Standard QFT methods can only compute these if we introduce an unknown cut-off for the scale of new physics by hand. The most widely advocated proposal for improving this in real life goes something like the following.\n\nBuild very impressive experiments which establish the existence of small extra dimensions.\n\nPerform even more impressive experiments to find constraints on their shapes.\n\nClassify the string landscape to the point where these constraints are enough to point you to a unique vacuum.\n\nIdentify the QFT which is holographically dual to string theory around this background.\n\nSolve or find a powerful approximation to this QFT.\n\nThese steps are very much still in their infancy."
