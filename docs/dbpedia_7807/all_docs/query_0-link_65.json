        "text": "General\n\nWelcome to the APPH E3200x class information site.\n\nClassical mechanics intended for junior level applied physics students. Emphasis is placed on teaching fundamentals through applications, both historical and contemporary. The applications will also serve to illustrate the connections between the mathematical methods of classical mechanics and other areas of science. Finally, experimental examples will be given which indicate the limitations of classical dynamics and motivate modern physics.\n\nThis year's course will also introduce students to computational physics through the solution of a variety of interesting problems in classical mechanics. AP E3200x does not require prior programming experience. By the end of the semester, students will be comfortable in the construction and solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe mechanics. Modern desktop scientific computing allows students to visualize complex solutions and to confirm algebraic solutions.\n\nMechanics is both a fundamental branch of physics and an essential skill for design, manipulation, and control of modern technology. Mechanics underlies all engineered systems, and the techniques developed in mechanics can be applied to analogous electrical systems.\n\nThe usual pre-requists for AP E3200x are:\n\nPHYS W1401x Introduction to mechanics and thermodynamics\n\nPHYS W1402y Introduction to electricity, magnetism, and optics\n\nMATH V1201x or y Calculus, III\n\nAlso very useful is MATH V2030x or y Ordinary differential equations or APMA E2101y Introduction to Applied Mathematics.\n\nKey topics covered include:\n\nLinear and nonlinear oscillations, the pendulum, and deterministic chaos\n\nGravitation and Kepler's laws of planetary motion\n\nCoupled oscillators and \"waves\"\n\nHamilton's Principle and Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Dynamics\n\nMotion in a rotating (noninertial) frame\n\nDynamics of Rigid Bodies (and angular momentum and the inertial tenor)\n\nThe goal of this course is to provide a solid understanding of both the mathematical formalism of applied mechanics and to introduce students to applications of mechanics to modern engineered systems.\n\nWikipedia's page for Mechanics (which has a nice historical overview)\n\nStanford's Leonard Susskind (born and raised in New York City and creating founder of \"string theory\") recorded a short course on Classical Mechanics available on YouTube:\n\n(September 26, 2011) Leonard Susskind gives a brief introduction to the mathematics behind physics including the addition and multiplication of vectors as well as velocity and acceleration in terms of particles.\n\n(October 3, 2011) Leonard Susskind discusses the some of the basic laws and ideas of modern physics. In this lecture, he focuses on some of the incorrect laws of motion that were first proposed by Aristotle. While they are invalid they provide some insight into how modern physics has developed to the state it is at today.\n\n(October 10, 2011) Leonard Susskind discusses Lagrangian functions as they relate to coordinate systems and forces in a system.\n\n(October 17, 2011) Leonard Susskind discusses the some of the basic laws and ideas of modern physics. In this lecture, he focuses symmetry and conservation laws, including the principle of least action and Lagrangian methods.\n\n(October 24, 2011) Leonard Susskind discusses different particle transformations as well as how to represent and analyze them using tools like the LaGrangian.\n\n(November 1, 2011) Leonard Susskind discusses the some of the basic laws and ideas of modern physics. In this lecture, he focuses on the motion of objects. He starts with a general example of a wedge on a frictionless plane and uses it as the building block for more complicated theory.\n\n(November 7, 2011) Leonard Susskind discusses the some of the basic laws and ideas of modern physics. In this lecture, he focuses on Liouville's Theorem, which he describes as one of the basis for Hamiltonian mechanics. He works to prove the reversibility of classical mechanics.\n\n(November 14, 2011) Leonard Susskind discusses the some of the basic laws and ideas of modern physics. In this lecture, he looks closely at the concept of angular momentum and Poisson Brackets. He derives the basic angular momentum equations and shows how they can describe this fundamental type of motion.\n\n(November 21, 2011) Leonard Susskind discusses the some of the basic laws and ideas of modern physics. In this lecture, he dives into the topics of magnetic and electrostatic forces. He derives these forces to show their relationship to magnetic fields and potential.\n\n(November 28, 2011) Leonard Susskind wraps up the lecture series by finishing his talk on particles and both electric and magnetic fields and how they relate to physics.\n\nThe world's most accurate clock\n\nNASA's orbital debri map and information"
