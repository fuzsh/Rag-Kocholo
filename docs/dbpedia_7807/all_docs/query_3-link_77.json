        "text": "To the Editor:\n\nFor an experimental physicist like me, the Book Review of Jan. 15 held two items of great interest. There is a long letter from Lisa Randall (theorist, Harvard) and a review of a new book, \"The Cosmic Landscape,\" by Leonard Susskind (theorist, Stanford). They have very different views on where physics model-building is going.\n\nRandall is one of the leaders of those working on the implications of models with more than the standard 3-space and 1-time dimensions. She and her colleagues believe that not only can some of the problems of modern physics be explained, but that models like hers have testable predictions. She spends a good part of her time trying to define such tests, which are necessarily subtle.\n\nSusskind also is a believer in extra dimensions. He has been one of the pioneers of string theory as it has evolved to what is now called brane- or M-theory. As Corey Powell points out in his review of Susskind's book, M-theory has no unique solutions (as yet). This has given rise to what is called the \"Landscape\" vision, in which our universe is only one among zillions of separate and noncommunicating universes, each with somewhat different properties. Ours happens to have the forces and structure necessary for life and that is all that can be said. There are no tests that can \"see\" these other universes.\n\nSusskind and the Landscape school have given up. To them the reductionist voyage that has taken physics so far has come to an end. Since that is what they believe, I can't understand why they don't take up something else -- macram√©, for example."
