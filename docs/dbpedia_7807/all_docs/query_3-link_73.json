        "text": "Full transcript of physicist Leonard Susskind’s TEDx Talk on Richard Feynman at TEDxCaltech conference.\n\nListen to the MP3 Audio: Leonard Susskind on Richard Feynman at TEDxCaltech\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nI can’t see the audience and I hate that. How many great grandparents are there in the audience? Damn it! I can’t see anything.\n\nOkay. You’re probably wondering why I’m sitting and the answer is because I’m a great grandfather, not a good grandfather, great-grandfather. And as everybody knows great-grandparents get to do any damn thing they please, including following my own grandfather’s advice which was whenever you give a talk to a thousand people about Richard Feynman, sustain yourself.\n\nThis is an extremely slick operation and I’m not a slick man. So I don’t use these things.\n\nI decided when I was asked to do this that what I really wanted to talk about was my friend, Richard Feynman. I was one of the fortunate few that really did get to know him and enjoyed his presence. And I’m going to tell you about the Richard Feynman that I knew. I’m sure there are people here who could tell you about the Richard Feynman they knew, and it would probably be a different Richard Feynman.\n\nRichard Feynman was a very complex man. He was a man of many, many parts. He was, of course, foremost, a very, very, very great scientist. He was an actor. You saw him act. I also had the good fortune to be in those lectures, up in the balcony. They were fantastic. He was a philosopher. He was a drum player. He was a teacher par excellence."
