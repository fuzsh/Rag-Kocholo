CHIEF

(Last Update: Tuesday, 13FEB2024) (POC LOCATION: HMMM… ENLISTED WEARING KHAKIS;) OH, & THEY ENJOY BEING CALLED “SIR” & “MA’AM” TOO;)

Chief Petty Officer (CPO) – The seventh enlisted rank (with the paygrade E-7) in the United States Navy is above Petty Officer First Class and below Senior Chief Petty Officer. The term “rating” is used to identify enlisted job specialties. In this way, enlisted personnel are segregated into three segments containing different enlisted ranks. Furthermore, rates are broken down into three levels: non-rated members without a designated occupation (E-1 through E-3). Advancement to E-4 and above is dependent on graduating from a specialty school that defines what the enlisted is rated for. Petty officers (E-4 through E-6) and chief petty officers (E-7 through E-9) are part of the rated force and are considered extremely knowledgeable about their particular rating. The term rating is used to identify the career field of a chief petty officer. The grade of chief petty officer was established on 1 April 1893 in the United States Navy.

CHOKE POINT

(Last Update: Wednesday, 14FEB2024) (POC LOCATION: N3 OPERATIONS)

In military strategy, a choke point is a geographical feature on land such as a valley, defile or bridge, or maritime passage through a critical waterway such as a strait, which an armed force is forced to pass through to reach its objective, sometimes on a substantially narrowed front and therefore greatly decreasing its combat effectiveness by making it harder to bring superior numbers to bear. A choke point can allow a numerically inferior defending force to use the terrain as a force multiplier to thwart or ambush a much larger opponent, as the attacker cannot advance any further without first securing passage through the choke point.

Some choke points, with important locations in parentheses:

Strait of Hormuz between Oman and Iran at the entrance to the Persian Gulf

Bab-el-Mandeb passage from the Arabian Sea to the Red Sea (Yemen and Socotra)

Strait of Malacca between Malaysia and Sumatra (Indonesia)

Panama Canal and the Panama Pipeline connecting the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans

Suez Canal and the Sumed Pipeline connecting the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea (Egypt)

Strait of Gibraltar along the Atlantic Ocean entering the Mediterranean Sea (Spain, Gibraltar, and Morocco)

Strait of Dover or the English Channel separating the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea (England and France)

ENLISTED LEADER DEVELOPMENT (ELD)

(Last Update: Thursday, 21MAR2024) (POC LOCATION: TRAINING)

The Enlisted Leader Development (ELD) continuum replaced the Petty Officer Selectee Leadership courses and created a more efficient and deliberate process to train our enlisted leaders. Its framework delivers a “character-focused” learning continuum based on foundational courses delivered throughout an enlisted Sailor’s career, SAILOR 360, self-study, on-the-job training (OJT), and feedback received from coaches, mentors, and advocates.

For more information and to sign up to take or host these courses, go to MyNavy Portal (MNP) (CAC login required). Navigate from the top menu to “Career & Life Events” > “Training, Education, Qualifications” and in the left-hand menu “Training” > “Enlisted Leader Development.”

For the latest ELD requirements read NAVADMIN 254/21.
