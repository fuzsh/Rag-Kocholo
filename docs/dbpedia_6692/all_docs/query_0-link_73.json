In the example below, the author is the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations and the publisher is the Department of the Navy.\n\nIn the example above, the author is NOT an umbrella organization, signatory, or any of the following:\n\nChief of Naval Operations\n\nDeputy Chief of Naval Operations\n\nW. F. Moran\n\nDepartment of Defense\n\nNavy Pentagon\n\nR. P.

A citation is not needed when all elements of the figure are your own creation.\n\nIf you use the figure exactly as it appears in the source, use\n\n“Source: ___.”\n\nIf you alter the original figure or use someone else's image or data to create the figure, use “Adapted from ___.”\n\nFigure 1.

CMOS 14.57\n\nPlace each footnote at the end of the clause containing the information it cites. CMOS 14.26\n\nNever place more than one footnote at the end of a sentence. CMOS 14.28\n\nIn the paragraph below, the reference numbers are highlighted in yellow and the signal phrases are highlighted in blue. Note that the second sentence is common knowledge, whereas the final sentence does not need a citation because it is the opinion of the author. (See \"How Often to Cite?\")\n\nIn a Journal of Restaurant Marketing article, restaurateur Shawna Jackson contends that a restaurant’s color scheme influences how hungry its patrons are.1 Consider popular fast-food restaurants, which often use red and yellow in their advertising and décor. According to a study by Roberta Chen and David Lopez, restaurant customers feel energized in red and yellow environments, which encourages them to order more food.2 The same study indicates that patrons felt relaxed in blue and purple environments, which causes them to “spend more time considering the menu options and eat at a slower pace.”3 Although blue décor can give a restaurant a casual, laid-back feel, industry experts believe this color can negatively affect profit.4 Accordingly, it is difficult to identify a popular restaurant chain that decorates with calmer hues.\n\n* Note: no page number is necessary in footnote 1 because the sentence describes the source’s general argument rather than data or analysis from a specific location in the source.\n\n1 Shawna Jackson, “Color’s Effect on Restaurant Patrons,” Journal of Restaurant Marketing 13, no. 4 (April 1999).\n\n2 Roberta Chen and David Lopez, Color Me Hungry: How to Decorate Your Restaurant to Increase Profit and Patronage (New York: Routledge, 2009), 3.\n\n3 Chen and Lopez, 29.\n\n4 Jackson, “Color’s Effect on Restaurant Patrons,” 18; Chen and Lopez, Color Me Hungry, 74–76.\n\nThe Chicago Manual of Style advises that “footnotes should be placed where you need them. . . . Whenever you can imagine the reader asking ‘Says who’ you should add a note.” Clarity is your goal as a writer, and what constitutes clear attribution in any given context will depend to some extent on the particulars of your text. Nevertheless, the following are some reliable rules of thumb:\n\nUse a footnote (even if you also use a signal phrase) the first time you quote, paraphrase, or otherwise use material from a source in your paragraph.\n\nAlways use footnotes for direct quotes.\n\nUse footnotes, signal phrases, or sentence flow to indicate ongoing use of this same material.\n\nBe sure to use a footnote again when drawing upon information from a different location in the source (see rules for including page numbers).\n\nWhen citing an online document (for example, a thesis, report, or journal article) in a full note or listing it in the references, if possible, provide a DOI. If the source does not have a DOI, link to the document itself (PDF, etc.) or to the landing page that directs the reader to the full text.\n\nDo not insert a hard or soft return within the URL string: doing so breaks the link.\n\nIn footnotes, the page number(s) is needed when\n\nQuoting – Always include\n\nParaphrasing – Always include\n\nSummarizing – Include if summarizing a single continuous passage in a work\n\nExample\n\nN: Michael Pollan and Daisy Potatohead, The Omnivore’s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals (New York: Penguin, 2006), 99–100.\n\nS: Pollan and Potatohead, The Omnivore’s Dilemma, 100.\n\nIf unsure, include the page number(s).\n\nNo page number is needed in a footnote when you are referring to the source as a whole. For example: “George W. Bush’s Decision Points recounts pivotal moments during his time in office.”\n\nIf the source does not contain page numbers, often with electronic formats, include as much information as needed for the reader to locate the material. In citations especially of shorter electronic works presented as a single, searchable document, such locators may be unnecessary.\n\nLocator Options Examples chapter number chap. 2 paragraph number para. 3 section heading\n\nsec. 24\n\ndescriptive phrase under \"The Battleground\" location numbers loc. 444 of 3023, Kindle page numbers check against—and cite to—the printed version if possible table, figure, or slide number table 1.4\n\nfig. 3\n\nslide 5\n\nSee CMOS 14.22: Page numbers and other locators.\n\nSee also 14.160: Page or location numbers in electronic formats.\n\nIn the list of references/bibliography\n\nFor portions of larger documents, such as journal articles and book chapters, include the page range.\n\nExample\n\nB: Haynes, Peter. “Al-Qaeda, Oil Dependence, and U.S. Foreign Policy.” In Energy Security and Global Politics: The Militarization of Resource Management, edited by Daniel Moran and James A. Russell, 62–74. New York: Routledge, 2009.\n\nWhen citing a source retrieved online, use the \"online\" format even when you or someone else printed out the material. For example, if you print out a thesis or your advisor provides you with a printed thesis, it is still categorized as an online document.\n\nOnly cite as a print source when the material has been produced by a publisher in hard copy. For example, if you obtain a print journal or book from the library stacks, it is categorized as a printed source.\n\nAn indirect source is a source that cites some other work that you discuss in your text.\n\nWhenever possible, consult primary sources and your sources’ sources yourself. Upon investigation of the primary source, you may find you disagree with the indirect source author’s analysis or methods.\n\nHow to Incorporate Indirect Sources\n\nThe following passage incorporates a properly credited indirect source. The indirect source information is highlighted in yellow; the primary source information is highlighted in blue.\n\nWalker describes Miguel Roig’s 1999 experiment, which correlates inadequate paraphrasing in student writing with poor reading comprehension.1 Citing Roig’s data, Walker explains that “students do in fact possess skills necessary for paraphrasing but … may be impeded from applying those skills when dealing with rigorous text.”2\n\nNote: Footnotes for indirect sources must cite both the primary and the indirect source; in the references list, include only the indirect source (the source you consulted—see example).\n\nFor more information\n\nSee the TPO's \"Citing Your Sources’ Sources\" handout.\n\nA citation is required if you did not wholly create the table—i.e., if you used someone else's data. A citation is not needed when all elements of the table are your own creation.\n\nIf you use the table exactly as it appears in the source, use\n\n“Source: ___.”\n\nIf you alter the original table or if you use someone else's data to create the table, use “Adapted from ___.”\n\nTable 1.
