        "text": "Well, they all vary, some I can name off the top of my head are CNV for Convoy used by the USN. There’s also PAT for Priority Air Transport. Air Transport / Mobility (C-17’s and such) use RCH (Reach), and lastly, CGX is used for Coast Guard ops.\n\nThe Air Force really won’t have a general ICAO code, most of it varies my squadron. Like how the 2nd BW Squadron for B-52’s use DUECE52 or the USN and VF-16 with PELCN06 (Pelican 06).\n\nKamryn, what you listed are callsigns (not entirely sure if that’s what OP wanted but I don’t know either).\n\nIf you head to the ICAO site I’ve linked below, you will be able to insert an aircraft manufacturer and it’ll list their aircraft. For example, if you type in “General Dynamics,” all F16s will come up.\n\nhttps://www.icao.int/publications/doc8643/pages/search.aspx\n\nIf you don’t want to do that much work, the site below has a compiled list of basically all aircraft that have had an ICAO identifier."
