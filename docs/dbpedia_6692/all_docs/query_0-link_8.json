Blazich Jr., PhD\n\nNaval History and Heritage Command\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis document is intended to provide readers with a chronological progression of the activities of the United States Navy and its involvement with World War I as an outside observer, active participant, and victor engaged in the war’s lingering effects in the postwar period. The document is not a comprehensive timeline of every action, policy decision, or ship movement. What is provided is a glimpse into how the 20th century’s first global conflict influenced the Navy and its evolution throughout the conflict and the immediate aftermath. The source base is predominately composed of the published records of the Navy and the primary materials gathered under the supervision of Captain Dudley Knox in the Historical Section in the Office of Naval Records and Library. A thorough chronology remains to be written on the Navy’s actions in regard to World War I. The nationality of all vessels, unless otherwise listed, is the United States.\n\nAll errors and omissions are solely those of the author.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n1914........................................ ................................................................2 1915........................................ ................................................................4 1916........................................ ..............................................................11 1917........................................ ..............................................................16 1918........................................ ..............................................................87 1919......................................... ............................................................147 1920........................................ ............................................................157 1921........................................ ............................................................158 1922........................................ ............................................................159\n\n[1]\n\n1914\n\n4 August President Woodrow Wilson issues a proclamation for a policy of neutrality in regard to the conflict in Europe.[i]\n\n5 August Senate and House of Representatives pass House Joint Resolution 314 for the relief, protection, and transportation of American citizens in Europe away from the emerging conflict. The resolution authorized the armed forces to deliver gold abroad, empowering the president “to employ officers, employees, and vessels of the United States and use any supplies of the naval or military establishments, and to charter and employ any vessels that may be required with an appropriation not to exceed $2.5 million.”[ii]\n\n6 August At 10:20 p.m., the armored cruiser Tennessee (CA-10) sails from New York Harbor for Falmouth, England carrying $3 million in gold from private banking interests and $1.5 million in gold coin from a Congressional appropriation to provide financial relief to Americans caught up in the outbreak of World War I. Aboard Tennessee are a delegation of Army officers, additional Navy and Marine Corps officers, five bankers, representatives of the banking interests sending private funds, five representatives of the Treasury Department, a State Department diplomatic advisor, the national director of the American Red Cross and his secretary, and eight War Department clerks and a messenger. Under the auspices of the United States Relief Commission in Europe, the funds are intended to shore up the collapsed European credit system to enable the 125,000 Americans and their interests stranded abroad means to return home.[iii]\n\n7 August Armored cruiser North Carolina (CA-12) and collier Vulcan (AC-5) sail from the Boston Navy Yard and rendezvous off Cape Cod with the armored cruiser Tennessee (CA-10) bound for Falmouth, England.[iv]\n\n15 August U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire Henry Morgenthau wires Secretary of State William J. Bryan about receiving requests from U.S. interests in the Ottoman cities of Beirut and Smyrna (modern day Izmir) demanding U.S. warships be sent to protect American lives and property.[v]\n\n16 August Armored cruiser Tennessee (CA-10) arrives in Falmouth, England, at 7:45 p.m. The following day, $400,000 in gold is sent to London, with $300,000 consigned to U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain Walter Hines Page with the other $100,000 provided to two U.S. Army officers for relief work.[vi]\n\n18–19 August Armored cruiser North Carolina (CA-12) sails from Falmouth, England, and arrives in Cherbourg, France, the following day carrying $200,000 in gold and additional American officials for the U.S. Relief Commission in Europe.[vii]\n\n20 August Armored cruiser Tennessee (CA-10) sails from Falmouth, England, for the Hook of Holland.[viii]\n\n______________\n\n[i] U.S. Department of State, Foreign Relations of the United States, (FRUS) 1914, Supplement, The World War (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office [GPO], 1928), 547–51.\n\n[ii] U.S. War Department, Report on Operations of United States Relief Commission in Europe (Washington, DC: GPO, 1914), 1–2.\n\n[iii] War Department, Report on Operations, 1–2.\n\n[iv] Branden Little, “Evacuating Wartime Europe: U.S. Policy, Strategy, and Relief Operations for Overseas American Travelers, 1914–15,” Journal of Military History 79, no. 4 (October 2015): 944; Arthur S.

Mustin, Lieutenant Patrick N. L. Bellinger, and 1st Lieutenant Bernard L. Smith, USMC, travel to Paris, for a two-day tour of aircraft factories and aerodromes in the immediate area. This temporary assignment, the first use of naval aviators as observers in foreign lands, is a precedent for assignment of aviation assistances to naval attaches, which begins the same month when Lieutenant John H. Towers is sent to London.[i]\n\n21 August Armored cruiser Tennessee (CA-10) arrives off the Hook of Holland at 4:40 p.m., three miles outside Dutch territorial waters, and is met by the Dutch cruiser Nord-Brabrant, which will accompany American officials and $200,000 in gold ashore to The Hague.[ii]\n\n29 August Armored cruiserNorth Carolina (CA-12) sails from Falmouth, England, destined for Turkish waters carrying $150,000 in gold relief funds for American-owned institutions and businesses cut off from usual channels of commerce and banking because of the war.[iii]\n\n16 November Turkish shore batteries fire on the launch carrying the commanding officer of armored cruiser Tennessee (CA-10) from his ship into the city of Smyrna. The commander and crew on the launch are uninjured, but the incident results in several diplomatic exchanges with American officials, who are thereafter instructed to obey Turkish orders relating to port entry.[iv]\n\n16 November An administrative reorganization at Pensacola, Florida, shifts overall command from the station ship to the headquarters ashore and the station is officially designated as Naval Aeronautic Station Pensacola.[v]\n\n23 November The office of Director of Naval Aeronautics is established to designate the officer in charge of naval aviation, with Captain Mark L. Bristol, already serving in that capacity, being ordered to report to the Secretary of the Navy under the new title.[vi]\n\n23 November Director of Naval Aeronautics Captain Mark L. Bristol establishes requirements for special meteorological equipment to be installed at the ends of the speed course at Pensacola, Florida, to measure and record velocity and direction of winds, gusts, and squalls.[vii]\n\n1 December Rear Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan dies at age 74 in Washington, D.C.[viii]\n\n26 December The U.S. government sends the British government a diplomatic protest against the British seizure and detention of U.S. cargoes on the high seas destined for neutral ports.[ix]\n\n______________\n\n[i] Roy A.

Frye is captured by German auxiliary cruiser Prinz Eitel Friedrich in the South Atlantic, southeast of Brazil.[i]\n\n28 January President Woodrow Wilson signs legislation establishing the U.S. Coast Guard through the merger of the U.S. Life-Saving Service and Revenue Cutter Service.[ii]\n\n4 February Germany declares a submarine war zone in the waters around Great Britain and Ireland beginning 19 February and announces that enemy merchant ships will be destroyed and neutral vessels will be warned of potential danger.[iii]\n\n10 February The U.S. government protests to Germany against the risks created by the 4 February German decree of a submarine war zone around the British Isles. The U.S. government also protests to the British against the use of neutral U.S. flags on British vessels to protect the ships from submarine attack.[iv]\n\n19 February The steamship Evelyn is sunk by mines in the North Sea near Isle of Borkum, Germany, 10 miles west of Norderney, killing one man.[v]\n\n20 February The U.S. government sends identical messages to the British and German governments expressing American desires for both belligerents to find basis through reciprocal concessions “which will relieve neutral ships engaged in peaceful commerce from the great dangers which they will incur in the high seas adjacent to the coasts of the belligerents.” The American multi-part suggestion is to ask both countries to identify and minimize the use of sea mines, not use submarines to attack merchant vessels of any nationality except to enforce the right of visit and search, and that both nations will require their respective merchant vessels not to use neutral flags for purpose of disguise. The U.S. government also asks that American food and foodstuffs shipped into Germany be only sent for civilian purposes under American oversight and that the British, in turn, agree to not consider food and foodstuffs contraband and not interfere with shipments to Germany while under American oversight.[vi]\n\n22 February The cargo ship Carib strikes a mine and sinks in the North Sea with a loss of three men.[vii]\n\n3 March President Woodrow Wilson signs multiple key pieces of legislation into law which will impact the Navy’s entry and actions in World War I. The Naval Appropriations Act included an act authorizing construction of 2 battleships, 6 destroyers, and 18 submarines; creation of the position of Chief of Naval Operations; and the establishment of the U.S. Naval Reserve Force. The legislation notes that “There shall be a Chief of Naval Operations, who shall be an officer on the active list of the Navy appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, from the officers of the line of the Navy not below the grade of Captain for a period of four years, who shall, under the direction of the Secretary, be charged with the operations of the fleet, and with the preparation and readiness of plans for its use in war.”[viii]\n\n________________\n\n[i] Navy Department, American Ship Casualties of the World War including Naval Vessels, Merchant Ships, Sailing Vessels, and Fishing Craft (Washington, DC: GPO, 1923), 7.\n\n[ii] Alex R.

Roosevelt attends a General Board of the U.S. Navy meeting on the upcoming Atlantic Fleet exercises. Roosevelt suggests, and the Board approves, a plan to make the exercises “serve an object lesson to the country.” Specifically, the exercises were crafted to build public support for a larger navy and battle cruisers.[i]\n\n22 March The title “Naval Aviator” replaces the former “Navy Air Pilot” designation for naval officers qualified as aviators.[ii]\n\n25 March Submarine F-4 sinks following an accident during maneuvers off Honolulu, Hawaii, to a depth of 305 feet with the loss of her commanding officer and crew of 21 sailors. The submarine is later located and then raised on 29 August after considerable effort.[iii]\n\n28 March British passenger ship Falaba is sunk by German submarine U-28 off the southern coast of Ireland. American passenger Leon C. Thresher, a mining engineer en route to the Gold Coast colony [Ghana], drowns in the sinking. Thresher is the first American civilian killed in the war as a result of German naval action.[iv]\n\n1 April Rear Admiral Bradley A. Fiske resigns as Aide for Operations, although Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels requests he remain at his post for an additional period of time.[v]\n\n2 April The cargo ship Greenbrier strikes a mine and sinks in the North Sea near Amrum, Germany.[vi]\n\n11 April The German auxiliary cruiser SMS Kronprinz Wilhelm stops off Cape Henry, Virginia, after eight months at sea and is interned by the U.S. government.[vii]\n\n16 April The Curtiss AB-2 flying boat is successfully catapulted from a barge by Lieutenant Patrick N. L. Bellinger at Pensacola, Florida.[viii]\n\n28 April A German aircraft bombs the tanker Cushing near North Hinder Lightship in the North Sea between Great Britain and The Netherlands causing damage but no injuries.[ix]\n\n1 May A German submarine torpedoes tanker Gulflight 20 miles west of Isles of Scilly, England, killing three men. This is the first U.S. merchant vessel torpedoed and sunk by a submarine in World War I.[x]\n\n7 May German submarine U-20 torpedoes and sinks British passenger liner RMS Lusitania off the Old Head of Kinsale, Ireland. A total of 1,198 passengers are killed, including 124 Americans.[xi]\n\n11 May Captain William S. Benson assumes the newly established post of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and is promoted to rear admiral. Benson had been a captain in command of the Philadelphia Navy Yard when selected to be CNO. Rear Admiral Bradley A. Fiske, having previously resigned as Aid for Operations, retires the same day.

Secretary of State William J. Bryan states: “The Imperial German Government will not expect the Government of the United States to omit any word or any act necessary to the performance of its sacred duty of maintaining the rights of the United States and its citizens and of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment.”[i]\n\n17–18 May President Woodrow Wilson, aboard the presidential yacht Mayflower (PY-1), and Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, aboard the gunboat Dolphin (PG-24), together review the Atlantic Fleet in New York Harbor. The fleet numbered 64 ships, including 16 battleships, assembled after months of training in Cuban waters off Guantanamo and target practice off the Chesapeake Capes.[ii]\n\n25 May A German submarine torpedoes and damages the cargo ship Nebraskan 40 miles southwest of Southcliffe, Ireland, which is later salvaged.[iii]\n\n26 May Rear Admiral Austin M. Knight, Naval War College President, releases his official report on the 1915 Atlantic Fleet exercises. His analysis highlights the great danger posed to the Navy by its lack of battle cruisers, focusing especially on the impossibility of maintaining a credible cruiser screen in front of the main fleet. Knight’s analysis is echoed by the popular press.[iv]\n\n1 June The Navy awards its first contract for a lighter-than-air craft to the Connecticut Aircraft Company, New Haven, Connecticut, for one non-rigid airship which is later designated DN-1.[v]\n\n1 June The German government sends a supplementary note to the U.S. government in regard to the tankers Gulflight and Cushing incidents of 28 April and 1 May 1915.[vi]\n\n9 June The U.S. government, in a second note relating to the sinking of the British passenger liner RMS Lusitania, requests that Germany adopt the necessary measures to safeguard American lives, property, and ships on the high seas and asks for assurances that this will be done.[vii]\n\n25 June Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels orders the discontinuance of the Naval Aide System, in place since 1909, as the duties and responsibilities of the aides now fall under the purview of the Office of Chief of Naval Operations.[viii]\n\n29 June The Austro-Hungarian Minister for Foreign Affairs submits a protest to the United States regarding the shipment of arms and ammunition to Great Britain and her allies.[ix]\n\n7 July Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels writes Thomas A. Edison, inviting him to become the head of a planned Naval Consulting Board, intended to bring the nation’s top scientists and inventors in close consultation with the Navy on emerging technologies of naval warfare.

The German government further proposes that an increase in the number of available steamers be placed in service under the U.S. flag to allow American citizens traveling to Europe safe passage rather that “travel to Europe in time of war on ships carrying an enemy flag.” If this is not possible, the German government “is prepared to interpose no objections to the placing under the American flag by the U.S. Government of four enemy passenger steamers for the passenger traffic between America and England.”[i]\n\n10 July Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels authorizes the Washington Navy Yard to outfit a building for testing aeronautic machinery, beginning what will become the Aeronautical Engine Laboratory.[ii]\n\n10 July General Order No. 153 prescribes a standard organization for an aeronautic force within the Naval Militia, with a composition paralleling that of other forces established at the same time. This consisted of sections of not more than 6 officers and 28 enlisted men; two sections forming a division. Officers were in the “aeronautics duty only” category, the highest rank provided being that of lieutenant commander at the division level. Its enlisted structure provided that men taken in under regular ratings of machinist mates and electricians would perform duties as aeronautic machinists; carpenter mates would perform duties as aeronautic mechanics; and landsmen, the equivalent of strikers today, would perform special duties.[iii]\n\n21 July The U.S. government replies to the German diplomatic note of 8 July and “regrets to be obliged to say that it has found it very unsatisfactory,” concluding that “Friendship itself prompts it to say to the Imperial Government that repetition by the commanders of German naval vessels of acts in contravention of those rights must be regarded . . . when they affect American citizens, as deliberately unfriendly.”[iv]\n\n22 July Based on recommendations received from Naval Aeronautic Station Pensacola, the Director of Naval Aeronautics establishes requirements for 13 instruments to be installed in service aircraft: air speed meter, incidence indicator, tachometer, skidding and sideslip indicator, altitude barometer, oil gauge, fuel gauge, compass, course and distance indicator, magazine camera, binoculars, clock, and sextant. All except the navigational instruments, camera, binoculars, and clock are also required for training aircraft.[v]\n\n25 July A German submarine fires on, torpedoes, and sinks the cargo ship Leelanaw off the north coast of Scotland about 60 miles northwest of Orkney Islands.[vi]\n\n27 July After President Woodrow Wilson tells Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels to prepare for a large building program in 1916, the General Board of the U.S. Navy sets a new policy of matching “the most powerful [fleet] maintained by another nation . . . not later than 1925.” The board tentatively agrees that battle cruisers must be included in the next building program.[vii]\n\n_____________\n\n[i] Department of State, FRUS, 1915, Supplement, 463–66.\n\n[ii] Grossnick, Naval Aviation, 17.\n\n[iii] Ibid.\n\n[iv] Department of State, FRUS, 1915, Supplement, 480–82.\n\n[v] Grossnick, Naval Aviation, 17.\n\n[vi] Navy Department, Ship Casualties, 8.\n\n[vii] Proceedings and Hearings of the General Board of the U.S. Navy 1900–1950, Roll 3: January 3, 1913–December 29, 1916 (Washington, DC: National Archives Microfilm Publications, 1987), 199–200.\n\n[7]\n\n4 August The steel-hulled sailing bark Pass of Balmaha surrenders to a German submarine in the North Sea. It is later converted into the German commerce raider SMS Seeadler.[i]\n\n5 August Lieutenant Patrick N. L. Bellinger, flying the Burgess-Dunne AH-10, spots mortar fire for Army shore batteries at Fort Monroe, Virginia, signaling his spots with a flare pistol.[ii]\n\n19 August German submarine U-24 sinks the British passenger liner RMS Arabic 50 miles off Kinsale, Ireland. Forty-four passengers die in the sinking, including two Americans.[iii]\n\n29 August President Woodrow Wilson signs legislation, which would make the Coast Guard part of the Navy in time of war.[iv]\n\n1 September The German ambassador to the United States declares that passenger liners will not be sunk by German submarines without warning and without regard for the safety of the lives of non-combatants provided that the liners do not try to escape or offer resistance. This comes in response to the sinking of the British passenger liners RMS Lusitania and Arabic.[v]\n\n4 September The British passenger liner RMS Hesperian is torpedoed by German submarine U-20—the same U-boat commanded by Kapitanleutnant Walther Schweiger who sank the British passenger liner RMS Lusitania—with the loss of 26 lives.
