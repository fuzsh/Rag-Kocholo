They influence how we think about, choose, and act towards goals that we might not otherwise consider. But games do more than entertain us.

Do you have free will? Are your emotions, - sadness, anger, joy - simply the product of brain activity? Is there a soul or consciousness that lasts after death? Is death the end? Or is there something beyond, a mind beyond the brain? And how can we train the mind to change the brain? In this course, we are going to explore the relationship between the brain and the self.

Students will use critical thinking skills to create their own case study based on the (NCBI) National Center for Biotechnology Information published research papers along with other institutionalized research papers. Students are expected to use their new skills to analyze research papers under the scope of the course. The NCBI advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information for all individuals, despite their background in education. Through this course, students will be able to learn about ketoacidosis, and the various ways it can develop by reading and analyzing research papers and creating their own case studies. In this course, students also have the opportunity to work with UCR Pre-SOMA’s Health Disparities Initiative and gain community service credit. UCR Pre-SOMA stands for the Undergraduate division of the Student Osteopathic Medical Association. Osteopathic Medicine as a whole stands for holistic health, wherein the mind, body, and soul are taken into account when looking into a diagnosis for the patient. Health Disparities are defined as the preventable burdens in one’s access to healthcare and one’s ability to obtain health. In the HDI program, we strive to encourage the community to look beyond the biological as to how their health may be impacted by their socioeconomic status and racial background.
