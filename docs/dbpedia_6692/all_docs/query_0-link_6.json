        "text": "How to Use the \"Interviewer's Classification Guide\"\n\nThis manual is designed to aid the Interviewer in the classification of recruits. It contains information about the various duties for which recruits may be classified. These duties are grouped in the following main categories:\n\n(1) Ratings for which elementary Navy Service Schools are conducted.\n\n(2) Seaman and Fireman ratings.\n\n(3) Operational Schools.\n\nThe information concerning each rate or type of duty is presented under four general headings: Selection Qualifications, Job Description, Possible Sources, and Training Course. Under these four headings, the sub-headings are explained as follows:\n\nMINIMUM TEST SCORES: The minimum test scores represent the levels of test performance which differentiate most clearly between successful and unsuccessful performance in elementary Service Schools (according to data now available). The establishment of these scores is also determined, in part, by the needs of the Navy for specified numbers of men in various rates. The object has been to set the minimum scores at a level which would insure the inclusion of a sufficient number of men to meet the needs of the fleet, and, at the same time, to select those men most likely to meet the school requirements successfully. (No minimum test scores are included under operational schools, since men are assigned from General Detail.)\n\nIn general, it is expected that recruits selected for the various schools will have test scores above the specified minimum scores. On the other hand, rigid adherence to these standards is not expected. Each individual should be classified on the basis of numerous criteria, of which test scores are only one, and the test scores must be viewed in relation to the total picture. Thus, men who have had considerable experience in a field directly related to a rating should not be excluded solely on the basis of low test scores.\n\nAs new test validation becomes available, it is expected that corresponding changes in minimum test scores will be forwarded to the Selection Departments. Each Interviewer should make such corrections in his copy of the \"Interviewer's Classification Guide.\"\n\nAn asterisk placed after the test symbol, as for example, GCT* indicates that the designated test is of primary importance for that particular rating.\n\nPHYSICAL: The physical requirements have been included only in those instances in which it is possible for the Interviewer to apply a preliminary screening. It may be obvious that certain recruits do not meet specific requirements such as height, weight, or vision. The list of physical requirements is not always complete, since some traits cannot be determined by the Interviewer but will require a special physical examination.\n\nPERSONAL AND MISCELLANEOUS: Items such as age, personal traits, and similar material are included under the heading PERSONAL. The MISCELLANEOUS category includes schooling, experience, interests, etc.\n\nDUTIES: Under the heading DUTIES, the activities of the men in each rating are briefly described. This is not intended to be complete, but rather to present a picture of the general type of duties performed. Insofar as possible, this description should be viewed in terms of the aptitudes required for performing the job.\n\nEQUIPMENT: This section has been included to supplement the paragraph on DUTIES. It is also intended to furnish the Interviewer with information which may be of interest to certain recruits who have had experience in related civilian occupations.\n\nTYPES OF BILLETS: In some cases, more efficient classification may be effected by considering the recruit in terms of the billet in which he is likely to serve--i.e., whether he is more apt to be assigned to shore stations or to duty afloat. Personality factors such as the ability to get along with people may be important in assigning a man to a particular type of duty.\n\nThe phrase \"all ships but the smallest\", as used here, includes destroyers. \"The smallest\" are considered to be Patrol Craft, PT boats, minesweepers, converted small yachts, etc.\n\nRELATED CIVILIAN OCCUPATIONS: The procedure followed here, in the main, has been to use broad occupational titles, rather than the more specific ones used in the \"Dictionary of Occupational Titles\". The lists are not intended to be comprehensive, in any sense. Here again, it is suggested that the \"Related Civilian Occupations\" be viewed in terms of aptitudes for the Navy jobs. In other words, what are the functions common to the civilian job and the Navy job in question? For the purpose of ascertaining more specific relations between particular civilian jobs and Navy rates, the \"Dictionary of Occupational Titles\" and the \"Navy Occupational Conversion Tables\" are, of course, available.\n\nRELATED VOCATIONAL COURSES: In general, courses have not been included here if they are suggested by the RELATED CIVILIAN OCCUPATIONS. The list may therefore be considered suggestive rather than comprehensive.\n\nTRAINING COURSE: No attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive discussion of the training course, the purpose having been merely to indicate the general type of training. Its inclusion may be useful in informing the recruit about the school and in judging aptitude for it.\n\nFUNCTIONAL GROUPS:\n\nThe schools have been listed in alphabetical order, for the Interviewer's convenience. It should be kept in mind, however, that the ratings fall into functional groupings. The following classification is suggested, to assist Interviewers in considering the ratings from a functional point of view. It is important to remember that many recruits may be considered for several different ratings since the qualifications for jobs may be similar.\n\nGROUP I - Clerical and Communications: ARM, FCR, QM, RdM, RM, SK, SM, SoM, Sp (M), Y.\n\nGROUP II - Technical A: AEM, AerM, AMM, AOM, B, Basic Engr, EM, FC, MM, MoMM, RT, TM.\n\nGROUP III - Technical B: AM, AOM-Bomb Disposal, CM, GM, M, Ml, PM, SF, Sub, WT, Welder.\n\nGROUP IV - Instructional: SP (A), Sp (C).\n\nGROUP V - Miscellaneous: Bug, BM, HA & PhM, Laundryman, Mus, PhoM, PR, SC and Bkr, Sp(S).\n\nGROUP I - Primarily, the ratings in this group require considerable clerical aptitude. In the case of RdM and SoM, the clerical aptitude involved is one of coordinating numerous data, especially from control and indicator panels. With reference to RM and ARM, quick perceptions and the rapid recording of stimuli are the outstanding functions.\n\nGROUP II - Technical A - This group has been differentiated from Technical B because a greater amount of theoretical background is necessary. The importance of mathematics and physics is common to all the ratings listed under Technical A.\n\nGROUP III - Technical B - While a certain amount of theoretical background is involved, it is not so extensive nor so fundamental as for Technical A. Most of these ratings may be characterized by the term \"Artificer\". Manual skills and the characteristics of a general \"handy man\" are generally more important than theoretical knowledge.\n\nGROUP IV - Instructional - Functions of a teacher are common to this group, although to a lesser extent in the case of Sp (C).\n\nGROUP V - Miscellaneous - These ratings do not fall into any special functional categories.\n\nAEROGRAPHER'S MATE (AerM)\n\nSchool Code No. 74\n\nSELECTION QUALIFICATIONS\n\nMINIMUM TEST SCORES: GCT* 60; ARI 55; CLER 50.\n\nPHYSICAL: 12/20 vision in both eyes, corrected to 20/20.\n\nPERSONAL: Preferably over 21 years of age.
