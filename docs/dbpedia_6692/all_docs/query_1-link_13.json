        "text": "When I was growing up, I learned “the” lyrics to Here Comes the Bride at summer camp:\n\n“Here Comes the Bride\n\nAll fat and wide;\n\nWhere is the groom?\n\nHe’s in the dressing room.\n\nWhy is he there?\n\nHe lost his underwear.\n\nDa da da DAAAA da da da, da da dah.”\n\n(Nobody ever accused summer camp kids of being sensitive to the feelings of people with weight problems – or of knowing how hard it is to lose your underwear after you’re dressed, for that matter.)\n\nSince I am now a mature adult (cough cough), I know that the true lyrics to that song are really:\n\n“Treulich geführt\n\nziehet dahin,\n\nwo euch der Segen\n\nder Liebe bewahr!\n\nSiegreicher Mut,\n\nMinnegewinn\n\neint euch in Treue zum seligsten Paar.”\n\nBut that’s not what I’m looking for.\n\nI figure that, some time between the time when Wagner wrote Lohengrin and the time when I attended summer camp, somebody somewhere must have come up with some “Traditional English” lyrics for this song that start with the magic words:\n\nHere comes the bride,\n\nAll dressed in white.\n\nSo … what are the “real” English-language words to “Here Comes the Bride”?\n\nI remember, in the movie “The Best Years of Our Lives” there’s a home wedding at the end of the movie. As the bride descends the staircase to the first floor a chorus of little kids sings to the accompaniment of a piano. Let’s see how much I remember.\n\nHere comes the bride\n\nAll dressed in white\n\nSweetly, serenely (can’t recall)\n\nLovely to see\n\nMarching to thee\n\nTrue love united for eternity.\n\nForgot to add, the scene of the groom placing the ring on his bride’s finger in that movie is very moving. The camera pans around to all the faces of the guests watching. There are no words, but you can see the strain on their faces, desperately hoping it all goes well. See, the groom is a WWII navy veteran who has lost both hands, and he delicately holds the small gold band clamped between two hooks, as he puts the ring on the bride’s ring finger.\n\nContemporary composer John Rutter did a translation of the Lohengrin “Bridal Chorus” lyrics (click on the example link to view it) that goes like this:\n\n“Led here in faith, draw near with joy,\n\nLove’s guardian angel will watch over you!\n\nJoined in a bond none can destroy,\n\nNow you are one in your love ever true!”\n\nBut that was as late as 1995, apparently.\n\nSince Wagner’s opera Lohengrin was first performed in 1850, and the movie The Best Years of Our Lives in which Baker remembers hearing the non-parody “Here comes the bride” English version dates to 1946, that gives us about a century in which the English version must have originated. By the way, I spotted somebody else’s recollection of the English lyrics over on a wedding messageboard:\n\nThe folks over at STUMPERS-L have had a big fat discussion about this very question:\n\nTin Pan Alley composer Albert Tizer wrote a song in 1912 called “Here Comes the Bride” using bits of the Lohengrin march, although the Lew Brown lyrics are actually a girl’s lament about another girl who stole her man:\n\nSo evidently the “Bridal Chorus” theme was already familiarly associated with the English words “Here comes the bride” as early as 1912. But we still don’t know when or by whom that “all dressed in white, Sweetly, serenely” etc. verse was written."
