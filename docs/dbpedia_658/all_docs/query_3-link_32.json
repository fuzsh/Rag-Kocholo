People everywhere have been affected in challenging and long-lasting ways, and this includes the aikido community.\n\nThe USAF has been working hard to adapt to COVID-19 challenges, including hosting weekly online classes and a series of dojo-cho conversations. To further support the aikido community, the USAF continues to stay in touch regularly with its membership through phone calls, emails, social media, and Yamada Sensei's messages.\n\n​\n\nThe USAF has sadly lost members and instructors during the pandemic, and extends its deepest condolences to everyone in the aikido community who has experienced a loss during this time.\n\n​\n\n​"
