        "text": "Don Ellingsworth Sensei is a Head Instructor and Founder of Aikido Chuseikan, and holds the rank of rokudan (sixth degree black belt), as recognized by the Aikido World Headquarter (Aikikai). He has been awarded the Ueshiba Juku designation by Saotome Shihan, and is authorized to wear Saotome Sensei’s own “Ueshiba Juku” calligraphy on his professional uniforms. Literally “the Academy of the Founder”, this indicates that Saotome Sensei recognized him for his loyalty and dedication to promoting O Sensei’s vision, and that he is not only a true Deshi of Saotome Sensei and an inheritor of his teachings, but is also part of O Sensei’s own school and pure lineage as only a true Uchi Deshi of O Sensei can recognize. He and Sensei Hagen are among the youngest recipients of this honor to date.\n\nEllingsworth Sensei was previously regular instructor at the Ji On Juku Aikido Academy from 1999 to 2012. He began his training in 1989 at the University of Florida.\n\nEllingsworth Sensei has been a personal student of John Messores Shihan (7th dan) since 1993. Messores Shihan is one of Saotome Shihan’s senior-most US instructors, and among the highest ranked Americans affiliated with Aiki Hombu (the world Aikido headquarters). Messores Sensei was featured in the 1986 book Aikido and the Harmony of Nature (Shambhala Press) by Saotome Shihan, the 2002 production The Budo Experience (Budo Productions LLC), and the 2002 international Aiki Expo Demo video. Messores Shihan also has an Aikido encyclopedia listing with the Aikido Journal and the Aikido FAQ, and is the founder and senior instructor of the Ji On Juku Aikido Academy of Warrior Spirit in Largo, Florida.\n\nEllingsworth Sensei has a direct lineage from the founder of Aikido, O Sensei Morihei Ueshiba, through Mitsugi Saotome Shihan. Saotome Shihan is one of the few living direct uchi deshi (disciples) of O Sensei, and has been regarded by many as one of O Sensei’s foremost students and heirs. Ellingsworth Sensei has been recognized as a personal student of Saotome Shihan, and as Sensei’s current principle travel Otomo (travelling assistant) he has the honor of being one of Sensei’s top demonstration assistants at seminars throughout the US.\n\nEllingsworth Sensei also serves as the Administrator for the Aikido Schools of Ueshiba organization, where he is responsible for all of ASU’s membership and promotion processing.\n\nDon began his Aikido studies in 1978 at the New Haven Aikikai in New Haven, Connecticut. His early teachers were Bob Barrett, Donald Hailey, Terry Dobson, Ken Nisson and Mitsugi Saotome Shihan. Captivated early on by the depth and beauty of Aikido movement, Don’s interest continues to be to explore the many ways that Aikido practice can be personally transformative, in both the physical and inner realms. Integral to his practice is his fundamental belief that he is on the path as a student of Aikido. To this end he often travels to seminars and other opportunities to further his growth and hopefully set an example for his own students. Don has been awarded the rank of Yondan by Hiroshi Ikeda Shihan then with the Aikido Schools of Ueshiba.\n\nDon has lived and worked in the Keene-Brattleboro area since 1983. In 2001 he renovated a hundred year-old church in Brattleboro, Vermont to be his home and the location for the River Valley Aikido club. He has one daughter whose passion is dance.\n\nAnia Small is a rokudan began her Aikido training in Warsaw, Poland in 1983. Right before coming to the US in 1989, she lived in London and trained Aikido with Kanetsuka Sensei. After coming to Boston, Ania joined Shobu Aikido and studied with Gleason Sensei. In 2001 she moved to Maine to open a dojo with her husband Gary. Ania has been part of ASU and studying with Saotome Sensei since coming to US. She has been awarded Ueshiba Juku designation and serves the ASU in a variety of ways. Ania holds a Ph.D. in psychology and is interested in the role mind plays in Aikido practice. She has a private practice in Freeport Maine.\n\n“I came across Aikido class completely by accident, while returning a book to a friend. If you asked me then if I was interested in Martial Arts, I would have said no, but what I saw, completely captivated me. I loved the beauty of Aikido movement, I noticed that people were enjoying the practice and later learned that it was a non-competitive art. After participating in competitive team sports, I was looking for a physical activity I could enjoy and engage in without the focus on winning or loosing. Now, years later, I fell very lucky to have Aikido in my life. It gives me a great physical workout, including aerobic exercise, strength and core training as well as opportunity for self discovery and growth. Aikido practice continues to teach me about energy, power, conflict resolution and relationships. Studying and teaching Aikido is an integral part of my life. Through it, I met many people and build many friendships. I have also had opportunities to travel and study with amazing teachers.”\n\nGary began his martial arts and Aikido training in 1974. In 1988, he joined Shobu Aikido of Boston under the direction of William Gleason sensei. He travels to many Aikido seminars and camps to continue his training as a teacher and student of Aikido. Prior to his move to Maine, he ran a sporting goods sales and marketing company covering the six New England states. This work helped facilitate the family move to Maine and establishment of Aikido of Maine in 2000.\n\n“Having a dojo is an incredible privilege, it is a constant learning experience and a true pleasure to spend my time thinking about our practice and how we can make our dojo a better place. I am very captivated by the power of aikido in people’s lives and from a training perspective I am most interested in the connection aspect of practice and how we can put O’sensei’s teachings of creating harmony and improving the world into physical form.”\n\n”I am always excited with the many ways aikido can help people who are in need of transition and am humbled by the power of the practice to help people improve their lives”.\n\nSensei Julie “Jet” Tollen, began her Aikido training in 1999 and holds a 4th-degree black belt. She started her training as a college student in Ithaca, New York.\n\nAfter moving to Boulder, CO, to complete her schooling, Tollen Sensei discovered the incredible Boulder Aikikai and took Ikeda Sensei as her main teacher for the next five years.\n\nAfter graduating, she relocated to Kumamoto in Southern Japan, where she trained like a maniac for another five years while teaching English to both extremely shy and extremely spirited Japanese girls. While there, she passionately explored Japan’s unique language, landscape and culture.\n\nComing home led Tollen Sensei to a new adventure at a dojo outside Philadelphia, where took on positions as Dojo Cho (Head of Operations) and Chief Youth Instructor under David Goldberg Sensei (a.k.a. sword-maker extraordinaire). At that dojo, little by little, she re-constructed the program for youth based on her experiences teaching English in Japan along with observations gathered from the various Aikido instructors she met along the way.\n\nShe brought that new program to Tampa in 2013 with the opening of the Tampa Aikido Youth Program at Chuseikan Dojo. As a result, to date, hundreds of children have taken her Aikido classes over the past decade and been able to learn about the life-enhancing benefits of practicing Aikido.\n\nBut… as it has in many places, the pandemic brought changes to the Tampa Aikido Youth Program and in 2022, Tollen Sensei chose to merge the youth program in with the adult program.\n\nThese days, Tollen Sensei teaches Basic Adult Aikido classes at Chuseikan Dojo and serves as Dojo Cho. Separately, Tollen Sensei also teaches Aikido to at-risk youth in the Tampa Bay area.\n\nMarsha Turner Sensei has anchored the Chicago Aikikai as its chief instructor and dojo-cho since 2012. A long-time aficionado of aikido, she is known in particular for her strong weapons work. Turner Sensei began her study of aikido in 1986 under Kevin Choate Sensei, and Shihan Mitsugi Saotome and Shihan Hiroshi Ikeda have been very influential in her aikido development. Her extensive background in ballet, gymnastics, and traditional fencing (foil) allows her to bring elements to her current training that make her aikido unique among her peers. “Aikido caught my attention and pulled me away from fencing. I loved the rigor of fencing, but the physicality and the opportunity to throw around people bigger than me sealed the deal for aikido.” Turner Sensei received her rokudan in aikido from Shihan Mitsugi Saotome in 2017."
