He was of a Calvinist bent, this creator, and although described as indescribable, the image that distilled in my mind, not surprisingly, was that of the cultural archetype: an old white man with a long white beard, in the mold of Michelangelo’s Moses. For most of my childhood I pretty much accepted this belief without question; after all, it’s to the parents that the child looks for an explanation of things, both cosmic and practical, and as long as things go along fairly well, there’s no reason to question the explanations offered for the how and why of things. But when I was 10, the first of several personal cosmic earthquakes struck the edifice of this belief system and reverberated to cause cracks in its foundation. As goalie on the soccer team, I caught a ball in the stomach, which ruptured my appendix. My parents being away for a rare weekend of rest and relaxation, and the domestic help dismissing my complaints, it was three days before I was taken to the hospital with a nearly fatal case of peritonitis. I spent a month in the hospital, but pulled through, the physical scars of my surgeries symbolic of the deeper emotional and spiritual wounds I sustained as a result of this trauma. Feeling betrayed on some sort of cosmic level, I could not fathom why God decided to inflict this pain and suffering on me. What had I done to deserve that? Emotionally, I was unable to accept my parents’ well-intentioned but ultimately self-defeating explanations that, even if we don’t know the reason, we must believe that God did it for a reason and that God’s reason is ultimately for our own good. Not even articulate enough to voice my doubts, I swallowed them, nodded and said, “Yes, of course,” and continued on with life as usual. But the seeds of doubt and rebellion had been sown into my pre-adolescent heart and mind.\n\n15\n\nThe second cosmic earthquake to shake me at the core came five years later when my father, just 52 years old, suffered a massive stroke and died. This event once more ignited my entire being with the most urgent questions of divine will and justice. And then, during the next seven years, when my old soccer injury required a series of surgeries to remove scar tissue that was inhibiting the function of my small intestine, my personal faith in the correctness of the church and its doctrines was further diminished. From adolescence into young adulthood I lived in a vacuum of emotional and intellectual confusion. As a result, my college years in the 1960s became, essentially, a protracted personal search for meaning to put the shattered core of my psyche back together again and arrive at a worldview with some coherence. Along with the rejection of the church and its teachings, and a rejection of the conservative politics associated with church culture, the cosmic rage engendered a growing radicalization in my own politics. The social and political crises of the 1960s provided an outlet for the anger and rage generated in me by my personal health and spiritual crises. Even as the existing social and political values were being questioned and exposed as corrupt, a new world of hope and justice beckoned in the birth of the counterculture. I shared a visceral sorrow and horror at the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, and Bobby Kennedy in a span of less than five years; I was swept up in the events of the Free Speech Movement, the civil rights movement, the antiwar movement, and the women’s movement. Graduate school saw the final and fitting resolution of my deteriorating relation with the church. I had stopped attending at all by then, and out of concern for the safety of my soul, the minister and some church elders traveled to visit me in my home. They put the question to me bluntly: “Do you accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior, or not?” My response was similarly blunt: “Since I do not believe in the existence of a supernatural Father, it seems futile to discuss the existence of a supernatural Son.”\n\nI did stress that I thought of Christ as a great moral teacher, but from their point of view that was not an adequate response and they left, clearly dismayed. Two weeks later, the church bulletin announced my excommunication. Jumping ahead in order to come full circle, when people ask me these days what church I belong to or what my religion is, I tell them I belong to the Church of Creativity and I believe in the Creative Principle – a response that usually elicits a questioning look and further request to elaborate. I then explain my point of view that since in all cultures the first and greatest power universally attributed to the Divine is the power of creation, it follows that the proper realm of human religiosity is to participate and grow in the divine by developing and expressing our creative natures. I believe, in other words, that the purpose and meaning of a conscious life is simply to become an artist in every facet of it, making every act an act of creation that balances the yin and yang of things.\n\nAdult World Views Through my explorations in the mid-1960s, the religious codes and values of my youth, and even its explanation of the nature of reality, came to seem utterly inadequate. My belief in the Creator God was replaced by the belief in the Creative Principle; belief in religious doctrine was replaced by belief in the evidence of science and belief in the supernatural was replaced by belief in rationality. And my new understanding of reality and its underpinnings was corroborated by my graduate studies in linguistics. Here I began to find a new insight into the structure of the universe. I became enthralled with the beauty and elegance of the binary oppositional principle as the underlying, universal structural mechanism of language. Thinking that the structure of language must reflect and express the structure of reality with a capital R, I began looking into other disciplines where research results corroborated the notion that the binary oppositional principle was the fundamental organizing principle of natural experience, and of nature itself: Piaget in psychology and Levi-Strauss in anthropology were developing fascinating theories of learning and kinship utilizing the binary principle as the\n\n3\n\norganizing structural constant. Likewise, the formalization of the binary principle in mathematics and its application in the technology of computer science in the following decades proved further corroboration of the fundamental nature of the polarity principle. In fields as diverse as psychology and physics, the principle of the “unity of opposites” was slowly gathering momentum as perhaps the greatest explanatory principle in the history of science. The psychologist Carl Jung employed with great success the polarity paradigm to explain the profound dynamics between the sexes. Jung paid explicit homage to Daoist yin-yang teachings on the interpenetration of opposites for his anima-animus theory on the structure of the human psyche. As in psychology, so too in physics. As research into the furthest reaches of the material world and the structure of the atom deepened, it led the great twentieth century Danish physicist Niels Bohr to rediscover the ancient Daoist concept of polarity as the basic structure and creative principle of the universe and reality. Symbolic of this conceptual convergence of eastern and western modes of knowledge, when Bohr was knighted in 1947, he chose as his coat of arms the ancient Chinese yin-yang symbol and the inscription: “Contraria sunt Complementa” — Opposites are Complimentary (Fig. 1).1\n\n... My own introduction to Daoist thought and its philosophy of polarity occurred as a result of my taking up the practice of the Chinese internal martial arts in the mid-1970s to deal with recurring migraines. This proved a serendipitous decision in many ways.\n\n1\n\n4\n\nFritjof Capra, “The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels Between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism,” Shambhala, Boulder, CO, 1975, p. 160.\n\nAs I started reading the Daoist classics, I was moved by the discovery that these ancients had already thought deeply about polarity, and had in fact formulated an entire philosophy and way of life based on yin-yang polarity as the fundamental operating principle of the universe. In the famous circular yin-yang symbol, there’s a white dot in the black and a black dot in the white (Fig. 2). In this small detail is the essence of the philosophy: all things contain the seed of their own opposite, and the mutual interpenetration of opposites drives change through time. I began to recognize manifestations of this foundational idea in my study and practice of the internal martial arts. Soft could be more powerful than hard. Stillness could control movement. To someone of my background, these and other apparent contradictions posed by Daoism and the practice of the internal martial arts seemed deeply paradoxical. And while I found these paradoxes provocative, I also found it difficult to accept the claim that the slow and graceful movements of taijiquan (太極拳) were actually a powerful martial art. This skepticism turned into outright incredulity when I was introduced to the practice of standing meditation. How could simply standing still result in deadly powers and extraordinary martial skills, as was claimed? This phenomenon cried out for the spotlight of scrutiny, either to debunk it as fraud or come to an understanding how these claims could be true.\n\nMeeting my Future Teacher As I was growing up in the 1950s and struggling to find my way in the ‘60s and ‘70s, a continent away, the man who would eventually answer all these questions for me in the most definitive way possible and become the most influential of my future teachers, embarked on his own journey that would eventually lead towards a point of intersection with mine. Master Sam Tam was born Tam Maan Yin (譚曼彥) in mainland China in 1940. There is no doubt in my mind that in the realm of martial arts, Master Tam fulfills all of the requirements of an “outlier” as described by Malcolm Gladwell in his\n\n5\n\nbook “Outliers.”2 Outliers, for Gladwell, are “people whose achievements fall outside normal experience.” Their skills are so exceptional that it makes them fall outside of the bell curve of their profession. Tracing the rise and development of a diversity of greats in various fields, including Bill Gates, The Beatles, and a host of others, Gladwell comes to the conclusion that (1) innate predisposition or talent (2) combines with opportunity, as in a strongly supportive social environment, (3) to push a passionate temperament into an all consuming behavior. Certainly all these factors can be readily observed in Master Tam’s unique achievements in the martial arts generally, and in the internal martial arts particularly. The family history attests to his innate genetic endowment. Throughout the generations his family specialized in martial arts or medicine, and sometimes both. As his personality took shape, the emergence of the character traits necessary for outstanding achievement reinforced the genetic predisposition. Precocious as a child, Master Tam’s character grew into a unique combination of intelligence, passion, perseverance, and competitiveness. Simply put, from an early age, Master Tam was determined to be the best at most everything. Master Tam developed interest in martial arts very young. Lady Luck smiled on him, and opportunity came his way. In the late 1940s and in the early 50s his father, because of his occupation as a doctor in the Chinese armed forces, was able to arrange instruction for his son from high level military martial art instructors. Besides his native talent and fearless spirit, one trait that endeared Master Tam to his teachers was the great respect and deference Master Tam showed them. Because of this, and because they recognized his unique talents, each teacher pointed him to the next teacher he should seek out. In the process he acquired a truly encyclopedic knowledge, both theoretical and practical, in the Chinese martial arts. Even to this day, I do not have the full picture of whom he studied with, or what and when, but amongst the most important in his career were certainly the following: Lau Fat Mang (劉法孟) (Eagle Claw), Han Xingyuan (韓星垣) (Yiquan, Xingyiquan, Baguazhang), Yu Pengxi (尤彭熈), (Yiquan),\n\n2\n\n6\n\nMalcolm Gladwell, “Outliers”, Little, Brown and Company, New York, 2008.\n\nChang Dongshen (常東昇) (Shuaijiao), Zhang Xiang Wu (Taijiquan, Xingyiquan, Baguazhang) and Qi Jiangtao (綦江濤) (Taijiquan). In the mid-1950s, a new chapter started in Master Tam’s life, as the family emigrated to Canada. After a few years in Toronto, he married and moved to Vancouver B.C. where he raised his family. In the 60s he started to come down to the San Francisco Bay Area on a regular basis to visit friends and relatives. In the San Francisco martial arts community, Master Tam’s reputation spread quickly (Fig. 3). Among his peers, he was respected for the breath and depth of his martial knowledge, and feared as a ferocious fighter who could enjoy instilling terror in his opponents.\n\n... It was during the 1970s that my own path intersected with Master Tam’s for the first time. During that time I was studying in Berkeley with Fong Ha, Master Tam’s friend and shidi (師弟), or younger brother in martial arts, especially yiquan. As a consequence, Master Tam would periodically come down from Vancouver and visit. It was during these visits that I made his acquaintance and began to come to know him. To tell the truth, on first meeting Master Tam, I didn’t like him all that much. I was turned off by the stories of martial prowess that were told about him. And his demeanor seemed to me to corroborate this reputation. Though he was unfailingly polite and correct, his bearing expressed a confidence in his martial abilities that at times seemed to border on intimidation. Whether with friends or foes, he never left any doubt that, if provoked, he could do serious damage in a very short time.\n\n7\n\nWhy the negative reaction on my part? I was on the rebound from the turbulence of the cultural and political revolutions of the 1960s and 1970s, and in true hippie fashion, all I wanted to do was meditate, practice taiji (太極), and seek the peaceful life. Sam Tam’s reputation did not square with those goals, and so I tended to dismiss him as irrelevant to my own path. It didn’t help that, in a number of ways, Sam seemed very dismissive of those of us who studied with Master Fong. For one thing, he was always being picked up and whisked away by other very serious martial arts types for important and secretive consultations, to which we lowly white ghosts were not invited. At other times he would emerge from Master Fong’s house, and, without coming over or saying a word, he would just watch us practice our routines in the park across the street, and then turn around and walk back into the house. Of course there was so much back then that I didn’t see, or didn’t understand. Only decades later did he tell me that he turned away because he couldn’t bear watching how badly we were mangling the forms. From the early 1980s till the late 1990s I had very little contact with Master Tam. He stopped coming down from Vancouver to visit martial arts friends and groups in the Bay Area. The reason, he explained later, was that at that point he had begun to realize that in order to master the taiji principle and the philosophy of yielding, he would have to give up all his old ways of using strength. Embarking on the quest for mastery of yielding and the method of expressing power without force, he entered, along with a few trusted friends, a period of ever deepening personal search and research into the relationship between meditation and martial arts.\n\nSigning on to No-Force Then, in 1996, a friend phoned to tell me that Sam Tam was in town again and that we were invited to an informal get together. Of course I decided to go, but to be honest, my continuing negative feelings towards him coupled with a deep loyalty to my teacher at the time, Master Cai Songfang (蔡松芳), left me with deep skepticism and disbelief about the descriptions of Sam Tam’s new-found abilities that had filtered down through the gossip pipelines.\n\n8\n\nThat night, as Master Tam demonstrated “no force”3 and moved people around at will with apparent effortlessness, I couldn’t help but be impressed. When it came my turn, I was determined to put up a struggle. But when I tried, I could not. While his hands were touching me, I experienced no push; I did not feel that I had been moved, and yet I had moved! It was only a couple of inches, but the experience left me profoundly puzzled. The next year, along with some comrades, I went to visit him in Vancouver. It was a most memorable meeting. In theoretical and practical terms, he discussed and demonstrated his newfound skills of yielding and softness. It was one of the most concise lecture demonstrations of the internal martial arts and its principles that I have ever seen and heard. Just as striking, these newfound skills of yielding and softness seemed inextricably connected with a shift in personal outlook and attitude. Clearly, the taiji principle and philosophy had transformed him. He was less imposing and threatening, more friendly and engaging, and this allowed his impish sense of humor to guide his words and actions. As my friends and I experienced that evening, and as countless others have experienced since, Master Tam’s humor is an extension of his commitment to softness—and it is an excellent teaching tool. With easy confidence and a promise not to use force, he invited us to try to defeat him. The result? An evening of hilarity, with so much laughter that we were weak in the knees. No matter what we tried, each of us wound up doing one of three things: (1) losing balance and falling; (2) being immobilized to the point of paralysis; or (3) bouncing like a ball thrown against the wall. And through it all, Master Tam did not exhibit the slightest use of force or even a trace of physical effort. Over the next few years in the late 90s, as I had more frequent occasion to observe and experience Master Tam both in workshops and in private interaction, I was forced to revise my previous feelings about him. I found myself in a quandary. Master Cai had returned to China, and it was unlikely that he would come back to California or that I would be able to visit him often in China.\n\n3\n\n“No Force” here is not synonomous with “no touch”; Master Tam was touching us, but not using force to move us.\n\n9\n\nAnd then, I came to an important realization: when pushing hands with Master Cai and Master Tam, either could render me helpless. But there was a difference in the feeling of their hands. When Master Cai bounced me, I could feel force in his hands; when Master Tam bounced me, I felt no force at all. I did feel something, and that something seemed mysterious, elusive, even otherworldly. I wanted it. Reluctantly then, I did the obvious thing. Putting aside my ego and previous negative sentiments, I asked Master Tam to accept me as his student - which he did, lightly, and with an easy smile. Then and there he used the internal martial arts to turn me from an enemy into a friend, a skeptic into a believer, a challenger into a student. By now I’ve known Master Tam for over 30 years, and have been working closely with him as his student for over 15 years. During this latter period, as he became more and more well-known globally, he began drawing into his orbit a large number of accomplished martial artists from around the world who wanted to learn his signature softness. Thus I’ve been privileged to observe the transformation in Master Tam from a shifu (師父), meaning teacher, into a dashi (大師), meaning “big teacher” or the teacher of teachers. Personally, as Master Tam’s student for so many years, my exposure to his sensitivity and skill has been instrumental in realizing my own potential in the internal martial arts. Without his peerless instruction and his unyielding insistence on doing things the right way, I could never have realized the vision I had when I started my internal martial arts journey more than 35 years ago as of this writing: simply to rise to a level of mastery in the art that would bring me a sense of completion, fulfillment and happiness in my older years. I have that sense now. I have found and tasted the well-spring of life and it was—and is—in me. I have tasted the nectar of qi, and have begun to feel the power of the soft and yielding. This raises the question of where to find the words to describe the experience and how to draw the map to the territory? Master Tam always emphasizes that the internal martial arts represents a special case of embodiment of the yin-yang principle. And indeed his teachings have reinforced in me a keen personal appreciation that polarity (Dao (道)=yin (陰)/yang (陽)) is the principle that underlies the unfolding of life itself.\n\n10\n\nAccordingly, it seemed only proper to make the polarity principle the underlying scaffolding for the structure of the experiences, observations, analyses and syntheses that have become this volume. Additionally, for my entire life I have been a voracious reader, so even before I met Master Tam, and long before I became his student, it was my nature to complement my internal martial arts experience by research into anatomy, physiology, psychology, kinesiology and neuroscience. This life-long habit of questing figures prominently in this volume and has made its methodology at once subjective and objective, phenomenological and empirical, participatory and observational. My search and research since I began this quest in 1976 has ranged widely over western and eastern knowledge; the result is a synthesis that I hope offers clear, though perhaps sometimes unconventional, perspectives on the interactions of stillness and movement, body and mind.\n\n11\n\nOverview: The Four Stages of Development\n\nD\n\n4\n\nThe Qi Stage\n\nuring the qi (氣) stage, internal martial artists work to realize the potential of their genetic endowment by developing their physical constitution. The primary principles internal martial artists follow to cultivate robust health in the qi state are proper posture, proper breath and proper mindset. In the internal martial arts, the rules of posture are governed by the pivotal concept of zhongding (中定), or central equilibrium, and consist of the optimal re-alignment of the spine in the vertical plane. Within this proper postural framework, internal martial artists utilize mindful breathing practices to transform typical (and usually restricted) breathing patterns into full and free natural breathing. As this process unfolds over time, the tensions that stiffen and harden us, both physically and mentally, progressively dissolve. The resulting state of relaxation is called song (鬆) by the Chinese, and denotes a state of alert relaxation that is ready for immediate action. Proper breath and proper posture create the foundation for optimally efficient movement of torso and limbs. The rules for movement, like posture, also are dictated by the constraints of central equilibrium. The fundamental components, or basic grammar, of movement are the horizontal, vertical and rotational movements of the body’s central vertical axis in space. These three elemental movements combine to create an infinite number of possible movements. In the qi stage, internal martial artists learn to nurture a state of glowing health in which deep and easy breathing, optimal balance, fluid movement and li (力), meaning basic strength, become the building blocks for the development of jin (勁), or power.\n\n4\n\n12\n\nThe inspiration and basis for this overview was a lecture on “Qi and Qi Gong” given by Master SamTam in 2007 during a summer retreat in Santa Barbara, CA.\n\nThe Jin Stage Through further specialized qigong training, practitioners can refine and distill the li, the basic physical strength derived from qigong practice, into the martial skills of jin, a refined type of martial power, sometimes also called fajin. Li is the sort of strength used in pushing a stalled car. It is linear and uses the force of momentum. Jin, as we will see, is a special kind of non-linear power discharged from the body’s abdominal center, called the dantian (丹田) in Chinese. Most martial arts apply force by leaning the body and/or exerting the segmented strength of the appendages. The metaphor is the reality: an attack is “launched,” a punch is “thrown,” a kick is “extended.” Because their power derives from momentum and is therefore external to the organism, these martial arts are properly called external martial arts. Jin, as the refinement of li, is based on the principle of central equilibrium. Maintaining central equilibrium at all times, along with utterly controlled economy of movement, allows the dantian to become functional as the focus for cultivation and storage of the qi. When issued, this qi becomes jin, the explosive expression of the integrated strength of the body. Jin has enormous power but paradoxically it has no momentum. Its expression is explosively spherical, equal in all directions. The internal martial art of Yiquan teaches us that the training that accomplishes this spherical explosiveness is called “six directions training.” It is first practiced separately in each dimension — up-down, front-back, and left-right — but eventually entails the simultaneous expansion from the center in all six directions. Thus jin, or fajin as it is also called, can be thought of as a pulse of energy and force generated at the body’s center that may be discharged from any point on the body’s periphery. I will describe how the essential method used by internal martial artists to train both center and periphery in developing the skill of fajin is the ever-deepening exploration of breathing practices.\n\n13\n\nThe diaphragm is key. It acts as a central piston in the generation of both qi and jin. The diaphragm connects with and engages with the lungs above it to create qi; in connecting with and engaging the abdominal cavity, it begins to generate jin. Internal martial artists aim to acquire conscious control over diaphragmatic action by means of “reverse” breathing techniques. Fundamental in this process is learning how to control the contraction of the diaphragm to regulate the internal hydraulic pressure in the abdominal cavity. With time and effective practice, the dantian — located roughly 1.5 inches below the navel and 1.5 inches into the belly — is transformed into a “dome of power.” It becomes sensitive, subtly responsive, at one instant soft and pliable, and in the next hard as steel.\n\nThe Yi Stage Yi (意) is generally translated as intent, or even more broadly speaking, imagination or consciousness. The yi, in other words, is our executive agency, the decision-maker in us that resides in the frontal lobes of the brain. It is the yi that considers the possible voluntary movements and decides which to allow and which to put on hold. It is also the yi that instructs our musculature as to the when and how to proceed with the execution of an allowed activity. Within the internal martial arts context, the training and development of central equilibrium, breathing skills and jin, are all functions of the yi. But the stage of yi for internal martial artists is more narrowly defined by two criteria, a practitioner’s ability to (1) generate the jin power internally, through mental intent and without external movement, and (2) discharge it (in)to the opponent from any point on the body that is in contact with the opponent. But yet, translating yi as intention captures only half of its meaning. Underlying all voluntary motor decisions and actions is a perceptual substrate; that is, actions and movements are based on perceptions of the external environment.\n\n14\n\nAnd it is precisely in the frontal lobes of the brain, where the yi resides, that the integration of the sensory and motor components of the nervous system takes place and results in voluntary action. The yi, then, is the neurological interface between the sensory and the motor components of the nervous system. Like the head and tail sides of a coin, the yi is a polarity structure where attention and perceptual awareness is the yin to the yang of intention and motor activity. Solitary standing meditation and taijiquan practice are effective in training this perceptual awareness; they build balance and proprioception (internal perception of the relationships between bones, muscles, and connective tissue), vision and hearing. Moreover, martial arts are a contact sport, and the “soft” internal styles emphasize tactile sensitivity over force. The tactile sense is broadened and deepened by means of the practice of partnered exercises, such as “pushing hands” patterns and techniques. Through pushing hands practice, internal martial artists develop the sensory skills of ting（聽) or listening, zou (走) or yielding, and zhan-nian (粘 黏) or adhering -sticking, which altogether result in a lighter, subtler touch. Coupled with song (relaxation), zhongding (stability) and integration acquired through solitary standing meditation and form practice, this greater tactile awareness allows us, on the one hand, to develop the ability to hijack an opponent’s central equilibrium, while on the other, to prevent the opponent from doing it to us. These pushing-hand skills derive their power from their ability to transform intention into attention and force into no force; they take internal martial artists beyond the power of jin and yi to the sensitivity and responsiveness of shen.\n\n15\n\nThe Shen Stage Just as the yi can be understood as a polarity structure of intention (yang) and attention (yin), attention itself is also a polarity structure: perceptual attention is always somewhere along a spectrum of hard focus (yang) to soft focus (yin). The yi utilizes the hard-focused attention to execute its intent, and guide our motor movement. By definition, hard-focused attention is detail-oriented and partial. It is the soft-focus perception, however, that is the foundational basis for the development of shen (神), the ultimate level of attainment in the internal martial arts, usually simply translated as “spirit” or more descriptively, as the “spirit of awareness” or the “spirit of enlightenment.” As the ultimate level of comprehensive holistic sensory awareness, one cultivates Shen through the systematic relaxation training of both the internal senses of balance and proprioception and the external senses of touch, vision and hearing. As the senses learn to relax, the more they soften their focus, the more they expand the range of their perception. This is true for each sense individually, but also for all the senses collectively. Shen is the combined information/data from all the expanded senses together that is integrated into the one, overall, simultaneous perception of our surrounding environment. The internal martial arts path and its stages are part and parcel of the broader and deeper current of Chinese culture and consciousness that is Daoism. The Daoist prescription for appropriate action in the world, that is, how to get to the shen level, is the path of wuwei (無為). Literally meaning “not doing,” wuwei is perhaps more fully described as the way to mastery of any skill by “minimizing effort through maximizing awareness.”\n\n16\n\nThroughout the ages, Pao Ding, the lowly kitchen worker described by Zhuangzi, frequently is cited as a paragon of enlightenment, representing the embodiment and pinnacle of this philosophy.5 Pao Ding, through decades of practice, developed the ability to dress a carcass without ever dulling his knife. When his Lord the Duke queried him about this extraordinary skill, Pao Ding explained to him: “What I care about is the Way, which goes beyond skill. When I first began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the ox itself. After three years, I no longer saw the whole ox. And now — now I go at it by spirit and don’t look with my eyes. Perception and understanding have come to a stop and spirit [shen] moves where it wants.” Pao Ding’s description shows the way of wuwei and shen for any artist: from the initial use of brute force informed by limited perception one progresses to using refined force guided by precise focus (yi) until finally one becomes capable of using the no-force of encompassing awareness (shen). Whether it’s carving up carcasses, playing a musical instrument, or controlling an opponent, at the highest stage of shen the tools become an extension of the body; one feels and senses with them to achieve flow with, rather than intervention in, the surrounding world. Achievement in the internal martial arts is ultimately measured by how close martial artists come to the ideal of “awareness overcoming strength.” The journey of developing these sensory skills is a deeply transformative process. It involves, in every aspect of life, the overcoming and restructuring of deeply seated and practically hard-wired patterns of using force in reaction to threat and challenge. Over time, the sensory perceptual skills and their associated motor skills take root as the new operating system that runs our bodies and minds. Then, gradually, a shift in perspective and character occurs, guiding us away from egocentrism and competitiveness into a state of open-mindedness and tranquility.\n\n5\n\nThere are many versions of this story. In this work, I will cite the version told and interpreted by Kuang-Ming Wu in “The Butterfly as Companion: Meditations on the First Three Chapters of the Chuang Tzu,” State University of New York Press, New York,1990.\n\n17\n\nBook 1\n\nThe Mindful Body Somatic Functions Controlled by Mental Faculties\n\n18\n\nT\n\nIntroduction to Book 1\n\nThe Anatomy of Posture and Movement\n\nhe martial arts, of course, have always had an abiding interest in movement, both in how it is generated and how it is controlled. Historically, many martial arts styles were created based on characteristic movements of a variety of animals, such as tiger, bear, crane, snake, etc. Master Wang Xiangzhai (王薌齋), the founder of the internal martial art style of standing meditation presented in this work, criticized such efforts to create martial arts styles based on animal behaviors. He instead sought to develop a martial art that exploits the specific human characteristics of our upright posture and bipedal gait by turning the vulnerability into the very foundation and strength of the underlying concepts of posture and movement.\n\nIn living organisms mobility requires stability. Hence evolution has favored the stable quadruped solution adopted by most mammals. Certainly the quadruped posture and means of locomotion is more stable than the bipedal posture and gait primates adopted when they came down from the trees and starting living life on the savanna. For primates, then, adopting bipedal posture and movement must have offered both immediate and long-term, lasting advantages. The adaptation to bipedal movement occurred 4-6 million years ago in an east African landscape that was getting dryer and dryer. With forests giving way to grasslands, what benefits did the permanent upright posture offer? Initially, for the early grassland hominid, being upright was not about walking, but rather about posture when foraging. The height inherent in an upright posture allowed our ancestors to see over tall grass and to identify and intimidate predators and other hominids. Likewise, with the hands freed, they gained better ability to climb vertical tree trunks and to reach and pull down the low-hanging, fruit-laden branches.\n\n19\n\nFreed hands were also indispensable for carrying food, offspring and tools when our ancestors were on the move. And move they did. They ran for a living, running game down by following until it tired out, sometimes days later. Their upright posture helped reduce heat stress by limiting the body surface area exposed to the savannah’s intense tropical sun and heat. Further adaptations, including hairlessness, sweat glands, and other physical features helped our ancestors become capable of running long distances in the open sun near the equator. The adaptation process to erect walking, visualized so stunningly by Rudolph Zalinger in his “March of Progress”6 sequence (Fig. 4), changed the skeletal structure profoundly. On top, for the skull to balance on the spinal column, the foramen magnum (the hole in the skull through which the spinal cord attaches to the brain) had to shift position and become centered at the bottom of the skull. In the middle, an S-curve developed in the spine to support the weight of the upper body in a flexible manner. And at bottom, the pelvic structure’s conjunction of thigh bones and hip sockets evolved to carry the stress and weight associated with bipedal locomotion. This process reached a culmination of sorts when the primate line that ultimately led to the human form began to diverge from the apes. Evolution of permanent bipedal posture and locomotion not only freed the hands, but in combination with the evolution of the opposable thumb, set the evolutionary stage for the simultaneous development of toolmaking and language. These developments culminated in the explosive growth of the cerebral cortex in the pleistocene era about half a million years ago.\n\n6\n\n20\n\nWikipedia, Rudolph Zalinger, “March of Progress.”\n\nAt the same time, evolution towards permanent bipedal posture and locomotion placed increasingly enormous demands on those parts of the central nervous system involved with balance. As a result, the cerebellum, the organ most concerned with balance and proprioception, also underwent explosive growth and development to meet the neural demand for processing power. Thus the primate nervous system evolved: from lesser to greater ability to perceive the environment; from lesser to greater ability to learn from that experience; from lesser to greater ability to respond to and move around in the environment; and ultimately, from lesser to greater control over the environment. For the internal martial artist, standing meditation becomes no less than the conscious practice of this evolutionary impulse. Standing meditation practice brings the mostly unconscious functions of the cerebellum, namely bipedal balance and proprioception, to awareness in the frontal lobes of the neocortex. By cultivating greater awareness of the internal environment, that is, the perception of the wholebody self around its central equilibrium, the internal martial artist gains a twofold advantage over any opponent. Not only does this awareness enhance her own postural stability and movement agility, but it also allows her to understand, and exploit the weaknesses in her opponent’s posture and movements.\n\n...\n\nBone, muscle and connective tissue combine into a structure that maintains our posture and creates our movement. In the human body, the bones function as rigid compression members, while the muscles and connective tissue are the flexible tensional members that act upon the bones to maintain posture and create movement. Our bones are joined in many different ways, but what all joints have in common is their function as mechanical fulcrums that allow the bones to act as levers upon each other. In the lever principle, a force is applied to a weight via a pivot point or fulcrum. In the body, bones are the levers, joints are the fulcrums or pivot points, and force is supplied by the muscles and mediated by the connective tissue.\n\n21\n\nBecause of the nature of our joints, most human movement has to do with the extension and flexion of both the trunk and the extremities. To maintain posture and create movement within this context, the muscles must work in pairs that are functionally antithetical and complimentary to each other, so that when one contracts, the other relaxes and is stretched. Examples are the hamstrings and quadriceps that act as extensors and flexors of the legs, or the triceps and biceps which act as extensors and flexors of the arms. When you contract the biceps, the triceps rests and the arm flexes. When you contract the triceps, the biceps rests and the arm extends. Generally, the muscle that causes a movement to occur by contracting is referred to as the agonist, while the resting muscle is called the antagonist. Thus depending on which initiates the movement, both extensors and flexors can be either agonist or antagonist. The 206 separate bones of our body are each part of a whole and act in their totality as one skeleton. By the same logic the more than 600 muscles that act upon the bones to maintain posture and produce movement also can be considered as each being a part of a whole. In their totality, these 600 muscles can be seen to act as one muscle, or rather two opposing muscles that constitute a yin-yang pair. Several facts argue in favor of such an interpretation. First, it takes an incredible amount of muscle synergy to maintain posture and movement. Even a simple movement engages most of the body’s muscles, allowing an infinite number of possible simultaneous and/or sequential muscle contractions. Moreover, a single muscle may contract or lengthen any number of its fibers individually or collectively in order to change its configuration and shape in an almost amoeba-like fashion. These and related facts have led modern scholars such as Deane Juhan to conclude that “... the body [has] only one muscle … that can contract or extend any number of its millions of fibers and utilize all of its bony levers and tendon attachments to achieve an infinite variation of shapes ... there is only one muscle, controlled by one mind.”7 As with bones and muscles, so it is with connective tissue. We have innumerable types of connective tissues that in their totality constitute the one connective tissue.\n\n7\n\n22\n\nDeane Juhan, “Job’s Body: A Handbook for Bodywork,” Station Hill Press, Barrytown, New York,1987, pp. 113-15.\n\nEach muscle, each visceral organ, all blood and lymph vessels and nerves are encased in specialized connective tissue wrapping, also called fascia. All are connected by and into a ubiquitous web that supports, enwraps, and separates all the functional units of the body. For this reason, modern scholars increasingly consider the numerous types of specialized connective tissues collectively as the one “organ of form” or the “organ of structure” because functionally, connective tissue supports and maintains the relative positions of the various organs and muscles and skeletal structures in the body. While in posture and movement the muscles provide the active force that acts on the rigid bones, the connective tissue is the underlying and all-encompassing passive matrix that contains and supports both the bones and the muscles. In other words, the structural integrity of the body as a whole depends on the balance of the various connective tissues (tendons, ligaments, strings, cords and fascial sheets) that hold the bones, muscles and organs in relationship to each other. It’s important to realize how connective tissue and muscles have opposing but complimentary functions in the maintenance of posture and creating movement. Muscle strength is active and contractile in nature, while connective tissue strength is passive and elastic in nature. The muscles adjust the tension levels in the tendons and fascia necessary to maintain posture and produce movement. The crucial point here is that as muscle stretches the tendons, fascia and other components of the connective tissue web, the web, due to its elastic nature, stores energy that is used to partially power subsequent actions. To understand better how this works, consider the kangaroo’s bipedal hopping method of locomotion. The kangaroo (Fig. 5) has developed tremendously powerful elastic tendons in its legs. These tendons are so efficient in absorbing and storing energy that up to 80% of the energy generated by gravity each time the kangaroo lands is used to power the next jump. This means that the faster and higher and further the kangaroo jumps, its energy consumption actually increases in efficiency. In other words, relatively speaking, at higher speeds, it needs to use less muscle energy to cover long distances. 23\n\nThe relevance of all this to the internal martial arts is defined by the methodology these arts employ to make the unconscious conscious. The reality is that the one skeleton, the one muscle and the one connective tissue together constitute one body that is controlled by one nervous system. But this nervous system has two parts, conscious and subconscious. In fact, most of our daily interactions with people are governed by subconscious processes; we simply are unaware of them and our responses to provocations are limited by this lack of awareness. Standing meditation is the antidote for this lack of awareness. It makes the conscious pursuit of unified body and mind central to internal martial arts strategy, tactics and practices. Consequently, the relationship between stillness (standing meditation) and movement is of paramount importance for the internal martial artist. Understanding this relationship thoroughly will optimize both offensive and defensive strategies, their tactical implementation, and the training programs based on them. A lack of understanding will lead to deficient offensive and defensive strategies, erroneous tactical implementation, and inadequate training programs. Though posture is often thought of as stillness as opposed to movement, actually our posture must be considered a type of movement also. In other words, the stillness we are talking about is not the stillness of death as opposed to the movement of life. It is not the comparative stillness of plants as opposed to the movements of animals. It is not the (relative) stillness of sleep, not the stillness of couch potato TVwatching, not the stillness of paralysis, not the stillness of passed out stupor, nor any other stillness in which the machinery for movement and its controlling mechanism have been fully or partially shut down. No, the stillness we cultivate in our standing (postural) meditation entails readiness, a stillness that is pregnant with possibilities for movement. It is the stillness of the deer ready to bolt and flee, the stillness of the tiger ready to pounce. The stillness we are talking about, in other words, is movement not yet released. It is the stillness of potential movement as opposed to actual movement. In this stillness, awareness enables us to respond to our environment rather than react to it.\n\n24\n\nIn the external martial arts, as well as most western sports, the training emphasis is on building muscle strength. In the internal martial arts, however, we emphasize cultivating the elastic strength of the connective tissue web and utilize muscle effort to that end. We cultivate the elastic nature of our body frame in order to be able to absorb our opponent’s energy and repel her effortlessly. Here the energy stored by the tendons and connective tissue web is not that of gravity and falling, but is the opponent’s own energy. When our connective tissue web is stretched elastically (by the opponent’s force), its recoil bounces the opponent back, much like a trampoline. Considering that compared with the kangaroo, human tendon energy storage capacity is a paltry 15-20 percent, we would do well to learn how to use our muscles intelligently to stretch, lengthen and strengthen the energy storage capacity (elasticity) of the fascial web that literally holds us together.\n\n25\n\nPart 1\n\nOn Q i\n\nCultivating Health\n\n26\n\nH\n\nChapter 1: Standing Meditation\n\nThe Origin and Purpose of Standing Meditation\n\nistorically, most martial arts have delivered force through movement. On the most basic and common level, it is the momentum of movement that generates the power in the martial arts; we fight by throwing a punch or launching a kick. Because this type of force is not generated in or by the internal center, the martial arts that use these methods came to be called external martial arts. Chinese warrior-sages discovered two great drawbacks to this method of delivering force. First, if the movement misses the intended target, the momentum causes the fighter to overextend and lose balance, putting her in a dangerous situation. Second, the force derived from momentum is partial. While the force of a fist in a punch or of the foot in a kick can be powerful indeed, neither is as great as the force generated by the body acting as a whole unit. Through analysis and experimentation, these ancients solved both problems by discovering how to generate force from stillness. In this highly sophisticated method, a pulse of power is generated in stillness from the center of the body and discharged into the opponent at the point of contact. Because it radiates out spherically from a center, this force (1) has no momentum and (2) is holistic, not partial. Not only is the force more powerful but it also reduces or eliminates the risk that a fighter will lose balance. These ideas evolved in a few martial arts systems, such as xingyiquan (形意拳) and taijiquan that collectively became known as the neijia quan, or the family of the internal martial arts. Historically, then, a large part of the curriculum of internal martial arts systems entailed practicing stillness while holding many different postures, each one functionally designed for a different purpose or situation.\n\n27\n\nThe late nineteenth and early twentieth century era was a time of great social and political upheaval in China, and fed a great renaissance in the martial arts. A myriad of martial arts styles and systems flourished as a way to protect the nation and strengthen the character and resolve of the people. From this renaissance emerged the genius of Master Wang Xiangzhai (王薌齋) (Fig. 6) who lived from 1885 until 1963 and synthesized all these different systems of postural practices into one universal meditation posture. His method of zhanzhuang standing meditation must be acknowledged as the ultimate refinement and culmination of the Chinese martial arts. When the communists came to power in China in the midtwentieth century, a decision was made on a national level to emphasize the health aspects of martial arts and de-emphasize their martial and spiritual aspects, transforming them into more athletic health arts and acrobatic performance arts. The latter part of the twentieth century also saw the increasing exportation of the martial arts from China, introducing and popularizing them all over the world. Figur e E rr o r!\n\nN o tex t o f spe c ifi e d st y le in\n\nThe effect of this diffusion of internal martial arts development in the modern era, both in China and worldwide, has been largely negative. The postural practices of the internal martial arts have deteriorated and the concept of internal power has become the stuff of legend rather than of cultivation. Increasingly practiced solely as a means of health maintenance rather than for martial skills, the internal martial arts have all but abandoned postural practices in favor of movement practice. In the process, they have largely lost their essence, their soul, and instead have come to look like watered-down dance versions of the external martial arts.\n\n28\n\nYet despite these developments, the real internal martial arts have not been lost altogether. Pockets of knowledge and cultivation of the old skills of internal power continue to exist and some adherents continue to spread the true art. It has been my incredibly good fortune to connect with a few teachers who were still familiar with the old ways.\n\nMy Introduction to Standing Meditation My own introduction to standing meditation was a rough one. My teacher, Master Fong Ha, had brought his teacher, Master Han Xingyuan (Fig. 7), from Hong Kong to the San Francisco Bay Area to conduct a course. Master Han was a teacher of the old school who applied the “sink or swim” principle to his teaching methods. His standing meditation classes were strenuous, to say the least. Students stood, with their arms held in a circle in front of the chest, for a minimum of 45 minutes that often stretched to over an hour. Students sometimes were sweating so profusely that the ground around their feet actually became wet. Rumor had it that Master Han did not dismiss class until a sufficient number of sweat puddles had accumulated. At times legs would get so tired that the students would begin shaking uncontrollably. Or their arms would become so heavy that the students could not hold them up any longer and inadvertently lowered them — only to have Master Han walk over and raise those arms back to the more tortuous position. But worse than the physical strain was the intellectual-emotional anguish of following the credo of “do as you’re shown and don’t ask any questions.” For many of the more highly educated and concept-driven students, including myself, doing things without really understanding why was the worst kind of torture. Whether this is the ideal method for transmitting the wonders of standing meditation is debatable. Certainly it was a reflection of a different culture and time.\n\n29\n\nHistorically, the traditional Chinese manner of transmitting the martial arts through the generations often subjected students to rigorous endurance trials designed to test their desire and loyalty. It definitely served as an effective filtering mechanism to separate out those without sufficient endurance. Hearing of Master Han’s fame and reputation, many came and tried while he was in the San Francisco Bay Area. I was one of the few who stayed – both because I realized it was a testing situation and I could be as stubborn as the next person, and because of the support of fellow students. From my own teaching experience, I’ve come to a different conclusion about the best way to guide a student’s progress forward. I believe it is through a series of small steps that incrementally push the student to higher levels of achievement. Furthermore, in my experience, students progress faster when they are given a conceptual framework that defines the goals of the postural practice, and describes the feelings and sensations they are likely to encounter in the process. And although he did not follow this practice when teaching our group, in the final analysis, it appears Master Han also subscribed to this point of view. Once, when he was asked how long one should stand, he answered, “It’s better to stand correctly for one minute than to stand incorrectly for one hour.”\n\nStanding Meditation for Health and Martial Art It seems the simplest thing, standing still. But when you actually try it, and pay close attention, it’s not that easy. The “still” part, especially, becomes very difficult the longer one tries to do it. One always seems to be moving a little bit, involuntarily shifting a little bit from heel to toe, or from left to right foot, twitching a little here, itching a little there. Because in a fight, any involuntary movement represents an opening that can be attacked by the opponent, standing meditation seeks to do away with all involuntary movement, and to make any and all movement strictly voluntary, i.e., an act of awareness and will. The method of standing meditation leads students to become still by first becoming aware of all their involuntary movement and then, as such movement occurs, minimizing it through relaxation and intent. Moreover, in conjunction with postural 30\n\nrealignment, standing meditation utilizes natural breathing methods to cultivate the simultaneous relaxation and integration of the motor and sensory systems. The stillness thus cultivated is not a passive state of inaction in which the motor system is switched off. On the contrary, this stillness constitutes an active readiness to move in any direction, with full awareness and control over the body’s central equilibrium. Literally, such stillness is the foundation for both the offensive and defensive skills of the internal martial arts. While it may take years of standing meditation practice to achieve mastery of its martial applications and implications, a whole range of the health benefits becomes available much sooner. Neurologically, standing meditation works first and foremost on the functions of the cerebellum. These are the internal senses of (1) balance and (2) proprioception (the internal perception of one’s body parts). These senses usually are taken for granted and operate largely below the level of our awareness. Generally, we are not aware of our balance until we lose it, and likewise we don’t consciously perceive the structural and functional relationship of one body part to another. Standing meditation, as demonstrated by Master Tam (Fig. 8), unifies balance and proprioception and brings them to the foreground of our awareness. With time, it reintegrates the various parts of our muscular, skeletal and connective tissue systems around a precisely aligned vertical axis. This leads us to a new awareness of the relationships of these systems within the context of the body’s central equilibrium.\n\n31\n\nOn a social level, standing meditation offers itself as an antidote for the stresses and strains imposed on the individual by life in contemporary society. Modern life simultaneously imposes the stress of chronic and prolonged sympathetic excitation on its participants, depleting the body’s store of energy reserves, while suppressing the parasympathetic nervous system and its restorative functions.8 This disruption of the basic functional polarity of the autonomic nervous system is evident in the widespread sub- or malfunction of the vegetative systems in so many people today. In this context, the restorative effects of standing meditation derive from the effect of its postural and breathing methods on the autonomic nervous system. Standing mediation promotes the rebalancing of the two branches of the autonomic nervous system. The practice of stillness of body and tranquility of mind simultaneously inhibits the chronically activated sympathetic nervous system and stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system. In this way, then, standing meditation is a cure for the “stress” civilization inflicts on us: its practice leads to improvement of our basic vegetative functions. As our digestive, reproductive, circulatory and respiratory systems function more and more robustly, we come to enjoy the good health and increased vitality levels of the qi stage.\n\n8\n\n32\n\nWe will explore this in greater detail in a later chapter, but briefly, the autonomic nervous has two complementary and opposing branches: the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic branch and its associated hormonal system marshals and uses the body’s energetic resources for periods of activity in general, and for crises in particular. The parasympathetic branch and its associated hormonal system replenishes our energy during periods of inactivity and rest. It optimizes and regulates the vegetative functions of digestion, reproductive, circulation and respiration.\n\nChapter 2: Integrating Posture, Breath\n\nF\n\nand Awareness in Stillness and Movement Gravity Lines West and East\n\nig. 9 is a skeletal chart like many that grace the office walls of your local doctor or chiropractor. The image shows the line of gravity, or centerline, of a human body as it hangs from a hook attached to a fixed ceiling. Seeing the chart in the waiting room at my medical practitioner’s office for many years, and being much interested in the nature of movement, for a while I had a slightly morbid fascination with this image. At some point I began to wonder if the human being so depicted was dead or alive.\n\nCenter of Gravity Navel Navel\n\nHeel Heel\n\nWestern of Gravity Gravity Western Line Line of (Centerline)\n\nI eventually came to the conclusion that most probably he was dead meat, to use the vernacular. For one thing, the body is hanging there, and there’s no floor to support the feet – a difficult feat for anyone to do for any length of time and live. So what we’re seeing here is the vertical line of gravity, not of a living human being but of an inanimate and inert object. Indeed, the body’s general look and the position of the feet in particular, indicate the body has been dead for a while, stiffened by freezing or rigor mortis, or both. The angle of the feet indicates that they are fixed in the flexed position and are not naturally extended with the toes pointing down as would be the case if a person had just died from hanging. But even if Fig. 9 were a depiction of a living person, and we concede that (1) the artist just forgot to draw a floor to stand on or (2) the person was consciously maintaining flexed feet (to say the least, an arduous task while hanging), we can only reach one conclusion: functionally, this person still is\n\n33\n\nincapable of movement. The line of gravity entering the earth at his heels makes him flat footed and indicates a static posture from which it is very difficult to initiate movement. Moreover, both hips and knees are in a locked position, further inhibiting and limiting movement. Fig. 10 represents the eastern concept of the optimal alignment of the human body and shows the centerline that the internal martial artist seeks to maintain. In most important ways it represents the complete antithesis of the model hanging in western medical offices. To begin with, note the different arrows on the line of gravity. The arrow on the western model is pointing down because it is established, passively, from the top down by the body hanging. The gravity line in the eastern model has arrowheads pointing both up and down, indicating that the body is striving to extend itself upward to counter the gravitational pull downward. Here the line of gravity is established actively in a standing position, rooting the body to the ground in such a way that it is ready to move in any direction at any moment.\n\nEastern Line of Gravity (Centerline) Baihui (crown) Baihui\n\nCenter of Gravity\n\nMingmen\n\nNavel Dantian Huiyin (Perineum)\n\nGenitals Huiyin (Perineum) Anus\n\nIn this eastern model, the alignment of Yongquan the centerline is based on the principle (Bubbling Well) of “three points on a line.” The points Bubbling Well are the three acupuncture points called the yong quan (bubbling well) in the feet, the hui yin point (perineum) between anus and genitals, and the baihui (百會) point at the crown of the head. When we examine the alignment of these three points from the ground up, we can see how it engages all the extensor muscles of the body, but particularly those of the legs and spine, to maximally extend the body vertically upward in space. 34\n\nThe line of gravity enters the ground towards the front of the feet at the yong quan, or bubbling well point, in the eastern model whereas in the western model, it enters the ground through the heels. Neurologically, the yong quan, or bubbling well point, is a reflex point that when stimulated, activates the extensor muscles of the legs into a readiness for posture and movement. Unlocking the knees, as shown, further facilitates this reflexive readiness. Here I invite the reader to perform a simple mind/ body experiment to verify these observations. Simply stand with the feet parallel, close your eyes and in your mind picture yourself at the end of a diving board getting ready to jump off and dive. Notice that in preparing for the dive, you unlock, or even bend, the knees and shift your weight forward onto the balls of your feet. Now let us consider the hui yin, or perineum, point between anus and genitals. It is not an easy thing to align the central gravity line to go through the perineum point. The main obstacles in this effort are chronically contracted musculature of the hips and lumbar spine, that have resulted in the average human being having largely frozen hips and pathological curvature of the spine. As will be described in detail in chapters that follow, the most important tool at our disposal to reverse this damage is the mindful use of the breath to loosen the frozen musculature and realign the posture. When the hips and spine loosen, the pelvis can be tilted and the tailbone pulled under and forward to position the perineum properly. The effect of this on the spine is to minimize the lumbar curve, effectively lengthening the spine. The resulting lower back feels flat, full, and above all, very strong, as it effectively integrates the lower and upper parts of the torso. The newly relaxed hips, moreover, allow us to reclaim the functional use and development of the torso’s rotational abilities for martial arts and other uses. At the top end of the spine it is much the same story as at the bottom end. Here a difference in conception of what constitutes the topmost point of the human body also gives rise to differences in the alignment of the centerline. The western model considers the top of the head to be the middle of the skull’s flat, top surface, and hangs the body from that point. While this actually is the posture of the average person, it points to the pathology of the average: the excessive curvature of the cervical spine actually tilts the head back and tilts the chin more or less up, making the flat part of the head the “top.” Effectively, this separates the head from the torso, and contributes to balance problems.\n\n35\n\nThe eastern model aligns the top of the centerline at the baihui point at the very crown of the head. This point is several inches back from the top point in the western model. It only becomes the “top” of the head when the chin is dropped, in the process straightening the spine’s cervical curvature, lengthening it upwards, and reintegrating the head with the torso, thus optimizing the whole body’s central equilibrium. To sum up, the western model of gravitational alignment is based on a body passively hanging from the head, immobile, whether dead or alive. The eastern model of proper gravitational alignment, on the other hand, is based on the body actively standing on its feet ready for action, i.e., movement. Let us now investigate this eastern model and its requirements in more detail.\n\nIntegrating Posture\n\nI remember watching a documentary video on some of the old generation surfers of Hawaii, men and women in their 60s, 70s and 80s, still practicing and enjoying their beautiful and dangerous art in advanced age. In one segment, one of these pioneering masters was conducting a workshop to transmit the “secrets” of success to the younger generation. To the novice, the placement and movement of the feet seem of prime importance. But the old-school surfer stressed that the first thing in maintaining balance was to always keep the head up, so that the body can adjust underneath it. Olympic skiers and skaters offer a similar lesson: even as their bodies perform incredible acrobatics, their heads remain steady all the while. The internal martial arts share with surfing and other sports an appreciation of the primacy of balance. In each, mastery requires great attention to the position of the head as the topmost part of our vertical structure, so that the body can be in balance and move freely underneath it. In standing meditation, because the position of the bottom-most part of our vertical structure, the feet, is equally important, we discuss both head and feet in the following paragraphs. The importance of both feet and head in the maintenance of posture has been demonstrated clearly by modern science. Our overall sense of balance of the whole body is created as the cerebellum integrates two sub-conscious streams of neural\n\n36\n\ninformation: the down-up stream that goes from feet to head, and the up-down stream that goes from head to feet. Standing meditation, right from the start, leads one to an awareness and integration of these two subconscious phenomena. Accordingly, the first two instructions to the new student of standing meditation pertain to the feet and the head. After the instructions for bottom (feet) and top (head), we will examine how the remaining middle segments of the body are integrated around its vertical axis into the state of central equilibrium. Needless to say, though the discussion here is necessarily linear and sequential, ultimately the awareness it seeks to cultivate is simultaneous. In standing meditation, the feet are placed parallel to each other, shoulder width apart for men, and hip width apart for women. The toes should be turned in a few degrees so that the outsides of the feet are parallel. The knees are unlocked but not bent. The difference is important -one has the same height whether the knees are locked or unlocked, but when the knees are bent, one’s height will be lower. The weight of the body enters the ground on what the Chinese call the yongquan, or bubbling well points of each foot. The bubbling well point is located just behind the ball of the foot. In traditional Chinese medicine, this is a critical energy gate and acupuncture point. In western medicine, it is an important reflex point that when stimulated, activates the extensors of the leg.9 Consciously placing the majority of the weight over these points helps to activate/ stimulate the reflex, which we can experience as awareness of the springiness of the legs pushing our torso up. As mentioned previously, the feeling is as if we are ready to jump up, like the diver at the end of the board preparing for a dive. By making the bubbling well points act as the center of each foot, we can distribute the weight evenly around the periphery of both feet. Paying attention to equal weight distribution between the inside and the outside of the feet, as well as the\n\n9\n\nDeane Juhan, op. cit., p.172.\n\n37\n\nfront and the back, will train the pressure-sensing nerve endings located throughout the surface of the feet. As a result, these nerve endings will give us increasingly accurate feedback regarding any deviation from optimal weight distribution. The knees are critically important in stabilizing the feet. To get the right feeling, one should imagine holding a balloon between the knees. Then imagine filling this balloon with air and feel the expansion putting the weight on the outside of the feet. Then, keeping the knees where they are, shift the weight back toward the inside of the feet until it is distributed 50/50 inside and outside. This provides the proper oppositional tension for the most stable base. At the same time, maintain two-thirds of the weight on the bubbling well and one-third on the heel. This stabilizes vertical structure by minimizing both the unintended forward/backward tilting, as well as the lateral shifting from foot to foot, of the center of gravity line. Moreover, imagining the ball between the knees not only stabilizes and integrates the feet and lower leg, but also enables the integration of the entire leg with the lower torso by means of the hip joints. In standing meditation the head is held high, as if trying to touch the sky with the crown of the skull, or as if balancing a jug of water on it. The slight pushing up with the crown actually allows the neck muscles to relax, causing the chin to drop a little and the eyes to look forward horizontally so that they naturally gaze at the horizon. As we have seen, tucking the chin in lightly straightens the cervical curve and makes the crown, or more precisely, the baihui acupuncture point, the top of the head. It’s important to reiterate that this alignment differs from the western notion that the flat part of the skull is the top of the head, a notion that derives from widespread, habitual, and excessive cervical curvature. The correct postural positioning of the head not only minimizes the cervical curvature, but produces a sensation that the torso is hanging from the head. This stretching, elongating and relaxing the neck is the objective, rather than the feeling that the head is resting as a dead weight on the body. Because the joint receptors around the vertebrae in the neck provide the balance organs in the inner ear with information\n\n38\n\npertaining to the position and movement of the torso, a relaxed neck is critically important in optimizing the sense of balance. If the head leans one way or another habitually, it impedes the optimal flow of balance and positional information to the central nervous system in two ways. One, some muscles are too tight and others too lax, and both impair the flow of neural data streams. Second, because the head weighs a lot the body wants to fall the way the head leans, and is prevented from doing so only by unconscious muscular exertion employed to counteract it. In other words, if the head is out of true vertical and horizontal alignment, the chances of losing balance increase significantly. The number of neural calculations and instructions by the central nervous system necessary to maintain body balance multiply geometrically when the head is moving or positioned off the optimal horizontal and vertical planes. The more these neural demands increase, the more difficult it will be to maintain the balance and posture of the body. Since the organs of balance — the inner ears and the eyes — are situated in the head, cultivating optimal position of the head is critical to making the unconscious balance reflexes conscious. It is for this reason that standing meditation trains us to keep the head as still and stable as possible in order to facilitate and hone the overall postural stability and balance of our entire body. Just as standing meditation instructions tell us to straighten out the cervical spinal curve, they also tell us to straighten the lumbar spinal curve. The essential technique in the straightening of the lumbar curve is to use the pelvic tilt to point the coxyx, or tail bone, towards the ground, as opposed to its normal tendency to curve backward. Think of tucking the tail between the legs, or of sitting down on a high bar stool. Skeletally and structurally, toeing in a bit, unlocking the knees and holding the ball between them, facilitates this pelvic tilt, and correctly positions the legs’ femurs in the hip sockets. The pelvic tilt and straightening of the lumbar curve is the primary structural requirement for the integration of the lower with the upper torso, and for making the power of the former accessible to the latter. We maintain this integration of the lower torso by a slight contraction of the iliopsoas group of hip flexor muscles. In the internal martial arts tradition, pushing out the lumbar spine and minimizing its\n\n39\n\ncurve is called opening the “gate of life” or “filling the ming men.” Under normal circumstances the action of the iliopsoas group in producing the pelvic tilt is helped by the contraction of the rectus abdominis, the large muscle group in the front of the body that connects the rib cage to the pelvis and pubic bones. But when the pelvis is tilted in the standing meditation postures, the rectus abdominis must remain completely relaxed, i.e., the belly is not tense and pulled in, but allowed to hang naturally. I often demonstrate this integrative effect to students in the following way. I will stand normally, with a pronounced lumbar curve, and ask one of them to push me gently in the small of the back at the junction the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. Because the upper and lower torsos are effectively disintegrated under this condition, a student finds that very little pressure can easily cause me to lose my balance. Then I repeat the same instruction but I move into my meditative stance and have the same student feel how I straighten out the lumber curve. I ask the student to push me again with the same amount of force as before. Now it is very easy to withstand quite a strong force applied at the same spot, making a persuasive demonstration of increased stability. The default posture in standing meditation (Fig. 11) is known as the universal posture, or post. We hold the two arms in front of the body anywhere between the abdomen and the eyes. Usually, however, we hold the arms at shoulder level. This strengthens the upper back through stretching its muscles, and at the same time allows the chest to relax. Here, working with the image of embracing or holding a ball can be effective in eliciting the proper sensation, namely, that the hands, forearms, upper arms, shoulders and upper back constitute a structural, functional and energetic circle. Holding our elbows in front and slightly to the side of the body, we keep them bent at just over 90 degrees. The wrists and fingers slightly curve and open also as if each hand is holding a ball. The palms line up with the shoulders. All this is in accordance with the instructions from the internal martial arts classics, such as Yang Chengfu’s (楊澄甫) “Ten Points”10 and Wang Xiangzhai’s “The Right Path of Yiquan”11.\n\n40\n\n10\n\nYang Cheng Fu, “The Ten Essentials of Taijiquan Theory” in “Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan” by Fu Zhongwen, Louis Swaim, transl., North Atlantic Books, Berkeley, CA, pp 16-19.\n\n11\n\nWang Xiangzhai, “The Right Path of Yiquan”, Timo Heikkila & Li Jong, transl., ebook, 2001, pp. 7-8.\n\nNatural and Normal Breathing\n\nWhen a person sets off on the path of internal martial arts body/mind transformation, she must be very clear on the distinction between natural and normal breathing patterns. Natural breathing is what we’re born with; normal breathing is what most individuals grow into with age. Natural breathing is healthy and powers one’s life energy; normal breathing is unhealthy (both deteriorative and pathological) and drains one’s life energy. Consequently, the first phase of the transformative process consists precisley of reversing the damage already done and transforming his “normal breathing” back into “natural breathing,” as the very foundation of good health. We were born breathing naturally, so it is to the newborn that we must look for the defining characteristics of natural breathing. Watch a baby when resting or sleeping to observe the rhythm of its breath. As the baby inhales, its tummy and rib cage inflate, or expand; on the exhalation, the tummy and rib cage deflate. From the outside, it seems a simple and straightforward rhythm. But to produce this fundamental rhythm, internally a complex choreography must take place. The diaphragm, the muscles of the pleural and abdominal cavities, and the spine, all interact cooperatively in the breathing process. Natural Breathing Natural Breathing\n\nThe muscles most directly involved in the expansion of the chest during the inhale are the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles surrounding the rib cage. The major partner is the diaphragm, which accounts for 75 percent of the effort, while the intercostal chest muscles contribute 25 percent. When the diaphragm contracts, the chest cavity is enlarged and the inhale occurs as air is actively sucked into the lungs.\n\nInhale Inhale\n\nExhale Exhale\n\nMoreover, as the diaphragm contracts, it pushes down on the contents of the abdominal cavity. To accommodate this displacement of abdominal viscera during contraction of the diaphragm, the abdominal muscles relax and the tummy inflates ( Fig. 12). In other words, the abdominal musculature–particularly the transverse abdominus–and the diaphragm work in opposite but complimentary ways. 41\n\nOn the exhale the exact opposite occurs. As the diaphragm relaxes, the chest cavity deflates and pushes the air up out of the lungs. The abdomen also deflates as the muscles of the abdominal wall contract (Fig. 12), elevating the dome of the diaphragm and helping to evacuate the used air. In a truly flexible spine such as that possessed by the very young, the spine also participates in the breathing process with a characteristic Inhale Exhale undulation. In natural breathing, on the inhale, the top and bottom tips of the spine (head and tail) will tend to bend back, maximize their curvatures, and arch the spine (Fig. 13). On the exhale, again, the reverse happens. The top and bottom tips of the spine tend to bend forward, minimizing the spinal curves and straightening the spine (Fig. 13). To sum up, the main characteristic of the natural breathing pattern is the complete participation and integration of the various body parts and systems, including the diaphragm, the abdominal muscles, the rib cage and the muscles of the chest, and the spine and its associated musculature. Inhale\n\nExhale\n\n...\n\nNormal Normal Breathing Breathing\n\nThe sad story of many if not most human lives is that people start out breathing naturally, i.e., optimally as babies, but deteriorate into adulthood patterns where what is normal is no longer natural. Breathing and postural patterns become affected for the worse, diminished by the stresses and strains of modern life. In the average adult, normal breathing is characterized by a diminution of all interrelated norms of form and function. Chronically contracted, Inhale Exhale Inhale Exhale the diaphragm itself is diminished in vigor and capacity. The abdominal muscles are frequently so weakened they can no longer participate (Fig. 14) and the chest muscles often are so tight they do not allow the proper expansion of the rib cage. Likewise, the spinal curves have become so frozen that\n\n42\n\nthe spine for all intents and purposes has become immobilized and has lost its ability to participate in the breathing process. The contracted, frozen diaphragm and associated musculature of the normal breathing pattern results in a pattern of shallow breathing centered solely in the chest. Over the long term, this results in a chronically frozen posture of inhalation that is symptomatic of the pathology of the normal breathing pattern. The chest appears pushed out permanently, the shoulders are pulled back in a chronic state of contraction, and the abdominal muscles are chronically over-stretched by the abdominal contents. It is as though the body is always gasping for air and never getting enough. The pathology of the normal breathing pattern is twin to, and mirrorred by, the pathology of the normal spine. The spine exhibits permamently immobilized curvatures of the lumbar and cervical segments typical of the posture of inhalation (Fig. 13). Frozen, the spine neither participates in the inhale nor the exhale. The result is a functional segmentation of upper and lower parts of the spine and torso. Standing meditation emphasizes the posture and mechanics of natural exhalation in the postural realignment of the body’s parts. Why? When we are startled by something, we hold our breath. When the situation passes, we may let out a sigh in relief. In other words, inhalation is the phase of the breath associated with holding tension in the body and exhalation is the phase of the breath associated with the release of tension. Ergo, if you want to release long held chronic tensions that adversely affect your posture and movement, you will have to engage in a sustained and systematic practise of “relearning” how to exhale. Generally, in both the natural breathing of the baby and the normal breathing of the adult, the exhalation is entirely passive because it happens when the diaphragm relaxes. By making the exhalation active rather than passive, standing meditation restores diaphragmatic function and spinal mobility. Specifically, the conscious use of the pelvic tilt and contraction of the abdominal muscles simultaneous with a lengthened exhale will result, in time, in the gradual unfreezing of the diaphragm. This will restore natural breathing ability, remobilize the lumbar spine and restore the functional integration of the lower and upper parts of the trunk in posture, breath and movement.\n\n43\n\nJust as the bodily functions of posture and breath become dissociated from each other and deteriorate in function, so the body as a whole becomes dissociated from the mind. And with the deterioration of posture and breath, there is a corresponding deterioration in the mental faculties that should control them. This creates negative feedback loops between the somatic functions and the mental faculties, which tend to spiral out of control unless conscious steps are taken to halt and reverse the process. The Chinese internal health and martial arts promise a state of glowing health through the diligent practice of posture, breath and mind. Standing meditation is a kind of therapy in which mindfulness transforms normal breathing and posture back into natural breathing and posture. To find our way back to what is natural, as opposed to normal, we must follow the advice Lao Tse gave over two thousand years ago: “… divest yourself from what you acquired after birth and return to find your original self … [to] control the vital force to achieve gentleness and become like the newborn child.”12\n\nIntegrating Awareness Awareness of our internal environment comes from the internal senses of central equilibrium and proprioception. Awareness of our external environment comes from our external senses: visual, auditory, olfactory and tactile. Ultimately, because of its stillness, standing meditation is the easiest method for cultivating the simultaneous awareness of both our internal and external environments. The next challenge is to maintain this awareness while moving. The highest, most difficult level requires maintaining this awareness while physically interacting with a training partner or opponent. To achieve this holistic awareness, the first and foremost requirement is that we must stop thinking and/or daydreaming and start cultivating awareness of each of our individual senses. Then, in each of the senses, the expansion of awareness requires a shift from hard to soft focus—literally, a shift in perspective from the center of perception to the periphery, from foreground to background. This allows us to come to experience awareness as the simultaneity of perceptions in time and space.\n\n12\n\n44\n\nLin Yu Tang, ed., “The Wisdom Of Laotse,” Random House, New York, 1948, p. 83.\n\nExternally, take vision as an example. Standing meditation instructs us to (soft) focus our eyes in the distance in order to activate our peripheral vision, because focused vision excludes perception of anything but the focused-on object, and leads to a linearity of time and experience. Focused perception makes a temporal sequence out of simultaneous object/events. For example, when I use focused vision and shift my focus from object to object, I am creating a linear sequence of perception (and therefore of time) from what is, in fact, simultaneous. But when I look at something far away in the distance, my peripheral visual sense will kick in to widen my field of perception. I can perceive all of these objects simultaneously in my peripheral vision. In the primeval sense of the alerting mechanism, using soft focus enables “field awareness” by allowing one to detect any movement in the wider field of vision. The external senses of hearing and smell can also have a hard or a soft focus, and the more we meditate, the more these perceptions will be based on soft rather than hard focus. For example, if we focus our ears on one sound in the environment, dominant though it may be, we don’t hear all the other sounds that constitute the background. Opening up our ears to the sea of background noise, we increase our awareness of all things going on in our environment. Likewise in the sense of touc"
