Feel free to contact as indicated.\n\nThis material was begun while teaching Aikido including in the Ukraine. I have not taught or trained in several years, so I consider myself retired. However, interest remains and this site is retained on the web so others might benefit and perhaps other organizations might use some of the organizational parameters. Aikido will continue to grow and participate in the fulfilling of earnest student's zeal for spiritual growth, autonomy, compassionate strength and fostering and protecting all life. These are very laudable goals and it is hoped that this will contribute to their traveling the path. Much of the material is oriented to western practitioners and to elevate the recognition of this unique art form in the west. Perspective is everything, we in the west are merely approximating the perspective of the east. But, the attempt is a good thing, it brings people together. In the world we can use as much togetherness as possible. This is the Ai of Aikido. Harmony breeds respect, and respect generates stalwart and selfless action. Aikido is in actuality no different than other spiritual paths. The path is always fraught with many barriers and usually a sufficient supply of epiphany. Aikido is a very good passage to epiphany, but it is also a discipline and disciplining. All spiritual paths are this as well. There is no achievement without effort, I trust this material will assist in the effort. The bitterness in life can be discarded and the pain of regret can heal. This is part of the great teaching and the Ai of Aikido. The moments that count are those that are before us. These pages are dedicated to all those that aspire, select a path, pursue a calling for the sake of truth, nothing more nothing less. Take each moment and suck in its essence, its breath. Epiphany will come.\n\nThis is not by any means a complete collection of terms. By the same token, it is more than a collection of Aikido terms. It is designed as an open-ended forum to treat many topics which have growth oriented, philosophical, spiritual, and health and healing implications. This is part of an ongoing project which will hopefully benefit from reader contributions at some point. It has a conventional alphabetical index in English and there are other dictionary resources with commentary accessed through hyper-link. At some later date there will be other indexes of classes of terms as in some other indexes, but for now there is a bit of mixing of etymology, history, philosophical constructs and other issues. Specifics of the commentary should differentiate types of terms. The index required considerable cross referencing and consolidation, just so everything is in one place. Presumably subclasses will be easier to derive and link later in the process.\n\nThere is both general and specific material contained in pages. Part of the purpose of this collection is to facilitate Aikido student access to resources, vocabulary, and historical data requisite for completion of course work and personal growth. The material should be understandable by most readers, however, people involved in the martial arts or other kindred growth medias are likely have an orientation that permits better appreciation and absorpsion.\n\nThere is an academic side of instruction complementary to training on the mat. Academics, however, are not a substitute for physical training. The physical training is the process. It is trusted, that readers understand, that the physical process is also a spiritual process. In part, this work, and concomitant pages build a better understanding for individuals to evolve a holistic pattern or gestalt regarding the nature of spiritual processes in general and in this case, specifically, Aikido. The notion of having an academic side is also to build a foundation for the system to take a well deserved position in academia. This is another process, one of enfranchising a subject matter set representative of diversity into legitimate recognition or a further step in inoculating alternative value sets into our western culture. Many writers have contributed to this effort and this is merely a part of an effort that has its own gestalt. This represents a spiritual movement that is gaining momentum in the west. This \"form\" of movement is not necessarily characteristic or a plowed field in the west, it is a method that has profound roots in the orient. Thus, many, ideas, or concepts are obscure to westerners.\n\nThis is a bit disingenuous. Much of this has to do with language, some culture, historical perspectives, and other issues . This is a bit presumptuous and inadequate to describe the actual state of things. Even in the orient the great majority of populations are not intimately engaged in such a process. We live in a material world, with exigencies and vicissitudes. Living is often hard, but regardless of setting, great spiritual lessons can be learned. Further, life and living can be far less difficult if attitudes and philosophies change to make helping others and sharing a bigger part of life. This does imply that one side of the planet is better than another. Neither does it imply that race, orthodoxy or other stricture provides complete insight to life, truth, and other big questions of existence. The last mention, it is important that readers understand that the writer's grasp of such matters is also limited, however, this does not imply that it is meaningless to share. This material is for bridge building and global value restructuring. One must have a vision to execute a plan. Subject matter is about back ground material beneficial to describe experiences.\n\nThis material, first, provides basic taxonomy to classify and negotiate Aikido terrain. This is much about identifiers and mapping. It must be reiterated that labels do not make experience, but they are generally the product of experience. Agreement anchors a label with reality or even another abstraction to make common use possible. However, words can get in the way of actually experiencing fully without preconception, filter or bias, but the alternative is also true, without tags, identifiers, legends and and other markings to the map, the map is less effective to facilitate travel, navigation. Regarding Aikido, every individual will eventually extract from practice, experience, examples and insights to assist others and to describe their own progress on the map. This is one of the virtues of the system, it accommodates diversity, and appreciates insight from diverse individual perspectives. Curriculum is not within this material, but is available on request. Aikido is not one single system and it has layers of transmission contingent on teacher experience and exposure to core skills and historical/linguistic basics. Most westerners enter the milieu ignorant of the bulk of implications. It is important to examine terminology, and coalesce a taxonomic nomenclature that facilitates understanding of the paradigm on which the system rests.\n\nInitially, it is important for the student to acquire a simple vocabulary to comply with instructions and perform protocols, this essentially has to do with conditioning and un-conditioning, or Waza. However, the terms imply much more than battle language, or brain draining repetition. The Japanese language like any language is replete with metaphor to cosmologies, philosophy, spiritual ideas, history, science, mythology and other cultural artifacts. It is likely at some point, readers will appreciate that most terms used by the founder, Morihei Uyeshiba, or those terms he elaborately expatiated, are clearly arcane or used in senses different than even current modern Japanese.\n\nStudents and casual readers are exposed to a developmental time frame for and within Aikido. Uyeshiba was born December 14, 1883 as Japan was emerging or transforming to a world power. The history of this involves the Meiji restoration, 1868-1912, a very tumultuous period. The profiling of pertinent history is also important for students because insight is gained by comparison to other concurrent events world wide and the uniqueness of Uyeshiba's circumstances. His generation's language, his words, archetypes and abstractions were formed in this time and appear quite representative of the old ways of Japan, yet he lived in the process of building the present Japan. The community of Aikido is rich and young practitioners are exposed to older practitioners. The older practitioners have experiences that make them kind of \"time capsules\", and rich sources for anecdotal information about the system and persons involved.\n\nEarly on in training, this author, had an interesting conversation with another Aikidoka named Ernie Fleischmann who had just returned to the states from Japan where he had trained and gained the rank of Nidan. Ernie's story went like this. When he was first in Japan his language skills were limited and he would sit next to Joanne Tohei. Joanne was to become the wife of Akira Tohei Sensei, and this was when she was single and training with O'Sensei. This incident occurred in the late 60's while Morihei Uyeshiba was still alive of course. Although the master often taught with sparse commentary, occasionally he would ramble on expostulating on the art and spiritual matters. All students paid great attention. Ernie paid attention, but as most non Japanese was not getting the meat of the instruction, so he nudged Joan and whispered \"what is he saying\". This is something only a Gijin would attempt as the Master was talking. She whispered \"I don't know, that's old Japanese.\" Some things, even small things stick in the mind and memory, as generations move on, language changes, and sometimes ideas are gained and sometimes very important matters are lost in translation and time. We should all be very grateful for the moments we have in the presence of truly great men and women. But, this does not imply that we should not be grateful in all cases.\n\nIn many ways Morihei Uyeshiba teaching was manifestations, or elaborations on the concepts he discussed, explored, and codified into form, inclusive of waza. Aikido was is art, form, love. For him every action was Aikido and the merging represented by this term or identity. These are not my words, Henry Kono Sensei from Canada referred to him as God crazy. I like to think that he was holy mad. There is a rich fullness in this sort of presentation, it glows and depicts the essences of that aspiration no matter how far one has traveled. One must appreciate the comprehensiveness of this in terms of formulation of an art form, personal conduct, and legacy. Aikido is a heuristic model, system, with much hands on experience in a broad exposure to exigent conditions. Time is short, tempus fugit, life is short, make the most of it.\n\nThe terms have of themselves an orientation, that is they face the core issues that are revealed by the process of Aikido. Clearly, the vocabulary of Aikido reflects its philosophy, so these must be first intellectually comprehended by students, and then, since many terms describe states of being, they the states, become, hopefully, more facilely integrated into every action and intentional conduct.\n\nThe niche to which these ideas are drawn is the arena of conflict, personal, internal and external, extending to the behavior of humankind with respect to themselves, others and the planet. Most of the terms and ideas have metaphysical connotations, even the technical terms applied to technique, waza, have practicality linked with metaphysics, physics and metaphysics, in relative proportion. These are important issues and deserve exploration and exploitation.\n\nThis collection of terms reflects my understanding of the topic in the broadest sense. This does not imply that the interpretation is always correct or dead on. As the student matures they will encounter numerous interpretations and personal experiences that will mold their meanings and metaphors. Good luck, this means that we should have much to discuss as the time on the mat accrues.\n\nLanguage reflects and evolves associated with necessity and how users interpret their so called reality. Language also reflects how people think and what people think about. However, not all experience can be condensed into spoken or written language. [Semiotics]\n\nThe actual nature of these symbols we call language is more significant than expressed by the concept of abstraction. They also represent tools that permit and facilitate exploration into many areas of inquiry. For example, mathematics is a language, a facilitator, a means to probe into matters of common interest and expand knowledge in regions not represented by external so called normal reality. There are rationalist and empirical attributes to language, again, this is clear and rather simplistic, but also unifying in terms of philosophical evolution. Also, this is primarily representative of Western philosophy and religion. Other philosophical, spiritual, religious traditions and lineages have distinct precursors, typologies, and have explored topics from other perspectives which view different terrains, topologies. This refers to internal versus external investigation, or that which lies inside the human body/mind/spirit, and that which appears to exist external to that container of body, mind, spirit.\n\nUnfortunately, combined terms like, body/mind/spirit are inadequate to describe many attributes of the topic set east, west, north or south, but especially the form of eastern philosophical investigation. This is not to ignore African or Southern American traditions or histories, however, this is more anthropology not included in this forum. Forming a conceptual bridge between east and west is not that easy. English is not that accommodating to discuss certain matters with the obsessive granularity, or clear resolution, as in microscopic analysis, present in other traditions. Again, this is only partially true, there are treatments of such matters within western traditions. This includes the noumanistic experience [Otto, Kant], spiritism/spiritualism [spiritualist, theosophical, charismatic movements], mysticism, gnosticism, transcendentalism, and other -isms that probe into issues of human soul, consciousness, destiny, rewards and punishments like karma but not necessarily described by karma, eschatological constructs and the subtle substances conveyed by nature and through the nature of man.\n\nPlease indulge, it is understood that many topics will not be known or understood by readers. This is about stimulation to inquire into such matters. Connections must be revealed before readers obtain sufficient, albeit, less complete appreciation of such matters. Specificity in all things, matters, whether they are internal to the psyche or external require distinction, differentiation, and delineations to map terrains of a particular kind. All topics that are carefully constructed and delineated provide insight, whether intellectual or practical. The process is about investigating and possibly integrating such topics and by personal experience ratifying or not statement proclaimed in such work. There are many other such systems and teachings that render much the same implications. There are other traditions outside western exposure that exposit similar thought threads.\n\nSufficient to say, language is a portal to understanding, but it must not be mistaken for reality, or the real thing either on the epistemic, empirical, side or on the abstracted, revelatory, rationalistic side. As mentioned not all systems or even modes of human expression are recognized as linguistic in form or substance, but perhaps the notion of language should be broadened to include other systems that might by character not be verbal or written. For example, music might be considered, strictly speaking, language, and conveys ideations, has formality. Aikido takes the shape of a language because it has all the elements. For example, it is systematic, descriptive, practical and predictive. This is true of all martial training, and it has counterparts in all aesthetic pursuits, that is, art. These systems do not exist in a cultural or non linguistic vacuum. Languages do not exist in vacuums.\n\nThese systems supplement their process with characteristic language, and rely on language to transmit insight. These systems are unique and somewhat specific triggering mechanisms for the physical body of humans and psyche. In some systems, Aikido included, there is often little explanation, so that words do not clutter the experience. So, there are many considerations, philosophically and pragmatically regarding the intentions or purposes of the construction. This is a whole person idea set, not fragmented or reduced to separate mind from body, from emotions, from aspirations and intentions, and the dedicated resolve to minutely explore this panorama for personal and social benefit. This is, in fact, why the martial pursuits are called arts, but this does not discard the craft, careful honing of skill inside the craft. The same essential rationale or concept lies as a source for the term \"Healing Arts\", craft plus creativity sometimes to the point of miraculous.\n\nIt should be noted by the reader that this current explanation requires a significant number of words, and has some complexity. It might be criticized as too much talking. Point well taken. In some respects the concepts expressed are fundamental, as they are intellectualized, complexity appears. This is part of the process that expresses through product. Product can be conduct, behavior, insight, and verbose verbalizations. While there are benefits to Spartan activity and focus on essentials, the expansion is also part of the process. If a person cannot say, describe or paint their experiences, they might not be finishing the task the process sets in motion. There are many niches of endeavor, exploration and investigation for human amusement and need. However, these descriptors, also lack depth. There are no dearth of matters, issues, that are examined within such a process  values, morality, conduct, compassion, respect, loyalty, honesty, sincerity, determination, and many other items are placed into focus and are subject to intellectual and emotional review.\n\nThe art part is ingrained with spontaneity regarding an urgency that simulates life and death struggle. In real life soldiers confront this as a reality that cannot be dismissed. Practice on the mat or rather in the dojo is a relative safe zone to press limits of experience without the threat of mutilation and death. The dojo is a spiritual oasis, it should be safe, or at least sufficiently organized and regulated to preserve practitioners and the process. This also reduces collateral damage, in other words, uninvolved persons are not swept into the path of the turmoil and stress brewed on this path or in process. This option is far better than the threat of battle for whatever reason. This also merely simulates an enemy, and perhaps this is the point. The enemy is us.\n\nThe art of the martial artist is in part the creative confrontation with death. This sounds morbid and negative. As expertise evolved, they, practitioners, through various individuals, grafted philosophy and spirituality into their systems. All trees spread roots. The systems, particularly in Japan, where there was much bitterness, struggle and uncertainty, began to seek appreciation of life in every moment. Practitioners became scholars, philosophers, artists, craftsmen, musicians, etc. extracting experience from life in a energetic and perspicacious fashion, after all extracting the maximum from the moment was essential to the training. This attention to detail is part of the goal. This in not just about Japan, because philosophical traditions were tapped that were much older than the evolution of the martial arts in Japan. This evolution made budo, the martial way. The systems were about how one lived life, experienced it, even when confronted with death. They became about creativity, urgency in every moment, fulfillment and living fully.\n\nCreativity in life, extraction of insight from living, all those things that enrich the martial artist as a human delivered insights that transcended the niche of warfare and the martial ways. This is what, the substance, that is derived from the practice and training. This makes Aikido and other systems also \"sciences\". But the science attribute or attributive, is more about craft, honing skill, technologies, and other such materialistic factors. The art is transcendent of the material. It is about living a moment, fully, completely. So, completely are the moments lived that perception, if not the individual, reaches into the sources or source of creation. This is what Master Uyeshiba spoke of in terms of nurturing and protecting all life, especially in its correct form, so that it can manifest its potential. It is also about how he described his art as performance from the center of the universe. Quite a set of statements to live up to or aspire to.\n\nIt is my belief, that among other things, Aikido itself has many language like qualities, this refers to syntactical features as well as the metaphorical implications inherent in the practice. This is the form of Aikido not the commentary about Aikido. Glossaries like this concern commentary. They are helpful but are derivative of the system as are the experiences initiated by the system.\n\nThis glossary is not intended to teach the student Japanese or inculcate a philosophy, it should be considered tools for exploration. It should stimulate the student to look at their own language and modes of expression to determine how they can culture their thought processes to enhance personal development. If you cannot express truth in your own inimitable way, words, art, science, whatever, there is little likelihood that your understanding is profound. The words of the past are someone else's insight. Use this glossary to nurture your own unique perspective, and break free from narrow interpretations of truth that may haunt from the past.\n\nMany of the terms have more than a literal interpretation and readers may find different nuances to definitions from other sources. Some comparisons of Kanji and associated phonetics are quite complex, and perplexing. Each person will have to sort out what works best for them and the truth of the traditional context. Martial art terms in general and Aikido terms not infrequently derive from archaic concepts, and are often anachronisms. Many of the common every day Japanese terms are slanted in Aikido because of this. Many terms have metaphysical connotations that are very rich in meaning and implication, but at the same time elusive with respect to personal concrete experiential reference. So, in particular, we in the west employ confabulation to rationalize that which is unknown. This implies ethnocentrism and bias. But, in all things interpretation is individualized, so there will always be a filter to ideas regardless from which source the come.\n\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing, the imagination is a powerful tool, as is the mind in terms of memory and deductive (and other forms of regimented and unregimented / intuitive) reasoning. One benefit of discovering things new is that it is not tainted by the past or it is not someone else's idea and I am simply parroting it. The down side is that history and culture are evidence that man has thought these thoughts before and they have been obscured or lost in a tragic way. This means that we as individuals must reacquire this knowledge / perspective again and reassert any relevant truth into action in a world that has forgotten such essences. This is truly a tedious and ambitious task, but one that could eventually build very powerful, autonomous, sagacious human beings, wise in the understanding of the past, present and the building of the future. It is hoped that controversy and discussion in such forums be a beginning of scholarly interpretations over time. Every person should at some point derive their own Metaphysical conduit, this in turn will make their lives richer. So please do not limit yourself to just what is here."
