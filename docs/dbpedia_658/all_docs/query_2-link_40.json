        "text": "The aim is to describe the route to mastery in martial arts and attempts to identify patterns. What is the average time taken to achieve first master degree, to achieve the highest technical degree, and to achieve the highest rank of master (10 dan)? Background. Theories of sports training, the humanistic theory of martial arts and the anthropology of martial arts give us a scientific perspective for the research. Particularly relevant here are the concepts of “long-term athlete development”, “the highest technical degree” and “budō ontogenesis”. Material and method. Material for the study was obtained from sports CVs and by analysing the route taken to mastery by selected outstanding practitioners of martial arts (Instructors, Masters) and combat sports (Olympic athletes and champions). To develop a longitudinal study (for the years 1998-2014) a diagnostic survey questionnaire technique (N = 285) was included, but some of the data was collected by analysing the contents of various ...\n\nThe study concerns Polish fencing (hussar sabre fighting) and Japanese kenjutsu (art of sword). It focuses on forms of their promotion as well as popularization and its scope. In the light of history, theoretical sociology and anthropology of martial arts selected relevant facts are discussed in an attempt to explain the reasons for the changes which have occured. An attempt is also made to compare the progress of the process of institutionalization in the case of both martial arts. Three complementary qualitative research methods were used: a long-term observation in the role of a participant (25 years), content analysis of the literature and the case study. In addition, the author presents the case study of an international seminar on kenjutsu of the Katori Shinto-ryu school organized in Krakow. The date of the seminar coincided with the 20 th anniversary of the battle demonstration where a representative of the fencing school fought against W. Zablocki, a master of the Polish hus...\n\nBackground and Problem. Within the scientific concept of Non-entertaining Tourism the problem of similarities and differences between some cases of martial arts’ tourism was studied. This study serves as a contribution to the state of knowledge on martial arts tourism. Method. The method is a single case study research, both descriptive and evaluative, with participant observation and photographic documentation. Results. It was found that the meeting and seminar being described served both martial arts practice and scientific research, the assessment of the situation and the planning of further activities. Several people were honoured and further stages of cooperation were established. It is a certain novum in reflecting on this kind of tourism that one of its stated goals may be the coordination of activities in the field of the institutionalisation of martial arts. Conclusions. It is important to know that meetings of experts and leaders of martial arts organisations are special c...\n\nThis article discusses the issue of Far Eastern ideas which relate to maintaining, regaining and improving the state of security focusing chiefly on Japanese concepts which, despite their individual character, stem from ideas of the Far East: India, Tibet, China, Korea and Okinawa Island. The processes of intercultural exchange put various traditions at humankind's disposal. The article shows to what extent and how the old Japanese tradition survived to present day and became known throughout the world. There are attempts to account for the usefulness or even need of referring to Far Eastern security methods with regard to arguments put forward by Weaver, Huntington and Buchanan (peril to the Western civilization), as well as to other reasons pointing to important benefits to our knowledge gained as a result of the Japanese offer. Deliberations on security have constantly been a part of the human history. They are elements enabling to develop effective measures which stave off both the outer danger and the danger which may originate in an inner, autonomous system of an individual with a psychophysical character. The securitology-based viewpoint, which stems from the philosophy of security, allows, among other things, for a very holistic approach to the subject in question, which finds its position in the Maslow's hierarchy of needs, as apart from the existential safety need, it becomes also an implementation of self-actualization. It gives meaning to the life, making the risk of mediocrity and senseless existence fade away and brings the desired relief from any fear. The dilemmas of the Western people are evident, especially those who become aware of the alternative between the man on the move, including freedom and development, and the modern treacherously enticing, consumerist slavery excluding the possibility to enter the spiritual path, which would be as effective and as difficult as the noble Path of the Warrior.\n\nSummary Study aim: On the ground of holistic anthropology of martial arts the authors analyze the spheres of fi ght – from the physical dimension of a duel to transcendent and moral dimensions placed in the fi ghter’s conscience. The aim of the work is an attempt to explain the phenomenon of martial arts. Material/methods: The qualitative methods of empirical social studies have been used – the expert’s judgement (meijin Sieber 10 dan and opinions given by other specialists in martial arts and combat sports), long-term participating observation of the authors and heuristics from the humanist perspective of the theory of martial arts. Results: One may distinguish the following categories of fi ght – its spheres: physical (perception, pain stimuli, movement and techniques of fi ght), emotional, referring to the will, intellectual, ethical, symbolic and not connected directly with psychophysical practice – the spiritual sphere (of individual moral choices on the way of life).
