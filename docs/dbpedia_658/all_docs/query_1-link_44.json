        "text": "At Aikido of Livermore - Shinrei Dojo, we train in both Aikido and Shinkendo. The chief instructor is Jim Alvarez Sensei . Alvarez Sensei holds an Aikido rank of Godan (5th Degree Black Belt) certified by the Aikikai Hombu Dojo Aikido World Headquarters in Japan, and the Shinkendo Rank of Chuden Renshi certified by the International Shinkendo Federation.\n\nShinrei Dojo is a member of Aikido Schools of Ueshiba (ASU), an international association of more than 70 affiliated dojos. Mitsugi Saotome Shihan serves as the supervisory instructor for these ASU dojos. Saotome Shihan began as a special apprentice with the founder of Aikido, Morihei Ueshiba (O Sensei), in 1955, and continued for 15 years until the founder's death in April of 1969. In 1975, Saotome Shihan decided to leave his highly respected position as a senior instructor at Aikido World Headquarters in Tokyo to come to the United States. ASU is affiliated with Aikido World Headquarters - Aikikai Hombu Dojo in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nOur dojo is also affiliated with the International Shinkendo Federation founded by Toshishiro Obata Soke, who acts as head instructor for over 46 Shinkendo dojos around the world.\n\nAfter many years of study and mastery of many different schools in his native Japan, Obata Sensei came to America to distill all of the different aspects of Japanese Swordsmanship into one complete and comprehensive art. Obata Kaiso has dedicated over thirty years to teaching and researching the almost lost art of true Japanese Swordsmanship as it was practiced by the Samurai of Japan's feudal era.\n\nWhile Shinkendo requires rigorous physical training, depth of coordination, and intense focus, one of the most important aspects of Shinkendo is the emphasis on spiritual forging, which inspires \"Bushi Damashii\" (the samurai/ warrior spirit), a quality that we feel is as relevant now as it was hundreds of years ago. Proper practice of Shinkendo should provide one with not only a strong body and mind, but also a calm, clear and focused spirit."
