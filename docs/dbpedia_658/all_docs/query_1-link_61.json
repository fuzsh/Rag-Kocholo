        "text": "I pretty much have taken the idea from that lineage website etc Feel free to post your lineage and see where it traces to. IMO it is very important to know where your specific Martial Art comes from. You don't want to learn from someone who learned from some guy in the back of a laundromat. How you post it is up to you. You can post a picture, video desribing your lineage, or you can just type it out.\n\nWhen giving the information, you do NOT have to provide their titles, example just as master, grandmaster, hanshi etc... Their names should be sufficient imo if you are taught by someone legit. A \"title\" does not make you legit. For example, I know a guy, that was an orange belt at the karate school I attend. At our school we dont promote fast so I guess he got frustrated and left went somewhere else.... that was like 4 years ago... all of a sudden he's being called \"Master ......\" I wont put his name out there not my concern but that was basically the example of how titles can be very misleading.\n\nI'll give a quick example of my shotokan lineage:\n\nGichin Funakoshi ----> Teruyuki Okazaki ----> Maynard Miner ----> George Cofield ----> Thomas La Puppet Carroll ----> Victor Rodriguez ----> Maribel Ramos ----> Javier Guzman\n\nI also train with my teacher's teacher, V. Rodriguez. He is also student of Vincent Cruz and Victor Mosquera. Those lineages goes as follows:\n\nGichin Funakoshi ---->Isao Obata/Hidetaka Nishiyama ----> Vincent Cruz ----> Victor Mosquera ----> Victor Rodriguez ----> Maribel Ramos ----> Javier Guzman\n\nHere is a pic to help out further explanations:\n\nSo feel free to post and share! Maybe you'll run across someone that has trained in the same system/style you do or even from the same family tree! Osu!\n\nThat guy in the back of the laundromat could be the biggest hidden treasure in the entire region. Don't discount him just because you don't know who he is. Some of the best training from the best people can be had in very informal situations, and some of those people are not famous.\n\nI fully understand the lineage issues, but at the same time, sometimes it just doesn't matter. Some lineages are almost unknown outside of their home territory, so the names would not mean anything to anyone here anyway.\n\nI only offer these comments to give some perspective. I'm not trying to derail the thread. Carry on.\n\nThe thing about lineages in Chinese martial arts is a lot of people claim them based on the fact they trained with the guy a couple times. And in CMA that is not how it works. If it was I would have a lineage to the Chen Family from Chen Zhenglei, 2 lineages to Yip Man, a couple to different Bagua families and at least 3 in Xingyiquan, Heck While I'm at it I might as well claim a Chen family lineage to Chen Xiawang too because I once had a rather long, and interesting, phone conversation with Ren Guangyi about Chen Taijiquan. But the reality of lineage in the CMA world is I have none of those. So be careful when asking about lineages in CMA.\n\nWhat I do have\n\nChen Changxing > Yang Luchan > Yang Jianhou > Yang Chengfu > Tung Ying Chieh > My Shifu > Me\n\nChen Chingping > Wu Yuxiang > Li Yiyu > Hao Weizhang > Li Hsiang Yuan > Tung Ying Chieh > My Shifu > Me\n\nThat guy in the back of the laundromat could be the biggest hidden treasure in the entire region.

You didn't say, \"made up\".\n\nI believe a whole lot of Chinese immigrants got low paying jobs in places like laundromats and restaurants. Some of those immigrants were highly skilled Kung fu people, so the laundromat analogy might actually be reality. So I just wanted, as i said, to add some perspective.\n\nMy sifu had a more open school back in the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, he has taught a very small number of students in his back yard and garage, including me. His name is only known in certain circles. The system he teaches is not widely known. Given that, if people don't understand the back story, they might assume he is a fraud. In truth, he is one of the very best, and is by far the best of the half dozen or so teachers that I have had.\n\nI'm not very concerned with lineage, except as a way of understanding where the ideas came from. It can also be a useful way to dig backwards and find some new ways to understand techniques and principles.\n\nMy primary art is Nihon Goshin Aikido, which was founded by Morita Shodo in the 1940's. He had training in multiple arts, with the principle art being Daito-ryu Aiki-jujutsu. We don't know who his instructors were in other arts (reportedly Shotokan Karate, Kodokan Judo, and possibly some exposure to Ueshiba's Aikijujutsu (what it was called at the time), as well as some wrestling. Oral history (there are no written records we've ever been able to find) says his Daito-ryu instructor was Kitaro Yoshida. My lineage forks, so I'll try to clarify it.\n\nMorita Shodo -> Richard Bowe -> Steve Weber -> Gerry Seymour\n\n- also Steve Weber -> Joe Beckham -> Gerry Seymour\n\n- also Steve Weber -> John Wyndham -> Gerry Seymour\n\nI've left out a couple of Associate Instructors who were my primary instructors for a time, to keep things simpler. The convoluted forking follows a progression of who ran the school I attended. Steve Weber opened the school, and I started under him. He moved and passed the school to Joe Beckham, who later decided to focus on his larger school in the next city, so John Wyndham took over the school.\n\nRegarding the unknown guy in the back alley, lineage only matters if you want to document that you are learning a specific style, and it often helps you sell a product, as you can claim an association with someone else who may be well known or accomplished. For example, if someone earns a black belt from Rickson Gracie, there is an association that is close and credible. It's very likely that this person is a strong martial artist, even if he is not well known.\n\nFor what it's worth, my lineage would be the following:\n\nMitsuyo Maeda > Carlos Gracie > George Gracie > Octavio de Almeida > Moises Muradi > Giva Santana > James Foster\n\nJapanese are very different about this than Chinese. Traditionally Kung Fu was taught in the back of a laundry mat or in the basement of a restaurant after hours or on a rooftop. The place with the sign and the contracts and the viewing area is much more suspect to me.\n\nBut, I get the point - it's good to know if you're training with some guy or getting something passed down with some Providence.\n\nMy lineage tree is on my website, which can be accessed from my signature tag. I don't want to take it upon myself to post those names here because the surviving members of my lineage have not chosen to expose themselves here and I am obliged to respect that."
