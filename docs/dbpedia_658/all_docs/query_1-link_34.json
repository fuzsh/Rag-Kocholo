        "meta_description": "Hi Guys, \n  My wife is thinking of starting Aikido, she has been studying jujutsu for about 18 months. My question for y'all (I am Texan) is have you heard anything about Aikido of Dallas, their instructor Bob Mason (3rd Dan) or their affiliations, United States Aikido Federation and the Midwest Aikido Federation. Any information you have is a help as Aikido is fast becoming the latest rage and it seems that half the Kayrahtee doejoes are now offering to teach Aikido, and I would not want her",

        "text": "If you want to know more about the USAF-- United States Aikido Federation, you can go to http://www.aikidoonline.com Click on dojo listings and the link to the USAF will come up. Once you get there you will see there are three regions, East, West and MidWest. Aikido of Dallas is in the midwest region.\n\nI'm from Florida and train with Florida Aikikai with Peter Bernath. I have been with Florida Aikikai for a year and a half and I have been very satisfied to the depth of knowledge of my instructors and the quality of instruction that I have received. The USAF is very reputable and so you can be assured its not some fly-by-night fad dojo. If you talk to the instructor and ask about his qualifications he should be more than willing to share them with you. If you want to verfiy which shihan he is affiliated with you should be able to find them listed on Aikido Online.\n\nIn the USAF there are three types of teaching licenses. Fukushidoin, assistant instructor; Shidoin, certified instructor; and Shihan, master instructor. (I'm not sure how these are awarded but the sensei at the school should) The rank of sandan is the last rank tested for in the USAF and any rank higher is administrative and relates to the sensei's contribution to the spread of aikido.\n\nAs far as the Midwest Aikido Federation. I'm not sure if that is a separate organization or just the branch of the USAF. Since I'm in Florida, we are part of the Eastern Division. If it is truely separate, once again, ask the sensei about it. Someone who is reputable should not be offended in you asking questions about what the nature and purpose of the Federation is.\n\nI hope that helps. If you have further questions, and want to hear from more experience aikidoka, go to http://www.aikiweb.com There is a great forums section and you should be able to get answers to your questions there.\n\nTake care,\n\nAnne Marie Giri\n\nDon Cunningham wrote:\n\nIf it is the same group that used to practice on Saturdays at Vince Tamura's judo school down near Bachman Lake, they are good people. I used to watch them practice after our judo classes many, many years ago.\n\nDon, and others,\n\nThe group which met at Tamura's still exists. They are now North Texas Aikido, and they have a dojo in Allen, Texas. As one of their students, I recommend them highly. You can see their website at\n\nwww.northtexasaikido.com\n\nIt is an Iwama style dojo, and the dojo-cho has spent time in Iwama with Saito sensei.\n\nI don't know enough about the other aikido schools in the Dallas area, but North Texas is worth a looksee, especially if you are already in the Plano area.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nPhil Hobson"
