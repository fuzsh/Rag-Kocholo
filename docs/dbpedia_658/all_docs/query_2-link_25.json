        "text": "In the final analysis, is the security dilemma inescapable? Or can the protagonists in world politics learn to live with never-ending insecurities and the risk of attack without producing precisely the outcomes that they wish to avoid? This article explores this fundamental problem for International Relations theory by performing a thought experiment, in which it applies lessons from aikido to world politics. A form of Japanese budo, or martial art, aikido provides practitioners with a method for harbouring insecurities, and for dealing with attacks that may or may not occur, by empathically caring for actual and potential attackers. The article builds on practice theory in assuming that any social order is constructed and internalised through practices, but also capable of change through the introduction and dissemination of new practices. Although an unlikely scenario, aikido practice could serve as such a method of fundamental transformation if widely applied in world politics. Empirical examples ranging from international apologies and security cooperation to foreign aid and peacekeeping operations are discussed, suggesting that contemporary world politics is at times already performed in accordance with aikido principles, albeit only imperfectly and partially.\n\nBackground. In Yugoslavia, after World War II, a new form of martial arts emerged from the aikido master Ljubomir Ljuba Vracarevic, known as real aikido. Problem and Aim. For Vracarevic, aikido was not enough, he wanted a martial art that was more realistic and unconcerned with the complex ethics of aikido. Thus, real aikido emerged as a new martial art and it gained numerous practitioners all over the world. Its masters spread real aikido with its highly applicable techniques combined with a questionable philosophy, resulting in them having a prominent role as security instructors for some of the top politicians around the world, such as Muammar al-Gaddafi and Robert Mugabe. However, even though real aikido emerged from aikido, it heavily vulgarised and brutalised its original techniques and ethics. Method. With a critical analysis of the works of the founder of real aikido and its comparison with the works of aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba, the ethical imbalance between real aikido and aikido is perceived. Furthermore, with analysis of the individual techniques (Irimi Nage) that are used in both martial arts the technical, and most importantly ethical difference, is distinguished within the individual techniques. Results and Conclusions. The differences between aikido and real aikido are extensive. In essence, real aikido invoked the dangerous techniques that Morihei Ueshiba forbid long ago. Thus, real aikido is a brutalised, vulgarised, and ethically ruined version of aikido. With the name aikido but without the ethical principles of aikido, real aikido produced a crisis in martial arts ethics, where the martial art and the philosophy of the founder, in this case aikido and Morihei Ueshiba, are misused and abused.\n\nBackground. The scientific framework is provided by the sociology and anthropology of martial arts, and by the Humanistic Theory of Martial Arts. The process should be viewed holistically, through the dimensions of time and context and the process of creation. Problem. The author describes the aikibudo discipline in Poland and sets out its short history over the last 30 years. He also considers what have been the dominant institutional changes. Method. The main methods are: sources analysis (documents and newspapers), and content analysis of scientific literature-a broad discourse. Results and Conclusions. Aikibudo in the CERA and FIAB versions, under the patronage of hanshi Alain Floquet, has been taught in Poland for 30 years. Some instructors have played the role of pioneers, others continue their work. Some practitioners from the 1990s are today practising other, related martial arts. Sensei Stanislaw Cynarski has achieved the hanshi title in aiki-jujutsu. The teaching of GM Flo...\n\nThis qualitative study delved into the multifaceted meaning of aikido through 20 expert interviews conducted worldwide in 2020. The interviewees were purposively selected and the analysis of the interview data identified five spectrum themes: 1) the spectrum of aikido practice ranges from soft to tough training style; 2) the aikido motivation spectrum moves from self-defence to self-transformation; 3) the spectrum of aikido in society shows the different social contexts in which aikido is practised from broader social applications to combating violence; 4) the spectrum of tangible values reveals the various material aspects of Japanese culture that experts adopt with degrees of japanization; finally, 5) the spectrum of intangible values shows how experts perceive the immaterial significance of aikido differently, ranging from linking it to religion to the absence of spirituality. The varied answers from the experts showed that aikido is a worldwide phenomenon with unique relationships between the expert and the martial art. The study concludes that the five spectrums of variation add to the discourse against simplifying aikido or other martial arts.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to discuss the origins and evolution of Self-Defence Forces as an institution within the Japanese constitutional system. The analysis also aims to provide answers to the question of the compatibility of Jietai with the Japanese Constitution and its formal status. In order to address the research problem, we have decided to dedicate the first part to issues related to the constitutional principles of pacifism and anti-militarism. It is followed by the description of the process that led to the formation of Japanese Self-Defence Forces. We decided that the turning point of the analysis is the appointment of Liberal Democratic Party's leader, Abe Shinzo, as the 96th Prime Minister of Japan (December 26, 2012). The reforms undertaken by the politician resulted in a rapid change in the character of Self-Defence Forces, putting an end to the hitherto functioning model of Jietai.\n\nThis paper is a reflection on aikido as a tool for teaching about elicitive conflict transformation and the larger field of peace and conflict studies. One of the central difficulties of teaching elicitive conflict transformation is that, as an adaptive and emergent method, it is non-prescriptive and therefore conventional didactics are inappropriate. The aim is to add to the existing corpus of literature on aikido and elicitve conflict transformation by combining the philosophical perspectives presented in this paper. The reflection builds on a comparison of Canadian First Nation's philosophy, the Japanese martial art aikido, and the Heideggerian term Verwindung as complementary philosophical approaches that can potentially deepen the understanding of elicitive conflict transformation. From the starting point of the Indigenous Canadian perspective from the Hesquiaht Nation, the term wiwikink' api' is introduced, which means 'fighting with no one. ' From there, aikido is presented as both a physical and spiritual practice that teaches non-aggression and balancing forces and it is compared to Verwindung. The three philosophical approaches have notable similarities that emphasize the core principles of elicitive conflict transformation: non-dualistic perception, self-awareness, and perpetual twisting. The final remarks draw parallels between these reflections and the state of the art of elicitive conflict transformation.\n\nThis paper engages with the question of the invention of martial arts by examining the case of the Japanese martial art aikido. Relying on existing schools of traditional martial arts, Morihei Ueshiba [1883-1969] created aikido with the goal of transforming techniques aiming at killing the opponent into techniques which could benefit both partners. Instead of becoming stronger than the opponent, the goal of aikido practice is to improve the individual’s behaviour during their physical interaction with their partner. The question I examine in this paper is how practitioners manifest such philosophy during their practice and through their embodied conduct. I focus specifically on how practitioners simulate a situation of conflict through semiotic structures [Goodwin 2000] through which they construct a world of movement in which anticipating the attacker’s movement becomes possible. Because practitioners are organized with such a framework, they can, through movements of the whole body, pacifically produce and resolve the situation of conflict. This study contributes to understanding how a practical philosophy is implemented within the practitioners’ bodies and is manifested during social interaction."
