The entries in the work are grounded on the perspective that Asian Americans are continuously (re)shaping their religious beliefs, practices, lifeways, communities, identities, and understanding of self in relation to others and the cosmos. The entries also reveal a transnational relationship, historically and in the present moment, between and among Asians and Asian Americans, Asian religions and their manifold manifestations in the United States, and their influence in and contribution to the American mosaic. Contributors to these volumes are faith practitioners, religious leaders, community elders, and academics who bridge the emic-etic division in the study of religions to provide a complete kaleidoscopic presentation of Asian American religious cultures. The volumes include 19 alphabetically arranged thematic essays on topics that cover theories and methods, and critical topics in the study of Asian American religious cultures. Each of the more than 200 individual entries, like each thematic essay, concludes with a bibliography of additional print or electronic information resources and a listing of cross-references to related entries in a “See also” line at the end of the entry text. A Guide to Related Topics breaks the essays and entries into topic categories that trace broad ideas and themes across the two volumes. These volumes also offer a general introduction placing the topic of the encyclopedia into broad historical context, a select bibliography of important general information resources, and a detailed subject index. The essays and entries were authored by over 100 contributors, the majority with advanced graduate degrees, or people of faith who wanted to share their religious communities with a wider audience. While we employ the panethnic umbrella classification of “Asian American,” we acknowledge the competing, more “inclusive” categories of “Asian Pacific American” or “Asian Pacific Islander,” which include the diverse Pacific Islander ethno-religious communities and faith traditions. “Asian Pacific American” and xiii\n\nxiv Preface\n\n“Asian Pacific Islander” are controversial panethnic classifications; together with “Asian American” none of the panethnic references are accepted wholeheartedly by the folks that these three classifications wish to embrace. Although there are entries that represent Pacific Islander religious cultures, we include them with the expressed awareness that many wish—taxonomically—to divorce Asian Americans from Pacific Islanders as an ideological, political, economic, and social discourse. We support the right of Pacific Islanders to self-determination and look forward to the future when Pacific Islander studies develop into an autonomous discipline, and when panethnic umbrella classifications are no longer considered progressive. We also support the wish of Pacific Islanders to not be subsumed under the umbrella category of “Asian Pacific” American. We hope we do not offend our Pacific Islander allies by including coverage of Pacific Islander religious cultures in these volumes. We do so humbly, respectfully, and with utmost care. This project could easily be doubled, if not tripled in size—there are many topics that we wished to include, but could not do so because we could not locate a qualified specialist. This tells us that there is a need for more studies on Asian American religious cultures, which we hope these volumes will assist in promoting. Although the field of Asian American religious studies has seen healthy growth since the 1990s, much more work is needed to document the rich, diverse, and dynamic histories, developments, and transformations of the religious cultures of Asian Americans. The volumes of Asian American Religious Cultures constitute a drop in the bucket for what is yet to come.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe all wish to acknowledge all the contributors who have made these volumes enriching and encompassing. In addition, we all wish to thank our families for their continued support and understanding, as well as acknowledge our respect and gratitude for one another. We extend appreciation especially to devotees of the respective faith traditions, who, in addition to sharing their most cherished beliefs, voiced their deepest yearnings and highest aspirations. We also wish to acknowledge the early contribution of Jane Naomi Iwamura, who used her social and academic connections to bring in contributors. Jonathan H. X. Lee wishes to thank the College of Ethnic Studies at San Francisco State University for funding that provided time to work on this project. Lee also wishes to acknowledge support from his students and colleagues in the Asian American Studies Department, and his research assistant, Sidney C. Li.\n\nxv\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction\n\n“Asian American” refers to an American—both foreign and American born—of Asian descent. The term “Asia” was derived from the Greek word Asianos, which some scholars believe originated from the Assyrians who used the word asu to mean “east”: the first occurrence or origin of this word would date back to 1000 BCE if not earlier. The ancient Greeks used this term to designate an area east of the principal Greek world. The expression came to embrace a greater geological area when Alexander the Great (356–323 BCE) began his wars against the Persian Empire. Subsequently, the Romans used the term “Asia” to include the lands given to them by Attalus III in 133 BCE. In short, “Asia” was invented by the ancient Greeks and Romans, and expanded by Western geographers to include the land mass east of the Ural Mountains and Ural River, even extending to Japan and Java. Within this vast region there is no common “Asian” culture. It is this distinct diversity and heterogeneity that makes studying Asian American religious cultures dynamic. As an overarching designation, as a reference, and as a category “Asian American” is, therefore, composed of many groups differing in national origin, ethnicity, language, and length of residence in the United States.\n\nAsian American Religious Landscapes Demographically speaking, East Asian Americans (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) and Vietnamese are formed by Mahāyāna Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, and Christianity. Southeast Asian Americans (Cambodian, Laotian, Thai, Burmese, and so forth) identify more with Theravāda Buddhism. While South Asian Americans are largely Hindu, among this group are many Jains, Zoroastrians, Muslims, Sikhs, and Orthodox Christians. Pakistanis and Afghans are predominantly Muslim. Pacific Islanders and Filipinos have very high Christian affiliation, the latter predominantly Roman Catholic. The tremendous growth and diversity of Asian Americans today is largely a result of the Hart-Celler Act of 1965 that liberalized U.S. immigration policy. This act sets the dividing line between two waves of Asian American immigration. xvii\n\nxviii Introduction\n\nFirst Wave. The landscape of Asian American religions is closely tied with the geopolitical history of Asian America and Oceania. The settlement of Asian Americans first occurred in 1763 with the establishment of a community by Chinese and Filipinos in Louisiana. Some American Protestant churches recruited Native Hawaiians and Chinese immigrants to be sent to their homelands for mission purposes. These churches also assisted the U.S. government and U.S. companies in the promotion of a capitalistic and colonial system of government and commerce in Hawai‘i and Asia. At the same time, Asian Americans also relied on religions to survive in the harsh environment of the new land and to maintain their dignity. The result was cultural blending among Asian American religious groups. In Hawai‘i the native Hawaiians and Asian immigrants accepted the Christianity that was introduced by Protestant Congregationalist churches in the mid-19th century. At the same time, they also brought into their new faith the non-Christian religious practices and values of their background. The early Asian American Protestants in Hawai‘i brought with them a strong nationalism. Hostility toward Asian immigrants steadily grew in the United States. The Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), the proscription of Japanese, Indian Asian, and all Asian immigration (1924), and the immigration ban on Filipinos (1934) effectively closed the door to Asian migration. In 1870, Asian immigrants were deemed ineligible for American citizenship. The Cable Act of 1922 revoked the citizenship of any American woman who married an alien ineligible for citizenship. The following year, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the alien land laws of several western states that denied aliens ineligible for citizenship the right to own property. An estimated 120,000 Japanese nationals and Japanese Americans were placed in internment camps during World War II. The Chinese Exclusion Act was finally repealed in 1943, but many discriminatory laws remained in effect during the middle decades of the 20th century. In spite of the hostile and discriminatory environment in which Asian immigrants had to live and work, remarkably, they were able to contribute to U.S. society in many ways. The early Asian immigrants strived toward better working conditions and fought against racial discrimination. Japanese Americans sacrificed their lives as U.S. soldiers during World War II despite their families being placed in internment camps. Religions played a significant role in Asian Americans’ efforts to be solid members of U.S. society. In addition to those who joined Protestant churches in Hawai‘i and the American West, the early immigrants created and maintained their own faith organizations. The Buddhist Church of America, for example, rooted in Jōdo Shinshū (Pure Land) Buddhism in Japan, is the predominant tradition among Japanese Americans in the continental United States and Hawai‘i. Chinese Americans established numerous temples and shrines in 12 states. The first Asian Indian immigrants from Punjabi built a Sikh gurdwara\n\nIntroduction\n\nin Stockton, California, in 1915. Filipino immigrants, predominantly Catholic, established various social organizations in the continental United States and Hawai‘i, and other Pacific Islanders have undergone tremendous religious transformations. Christian mission schools improved literacy and brought Westernization. Protestantism became the dominant religion of Hawaiians by the end of the 19th century (Roman Catholicism became dominant in Guam and Tahiti). Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Christianity, however, creatively blended indigenous traditions with Christianity even while professing orthodox Christian commitments. Second Wave. The religious landscape of Asian Americans has become more diverse and complicated since the Immigration and Nationality Act (Hart-Celler Act) of 1965. The number of those who embrace non-Abrahamic faiths has increased greatly, particularly Buddhists and Hindus. According to Pew Research, Buddhists and Hindus today account for roughly the same share of the U.S. public as Jews (roughly 2 percent). Most Asian Americans belong to the two largest U.S. religious groups: Christians and those who have no particular religious affiliation. Asian American adult Christians occupy 42 percent, whereas the unaffiliated Asian Americans are 26 percent. The third largest group is Buddhists, roughly one in seven Asian Americans (14 percent), followed by Hindus (10 percent), Muslims (4 percent), and Sikhs (1 percent). Those who profess other religions make up 2 percent of Asian Americans. Each of the six largest Asian American ethnic groups contributes to the complexity of religious affiliations. Filipinos are largely Catholic, Koreans tend to be Protestant. Approximately half of Indian Americans are Hindu; half of Chinese Americans are unaffiliated. Japanese Americans are a mix of Christians, Buddhists, devotees of new religions, and the unaffiliated. Vietnamese Americans tend to belong to various traditions of Buddhism. Therefore, religious cultures in Asian American communities are an equally complex affair and include all the major world faith traditions, as well as new religious movements (e.g., Soka Gakkai, Falun Gong, Caodai) and folk religions. Given the countless variations that exist, Asian Americans must be viewed as a group whose identity is necessarily heterogeneous, hybrid, and multiple. Very few assumptions can be made about Asian Americans’ religious affiliations, and attention must be paid to the sociohistorical differences that are the hallmark of Asian American religious cultures.\n\nWords Matter: “Religion” and/or “Spirituality” The expressions “religion” and “spirituality” have been a major difficulty in compiling and editing this encyclopedia. The current dictionary definitions of “religion” are fashioned to encompass the variety of cultural and world views concerning the meaning and purpose of human life. These definitions primarily reflect\n\nxix\n\nxx Introduction\n\ncurrent Western perceptions of what constitutes a faith tradition, namely a written canon that articulates its beliefs, an institution that gives form to its yearnings and aspirations, and a priesthood that transmits its beliefs and aspirations by living and sharing its ideals. “Religion” also encompasses doctrines, values, rituals, and the arts. As a conceptual template “religion,” derived from the Latin religiō, refers to a covenant that entails obligations between individuals and communities and their God, a mutuality that is fundamental to Abrahamic faith traditions. But Anthony C. Yu, Julia Ching, and others have expressed reservations about the appropriateness of this notion of “religion” to a tradition like shamanism, for example, that is bereft of an institution or a canon or priesthood; or to Confucianism that has a canon, but without a highly structured organized institution and an ordained priesthood. While the Buddhist tradition has a canon, institution, and priesthood, it does not posit a personality—god or divinity—with whom the devotee can establish a covenant. Additionally, objections have been raised. “Religion” and its adjectival “religious” give form to codified beliefs and expression, and do not account for the full range of the ineffable aspects of the human experience. In their stead, “spirituality” and its adjectival “spiritual” have emerged as alternative expressions in research, clinical settings, and reflection. Thus, in an effort to lend some clarity, the following paragraphs review the expressions “religion” and “spirituality” and a few of their respective implications in the lives of Asian Americans and their communities. “Spiritual” and “Spirituality.” The expressions “spiritual” and “spirituality,” in contrast with “religion” and “religious,” are more fundamental and expansive. The Latin root spīritus means “to breathe”; it refers to the vital principle or animating force that quickens sentiency and life. The importance of “breath as life” or “lifebreath” is evident in early Indian earth deity yaksha and yakshi sculptures with their inflated lower abdomens, a motif that appears in South and Southeast Asian Buddhist sculpture. The notion present in the Old Testament and Babylonian myths also appears as qi in Daoist and Confucian thought. “Spiritual” and “spirituality” accommodate a variety of faith traditions and personal experiences that address concerns that animate life, more specifically the human experience. As a concept “spirituality” is a hermeneutic bridge between Christianity and its varied denominations and nontheistic faith traditions. “Spirituality,” for example, can accommodate the nontheistic Confucian-inspired understanding vision of reality, including aging and old age, that inspire and give meaning and purpose to future elders. This distinction was not lost to the early Catholic missionaries, who questioned whether Confucianism can be correctly labeled a “religion.” During the late 19th and 20th centuries, Chinese intellectuals, who considered “religion” to be superstition, thought Confucianism to be a philosophy, a view that is still held in the People’s Republic of China.\n\nIntroduction\n\n“Spiritual” and “spirituality” are appropriate for shamanic experiences that have no formal institutions and are also applicable to the absence of a self-conscious and independent “self” in traditional Polynesian cultures, where an individual’s identity is determined by his or her place in the family lineage, community, and the natural world. Within the Samoan-Polynesian context, for example, “spirituality” is a communal experience that is guided by a shared vision of the world—seen and unseen—that is manifested through a lifestyle and affirmed through ritual, architecture, the arts, and other modalities. Intriguingly, pre-European-contact Samoans did not build places of worship or give form to Tagaloa, their highest deity; rather, the sacred was and still is embodied in vā tapuia, the covenantal relationships between and among people and with the natural world. “Spiritual” also embraces mystical experiences within a tradition and outside its confines. As noted in the essay on “Spirituality,” the authors of The Study of Spirituality traced the expression to the 15th- and 16th-century European Christians who were interested in transcendental mystical experiences. These experiences were pursued primarily by clerics through established communal practices and supported by theology. Lay seekers, in contrast, cultivated these quests through individual avenues outside the established formats, moving beyond the confines of “religion” and its institutional notions of faith and meaning. These explorations allowed for the experience of alternative realities, practices, beliefs, and spiritualities. There can be as many “spiritualities” as there are “spiritual” persons. The proliferation of “private spiritualities” and their accompanying experiences give rise to many academic and practical questions. This is not to say that “private spiritualities” are any less genuine; personal experiences are meaningful. Appreciated only by the individual and perhaps by a few of his or her cohorts, the absence of coherent doctrinal support, a shared ritual expression, and the gravitas of history, “private spiritualities” are suspect. How can the validity of an inner or transcendental experience be ascertained? Another question pertains to the method or methods that lead to an “authentic” experience. Are individual methods universally applicable? These and other questions are beyond the scope of this introduction. In addition, “private spiritualities” pose many problems for caregivers and caregiving facilities. Without shared cohort experiences, activity directors struggle to plan meaningful programs.\n\nAsian American History, Religion, and Race The racial landscape of the United States has profoundly changed since the enactment of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Hart-Celler Act) of 1965 that abolished the previous national origins formula. This landmark act opened the door to immigrants from previously restricted regions of the world such as Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The Latin American population in the United States also\n\nxxi\n\nxxii Introduction\n\nincreased dramatically even though such an increase was not intended by this act. By the 1990s, the U.S. population had grown more than one-third, driven by both legal and illegal immigration. Ethnic and racial minorities, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, rose from 25 percent of the U.S. population during the year 1990 to 30 percent in the year 2000 and then to 36.6 percent in 2010. The Census Bureau estimated in 2012 that nonwhite groups, led by Hispanic Americans, black Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and Pacific Islander Americans would together outnumber non-Hispanic white Americans by the decade of 2040. Most of the growth is taking place in major metropolitan areas such as Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The concentration of populations in these areas is already having a major impact on local as well as national politics and foreshadows the future of American race relations. The shift in the population makeup of the United States is also impacting the religious landscape as well. Race as Positioning. The definition and meaning of race have been changing in accordance with the demographic change of the U.S. population impacting Asian Americans. The Americans of Asian descent alone increased by 43 percent from 2000 to 2010 and the Asian Americans-in-combination population grew 46 percent during the same period. These populations grew more than any other American race group during the period. The multiple-race Asian American population also experienced considerable growth, increasingly by 60 percent. The 2010 U.S. Census reports that leading this growth was the Asian and white population, which grew by 87 percent. The report also highlighted results for “detailed” Asian groups, indicating that the Chinese American population was the largest detailed group. For the Asian alone-or-in-any combination population, Filipinos and Asian Indians were the second- and third-largest detailed Asian groups. Another noted finding is that among the detailed Asian groups with alone-or-in-any-combination populations of one million or more, the Japanese population had the highest proportion that identified with multiple detailed Asian groups and/or another race(s) (41 percent). After Japanese, Filipinos had the next highest proportion of respondents who identified with multiple detailed Asian groups and/or another race(s) (25 percent). This rapidly changing racial landscape of Asian Americans caused some scholars to suggest that Asian American racial identity is increasingly “heterogeneous, hybrid, and multiple.” Lisa Lowe says this fluid and complex picture of racial identity of Asian Americans is “not the ‘free’ oscillation between or among chosen identities.” Rather, it “is the uneven process through which immigrant communities encounter the violence of the US state, and the capital imperatives served by the United States and by the Asian states from which they come, and the process through which they survive this violence by living, inventing, and\n\nIntroduction\n\nreproducing different cultural alternatives.” In other words, a fixed notion of racial identity is illusionary today. Racial identity for Asian Americans is not a stable essence but a positioning, manifesting itself in politics at local, regional, national, and transnational levels. Racism: A Contradictory Struggle for Membership in U.S. Society. Despite the rapid increase in the variety of racial and ethnic populations largely resulting from the enactment of the 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act as well as the Civil Rights Act of the same year, what is persistent is racial discrimination and racism. Asian Americans along with people of other racial groups are consistently subject to racism even in the present time. Race for Asian Americans is indispensably related to their experiences of racism. Racism manifests itself in various levels of politics. Lowe says, “the history of the nation’s attempt to resolve the contradictions between its economic and political imperative through laws that excluded Asians from citizenship—from 1790 until the 1940s—contributes to our general understanding of race as a contradictory site of struggle for cultural, economic, as well as political membership in the United States.” Michael Omi and Howard Winant also make a similar point in their book Racial Formation in the United States. Racism is furthermore exacerbated by the often assumed notion of being “American” as being “white.” This assumption is a sociological construct in which people from diverse European backgrounds were assimilated into an identity that conferred privilege and segregated their poor members from nonwhites. Because “whiteness” became so firmly rooted in the American subconsciousness, even many well-intentioned Euro-American civil rights activists could not see that their visions of an integrated society meant conformity to these “norms.” “America represented liminality,” says historian Ronald Takaki. Asian immigrants in their journey across the Pacific Ocean crossed boundaries that are not delineated in space. These immigrants were placed in the ambiguous and unfamiliar situation betwixt and between anything familiar and comfortable points of reference. They found themselves in a marginal place culturally and religiously as well as geographically where they could also experiment and improvise something anew. Burdened by racism, nevertheless, Asian immigrants created a pattern of life beyond the familiar and traditional and paved the way for the present-day life of Asian Americans that is fluid, complex, and contradictory to the often assumed norms of white Americans. And yet, the present-day Asian Americans continue to bear the historical stigma of “strangers from a different shore.” Simultaneously, the myth of the “model minority” still persists. Asian American Race and Religion. The religious lives of Asian Americans are closely tied to the demographic shifts taking place in the United States and the\n\nxxiii\n\nxxiv Introduction\n\ncomplexity of what constitutes “Asian Americans.” Race, ethnicity, cultural identities, and the historical predominance of Christianity are the key factors to be considered in order to describe Asian American religions. For Asian Americans the term “religion” is not readily agreed upon. For the purpose of the introductory chapter of this encyclopedia, the term “religion” is used to describe what is commonly termed “institutionalized religion” embraced by Asian Americans, both the new immigrants and those who have lived in this land over several generations. However, this description itself is subject to debate just as the terms “Asian Americans” and “race” cannot be singularly defined. For one thing, the borders and boundaries of “religions” are constantly remade among and within Asian American institutionalized religions. Unlike the Abrahamic theistic religious traditions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), many of the Asian American “religions” are nontheistic. Therefore, a relatively clear boundary set among the Abrahamic traditions does not describe the state of the religious experiences of many Asian Americans. This is to say that the epistemological framework used by the traditional study of comparative religions in the West is not helpful to understand Asian Americans’ religions and religious experiences. There are Asian American “Buddhist-Christians,” just as in the case of other institutional religions. The formative experiences of religions by the first wave of Asian immigrants upon those who are born later are likely to leave a deep impression for what is the self-understanding and confession of the current generation Asian Americans. Conversion is not the only means of embracing a new faith for Asian Americans. The familial religious experiences and the cumulative traditions are just as powerful as their embracing a new faith that often originates in the European American religions. Furthermore, Asian American religious institutions of immigrants tend to emphasize doing rather than believing, that is, doing of ritual, worship attendance, and charity, whereas the offspring of immigrants are influenced by the American culture of radical individualism and often experience religion as authentic selfexpression and religious community as a locus of identity politics. Timothy Tseng notes that the “neglect of Asian American religions throughout much of the twentieth century was due, in part, to the concentration of Asian Americans in the American West, a region that has only recently engaged the attention of American historians.”\n\n“Asian Americans: A Mosaic of Faiths”—Pew Research Religion & Public Life Project The second wave of the Asian American religious scene is indeed distinct among all the religious groups in the United States. One distinct mark of Asian Americans is that they are more religiously diverse than the U.S. population. Americans in\n\nIntroduction\n\ngeneral are overwhelmingly Christian (75 percent). There are substantial differences in religious affiliation among Asian Americans. Those who are unaffiliated tend to express lower levels of religious commitment than unaffiliated Americans in the general public. Seventy-six percent say religion is not very important or not at all important in their lives, compared with 58 percent among unaffiliated U.S. adults as a whole. However, evangelical Protestants among Asian Americans rank among the most religious groups in the United States, going beyond white evangelicals in weekly church attendance (76 percent vs. 64 percent). The second wave of Asian American religion points to wide variations within the highly diverse Asian American population. There are many differences among Asian Americans about the importance of religion in their lives. Asian American Buddhists and Asian American Hindus are much less inclined than Asian American Christians to say that religion plays a very important role in their lives. The percentage of Asian American Buddhists who say they believe in God or a universal spirit is 71 percent compared to those nonBuddhist Asian Americans (80 percent) and the U.S. public (92 percent). The number of Asian American Christians who attend religious services occasionally or regularly is higher than for Asian American Buddhists and Hindus, but many of the Buddhists and Hindus report that they maintain religious shrines in their homes. Sociological studies of second-wave Asian American religions have increased markedly in the past 20 years. These are influenced by racialization, postcolonial, diasporic, and transnational theories. A number of studies of intergenerational transition or second-generation Asian American religions have also been published very recently. Collectively, they provide a wealth of data for historians of Asian American religions. Nevertheless, there have been very few historical studies of the second-wave communities. Historians can contribute to the study of secondwave Asian American religions by emphasizing continuity and change in religious communities and organizations as well as developing biographical studies of significant individuals. They can also highlight the interactions of these communities with broader American, Asian, and, indeed, global historic movements and contexts. Finally, they can offer comparative frameworks that help track the similarities and differences among second-wave Asian American religious communities. Historical research on Asian American religions holds great promise. Finally, it is worth speaking about those Asian Americans who seem to have no religious affiliation at all. Asian Americans are twice as likely to describe themselves as “secular” in comparison with members of other racial-ethnic groups. This is not surprising. Other factors aside, “religion” is a more alien concept, that is, less intuitive, for many Asian Americans, especially those of the immigrant generation, than it is for the majority of the American public. Americans usually conceive of religion as an allegiance to a particular faith, a belief in God or a similar higher power, or something that is dependent on regular church attendance. Religion and\n\nxxv\n\nxxvi Introduction\n\nspirituality in Asia, and by extension, Asian America, often fits none of these requirements. Asian American religiosity, by its very nature, is syncretic and draws from folk stories, cultural beliefs, community wisdom, and personal invention as well as from the various faith traditions. It is difficult for certain Asian American religious practitioners (such as Hmong, Buddhists, and Hindus) to envision an anthropomorphized, all-powerful God with whom one has a personal relationship. And for many Asian Americans, spirituality is philosophically informed (such as in Confucianism), rather than divinely inspired, and religious faith is often indistinguishable from secular interests. Hence, understanding religion among Asian Americans requires a new lens— one that takes into account the porosity of Asian American life. Instead of the term “religion,” which does not fully capture the richness of an Asian American spiritual sensibility, it is perhaps better to conceive of Asian American religions as “spiritual cultures” in which the sacred takes more fluid and unconventional forms. Through this new lens, we might be better able to see, appreciate, understand, and analyze what continues to serve as the main sources of spiritual strength (the significance of family, food, and community gatherings, for example) and spiritual witness (Asian American arts and literature, storytelling, clothes, and the like) and to discern the lively traces of religious presence that the lives of Asian Americans elegantly bear.\n\nAsian American Religious Studies and Asian American Studies Matter(s) According to the 2012 (revised and updated in 2013) Pew Research Center report, “The Rise of Asian Americans,” Asian Americans are the “fastest-growing racial group in the United States.” Asian American religions and religiosities can be taught as a stand-alone course, or as a part of other courses, specifically Introduction to World Religions, which takes a diasporic approach and emphasizes religious encounters. Religious Studies and Asian American Studies are both inherently interdisciplinary and multi-methodological disciplines. Both disciplines pay careful consideration to emic-etic boundaries. However, Asian American Studies promotes and condones experimentation with personal experience in research and teaching. It is important to note that the history of Asian American Studies as an academic discipline is relatively short: 45 years. Asian American Studies was born on March 20, 1969, when a contract was signed at San Francisco State College (now University) to establish the country’s first and still only School (now College) of Ethnic Studies. This was one of the results of the Third World Liberation Front strike that began on November 6, 1968. This legacy informs Asian American Studies’ raison d’être—its pedagogy and research—inside and outside of the class-\n\nIntroduction\n\nroom. Asian American Studies is founded on the dual principles of self-determination and social justice. Asian American self-determination is expressed—individually and collectively—from the demand of Asian American subjectivity, as knowing Asian Americans through history, art, literature, social sciences, and education, but also as subjects of research. Early on, a penchant for Marxian revolutionary class critique of Asian American Studies during this period ignored questions of religions and religious beliefs. However, the quotidian experiences of Asian Americans revealed a deep enchantment with religion. The study of Asian American religions and religiosities gained momentum in 1996, when Amerasia Journal published the first special issue on Asian American religions. Eighteen years later, the legacy of that first special issue is incontestable as the field of Asian American religious studies has grown, as indicated by the incorporation of the Asian North American Religion and Society Group at the American Academy of Religion, and the development of the Asian Pacific American Religions Research Initiative, not to mention the growing single-authored and -edited volumes dealing with Asian American religiosities. Since the birth of Asian American Studies, matters of subjectivity are still central to Asian American lives—inside and outside of academe. In particular, many Asian American youth express frustration with their inability to articulate— clearly and decisively—their entanglement with existential questions about their subjectivity apropos their ethnic, national, religious, and cultural self-awareness. Asian American students must also reconcile their identity against popular racialized stereotypes of Asian Americans as “model minorities” who are math and science wizards, or Asian American women as submissive yet hypersexual dragon ladies, and Asian American men as submissive and asexual or effeminate. As teachers and students who study Asian religions in America, one must temper the inclination to Orientalize the subjects and their religiosities. This perennial tussle with self-awareness, being, existence, and form is a central matter of subjectivity. Subjectivity mattered then, and it matters today, and will matter in the future. The study of Asian American religions and religiosities offers fertile ground for explorations of Asian American subjectivity that is a primary concern for Asian American students who grow up American. Besides the focus on Asian American subjects, Asian American Studies provides a model to examine different constructions of the “Oriental” as a means to recognize larger systems of power and hierarchy. It is grounded in postcolonial methodologies, discursive analysis, and allows the observed to become observers. More importantly, Asian American Studies is founded on a social justice praxis that celebrates scholars who are also activists. Asian American Studies provides a theoretical and methodological approach for emancipatory teaching and learning that puts, at the center of study, voices of subjects historically marginalized and starts with the premise that education is political by nature. At this juncture, critical consciousness is possible, or as Kathleen Weiler\n\nxxvii\n\nxxviii Introduction\n\nsays, coming to a realization of “consciousness of oppression” requires a commitment to end oppression. When Religious Studies intersects with Asian American Studies, there are potentials and problems. Religion is not examined as a priori, just as race is not innately biological. Both religion and race are examined as historical social constructions. Religion and race intersect in people’s lives and inform their perceptions of the world and how they live, interact, and learn. The merger of Asian American Studies with Religious Studies allows for teaching and learning that focuses on the lived experiences of Asian Americans and requires that Asian American religiosity be investigated in relation to political, social, economic, and historical forces: religion is embedded in everyday life and experience. Asian American Studies scholars and students who study religion will be challenged to observe epoché (suspension of judgment), with the radical belief that one’s life experience and background are important to their academic work, which is guided by a social justice praxis that seeks to improve the community and the lives of people in them.\n\nCoda Finally, how do we envision Asian American religious cultures? The sheer diversity of ethnic communities and religious traditions that fall under the rubric of “Asian American” make the landscape of religious cultures quite chaotic. The epistemological differences in defining religion and culture among different faith traditions further complicate an analysis of the religious landscape. However, this much can be said: the study of Asian American religious cultures is inextricably bound to the material contexts of labor, racism, stereotyping, and social history. Asian American religious cultures refuse to be subsumed under the dominant methods and approaches of either religious studies or Asian American studies as they have developed. As such, the study of Asian American religious cultures needs to acknowledge the constellation of relationships among colonialism, marginality, liminality, and “amphiboly.” The study is not simply “theological” but what Bernard Faure terms “performative” scholarship where the object of study “to project its structures onto the theoretical approach” as a way to avoid closing off other, new ways of viewing religion. “Ultimately, revealing is always hiding; any insight generates its own blindness; any deconstruction is always already a reconstruction.” Jonathan H.

This essay focuses on the hybridity that is employed and expressed among Asian American artists, highlighting individual artists with unique styles, missions, and histories. It is important to mention some of the major events that shape arts and cultural production among Asian Americans. The process of migration transforms and transplants the arts from other countries. Some immigration factors that affect the arts are origin, destination, age of immigrants, time period, means (e.g., by invitation, physical displacement, and Asian funding), status (e.g., undocumented, transnational, and refugee), and duration or periodicity of immigration (e.g., temporary work and forced exile). Take a brief illustrative comparison: Shuye Sonoda was a Japanese Buddhist missionary, funded by Japanese and Japanese American organizations to proselytize to the United States, who arrived in 1898 without the possibility of gaining American citizenship; M.I.A. is a transnational Sri Lankan, a popular hip-hop artist who maintains homes in several countries, including the United States, and who is not currently an American citizen. Events that affect the relationship of the United States to Asian countries include war, economic globalization, and ideological conflicts, and this relationship shapes the American popular image of the countries of origin. This image varies by time period and region in the United States and\n\nArts and Cultural Production Asian American artists create complex and multilayered art because of their multilayered histories and hybrid cultures. In the United States and its territories, Asian Americans have consciously chosen parts of their cultures to preserve and parts of other cultures to adopt. These changes reflect the variety of cultures, political contexts, and religions in Asia as well as in the\n\nM.I.A. attends the Elle Style Awards 2015 at Sky Garden at The Walkie Talkie Tower on February 24, 2015, in London, England. (David M. Benett/Getty Images)\n\n3\n\n4 Arts and Cultural Production\n\naffects the reception of arts and religion linked to that country. An open question regarding Asian American arts and cultural production is whether the produced art is a product of latent Orientalism or peripheral Orientalism. This is a question of the means of production (how are arts produced and for what socioeconomic benefit) and a question of cultural authenticity. This essay describes some influences on the arts—personal, cultural, economic, discursive, and regional— without assessing the amount of Orientalist influence. In this essay, arts are categorized according to how they relate to the body. This categorization more clearly illustrates the arts that influence each other, both within each category and across categories. For the purpose of this essay, an art is considered any practice that is cultivated and passed on and any product that appeals to aesthetics.\n\nInternal Arts The internal arts cultivate the body and mind. Meditative arts are practiced by many groups and often reflect religious heritages. For example, sitting meditation, or zazen, is a form of Chinese and Japanese Chan and Zen Buddhist meditation taught to Asian American and non-Asian convert Buddhists. Vipassanā meditation is frequently practiced in countries where Theravāda Buddhism is prevalent such as in Sri Lanka and Thailand. Buddhists who teach these arts come from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds, such as welleducated Japanese and refugee Vietnamese Buddhists. In addition, non–Asian Ameri-\n\ncan Buddhists often sponsor teachers from Asia to teach in the United States. In a Buddhist context these arts teach one not to accumulate karma, which ties one to the cycles of rebirth, in addition to teaching concentration, awareness, clarity of thought, and mental relaxation. Meditative arts are frequently taught in Buddhist temples and “wellness” programs. Another popular internal art is hatha yoga. Hatha yoga is from India and comes to the United States in similar ways as the Buddhist meditative arts. In a Hindu context, hatha yoga is the physical exercises that help one to reach higher mental and spiritual states of being, and hence it is united with meditation, spiritual education, and medicine. Outside of the Hindu context, yoga is considered an exercise that helps to develop mental awareness, spiritual knowledge, and wisdom.\n\nBody Art Body art is done to the skin and other parts of the body, such as the ears, mouth, and tongue. In traditional contexts, body art is often part of rituals, such as puberty rites and warrior commendations. Important to its significance is the pain that the body endures while making the art. Some body art takes multiple sessions to complete and the body often requires time to heal. For example, in traditional Filipino culture, one tattoo illustrates a young woman’s ability to withstand the pain of childbirth. The art also represents the body artist—his or her artistic and religious lineage—and thus the art connects the recipient of body art to an artistic and religious community. In these ways, body art is part of oral\n\nculture; it is a symbol that can be used to recite personal and cultural history. Outside of traditional contexts, body art retains the connection to oral culture with its ability to incite the telling of one’s personal story. However, because it takes place outside of traditional gift exchange, the relationship of artist to recipient is closer to a client relationship than a traditional master–disciple relationship. For this reason, getting body art can come from an individual’s choice to externalize the emotions of a life transition. Similarly, the style of body art represents an individual’s choice to connect to a particular culture, and in some cases this is a reconnection to the individual’s own culture or to a culture lost in the process of colonialism. Some people get body art that is not from their own culture to represent their sense of connection to other cultures. Similarly, contemporary tattoo artists create decon­­ textualized art to connect to modern culture and new senses of self. For example, Hawai‘i-born Filipino American Leo Zulueta is well known for his “tribal style” tattoos that use traditional Polynesian lines in large modern shapes. Also involved in body art is the technology of creating the art. The artist may use traditional instruments to remain close to the traditional process or may use new technology to be more contemporary. Some contemporary tattoo technology can make the tattoo lines cleaner and appear more modern. In addition, new technology leads to new possibilities for body alteration.\n\nArts in Everyday Ritual This category spans the arts that are practiced routinely to maintain a sense of\n\nArts and Cultural Production\n\n5\n\ncommunity and family. For artistic families, all of the arts mentioned in this essay may be part of family tradition, but this category is meant to encompass “common arts.” For example, many practice Asian religious rituals in the home. These rituals may involve the creation and maintenance of altars, the recitation of sacred stories, dancing, adopting sacred postures, wearing cultural clothing, and cooking special foods. In many Japanese American homes, there are Buddhist and Shintō altars that require daily offerings of food and flowers and the recitation of mantras (sacred verses). This practice is an art in itself, but also requires more intricate items created by Japanese American artists. Woodworkers create the wooden altars and figurines, weavers create the clothing, and chefs create the desserts and other offerings. Vietnamese American Catholics often have altars in their homes, and worshipping at these altars can connect them to the daily routines of their families in other countries, which may foster a sense of closeness to them. Many of the items for Catholic altars can be purchased from artists of non–Asian American descent because other Catholic groups create and sell them. Some Asian American Protestant Christians practice Bible readings, and these meetings often involve traditions of reciting scripture, interpreting the stories of scripture in the context of one’s own life story, creating sacred and communal food, and singing Christian songs. These arts in everyday rituals have been used to create signature styles. For example, Japanese American origami artist Linda Mihara, well known for her connected crane art, has combined her family’s origami tradition with her fashion experience\n\n6 Arts and Cultural Production\n\nto create Japanese-style dresses made of folded paper.\n\nMartial Arts The martial arts are those that train the body to connect the mind to the body to experience life fully. The traditions of training and coping with violence can be highly ritualized and stylized. These may be linked to religion, such as training to embody the personality and agility of spirits, and commemorating deceased warriors with religious rituals and symbols. The public aspects of the rituals are linked to\n\nacting because the martial arts train the body for public display and can include performing mythology. Martial arts are also related to body art because the completion of training may lead to a rite of passage that includes body art, and the symbols of valor and pain endurance can make demonstrations of prowess more intimidating. The private practices of martial arts are often linked to the internal arts, such as those that maintain health and those that maintain mental clarity. Implicit throughout the martial arts are ethics and proper conduct. This can be seen in combat rules and combat etiquette as well as\n\nDomo owner and Aikido¯ instructor Gaku Homma Sensei flips an advanced Aikido¯ student during a seniors class he teaches at his Aikido¯ center, adjacent to his restaurant in Denver, March 24, 2014. Homma has shaped the Domo into a place where you can immerse yourself in Japanese culture, by visiting a museum that evokes a northern Japanese farmhouse, strolling in a garden studded with Buddha statues, or even taking a martial arts class in the converted former warehouse where the restaurant compound is located. Homma uses the profits not to enrich himself financially, but instead funds orphanages around the world. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley)\n\nmore broadly in the conception of the proper place of violence in a society. Some martial arts have become more well known through sports. Japanese judo and Korean tae kwon do are Olympic sports. In recent times, jiujitsu has become popular through the popularity of mixed martial arts sports. Martial arts have a film history for Asian Americans, most notably the presence of Chinese American Bruce Lee in films such as Enter the Dragon and Fist of Fury. Bruce Lee’s charisma has led to the spread of his martial art, Jeet Kune Do, which is a flexible and dynamic martial art that developed from Lee’s understanding of other martial arts and Chinese religious philosophy. Another well-known Asian American martial artist is Filipino American Ernie Reyes Jr., who has had film roles since the age of 12. Due to the association of martial arts and film there are many martial arts training schools that focus on noncombative, acrobatic, and musical performances. The current mixture of performance, tradition, and philosophy along with mutually influencing martial arts from a variety of Asian cultures has led to a unique hybrid of religious and charismatic martial arts. The popular image of martial arts has influenced hip-hop competitions, and many Asian American dancers, emcees, graffiti artists, and deejays adopt a martial arts persona while competing.\n\nMusic Asian Americans perform music in Western, non-Western, and hybrid styles that reflect their history. Filipino Americans continue to express the multilayered history\n\nArts and Cultural Production\n\n7\n\nof the Philippines and relate this to their experience in the United States. This hybridity contributes to the success of Filipino Americans in hip-hop, which is a bricolage art form rooted in African styles of hybridity. Hip-hop is also popular among other Asian American youth groups, and this often relates to the proximity to other minorities in the United States, similar experiences of racial marginalization as expressed by African Americans and Latinos, and hiphop’s ability to express Asian American hybridity of the traditional and modern using layered music samples and multilingual lyrics. Asian Americans have excelled at all areas of hip-hop, including the notable presences of mixed-race Filipino American turntablist DJ QBert and mixed-race Japanese American emcee Mike Shinoda, both of whom express the creativity and history of Asian American life. Similar to their connection to hip-hop, Asian Americans have identified with jazz. For example, vocalist Pat Suzuki was at the forefront of commercial jazz and Broadway theater, and saxophonist Fred Ho has united the passions of jazz with radical movements for racial justice. Asian Americans have also excelled at Western classical music. This relates to the upward mobility of some Asian Americans; Western classical music has an air of class and respectability that can be beneficial to some Asian Americans seeking to prove their belonging in higher-class circles and to others as an extension of their Western education. The latter relates to a history of colonialism in Asian countries, where education was demonstrated by the ability to perform Western arts and classical music, such as opera. Transnational Chinese\n\n8 Arts and Cultural Production\n\nAmerican cellist Yo Yo Ma was born in Paris and raised in New York City. He has used his success in classical music to promote international cultural exchanges, as demonstrated by his musical collaborations and philanthropic foundation. He represented his transnational identity in his performance for the movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon that featured Asian actors and martial artists, a transnational Taiwanese American director, Ang Lee, and a transnational Chinese American musical director, Tan Dun.\n\nPerformance Arts Performance arts are staged arts that include musical performances. They are closely linked to religion in many Asian cultures. Chinese Daoist plays involved mythology, music, dance, and acrobatics. Japanese traditions of parades, or matsuri, are rooted in local and national religions. In the United States, many of the traditions have been transformed in a few key ways. At least from the 1930s onward, ethnic enclaves, such as Chinatowns, have frequently developed themselves as destinations for American tourism. Part of this transformation was the creation of sectors of the enclaves—such as nightclubs, shopping malls, and Westernized restaurants—where tourists could observe and sample parts of ethnic culture that were considered nonthreatening. Special events in the enclaves have involved performances of cultural arts. Notable examples of this phenomenon include hula performances in Waikiki, New Year parades in Chinese American and Vietnamese American communities, and Cherry Blossom festivals in historic Japa-\n\nnese American neighborhoods. Filipino Americans continue the tradition of the Santacruzan, a Catholic procession celebrating la Reyna Elena, and some Filipino Americans have queered the procession by including cross-dressing men. Some performance arts maintain a tension between the more commercially viable art forms made popular in ethnic-tourist enclaves and the larger mission of maintaining traditional culture. The National Asian American Theatre Company fosters writers and actors who express a hybridity between Asian American and non-Asian cultures found in the United States. Many wellknown actors and writers have been associated with these movements, such as playwright Philip Kan Gotanda and film actor Victor Wong. Avant-garde dancers Eiko and Koma are also examples of artists who engage non–Asian American art communities with Asian American issues, such as the aftermath of the Cambodian genocide. Performance art is influenced strongly by music, internal arts, martial arts, and flat arts. The mutual influence brings about performances with a hybridized spiritual experience consisting of visual images of gods and communal unity, bodies with emotion and personality, and sounds that call to communal history and traditional religion. Contemporary examples of this are hip-hop artists who combine artistic training, cultural knowledge, and community outreach with African American styles of hybridity and religious experience. While Asian Americans have been in early hip-hop movements, in recent years they have been champion dancers, such as several winning teams on the MTV show America’s Best Dance Crew, and mixed-\n\nrace Filipino Daniel “Cloud” Campos who is part of the champion b-boy team Skill Methodz Crew.\n\nEnvironmental Arts Several Asian cultures have highly developed traditions of environmental design, such as Chinese Daoist geomancy and Japanese gardens for strolling and meditation. The principles of environmental art are related to architecture and interior design. Chinese Americans, for example, may design the interiors of their homes based on fengshui, geomancy, whether or not they hold Daoist beliefs. Japanese Americans also may carry the aesthetics of interior and landscape design—such as the use of shoji screens and strolling paths near colorful trees—whether or not they hold Shintō or Buddhist beliefs. There is a long history of using Asian design by Asian nations to promote themselves internationally and by Western people to express their sense of cosmopolitan style. For example, Japan has used art exhibitions, such as the Columbian Exposition of 1893, to promote the image of being both modern and traditional. This image was further promoted in cultural exchanges when Japanese designers would help Europeans and Americans develop gardens in public parks and private businesses. The exchange of ideas as well as Asian Americans taking advantage of the demand for artists with expertise in Asian design has led to Asian American artists with a variety of artistic skills developed from family tradition, conceptions of the ancient world, and contemporary art. Transnational artist Isamu\n\nArts and Cultural Production\n\n9\n\nNoguchi took family traditions and art education in the United States and Japan to create a unique blend of environmental art, such as his use of boulders, water, and etched concrete to create a Zen-inspired courtyard in Chase Manhattan Plaza in New York.\n\nLanguage Arts The language arts include literature, poetry, and graphic design. Asian Americans have traditions of language arts in English, other languages, and mixtures of languages reflecting their hybridity. Some works have become standard reading in Asian American studies programs, such as Filipino American Carlos Bulosan’s America Is in the Heart and Chinese American Maxine Hong Kingston’s The Woman Warrior. These arts have been influenced by other arts, but most notably by performance arts and music because of these arts’ use of mythology, colorful imagery, and the emotion of hybridity. Poetry and songwriting have also been present since the first arrival in the United States. In the Japanese American community, songwriting is linked directly to poetry because poetry forms are song forms, and poetry clubs (haiku and tanka) have been popular. This is also linked to religious traditions such as Obon (Festival for the Dead), which includes singing and dancing to celebrate with ancestors and unrested souls. Graphic design has been influenced by Asian and European calligraphy, and by Asian American and American imagery. This has led to the production of children’s books, mixed-media art, and poster art. Asian Americans have created comics and\n\n10 Arts and Cultural Production\n\ncomic books in both American style and Japanese style (manga). For example, Henry Yoshitaka Kiyama used an American comic style and Japanese American mixed language to illustrate his and friends’ experiences of the years between 1904 and 1922 in America in The Four Immigrants Manga. Contemporary language arts often mix the use of different Asian American traditions of language art. This mixture of arts often represents the pains and pleasures of Asian American life. For example, Korean American Theresa Hak Kyung Cha’s Dictee traces her spiritual and physical journey of hybridity using multiple languages, mythologies, images, Catholic catechism assignments, poetry, and graphic art spacing. Asian Americans in hip-hop also have mixed traditions, such as the graffiti art of David Choe and the spoken word poetry of Denizen Kane, both of whom mix Protestant Christianity, cultural traditions and music, and American popular culture.\n\nPlastic Arts Asian Americans have been at the forefront of the plastic arts, such as sculpture, furniture design, and toy design. Traditions of sculpture in rock, wood, and metal can be traced to ancient times. Many of the ideas of traditional sculpture can be linked to environmental art. For example, the form and function of Hawaiian sculpture are related to the construction of objects in religious ritual sites. Many ancient forms of Polynesian religions were tied to family traditions of specific trades, such as canoe construction, and each tradition held religious rites\n\nfor different stages of construction. In contemporary plastic art, the lines are often influenced by the lines of traditional sculpture. For example, Japanese American George Tsutakawa used the lines found in traditional Japanese rock and wood sculpture, Japanese calligraphy, and northwest Native American wood sculptures to create water fountains that flow like brushstrokes. Contemporary toys call to the images of popular culture, most notably those of Asian science fiction films, action films, and American cartoons. Asian American science fiction may mix contemporary fears, ancient traditions, and icons of a bygone America. Put into toys, the future fears become miniaturized, while the past becomes consumable and kitschy. It is this play with past and present that Asian Americans excel at depicting, especially considering that they have been represented as a threat to America and as diminutive, innocuous, and cute, while their hybridity is rooted in the Asian American and American past and present. The magazine Giant Robot, founded by Martin Wong and Eric Nakamura, reports on Asian American popular culture and represents this culture with its image of the robot that comes to save or destroy the world, an image found in science fiction and animation. Thus, contemporary Asian American plastic arts display a transnational consciousness that is influenced by ancient traditions, contemporary aesthetics, and American hybridity.\n\nFlat Arts Asian Americans have traditions traced to ancient times of using brushes, pencils,\n\nand woodblocks to create art on paper and canvas. Chinese calligraphy has been linked to prehistoric pictographs, and this form of writing has influenced writing across East Asia where China’s intellectual accomplishments have spread. Ancient Polynesian cultures painted symbols onto functional objects. South Asians have long traditions of printing mantras and other sacred writings on paper and textiles using woodblocks. Japanese ukiyo-e is a print tradition of multiple woodblocks that relates to Japanese traditions of paper and color creation. We should also consider some forms of body art as the painting of symbols onto a “canvas” of the skin. Due to colonialism and Westernization, many Asian American countries have learned Western styles of painting and drawing that have been adopted whole and in hybrid forms, such as some Japanese ukiyo-e that used single-point perspective. Watercolor is an art that expresses the hybridity of Asian Americans well because it allows for the use of Asian brushstrokes in a Western medium. Chinese American Dong Kingman, born in Oakland, California, was a watercolorist who painted American cityscapes using Chinese landscape brush techniques learned as a college student in China. Today, Chizuko Judy Sugita de Queiroz, who was trained in American universities and was influenced by her world travels, uses watercolors to illustrate her internment memories. Asian Americans have embraced nearly every branch of photography, from the avant-garde to men’s magazines. Toyo Miyatake photographed the Manzanar internment camp using a secret camera, which was confiscated, and then he photo-\n\nArts and Cultural Production\n\n11\n\ngraphed Manzanar under strict supervision. A contemporary example is Corky Lee, a Chinese American photojournalist who has documented Asian American historical events, such as the protests surrounding the Vincent Chin case.\n\nHigh-Tech Arts New technology expands the possibilities to create art. In recent decades, due to preferences in immigration policy, many Asian Americans have immigrated to the United States based on their having technological skills. In addition, some American-born Asian Americans have desired to integrate a transnational image of Asian technological superiority into their identity through the use of hip, high-tech art. The technological achievements of Asian Americans and transnational identities have influenced nearly every form of Asian American art created in recent decades. For example, Sanjay Patel illustrated the vibrant stories of the Ramāyaṇa using his training in sketch art and Adobe Illustrator. Tibetan and Japanese Buddhists have been working with neuroscientists to discover the brain’s role during meditation. The art of deejaying relies on the technology of the turntable, and in recent years mixing technology has exploded due to music compression technology and the ability to share music quickly over the Internet. The Internet has also helped Asian Americans share and teach their art, such as DJ QBert’s online deejay school. Performance arts have also incorporated high-tech arts, such as film clips and lighting that responds to music. Other arts rely on high-tech arts. Asian Americans have become known for their\n\n12 Arts and Cultural Production\n\nskills at building and racing Japanese import cars, called “tuners.” This culture was captured in The Fast and the Furious film series, which was adapted from the Vibe magazine article “Racer X” written by Chinese American Ken Li about two Chinese American racers. The third film, The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, was directed by, starred, and had stunt driving performed by Asian Americans. The import tuner racing culture integrates the ingenious, independent, and masculine image of American cars with the image of Asian technological superiority, and with African American, Latino, and early Asian American car subcultures. Asian Americans are at many levels of the video game industry. This industry has spawned new forms of community and friendship, including new identities and ideals. Many of the fantasies, heroes, and religions played in the games and acted out in video gaming cultures come from popular culture, such as the game Dungeons and Dragons, spy films, Orientalist fantasies, and American sports. Asian Americans form communities with other Asian Americans and non–Asian Americans as they play and reenact these domestic games and games from Asia. They also design websites and other online worlds, such as those in Second Life. Many of these artistic websites illustrate Asian American entrepreneurship, such as the website of the magazine Giant Robot and the website of mixed-race Japanese American pornographer Asia Carrera. Other Asian Americans are involved in many levels of digital film art. Japanese American comedian and actor Masi Oka starred in the technological and animation-savvy\n\ntelevision series Heroes and did digital artwork for Industrial Light and Magic, which is George Lucas’s digital art and film company.

Do they differ in their interpretations from other Americans? The Pew Research’s Religion and Public Life Project in 2012 provides the following data: Asian Americans are less likely than the U.S. public overall to say the Bible and other works of scripture are the word of God and should be taken literally, word for word. But here again, Asian American Christians tend to resemble Christians in the general public. Seven in 10 Asian American Catholics say the Bible is the word of God, whereas 86 percent of Asian American Protestants view it\n\nBible and Asian Americans\n\n13\n\nthe same. Twenty-nine percent of Asian American Catholics say the Bible should be interpreted literally. For Asian American Protestants, the figure is 26 percent. These figures compare with 36 percent of Asian American Hindus who consider their holy scripture is the word of God. Among Asian American Buddhists 24 percent say their holy scripture is the word of God and 10 percent of them say their sacred texts should be taken literally. The Pew Research survey notes that differences in responses among these religious groups may reflect different understandings of “holy scripture” as a collective term for multiple texts. Younger Asian Americans (ages 18 to 34) appear to see scripture as written by religious figures compared to older generations and also are likely to say that scripture should be interpreted literally. It can be said that those who stress the importance of the various methods of interpreting the Bible are being self-critical and systematic about the way they are reading the Bible. Biblical exegesis is the critical interpretation and explanation of the meaning of the biblical texts. The word critical in critical interpretation involves critical thinking, that is to say, considering all the evidence and different arguments, not criticizing something or putting something down. Biblical interpretation is necessary for a number of reasons. First, the Bible needs to be translated into the language of the reader or hearer. Translation from one language to another is necessarily interpretation. It is the taking of the meaning from the words of one language and putting it in the words of another language. There are never words that are exactly equivalent in\n\n14\n\nBible and Asian Americans\n\ntwo different languages. Furthermore, biblical interpretation is necessary to convey the meaning of ancient texts to contemporary readers or hearers. One can understand the Bible better if one has some basic knowledge of the historical, cultural, and social contexts of the Bible. There are a number of different approaches to interpreting the Bible. These methods for biblical interpretation can be grouped according to whether they focus on the world of the author, the world of the text, or the world of the reader. There are various approaches to biblical interpretation such as historical criticism, social-scientific criticism, genre analysis, narrative criticism, rhetorical criticism, feminist criticism, and so on. A recently emerging approach of Asian North American interpretation of the Bible is what is called postcolonial/global perspectives. This approach of biblical interpretation is based on the interpreter’s particular social, cultural, and racial background as an Asian American. Contrary to such critical method of interpretation as canonical criticism that looks at the meaning of a biblical text in relation to the other texts in the Bible, Asian American scholars shift the historical center in interpretation of the Bible from the North Atlantic perspective and move it to the academic periphery in their considerations of the ideologies, sociocultural boundaries, and identity formations that inform biblical interpretations. They shift the focus from the traditional European interpretations to the Asian American context. Tat-Siong Benny Liew in his book What Is Asian American Biblical Hermeneutics?: Reading the New Testament (Intersections: Asian and Pacific American Transcultural Stud-\n\nies), for example, locates the central principles of Asian American biblical hermeneutics and their dilemmas, the processes of consent and dissent for example, within the Gospel of John’s inclusiveness, the work of reading and interpreting in and for Chinese America, applying the concept of diaspora and immigration, and dealing with poetics, politics, and endless paradoxes that are key topics within Asian American ethnic and cultural studies. Asian American biblical hermeneutics as a whole affirm Asian America as a panethnic coalition, at the same time acknowledging the differences that exist within that very same coalition. The question of Asian American panethnicity and heterogeneity—or that of balancing identity politics and coalition building—tends to frame the raison d’être of Asian American biblical studies. Asian American biblical scholars argue that the Bible and Asian America should come together in order to counter racist assumptions of Western biblical scholars who use the Bible to racialize and colonize Asians as a race of “heathens.” Moreover, they insist that Asian Americans need to honor the ethnic and cultural diversity that exists within the panethnic unity. A significant reason for Asian Americans’ reading of the Bible is that Asian American communities, despite the “race of heathens” construction imposed from outside cultures, are not only mutually inclusive but also actively overlapping. In other words, Asian American communities and contexts have been institutionally or socioculturally insisting that they are “legitimated” to read the Bible. These communities and their scholars feel the “right” to patrol the boundaries and demand from others an\n\nexplanation of their use of the Bible. At the same time, they acknowledge that there is no racial/ethnic and/or disciplinary monopoly over the Bible and its interpretation. Asian American Jews and Christians have their own legitimate reasons to read the Bible in the ways that speak to their lives. Despite the discomfort and/or disorientation on the part of those who have been historically and academically legitimated to read the Bible, biblical interpretation does come from multiple, internally diverse, and externally traversing communities. Questions of canon are important because what one reads helps construct who one is. There are relations between “reading” of the Bible and “being” as Asian Americans that go both ways, as Mary F. Foskett, Jeffrey KahJin Kuan, and John Ahn suggest in their edited work, Ways of Being, Ways of Reading: Asian American Biblical Interpretation. Different ways of being may lead to alternative ways of reading, and readers are never passive reflections of what they read. Literature scholar David L. Eng implores us not to underestimate the “interpellative” or “performative” force that one’s reading might have on the development of a reader’s subjectivity and identity. If Asian Americans are reading the Bible, then they must talk about not only the implications of what they read, but also how they read. Asian American biblical scholars also recognize that their biblical hermeneutics is an expression of the globalized world. Benny Liew argues that biblical hermeneutics is a form of “talking back” to the historically colonial postures and assumptions behind the biblical scholarship. Precisely by putting together what many might see as “disparate” elements, Asian American bib-\n\nBible and Asian Americans\n\n15\n\nlical hermeneutics has the positive potential and purpose to interrogate many previously assumed understandings and practices, whether they concern biblical hermeneutics or Asian America. In other words, assembling the Bible and Asian America is an intentional attempt to appropriate a cultural canon in order to re-create and transform multiple cultures through a form of multicultural critique. The Bible is particularly good for this purpose not only because of its canonical status, but also because it is a collection of texts that was first written by the colonized but then has become instrumental for colonization. Asian American biblical scholars maintain that the Bible is a fascinating library of texts that pose issues and raise questions concerning multiple and interlocking differential relations of power. Given its status and history, the Bible is therefore particularly good to “think with,” argues Liew. “Thinking with” the Bible means not only that the Bible in no way determines or dictates one’s thought, but also that the Bible itself remains open because of the points of departure that it provides for its readers. The Bible in this sense becomes “an open text, and hence a text we are obliged to go on working on, working with.” Just as “Asian American” threatens the apparent divide between “Asia” and “America,” Asian American biblical hermeneutics might put into crises more “binary assumptions,” “purity obsessions,” and “unity illusions.” Asian American biblical scholars question both the historical colonial treatments surrounding the ownership of the Bible and also those about origins. While it is standard to situate the Bible in Palestinian soil and within the\n\n16\n\nBible and Asian Americans\n\nJewish heritage, the very word “Asian” uncannily brings back echoes of referring to the so-called biblical land—for"
