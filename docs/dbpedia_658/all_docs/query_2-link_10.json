        "text": "Hello Ron,\n\nHere is another interpretation of the deity's name from another Japanese edition I have of the \"Kojiki\". There is also the \"Nihon Shoki\", but the variations in this text do not affect the meaning of the name.\n\nMasa-katsu ( = tadashiku katta = I truly won, i.e., in a proper fashion) A-gatsu ( = watashi wa katta = I won = It was I myself who won and no one else) Kachi haya-bi (q¬?Á½ = binsoku katta = I won with speed and agility).\n\nThe original text of the \"Kojiki\" is kanbun and the editions available in the bookstores (and studied in places like Hiroshima University) have been edited, as you would probably need to do with a text that was written around 700 AD. Notice that the translator editor (A Ogihara) has adapted his interpretation to fit the immediate context, of the contest between Amaterasu and Susano-oo, but it is clear to me that the phrase could also be used as a victory cry or a victory slogan and probably was. The deity in question did not do very much except obey the command of Amaterasu to rule over the 'Land of Reed Plains', but could not immediately do so. There were a number of unruly \"earth deities\" and the land first had to be \"pacified\". The \"heavenly deities\", that is, those residing in Taka ama no hara, who were sent to do this did not immediately succeed. Nevertheless, Masakatsu Agatsu bore a son who was in fact the founder of the Imperial line.\n\nWhat do we make of this text? Well, as Mr Ravens has intimated, the \"Kojiki\" is a text that can be approached on several levels. One obvious level is a record of the pacification of Japan by the Yamato clan, especially the province of Izumo. However, the Yamato rulers established their legitimacy by claiming access to, communication with and control of, deities. In other words, they were a priesthood and so the \"Kojiki\" is also a priestly text, recording transactions with these same deities. Thus, the encounter between Amaterasu and Susano-oo can also be understood as a ritual. The parallels with the Old Testament are very striking.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAll right, guys, let's put this whole thing into perspective.\n\n1.) All observations, myths, storys, legends, or even religion is based up the general observations and experiences of human beings, right? So, no matter how weird a story or interpretation gets it should be based upon actual observations and experiences.\n\n2.) We are speaking in English, more or less depending upon the slang words and derivations thereof, but even in English the meanings can be convoluted, can't they? Don't get too deep into the actual translations because the references to certain meanings are the observations and experiences of people from another culture or even Morihei Ueshiba's writings and teachings are so far out there that even shihans have a tough time trying to figure out what he was trying to say.\n\n3.) Which brings me to my final point. Figure it out in your own language before mucking around in another language. To tell the truth, something far and not found too often, most people do not THINK IN JAPANESE! Realize the Japanese shihans are human beings affected not just by their practice and culture, but by their observations as human beings and their experiences .... Back to point number one. If you want to figure out the real secrets of Aikido it is done with these elements.\n\na.) Physical practice\n\nb.) Training the mind to connect to the body more efficiently.\n\nc.) Visualization.\n\nd.) Learning the human condition, that is the elements that affect the body physically as well as mentally\n\ne.) Learning how to set up the cues to efficiently use all the elements in the proper time and the proper place.\n\nThat's it. Simple but complicated. These elements can be used for any and all systems of martial practices, not just Aikido. I am not sure if anyone else has, to this point in time defined these points, but at this moment that one brain cell kicked in and some clarity came to me.\n\nDon't worry, it will go away in a few minutes...... But anyway....\n\nDon't get so involved in finding the exact translation because it is not the philosophy of words we are defining, but the actions, observations, and experiences of practice we are TRYING to define.\n\nI get the feeling that we are talking about a number of different images that can be evoked by emotion, intonation, and inflextion that can make the same words mean completely different things?\n\nIf that is true .... then the feeling for what was supposed to be meant for these words, Masagatsu Agatsu Katsu Hayabi, would be more correctly interpreted by the English meaning of Self Victory, True Victory, Right here, Right now.\n\nIf it isn't ..... well ... maybe one of you guys in Japan could get someone who has lived in both cultures to discuss just what the founder might have meant?\n\nNow my curiosty is up. ( hmmmm .... how many interpretations for that little sentence?)\n\nMr Baker,\n\nI do not know who you were thinking of in your last post and I apologize if my posts in this thread show a lack of perspective, but this was not my impression of the entire thread. The discussion has been very well balanced.\n\nOf course, like aikido, E-Budo is for everybody, scholars as well as philistines, but I understand that detailed discussion of ancient texts will not appeal to everybody. Whenever I contribute to this forum, I speak only for myself (unless I am wearing the moderator's hat) and not for other members, as you appear to be doing. Nevertheless, I believe there are one or two points that should be borne in mind when approaching Morihei Ueshiba and I speak now, not as a student of Japanese culture, but as an aikido beginner with over 30 years of training.\n\n1. Morihei Ueshiba did not speak English, but he was very good at Japanese, with a fine ear for the poetics of the language. Although the phrase Masakatsu Agatsu Katsu Hayabi is usually written in Chinese kanji and the Founder often wrote it this way, it is a Japanese phrase. Contrary to what was stated in a reference quoted in an earlier post, it was not his original phrase. I have not checked this yet, but I suspect the phrase is so old that it was used as a victory slogan well before the \"Kojiki\" was ever written.\n\nWhy have I spent a long time studying the \"Kojiki\" and other ancient texts in Japanese? Because the Founder himself studied these texts. He was Japanese and wrote in Japanese, and at this stage in my aikido life, I believe it important for myself to study what the Founder said in his own words. Actually, I believe that trying to approach him in his own language, even apart from practical benefits of better understanding of what he actually said, is a mark of 'respect for the old', which is what the word 'keiko' means. I once had a conversation here in Japan with the late Saito Morihiro Shihan about O Sensei. He gave me a piece of advice, \"Practice hard, but also learn the language. It is impossible to understand what O Sensei said without knowing Japanese.\" I commend to your attention the recent interview with Arikawa Sadateru Shihan in Susan Perry's ATM magazine.\n\n2. Of course, this forum is in English and there are a few translations available of what the Founder said, but do not fool yourself that the translations are as good as the original. Some translations have to be very practical, for if you do not understand the No Parking signs here, it will prove very expensive. In the case of Morihei Ueshiba quoting ancient Japanese texts, I know from my study of ancient Greek and Latin that a knowledge of the context is sometimes crucial for understanding the meaning and I think this is partly the case here. My suspicions were confirmed by one of my Japanese graduate students yesterday, who believed that the reference to Masakatsu Agatsu Kachi Hayabe cited by Morohei Ueshiba in \"Takamusu Aiki\" was a reference to the deity and not to any abstract moral concept about victory of self, such as you might believe from reading Mr Stevens. Actually, one of the great benefits of Mr Stevens' writings is the stimulus it gives to people like myself, who know something of the background, to follow in his footsteps and look at the ancient texts for myself. It is an interesting supplement to daily training, though not, of course, a substitute.\n\n3. As is talking to the people here who knew the Founder and listened to what he said. There are a number of high ranking aikidoka like Abe Seiichi Shihan and Arikawa Sadateru Shihan who have spent a lifetime studying the Founder's training and his descriptions of this training. Since we cannot to talk to the Founder himself, and ask him what he meant, talking to these gentlemen, in fact questioning them deeply and incessantly, is the only alternative. But, fortunately or unfortunately, I myself need to do this in Japanese. I do not believe that the free interpretation of what the Founder wrote, as you seem to be suggesting in your posts, is the correct way of understanding him.\n\n4. Does all this matter? Well, I suppose it depends on the individual. It is not my place to tell you how to practise your aikido, just as it is not your place to tell me how to practise mine. I never heard of the phrase until I came here and began to study the ancient texts--and then realized that these texts were vital for any understanding of what O Sensei said. Most people do not have the time or means, or even the need, to study the writings of the Founder in the original and this is fine: as I said, it is up to the individual.\n\nHowever, those of us who do should seize the opportunity and I myself think it is very important for the future development of aikido to study Morihei Ueshiba, but in his historical and cultural context and not to regard him as some religious or moral icon who dropped out of the sky, so to speak. Of course, such study is not a substitute for training, but we should not be too extreme about this. The samurai, and Morihei Ueshiba himself, strove for a balance of 'bun' and 'bu' and this is a good goal for me. When we say that aikido is for everybody, we mean that we train in the best way we can with the gifts we have been given, all of them, physical and intellectual.\n\nBest regards,\n\nThank you Mr. Goldsbury,\n\nI appreciate your postion, and the manner in which you are attempting to understand the thoughts and writings of the founder in the original language, but I was wondering about one thing .... are you thinking in Japanese when you read Japanese, or are you thinking in English while reading Japanese?\n\nIf you can think and read Japanese, or Chinese for that matter and think as a native in that language, you are light years ahead of me. I doubt I will be a scholar at anything, but then again, Edison was a common man with lots of drive wasn't he? How much did his efforts contribute to change the world? Quite a bit, eh?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I truly and heartfeltly appreciate your input and clarity, but it just confirms what the conclusions I have come to, in English, with my own form of logic. It is a logic that observes and compares the phenonmena of the universe itself to the conclusions that humanity has drawn from existing in this environment of planet earth. If one human being can get some insight from having a simular body, and experiencing simular phenonmena, then simular conclusions should be reached just as any proper experiment done under simular circumstances should reach the same conclusions.\n\nI wish I could learn to read and think in other languages, but alas, that is beyond my capacity for a number of reasons. What I can do is to examine a broad spectrum of data, and for all practical purposes, test this data in a variety of ways to find out what works, what doesn't work and what science supports or dispells why it works or doesn't work.\n\nWell, I think I have enough of the pieces to clear up even your scholarly studys should we discuss questions in the English language, the only real language I have a grasp upon, and sometimes I wonder about that grasp of english on some days.\n\nDon't mind me, in the great scheme of things, I am just a passing conversation.\n\nKeep correcting me if I am wrong, it just makes me look a little harder at the big picture. Let alone it puts in some details that other people need that I may have forgotten.\n\nThanks again for your input.\n\nHello Mr Baker,\n\nWhen I read Japanese, a newspaper, for example, for much of the time I do not have to go through the process of translating the Japanese into English. When I speak Japanese, on many occasions it just comes out, so to speak. There is no translation from English. If you call this thinking in Japanese, well, yes, I think in Japanese. However, I believe that this case is different.\n\nDo you think in English when you read Beowulf in the original (if you can read Beowulf in the original)? You probably do think in English, but it makes no difference to your understanding of Beowulf. I am using Beowulf as an example of an English text of roughly the same age as the \"Kojiki\", which contains the original phrase \"Masakatsu Agatsu Katsu Hayabi\". An additonal problem, which does not occur with Beowulf, is that the phrase is actually written in Chinese characters and could also be read as (something like) SEISHOU-GOSHOU-SHOU-SOKUJITSU, except that no Japanese would probably understand this.\n\nI mentioned in an earlier post that I asked one of my Japanese doctoral students what the phrase meant. I wrote down the phrase in Japanese kanji, without telling him who wrote it or where it first appeared. This Japanese native speaker had no idea what it meant. All he could say was 'True Win I Win Winning Early Day'. I then had him read the relevant parts of the \"Kojiki\" and he understood. He accepted the interpretation of the scholar editors and agreed that the phrase meant, 'I myself won in a proper fashion and I won there and then.' I also showed him the passage from Ueshiba's \"Takamusu Aiki\" and he had no hesitation in stating that Ueshiba was referring to the deity of the \"Kojiki\" and, moreover, that the emphasis was not so much on the deity Masakatsu Agatsu Katsu Hayabi himself as on the child he produced, who was to rule over Japan. O Sensei states that we must follow the way of the deity and produce such a child from our aikido training. In an earlier post I cited the original reference and the translation in Aikido Journal, so you can find the place and judge for yourself.\n\nThus, for an understanding of the original phrase I go to the texts themselves and use the same tools I would use to understand Homer or Beowulf. On this basis I can interpret the entire text without any reference at all to 'victory over oneself' etc. Now if you or someone else comes along and tells me that O Sensei REALLY meant Victory over Self etc, my next question is, where is the evidence? This is why I asked Ron Tisdale when and where he had first read the phrase or heard it. Nor will it do to quote the 'douka', for this is in the same Japanese as the \"Kojiki\" and could also refer to the deity.\n\nNow I suppose it is possible to say that one can understand what O Sensei meant by the phrase because one has had similar experiences. I myself think this is putting the cart way, way in front of the horse, for there is no way of coming to this conclusion other than reading the Japanese words on the page. The translation is no help here, for this is the point at issue.\n\nBest regards,"
