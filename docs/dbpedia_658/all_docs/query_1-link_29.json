        "text": "little-wings says:\n\nHi and welcome to this new Aikido group ^_^. I noticed that although there were a lot of people who listed Aikido as one of their \"interests\" when I searched for an Aikido group, the search came back empty.\n\nAs a starter for the discussion section of the group, here's a question.... Where do you train?\n\nI started training at Georgetown Universty in Washington, DC and also attend class at Shobukan Dojo. Currently I'm studying in Japan and training with the Sophia University Aikikai Circle.\n\n6:54AM, 17 May 2005 PDT\n\nd.sato says:\n\nI studied Shodokan Aikido for 6 months at the University YWCA in Berkeley, CA about 2 years ago. I have not had the time to get back into it until now. I also recently did a short photo story on a local Aikido class in San Jose, CA for my beginning photojournalism class at San Jose State University. I hope to begin my training again in earnest.\n\nages ago\n\nlittle-wings says:\n\nTraining in the US varies greatly depending on which school/organization you train with. In the US I trained with an ASU (Aikido Schools of Ueshiba) dojo, and the techniques themselves are very much like the training at Hombu Dojo here in Tokyo. One of the main differences I've noticed though is because Hombu is so crowded... everyone's ukemi is very, how should I say it... scrunched? small? short? Back at home we would, as much as possible, try to do complete rolls. At hombu people tend to do this sort of abreviated slide from one shoulder to the other.\n\nAs for where I've trained in Tokyo, I train with the Sophia University Aikikai Circle twice a week and have been to Hombu a handful of times. I've also visted a small aikikai dojo on the other side of the city who's name I can't remember (since the pamphlet I have is all in characters, and in my head I just call it the Koto-ku dojo ^_^).\n\nages ago\n\nzealous mitten [deleted] says:\n\nHello, nice to come across this group. I am very much a beginner with aikido ('been training for about 4½ months now), and I train at Tenchigowa Dojo, in Amsterdam, Holland. We have two sensei who follow a line from a French sensei - Christian Tissier, Shihan. The photos I've posted were taken on 21march2005, at a National Dutch Aikido Foundation Day, with Sensei Kuribayashi Shihan as a special guest.\n\nages ago\n\nTadDonaghe says:\n\nI train at Aikido of Scottsdale in Arizona. I've been training for about 8 months now and I'll be testing soon for my 5th kyu rank.\n\nMy wife trains with me and it's been the best thing we've done together. Aikido is probably the most fun I've ever had in a group.\n\nages ago\n\nBlue Cockatoo says:\n\nI am Fantt's wife (from a few posts up) and he's actually been in Aikido for almost a year now instead of 8 months. I've been training about 10 months myself and it's one of the best things I've ever participated in. We both love it and it's great to be able to talk to each other about things we did in class too since no one else we know can relate!\n\nFantt was out for almost 3 months with an ankle injury and it was while he was out that I started training and ended up being his sempai! I went ahead and tested (5th kyu) and he hopefully will get the chance to test soon for his first rank.\n\nages ago\n\nshugyou says:\n\nHowdy!\n\nI train at Aikido West in Redwood City, California. Our dojo cho is Frank Doran Shihan. Our dojo is fairly standard US Aikikai with yudansha wearing hakama and clapping twice during bow-in.\n\nI first got on the mat a little over three years ago, and was completely swept off of my feet. We just finished the 30th annual Aiki Summer Retreat this past weekend. What a blast! I only wish I had more photos of the classes, but I was too busy training.\n\nages ago\n\nChris&Oli says:\n\nHi (it's Oli, Chris is my wife)\n\nI train in Belgium, in the Murashige Ryu of Brussels. Practising for 5 years, 1 dan since june 2004, aikido is for me, as Fantt said \" the most fun I've ever had in a group\".\n\nMy sensei's home page: www.sensei.be\n\nWhat else?\n\nAikido without smiles and is like an omelette without eggs!\n\nages ago\n\ncurious rest [deleted] says:\n\nHello all!\n\nI train in São Paulo, Brazil, at the Nova Era Aikido. I began training in 1997 with Maria Luiza Serzedello Kumagai, or just Lila Sensei (4th dan aikikai).\n\nAikido has really changed my life. I've cured a disorder as a consequence of a bike accident when I was a child. So I'm very thankful to this magnificent way of life. It also got me new true friends I hope to be at my side for a long long time!\n\nages ago\n\nmedical partner [deleted] says:\n\nHi,\n\nI just signed in to flickr and it is really nice seeing that there are already Aikido photos...\n\nI am training at the Ki Aikido dojo in Freiburg.\n\nI started there about four years ago.\n\nIn the meantime, I also practised at Ki No Kenkyukai Singapore with Francis Chong sensei, and in Madrid with Carlos Gonzalez Vera.\n\nCheers,\n\nZeno\n\nages ago\n\nurpo. says:\n\nHi\n\nRecent Flickr newbie. I knew there'd be an aikido group, because as I've come to realise aikidoka are everywhere.\n\nI've been training (with breaks) since September 2000, so nearly 5yrs now. Time does fly.\n\nOur dojo is in central London, the OAA ( www.openaikido.co.uk ). We're the UK representatives of Aikido Kobayashi Dojos , so aikikai.\n\nI'm working towards shodan next year and feeling it in every muscle/joint/tendon. As has been said... I need to reeeelllaaax more!\n\nBy nature I'd always been suspicious of anything where people say something 'changed their life', but now... I don't think it's changed my life, but it's certainly affected almost every part of it.\n\nAs with Chris's comment earlier, the strongest thing is the smiling and the humour. Definitely the most fun you can have falling over.\n\nIf I can ever make myself sit out, then I'll definitely post some photos.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nurpo. edited this topic ages ago.\n\nlong_tongue_toad says:\n\nhi all im a long time offender in martial arts 20 years have done kung fu jujitsu and full contact karate and of course aikido which ive been doing solidly for the past 12 years i train in birmingham england a club called tai shin do ryu aikido its under the umbrella of the aikido research federation apart from me being one of the instructors the head is sensei mark fisher and his brother noel who have been very good friends with for a long time, and i love teaching and in my time have seen some gifted people take up aikido and sadly stop through different things like working shifts or moving illness its a shame but training goes on\n\nages ago\n\nBlackwyr says:\n\nHi, all. I've been practicing aikido for slightly over two years at River City Aikikai in Chattanooga, TN, and will be testing soon for 4th kyu.\n\nI've been a martial-arts dilettante for most of my life, but aikido has really grabbed me; I think I encountered it at the right place and the right time.\n\nages ago\n\nold-fashioned statement [deleted] says:\n\nI train in Exeter in the UK. I started off in Suffolk and moved here about 5 years ago.\n\nMy original teacher has travelled and trained with many people, I think he'd say that his greatest influences are Yamada and Obata sensei.\n\nThe dojo where I now practice is directly linked to the Osaka Aikikai.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\nold-fashioned statement edited this topic ages ago.\n\nVarjohaltia says:\n\nI train in Tampa, Florida at the University of South Florida Aikido Club, which doesn't have a dojo per se, just a room at a gym where it meets three times a week. The club is affiliated with the Jihonjuku Academy and John Messores sensei in nearby Clearwater. The university club gets a lot of older non-university folks training too, military personnel and people for whom that location is just very convenient. Thanks to the affiliation, there are several rotating senseis.\n\nages ago\n\nAntropoturista says:\n\nIwama no Michi, Liege, Belgium.\n\nTraditional aikido style, straight forward from Iwama. I am inthe fourth year of practice now and couldn't live without it anymore. The dojo where I like to stay as uchi dechi is the one of Daniel Toutain in Renne, France. He just tought here in Liege for a a weekend.
