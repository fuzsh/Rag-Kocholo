        "text": "Stay with Us!\n\nThe stately manor is filled with one-of-a-kind rooms, a beguiling ghost, spa, soaking pool, theater, games and restaurants serving handcrafted goodness.\n\nAn escape into the extraordinary\n\nWalking guide\n\nThis former Masonic & Eastern Star property 25 miles west of Portland is peppered with unique rooms, restaurants, bars and a spa. Free live music and events fill the calendar, and summertime brings musicians from across the country to Concerts in the Grove.\n\nFrom the Ironwork Grill to Pat’s Corner and the small bars tucked between, you’re sure to find a tasty bite and heartwarming quaff in a cozy spot, indoors or out. Our beer, wine, cider, spirits and coffee are handcrafted at McMenamins, and a vegetable garden and estate chickens help supply the Ironwork Grill’s kitchen.\n\nRecharge in one of the 90 guestrooms or find your medicine in the Doctor's Office bar, where pool tables beckon. Late night revelers may meet the Lavender Lady, whose spirit is said to drift through the halls. The Lady and historic figures are commemorated with historical photographs and fanciful art woven through the rooms and halls, from baseboard to ceiling.\n\nRejuvenate in the soaking pool nestled among outdoor greenery, then savor a massage, manicure or other restorative treatment at Ruby's Spa.\n\n15 minutes away, guests can discover Hagg Lake for fishing, boats rentals, and trails for hiking and biking, as well as the thrills of a zipline park adjacent to the lake. More fishing and hiking spots are found in the Tillamook State Forest. And Grand Lodge is just an hour’s drive to the famed Oregon Coast.\n\nNearby, the vineyards and winery tasting rooms of Oregon Wine Country beckon, and SakéOne, the leading brewer of craft saké in the U.S., is just down the road.\n\nCheck-in is at 3pm; check-out is at 11am\n\nThe 90 guestrooms at the Grand Lodge feature whimsical artwork, original porcelain sinks and air conditioning. Guests may choose from rooms with private baths, or shared common private bathrooms down the hall. For ADA rooms, please contact the hotel directly.\n\nFoundation Guestrooms reflect musicians and others who have influenced McMenamins in some way; there's the painting of Bob McMenamin (the father of Founders Mike and Brian) and his namesake \"Bob's Bar\" featuring live music until 10pm, adjacent to the rooms, as well as a Bob Marley room. This wing is part of the building's foundation as well.\n\nThe Main Floor Guestrooms benefitted from a recent upgrade, giving the majority of rooms their own attached bathrooms.\n\nOur newest addition, the Third Floor Guestrooms, each have private bathrooms, and are named after a literary passage or book, which inspired the artwork as well. It’s a floor full of mystery and surprises around every bend. Enjoy the hand-painted headboards inspired by writers, and a Grateful Dead-inspired light bulb display.\n\nHearing a suspicious knocking in the walls? Not to worry – it’s not a ghost or some noisy neighbors. It’s just our historic and efficient radiator warming up to keep things cozy.\n\nMidweek Retreat at Grand Lodge\n\nSchedule meetings, conferences and retreats Monday through Thursday, and enjoy a complimentary welcome reception and 15% discount on 2-night stays.

Here are a few ideas...\n\nLocal Wineries\n\nIf you only have time for one attraction, this is it - don't miss Washington County's vineyards. While our neighbor to the south (the esteemed Willamette Valley) may be more well-known for its wineries, our Washington County area also hosts a multitude of wonderful vineyards, all within 10 miles of the hotel. Take a guided tour or just drive around by yourselves for the day.\n\nOutdoor Recreation\n\nTap into your inner adventurer and climb and zipline your way through the trees at Tree to Tree Aerial Adventure Park.\n\nFive miles outside of town, enjoy the great outdoors at Henry Hagg Lake. Soak up the sunshine on water skis or boats. If it's not warm enough for sunbathing, the lake also offers great bike trails.\n\nThe Tillamook State Forest is within half an hour's drive and is a haven for outdoor enthusiasts, with miles of trails for all levels of hikers and easy access to several rivers and streams for fishing or swimming.\n\nThe Fernhill Wetlands is a local sanctuary for waterfowl and birdwatchers alike.\n\nFor golfers, the area surrounding Forest Grove offers up several choices to practice a quick nine holes or go the whole eighteen.\n\nShopping\n\nDowntown Forest Grove hosts many antique dealers, boutiques and other small shops.

While our neighbor to the south (the esteemed Willamette Valley) may be more well-known for its wineries, our Washington County area also hosts a multitude of wonderful vineyards, all within 10 miles of the hotel. Take a guided tour or just drive around by yourselves for the day.\n\nOutdoor Recreation\n\nTap into your inner adventurer and climb and zipline your way through the trees at Tree to Tree Aerial Adventure Park.\n\nFive miles outside of town, enjoy the great outdoors at Henry Hagg Lake. Soak up the sunshine on water skis or boats. If it's not warm enough for sunbathing, the lake also offers great bike trails.\n\nThe Tillamook State Forest is within half an hour's drive and is a haven for outdoor enthusiasts, with miles of trails for all levels of hikers and easy access to several rivers and streams for fishing or swimming.\n\nThe Fernhill Wetlands is a local sanctuary for waterfowl and birdwatchers alike.\n\nFor golfers, the area surrounding Forest Grove offers up several choices to practice a quick nine holes or go the whole eighteen.\n\nShopping\n\nDowntown Forest Grove hosts many antique dealers, boutiques and other small shops. Pick up a souvenir to remind you of your trip.\n\nThe Streets of Tanasbourne shopping mall is a short drive away and includes REI, Banana Republic, Macy's and more.\n\nAnd for more ideas, check out the Washington County Visitor Association website.\n\nArtwork plays an important role in the character of McMenamins locations throughout Oregon and Washington. We believe art makes life richer and more enjoyable. So, you'll often find paintings covering our walls, ceilings doors, overhead pipes, and equipment – works as diverse and entertaining as our places for family and friends. Many artists have contributed to this vast variety of delightful eye candy.

The first resident, Brother Henry Mounts, moves in on February 24. The dedication of the Home is held on June 14.\n\n1926-27\n\nThe smaller building, called the \"Children's Cottage,\" is completed in November 1926. Intended to house orphans of Masons, the Cottage's capacity is 32 children.\n\n1927-28\n\nIt is determined that the orphanage should be closed because the relations between the elderly and the children are less than harmonious. Children start relocating to outside families.\n\n1933-34\n\nThe salaries of Home employees are slashed 15 percent.\n\n1938\n\nNew dairy barn built to save money on the cost of dairy products.\n\n1957\n\nFarm and dairy is discontinued in view of financial deficits.\n\n1962\n\nThe Columbus Day Storm causes considerable damage: most of the Cottage roof is torn off, the dormer roof over the main lodge porch is damaged and twenty trees are uprooted. The power is knocked out and remains off for several hours, but the Home's auxiliary plant is in action within ten minutes of the power outage.\n\n1970\n\nThe offices of the Oregon Grand Lodge are relocated to the former Children's Cottage.\n\n1988-89\n\nThe Masons build the Jennings-McCall Center, a 72-unit elder-care apartment complex just north of the Masonic Home.\n\n1999\n\nThe Masons build Jennings-McCall II and a new Grand Lodge office and meeting facility with the intent of moving out of the original Masonic Home and Children's Cottage. McMenamins agrees to become the new \"custodian\" of the great old property. Renovation begins that fall.\n\nMarch 1, 2000\n\nThe property reopens as McMenamins Grand Lodge.\n\nFermentation Chamber\n\nIn the depths of the Grand Lodge, we’re transforming fresh vegetables and herbs to concoct new flavors in old favorites with small-batch sauerkraut, giardiniera, curtido, vinegars and shrubs – and these tangy delights are being woven into entrees and cocktails served at Grand Lodge restaurants. You can also find our shrubs and other products bottled to go in select McMenamins hotel gift shops.\n\nCheck Grand Lodge menus for the latest or ask your bartender for a cocktail crafted with our seasonally featured shrub (a drinking vinegar with just the right amounts of fruit, sugar and vinegar).\n\nHold your Private Event at Grand Lodge\n\nWeddings Meetings Social Events\n\nAn event at the Grand Lodge will leave a lasting impression on your guests, whether they are colleagues, family reunion attendees or friends gathering for a wedding celebration. We offer a variety of event spaces, guestrooms, a full-service spa and more.\n\nA gathering at the Grand Lodge takes you into a beautifully rural wine-country setting – yet is still convenient to the Portland International and Hillsboro Regional airports and only 30 minutes to downtown Portland.\n\nContact our sales team to inquire or book your event.\n\nGet Started Here\n\nParking & ADA\n\nThere is complimentary parking surrounding the property at Grand Lodge; it is available on a first come, first served basis.\n\nADA-accessible parking spaces are available in both the east and west lots, as well as in front of the main building where a ramp is available.\n\nWe encourage guests to remove all valuables from their vehicle.\n\nOur main building offers an elevator, however, the Children’s Cottage does not."
