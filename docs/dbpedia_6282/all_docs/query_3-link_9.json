        "text": "Whether you're in the mood for a straight-forward whodunnit murder mystery film or craving a far-reaching conspiracy with huge societal ramifications, we've narrowed down a list of some of the best mystery movies of all time. With directors Kenneth Branagh and Rian Johnson bringing the genre back to life in multiplexes in a big way (and Glass Onion landing on Netflix), we're taking a look at some true classics.\n\nWhether it's Alfred Hitchcock, David Fincher, John Huston, or Christopher Nolan, we've got just about every era covered - from film noir to modern thrillers. Shootings, stabbings, poisonings... they all must be avenged. And these films present some of the greatest mystery movies of all time.\n\nKnives Out (2019)\n\nWhere to Watch: Rentable on most platforms.\n\nRian Johnson's star-studded, old-school murder mystery was filled with diabolical performances and crafty twists and turns. Daniel Craig landed his second franchise here (as Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery lands on Netflix) as inquisitive puzzle-solver Benoit Blanc, a Southern sleuth called in to investigate the death of a wealthy mystery writer (Christopher Plummer). Standing in his way is... well, the author's nefarious family and also his nurse, Marta (Ana de Armas), who's afraid she might be found guilty of a wrongful death. Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, and LaKeith Stanfield also star.\n\nRead our review of Knives Out or check out more Chis Evans movies.\n\nThe Big Sleep (1946)\n\nWhere to Watch: DirecTV, TCM, or rentable on most platforms.\n\nA pinnacle of the film noir era, The Big Sleep from 1946 is the famed adaptation of Raymond Chandler's hardboiled crime novel featuring Humphrey Bogart as private detective Philip Marlowe. It helped set the blueprint for gumshoes getting sucked into labyrinthine conspiracies and facing foes they have no true chance of beating. At the time too, America had \"Bogie and Bacall\" (as in co-star Lauren Bacall) fever, as the two had just gotten married the year before. Their chemistry is to die for.\n\nThe Maltese Falcon (1941)\n\nWhere to Watch: Max or rentable on most platforms.\n\nJust a few years before The Big Sleep, the legendary John Huston wrote and directed this adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon. This classic mystery has it all: Humphrey Bogart as San Fransisco private detective Sam Spade, Mary Astor as his femme fatale client, and a rogue's gallery of unscrupulous characters. Gladys George, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet co-star in what's considered to be one of the best films of all time.\n\nRear Window (1954)\n\nWhere to Watch: Rentable on most platforms.\n\nThis list could easily be dominated by \"Master of Suspense\" Alfred Hitchcock's films, so for brevity's sake we've chosen Rear Window as one of the director's best murder mystery thrillers to represent the Hitchcock spot. Rear Window features a knockout gimmick, fun performances by Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, and the director's own trademark sinister style. It, like a handful of movies on this list, is considered an all-timer.\n\nMurder on the Orient Express (1974) / Death on the Nile (1978)\n\nWhere to Watch: (Orient Express) Fubo, Hoopla, or rentable on most platforms. (Death on the Nile) Hoopla, Roku (w/ ads), Pluto TV (w/ ads), Tubi (w/ ads), Freevee (w/ ads), Shout TV, Plex, or rentable on most platforms.\n\nYou could watch Kenneth Branagh's new versions of Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile (and then A Haunting in Venice when it hits theaters in September 2023) or you can watch these superb '70s versions of two of Agatha Christie's best Hercule Poirot mysteries. It's your call, really. Christie is one of the best mystery writers of all time and Poirot is her premiere protagonist (right next to Miss Marple). Different actors portray Poirot in these adaptations -- Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov, respectively -- but like the Branagh versions, the \"red herring\" ensembles are filled with famous faces of the era.\n\nChinatown (1974)\n\nWhere to Watch: HBO Max, Hoopla, DirecTV, Kanopy, or rentable on most platforms.\n\nForty years removed from the hardboiled detective novels that inspired film noir, Chinatown brought back the format and unspooled one of the grandest, most-applauded mystery movies of all time. Jack Nicholson headlined this one as private dick J. J. Gittes, a down-on-his-luck 1930s investigator who haphazardly uncovers a series of murders connected to the California water wars. This multi-layered story, which was part mystery and part psychological drama, also starred Faye Dunaway and Maltese Falcon director John Huston.\n\nMemento (2001)\n\nWhere to Watch: HBO Max, Hoopla, Kanopy, DirecTV, or rentable on most platforms.\n\nOftentimes, film noir mysteries were purposefully baffling, focusing on the investigation itself while the results amounted to very little. It was a comment on the eroding clarity and morality of the time, stemming from the existential crisis occurring in America following World War I. Many times the protagonist would find themselves back where they started. Well, this Christopher Nolan movie took that idea and turned it into a full-fledged format twist, as Memento featured a lead character with the inability to form new memories and a story that, because of this short-term memory loss, works its way backwards. Guy Pearce's tattooed widower bent on revenge finds himself at the mercy of his own past rage, unable to realize he's tricking himself. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano also star.\n\nSee more of the best thriller movies of all time.\n\nGosford Park (2001)\n\nWhere to Watch: Rentable on most platforms.\n\nDirector Robert Altman and Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes delivered a devious, dark comedy with the 2001 murder mystery Gosford Park, starring a truly stunning ensemble of players - like Maggie Smith, Kristin Scott Thomas, Emily Watson, Charles Dance, Ryan Phillippe, Stephen Fry, Michael Gambon, Richard E. Grant, Derek Jacobi, Kelly Macdonald, Helen Mirren, Jeremy Northam, and Clive Owen. When a murder occurs after a dinner party during a shooting weekend at an English country house, the wealthy Britons and their servants present their different perspectives as to what happened.\n\nClue (1985)\n\nWhere to Watch: Paramount+ w/ Showtime add-on or rentable on most platforms.\n\nBefore there were movies based on video games there was Clue. A kooky, off-kilter comedy, based on the murder mystery board game (with main characters directly from the game itself), Clue featured an ensemble of winning comedy performers -- like Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn, Christopher Lloyd, and Michael McKean -- in a zany whodunnit that featured three different filmed endings/resolutions. And back in 1985, you'd get a different ending depending on the theater where you saw the movie. Now you just watch all three endings unravel at the finish, though that doesn't take away from this hilarious, quotable dinner-party-turned-deadly.\n\nThe Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (2011)\n\nWhere to Watch: Hulu, Topic, or rentable on most platforms.\n\nDirector David Fincher hasn't made as many feature films as Alfred Hitchcock, but his gruesome spin on the suspense genre has given us magnificent modern mysteries like Seven, The Game, and Gone Girl. For our Fincher pick though, it's his American remake of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, an adaptation of Stieg Larsson's first book in the \"Millennium Series,\" which feature the characters hacker Lisbeth Salander and journalist Mikael Blomkvist. The ferocious film, starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, teams the two to solve the mystery of a vanished girl from a wealthy family from 40 years prior.\n\nRead our review of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\n\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit (1988)\n\nWhere to Watch: Disney+, Roku (w/ ads), or rentable on most platforms.\n\nThis landmark movie in terms of blending live-action animation (during a rather Wild West era of IP use) imagines a world where cartoons are real and living in Los Angeles, filming their animated shorts like actors would a regular movie. A stylish, silly, and sometimes scary homage to film noir, Who Framed Roger Rabbit pairs a joyful-but-dimwitted toon with Bob Hoskins' boozy, hardscrabble P.I. for a murder case that leads into a full land-grab conspiracy, filled with thought-provoking social commentary and wild set pieces.\n\nLA Confidential (1995)\n\nWhere to Watch: Roku w/ Starz add-on or rentable on most platforms.\n\nCurtis Hanson's masterful good cop/bad cop/worse cop ensemble drama helped put Aussie actors Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe on the map here in the U.S while also harkening back to classic film noir. There's a new drug pusher in L.A. and three different cops, working things from different angles, must come together to take down the City of Angels' new mystery crime lord. Taking home a couple of Oscars (including one for actress Kim Basinger), LA Confidential is cynical and suspenseful.\n\nUpcoming Mystery Movies\n\nAlthough there aren't a lot of big mystery movies on the horizon, there are a few different things to look forward to. Perhaps the most intriguing upcoming mystery movie update is that is supposedly going to be a Clue Reboot from Ryan Reynolds that we don't have the release date for just yet.\n\nComing sooner than that in January, 2024 is Night Swim, which is a great pick for fans of mystery-horror films. Fans of spy movies can also look forward to the new Matthew Vaughn film called Argylle, which will hit theaters in February, 2024.\n\nMatt Fowler is a freelance entertainment writer/critic, covering TV news, reviews, interviews and features on IGN for 13+ years."
