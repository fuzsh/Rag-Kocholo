        "text": "There ain’t nothing better than a whodunit. Films like Glass Onion and Scream are considered classics for a reason (and that’s not just because I’m simping for Chris Evans and Matthew Lillard). You gotta give these films their props because the murderer reveals? *Chef’s kiss* My amateur detective brain could never!\n\nBut that’s exactly what makes these movies so fun. I mean, everyone becomes a detective the minute a mystery is afoot, no matter what their real-life job may be. Because even when presented with an actual murder mystery, best believe we’re grabbing our deerstalkers (or fedoras if you’re more of a modern girlie), magnifying glasses, and trench coats before taking to Reddit to collectively pore over every detail—and dig up new ones, too. Real true-crime sleuths know the deal. And, honestly, police detectives need to give us our flowers because we’ve solved…okay more like brought attention to some of the greatest mysteries like Tiger King and Don’t F*ck With Cats.\n\nI get it if you’re not interested in real-life murder mysteries because *trauma,* but that doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy a good ole whodunit story. The world of mystery has taken on every conceivable form with comedies like Clue and dark, twisty, psychological films like Gone Girl. You also can’t forget to include G-rated films like Zootopia or Who Framed Mr. Rabbit either. Whatever your mystery mood is, this list of the 45 best murder mystery movies of all time has you covered.\n\nRear Window (1954)\n\nNo one can give you a murderous thrill quite like Alfred Hitchcock and (depending on who you ask) this one is his best ever. After breaking his leg and being confined to his Manhattan apartment, Jeff takes to looking out his window and right into his neighbors' units. But one night, he sees something incredibly suspicious and becomes convinced that a murder has taken place.\n\nSee How They Run (2022)\n\nSaoirse Ronan and Sam Rockwell play two detectives in London's West End in the 1950s who are called in to investigate the murder of a theater crew member working on a big hit of a play, which just so happens to be an adaptation of a novel by Agatha Christie—ya know, the queen of murder mystery!\n\nL.A. Confidential (1997)\n\nIt's 1950's L.A. and the police force is dealing with some serious corruption. And in the midst of that, three cops are trying to crack open the case on an unsolved murder, each using their own, er, personal brand of justice.\n\nThe Da Vinci Code (2006)\n\nA mysterious murder AND cryptic clues left in Leonardo da Vinci's paintings? Umm, yes please! When a man is murdered inside the Louvre, the detectives must follow the clues, uncovering a two-thousand-year-old secret society.\n\nMurder By Death (1976)\n\nFive of the greatest detectives in the world are invited to dinner at a mysterious castle, and they soon find out that their host has planned an unsolvable murder. But if anyone can find out who the killer is, they'll win $1 million.\n\nBefore I Go To Sleep (2014)\n\nAfter nearly dying from a traumatic attack, Christine (played by Nicole Kidman) now suffers from anterograde amnesia—she can't remember anything after her early 20s (even her husband, Ben) and she can't form new memories. But as flashes and snippets start to trickle back in, she realizes everything (and everyone) may not be as it seems.\n\nWhere The Crawdads Sing (2022)\n\nAbandoned in a North Carolina marshland as a young girl, Kya raises herself totally isolated from anyone else. But as she grows up, a friendship (and maybe even more) starts to blossom with two of the boys in town. That is, until one of them (the son of a rich, well-known family) is found dead and Kya quickly becomes suspect number one.\n\nZootopia (2016)\n\nI tell everyone to watch this Disney movie at least once because it's. just. that. good. Somehow, the film manages to balance a slightly dark murder mystery with comedy and charm from the two protagonists. Add in subtle themes of racism and stereotyping with cutesy anthropomorphic animals, and you somehow get a kid-approved murder mystery masterpiece.\n\nDeep Water (2022)\n\nBen Affleck, my man…you gotta get some new roles. Once again, the star is playing a sulky husband in a messed-up marriage (re: Gone Girl). Only this time, he is being investigated for the murder of his wife’s lover, rather than the wife herself. Did he do it? Did the wife do it? Hell, is the lover even dead?? So many Qs.\n\nBasic Instinct (1992)\n\nThis movie is all about a police detective investigating (and having a relationship with) the widow of a former rock star who may or may not have brutally murdered her husband. Ah, romance!\n\nDark Places (2015)\n\nBased on Gillian Flynn’s novel of the same name, it follows the story of Libby Day, who, when she was 8, told police that her brother was responsible for her parents’ murder. But now that she’s grown up, she’s not so sure that’s the truth.\n\nA Simple Favor (2018)\n\nBlake Lively is perfection in the role of Emily—the super-cool, mysterious mom who just up and vanishes one day. But as things progress, they get a little more murder-y and a whole lot more confusing.\n\nIn the Heat of the Night (1967)\n\nVirgil Tibbs, a Black police detective in Philadelphia, is wrongfully accused of murder by a racist police chief in Mississippi. Once he proves his innocence, he joins up with the police chief to figure out exactly who the real killer is.\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs (1991)\n\nSerial killer Buffalo Bill is on the loose, and young FBI trainee Clarice Starling is trying to catch him. She has to enlist the help of another cannibalistic serial killer to give her some insight that could help her find him. And yes, this is the movie where the iconic line “Hello, Clarice” comes from.\n\nZodiac (2007)\n\nBased on the very real (and still very much unsolved) Zodiac Killer case, this movie will have you wanting to solve the crime IRL. It’s also got a stacked cast with Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo, and Robert Downey Jr. in leading roles.\n\nCharade (1963)\n\nAudrey Hepburn stuns in this movie as Regina “Reggie” Lampert, an American expat in Paris whose husband turns up murdered right as he was trying to leave the city. He had mysteriously sold off all his belongings, but the money is missing. You’ll come for the mystery but stay for the rapport between Audrey and Cary Grant.\n\nClue (1985)\n\nYes, like the classic murder mystery board game. This comedy murder mystery comes complete with multiple endings and a plot that will have you laughing and guessing start to finish.\n\nGone Girl (2014)\n\nBased on Gillian Flynn’s best seller of the same name, Gone Girl is a murder mystery that also tackles some of life’s bigger mysteries—like what goes on in the dark, deep soul of a troubled marriage.\n\nKnives Out (2019)\n\nThis highly stylized murder mystery was an instant classic, and Ana de Armas is a damn delight.\n\nThe Girl on the Train (2016)\n\nHow do you solve a murder when you’re the only witness and you can’t trust your own memory?
