        "text": "17 super-rich directors\n\nEveryone knows the names and faces of the world's richest actors, but what about the brains behind the camera?\n\nWe're shining the spotlight on the 17 richest directors in Hollywood today, giving some special attention to the creative minds behind iconic movies such as Avatar, Star Wars, and The Dark Knight.\n\nRead on to find out who they are and discover the blockbusters that helped build their empires. Popcorn at the ready, people...\n\nAll dollar amounts in US dollars.\n\nTodd Phillips: $200 million (£157m)\n\nAmerican director Todd Phillips first gained recognition with Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies, a 1993 documentary about the controversial punk rock singer GG Allin.\n\nNew York native Phillips then transitioned into comedy, helming rambunctious flicks like 2000's Road Trip and 2003's Old School. However, his most famous comedy offering is undoubtedly the critically acclaimed The Hangover film trilogy, which was released between 2009 and 2013.\n\nTaking his creative pursuits in a new direction, Phillips directed the 2019 psychological thriller Joker, which earned him a Best Director nomination at the Academy Awards. He recently also directed its sequel, Joker: Folie à Deux, which is set to release later this year.\n\nTodd Phillips: $200 million (£157m)\n\nPhillips owes most of his vast fortune to The Hangover trilogy. He savvily traded an upfront salary for back-end points, meaning he took home a share of the box office profits – a decision that's had him laughing all the way to the bank. The Hangover (pictured) became a surprise blockbuster and spawned two sequels, with Phillips earning $150 million (£118m) from the comedy franchise as a result.\n\nThe director cut a similar back-end profit deal for Joker. The hit film grossed over $1 billion (£790 million) at the box office, reportedly banking Phillips a juicy $50 million (£39 million).\n\nHis estimated net worth currently stands at $200 million (£157m). However, this figure is likely to soar, with reports suggesting he'll earn yet another bumper payday for the upcoming Joker sequel.\n\nRon Howard: $200 million (£157m)\n\nRon Howard started out as an actor, rising to fame for playing Richie Cunningham in the American sitcom Happy Days between 1974 and 1984.\n\nHowever, Howard realised his passion for working behind the camera and made his directorial debut in 1977 with the comedy flick Grand Theft Auto, which he also wrote and starred in. Despite its low budget, the film was a huge hit, marking the start of a successful directing career for Howard.\n\nToday, he's a critically acclaimed director known for his diverse filmography. Highlights include the 1995 space drama Apollo 13, the 2000 holiday classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas, the 2001 biopic A Beautiful Mind (which won him the Academy Award for Best Director), and the 2006 blockbuster The Da Vinci Code, based on the best-selling novel by Dan Brown.\n\nRon Howard: $200 million (£157m)\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Oscar-winner commands hefty paychecks for helming projects. For example, he reportedly earned $10 million (£8m) apiece for directing the 2001 biopic A Beautiful Mind (pictured) and the 2011 comedy flick The Dilemma.\n\nThe business-savvy Howard has invested his earnings into entertainment ventures, further growing his fortune. He's the co-founder of the film and television production company Imagine Entertainment, which is behind hit films like 8 Mile and Friday Night Lights, as well as popular TV series such as 24 and Arrested Development.\n\nHis decade-spanning career has earned him an estimated net worth of $200 million (£157m).\n\nRoland Emmerich: $200 million (£157m)\n\nGerman filmmaker Roland Emmerich is famed for his pulse-racing action and sci-fi films. He started out directing low-budget movies in Germany, though quickly shot to global stardom thanks to his 1996 alien blockbuster Independence Day.\n\nHis impressive filmography includes a slew of big-budget bonanzas, such as the 1998 \"creature feature\" Godzilla, the 2004 disaster movie The Day After Tomorrow, and most recently, the 2022 sci-fi epic Moonfall.\n\nWhile his movies have been criticised for focusing on special effects over substance, they've still been nominated for accolades including BAFTAs and MTV Movie Awards.\n\nRoland Emmerich: $200 million (£157m)\n\nEmmerich's estimated net worth stands at a stunning $200 million (£157m).\n\nThe biggest payday of his career came in 2009 for his work on the sci-fi disaster blockbuster 2012 (pictured). Emmerich negotiated a savvy back-end profit deal to take home a slice of the movie's earnings. When the action extravaganza banked $770 million (£605m) globally, he walked away with $70 million (£55m).\n\nEmmerich, who described himself as \"openly gay\" at the 2015 Toronto Film Festival, has donated millions to supporting LGBTQ+ youth, with his philanthropy including donations to the Elton John AIDS Foundation.\n\nOutside of his charitable efforts, he also actively campaigns to have the Academy Awards recognise stunt performers for their work in films.\n\nRob Reiner: $200 million (£157m)\n\nAnother director who started out as an actor is Rob Reiner, who found fame playing Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic on All in the Family, which was the most-watched TV show in America between 1971 and 1976. His performance earned him two Emmy nominations.\n\nIn 1984, Reiner made his directing debut with the cult classic mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap, which he co-wrote and starred in.\n\nDespite his comedic roots, Reiner hasn't shied away from tackling a diverse range of genres throughout his directing career. His filmography highlights include the 1987 fantasy adventure The Princess Bride, the 1989 rom-com When Harry Met Sally..., the 1990 psychological thriller Misery, and the 1992 legal drama A Few Good Men.\n\nRob Reiner: $200 million (£157m)\n\nReiner regularly commands millions of dollars to direct films. For instance, he took home a cool $4 million (£3m) for his Oscar-nominated work on the legal thriller A Few Good Men, which starred Tom Cruise (pictured).\n\nBeyond his directing endeavours, Reiner co-founded the production company, Castle Rock Entertainment. Castle Rock, a powerhouse in the entertainment industry, is behind hit movies like Miss Congeniality and The Shawshank Redemption, as well as the beloved comedy series Seinfeld.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, given his impressive portfolio, Reiner's estimated total fortune stands at $200 million (£157m).\n\nMartin Scorsese: $200 million (£157m)\n\nMartin Scorsese stands as one of the most renowned filmmakers in history. He shot to prominence in the 1970s thanks to the success of crime flicks such as Mean Streets and Taxi Driver, which put him firmly on the map.\n\nThrough the decades, Scorsese has solidified his status as an all-time great by helming cinematic classics such as the 1980 sports drama Raging Bull and the 1990 crime thriller Goodfellas. More recent offerings include the 2019 crime biopic The Irishman and the 2023 Western drama Killers of the Flower Moon.\n\nScorsese's undeniable talent has earned him 10 Academy Award nominations for Best Director, making him the most nominated living director in history. He's won the coveted Oscar just once, receiving the accolade for his work on the 2006 gritty crime drama The Departed.\n\nMartin Scorsese: $200 million (£157m)\n\nNaturally, Scorsese can command millions of dollars per movie. For his work on the 2010 thriller Shutter Island, for example, he reportedly earned a cool $3.5 million (£3m) upfront salary.\n\nThe following year, Scorsese, most renowned for his movies in the crime genre, took a departure from his usual style to direct the fantasy adventure Hugo (pictured). The film was a critical darling, receiving 11 Oscar nominations and winning five. Meanwhile, Scorsese earned $10 million (£8m) for his directing efforts.\n\nWith a slew of cinematic masterpieces under his belt, it's no wonder that this powerhouse director's estimated net worth is $200 million (£157m).\n\nLana and Lilly Wachowski: $250 million (£196m)\n\nLana and Lilly Wachowski are a formidable duo in the world of filmmaking.\n\nThe movie-directing sisters catapulted to fame with the mind-bending The Matrix trilogy between 1999 and 2003. A fourth entry in the franchise was released in 2021, though Lana (pictured) was its sole director.\n\nOutside of that, they've crafted various other big-budget sci-fi projects. This includes 2008's Speed Racer, based on the Japanese anime series, the genre-defying epic Cloud Atlas in 2012, and the ambitious Netflix series Sense8, which aired from 2015 to 2018.\n\nLana and Lilly Wachowski: $250 million (£196m)\n\nCombined, the Wachowski sisters are worth an impressive $250 million (£196m).\n\nMost of their fortune stems from their work on the Matrix franchise (pictured). In total, the four films in the series have earned almost $1.8 billion (£1.4bn) globally, with the sisters taking home a healthy slice of the box office proceeds.\n\nIn addition to their success with The Matrix, Lana and Lilly have further profited from a spin-off video game franchise based on the sci-fi series.\n\nChristopher Nolan: $250 million (£196m)\n\nBritish director Christopher Nolan began his directing career in 1998 with the low-budget thriller Following. However, it was his next project, the 2000 psychological thriller Memento, that truly put him on the map.\n\nHis career soared to new heights when he directed The Dark Knight trilogy between 2005 and 2012. These films are now regarded as some of the best superhero movies ever made, with Nolan's dark and gritty take on the Batman story receiving widespread acclaim.\n\nKnown for his penchant for mind-bending narratives, more of Nolan's notable works include 2010's Inception and 2014's Interstellar. However, he doesn't confine himself to one genre. For example, he directed the WWII epic Dunkirk in 2017, which earned him his first Best Director nomination at the Oscars.\n\nMore recently, he delved into biopics with 2023's Oppenheimer, which secured him his first-ever Best Director Oscar win.\n\nChristopher Nolan: $250 million (£196m)\n\nNot only did Nolan score his first Best Director Oscar for Oppenheimer (pictured), but the movie also earned him the biggest payday of his career to date.\n\nCelebrity Net Worth reports that Nolan negotiated a savvy deal that saw him earn a $20 million (£16m) upfront salary for the biopic. He also inked an agreement with Universal to receive 15% of the first dollar gross; first dollar gross refers to the gross revenue earned by a movie after movie theatres take a 50% cut, but precedes any deductions for studio costs like marketing or budget recouping. His wife Emma also received a 5% share of the first dollar gross for her work as a producer on the film.\n\nOppenheimer swiftly became a blockbuster hit, grossing $1 billion (£790m) at the box office. Combined, Christopher and Emma are expected to earn a staggering $125 million (£99m), meaning that Oppenheimer is responsible for half of Nolan's estimated $250 million (£196m) net worth.\n\nJ. J. Abrams: $300 million (£237m)\n\nJ. J. Abrams began his career in the 1990s as a screenwriter before transitioning to directing. He made his debut with the action-packed blockbuster Mission: Impossible III in 2006, which marked the beginning of his prolific career behind the camera.\n\nAbrams became a household name in 2009 when he successfully rebooted the Star Trek franchise, helming both Star Trek and its 2013 sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness.\n\nIn 2015, Abrams helmed another beloved sci-fi franchise when he was chosen to direct Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens. The film was a critical and commercial hit, cementing Abrams' status as one of the greatest sci-fi directors of all time.\n\nJ. J. Abrams: $300 million (£237m)\n\nGiven that he's relaunched two successful sci-fi franchises, it's no surprise that Abrams has an estimated total fortune of $300 million (£237m).\n\nIn addition to directing, Abrams co-founded the production company Bad Robot in 2001. The company is behind numerous hit TV shows, most notably the cultural sensation Lost, which aired between 2004 and 2010.\n\nIn 2019, J.J. Abrams signed an exclusive five-year deal with WarnerMedia that was reportedly worth $250 million (£196m). Under the deal, Abrams and the Bad Robot team have also created content for WarnerMedia, including the HBO Max series Lovecraft Country, which Abrams co-produced.\n\nRidley Scott: $400 million (£318m)\n\nBritish filmmaker Ridley Scott made his directorial debut with the 1977 historical drama The Duellists, which he followed up with the sci-fi horror Alien two years later. The latter firmly established him as an exciting new talent in the industry.\n\nSince those early days of his career, Scott has gone on to produce cinematic gems across a diverse range of genres. Standouts include the 1982 neo-noir sci-fi classic Blade Runner, the 1991 crime comedy Thelma & Louise, and the 2000 historical epic Gladiator. The latter film won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and remains one of Scott's most influential works to date.\n\nMost recently, Scott directed a sequel to Gladiator, which is set to hit screens later this year. The star-studded movie features Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal, and Denzel Washington.\n\nRidley Scott: $400 million (£318m)\n\nScott's estimated total fortune stands at $400 million (£318m).\n\nA significant chunk of his wealth comes from his production company, Ridley Scott Associates (RSA), which generates over $100 million (£79m) annually.\n\nRSA and its various divisions make everything from movies and TV shows to music videos and adverts. In terms of the latter, the company has crafted commercials for a slew of high-profile brands, including fashion houses Louis Vuitton and Alexander McQueen, tech giant Samsung, and soft drink brand Fanta.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola: $400 million (£318m)\n\nAmerican director Francis Ford Coppola first found fame as a screenwriter, winning a Best Orginal Screenplay Academy Award for the 1970 war drama Patton.\n\nCoppola is undoubtedly best known for helming the iconic The Godfather trilogy, based on Mario Puzo's crime novel of the same name. The first film, released in 1972, won three Oscars, including Best Picture. Its sequel scored six Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Picture; the third instalment, released in 1990, received seven Oscar nominations, although failed to win any.\n\nCoppola also co-wrote and directed the 1979 Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now, which is widely regarded as one of the best films of all time. The movie won two Oscars and the prestigious Palme d'Or Award.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola: $400 million (£318m)\n\nCoppola's estimated net worth stands at an incredible $400 million (£318m).\n\nIn addition to directing, the business-savvy movie maker has expanded his fortune through winemaking. Using the proceeds from the original Godfather movie (pictured), he purchased a vineyard in Napa Valley, California, in 1975, later going on to acquire a number of wineries in the region.\n\nHowever, Coppola recently sold a significant chunk of his wine empire to fund a passion project movie titled Megalopolis. He penned the film's script back in the 1980s, although struggled to find financial backing. Reports claim he has invested an eye-watering $120 million (£95m) of his own money into the project.\n\nDetails about Megalopolis are scarce, although we know it stars Adam Driver, Shia LaBeouf, and Aubrey Plaza, and is expected to be released in late 2024.\n\nMel Gibson: $425 million (£338m)\n\nMel Gibson is renowned for his work on both sides of the camera. He began his career on-screen, gaining fame for his leading roles in movies like Mad Max and Lethal Weapon.\n\nHe soon branched out, both directing and starring in the historical epic Braveheart in 1995. The movie earned two Academy Awards, Best Director and Best Picture, which cemented Gibson's status as a multi-talented star.\n\nHe also received critical acclaim for his work behind the camera on 2004's The Passion of the Christ, which became the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time. Just over a decade later, his 2016 war film Hacksaw Ridge earned six Oscar nominations.\n\nMel Gibson: $425 million (£338m)\n\nGibson's estimated net worth is a phenomenal $425 million (£338m). Despite his successful on-screen career, most of his fortune is derived from his directing efforts, notably for his work on The Passion of the Christ (pictured).\n\nGibson is said to have invested $45 million (£36m) of his personal fortune into the project, giving him ownership of 50% of the film's gross, while the other 50% went to distributor Newmarket Films. Gibson's gamble seriously paid off when the film grossed $611.5 million (£486m) globally, with Mel taking home around $300 million (£237m).\n\nWhat's more, he earned between $50 million (£40m) to $100 million (£79m) from merchandise sales, as well as a further $75 million (£60m) from DVD sales associated with the project.\n\nMichael Bay: $450 million (£357m)\n\nAmerican filmmaker Michael Bay is renowned for masterminding pulse-racing movies. While he's been criticised for his films' emphasis on style over substance and heavy reliance on CGI, Bay is one of Hollywood's most commercially successful directors, with a string of blockbuster hits under his belt.\n\nHe made his directing debut in 1995 with the crime comedy Bad Boys. He then went on to direct numerous action-packed extravaganzas, including the 1998 sci-fi flick Armageddon and the 2001 war epic Pearl Harbor.\n\nHowever, he's undoubtedly best known for his work on the Transformers franchise. Bay directed the first film in the series back in 2007 and has gone on to oversee its numerous sequels, including Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009), Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014), and Transformers: The Last Knight (2017).\n\nMichael Bay: $450 million (£357m)\n\nBack in the 90s, Bay earned a mere $100,000 (£79k) for Bad Boys, which is a pittance compared to what he commands today.\n\nWhen Bay directed Pearl Harbor (pictured) in 2001, he earned a juicy $25 million (£20m) salary (as reported by Celebrity Net Worth), having negotiated a deal to take home a slice of the movie's box office gross.\n\nToday, he continues to command multi-million-dollar paychecks for his work, with his total estimated fortune standing at a mammoth $450 million (£357m).\n\nJames Cameron: $800 million (£634m)\n\nPioneering filmmaker James Cameron stands as one of Hollywood's most successful directors, renowned for his innovative approach to special effects. He rose to fame in the 1980s with projects like The Terminator and Aliens, both of which he not only directed but also wrote.\n\nIn 1997, Cameron's career soared to new heights with the release of his historical epic Titanic. The film captivated audiences around the world, becoming one of the highest-grossing films in history and clinching an incredible 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nIn more recent years, Cameron has primarily focused on his groundbreaking Avatar franchise. The first instalment, released in 2009, was acclaimed for its cutting-edge special effects, earning Cameron yet another Best Director nomination. With the sequel Avatar: The Way of Water making waves in 2022, Cameron has ambitious plans for at least two more entries in the series.\n\nJames Cameron: $800 million (£634m)\n\nCameron is the fifth richest filmmaker in Hollywood, boasting an estimated net worth of $800 million (£634m).\n\nFor the blockbuster hit Titanic in 1997, he raked in a stunning $115 million (£91m). This impressive sum includes an $8 million (£6m) upfront directing fee (which he gave back when the movie sailed past its budget) and a generous share of the film's box office gross. However, compared to his earnings from the Avatar franchise (pictured), this is just a drop in the ocean.\n\nTo date, Cameron has pocketed around $350 million (£277m) from the first Avatar film. With more movies still in the works, it's possible that he'll reach billionaire status soon.\n\nAnd speaking of billionaires, let's delve into the directors who have already joined the exclusive 10-figure club...\n\nTyler Perry: $1.4 billion (£1bn)\n\nActor and director Tyler Perry is best known for his wacky Madea comedy franchise.\n\nThe saga began with the release of Diary of a Mad Black Woman in 2005, with Perry taking on multiple roles as producer, writer, and star. The film was a huge success and has spawned numerous sequels.\n\nTo date, there have been 13 films in the franchise. Perry has been involved in every aspect of these movies, handling everything from acting and directing to writing and producing. As a result, he owns 100% of the content. Per Forbes, the Madea franchise has grossed more than $660 million (£523m).\n\nTyler Perry: $1.4 billion (£1bn)\n\nPerry's net worth stands at an impressive $1.4 billion (£1bn), according to Forbes.\n\nIn addition to his thriving career in acting and directing, the savvy businessman owns his own eponymous film studio in Atlanta. The state-of-the-art facility features 12 sound stages and custom sets, including a life-size replica of the White House.\n\nHis latest lucrative deal was inking a content creation agreement with Viacom in 2019 in exchange for a 25% stake in the streaming service BET+.\n\nPeter Jackson: $1.5 billion (£1.2bn)\n\nNew Zealand filmmaker Peter Jackson is currently ranked as the world's third-richest filmmaker. He started his career with low-budget horror comedies in the 1980s and 1990s, including Bad Taste and Braindead.\n\nHowever, Jackson is best known for his groundbreaking work on the hit fantasy series The Lord of the Rings, as well as its spin-off, The Hobbit. Per Forbes, these franchises have grossed over $6 billion (£5bn) combined. Jackson's work on 2003's The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King was particularly acclaimed, with the movie earning 11 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nAway from Middle Earth, 2005 saw Jackson direct the blockbuster King Kong, an epic big-budget remake of the 1933 classic.\n\nPeter Jackson: $1.5 billion (£1.2bn)\n\nJackson is worth an astonishing $1.5 billion (£1.2bn), according to Forbes.\n\nHe made $10 million (£8m) up front for each The Lord of the Rings film between 2001 and 2003, as well as a 10% slice of the box office gross. And his salary for helming The Hobbit trilogy increased to an incredible $20 million (£16m) per movie, with a 20% backend.\n\nJackson reached billionaire status in 2021 after he sold a portion of his digital effects company, Weta, to Unity Software for $1.6 billion (£1.3bn) in cash and stock. Weta famously used motion picture capture of actor Andy Serkis to create the on-screen visualisation of the character Gollum in both The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.\n\nSteven Spielberg: $4.8 billion (£4bn)\n\nThe winner of three Academy Awards – including two for Best Director – Steven Spielberg is one of the most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema, with his films grossing over $10 billion (£8bn) worldwide.\n\nHe began his career in the 1970s and first gained major recognition for the chilling Jaws, which was released in 1975. Since then, he's helmed many iconic blockbusters, including the 1982 sci-fi hit E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, the 1993 blockbuster Jurassic Park, and the 1998 war epic Saving Private Ryan.\n\nA diverse director who's seemingly unafraid to tackle any genre, his more recent offerings include a 2021 remake of the iconic musical West Side Story and the 2022 semi-autobiographical drama The Fabelmans.\n\nSteven Spielberg: $4.8 billion (£4bn\n\nToday, Spielberg is worth $4.8 billion (£4bn), making him the second-richest director in the world.\n\nIn addition to his directing career, Spielberg earns a slice of revenue from every ticket sold at Universal theme parks, thanks to a lucrative \"theme park consulting deal\" (as reported by the New York Post). He also serves as chairman of DreamWorks, the film studio that he co-founded in 1994.\n\nSurprisingly, Spielberg has also made millions from the 1977 space opera Star Wars: A New Hope, despite never being involved in the project.\n\nHow? Back in the late 1970s, George Lucas was reportedly nervous about his upcoming movie Star Wars flopping. At the time, Spielberg was in the midst of making his own sci-fi movie, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. In a friendly wager, the two directors agreed to swap 2.5% of the profits from their respective films. When Star Wars became a blockbuster success, Spielberg walked away with a $40 million (£32m) cut.\n\nGeorge Lucas: $5.6 billion (£4.4bn).\n\nClaiming the top spot as the richest director in the world is George Lucas.\n\nLucas shot to stardom with the release of his space opera Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope in 1977. The film was a massive success and has gone on to spawn numerous spin-offs and sequels on both the silver screen and the small screen. In fact, it's widely regarded as one of the most influential franchises in cinematic history.\n\nAnd as if creating one epic film franchise wasn't enough, Lucas later teamed up with his directing buddy Spielberg for the hugely popular and successful Indiana Jones franchise, which currently comprises five movies in total.\n\nGeorge Lucas: $5.6 billion (£4.4bn).\n\nPer Forbes, Lucas is worth an eye-watering $5.6 billion (£4.4bn).\n\nMost of his wealth stems from his production company, Lucasfilm, which he founded in 1971. He built his massive fortune through movie franchises produced by the company, including Star Wars (pictured) and Indiana Jones, as well as their associated merchandise.\n\nToday, Lucas has largely retired from filmmaking. In 2012, he sold Lucasfilm to Disney in a juggernaut deal that was worth $4.1 billion (£3bn) in stock and cash."
