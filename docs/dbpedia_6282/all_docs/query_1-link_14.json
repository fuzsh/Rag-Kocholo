        "text": "Spoilers ahead.\n\nIt's a weirdly compelling gimmick to have a series of films about a character who never appears, and yet have them all (but one) star the same actor. That is exactly what Columbia did with the Whistler series, based on a radio program in which (based on what I learned from Wikipedia) an all-seeing, all-knowing character comments archly on the action. Though the Whistler himself is only a voice in the films, Richard Dix stars in seven of the eight of them (the last seven films of his career), in each playing the main character in the story the Whistler is telling.\n\nIn this, the first installment of the series, Dix is Earl Conrad, an industrialist who lost…\n\nOf all the “b” series the Hollywood studios produced during their Golden Age, The Whistler is probably my favorite. It may have begun as Columbia’s answer to Universal’s Inner Sanctum series, a group of self-contained films based on a radio show that featured a recurring lead (Lon Chaney Jr) in a variety of roles, but The Whistler quickly surpassed the Inner Sanctum in quality and consistency. The credit should go to William Castle, who directed four of the first five entries. In his pre-gimmick days, Castle had a knack for noir, but he also brought his taste for the macabre to the series, which other directors had the good sense to hold on to. The first seven entries also benefitted…\n\nThe Whistler? More like The Mid-ler\n\n(I am running on 5 hours of sleep)\n\n———————\n\nThe Whistler is a little film noir film by William Castle. I thoroughly enjoyed House on Haunted Hill, and was surprised by how well made it was, specifically the direction, so I was interested in the premise of the whisperer films and figured it would be worth the watch.\n\nThe film follows a man who hires a hit man to kill himself following the death of his wife. As the story goes on and the man realizes his wife is still alive he must attempt to call off the hit that he put on his own life, realizing how much there is for him to…"
