        "text": "The Burning Season (WFF): 2 ½\n\nMAESTRO: This one is rare, for a number of reasons. It shows us much more than most of us ever knew about Leonard Bernstein. Symphony conductor, recordings, those young people's concerts on TV, and writing music for shows like West Side Story. Those I knew, and incidentally they're all downplayed in this film. Instead we get a portrait of a tempestuous marriage brilliantly played by Bradley Cooper (who is also director and co-writer) and Carey Mulligan in a tremendous performance as his wife. He had other lovers, of both genders. She's late to realize that and in a highly emotional speech of self-reflection asks what she did wrong. “Who was lying to who?”\n\nCooper expertly develops the story towards that point. At the start, Bernstein gets a phone call to fill in for an ailing conductor. He's sensational in concert and even a bit flamboyant, a master showman, exultant as he conducts. Mulligan as a young actress who propels herself into his life is just as impressive. As the wife she comes to boil with jealousy. Their story becomes a common melodrama but is bouyed by sharp writing, superb acting and imaginative direction. Several times scenes bleed into the next to move things along. Open a window and the New York skyline spreads out before you. In other words, Bernstein's future, pointed to succinctly. And vibrant concert sequences confirm it. This is only Cooper's second film as director, after A Star Is Born, proving that he's not a one-hit wonder. Expect nominations for him and both of his stars. (In theaters in Toronto and Vancouver now, more cities next week and on Netflix in three weeks) 4 out of 5\n\nSOUTH TO BLACK POWER: Here's an intriguing idea from writer Charles M. Blow on how to improve race relations in the U.S. Enable Blacks to have more control of their lives by giving them more say in how they are governed. How? Reverse migration. Encourage them to move back south from where their ancestors migrated starting over 100 years ago. States like Mississippi, Louisiana and Georgia already have Blacks making up over 30% of the population. Increase that and you've got Black Power, which some people fear because they equate it with white supremacy Not so, he wrote in a newspaper article and then a book.\n\nIn the film he travels through the south hearing local activists explain what is needed. An historian tells how whites have managed to keep control of political power. Advocates lead groups in select cities, several of which are already “bathed in black power.” They need to extend it to the state level. As Blow puts it, Blacks have to forgo the “pleading and begging and marching” and “go right to power.” He himself moved south, to Atlanta, and reports there is already a small reverse migration. People feel safe and “a creeping equality” is forming. The Black middle class is thriving. He visits his old hometown and his relatives. And amply gets across that he feels at home. (An HBO documentary streaming on CRAVE) 3½ out of 5\n\nCANDY CANE LANE: Got some time to waste this holiday season? This silly comedy will do and it stars the ever-welcome Eddie Murphy, in what I'm surprised to read is his first ever Christmas movie. It takes the competition to outdo the neighbors with Christmas light displays to extreme lengths. But the writer, Kelly Younger, apparently drew on reality from the California town where he grew up. So, Murphy wants to beat his neighbor with his display, and, because he's just been laid off from his job and a cable-access TV show is offering a $100,000 prize, he's driven.\n\nHe discovers a pop-up store under a highway overpass that has an answer. Jillian Bell, trying too hard but funny, sells him a tall mockup shaped like a tree featuring all the characters from the “Twelve Days of Christmas.” She cautions to read the fine print; he says nobody does that and the story kicks on.\n\nThe characters from the song materialize for real, some disappear and he learns what was really going on at the store. He's now under a curse and has to find five golden rings. Or he becomes like the “little Christmas people,” tiny figures who spoke to him at the store. Their leader is played by Nick Offerman. The film has some laughs and very good art direction but only very ordinary ingenuity. It's Murphy's first with director Reginald Hudlin since Boomerang, 30 years ago. (steaming on Prime Video) 2 ½ out of 5\n\nFINALITY OF DUSK: I wasn't always sure what was going on here or what the title means, but this film is so well-made and acted that I found it absolutely engrossing. I guess there's a climate change aspect to it because it takes place about 20 years from now after environmental devastation has destroyed lives. We only see a few wandering through a wasteland, having to wear masks that protect them from the toxic air. They are alerted to change the filter regularly and sometimes switch masks to avoid “respiratory failure.” If they need help, they can visit a centre, which we don't see because they don't go there. We never find out how things became like that, how much else still exists nor what those creatures are that we hear howling now and then.\n\nWhat we do get is a struggle to survive by two women. Ishkode is an Ojibway played by Marika Sila an actor from Yellowknife and also a star on Instagram and Tik Tok. With her is Niife, an immigrant from Nigeria played by Cherrel Holder who was born in Trinidad. They can't talk because “they'll hear you.” They converse in sign language. Pursuing them is a man who wants their masks. He's played by deaf activist Chris Dodd. Eventually his motivations are made clear and they go beyond the gun-shooting assailant he seems to be. For now there's tension and fear, well-conjured up by director and co-writer Madison Thomas. She's part Indigenous also, based in Manitoba where she made this film. (It had its Canadian premiere at Whistler last night, screens again tonight and then is available online starting Monday) 3½ out of 5\n\nTHE BURNING SEASON: This is a world premiere at Whistler and especially interesting to watch because it is told backwards. It starts with Chapter 7 and works all the way down to a prologue. It sounds too clever but director Sean Garrity and writers Jonas Chernick and Diana Frances make it work. Chernick also stars as one of four friends (two couples) who every summer meet at a resort somewhere in Ontario cottage country. They seem to have resentments, which we gradually learn about as the film digs back to previous summers. It's artificial, but also an unravelling mystery.\n\nChernick is J.B. who runs the place; Tanisha Thammavongsa is Poppy, who works there. The film opens with their wedding. Sara Canning and Joe Pingue are a couple who took some time to get together, as we gradually discover from earlier years. We also discover that she carried on an affair with J.B. over several summers and the feelings between them are still there. Can they keep it secret? There's tension there, but also some gimmickry. And some perplexing details that arrive in the very early years (i.e. late in the film) and feel awkward. The acting is good though, and the story moves along well, so half a praise from me.
