        "text": "Right after its establishment in 1902 Dire Dawa rapidly grew into a thriving small town. An American diplomat named R.P. Skinner, who passed through the city in 1903 (soon after its establishment) at the head of an American delegation, called it “the Queen of the Desert”. The City has two unique urban quarters having practical and geographical coincidence. The quarters were separated from each other by the Dechatu dry river, the old city Magalla (indigenous, Arab and Indian quarter) is on the south bank of the river; geographically it faces Middle East, while the new city Gezira (meaning island and plateau in Arabic) is on the north bank of the river facing Europe on the world map.The city of Dire Dawa, in the particulars Gezira quarter is the most European of all Ethiopian cities(mainly French, Greeks, Armenians and Italians) with its distinctive urban planning of straight and perpendicular street. It was carefully planned by the railway engineers having asphalt roads and well-aligned building, a drainage system and piped water. The century old railway station and its installations, stores, workshops, many houses with yellow colors, shops, offices, and modern buildings are found in this quarter. The railway company CFE (Chemendefer Franco Ethiopian) has had the mandate to inspect the constructions of all buildings in this quarter and planting trees in the garden were among the requirement expected of new building .This quarter has greatly influenced by European architecture like French provincial style, French Renaissance style, Italian, Greek and Armenian architecture(Gezaw,2017). Partial view of Gezira in 1934 The old city of Magala(CONEIL,Amestegna,Kefira and Dechatu) has a network of twisting streets or criss-crossing alleyways, Arab and Indian style house with light white wall and a rain bow color. A numbers of Secondary Street connected to three main axes meeting at three different nodes to form a sort of triangle. The dominance of Arabs creates the overall setting that resembles an old Arabian urban fabric. Though this quarter has some form of urban planning it will not benefit from the CFE modern urban planning, unlike Gezira it has narrow street which is not always straight, house are closely packed not well aligned, building compound. Thus the sharp contrast between this two historic urban quarters provide tourist with extraordinary experience unlike any other city in Ethiopia. Other than the two historic neighborhood the 1936-41G.C Italian expansion areas such as campo Greco, Addis Ketema ,Haftal Issa,Laga hare and No One need moderate protection.\n\nDire Dawa is a disputed city over claims of ownership between Oromia and Somalia regional states.Hence, among the Oromo and Somali ethnic groups. However, there was no conflict so far experienced between these ethnic groups in the city of Dire Dawa. The article attempted to study the basic reasons for such peaceful state of affairs in the city. To accomplish this objective, the researcher utilized qualitative research method. Sources of dataprimary and secondary sources were used. Primary data as the main source was collected from informants and documents through interviews, observation, focus group discussion, and document analysis. The collected data was analyzed to find common indicators. The study finding revealed that these ethnic groups have developed a sense of belonging to the city of Dire Dawa. They developed a single vocabulary-yeDire-lij-. This single vocabulary was the result of cultural dialogue and understanding they developed over century through their interactions. T...\n\nAbstract The aim of this study is to assess how the rapid urbanization of Addis Ababa affects the culture of Oromo in the Ethiopian federation with particular reference to Addis Ababa and its surrounding. It specifically examines the contribution of federalism for the recognition and development of Oromo culture in and around Addis Ababa. The Thesis not only investigates the role of Oromia National Regional State (ONRS) in retaining Oromo culture but also identifies the challenges of promoting the Oromo Culture in and around Addis Ababa. In order to achieve these objectives, the study mainly relied on qualitative research approach to analyze the data obtained through key informant interview, while those obtained through questionnaire were analyzed through simple statistics. Different primary data collection instruments, including key informant interview and questionnaire were used to obtain primary data sources. It has also utilized different secondary sources including Books, journal Articles and published and nonpublished sources. The ONRS has tried to revive the Oromo culture in the city through opening Afan Oromo schools, revitalizing Gada system and conducting studies if an efforts made by the ONRS to preserve and to promote Oromo culture in the city are not adequate. The study found out that, at present, there are several undermining factors of Oromo culture including politicization of Oromo culture including identity, language, religion and social organization. The Addis Ababa city administration and the federal government are not concerning and giving credit as much as for the efforts of ONRS. The rapid pace of urbanization of Addis Ababa has been in contradiction with the Oromo culture (including identity, language, and religion/Waaqeffannaa in the city as well as with the interest of the surrounding Oromo inhabitants who also want to use, manifest and maintain its culture stuffs, under the current federal system. In contrast to the federal state set up that give equal recognition to diversified cultures and tradition, the centralized political practice, not cooperation of Addis Ababa city administration and federal government are among the challenges to recognize Oromo culture in the Addis Ababa/Finfinnee city. It is, therefore, an argument of this thesis that a multicultural city of Addis Ababa/Finfinnee can be created when the culture of diversified groups including Oromo culture are recognized, freely manifested and treated equally in the city without favoring a certain group culture.\n\nWhen people of different cultures interact, a degree of linguistic and/or cultural adaptation is expected. This paper examines the implication of the relationship between the Aari and the Gama for the naming practices of the former. The Aari people, who speak Araf, came into contact with Amharic-speaking migrants from central and northern Ethiopia (collectively called the Gama) during the southward expansion of Emperor Menelik in the late nineteenth century. Traditionally, the Aari people used names to express their collective history, shared life experiences, major events, and their environment. The incorporation of Aariland into the Ethiopian empire led to economic, political, and cultural domination as well as resistance on the part of the Aari. Personal names that characterize the period of struggle against the dominant migrants became common until the 1974 revolution that ended the Gama hegemony. Afterwards, however, the naming tradition suffered a setback as evidenced in the decline of Aari personal names in favour of Amhara names and the alteration of the spelling and pronunciation of Aari names. The new changes in naming practices compromised the role of the Aari language as an expression of culture and a marker of identity."
