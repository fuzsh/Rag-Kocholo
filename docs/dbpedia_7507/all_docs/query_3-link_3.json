        "text": "Yes, but \"Taipei\" is similar to Taibei. \"Kaohsiung\" has no similarity to Gaoxiong and is supremely confusing for a native Chinese. We don't use \"Peking\" anymore, so why that?\n\nAlso, is there a reason this quiz doesn't save? It happens occasionally with other quizzes, but a second run through saves it. This happened with the Europe one too, when I finish it doesn't save, which is really annoying for an hour long quiz."
