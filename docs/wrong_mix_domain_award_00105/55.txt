The Nobel Prize in Literature, probably the most prestigious prize an author of books can aspire to, has been awarded annually (with some breaks) since 1901, with more than 115 winners. Alfred Nobel's will stipulated that the prize should go "to the person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction", and its winners include not only novelists and poets but also philosophers and politicians. It is also an impressively international list, drawing attention to the authors from around the globe, writing in an array of languages.

The most recent winners have been: the Norwegian novelist, playwright, and poet Jon Fosse (2023), Annie Ernaux (2022), Abdulrazak Gurnah (2021), Louise Gl√ºck (2020), Peter Handke (2019), Olga Tokarczuk (2018), Kazuo Ishiguro (2017), Bob Dylan (2016), Svetlana Alexievich (2015).
