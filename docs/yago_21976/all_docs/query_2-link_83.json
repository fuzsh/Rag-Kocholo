        "text": "Love’s Labor’s Lost\n\nThe labor's of love are lost—for the boys. At the end of the play, Jack does not get Jill; these girls have bigger plans. “Assist me, some extemporal God of Rhyme, for I am sure I shall turn sonnet.\"\n\nFor a synopsis, see Wikipedia.\n\nFor those of you who provide parts a scene at a time, this Character Chart shows all the characters' lines in each scene: Love's Labor's Lost\n\nIf your group reads the plays straight through in one sitting and you want to divide up the parts, we have a number of “cast” lists already divided up for you. These are text files that you can edit to suit your group. We always recommend in a straight-through read that each participant take a moment beforehand to mark their parts—then everything proceeds so smoothly.\n\n• Cast for 6, plus a Reader for stage directions.\n\n• Cast for 8, plus a Reader for stage directions.\n\n• Cast for 10, plus a Reader for stage directions.\n\n• Cast for 12, plus a Reader for stage directions.\n\nThis is one of Shakespeare's three plays that has an original plot (besides A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Tempest), so there is no source material to peruse.\n\nThis play holds one of the longest word in English literature: honorificabilitudinitatibus, spoken by Costard the rustic fellow. This word is not in the OED (Oxford English Dictionary: The definitive record of the English language), although the word honorificabilitudinity is. It is not the longest word in the English language (heck, there's antidisestablishmentarianism and supercalifragilisticexpialidocious)."
