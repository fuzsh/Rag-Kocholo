        "text": "Shakespeare\n\nIn 1984 Branagh joined the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), where he won acclaim for his performances in Hamlet and Henry V. Often compared to famed actor Laurence Olivier (whom he would later portray), Branagh was noted for his magnetic and often whimsical performances. In 1987 he left the RSC to cofound the Renaissance Theatre Company, for which he served as actor, writer, and director.\n\nIn 1989 Branagh brought Shakespeare’s Henry V to the big screen. The movie received critical acclaim, and Branagh was nominated for Academy Awards as best director and best actor. He married his costar in the movie, Emma Thompson, that same year. The two subsequently appeared together in many film and stage productions. They divorced in 1995.\n\nBranagh continued to concentrate on Shakespeare’s works in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. He wrote and directed In the Bleak Midwinter (1995; U.S. title A Midwinter’s Tale), about a production of Hamlet staged in a local church. He adapted, acted in, and directed film versions of Much Ado About Nothing (1993), Hamlet (1996), and Love’s Labour’s Lost (2000). He received an Oscar nomination in 1997 for best adapted screenplay for Hamlet. In 1995 Branagh appeared as Iago in the film Othello, and in 2006 he adapted and directed the film As You Like It.\n\nMotion Pictures\n\nBranagh’s early film career outside of Shakespearean works included directing and acting in the motion pictures Dead Again (1991) and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1994). In 1998 he appeared in several films, including the drama The Proposition and the dramedy Celebrity. In 2002 he had roles in the drama Rabbit-Proof Fence and in the adventure fantasy Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, a film adaptation of J.K. Rowling’s popular children’s book.\n\nIn 2007 Branagh directed Michael Caine and Jude Law in Sleuth. It was a remake of the 1972 film about a mystery author who gets revenge on his wife’s younger lover. In 2011 Branagh directed Thor, a film adaptation of a comic book about the Norse god. That same year he appeared as Olivier in My Week with Marilyn. The movie dramatizes the behind-the-scenes filming of The Prince and the Showgirl (1957). Branagh’s role earned him an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor.\n\nIn 2014 Branagh directed the action thriller Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, in which he also appeared as a vicious Russian banker. He later directed Cinderella (2015), an adaptation of the classic fairy tale. In 2017 Branagh portrayed a British naval commander in Dunkirk, a World War II drama about the evacuation of Allied troops from France. That same year he directed and starred as the renowned detective Hercule Poirot in Murder on the Orient Express, based on Agatha Christie’s 1933 novel. Branagh then directed and starred in All Is True (2018), which centers on Shakespeare’s final years.\n\nIn 2020 Branagh directed the family adventure Artemis Fowl and appeared in the sci-fi thriller Tenet. The following year he earned acclaim for Belfast, which he wrote and directed. The drama is set in Belfast during the conflict between Protestants—who wanted Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom—and Roman Catholics—who wanted Northern Ireland to become part of the republic of Ireland. Branagh earned Academy Award nominations for best picture (he served as a producer) and best original screenplay, making him the first person to receive Oscar nominations in seven different categories during his career. He also earned his second nomination for best director. He ultimately won an Academy Award for his screenplay. In 2022 Branagh reprised the role of Poirot in Death on the Nile, which he also directed.\n\nBranagh wrote several books about the making of his films. His autobiography, Beginning, was published in 1989. He was knighted in 2012."
