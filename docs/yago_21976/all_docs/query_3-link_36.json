        "text": "I didn't see BELFAST because I have little/no interest in BELFAST.\n\nI did see his remakes of DEATH ON THE NILE and MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS because I am an Agatha Christie fan. I feared the worst--and got it. These are dreadful, dreadful films: poorly cast, poorly written (by others) and very poorly directed by Branagh. NILE in particular is godawful.\n\nHe's directed a lot, but any number of these projects are forgettable/forgotten.\n\nRemember his remake of SLEUTH? Nope, me neither.\n\n[quote][R48], you're right about the snobbery aimed at him, but he's not the first working class actor to deal with that in the UK. It didn't help that he penned his first autobiography while still in his 20s, which made him look very full of himself.\n\nHe made it clear he wrote the book to help fund the Renaissance company.\n\nEven if he hadn't done that a lot of the media were desperate for him to fail. They took relish in the bad reviews for Peter's Friends and then Frankenstein, which was a poor film but looked amazing on the big screen.\n\nBranagh broke out in Hollywood in the late 1980s. He was nominated for actor and director of his first feature, Henry V, which was used by some to build a narrative of him being the \"next Laurence Olivier\" (he would play him eventually in My Week with Marilyn). Along with the rising star of his wife Emma Thompson, they were a new generation of Hollywood-British royalty. Written by first-time feature screenwriter Scott Frank (who would eventually write Little Man Tate, Malice, Get Shorty, Out of Sight, Minority Report, Logan, The Queen's Gambit), Dead Again was a campy thriller, critics loved it, and it was a box-office hit. Peter's Friends was a more intimate film that was respected, but underwhelmed in some respects. Much Ado About Nothing was a return to Shakespeare and a summer hit. That was four films starring both Branagh and Thompson. She was essentially his good luck charm.\n\nFor his fifth film, he directed an adaptation of Frankenstein. The film was a flop with critics, as well as domestic box-office (it did better internationally). It was also the film where he began his affair with costar Helena Bonham Carter, which ended his marriage to Thompson. From there, Branagh's career wouldn't be the same. His adaptation of Hamlet got a lot of press for being a reported \"word for word\" adaptation. No dollar was spared in the production, but audiences didn't show up. He had a few other misfires, some more forgettable than others.\n\nIn 2011, he jumped into the Marvel universe and directed his first hit in almost two decades, Thor. From there, he would take on more commercial ventures and had multiple successes, including adaptations of Cinderella and Murder on the Orient Express. He made the very personal Belfast in 2021. After eight Oscar nods in seven different categories, he won the Oscar for best Original Screenplay.\n\nHis films have mostly never done anything for me, except I do remember seeing Peter's Friends at the cinema and it being one of the first times I saw a sympathetic portrayal of a gay man on screen and that feeling meaningful at the time."
