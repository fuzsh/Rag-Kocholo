        "text": "This intimate, revelatory portrait of William Shakespeare in the last act of his life links closely with the life of Kenneth Branagh himself as he explained to us from the Red Carpet entry to the movie.\n\nWatch the trailer for All Is True with Kenneth Branagh as a late-life Bard.\n\nDo you see yourself as somehow related to Shakespeare at this stage in your life and Shakespeare’s stage of life in the movie? After all, you have brought Shakespeare’s plays to life throughout your career and now you are playing him. Why?\n\nThere is a connection between my professional career with Shakespeare professional life and the man and his personal life.\n\nWhen he retired to his home town, he was a huge celebrity. But he had to go back to the family he left for 20 years. He was an absentee husband and father. His two daughters were both involved in sexual scandals. He left his second best man to care for his wife. He dealt in an ongoing way with the death of his son.\n\nPeople know him as a genius but they know little about his private life. Who was the man behind the genius? That was the attraction for me. The facts but also the emotion behind the plays.\n\nI come from a working-class background. My parents didn’t go to the theater, didn’t know who Shakespeare was. Shakesperare was also from a small town and came from modest beginnings.\n\nI became interested in Shakespeare’s work when I was a young actor. When I was 16 I played the role of Cassio in Othello. Later I played Iago in a film of Othello directed by Oliver Parker. Laurence Fishburne played Othello.\n\nAlso at 16 I hitchhiked from my home in Redding, just outside London, to Stratford-upon-Avon. I took the route that Shakespeare would have taken when he was going home from London to Stratford where he was born. Back in 1613 it would have taken him about three days and he used to go back once a year, we think.\n\nI went to Stratford to see the plays of the Royal Shakespeare Theater and to visit the places where Shakespeare the man had lived, the house that he was born in, the house that he bought when he was wealthy and retired and a great celebrity and his wife, Anne Hathaway’s old house.\n\nI could see teacups with his face on it and I could see decals and I knew that the world had written about him and discussed whether he was a man or a woman or a committee of people or an aristocrat or a working class person, but I was walking around in the place that at least the man we know to be William Shakespeare lived, seeing the work that he produced in that theater. I was starting to make a connection between the man and this great icon and didn’t realize then that I would spend the rest of my life trying to get closer to him, in an effort to understand.\n\nThe idea of genius we have is great education etc. but Shakespeare just appeared, modestly…that appealed to me..how can that relative modesty create genius? The power of the human imagination; anyone can have that whether they come from a high level of society or education or from the most modest life.\n\nHis career over, William Shakespeare returns to his home in Stratford-upon-Avon to encounter old ghosts, old loves, and his resentful family.\n\nBranagh shot the film without publicity and when completed, in October 2018, it was picked up for U.S. and the world by Sony Pictures Classics. The film was given a December 21, 2018 limited release to qualify it for the Academy Awards, and was given a worldwide premiere in Palm Springs before receiving its wider release in May, 2019. Sony Pictures Classics’s Michael Barker attended the red carpet premiere.\n\n“We have known and worked with Ken for twenty-five years,” said SPC. “We feel this is a movie he was destined to make. He conjures up for us the depth and dramatic richness of a character about whom we have always been fascinated. What we have seen has confirmed our excitement to plan a qualifying run at the end of this year and to open the movie fully in the new year. We believe audiences will embrace the freshness of All Is True.”\n\nSPC’s other two films Never Look Away, shortlisted for an Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Language film and Stan & Ollie, shortlisted for Makeup are also showing during the PSIFF."
