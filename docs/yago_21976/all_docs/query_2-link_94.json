        "meta_description": "The Love’s Labour’s Lost film produced by the University of Fribourg is built on the concept of linguistic variety. The film was produced by the Swiss Stage Bards, a performance group that translates Shakespeare into all of the dominant languages of Switzerland (German, French, Italian) under the direction of Elisabeth Dutton, weaving those languages together with Shakespeare’s English into films that shift easily back and forth between different languages. Set and filmed at the University of Fribourg, the film highlights using the linguistic variety of Switzerland to highlight aspects of character and plot through language changes and codeswitching. The company balances careful and subtle translation that takes advantage of the repetitive patterns in Shakespeare’s language with the use of humour, music and gesture throughout the film to create a distinctly local Shakespeare that can be understood in a global context. While the production is defined by linguistic complexity, the Swiss Stage Bards use music, gesture, costume, and repetition to help audiences follow the plot even if they cannot understand the shifting languages with the same ease that the characters do. Using Shakespeare and languages to explore the challenges of love and communication, the film demonstrates how language can establish solidarity, create distance, assert power, and build connections.",

        "text": "Linguistic Variety\n\n5 Thomas Kyd, “The Spanish Tragedy”, Renaissance Drama: An Anthology of Plays, ed. Arthur F. Kinney, (...)\n\nEach one of us\n\nMust act his part in unknown languages,\n\nThat it may breed the more variety:\n\nAs you, my lord, in Latin, I in Greek,\n\nYou in Italian, and for because I know\n\nThat Bell-Imperia hath practiced the French,\n\nIn courtly French shall all her phrases be. (iv.i.172–178)\n\n3By using a similar strategy in remaking Love’s Labour’s Lost into a film that uses at least seven different languages, the Swiss Stage Bards paradoxically both increase and decrease the linguistic accessibility of the production. They allow any audience member who understands at least one of the languages to understand at least part of the film, but no one can understand the full film unless they are familiar with English, French, Italian, and German (Swiss and Standard), as well additional speeches in Latin, Spanish, Rumansch, and the dead language Patois Gruyerien. Within the world of the film, however, the chaotic switching of language functions seamlessly, and the characters do not demonstrate much difficulty in following the transitions. In a sort of reverse Tower of Babel, four different people can be speaking four different languages in a single conversation, and every word is understood, seemingly effortlessly. While the production is defined by linguistic complexity, every effort is made to help audiences to follow the plot even if they cannot understand the shifting languages with the same ease that the characters do.\n\nThe Language of Music\n\n4One of the strategies employed by the Swiss Stage Bards to increase comprehension is to combine music and situational humour to complement the use of spoken language. The first diegetic instance of music is at 0:55, where we see some of the breath-taking scenery in Fribourg and several students (Ferdinand’s lords) tossing a Nerf Vortex (a miniature foam football with a foam shaft and flight attached, which looks like a hybrid of a football and a dart) on campus, and first encounter King Ferdinand in the library. As we see Ferdinand, we learn that the young woman standing behind him, who we later learn is playing a gender-swapped Dull, is the source of the violin music. At first music in the library seems inappropriate, but since the library represents King Ferdinand’s court, the violin is not so out of place after all. At 1:32, the king motions for Dull to stop playing, which brings the viewer’s attention back to the library once again, where silence is appropriate. Beyond the absurdity of a violin in the library, Ferdinand’s opening lines are undercut by the physical humour of his attendants continuing to throw the Nerf Vortex; at 2:03 we actually see it arcing between two bathroom stalls. Finally, Berowne, Longaville, and Dumaine arrive, and have a heated discussion with Ferdinand, once again bringing the viewer back to the kinds of sounds more appropriate for the revelry of court than a library. The placement of Ferdinand’s court in a library and the alternation between behaviours appropriate for a library and ones appropriate for a court leave the viewer chuckling at the silliness of the opening scene. One of the first instances of code-switching as humour comes at 3:46; after Berowne’s dialogue lulls Ferdinand to sleep, and he wakes him by throwing his Nerf Vortex at him and switching to French.\n\n5The second example of diegetic music as a humorous device comes as King Ferdinand and his attendants have been in the library discussing their plans to sequester themselves for three years and live an austere life of studying and sleeping only three hours per night. The characters briefly break into a chorus of “Who let the lords out?”, sung to the melody of “Who let the dogs out”, a hit song from 2000 by Baha Men. Both the original song and the phrase “Who let the lords out” would seem to suggest that the characters were preparing for a party, which of course is far different than spending three years alone studying. The impression is one of hapless lords who proclaim to have been unleashed, but who are in reality preparing to be locked away.\n\n6Perhaps the most ironic use of music in the production begins at 1:08:06, when Berowne leads King Ferdinand and the other attendants in a rap song comprised of an abbreviated version of Berowne’s praise of Boyet. The scene is evocative of a music video, complete with two luxury cars (one is a BMW, but the brand marking of the other is not visible in the video). The music underscores Berowne’s praise of Boyet, despite the fact that it opens with an on-screen text that reads “The Lords Boyet Diss”. As in Shakespeare’s text, Boyet is the one who alerts the Princess and her attendants that King Ferdinand and company would soon be arriving disguised as Russian travellers. Boyet’s warning provides the impetus for the Princess and her ladies to don masks, exchange favours, and mock the men. Thus, the song celebrates a man who helps set the stage for the lords’ ridicule. In all of these scenes, music functions as an additional language, one that can be understood by any viewer, regardless of their skill level in any of Switzerland’s national languages.\n\nLove’s Languages Lost\n\n8The multilingual scenes in the film give each character a distinct linguistic identity, but the conversation flows unimpeded as if the characters were all speaking the same language – or at least, as if the characters all understood each language perfectly. In the scene in which the Princess and her attendants extoll the virtues of Ferdinand’s attendants, the Princess speaks Swiss German (her preferred variety for familiar discussions), Maria speaks Italian; Katherine, English; and Rosaline, French. As Hieronimo’s description of the play in The Spanish Tragedy suggests, having each woman speak in a different language does “breed more variety” (iv.i.174). Rather than watching characters slowly cycle through the languages of Switzerland in groups, the audience experiences all of the languages at once, overlapping in conversation as if each part of Switzerland had come together to tell four simultaneous love stories. The audience does not need to understand each line of dialogue because the scene makes it clear that each woman’s speech is a variation on a theme – a fond memory of a previous encounter with one of the men, followed by some light teasing from her friends. The humour in the scene comes not so much from the dialogue, but from the juxtaposition of their praises over scenes of the men in ridiculous situations. Longaville is shown messily eating a sandwich, Dumaine is practicing bodybuilding poses in front of a mirror while wearing a Speedo, and Berowne appears to be interrupting a professor’s lecture to stand and address the class himself. The behaviour of each man is at odds with the noble virtues that the women are listing, and the contrast relies on tone of voice and physical humour to aid the viewer in understanding the situation even without understanding all of the languages.\n\nPower Plays\n\nTricks and Translation\n\nLove’s Languages Found\n\nThe Language of the Land\n\nStranger in a Strange Land\n\n17The emphasis on creating a specifically Swiss visual and linguistic aesthetic is also apparent in the treatment of the character of Don Armado, who is humorously set apart from the other characters, while he still converses in German at several points throughout the film. In her article on the Swiss Stage Bards, Dutton explains that Armado’s comical and foreign misappropriation of Swiss culture provides potential entry point for audience members outside Switzerland:\n\n26 Elisabeth Dutton, “Swiss Shakespeare”, forthcoming.\n\nMuch humour is generated in the film by Don Armado’s appearance; at the same time, audience identification with him as the foreigner, the outsider, potentially causes the non-Swiss audience of the film to reflect on their own experience of oddity in the film. The outsider is at once bemused and, to the insiders he observes, amusing, perhaps cruelly so.\n\n18Non-Swiss viewers might sympathise with Armado’s desire to learn about and assimilate with Swiss culture, while simultaneously laughing at (and feeling superior to) the mistakes he makes while doing so. In an early scene, Armado declares his love for Jaquenetta, and Moth answers him in Swiss German. Discussions of love are quite an intimate type of communication, and Swiss German seems to be the better variety to accommodate these kinds of conversations in the film. When Boyet reads Armado’s letter to Jaquenetta, the scene shifts to one where he is a teacher lecturing his students (the Princess and her attendants). The letter is comical and overly sentimental, but nevertheless involves expressions of love and affection, making Swiss German the variety of choice. Like the scenes with the lovers, the scenes featuring Don Armado use music and humour to underscore the characters’ interactions and make the film easier for viewers of any language level to understand. To highlight the slapstick comedy of the eccentric Armado’s first meeting with King Ferdinand’s envoys, the production simulates a silent film from the early twentieth century, with the dialogue supported by a solo piano. The scene becomes black and white, with on-screen text in Swiss German for Dull, Armado, and Jaquenetta, and one brief English line for Armado. Later in the scene, Armado and Moth have French text, but the silent film never uses Spanish to designate the words of a Spanish character. The obvious choice in a linguistically varied Love’s Labour’s Lost would be to have the stereotypically Spanish character speaking entirely in Spanish, but Armado primarily speaks accented English and French, with a few sentences of Spanish, German, and Italian. In fact, other than a few strategically placed “olé”s when his name is mentioned, the humour of Armado’s character does not come from exaggerating his Spanish identity. Instead, the film presents Armado as a tourist visiting Switzerland who is trying too hard to be Swiss. The visuals accompanying Armado’s letter about Costard show Armado searching Google for images of Swiss clothing before arriving in Switzerland dressed up as one of the Vatican’s Swiss Guard. Armado continues to wear the Swiss Guard clothing throughout the rest of the film (fig. 4), whether he is chasing after a train, working out in the gym, or even taking a shower. By emphasising Armado’s overenthusiastic attempts to be Swiss rather than using his Spanish identity for humour, the Swiss Stage Bards keep the focus on Switzerland rather than Europe as a whole."
