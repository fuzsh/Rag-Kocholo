        "text": "For every man with his affects is born,\n\nNot by might mast'red but by special grace.\n\nThese lines are spoken by Berowne, a witty courtier played by Kenneth Branagh, who also directed ''Love's Labour's Lost,'' a whimsical, affected adaptation of Shakespeare's most forgettable early comedy. There is a great deal of dancing in the movie, which invokes the name of Stanley Donen and boasts a score packed with Broadway standards from Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin and the Gershwin brothers, but not much special grace.\n\nMr. Branagh has assembled a troupe of game, eager young stars, including Matthew Lillard, the gangly creepshow heartthrob from the ''Scream'' pictures, and Alicia Silverstone, the Bel Air Jane Austen heroine of ''Clueless,'' and sent them wobblingly forth to belt out show tunes, declaim pentameter and assay the leaps and twirls of Stuart Hopps's mercifully simplified choreography. He's even seen fit to include an Esther Williams-style water ballet sequence, complete with gold maillots and cabbage-leaf bathing caps.\n\nIf the cast were a sixth-grade class, and you were one of their parents, you'd burst out of your seat applauding madly, and rush backstage after the show, exclaiming: ''But you were wonderful! Really, really great!'' And then you'd congratulate the drama teacher (that would be the energetic English fellow with the blond hair and theatrical demeanor), who's so creative, the school is lucky to have him.\n\nAs a paying customer, your reaction may be more subdued, but the gee-whiz amateurism of this production is indubitably part of its charm. Watching Adrian Lester, as Dumaine, trying a half-successful split on a high wooden library table, you can only admire his effort, and be glad that Mr. Branagh did not demand another take. When Ms. Silverstone's voice skids and squeaks over the syllables of words like ''perplexity'' and ''lamentation,'' you can't help but root for her in her struggle with the the tongue-tying perplexities of Elizabethan verse.\n\nThere is no doubting Mr. Branagh's sincere enthusiasm for the material, which is not only Shakespeare but also old newsreels, ''Casablanca'' and classic MGM musicals. He throws them together with the gusto of a man playing a tuba with a bass drum strapped to his back while his pet monkey leaps around with a squeeze box. It's not art exactly, or even music, but it's entertaining, albeit in an intermittently annoying kind of way.\n\nFor no particular reason, Mr. Branagh sets the play in a dreamy Technicolor Europe on the eve of World War II. The King of Navarre (Alessandro Nivola) has persuaded his three best pals to join him in a vow of chastity, which is quickly tested by the arrival of the French princess (Ms. Silverstone) and her three luscious ladies-in-waiting. The mooning and swooning of the nobility is mirrored by the bawdier amours of Don Armado (Timothy Spall) and Jaquenetta (Stefania Rocca), whose cleavage inspires some of Mr. Branagh's most inventive camera work.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
