        "text": "Posted in Kenneth Branagh\n\nLove's Labour's Lost is a 2000 British musical romantic comedy film written, directed by and starring Kenneth Branagh, based on the comic play of the same name by William Shakespeare. The first feature film to be made of this lesser-known comedy, Branagh's fourth film of a Shakespeare play was a box-office and critical disappointment.\n\nThe cast includes Shakespearean veterans such as Timothy Spall, Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, alongside Hollywood actors Alicia Silverstone and Matthew Lillard and Broadway and West End stars such as Nathan Lane, Adrian Lester and Jimmy Yuill.\n\nAs a result of its poor commercial performance, Miramax shelved its three-picture deal with Branagh, who subsequently returned to Shakespeare with As You Like It in 2006.\n\nThis recording is for educational purposes only and is covered under Fair Use doctrine - Copyright - All rights reserved to their respective owners.\n\nRead the unabridged plays online: [ LINK ]\n\nSupport Us - Donate Now !\n\nEnter Amount:\n\nÂ£\n\nWhy Donate?\n\nDonations to Shakespeare Network help sustain free knowledge and educational programs on Shakespeare Network and our ecosystem of Shakespeare Network projects.
