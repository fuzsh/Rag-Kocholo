        "text": "Love’s Labour’s Lost at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford – upon Avon, Warwickshire and a stopover at The Arden Hotel, Waterside, Stratford -upon – Avon, Warwickshire.\n\nLike myself, the first contact most people would have had with the world of William Shakespeare was from their schooldays. I was studying English literature at secondary school and we, ‘had’ to do a play! Not knowing much about the world of drama, theatre, or poetry, it was not something I was particularly looking forward to. The play we were going to study was a tragedy, titled Romeo, and Juliet about two young lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families! It did not sound like a play I was going to enjoy much!\n\nTo help me get to grips with the strange dialogue, I sat and watched the 1968 film adaptation by director Franco Zefferelli starring the stunning Olivia Hussey as Juliet and Leonard Whiting as her co-star crossed lover. I absolutely loved the play and from that day forward I was hooked, visiting the Royal Shakespeare Theatre on several occasions over my adult years to soak up more of the Bards greatest works.\n\nI was recently back in Stratford Upon Avon to watch a performance of Love’s Labour’s Lost, staying at the fashionable Arden Hotel right opposite the Royal Shakespeare Company Theatre on Waterside. I had decided to enjoy a meal in their delightful restaurant and then stop over after the show in one of their luxury rooms.\n\nFor many people visiting Stratford Upon Avon, it is England’s national poet, the “Bard of Avon” that draws in the annual 3 million tourists a year. It is here in this beautiful Warwickshire market town that you can visit the great man’s birthplace, the church in which he is buried, watch one of his thirty nine plays in the spectacular Royal Shakespeare Theatre, take part in a class in the actual school that he attended and visit many other buildings associated with the man widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world’s most outstanding dramatist.\n\nRoast free range chicken breast, pomme puree & petit pois a la Francaise\n\nBut Stratford Upon Avon is not just about Shakespeare, it is a market town with more than 800 years of history offering a wide variety of ancient buildings, leisure, entertainment, shopping experiences. Educational, Ghost & Fun walks, Cream Teas, a Big Ferris Wheel, Butterfly Farm, Boating on the river Avon, art galleries, museums and many other activities in and around the town.\n\nValrona tropical dark Chocolate Delice & vanilla ice cream\n\nThe best of Stratford-upon-Avon can’t be seen in a day so why not stay over in the town for a few days, which is exactly why I decided to stopover at the stunning The Arden, when I went along to watch Love’s Labour’s Lost, one of William Shakespeare’s early comedies, believed to have been written in the mid-1590s for a performance at the Inns of Court before Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nMy research tells me that the play features the longest scene, the longest single word ‘honorificabilitudinitatibus’, try saying that if you can! and the longest speech, in all of Shakespeare’s plays. There were certainly a lot of words to muse over during almost two & a half hours of drama, a lot of senseless prattle, which often came from the mouths of Holofernes (Tony Gardner), Moth (Iskandar Eaton) and Costard (Nathan Foad).\n\nThere were a couple of brief attempts at being serious, when the play begins the Princess (Melanie-Joyce Bermudez) makes her opening speech in Hawaiian ( I was reliably informed) with her image magnified on a rolling video & news flash about climate change! This was soon abandoned for fun, jokes, jests, and childish antics. The play, directed by Emily Burns, is snappy and often very funny, set on a tech billionaire’s private Hawaiian Island. The revolving set on the Pacific Island with the light music of flautists, strumming guitars and sweet drumming worked well.\n\nThe billionaire in question is Ferdinand (Abiola Owokoniran), who has assembled his mates, a questioning Berowne (Luke Thompson of Bridgerton fame), Longaville (Eric Stroud) and Dumaine (Brandon Bassir), to spend three years on the island, away from all worldly temptations! They are to be isolated from the modern world which includes their phones and sign a pledge that they will have no contact with women. Things very quickly go downhill!\n\nFramed at The RSC\n\nUnsurprisingly, in very swift time, a group of four unattached women arrive at the exclusive retreat, not looking for love, but for business. The Princess of a nearby island nation, has been sent to discuss a land dispute on behalf of her ailing father. She arrives with her female associates, Rosaline (Ioanna Kimbook), Katherine (Amy Griffiths) and Maria (Sarita Gabony), and a man with a suitcase, Boyet (Jordan Metcalfe).\n\n“Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye.”\n\nWilliam Shakespeare, Love’s Labour’s Lost\n\nThe plot is predictably silly, with the four young men quickly giving up on their vows of abstinence in favour of courting the four women. Despite the affectations of the men the women remain composed, ordered, and amused by their words & behaviour. Luke Thompson is comfortable with the long Shakespearean verse, his Berowne is often an endearing clown, his flirtatious dealings with Rosaline (Ioanna Kimbook), even encourages him to strip down to his underwear, during a particularly puzzling show of romance.\n\nWhen the walls of the stage set revolve with each of the four men clambering, climbing or hiding up and down its steps, with each of them speaking of their love for the women, provided another episode of entertainment and light comedy. Watching Thompson climb up a tall mock palm tree, struggling to conceal himself from the others was amusing, which many in the packed audience seemed to enjoy.\n\nWhen the four dressed as knights in armour trying to entertain the women, singing “I Want It That Way”, by the Backstreet Boys, a boyband of Tin Men, no less, all pretence of a serious play went out the theatre doors, but it was funny. Padding around spa baths, driving across stage in a golf buggy, the appearance of mobile phones, taking the knee and even a Gavin & Stacey reference, Tidy! Will not endear the traditionalists, but I loved it! The sudden news of the death of the Princess’s father changed the mood from overtly silliness and comedy to a bewildering sudden sense of genuine grief.\n\nI found the posing & ridiculous behaviour of the Spaniard Don Armado (Jack Bardoe) very amusing and entertaining. His pursuit of Jaquenetta (Marienella Phillips), was at times perplexing and the preoccupied Costard (Nathan Foad) spent most of his time wandering around stage in his bathrobe & slippers. I never quite worked out what his role was!\n\n“Love is a familiar. Love is a devil. There is no evil angel but love.”\n\nWilliam Shakespeare, Love’s Labour’s Lost\n\nFor much of the time the play was a buoyant and cheery performance, a modern day romantic comedy full of optimism & humour with flashes of great comedy. It was a great evening’s entertainment at the theatre and isn’t that what we go to the theatre for?\n\nLove’s Labour’s Lost was an unusual opener for the Shakespearean season at Stratford – upon Avon, a vigorous, energetic fresh retelling of one of the Bards oldest and least known plays. It has made me look forward to the new season ahead full of renewed anticipation.\n\nWhen visiting the Royal Shakespeare Theatre to watch a play I would fully recommend a stopover with pre- theatre Dinner & after show bedroom at The Arden Hotel, just a few steps from the theatre.\n\nLove’s Labour’s Lost Royal Shakespeare Theatre Stratford – upon Avon, Warwickshire Until 18 MAY 2024\n\nRunning time: 2 hrs 45 mins (including a 20 mins interval)"
