Imagine a lush 1930s musical written by Shakespeare and choreographed by the Marx Brothers.\n\nI'd seen it before, with Beulah, and loved it. But the critics and public hated it, and I wondered what I'd think the second time round. Was I more critical?\n\nNope. Loved it again. Laughed and laughed. Loved the visuals, the Cole Porter and Gershwin songs - and yes, I looked it up, They Can't Take That Away From Me is Gershwin, not Porter. Loved the broad comedy (which I usually don't), the sense of romance, the dances, the dresses, the campiness, the men, the great settings - another beautiful fantasy library!\n\nAnd I really liked Alessandro Nivola, who played the King of Navarre. Gorgeous. I don't think I've seen him before - or since. I wonder why not?"
