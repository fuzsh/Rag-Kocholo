And now Britt Ekland will be taking centre stage at a horror festival in a Great Yarmouth theatre.

The star of the Wickerman, The Man with the Golden Gun and Get Carter will be at St George's Theatre for the 50 Years of Classic British Horror festival on Saturday, July 22.

The centrepiece is a screening of Robin Hardy’s occult thriller The Wicker Man, which also starred Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward.

Introducing the 1973 film from the stage of St George’s and discussing her career with the British Film Institute consultant Dick Fiddy will be the Swedish actress Ms Ekland.

Festival organiser Selene Paxton-Brooks said: “It’s a cliché, but it’s a dream come true.

“I got in touch with Britt through a mutual friend, not believing for a minute that she’d come to Great Yarmouth.

"I didn’t hear anything for a while, then, just as I was thinking ‘That’s that, then’, I received an email from her manager saying she’d accepted.

"Her appearance this year has really helped put 50 Years of Classic British Horror on the map, with about 180 tickets sold and a lot of buzz on social media.”

It is the second horror film festival to be staged in the theatre and it will also feature the premier of the film, The Pocket Film of Superstitions.
