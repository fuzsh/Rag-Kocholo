        "text": "Director Mike Hodges, best known for films including Get Cater, The Terminal Man and Flash Gordon, has died aged 90.\n\nThe news was revealed by longtime friend and producer Mike Kaplan, who worked with Hodges on his final feature I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead.\n\nHodges died at his home in Dorset on Saturday, with The Hollywood Reporter reporting he died of heart failure.\n\nHodges got his feature start by writing and directing the British gangster film Get Carter, with the seminal film starring iconic actor Sir Michael Caine, before he went on to replace Nicolas Roeg as director of Flash Gordon.\n\nAs well as Flash Gordon and Get Carter, the filmmaker was known for 1972’s Pulp, working with Sir Michael once more, as well as 1974’s The Terminal Man starring George Segal, 1989’s and Black Rainbow with Rosanna Arquette.\n\nBorn in Bristol, Hodges is a qualified accountant and spent two years in the Royal Navy on the lower deck of a minesweeper before crossing to the camera.\n\nHe got his start in British television on current affairs program World in Action before landing the gig of directing Sir Michael in 1971’s Get Carter after impressing the film’s producer on an ITV Playhouse telefilm.\n\nThe film, which also starred Britt Ekland, centred Sir Michael as hitman Jack Carter, who returns to Newcastle for his brother’s funeral and soon suspects foul play was involved with his death.\n\nGet Carter is considered one of the greatest British gangster movies of all time and has a 87% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nRecalling his time helming Get Carter as ‘truly extraordinary, because it was done in a kind of white heat’, he said in a 2021 BFI interview: ‘Richard Lester, who was a friend of mine, gave me a tip, which was a very wise one. He said, “Make sure you stay in a different hotel to the crew.” So, I stayed in the different hotel. The first assistant also had a suite there, as well.\n\n‘What happens if you’re staying in the same hotel is the crew and the cast eat you alive. You walk into the foyer and they’re on you like piranha fish. I managed to keep myself concentrating just on what was happening in front of the camera, none of the politics of anything that was going on around it. And I just shot it, literally, from the seat of my pants.’\n\nHe would go on to form the Three Michaels production company alongsir Sir Michael and producer Hodges Michael Klinger.\n\nHodges would go on to helm 1980 space opera Flash Gordon, which starred Sam Jones, alongside producer Dino De Laurentiis, who had previously overseen Barbarella.\n\nTributes have come in for the filmmaker, with writer and broadcaster Matthew Sweet writing on Twitter: ‘Just heard the news about Mike Hodges. A true master. A furious restless talent. An unassailable body of work. Loved the films. Loved the man.’\n\nScreenwriter Brian Lynch wrote: ‘Mike Hodges, director of FLASH GORDON, has passed. Finally saw this movie during the pandemic and it brought me such joy. Have watched it a bunch of times since. Nothing else like it. Rest in Peace, sir,’ while director Edgar Wright shared an image of Sir Michael and Hodges on set."
