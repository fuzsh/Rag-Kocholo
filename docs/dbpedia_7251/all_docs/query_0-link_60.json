        "text": "Britt Ekland (born Britt-Marie Eklund; 6 October 1942) is a Swedish actress and singer. She appeared in numerous films in her heyday throughout the 1960s and 1970s, including roles in William Friedkin's The Night They Raided Minsky's (1968), and the British crime film Get Carter (1971), which established her as a movie sex symbol. She also starred in the British cult horror film The Wicker Man (1973) and appeared as a Bond girl in The Man with the Golden Gun (1974). Her high-profile social life and her 1964 marriage to actor Peter Sellers attracted considerable press attention, leading to her being one of the most photographed celebrities in the world during the 1970s.\n\nShe also had a much publicised romance with rock star Rod Stewart; they were introduced in 1975 by Joan Collins and lived together for more than two years, with Ekland giving up her career to focus on the relationship.\n\n(Read more at Wikipedia.)\n\n[]\n\nPeel played a disco single from the actress and later met the singer at the Kerrang awards in 2000, where she broke her foot after slipping on food.\n\nOn his 30 August 2000 show, Peel mentioning the story on how she slipped at the Kerrang awards, revealed that she told him that she listened to his programmes, which he was reluctant to believe, and was tempted to ask her to name a record that he played in the last ten years.\n\nShows Played[]\n\n1979\n\n30 October 1979: unknown (7\" - Do It To Me (Once More With Feeling)) Jet\n\nSee Also[]\n\nSounds\n\n[]"
