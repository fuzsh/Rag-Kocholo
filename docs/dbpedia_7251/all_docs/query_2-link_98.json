        "text": "“You’re a big man, but you’re in bad shape. With me it’s a full-time job. Now behave yourself.”\n\n— Jack Carter, Get Carter\n\nIn my previous film and unavoidably political article for Seroxcat's Salon, I briefly mentioned Get Carter. Directed and written by Mike Hodges — his first film — is based on the 1970 novel Jack’s Return Home by Ted Lewis. This is as iconic a film as you will ever see.\n\nTime does nothing to diminish it. Time only enhances its cult and legendary status and its bleak social history. It undoubtedly still resonates in the England of 2024 because of the continuing betrayal of promises made over these 50 years to facilitate the Northern Powerhouse. This film is now part of a record and documentation of our declining economic and social status as much as The Long Good Friday is. From manufacturing powerhouse to service economy — prostitution and drugs. It is all in Get Carter.\n\nBut of course, there is the revenge story and a thriller that is colder and more brutal than anything British cinema has produced before or since. At the centre of it, is Michael Caine as Jack Carter, playing with such chilly authority that he really could be a Geordie Hood returning home for his brother’s funeral."
