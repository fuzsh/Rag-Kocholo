        "text": "Denise Richards\n\nNowadays, people know her more for her tempestuous relationship with ex-husband actor Charlie Sheen. But, for a while, Denise was one of Hollywood’s hottest actresses.\n\nShe starred in several big films, like Starship Troopers, and Wild Things, and on TV shows like Seinfeld and Melrose Place. Her most notable role until today was as a Bond girl in The World Is Not Enough, in which she played Christmas Jones.\n\nSophie Marceau\n\nFrench-born Sophie Marceau has had major success in Europe for over three decades. She landed the role of Elektra King in the James Bond film, The World Is Not Enough. Following the role, she continued to land major roles.\n\nHer most notable role was in the Oscar-winning Mel Gibson film, Braveheart, and opposite Robin Williams, in a Midsummer Night’s Dream. Despite her success in American films, she prefers to act in French films.\n\nIzabella Scorupco\n\nThe European Actress, model, and singer is of Polish and Swedish descent. She began her career in the 1980s, as a fashion model. She eventually landed the cover of Vogue. She then pursued a singing career and formed a pop group that recorded a gold-certified album.\n\nThanks to her popularity, she landed a role in Goldeneye, where she played Natalya Simonova, alongside Pierce Brosnan and Famke Janssen.\n\nUrsula Andress\n\nAndress helped preserved the image of a Bond girl as a sex goddess character, in her infamous ocean scene, that Halle Berry would reclaim years later, in Die Another Day. Andress made cinematic and fashion history in the first film, Dr. No, when she rose out of the Caribbean Sea in a white bikini, sporting a large diving knife on her hip.\n\nHer role as Bond girl Honey Ryder brought her international fame. She later said that the bikini was the secret to her success. The bikini she wore in the film later sold at an auction in 2001, for nearly $60,000. Her character is often considered to be the first Bond girl, although she wasn’t the first woman to be with Bond. Andress acted until the ’90s.\n\nTanya Roberts\n\nBronx-born Tanya Roberts moved to Toronto, Canada with her mother for several years, and then back to NYC where she began to model and act. She received roles in several small-budget films. Her breakthrough role came in 1980, in the famous TV series, Charlie’s Angels.\n\nShe eventually landed the part of a Bond girl, in the 1985 A View To Kill, as Stacey Sutton, a geologist. Following the film, she continued to act through the ’90s, and for a few years, she played Midge Pinciotti on That 70’s Show.\n\nJane Seymour\n\nJane Seymour is one of the most popular faces from the early days of the James Bond film series. Boys from all over the world fell for this sultry Solitaire, Bond’s love interest of the moment in Live and Let Die. Seymour had already appeared in a variety of television shows and movies prior to the Bond film and continued to act through the early 2000s, mostly on television.\n\nShe competed in the fifth season of Dancing with the Stars and finished in sixth place. Throughout her career, Seymour has garnered an Emmy Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nEva Green\n\nFrench-born Eva Green first achieved international recognition for her performance in the Kingdom of Heaven, in 2005. The following year, she played Bond girl Vesper Lynd, in Casino Royale. She was awarded the BAFTA Rising Star Award for her performance.\n\nSince the film, she has acted in several independent films, including Cracks, Womb, and 300: Rise of an Empire. She also starred as Vanessa Ives in the drama series, Penny Dreadful, for which she earned a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nBarbara Bach\n\nWhile she isn’t related to the famous musician, she did make a reputation and name for herself. Barbara grew up in Queens, New York. At the age of 16, she dropped out of school to pursue a modeling career. Her modeling eventually led her to land roles in several European films.\n\nShe caught the eye of a Bond producer and was cast to play Anya Amasova in the 1977 classic, The Spy Who Loved Me. And thanks to that role, she caught the eye of Beatles member, Ringo Starr, and the two married in 1981. They have been surprisingly (by Hollywood standards) married since.\n\nHonor Blackman\n\nBlackman was already a star long before she landed her iconic role in the Bond film. She made her movie debut in 1947, in the film, Fame is the Spur. Following the role, she continued to act in both television and movies. She is most notable for her roles in Jason and the Argonauts and the British TV series, The Avengers. Thanks to her role in The Avengers, as Cathy Gale, she landed a role in Goldfinger, the third Bond film.\n\nShe played the part of Pussy Galore. Yes, this was actually the name of the character. Albert R. Broccoli, the film’s producer, said that she was cast in the film based on her success in The Avengers. He said, “The Brits would love her because they knew her as Mrs. Gale, the Yanks would like her because she was so good, it was a perfect combination.” At her then-age of 38, she was also one of the oldest actresses to play a Bond girl. To this day, her character is one of the most popular roles in the whole film series.\n\nRosamund Pike\n\nNow, you probably recognize this next Bond girl. But back in 2002, when Die Another Day was released, not many knew of this actress. Born in London, Rosamund Pike began her career as a theater actor. In 2002, she received international recognition for her role as Miranda Frost and became a huge star who has continued to receive rave reviews for her performances.\n\nFollowing the film, she had film appearances in Doom, Fugitive Pieces, and The World’s End. In 2014, she starred in Gone Girl and was met with critical acclaim. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress and a Golden Globe Award. Her upcoming films include The Informer and Radioactive.\n\nCorinne Cléry\n\nThe French-born actress had a very successful acting career in Europe, appearing in more than 50 films and TV shows. But her biggest role was in the 1979 James Bond film, Moonraker.\n\nShe played the role of Corinne Dufour, who was the assistant of the movie antagonist, Hugo Drax.\n\nAlison Doody\n\nIrish-born Alison Doody grew up in Dublin, studying at a convent. She was approached by a photographer and took up modeling, which eventually led to an acting career.\n\nWhen she was 18 years old, she landed a small role in A View to a Kill, as Jenny Flex. She is the youngest Bond girl to date. She continues acting to this day.\n\nTeri Hatcher\n\nIt seems like there isn’t much that Teri Hatcher didn’t get her hands on. Hatcher studied acting at the American Conservatory Theater. While studying, she was an NFL cheerleader with the San Francisco 49ers. She landed several roles in TV series. She began to land roles in major TV shows, like Seinfeld and Lois & Clark. In 1997, she landed the role of Paris Carver in the James Bond film, Tomorrow Never Dies.\n\nShe starred in Tomorrow Never Dies alongside Pierce Brosnan. She played the part of Paris Carver. Following the role, her career took a major turning point, and she landed a lead role on Desperate Housewives. As of April 2006, she was one of the highest-paid actresses in the United States.\n\nEunice Gayson\n\nEunice Gayson holds the title of the original Bond girl. She starred in the first two films; 1962’s Dr. No and 1963’s From Russia With Love. She was meant to play the role of Miss Moneypenny but ultimately starred as Sylvia Trench, Bond’s first film crush.\n\nShe was possibly going to play a recurring role in the series, but in the end that fell through. Prior to the films, she played the main role in The Revenge of Frankenstein and was on the TV series, The Saint (along with a future James Bond) and The Avengers. In June 2018 Eunice passed away at the age of 90. Her reputation as the first Bond girl will always live on.\n\nLana Wood\n\nLana Wood is the younger sister of the famous film actress, Natalie Wood. Natalie died under suspicious circumstances at the height of her career. Lana followed the path of her older sister into Hollywood and starred in several film and TV shows. Her breakthrough role came in the 1971 Bond film, Diamonds are Forever, where she played Plenty O’Toole.\n\nShe has appeared in more than 20 films and 300 television series, including The Fugitive, Bonanza, Mission: Impossible, Starsky & Hutch, and Capitol. She retired from acting in 1982 to focus on a career as a producer but decided to return to acting in 2008. She has appeared in several low-budget films since.\n\nMichelle Yeoh\n\nBefore landing a role in 1997’s Tomorrow Never Dies, Malaysian-born Michelle Yeoh was having major success as an actress in Asia, in the 90s. She starred in some of China’s biggest hit movies at the time. Owing to her kick-ass style in many martial arts action films, she landed a role as a Bond girl.\n\nFollowing the part, she landed the lead role in 2000s Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, an Academy Award-winning film. She was also nominated for a BAFTA best actress award. She has continued acting, making another notable appearance in the romantic comedy-drama film, Crazy Rich Asians.\n\nMaud Adams\n\nProducers of Bond films are apt to shift the profile of a Bond girl every so often. They originally used European models and actresses, then switched things up to American-born leading Bond ladies. Maud Adams, a Swedish-born Actress, brought the Bond girl back to her European roots. She held two roles in the Bond series, once in 1974’s The Man with the Golden Gun, when she played Andrea Anders.\n\nHer role as the doomed mistress of the villain propelled Adams to international fame. The second role came in 1983, when she played the title role, Octopussy. Adams has said that although being a Bond girl may not indicate continued success, the fact that you are a Bond girl is, in itself, special.\n\nDaniela Bianchi\n\nBianchi was born in Rome, Italy. Prior to playing one of the Bond girls, she was a model and the first runner-up in the 1960 Miss Universe pageant. This led her to land several film roles in Italy and France.
