        "text": "What is Britt Ekland's Net Worth?\n\nBritt Ekland is a Swedish actress who has a net worth of $22 million. Britt Ekland is known for her performances in such films as \"The Double Man,\" \"The Night They Raided Minsky's,\" \"Stiletto,\" \"The Wicker Man,\" and \"The Man with the Golden Gun.\" Later in her career, she began appearing in theater and on reality television programs. Ekland was heavily publicized for her social life in the 60s and 70s, including her high-profile relationships with such celebrities as Peter Sellers and Rod Stewart.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBritt Ekland was born on October 6, 1942 in Stockholm, Sweden to Maj Britt, a secretary, and Sven Axel Eklund, a clothing store proprietor who also served as captain of the Swedish national curling team. She was raised alongside her three younger brothers. As an adolescent, Ekland left school to tour with a theater company.\n\nFilm Career in the 60s and 70s\n\nEkland began her film career in 1960 with a bit part in the Elvis Presley musical \"G.I. Blues.\" The following year, she had a small supporting role in the crime dramedy \"The Happy Thieves.\" Ekland subsequently appeared in the Swedish films \"Short is the Summer\" and \"It's With Me He's Been\"; the Italian films \"To Bed or Not to Bed\" and \"The Commandant\"; and the American films \"The Prize\" and \"Advance to the Rear.\" Following uncredited parts in \"Four Bullets for Joe\" and \"Do Not Disturb,\" Ekland landed her biggest role yet in Vittorio De Sica's 1966 heist comedy \"After the Fox,\" costarring Peter Sellers. She reunited with Sellers in 1967 for \"The Bobo,\" and the same year, starred in \"Too Many Thieves\" and \"The Double Man.\" Ekland next starred as an Amish woman who becomes a burlesque dancer in William Friedkin's musical comedy \"The Night They Raided Minsky's.\" Closing out the decade, she starred in the American crime film \"Stiletto\" and the Italian crime film \"Machine Gun McCain,\" and had a supporting role in the Italian historical dramedy \"The Conspirators.\"\n\nKicking off the 70s, Ekland starred in \"The Year of the Cannibals,\" \"Tintomara,\" and \"Percy.\" She then appeared as a gun moll opposite Michael Caine in the crime film \"Get Carter,\" which cemented her already sturdy status as an international sex symbol. Ekland's subsequent credits included \"A Time for Loving,\" \"Endless Night,\" \"Asylum,\" and \"Baxter!\" She had one of her most famous roles in 1973, playing a pagan village seductress in the folk horror film \"The Wicker Man.\" The year after that, Ekland starred in \"The Ultimate Thrill\" and played Bond girl Mary Goodnight in \"The Man with the Golden Gun.\" Her other credits in the 70s include \"High Velocity,\" \"Casanova & Co.,\" and \"King Solomon's Treasure.\"\n\nFurther Film Career\n\nIn the early 80s, Ekland was in the horror films \"The Monster Club\" and \"Satan's Mistress\" and the crime thriller \"Dead Wrong.\" Returning to lighter fare mid-decade, she appeared in the teen sex comedy \"Fraternity Vacation\" and the romantic caper \"Marbella.\" In 1987, Ekland starred in the horror film \"Moon in Scorpio.\" Two years later, she was in the direct-to-video horror comedy \"Beverly Hills Vamp\" and the historical drama \"Scandal,\" about the Profumo affair. Ekland scarcely appeared in movies after that; after \"The Children\" in 1990, she wasn't in another film until 2006's \"Search.\"\n\nTelevision Career\n\nEarlier in her career, Ekland made guest appearances on such shows as \"Armchair Theatre,\" \"The Trials of O'Brien,\" \"Aquarius,\" and \"McCloud.\" She was also in a number of television films, including \"A Carol for Another Christmas,\" \"The Great Wallendas,\" \"Ring of Passion,\" and \"The Hostage Tower.\" Ekland had larger roles in the Swedish series \"Skeppsredaren\" and the American miniseries \"Valley of the Dolls.\" She continued making appearances on various shows throughout the 80s and 90s, including \"Fantasy Island,\" \"The Love Boat,\" \"The Fall Guy,\" \"Superboy,\" and \"Absolutely Fabulous.\"\n\nEkland's credits in the 21st century have mostly been on reality television. From 2007 to 2008, she was featured on the Swedish reality show \"Stjärnorna på slottet.\" After that, in 2010, Ekland competed on the reality series \"I'm a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here!\" She next appeared as one of the housewives in seasons six and seven of \"Svenska Hollywoodfruar.\" In 2018, Ekland competed on the Swedish celebrity dancing show \"Let's Dance.\" Her other reality television credits include the British travel show \"The Real Marigold Hotel,\" on which she appeared in season four in 2020.\n\nStage Career\n\nOn stage, Ekland has acted in productions of such classic fairytales as \"Jack and the Beanstalk\" and \"Cinderella.\" In the latter, she has played both the titular princess and the fairy godmother. Her other stage credits have included \"Grumpy Old Women Live\" and \"The Cat and the Canary.\"\n\nPersonal Life"
