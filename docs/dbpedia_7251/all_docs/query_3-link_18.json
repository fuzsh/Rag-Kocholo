        "text": "Now 80, Britt Ekland (above) talks about life after she left the spotlight.\n\nBritt said openly, her hair is a still dyed blonde, her slight figure is stiff-gaited but upright through rigorous Pilates.\n\nShe’s dressed in tactile layers of cream and brown, a fake fur gilet, a big leopard-skin scarf, the journalist noted.\n\nBritt now lives between LA and the east coast of Sweden.\n\nHer body, she said, is a little shower these days but she’s convinced she won’t die, as her mother did, with Alzheimer’s. Yet she’s never stopped fighting the ageing process.\n\nAt almost 81, Britt said “I am vain, Very vain. I aways say, ‘The mirror is your best friend.’ I’ve been looking like Britt Ekland since Britt Ekland was invented. And I refuse to give up now.”\n\n<< Adapted Frank Morris from a SMH article.\n\nFront Lines: Britt shares a secret or two … 1984 flashback!\n\nBritt Ekland: “Australian men treat me like gold.”\n\nActress Britt Ekland, now pushing 41, revealed a lot more than her “secrets on sensual beauty” at her Sydney press conference.\n\n“I’ve never been with a man older that I am now,” she cooed.\n\nBritt, who once shared marital bliss with the likes of Peter Sellers and Rod Stewart, said she was “very happy” with her present husband, a rock star who is 18 years her junior. “He’s very young, and very skinny – and he’s lucky to have me,” she said.\n\nOf her marriage to Peter Sellers, she said, “I was just a little Swedish girl of 20. My husband was very famous and it was like being Princess Diana overnight.”\n\nShe said if she had her life over again “there are very few things I’d change.”\n\nCASEY BAGS BRITT\n\n2KY’s breakfast ‘oracle’ Ron Casey, obviously does not subscribe to Emerson’s claim that “beauty is in the eye of the beholder.”\n\nWhen Britt Ekland’s name was mentioned on his open line program … Casey began firing from the lip.\n\n“I don’t think Britt’s that crash hot,”, he said. “I watched her in a James Bond movie the other night and she had wrinkles under her eyes even then. With all the spare time Britt’s had on her hands, I don’t think she’s that much better at 41.”\n\nThat goodness Britt didn’t were hair curlers in the movie!\n\nBritt said, “I’m not a tower of strength and I am very vulnerable to a lot of things; but I feel my life so far has only reached chapter six.”\n\nWhen asked her opinion of Australian men, Britt replied: “They are the nicest, funniest men I know. They are very open and treat me like gold.”\n\nFront Lines’ Kate Watson, who attended the press conference, writes:\n\nBritt at 41, is still stunningly beautiful. In fact, she does not look a day over thirty.\n\nUnlike many stars who cover up their lines with layers of make-up, Britt wears were just enough to enhance her natural beauty and features.\n\nIf I could look half as good at 35 as Britt does now, the passing of the years would not seen such a daunting prospect.\n\nBRITT EKLAND: HOW PETER SELLERS PROPOSED?\n\n> Read More"
