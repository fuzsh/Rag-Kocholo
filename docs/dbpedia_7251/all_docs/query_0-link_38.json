We didn’t have any of that. We just went out there, we were always in a bikini and all these people are fully dressed, very typical, but it was a job and we did it.\"\n\nEkland continued: \"So, I think today the Bond women have it – from a political correctness point of view – in a much better position. But I think we had more fun.\"\n\nMore like this\n\nRead more:\n\nRupert Friend is \"ready\" for James Bond: \"I've got the scars and bruises\"\n\nIdris Elba should be the next James Bond, says Tom Hanks\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion of late around how the Bond franchise is being updated for modern audiences and sensibilities.\n\nIn February it was announced that Ian Fleming’s original 007 books had been revised to remove a number of racial references, and add a disclaimer that the books might use terms reflecting attitudes \"considered offensive by modern readers\".\n\nThe edited novels were published in April, with Fleming's estate saying that the revisions were made in line with “guidance from the author himself”, citing Fleming’s historical support of such changes and referring specifically to his approval of edits made to the US version of Live and Let Die.\n\nWhen it comes to the direction the film franchise should take, one person who has their own thoughts is none other than Quentin Tarantino, who has said that they should \"not remake the movies\" but instead \"actually just do the books, but do them the way they were written\".\n\nJames Bond films including The Man with the Golden Gun, No Time to Die and many more are available to rent or buy on Prime Video.
