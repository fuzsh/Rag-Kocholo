        "text": "❉ Newly restored in 4K from the original camera negative by the BFI, Jack Carter is back, and looking and sounding better than ever.\n\nDirector Mike Hodges’ seminal Get Carter (1971) starring Michael Caine, returns to the big screen, re-released by BFI Distribution in cinemas in the UK and Ireland on Friday 27 May 2022. A partnership with Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Bros. Entertainment UK Ltd has enabled the film to be newly restored in 4K by the BFI for theatrical release, followed by a home entertainment presentation on BFI UHD (Ultra High Definition) and Blu-ray on 25 July with accompanying special features. Utilising the original 35mm camera negative, the new restoration has been approved by Mike Hodges himself.\n\nAs well as screening in cinemas around the country, the film will have a two-week Extended Run at BFI Southbank as part of the Mike Hodges retrospective, RETURN OF THE OUTSIDER: The Films of Mike Hodges running from 1 – 31 May 2022.\n\nLegendary British actor Michael Caine is Jack Carter, the London gangland enforcer who returns to his hometown of Newcastle to avenge his brother’s untimely death. Rarely has the criminal underworld been so realistically portrayed than in this 1971 masterpiece. Director Mike Hodges also wrote the screenplay, based on the novel Jack’s Return Home (1970) by Ted Lewis. Co-starring alongside Michael Caine are Ian Hendry, the writer John Osborne and Britt Ekland. The film’s distinctive theme tune is by Roy Budd, a jazz pianist and composer, who composed most of the soundtrack.\n\nShot mainly on location around Newcastle and Gateshead, resulting in a devastatingly authentic snapshot of life in the North-East of England in the late-industrial period, Get Carter remains arguably the grittiest and greatest of all British crime films.\n\nThis re-release by BFI Distribution is an unmissable opportunity for fans across the UK to enjoy the film once again in all its glory, looking the best it has ever looked on screen. Younger film fans will have the chance to discover the brilliance of Michael Caine’s portrayal of one of his most memorable and best-known characters.\n\nExtras\n\n❉ Limited edition 2-disc set\n\n❉ 4K (2160p) UHD Blu-ray presentation in Dolby Vision (HDR10 compatible)\n\n❉ Audio commentary featuring Michael Caine, Mike Hodges and Wolfgang Suschitzky (2009)\n\n❉ Newly recorded audio commentary featuring Kim Newman and Barry Forshaw\n\n❉ Isolated score by Roy Budd\n\n❉ Mike Hodges in Conversation (2022)\n\n❉ Johnny Trunk on Roy Budd (2022): the founder of cult label Trunk Records revisits Roy Budd’s iconic score\n\n❉ Interview with Petra Markham (2022): newly recorded interview with the actress who recalls her work on Get Carter\n\n❉ Interview with Tony Klinger (2022): newly recorded interview with the son of the legendary Michael Klinger, producer of Get Carter\n\n❉ The Ship Hotel – Tyne Main (1967, 33 mins): Philip Trevelyan’s wonderful film about a pub on the banks of the River Tyne and the colourful cast of regulars who frequent it\n\n❉ International theatrical trailer\n\n❉ Michael Caine’s message to premiere attendees (1971, 1 min)\n\n❉ 2022 theatrical trailer\n\n❉ Script gallery\n\n❉ 80-page perfect-bound book featuring new writing by Mark Kermode, Tim Pelan, John Oliver and Jason Wood.
