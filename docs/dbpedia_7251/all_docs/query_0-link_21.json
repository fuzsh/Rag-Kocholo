        "text": "Get Carter (1971)\n\nDirector: Mike Hodges\n\nCast: Michael Caine, Ian Hendry, John Osborne & Britt Ekland\n\nRun time: 111 mins\n\nFormat: 2-disc limited edition UHD (only 10,000 copies available) & 2-disc limited edition Blu-ray (only 5,000 copies available).\n\nRelease date: 1 August 2022\n\nJamie Havlin watches the re-released Get Carter, arguably the grittiest and greatest of all British crime films.\n\nJack Carter (Michael Caine) is a hardman, a London gangland enforcer. Originally from Newcastle (but with no trace of a Geordie accent), he decides to return north when his brother Frank dies in mysterious circumstances, to conduct his own investigations.\n\nHe’s warned off doing so by his gangster bosses, Gerald and Sid Fletcher, who have crime connections in the North East, but Carter isn’t a man to heed advice. He suspects foul play and craves revenge.\n\nStraight off the train, he heads to a decrepit boozer and demands his beer be served in a long glass rather than a dimpled one, apparently an unusual request back then in a working-class city like this. He’s there to talk to Frank’s partner of sorts Margaret, but she is a no-show. He walks to Frank’s house and finds a shotgun above his bedroom wardrobe. This will come in handy.\n\nAfter attending the funeral with his teenage niece Doreen and two of his brother’s pals, Carter begins his investigation in earnest, searching for someone named Albert Swift, who is said to be a big horse-racing fan.\n\nAt Newcastle’s race track, he spies an old foe Eric Paice (Ian Hendry) and grills him about what he’s doing and who he works for. There’s no love lost between the pair and throughout the shoot, Hendry is said to have resented Caine for being given the lead role, as he was initially set to play Carter himself. During rehearsals, he turned up drunk and little progress was made due to Hendry’s belligerent attitude. This likely added an intriguing tension between the actors when the scene was filmed the following day and you can imagine Caine taking great pleasure in the line that follows him removing Eric’s sunglasses: ‘I’d almost forgotten what your eyes looked like. They’re still the same. Piss holes in the snow.’\n\nThe reason director Hodges had initially envisioned Hendry for the lead was that he had never imagined that a star of Caine’s magnitude might be interested in playing Carter. Not because the part wasn’t well written, but because Carter is such a hard character to sympathise with, an anti-hero who’s a bullying thug, arrogant, selfish and narcissistic. He laughs or grins only twice in film. Once when a fight breaks out between two middle-aged women in a bar, the other time once after carrying out a murder.\n\nDiscussing the character in his 2018 memoir Blowing the Bloody Doors Off, Caine insisted that he isn’t a psychopath, though, as Jack believes he is ‘defending his family’s honour’ and ‘killing people who deserve to be killed.’ Maybe, but he treats just about everyone appallingly, even Frank’s keen to help pal Keith (played by Alun Armstrong in his screen debut).\n\nHodges found most British crime films underwhelming and wanted Carter to reflect the utter vindictiveness and viciousness that had been revealed to the general public during the high-profile trials of the Krays and Richardsons in the late 1960s.\n\nJack Carter later follows Paice back to a country house where local gangster bigwig Cyril Kinnear is hosting a high stakes game of poker. Carter watches on and a drunk woman named Glenda lets it out that she has met his bosses, the last time they were in town.\n\nIt’s claimed that his brother drove his car into the Tyne while drunk, but this doesn’t sound like the actions of Frank to Jack.\n\nBack at the run down B&B where he’s staying, he has to fend off some heavies sent by Cliff Brumby, a corrupt entrepreneur who controls slot machines in amusement arcades, pubs and clubs locally. It won’t be the last hassle he attracts from hired muscle.\n\nBit by bit, Carter assembles together the truth of the events that led to Frank’s death. One significant piece of the jigsaw is supplied as he watches a porn film on a 16mm projector. Titled Teacher’s Pet, Jack is distraught to see that the cast not only includes Margaret, Glenda and Albert Swift, but Doreen too, playing the teacher’s pet. Jack’s lust for vengeance only increases from this moment onwards. He seeks out Swift immediately, and it isn’t for a social call.\n\nBrutal violence and brutalist architecture will soon combine in a clash between Carter and Brumby on the concrete top tier of Gateshead’s monolithic eyesore, the now demolished Trinity Square Car Park, where Brumby had planned to expand his moneymaking interests by opening a swanky new restaurant.\n\nThe body count will continue to rise, right up to a bloody denouement on a coal strewn beach where waste from the neighbouring colliery is dumped by a conveyor belt system into the North Sea. I doubt I’m giving too much away by noting this isn’t one of British cinema’s happiest endings but it is one of the most memorable.\n\nThe film was one of the ten biggest box-office hits of the year in Britain, although reviews weren’t always favourable. Recognition at the awards season was limited to a single BAFTA nomination: Ian Hendry for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nSince then, its reputation has grown. I first saw the film in 1990 as part of Alex Cox’s Videodrome series and before that decade had ended, Get Carter had found favour among the Britpop generation, with the image of Caine in his black, double-breasted trench coat, carrying a double-barrelled shotgun establishing itself as the ultimate in iconic retro imagery.\n\nQuite rightly, interest in Roy Budd’s soundtrack album also soared. Jazzy, but with a chilling electric harpischord sound and generous use of tabla drums – although there isn’t a single Indian character in the film – few scores in British cinema match its inventiveness.\n\nGet Carter has been very influential. As an example, watch Steven Soderbergh’s The Limey starring Caine’s old flatmate Terence Stamp and you’ll be struck by the similarities. Sadly, its resurgence in popularity also inspired a spate of terrible low budget ‘gangster chic’ duds but we can’t blame Hodges’ movie for these.\n\nIn a newly recorded introduction for the release, Michael Caine observes: ‘Some films are special. This is one of them.’ Few who watch it will disagree.\n\nNewly restored in 4K from the original camera negative by the BFI, Get Carter looks fantastic. Special features here are numerous and include an audio commentary featuring Mike Hodges, Michael Caine and Wolfgang Suschitzky (2000); an audio commentary featuring Kim Newman and Barry Forshaw (2022); isolated score by Roy Budd & The Sound of Roy Budd (Jonny Trunk explores the varied career of Roy Budd); Mike Hodges in Conversation (where the director discusses his career in an hour long interview recorded at BFI Southbank), and with the first pressing only, an 80-page book.\n\nFor more on the release click here for UHD details and here for Blu-ray details.\n\n~\n\nAll words by Jamie Havlin.
