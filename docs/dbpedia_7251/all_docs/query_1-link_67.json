        "text": "Not to be confused with several other Nordic sex symbols - it is hard not to confuse her with, say, Elke Sommer - she, somewhat surprisingly, hung on for a quarter-century after her showy starring role in The Night They Raided Minsky's (US, d. William Friedkin, 1968).\n\nOf her 40-odd films, about 15 were British, most famously the gangster classic, Get Carter (d. Mike Hodges, 1971), the (oc)cult horror, The Wicker Man (d. Robin Hardy, 1973) and the Profumo-based Scandal (d. Michael Caton-Jones, 1988).\n\nAn acceptable actress, she became more famous for her off-screen life, including marriage to Peter Sellers (1964-68), with whom she appeared in After the Fox (1966, US/It) and The Bobo (1967), and a tempestuous, headlining liaison with Rod Stewart.\n\nBibliography\n\nAutobiography, True Britt, 1980.\n\nBrian McFarlane, Encyclopedia of British Film"
