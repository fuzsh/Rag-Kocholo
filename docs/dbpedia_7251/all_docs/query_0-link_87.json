        "text": "Screenwriter David McKenna has been hired by Warner Bros. to script a remake of “Get Carter,” a 1971 MGM gangster film which starred Michael Caine and Britt Ekland, according to sources involved in the deal.\n\nWarners exec Jeff Robinoff is on the project, but no producers are yet attached.\n\nUni-monikered director Tarsem, best known for his musicvideos for rock bands such as R.E.M., is attached to helm the project.\n\nIn the original “Get Carter,” based on the novel “Jack’s Return Home,” by Ted Lewis, a racketeer goes to Newcastle, England, to avenge his younger brother’s death at the hands of gangsters. McKenna’s updated version will be moved to Los Angeles, but will retain the basic model of an older sibling investigating and taking vengeance for the younger’s death.\n\nFinancial details of the “Carter” deal were not disclosed.\n\nMcKenna wrote ensemble comedy-drama “Jello Shots,” which New Line last year picked up for a reported $500,000 against $650,000. He also penned the racism tale “American History X,” which stars Edward Furlong and Edward Norton, and is slated to lens early next year under director Tony Kaye; and the cocaine thriller “Blow,” which is being produced by director Ted Demme and actor-comic Denis Leary. Both are also New Line pics.\n\nMcKenna is repped by David Stein at CAA, and by attorney Mark Stankevich at Greenberg Glusker."
