        "text": "There’s something fascinating about the candid ‘behind the scenes’ shots from films. The tension before a take or the relaxation of the actors, directors, producers and crew are fully exposed.\n\nFilm-making has often been used as a means to suspend reality, but these shots cut through that, often revealing the cast and crew members in another light.\n\nGet Carter is a 1971 British crime film directed by Mike Hodges and starring Michael Caine, Ian Hendry,Britt Ekland, John Osborne and Bryan Mosley. The screenplay was adapted by Hodges from Ted Lewis’ 1969 novel Jack’s Return Home.\n\nThe story follows a London gangster, the eponymous Jack Carter (Caine), who travels back to his hometown to discover more about the events surrounding his brother Frank’s supposedly-accidental death. Suspecting foul play, he investigates and interrogates, getting a feel for the city and its hardened-criminal element; with vengeance on his mind, the situation builds to a violent conclusion.\n\nGet Carter is mainly set in North East England and was filmed in and around Newcastle upon Tyne, Gateshead, and County Durham. Principal photography took place in the from 17 July â 15 September 1970 (Source: Get Carter in Wikipedia)\n\nHere are some of the best ‘behind the scene’ shots and some of the locations where this classic film was set.\n\nPicture: Ian Hendry, windswept on Blackhall Beach\n\nPicture: Closing scene at Blackhall Beach.
