        "text": "This story is part of the July 16 edition of Sunday Life.See all 15 stories .\n\nIn The Wicker Man, the bonkers 1973 cult classic about pagan shenanigans on a Scottish island, Britt Ekland has one big scene as Willow, the innkeeper’s daughter. Singing an ethereal folk song, she performs a seductive naked dance. But if you watch closely, when the camera cuts from a topless Ekland to a rear view of her twerking vigorously, it’s clearly a different woman.\n\n“I’ve never liked my bum,” says Ekland. “And the thing is, I look at it today and it’s pretty good, even though it’s an old bum. And it obviously looked much better then, but I just thought it was too big.” So she made sure her contract stipulated a butt double and, while she was in London – taking a pregnancy test that revealed why her skirt had been getting tight – a Glasgow stripper with, ironically, a much broader booty came in to film those shots.\n\nAt age 80, Ekland’s hair is still dyed blonde, her slight figure is stiff-gaited but upright through rigorous Pilates. She’s dressed in tactile layers of cream and brown: a fake fur gilet, a big leopard-skin scarf. She is still recognisably the nubile Willow; or Bond girl Mary Goodnight, the ditzy trainee secret agent in The Man with the Golden Gun; or Michael Caine’s girlfriend in Get Carter, with whom he has the first cinematic depiction of phone sex.\n\nI buy from eBay a yellowing copy of her 1980 autobiography called (what else?) True Britt. The book begins with a newspaper report calling her “the most notorious sex bomb of our times” and ends with a memo to her then 38-year-old self: “I have made one pledge in my personal affairs. Never to sacrifice my career again for a man.”\n\nIn between are relationships with the biggest celebrities of her age, for which Ekland is more famous than her movies. When she met Peter Sellers, she was just 21 and in London to film Guns at Batasi with Richard Attenborough, the first movie in her just-announced seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox.\n\nShe’d barely heard of Sellers, then 38 and divorced with two children, so to impress her he took her by limo to watch him in The Pink Panther. Next morning, a whole florist’s shop was delivered to her room, followed by a whirl of expensive presents and hasty declarations of love. Within 10 days Sellers told a reporter they were getting married, before asking if it was okay by her. “I guess so,” she replied.\n\nWhen Sellers returned to Hollywood to work, he begged her to follow and she sneaked off the set of Guns at Batasi for the weekend. But she arrived in LA to find he’d bought a vast wardrobe of clothes, from bikinis to ballgowns, plus a whole rack of shoes, all her size. “You don’t need to go home,” he said, then nagged her to drop out of her film. 20th Century Fox sued, reshot her scenes with Mia Farrow and prevented Ekland from working for more than a year.\n\nIt sounds less a marriage than an abduction. “It probably was,” says Ekland. “He destroyed my career.” The couple had the same agent and Sellers secretly turned down roles on her behalf, then insisted she appear in his films – mainly, she thinks, to exert control.\n\nIntrinsic to Ekland’s appeal was the ’70s notion that Swedish women were sexually free. This baffled Ekland because her upbringing was so austere. Her family were wealthy bourgeoisie; her father ran an upmarket department store founded by her grandfather. Her childhood involved Sunday school and curtsying to older relatives.\n\nThanks to her resemblance to Brigitte Bardot, she won bit parts on Swedish TV, which led to bigger film roles in Italy. At 21, as a hot young starlet, finally free from her father’s rules, the last thing she wanted was a husband. “I saw my parents and their friends. I thought marriage was a horrible situation. The women were at home ironing and cooking, taking care of all the children. And the man, you know, he was out swanning around – he had bridge nights, curling nights and boating nights. Plus a bit on the side. I said ‘I will never marry’ – but that’s the first thing I did.”\n\n“I thought marriage was a horrible situation. The women were at home ironing and cooking, taking care of all the children.”\n\nBRITT EKLAND\n\nIf only, she says, she’d had a few years of carefree, flat-sharing fun. Instead she rapidly had a daughter, Victoria. Sellers was a friend of the royal family, all Goon Show fans, so she’d find herself on shooting weekends with the Queen or dinner parties with Princess Margaret. As a minor Swedish socialite who knew the king, Ekland was at ease. But Sellers’ moods oscillated between extravagant gift-giving and insomniac ravings, which she believes now was undiagnosed bipolar disorder. He also took amyl nitrate “poppers” while having sex with her, the catalyst to a massive heart attack that almost killed him. After four stormy years, she left.\n\nAfter the divorce, Ekland had affairs with an Italian count; Lord Lichfield, the Queen’s cousin (whom she dumped for being a bit dull); Lou Adler, a record and movie producer (with whom she had a son, Nic); and actor Ryan O’Neal. LA in the ’70s was for her a riotous La Ronde: she slept with George Hamilton, whose wife, Alana, married Rod Stewart after he’d dumped Ekland.\n\n“Maybe the fame circle was smaller in those days. Today, it’s so wide. But when you think how old I am and you count the number of affairs I have had, I think, compared with other, younger women, I really had very few. The thing that gave me that reputation is because they were all famous.”\n\nLike everyone else of the era, she slept with Warren Beatty, noting in her autobiography he “could handle women as smoothly as operating an elevator. He knew exactly where to locate the top button: one flick and we were on the way.” They met at a party hosted by Roman Polanski when Beatty was dating Julie Christie. “I have to say I feel quite ashamed that I did that. Still, I couldn’t resist the forbidden fruit.”\n\nBecause they couldn’t appear in public for fear of Christie finding out, Beatty took Ekland to porn cinemas. She was aghast. “Why would I want to see people having sex? To me, that’s just bizarre. What kind of pleasure do you get out of it? So basically, Warren and I had sex, and that was it.”\n\nWhen Ekland met Rod Stewart, she was already a Bond girl and almost as famous as him. It began at yet another LA party where Paul McCartney, Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell were jamming and asked Stewart to join them. But, as she proudly notes, he preferred to sit with her. In photographs they always looked about to rip off each other’s clothes, and indeed they’d make love four times a day, often nipping out of dinner parties for a quickie.\n\nThey lived in high pomp-rock style in a mansion. Even when they were dining alone she’d put on an evening dress and Stewart a tux. Ekland, two years older, brought sophistication, art, vintage clothes and fine living to Stewart, the working-class builder’s son. But Ekland says Stewart rarely bought her anything; indeed he demanded she pay rent and the phone bill. During their relationship she barely made a film, turning down roles to be at his side. The affair ended acrimoniously with Ekland – who’d uprooted herself from London to join him – taking out a $12.5 million lawsuit but eventually settling out of court for much less. “I don’t ever think about him now,” she says coldly.\n\nAfter Stewart, Ekland says, she went a little wild. “In the late ’70s, for let’s say two years, I was quite self-indulgent and had a lot of fun. But I’ve never written about it. Because it’s quite saucy.” What does she mean? “I was in LA, London, Paris, making TV and movies, doing personal appearances. And I behaved as a man. I’d point at someone in a nightclub and say, ‘Get me him!’ ”\n\nDid it work? “Oh, yes. I could have anybody I wanted. But I was not a promiscuous person. It was more knowing that I had the power to do so. Because the prequel is more fun than the actual …” Sex? “Yes. Having fun and being cheeky, rather than just getting down in the bed and doing the dirty.” She pulls a face.\n\nThen, aged 41, she married 23-year-old Stray Cats drummer Slim Jim Phantom, having a son, Thomas Jefferson, or TJ, when she was 46. (The marriage lasted eight years.) It is motherhood, she says, that kept her life on track. “I’ve had a child every decade. In my 20s, my 30s, my 40s.”\n\nWas it complicated negotiating with three different fathers? “Well, Sellers was not a father for a start. He never took care of Victoria.” Victoria became the cliché Hollywood wild child: posing in Playboy, ending up in rehab, running with a fast crowd. She is now 58 and a jewellery designer. Nic (“my most level-headed child”) has three children and is an entrepreneur who runs music festivals and restaurants in LA, while TJ, 35, is now a chef living in Sweden.\n\nLoading\n\nIt was because of TJ that, after her divorce from Phantom (“a wonderful ex”), Ekland gave up lovers. “I did not want to introduce another man, at least until he was 18. I felt I’d made a lot of mistakes with my children by introducing them to men.” So she’s been single for the past 25 years: “I can’t be bothered. It’s just too complicated.”\n\nNow Ekland lives between LA and the east coast of Sweden, travelling with her chihuahua-cross, Bowie, who has his own Instagram account. She is tough, forward-looking and has few regrets about wasted career chances. Her body, she says, is a little slower these days, but she’s convinced she won’t die, as her mother did, with Alzheimer’s. “A doctor told me I won’t get it.” She says of death, “I’m going to try not to leave too much shite behind for my children” and plans to sort out her belongings in a year or so.\n\nYet she’s never stopped fighting the ageing process. In the ’90s she had disastrous lip-filler injections. “I had terrible stuff done to me and had to live with the commentary: ‘Why did she do that to herself?’ ” She raises her chin so I can admire her smooth jawline from the facelift she had 20 years ago. At almost 81, Ekland still has Botox. “I am vain. Very vain. I always say, ‘The mirror is your best friend.’ But I’ve been looking like Britt Ekland since Britt Ekland was invented. And I refuse to give up now.”"
