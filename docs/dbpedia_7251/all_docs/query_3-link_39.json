        "text": "Her youthful appearance does not come easy. Ekland stays incredibly active with daily walks and still does weightlifting, but noted to The Mirror the best way to avoid looking older “is not to stress too much”.\n\nEkland claimed that in 1974 her enviable good looks got her into trouble with James Bond producer Albert Broccoli, who believed she was too thin and implored her to eat more during filming.\n\nShe claimed: \"There was a great Italian restaurant in Hong Kong where we were filming, and we always went there for dinner after shooting.\n\n\"Cubby would insist I ate two plates of spaghetti every time we went there. And I would sit there mortified, thinking about how I had to be in a bikini the next day.\"\n\nAlthough Ekland is admittedly not one for celebrating birthdays, this milestone was different, and not just for coinciding with the 60th anniversary of James Bond’s first appearance on-screen.\n\nAt the time, she shared: “Usually it’s just another day for me. But this year definitely called for champagne.”\n\nThe actress celebrated her big day in Paris last year surrounded by friends at a champagne birthday lunch."
