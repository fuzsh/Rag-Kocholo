        "text": "Kevin loves the films of the ’70s. This is an undisputed fact, as he has demonstrated time and again at movie night. And after seeing the always amazing Michael Caine in last time’s feature, Kevin decided to bring us an early Caine vehicle, all the way from 1971. Although this film was remade in 2000 with Sylvester Stallone in the lead role, we of course watched Mike Hodges’ original: Get Carter. Without any further ado, let’s get into it!\n\nOur film follows the irascible Jack Carter, a Newcastle-born, London-dwelling organized crime flunkie. We meet him amongst a coterie of other organized crime personalities in a smoky room where they are reviewing projection slides of pornography. As ones does, when one is in organized crime and one wants to get a head start on the extremely restrictive gun ban coming up in 26 years. Jack, however, has a wee bit of a problem. You see, his straight-arrow brother Frank up in Newcastle has just died, and he rejects the official explanation of a drunk-driving accident.\n\nSo Carter hops a train up north and begins to investigate his brother’s death. Oh, and attend the funeral – he did at least follow through on that formality. I am told (by Kevin, who went so far as to read the book) that Jack was always the naughty brother, and Frank was always the good brother, and Jack spent a lot of his time protecting Frank from being bullied by the crowd that was to grow up to be the next generation of Newcastle organized crime. So naturally, Carter assumes that the same crowd may have had a hand in Frank’s death. I should emphasize that, as any proper ’70s movie, this film pretty much forgets to point this aspect of the plot out, leaving us to imagine it if we dare. Or imagine a completely different and altogether wrong backstory. This film doesn’t care.\n\nSo Carter begins investigating, and as you might imagine, he runs into all sorts of bad guys. Well, OK, I mean, he knew these bad guys already, but they’re bad guys. They’re all bad guys. If they’re in the film, they’re bad guys. There’s some sort of factional war going on between the bad guys, and very little if any honor among thieves, but they’re all bad guys. Except the ones that are girls. But the ones that are girls are all basically bad, too – if not criminally, then at least in a morally-ambiguous sense. Jack, for his part, is ready, willing, and able to sleep with any of them – including the matronly operator of the B&B where he is staying. Don’t call it “Ew”, call it “May-December”.\n\nTo save time, and because there’s literally no way I could even remotely expose the plot (such as it is) in the order that the screenplay exposes it, I’ll just lay it out all at once: Frank’s teenage daughter – who might in point of fact properly be Jack’s teenage daughter (dur-hey!) – has through accident or intent been caught up in a pornography ring. Ven ze schoolteacher invites ze student over to her house for some tutoring, oh ze naughty-naughty, Mein Gott! Anyway, evidently Frank found out about this and was none too pleased. But organized criminals being organized criminals, they (or one in particular) forced Frank to drink a whole bottle of whiskey then engineered something that looked like an auto accident, yadda-yadda.\n\nThe whole plot of the film is carried forward via the sorts of things that were readily available in 1970’s England, such as empty car parks…\n\n…and scantily-clad women who are willing to go to any length for…well, whatever it is they’re after…\n\n…no matter what color their blouse and panties are. By the way, what color do you suppose her blouse and panties actually were? One of the questions that the promotional materials for this film will likely never answer.\n\nOf course, sometimes “any length” includes getting stuffed into the trunk of a Jaguar by Jack Carter and then dying when your organized crime friends ram the Jaguar into the river, but really, that’s neither here nor there.\n\nEventually, while eluding the grasp of the many Newcastle mafiosos who don’t want him digging into their business, Carter manages to identify the man that killed his brother. Rather than shoot him in the head, Jack decides to force feed him a bottle of Cutty Sark, and instead of waiting around to harvest his liver, he…how can I make sense of this? See, there’s this automated cable assembly here by the sea – you can see one of the hoppers suspended by the cables in the background of the still above – and apparently it’s carrying rock and gravel from somewhere…uphill…and taking it down to the seas to dump it in the water. So…it’s not ore. It’s not coal. I don’t really know what the hell it is. Are they digging a cave? Creating an artificial island? The world may never know. But like a cheap skilift operated by some freezing high school student whose highlight of his day is being told by the forty-something skilift operator who is obviously never going to amount to anything that “We used to sit around and smoke pot and listen to Dark Side and say that it was the greatest music ever written to get stoned to, but we were wrong…it’s the greatest music ever written!”, the gondola here occasionally comes a bit too close to the ground and Jack loads the now-drunk child pornographer into a gondola and watches him get dumped into the ocean. The E…oh, wait.\n\nThen a Newcastle organized crime sniper who has been barely even referenced in the film and who we didn’t know was a sniper suddenly shoots Carter in the head. The End."
