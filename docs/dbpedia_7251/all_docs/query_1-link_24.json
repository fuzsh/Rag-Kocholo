        "text": "The gangster film showcased the region's most iconic Brutalist buildings and huge country homes.\n\nGet Carter, starring Michael Caine, was released in 1971. It follows Jack Carter, a Cockney, who heads to Newcastle's violent underbelly to solve his brother's death. In 2004, a Total Film poll of critics chose it as Britain's best ever.\n\nREAD MORE: Look back at shipyards as hydrogen boats on horizon\n\nThe Trinity Square Car Park in Gateshead was made famous for its role in the 1971 Michael Caine movie Get Carter – particularly for a memorable chase sequence culminating in Caine throwing shady businessman Cliff Brumby, played by Bryan Mosley (Coronation Street’s Alf Roberts), to his death.\n\nDryderdale Hall, in County Durham, was also the backcloth to some of the most dramatic scenes in the cult movie.\n\nCarter confronted Kinnair during a card game in the lounge of the grade II-listed hall property and the body of a woman was dragged from a pond in the grounds before police descended on the house to arrest Kinnair and his henchmen.\n\nSir Michael Caine\n\nCaine starred in the crime film as Jack Carter after producer Michael Klinger signed him up for the role despite director Mike Hodges having Ian Hendry in mind.\n\nCaine was big at the time and well known for Alfie, The Italian Job and The Ipcress File.\n\nAnd the momentum behind the now 88-year-old did not slow down. He gained wide popularity for roles such as Alfred in The Dark Knight Trilogy and appeared in a range of Christopher Nolan's other movies like Inception, Interstellar and the recent Tenet.\n\nIn 2000, he was awarded a BAFTA Fellowship and was knighted by the Queen for his contribution to cinema.\n\nCaine is still active today.\n\nMike Hodges\n\nWritten and directed by Hodges, Get Carter was the 88-year-old's film debut.\n\nHe drew on his background with documentaries and researched Newcastle's criminal underworld in efforts to make the film realistic.\n\nToday, Get Carter remains one of his iconic movies alongside Flash Gordon (1980) and Black Rainbow (1989).\n\nHodges' most recent documentary, Murder by Numbers (2004), looks at the popularity of true crime and serial kills over the past twenty years.\n\nIan Hendry\n\nTipped as the lead, Hendry actually ended up playing Eric Paice in the film as his career was already in decline by the 70s.\n\nAccording to reports, the actor's alcoholism and poor physical condition were evident when filming.\n\nThe Ipswich-born man does however have North-East blood through his Durham-born mum. His dad was from Glasgow.\n\nHe is best known for his role in Get Carter and earlier TV shows like the first season of The Avengers and The Lotus Eaters.\n\nIn the 70s and 80s, he appeared in a number of films and TV shows, including Theatre of Blood (1973), The Passenger (1975) and For Maddie with Love (1980).\n\nHendry was declared bankrupt in the late 1970s.\n\nHe died on Christmas Eve in 1984, aged 53, from a gastrointestinal haemorrhage.\n\nJohn Osborne\n\nOsborne was an unusual choice for Cyril Kinnear, Carter's main adversary.\n\nA famous playwright, London-born Osborne was well known for his intense criticism of established social and political norms.\n\nAlso known as a political activist, his 1956 play Look Back in Anger transforming English theatre.\n\nHowever, Osborne was also eager for change so grabbed on to the Get Carter opportunity when his name was put forward by the producer's agent.\n\nHe later took on acting roles in Tomorrow Never Comes (1978) and Flash Gordon (1980).\n\nAfter a serious liver crisis in 1987, Osborne became diabetic and later died from complications. He died at home in Shropshire, aged 65.\n\nBritt Ekland\n\n​\n\nThe Swedish actress and singer Ekland appeared in a range of films throughout the 1960s and 1970s and was cast as the leading lady of Get Carter.\n\nEkland became a movie sex symbol after her role in the cult classic, doing on to appear as a Bond girl in The Man with the Golden Gun (1974).\n\nThe 78-year-old's later career has centred largely around TV shows and the stage, from a guest appearance on Loose Women to Cinderella at the Shaw Theatre in London.\n\nMore recently, the star appeared in Season 4 of BBC TV's The Real Marigold Hotel last year.\n\nEkland is still active today."
