There is nothing wrong with her performance whatsoever. Bach, on the other hand, gives for me the single worst performance of any lead Bond girl, worse even than that of Tanya Roberts. She's simply terrible. Beautiful, yes, but one of the most wooden actresses I've ever witnessed.\n\nI'm going to have to go with Loomis on this one. While Ekland's character could have been written better, her performance is much better than Bach's. I also think Ekland is sexier, so there you go.\n\nDefinately Barbara Bach - I think she's the better actress of the two. While Ekland is certainly a looker, she's one of my all-time worst Bond Girls (along with Tanya Roberts).\n\nAlthough Barbara Bach has the looks and does do a god job portraying XXX I defiantly think that Britt Ekland's performance surpasses Bach's even thought her looks are below Bach's in a Bond Girl sense.\n\nIn acting ability alone? Britt Ekland gets the nod but as a better Bond girl I'd say Bach.\n\nEkland for me. Bach didnt give any energy to the character XXX.\n\nEkland. I used to love Bach, but I have overlooked Ekland for a long time. Although, they are both VERY, VERY close in this race. Great thread!\n\nBarbara Bach all the way!!\n\nIf we're going srtictly on acting, I'd say Ekland since she stays consistent in her performance. Granted it's a badly written character, but in terms of performance Ekland does a better job than Bach. Bach has the better written character but has some accent issues that detract slightly from her performance. So in reality, it's more close than I have probably made it seem.\n\nBarbara Bach all the way!!\n\nI find it so hard to choose, they're both very beautiful women, but it just depends on the scenes they're in. Bach has a better film character though. It's such a close race....\n\nBoth are my least favorite Bond girls in the series. Ekland 's Goodnight was presented in a way I felt kind for sorry for her stupidity I didn't really want to see her killed, which I wanted to happen to Stacey Sutton. Bach, I really don't see what was the fuss is about. As gender disloyal as this may sounds she did a more credible performance as the cave girl in the comedy the Caveman than a sophisticated Russian agent.\n\nEdited by 007luvchild2, 04 January 2004 - 06:33 AM.\n\nI think barbra was one of the best ever! She did a great job acting..\n\nI wasn't really into Britt's character to much.. she was just ok\n\nEkland. She can actually move her facial muscles. Barbara Bach is sexier though.\n\nchristmas jones...oh dang that was not one of the choices i am sorry ...i would say ekland because she had a body on her to die for, her acting was not that great but i was to busy looking at her to care about her acting\n\nEkland. She showed heart, vigor, charisma (and a lot of skin!). Bach looked like she was trying out a new Vicodin regimen.\n\nEch...I find it very hard to say anything positive about either of them, really.\n\nOf the two, I would hafta pick Bach - Ekland was just incredibly irritating for me.\n\nI did find Eklands character particularly irritating whereas Bach's character was much better written and allowed Bach to put in the better of the two performances.\n\nI did find Eklands character particularly irritating whereas Bach's character was much better written and allowed Bach to put in the better of the two performances.\n\nAlthough I wasn't a fan of Bach's performance, I do agree that her character was much better of the two, and regardless of what I think of Bach's performance, it's in a position that no matter who played Goodnight, XXX would come off as a much better character.\n\nIn fact, I think that XXX was the \"female Bond\" that was pulled off the best...probably because it was more original at the time. God knows I'm sick of \"Bond's equals\"...especially Jinx.\n\nI did find Eklands character particularly irritating whereas Bach's character was much better written and allowed Bach to put in the better of the two performances.\n\nAlthough I wasn't a fan of Bach's performance, I do agree that her character was much better of the two, and regardless of what I think of Bach's performance, it's in a position that no matter who played Goodnight, XXX would come off as a much better character.\n\nIn fact, I think that XXX was the \"female Bond\" that was pulled off the best...probably because it was more original at the time. God knows I'm sick of \"Bond's equals\"...especially Jinx.\n\nI agree with your assessment....One thing I always find annoying about the latest Bond girl is they always talk about how their character is Bond equal whereas all the previous ones were bimbos and airheads....To be honest there haven't been that many bimbos and airheads in the Bond movie. Only two immediately jump to mind - Plenty in DAF and Goodnight in TMWTGG. I would Stacy in AVTAK too but technically she was neither a bimbo or an airhead.\n\nMost Bond women have been quite intelligent and independant.\n\nMost Bond women have been quite intelligent and independant.\n\nYes, they have been, actually. In pretty much each movie, each one has assisted Bond with some sort of knowledge, and with the exception of a few (Plenty, Goodnight, Stacy, and even Kara), have contributed something to Bond's success.\n\nIt's really amazing that the publics misconception about Bond women is still there!! Where does it come from?\n\nIt's really amazing that the publics misconception about Bond women is still there!! Where does it come from?\n\nPeople have short memories. I remember all the hype over Michelle Yeoh when TND was released. I kept thinking have these people never seen a James Bond film with a release date of 1977 or after?\n\nI love the do it all Bond girls, such as Holly, Wai Lin or Anya, but the others, Christmas, Kara and Mary Goodnight are just as much wonderful.\n\nIt's when they get overbaord in their category, such as Jinx slightly did, although it's not really that bad.\n\nThe Bond girl always has and I think always will have plenty of influence in the public's eye.\n\nI guess I am one of the few people who really liked the Jinx character.....but then it was the pretty incredible looking Halle Berry too\n\nOh indeed she was. I do like her alot, I just think it went a little too overboard on the famel Bond idea, with Wai Lin, it was all new and it worked. Jinx was fine though, she just could've restrained on her role, but it was very good nonetheless. I do like her.\n\nI have always been a fan of Halle Berry....I have always thought she was the most incredible looking actress...I think I first noticed her in EXECUTIVE DECISION.\n\nI love that film with Russell. Great plot! I also saw her in Swordfish, but I have yet to see her winning performance in Monster's Ball.\n\nMe too....I do like EXECUTIVE DECISION. I bought it on Laserdisc and then when I got my DVD player in 1997 it was a title I eagerly awaited (I have it now of course)"
