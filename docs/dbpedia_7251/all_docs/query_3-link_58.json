        "text": "Swedish actress Britt Ekland plays Mary Goodnight in THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN. Here, she answers some questions…\n\nWhat are your fondest memories of THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN?\n\nThere are so many but just being in Cubby Broccoli’s office and being told the part of Mary Goodnight was mine is forever etched in my memory. Flying with my children to Bangkok, filming in such an exotic place was very special. Meeting and becoming friends with Maud Adams and always having a great time together and working with Roger, who was the most non star-like actor I’d ever worked with. None of that staying in the trailer and only coming on set for the scene, he was always warm and jokey with everyone and had a very different sense of humor.\n\nHow much fun was it working with Roger Moore? And what was the best part about filming with him?\n\nThe best part of working with Roger was that he made you feel good about yourself and confident and that is a quality not a lot of actors have. It’s very scary to come on set and work with a famous star and even though I had co-starred in several American and English movies, I still felt very insecure! Roger did like to joke around and used to tease me and\n\nMaud, calling us Mud and Bert! Roger is a very charming man and it was ultimately one of the best movies I ever worked on, a very enjoyable time in my life.\n\nWhat scene was the most physically demanding for you?\n\nAny scene where you wear a bikini is demanding but I think\n\nthe scenes where Roger and I run from the explosions were difficult because of timing and of course if you watch the film you’ll see me, trying to throw myself on the ground as my bottom was too close to the explosive and Roger yanking me up and just kept going. Also running in high heel shoes, well wedges, is not easy."
