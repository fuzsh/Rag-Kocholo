Personal life

Ekland became famous overnight as a result of her 1964 whirlwind romance and marriage to British actor and comedian, Peter Sellers, who proposed after seeing her photograph in the paper and them meeting in London.[2][3] She stood by him after he suffered a series of massive heart attacks shortly after their marriage (July 24th 1980). Ekland was stepmother to Sellers' children Sarah and Michael (who died of heart attack at about the same age as his father). In January 1965 they had a daughter, Victoria. The couple made two films together, After the Fox in 1966 and The Bobo in 1967, before divorcing the following year (1968).

In June of 1973, she had a son, Nic Adler, with record producer Lou Adler. She also had a much-publicized romance with rock star Rod Stewart; they were introduced in 1975 by Joan Collins and lived together for over two years, with Ekland giving up her career to focus on the relationship.[citation needed] From 1979-1981 she dated and became engaged to Girl frontman and future L.A. Guns singer Phil Lewis.[citation needed]In 1984 she married rock musician James McDonnell (aka Slim Jim Phantom), who was almost two decades her junior. They had a son, Thomas Jefferson (born in 1988), and divorced in 1992.[citation needed]

In the 1970s Ekland was one of the most photographed and talked about celebrities in the world and in 1980 her best-selling autobiography, True Britt, was published.[4]

A close friend of Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne, she is still a regular fixture on the rock'n'roll social scene.[citation needed]

In 2004 Ekland was portrayed by Charlize Theron in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. Theron invited her to be her date at the Cannes Film Festival, where she became highly emotional when she saw the film. [5]

She was diagnosed with osteoporosis in 2004, (which she attributes to yo-yo dieting and low calcium)[6] after falling at an awards show and fracturing her wrist and ankle. She has been associated with both Alzheimer's and osteoporosis organizations. The actress is fluent in English, French, and German, in addition to her native Swedish.
