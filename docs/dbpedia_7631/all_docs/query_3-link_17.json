        "text": "Once publishers have a healthy subscriber base and are offering those subscribers content that engages them, how can they make sure the subscribers keep coming back?\n\nThe answer is Web Push Notifications. These are notifications that alert readers to new content that may be of interest to them. Notifications are delivered directly to a user’s browser, no matter what website they are viewing. A user can access the content instantly, simply by clicking on the notification which will take them directly to the article on the site.\n\nThis is an opt-in service, which is why securing visitor engagement in these previous steps is an essential foundation for the effectiveness of this process.\n\n“The digital publishing landscape is constantly evolving, and your audience’s attention is being pulled in more directions than ever before. To be successful in this highly competitive space, you have to stay at the forefront of digital marketing trends and technology. With Insider, that’s easy. The team is incredibly knowledgeable about industry challenges and how to tackle them, and has a wealth of ideas that are simple to implement, but have huge impact.”\n\nMarta Ogórkiewicz\n\nProduct Manager, Newsweek"
