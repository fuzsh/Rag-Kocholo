To continue building on these initiatives, we focus on fostering a culture of trust and belonging, empowering employees to embrace their unique identities and collaborate in strong, diverse teams to make an impact.”\n\n“Diversity is a widely discussed topic – and it remains a crucial factor as people look for an employer or a business partner,” said Nancy Cooper, Global Editor in Chief of Newsweek. “Newsweek and market-data research firm Plant-A Insights are proud to introduce ‘America’s Greatest Workplaces for Diversity 2024,’ highlighting companies that are committed to offering diverse and inclusive work environment.”\n\nHenkel North America’s team of over 8,000 colleagues in North America is united through a purpose as pioneers at heart for the good of generations, striving to enrich and improve everyday life for employees, customers, partners, and consumers. Through tools such as Employee Resource Groups ‏(ERGs) which represent more than 2,000 employee voices, ongoing career development, and a variety of programs designed to connect employees with each other and with local communities, Henkel works to create an environment where employees are supported, heard, and encouraged to excel."
