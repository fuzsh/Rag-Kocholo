The company ranked #78 among the top 100 companies recognized globally for employee happiness and satisfaction at work.\n\n“We are delighted to be acknowledged by Newsweek, particularly since it stems from the positive feedback from our employees,” said Jeff Schmitz, Chief People Officer, Zebra Technologies. “At Zebra, we prioritize attracting, retaining, and developing our people who are at the heart of everything we do, and together, we create new ways of working that make everyday life better for organizations, their employees, and those they serve.”\n\nZebra is committed to building a robust culture by driving a positive experience for employees and creating an environment in which employees are inspired to succeed as a team and grow as individuals. The company offers a variety of programs to foster a sense of belonging and support. For example, Zebra’s Culture Connect online engagement hub links employees to reflection exercises, training courses, and learning plans that empower teams to embody the company’s values.\n\nIn addition, Zebra has a Culture Champion Network to build employee engagement, and nine employee-driven, executive-sponsored employee resource groups (ERGs) to cultivate inclusion and respect. The company also celebrates collaboration and positive outcomes through its global recognition program known as GEM (Going the Extra Mile), advancing a shared commitment to Zebra’s success.\n\n“As workplaces continue to shift, it’s clearer than ever that fostering collaboration, embracing a positive outlook, and aligning values are essential,” said Nancy Cooper, Global Editor in Chief of Newsweek. “The companies celebrated on the 2024 Global Most Loved Workplaces® list truly embody these principles. They show us that by championing respect and team-oriented outcomes, they’re not just building great workplaces, they’re shaping a brighter future for all.”\n\nZebra’s certification as a Most Loved Workplace is based on its scores on the Love of Workplace Index™ based on surveyed employees regarding elements around employee satisfaction and sentiment including the level of respect, collaboration, support, and sense of belonging they feel inside the company.\n\n\"I started Most Loved Workplaces out of inspiration from my community of people who consciously place love for their employees at the center of their business model,\" said Louis Carter, the Founder, and CEO of BPI and a Social/Organizational Psychologist, Thought Leader, Entrepreneur, and Author.\n\nTo view the full list, visit: Top 100 Global Most Loved Workplaces® 2024.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nZebra Technologies is ranked #78 on Newsweek’s list of Global Most Loved Workplaces®.\n\nThe list includes the top 100 companies for employee happiness and satisfaction at work in 2024.\n\nMore than 175 companies and more than 3,000 executives worldwide were surveyed to develop the findings in the Love of Workplace Index™.\n\n###\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nBPI measures five primary areas to determine how employees feel about where they work to create the Most Loved Workplaces® list: the level of collaboration at the workplace, how positive workers are about their future at the company, how much employer values align with employee values; respect at all levels and career achievement.
