        "text": "Dr Dev Pragad is the CEO of Newsweek Magazine. Since taking the helm of the company in 2016, he has radically transformed the business. He implemented a digital-first strategy and pushed Newsweek strongly into the digital era, which saw its digital readership grow from six million readers a month to 60 million plus across all platforms in less than three years.\n\nShortly after his PhD from King’s College London in 2009, he founded the UK edition of IBT – a business and general interest publication – and entered into the digital publishing business. He started the business with three staff and grew it to a multi-million dollar a year business in five years with over 150 staff and offices based in London’s Canary Wharf.\n\nHis success saw him acquire the license to publish Newsweek International edition from London between 2014 and 2016. His business acumen lead to the eventual acquisition of the US business of Newsweek in 2016, which was completed in 2018 with him becoming a majority owner of the Newsweek publication.\n\nDev is an investor and entrepreneur in a number of startups and serves as a mentor and advisor. He continues to lead Newsweek through the radically changing digital media landscape and revitalizing the iconic brand.\n\n*This is a King's invite-only event. All staff and students at King's are welcome to attend. Attendees should please register at the provided link."
