And yet I still cannot access any of the issues. Newsweek needs to fix this problem.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI have been using the Newsweek app update (6.0.1) for a few weeks. It still stinks. How can Newsweek say this is an update? It takes a long time for EACH page to load. In the past, an entire issue could be downloaded in the same amount of time it now takes to load one short article. I will not renew my subscription if this problem is not fixed.\n\nAnother update:\n\nI downloaded the latest Newsweek app update (Version 7.0.0) and I must say that I believe you got it right this time. An entire issue can now be downloaded quickly. Thanks for correcting the previous horrible app."
