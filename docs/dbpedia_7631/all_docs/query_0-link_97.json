Anyway I'm looking to subscribe to a newsweekly since I feel the need to keep my mind stimulated now I'm no longer studying.\n\nMany people seem to favour the Economist. Any idea why? I've heard reports they don't really send journalists anywhere, just kind of pick up syndicated stories here and there. I know newsweek has a bit of a reputation now as being an opinion journal, but is well known for it's photography. I don't know much about Time mag but I get the feeling it's a little wishy washy for me. I won't go into my political persuassions but I really just want a reasonably middle-unbiased (as is realistically possible) type magazine.\n\nAny opinions or thoughts. For the time being I'd like to keep it to these three magazines, no websites or other media please\n\nMar 2, 2010 at 3:58 AM Post #2 of 57\n\nmarvin\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 12, 2005\n\nPosts\n\n2,580\n\nLikes\n\n18\n\nEconomist regardless of political persuasion. It's much meatier than the other two.\n\nI prefer the Atlantic (monthly) or City Journal (quarterly) but those aren't weeklies like the three you mentioned.\n\nMar 2, 2010 at 6:15 AM Post #3 of 57\n\nDeusEx\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nSep 13, 2007\n\nPosts\n\n1,939\n\nLikes\n\n17\n\nLocation\n\nCalifornia\n\nEconomist by far, for pure quality for content.\n\nMar 2, 2010 at 6:31 AM Post #4 of 57\n\nmesasone\n\n100+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nNov 28, 2009\n\nPosts\n\n433\n\nLikes\n\n10\n\nI don't subscribe to any of those, but the only one I would consider is The Economist. Time and Newsweek have always struck me more as \"lobby filler\" appealing the LCD.\n\nI also like The Atlantic, they usually cover very interesting topics.\n\nMar 2, 2010 at 6:46 AM Post #5 of 57\n\nroadtonowhere08\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nMar 6, 2004\n\nPosts\n\n4,111\n\nLikes\n\n11\n\nBoth Time and Newsweek are mostly sensationalist nonsense. Newsweek is by far the worst when you look at some of their covers and then read the articles. It's just downright irresponsible journalism. I am not familiar with The Economist, but it cannot possibly be worse.\n\nMar 2, 2010 at 1:51 PM Post #6 of 57\n\ntrevorlane\n\n500+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nJul 7, 2004\n\nPosts\n\n571\n\nLikes\n\n23\n\nI am for the Economist and Atlantic, although I admit reading the Economist can sometimes be like reading the Op/Ed for the NYTimes\n\nMar 2, 2010 at 2:20 PM Post #7 of 57\n\nVicAjax\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nJan 16, 2004\n\nPosts\n\n4,622\n\nLikes\n\n13\n\nthe Economist, for its great analysis from a pragmatic, free-market perspective.\n\nMar 2, 2010 at 6:33 PM Post #8 of 57\n\nrobjrock\n\n100+ Head-Fier\n\nJoined\n\nJan 14, 2009\n\nPosts\n\n416\n\nLikes\n\n20\n\nOk I'm convinced. Going to take out a subscription for both the Economist & New Scientist.

Excellent source. I also subscribe to Business Week, also pretty good and complementing the Economist, but not as good.\n\nNewsWeek, Time and US News and World Report are not in the same league.\n\nMar 2, 2010 at 8:52 PM Post #11 of 57\n\nVicAjax\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nJan 16, 2004\n\nPosts\n\n4,622\n\nLikes\n\n13\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by robjrock /img/forum/go_quote.gif\n\nOk I'm convinced.

Interesting articles about a broad range of topics, well-written and clear, and with no hesitations about injecting a perspective that is reasonable and centrist into their analysis. Like trevorlane, I also highly recommend the Atlantic as a nice counterpoint to the Economist... the Economist goes broad and shallow (many shorter articles giving you a nice executive summary of an issue), whereas the Atlantic writes some truly fantastic in-depth pieces.\n\nMar 2, 2010 at 9:36 PM Post #13 of 57\n\nrhythmdevils\n\nMember of the Trade: rhythmdevils audio\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 11, 2005\n\nPosts\n\n8,225\n\nLikes\n\n485\n\nfox news is the only reliable news source these days\n\n[size=xx-small]*cough cough*[/size]\n\nMar 2, 2010 at 10:50 PM Post #14 of 57\n\nSuperpredator\n\nHeadphoneus Supremus\n\nJoined\n\nNov 5, 2005\n\nPosts\n\n2,436\n\nLikes\n\n18\n\nI've always considered The Economist to be the Bose of newsweeklies, but I'd still read it before Newsweek and way before Time. I like The New Yorker, The Atlantic, and sometimes The Nation."
