        "text": "Online learning, whether as a new student or a returning student, can be overwhelming. Choosing the right institution and program is a big decision and investment, but platforms like Sophia are hoping to make access to higher education less daunting.\n\nAnd now, we’ve been named one of Newsweek’s “America’s Top Online Colleges and America’s Top Online Learning Providers 2024.” Sophia earned a five-star rating – the highest possible ranking – demonstrating our commitment to providing quality education options to the students who need them most.\n\nFor Dr. Shawna Thayer, CEO of Sophia, the award validates our mission and gets us closer to our goal of making a college degree within reach.\n\n“At Sophia, we strive to remove some of the barriers to higher education and provide accessible, affordable education options to assist students in their pursuit of a degree or professional development,” said Thayer.\n\n“It’s an honor to be recognized for our efforts. Our goal has been to support our students with an intuitive, high-quality, online learning platform that helps students at any stage of their education journey. We’re very proud of the integrated experience we’ve created for our students, and earning a spot in the ‘Top Online Learning Platforms’ is a wonderful acknowledgement of our efforts.”\n\nWhat Is Newsweek’s “Top Colleges and Top Online Learning Providers” Award?\n\nNewsweek, a revered staple of American media and journalism for over 80 years, is a trusted source for information and rankings for universities and colleges as students navigate higher education.\n\nNow in its third consecutive year, Newsweek’s “America’s Top Colleges and Top Online Learning Providers” is a collaboration between the publication and Statista, the respected global data firm. Rankings are based on a survey of over 9,000 online learners and internal research for a comprehensive overview.\n\nIn 2024, Newsweek evaluated and ranked 200 colleges and universities that offer online undergraduate and graduate programs. Each awarded institution has been given a star rating for comparison.\n\nFor “Top Online Learning Providers,” Newsweek evaluated and selected 50 esteemed organizations that provide online courses and certificate and non-certificate programs to help aspiring students reach their personal and professional goals. These organizations are given a star rating for comparison and valuable data to assist with the decision-making process.\n\nHow Are Schools and Learning Platforms Evaluated?\n\nThe ratings and rankings for Newsweek are evaluated with support by Statista, which surveyed more than 9,000 online students. They were asked to identify their schools or online learning platforms, then share their experiences by rating institutions according to the following criteria:\n\nOrganization\n\nSupport\n\nCost\n\nReputation\n\nSuccess\n\nPractical relevance\n\nSatisfaction\n\nLikelihood to recommend the institution to others\n\nAll colleges, universities, and platforms received star awards. Institutions needed a minimum rating to receive an award, with five stars showing an aggregate score that surpasses the median of all recognized institutions.\n\nAbout Sophia\n\nSophia is an online learning platform that allows students to get started or continue their education – no matter the stage in their journey.
