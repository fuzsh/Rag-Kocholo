        "text": "Unisys Named Among 100 Global Companies for Employee Sentiment and Satisfaction\n\nBLUE BELL, Pa., June 18, 2024 – Unisys (NYSE: UIS) is excited to announce its placement on Newsweek’s prestigious Top 100 Global Most Loved Workplaces® list for the first time. The company’s focus on core aspirational behaviors – exploration, experimentation, agility and ownership – creates a vibrant culture where every employee can thrive. This distinction reflects the empowering environment at Unisys, which has been instrumental in fostering employee satisfaction and professional growth.\n\n\"We are thrilled to be recognized by Newsweek and stand among the world’s most loved workplaces. This achievement is a testament to every one of our employees who contribute to making Unisys a great place to work,” said Ruchi Kulhari, senior vice president and chief human resources officer at Unisys. “Our employees are the best and the brightest, and they take great pride in building a collaborative, inclusive and winning environment that encourages everyone to push the boundaries of what is possible every day.”\n\nHow positive workers feel about their future at the company, career achievement, how much employer values align with employee values, respect at all levels, and the level of collaboration at the firm were the five critical areas measured to gauge employee sentiment. In addition, areas such as inclusion, employee wellness, diversity, career development and company leadership were identified and analyzed in relation to the five critical areas measured.\n\n“As workplaces continue to shift, it’s clearer than ever that fostering collaboration, embracing a positive outlook and aligning values are essential. The companies celebrated on the 2024 Global Most Loved Workplaces® list truly embody these principles. They show us that by championing respect and team-oriented outcomes, they’re not just building great workplaces, they’re shaping a brighter future for all.” - Nancy Cooper, Global Editor in Chief of Newsweek.\n\nThe results were determined after surveying more than 2 million employees from businesses with workforces varying in size from 30 to more than 10,000. The list recognizes companies that put respect, caring and appreciation for their employees at the center of their business model and, in doing so, have earned the loyalty and respect of the people who work for them.\n\nClick here to read more about why Unisys is a Most Loved Workplace® for 2024.\n\nAbout Newsweek\n\nNewsweek is the modern global digital news organization built around the iconic, over 85-year-old American magazine.
