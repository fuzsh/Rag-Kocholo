        "text": "Newsweek magazine plans to end its print publication after 80 years, shifting to an all-digital format starting in early 2013.\n\nJob cuts are expected.\n\nThe news magazine will be available online and on tablet computers, editor-in-chief Tina Brown said on the magazine’s website this morning. Its last print version will be the Dec. 31 issue.\n\n“We are transitioning Newsweek, not saying goodbye to it,” Brown said. “We remain committed to Newsweek and to the journalism that it represents. This decision is not about the quality of the brand or the journalism — that is as powerful as ever. It is about the challenging economics of print publishing and distribution.”\n\nThe digital-only publication, supported by paid subscriptions and dubbed Newsweek Global, will be aimed at a “highly mobile, opinion-leading audience who want to learn about world events in a sophisticated context,” Brown said.\n\nNewsweek was founded in 1933 and has been undergoing an identity crisis and financial turmoil in recent years. Its problems are emblematic of the disruptions faced broadly by the print media industry, as readers shift online and away from the most valuable advertising.\n\nThe Patriot-News next year is going to three-day-a-week publishing, with 24-hour news on PennLive\n\nBrown cited a Pew Research Center report that found 39 percent of Americans get their news from an online source."
