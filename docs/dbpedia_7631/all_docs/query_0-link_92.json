        "text": "Cincinnati Children’s has been ranked by Newsweek as among the “World’s Best Hospitals 2021.”\n\nBecause of its focus on pediatrics, Cincinnati Children’s was categorized as among the Top Specialized Hospitals. Pediatric hospitals were selected based on recommendations from medical experts such as doctors, hospitals managers, and health care professionals.\n\nFive other pediatric hospitals in the United States were recognized along with Cincinnati Children’s, and Newsweek listed each alphabetically:\n\nBoston Children’s\n\nChildren’s Hospital of Los Angeles\n\nChildren’s Hospital of Philadelphia\n\nTexas Children’s\n\nUPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh\n\nOther pediatric hospitals listed were in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThis was the third year that Newsweek partnered with data research firm Statista Inc. to rank hospitals. Cincinnati Children’s also made the list in 2020 and 2019.\n\n“As the events of 2020 made clear, our lives and those of our loved ones may rest on the kind of health care we have access to,” noted Nancy Cooper, global editor in chief of Newsweek. “The 2,000 hospitals named in this list – which covers 25 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Canada – stand out for their consistent excellence, including distinguished physicians, top-notch nursing care and state-of-the-art technology.”\n\nCooper added that she hoped the ranking of the World’s Best Hospitals 2021 could help readers feel confident making critical choices about medical care.\n\nView Newsweek’s latest list of Top Specialized Hospitals.\n\nView Newsweek’s full list of Best Hospitals in the United States.\n\nView Newsweek’s Top 200 Global list.\n\nRead more about why Cincinnati Children’s is a leader in pediatric care, research, and professional education."
