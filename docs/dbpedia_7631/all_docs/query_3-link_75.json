        "text": "Newsweek Media Group hopes to strengthen its ties to Olivet University, a small Christian college with ties to Korean-American pastor David Jang, the media company’s co-owner said in an interview published Wednesday.\n\nThe connection between the Newsweek magazine parent and Olivet sparked a major upheaval at the media company in the last several weeks — as three staffers were fired and at least 12 resigned over the matter.\n\nNMG co-founder Johnathan Davis on Wednesday tried to calm the staff by agreeing to install an ombudsman to oversee standards going forward, according to the interview in International Business Times. NMG owns IBT.\n\nThe upheaval was fueled when three staffers, working on a story about NMG’s financial connections to Olivet, were fired.\n\nLate Tuesday, the unfinished work of the three fired journalists was completed by five staffers — and the investigative report was on Newsweek’s Web site.\n\nAn editor’s note affixed to the top of that story details the stunning revelations on how the five staffers who completed the story threatened to resign if the completed story wasn’t published.\n\nIn the end, NMG brass blinked — and approved the publication.\n\nThe report details a shady 2016 deal in which Olivet offered officials in Dutchess County — about 75 miles north of Midtown Manhattan — free advertising in Newsweek.\n\nAt the time, Olivet was seeking tax breaks and permits to build a new campus on the site of the local abandoned Harlem Valley Psychiatric Hospital.\n\nThe officials accepted the offer and Newsweek ran 10 full-page ads — valued at $149,000, according to the company’s ad rates — touting the area’s Hudson Valley Regional Airport and Dutchess County tourism, the report said.\n\nBut the most jaw-dropping part of the story was the lengthy “Note from the editors” atop the report, which slammed NMG brass for firing Newsweek Editor Bob Roe, Executive Editor Ken Li and Senior Politics Reporter Celeste Katz “for doing their jobs.”\n\n“As we continued working on the story, we were asked to take part in a review process which, we ultimately learned, involved egregious breaches of confidentiality and journalism ethics,” the note continued.\n\n“We believe that subjects of the story were shown parts of the draft, if not the entire piece, prior to publication by a company executive who should not have been involved in the process,” the note continued. “At an on-the-record interview with the subjects of this story, a company official asked editors to identify confidential sources. On-the-record sources were contacted and questioned about their discussions with Newsweek Media Group reporters.”\n\nThe staffers, in the note, said they “resisted their efforts to influence the story.”\n\nIt is not known whether the report will be included in an upcoming print issue.\n\nThe staff upheaval was punctuated by a raid of NMG offices by the Manhattan District Attorney on Jan. 18.\n\nThe DA is investigation possible financial crimes committed by NMG.\n\nCalls and e-mails to NMG for comment were not returned."
