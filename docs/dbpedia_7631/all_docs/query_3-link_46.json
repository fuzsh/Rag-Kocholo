        "text": "IBT Media is an American global digital news organization with over 90 million monthly readers.[1] It publishes the International Business Times and Medical Daily, among others. IBT Media is headquartered in New York City, in the Hanover Square neighborhood of Lower Manhattan.[2] As of 2014, the company posted revenue of about $21 million and generated a profit of about $500,000.[1]\n\nOverview[]\n\nFounded as IBT Media in 2006, the company has several brands that it has built organically through specialty vertical sites and also international editions.[3]\n\nIBT Media focuses on online publication.\n\nCorporate structure and revenue[]\n\nIBT Media is a privately held company, owned by Etienne Uzac and Johnathan Davis.[citation needed] The company has not received outside funding,[4] and has grown with a focus on being an \"efficient company\", concentrating on the \"revenue side as well as on the expenses\".[5][6]\n\nIt started in 2006, with personal savings, an SBA bank loan, and no input, financial or advisory, from VCs.[clarification needed][4] It has been profitable since 2010.[3][4][5][6]\n\nIt has also grown through the acquisition of Newsweek.[7].\n\nThe company derives its profits primarily from advertising and has been profitable since 2010.[6] It says it has recently undertaken new ventures to become a \"multi-product global media group\"[8] and to diversify capital, including adopting Newsweek's subscription models across its properties, and launching a new business-to-business arm.[3][5][9]\n\nOn September 14th, 2018, after completing the strategic structural changes initially announced in March, IBT Media has spun off into two separate companies — Newsweek and IBT Media.\n\nPartnerships[]\n\nIBT Media says it has an ongoing \"working relationship\" with Olivet University which includes the school providing design assistance and computer resources, and IBT Media providing internships for students. It characterizes it as similar to the relationships Silicon Valley companies have with local universities.[7] However, publication Christianity Today alleges that IBT Media has a close relationship both with Olivet and with its founder, controversial[7][10] evangelical pastor David J. Jang. It claims that Jang is an investor in and has exercised control over IBT Media, that Davis was formerly director of journalism at Olivet, and that Uzac was its Treasurer, at least at one time.[7][11][12] Executives characterize the relationship as between the institutions and not the founders, and that it was purely operational.[6][7]\n\nIBT Media is part of Economist's \"Ideas Channel\", an ad-network based on mindset rather than demographics, set up in part to reach \"an intellectual and often influential audience interested in business, politics and science\".[13] The company's Bizu video platform partners with IDG Communications and France 24. for content, and Digitas and PJA Advertising and others for monetization of the platform.[8][14]\n\nThe company's brands publish to a number of 3rd party platforms, including Flipboard, Zite, and The Washington Post's Social Reader.[15]\n\nControversies[]\n\nIn January 2018 Manhattan District Attorney staff raided the company's offices, taking away eighteen computer servers, in what Newsweek reported was part of an investigation into company finances. On 1 February 2018 co-owner and chairman, Etienne Uzac, and his wife Marion Kim who acted as finance director, resigned.[16][17]\n\nOn 20 February 2018 Newsweek reported on the DA's investigation into its parent company, and its relationship with Olivet University.[17] Following the publication of the story, several Newsweek staff were fired and some editors threatened to resign stating that management had tried to interfere in the story's publication.[18][19]\n\nOn 10 October 2018, it was reported by the Wall Street Journal that IBT Media was charged with defrauding lenders.[20]\n\nInnovations[]\n\nIBT Media had run on a proprietary content management system that it has built over several years. The company started to tie-in real-time analytics into the newsroom as early as 2010, and based on those results, optimize follow-up content, positioning, and editorial calendars to serve readers. Social feedback is also built into the newsroom.[21]\n\nThe company has also created platforms for content. Bizu, a video platform for business professionals hosts content and also offers incremental revenue streams to content providers.[8]\n\nAssets[]\n\nInternational Business Times – global business and economic news, in seven languages across ten editions[22]\n\nMedical Daily – medical news site[23][24]\n\nLatin Times – Latin American-oriented news site[23][25]\n\niDigitalTimes – technology and digital media news site[23][26]\n\nChronology[]\n\n2006 – International Business Times incorporates in New York.[27]\n\n2008–2010 - IBTimes launches specialty verticals: Jobs, Health, Real Estate, Education and Travel.\n\n2011 – IBTimes moves into Newsweek's old offices after 1200% growth for the year.[2]\n\n2012 – International Business Times reincorporates as IBT Media, the new parent company to IBTimes, and launches Bizu, a video web portal and platform.[14]\n\n2013 – Medical Daily, HollywoodTake, and Latin Times[28] are launched.\n\n2013 – Newsweek is acquired.[29][30]\n\n2014 – Newsweek returns to print,[31] and the Newsweek operations becomes profitable [32]\n\n2017 – Company rebrands as Newsweek Media Group\n\n2018 - Company rebrands back to IBT Media after the spun off.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
