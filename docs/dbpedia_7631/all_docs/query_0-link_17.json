        "text": "About Newsweek Fact Check's Bias Rating\n\nNewsweek Fact Check is a fact check source with an AllSides Media Bias Ratingâ„¢ of Center.\n\nNewsweek Fact Check is the fact-checking section of Newsweek (Center bias).\n\nAn independent review of Newsweek Fact Check conducted in March 2023 by AllSides Managing Editor Henry A. Brechter (Center bias) noted a balanced focus on fact-checking claims made by or about prominent politicians, and providing context on popular issues.\n\nWhat a \"Center\" Rating Means\n\nSources with an AllSides Media Bias Rating of Center either do not show much predictable media bias, display a balance of articles with left and right biases, or equally balance left and right perspectives.\n\nCenter doesn't mean better! A Center media bias rating does not necessarily mean a source is totally unbiased, neutral, perfectly reasonable, or credible, just as Left and Right don't necessarily mean extreme, wrong, unreasonable, or not credible. AllSides encourages people to read outlets across the political spectrum.\n\nLearn more about Center ratings\n\nCommunity Feedback\n\nFeedback does not determine ratings, but may trigger deeper review.\n\nAs of August 2024, people have voted on the AllSides Media Bias Rating for Newsweek Fact Check. On average, those who disagree with our rating think this source has a Lean Left bias.\n\nConfidence Level\n\nConfidence is determined by how many reviews have been applied and consistency of data."
