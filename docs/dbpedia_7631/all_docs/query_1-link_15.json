        "text": "About Newsweek's Bias Rating\n\nNewsweek is featured on the AllSides Media Bias Chart™.\n\nNewsweek is a news media source with an AllSides Media Bias Rating™ of Center.\n\nNewsweek's bias has shifted significantly in recent years, and was rated Left prior to 2020.\n\nWhat a \"Center\" Rating Means\n\nSources with an AllSides Media Bias Rating of Center either do not show much predictable media bias, display a balance of articles with left and right biases, or equally balance left and right perspectives.\n\nCenter doesn't mean better! A Center media bias rating does not necessarily mean a source is totally unbiased, neutral, perfectly reasonable, or credible, just as Left and Right don't necessarily mean extreme, wrong, unreasonable, or not credible. AllSides encourages people to read outlets across the political spectrum.\n\nLearn more about Center ratings\n\nNewsweek Bias Rating Confirmed as Center in March 2024 AllSides Media Bias Audit™\n\nNewsweek Rating Confirmed as Center in May 2023 Editorial Review\n\nNewsweek Rated Center in Feb. 2022 Blind Bias Survey\n\nNewsweek Rated Center in 2020 Editorial Reviews\n\nNewsweek Rated Left in May 2020 Independent Review\n\nNewsweek Rating Confirmed as Center in May 2024 AllSides Media Bias Audit™\n\nThe March 2024 bias reviews are the result of an AllSides Media Bias Audit™, which was requested and paid for by Newsweek. Learn more about our bias audit services for publications and journalists and how we keep bias audits objective.\n\nNewsweek was awarded an AllSides Media Bias Rating of Center (-0.52 on the AllSides Media Bias Meter™) in March 2024, following an AllSides Media Bias Audit™ that incorporated input from over 1,300 Americans across the political spectrum and a multipartisan panel of bias experts. After weighing this with past data from AllSides reviews, Newsweeks' overall bias rating is Center (-0.45).\n\nThe bias audit's Center (-0.52) result is an average of the following reviews conducted in March 2024:\n\nAn AllSides March 2024 Blind Bias Survey of Newsweek’s online, written news content that returned a rating of Center (-0.51).\n\nAn AllSides Editorial Review of Newsweek’s written news content that returned a rating of Center (-0.53).\n\nNewsweek Rated Center in March 2024 Blind Bias Survey\n\nA total of 1,313 people across the political spectrum took the March 2024 Blind Bias Survey.\n\nRespondents who self-identified as being Lean Right rated Newsweek as Lean Left, on average. Respondents in all other bias categories – Left, Lean Left, Center, and Right — all rated the outlet as Center, on average.\n\nNewsweek Rated Center in March 2024 Editorial Review\n\nAn Editorial Review by a panel of six reviewers on the left, center, and right returned a Center rating (-0.52) for Newsweek. The panel did not review opinion and editorial content.\n\nThe average of all panelist ratings was Center. The panel noted Newsweek did not exhibit much partisan bias, except for some occasional indicators of bias to the left. The panel did detect some sensationalism in Newsweek content.\n\nNewsweek Rating Confirmed as Center in May 2023 Editorial Review\n\nAn AllSides panel of reviewers on the left, center, and right returned a Center rating (-0.29) for Newsweek in a May 2023 Editorial Review, confirming AllSides' existing rating for the outlet.\n\nNewsweek was reviewed following concerns from AllSides reviewers and readers that Newsweek was beginning to Lean Left. However, a review of Newsweek's content found a Center bias.\n\nThe panel noted that story choice was relatively balanced — some stories appealed to the left (such as articles about beauty inclusivity, climate change, many stories casting Donald Trump negatively, and criticism of Republican governors) while others appealed to the right (such as articles that cast the Biden family in a negative light and Bud Light backlash amid its transgender marketing campaign). All but one member of the panel agreed there were, however, more Lean Left than Lean Right news story choices.\n\nNewsweek's Opinion section had a variety of views on the left and right, though slightly more on the right at the time of review. There was some discussion as to whether AllSides should rate Newsweek Opinion separately as Lean Right; further review is needed. Newsweek's \"The Debate\" section nicely balances opposing views; however, the team noted it is not updated weekly, but rather, a few times per month. Examples of both left and right perspectives on Newsweek's opinion pages at the time of review included:\n\nLean Right:\n\nOppressed New Yorkers Have a Right to Self-Defense\n\nRon DeSantis for President\n\nOur Construction Industry Is Giving Good Jobs to Foreign Workers. It's Got to Stop\n\nBiden and the Media Won't Stop Lying About the Border. Here's the Truth\n\nThe Second 'High-Tech Lynching' of Justice Clarence Thomas\n\nLean Left:\n\nTrump Couldn't Run From His Crimes Forever—MeToo Finally Caught Up With Him\n\nDisappointment Is a Given With the GOP\n\nRepublicans Bash 'Democrat-Run Cities' But do Nothing to Help\n\nNewsweek Rated Center in Feb. 2022 Blind Bias Survey\n\nRespondents across the political spectrum rated Newsweek as Center on average (0.47) in a Feb. 2022 AllSides Blind Bias Survey. This confirmed AllSides' current rating for Newsweek.\n\nDemocrats perceived Newsweek as Lean Right while Republicans perceived Newsweek as Lean Left, on average. Independents viewed the outlet as Center.\n\nOn a scale of -9 to +9, with 0 representing Center, -9 representing farthest Left and +9 representing farthest Right, respondents on average rated Newsweek as 0.47, which is on the right side of center, but still in the Center category. The middle 50% of responses lied between -2.78 (Lean Left) and 4.13 (Right).\n\nWhen normalized, 35% of respondents rated Newsweek as left of center and 50% rated Newsweek as right of center.\n\nOn average, people who self-reported as having a Left or Lean Left bias perceived Newsweek as Lean Right, people in the Center perceived Newsweek as Center, and people on the right (Lean Right, Right) perceived Newsweek as Center, though on the left side of center.\n\nNewsweek Rated Center in 2020 Editorial Reviews\n\nThe AllSides team conducted two separate Editorial Reviews of Newsweek's online publication on Nov. 20, 2020 and on Dec. 17, 2020. Both times, the editorial team determined that Newsweek had a Center bias — a significant departure from our previous rating of Left. Newsweek did not predictably publish perspectives or articles favoring either end of the political spectrum — conservative or liberal. Its Opinion section was particularly balanced, featuring left- and right-wing views.\n\nNews section: Newsweek's news articles did not include many of the common types of media bias, such as spin, subjectivity, or sensationalism.\n\nNewsweek published some articles we didn't typically see in left-wing media outlets, such as articles about apparent hypocrisy on the part of politicians around Covid-19 restrictions: \"Rhode Island Governor Attends Wine and Paint Event After Urging People to Avoid Nonessential Activities\", as well as headlines from people who are skeptical of government-mandated covid measures, such as, \"Alleged Nurse Says She Doesn't Believe in Masks in MAGA Rally Viral Video.\" Our team member pointed out that Newsweek did not give credence to or dismiss the video and perspective, but rather, illustrated facts (the video) without taking a stance. Other articles, meanwhile, focused on the views of left-wing politicians, such as, \"Sanders Says $900 Billion Stimulus Deal is Too Small, Should Be Doubled,\" and \"Tax Hikes For Wealthy May Be Biden's Answer to Foot COVID Bill: Research\". Meanwhile, a piece on the unknown effects of the covid vaccine on pregnancy was something not commonly seen in other outlets, left or right; another article reported on the Navy saying China is the number 1 threat to American maritime dominance; concerns over China's influence is an issue more often highlighted on the right.\n\nWe found Newsweek articles were generally balanced in terms of using full quotes, not partial snippets, and interviewing both sides, though this wasn't always the case. An article we reviewed titled “Democrats Win Court Battle Over Texas Drive-Thru Ballots” quoted the judge and Texas Democrat Party, but did not quote Texas Republicans, and did not indicate the journalist reached out for comment.\n\nStill, some examples of the types of bias could be found. For example, the team noted some sensationalism in imagery, word choice and story choice — and a few articles were lurid in nature.\n\nNewsweek appeared to stay away from common spin words and phrases used widely in media outlets in the aftermath of the 2020 election, such as “voter fraud claims made with no evidence” or “baseless claims.”\n\nThe AllSides team was in unanimous agreement that Newsweek's story choices reflected topics that would be of interest or importance to readers on both the left and the right.\n\nOpinion section: We found much balance in Newsweek's Opinion section, which showcased distinct left-wing and right-wing views, often side-by-side. Newsweek stands out in its willingness to provide a balance of views. It's uncommon to see Center sources cover such a breadth of opinion on both sides. Opinion pieces were clearly labeled distinct from news pieces. We were particularly impressed by Newsweek's \"The Debate\" section, which shows two clearly opposing views on particular issues side by side.\n\nNewsweek opinion pieces usually have a very clear left or right bias, and Newsweek published left and right-wing perspectives relatively equally.\n\nFor example, on Nov. 17, these opinion pieces could all be found on Newsweek's site. Both right-wing and progressive opinion pieces appeared (though they did not necessarily appear in this order):\n\nOregon Tougher on Thanksgiving Families than Antifa Terrorists Biden’s Student Loan Forgiveness Plan is Idiotic and Immoral Kamala Harris' Senate Seat Should Go to Barbara Lee COVID Denial Sunk Trump, But Smarter Right-Wing Populists are Thriving Women of Color Should Be the Ones Remaking U.S. Foreign Policy Justice Alito is Right: Freedom of Speech and Religion Face Real Threat\n\nNewsweek Rated Left in May 2020 Independent Review\n\nAllSides previously rated Newsweek as having a Left bias. AllSides shifted Newsweek's bias from Lean Left to Left following a May 2020 independent review by an AllSides editor.\n\nNewsweek's content heavily employed slant, a type of media bias in which the publication's writers tell only the side of the story or choose to highlight only information or story topics that favor one side; in this case, Newsweek's content favored liberal or left-wing perspectives and policies. Newsweek omited right-wing viewpoints, perspectives, and stories that may be deemed important to those on the right.\n\nNewsweek's media bias showed in articles and opinion pieces that were clearly favorable of left-wing politicians and causes, such as the LGBTQ movement, reparations, and globalism.\n\nTop of Page\n\nCommunity Feedback\n\nFeedback does not determine ratings, but may trigger deeper review.\n\nAs of August 2024, people have voted on the AllSides Media Bias Rating for Newsweek. On average, those who disagree with our rating think this source has a Lean Left bias.\n\nConfidence Level\n\nConfidence is determined by how many reviews have been applied and consistency of data.\n\nAs of August 2024, AllSides has high confidence in our Center rating for Newsweek. Two or more bias reviews have affirmed this rating or the source is transparent about bias.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nNewsweek is an American weekly news magazine founded in 1933.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"Newsweek was acquired by The Washington Post Company in 1961, under whose ownership it remained until 2010. Between 2008 and 2012, Newsweek experienced financial difficulties, leading to the cessation of print publication and a transition to all-digital format at the end of 2012. The print edition then relaunched in March 2014 under different ownership...In 2013, IBT Media announced it had acquired Newsweek from IAC; the acquisition included the Newsweek brand and its online publication, but did not include The Daily Beast. IBT Media rebranded itself as Newsweek Media Group in 2017 and rebranded back to IBT Media in 2018 after the spin-off. Since then Newsweek has remained an independent publisher.\"\n\nTop of Page\n\nNewsweek Ownership and Funding\n\nFunding and ownership do not influence bias ratings. We rate the bias of content only.\n\nOwner: Privately owned by CEO Dev Pragad and Johnathan Davis\n\nNewsweek has been privately owned by Johnathan Davis and CEO Dev Pragad since 2018. Pragad serves as CEO overseeing all of Newsweek's operations. Davis has no operational role at Newsweek.\n\nThe Washington Post Company owned Newsweek from 1961-2010. In 2010, The Washington Post Company offloaded it for $1 to the billionaire investor Sidney Harman, who also assumed $40 million in liabilities. He merged it with The Daily Beast, the IAC web publication. Newsweek was sold to IBT Media for an undisclosed price. IBT Media is a privately held company, owned by Etienne Uzac and Johnathan Davis. IBT media does not receive outside funding. Newsweek was spun off from IBT Media in September 2018.\n\nIt's Global Editor-in Chief is Nancy Cooper.\n\nUpdated April 22, 2023"
