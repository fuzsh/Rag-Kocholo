Willis Knighton’s score was the 76th best overall among the 600 hospitals listed nationwide.\n\nContinuing on the Louisiana list is Our Lady of The Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge with a score of 85.33%, ranking No. 2 in Louisiana and No. 77 in overall score; Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans, a score of 82.93%, ranking No. 3 in Louisiana and No. 130 overall; St. Tammany Parish Hospital in Covington, a score of 82.82%, ranking No. 4 in Louisiana and No. 133 overall; and Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans, a score of 82.75%, ranking No. 5 in Louisiana and No. 135 overall.\n\nOchsner Medical Center in Kenner scored 79.45%, ranking No. 10 in Louisiana and No. 281 in overall score.
