However, a few weeks into her 2024 bid, it is unclear what her immigration policies would be—and calls are growing for answers. Here's how she should address these concerns with the DNC next week.\n\nWhy it matters: With Harris now the confirmed Democratic candidate, voters are waiting to see how she will differentiate her policies from President Joe Biden, including immigration. She has been questioned over her record on border security as vice president under Biden, and in response, she has promised to bring back the failed bipartisan border bill. That legislation would increase funding for ICE detention beds, border patrol agents, and immigration judges, as well as tougher measures, appear to contradict the thrust of her campaign promise in 2019. With the Democratic National Convention next week, such uncertainty has only fueled attacks from her critics on the right.\n\nRead more in-depth coverage:\n\nKamala Harris Hits Back At Trump After 'Border Czar' Immigration Attacks\n\nWhat happens now? Immigration reform advocates told Newsweek that Harris should be bolder, such as by providing more legal pathways to citizenship. The DNC will offer a chance for more concrete policy proposals.\n\nTL/DR: Russia's failure to counter the Ukrainian attack so far has exposed a lack of defensive reserves and its troop numbers on the front line in eastern and southern Ukraine are dwindling due to high casualties.\n\nThe rundown: Some Russian state media outlets have suggested that the Kursk incursion was a \"trap\" for Volodymyr Zelensky in which Vladimir Putin will ultimately prevail, as speculation mounts over Ukraine's objectives and end game for the daring operation. For more insights into the unfolding situation in Kursk.\n\nWhy it matters: Kremlin outlets, like RIA Novosti and Tsargrad, claim Russian forces are regaining control and that Ukrainian troops faced heavy losses. This narrative contrasts with reports of Ukrainian advances, such as capturing Sudzha, and raises questions about Ukraine's strategy and possible overextension. Analysts suggest Putin may use this situation to reinforce domestic support and could push for a broader mobilization. Despite these risks, Ukraine's incursion aims to gain Western support, especially with the upcoming U.S. elections.\n\nRead more in-depth coverage:\n\nRussia Declares Federal Emergency in Belgorod\n\nWhat happens now? Zelensky's top commander, Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Thursday that the military command had been set up in Kursk while the Ukrainian president reiterated Kyiv's claim that it now controlled more than 80 settlements and over 440 square miles.\n\nTL/DR: The shake-up arrives as Harris, 59, continues to lead Trump in the 2024 polls amid suggestions that the 78-year-old Republican is failing to match the enthusiasm and excitement of the Democratic Party's presidential campaign.\n\nThe rundown: Donald Trump has brought in new names to his 2024 campaign team as the former president looks to make up for the ground he is losing to Vice President Kamala Harris. Find out who the new team members are and how they might influence the race.\n\nWhy it matters: Corey Lewandowski, who was previously fired as Trump's 2016 campaign manager after being accused, but not charged, of assaulting a reporter, is one member of Trump's inner circle who has been added to his latest presidential campaign. Others added to the Trump 2024 campaign are Tim Murtaugh, the former communications director on the 2020 campaign, and Alex Pfeiffer, Alex Bruesewitz, and Taylor Budowich, who all worked on the MAGA Inc. super PAC, reported The Washington Post and Politico.\n\nRead more in-depth coverage:\n\nTrump Brings Back 2016 Campaign Manager Known for 'Letting Trump Be Trump'\n\nWhat happens now? A spokesperson for the Trump campaign told Newsweek, \"This campaign is focused on winning, and anyone not focused on electing President Trump and defeating Kamala Harris is doing nothing but hurting every American. Detractors and lobbyists are waging a destructive battle of rumor and innuendo, and they are well known and will be remembered.\"\n\nTL/DR: Naim also asserted that the upcoming U.S. election may influence Netanyahu's calculus.\n\nThe rundown: A senior Hamas official has told Newsweek that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is intentionally blocking a ceasefire deal to end the Gaza Strip war and is instead aiming to expand the conflict across the region. Here's what he said.\n\nWhy it matters: The accusation came after a fresh round of negotiations began Thursday in the Qatari capital of Doha with Hamas noticeably absent from talks. As mediators from Qatar and Egypt deliberated on behalf of the Islamist Palestinian movement, along with delegations from Israel and the U.S., few expected a breakthrough that might alleviate Iran's desire for revenge over the recent killing of Hamas' political chief in Tehran. Basem Naim, a Hamas spokesperson, claimed Netanyahu's rejection of previous ceasefire proposals and his imposition of new conditions have stalled progress. Israeli officials deny altering the framework of the deal and assert that Hamas demanded numerous changes.\n\nRead more in-depth coverage:\n\nIsrael Official Says Iran War 'Inevitable' and US Should Strike Now\n\nWhat happens now?

Newsweek spoke with Kunce in an exclusive Zoom interview on Monday, discussing various issues, including the Supreme Court, abortion rights, and why he thinks it's time for Hawley to lose. Read his full interview here.\n\nWhy it matters: Missouri leans heavily Republican, with Donald Trump winning the state by more than 15 points in 2020. Hawley has raised over $22 million for his reelection campaign, while Kunce has raked in just half that amount. But the Marine veteran says that Missourians are ready for change, describing Hawley as a \"typical country club\" politician and suggesting he's disconnected from voters' needs. As a retired Marine, Kunce also expressed concern that Missouri doesn't have any veterans serving in Congress.\n\nRead more in-depth coverage:\n\nLucas Kunce Chances of Beating Josh Hawley in Missouri, According to Polls\n\nWhat happens now? Kunce faces Hawley in November’s election. Kunce said, “I'm the only guy in this race who's going to fundamentally change who has power in this country. We just have to win.” Moreover, Abortion will also be on the Missouri ballot in November, with a proposed constitutional amendment to protect women's rights to have an abortion.\n\nLGBTQ+ Americans are Calling for Help in Record Numbers\n\nLGBTQ+ Americans are requesting support in record numbers, a charity said.\n\nAccording to data provided to Newsweek, Rainbow Railroad, a group that provides services worldwide including travel, financial grants and information support to LBGTQ+ people at risk of discrimination, fielded its highest number of requests for help from LGBTQ+ people living in the U.S in 2023, since it was founded in 2006.\n\nA total of 1,682 people contacted the charity, an increase of more than 500 percent from 2022, when 270 people contacted Rainbow Railroad. In 2020, only 106 people contacted the non-profit and in 2021 the charity received requests for help from 149 people. The 2023 figure means the U.S. was the third-biggest source of requests the charity dealt with that year, up from the eighth in 2022.\n\nThe Full STORY"
