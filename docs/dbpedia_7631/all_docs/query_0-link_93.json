        "text": "This recognition highlights Blackbaud’s commitment to social responsibility\n\nCharleston, S.C. (December 7, 2023) — Blackbaud (NASDAQ: BLKB), the leading provider of software for powering social impact, has ranked 129 out of 1,000 companies in the Newsweek Excellence 1000 2024 Index, which recognizes companies for best practices in business and financial growth while serving customers, stakeholders and communities with a dedication to social responsibility and ethical standards. In addition, Blackbaud has been named to Newsweek’s list of America’s Most Responsible Companies for the third consecutive year. Blackbaud is one of 600 companies on the list, which highlights leaders in corporate responsibility, spanning 14 industries.\n\n“Blackbaud exists to power and support social impact. We are honored to be recognized on the America’s Most Responsible Companies list for the third year in a row, in addition to ranking in the top 130 on the Excellence 1000 Index,” said Margaret “Maggie” Driscoll, chief people and culture officer, Blackbaud. “We’re committed to setting high standards, reporting with transparency on the efforts we are making, and fueling social impact through our products and services. We’re thrilled that these efforts have been recognized by Newsweek.”\n\nOver the past year, Blackbaud has made notable progress against its social impact goals by supporting global philanthropic efforts to further diversity, equity and inclusion, by driving climate solutions to proactively protect the environment, and through investing in governance and data responsibility.

It recognizes companies across over 25 industries and 100 categories and their outstanding dedication to best practices in serving customers and stakeholders, communities, financial growth, and broader societal contributions to social responsibility and sustainability. BPI identified 5,200 companies out of over 25,000 that uphold excellence in best business practices. In their methodology, BPI evaluated financial health, using indicators such as revenue, R&D spending, and website traffic to gauge commitment to growth. Their analysis also included stakeholder satisfaction with customer and employee sentiment. Moreover, they considered the company’s dedication to social responsibility, focusing on aligning with ethical standards and commitments to global sustainability, leading to the top 1000 companies ranked in this issue of the Excellence Index.\n\nAbout America’s Most Responsible Companies\n\nNewsweek partnered with Statista Inc., the world-leading statistics portal and industry ranking provider, to evaluate the top 2,000 U.S. public companies by revenue. Companies were selected based on publicly available key performance indicators (KPIs) derived from corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, sustainability reports and other reports, as well as an independent survey of more than 17,000 U.S. residents. The KPIs focused on company performance in environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) areas, while the independent survey asked citizens about their perception of company activities related to corporate social responsibility.
