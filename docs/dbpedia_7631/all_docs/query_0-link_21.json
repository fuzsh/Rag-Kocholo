        "text": "TriNet first among 1000 US companies recognized for exceeding best practices in financial responsibility, stakeholder ratings, and social responsibility ratings.\n\nDublin, CA â February 20, 2024 â TriNet (NYSE: TNET), a leading provider of comprehensive human resources solutions for small and medium-size businesses (SMBs), has earned the top spot among the 1,000 companies rated in the Newsweek Excellence 1000 Index 2024. The inaugural ranking recognizes businesses across 25 industries that have demonstrated best practices in financial responsibility, stakeholder ratings, and social responsibility ratings.\n\nâAchieving the highest ranking is an incredible honor and reflects TriNetâs dedication to making a positive impact for small and medium-size businesses, the backbone of the U.S. economy,â said TriNet President and CEO, Mike Simonds. âI want to acknowledge and thank our incredible TriNet colleagues for their unwavering commitment to our valued customers and each other. Receiving this recognition from Newsweek underscores our relentless focus on social responsibility, ethical standards, and corporate excellence to empower the success of our valued SMB customers.â\n\n\"Doing good business means more than just turning a profit. In our fast-paced economy, it can be easy to lose sight of the value of companies that strive to be good for customers, employees, and society at large,\" said Nancy Cooper, Global Editor in Chief at Newsweek. \"The Newsweek 1000 Excellence Index takes a 360-degree look at companies, assessing what their employees say about the company, how customers view their products, and how well the business is run in terms of safety, sustainability, diversity, and innovation. Our goal: to provide our readers with an informed view of the firms that are living up to the highest standards.\"\n\nNewsweekâ¯partnered with Best Practice Institute (BPI), a leadership development and benchmark research company, to analyze over half a million data points and develop a proprietary scoring system to measure financial performance, customer and employee satisfaction, environmental commitments, and social responsibility to build the first Excellence 1000 Index. Companies were evaluated based on several criteria including:\n\nEmployee Rating: How employees perceive their employer.\n\nCustomer Rating: How customers view its products, services, and ethics.\n\nESG Risk Rating & Ethical Impact: An analysis of the company's environmental, social, and governance risks, combined with its ethical footprint.\n\nISO Standards Adherence: Compliance with international quality and safety standards.\n\nR&D Spending: Investment in innovation and the future.\n\nGlobal Compact Status: Alignment with the UN's principles on human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption.\n\nBBB Rating & Accreditation (for small companies): Recognizing smaller entities that meet the Better Business Bureau's standards.\n\nNumber of Customer Complaints: A transparent look at customer grievances, shedding light on a corporation's commitment to rectification and improvement.\n\nTriNet received an overall rating of 4.8 out of 5 in Newsweekâs Excellence 1000 Index. This recognition comes as TriNet was also recently named one of Americaâs Greatest Workplaces for Diversity by Newsweek.\n\nTo learn more about TriNetâs environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts, visit www.trinet.com/about-us/esg.\n\nAbout TriNet\n\nTriNet (NYSE: TNET) provides small and medium-size businesses (SMBs) with full-service industry-specific HR solutions, providing both professional employer organization (PEO) and human resources information system (HRIS) services.
