At least one was fired. The other two saw their company email addresses disabled; at least one of those ultimately kept his job. The earlier version also called Johnathan Davis the chief executive of Newsweek Media Group. He is the company’s co-founder and interim chief content officer.\n\nTwo other reporters — Josh Saul and Josh Keefe — saw their company email accounts disabled. Keefe ultimately kept his job. Saul’s status was unclear.\n\nKatz, Saul and Keefe had been writing about an ongoing investigation of the company by the Manhattan district attorney’s office. Their stories said it was a financial fraud investigation that started about a year and a half ago.\n\nIn addition to that investigation, Newsweek placed Chief Content Officer Dayan Candappa on leave in recent weeks after allegations that he repeatedly sexually harassed a woman while he was a top official at Reuters. The company hired a law firm to investigate Candappa’s conduct. The three reporters had written stories about that scandal as well.\n\nRoe and Li were closely involved in the editing of those stories, the source said.\n\nKeefe, a reporter for Newsweek’s sister publication the International Business Times, still has his job — but before his colleagues’ firings became national news, his company email was deactivated and he was scheduled to meet with a human resources representative, another source said. “I have not been fired, although that was very clearly the plan,” Keefe said on Twitter.\n\nA third source said Roe and Li told the Newsweek staff last week that they would protect Katz and Saul, and promised to quit if the reporters were fired. Staffers had specifically asked Roe and Li if Katz and Saul were in danger of losing their jobs because of the coverage.\n\nOn Monday, editors told staffers not to work until the company briefs them on what happened. The staff was then sent home for the day.\n\nAlso on Monday, staffers at the International Business Times were not paid as expected.\n\n“The entire staff is angry, frustrated and confused,” the first source said.\n\nMatthew Cooper, Newsweek’s political editor, resigned in protest. “I’ve never seen more reckless leadership,” he said in a letter to Newsweek Media Group’s chief executive, Dev Pragad, that he posted on Twitter. “The situation has become untenable.”\n\nA memo to staffers Monday said that Nancy Cooper, editor of the International Business Times, is serving as Newsweek’s acting editor and that Davis, the co-founder, has been named Newsweek Media Group’s interim chief content officer pending the outcome of the investigation into the allegations against Candappa.\n\nWhen asked about Monday’s firings, the company said it does not comment on personnel matters.\n\nLast Wednesday, Etienne Uzac and Marion Kim resigned from their roles as chairman and finance director at Newsweek Media Group. Their resignations came less than two weeks after sources told the New York Daily News that the district attorney’s Major Economic Crimes bureau was investigating Uzac.\n\nThe district attorney’s investigators raided the Newsweek offices Jan. 18 and took pictures of the company’s computer equipment in the server room. “They seemed interested in where and when the company got the servers,” a source said at the time.\n\nBrown and Rayman write for the New York Daily News.\n\nUPDATES:\n\n5:55 p.m.: This article was updated with information about reporter Josh Keefe and political editor Matt Cooper and details from a memo to employees."
