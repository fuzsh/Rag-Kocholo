        "text": "Newsweek, the iconic newsmagazine brand, was acquired Saturday by IBT Media, which publishes the news website International Business Times.\n\nNewsweek has long been financially troubled and the venerable magazine published its last print edition in December. It was sold to IAC/InterActive in 2010, which had added it to the Daily Beast news website…\n\nBusinessman Sidney Harman bought Newsweek from the Washington Post in 2010 for $1 and assumed its debt before selling it to IAC.\n\n—USA Today, August 5th\n\nBack when a “brand” was something seared on a steer’s rump with a red-hot iron, Newsweek was what Joe Biden would call a big fuckin’ deal. It certainly was in the late spring of 1966, when I joined it as a cub reporter in San Francisco.\n\nBelieve it or not, Newsweek had a San Francisco bureau—not just a stringer working out of his apartment but a real bureau, a four-man, full-time bureau in a comfortable, well-equipped, town-house-like office suite near the Embarcadero. Bill Flynn, the bureau chief, was a hard-bitten (but, of course, heart-of-gold) bantam rooster of an ex-newspaper man with a gray crewcut. He liked to growl side-of-the-mouth “Front Page”-isms like “Just get the goddam story, goddamit” or, in a tender mood, “Not bad, kid.” Flynn wasn’t one of the Ivy League types favored by “New York,” as we called the home office back East, on Madison Avenue, but he had a credential that neither Osborn Elliot, the magazine’s patrician editor, nor the phalanx of senior editors known as the Flying Wallendas could boast: in 1938, at the San Francisco News, he had been the mentor of another cub reporter, a twenty-one-year-old Vassar girl from Washington, D.C., named Katharine Meyer. Filling out the bureau under Flynn were John Burks, a strapping six-feet-six ironist; Jim Wilson, who operated the telex machine that was our link to New York and who doubled as a staff photographer; and me.\n\nFor six months, until the Selective Service System caught up with me, I had a simply wonderful time. Start with the accommodations. After a few nights in a really nice hotel (the St. Francis, on Union Square, at company expense) and a few weeks in a grubby, furnished room in Chinatown, I landed a dream sublet halfway up Telegraph Hill—big windows, top-floor patio, view of the Golden Gate Bridge on one side and the Bay Bridge on the other. Plus, it came with the loan of a car, a ’59 Pontiac as big and unwieldy as a barge on wheels.\n\nHow great was the job? Ridiculously great.\n\nIn the summer and fall of 1966, a lot was going on in California, politically and otherwise. The incumbent governor, Pat Brown, the father of the present Governor Brown, was running for a third term. Pat Brown was a man of the people, a jovial parish-priest type—the polar opposite of the Zen shape-shifter that his son Jerry would turn out to be. Pat Brown’s once formidable popularity was melting in the flames of the sixties, including the student uprising at U.C. Berkeley and the riots in the Watts section of Los Angeles and the Fillmore district of San Francisco. Brown’s opponent, making his first run for public office, was the B-list actor and TV host Ronald Reagan, whose infomercial for Barry Goldwater had made a splash two years before. I was assigned to spend a few days following the challenger around the Bay Area, trolling for “color.” (That of his hair, for example. It was, I cabled New York, “prematurely orange.”) My conclusion, which in retrospect was not especially prescient, was that while Reagan was affable enough in a country-club sort of way, he lacked the common touch.\n\nFor me, the high point of the gubernatorial campaign was a benefit for Brown in a San Francisco sports arena, headlined by Frank Sinatra and a contingent of Rat Packers—Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Joey Bishop. No Peter Lawford, though. Lawford had been expelled when his late brother-in-law, President Kennedy, worried about potential Mob-related embarrassments, distanced himself from the leader of the Pack, who had gone to the trouble of building a helipad for Marine One on the grounds of his Palm Springs estate. It was never used, which was wounding. Even so, in 1966 Sinatra was still a liberal Democrat. He would end up a Republican and a pal of Nancy Reagan’s, but it should not be forgotten that he did his best to nip Ronnie’s political career in the bud. And the music was great. Old, but great.\n\nMusic that was great but not old was happening at the Fillmore Auditorium and the Avalon Ballroom, the Philharmonic and Carnegie Hall of psychedelic rock. I spent most Friday and Saturday nights at the Fillmore, where every patron’s hair was always a centimeter or two longer than it had been the weekend before. The popular local bands—Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Country Joe and the Fish—were still unknown east of the Sierra Nevadas. A couple of them had put out a record, but none had signed with a major label. Signe Toly Anderson, a wholesome, girl-next-door type, had just left the Airplane to start a family, and her replacement was the regal, Finch College-educated Grace Slick, whose old group, the Great Society, quickly withered away without her. The Fillmore’s Bronx-bred impresario, the charismatic, volcanically profane Bill Graham, usually paired a local band with a tasty import from L.A. (e.g., the Byrds), Chicago (e.g., Muddy Waters), or New York (e.g., Warhol’s Velvet Underground). Admission was cheap—three dollars and fifty cents, tops—and there was always a big bushel of free apples in the lobby. There were no seats except for some benches around the perimeter of the dance floor. The light show—liquid projections pulsing with the rhythms of the music—was like nothing anybody had ever seen before.\n\nThe S.F. music scene (I quickly learned that “Frisco” was a no-no) was scarcely known outside the Bay Area, and neither was the larger cultural phenomenon it drew strength from. The word “hippie”—derived from “hipster,” the nineteen-forties bebop sobriquet revived sixty years later in Brooklyn, Portland, and food co-ops in between—had been coined only a few months earlier, by Herb Caen, the Chronicle’s inimitable gossip columnist. (At the time, as often as not, people spelled it “hippy.”) Ralph J. Gleason, the Chron’s jazz critic, was the scene’s Dr. Johnson. (Pushing fifty, he was too old to be its Boswell.) Gleason’s protégé was the pop-music critic for the U.C. Berkeley’s student paper, the Daily Californian, Jann Wenner. But the national press had not taken much notice, if any. So getting something into Newsweek was a coup.\n\nHere’s how it worked. A Newsweek “correspondent”—that is, a reporter, like me—would go out and interview people and observe events. He (always he—it wasn’t until 1970 that the oppressed women of Newsweek rose up and demanded a fair chance to be something more than mail-room girls or “researchers”) would write a “file” summarizing his findings, with lots of color and quotes. The file would be telexed to New York, where it would land on the desk of a “writer,” who, working from the correspondent’s file, clips, other printed sources, and his own knowledge, would draft a story for the magazine. If the story was a “roundup,” files would come in from several correspondents. The final stage was getting it past one or more of the Wallendas, who might or might not tweak, rewrite, or kill it. The story would carry no byline; Newsweek, like Time at the time and The Economist to this day, believed that anonymity confers authority. The only ways to get your name associated with a story were to hope that Oz Elliott would mention your contribution in his “Top of the Week” editor’s note (a rare honor); to get mentioned in the body of the piece (“ ‘Blah blah blah,’ Joe Blow told Newsweek’s Hendrik Hertzberg’ “), or to take a picture that, if used, would cop you a photo credit in six-point type. I bought a Nikon my first week on the job.\n\nNewsweek had dozens of correspondents in bureaus around the country and overseas, some of them quite talented. They—we—would pick up the magazine every week to see if we had managed to get in a phrase or a quote from one of our files, though a whole sentence was too much to hope for. If you’re interested, here’s a concrete example of the distance between input and output: The story about the San Francisco music scene occupied one page of the magazine, around seven hundred and fifty words of text. (Note the photo credit.) My file for it was ten times that long. (It finally saw the light of print in my book “Politics”; if you’re curious, you can find twelve of its seventeen pages on Amazon. Search “Look Inside” for “Fillmore.”)\n\n[#image: /photos/5909526dc14b3c606c103c86]\n\nOne of the rolls of film I sent to New York was labelled “Jefferson Airplane,” and, indeed, a good thirty of the thirty-six exposures were of that soon-to-be-famous psychedelic rock group. The other six were of Moby Grape, a band fronted by the Airpane’s ex-drummer, Skip Spence. The picture captioned “Jefferson Airplane at Fillmore: ‘A big love thing going on’ ” is actually a picture of Moby Grape. But I got my photo credit! (Double-click on the image above to expand.)\n\nI suppose that anonymity and formulaic-ness would have driven me away from Newsweek eventually, but for the time being the job was just too absorbing, not to say fun.\n\nBesides Reagan v. Brown and the Airplane v. the Dead, I was “covering” a seminal primary campaign in a Berkeley-Oakland Congressional district. The four-term Democratic incumbent, Jeffery Cohelan, was a supporter of the Vietnam War. His opponent was Bob Scheer, age thirty, a dashing editor at Ramparts magazine, the slick, lively voice of the fashionable San Francisco left (and the direct ancestor of both Rolling Stone and Mother Jones). The New Left in 1966 was not yet at the halfway point of its journey from pragmatic idealism to the dead end of “pick up the gun” ultra-radicalism. Two years earlier, the slogan of Students for a Democratic Society had been “Part of the Way with L.B.J.”; three years later, S.D.S. would molt into the Weathermen. Scheer’s campaign was heavier on exuberance than on bitterness, and his forty-five-per-cent showing was better than anyone had expected. The morning after the vote, I took him and his beautiful wife, Anne, for a consolation brunch at the Palm Court. I don’t think the magazine printed more than a sentence or two about the race, but you wouldn’t have known that from my expense account.\n\nThe last file I sent to New York was an account of an event that took place on January 14, 1967, in Golden Gate Park. The idea was to bring together the two mutually suspicious elements of the burgeoning Bay Area counterculture, Haight-Ashbury hippies and Berkeley radicals. The organizers described it this way:> A union of love and activism previously separated by categorical dogma and label mongering will finally occur ecstatically when Berkeley political activists and hip community and San Francisco’s spiritual generation and contingents from the emerging revolutionary generation all over California meet for a Gathering of the Tribes for a Human Be-In.\n\nThe gang was all there: for music, the Dead and all the other bands; on the speakers’ stand, Leary, Alpert, and Ginsberg for the hippies, Jerry Rubin and Dick Gregory for the politicos; keeping order, a contingent of Hell’s Angels, peacefully pre-Altamont; in the audience, twenty or thirty thousand people, mostly young and colorfully dressed. A few—make that a few hundred—were disoriented in a not-good way. On the whole, though, the feeling of the day was sweetly benign. In the unironic lingo of the time and the place, the vibe was mellow.\n\nThe Human Be-In served as the peg for a long (by Newsweek standards) takeout in the February 6, 1967, issue, based largely on reporting that I’d done in the previous couple of months. Its tone was upbeat. The headline was “DROPOUTS WITH A MISSION.” I’d hoped that Oz and the Wallendas would make it the cover story, but no go. Still, it was the first big feature of its kind in a nationally circulated mass publication. The week after it came out, I got a haircut and entered officer training at the U.S. Navy base in Newport, Rhode Island.\n\nNewsweek finally got around to doing a cover story on hippies some nine months later, for the issue of October 30, 1967. By then, I was spending my days in a sleepy Navy office in lower Manhattan, sneaking off in the evenings to do volunteer work at the War Resisters League. In the interim, the Summer of Love had come and gone. “If you’re goin’ / to San Francisco,” went an egregious pop lyric, “be sure to wear / some flowers in your hair.” My surmise was that some of the sons and daughters of some of the editors of my former magazine had turned on, tuned in, and made it their mission to drop out. In any case, the headline on the cover was “TROUBLE IN HIPPIELAND.”\n\nAs for Newsweek, now it’s just a “brand,” drifting, disembodied, somewhere in cyberspace.\n\nTop: Hertzberg in San Francisco, 1966."
