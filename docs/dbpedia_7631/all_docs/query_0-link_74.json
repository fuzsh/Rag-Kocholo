        "text": "Newsweek has recognized CSL as one of America’s Greatest Workplaces for Diversity for 2024. Based on more than 200,000 interviews, the list features the top large and mid-size companies recognized by their employees for genuinely respecting and valuing individuals from different walks of life.\n\n“We have intentionally focused on inclusion - to be a company that amplifies diverse perspectives, fosters crucial conversations and creates a workplace where our people feel a sense of belonging,” said Nidhi Chaudhary, CSL’s Global Head of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion. “While we have more to collectively achieve, this recognition by Newsweek is wonderful confirmation that we are progressing in a positive direction.”\n\nNewsweek partnered with data research firm Plant-A Insights to conduct a study that included interviews with more than 223,000 employees in the United States and over 1.5 million comprehensive company reviews. Respondents provided insights and experiences on corporate culture, working conditions and other aspects of their current employer and other companies they know.\n\nThe analysis was backed by additional research to identify and document more than 21 diversity key performance indicators (KPIs) that reflect the extent to which diversity is embraced in the workplace. These KPIs included metrics such as the diversity ratio within each company's management team, the publication of diversity reports and insights gathered from online platforms and social media reviews.\n\nCSL includes business units CSL Behring, which makes medicines for people who have rare and serious diseases; CSL Seqirus, which develops and manufactures vaccines; and CSL Vifor, a leader in iron deficiency and nephrology (kidney care).\n\n“At CSL, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) is rooted in our values and at the core of who we are,” Chaudhary said. “We are committed to ensuring that DE&I is reflected in our culture and embedded in our business.”"
