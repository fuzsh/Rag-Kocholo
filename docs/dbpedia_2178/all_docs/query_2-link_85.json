        "text": "In the land of la bella figura, Italian women don’t just pay attention to their fashion and accessories. They also take pride in their skincare, beauty, and hair routine – opting for quality products that are clean, versatile, and of course, Made In Italy. Thanks to a winning mix of family formulas, pharmaceutical innovations, and potent natural ingredients, Italian entrepreneurs are leaving a lasting legacy in the beauty and wellness industries.\n\nFrom face oils and sunscreen to hair masks and mascara, there is a product for everyone here; whether you prefer a more natural look or a glam aesthetic. Each product is full of nourishing ingredients that come directly from the Italian soil; cultivated with love, time, and care. Discover our favorite Italian beauty brands and iconic products you’ll want to incorporate into your daily regime.\n\n1. Adesso\n\nThree sisters with a passion for cosmetics and natural treatments created Adesso in 2020 between the cities of Milan and Paris. Adesso, which means “Now” in Italian, is all about hitting pause and indulging in a moment of self-care. The brand features a capsule line of products that cleanse, protect and moisturize, resulting in nourished, bright and healthy skin. We especially love the Rebalancing Micellar Gel, a cleanser, and make-up remover all in one! The formula includes vitamin B5 with an added hint of moisture and delicate citrus.\n\n2. EspressOH\n\nA makeup brand that was inspired by, and created, one caffé at a time, EspressOH was launched by Chiara Cascella in 2018. Influenced by the simplicity of Italian flair, EspressOH’s products focus on the basics found in every woman’s cosmetics bag — from foundation and concealer to mascara and lipstick. The Aroma Lipstick, made with Coffee Arabica seed oil for added hydration, is a fan favorite. It includes 9 fun shades (and an addictive coffee flavor to wake up your lips). All their products are crafted in Italy. Also, if you’re ever in the country, keep your eyes peeled for the brand’s pop-up hybrid coffee and make-up bar.\n\nLooking for more caffeine? Discover 9 gifts for the Italian coffee lover in your life.\n\n3. Giomi\n\nThe story of Giomi began in Sicily in 1934 with Lina, brand founder Giaro Giarratana’s grandmother. Growing up on a farm Lina was surrounded by the fertile soil of the volcanic island. And constantly experimented with nature’s purest ingredients, developing a secret formula for hair products that performed miracles for the family. Made with almond, olive oil, and Vitamin E, the Giomi Hair Oil is suitable for all hair types. The unisex brand is cruelty-free, and 100% paraben and sulfate-free. Giomi skin and hair products are made with ingredients harvested from the family’s olive garden. These products prove that Nonna truly knows best!\n\n4. Licia Florio\n\nLicia Florio is not just a beauty brand, it’s a lifestyle. What began as a Milanese romance between Licia Florio and Francio Ferrari quickly developed into a brand with a modern approach to wellness and beauty. Licia Florio offers nail care products with nontoxic formulas. These include eclectic polish colors and a cuticle oil made with sage, basil, and essential oils. The brand also sells recycled women’s sports and lounge apparel and recently launched CIAOMONDO, a virtual platform for participating in live classes like yoga, pilates, and barre. Beauty, after all, is not just a physical quality, but a mental and spiritual one too.\n\n5. Le Rub\n\nThe world’s coolest sunscreen is being Made In Italy, and you heard it here first. Made with the Mediterranean’s finest natural ingredients, Le Rub is a clean beauty brand that feels absolutely amazing on your skin. Forget the days of sticky sunscreen and whitecast because these luxurious, mineral formulas blend seamlessly into your skin. They’re vegan and reef-friendly, so they’re not only perfect for wearing under makeup, but also great for long days at the beach.\n\nFace and body sunscreens are available in SPF30 and the silky formulas — featuring hyaluronic acid alongside Vitamin D-rich ingredients like grapes and almond oil — are a pleasure to reapply throughout the day. We also love the aftersun products including a repairing face mask and cooling lotion to hydrate your body. The sunset serum, with cucumber extract, tomato skin and other natural ingredients, is such a nourishing treat for your skin and smells amazing. We love the whole line and know you will too.\n\n6. SKIN&CO Roma\n\nWe can’t deny our love affair for fresh pasta tossed with thinly shaved truffles, but we’ve never considered using this delicacy on our hands and faces until SKIN&CO came along. A family-owned business set in the rolling hills of Umbria, this brand has developed a cult following thanks to Nonna’s original “truffle formula.”\n\nA botanical skin and body care brand that creates natural products full of antioxidants, SKIN&CO collaborates with the University of Bologna to unleash the power of the Black Winter Truffle. Their “farm-to-face” philosophy is deeply rooted in each formula, from serums and cleansers to shower gels and masks. A favorite amongst Italian film stars and international celebrities alike. Make sure to add an Umbrian Truffle Hand Cream to your cosmetic bag.\n\n7. Acqua di Parma\n\nA symbol of Italian style and excellence since 1916, Acqua di Parma embodies Italy’s effortless luxury through its fragrances, body, and lifestyle products. All items are produced locally and draw inspiration from iconic Italian destinations — transporting you to a blissful summer vacation each time you catch a whiff. Blu Mediterraneo, our favorite collection, captures the glamour and energy of the Mediterranean Sea. It infuses scents from places like Capri, Sicily, and Amalfi into fragrances and body care full of nostalgia and sweetness.\n\n8. Furtuna Skin\n\nYou may have heard of Furtuna Skin, whose products have been deemed life-changing by Vogue, Marie Claire, and Cosmopolitan. Thanks to the brand’s innovative Soundbath™ method, Furtuna Skin products are completely natural and wildly potent. Essentially, their method relies on a green technology that uses gentle sound waves to extricate bioactives and nutrients from plants.\n\nPopular products, like the Due Alberi Biphase Moisturising Oil, are made with plants harvested on its 800-acre estate in Sicily. Co-founded by Kim Walls and Agatha Relota Lucas, the beauty industry veterans believe in clean beauty and sustainability. The brand is committed to supporting Sicily’s economy and biodiversity through its line of high-performing balms, serums, oils, and essences.\n\n9. Curù\n\nMelodie Padula, an Italian-Canadian inspired by her Sicilian roots and family’s Mediterranean lifestyle, founded Curù after struggling with acne throughout her youth. Curù, which means “sweetheart” in Sicilian dialect, offers all-natural skincare that combines 14 plant ingredients rooted in tradition and supported by modern science. The ingredients are seasonally harvested, cold-pressed and 100% Made in Italy.\n\nMelodie spent countless summers traveling throughout Sicily and was amazed by the the rich abundance of fresh fruits and herbal remedies. After experimenting with various blends, Curù Skin’s first product was born, the After Sun Facial Oil, which focuses on repairing and nourishing the skin while reducing redness, including ingredients like Sicilian prickly pear, apricot and borage. This isn’t a sunscreen, but rather a product to protect and hydrate skin both before and after sun exposure.\n\n10. VeraLab\n\nFounded by Cristina Fogazzi in 2015 in the heart of Milan, VeraLab has quickly gained a cult following for its bold branding and effective products. Cristina, a beauty expert with a passion for skincare, envisioned Veralab as a brand that combines high-quality, scientifically-backed ingredients with a fun and approachable image. The brand’s vibrant packaging and cheeky marketing are as memorable as the results they deliver.\n\nSpecializing in body care, VeraLab offers a range of cellulite-fighting products like the popular “Slim-Me” line, which is designed to smooth and firm the skin. These products are beloved by many for their ability to enhance skin’s texture and appearance, making VeraLab a go-to for anyone looking to embrace their best self with a touch of Italian flair.\n\n11. Santa Maria Novella\n\nSanta Maria Novella is one of the oldest, and most beautiful, pharmacies and cosmetic shops in the world. The pharmacy was founded in 1221 in Florence by Dominican friars, where they produced medications, balms, and elixirs created using medical herbs — such as distilled rose petals, harvested from the monastic gardens.\n\nIt wasn’t until the early 17th century, nearly 400 years later, that the pharmacy officially opened its doors to the public. Fast forward to the present day and you’ll see that with nearly one hundred boutiques located around the world, Santa Maria Novella has withstood the test of time. Today, the pharmacy continues to use many of its original recipes producing perfumes, soaps, and creams infused with essential oils like cinnamon, orange, rosemary, and lavender.\n\n12. Irene Forte Skincare\n\nIrene Forte, glamorous hotel heiress and Wellness Director of Rocco Forte Hotels has always had a passion for holistic beauty. She teamed up with EffegiLab in Trento to create a line of natural skincare for her hotels. With a focus on science and nature, Irene Forte Skincare is a true “Mediterranean Diet for Skin.” The brand uses plants from the hospitality group’s organic Verdura Società Agricola in Sicily. And it features a wide range of products that incorporate ingredients like prickly pear and pistachios that work to soothe, nourish and brighten sensitive skin. This brand is perfect for anyone searching for spa-level products for at-home use.\n\n13. The Face Planner\n\nA new luxury skincare brand born between London and Tuscany, The Face Planner is designed to make your wedding preparation stress-free and flawless. The Ultimate Plan, a 90-day prep, features six products that work together to give you radiant skin in 3 months. You’ll find ingredients like Niacinamide, AHAs & BHAs, and hyaluronic acid alongside plants and cold-pressed oils sourced in Italy. Fennel oil is used to minimize pores and even out perfections, while sunflower seed oil soothes irritated skin and strengthens the skin barrier.\n\nThe Face Planner also has a “brand home” at The Frantoio, a historic olive mill set on 9 acres in Tuscany. This countryside estate sleeps 12 guests and can be rented for retreats featuring private yoga sessions, cooking classes, and facial treatments using The Face Planner’s signature products. The combination of these two luxury experiences promises a truly rejuvenating and relaxing retreat.\n\n14. Tindora\n\nTindora, a botanical skincare brand born in Abruzzo, harnesses the power of saffron to plump, illuminate and cleanse skin. Saffron, a precious spice which is harvested from the Crocus flower, has been for its medicinal and cosmetic properties for millennia. Cleopatra famously used saffron to brighten her face, and the name “Tindora” (“Golden Tint”) is an homage to Egypt’s famous queen. The moisturizing Lift Effect Serum smoothes the face and has a subtle sweet scent similar to Turkish Delight, while the Illuminating Eye Cream adds a light sheen to the eye contour area. This “biotechnological” line uses Abruzzo’s very own Navelli Saffron, an ingredient that has a Protected Denomination of Origin status governing its production, ensuring the highest quality saffron pistils are blended for the formulas.\n\n15. DOOPA\n\nFun, feminine, and fresh, DOOPA is a brand-new beauty and lifestyle brand launched by Giulia Pagnin, who always dreamed of creating her own skincare products. DOOPA’s first line, Iconic, features four products: a gel cleanser that doubles as a face mask, an exfoliating toner, an anti-age serum, and a hydrating face cream. The main active ingredients include China rose, almond oil, Vitamin E, and hyaluronic acid. The line is eco-friendly, made with clean ingredients and recyclable packaging. And the cute pink branding is sure to add a pop of style to your bathroom.\n\n16. MEV Skincare\n\nMEV Skincare is a nourishing, sustainable skincare line developed by Maria Elena Venuto, a pharmacist based in Tuscany. The brand features pretty pink labels adorn glass bottles with golden accents — and the ingredients are clean and suitable for all skin types. MEV has an extensive line that begins with a cleansing milk, face tonic and gommage to moisturizing face masks, serums and creams.\n\nLa Divina, a face mask formulated with hyaluronic acid, macadamia oil, calendula and shea butter, is perfect for revitalizing dull skin (and its delicate smell of vanilla is truly enticing). We also love the multipurpose La Pozione eye contour cream which has red vine phyto-extracts and vitamins to moisturize and relax the skin — it also doubles as an all-over face cream with a re-densifying effect for mature skin."
