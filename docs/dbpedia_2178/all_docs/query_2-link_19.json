A place that now, years from when it all started, we can really call Home, a place that taught us to respect nature and every creature, a place that hardened us, taught us how to survive… But most of all a place where we became siblings.\n\nBodenco was the ancient name of the river Po, a name given to the river by those people inhabiting its shores, who lived thanks to its flow, its fish and its tides. Bodenco is the spirit that lives in that magic place, the spirit that lives in the flow of the waters, that gave a soul to our music, to our dances, to our lives. Bodenco is a river, it’s our music but, most of all, it’s in all of us. BODENCO IS US.”"
