        "text": "This is a really great app, Iâve had this app since I was in high school, Iâve had other social social media apps, but always come back to this one.\n\nI have some ideas when it comes to the AI features. Is it possible to create a life coach AI?\n\nThere is a career coach, but it would be awesome if there was a life coach as well.\n\nAlso, I know that a lot of these AI chats are made using certain programs that probably might not allow the AI to send messages, but if it is possible, could we somehow have it to wear talking with an AI is exactly like talking with another person on WhatsApp?\n\nMeaning that not only will the AI message with you back-and-forth, but every once once in while, you might get a message from the AI.\n\nFor example, say that someone wants to use the life coach AI to help with exercising, and one of the things that they would like is accountability. The AI would be able to message the person, checking in on them to see if they did what they said they were gonna do.\n\nOr, say someone was talking to Liv, and they were going through grief. Liv could send the messages every once in while to check on them and see how theyâre doing and help them through what theyâre going through.\n\nEssentially, it would be like having an actual conversation with someone. It was just a thought that I had. Hope you all are doing well.\n\nI had a pop up from WhatsApp requesting access to all photos. I can't even remember the last time I used the app (it has been over a year) and at the time the pop up was displayed I was browsing in Safari. Since I didn't expect the pop up I mindlessly clicked Allow and then immediately went into settings to revoke all photos access. WhatsApp should not be requesting access to all photos out of the blue.\n\nI'm giving 4 stars because the app worked fine as far as I remember. I wanted to report the issue to WhatsApp but have not found a way to do that so am attempting to let somebody know by writing a review. I'll probably delete the app now though to avoid future occurrences. It makes me suspicious of what it could possibly be doing in the background without my knowledge because I didn't do anything that should result in WhatsApp wanting access to my photos.\n\nThis app is full of fake accounts and scammers. Do not believe ANYONE on a dating app who asks you to move to talking to them on WhatsApp. I nearly had my entire account stolen if I hadnât looked up popular whatsapp scams online first. If you are asked to go to WhatsApp, do not share your photos or your personal info like full name or date of birth or location proper. If things seem fine and then they send an emoji that makes no sense, do not bother opening the message. Immediately uninstall WhatsApp because the emoji will try and crash your WhatsApp and if you force close it without removing it first, it will crash your phone and then the scammer has full access to everything on your phone. I thought everything was fine until this guy sent me a cow emoji on a post about me telling him I hoped he had a good day. When I opened my WhatsApp the entire screen went blurry and I couldnât maneuver the app, so I just went to the home screen without closing it, and then completely removed WhatsApp. I have had far too many people on dating apps try to get me to just use WhatsApp with very suspicious habits. Do yourself a favor, donât do it."
