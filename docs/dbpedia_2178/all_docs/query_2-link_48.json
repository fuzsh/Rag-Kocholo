        "text": "Let’s face it. There are times when even the most committed language learners feel a bit lazy. No matter how motivated you are, you don’t always want to spend your afternoons memorizing verb conjugations. If you’re going through a lazy period in your Italian learning process, we have just the thing for you: a list of the best Italian songs made especially for you by our native Italian teachers, so that you to keep learning vocabulary while having fun.\n\nMina – Il cielo in una stanza, chosen by Flavio\n\n“I first heard this song during a play in Madrid, and I was immediately smitten by its nostalgic tune and heartfelt lyrics. Though I was just a teenager at the time, I was moved by the main metaphor of the song, which likens the rooms of two lovers with an endless sky. It wasn’t until a few years later, when I met my first girlfriend, that the full meaning of the song was revealed to me.\n\nWhile there are countless versions of the song, I find Mina’s rendition to be the most beautiful version to date.”\n\nLanguage focus\n\n“Being a slow ballad, this song is great for focusing on sounds that Italian learners usually struggle with. So…”\n\nListen to the song while reading the lyrics.\n\nQuando sei qui con me\n\nQuesta stanza non ha più pareti\n\nMa alberi\n\nAlberi infiniti\n\nQuando tu sei vicino a me\n\nQuesto soffitto viola\n\nNo, non esiste più\n\nIo vedo il cielo sopra noi\n\nChe restiamo qui, abbandonati\n\nCome se non ci fosse più\n\nNiente, più niente al mondo\n\nSuona un’armonica\n\nMi sembra un organo\n\nChe canta per te e per me\n\nSu nell’immensità del cielo\n\nHow are the highlighted letters pronounced? Do you know any other words that contain these letters/sounds?\n\nFranco Battiato – Centro di gravità permanente, chosen by Sara\n\n“Franco Battiato is one of the most original and eclectic recording artists that Italy has ever seen. He started his career playing progressive rock in the seventies, but then gradually became more minimalistic and conceptual as a songwriter. In his four-decade spanning career, he has dabbled into genres such as chamber music, techno, and a musical style critics call “philosophical pop”.\n\nWhen Juan requested me to choose a single song from Italy, I immediately knew I would choose “Centro di gravità permanente” (Permanent centre of gravity) which is one of those songs that can make you dance and think at the same time.”\n\nLanguage focus\n\n“This is a very complex song, which almost reads like a highly philosophical short story. The good news is that it has a lot of useful vocabulary. Do the following activities to make the most of this beautiful song.“\n\nRead the lyrics while listening to the song.\n\nUna vecchia bretone\n\nCon un cappello e un ombrello di carta di riso e canna di bambù\n\nCapitani coraggiosi\n\nFurbi contrabbandieri macedoni\n\nGesuiti euclidei\n\nVestiti come dei bonzi per entrare a corte degli imperatori\n\nDella dinastia dei Ming\n\nCerco un centro di gravità permanente\n\nChe non mi faccia mai cambiare idea sulle cose sulla gente\n\nAvrei bisogno di\n\nCerco un centro di gravità permanente\n\nChe non mi faccia mai cambiare idea sulle cose sulla gente\n\nOver and over again\n\nPer le strade di Pechino erano giorni di maggio\n\nTra noi si scherzava a raccogliere ortiche\n\nNon sopporto i cori russi\n\nLa musica finto rock la new wave italiana il free jazz punk inglese\n\nNeanche la nera africana\n\nLook up the words you don’t know on Word Reference Can you find more words for each of the categories below?\n\nnomi (nouns) verbi (verbs) aggettivi (adjectives) cappello (hat)\n\nombrello (umbrella)\n\n…\n\ncerco (seek)\n\nbisogno (need)\n\n…\n\nfinto (fake)\n\nnera (black)\n\n…\n\nRita Pavone – Che M’importa Del Mondo, chosen by Anna\n\nRita Pavone – Che M’importa Del Mondo (1963)\n\n“When I was little, I used to spend the night at my grandparents’ house in Sicily every other weekend, something I looked forward to every time not only because of how great a cook my grandmother was, but also because my grandfather had the biggest vinyl collection I’ve seen to this day. Without a doubt, my favourite record of hers was Rita Pavone’s “Non è facile avere 18 anni” (It’s not easy to be 18).\n\nBorn in 1945, Rita Pavone was an Italian singer who became a big sensation in the 1960s. Though her black and white pictures and videos don’t show it, her hair was so strikingly red that people called her “pel di carota” (carrot hair). This is my favourite song of hers.“\n\nLanguage focus\n\n“Rita’s songs were sweet and simple, which makes them a great choice for beginner learners who want to sharpen their listening skills.”\n\nListen to the song and fill in the blanks with the missing words.\n\nChe m’importa del _ _ _ _ _,\n\nquando tu sei vicino a me\n\nChe m’importa del mondo,\n\nquando tu sei _ _ _ _ _ _ a me\n\nio non chiedo più niente al _ _ _ _ _\n\nse mi lascia te.\n\nNon _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _se piango,\n\nè la gioia che sento in me,\n\nnon c’è cosa più _ _ _ _ _ _\n\ndell’amore mio per te.\n\nFà che questo momento,\n\n_ _ _ _ _ mio,\n\nduri tutta la vita,\n\namore, amore.\n\nStringimi _ _ _ _ _,\n\namore, amore,\n\na te.\n\nFranco Simone – Paesaggio, chosen by Marco\n\n“My best friend, Mariana, is from Argentina. Many years ago, she made a mixtape for me with Argentinian music that I had to know. You should have seen her face when I told her that two of the tracks were actually covers of Italian songs. One of them, Franco Simone’s Paesaggio (Landscape), is one of my favourite songs of all time. Soulful and irresistibly romantic, this song became a classic for Mariana and me.\n\nBy the way, we don’t call it Paesaggio (nor Paisaje) at all. We call it: 2am song, because we religiously play in the car after clubbing before going to bed!”\n\nLanguage focus\n\n“One of the things I love the most about Italian singers is that their pronunciation is crystal clear. Even if you’re a beginner learner, you won’t have trouble doing this listening exercise:”\n\nListen to the song and match the halves:\n\nNo,\n\nnon è che questa voltaDi momenti\n\ncome questiNon si può\n\npensare al caldo\n\nE poi\n\nritroveremo amore.\n\nE poi\n\nla logica del mondo\n\nL’incertezza\n\ndi ogni giorno\n\nNei\n\nmomenti in cui sembrava\n\nNascondevamo le valigie\n\n.\n\nNe ricordo\n\ntanti.Tutto sia\n\ndiversoNon ci ha mai\n\ntoccati\n\nNon ci ha\n\nmai schiacciati\n\nLascia\n\nscorrere un momento\n\nSempre per\n\nricominciare\n\nDi dover partire\n\nI hope you’ve enjoyed reading our teachers’ stories and learning tips as much as I’ve enjoyed editing them."
