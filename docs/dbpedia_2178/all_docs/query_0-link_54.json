        "text": "Company relaunch plan continues successfully\n\nTurnover at €1,004 million (+19% vs 2021)\n\nEBITDA at €103 million (+70% vs 2021)\n\nGroup net profit improves\n\nMicaela Le Divelec Lemmi new board appointee\n\nSocial and environmental achievements outlined in the integrated report available at www.benettongroup.com\n\nPonzano Veneto (TV), 16 May 2023. The Benetton Group Board of Directors approved the consolidated financial statements for 2022 and appointed a new board member.\n\nThe financial year ended with revenues that once again exceeded €1 billion, at €1,004 million, up 19% year-on-year despite the particularly complex global environment.\n\nThe positive trend in turnover is mainly linked to the performance of direct sales channels, both stores and e-commerce: the latter generated a value of €119 million (+11% compared to 2021), contributing 12% to total revenues.\n\nWorth noting is the significant improvement in EBITDA, which stands at €103 million (+70% compared to 2021), while the net result for the year (-€81 million) continues its recovery in line with the forecasts defined by the Business Plan.\n\n\"We are very satisfied with our results: 2022 was an important year in which we continued the double-digit growth trend we started in 2021 and which we see continuing in the first months of 2023. The projects undertaken over the past two years, including the vertical integration of the production platforms, the new automated warehouse, the rationalisation of the distribution network - together with a new creative direction and many image and communication projects - are giving us the expected results,\" stated Massimo Renon, CEO of Benetton Group.\n\nSince adherence to the values of social and environmental sustainability is ingrained in Benetton Group's way of doing business, on its website the Group has published an integrated report which illustrates the main results achieved in 2022 in the non-financial sphere.\n\nOn the environmental sustainability front, in June 2022 the Group signed a letter of commitment to join the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a UN-sponsored global programme that sets concrete targets - based on the latest authoritative scientific studies on climate change - for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.\n\nDuring the year, work on energy efficiency at the company's campuses in Ponzano Veneto and Castrette, in the province of Treviso, continued with the gradual installation of low-consumption lighting and the procurement of energy from 100% certified renewable sources.\n\nIn terms of product, the collections have been designed with the utmost attention to the selection of quality, recyclable fibres.\n\nAs far as the supply chain is concerned, in 2022 the Group continued the near-shoring process, with the aim of reducing the distance between production facilities and markets, which allows having even greater control over the supply chain, ensuring compliance with the most stringent standards for the protection of workers' rights and the environment."
