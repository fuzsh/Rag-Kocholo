        "text": "The history of the region is very ancient, the first settlements date back to the fourth millennium BC, as evidenced by the finds found in the archaeological area of ​​Saint-Pierre and San Martin de Corléans. The Aosta Valley was inhabited by the Salassi – a population of Celtic origin – starting from the sixth century BC. and soon became a Roman colony, as early as 25 BC. in fact, the colony of Augusta Praetoria Salassorum, or the city of Aosta, was born. The construction of the Porta Praetoria, the Roman Theater, the Roman Forum and the Augustus Arch dates back to this period. At the fall of the Western Roman Empire, which occurred in 476, the Aosta Valley was placed under Byzantine control, from 553 to 563, then passed to the Lombards, from 568 to 575 and later became part of the kingdom of Burgundy, under the Kingdom of the Franks. It was during the period of the Carolingian Empire that the Via Francigena was built. In the following centuries, the Aosta Valley was a possession of the Kingdom of Burgundy, of the Duchy of Savoy and, since 1800, of the First French Empire, and it is in this period that the Arrondissement d’Aoste was born. At the fall of Napoleon, the region once again became a Savoyard dominion.\n\nThe Aosta Valley is certainly famous for its castles, each town had its own castle and many are still in excellent condition today and have become important tourist attractions, among the most beautiful castles in the Aosta Valley must certainly be remembered the Castle of Fénis, the Castle of Bard, the Castle of Savoy and the Castle of Issogne."
