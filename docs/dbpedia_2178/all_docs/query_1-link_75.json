        "text": "Morgan Keller serves as Director of the Office of International Student Affairs (OISA) and Wesleyan's Principal Designated School Official (PDSO) for international students studying in F-1 visa status. He grew up in Mariposa (Spanish for “butterfly”), a small town in California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains near beautiful Yosemite National Park. He received his Bachelor’s degree from Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon where he studied International Affairs and Communications and spent a semester abroad studying Italian and fine arts in Siena, Italy. His other international experiences include a Peace Corps service in Ecuador and an eight-year career teaching English as a foreign language in Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan (his first five years with the JET Program). After returning from Japan, Morgan attended Middlebury Institute of International Studies (MIIS) in Monterey, California where he completed a Master’s degree in International Education Management.\n\nPrior to coming to Wesleyan, he worked in International Student and Scholar Services (ISSS) offices at UW-Madison in Wisconsin, Clemson University in South Carolina, and UC Santa Cruz in California. Professionally, his passion is holistically supporting and advocating for international students to foster their success as well as creating impactful opportunities for intercultural learning and internationalization within campus and local communities. Morgan has presented at regional and national NAFSA: Association of International Educators conferences and is currently serving as the NAFSA Region XI Regulatory Ombuds for Student Issues, a NAFSA Trainer Corps Member, and a Regional Editor and Copy Editor for the Journal of Comparative and International Higher Education. He is also a member of the 2024-2025 cohort of the NAFSA Executive Internationalization Leadership e-Institute.\n\nUnprofessionally, his passion is playing and watching soccer, or what most of the world logically calls “football.” Morgan’s partner is Japanese and together they are endeavoring to raise their two daughters bilingually and multiculturally. 日本の方や日本語のできる方、ぜひOISAまで私に会いに来てくださいね!\n\nDr. Dari Jigjidsuren was born in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. Growing up, she attended the Russian school in Darkhan where she learned Russian and was first introduced to the English language. Dari received her Bachelor’s in English & Russian and Master’s in Linguistics from the University of the Humanities in Ulaanbaatar. In Mongolia, Dari taught English at the university and worked for international organizations including the Open Society Foundation (Soros Foundation), Save the Children-UK, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), UNICEF, and USAID. In 2004, she was awarded the Fulbright Fellowship to pursue graduate education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she obtained her Master of Social Work, Master of Science in Public Health, and PhD degrees.\n\nUpon graduation, Dari worked at the University of North Carolina as an evaluation specialist focusing on early childhood education research, and then as a research consultant for the women’s nonprofit in Mongolia. Dari also worked as an adjunct professor of social work at Mississippi State University and co-authored a book on the assessment of early childhood environments with her former colleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nHaving lived in J-1 visa status for 12 years, Dari is well familiar with the many challenges faced by international students in the United States. As a social worker, she feels strongly about social justice, diversity, inclusion, and human rights, and is passionate about supporting and advocating for international students. At Wesleyan, Dari is looking forward to implementing programs that meet the needs of international students and promote intercultural exchange.\n\nUnprofessionally, Dari practices meditation and likes international travel. Сайн байна уу? Та Монголоор ярьдаг бол OISA дахь миний өрөөгөөр зочлоорой! Здравствуйте! Если вы говорите по-русски, заходите в OISA познакомиться!\n\nMeet Alex: 2024 ISO Intern\n\nMy languages: English, Italian, Spanish, Nahuatl\n\nInvolvement at Wesleyan: I'm in a club called WesInterpreters which does translation services for and to non-english speakers that migrated to Connecticut. I'm also part of Wesleyan's very own Film Board (totally not a big deal) so if you have movie recs send them my way! I'll also soon be joining the Wes Multilingual Community Tutors through the Beman Middle School program, which is dope. I also work as an Instructional Media Specialist in ITS - so it's also likely that you're going to see me going around classrooms and fixing things. I was also part of Wesleyan's Club Volleyball team for men, but now I just do it for fun. Now, I'm your ISO Intern!\n\nCome ask me about: You can ask me about good films, how to get an on-campus job & study abroad opportunities!\n\nBio: Hello! I'm Alex, your ISO Intern for this term. I'm a rising sophomore here at Wesleyan, and I can't wait to meet y'all! About me, you should know I lived in Mexico City my entire life, and after I graduate, I want to go to Brazil and do something there. I like learning languages in my spare time and I'm taking German/French next semester. I also love this band called LCD Soundsystem. Hit up my line if you need anything. Welcome to Wes!\n\nOne piece of advice: Call your parents, friends, and family often (they miss you), don't commit to any major until you're a sophomore (and if people ask, just make one up) and finally, don't be too harsh on yourself and enjoy the ride. We're all here to help!\n\nMeet Marouan: African Scholars Student Coordinator\n\nLanguages Spoken: French, Arabic, Moroccan Darija, Tamazight, and English\n\nInvolvement at Wesleyan: Instructional Media Specialist in ITS, Tutor at WELLP Beman Middle School, Circulation Office Assistant at Olin Library, Arabic Tutor in the Dean's Peer Tutoring Program, Member of the Outing Club and Wescode, and part of Wesleyan MSA\n\nBio: Hey, everyone! I'm Marouan, a rising sophomore from Morocco. I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Economics, with a minor in Data Analysis. Alongside my academic pursuits, I hold a keen interest in African studies and philosophy. I am also enrolled in the Wesleyan Math and Science Scholars (WesMaSS) program.\n\nAt Wesleyan, I am actively involved in several clubs, including the Outing Club and CodeWes. Additionally, I contribute to the university community as an Instructional Media Specialist; I also hold a position at the Olin Library, where I assist with circulation tasks.\n\nBeyond my commitments on campus, I find great joy in tutoring students at a nearby middle school. When I'm not immersed in my studies or extracurricular activities, you can often find me riding the waves while surfing, enjoying a swim, or exploring nature through hiking adventures."
