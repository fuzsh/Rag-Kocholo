        "text": "Autonomous region of Italy\n\n\"Valle d'Aosta\" and \"Vallée d'Aoste\" redirect here. For the wine region, see Valle d'Aosta DOC.\n\nAutonomous region of Italy\n\nThe Aosta Valley (Italian: Valle d'Aosta [ˈvalle daˈɔsta]; French: Vallée d'Aoste [vale dɔst];[a] Arpitan: Val d'Aoûta)[b] is a mountainous autonomous region[6] in northwestern Italy. It is bordered by Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, France, to the west; by Valais, Switzerland, to the north; and by Piedmont, Italy, to the south and east. The regional capital is Aosta.\n\nCovering an area of 3,263 km2 (1,260 sq mi) and with a population of about 128,000, it is the smallest, least populous, and least densely populated region of Italy. The province of Aosta having been dissolved in 1945, the Aosta Valley region was the first region of Italy to abolish provincial subdivisions,[7] followed by Friuli-Venezia Giulia in 2017 (where they were reestablished later). Provincial administrative functions are provided by the regional government. The region is divided into 74 comuni (French: communes).\n\nThe official languages are Italian and French; Valdôtain, a dialect of Franco-Provençal, is also officially recognized. Italian is spoken as a mother tongue by 77.29% of the population, Valdôtain by 17.91%, and French by 1.25%. In 2009, reportedly 50.53% of the population could speak all three languages.[8]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Aosta Valley is an Alpine valley which, with its tributary valleys, includes the Italian slopes of Mont Blanc, Monte Rosa, Gran Paradiso and the Matterhorn; its highest peak is Mont Blanc (4,810 m or 15,780 ft). This makes it the highest region in Italy, according to the list of Italian regions by highest point.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe valleys, usually above 1,600 m (5,200 ft), annually have a cold continental climate (Dfc). In this climate, the snow season is very long, as long as 8 or 9 months at the highest points. During the summer, mist occurs almost every day. These areas are the wettest in the western Alps. Temperatures in January are low, between −7 and −3 °C (19 and 27 °F), and in July are between 20 and 35 °C (68 and 95 °F).\n\nAreas between 2,000 and 3,500 m (6,600 and 11,500 ft) usually have a tundra climate (ET), where every month has an average temperature below 10 °C (50 °F). This climate may be either a kind of more severe cold oceanic climate, with a low summer average but mild winters, sometimes above −3 °C (27 °F), especially near lakes, or a more severe cold continental climate, with a very low winter average. Temperature averages in Plateau Rosa, at 3,400 m (11,200 ft) high, are −11.6 °C (11.1 °F) in January and 1.4 °C (34.5 °F) in July. It is the coldest place in Italy where the climate is verifiable.[9]\n\nIn the past, above 3,500 m (11,500 ft), all months had an average temperature below freezing, with a perpetual frost climate (EF). In recent years, however, there has been a rise in temperatures. See, as an example, the data for Plateau Rosa.[9]\n\nBlue Lake[10] and the Matterhorn\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly inhabitants of the Aosta Valley were Celts and Ligures, whose language heritage remains in some local placenames. Rome conquered the region from the local Salassi around 25 BC and founded Augusta Prætoria Salassorum (modern-day Aosta) to secure the strategic mountain passes, and they went on to build bridges and roads through the mountains. Thus, the name Valle d'Aosta literally means \"Valley of Augustus\".[11]\n\nIn 1031–1032, Humbert I of Savoy, the founder of the House of Savoy, received the title Count of Aosta from Emperor Conrad II of the Franconian line and built himself a commanding fortification at Bard. Saint Anselm of Canterbury was born in Aosta in 1033 or 1034. The region was divided among strongly fortified castles, and in 1191, Thomas I of Savoy found it necessary to grant to the communes a Charte des franchises (\"Charter of Liberties\") which preserved autonomy—rights that were fiercely defended until 1770, when they were revoked to tie Aosta more closely to Piedmont, but which were again demanded during post-Napoleonic times. In the mid-13th century, Emperor Frederick II made the County of Aosta a duchy (see Duke of Aosta), and its arms charged with a lion rampant were carried in the Savoy arms until the reunification of Italy in 1870.[13]\n\nThe region remained part of Savoy lands, with the exceptions of French occupations from 1539 to 1563, later in 1691, and then between 1704 and 1706. It was also ruled by the First French Empire between 1800 and 1814. During French rule, it was part of Aoste arrondissement in Doire department.[14] As part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, it joined the new Kingdom of Italy in 1861.\n\nFrench forces briefly controlled the area at the end of World War II, but withdrew under British and American pressure.[15] The region gained special autonomous status after the end of World War II; the province of Aosta ceased to exist in 1945.[7]\n\nGovernment and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Politics of Aosta Valley\n\nFor decades, the valley has been dominated by autonomist regional parties such as the Valdostan Union, which represents the interests of the French-speaking population.[16] The last regional election was held in September 2020. On 2 March 2023, Renzo Testolin was elected regional president, supported by a coalition of autonomist and progressive lists.[17]\n\nThe Aosta Valley, being the smallest region of Italy by area, is not divided into provinces. Nevertheless, it is still divided into 74 comunes namely:\n\nISTAT code Municipality Population\n\n(2005) 007001 Allein 243 007002 Antey-Saint-André 602 007003 Aosta / Aoste 34,270 007004 Arnad 1,294 007005 Arvier 848 007006 Avise 312 007007 Ayas 1,296 007008 Aymavilles 1,966 007009 Bard 135 007010 Bionaz 244 007011 Brissogne 962 007012 Brusson 860 007013 Challand-Saint-Anselme 695 007014 Challand-Saint-Victor 589 007015 Chambave 937 007016 Chamois 99 007017 Champdepraz 674 007018 Champorcher 417 007019 Charvensod 2,333 007020 Châtillon 4,846 007021 Cogne 1,470 007022 Courmayeur 2,979 007023 Donnas 2,661 007024 Doues 409 007025 Émarèse 217 007026 Étroubles 472 007027 Fénis 1,653 007028 Fontainemore 412 007029 Gaby 490 007030 Gignod 1,352 007031 Gressan 2,981 007032 Gressoney-La-Trinité 306 007033 Gressoney-Saint-Jean 799 007034 Hône 1,162 007035 Introd 573 007036 Issime 400 007037 Issogne 1,374 007038 Jovençan 709 007039 La Magdeleine 95 007040 La Salle 1,985 007041 La Thuile 766 007042 Lillianes 494 007043 Montjovet 1,795 007044 Morgex 1,938 007045 Nus 2,713 007046 Ollomont 161 007047 Oyace 211 007048 Perloz 467 007049 Pollein 1,441 007050 Pontboset 190 007051 Pontey 742 007052 Pont-Saint-Martin 3,957 007053 Pré-Saint-Didier 968 007054 Quart 3,263 007055 Rhêmes-Notre-Dame 124 007056 Rhêmes-Saint-Georges 200 007057 Roisan 900 007058 Saint-Christophe 3,124 007059 Saint-Denis 361 007060 Saint-Marcel 1,206 007061 Saint-Nicolas 325 007062 Saint-Oyen 218 007063 Saint-Pierre 2,785 007064 Saint-Rhémy-en-Bosses 387 007065 Saint-Vincent 4,833 007066 Sarre 4,434 007067 Torgnon 522 007068 Valgrisenche 184 007069 Valpelline 627 007070 Valsavarenche 178 007071 Valtournenche 2,169 007072 Verrayes 1,305 007073 Verrès 2,623 007074 Villeneuve 1,136 Total 122,868\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical populationYearPop.±%1861 81,884— 1871 81,260−0.8%1881 85,007+4.6%1901 83,529−1.7%1911 80,680−3.4%1921 82,769+2.6%1931 83,479+0.9%1936 83,455−0.0%1951 94,140+12.8%1961 100,959+7.2%1971 109,150+8.1%1981 112,353+2.9%1991 115,938+3.2%2001 119,548+3.1%2011 126,806+6.1%2021123,360−2.7%Source: ISTAT\n\nThe largest resident foreign-born\n\ngroups on 31 December 2019[18] Nationality Population Romania 2,361 Morocco 1,553 Albania 695 China 298 Ukraine 272 Tunisia 261 Dominican Republic 235 France 220 Moldova 179 Algeria 160 Poland 144 United Kingdom 105 Nigeria 102\n\nThe population density of Aosta Valley is by far the lowest of the Italian regions. In 2008, 38.9 inhabitants per km2 were registered in the region, whereas the average national figure was 198.8, though the region has extensive uninhabitable areas of mountain and glacier, with a substantial part of the population living in the central valley.\n\nNegative natural population growth since 1976 has been more than offset by immigration. The region has one of Italy's lowest birth rates, with a rising average age. This, too, is partly compensated by immigration, since most immigrants arriving in the region are younger people working in the tourist industry. Between 1991 and 2001, the population of Aosta Valley grew by 3.1%, which is the highest growth among the Italian regions. With a negative natural population growth, this is due exclusively to positive net migration.[2] Between 2001 and 2011, the population of Aosta Valley grew by a further 7.07%. As of 2006 , the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) estimated that 4,976 foreign-born immigrants live in Aosta Valley, equal to 4.0% of the total regional population.\n\nThe Valdôtain population and their language dialects have been the subject of some sociological research.[19]\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nLanguages\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Aostan French and Valdôtain dialect\n\nThe Aosta Valley was the first government authority to adopt Modern French as the official language in 1536, three years before France itself.[20]\n\nSince 1946, Italian and French are the region's official languages[1] and are used for the regional government's acts and laws, though Italian is much more widely spoken in everyday life, and French is mostly spoken in cultural life. Education is conducted evenly in French and Italian,[1] so that anyone who has gone to school in the Aosta Valley can speak both languages to at least a medium-high level.[21]\n\nLegal decree No.365 of 11 November 1946 (art.2) states that it is mandatory to know both Italian and French to teach in Aosta Valley's schools.[22] According to Aosta Valley's autonomous status (art.39), the same quantity of hours of French and Italian teaching must be held.[23] The decree No.861 of the President of the Republic of 31 October 1975 (art.5) states that it is mandatory to pass a French exam to teach in Aosta Valley for Italian native speakers, as well an Italian exam for French native speakers.[24] Italian law No.196 of 16 May 1978 states the adaptation rules of national educational programmes into French for Aosta Valley, and states as well that all members of the examination boards must be fluent both in Italian and French.[25] Aosta Valley students must pass an extra test in French at the Secondary education final exam, similar to the first test (in Italian).\n\nThe regional language, known as patoué valdotèn or simply patoué (patois valdôtain in French), is a dialectal variety of Franco-Provençal. It is spoken as a native and second language by 68,000 residents, or about 58% of the population according to a sociolinguistic survey carried out by the Fondation Émile Chanoux in 2001.[26]\n\nThe survey found that the Italian language was spoken as a mother tongue by 77.29% of respondents, Franco-Provençal by 17.91%, and French by 1.25%. The residents of the villages of Gressoney-Saint-Jean, Gressoney-La-Trinité and Issime, in the Lys Valley, speak two dialects of Walser German, Titsch and Töitschu, respectively.[21] According to the survey, Walser German was spoken as a mother tongue by 207 people, or 17.78%, in these three villages. Nevertheless, it was known to 56.38% of the population.[27]\n\nCastles and fortresses\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are numerous medieval castles and fortified houses in the Aosta Valley, including Châtel-Argent, Saint-Pierre Castle, Fénis Castle, Issogne Castle, Bard Fort, Ussel Castle, Sarre Castle, Cly Castle, Verrès Castle, and Châtelard Castle.[28] Savoy Castle in Gressoney-Saint-Jean was conceived in the 19th century and completed in 1904.[28] Since 1990, it has also been home to the Savoy Castle Alpine Botanical Garden.\n\nThe Fénis Castle, 13th century\n\nThe Verrès Castle\n\nThe Issogne Castle\n\nThe Bard Fort\n\nThe Savoy Castle\n\nThe Châtel-Argent\n\nCuisine\n\n[edit]\n\nThe cuisine of Aosta Valley is characterized by simplicity and revolves around \"robust\" ingredients such as potatoes, polenta; cheese and meat; and rye bread. Many of the dishes involve Fontina,[30] a cheese with PDO status, made from cow's milk that originates from the valley. It is found in dishes such as the soup à la vâpeuleunèntse[31] (Valpelline Soup). Other cheeses made in the region are Tomme de Gressoney[32] and Seras. Fromadzo (Valdôtain for cheese) has been produced locally since the 15th century and also has PDO status.[33]\n\nRegional specialities, besides Fontina, are Motzetta (dried chamois meat), Vallée d'Aoste Lard d'Arnad[34] (a cured and brined fatback product with PDO designation), Vallée d'Aoste Jambon de Bosses[35] (a kind of ham, likewise with PDO designation), a dark bread made with rye, and honey.\n\nNotable dishes include Carbonnade, similar to the Belgian dish of the same name consisting of salt-cured beef cooked with onions and red wine served with polenta; breaded veal cutlets called costolette; teuteuns,[36] salt-cured cow's udder that is cooked and sliced; and steak à la valdôtaine,[37] a steak with croûtons, ham and melted cheese.\n\nHistoric villages\n\n[edit]\n\nAosta Valley has many small and picturesque villages, three of them have been selected by I Borghi più belli d'Italia (English: The most beautiful Villages of Italy),[38] a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest,[39] that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities.[40]\n\nWine growing\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Valle d'Aosta DOC\n\nNotable wines include two white wines from Morgex (Blanc de Morgex et de La Salle and Chaudelune), a red wine blend from Arvier (Enfer d'Arvier) and one from Gamay.[41]\n\nFrazione\n\n[edit]\n\nLillaz\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nThe prehistoric site near Chenal castle, Montjovet, rich in petroglyphs\n\nA view from refuge Albert Deffeyes, La Thuile\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nItaly portal\n\nEuropean Union portal\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]\n\nCerutti, Augusta Vittoria, Le Pays de la Doire et son peuple, Quart: éditeur Musumeci\n\nColliard, Lin (1976), La culture valdôtaine au cours des siècles, Aoste\n\nHenry, Joseph-Marie (1967), Histoire de la Vallée d'Aoste, Aoste: Imprimerie Marguerettaz\n\nJanin, Bernard (1976), Le Val d'Aoste.
