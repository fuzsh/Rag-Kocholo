        "text": "Cicli Lucchini\n\nCarrying stock of most common parts, with stock from Shimano, Sram, Specialized, Cannondale, Mavic and more, they are also an Andreani suspension centre.\n\nThey'll be able to bleed brakes, service forks, repair wheels and more. With a nudge from your local guide they'll be able to get things done in a teimley manner and get you back onto the trails quick smart. But they will only have what's in stock, so if it's not here, chances are you won't be getting it that week.\n\nAddress - Corso-Avenue btg. Aosta, 49, 11100 Aosta AO, Italy\n\nThe Place\n\nA brilliant facility offering a cafe, bar, restaurant and bike shop all in one. Not only a good place for a post ride beer, it's a Scott associated bike shop with a solid parts selection, plenty of apparel and rental bikes on offer from their pro workshop.\n\nAddress - Corso Lancieri di Aosta, 20, 11100 Aosta AO, Italy\n\nAosta Valley Bike Centre\n\nAt the end of the Rientro run down from Pila, ABC is a friendly, well equipped bike shop that's always ready to lend a hand with what you need, great for some brake pads after that mammoth descent!\n\nAddress - Frazione Borettaz, 11, 11020 Gressan AO, Italy\n\nTour and tasting at a local winery?\n\nThe Aosta Valley is one of the worlds recognised wine regions, with a small but high quality production of aromatic whites and reds, the wine here picks up the characteristics of the high mountain air and varied soil types to deliver wines of great purity. Tanteun e Marietta is a small boutique winery located in the centre of Aosta producing a small amount of locally grown Pinot Noir, Muscat and Pinot Gris, well worth a tour of their historic cellar, which we can arrange.\n\nKnow your cheeses?\n\nWe love cheese! If you do too a private cellar tour and tasting of the Formaggeria Erba Voglio is worth putting on your holiday radar. Ageing and procuring cheeses from around the region, some of which are only available in microscopic amounts. If you need to get your dairy fix, let us know and we can get you the one on one experience.\n\nLike History?\n\nIn 25BC, Augusta Pr√¶toria Salassorum (Aosta) was claimed by Emperor Augustus for the Roman Empire and became a gateway city to the North. The architecture is well preserved and some can be seen for free in the centre of the city, some you can access for a small fee, if you love history or just really miss being at school, this is a pretty cool way to spend some down time when not shredding the trails in the hills above.\n\nWe launched the Aosta Valley Backcountry Tour in 2019 and it's a highlight of the Atlas Ride Co calendar. Beyond the week long Epic Tour we can also arrange custom trips of longer or shorter stays, guiding and MTB Day Trips from Morzine.\n\nIf the timing is right (for operational opening dates and no snow in the mountains) for your tour we can also arrange multi destination trips through Morzine, Chamonix, Finale Ligure and Aosta, just drop us an email and we'll work out an amazing program for you."
