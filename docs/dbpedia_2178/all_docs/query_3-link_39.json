        "text": "A short transfer takes you to Pontboset where two medieval bridges adorn the town. Through chestnut forests and along the Ayas River you descend to the bottom of the valley. The villages of Hône and Bard, towered over by an imposing fort, come into view. In Bard, take the panoramic elevator up to Bard Fortress, originally built in the 10th century. From here you get a magnificent view and it also houses the Museum of the Alps with various exhibits on the local area (entrance included). The town of Bard itself has been voted ‘one of the most beautiful in Italy’ due to its houses with frescoed facades.\n\nAfterward, continue to Donnas. This town is famous for its vineyards and it’s possible to visit a winery whilst here. You reach the town along the most scenic stretch of the original ancient consular Roman road, the Via delle Gallie. After the village, the trail climbs slightly and leads through vineyards to the hamlet of Bousc Daré, from where walk back to Pont Saint-Martin.\n\nAscent/Descent: 363m/794m\n\nA short but fairly steep ascent from the gates of Aosta leads through vineyards and orchards, you can take your time and once at the top, you’re afforded incredible views of Aosta and the surrounding mountains. The walk continues along shady forest trails, past wildflower meadows, and through charming small towns. Castles and palaces can be seen in the distance. In the hamlet of Moulin di Gressan, the eco-museum Maison de Gargantua is worth a visit. Before reaching Aymaville, you should visit the Château de Aymaville, which is along the way. With its medieval and Baroque construction, it is one of the most beautiful and elegant castles in the Aosta Valley. At the end of the walk, a transfer will pick you up and take you to your accommodation in Vetan.\n\nDepending on availability you may be accommodated in Aymavilles. If so, you’ll then have a transfer tomorrow morning to take you to the start of your next walk.\n\nAscent/Descent: 702m/616m\n\nIf you want to enjoy walking in the mountains and experience Italy’s culture, culinary highlights, and excellent wine, but don't want to take on long days of heavy-going ascents and descents then this holiday is ideal for you.\n\nIt’s a tour designed to make the mountains accessible to a wider range of walkers and not only those with extensive alpine hiking experience. Walk through the famed Aosta Valley on the easy to moderate stages of the well-waymarked Cammino Balteo path. The length of the stages gives you enough time to visit the many historical sites along the way, such as Fenis Castle and you have a free day in Aosta mid-way through your holiday.\n\nMost of the time you are at an altitude of 800 to 1,000 m, although on the penultimate walking day, it goes up to around 1,920 m to make the most of the incredible mountain vistas. The stages are between 6 and 13 km long and the daily ascents and descents are manageable with most ascents below 500 m and most descent below 655 m (there are a couple of walks that have more than this, but they could be skipped if needed).\n\nTour Type:\n\nSlower Adventures | Where walking and cycling meet easy-going exploring, our Slower Adventures are the perfect combination. Most days are filled with picturesque journeys with some free time to dive into the destination and experience the people, local food and culture as you go.\n\nActivity:\n\nMulti Centre Walking | With a mix of loop and point-to-point walks stay 2 or 3 nights in one place which offers the chance to slow down and really explore a destination.\n\nThis trip is suitable for:\n\nSolo Travellers, Families with Teens\n\nThe minimum age for this tour is: 10 Years\n\nIdeal if you have an interest in:\n\nFoodie\n\nWine\n\nAlpine Walking\n\nActivity Level & Terrain\n\nThis tour is graded as easy to moderate and has a free day in Aosta mid-way through. The difficulty is determined based on the entire trip, so individual days may be slightly harder or easier than the overall grade. Most of the time you are at an altitude of 800 to 1,000 m, on the penultimate hiking day it goes up to 1,920 m. To get the most from this trip you should be comfortable walking on undulating terrain with frequent ascents and descents. To get the most from this trip you should be comfortable walking on undulating terrain with many ascents and descents.\n\nPart of the trail has the character of mountain and forest paths, where there are short sections that are a bit steeper. Therefore, a certain surefootedness is important. There are no significant technical challenges on this tour.\n\nExperience & Fitness\n\nIt’s a tour designed to make the mountains accessible to a wider range of walkers and not only those with extensive alpine hiking experience. You don’t need to be an experienced hiker, but you should be in good physical condition and sure-footed.\n\nThe stages are between 7 km/4 mi and 13 km/8 mi long and the hiking time is around 3 - 5.5 hours. Due to the mountainous terrain, there are frequent ascents and descents to contend with. Most of the walk is on mountain and forest trails, where there are short sections that are a bit steeper and/or stonier underfoot.\n\nAccommodations\n\nThis holiday includes overnight accommodation in small hotels, guest houses, and B&B’s. We hand-pick the accommodation to ensure you enjoy every minute of your stay. A warm welcome, traditional hospitality, and delicious local food and drink come as standard.\n\nDetails of the accommodation we normally use are detailed below. These are subject to availability, and early booking is recommended.\n\nWe book en suite rooms as standard. If there are no en suite rooms available in an overnight location, we may book a room with shared facilities, but we'll always let you know first if this was the case.\n\nAlternative Accommodation\n\nWe'll always try and accommodate you at the locations detailed in your itinerary. On the odd occasion, due to limited availability, there may be an option to be accommodated at an alternative location. In the unlikely event that we must accommodate you elsewhere, we'll let you know before confirming your booking. In this case, you can change your trip dates, or we can arrange taxi transfers to and from an alternative overnight accommodation (supplement payable).\n\nSingle Rooms & Solo Walkers\n\nThis self-guided trip is available to solo walkers for a supplement and is subject to availability. If you require single rooms within your party, we'd be happy to accommodate you although there is a single room supplement payable.\n\nMeals\n\nBreakfast is included each morning. In Italy this is generally a light continental breakfast. Lunch and dinner aren't included but are available from your hotel or nearby restaurants. Your accommodation may be able to provide a packed lunch on request and this can be booked on arrival. The food in Northern Italy is strongly influenced by its neighbouring countries so as well as wonderful Italian wines and cheeses, you’ll get pastries and bread more similar to those found in France and hearty sausages and stews that are reminiscent of Germany. Traditional specialties include matured Toma di Gressoney cheese melted onto polenta and Jambon de Bosses, a cured ham that has been stored in hay at high altitude for several months before being flavoured with local herbs and spices.\n\nAdditional Nights\n\nYou may want to spend some extra nights along the route, either to rest or for those with plenty of energy to explore some of the other walking opportunities nearby. We recommend extra nights in Aosta, as there is so much to see and do here.\n\nWhen To Go\n\nThe hike can be done from late April to late June and from early September to early November. You can start your walk on any day and date during this period. July and August can get very hot, so we do not recommend travelling on this tour during the summer.\n\nPeak Season Availability\n\nEarly booking is recommended to secure the best accommodation for you throughout the peak spring and autumn months. If you're interested in travelling during these months, then we may require some flexibility regarding your dates and itinerary. We'll do our best to provide a suitable alternative in line with our usual tour. In the instance that our usual accommodation isn’t available, a supplement for alternate accommodation may be payable. We'll always try our best to get you confirmed on the date you wish to travel.\n\nTime of Year\n\nSpring in the Alps is normally sublime, and April, May and June are lovely, with most wildflowers blooming in May. Autumn is a perfect time of year as the landscape is made up of a gold and red pallet, so September and October are unmissable. The winter weather is starting to arrive in late October and November, but this is also the time with the fewest visitors so it’s great for gaining crisp fresh air and peace and quiet on the trails.\n\nWeather and Climate\n\nThere are various websites that provide useful information about the weather and climate of your destination. A good website for climate information specific to towns and countries is: www.weather2travel.com\n\nWe recommend that you check the local weather forecast daily before starting your walk. TV and radio news and corresponding websites are ideal for this purpose. In addition, your accommodation hosts are usually well-informed and will be happy to help you.\n\nGetting to the Start\n\nArrival into Turin: We recommend flying to Turin Airport. There are regular buses to the central rail station, which takes approximately 45 mins. You can catch a train (trenitalia) from here to Pont-Saint-Martin, which takes approximately 1 hour, or a bus with a similar journey time.\n\nArrival into Milan: Milan is served by three airports.\n\nMilan Malpensa (MXP, 45 km from the city centre). The Malpensa Express train from the airport to Milan City Centre (approx.1 hr).\n\nMilan Bergamo Orio al Serio (BGY, 50 km from the city centre). From BGY you can take a bus into central Milan taking around just less than an hour.\n\nMilan Linate (LIN, 7 km from the city centre), this journey is more complex, involving 2 trains and a bus, taking around 3 hours in total.\n\nFrom Milan City Centre there are various bus connections to Pont-Saint-Martin (1hr 40mins), or you can take the train via Turin (2hrs).\n\nGetting from the End\n\nTo Turin: From Morgex take a local bus to Aosta (approx. 1hr) . From Aosta a bus or train goes to Turin City Centre (Torino Porta Susa) (approx 1h 30mins). From here you can take the bus to Turin Airport (40mins).\n\nTo Milan Malpanza: From Morgex take a local bus to Aosta (approx. 1hr) and then the take Flixbus from Aosta direct to Milan Malpanza.\n\nTo Milan Linate: The journey is more complex, involving 2 trains and a bus, taking around 4 hours in total.\n\nTo Milan Bergamo: From Morgex take a local bus to Aosta (approx. 1hr) and then the take Flixbus from Aosta direct to Milano Bergamo.\n\nLuggage Transfer\n\nYour bags will be collected from your accommodation each day and moved onto your overnight accommodation. Except from Pont Saint-Martin, you will take your main luggage with you to Aosta on the train or bus. Don’t worry though this is a straightforward journey, and you can drop your bag off at your centrally located hotel on arrival, ready to spend your free day discovering the town. Please limit your luggage to one bag of up to 20kg per person.\n\nAt Macs Adventure, we work in partnership with many luggage transfer providers who set a limit on how many bags/suitcases they will transfer per person, and also the weight of the bag/suitcase. Your booking includes the transfer of 1 bag per person and the weight of your luggage allowed is specific to the destination you will be travelling to. This is why it’s very important that you read the luggage information specific to your tour before departure. If you don’t stick to these limits, there’s a chance you’ll be charged locally both for extra bags and/or if they're too heavy. This limitation can be a challenge, especially as airlines generally have limits that are higher. However, our luggage providers have reasons for these limits (usually due to the Health and Safety of their employees), which we must respect."
