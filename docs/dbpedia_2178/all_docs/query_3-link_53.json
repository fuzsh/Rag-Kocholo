        "text": "A classic fontina cheese fondue recipe from Valle d'Aosta, a common dish from the mountains stretching all the way to Switzerland and beyond.\n\nThe video is a variation with added truffles.\n\ningredients\n\n400g of fontina cheese\n\n4 egg yolks\n\n1 spoon of flour\n\n1 glass of milk.\n\n→\n\nFind out more about the history and culture of the grolla or friendship cup, but first try this recipe at home.\n\nIf you don't have a friendship cup why not use a fondue set.\n\n→\n\nThe Matterhorn was was defined by the English poet John Ruskin as the most noble rock in Europe.\n\nIn the dialect of the Aosta Valley it is called 'Gran Becca', meaning Great Mountain or Great Horn.\n\n→\n\nTowns which indicate an adjective or person's name are always worth exploring further and who cannot resist passing by 'Bastardo' in Umbria at least once.\n\nAs for Gaby, it is located in the middle of Lys-Valley in a wide and green basin at the foot of two important mountain passes (Colle della Vecchia and Colle Mologna).\n\n→\n\nThe tiny hamlet of Chamois in the Aosta Valley has the honour of being the only comune in Italy which is not accessible by road, and everyone seems to like it that way.\n\nAs a result, Chamois is pollution free, especially from noise.\n\n→\n\nValle D'Aosta is less than 100 km long and is the smallest region in Italy.\n\nIt is also completely surrounded by some of the highest mountains in Europe and there is basically only one way of seeing the valley and that's to use the Autostrada Quincinetto Aosta.\n\n→"
