AD introduced modifications in this network which was transformed by the late Antique urban topography characterised by two towns, the city and the borough, establishing the layout of Aosta as it remains today. The article proposes a re-reading of existing archaeological data informed by recent excavations.\n\nABSTRACTPrevious research on the Neolithic cist graves of the Western Alpine region—also known under the term Chamblandes type graves—mostly focused on sites located in western Switzerland and eastern France.

For the adjacent Aosta Valley (Italy), only a little information is available. Within the framework of our research project, it was possible to identify about 120 stone cist graves from 10 sites in the Aosta Valley. Due to the lack of distinctive grave goods and missing absolute dating, however, their chronological position has been unclear until now. Here we present the first extensive series of radiocarbon dates from Neolithic stone cist graves of the Aosta Valley. We analyzed 31 human bone samples from four sites, and most dates indicate an unexpected early chronological position around the first half of the 5th millennium BCE, in particular, the site of Villeneuve, dating to 4800–4550 cal BCE.

L’ingresso nei gangli dell’amministrazione sabauda all’inizio del Trecento consente loro di apprendere direttamente le modalità di gestione delle castellanie, cellule base dell’organizzazione territoriale di quell’area. Tramite i castellani, gli Challant governano i loro domini ottenendo rendiconti contabili dai loro officiali. La documentazione di questo tipo giunta sino a noi e i testi delle franchigie concesse dai signori alle comunità locali consentono di formulare qualche riflessione a proposito della redditività di una castellania e di valutare la forza della signoria sulla base dei diritti di prelievo esercitati anche grazie al confronto con i dati provenienti dalle fonti sabaude. Dall’analisi emerge che la redditività della signoria degli Challant è quantificab...\n\nABSTRACTPrevious research on the Neolithic cist graves of the Western Alpine region—also known under the term Chamblandes type graves—mostly focused on sites located in western Switzerland and eastern France.

The extension of the area allows to examine the relationship between people and space (local and supra-local level), and how the category of space was influenced by the images that society had of roads (both as a set of routes and as practised elements of the landscape).\n\nIn this study (which will be followed by others) the questions concern the functional uses to which individuals, social groups, powers and institutions subjected roads to describe, organise and modify space (the surrounding landscape) in specific documented situations.\n\nThe study is divided into three parts. In the first, I describe the road network examined. In the second part, I investigate the attestations of locative uses of appellatives and street names: I evaluate the choice of names, their tendency to settle in the agricultural landscape and in people's memory, and how documents have contributed to this sedimentation. I adopt an analytical approach (elsewhere applied to places, the settlement plan and inferences with the circumscriptional and agrarian plan in particular geomorphological contexts) and used the data of a systematic survey on the notarial formulas. Finally, in the third part, I analyse the confinarian use of roads references. I have posed some questions in dialogue with historiography. Some tables explain my considerations.\n\nCommons have existed in the Aosta Valley’s territory for centuries, of which the most distinguishing and still lively are called consorterie.

This article aims to study this peculiar form of commons, as well as the evolution of their legal status, focusing on national and regional legislation. This paper also seeks to analyse a regional draft bill on commons written by a technical group appointed by the regional government. Its principal goal is to provide consorterie with a new legal status in line with the results achieved by scholars, jurisprudence and national legislation. Moreover, the legislative proposal explores the regional legislative competence related thereto by proposing some innovative solutions.\n\nIs it correct to look for a supposedly missing species by focusing research at the type locality?

A species can be declared extinct because for an unusual amount of time it has not been seen again; however, in the frame of the climate change it is likely that a supposedly missing species is a lucky survivor not seen because it was not searched for in the correct environment. We used the strictly endemic Leistuspunctatissimus Breit, 1914 (Coleoptera, Carabidae) as the case study for testing the latter hypothesis vs. the type locality approach. On the basis of past unsuccessful searches in the Dolomites (a mountain range in the eastern Alps, Italy) driven by the type locality approach, a study area was selected where climate change may have exerted environmental constraints on endemic species. Five pitfall traps were used in each of seven sample sites, at an average altitude of 2600 m a.s.l., within a high altitude alpine plateau covered by scarce patchy vegetation. Leistuspunctatissi...\n\nThis article focuses on Francoprovençal (FP) from the perspective of language contact, specifically the reciprocal effects between FP and two dialects of German (Alemannic) spoken in the Aosta region and belonging to the severely... more\n\nThis article focuses on Francoprovençal (FP) from the perspective of language contact, specifically the reciprocal effects between FP and two dialects of German (Alemannic) spoken in the Aosta region and belonging to the severely endangered Walser minority group located in Northwestern Italy. On the basis of lexical evidence we describe a complex dynamics of language contact among communities embedded in one another. We found bidirectional exchanges between FP and one Walser variety, but much less so with the other. As a result, lexical distance revealed a pattern of contact, isolation and asymmetries that contrasts with geographical distance or more general relations of sociolinguistic dominance.\n\nAs part of a research on social representations of languages, bilingualism and bilingual education carried out by the IRRSAE from Aosta Valley, the writer of this article analyses other contexts suggested by speakers in the Aosta Valley.... more\n\nAs part of a research on social representations of languages, bilingualism and bilingual education carried out by the IRRSAE from Aosta Valley, the writer of this article analyses other contexts suggested by speakers in the Aosta Valley. He tries in the first place to define these speach situations where these associations, comparisions or oppositions to other bilingual realities appear. Finally, on the basis of the works by Perelman & Olbrechts-Tyteca, the author situates them according to the role they play in the argumentation.\n\nPrevious research on the Neolithic cist graves of the Western Alpine region—also known under the term Chamblandes type graves—mostly focused on sites located in western Switzerland and eastern France.

This identifies these burials from the Aosta Valley as belonging to the oldest known Neolithic cist graves of the Western Alpine region discovered so far. Altogether, our study provides new evidence allowing the first time to clarify the chronology of these sites and trace the evolution of this burial practice in the Western Alps."
