You have the option to search by Language Pairs – the languages from which and into which you need interpreting (you may enter up to 5 pairs to narrow your search) – or by Language Combination, using AIIC’s A-B-C system (you may enter up to 2 A languages, 2 B languages and 5 C languages to narrow your search). The parameters selected on the Search page will be displayed at the very top of the results screen.\n\nAdditionally, you can search for interpreters by name or by location (either in English or as it is known locally), by membership or freelance/staff status. If you are looking for consultant interpreters – those who provide additional services such as organising interpreting teams – please use the Consultant Interpreters Directory\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you do not see any search results, try:\n\na) using a different browser, like Chrome or Firefox\n\nb) disabling the popup blockers for https://aiic.org"
