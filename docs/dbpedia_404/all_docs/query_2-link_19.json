Now you can bask in the perks that come with being a member of the college’s network.\n\nAs you make your way in the world, and make the change you want to see in the world, you’ll have 53,000 Smithies rooting for you and supporting you along the way. You can count on Smith for access to groundbreaking events and speakers, opportunities to make new memories, and career advice and connections.\n\nWhile being a Smith alum is a joy, it’s also a responsibility. Your experience at Smith rests on the shoulders of alums who came before you and who gave before you, and now it’s your chance to help the next generation have four formative years—and then some.\n\nFind Your Friends\n\nDownload The Network app, Smith’s easy-to-use alum directory, to update your contact information, get in touch with classmates and students, volunteer, and make new connections. You can also volunteer as a mentor and help Smith students get a career head start.\n\nThe Network Frequently Asked Questions\n\nA Smashing Reunion!\n\nJoy was everywhere as more than 2,000 alums gathered on campus over two weekends in May to celebrate each other, the graduating class of seniors, and the experiences they share as Smithies.\n\nExperience the Excitement of Reunion\n\nSip, Sip, Hooray!\n\nPut the kettle on, Smithies—the custom Smith tea blends are now for sale online, in the bookstore, and at the Campus Center Café. Initially debuted during the inauguration festivities of President Sarah Willie-LeBreton, the two blends are sustainably made and packaged, in keeping with Smith’s values.\n\nIf you can’t make it to Northampton, order some online and have a cup of Smith spirit with you wherever you may be.\n\nBuy Now\n\nWelcoming Our Newest Alums\n\nThe great class of 2024 celebrates Senior Soirée. Photos by Shana Sureck.\n\nInvesting in Our Students\n\nIn the fall of 2022, Smith College eliminated loans from undergraduate financial aid packages for students receiving need-based institutional grants and replaced the loan amount with grants from the college.\n\nThis ongoing initiative—to ensure no student is barred from a Smith education because of finances—is something we continue to fundraise for. Join us today in supporting future generations of Smithies.\n\nThe Smith Fund\n\nAs a donor to The Smith Fund, you can open up a world of opportunities and help transform lives. Donations at regular intervals make a big difference. Smith Fund donations never go to the endowment—the funds are spent in the year in which they are received. You are the source of Smith’s power.\n\nHere for Every Voice\n\nSmith College has launched an ambitious initiative to raise $200 million in endowed funds for scholarship aid. With your partnership, Here for Every Voice will open Smith’s gates to the best minds and create opportunities that didn’t exist before. We will educate the next generation of women who will use their voices to lift communities, change policies, disrupt convention and create a more just and equitable world.\n\nOther Opportunities\n\nOffice for the Arts\n\nEndowed Professorships\n\nCareer Development\n\nMeridians\n\nNeilson Library\n\nNotable Numbers\n\n53,000\n\nAlums in 119 countries\n\n128\n\nActive Smith clubs worldwide\n\n1,532\n\nAlum volunteers\n\n$90MM+\n\nSmith’s annual commitment to financial aid\n\n66%\n\nPercentage of students who receive financial aid from Smith\n\n$562,135\n\nTotal gifts of $100 or less in 2022\n\nHonoring Exceptional Alums\n\nThe Smith College Medal is awarded annually to those alums who, in the judgment of the trustees of the college, exemplify the true purpose of a liberal arts education through both their work and their lives.\n\nLearn More or Nominate an Alum\n\nCome Work With Us!\n\nSee the latest job listings in the Alumnae Relations and Development Office."
