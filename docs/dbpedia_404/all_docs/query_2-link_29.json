        "text": "NORTHAMPTON, Mass. (AP) â€” Smith College has named an expert on child development and early education as its new president.\n\nThe trustees at the women's college in Northampton on Monday named Kathleen McCartney, dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, as Smith's 11th president.\n\nChairwoman Elizabeth Mugar Eveillard calls McCartney \"an exceptional leader who understands ... the importance of women's education in a resonant way.\"\n\nMcCartney, an internationally recognized author on childhood development, early education and education policy, says Smith students \"learn to examine arguments closely, test the limit of their judgment, step forward into leadership and exceed their own expectations.\"\n\nAt Harvard, McCartney has helped the education school raise $162 million, including two $10 million gifts in support of programs that have brought the university's schools of business and government into partnership with the education school.\n\nMcCartney, who takes over from Carol Christ, starts July 1, 2013. She will be inaugurated in October."
