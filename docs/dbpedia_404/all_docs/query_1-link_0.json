        "text": "American academic administrator and psychologist\n\nFor other people named Kathleen McCartney, see Kathleen McCartney (disambiguation).\n\nKathleen McCartney (born 1956) is an American academic administrator, who served as the 11th president of Smith College. She took office as Smith's president in June 2013.[1][2] Smith College, located in Northampton, Massachusetts, is a liberal arts college and one of the Seven Sisters colleges.[3] In February 2023, McCartney announced that she planned to retire at end of June 2023.[4][5] She has since left Smith College.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nMcCartney was born in Medford, Massachusetts.\n\nMcCartney received a Bachelor of Science summa cum laude with a major in psychology from Tufts University in 1977. She received a Master of Philosophy in psychology in 1979 and a Doctor of Philosophy in psychology in 1982 from Yale University.[6]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nMcCartney came to Smith from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where she was dean, and the Gerald S. Lesser Professor in Early Childhood Development. During her tenure at Harvard, the school introduced a three-year doctorate in educational leadership in collaboration with the Harvard Business School and Kennedy School of Government.[7] Prior teaching and research experience includes service as a tenured associate professor of psychology and family studies as well as director of the Child Study and Development Center at the University of New Hampshire.[8]\n\nIn her role as President of Smith College, McCartney launched initiatives on college access and affordability, design thinking, and the liberal arts, women in STEM and the capacities women need to succeed and lead. During her tenure, Smith engaged architectural designer Maya Lin to redesign the historic Neilson Library.[9] The building was completed during the COVID-19 pandemic and opened for use by Smith students and faculty in March 2021.[10]\n\nResearch and academic interests\n\n[edit]\n\nMcCartney's research has focused on early experience and development, particularly with respect to child care, early childhood education, and poverty. She has published more than 150 articles and book chapters on those topics and was the principal researcher for Child Care and Child Development, a 20-year study published in 2005 that examined whether early and extensive child care disrupted the mother-child relationship. She co-edited Experience and Development, The Blackwell Handbook of Early Childhood Development, and Best Practices in Developmental Research Methods.[citation needed] In 1983, McCartney and Sandra Scarr published a developmental theory of gene-environment correlation.[11]\n\nMcCartney has written extensively on issues of gender, education and parenting, including essays and letters in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Worth, CNN, The Boston Globe, and HuffPost.\n\nMcCartney is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,[12] the American Educational Research Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American Psychological Society.\n\nAwards and honors\n\n[edit]\n\nA developmental psychologist, McCartney was the recipient in 2009 of the Distinguished Contribution Award from the Society for Research in Child Development. In 2011 The Boston Globe named her one of the 30 most innovative people in Massachusetts. In 2013, she received the Harvard College Women's Professional Achievement Award, which honors an individual who has demonstrated exceptional leadership in her professional field.[13] In March 2015, she was elected to the board of directors of the American Council on Education (ACE).[14] The Boston Business Journal named her one of its 2016 Women of Influence, citing her extensive work on early childhood education.\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSmith College biography\n\nOffice of the President Kathleen McCartney files at Smith College Archives, Smith College Special Collections"
