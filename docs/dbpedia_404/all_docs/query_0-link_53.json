McCartney, a renowned expert on child development and early education, was a coauthor of “Facts, Fantasies and the Future of Child Care in the United States“ in the very first issue of Psychological Science in January 1990.\n\n“I am so proud to be appointed the 11th president of Smith College,” McCartney said in a Smith College press release. “While other colleges boast of naming a first woman president, Smith today announces its fifth. I am humbled to follow a group of remarkable leaders.”\n\nRead more in this New York Times article and watch McCartney discuss her new position."
