Yet, for 1 in 3 of our neighbors facing food insecurity across Massachusetts, these are some of the tough decisions they have to make daily. Thank you to Esha Walia and Boston Globe Media for their recent article highlighting how grocery prices have surged 25% since 2019, forcing twice as many families to seek food assistance compared to pre-pandemic levels and making affording nutritious food more difficult than ever. That‚Äôs why GBFB exists. We are here to help and fuel the charitable food system that is responding to this chronic surge in food assistance need. With our purchasing power, we acquire and distribute healthy free food to our neighbors facing food insecurity through a robust network of 600 community partners. That means for every $1 you donate, 2 meals will be provided to a neighbor in need across the 190 cities and towns we serve. Together, we have the power to put healthy meals on our neighbors' tables and end hunger here.

Starting a nonprofit in Maine can be a rewarding journey, but it requires careful planning and execution. Have you ever wondered how to start a nonprofit in Maine? Before we dive in, if you're looking to start a nonprofit in Maine or currently struggling with your nonprofit's performance, Rooney's nonprofit starter pack is available to guide you through each step of the start-up process, including raising funds to get your nonprofit up and running. Back to the steps to start a nonprofit in Maine: First, choose a unique name for your nonprofit and check with the Maine Secretary of State's office to ensure it's available. Make sure to check if the name is available as a web domain and social media handle as well. Next, build a strong team, including your board of directors, officers, and key staff members. Define their roles and responsibilities to avoid confusion and ensure a smooth operation. Then, appoint a registered agent who is authorized to do business in Maine and has a physical address in the state. This person will receive legal documents and other important communications on behalf of your nonprofit. After that, file Articles of Incorporation with the Maine Secretary of State's office, including basic information about your nonprofit, such as its name, purpose, and structure. You can file online or by mail. Furthermore, obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS and establish bylaws to guide your nonprofit's operations. Bylaws should include information about your organization's structure, leadership, and decision-making processes. Next, hold an initial meeting with your board of directors to elect officers, adopt bylaws, and establish a bank account. This meeting is an opportunity to discuss your nonprofit's mission, goals, and strategies. Then, apply for 501(c)(3) status with the IRS and register for charitable solicitation with the Maine Attorney General's office. This will exempt your nonprofit from federal income tax and allow you to solicit donations from the public. Finally, obtain any necessary licenses and permits, and comply with ongoing reporting and filing requirements. This includes annual reports to the Maine Secretary of State and the IRS. By following these steps, you can establish a successful nonprofit in Maine that makes a lasting difference in your community. Thanks for watching!

SMM is defined as unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery that result in significant short- or long-term consequences to health, including pregnancy-related conditions such as eclampsia and severe cardiovascular complications, and procedures such as hysterectomy. SMM has significant impacts for patients and the health care system at large, including patient health consequences, increased medical costs, and longer hospital stays. Maternity episodes with SMM were almost twice as costly, on average, than episodes without SMM among both commercially and publicly insured patients. Among Massachusetts residents, SMM rates were highest for Black non-Hispanic birthing people, with a rate of SMM 2.5 times higher than White non-Hispanic birthing people as well as the highest rate of postpartum hospitalizations for SMM. As research suggests early intervention in hypertensive disorders may improve outcomes and reduce SMM, the HPC proposes a remote blood pressure monitoring investment program to improve health outcomes.
