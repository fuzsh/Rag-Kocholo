        "text": "There was a recent Youtube video posted by a Smith College alum Jodie Shaw who now works for Smith College as a staff member. This video has been taken off of youtube but is now available on the Jerry Coyne blog (CC rules prevent linking to such blogs).\n\nIn this video, Jodie, who is white, presents a heartfelt message about what she feels is extreme intimidation with regards to race. She asks that Smith College:\n\nStop reducing her personhood to a racial category.\n\nStop telling her what she must think and feel about herself. In her words, Smith College does that a lot.\n\nStop presuming to know she is and what her culture is based upon her skin color.\n\nStop asking her to project stereotypes and assumptions based upon their skin color, which is something they ask her to do incessantly.\n\nStop telling her that young women of color have no power or agency in this world.\n\nStop telling young white women that they have power and privilege over everyone else. Both this narrative and the one above as very disempowering.\n\nStop demanding that she admits to \"white privilege\" and her \"implicit bias\" as a condition of her continued employment.\n\nStop telling her that as a white person, she is \"especially responsible\" for the work of dismantling racism.\n\nStop emboldening students to act abusively towards staff by refusing to hold them accountable for their own egregious behavior.\n\nShe asks for the right to work in an environment free from the ever-present terror that any unverified student allegation of racism has the power to crush her reputation, ruin her livelihood, and endanger her physical safety.\n\nShe also made another important point in this video, which is that staff are mostly white, which is to expected given it is the dominant racial composition of Western Massachusetts. This is unlike that of faculty and students, which can come from all over the USA or World. In addition, she mentions that staff are typically low paid, making a salary of what it costs to attend Smith for a single semester. In other words, almost all of the faculty and most of the students families are much more privileged than most of the staff.\n\nFinally, she mentions that Smith might be in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on many criteria, including race.\n\nI encourage everyone to seek out the video.\n\nI don’t think that is surprising or unusual if you average all the staff, from the cleaning and grounds keepers to those working in finance and admissions.\n\nThis woman went to Smith. She should have gotten a feel for it in the 4 years she was a student. I picked up on the tour that it is a school of SJW who want change everywhere except at Smith. They will tell you how to think and as long as you think like they want you to, you’ll fit right in.\n\nI was completely prepared to be sympathetic to the cafeteria worker, “Jodie” or, “Jackie” as she seems to be identified in the New York Times, because I was always taught to treat workers with respect, even when I thought they were in the wrong. And, there clearly seems to have been some kind of mistaken identity going on with the young woman accuser. But, what was Jackie actually asked to do other than sit down and talk with the young woman? The video reveals her as an extremely sensitive and intelligent person with a long association with Smith. I’m sorry she feels her alma mater is hostile to white people.\n\nI am a non-white person who grew up in a conservative state, in a relatively poor town that was predominantly white, and where only a small fraction went to college. This socioeconomic class makes up most of the staff at colleges throughout the country (Jodi’s background as a Smith alum for her job is likely an exception).\n\nTo say that these people benefit from any significant privilege because they are white is wrong. They are relatively powerless in society, and certainly as staff members within a college. Both students and college leadership have much more power over them.\n\nAs outside observers we do not know if Jodi’s portrayal is accurate or not. We do know that she is a Smith alum who liked the college enough to work for it afterwards. And she’s smart enough to know that doing this would come at a huge personal cost for her. Does this mean that’s she’s right? No. But I don’t see her incentive for trashing the college she went to and works for unless she absolutely felt she needed to.\n\nIn summary, Smith College allowed one of its students to essentially ruin the careers of three people who did exactly what Smith College’s policy told them to do. And rather than expelling this student, it defends her and throws the staff under the bus. And furthermore, it requires staff, but not faculty to attend sensitivity training.\n\nThe person responsible for this disaster is Smith College’s president, Kathleen McCartney.\n\nWhy in the world would someone want to send their child to Smith College, when they too could be destroyed by an unfounded accusation, and know that Smith will not defend them at all.\n\nIn short, no. The NYT article and Jodi Shaw’s rants present a highly twisted version of the facts in this situation. If you are actually interested in this situation, you might want to start by reading the updated FAQ that Smith has made available to the public. You can also dig through the “Letters to the community” listed on President McCartney’s page for specific statements on this (and the covid management situation, if you’re interested).\n\nI am the parent of a current Smith student. While students have varying opinions about the way that this was handled by the school – not all positive, not all negative – they are almost universally disgusted by way this has been handled in the press. The vast majority of students continue to be extremely enthusiastic about the school.\n\nhttps://www.smith.edu/president-kathleen-mccartney/letters-community\n\nI am happy that a member of the Smith community has responded. I followed the link and saw the numerous Letters to the Community, and read some of them. But we should both recognize that we cannot assume what Kathleen McCartney writes is closer to the “truth” than what Jodi Shaw writes.\n\nSo instead, I actually read the 35-page report created by the law firm because they were specifically tasked with finding the truth.\n\nHere is their conclusion (I replaced terms like Caller and Reported Party with names and descriptions, but it is otherwise unchanged, except for the bolding which I discuss below):\n\nThe investigation did not find that the evidence was sufficient to show that Ms. Kanoute was discriminated against with respect to the Incident. The investigation did not find that Jackie Blair engaged in the behaviors complained of by Ms. Kanoute. The investigation determined that the janitor had a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for contacting the Campus Police, and there was insufficient information to conclude that the Caller’s stated reason was a pretext for discrimination on the basis of the Ms. Kanoute’s race or color, in violation of the Policy. Nor did the investigation find evidence that Responding Officer or Dispatcher violated the Policy by discriminating against Ms. Kanoute on the basis of race or color. As indicated above, the Dispatcher was not aware of the race or color of Ms. Kanoute when he dispatched the Responding Officer, and the Responding Officer was unaware of Ms. Kanoute’s race or color until he entered the room, at which time he recognized her as a student. No information reflected that, when in the room, the Responding Officer responded to the Incident based on Ms. Kanoute’s race or color. Accordingly, this report did not determine that the Dining Employee, the janitor, the Dispatcher, or the Responding Officer, violated the Policy in connection with the Incident.\n\nIn summary, nobody was found to have done anything wrong. But by this time, Ms. Kanoute had already written a FaceBook post accusing the college of racism. In her post, she included the name, photo and email address of Jackie Blair (who she incorrectly believed made the call) and another janitor named Mr. Patenaude, who wasn’t even there at the time.\n\nI bolded one section because the finding is different. Whereas for others it said “did not find the evidence was sufficient to show”, for her it said they did not find Jackie did what she was accused of. The difference is due to the fact that Ms. Kanoute changed her story over time about what she said that Jackie did.\n\nFinally, let’s now compare President McCartney’s reaction to Ms. Kanoute’s initial accusation vs. her reaction to the release of the report, quoting directly from her letters to the community.\n\nAfter Ms. Kanoute’s allegation:\n\nI want to assure you that I have reached out to her, offered a meeting and apologized on behalf of the college. Dean of the College Susan Etheredge ’77 and her team have been in contact with the student as well, to offer their support.\n\nAfter the report:\n\nThe report’s findings are important in two respects. First, they provide a foundation for potential reconciliation and healing for those involved. Second, they include recommendations about Smith’s future, a future in which we recommit to ensuring that every member of our community feels welcome and valued.\n\nDid you notice that there was no public apology to the staff? If you find it elsewhere, please point me to it. If you can’t find it, how do you defend that difference in behavior?"
