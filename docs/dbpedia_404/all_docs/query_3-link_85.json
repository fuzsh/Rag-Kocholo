        "text": "Dwayne Smith, Ph.D., interim president of Southern Connecticut State University, is a firm believer in the transformative power of higher education in shaping the trajectory of individuals’ socioeconomic lives. He brings to his presidency more than 40 years of progressive leadership experience in higher education as an administrator and faculty member.\n\nOn June 1, 2023, Dr. Smith became interim president of Southern, a public institution of almost 9,000 students in New Haven, Connecticut. During the first year of his tenure, he emphasized strategic goals for the university that focus on enrollment success; cultivating a community of scholars; justice, equity and excellence; and community engagement.\n\nA record year for grants has been highlighted by two significant awards that underline Dr. Smith’s commitment to community engagement: a $3.2 million National Science Foundation grant to recruit and graduate underrepresented students in the STEM disciplines; and a $3.4 million grant to the SCSU-based Community Alliance for Research and Engagement (CARE), to improve the health of vulnerable populations in New Haven.\n\nAnd, with Southern’s first-ever comprehensive campaign poised to begin, philanthropy is also making impressive progress. The most recent annual Day of Caring realized a record $911,000, also setting new marks for the number of overall donors and student participation. This and other fundraising initiatives have seen the amount of scholarship funds available grow from $1.4 million to $3 million annually.\n\nDr. Smith has continued the transformation of campus, which has seen a new Health and Human Services Building and the Barack H. Obama Magnet University School open in recent years. Early in his presidency, he opened the new home of Southern’s School of Business. The state’s first net-zero facility – reflecting Southern’s commitment to sustainability – the building provides an array of opportunities for community outreach, including programs designed to enhance the development of small and minority-owned businesses.\n\nBefore taking up his new leadership role at Southern, Dr. Smith had served as campus CEO of Housatonic Community College in Bridgeport, Connecticut, since 2020. Prior to Housatonic, he served as interim president of Harris-Stowe State University in St. Louis, Mo., following his successful 13 years as the HBCU institution’s provost.\n\nDr. Smith has received numerous awards and honors for his service to the community, including being recognized as one of the Connecticut NAACP’s 100 Most Influential Blacks in Connecticut in 2021 and 2024. He holds a bachelor’s degree in psychology and a master’s degree in educational administration from Truman State University. He earned a Ph.D. in educational leadership and policy analysis from the University of Missouri."
