        "text": "Thoughts from the community on the selection of Katherine A. Rowe as William & Mary's 28th president:\n\nChancellor Robert Gates '65, former U.S. Defense Secretary\n\n\"Dr. Rowe is a wonderful choice to lead William & Mary. Taylor leaves a strong foundation upon which to build, and I look forward to supporting and working with Katherine as she moves the university forward.\"\n\nRector Todd Stottlemyer '85\n\n\"The Board is thrilled to make this announcement and welcome Katherine Rowe to the William & Mary family. Katherine is a widely respected and recognized leader, teacher, researcher, scholar, innovator and entrepreneur, and she is a passionate and articulate advocate for the importance of the liberal arts and their critical intersections with technology and research.\n\nWe had a difficult mission: to find a leader to whom Taylor Reveley could pass the reins. In Katherine Rowe, we have found the ideal person to lead William & Mary at this point in the university’s history.\"\n\nThomas Watkins III '74, Vice Rector and chair of the Presidential Search Committee\n\n\"At every turn, the committee found that Katherine's experience and expertise mirrored William & Mary's strengths and the direction we heard from the community that William & Mary needs to head in the future. We truly believe she will be a transformational leader for this university.\"\n\nSue Hanna Gerdelman '76, secretary of the Board of Visitors and chair of the For the Bold fundraising campaign\n\n\"When you think 'data science,' you probably don't think 'Shakespearean scholar.' But that's what is so exciting about Dr. Rowe and developments in the digital humanities, which is already a point of pride at William & Mary. Katherine is comfortable in a world of possibilities, where barriers between science and the humanities have fallen away.\"\n\nTaylor Reveley, William & Mary President\n\n\"I look forward to Katherine Rowe's presidency with great enthusiasm and confidence. A proven leader, Dr. Rowe understands American higher education and appreciates the vital role played by historic universities rooted in the liberal arts. She knows as well that we must be intensely entrepreneurial these days, open to new possibilities and willing to change. She has a keen appreciation for the part that alumni, in league with the campus community, play in William & Mary's progress.\n\nAlong with the Tribe writ large, Helen and I warmly welcome Katherine and her husband Bruce to William & Mary. The President's House, with its three resident ghosts, awaits their arrival.\"\n\nU.S. Senator Tim Kaine\n\n\"Congratulations to Katherine Rowe on being elected the 28th president of William & Mary and the first woman president in the school's 325-year history. Given her incredible experience, innovation, passion and leadership, Dr. Rowe is an excellent pick to lead the alma mater of the nation. This is a historic day for the College, and I look forward to seeing W&M continue to excel and move forward under Rowe.\"\n\nU.S. Senator Mark Warner\n\n\"Congratulations to William & Mary's new president, Katherine Rowe! This is a historic day for W&M, and I'm looking forward to President Rowe's leadership.\"\n\nU.S. Representative Stephanie Murphy '00\n\n\"Congratulations to Katherine Rowe on her selection to become the new president of William & Mary — the second-oldest university in the United States. In July, she'll become the first woman to lead W&M in its 325-year history. As a proud alumna, I am excited to see what her new leadership offers.\"\n\nVirginia Governor Ralph Northam\n\n\"William & Mary has been leading the way for higher education in Virginia for 325 years. I look forward to welcoming Dr. Katherine Rowe to the commonwealth, and am confident the university will continue to thrive and contribute to our economy under her leadership.\"\n\nWilliamsburg Mayor Paul Freiling '83\n\n\"On behalf of all residents of the City of Williamsburg, my fellow members of City Council and I extend a hearty welcome and congratulations to Dr. Rowe and her family on her selection as the 28th president of the venerable College of William & Mary. The City and the College have enjoyed more than three centuries of community partnership, each adding to the enrichment of the experiences of the other. We look forward to continuing this tradition under President Rowe's leadership, to building together a stronger community and to forging a future filled with promise. One Tribe. One Family. One Williamsburg!\"\n\nChon Glover, William & Mary Chief Diversity Officer\n\n\"Katherine Rowe is a thoughtful and strategic thinker. She is a highly respected scholar and administrator who has demonstrated a commitment to diversity and inclusive excellence. As the university continues building upon the work to make William & Mary a welcoming place where all faculty, staff and students are valued and respected, Katherine will be a champion in moving us forward.\"\n\nKathleen McCartney, Smith College President\n\n\"Katherine is a change leader with endless energy. Her legacy at Smith will be felt for years to come — new majors, new processes and new programs.\n\nWilliam & Mary will be in great hands under her leadership.\"\n\nSusan Manix '79, W&M Alumni Association President\n\n\"Dr. Rowe promises to be an exciting leader with a deep appreciation for William & Mary's history and commitment to our future. She seems an excellent choice to lead our community of current and future alumni forward, building on the success of the university under President Reveley's leadership over the past decade. I look forward to partnering with her in the future.\"\n\nMichael Foradas '78, William & Mary Foundation Chair\n\n\"With her interests ranging from Shakespeare to data science, Katherine is an excellent choice to lead W&M — a nationally-ranked research university with the heart of a liberal arts institution. I look forward to working with her to ensure W&M's position as one of the best universities in the nation.\"\n\nMichael R. Halleran, William & Mary Provost\n\n\"I am delighted to welcome Katherine Rowe as William & Mary's next president. With her impressive range of experience, she has a profound understanding of the power of a liberal arts education in the contemporary world. Katherine has also demonstrated the vision and collaborative instincts that will make her a most effective leader of our distinctive and wonderful university. This is an exciting day for William & Mary—and for me personally.\"\n\nSuzanne Raitt, chair of the English Department and faculty representative to the Presidential Search Committee\n\n\"Katherine recognizes what William & Mary's COLL Curriculum affirms: that the liberal arts with its key questions, critical thinking and ability to communicate across disciplines puts students at an advantage, whatever fields they enter after graduation. I look forward to working with her.\"\n\nEric Chason, W&M Law School, Presidential Search Committee member and faculty representative to the Board of Visitors\n\n\"Dr. Rowe has the complete package of skills to lead William & Mary as our 28th president. She is an accomplished scholar, teacher and leader. Her leadership style is bold and collaborative. I expect great things from Dr. Rowe and look forward to working with her.\"\n\nLaini Boyd '18, senior class president and student representative to the Presidential Search Committee\n\n\"This is exciting news for William & Mary and its students. Dr. Rowe's commitment to student achievement and her enthusiasm for the liberal arts are evident. I was impressed with the quality of her ideas and her dedication to promoting and sustaining the inclusive environment that our campus needs. I am optimistic that she will continue to build on the success of our university and carry us forward.\"\n\nYohance Whitaker '16, alumni representative to the Presidential Search Committee\n\n\"I'm very excited to welcome President Katherine Rowe to the university. I look forward to partnering with her as she sets the course for our future. I'm particularly excited about her commitment to innovation and diversity.
