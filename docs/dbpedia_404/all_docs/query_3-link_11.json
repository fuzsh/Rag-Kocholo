        "text": "I wrote Black Oxford: The Untold Stories of Oxford University's Black Scholars to uncover the stories of prominent and lesser-known Black students at the University of Oxford. My inspiration behind the book started after I received a comment stating that Black people only drove buses, worked in factories, and did not attend the city's world-famous university. The remark ignited my desire to uncover the untold history of Oxford University's Black scholars. Surprisingly, many colleges were unaware of these scholars' existence, which only fuelled my determination. As an award-winning creative producer and historian, I aim to make history accessible to all. That is why I am thrilled to partner with the Oxford Bus Company to bring you a unique opportunity. We are offering the Black Oxford Untold Stories Guided Bus Tours for the first time. Unlike any other, these tours will allow you to delve into the untold history of Black scholars at Oxford, presented in a format and style that will engage and captivate you. The tours build on my extensive work on amplifying Black scholars, from the achievement of a plaque for Christian Frederick Cole, the university's first black scholar at University College, symposiums and lectures exploring hidden narratives and visual imagery to the unveiling of a photograph of Kofoworola Moore at St Hugh's College. We must recognize the significant contributions of Black people and celebrate their achievements. The Black Oxford Untold Stories Guided Bus Tours are a testament to this, providing a platform for visibility and representation. By engaging with these tours, you're not just learning but contributing to a more inclusive and diverse community. So, come and enjoy the city's sights while enriching your knowledge.

Did you know? Black students face significant disparities in access and completion at the college level. While comprising 14% of the college-age population, they only represent 9% of enrollments. The graduation rate gap is even wider, with just 44% graduating within six years compared to 66% of White students. These statistics are stark, but they highlight the crucial need for action. Thankfully, institutions with strong affirmative action and DEI programs have shown success in narrowing these gaps. Yet, recent policy reversals threaten this progress. We can't stand by and let these gains slip away! Join us at our Black History Month Symposium on Feb 24 to explore: 👉The root causes of these disparities. 👉The effectiveness of proven solutions like affirmative action and DEI. 👉Strategies for advocating for and achieving equitable access and success for all students. We believe Together, we can: 👉Amplify the voices of Black students and communities. 👉Challenge systemic barriers and demand change. 👉Build a future where education empowers ALL, regardless of background. Mark your calendars, register today, and be part of the solution! https://lnkd.in/eGNjPnND See you there. #BlackHistoryMonth #EducationEquity #DEI #Symposium #JoinTheMovement\n\nA profile in courage (with due acknowledgment to JFK and his ghost writer). \"In January 1902, Anna Julia Cooper, one of the most highly educated Black women in the country, was appointed the seventh principal of Northwest D.C.’s famed M Street High School, the first and most prestigious public high school for Black education. Black people from around the country aspired to send their children to M Street, and its roster of teachers and graduates read like a Who’s Who of Washington’s Black educational and cultural elite. Under Cooper’s leadership, M Street students won scholarships and gained admissions to top colleges and universities — including Harvard, Brown, Yale and Dartmouth. But just four years into Cooper’s tenure, days before the start of a new school year, the White director of Washington high schools persuaded the D.C. Board of Education not to reappoint M Street’s acclaimed principal. When Cooper arrived for the first day of school, the janitor barred her from entering the building. Police officers observed from across the street. They were ordered to arrest Cooper if they deemed she was creating a disturbance. With her students watching from the windows, Cooper — always a model of dignity and decorum — exited the school grounds. Cooper’s story, now largely forgotten, was part of a wider movement to control the direction of Black public education in the early 20th century. Then, like now, battles over education — and especially the question of who was permitted to lead elite institutions, training the next generation to excel — were proxies in the larger culture wars. Today, with female and minority leaders of universities facing resistance from people who assume they have not earned the right to hold their positions, Cooper’s story is an illuminating one. What happened to her illustrates not only how the tactics around removing such leaders have persisted for more than a century, but also what was at stake — and still is — in the battles over educational access and leadership.\" How the Black female head of a top D.C. school was ‘punished for leading’ https://lnkd.in/gApuyfPk (Subscription may be required) #courage #integrity #race\n\nEducation matters. People can take your money. People can take your name. But [Sic] they cannot take what you know and your passion for living . Getting the right education is something we can control. My work over the past 4 years at HU SOE has focused on: 1) Black superintendents 2) Black superintendents and their Impact on areas like STEM for historically minoritized students 3) How school boards can lead for equity Miseducation results in perpetuating contemporary ills. To do better, one must gain a different education. This is why I encourage Black students to attend HBCUs at some point in their educational experience, so they can see what they can be and learn looking at their communities from frameworks that accentuate Black assets. In this 3 minute summary, I introduce 3 recent works I produced inspired by the Black Educators' National Advisory Council (BENAC) facilitated at the University of Pittsburgh. You can read some of my work here: https://lnkd.in/di9yA6fH In this moment in history where our rights have been attacked, calls for color blindness have erased DEI initiatives, and leadership is needed, researchers for justice must step their game up and allow research to be our light towards a righteous, more just society. April Warren-Grice #WednesdayWisdom #BlackExcellence\n\nI understand the intent, but do not agree with the charge. Honestly, I think this is a lazy suggestion that fails to acknowledge the complex implications of students engaging in this charge. Students are not political pawns that leaders get to use/dispose of in moments of socio-political turmoil. Further, this charge by the NAACP (un)intentionally places the onus on students (potentially racially minoritized students) to assume responsibility for ill decisions made by political leaders who failed them from the jump. Prospective and current students have enough to deal with. The consequences of anti-DEI legislation happening in across many U.S. States will force students from minoritized backgrounds to assume additional labor with confronting many barriers, forming communities, and beating odds…There’s another solution here and it’s not asking students to address the harms of horrendous policy failures.\n\nWe're excited to share our latest blog post on an important topic: The Impact of Black Studies Programs on University Campuses.

Board of Education: A Pledge for Equality and Knowledge 🌟 Never Forget: The Legacy of Brown v. Board of Education 🌟 As I reflected on the landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling, we are reminded of its profound impact and ongoing relevance. This decision wasn't just about desegregating schools; it was a major step toward ensuring that Black children had the same educational resources and opportunities as their white counterparts. Why We Must Remember: 📚 Educational Equity: The fight for equal education set by Brown v. Board is far from over. Our commitment to this principle must continue as we see many students still deprived of knowing their full history. 🚫 Against Censorship: This is why we cannot ban Black history or books. It is not just Black history; it's American history, integral to understanding our nation's fabric. 🔍 Learning from the Past: We cannot forget the lessons of the past if we aim to make meaningful change for the future. 💬 Honor the Integrationists: To those who faced adversity for a better tomorrow—your sacrifices have not been forgotten. Because of you, progress was made. Because of you, I am, and countless others can aspire to greater heights. As we commemorate this anniversary, let us all pledge to continue educating, understanding, and advocating for a world that truly reflects the ideals of equality and justice portrayed in this historic decision. Check out this insightful interview reflecting on the 70th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education for more personal stories and the lasting impact of this ruling: Watch the Interview 🔗 Let's not forget. Let's educate. Let's improve.\n\nHappy Black History Month! As we reflect on the trailblazers, the movements, and the culture, we also consider the 70th anniversary of Brown vs Board of Education, how far we have come as a nation, and the distance still to travel. In 1954, the historic Brown vs. Board of Education court case deemed school segregation unconstitutional and concluded that segregation in public education created inherently unequal conditions, which violated the 14th Amendment. As we have continued to learn since Brown, equitable access and opportunities are essential for strong learning outcomes, positive well-being, and successful communities. So, what does equity mean to state educational agencies (SEAs) when they’re developing policies that impact districts, schools, and students? By defining the term, SEAs can lessen the ambiguity and ensure more aspects of education are aligning to equity. Find out which SEAs currently have definitions for equity in Designing for Equity: A Nationwide Education Policy Scan: https://lnkd.in/eSSW7WYG #blackhistorymonth"
