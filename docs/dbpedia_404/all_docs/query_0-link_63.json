Smith today is vibrant and innovative. Smith students are bold and creative thinkers. Smith graduates are driven, passionate changemakers. There is a lot to be excited about: the renovation of Neilson Library, Smith's Year on Climate Change initiative, and our Here For Every Voice campaign to raise $75 million in scholarship aid for students."
