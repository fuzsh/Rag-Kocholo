She said figuring out new ways of ensuring that students of every background apply to the renowned college will be among her priorities.\n\nWillie-LeBreton said she is meeting with the president’s team, the Board of Trustees, the faculty, students and alumnae to discuss how each can use their networks to keep Smith moving in a direction “that represents women of promise from every background across the country.”"
