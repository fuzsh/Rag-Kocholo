        "text": "Philander Smith College officials are parting ways with their president of more than eight years, the chairman of the school’s board of trustees said in an email to alumni Thursday evening.\n\nPresident Roderick Smothers, who has led the college since January 2015, agreed with the board that \"it is time to transition and move the college forward under new leadership,” Terry Esper said in the email. The email listed Esper as the college's board chairman and \"interim executive in charge.\"\n\nEsper did not outline the specifics of Smothers’ departure.\n\nBoard members plan to give updates on the search for new leadership in the months ahead, Esper said in the email.\n\nEsper said that progress sometimes means “making the changes necessary to advance the institution’s mission and values.”\n\nSpeaking directly to Philander Smith alumni in the email, Esper wrote, “On behalf of the entire Board of Trustees, I want you to know that we remain committed to our mission to graduate academically accomplished students who are grounded as advocates for social justice and determined to change the world for the better.”\n\nPhilander Smith College was chartered in 1883. Smothers was its 14th president, a message from him on the school’s website stated.\n\nThis story has been updated with Esper's job title. It was originally published at 9:19 p.m."
