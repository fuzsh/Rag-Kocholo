Dr. McCartney, an expert in early childhood education, has degrees from Yale and Tufts, where she is a trustee, and is the Harvard representative on the founding board of edX, an online consortium. Under her leadership, the Harvard education school began a doctoral program in education leadership, a three-year tuition-free program designed in collaboration with the faculty from the Harvard Business School and the Harvard Kennedy School. She will succeed Carol T. Christ, who has led Smith since 2002."
