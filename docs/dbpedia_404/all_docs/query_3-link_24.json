With nearly three decades of experience in higher education, Kinloch has distinguished herself as a passionate educator who has taught and/or served in administrative roles at The Ohio State University, Columbia University’s Teachers College, the University of Houston-Downtown and, most recently, the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nDuring her time as the Renée and Richard Goldman Endowed Dean and Professor of the University of Pittsburgh School of Education, Kinloch strengthened the school’s commitments to equity, justice and innovation by focusing on teaching, research, community engagement, academic programs, student success, faculty development and alumni involvement.\n\nPrior to her tenure at the University of Pittsburgh, Kinloch served as associate chair of the Department of Teaching and Learning in the College of Education and Human Ecology at The Ohio State University. She also served as the college’s chief diversity officer and director and then associate dean for the Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Community Engagement. In those roles, she strengthened curricula, promoted an urban education programmatic focus and encouraged colleagues to think critically about how to increase the enrollment of minoritized students while focusing on equity and justice both in and out of the classroom.\n\nAmong her many professional appointments, Kinloch is the immediate past president of the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), a fellow of the American Educational Research Association (AERA) and the American Council on Education (ACE), an immediate past member of Johnson C.

Kinloch was also recognized as a top 200 education scholar in the nation by RHSU Edu-Scholar and was ranked No. 34 in the 2023 Higher Education Power 100 list of City and State Pennsylvania.\n\nKinloch has authored numerous books on race, place, equity and literacy, including the highly recognized and critically acclaimed Harlem in Our Minds: Place, Race, and the Literacies of Urban Youth (Teachers College Press, 2010), which received the 2012 Book of the Year Award from AERA.
