        "text": "West Virginia native Brad D. Smith was elected to the role of Marshall University President by unanimous decision in October 2021. He officially stepped into the role in January 2022 and his presidential investiture followed nine months later, taking place in September of that year. Since assuming his presidency, Brad has leaned into his corporate experience as a Silicon Valley CEO, driving the university forward to best serve its students’ education and futures. From generating interest among prospective students to preparing current students for the world outside of Marshall, Brad has begun paving new paths for student success by tailoring students’ experiences, extending Metro tuition and encouraging design-thinking training. All of Brad’s work is inspired by his long-held mission to uplift West Virginia’s people and economy. As Marshall’s president, Brad believes in inspiring the future workforce now and providing opportunities for the next generation of leaders.\n\nBrad’s History with Marshall\n\nBrad’s dedication to serving Marshall University was fostered well before his presidency, beginning first with his graduating from the university with his bachelor’s degree in business administration in 1986.\n\nAs a proud son of Marshall, Brad has remained connected to his alma mater through the years by giving his time and financial support. In 2015, he and his wife, Marshall First Lady Alys Smith, donated $10 million dollars to establish a scholarship fund aimed at assisting students residing in underserved communities. With a great belief and understanding in the power of education, the Smiths strive to do their part to assist first-generation college students in their educational pursuits.\n\nLater, Brad and Alys donated an additional $25 million to Marshall’s schools of business – launching the Brad D. Smith Student Incubator.\n\nBrad and Alys were both honored for their devotion to Marshall at the 83rd Alumni Awards Banquet in April 2022. Brad was bestowed with Marshall’s Distinguished Alumnus award, while Alys was the recipient of the Distinguished Service to Marshall University award.\n\nPresidential Investiture\n\nBrad D. Smith was installed as the 38th President of Marshall University at an outdoor ceremony on September 16, 2022. Watch the ceremony below.\n\nAs a self proclaimed “boy from Kenova,” Brad D. Smith has maintained a deep commitment to his home state throughout his lifetime. In recent years, his sole focus has been helping to facilitate economic change in West Virginia by developing, supporting and investing in people. He is passionate about providing educational and entrepreneurial development resources to the Appalachian region, where many communities have been disproportionately affected by technological and economic change.\n\nBefore his role as President, Brad held executive leadership positions with various companies in Silicon Valley and is best known for his tenure at Intuit, where he served as CEO for 11 years before becoming Executive Chairman. Brad ultimately left the corporate world to put more of his time and attention into his philanthropy — both supporting and creating organizations that align with his mission of bolstering his home state and its people. Brad has also held board memberships at a number of esteemed organizations. He currently serves on the Amazon Board of Directors, the Humana Inc Board of Directors and is a Board Advisor for DignifiHealth.\n\nBrad’s Wing 2 Wing Foundation, which he co-founded with his wife and First Lady Alys, provides increased access and support for education, entrepreneurship mentoring and investment, and works to position West Virginia “as a showcase for the nation.” One of the foundation’s signature initiatives is Ascend West Virginia, one of the nation’s premier remote workforce recruitment programs.\n\nAlys Smith is a successful mediator and trial attorney who received her B.S. from The Ohio State University and her J.D. from The University of Akron School of Law. She sits on the board of the New Opportunity School for Women in Kentucky and is also the founder of Better2Mediate, a mediation service offering people a litigation-free solution to conflict resolution.\n\nAs mentioned above, Alys has helped lead positive change in West Virginia through the Wing 2 Wing Foundation and Ascend WV. The Smiths also bestowed a generous gift to West Virginia University in 2020 to create the Brad and Alys Smith Outdoor Economic Development Collaborative (OEDC) which further supports the environmental, educational and economic development of West Virginia.\n\nWith a goal to empower women in Appalachia and beyond, Alys uses her role as First Lady of Marshall to advocate for women’s equality and help them realize their fullest potential. Alys is also founder of the Women Warriors Summit, which aims to empower women to break barriers and have courageous conversations in all aspects of life."
