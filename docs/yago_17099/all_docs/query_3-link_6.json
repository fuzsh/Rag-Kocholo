He has deserted his unit and taken its money with him. On his journey, he gathers around him a socially and politically diverse group of men whose aim is the same as his: Surviving the war.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a satirical comedy about the war - a novelty at the time - the film became an immediate commercial and critical sensation in mid-1960s Hungary and was seen by 2.2 million viewers. By putting a cunning everyman into the center of the plot, not heroical partisans, and satirizing all sides, this new type of war film spoke to many everyday Hungarians.[3]\n\nThe quote Az oroszok már a spájzban vannak! (The Russians are already in the pantry!) immediately entered the spoken Hungarian language and has been used in many variations since then.[3]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nHungarian Film Festival 1966:\n\nMain award for best film (together with Twenty Hours (Húsz óra) by Zoltán Fábry and My Way Home (Így jöttem) by Miklós Jancsó)\n\nBest male actor (Imre Sinkovits)\n\nSpecial Award of the Jury for best director (Márton Keleti)\n\nAwards of the Hungarian Film Critics 1965:[4]\n\nSpecial Award\n\nBest male actor (Imre Sinkovits)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
