        "text": "He learnt directing from Pál Fejös, and László Vajda as an assistant director. In 1937 he made his first film followed by 2 other films in the same year, (A harapós férj, a Viki and Torockói menyasszony). Between 1939 and 1944 he couldn't make films because he was Jewish. After the 2nd WW, he made the first Hungarian film (A tanítónö). First he worked at the firm Orient Film Factory, and in 1948 he moved to the National Film Factory. In 1950 he began to teach in the Academy of Theatre and Film Arts. Between 1949 and 1953 he made the most watched comedies, with Kálmán Latabár."
