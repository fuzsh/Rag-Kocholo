        "text": "The article examines the way three contemporary Hungarian museums–the House of Terror Museum, the Jewish Museum and the Holocaust Memorial and Documentation Center–represent the history of the Holocaust and the history of Jewish/non-Jewish relations. Reflecting different political agendas, each of the three museums offers a different interpretation of how the Holocaust fits into the larger narrative of Hungary’s 20th century history. The article argues that postcommunist public memory has been constructed through debates about these histories. By analyzing the three museums’ displays, narratives and the debates surrounding them, the article argues that Hungarian public discourse has yet to come to terms with the meaning and place of “Jewishness” (and the way it has informed “Hungarianness”) in modern Hungarian history. Despite the centrality of Jews and Jewish-non-Jewish relations to the museums’ narratives, none are able to offer a clear definition of what “Jewishness” means and how it functioned at different times throughout the 20th century.\n\nProverbs are concise formulations of folk wisdom and as such, when seen in masses, they may well express the spirit of their time and place. In Hungarian proverbial lore Jews figure prominently in nineteenth-century proverb collections but fade out of such collections as of the mid-twentieth century. In the nineteenth-century proverb collections Jews are invariably portrayed as faithless, dishonest, greedy, physically weak and unattractive. Largely, this portrayal as well as the dynamics of the earlier presence of Jews versus their later disappearance from Hungarian proverb collections match the shared history of Hungarians and Hungarian Jews since the 1867 Emancipation of the country&#39;s Jews and possibly even earlier, through their growing integration in significant arenas of their host society, up to their persecution and annihilation in the Holocaust, and later their decade long forced merging into the general Hungarian society under communism. This article traces the occurren...\n\nThis essay reviews three recent books from the disciplines of history, art history, and German studies that inject new meaning into age-old questions about why Jewish difference mattered in the creation of modern culture in Central Europe. Each foregrounds the centrality of the dynamic of visibility/invisibility that formed a crucial source of power and control for Jews living among populations that never completely accepted them in Budapest, Vienna, and the cities of Weimar Germany. By highlighting subtle and often unarticulated instances of engagement with Jewish difference that are usually dismissed or relegated to footnotes, these expertly contextualized studies illuminate the invisible circumscribed codes of behavior that shaped Jews' experiences. In doing so, they add a great deal of nuance to our understanding of the history of Jews in modern Central Europe. They show that, while Jewishness was often subtle and ephemeral, the influence of Jews on the culture they created persists.\n\nThis study explores the currents that have shaped the historical narrative of the Hungarian Holocaust. It examines scholarly perspectives about the history, as well as the underpinning myths and memories that encouraged a nation to pursue an alliance with Nazi Germany and sacrifice their Jewish citizens for Christian national interests. This case study demonstrates the way Hungarian populous movements usurped national and Christian ideals and manipulated society's collective memories. It also explores the subsequent forces of national identity that often whitewash society’s responsibility and skew collective remembrances. Additionally, the examination analyzes three films about the Hungarian Holocaust; Mr. Wallenberg (1990), Sunshine (1999), and Fateless (2005) as contemporary representations of collective memory. This study argues that collective memories shaped by Christian Nationalism construct barriers that impede Hungarians from thoroughly confronting the history and meanings of the Hungarian Holocaust. Since the post war period, Hungarians have failed to accept that Christian Nationalism contributed to Hungary’s devastating national history and equally important the Hungarian Holocaust.\n\nIn this interdisciplinary article that draws on the intersections of Hungarian and Jewish Studies within a framework of cultural studies and gender studies, Louise O. Vasvári investigates the socio-political role of beauty pageants in 1920s European and—more specifically—in Hungarian social, political and cultural life. The article is structured as a case study of the life of Böske Simon, who was born into a bourgeois Jewish family in 1909 and who won the first Miss Hungaria competition in 1929, soon followed by the title of Miss Europa. Vasvári aims to place Simon’s role as Hungarian beauty queen in a broader focus by examining from a gender perspective the international development of beauty pageants, of the illustrated press, and of commercial beauty culture in the 1920s. She examines the symbolic space allotted to the concept “Modern Girl,” who in the interwar [re]construction of gender and national identities came to represent both the enticements and the dangers of modernity. ..."
