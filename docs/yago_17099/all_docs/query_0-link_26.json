        "text": "Béla Vilmos Mihalik mihalik.bela@jezsuita.hu Last modified: December 2016\n\nThe suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773, followed by its restoration in 1814, is generally seen as having created a neat bifurcation of the order’s history into pre-suppression and post-restoration eras. But in Hungary, the picture is more complicated, as decades of postwar Communist rule constitute an additional inflection point. As a result, the history of the Society in Hungary can in fact be divided into four distinct periods: (1) that of the “old,” or pre-suppression, Society (1561–1773); (2) that which followed the return of the restored Society and the establishment of the autonomous Hungarian province (1853/1909–50); (3) that of Communist oppression and exile (1950–90); and (4) that of the reunified Hungarian province (since 1990). Each period had a unique historical perspective, which was reflected in the writings of the Jesuits of that time. The result is a rich and evolving historiography, which this essay will explore. But first, it is essential to provide a brief overview of the history of the Society of Jesus in Hungary."
