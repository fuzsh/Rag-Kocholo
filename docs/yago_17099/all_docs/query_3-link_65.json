        "text": "Hungary has a rich cinematic history and has produced many stellar films over the past seven decades. However, many classic films from Hungary aren’t as widely distributed or available online as those from other Eastern European countries such as Czech Republic or Poland. For example, Criterion has done a great job with releasing Czech and Polish films but their Hungarian film release stands at just 1. And this solitary title only came recently in March 2022 with Márta Mészáros’s brilliant Adoption. Thankfully, Kino Lorber has more Hungarian titles on offer and their upcoming release of 6 Miklós Jancsó films is certainly welcome. In addition, a lot of these Kino Lorber Hungarian titles are available online via kanopy.com. In my case, I have two labels in UK to thank for seeing some classic Hungarian films: Artificial Eye’s release of Béla Tarr’s Sátántangó and Second Run. Still, for the most part, it is tough to stream Hungarian films online. There was a brief period of few months in 2020 when Hungary's National Film Institute showcased 40 classic films for free online. I missed seeing these films in 2020 although some of them are still available online on You Tube or Vimeo but without English subtitles. However, the Eastern European Movies website has a selection of these films available to stream with English subtitles for a fee.\n\nThe availability of these films via the Eastern European Movies website still doesn't end up covering all the films tabulated by Hungarian critics as the best films ever. There have been two lists of 12 films each put out called the ‘Budapest Twelve’ outlining essential Hungarian films.\n\nIn the first case, a list was put out in 1968 for top 12 Hungarian films from 1948 - 1968.\n\nFrigyes Bán: Treasured Earth\n\nMiklós Jancsó: The Round-Up\n\nZoltán Fábri: Merry-Go-Round\n\nAndrás Kovács: Cold Days\n\nFélix Máriássy: Budapest Spring\n\nZoltán Fábri: Professor Hannibal\n\nImre Fehér: In Soldier's Uniform\n\nKároly Makk: The House Under the Rocks\n\nFerenc Kósa: Ten Thousand Days\n\nIstván Gaál: Sodrásban\n\nMárton Keleti: The Corporal and the Others\n\nIstván Szabó: Father\n\nThere was a New Budapest Twelve list put in 2000.\n\nMiklós Jancsó: The Round-Up\n\nKároly Makk: Love\n\nZoltán Huszárik: Szindbád\n\nIstván Szőts: People of the Mountains\n\nGéza Radványi: Somewhere in Europe\n\nPéter Gothár: Time Stands Still\n\nIstván Székely: Hyppolit, the Butler\n\nZoltán Fábri: Merry-Go-Round\n\nAndrás Jeles: Little Valentino\n\nIldikó Enyedi: My 20th Century\n\nIstván Szabó: Father\n\nZoltán Fábri: Professor Hannibal\n\nI have only seen half of the above 2000 list so I still have some work to do. Although, one glaring omission from the above list gives me pause. There isn’t a single title by Béla Tarr. By 2000, he had directed 8 films including Sátántangó. Werckmeister Harmonies was released in 2000 so perhaps if that was not seen, then surely 7 of his titles of would have been considered. This omission doesn’t seem like a mistake.\n\nIn András Bálint Kovács' book ‘The Cinema of Béla Tarr’, Kovács references the lack of Tarr’s films in the 2000 list and elaborates:\n\n“But the discrepancy between the appreciation of Tarr’s films on the international and on the national level is striking. And I am not talking about the discrepancy between an elite’s taste and the popular taste. This would be obvious and needs no explanation. What I am talking about about here is a discrepancy within a Hungarian art-film audience, which right from the appearance of the Tarr style in 1988 became divided about its value.” page 172, ‘The Cinema of Béla Tarr’, András Bálint Kovács\n\nThis gap between directors who are popular locally vs internationally isn’t isolated to Hungarian cinema but takes place in many other nations as well, where some directors find much more appreciation internationally as opposed to locally. Some examples such as Carlos Reygadas (Mexico), Apichatpong Weerasethakul (Thailand) and Lav Diaz (Philippines) come to mind while a handful of Indian directors do well at international film festivals yet hardly ever get their films shown locally.\n\nWhile I still have some catching up to do for Hungarian films, here is my current list.Top 10 Hungarian Films of All Time\n\n1. Sátántangó (1994, Béla Tarr)"
