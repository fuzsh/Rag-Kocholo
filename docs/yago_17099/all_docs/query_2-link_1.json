        "text": "The most charming was perhaps the section in which legendary operetta star Hanna Honthy was visited by a little fan, played by Kálmán Koletár (a Hungarian child actor who's carreer had a mysteriously short lived span), and as they together looked at her photo album, a few of the photos came to life, as the ageless primadonna sang songs from her long time ago successes. The Blue Danube Waltz scene was memorable for the beautiful singing of Mária Gyurkovics, a great opera star, who unfortunately didn't work much in films."
