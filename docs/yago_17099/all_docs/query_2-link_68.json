        "text": "Methodologically, this essay is inspired by Janet Staiger’s conceptualization of the Hollywood Mode of Production, while also building on my own work on the ‘State-socialist Mode of Production’, which is to say the management system and division of labor utilized in Czechoslovakia and the other former socialist countries of East-Central Europe. This industrial perspective is combined with a critical cultural analysis inspired by anthropologically-based studies of film ‘production cultures’ (John T. Caldwell) and communities that utilizes diverse informal sources, such as oral history and (auto)biographies. It looks at how the top-down political and cultural reforms of the Czech film production system between 1948 and 1962 interfered with production routines and hierarchies of the local production culture, i.e. the lived realities of the professional communities. Two examples of failed top-down reorganizations that affected daily production routines are used as symptomatic cases, the first one ‘spatial’, the second one ‘temporal’: first, an experiment that attempted to change the Barrandov studios into an industrial factory integrating all production personnel in one place; and second, a project to forge a new generation of communist, or ‘proletarian’ filmmakers to replace the old ‘veterans’, who were supposedly corrupted by bourgeois ideology of the ‘immoral’ film world. The failures of the top-down reorganizations were due to the passive resistance of the filmmaking community. Both conflicts pushed the community to explicitly articulate its values of professionalism and creative labour (e.g., the so-called filmic qualities and dramatic structure of the script versus dogmatic directives of the socialist realism) in order to differentiate themselves from the young radicals and ‘dilettantes’. This way, the chapter also raises a question of to what extent did these reforms come under the category of so-called Sovietization, or, whether they should be rather termed “self-Sovietization”, resulting in peculiar hybrids of adapted Soviet models with older domestic and German patterns.\n\nThis anthology assembles some of the earliest Czech texts on film published in the period between 1908 and 1939, i.e., between the rise of art cinema and the outbreak of World War II, writings that were instrumental in shaping the various ways film was seen and understood in this formative period. The authors include scientist Jan Evangelista Purkinje, whose studies of the perception of movement from 1819 and 1820 laid the foundation for the rise of the cinematic apparatus, and writers and critics Václav Tille and Karel Čapek, who, years before their counterparts abroad, analyzed cinematic language as it was emerging, reflecting on its genealogy, genres, and future development. How was it possible that, in a country without a well-developed film industry, these cultural and literary critics, linguists, theater directors, architects, and filmmakers articulated ideas and concepts that predated later theoretical developments? This collection suggests that Czech writers benefited from their location at the crossroads of Eastern and Western Europe, where Austrian, Slavic, German, French, and American cultures intermingled. The anthology is organized both thematically and chronologically to reflect the rise of film as a new medium, a cultural institution, and an art form—in other words, to document the discursive construction of film in its variety and multiplicity. The writings express a number of concerns that relate to major trends and forces of modernity in the twentieth century: film is seen as a means to educate and enlighten, as an example of the dynamic relation between time and space, as a new formal model for other arts, as a tool for ideological struggle, and as a unique signifying system. While some of the authors are known to scholars in various fields—Purkinje to historians of science, Karel Teige to students of the European avant-garde, Jan Mukařovský and Roman Jakobson to literary scholars and linguists, and Alexander Hackenschmied (a.k.a. Hammid) to film historians—only a few of their texts on film have been translated into English, and this anthology marks the first time they have been systematically and critically assembled. In this sense, the anthology continues the efforts of recent publications and exhibitions to showcase Central Europe as the site of key moments in art and cultural history. At the same time, it also situates art movements and theories within the complex framework of modernity, whose major forces ranged from technology and mass media to national politics. Instead of focusing on the history of film theory in a narrow academic sense, the anthology presents the reader with a great diversity of genres and styles of writing that address the formation and development of this emblematic component of modernity. In the first half of the twentieth century, film was seen as a medium that overturned the existing hierarchy of cultural values and radically transformed individual subjective experience. The texts herein do not document these transformations from an external, impartial point of view; on the contrary, they are an integral part of these changes—their manifestation and their agents.\n\nThis Master’s thesis examines the period of transition (1928-1935) in Soviet cinema when the avant-garde directors Grigori Kozintsev, Leonid Trauberg, and Oleksandr Dovzhenko, among others, began to make films under the strictures of a new state-mandated socialist realist aesthetic. It argues, despite the prominence of literature which maintains that socialist realism precipitated a conceptual break that effectively ended avant-garde filmmaking practice, that socialist realism simultaneously preserved, developed, and negated elements of the avant-garde cinema. Using Katerina Clark’s The Soviet Novel and Louis Althusser’s “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses,” this thesis first illustrates the programmatic, narrative, and ideological continuities between the aesthetics in Kozintsev and Trauberg’s The New Babylon (1929), Alone (1931), and The Youth of Maxim (1935). These films exemplify how socialist realism perpetuated the modified bildungsroman plot pre-figured by the avant-garde, further transformed Leninism’s spontaneity/consciousness dialectic which ideologically interpellates individuals via social being, and began to utilise continuity editing in place of montage to construct overtonal ideological impressions. Next it explores continuities of visual stylistics in five films by Oleksandr Dovzhenko, Zvenigora (1928), Arsenal (1929), Earth (1930), Ivan (1932), and Aerograd (1935). Here the concepts of the “transitional film” and the “reduced form of stylistics” are introduced. The claim is made that the films made after the introduction of sound technology and before the official codification of socialist realism in 1934 represent a distinct hybrid of the avant-garde and socialist realist aesthetics and that a particular mediation of avant-garde stylistics through the new strictures was practiced. In the films of Dovzhenko, the continuing employment of three devices is identified to support the concept of the reduced form of stylistics: the use of the monocle (single element) lens, the poeticization of death, and stylised figure movement. In identifying the trajectories of plot structure, ideology, and stylistic devices in the transition from the avant-garde to socialist realism, this thesis elucidates significant continuities between the two aesthetics that embody a conceptual development, or sublation, in place of a conceptual break, or pure negation.\n\nComparing the work of late-socialist-era directors Roman Balayan and Mircea Daneliuc with the postsocialist work of Sergey Loznitsa, in this paper I attempt to show that the non-linearity of postmodernism embraced by some directors in postsocialism is more indebted to the work of socialistera directors in Eastern Europe than we might think. Furthermore, I explore the differences of what some critics have called the censorship-dominated style of the so-called “dissident cinema” of socialism and that of the postsocialist directors whose style is predicated on alleged complete freedom of expression. The goal of this comparative approach is to show that, despite the fact that socialist cinema since the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe has been freely associated with indoctrination and propaganda, socialist-era filmmaking represents not only an unforgettable episode in the history of Eastern European cinema, but one that decidedly influenced the aesthetics of what some theorists have dubbed the current nonlinear, post-digital age of contemporary film. Finally, I argue that the 1980s in Eastern Europe and Russia brought to cinema a far more philosophical, complex, and multi-layered approach and style that commented on the human condition from surprisingly less ideological positions than the more celebrated non-linear style of contemporary filmmaking does today.
