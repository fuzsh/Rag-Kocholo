If you're newer to Jancsó than I am (I've seen all the Hungarian features from 1963 to 1974 bar Winter Wind), I daresay it's very impressive indeed, but to me it looked as though he was treading water and revisiting decidedly familiar tropes prior to making the far more accomplished Red Psalm (which I think is one of his three or four major masterpieces).\n\nAnd I saw it at the Era New Horizons festival in Wrocław last summer, along with a whole load of ultra-rare 1960s/70s Hungarian films, most of which aren't out on DVD anywhere.\n\nRe: Hungarian films on DVD\n\nQuote\n\n#52 Post by L.A. » Sat Oct 30, 2010 7:03 am\n\nL.A. wrote:Az aranyember (1962)\n\nSeems to be the first Hungarian film in scope format.\n\nA two disc-set now available.

Clocks in at 83 minutes, longer than the available version suggested in imdb, but significantly shorter than the original 3-part release. The source print was tinted and appears in quite clean condition.\n\nThe 1936 version is a composite of a 35-mm Jugoslavian sourced nitrate positive and a local 16-mm print that was quite heavily damaged (gleaning this from the 5 minute restoration demo feature) . Excellent grey-scale, some tramlines. The soundtrack is quite rough. Includes optional English subtitles.\n\nThe 1962 version is a beautiful color widescreen...but alas, though Hungary's first film shot in anamorphic widescreen, the dvd is not anamorphic. Optional English sub-titles.\n\nExtras:\n\n--English/Hungarian language menus (which usually provide enough context for the materials available)\n\n--Hungarian language essay with marketing materials covering the three releases\n\n--Scene comparison from all three versions (a la comparisons found in Confidential Report and Rules of the Game)\n\n--Half minute excerpt from Korda's 1918 \"Yamata\"\n\n--2 1/2 minute excerpt from 'Before Midnight' (1957) - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051244/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href);return false; - where we see Viktor Gertler directing a film\n\nI hope we can see more of this coming out of the Budapest Film Archive. This is actually Hungary's first silent film to be released on dvd in Hungary, and except for Hyppolit, the only pre-WWII Hungarian films available with subtitles.\n\nRe: Hungarian films on DVD\n\nQuote\n\n#54 Post by skuhn8 » Thu Nov 18, 2010 9:59 am\n\nAfter digging around Magyar Nemzeti Filmarchívum news I've come up with some cool news:\n\nThe following have been released:\n\nSzabó István Trilogy (English subs on features, not special features):\n\n--Álmodozások kora (includes two dialogue-free student films shot in black/white 35mm from '59 and '61 respectively)\n\n--az Apa\n\n--a Szerelmesfilm\n\nThe following are to be released November 25th:\n\nGothár Péter:\n\n--Ajándék ez a nap (w/English subtitles)\n\n--Megáll az idő (w/English subtitles)\n\nGaál István: Sodrásban (w/English subtitles) shot by Sandor Sara!!!\n\nThe above appear to be quite stacked with short films and other special features--unlikely to have English subs\n\nAnd indications that releases of the following are to follow in the near future:\n\nEnyedi Ildikó (Az én XX. századom)\n\nGazdag Gyula (Bástyasétány 74)\n\nGyöngyössy Imre-Kabay Barna kettős (Jób lázadása),\n\nSára Sándor (Fel-feldobott kő)\n\nXantus János (Eszkimó asszony fázik)\n\nThe following projects have officially received funding (restoration) with a view to eventually making their way to DVD:\n\nFeature Films:\n\n- Pesti mese (1937) - Gaál Béla\n\n- Háromszázezer pengő az utcán (1937) - Balogh Béla\n\n- Varieté csillagai (1938) - Baky József\n\n- Hazajáró lélek (1940) - Zilahy Lajos\n\n- Cserebere (1940) - Cserépy László\n\n- Zárt tárgyalás (1940) - Radványi Géza\n\n- Egy tál lencse (1941) - Farkas Zoltán\n\n- Kerek Ferkó (1943) - Martonffy Emil\n\n- Tilos a szerelem (1943) - Kalmár László\n\n- Makkhetes (1944) - Bánky Viktor\n\n- A nagyrozsdási eset (1957) - Kalmár László\n\n- Butaságom története (1965) - Keleti Márton\n\n- Utazás a koponyám körül (1971) - Révész György\n\n- A Pendragon legenda (1974) - Révész György\n\n- Az ötödik pecsét (1976) - Fábri Zoltán\n\n- Az égigérő fű (1979) - Palásthy György\n\n- Pogány Madonna (1980) - Mészáros Gyula\n\n- Vámmentes házasság (1980) - Zsombolyai János\n\n- Cha-cha-cha (1981) - Kovácsi János\n\n- István a király (1983) - Koltay Gábor\n\n- Uramisten (1983) - Gárdos Péter\n\n- A bűvös vadász (1994) - Enyedi Ildikó\n\n- A részleg (1994) - Gothár Péter\n\nShort films/documentaries\n\n- Egyedül (1963) - Sára Sándor\n\n- Kilencedik emelet (1977) - Gyarmathy Lívia\n\n- Háromkirályok (1980) - Szomjas György\n\nLast edited by skuhn8 on Fri Dec 03, 2010 12:53 pm, edited 1 time in total.\n\nRe: Hungarian films on DVD\n\nQuote\n\n#55 Post by MichaelB » Thu Nov 18, 2010 11:17 am\n\nWow!

Gorgeous transfer on what were either very nicely preserved elements or a good restoration. The special features include two of his student films: On the Seventh Day (1959) clocking in at 5 minutes and looking flawless. It's a dialogue-free comedy sketch dealing with the playful temptation of a cleric. Concert (1961) is a dialogue-free playful meditation clocking in at 16 minutes, and again appears to be a tight transfer from a clean 35mm print or negative source. The included 3 1/2 minute excerpt from a 1998 interview with Szabo is not subtitled; nor the 2 1/2 minute video essay (calling out 'sound' sources during the key scene with Halasz Judit) but the latter is still worth a view.\n\nI've got Apa and LoveStory on the shelf for the weekend. Had hoped that the Istvan Gaal film would be in stock...but alas, shops here are slow on the uptake. So far so good: Very impressive work coming out of the archive.\n\nSzabo\n\nQuote\n\n#60 Post by gandskid » Fri Jan 28, 2011 8:17 pm\n\nAnyone know the status of Szabo's German trilogy? - Great films that deserve a definitive release (i.e. Criterion BD). Nothing available in R1 right now (MEPHISTO and REDL oop and HANUSSEN was only ever here on VHS!) SUNSHINE also needs a new issue.\n\nAlso -though off topic-- longing to see BD releases of ISADORA (complete version) and Ken Russell films especially, THE DEVILS, THE BOYFRIEND, WOMEN IN LOVE, MUSIC LOVERS and SAVAGE MESSIAH.\n\nRe: Hungarian films on DVD\n\nQuote\n\n#61 Post by L.A. » Fri Aug 19, 2011 2:12 pm\n\nskuhn8 wrote:Sára Sándor (Fel-feldobott kő)\n\nAny news when this might be released?\n\nRe: Hungarian films on DVD\n\nQuote\n\n#62 Post by alfons416 » Fri Aug 19, 2011 7:06 pm\n\nI'm going to Budapest on Tuesday.

If you see 'mb' in a film listing it means that the film is dubbed in Hungarian.\n\nFor DVDs your best bet is hitting Alexandra book stores (good one across from Nyugati train station, which is itself worth visiting for historic/architecture reasons, briefly glimpsed at the start of 'Before Sunrise'). Also the electronics stores at any of the malls--Media Markt or Saturn--will offer most of the Hungarian films currently available on DVD. Note that 'Angol' is Hungarian for English and 'felirat' means subtitles.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nRe: Hungarian films on DVD\n\nQuote\n\n#64 Post by MichaelB » Mon Aug 22, 2011 8:05 am\n\nTo add to that, the Műcsarnok exhibition hall sells copies of the Béla Balázs Studio DVD compilations.\n\nOne word of warning: despite the text on the cover being bilingual in Hungarian and English, the disc 'Beginnings' is only in Hungarian (annoyingly and bafflingly, as that's the most internationally appealing, with early shorts from people like István Szabó). But I can confirm from first-hand experience that the other three discs are English-friendly.\n\nRe: Hungarian films on DVD\n\nQuote\n\n#65 Post by skuhn8 » Fri Sep 16, 2011 7:48 am\n\nIldiko Enyedi's Az én XX. századom (My 20th Century) has finally been released on DVD in Hungary with English subtitles.\n\nAnother addition to the MNFA archive collection--\n\nSurprisingly English-friendly Bástyasétány hetvennégy (Singing on the Treadmill) Made by Gyula Gazdag in 1974, only released in 1984.\n\nThe edition contains Deleted scenes with English-subtitled commentary by the director explaining how it came to be banned. Also a 15 minute short film from the camera operator, New Years. Bi-lingual magazine review by J. Hoberman providing analysis and context.\n\nRe: Hungarian films on DVD\n\nQuote\n\n#66 Post by L.A. » Thu Nov 03, 2011 8:15 pm\n\nMiklós Jancsó's Csillagosok, katonák available on DVD in Hungary.

Not enough of a fan of this film to double-dip to find out, but the 52 minute supplement concerning the history of the film from 2011 looks intriguing.

And since Red Psalm and Szindbád have recently undergone stellar digital restorations, here's hoping that this is in the same category."
