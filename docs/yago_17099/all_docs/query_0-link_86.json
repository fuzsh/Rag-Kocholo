        "text": "In Part III: The Emerging European Complex, I outline the geopolitical aspect of the research field, drawing on Immanuel Wallerstein’s world-systems theory (1974), and situate Hungary and Poland within the post-socialist semiperipheral patterns of capitalist production. In order to contribute to the world-systems analysis with an ideologico-critical register, I elaborate the concept of the ‘European complex’, which is a class analytical account drawing on the registers of Lacanian ontology and which I understand as the ideological portrayal of the European commedia dell’arte of conflicts, that provides the political coordinates (the frameworks and roles) for a semiperipheral theater. I argue that the basic modalities of the European complex with regards to post-socialist semiperipheral countries are (1) the disavowal of class politics and the negligence of the critique of political economy, (2) the ideologico-discursive constitution of the hegemonic frontiers on the streets (rather than in legal frameworks) and within micro-institutional contexts, and (3) the emergence of ‘advanced imaginality’ (i.e. the extension and displacement of the far right imaginaries). Then, I introduce the ethnographic research that I conducted in Poland, and I discuss the dispositif of a Gypsy settlement. I argue that the primordial distinctive modality of the semiperipheral hybrid ghetto is its strong omnipresent and omnipotent interinstitutional character (from the omnipresent police-and-penal apparatus to the strong presence of public institutions), where the ideological constellation of the discursive landscapes of poverty is constituted. Then, I locate the dominant ideological nodal points in the discursive field and dispositif of the settlement (begging, air pollution), which are superimposed by legal and human rights discourses, mediated through the punishment of the poor (Wacquant, 2009), ‘NGOization’ (Choudry & Kapoor, 2013), and ‘circusification’. I then situate the two schools – where I organized working group meetings with the teachers of Gypsy children from the settlement – within the discursive landscape of the dispositif. I discuss the reasons for failing to organize household visits with the teachers in the settlement. I argue that the possibility for enhancing transformative teacher learning via teachers’ active and reflective engagement with the social environment was constrained both by how the educational apparatus is positioned in its respective dispositif and by the postsocialist struggles over the modalities of operation of the educational apparatus, which I characterize by introducing the ideologico-critical concepts of ‘neverland syndrome,’ the parallax between the glorification and infantilization, appreciation and degradation of the teachers work (e.g. Labaree, 1992); ‘the atrophy of the pedagogical,’ the learnification and instrumentalization of education at the expense of the primordial pedagogical question of the telos in education (e.g. Biesta, 2015); and ‘cynical pedagogy,’ the pedagogical practice structured against and despite what the subject knows. By illuminating my research experiences in Poland and Romania, I try to show how I reshaped the method of my research in Hungary. I argue that, while in Poland, I was focusing on the settlement as an educationally meaningful place for teacher education, approaching its respective dispositif as merely an informative modality. In Hungary, I started to consider the dispositif of advanced marginality itself as educationally meaningful for teachers’ transformative learning. Then, I locate the dominant ideological nodal points of the dispositif (drug market, environmental degradation and the ethnitization of poverty), characterized by the ‘dissolution and detotalization of meaning’, channeled through middle class imaginaries, psychopatologization of social problems, and the institutional merger between the apparatuses and the local political regime. Then I discuss the working group meetings in the ghetto school, which were completely open for the institutional actors, in order to confront the teachers with the school’s respective dispositif. I argue that there were at least two promising aspects of this confrontation that are subversive in potentia: ‘the gaze of the dispositif,’ i.e., teachers realizing how the school is ‘secretly’ embedded in a broader micro-institutional context that shapes the daily aspect of their pedagogical practices; and ‘the pedagogy of hopelessness’, that is coming to terms with the impotence of education in fulfilling the spectacular desires that the contemporary education gospel depicts on it (upward mobility, quality and equity, the fullness of the society) and giving up false, fetishistic hopes that are so characteristic to pedagogical philosophies, especially in critical pedagogy (e.g. Freire, 1994). In the concluding part, The Repressed of Pedagogy, I briefly outline the foundations of a critical critique of Freirean critical pedagogy (and the pedagogy of hope). Based on the empirical experience of the research, I argue for conceptualizing a pedagogical account based on the recent philosophical directions of Badiou (2010) and Žižek (2017), considering it as an already emerging field of research, which is called ‘the pedagogy of the impossible’ by McMillan (2015) referring to the pedagogical value of the lacking subject, and to which I refer as ‘the pedagogy of the Real’."
