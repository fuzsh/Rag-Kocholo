        "text": "If you don't already have a dislike for entitled and privileged classist people, you probably will after this one. I don't think there are that many films from this era that focus on a struggling woman's existence without her being \"just\" someone's something but a person herself to this extent and I really appreciated that.\n\nAlso I'm starting to think Pál Fejös has to be one of the most underrated directors from the 1920s/1930s because the 3 films of his I watched so far were all at least a 3.5 out of 5 in my book.\n\nIf anyone is looking for a version with English subs try looking up \"Spring,Shower (Tavaszi zápor)_1932_ [Pál Fejös]\" on your preferred search engine. That being said, I think one gets the film without subs too since this has a fair amount of expressionism going for it and doesn't exactly rely on a lot of dialogue.\n\nThe regularity of spring revival dramatized through an adaptation of a folk tale that I suspect may be entirely made up, its homespun nature merely part of the exoticized old-World package. A significant downgrade from Fejos’ silent work, but still contains some interesting elements, primarily the central performance from Mária Szabó, who goes through the usual calvary of indignities imposed upon a pregnant out of wedlock woman in this era. Weirdest part is that she appears to fall prey to her last-minute, candy-dangling suitor right in the front yard of her employer’s house, although an abashed scene transition leaves this a bit murky. Best moment is the terminally bathetic ascension to heaven, in which Fejos finally gets to let loose, a riotous explosion of style that culminates in her rebirth as some kind of weather-controlling, time-bending deity. Kind of feels tangentially related to Twin Peaks: The Return in this sense, but highly doubt Lynch ever saw this.\n\nA young woman is seduced and becomes pregnant out of wedlock and is soon cast out of her community. This is an early talkie and thus actually contains not a lot of dialogue but you don't really need a lot of dialogue to tell the story of this unfortunate young lady and the attitudes of society towards women and sexuality and how it can lead to suffering and cruelty. Director Pal Fejos is an excellent visual director and the lead performance by Annabella is heartbreaking (still heavily relies on her face). Although the ending seems to be giving the film mixed messages, it is overall an exquisite film which packs a lot in its just over one hour run time."
