        "text": "Christianity, the Proof: The Sindone is the greatest prove\n\nAt this time and age when atheism is rampant and those who don’t believe in God flaunt openly and freely their dis-believe with great enthusiasm and fanfare, it is time for those who believe to express their view. For a believer in God, the afterlife, and that we do not end by being buried but our souls carry on living, sometimes our voices are muted. We should not be intimidated. We should express our views as freely as the atheists do theirs.\n\nAfter reading and travelling that much, and discussing endlessly such topics; one reaches a stage where certain facts are so dear and clear.\n\nI’ve been to the holy Land three times, to Rome many times the last was this year (2017) purely a pilgrimage visit, been to Lourdes and Fatima, and many other Holy places. Also met Holy people from whom I learned a lot. I shared many of my experiences in discussions, talks and writings. However, in my own sphere of believe, I came across one object which surpass all others in terms of expressing a deep believe in God with an undisputed evidence. This is the Sindone “The Shroud of Turin”. I visited St Giovanni Battesta Cathedral in Turin to see the Sindone three times when it was placed on public display (2010 and 2015). There is no other ancient artefact that was subjected to such thorough research as the Sindone. It was one of the first to be photographed and had all sort of scientists taking part in studying it thoroughly over several decades, many of these scientists were unbelievers, so there was no preconceived agenda. Many books and countless articles resulted from such researches and all are readily available. The authenticity of the Sindone proves the following:\n\n1. Christ was/is a true historical figure\n\n2. That Christ Resurrected when He was wrapped by the Sindone in the Sepulchre in Jerusalem.\n\n3. The Sindone shows that Christ died by crucifixion.\n\n4. That the narrative of the Passion as narrated in the Gospels is true.\n\n5. The Gospels reflect true events at least when it relates to the Passion Week (I’m confining my presentation hereby to the Sindone).\n\n6. It is widely accepted that the most difficult issue in the historicity of Christianity is the Resurrection of Christ from the dead as no such event was ever recorded and it defies nature, but here in the Sindone we have the scientific prove that it did happen. How to explain it is a different matter, but it did happen.\n\n7. It follows that if Christ was resurrected then he also died through crucifixion and was entombed and proves for this are provided by the Sindone.\n\n8. People could agree or disagree about Theology and much other aspects in practicing the faith but the basic premise that Christ was crucified, buried and resurrected in undisputed.\n\nThe Sindone is the greatest single scientific witness to Christianity.\n\nSt Giovanni Battesti, Turin\n\nThe Sindone on display\n\nThe Sindone, Christ from Front\n\nPhotgraph\n\nFace of Christ\n\nPhotograph of Face of Christ"
