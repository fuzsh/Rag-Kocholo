        "text": "A Christmas Prayer December 25 Sweet Jesus, You were born in a stable on that first Christmas to become divine light in a dark, sinful world. Your little holy family was full of love, grace, kindness, and generosity. I ask Mary and Joseph to pray for my family to grow in the virtues that spring from unconditional love. I also ask them to pray for the growth of our faith. O Savior, increase our unity and give us a shared devotion to Your Holy Family. Purify me and teach me to identify my sins and change my ways so that Your light increases within me. Show me how to let Your light shine so brightly that my family sees You and is transformed by Your presence. Holy Family, pray for us. Amen. https://lnkd.in/eJP9VeA This prayer is from “Daily Prayers with the Saints” https://lnkd.in/ggKxNVJ #catholiclife #lovetogod #catholicmassreadings #catholicreflections #newlifeincrist #faithinjesus #walkingwithgod #theloveofgod #catholicfamilies #catholicsyoung #catholiccouples"
