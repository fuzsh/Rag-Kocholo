The incident was widely held to be in retaliation for an assault on a 12-year-old Muslim girl in November 2009, a sentiment publicly endorsed by Qena Governor and Copt, General Magdi Ayoub. Despite this, speculation continued in the days following from activists, analysts and academics, on the ‘true’ motives behind the incident. For Coptic organisations, both within Egypt and in the wide Coptic diaspora, the attack was evidence of systematic persecution: the Copts were a ‘beleaguered minority’. The International Coptic Council (ICC), an umbrella body for over 100 Coptic organisations worldwide, issued a statement condemning the assault and released a series of recommendations aimed at safeguarding ‘the rights of the Coptic minority’.1 In contrast, the government was quick to view the attack as a case of criminality and not within a framework of sectarianism. At an emergency Shura Council session, Mufid Shehab, Minister of Legal Affairs and Parliamentary Councils, claimed that: ‘No religious dimension should be attached to this incident, only a criminal one’.2 Despite this verbal facade however, a high visible police and military presence was kept in the areas surrounding the attacks in order to avoid sectarian clashes in the days following the attacks. While the government continued to claim in public that this was a ‘civilian criminal’ case, it sought to remedy the problem\n\n2\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\nwithin the State Security apparatus.3 The government publicly condemned the murders and quickly, in an ad-hoc manner, sought to apprehend suspects in order to draw a line under the incident. 4 Closely linked to the official state perspective, Rafiq Habib, a prominent Coptic writer, dismissed claims that this was another example of sectarianism in Egypt, adding that it was an anomalous event. Sessions in Parliament led by Chairman Safwat al-Sherif reiterated the age-old Egyptian slogan, ‘religion for God and the nation for all’, an expression of the division between religion and the state.5 The attempt to downplay the incident and promote an image of national unity was also highlighted when Fouad Allam, the former head of Egyptian State Security, suggested the involvement of foreign bodies. These ‘terrorists’, he argued, aimed to penetrate the country as was the case in Lebanon and Iraq by undermining national security and promoting sectarianism in Egypt. 6 These perspectives serve as a useful benchmark to assess how issues related to the Copts in Egypt are viewed both within and outside the country. For those cited, the events of Naga Hammadi fit into a broader framework of persecution, criminality, an anomalous event or terrorism. The government, its supporters and those who wish to coalesce in an attempt to avoid retribution by the state, advocate the latter three benchmarks; this mostcommonly rears itself under the banner of national-unity. While for the vast majority of Coptic commentators and a substantial number of Non-Governmental Organisations, charities and activists, the incident was a clear-cut case of persecution. Examination of this amongst other incidents, are clearly bound within fixed benchmarks and definitions, placing persecution and national unity as the main opposing bulwarks. Contestability of these benchmarks, result in accusations by the state and those who place national unity above a public discussion of communal discord, as damaging to the integrity and cohesiveness of the Egyptian nation. In contrast, remonstration against the Copts, in any form, is met by a response of pitting the majority Muslim population and state against a minority Christian community. This book challenges some of the long-established modes of analysis that have emerged both within the Arabic and Western discourse relating to the Copts. It is maintained that the existing\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\napproaches on the Copts fail to take into account the divergent opinions prevalent within the Coptic community, which, consequently, is depicted as monolithic and stagnant. 7 The lack of power accounted to individual Coptic actors is replaced by an assessment of Coptic history through the lens of a fixed internal hierarchy headed by the Coptic Pope. This view fails to address the impact that modernisation of the Egyptian state and of Church structures had on the relationship between various actors and existing structures. Similarly, the Coptic community is portrayed as passive and submissive in its response to inter-communal tensions that have arisen in Egypt. The outcome of this is a community defined exclusively in relation to its Muslim Egyptian counterparts. The vast majority of analysis which places the Copts within the framework of a ‘minority under threat’ or within the folds of ‘national unity’, reveal socio-political agendas which are peculiarly localised to Egypt. While such analyses offer some insight into understanding the Copts, they are intrinsically problematic. To begin with, there are two inherent yet flawed assumptions in the discourse which views Copts as under threat. Firstly is the assumption that all Copts are distinguishable from their Muslim counterparts, thus serving to solidify the traditional millat/minority label applied to the Copts as a unified community. The second assumption being that this threat is omnipresent from organised hostile groups or random mob violence. Both Westerners and Egyptians have perpetuated these points of view throughout the modern period. For example, Kyriakos Mikhail, a Copt living in Britain presented a series of articles in 1911.8 In the preface by Reverend Professor Sayce (1846–1933), an Egyptologist and linguist at Oxford University, he described the Copts as: The genuine Egyptians […] They alone trace an unadulterated descent from the race to whom the civilisation and culture of the ancient world was so largely due. Thanks to their religion, they have kept their blood pure from admixture with semibarbarous Arabs and savage Kurds, or other foreign elements whom the licentiousness of Mohammedan family life has introduced into the country. 9\n\n4\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\nSayce’s comments highlight an opinion that was prominent in the early twentieth century, maintaining that Copts were the purest form of Egyptians as the ancestors of the Pharaohs. As a result, he defined the Copts as a minority in relation to the Muslims who were of ‘barbarous’ origins.10 Continuing in the same vein, Coptic writers, who published their works after the death of President Gamal ‘Abd al-Nasser and Pan-Arab nationalism in the 1970s, have argued that since the Arab invasion of 641, Copts have been actively persecuted and have feared for their own safety. 11 The image of the Copt as the beleaguered minority under constant threat is perpetuated by the reconstruction of the historical persecutions faced by the Copts beginning with Emperor Diocletian (c.236–316). The massacre, which started in 302 AD but is counted from the beginning of Diocletian’s reign in 284 AD, is maintained in the community's imagination through the adoption of a calendar which is dated to ‘The Era of Martyrs’ (AM or Anno Martyrum).12 The impact of the Era of Martyrs cannot be underestimated when discussing Coptic attitudes towards their community given that between 144,000 and 800,000 people were martyred in Egypt from the third century onwards.13 The Egyptologist and cultural historian Saphinaz Amal Naguib, has argued that, following the massacre in the third century, the Coptic Church built around the community a shared history of persecution, which has surrounded a narrative arc of events dating back to the Era of Martyrs. 14 Thus, the Church acted as the protector of communal inclusion and cohesiveness of identity against external aggression; it cemented a barrier of exclusion in opposition to those who wished to perpetuate harm against the Copts. The creation of a new calendar, based on the Era of Martyrs, served to record Coptic history against obliteration by dominant persecuting forces ensuring that the Copts would not become ‘history-less’ nor would they be excluded from the narrative of the state. Instead their history would be placed alongside and run concurrently to an Egyptian national grand narrative. Thus, the Era of Martyrs narrative asserted that a ‘multiplicity of histories’ could co-exist within the same geographic region.15\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nThe Era of Martyrs has also become a useful tool by which modern Copts can identify any form of persecution or discrimination as part of a historical process of eternal martyrdom. This is attained through the recreation of the image of the Coptic martyr throughout history. Commemoration is, even today, bolstered by the abundance of literature and icons dedicated to past and present martyrs, some of whom became saints. Therefore, while the commonality of suffering created a cohesiveness of identity as argued by Naguib, it should also be noted that the Era of Martyrs served to reinforce the ecclesiastical hierarchy by painting religious affinity and spirituality through persecution as one of the main unifying features of the community. Naguib has failed to recognise that the ‘multiplicity of histories’ that she discusses also assisted in the reinforcement of an official ‘Church narrative’, thus denying a voice to the various Coptic actors and the multiple Coptic histories that arose in conjunction with, in opposition to and separate from the Era of Martyrs narrative. The persecuted minority discourse is best highlighted however, by the abundance of literature, in both Arabic and Western languages that has appeared since the 1970s. The historical context is significant, since it was with the ascendancy of President Anwar al-Sadat to power in October 1970 that a new approach towards politics and a wave of intolerance in Egypt developed. Sadat’s move towards a liberalised free market, through his policy of infitah (Open Door), and his subsequent leniency towards the Muslim Brotherhood, which had been oppressed under Nasser, changed the social, political and economic landscape of Egypt. 16 With Sadat’s announcement to alter the Egyptian Constitution in 1971 from Sharia Law being a source of legislation, to the principle source of legislation, a clear state trend towards alienating nonMuslims from public participation was asserted.17 Clashes between Islamists and Copts in the 1970s, including the burning of a prominent church in Khanka, thirty kilometres outside Cairo, in September 1972, has led to the increasing currency of theoretical frameworks which view communal tensions between Copts and the Muslim Egyptian community as either a clash of civilisations or as the inevitable outcome of the Copts status as a ‘minority’.18 This further bolsters the assumption that organised hostile groups and\n\n6\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\nmob violence against the Copts are a constant threat. The implicit result of this is that the definition of a Copt is always in relation to a Muslim. No consideration or examination is made of the various Coptic factions and ‘the Copt’ is not compared to ‘other Copts’ from different social classes or of differing ideological persuasions. Instead, the cohesive minority approach has served to reinforce earlier representations of the battle against the forces of oppression and persecution as manifested by the Era of Martyrs discourse. Conversely, the same period also saw a rise in a number of accounts, mainly written by Coptic commentators and social scientists, who used the context of the tensions of the 1970s to promote the idea of Egyptian national unity. This co-existence and co-operation, they argued, had been prevalent since the 1919 revolution. Milad Hanna’s, Na‘am Aqbat, lakin Misriyun, (Yes Copts, but Egyptian), published in 1980, was an attack on the violence of the late-1970s.19 Hanna argued that Egyptian identity was made up of elements of at least seven pillars, which married, amongst others, Egypt’s: ‘Sunni face, Shia blood, Coptic heart, and Pharaonic bones’ a reference to Egypt’s historical lineage.20 It was only through understanding the various components of Egyptian identity and looking at selected historical examples, such as the growth of Egyptian nationalism in the face of British occupation between 1882 and 1952, that one could argue that differences between Egypt's multiple communities were negligible.21 Similarly, historian Tariq al-Bishri also used the period of the British occupation as the backdrop for his discussion concerning CopticMuslim relations; he argued that whilst historical relations were at times tense, the shared experience of colonial occupation meant integration and co-operation, especially during the 1919 Revolution, became inevitable.22 Thus, this nationalist discourse has supported the idea that the Copts were, and still are, an integral component of the Egyptian state.23 This approach is once again problematic as this narrative denies the Copts self-agency to promote a different version of events; instead, Copts, Muslims and other participants in 1919 are grouped together as a cohesive unit and labelled ‘Egyptian’. The Copts are presented as a monolithic whole who adopted a one-dimensional unified approach to the question of national independence.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nWhat the above discussions on the Copts, although vastly different in outlook, share is their failure to address a problem in their main term of reference: The Coptic community is referred to as an undifferentiated, undivided mass. Historian Paul Sedra, whilst correctly highlighting this, only addresses the cleavages through identifying Coptic history in relation to the Muslim Brotherhood and the Egyptian state in the 1970s.24 While Sedra does not give the Copts the ‘victim’ label, he nonetheless inadvertedly adopts the ‘Era of Martyrs’ approach of analysis by viewing the Copts as being eternally in resistance to persecuting forces. This fails to recognise that Coptic intra-communal cleavages or factionalism existed and that it is necessary to understand these in order to fully appreciate the ways in which the Coptic ‘community’ responded to wider national events. Taking these considerations on board, this book addresses a number of developments within the Coptic community from the mid-nineteenth century onwards. It seeks to address a shortcoming in the extant literature, which has thus far neglected to take intraCoptic divergences of opinion into account. As will be discussed in the following work, a more nuanced understanding of Coptic perceptions of the ‘community’ is necessary, and in achieving this understanding, a reassessment of the relationship between various segments of the ‘community’ and the Egyptian state, radicalised political groups, foreign actors and ultimately with itself will be made. Most of the existing historical literature in the Arabic language uses limited primary documentation, interviews or memoirs. 25 Conversely, the literature produced in the West can be criticised for its near-complete dependence on the use of British archival materials.26 This book utilises both Arabic and Western sources. The archives at Dar al-Watha’iq al-Qawmi (The Egyptian National Archives) and the United Kingdom National Archives (TNA), known as the Public Records Office, in Kew, have been used extensively, when access to the documents was possible. Other Western primary sources used include the Lambeth Palace Anglican Church Archives (LP); Newspapers in Western languages, particularly English and French, held at Colindale Newspaper Library and the British Library have also been used in order to\n\n8\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\ncontextualise and assess with contemporary sources the periods under consideration.27 Given the sensitivity of Coptic-related issues in Egypt today, access to view documents at Dar al-Watha’iq alQawmi was limited.28 Extraordinarily, the Egyptian Ministry of Interior applies less stringent restrictions on periodicals which are also housed at the same location. A more gradated image of the Coptic community has been attained through the consultation of magazines printed by Coptic philanthropic and benevolent societies29, religious societies30, individual communal leaders31 and mainstream dailies.32 Use of these sources makes this work unique as the vast majority of these Coptic periodicals have never been consulted in any other work hitherto published in either English or Arabic. Further to this, diaries and memoirs of prominent politicians, such as Sa‘d Zaghlul, alongside published editions of archival material in Arabic from Dar al-Watha’iq have also complemented these materials.33 Two main themes run throughout the forthcoming chapters. First, the ways in which the notions of social, political and cultural identity were used by Copts, Egyptians and Westerners in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: Coptic group identity, as defined by their millat, was based on a collective understanding of ‘self’ founded on commonality of religious beliefs. This book will question whether this definition of Coptic identity manifested itself as a collective Coptic response to various historical situations.34 Similarly, the question of the evolution of an Egyptian national identity based on a processual collective self-understanding, which was particularly spearheaded by anti-colonial opposition between 1882 and 1952, will be analysed. Moreover, this book seeks to address the extent to which notions of inclusion and exclusion can be used as analytical tools to explain the evolution of social and political identities in Egypt. This book is divided into two sections: Part One addresses the inter-communal relations between Copts and the Egyptian state against the backdrop of the development of Egyptian politics and society between 1805 and 1946. Chapter 1 provides a historical analysis of the modernisation policies implemented by the ‘father of modern Egypt’, Muhammad ‘Ali (1769–1849) and the impact that the notion of equality, advocated and pursued in part by ‘Ali, had\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\non the Coptic community. Similarly, the roles played by Pope Kyrillos IV, also known as Abu Islah (1854–1861), and the European missionaries on the community in the nineteenth century, is discussed in light of the formation of the Majlis al-Milli or community council and a new Coptic landowning elite. Chapter 2 considers the formation of new national identities following the British occupation of Egypt, assessing the impact of colonial rule on the administration and development of the Coptic community up to 1919. In particular, Coptic-British relations are discussed between 1882 and 1914, including the role played by Copts in government and bureaucratic positions, considering whether a policy of ‘divide and rule’ was followed. The emergence of party politics and the articulation of a supposed ‘united national identity’ is assessed during the Coptic Question of 1908 to 1911. This raised pertinent questions concerning British policies over the issue of equality in the years preceding the First World War. Similarly, the role played by Coptic ‘agitators’ in party politics in the years leading up to 1919 are used as evidence of Coptic mobilisation. The casestudies of Akhnoukh Fanous and Qommus Sergius highlight some of the varied and often opposing opinions prevalent within the community concerning participation in Egyptian politics as well as in the wider national movement of 1919. Chapter 3 investigates the impact of interwar politics on the Coptic community. Following the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, the Wafd which had been considered the traditional nationalist party of Egyptian politics, declined in prominence. With this in consideration, the chapter assesses the diminishing role of Copts in public employment and the question concerning the distribution of government public funds on the community. The case study of prominent Coptic politician, Makram Obeid (1870–1971), and the ‘Black Book’ scandal are examined in light of the twilight of the Wafd Party and the emergence of other nationalist political parties. Moreover, this chapter examines Coptic responses to the emergence of political Islam in Egypt following the Second World War. In particular, the two case studies of Salama Musa, a secular Coptic writer, and Qommus Sergius, a religious reformer, provide evidence of various political and intellectual responses to the Islamic threat.\n\n10\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\nPart Two of this book addresses intra-communal dimensions of the community including factionalism and internal developments. Chapter 4 concentrates on the emergence of Coptic benevolent and philanthropic societies from the late nineteenth century until 1945. These were led essentially, although not exclusively, by the new Coptic educated classes who had benefited from the process of modernisation implemented by the Church and by the Egyptian state. This chapter highlights the essential role played by politically active urban Coptic elites who provided palliative and social care for the community beginning in 1881. This included establishing educational facilities and funding social welfare, and thus presented a source of support as an alternative to the welfare provided by the Church and the state. In particular, this chapter assesses the role played by the lay Majlis al-Milli, and the various societies in their attempt to regulate the distribution of awqaf as a form of beneficence between 1883 and 1927, which they argued, was under the maladministration of the Church hierarchy. Both Chapters 5 and 6 are case studies which specifically address Coptic internal factionalism between 1944 and 1954. Chapter 5 investigates the different factions that participated in: first, the election of Pope Macarius in 1944 which was for the first time articulated as a modern political campaign. Second, the issue concerning the nature of and control over Coptic waqf following Macairus’ victory is examined. The chapter demonstrates that the waqf debate, rather than modernise the community, propelled it into greater factionalism. Similarly, Chapter 6 examines the impact of the 1952 Free Officers revolution on the Coptic Church highlighting the radicalisation of the activities of Coptic youths following the revolution and the ways in which both lay and religious Coptic reformers were able to negotiate a place for themselves in postrevolutionary Egypt. It is argued that the policy of Al-Tathir (cleansing/ purification), initiated by the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) against the old political orders beginning in 1952, was appropriated by a group of lay educated Coptic youths. Jama‘at al-Ummah al-Qibtiyyah (JUQ), who were aggravated by the continuous waqf disputes and rumours of corruption within the Church, abducted Pope Yusab II with the aim of implementing a policy of reform and modernisation in 1954.\n\n1 RELIGION AND STATEBUILDING IN THE KHEDIVAL PERIOD (1798–1882)\n\nMuhammad ‘Ali and the Khedival Period The beginnings of the modern Egyptian state are usually accredited to the policies of Muhammad ‘Ali (1769–1849), who along with his successors, brought about a period of great economic, political and social change to Egyptian society in the nineteenth century. 1 This process had an impact on the Copts in both social and political spheres.2 Muhammad ‘Ali became the ruler of Egypt in 1805 when he deposed his chief Mamluk rival with the support of the ‘ulama’ of Cairo. Between 1809 and 1812 he succeeded in destroying the remnants of the power of the Mamluks, who had up until the French invasion of 1798 been the nominal rulers of Egypt.3 Following the entrapment and massacre of the Mamluks at the citadel in 1811, Muhammad ‘Ali followed a comprehensive program of political modernisation.4 The policies by Muhammad ‘Ali and his successors, contributed to blurring the social, political and legal boundaries between residents in Egypt. Exact records of the numbers in the various communities in Egypt are difficult to find given the fact that no births or deaths were registered until the latter half of the nineteenth century. 5 Nonetheless, a rough calculation was made in the late-1820s to ascertain the size of the population. This was based on the number of houses in Egypt and the assumption that the inhabitants of each house in the cities amounted to eight dwellers, with four in the provinces. British\n\n14\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\ntravel writer Edward Lane estimated 2,500,000 inhabitants in Egypt. Of these numbers, 1,750,000 were Muslim Egyptians, while there were 150,000 Copts, representing the largest ethnically ‘Egyptian’ Christian community in Egypt. Lane also calculated that the number of Turko-Circassians in Egypt was 10,000 whilst Syrian, Greek and Jewish communities amounted to 5,000 inhabitants each, and were mainly based in urban centres such as Cairo and Alexandria. Armenian Christians were said to number 2,000, and the remaining 70,000 were uncertain and variable.6 Born around 1769 to an Albanian family in the town of Kavala in the Ottoman Empire, now in modern-day northern Greece, Muhammad ‘Ali’s own ethnic origin is a highly contested question, particularly in post-revolutionary Egypt; he has widely been considered to be the founder of the modern Egyptian state.7 Muhammad ‘Ali was clearly a member of the Ottoman elite. He arrived in Egypt under the direction of the Ottoman Sultan in 1801 with 6,000 Albanian troops part of a 10,000 man Ottoman force, sent to collaborate with British forces against the French.8 Yet his subsequent modernisation policies were geared towards the development of Egypt as a separate political entity from the Ottoman Empire. In 1831, Muhammad ‘Ali invaded Syria and threatened the viability of the empire itself, prompting the intervention of European powers. 9 His policy served to centralise and consolidate his own control over Egypt, thus securing his dynasty’s future. Muhammad ‘Ali linked the idea that a soldier of Ottoman Turkish origin, and his dynasty, could not only rule Egypt, but become an integral part of it. This was much to the dismay of the chronicler ‘Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti, who became reknown for his accounts of Egypt. 10 Soon after Muhammad ‘Ali came to power he wrote: Oh Egypt look at your children [Awladik], whilst they are scattered far and tortured, you [Egypt] have been colonised by the worst of the Turks and Jews […] they wage war against your children, they kill your heroes, they overcome your knights and destroy your role, they live in your castles, and corrupt your children. [ 19th Dhu al-Qa’dah /January 1807]11\n\nRELIGION AND STATE-BUILDING\n\nThe Question of Religious Equality\n\n15\n\nMuhammad ‘Ali pursued a strategy for the inclusion of all the inhabitants of Egypt within its territorial entity; this was implemented through policies of religious and ethnic tolerance, commenting that ‘I do not wish there to be any difference between my subjects based on difference of religion, the only difference is the way that they pray in their temples’.12 Christians were allowed, for the first time, to ring church bells as well as to carry the crucifix in public.13 Muhammad ‘Ali also helped to facilitate pilgrimages to the Holy Land, which in previous centuries had been hampered by restrictions. A Khedival Decree issued in 1819 also eased the sanction on building churches, which had previously been subject to limitations.14 Writing in 1954, Coptic historian Jacques Tajer claimed that Muhammad ‘Ali never refused a request by Copts to build a church; this would become a point of contention later in the twentieth century.15 Four Copts were also nominated to the position of provincial governors in the 1830s.16 These developments were viewed very favourably, by both Coptic commentators and European contemporaries travelling through Egypt, as one of the brightest periods in the modern history of the Coptic Church.17 The significance of Muhammad ‘Ali’s reign, with regards to Coptic religious expression, is illustrated by the changing nature of dress codes. Traditionally, the Copts had worn similar clothes to the Muslims, although it was largely distinguishable by a black, blue, grey or light brown turban. 18 By 1818, however, Al-Jabarti highlighted with some displeasure and apprehension, new developments in Coptic life which placed Copts on a more equal footing: A gathering of the opposite sects of the Millats [amongst whom the] Coptic and Greeks [were called upon] and [told] that they should continue wearing blue and black robes but not wear white turbans; [this was because] they had exceeded their allowance in all aspects, they turban [themselves] in coloured cashmere shawls [that are] expensive in price. They ride elegant horses and mules, [and] in front and behind them [are] servants with sticks in their hands; they hit the [local]\n\n16\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\npeople out of their [Copts and Greeks] way, it is not assumed by the observer that they [Copts] are any less than in the highest employment of the state; some go out into the countryside and carry arms. [Jumada al-Ula 1232H/ 9th March– 7th April 1818] 19 Similarly, before the accession of Muhammad ‘Ali, Copts and Jews were not permitted to ride horses, but it seems that this restriction was lifted in Egypt despite being upheld in Syria even after Ibrahim Pasha’s (1789–1848) invasion in 1831.20 Al-Jabarti provides an eloquent illustration of the attitude of a Muslim ‘alim towards the improved status of non-Muslim religious groups in the early period of Muhammad ‘Ali’s rule. Another recorded case of Muhammad ‘Ali’s more lenient attitude towards millat groups, is taken from 1844 when Sidhoum Bishoi, a Coptic scribe residing in the town of Damietta, was accused of insulting Islam. With popular backing, the governor of the province forced Bishoi to convert to Islam or face a public flogging. Bishoi chose the latter and later died from his wounds. He was consecrated a martyr on 25th March 1844. Upon hearing of this, Muhammad ‘Ali ordered the exile of the governor for his actions.21 The apparent shift in policy towards the Copts, along with other religious and non-indigenous groups, served a dual purpose: firstly, Muhammad ‘Ali’s policies of tolerance assisted, to a certain extent, to legitimise his own rule as he was keen to establish his credentials and that of his family as the new rulers of Egypt. Secondly, the process of state centralisation and modernisation which was being implemented, required the integration of groups such as the Christians who were better trained than the Muslim population in the fields of accountancy and land surveying.\n\nState-Building and Modernisation\n\nMuhammad ‘Ali and his successors implemented a modernisation program which had a dramatic effect on the inhabitants of Egypt. Muhammad ‘Ali initially regarded this policy of modernisation and reform as a necessary process in the construction of a centralised Egyptian state which, had nominal independence from the Ottoman Empire.22 Modernisation took the form of a new army,\n\nRELIGION AND STATE-BUILDING\n\n17\n\nbureaucracy and greater attention to state-sponsored education. He began the process by creating a new modernised army; having witnessed the military supremacy of the British and French forces which had fought in Egypt, he was convinced of the need of a European-style, disciplined force.23 The main problem lay in the manpower of the new army; the recruitment of soldiers from the Caucasus and the Ottoman Empire was not a viable option due to his hostile relations with Istanbul after he had declared himself as the independent ruler of Egypt in 1811. Between 1820 and 1824, Muhammad ‘Ali recruited 20,000 men from Sudan, 17,000 of whom died in the training process.24 With few options left, conscription of the Egyptian peasantry commenced in 1822, the officer class was drawn from the Turko-Circassian elites which had supported his rise to power.25 His Nizam al-Jadid (New Organisation) was a large and costly venture, reaching a peak of 115,000 men in 1840, which constituted 12 per cent of the working-age population.26 Copts, by virtue of their status as dhimmi, were not conscripted into the army.27 As described by Lane, ‘the Copts enjoy an immunity for which they are much envied by most of the Muslims: they are not liable to be taken for military service’.28 Instead, Copts were obliged to pay the jizya tax.29 In the 1830s, three different rates were imposed on the community: the richer classes in Cairo and in other large towns paid thirty-six piasters each, the poorest nine piasters, while in the countryside, the jizya was levied on families rather than individuals.30 Given the financial burdens of military modernisation, Muhammad ‘Ali implemented an administrative and fiscal system to cope with the new policies. He began by creating six ministries dealing with foreign affairs, war, navy, finance, industry and education.31 Muhammad ‘Ali also divided Egypt into provinces, districts, and sub-districts, thus fostering the development of a highly centralised administration.32 Like the army, the administration was headed by Turko-Circassians whilst Arabs served in subordinate positions. To manage all of his newly implemented reforms, it was necessary to create an efficient but, more importantly, subservient bureaucracy to serve the state. 33 Both administrative and military reforms were paid for, in large part, through agriculture. In 1814, Muhammad ‘Ali abolished the\n\n18\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\nexisting system of tax farming and took direct control of land. 34 Furthermore, previously large land holdings had been registered as waqf, religious endowment lands, in order to avoid taxation. Muhammad ‘Ali scrutinised the misuse of this system, consequently turning many illegitimate claims of waqf into state properties.35 He also encouraged cultivation projects through tax concessions for peasants willing to cultivate waste land and help in the construction and repair of old canals and dikes in the Delta. The aim was to increase the production of essential crops including rice, sugar and most importantly cotton. 36 The re-orientation of Egypt’s economy towards the mass production of cotton was one of Muhammad ‘Ali’s most important achievements, as there was great demand by textile merchants in Britain. This guaranteed that Egypt, at least in the foreseeable future, had a steady means of income. By 1849, cotton accounted for 31 per cent of Egypt’s total exports. Revenue was also raised through the virtual monopoly over trade imports and exports, with Muhammad ‘Ali taking the profits made. In 1836, 95 per cent of exports and 40 per cent of imports were managed through the government. ‘Ali recognised that foreign trade would provide him with a large cash income, a policy which had been inherited from his predecessors.37 The Copts were able to carve out a niche for themselves during the modernisation programs, especially in the field of finance. Whilst many did not have the medical, educational or commercial skills of other Christian communities, such as the Syrians or Greeks, they did have certain professional skills useful to the new administration. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, many Copts were employed as accountants to large private landowners, land surveyors and tax collectors.38 The demand for Copts in these roles was kept up through a system whereby the same profession would be inherited from father to son. The strength of the Copts lay in the fact that their accountancy system was highly complex and unique to them. 39 Coptic boys would from a young age, go to locally run Christian schools to acquire the basic knowledge of reading, writing, geometry and mathematics. The latter two were felt to be particularly important and were greatly promoted as useful sciences; the proportion of fields and harvests that would be lost to the Nile’s annual flood could be calculated using basic\n\nRELIGION AND STATE-BUILDING\n\n19\n\ngeometry and mathematics coupled with the knowledge imparted to young Coptic boys from their fathers. In their teenage years, they would act as apprentices to accountants and land surveyors following in their fathers’ footsteps. 40 As a result of their specialisation, by the time Muhammad ‘Ali came to power Copts were in a better position to serve in their role as land surveyors than anyone else. Similarly, Copts performed well in roles such as tax collectors. The tax recording system used by Copts was considerably different from those of the Muslims in terms of style and content. 41 This ensured that they were in a unique position to serve the administration when Muhammad ‘Ali began his modernisation process, as only Copts educated in this form of collection started to be employed. Given the expenses of the modernisation program, Muhammad ‘Ali closely scrutinised tax collection and revenue. Mu‘allim Basilious Ghali was chief of the Coptic guild responsible for the collection of taxes throughout the country. A Mu‘allim, a title given to the registrar of taxes, presided in most villages throughout Egypt. As this post was opened to non-Muslims during the French occupation, Ghali co-operated closely with Muhammad ‘Ali and was thereafter considered to be his right hand man. 42 Some evidence also suggests that Ghali played a crucial role in recruiting Sudanese troops for the modernisation of the Egyptian army.43 The potential wealth derived from such a position was considerable as suggested by the fact that by 1846 Mu‘allim Ghali’s family owned a number of villages in the Delta, one of which had over 2,000 feddans of land.44 Closely attached to the question of modernisation of the state and bureaucracy was the issue of education. In order to achieve modernisation, and to have an efficient bureaucratic machine, it was necessary for Muhammad ‘Ali to undertake educational reforms which would supply the state with trained officers and administrators, establishing an indigenous educational system based on a European model. 45 ‘Ali began sending student missions to Europe from 1813 onwards. At first the majority of students were of Turkish-Circassian origin, and were sent specifically for the purpose of military training. The focus slowly began to shift in the mid-1820s when Muhammad ‘Ali also began to send future\n\n20\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\nadministrators, with the aim of utilising their knowledge upon their return and establishing specialised secondary schools with modern systems. Primary education, however, developed at a much slower pace, and was largely left to the traditional ‘ulama’.46 Despite Muhammad ‘Ali’s foresight in reforming the bureaucracy and military, he did not endeavour to link modern educational facilities with the traditional. It was not until 1867, under Isma‘il (1863– 1879), the grandson of Muhammad ‘Ali, that a plan was introduced to reform traditional schools.47 There were renewed efforts to expand state education, resulting in the reopening of the famous School of Languages and Administration which had been founded in 1835 but closed during the reign of ‘Abbas I in 1850. The Dar al‘ulum (Teachers College), was also established in 1872 to train Arabic teachers for instruction at primary and secondary school level. As a result, state expenditure on education increased from £6,000 to £75,000 annually, whilst education in most schools remained free.48 The impact of the educational policies implemented by ‘Ali and his successors on the Copts was two-fold: it encouraged the Coptic Church to adopt similar policies, leading to the creation of Coptic schools and the development of a Coptic intelligentsia. However, educational policies implemented by the state also had the effect of slowly removing Copts from the traditional roles that they played in land-surveying and accountancy. The newly-created specialised schools introduced new modernised forms of surveying and accountancy, which incrementally led to the replacement of Copts by graduates of the new institutions. Under Muhammad ‘Ali’s successors, there was also a change in personal status laws; Khedive Sa‘id (1854–1863, Muhammad ‘Ali’s son who succeeded ‘Abbas I (1849–1854), began drafting Copts, as well as Muslims, into the army in 1856. As suggested above, Copts had previously been exempt from serving in the army in return for paying the Jizya tax.49 In 1854, Khedive Sa‘id renounced his claim to LE 15,000 of Jizya that was due from the Copts.50 The abolition of the Jizya in 1855 and the drafting of non-Muslims in 1856 into the army was in line with the Ottoman Hatt-i Humayun, the imperial edict which confirmed provisions of religious equality within the Ottoman Empire.51 However, the abolition of the Jizya tax and the enforcement of conscription was not favoured by many\n\nRELIGION AND STATE-BUILDING\n\n21\n\nCopts. In Asyut for example, a largely Christian city in Upper Egypt, there were complaints that all men had been conscripted and that as a result there were no men available to support their families. The situation became so unbearable that the Coptic patriarch intervened with the government in order to have the Copts exempted from military service. This highlighted the continued role of the Church in millat affairs during the nineteenth century despite Muhammad ‘Ali’s attempts to create a more inclusive and consolidated position for himself and his successors in Egypt.52 A Renaissance in the Coptic Community The modernisation policies of Muhammad ‘Ali and his successors helped redefine the boundaries of identity in Egypt bringing nonMuslim communities, and Copts in particular, into the sphere of an emerging centralised state. ‘Ali and his successors’ conception of identity was based on a collective solidarity and groupness which linked various people within Egypt by dismissing the notion of a fundamental and abiding homogeny.53 In contrast, Coptic communal identities remained strongly cemented by religious ties despite the partial integration of certain Copts with professional skills into the new state structures. Under the reign of ‘Abbas I (1849–1854), attempts were made by the Patriarch to reform the Coptic clergy and institutions. These attempts were partly in response to Muhammad ‘Ali’s modernisation policies, and partly as a reaction to the external threats posed by Christian missionaries. The reforms implemented were inward looking in nature, reinforcing the strong communal ethos which bound the community.\n\nThe Beginning of ‘Islah’\n\nThe literature on the Copts, written by both religious members of the Coptic community and Egyptian historians, has described the mid-nineteenth century as an age of reform or islah.54 This is in large part due to the efforts of Pope Kyrillos IV (1854–1861), also known as Abu Islah or the ‘father of reform’. 55 Abu Islah has been revered as the foremost important figure in modern Coptic history, as he attempted to rescue the Church from its perceived decadence,\n\n22\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\ncharacterised by illiteracy, maladministration and stagnation. In particular, two Copts who had been students of the patriarch wrote extensively on Abu Islah’s reign and the policies he implemented, highlighting his importance as a reformer even during his own lifetime.56 Abu Islah has therefore been portrayed as the leader of the Coptic nahdah, or renaissance, and as the forerunner to Kyrillos VI (1959–1971), who is considered to have promoted Al-nahdah althaaniyah (the second renaissance), in the Nasser period. The concepts of Al-nahdah and al-islah are used interchangeably in Arabic historical literature to discuss the period.57 The policies implemented by Abu Islah before and during his reign as patriarch were highly successful. In particular, those firstly implemented in the diwan and ecclesiastical reforms, second, in relation to iconography and third, with regard to lay educational changes. He began in 1854 by establishing an administrative system for the diwan of the patriarchate in order to centralise and streamline the supervision of church affairs. This included two branches, the first of which was concerned with the legal affairs related to the personal status laws of the millat, including marriages and deaths. The second meanwhile, dealt with reforming the ecclesiastical structures, focussing on the clergy who had long been accused of negligence in their religious duties. This took the form of a disciplinary approach, aimed at regulating the behaviour, education and dogmatic practices of the Coptic clergy, and was a reflection of their poor backgrounds and education, as the majority of clergy came from the lower classes of the community.58 The ignorance of the clergy is perhaps best highlighted through the observations of a foreign traveller, who as early as 1799 noted: [T]hey keep their books, written in the Cophtic [sic.] language, which is compounded from a mixture of the Greek and the remains of the ancient Egyptian. Though they never read them; though they let them lie in heaps upon the ground, gnawed by insects, and mouldering in dust; they are not to be prevailed upon to part with them.59 Indeed, in another account by one of Abu Islah’s biographers, it is stated that the poverty of the clergy was a major cause of their\n\nRELIGION AND STATE-BUILDING\n\n23\n\nmisuse of church property. Awqaf provided the Church with extensive funds obtained from rents of lands and were subject to serious exploitation by their administrators, usually monks or bishops. The clergy were also reported to have sold their services, through performing blessing ceremonies in exchange for payment of fees.60 Similarly, Lane in the mid-nineteenth century, reported that: ‘[T]he priests and monks in Cairo are seen every day begging, and asking the loan of money, which they never repay, at the houses of their parishioners and other acquaintances, and procuring brandy, if possible, wherever they call.’61 In order to alleviate clerical financial constraints, Abu Islah introduced a system whereby priests would receive a fixed salary rather than rely on the alms donated by their parishioners. These salaries came partly from the revenue collected at Sunday mass. 62 Along with the clergy, deacons were also given attention, particularly those showing spiritual inclinations. Abu Islah provided them with appropriate clothing and instruction in Coptic chanting, as well as, education in church dogma, and rudimentary Coptic language classes.63 Instruction was provided for the clergy and deacons through the creation of ecclesiastical training schools, and in 1849, as head of St Anthony’s monastery, Abu Islah opened a school on a farm located in the area of Bush.64 The school was primarily aimed at the monks in the monastery, but later took on local children; it also opened a small library at the same site, employing a local Muslim Shaykh to teach the monks Arabic grammar.65 In 1854, when he became patriarch, Abu Islah required all the clergy based in Cairo to attend weekly classes at the Patriarchate, where theological education, along with basic literacy skills, were taught. 66 In order to facilitate many of the educational reforms for the clergy, there was a need for greater dissemination of the tenets and beliefs of the Coptic Church. This was greatly assisted by the purchase of the first private printing press in Egypt which was brought from Austria by Abu Islah and was received with great ceremony in 1859 at Bush, near the St Anthony Monastery. 67 The introduction of the printing press helped to popularise religious discourse and enabled debate to flourish, particularly as this had previously been restricted to those with access to old manuscripts in the monasteries. Abu Islah also secured permission from Khedive Sa‘id I to have Coptic deacons\n\n24\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\nbe trained in the art of printing at the old government Bulaq printing press.68 This began with the publication of Coptic religious tracts and grammar books, finding popular support in many of the newly founded libraries, including the expansion of the one founded at Bush.69 Thus, the creation of two administrative units under patriarchal control, personal status codes and ecclesiastical reforms, solidified Abu Islah’s centralisation in much the same way as Muhammad ‘Ali and his successors.70 Another of Abu Islah’s major reforms addressed the culture of iconography, which he vehemently and adamantly opposed. Abu Islah regarded iconography, which played a large role in Coptic belief, as a form of idolatry and superstition; this, he believed, led to the degradation of the spiritual values of the Coptic Church. 71 Whilst rebuilding the St Mark’s cathedral in the Azbakiyyah district of Cairo, Abu Islah declared that no sacred pictures would be allowed in the new building: ‘Behold these wooden pictures you used to honour and even worship! They can neither avail nor harm you. God alone should be adored!’ 72 The culmination of this statement was a bonfire in both Cairo and Asyut, where relics were burnt much to the amusement of foreign observers who viewed Coptic iconography with distain. As reported by Mrs Butcher, who lived in Egypt: We should be inclined to regret this action of Cyril’s [Kyrillos] if it seemed at all likely that any works of art had perished in his great object-lesson. But the art of painting had become almost extinct since the Ottoman conquest, and the pictures which had been executed for Mark’s Cathedral were probably even worse daubs than those which since Cyril’s time have been placed in the Cathedral which he built.73 The reformist message of Abu Islah was clear: the new approach focused on the enlightenment of the clergy through education, in an attempt to move away from what he believed were signs of superstition and ‘backwardness’. Abu Islah’s attitude towards iconography and superstition was progressive and ‘modernist’, the inspiration of which probably had its roots in the influence of Presbyterian missionaries who, particularly in Upper Egypt,\n\nRELIGION AND STATE-BUILDING\n\n25\n\ndeclared themselves as enemies of Catholic iconography and lavishness.\n\nFigure 1 Abu Islah (1853–1861).\n\nThirdly, Abu Islah also implemented educational reforms that were closely linked to the development of state education under Muhammad ‘Ali and his successors. In the Azbakiyyah district of Cairo in 1853, he set up the first of several ‘Great Coptic Schools’,\n\n26\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\nor Madrasat al-Aqbat al-Kubra, also known as the Coptic Patriarchal College. Prior to the creation of the schools, Copts had followed a very similar pattern of preliminary education to Muslim children at the local kuttab, where often blind teachers, ‘urfan, taught religious studies and basic literacy skills in Arabic to young boys. 74 There is evidence from western travellers that prior to the reforms, it was not unheard of for ‘Copts and Muslims to be taught side by side, where they mastered religion, good manners, to read and write Arabic and Coptic’.75 Following the creation of the Great Coptic Schools, Abu Islah continued the tradition of close interaction between Muslim and Coptic students by encouraging religious diversity. Coptic religious historian Mattewos has claimed that the Great Coptic Schools were the first civil union between Copts and Muslims in free non-governmental education.76 Abu Islah’s vision brought Copts more closely in line with the new agenda of modernisation and centralisation pursued by Muhammad ‘Ali’s dynasty. The schools were established using Coptic funds, which Abu Islah raised from the community, and later due to their success, were given subsidies and direct grants from the Khedival government in the form of land, farms and money. 77 Land was granted in the Al-Wadi region of the Sharqiyyah governate to help cover expenses incurred in the Schools. 78 The schools taught free of charge a number of European languages including French, English and Italian as well as Arabic and Turkish.79 Aside from languages, a range of subjects were taught including chanting, mathematics, history, geography and logic. The teachers appointed were both foreign and Egyptian, and took charge of all subjects, whilst the ‘urfan and heads of the old kuttabs, were given compensation in the form of a pension by the Church following their vocal opposition to the creation of the new schools. 80 The first of these new schools, which contained both a primary and secondary school opened in 1855 and had 150 students enrolled in it.81 Another primary school for girls was established in Harit alSaqqayin in Cairo.82 By the mid-1870s, this school had over 243 students and 18 teachers.83 These Great Coptic Schools, which were all initially concentrated in Cairo close to the old Coptic kuttab, graduated some of the most influential Copts that were to play roles in Egyptian history in\n\nRELIGION AND STATE-BUILDING\n\n27\n\nfollowing years; Boutros Ghali Pasha (1846–1910), the future Egyptian Prime Minister assassinated in 1910; Mikhail ‘Abd alSayyid (1830–1914), the founder of the Coptic newspaper AlWatan; and Mikhail Sharubim (1853–1912), a historian.84 The schools also graduated two future Muslim Prime Ministers, Abdel Khalek Sarwat, who served in 1922 and 1927–28, and Hussein Rushdi, Prime Minister between 1914 and 1919.85 Upon graduation students took a public state exam which allowed them to pursue higher education in the state institutions first created by Muhammad ‘Ali.86 The success of the Great Coptic Schools in the capital led to the establishment of more schools outside Cairo: the first in the province of Mansura, and the second in Bush, near St. Anthony’s Monastery. By the time Abu Islah died in 1861, there were a total of seven Great Coptic Schools in Egypt, including two for girls.87 Under his successor, Pope Demetrius (1861–1870), twenty-three additional Coptic schools were built; eighteen in Cairo, two in Alexandria, two in Asyut and one in Giza.88 All these educational institutions had boarding arrangements for those students who came from the provinces. Abu Islah’s reform policies in administration, centralisation and education of the Coptic community clearly reflected his modernist nature, complementing the reform programs implemented by Muhammad ‘Ali and his successors in the state. The fear of losing consolidation over the community led to a series of comprehensive reforms aimed at solidifying and centralising the community against the external perceived threats posed by missionaries.\n\nMissionary Activity\n\nThe role of Christian missionaries in Egypt provides evidence as to the impetus behind some of the reforms implemented by Abu Islah and his successors in the period up to the British occupation of 1882. The main thrust of the activities carried out by the missionaries came under the rubric of the promotion of education. Two different missionary societies were active in Egypt and had a sizable impact on subsequent Coptic reforms implemented by the hierarchy of the Church.\n\n28\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\nThe Church Missionary Society (CMS) led one of the first waves of British missionary activity in Egypt in the nineteenth century. The CMS began meeting informally in April 1799 in London, but it was not until 1812 that the ‘The Church Missionary Society for Africa and the East’ was formally established. 89 In 1799, the plans of the Church Missionary Society focussed primarily on Africa, where its most evident achievements were made in the following years.90 West Asia which included Egypt, did not feature in the agenda of the CMS until 1815 when a Mediterranean Mission was set up in Malta and which later extended to Egypt and Palestine.91 Soon after the establishment of the Mediterranean Mission, a printing press was started and operated in conjunction with the Religious Tract Society and the British and Foreign Bible Society. The aim was to print and stock Christian scriptures in the liturgical languages of the Eastern Churches and in Arabic with a view to expanding missionary activities.92 In charge of this process was Rev. William Jowett, who moved to Constantinople in 1816.93 Rev. Jowett visited Egypt in 1818 to enquire about the state of the Egyptian Coptic Church and to discuss with Pope Boutros VII (1809–1852) the possibility of the Mission assisting the Church. 94 In 1825, after several contacts with the Coptic clergy and limited results, the CMS established a branch in Egypt. As the new society could not find any English missionaries, the first who served in Egypt, were neither Anglican nor English, but Lutherans from Germany.95 From the outset the society did not intend on proselytising amongst Copts, and instead sought to strengthen the structures of the Church. It was hoped that by raising the educational standards of both the Coptic clergy and lay community the Copts would be able to flourish in a predominately Muslim state.96 While many of the early CMS missionaries frowned upon the ancient rituals, dogmatic practices and customs of the Orthodox Coptic Church, viewing them with oriental disdain, the strengthening of the Church was necessary in order to achieve the longer term aim of converting Muslims.97 During the 1820s and 1830s the missionaries began studying Arabic and established their headquarters in a Coptic district of Old Cairo, with the hope of fostering good relations. It seems that the local Copts were initially wary of the intentions of\n\nRELIGION AND STATE-BUILDING\n\n29\n\nthe CMS, although the missionaries were well received by the Patriarch on more than one occasion. 98 In Cairo missionary work focused primarily on the provision of educational services, and beginning with lay communal education, a number of schools were opened. In 1828–9 only five Coptic and four Greek children attended one of the newly-established CMS Schools in Cairo, the vast majority of the remainder being Catholics and Maronites. However, by 1834 there were a greater number of Coptic children in attendance along with a few Muslim boys. In the same year, a school for girls was opened, as well as a boarding school for boys. Further evidence of the early success of the CMS was that, by 1839–40, six classes on the Holy Scriptures were held per week for Copts throughout the city.99 In 1842–3, the CMS decided to turn to the educational and religious training of ecclesiasts. A religious seminary was established, highlighting the CMS policy of strengthening the Church. It was hoped that a new, enlightened ‘modern’ clergy would become vehicles for reform in the Coptic Church, encouraging the expansion of Christianity in both Egypt and the wider region.100 Within two years, there were fifteen pupils in the institution, but the poor quality of students raised concerns for the missionaries. Leider, one of the original five missionaries, commented that, ‘with few exceptions, [the recruits] have proved to be only the scum of the Church’, concluding that ‘it is my opinion, on account of these cases, that this institution, as it is, is not worth the great expenses to which the society is subject’. 101 Despite this, however, the seminary graduated a number of Coptic priests, including a future bishop. The impact of lay and ecclesiastical educational programs carried out by the CMS between 1825 and 1882 had mixed results on the Coptic community. Commenting in 1850, Bishop Gobat, who had been amongst the first missionaries in Egypt, gave his estimation of the impact of the CMS on the Copts: Besides the dissemination of the word of God and other good books in all parts of Egypt, and the scriptural though imperfect education of youth, the results of the Mission are the conversion of a few individuals, some of whom have died\n\n30\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\nin the faith, a few enlightened young men dispersed through Egypt while many members of the different communities have been led to doubt the truth of their superstition and traditions. Yet upon the whole it must be confessed, that the Egyptian Mission has not had the success which might have been expected.102 On the other hand, there is considerable historical debate which suggests that the CMS’s greatest impact was on Abu Islah himself, who was rumoured to have been a student at one of the schools established by the CMS. Following the emergence of missionary activity in Egypt, there was a growth in the publication of Western travel literature, diaries and autobiographies. These observers of the Copts believed that the notion and process of modernity was a ‘gift’ bestowed upon indigenous societies by missionaries and by the British forces that later occupied Egypt in 1882. The making of a ‘modern’ society rested on western influence and experience. 103 Mrs Butcher, a British resident living in Egypt who epitomised this perspective commented that: ‘Mr Leider [of the CMS] would have been encouraged to persevere had he known that though none of his pupils were ordained priests, as he had hoped, his school produced in course of time the Patriarch known as Cyril [Kyrillos] the Reformer.’104 It could therefore be argued that Abu Islah was influenced not only by the process of modernisation and education as promoted by both Muhammad ‘Ali and his successors through state practices, but also through missionary activity. On the other hand, Coptic writer Tawfiq Iskarius wrote that it was highly unlikely that Abu Islah came into contact with missionaries, especially considering Abu Islah did not achieve a level of perfection in his educational studies until well after entering a monastery at the age of 21.105 Several other missionary groups established themselves in Egypt in the mid-nineteenth century. The most important, in terms of impact on the Copts, was the United Presbyterian Church of North America. The American Mission was founded in 1854 with the arrival of Rev. Thomas McCague and his wife from the US, and the Rev. James Barnett, detached from the Mission in Syria; it was later reinforced by the arrival of Rev. Gulian Lansing in 1857. 106 Like\n\nRELIGION AND STATE-BUILDING\n\n31\n\nthe CMS, the activity of the mission was focussed on the dissemination of education resulting in the establishment of schools for teaching and training, and the publication and distribution of scriptures. However, in contrast to the CMS, the Presbyterians promoted the conversion to Protestantism from among the Copts. It has been claimed by Arthur Fowler, a British observer in Egypt, that the American Missionaries wanted to establish an independent Presbyterian Church in Egypt. 107 The American Presbyterians became extremely active in creating a series of modern schools throughout Egypt which rivalled the traditional Coptic kuttab. In the autumn of 1855, the Mission opened a boy’s school, with the aim of promoting Sabbath services.108 In Lower Egypt, the Presbyterian 1863 Annual report mentioned the existence of a boys’ school and a girls’ school in Alexandria, and a separate boys’ and girls’ school in the Azbikkiyah district of Cairo, which was in addition to a further girls’ school in the district of Harit al-Saqqain of Cairo.109 By 1865 it was clear that the educational aspect of the Presbyterian mission was focussing on Upper Egypt, where twelve percent of the population, and a quarter of the inhabitants of the city of Asyut, were Copts.110 In March 1865, a boys’ school was established in Asyut, with only seven students; however, by the end of the year its students had expanded tenfold, and a girls’ school soon followed.111 Women, and girls in particular, were regarded as vital bearers of the modernisers’ message.112 Historian Paul Sedra argues that the establishment of girls’ schools were frequently more important than those of boys’ schools in such missionary projects. In ordering family life, the Presbyterians sought to control the environment within which children were raised. The schools were regarded as a means of rendering young girls ‘industrious’ and ‘disciplined’ through instilling such values at the core of the Egyptian home. This policy of educating girls was also promoted by Abu Islah, and then later by his successors who frequently commented that prospective mothers were the cultivators of Coptic children. Similarly, Pope Demetrius (1861–70), Abu Islah’s successor, also responded to the educational activities of the Presbyterians. In particular, the role played by the missions in Asyut, Upper Egypt,\n\n32\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\nled Demetrius to establish a rival modern school in the city in 1862. The school was funded by rich local Copts, and supported by the Khedive in the form of land donation.113 This school was modelled on Abu Islah’s Great Coptic Schools, which Demetrius continued to expand.114 In 1862, Demetrius employed a Copt who had received his education in a Presbyterian missionary school as headmaster for the new school in Asyut. Indeed, in an annual report published by the Presbyterian Mission, it was noted that the newly established patriarchal school used ‘the same books in school that we use in ours and pursues the same course of study that we do’, solidifying the link between missionary education and the impact on Coptic reforms. 115 The establishment of the school also reflected Demetrius’ frustration with Presbyterian attempts at promoting Protestantism in Egypt at the expense of Coptic Orthodox Christianity, and in particular in Upper Egypt, which had a large Christian population. This culminated in the persecution of the Presbyterian missionaries in Asyut in 1867. This also had the tacit support from the government who feared that foreign intervention in Egypt would undermine Khedive Isma‘il’s control: Isma‘il, the reigning Khedive, was far-sighted enough to appreciate that the standards which the American missionaries were setting up would directly, or indirectly, result in holding up to criticism and condemnation of his unjust and tyrannical treatment of his ignorant and patient subjects. 116 Evangelical teaching had spread exponentially among Coptic monks who were seen throughout Asyut reading the new Arabic translation of the Bible promoted by the missionaries. Indeed, Watson argues that the Patriarch found his own brother reading the new version of the Bible. Demetrius subsequently arranged an apostolic tour among the churches of Upper Egypt, making no secret of his mission: the suppression of what was now regarded as Protestant heresy. He claimed that the viceroy and Khedive had conferred upon him the right to condemn to the galleys all those who adhered to the Protestant faith, or to seize their children for the army.117\n\nRELIGION AND STATE-BUILDING\n\n33\n\nWhat followed has since been termed the Coptic persecution of the Protestants. As an example of the actions carried out, there is evidence that Demetrius summoned a Coptic priest of Beni Aleig in Upper Egypt, whose brother had been a student at one of the missions’ theological schools, and accused him of preaching Protestant heresy at Sunday Mass. It was arranged that the priest would be severely beaten by soldiers, and degraded of his priesthood on account of his brother’s actions. 118 Demetrius, with the assistance of the state, closed all mission day-schools, as well as a theological seminary which had recently been opened. Protestant school books were collected and burnt in a public bonfire. Persecution and opposition to the Presbyterian Church was not maintained once it became clear that only an extremely small number of Copts had converted.119 Nonetheless, the episode highlights that Demetrius feared that the expansion of the Presbyterian missions in Upper Egypt signified a growing, strengthened, educated Coptic community in Protestant doctrine, which could have a detrimental effect on the ecclesiastical structures of the Church.\n\nThe Formation of a ‘Majlis al-Milli’ (Coptic Community Council)\n\nThe issue of the Hatt-i Humayun in 1856 by the Egyptian government, a secular decree which encouraged equality, constitutionalism and representation, assisted the process of reform and modernisation.120 One of the results of this decree was the development of community councils within each millat to deal with matters concerning personal status, including marriage, divorce and inheritance, as well as the administration of waqf lands donated to the Church for ecclesiastical and charitable purposes.121 The actual creation of a Coptic community council, did not come into full fruition until 1874, and was later suspended until 1883. When the council did function, however, it embodied a shift in communal representation from clerical autonomy to a lay educated class, a process which had its foundations in Abu Islah’s educational reforms, and educational policies implemented by the government. Following Pope Demetrius’ death in 1870, the affairs of the community were entrusted to Murqus, the bishop of the province\n\n34\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\nof Al-Beheirah, who acted as the Vicar-General of the Church.122 Bishop Murqus chose a number of notables to assist him in the administration of the financial affairs of the community, and thus the nucleus of the first Coptic community council was created. The notables chosen to undertake the task were Barsum Girgis Bey, Yaqub Nakhla Rufila Bey, Gundi Yusuf al-Qasabi Bey, ‘Azia Manqariyus and Mikhail Habashi.123 Indeed, two of the members of the community council had been pupils at Abu Islah’s Great Coptic School, clearly solidifying the link between a new generation of Coptic notable laymen and the former patriarch’s reforms. 124 With the assistance of Bishop Murqus and the approval of some of the clergy, the decision was made to formalise the arrangement in the shape of a community council, or Majlis al-Milli, in 1874.125 According to Girgis Filuthawus ‘Awad (1867–1955), a progressive cleric and critic of many conservative Coptic traditions, the establishment of the council had biblical sanction and as a result also had his full support. 126 Indeed, Canon Law and the writings of Ibn al-‘Assal, the thirteenth century Coptic jurist, were used to justify the establishment of a Majlis al-Milli with specialised laymen providing advice and practical knowledge in the fields of law, medicine and accounting, which would benefit the community. A similar question arose in the medieval period in the Roman Catholic Church, with the need to define the scope of its political institutions. Canon lawyers used the notion of ‘corporation’ to define the arrangements and workings of ecclesiastical organisations within the Church. This corporation in Roman Law was a partnership between a body and a legal personality, and was distinct from the character who set it up such as the pope; it was a persona ficta, which as such, could assume legal rights and obligations, engage in litigation, enter into obligations and hold property. The most important question that arose in the dispute in the 14th and 15th centuries for the Roman Catholic Church, therefore, was who had the right to act on behalf of the corporation. For the Papalists, the view was that the pope alone possessed this authority; the conciliar party, on the other hand, argued a council of the Church, composed of representatives of the Church from different factions, should hold authority: ‘The\n\nRELIGION AND STATE-BUILDING\n\n35\n\nconcept of corporation thus came to involve two notions, the notion of representation and the notion of council.’127 This debate concerning the power balance in the Coptic community was characterised by the creation of the Majlis al-Milli in the late nineteenth century. The basic issue was the legitimisation of the role of the layman in religious terms. Coptic religious historian Iris Habib al-Misri (1910–1994) highlights the concerns that were prevalent regarding the new class of laymen and their roles within the Church, commenting that it was necessary, with the creation of the Majlis, to place safeguards: ‘there is a big difference between representation that is built on love and mutual respect, and between representation of the Church carried out unilaterally by civil lay decisions’.128 According to the 1874 constitution, the twelve lay members and twelve deputies of the Majlis were to be elected by general suffrage every five years and were to supervise the financial and civil affairs of the community.129 This would include waqf, schools, benevolent societies, affairs of personal status and other secular functions, which would relieve the clergy and patriarch of worldly functions and transfer the power balance to the laity. 130 Whilst all the bishops informally agreed upon this arrangement in 1873, the notables who had supported the project were keen to have the Majlis al-Milli recognised by the government. This was in part a reaction to other members of the clergy, whose power had remained hitherto unchallenged. With the support of Gad Shiha, a leading Copt in government, and Boutros Ghali Pasha (1846– 1910), a rising politician, the Khedive Isma‘il was petitioned in February 1874.131 The petition called for the recognition of the Majlis al-Milli, which would consist of twelve members and twelve deputies, to meet under the chairmanship of the patriarch. On 15 th February 1874, a Khedival decree was issued and the council was formed.132 There is considerable controversy surrounding the appointment of Pope Kyrillos V in 1874, and his relationship with the creation of the Majlis, especially because the seat of the patriarchy had been empty since the death of Demetrius in 1870, and only temporarily covered by Bishop Murqus. Historian Samir Seikaly has correctly noted that, as Coptic sources are contradictory, it is very difficult to determine whether the creation of the Majlis al-Milli in 1874\n\n36\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\naffected the election of Kyrillos V to the patriarchy in the same year.133 There is some evidence to suggest that the state interfered in Coptic community affairs, and that Khedive Isma‘il (1863–1879) arbitrated in the long-standing dispute concerning the succession of the patriarch. Isma‘il commissioned the Governor of Beheirah to bring Kyrillos V to Cairo, resulting in his consecration as patriarch in 1874.134 The significance of these events, despite the scanty evidence, is that the state may have directly, for the first time in modern Egyptian history, intervened in the selection of the Coptic patriarch, in an attempt to reassert the legitimacy and authority of the community following the four year absence of a religious leader. Supporters of reform, on the other hand, maintain that Kyrillos V was elected to his position after he promised several members of the council that he would work with them on the understanding that they would have his vote.135 Indeed, in the first years of the existence of the Majlis al-Milli, there is evidence of co-operation between the laity and clergy as suggested by the creation of a girls’ school in the governate of Sharqiyyah in 1874.136 In 1875, Kyrillos V approved the creation of a theological college, which enrolled monks and priests so that they should receive a holistic education in the history, liturgy and dogma of the Coptic Church. 137 This interest in spiritual education was promoted further in the form of publications in religious literature, as well as personal tours to monasteries to promote literacy. Kyrillos also supported building a series of monasteries close to Cairo which had fallen into disrepair.138 The relationship between the new council and patriarch did not remain agreeable for long, however. By 1875, there was already evidence of what contemporary western observers, such as Mrs Butcher, termed the ‘dark’ and zealous clergy, solidifying traditional western perceptions of Oriental despotism. 139 According to her, the bishops managed to persuade Kyrillos that he should possess absolute power, and not govern in union with any councils.140 The Council responded to this threat by acting impatiently, demanding their unequivocal right to deal with all civil and financial affairs. 141 The result of the tension was dramatic, resulting in the retraction of reform policies on the part of the patriarch beginning with the closure of the theological college created that year. 142 Furthermore,\n\nRELIGION AND STATE-BUILDING\n\n37\n\nKyrillos V subsequently refused to attend any council meetings or appoint a deputy, and for seven years the council was unable to function.143 Between 1874 and 1883, Kyrillos V was left to govern the Church in the traditional, autocratic manner. This period has been described by some Coptic commentators such as the historian and journalist ‘Abd al-Sayyid, as the end of the first nahdah, which had started with Abu Islah.144 In this period, two attempts were made to re-establish the Majlis al-Milli through elections, but these proved unsuccessful highlighting the fiery struggle for control and authority over the Coptic Church. 145 The establishment of the Majlis al-Milli, had created a schism between traditional ecclesiastical views of authority within the Church and the lay reformers who were at the head of the council. This process would lead to factionalism inside the Coptic community and the beginning of a debate that would continue until the mid-twentieth century.\n\n2 THE MAKING OF NEW NATIONAL IDENTITIES (1882–1919)\n\nThe Impact of the British Occupation In September 1882, British troops defeated the forces led by Ahmad ‘Urabi, a colonel in the Egyptian army, who had staged a revolt against the Khedival regime at the Battle of Tel al-Kebir.1 Britain’s two main motivations behind its subsequent occupation of Egypt revolved around the security of the Suez Canal and the gold standard.2 In the aftermath however, Britain realised that her evacuation from Egypt could only be successfully carried out after a general reconstruction of the Egyptian administration. 3 This resulted in a process which saw the imposition of institutions and methods imported from India on existing Egyptian government structures.4 The general administrative changes implemented focussed on finance, education and bureaucracy, all of which ultimately had an effect on the Copts. Lord Cromer (1841–1917), who had been British controller of Egypt since 1879, became Consul-General in 1883. His main role was the supervision of all administrative, financial and political changes to be implemented in Egypt, most of which was to be put under direct British control. In the Egyptian army for instance, British officers were promoted to high positions. This included the transfer of twenty-five newly trained officers to Egypt, who would in later years follow distinguished military careers in Africa and the Middle East.5 All higher staff positions were reserved for British officers, while only half the commanders in the infantry and cavalry battalions were Egyptians; these were the highest ranks that an\n\n40\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\nEgyptian officer could aspire to during the early years of the occupation.6 British advisors were also appointed to Egyptian ministries, their main role was the management of differing aspects of policy. Beginning in 1883, the advisors took control over the Ministry of Public Works, followed by Justice in 1891, Interior in 1894 and Education in 1906. The nucleus of British administrative reforms however, lay in the field of finance, which was the overriding issue of importance in the first decade following 1882. Prior to the occupation, under Khedive Isma‘il (1863–79), the precarious financial economy of Egypt had come to a head; the process of modernisation which had begun under Muhammad ‘Ali had wavered with limited success in areas such as industry, while the construction of the Suez Canal proved costly.7 The continuous borrowing from foreign financiers had led to bankruptcy in 1875– 76, and external intervention instigated by British and French investors who had a considerable share in the Egyptian economy, resulted in dual financial control. In 1876, the Caisse de la Dette Publique was set up in order to supervise the Egyptian budget and economy, and to ensure that share holders were paid. 8 Due to the involvement of the Ottoman Sultan, Khedive Isma‘il’s lack of cooperation with the Caisse led to his demise in 1879 at the hands of the British; Tawfiq, Isma‘il’s son, was instated as Khedive in 1879. Isma‘il had left Egypt with a debt that totalled £100,000,000, the payment of which consumed nearly two thirds of the Egyptian budget in 1883. Ten years later, 40 per cent of Egypt’s annual budget was still being set aside for debt re-payments.9 The convention which regulated Egypt’s finances was renegotiated in 1885, with more money put aside for the administrative needs of Egyptian society, and the payments of debt were reduced.10 The most important British advisor to Egypt was Alfred Milner (1854– 1925), the Under-Secretary of Finance, who was entitled to a seat in the Council of Ministers and formed the main connection between the Egyptian government and Lord Cromer. Indeed, it was claimed that the British financial advisor wielded more power than that of any other English official, barring Cromer. As part of the occupation, over 1,300 British assistants were brought to Egypt in\n\nTHE MAKING OF NEW NATIONAL IDENTITIES\n\n41\n\ntotal, taking roles that had previously been occupied by Egyptians at a fraction of the cost.11 Another crucial area of British administration was education. 12 Here, there was a conscious effort to avoid the mishaps of the British-led Indian education system, which was not considered to be practical enough. Cromer, in particular, was keen to promote education to run concurrently with the modernisation that was taking place in the country. 13 Thus mass education was, according to Cromer, to be rudimentary, and should consist of ‘the three R’s in the vernacular language and nothing more!’14 Until 1906, there were only three government run secondary schools in the Egypt, turning out less than one-hundred graduates a year in a country of eleven million inhabitants. 15 Due to the financial constraints facing the bankrupt Khedive Isma‘il, state expenditure on education had reached an all time low in the years 1877–78. Total expenditure for all levels of state education was LE 29,000, this was despite the fact that education had been at the forefront of early khedival modernisation policies. Under dual control, expenditure was raised to LE 70,000 although the budget during the early years of British occupation remained tight. 16 It was not until 1890 that the financial department found itself in a position to increase the sum of money spent by the state to LE 81,000.17 By 1906, this had dramatically increased to LE 305,000, with estimates for 1908 reaching LE 450,000.18 While the British were keen to promote greater education, this was stunted in the early years of the occupation by a lack of funds. A link between the education system and the bureaucracy was also formalised during the occupation: the British keenly promoted education in order to assist the modernisation of the state and fill vacant bureaucratic jobs. The Civil Service was divided into two ranks, as Egyptians increasingly regarded education as a stepping stone to a secure government position. By the early twentieth century graduates demanding government jobs exceeded the numbers available. As a result, educational requirements for government employment were steadily raised leading to a reorganisation of the structure. 19 In 1905, a decree stipulated that after 1909 the higher rank of the Civil Service was only open to those with secondary certificates; they would have a starting wage\n\n42\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\nof LE 8 a month and no ceiling wage on advancement. Those with a primary education on the other hand, would merely be admitted into the lower Civil Service and could expect to earn LE 4 a month with a ceiling wage peaking at LE 10.20 This would ensure that those working in the bureaucracy would meet certain standards, solidifying the link between education, administration and modernisation.\n\nThe Coptic Question\n\nThe policies implemented by the British administration, vis-à-vis what they increasingly referred to as ‘Egyptian minorities’, are subject to controversy. The Egyptian sociologist and historian Saad Eddin Ibrahim has argued that the British government followed a policy of ‘divide and rule’ whereby preferential treatment was given to minorities in order to secure their support against the majority Muslim population.21 Conversely, historian Sana Hasan has argued that the concept of divide and rule is flawed. Her main argument is that, unlike India, where the sizable ethnic and religious divisions had been used as a means of checking the emergence of a unified opposition to British rule, the Coptic population was too small to be worthy of British considerations, and consequently difficult to manipulate.22 Further in support of Hasan’s argument, the Copts were not concentrated in any specific area, nor did they form the majority of the population in any one province. Whilst Hasan is correct to point out that the Copts were not a significant proportion of the population if compared to Muslims in India, the British government did follow a two-tiered policy of divide and rule, particularly in the period up to the First World War. Firstly, it sought to weaken communal solidarity by exploiting divisions between members of the religious establishment and laymen. This was done through attempts to co-opt priests and notables with reformist tendencies and political clout, who were welcomed by the British Residency; Coptic laymen, such as Boutros Ghali Pasha, played an important role in the formation of the Majlis al-Milli, and forged close ties with the British. Secondly, the British colonial administration sought to isolate the Copts through preferential treatment in the attainment of bureaucratic and state jobs.\n\nTHE MAKING OF NEW NATIONAL IDENTITIES\n\n43\n\nBritish-Coptic relations were varied in character during the period of the British occupation. The Coptic writer Ramzi Tadrus represented many Coptic notables who had occupied a position in the state administration when he wrote in 1911 what the British occupation had brought with it: Positive and stabilising effects on the security of Egypt as well as a revival which would promote progress, especially as [Egypt] had become devoid of thought and was ignorant and full of corruption and without order.23 Cromer, the British High Commissioner, did not generally trust the Copts, and saw them as opportunists who directed their sympathies according to the situation. ‘He [the Copt] wished to pose both as Anglophobe and as an Anglophile according to the requirement of the audience’.24 In his book, Modern Egypt published in 1908, Cromer described the Copts as a backward community. To him, the Copt was unalterable in his nature because he was an Oriental: ‘The Eastern Church, was, like the East, stationary and immutable; the Western, like the West, progressive and flexible’.25 In this sense, he saw no difference between a Copt and a Muslim: ‘[T]he only difference between the Copt and the Moslem is that the former is an Egyptian who worships in a Christian Church, whilst the latter is an Egyptian who worships in a Mohammedan Mosque’. 26 This was in part blamed on the close proximity between the two religions in aspects of everyday life: ‘The modern Copt has become from head to foot, in manners, language, and spirit, a Moslem, however unwilling he may be to recognise the fact’. 27 This mistrust of Copts was akin to the disdain held towards Jews.28 As a result, Cromer preferred the support of the Syrian Christians, whom he considered to be more modern and closer to the ‘European mentality’.29 Despite this however, Cromer did recognise that the Copts had ‘developed certain mediocre aptitudes’ which made them useful to both the British and their previous ‘oppressive’ rulers.30 As a result, the Europeans could rely on the Copt not on account of their shared religion, but due to their utility:\n\n44\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\n[The Copt can] add and subtract, because he knows his multiplication table, because he can measure the length and breadth of a plot of ground without making any gross error in the measurement, and because, although his system of accounts is archaic, at the same time it is better to be in a possession of a bad system of accounts than, like the Egyptian Moslem [sic.], to have scarcely any system at all.31 Considering the development of the bureaucratic apparatus in the period of British occupation, it is clear that that the Copts were favoured over the Muslim population for employment in many key departments. While in some departments, such as finance, the predominance of the Copts was not a new occurrence mirroring the pre-occupation period, in others, such as the Ministry of the Interior, the large number of Copts was largely attributable to the British. Cromer had credited this to the fact that a large number of Copts had been educated in missionary schools.32 The Copts were also consistently over-represented in the specialist schools of law, medicine and engineering from the 1890s. Copts had previously lacked the educational and linguistic head-start required for these schools, but after the 1890s an increase in the number of Coptic led and funded primary and secondary schools were important in escalating the number of applicants to the professional schools. Indeed, the Tawfiq Society, a philanthropic group created by members of the laity, established a professional school in Cairo in 1906. The school had 27 pupils in total, 22 of whom were Copt, whilst only 18 paid school fees.33 Table 1 Religious Affiliation in Primary and Secondary Schools, 1902.34 Religion Muslim Christian Jew Total\n\nPrimary School 470 298 11 779\n\nSecondary School 82 47 2 131\n\nTotal 552 345 13 910\n\nAlthough Copts made up approximately 7 per cent of the population at the turn of the twentieth century, they produced 21\n\nTHE MAKING OF NEW NATIONAL IDENTITIES\n\n45\n\nper cent of the law graduates; 19 per cent of graduates from the school of engineering; 15 per cent of graduates from the medical school, where one Copt graduated for every two Muslims, and 12 per cent of the teaching graduates, between 1886 and 1910.35 As also shown by Table 1, the Copts were disproportionately overrepresented in the state education system. A similar over-representation can be detected in the bureaucracy. In a report on the state of the Egyptian administration, written in 1901 by Eldon Gorst (who became Consul-General in Egypt between 1907 and 1911), he stated that Copts occupied approximately 45 per cent of the posts and received 40 per cent of the salaries, while Muslims occupied 44 per cent of posts and received only 6 per cent of salaries.36 Apart from the totally disproportionate figures between posts held and salaries received, there was also the demographic issue: Copts numbered 7 per cent of the population in 1907 but occupied nearly half of all the positions in the bureaucracy held by Egyptians. 37 Similarly, in 1905 a British commission reported that only 28 per cent of higher government posts were occupied by Egyptians, the majority of whom were Copts, and it seems that by 1911 this percentage had risen to 45.31 per cent.38 Table 2 Copts and Muslims in Government Ministries, 1911.39 Ministry Interior Public Works Justice Education Finance Communications War Total\n\nCopts Number Percentage 3878 62.3 251 29.4 220 14.8 66 6.1 1032 44.2 2500 48.1 135 30.6 8082 45.3\n\nMuslims Number Percentage 2347 37.7 604 70.6 1261 85.2 905 93.9 1301 55.8 2700 51.9 307 69.5 9514 54.7\n\n46\n\nTHE COPTS OF EGYPT\n\nThese figures were published alongside another report issued by Gorst in 1911, and caused a great deal of controversy both in Egypt and Britain. Kyriakos Mikhail (1877–1957), a Coptic journalist, spearheaded a press campaign entitled the ‘Coptic Question’, which questioned Gorst’s report and concentrated on the inequality of British treatment against the Copts. 40 Mikhail, having worked for a number of newspapers in Egypt, including the English language Egyptian Gazette, moved to London in 1908 where he opened an Egyptian information office and published a number of articles in the British press regarding the Copts. 41 Mikhail contested Gorst’s figures most publicly in a book published in 1911, arguing that whilst it would appear that Copts occupied a greater proportion of jobs than Muslims, the vast majority of these were ‘insignificant and such that the Muslim will not and cannot fill’.42 Indeed, Mikhail complained that the statistics had been drawn up incorrectly and that, despite the high Coptic numbers, the figures ‘[P]rove, if anything, that the Copts are under and that they are plainly victims of injustice, since, although their merits have won for them this high proportion of government posts, the most important positions still remain closed’, a reference to the position of Mudir (governor).43 Following the publication of Mikhail’s book, the ‘Coptic Question’ became a hot topic in the British press. Whereas Mikhail had been concerned with the state of Copts in governmental bureaucratic positions, the British press increasingly sought to connect the ‘Coptic Question’ with alleged cases of violence and inequality against Copts particularly in Upper Egypt. Several cases of clashes between Copts and Muslims had been reported to the police in late 1910 and were swiftly followed by a visit in January 1911 to the region by Gorst.
