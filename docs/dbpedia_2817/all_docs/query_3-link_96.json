This document is a thesis submitted by Laura Peirce to Macquarie University in fulfillment of the requirements for a Masters of Research degree in October 2015. The thesis examines the cultural memory and identity surrounding the Hyksos, who ruled Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, through an analysis of historical sources from that period as well as the Expulsion Period and New Kingdom. It utilizes concepts of communicative and cultural memory to understand how the legacy of the Hyksos developed over time and shaped Egyptian identity. The thesis contains literature reviews, discussions of methodology, and detailed analyses of textual sources organized chronologically.",
