        "text": "Jacques Feyder (born July 21, 1888, Brussels, Belgium—died May 25, 1948, Geneva, Switzerland) was a popular French motion-picture director of the 1920s and ’30s whose films are imbued with a sympathy for the common man and an attempt at psychological interpretation of character. His sharp criticism of French social and political trends was subordinated to his delineation of passionate and often poignant characters.\n\nFeyder came to Paris as an actor in 1912 and directed his first film the next year. The realistic L’Atlantide (1921), based on the novel by Pierre Benoît, was his first box-office success, but it was Crainquebille (1922), from Anatole France’s novel of daily Parisian life, that established his reputation as a director. He became a naturalized French citizen in 1928.\n\nAfter filming Thérèse Raquin (1928), based on Émile Zola’s novel, in Germany, Feyder returned to France to do Les Nouveaux Messieurs (1928; “The New Gentlemen”), a picture banned by the French government for its lightly satiric treatment of the French Parliament. Feyder spent the next five years in Hollywood, where his pictures included The Kiss (1929), an important silent film starring Greta Garbo; Daybreak (1931); and Son of India (1931)."
