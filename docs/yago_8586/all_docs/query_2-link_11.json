        "text": "Stage actor from 1912. Wrote and directed short features for Gaumont from 1916. Front-line military service during World War I. Directed Die Herrin von Atlantis (1921), shot on location in the Sahara, followed by another big success, Der Mann von der Straße (1922) two years later. Briefly with MGM in Hollywood, 1928-32, but did not enjoy the experience and returned to France. Directed his best film, La kermesse héroïque (1935) in 1935. After filming Tatjana (1937) for Alexander Korda, essentially retired. Found a safe refuge in Switzerland during the Second World War, teaching at the Geneva Conservatoire.\n\nHis younger contemporary René Clair judged in 1970, \"Jacques Feyder does not occupy today the place his work and his example should have earned him\". Any subsequent reassessment has tended to be hampered by the limited availability of his films in English-speaking countries, with the exception of La Kermesse héroïque which some reckon to have aged less well than other examples of his work. These factors have contributed to a sometimes ambivalent attitude to his work as a whole.\n\nIn 1944 Feyder and Françoise Rosay published Le Cinéma, notre métier, an autobiographical memoir of their work together in the cinema, in which Feyder stated that he regarded himself as an artisan, a craftsman of filmmaking. Some critics have been content to take him at his word and to look no further for any underlying vision of the world. He was however insistent upon his creative independence, demonstrated by his willingness to make his films in so many different countries if the conditions of production appeared favourable.\n\nHe started directing films for Gaumont in 1916, but his career was interrupted by service with the Belgian army during 1917-1919. After the end of the war, he returned to filmmaking and quickly built a reputation as one of the most innovative directors in French cinema. L'Atlantide (1921) (based on the novel by Pierre Benoit), and Crainquebille (1922) (from the novel by Anatole France) were his first major films to achieve public and critical attention."
