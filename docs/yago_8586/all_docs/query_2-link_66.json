There is a constant battle between that which is proper and acceptable and that which is not, between censorship and social acceptance. This years festival attempts to map the erotic element as it was evident in these great films by great creators, in different genres, from comedy to drama to adventure and exotic tales. Accompanied by original musical compositions which will be performed live during the screenings, another dimension and stimulus is offered to the audience in order to enhance the atmosphere of the times.\n\nIn cooperation with the STUDIO  Parallilo Kykloma and Christos Papadimitriou.\n\nInformation:\n\nWednesday 22nd June until Friday 1st July 2016, at 21:30\n\n7th Silent Film Festival, 2016\n\nLOVE & EROTISM\n\nLove and Eroticism in Silent Film\n\nWith live music accompaniment\n\nArtistic Direction: Alexandros Mouzas\n\nMichael Cacoyannis Foundation\n\nHall: Cinema\n\nFree Entrance\n\nSeats must be reserved: Tel: 210 34.18.579, Mon-Fri 11.00-14.00"
