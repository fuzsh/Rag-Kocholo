        "text": "Still another historical fresco from the color spec cycle of the Franco-Italian production setup, this is reminiscent of oldie costumers with intercutting between various climaxes, and keeping most history in the bedroom.\n\nThis [adaptation of Alexandre Dumas’ novel] concerns the impetuous Margot (Jeanne Moreau), daughter of Catherine (Francoise Rosay) and brother of Charles IX (Robert Porte), who is married to the Huguenot prince (Andre Versini) in order to form a bulwark for the king and ward off trouble. However, right after the marriage, the king calls for the massacre of the Huguenots and a bloodbath follows. During this debacle, a handsome count stumbles into Margot’s boudoir. It is, of course, love after the first fright. Then intrigue builds.\n\nMoreau is an engaging feline actress but is miscast for nudie roles. Remainder of the cast is fine, with Rosay a scheming Catherine and Porte a properly unpredictable king. Massacre has its share of bloodiness, with the nudity and love scenes not sparing the anatomy. Production is opulent and decorative."
