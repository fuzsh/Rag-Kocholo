Somerset Maugham’s novel The Painted Veil. This was filmed in 1936 with Greta Garbo in the central role. A very fine version was released in 2006 with Ed Norton and Naomi Watts in the central roles, with Liev Schreiber as the other man and Toby Jones as the doctor. Diana Rigg was the mother superior.\n\nIn this version, Eleanor Parker is the wife, Bill Travers her husband, Jean-Pierre? Aumont the lover and George Sanders the local doctor. Francoise Rosay is the mother superior.\n\nThe film focuses on a woman who marries a doctor and betrays him with an affair. He takes her up-country in China where an epidemic breaks out. She is isolated, has the time to rethink her behaviour, repents, becomes involved in helping the locals, especially with the advice of the mother superior. George Sanders is the local doctor who lives with a Chinese woman – a rather different role for him.\n\nThe film was directed by British Ronald Neame, cinematographer for David Lean who began directing in 1950 with Golden Salamander, The Card, The Million-Pound? Note. He directed some classics in England: The Horse’s Mouth and Tunes of Glory before going to the United States where he directed such films as The Chalk Garden, The Prime of Miss Jean Brody, The Poseidon Adventure and The Odessa File.\n\n1.
