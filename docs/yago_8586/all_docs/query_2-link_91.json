        "text": "EURE, France -- Actress Simone Signoret, known for the sensuality and gutsy wisdom she projected on the screen, died today of cancer, her family said. She was 64.\n\nSignoret died at her country home, said her daughter, Catherine Allegret, said.\n\n'She fought right to the end,' Allegret said. 'She died as she lived, with courage.'\n\nSignoret, who was married to French singer Yves Montand, lived in Autheuil-Authouillet. She was known as much for her strong political stands and writing as for her movie career.\n\nSignoret rejected the trappings of movie stardom throughout her successful career. She made no effort to preserve an image of youth as she grew older, but let the wrinkles come and her waistline expand.\n\n'I got old the way women who aren't actresses grow old,' the Oscar winner once said.\n\nSimone-Henriette-Charlotte Kaminker was born in Wiesbaden, Germany, March 25, 1921, to Andre and Georgette Kaminker. Her father was an army officer and talented linguist and Simone and her two brothers grew up in an intellectual atmosphere. The family later moved to Paris.\n\nThe Nazi invasion of France brought great changes to the Kaminker household. Her father, who was part Jewish, joined the resistance with Gen. Charles de Gaulle in London.\n\nSimone stayed behind in Paris, teaching English and Latin and working as a typist for the newspaper Le Nouveau Temps.\n\nDuring the German occupation, the blue-eyed Signoret made lasting ties with artists, writers and actors who she met at the Cafe de Flore, a favorite meeting place of the Parisien intellectual and artistic community.\n\nShe left Le Nouveau Temps because it became pro-German and began to take her first walk-on parts on stage and in films.\n\nShe received her first major recognition as an actress in 1947, when she was awarded the Prize Suzanne Bianchetti for her performance in Jacques Feyder's film 'Macadam.'\n\nThe same year she married film director Yves Allegret, who had guided her in her early work. They had one daughter, Catherine.\n\nTwo years later, while vacationing in the Riviera, Signoret met actor-singer Montand. They were married June 15, 1950, following Signoret's divorce from Allegret.\n\nIn 1952 and 1953 Signoret received two major French film awards for her portrayal of a streetwalker in 'La Ronde.' The picture received considerable publicity in the United States, where it was banned in New York state as immoral before the Supreme Court ruled against censorship in 1954.\n\nIn 1953 she won the British Film Award for her performance as queen of the Apaches in 'Casque d'Or' and appeared in the successful 'Therese Raquin.'\n\nA year later Signoret again won the British award as best foreign actress for her portrayal of Elizabeth Proctor in 'Les Sorcieres de Salem,' Jean-Paul Sartre's adaptation of Arthur Miller's 'The Crucible.'\n\nAlthough the youthful sex appeal disappeared, Signoret's wisdom never waned and she won an impressive range of demanding roles during her later years.\n\nIn 1977 she received worldwide acclaim for her portrayal of the aging 'Madame Rosa,' a Jewish ex-prostitute who comes to love a young Arab boy while caring for the children of other prostitutes.\n\nThe British film 'Room at the Top,' for which she won the 1960 Oscar for best actress, was the first of Signoret's performances to win her enthusiastic acclaim in the United States. It also won her best actress awards of the British Film Academy and the Cannes Film Festival and the German Film Critics prize for best foreign actress.\n\nDespite the rave reviews, she and husband Montand received a cool personal reception from an American public steeped in the throes of McCarthyism. Although Signoret and Montand never joined the Communist Party, they were involved in leftist causes that made them suspicious political figures in the United States.\n\nIn 1957 the State Department denied the Montands a visa. Two years later, modifying its position, it notified them that the government had every right to refuse them entry but had waived its rights of refusal.\n\nAlthough she had little interest in American films, Signoret still found the McCarthy stigma hurt her career because French and Italian producers who wanted to show their films in the United States refused to sign her up.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s she appeared in 20 films, including 'Compartiment Tueurs' in 1961, which she made with her daughter Catherine, 'Le Chat' in 1970, 'La Veuve Couderc' in 1971 and 'La Chair de l'Orchidee' in 1975.\n\nShe was a woman of sharp intellect who wrote two autobiographical works and translated numerous books from English to French.\n\nIn 1977 Simone published her first book, 'Nostalgia Isn't What It Used to Be.' She called it not an autobiography but the study of the development of a human being.\n\n'The book isn't about myself,' Signoret explained. 'It's about me seeing things, going through a period of time.'\n\nHer second book, 'The Next Day She Was Smiling,' a response to questions left unanswered in 'Nostalgia,' was published in 1979."
