Even now, there's something bewitchingly bonkers about it. It holds its own logic, and, if a little long for a comedy of politics, it's brain food to show up a concept like The Stepford Wives. In fact Feyder and wife Françoise Rosay, who stars, simultaneously made a German version entitled The Clever Women. Said women come to the fore when Spanish soldiers invade Flanders in 1616. The Flemish men hide, the mayor plays possum."
