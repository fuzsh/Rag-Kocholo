What 18-year-old wouldn’t fall stupidly in love with married Garbo if they were so lucky to be orbiting her social circle. For his trouble, the young lad (played by a debuting, fresh-faced Lew Ayres) gets beaten within an inch of his life for forcing a long kiss on the not entirely unreceptive Irene (Garbo). The Kiss would be the last silent for both Garbo and Conrad Nagel (who plays the third man, and true love interest in this doomed quadrangle love affair). MGM couldn’t drag their feet any longer and had to make the transition to talking pictures.…\n\nGreta Garbo’s final silent film is rarely regarded as one of her best, but I’ve always liked it. A lot of the credit surely goes to Garbo herself. She may well have been the subtlest star of the silent era — she communicates more with a shrug or a half-smile than most other actors can with wild gesticulations or, once talkies came around, with reams of dialogue. However, I’ll put in a word for director Jacques Feyder, who coaxes subtle performances from the rest of the cast, too, and comes up with startlingly cinematic ideas of his own. It’s a shame that Garbo didn’t have the same rapport with Feyder she had with Clarence Brown. Although Feyder directed the German-language…\n\nIt's not too often that a single part of a movie can really sell me on a movie, but The Kiss certainly did. Overall, this is a bit of a mystery component, with Greta Garbo as a wife in a fairly disinterested marriage and in love with another man while also drawing the attention of a teenager. With one of the most literal Chekhov's Guns ever, this ends with her husband dead and her on trial and trying to not tell investigators anything. That alone makes for a decent story, and there was a good sense of mystery towards the end (the sort that would disappear after the production code would kick in and moral grays were removed).\n\nWhat I…\n\nQueer Film Challenge 2018\n\nWeek 16: A film starring an actress from classic Hollywood who was / may have been closeted\n\nJacques Feyder’s The Kiss is both Greta Garbo‘s and MGM’s goodbye to the silent era, a rather short melodrama about jilted lovers and murderous intrigue - heavy on florid title cards and Tchaikovsky’s theme from Romeo and Juliet. My TCM rip (for private home viewing purposes only, I promise) has Robert Osborne’s intro, in which we learn that Garbo was pleased to work with the very European Feyder; instead of yelling “cut!” after shooting a scene, Feyder would take a handkerchief and daintly flutter it in front of the camera. If I ever directed films, I’d do that too.…\n\n1929's The Kiss represents the last silent film (sort of) for both MGM in general and Greta Garbo in particular, largely out of concern about how the Swedish star would translate into the talking era. On the surface, it would seem like a foolish strategy to release a movie without recorded dialogue while audiences were ignoring such movies in droves and attending any old crap with voices, doubly so given that this was released just a few months after the stock market crash that led to the Great Depression. Yet it wound up becoming a hit in spite of all of this. How did this happen?\n\nWell, it wasn't aided by the average melodrama, which involves Garbo's Irene in a…"
