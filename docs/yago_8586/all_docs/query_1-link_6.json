        "text": "PARIS, March 29—Frangoise Rosay, the actress, who played in more than 100 French, British, American and German movies during a 61‐year career, died here yesterday at the age of 82.\n\nMiss Rosay, whose real name was Frangoise Bandy de Naleche, studied acting and singing at the Paris Conservatory before joining in 1913, a French theatrical troupe performing in Saint Petersburg, Russia. That same year she made her film debut in “Falstaff,” and four years later embarked on a career as a singer at the Paris Opera.\n\nAfter being married to Jacques Feyder, pioneer Belgian film director, she worked as his assistant in the midnineteen‐twenties, notably on “Visages d’ Enfants” and “Carmen.’\n\nHer breakthrough as a film actress came in the mid‐thirties with such classics as “Jenny,” “Carnet de Bal” and Marcel Carn's “Drole de Drame,” in which she starred with Michel Simon, Louis Jouvet, Jean‐Louis Barrault and Jean‐Pierre Aumont.\n\nPerhaps her best‐remembered role was in her husband's “Carnival in Flanders,” as the leader of the women in a beleaguered city of the Middle Ages. Her English‐language films included “The 13th Letter,” “The Halfway House,” “Johnny Frenchman,” “September Affair” and “The Scarlet Pen.”\n\nDuring World War II, Miss Rosay worked with the propaganda department of the Free French and at the time of the liberation of France found herself one of the directors of Radio Algiers in charge of cultural broadcasts. That work resulted in her receiving the French Legion of Honor.\n\nAfter the war, Miss Rosay appeared in Paris boulevard plays, the last of which, two years ago, was the most successful, “La Soupiere.” She acted character roles in dozens of gangster movies and film comedies, opened a drama class in Geneva and another in Paris. She appeared in television series and worked on her memoirs, to be published next fall.\n\nEarlier, she and her husband wrote Le Cinema, Notre Métier“. (The Movies, Our Profession). Last summer in Munich, she played her last movie part, in Maximilian Schell”s “The Pedestrian.”\n\nShe is survived by three sons.\n\nMade Debut Here In ‘61\n\nMiss Rosay, who typified the sophisticated French woman, was an international star in the true sense of the term. She !made her New York stage debut late in her career, in 1961, as Catherine the Great in “Once There Was a Russian.”\n\nAmong her films were “The Longest Day” for Darryl Zanuck, and, with Jean Gabin, “Father Fights Back,” a German‐made version of “The Last of Mrs. Cheyney.” She also appeared in “Solitaire,” a British Broadcasting Corporation television play.\n\nDuring the turbulent World War II years she and her husband fled France, without possessions, in a journey that carried them to Switzerland, North Africa and England. Her effective broadcasts in behalf of the Allies angered Jo,seph Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister.\n\nAfter the death of her husband in 1948, Madame Rosay pondered retirement. She said of herself:\n\n“At first I thought I could never work again without my husband. But everywhere, the film people are nice and keep me busy. They think of me as being only tragic and strong. But I can be very, very comic —maybe something like Marie Dressler.”"
