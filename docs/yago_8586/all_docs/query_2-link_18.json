He was a leading director of silent films during the 1920s, and in the 1930s he became associated with the style of poetic realism in French cinema. He adopted French nationality in 1928.\n\n\"L'Atlantide\" (1921) (based on the novel by Pierre Benoit), and \"Crainquebille\" (1922) (from the novel by Anatole France) were his first major films to achieve public and critical attention. He followed these with \"Visages d'enfants\" (filmed in 1923 but not released until 1925) which proved to be one of his most personal and durable films.\n\nFeyder accepted an offer from MGM to work in Hollywood, where in 1929 his first project was directing Greta Garbo in \"The Kiss,\" her last silent film. It was in Hollywood that he made the transition to sound films.\n\nFeyder returned to France in 1933. During the next three years he made three of his most successful films, all of them in collaboration with screenwriter Charles Spaak and featuring Françoise Rosay in a leading role. \"Le Grand Jeu\" (1934) and \"Pension Mimosas\" (1935) were both significant creations in the style of poetic realism; \"La Kermesse héroïque\" (1935) (also known as \"Carnival in Flanders\") was a meticulously staged period film with contemporary political resonances, which earned Feyder several international awards.\n\nIn 1917, Feyder had married Parisian-born actress Françoise Rosay (1891–1974) with whom he had three sons; she acted in many of his films and collaborated with him as writer and assistant director on Visages d'enfants. Jacques Feyder died on 24 May 1948, aged 60, at Prangins, Switzerland.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nbusiness associate/partner relationship with Bernard, Raymond (1891) (born 10 October 1891)\n\nspouse relationship with Rosay, Françoise (born 19 April 1891).

Flatté, je me réjouis de cet accueil, quand j'appris que le 21 juillet était le jour de la fête nationale belge.\"\n\nTranslation: You asked me for a biographical note and here it is: I was born in Brussels on 21 July 1887 at 9 am, and in that moment when they knew I was a boy, a salvo of 101 guns began to undermine the atmosphere. Flattered, I welcomed this when I learned that 21 July was the day of the Belgian national holiday.\n\nNB: Other references give 1885.\n\nCategories\n\nFamily : Relationship : Number of Marriages (One)\n\nFamily : Parenting : Kids 1-3 (Three sons)\n\nVocation : Entertainment : Actor/ Actress\n\nVocation : Entertain/Business : Director (Film)"
