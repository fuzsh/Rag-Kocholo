        "text": "The New Yorker, November 4, 1961 P. 60\n\nPROFILE sketch of Simone Signoret, born in Wiesbaden, Germany, in 1921. Her father, Andre Kaminker was Jewish, her mother was French. When she was two, the family moved to Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris. When she was 15, she went to England for three months as a paying guest on a poultry farm, & began to learn English. Recently, when she made a French movie called \"Les Mauvais Coups,\" she was able to do her own English dubbing. Tells about her life during the German Occupation. Her first real movie part was as a prostitute in \"Les Demons de l'Aube,\" in '45. She was married to Yves Allegret. Jacques Feyder hired her to play with his wife, Francoise Rosay, in his movie \"Macadam.\" The picture came out superbly, and she was offered a part in an English picture, \"Against the Wind.\" After she had been married for seven years, she met Yves Montand, & fell in love with him. She left her husband and her young daughter by her first marriage. She likes her life. She and her husband are almost always together. Miss S. was given the Academy Award for her acting in \"Room at the Top.\" She then appeared in \"Casque d'Or,\" and \"Diabolique.\" The greatest enjoyment for her and Yves was when they played together in Paris, in Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible,\" on the stage, for one year."
