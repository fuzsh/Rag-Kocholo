Mme. Rosay is 69; has 3 sons and 2 grandsons. She said in Paris they do not rehearse in a place like this, but in the theatre they are to play in. This is her first time in a play in N.Y. She finds it interesting. Her husband was Jacques Feyder, who was a movie director; he died 13 years ago. She came to America for the first time in the 20's when her husband was invited to Hollywood to direct Greta Garbo in \"The Kiss\". All three of her sons work in the cinema: Marc Frederix, who is an art director; Paul Feyder, first assistant director, Bernard Farrel, assistant director and TV director as well.\n\nView Article\n\nA Reporter at Large\n\nInfiltrating the Far Right\n\nThe threat from domestic terrorism is rising, but, with Republicans decrying the “deep state,” the F.B.I. is cautious about investigating far-right groups.
