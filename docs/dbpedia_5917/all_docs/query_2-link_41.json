Settled as a Native American trading post in 1654, it was named after Derby, England, in 1675. The city’s rivers made it an ideal spot for manufacturing. From the first water-powered gristmill in 1681 to the opening of the Housatonic Dam in 1870, Derby was a successful manufacturing town. In the nineteenth century, it produced a wide-variety of goods, including hoopskirts and corsets. Derby is the state’s smallest municipality and is also the birthplace of famous Revolutionary War hero David Humphreys."
