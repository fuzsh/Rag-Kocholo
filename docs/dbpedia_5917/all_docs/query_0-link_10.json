        "text": "The Local Southeast Georgia Derby Race History:\n\nThe local derby began in 1992 in Lyons, Georgia. Approximately 20 cars were involved in the first race competing in only the Stock Division.\n\nToday, the local race has grown to over 60 drivers competing in three divisions: Stock, Super-stock, and Masters. In 2014, the Southeast Georgia Soapbox Derby stock division was the 2nd largest in size of number of drivers in the country next to the All-American race itself. In 2012, the SE Georgia Derby only had 19 cars involved. The vision for the derby was to see it grow bigger and better with each year. In 2013, the super-stock division was added and in 2019 the Masters division was added. The Stock Division is open to boys and girls 7-13 years old. This is the easiest division and features cars made from a ready-to-assemble kit. These can be ordered in white and can only be decorated with vinyl lettering or fully wrapped. The super-stock cars are slightly larger, weigh more, can have a custom paint job, and can accommodate a driver from 10 to 18 years old. The masters division is a lay down car and is for experienced races age 10-21. The masters cars can have a full custom paint job and are fitted to be driver specific. The winners from each division are presented with a champion hoodie, backpack, and a $1000.00 check to help with expenses for traveling to Akron, OH to compete in the World Championship Race."
