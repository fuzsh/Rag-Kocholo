It's a program where you're working 50% of the time and going to school 50% of the time.\n\nThroughout most of my career, I've worked in the research group at Plastic Omnium. A few years back, I took over as Research Manager in Troy. Now, I'm based in Brussels working on directing a project for the fuel system of tomorrow.\n\nI would say the thing I'm most proud of at Plastic Omnium is: working here and making the transition from a purely mechanical world to a world of mechatronics, and that's best exemplified probably through the project of the E-Valve, where we've come up with a mechatronic component. So you have to bridge this world from programming all the way down to the basic physics of the component.\n\nI think two things motivate me here at Plastic Omnium, the first is the people. It's a very collaborative and open environment, which allows us to succeed and do things quickly. The second is really the prestige of the company, It's not easy for a company to survive for 70 years, and still maintain growth.\n\nAnd so I'm very proud to work here. I think honestly what it takes to succeed at Plastic Omnium is open communication and honesty. It's what our culture is built around, and it's what makes you thrive in this company.\n\nText transcription\n\nGood morning, my name is Zhezhe Zhang. I am a Validation Engineer at Sigmatech Engineering Center.\n\nMy job is to ensure that the customer requirements are met during the development phase, in order to guarantee the quality of our products during the complete lifecycle of the vehicle.\n\nOn a daily basis, this entails the analysis of customer specifications and associated testing methodologies, the creation of internal tests according to specific needs, the follow-up of the validation plan, the technical contribution to the development of the product and process, to ensure their conformity, together with the Project Team, and finally the writing and validation of testing reports.\n\nMy job as a Validation Engineer allows me to work with colleagues from different departments like the Project, Simulation and Prototyping Teams. I work with different Engineering Centers worldwide: Munich, Pappenheim, Bratislava, Greer…\n\nI am particularly proud to have participated in the integration of a new Shaker test facility at the Sigmatech Laboratory.\n\nI came to France in 2013 to finish my double degree in Mechanical Engineering. I was lucky enough to find my first job and to join the Plastic Omnium family.\n\nText transcription\n\nHello, my name is Carmen Hoffendahl and I am a Know-How Material Engineer at Plastic Omnium based in Σ-Sigmatech in Lyon.\n\nThe main task as a Material Engineer within PO is the choice of the raw materials for each client and product line, that can be for example: a bumper, a tailgate, a structural part or a body panel part.\n\nThe main task as a Material Engineer within PO is the choice of the raw materials for each client and product line, that can be for example: a bumper, a tailgate, a structural part or a body panel part.\n\nSince I have been at in Plastic Omnium, the biggest challenge that I’ve had was the integration of Faurecia Automotive Exteriors and the welcome of our new colleagues. Especially, the deployment of our standards within the new perimeter and helping our new colleagues to experience the “PO Way”.\n\nWhat motivates me to come to work each day at Plastic Omnium is that each day is different. Each day you have different challenges and a typical day is not predictable. Each day, you come and you see what the day is giving.\n\nText transcription\n\nI am Monica Pita, Plant Manager at Plastic Omnium in Vigo.\n\nI started my career in Plastic Omnium as an intern. I had worked as an intern for a year and then as a Production Manager for ten years.\n\nThen I was in charge of Manufacturing Management. For one year now, I've been Plant Manager in the Auto Inergy Division.\n\nI'm very proud of the opportunity the company has given me to develop myself, to learn and to thrive. I'm also proud of the team I lead and all support I have from each of them.\n\nI've been working with them for six years now as part of the team.\n\nNow I lead them and they made the transition easier. I am very well supported. I really enjoy working for this company because we work for production, really close to the customer. There is a huge team working for innovation and to assure our future for the next years.\n\nIn order to succeed in Plastic Omnium it takes energy, enthusiasm, teamwork engagement, being combative...\n\nAnd pushing yourself day by day with plenty of energy and enthusiasm.\n\nText transcription\n\nHello, I am Teresa Vazquez. I am in charge of Purchasing at the Plastic Omnium plant in Redondela, Spain.\n\nMy main missions are to make sure that the plant’s needs are fully covered at the best conditions in terms of quality and service. This contributes to the plant's profitability.\n\nI believe that the key to success in a job such as mine is the willingness to learn and good negotiation skills. Add to this an eagerness to excel, and perseverance to meet your targets.\n\nI believe that my biggest achievement at Plastic Omnium has been to create, at the Redondela plant, a Purchasing culture. The employees have become aware of the importance of negotiating with suppliers and seeking out new products, new alternatives, helping the factory to keep growing and developing sustainably on the long term.\n\nI believe that my biggest achievement at Plastic Omnium has been to create, at the Redondela plant, a Purchasing culture. The employees have become aware of the importance of negotiating with suppliers and seeking out new products, new alternatives, helping the factory to keep growing and developing sustainably on the long term.\n\nText transcription\n\nMy name is Jessica Blair. I'm the Plant Controller here at Chattanooga USA for Plastic Omnium.\n\nI joined Plastic Omnium just after graduating with my MBA to become the US Commercial Controller.\n\nI held various positions in Finance before transitioning into the Logistics Department as the US Systems Controller, but I missed Finance so I was grateful when I was given the opportunity to move back into the Finance team as Plant Controller here at Chattanooga.\n\nLast year, we received some substantial cost savings targets from upper Management, and by coordinating with the local team here, including the Buyer, the Cost Center Managers and the Director, we were able to not only accomplish this target, but also to exceed it, which made everybody here really proud of our accomplishment.\n\nI enjoy the variety of challenges you face here at Plastic Omnium and the camaraderie you feel with the other team members when you work together to accomplish your goals.\n\nBased on my experience, to succeed at Plastic Omnium, you need to be flexible. You're always facing new challenges, and you need to be able to learn from them, and draw on your past experiences in order to face new obstacles that you haven't encountered before.\n\nText transcription\n\nHello, I'm Sandrine Lepesqueux, I'm a Marketing Analyst for Plastic Omnium in Troy, USA.\n\nI started 5 years ago with Plastic Omnium. I was Marketing Analyst in the South-East of France.\n\nMy main mission at that time was to support the Sales & Marketing team by doing analysis of the Chinese and European markets.\n\nIn 2014, I joined the Marketing team in Paris. I was also part of the project team of our Market Intelligence Tool, and in September 2016, I got the opportunity to move to Troy in the US.\n\nHere, I'm very proud to support the growth of the company in the region. I'm very proud of my participation with PO at the Raid Centrale Supélec in 2016. It was an amazing experience, very challenging. My team was a mix of cultures and profiles. We got along very well, we were able to build a strong relationship, and thanks to the trust and support we gave to each other, we were able to finish 7th out of 45 teams.\n\nIn my work at Plastic Omnium, I like the people the most. I've got the opportunity to meet great people, great talents within the organization, and then, the opportunities to travel and evolve, changing position.\n\nTo finish, I would say I enjoy my position as Marketing Analyst: you've got the opportunity to bring data analytics to the forefront of the strategic planning, and this is very exciting.\n\nTo succeed at Plastic Omnium, according to me, you need to be dedicated, ambitious and mobile.\n\nText transcription\n\nHello I’m Claire d'Achon. I'm an Industrial Designer at Plastic Omnium, part of the Intelligent Exterior Systems Division.\n\nAs a designer today, I work with OEMs (carmakers) and make the link between the Style department and the Engineering department at Plastic Omnium.\n\nWe also work on a large range of products such as bumpers, tailgates, door modules and other body panels.\n\nEverything is linked with different features: aerodynamics, new technology integration, lighting functions.\n\nAnd so the daily work is to go with the OEMs and bring our support by making some sketching, some renderings, some style concepts, and to show them what it would look like if we integrate our new technologies into their style features.\n\nI've been a designer for 10 years and I studied Product Design. I started my career by managing the design at Heuliez Bus in transportation design.\n\nI have 2 passions in life: first, horses. I love riding, I love competition.\n\nAnd I have another passion for cars, vintage cars. When I was 22 years old, I bought a vintage car that I restored, and now I drive it and have a lot of fun!\n\nI think as a Designer, it's very important to love your product. When you receive a brief, you start drawing it and develop the ideas with many other people. The day it comes out, either as a mock-up or production part, it's amazing to see it at scale 1, to see the finishing, to see the proportions.\n\nAnd of course, it's all a question of emotion, feeling, intuition.\n\nIn my opinion a Designer has a major responsibility in shaping the connected and sustainable vehicle of the future.\n\nStudents and recent graduates\n\nAs a student or recent graduate, you’ll find your role at OPmobility thanks to the variety on offer. With internships, work-study programs and VIE vacancies in IT, procurement, production, research and innovation, finance, logistics and more – all professions are possible.\n\nINTERNSHIPS AND WORK-STUDY\n\nPROGRAMS WITH OPmobility\n\nWhether you hail from an engineering school, business school or university, you’ll find numerous opportunities with OPmobility.\n\nThe opening weeks are dedicated to orientation and training, after which you’ll move quickly onto projects that will involve you in real challenges with considerable independence.
