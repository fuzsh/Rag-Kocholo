        "text": "Ranked 23rd best place to live in the UK in 2015, Derby is a well-connected commuter hub on the border of the Midlands and the North of England, but has plenty of perks in its own right which make the city a fantastic place to live.\n\nWith beautiful surrounding countryside, plenty of fun bars and pubs and loads of family friendly activities to keep the kids happy, Derby is the ideal mid-size city for people of any age. You’ll also find the people here are especially welcoming. Despite a population of over 250,000 Derby is known as one of the most neighbourly cities in the UK.\n\nDerby has also been rated as the second best place in the UK to make a living, a nod to the availability of good jobs but relatively low costs of living and lower house prices than many similarly sized UK cities. You’ve also got the Peak District just around the corner, which is regarded as one of the nation’s finest examples of charming English countryside.\n\nConsidering a move to Derbyshire’s second city (rather confusingly, the county town is Matlock!)? Read on to find out more.\n\nTransport links\n\nBeing one of the UK’s most central cities, there are without a doubt some great transport links in Derby. The city is home to 3 train stations, with Derby Station being the main hub just a short walk from the city centre. You can reach London by fast train in just 1 hour 46 minutes, Leeds in 1 hour 19 minutes and Birmingham in just 45 minutes.\n\nDerby also has affordable, reliable buses that have been ranked the 6th best in the country by the Campaign for Better Transport. Connections across the city leave on an average every 10 minutes.\n\nThe A38 which intersects Derby allows easy road access to Birmingham and the rest of the West Midlands for drivers whilst the Derby Southern Bypass links the surrounding area with the M1 which connects London and Leeds plus the A1(M) to Newcastle and beyond. Cyclists will appreciate the sheer number of cycle routes across this flat, compact city, which is also a Sustrans National Cycle Network hub town with four main routes criss-crossing the city.\n\nNearest stations\n\nDerby\n\nPeartree\n\nSpondon\n\nDuffield\n\nSchools\n\nDerby has an excellent selection of local primary and secondary schools.\n\nLawn Primary School in Allestree has the best SATS results in the city, with 89% achieving the expected level for 11-year olds in reading, writing and maths. The national average is 65%, to put that into perspective! Spanish is also taught in years 3-6. Redwood Primary School in Sinfin saw 75% of pupils achieving at least the expected standard and 11% being above the expected standard.\n\nIn terms of secondary education, Landau Forte College was rated well above average in the 2019 GCSE results, and prides itself on its diversity and inclusivity. Derby Grammar School is a selective boys school accommodating students from primary age with a co-educational sixth form. Derby High School is a co-educational private school for ages 3-18 and was Derbyshire’s top performing independent day school in 2019.\n\nDerby is also home to the eponymous and well-regarded University of Derby, which appears at number 26 in the 2020 UK university league tables and has a population of around 30,000 students.\n\nLeisure and amenities\n\nIf you’re a nature lover, look no further than Derby’s numerous parks and green space, including Derby Arboretum – the very first park in the UK and said to be the inspiration for Central Park in New York. Or head slightly further afield to the stunning Peak District National Park. Dovedale is particularly popular and the Heights of Abraham in Matlock Bath includes a cable car travelling up to sweeping vistas of the Peaks.\n\nWhilst Derby – much like the rest of the UK – is no stranger to the odd shower, there are still plenty of indoor activities to keep you busy.\n\nCatch the latest blockbuster at the Showcase or ODEON cinemas or head to various leisure centres, including Springwood Leisure Centre, Queen’s Leisure Centre, and Rolls-Royce Leisure Fitness Centre which all have gym, swimming and kids facilities. Adult-only gyms include The Gym, Pure Gym, and Nuffield Health. Rollerworld Derby is a great family friendly day out, although there are lots of adult only skating options too. Or play culture vulture and visit the Derby Museum and Art Gallery.\n\nFor the shoppers, intu Derby is a good start for some retail therapy, with countless high street stores. Or check out the nearby East Midlands Designer Outlet which offers an impressive 60% off many high street and designer favourites. For those who prefer local, independent retailers, Cathedral Quarter is definitely worth a look. Quirky and boutique specialist shops from toy shops, confectioners and jewellers to high end fashion, hair and beauty salons and everything in between are all on offer alongside the bustling Victorian Market Hall and inviting cafés, bars and restaurants. All of which are overlooked by the Georgian Derby Cathedral and historic Derby’s impressive architecture.\n\nDerby has an eclectic dining scene, from the traditional gastro pub experience to exotic worldwide cuisine and those pushing the boundaries in plant-based and eco-friendly dining. Popular eateries include the Indian restaurant Anoki, artisan pizza restaurant the Book Café, The Dining Room and The Cock Inn who provide a separate vegan menu. Check out TripAdvisor for more local favourites.\n\nWhat’s on?\n\nFestival fans, or lovers of the weird and wonderful, will be happy to hear that there are plenty of bespoke festivals in Derby year-round including award-winning Bearded Theory, The Winter Ale Festival and the Dog Lovers Festival. Or catch the latest performance at Derby Theatre, a poetry or comedy night for something a bit different.\n\nThe Roundhouse in Derby also plays host to a number of events throughout the year, including corporate and networking events like Mainspring: Dinner at the Roundhouse, the Lykke Wellness Festival and the impressive Spring, Summer and Christmas Markets, offering the best in local artisan crafts and seasonal produce.\n\nIf you’re keen on playing tourist, the Made in Derby Walk travels around the city centre and will teach you about some of the city’s most famous inhabitants.\n\nSafety & Crime\n\nVoted the UK’s third safest large city in 2018 by Compare the Market, crime levels in Derby are fairly low for a city of its size and health and social care also rated highly in the survey.\n\nAreas such as Littleover, Mickleover, Chellaston, and Allestree are considered to be the best areas to live in terms of safety. However, like any UK town or city, crime does exist and initiatives like multi-agency led Safer Derbyshire work hard to reduce crime and the fear of crime in Derby and surrounding areas.\n\nMore information on crime and safety in Derby and the work of the local police force can be found on the Police UK website.\n\nWant to know more?"
