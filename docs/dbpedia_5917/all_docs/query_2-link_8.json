        "text": "Derby, town and port in West Kimberley shire, northern Western Australia. It lies on the western shore of a peninsula in King Sound, an inlet of the Indian Ocean, near the mouth of the Fitzroy River.\n\nFounded in 1883 to serve a pastoral district, Derby was named for Edward Henry Stanley, 15th earl of Derby, who was then the British secretary of state for the colonies. The town boomed during the Kimberley gold rush (1885) in the hinterland. Situated near the Great Northern Highway to Perth (approximately 1,500 miles [2,400 km] southwest), Derby was once the major port for the cattle of West Kimberley. Beef cattle from the Fitzroy River valley and King Leopold Ranges were transported to slaughterhouses in Derby and thence shipped along the coast from the port. A jetty1,800 feet (550 metres) long was built at Derby to partially overcome difficulties presented by a 35-foot (11-metre) tidal range. The wharf was closed from 1980 to 1997, when it reopened as an export facility for zinc and lead ores.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAustralian Vocabulary Quiz"
