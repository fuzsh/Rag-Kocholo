        "text": "Derby is a city in the East Midlands of England.\n\nDerby is located on the banks of the River Derwent and is surrounded by the shire county of Derbyshire and has a population of approximately 255,000.\n\nDerby was settled by Romans, who established the town of Derventio, later captured by the Anglo-Saxons, and later still by the Vikings, who made their town of Djúra-bý one of the Five Boroughs of the Danelaw. Initially a market town, Derby grew rapidly in the industrial era. Home to Lombe’s Mill, an early British factory, Derby has a claim to be one of the birthplaces of the Industrial Revolution.[citation needed] It contains the southern part of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. With the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, Derby became a centre of the British rail industry.\n\nDerby is a centre for advanced transport manufacturing, being home to the world’s second largest aero-engine manufacturer: Rolls-Royce. Bombardier Transportation has a production facility at the Derby Litchurch Lane Works while Toyota Manufacturing UK’s automobile headquarters is located southwest of the city at Burnaston."
