        "text": "When locals think of Derby, they often think of Derby pyclets, the Rolls-Royce HQ and going to games at Pride Park Stadium. If that sounds like somewhere you would like to call home, make your way over to Derby and see for yourself why so many people settle down in this quaint city.\n\nWhere is Derby?\n\nDerby is a mid-size city on the back of the River Derwent in south Derbyshire. It is just west of Nottingham, and not too far south of the beautiful Peak District. Some say Derby is the most central point of England and it certainly has excellent connections to the rest of the country.\n\nA brief history of Derby\n\nThe Romans were the first known civilisation to settle along the River Derwent around AD80, creating the fort Derventio. The Roman Road of Rykneld Street passed directly through Derventio and connected the more developed south with the less-developed north. For over three centuries, the Romans remained in the area until it was taken over by the Saxons and a town eventually began to form. In fact, many of the suburbs around Derby were named during the Saxon rule, and most have kept those names.\n\nCenturies of unrest followed, but during the 13th century and Medieval period, Derby came to be wealthy and very religious. Over the next 400 years, the city developed industries in brewing, clockmaking and cloth weaving – all of which contributed to the area’s success when the Industrial Revolution began.\n\nAn in-depth look at Derby\n\nWho lives there?\n\nDerby has green spaces galore and plenty of schools in the city, with numerous Universities close by, so it’s no surprise that families love Derby. The area has seen an increase in its Polish population in recent years, and it is home to over 30,000 students during term time. These students come from the 17 universities that are all within an hour’s drive of the city, with the University of Derby and the University of Nottingham’s graduate medical school at Royal Derby Hospital being the closest.\n\nTypes of property in Derby\n\nThe average rent in Derby is about £623 per month, with one-bedroom properties starting from £380 – £430pcm. Two bedrooms will cost you between £600 and £720, and three bedrooms are available for about £660-£940 per month.\n\nThe vast majority of residential properties in Derby are houses. Still, about 15% of the homes in Derby are either flats or maisonettes, so there is definitely plenty of choice if you’re debating between renting a house or flat in the area.\n\nDerby transport\n\nDerby has thee train stations; though Sponon and Peartree stations have somewhat limited connections, Derby station can offer you a variety of destinations. From here you can get the fast train to London in about 1 hour and 46 minutes, to Leeds in about 1 hour and 20 minutes and you could be in Birmingham in no more than 45 minutes. Derby also has frequent bus services, with connections leaving every 10 minutes from all over the city.\n\nRestaurants and shops\n\nThe Exeter Arms.\n\nThe fine folks in this rural country-style pub invite you to go back to simpler times and enjoy excellent food and traditional ales in their cosy rooms.\n\nLorentes\n\nWith a wine selection as big as their food menu, this tapas venue takes having a good time very seriously! Even Spanish natives love Lorentes and rave about the padrones and morcilla that aren’t typically available in your average tapas bar.\n\nBistrot Pierre\n\nEvery starter at Bistrot Pierre comes with freshly baked French bread and butter – need we say more? This is a lovely place to impress a date or to simply treat yourself to French cuisine of the highest quality.\n\nSocialising in Derby\n\nCathedral Quarter is at the very heart of Derby, and likely to be on any day trip tour to the city, but make sure you also venture out and explore everything else Derby has to offer!\n\nView the curated collections at Derby Museum and Art Gallery, and keep an eye out for the unique exhibitions\n\nGo to The Flowerpot on curry night and enjoy some live music\n\nYou can’t come to Derby without visiting the 16th century Derby Cathedral\n\nSample the fresh pyclets at the Market Hall, housed in the Grade 2 listed Guildhall\n\nDerby’s very own Rolls-Royce museum has the largest collection of engines on display in the world\n\nSupport Derby’s local dance scene at Déda, maybe even take a circus dance class while you’re there\n\nDarley Park is right on the water, making it the perfect place to enjoy a bit of fresh air\n\nSit back, relax and enjoy the show at Derby Theatre\n\nFootball fans will appreciate a visit to Pride Park Stadium, home to Derby County FC\n\nMoving to Derby\n\nDerby is the perfect place for anyone searching for a city residence only a few miles away from England’s greatest green spaces, and with additional great connections to the rest of the country. Pack your bags, but don’t forget your walking shoes, and come settle down in Derby!\n\n‌"
