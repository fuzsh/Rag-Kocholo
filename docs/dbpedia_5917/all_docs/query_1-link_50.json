I am trying to teach them so if they need help they can give the proper location. Can you help explain so if anyone else is wondering they will know? Thank you.\n\nAnswer: Hello and thank you for the question. One way a person can tell what type of roadway they are on is by the design of the road sign.\n\nHere are some examples that show what interstates, U.S. highways, state highways and county road signs look like.\n\nA portion of state statutes were used with permission from the Office of the Revisor of Statutes. If you have any questions concerning traffic related laws or issues in Minnesota, send your questions to Trp.
