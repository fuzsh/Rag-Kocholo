        "text": "Derby, Bojanala Region\n\nDerby is located about 15 km east of Koster. The town was named after Lord Derby, British secretary of State, and had its origins as a settlement for destitute people.\n\nTowards the end of the Anglo-Boer War the area was the scene for a battle between the Boer forces and a Scottish Calvary Regiment. The graves of the British soldiers who died here may be seen in the Derby's military cemetery."
