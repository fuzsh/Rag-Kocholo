        "text": "Derby, city and unitary authority, geographic and historic county of Derbyshire, England. It lies along the River Derwent at an important route focus at the southern end of the Pennines. The unitary authority covers Derby and its suburbs.\n\nJust northeast of the city centre, at Little Chester, is the Roman site of Derventio. Derby was founded in the 9th century by the Danes as Deoraby, from which the present name is derived. Early royal charters were granted in 1154–56 and 1204. All Saints Church (cathedral from 1927) has a tower 210 feet (64 metres) high that was built in 1509–27. The manufacture of porcelain in the locality began in 1750. After a visit by George III in 1773, the town was granted a patent to mark the china with a crown, and the local product was known thereafter as Crown Derby, amended to Royal Crown Derby by Queen Victoria in 1890. Silk throwing, or spinning by machine, was introduced into the town from Italy in 1719–21.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAnother Great British Vocabulary Quiz, Innit?"
