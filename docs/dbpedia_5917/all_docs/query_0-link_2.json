        "text": "City in Sedgwick County, Kansas\n\nCity in Kansas, United States\n\nDerby is a city in Sedgwick County, Kansas,[1] United States and the largest suburb of Wichita. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 25,625.[3][4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFor many millennia, the Great Plains of North America were inhabited by Native Americans. From the 16th century to the 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau.\n\n19th century\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square miles (2,140,000 km2) Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre.\n\nIn 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1867, Sedgwick County was established within the state of Kansas, which included the land for modern day Derby.\n\nIn 1870, settlers John Haufbauer and J.H. Minich built the first houses, smithies, and general stores on the site that would become Derby.[5] In 1871, the community was named El Paso, after El Paso, Illinois, and was laid out and platted. In 1880, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway changed the name of its rail station to Derby, after railroad official C.F. Derby, to avoid confusion with El Paso, Texas.\n\n20th century\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1903, the city incorporated with the name El Paso,[6] but the city remained largely a rural community until after World War II.\n\nThe aviation industry had begun its growth in Wichita during the 1920s, and when the demands of the war required more airplanes, businesses such as Boeing, Cessna and Beechcraft flourished.[7] Boeing was located a few miles north of the city, which provided a close place for workers to live. Throughout the Cold War, Boeing maintained military contracts and kept jobs nearby.[8] In 1952, the Air Force took over Wichita Municipal Airport and founded McConnell Air Force Base between Wichita and Derby. Many airmen found homes in Derby when space on base became occupied.[9] From 1950 to 1956, the city population grew from 432 to approximately 5000 people.[9]\n\nIn 1956, the city name was officially changed to Derby.[10]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nDerby is located at (37.552407, -97.261492).[11] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 9.60 square miles (24.86 km2), of which 9.56 square miles (24.76 km2) is land and 0.04 square miles (0.10 km2) is water.[12]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nThe climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Derby has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated \"Cfa\" on climate maps.[13]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nDerby operates under the Mayor-Council-Manager form of government, a system that combines strong political leadership of elected officials with strong managerial experience of a professional city manager. In this form of government, Council members and the Mayor are leaders and policy makers elected to represent both their wards and the city as a whole by concentrating on policy issues that are responsive to the needs and wishes of residents. The city manager is hired by the City Council and Mayor to carry out policies, oversee City operations, and ensure that the entire city is being served. The Governing Body establishes goals and policies which the staff executes under the supervision of the city manager. The mayor is elected by the city at large, and eight council members are elected to represent four wards. Elections are nonpartisan and held in November of odd-numbered years.[14]\n\nArea attractions\n\n[edit]\n\nRock River Rapids Aquatic Park, opened in 2004 as Derby Aquatic Park, covers 12 acres (4.9 ha) just off Rock Road. The park has six water slides, a tree-house themed play area, and three heated pools including a zero-depth entry pool, a 603-foot (184 m) lazy river, and a 50-metre (160 ft), eight lane lap pool.[15]\n\nThe Derby Historical Museum is housed in a 1923 school building that served all 12 grades until 1952, when a separate high school was built. The museum houses thousands of historical artifacts, including an 1870 log cabin and one of the largest displayed collections of arrowheads in Kansas. Exhibits at the museum include a school room, a general store that has a collection of antique pharmaceutical items, an original two-horse covered wagon that traveled to the Derby area from North Carolina in the 1860s and so much more.[16]\n\nThe Derby Skate Park has a 9,000 square feet (840 m2) flat deck and nine major concrete deck structures of various shapes and sizes. The other primary element of the park is a deep bowl (four feet) with varied side slopes, including ramps, stairs and rails.[17]\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1890236—1910235—19202475.1%193029419.0%1940256−12.9%195043268.8%19606,4581,394.9%19707,94723.1%19809,78623.1%199014,69950.2%200017,80721.1%201022,15824.4%202025,62515.6%\n\nDerby is part of the Wichita, KS Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2020 United States census counted 25,625 people, 9,991 households, and 6,888 families in Derby.[20][21] The population density was 2,493.4 per square mile (962.7/km2).
