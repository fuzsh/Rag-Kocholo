Main languages in England and Wales\n\nEnglish (English or Welsh in Wales) as a main language\n\nIn England and Wales, 91.1% of usual residents aged three years and over (52.6 million out of 57.7 million) had English (English or Welsh in Wales) as a main language. This is a percentage decrease compared with 2011, when 92.3% (49.8 million) had English (English or Welsh in Wales) as a main language.\n\nIn 2021, a further 7.1% (4.1 million) of the overall population were proficient in English, so they spoke English either \"well\" or \"very well\" (English or Welsh in Wales), but did not speak it as their main language. Additionally, 1.5% (880,000) could not speak English well, and a small percentage (0.3%, 161,000) of the overall population could not speak English at all.\n\nMain languages, other than English (English or Welsh in Wales)\n\nPolish remained the most common main language accounting for 1.1% (612,000) of usual residents, for those who do not have English (English or Welsh in Wales) as a main language.\n\nIn 2021, Romanian moved into the top 10 main languages, excluding English (English or Welsh in Wales). This was the largest increase over the decade. In total, 0.8% of people (472,000) listed Romanian as their main language, up from 0.1% (68,000) in 2011. This mirrors a similar increase in the number of people who listed Romania as their country of birth between 2011 and 2021 (an increase between censuses of 459,000, or a 0.8 percentage point change). It also mirrors an increase in the number who chose only a Romanian national identity (an increase between censuses of 405,000, or a 0.7 percentage point change).\n\nFigure 1: The top ten main languages spoken in England and Wales, excluding English (English or Welsh in Wales)\n\nTotal usual resident population, aged three years and over, who speak each language as their main language, 2011 and 2021, England and Wales\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n3. Main languages varied across England and Wales\n\nEnglish (English or Welsh in Wales) as a main language\n\nThe percentage of people who spoke English (English or Welsh in Wales) as their main language was higher in Wales (96.7%, 2.9 million out of 3.0 million) than it was in England (90.8%, 49.7 million out of 54.7 million).\n\nIn Wales, people were asked if their main language was anything other than English or Welsh. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how many people in Wales consider Welsh to be their main language. There was a separate question for people in Wales asking them about their Welsh language ability. On 6 December 2022, the Welsh Government will be publishing information on Welsh language skills in Wales.\n\nThe region of England with the highest percentage of people with English as a main language was the North East (96.5%, 2.5 million), whereas London had the lowest percentage (78.4%, 6.7 million).\n\nFigure 2: The percentage of people with English (English or Welsh in Wales) as a main language varied across local authorities in England and Wales\n\nPercentage of the usual resident population, aged three years and over, who reported English (English or Welsh in Wales) as a main language, 2021, local authorities in England and Wales\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nSource: Office for National Statistics â€“ Census 2021\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nPolish as a main language across England\n\nIn England, Polish (1.1%, 591,000) was the most common main language for those who did not speak English as a main language. At a regional level, the highest percentage of people who had Polish as a main language was in the East Midlands (1.5%, 71,000). The percentage of people with Polish as a main language varied across local authorities from 0.1% (100) in Castle Point to 5.7% (4,000) in Boston.\n\nRomanian as a main language across England\n\nThe next most common main language in England was Romanian (0.9%, 466,000). The region with the highest percentage of people who reported Romanian as a main language was London (1.9%, 159,000). In particular, the local authority of Harrow had the highest percentage of its population reporting Romanian as a main language (7.5%, 19,000).\n\nPanjabi and Urdu as main languages across England\n\nThe third and fourth most common languages, excluding English, both originate from South Asia: Panjabi (sometimes spelt Punjabi) and Urdu. They are both widely spoken languages in India and Pakistan, as well as elsewhere in South Asia. In England, the highest percentage of people that had Panjabi as a main language was in the West Midlands (1.4%, 83,000). Wolverhampton was the local authority with the largest percentage of people with Panjabi as a main language (6.5%, 17,000). The English region with the overall largest proportion of people who had Urdu as a main language was the North West (0.8%, 59,000). However, Slough in the South East was the local authority with the largest proportion (4.3%, 7,000).\n\nThe most common main languages, other than English or Welsh, in Wales\n\nAs in 2011, Polish was the second most common language after English or Welsh in Wales (0.7%, 21,000). The Welsh local authority with the highest proportion of people that had Polish as a main language remained as Wrexham (2.5%, 3,000).\n\nArabic was the next most common main language in Wales (0.3%, 9,000). The Welsh local authority with the highest proportion of people that had Arabic as a main language was Cardiff (1.4%, 5,000).\n\nFigure 3: Main language spoken, excluding English (English or Welsh in Wales)\n\nPercentage of total usual resident population, aged three years and over, who speak each language as their main language, 2021, local authorities in England and Wales\n\nEmbed code\n\nEmbed this interactive\n\nDownload the data\n\n.xlsx\n\nBritish Sign Language in England and Wales\n\nIn addition to spoken languages, British Sign Language (BSL) was the main language of 22,000 (0.04%) usual residents aged three years and over across England and Wales. This is an increase of over 6,000 since 2011 (15,000, 0.03%).\n\nWithin England, BSL is the main language of just over 21,000 people (0.04%). This percentage is slightly higher than in Wales, where just over 900 people (0.03%) have BSL as a main language. Across the two nations, the area with the highest percentage of people with BSL as their main language was Derby (400, 0.2%), as it had been in 2011 (300, 0.1%). One reason for this could be that the Royal School for the Deaf is situated in Derby, so children have access to both BSL and English. For those who move for educational purposes, they may remain in Derby because of an active Deaf community.\n\nBack to table of contents"
