        "text": "Above all else, Zinab Chahine said, remember to stock up on school supplies early.\n\nChahine came with her first-grade daughter to Earhart Environmental Magnet School on Tuesday for in-person enrollment ahead of Wichita Public Schools’ first day of class, Aug. 14.\n\n“Last year we were late to buy them, and that really bit us in the butt,” she said, “because stores were really sold out of everything — so, get your supplies early, don’t wait to buy them.”\n\nChahine said she sees this as part of her routine each fall as a Wichita Public Schools parent.\n\nShe said she never wants to cause a teacher to spend their own money to ensure her kid has a pencil or notebook.\n\nFind out what your kid needs\n\nTarget, Walmart and other retailers usually have supply lists for local schools. Wichita, Goddard, Derby, Andover and Maize districts all publish complete lists of school supplies.\n\nWichita on the Cheap tracks prices for school supplies and highlights the best deals for lunch boxes, calculators and other items.\n\nWhere to get help with school supplies\n\nHope Wichita plans a school supply giveaway at 7 a.m. Saturday, Aug. 3, at the Newton Chisholm Trail Center, 601 S.E. 36th St. in Newton. No income verification is required.\n\nRock of Christ Church will hold a school supply giveaway at 6 p.m. Wednesday, Aug. 14, at its new location, 1406 W. 18th St. in Wichita. Parents can pick up what they need for free.\n\nAssistance League of Wichita partners throughout August with Wichita Public Schools social workers to provide clothes, backpacks and other items to students in need. Eligible students will be given a date and time to receive their items.\n\nPatterson Legal Group will give away backpacks and school supplies starting at 5:30 p.m. Aug. 27 at Sedgwick County Park, 6501 W. 21st St. North in Wichita. Children must be with an adult to collect a backpack. For info, email givesback@pattersonlegalgroup.com."
