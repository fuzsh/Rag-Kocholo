        "text": "One of the first big sculpture trails to go live this summer was the Derby Ram sculpture trail, where 30 uniquely painted ram sculptures stampeded onto the streets of Derby back in May and will remain in residence till the 22nd August 2021.\n\nAnyone who knows me or has kept up with my blog for any length of time will know how addicted to sculpture trails I am, and as a result I couldn’t wait to zoom on down to Derby to follow the ram trail.\n\nThe 30 baaa-rilliantly bright and colourful rams have formed a nice compact trail around Derby’s city centre and it is easily walkable in a day. So many ‘ramtastic’ puns have provided great ideas for some fantastically creative designs. The whole trail is just spectacular.\n\nAll but two of the rams are located in outdoor locations, so can be seen at any time of day. This means that you can go ram spotting at pretty much any time that suits you. It’s a great evening activity at this time of year with daylight keeping us company till late on.\n\nThe two indoor rams can be found at the main Derbion shopping centre, so just make sure you aim for those during store opening hours and you won’t go far wrong.\n\nAbout the Derby Ram Sculpture Trail\n\nThe Derby Ram trail has been brought to fruition by Derby Museums in partnership with Wild in Art, a leading producer of public arts events. Their aim is to connect businesses, artists and communities through creativity.\n\nTrails such as these help countless people to experience art in non-traditional settings, as the streets of a town or city become transformed into free family friendly outdoor art galleries. Incidentally, it also means that the trails are dog-friendly too if you’re looking for activities you can do with your four-legged friends in tow. It gets people out exercising in the fresh air, therefore proving to be incredibly beneficial to health and well-being.\n\nI particularly love following these trails as it enables me to explore places I may never have discovered without the trail. It is also a great method of boosting the local economy, increasing awareness of and bringing money in to people and places along the trail, and generally increasing tourism to the area.\n\nFinally, trails like these raise vital funds for charitable causes as the sculptures get auctioned off after the trail has finished. The Derby rams will be auctioned on the 9th September 2021 to raise money for Derby Museums which encompass three cultural venues in the city – Derby Museum and Art Gallery, the Museum of Making (at the Silk Mill) and Pickford’s House. You can read all about the latter on my last trip to Derby.\n\nWhy a Ram?\n\nI have followed so many of these kind of sculpture trails in the past and there’s nearly always a link between the place and the sculpture shape chosen.\n\nDerby’s association with the ram started in a traditional English folk song that became popular throughout Britain in the early 18th century. The lyrics which tell the tale of a gargantuan ram – an animal that was worshipped through the generations, mentions Derby as a place in the song.\n\nDue to it’s popularity, the city of Derby adopted the ram as it’s emblem, and it’s been used as a logo and mascot by many local groups ever since, from various military regiments to the professional football team (Derby County FC), who are nicknamed ‘The Rams’.\n\nI remember coming across a huge ram sculpture when I first visited Derby. It can be found at the joining of East Street and Albion Street and was created by Michael Pegler. It is this image that the ram for the sculpture trail was based on and so similarly they are rather stocky figures with huge flowing manes and horns.\n\nOn this trip I also came across a couple of other sheep sculptures: one alongside the river (by ram no.17 on the trail: Come on you Rams!)\n\n…And one by the Poundland entrance into the Derbion shopping centre (by ram no.27 on the trail: Rambo)\n\nNavigating Around the Trail\n\nThe trail is incredibly easy to follow whether you follow it by the map or on the app, which I found to be very accurate. The only issue I had with the app was when trying to find the rams inside the Derbion Shopping centre as I had no phone signal in there. I also wasn’t familiar with the layout of the centre or where different shops were either, so it took me a while to find them both. I’ll give you a clue – one is upstairs, one is downstairs.\n\nThe Rams\n\nRather than talk you around the trail as I usually do and tell you about all the other things I saw along the way, I’m just going to show you some of my favourites, the ones that I smiled at and thought cleverly utilised a ramtastic pun. I’ll pop their trail map numbers in brackets after their name.\n\nI’ll also point out a couple of places you shouldn’t miss while you’re in Derby. So here goes…\n\nCheck out further ideas of things to see and do when you’re in Derby\n\nMy Faves\n\nRameses (no.2)\n\nRameses was the last ram I discovered on the trail and he quickly soared to the top of my faves list. Brightly coloured, fantastic Egyptian inspired patterns in regal reds, blues and lots of gold – I loved Rameses. Linked to the Egyptian Pharoah who lived over 3000 years ago, was a mighty king for 66 years and built stupendous monuments – yes – I’d say he was a suitable subject for a Derby ram.\n\nDerby Industries (no.8)\n\nThis ram is situated near the Silk Mill which is an area of Derby you shouldn’t miss. As well as the Mill itself, home to the Museum of Making, the cathedral is also nearby and the space between, known as both Silk Mill Park and Cathedral Green is a lovely place to sit with a drink or picnic.\n\nI was particularly attracted to this ram’s busy design and subject matter. The artist wanted to show the wealth of engineering history in Derby which even if you knew nothing about before seeing this ram, you’d certainly leave realising Derby has links to the automotive, aeronautic and power generating industries. Its brilliant how the cogs, wheels, fans, motors, turbines and engines – all those circular spinning motion products at the heart of Derby industries are celebrated on the ram’s horns.\n\nGroovy Derby Ram (no.12)\n\nI always love a mosaic sculpture on these trails and the Derby Ram sculpture trail did not disappoint. This time, the mosaic was all mirror just like the ginormous disco ball in nightclubs. Groovy Derby Ram is a tribute to old-school party nights out which Derby was well known for and which many of us look forward to returning to in a post-Covid world.\n\nThe building behind Groovy Derby Ram is the Guildhall and if you walk past that, you’ll come to QUAD, which is currently decorated by the #massisolationFORMAT photo mosaics.\n\nWoolly Rammy – A Ram in Sheep’s Clothing (no.29)\n\nWoolly Rammy really appealed to me, as my favourite thing to see when I’m exploring anywhere new is their architecture. I love beautiful buildings whether it be romantic old buildings and ruins, stupendous cathedrals or quirky modern architecture. As a result, Derby’s street scenes brought to life on Woolly Rammy is 100% my cup of tea!\n\nMake sure you check out St Peter’s Church (pictured behind Woolly Rammy) while you’re passing.\n\nFor All Those About to Rock… (no.26)\n\nThis ram intrigued me and I did have to read the info plaque to find out what the design was all about. His rockin’ tattooed, denim jacket attire celebrates Derbyshire’s popular music festivals, but the patches on the denim jacket actually show significant historical events and Derbyshire related subjects. It’s seemed unusual to see a Battle of Britain patch next to a real ale one for example, but the info supplied made sense of it all.\n\nRoyal Ram (no.28)\n\nThe gorgeous Royal Ram, resplendent in vibrant red, blue and gilt gold work is inspired by Royal Crown Derby’s elaborate animal and bird paperweights. In fact, if he was just a tad smaller, he’d fit right in amongst the menagerie created by the famous ceramics company. With all that gorgeous gold, Royal Ram is a sight for sore eyes that’s for sure!\n\nBee Happy (no.24)\n\nBee related designs are always popular and I don’t think I’ve followed a sculpture trail that hasn’t had one. It’s always good to be reminded of the importance bumblebees bring to our green spaces in pollenating plants, flowers and trees. Bee Happy is so bright and cheerful, both in colour and design that it’s impossible not to smile in his company.\n\nFlamsteed’s Ram (no.15)\n\nI’m not normally keen on very dark sculptures, but the paint job done to the night sky on Flamsteed’s Ram is so impressive, and really stuck in my mind even weeks later.\n\nThe title relates to John Flamsteed who was an astronomer born in Derby, and was appointed as the first Astronomer Royal by King Charles II. Gosh – every day is a school day! The artist hopes her work inspires people to explore their local history and natural wonders.\n\nClever Ram Puns that Play on Words\n\nRam Gogh – Starry Night over the Dales (no.6)\n\nDefinitely painted in Van Gogh style, taking influence from his famous ‘Starry Night’, Ram Gogh depicts a night time scene of the Derbyshire Dales. Such a clever link – I love it!\n\nMondriram (no.5)\n\nAnother arty ram, this time celebrating the typical abstract art created by Piet Mondrian. Straight lines and geometric patterns are filled with blocks of primary colour and white. And this is no easy feat when applying to a 3D curvy canvas, so I was impressed!\n\nAr’baaa’retum (no.18)\n\nA clever play on words here to bring in the classic sheep sound effect and enable the artist to explore Derby’s wonderful arboretum – a place that you won’t see on this trail, but is well worth visiting while you’re in Derby. Also known as Arboretum Park, this green space became the first public park in Britain and amazingly was the model for Central Park in New York. I visited on my last trip to Derby and loved meeting Derby’s wild boar ‘Charlie’ there (yet another intriguing story). I’m glad the artist incorporated him into her design.\n\nRamble (no. 30)\n\nRamble’s design and vibrant green background celebrates the stunning Derbyshire landscape, but with specific reference to the Peak District National Park, a good proportion of which sits in Derbyshire and is the home of many a wonderful ramble or hike.\n\nRandom Access Memory (no.21)\n\nThis design is so cool and the result of a very lateral mind, linking this concept through to the ram figure. I’m not going to even try to describe it any differently to the artist as she sums it up perfectly. “It celebrates the ingenuity of the human brain and refers to a computer’s Random Access Memory.”\n\nThe paint job on the ram’s body is reminiscent of those scientific films you see showing neuron and synapse activity in the brain. The addition of the ravens, one black, one white is a link to Viking Mythology. The God Odin’s ravens, called Muninn and Huginn represent memory and thought respectively.\n\nMy mind boggles at where some of these amazing ideas come from!\n\nPirate Sheepmate (no.10)\n\nYou could tell this chap was a pirate from a distance, but what did a pirate have to do with Derby? It’s only when you looked at his title, that you realised the answer is… nothing, other than a fantastically cheeky play on words. I loved his hooked hoof and parrot sidekick. An excellent addition to the trail!\n\nRambo (no.27)\n\nSimilarly, the army ram in camouflage turned out to be portraying Rambo. I definitely saw a look of Sly Stallone in him, in fact Sly never looked as good! Another jolly fun addition to the Derby ram sculpture trail.\n\nRamtastic (no.1)\n\nI’ve used this word a number of times myself in writing this post. Ramtastic is an explosion of bright bold colours and patterns, in celebration of ‘the rich cultural diversity and talent in the region.’ I couldn’t have put it better myself.\n\nIn fact, I’ve been blown away by the creative talent demonstrated across the whole sculpture trail; not just in the painting skill, but in the creative ideas and concepts explored in the designs. Hats off to everyone who has been involved in pulling this trail together!\n\nSome Random Facts I learnt While Following the Derby Ram Sculpture Trail\n\nAs well as being lots of fun and a great way to exercise, the Derby Ram sculpture trail is also educational and it would seem you’re never too old to learn!\n\nI had no idea Florence Nightingale was from Derbyshire, that the county was home to the first Astronomer Royal, two huge music festivals (both I’d heard of but didn’t know were based in Derbyshire) or such a seat of engineering prowess.\n\nYou do need to read the accompanying info plaques next to the sculptures to find these things out however, so make sure you take the time to do so. They’ll also tell you a bit about the artist too.\n\nSeeing ‘Royal Ram’ also made me want to re-visit Royal Crown Derby, a place I toured around on my last trip to the city to see how the wonderful pottery is made and decorated. There is a fascinating museum onsite too with so many pieces from the past on display and incidentally they also do an excellent afternoon tea in the café there.\n\nSee the Baby Rams at Derby Museum & Art Gallery\n\nMake sure you pop into Derby Museum and Art Gallery while you’re following the trail. As well as some fascinating exhibitions, the galleries are host to many mini rams that have been painted by local school groups. There are several dotted around the various exhibits, but also a set of 15 of them in a display cabinet outside the lift on the top floor.\n\nYou can also pick up printed trail leaflets here as well as other ram-related merchandise. I came home with a pen, fridge magnet and mini figurine to paint myself – Yeah, I couldn’t resist!\n\nI believe there is now full colour trail brochures you can purchase too. Unfortunately, I visited too early in the trail to get one myself.\n\nDerby Ram Sculpture Trail Visitor Information\n\nDates\n\nThe Derby Ram sculpture trail is on from 27th May – 22nd August 2021, so it’s a great (and free) thing to do with children (and dogs) during the summer holidays.\n\nTrail Map\n\nYou can download and print off a copy of the map online and there is a free app to help you locate the rams too!
