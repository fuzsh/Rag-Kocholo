The concept celebrates every aspect of what it means to be from the South with a fresh, modern take on traditional dishes made with locally sourced ingredients. The bar program explores the artistry and history of classic Southern cocktails—everything from barrel-aged cocktails to bottled libations to adult beverages on tap, along with New World wines and craft beers and the “perfect” mint julep.\n\nThe gorgeous top floor space in the Buckhead Village District was designed by New York’s Lacina Heitler, and features classic, Southern touches done in surprising, modern ways: seersucker window treatments, tufted camel leather booths, vintage plateware, white marble countertops, vaulted ceilings, herringbone floors, dramatic chandeliers, complete with an oversized portrait of Mark Twain painted by a commissioned local artist.\n\n“We want this to feel like stepping into our home,” says co-owner Chris Hadermann. “If a friend were visiting Atlanta from New York, we want The Southern Gentleman to feel like the warm, welcoming place you’d want to take them to experience what it means to live the Southern lifestyle—a respect for the familiar traditions, that sophisticated yet unpretentious elegance, but also with a modern edge that makes it exciting and fresh. This is our take on proper Southern hospitality.”"
