I am sure the whole lake knew I got a good one.\" Galesville Reservoir -Photo by Shane Harris-Aug. 14, 2024‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌‌ If there’s not a photo, it didn’t happen Submit your fishing photo  to ODFW and we might use it here or elsewhere on MyODFW.com. Best bets for weekend fishing Even with the hot summer temperatures, anglers are still catching some nice fish in Howard Prairie, Hyatt and Fish lakes, and Lost Creek and Ben Irving reservoirs. The upper Rogue summer steelhead fishery has cooled off a bit but cutthroat and trout fishing are very productive right now. Half-pounder steelhead are starting to move into the lower Rogue. Chinook numbers, and angler success, have been picking up in the Rogue Bay and lower river. Bass fishing has been great in the South Umpqua. On Diamond Lake recently, anglers were averaging one trout per hour, with fly-fishers doing the best. Willow Lake offers fishing for trout and a variety of warmwater species in a beautiful setting. Anglers have been doing well catching plenty of 10-inch trout, with the occasional 14 to 16-incher. Trout stocking Stocked the week of Aug. 12:‌ Rogue River above Lost Creek‌ Recently stocked:‌ Rogue River above Lost Creek‌ Check out the 2024 trout stocking schedule.‌ Trout stocking maps‌ Check out the ODFW fishing and trout stocking maps to find nearby fishing locations, driving directions and descriptions of amenities.‌ Announcements Don't spread the problem, clean your boats and gear‌ A summer continues, weeds are becoming a problem in many area waterbodies. After a day of fun on the water, be sure to clean your boat and gear of weeds and other debris. Some of these weeds may be unwelcome invasives, and harbor other destructive hitchhikers such as New Zealand mud snails and zebra mussels. ‌ 5 tips for fishing in hot water‌ With temperatures soaring to near 100 degrees this weekend, fish will start feeling the heat. Give them a break by following these warm weather fishing guidelines.‌ Fishing during blue-green algae (cyanobacterial) blooms‌ As temperatures heat up during spring and summer, be on the watch for harmful algae blooms when recreating in Oregon lakes, rivers and reservoirs. Before you go fishing, check water quality conditions at the Oregon Health Authority website.‌ Sign up for the latest information on boater access ‌ Marine Board's Opportunities and Access Report incorporates information from federal and state agencies, local facility operators and fellow boaters to provide up-to-date information so boaters can decide where to recreate and what to expect this season. Subscribe to receive email updates.‌ Updates by waterbody AGATE LAKE: bass, carp, crappie, yellow perch, brown bullhead‌ Agate Lake is 44 percent full and anglers fishing around the dam and in the middle of the lake continue to catch bass and crappie. As the lake drops bank anglers will find opportunities for more fish as well. Anglers are encouraged to harvest any carp caught in the reservoir. ‌ The Jackson County Park's day-use area closes after sunset and day use fees are charged. There is a 10-mph speed limit on this reservoir and electric motors only. Last updated 8/14/24.‌ APPLEGATE RESERVOIR: trout, landlocked spring chinook, largemouth bass, small mouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, ‌ Applegate's reservoir level is currently at 1,947 feet or 58 percent full. Check up-to-date reservoir levels here, or call the Army Corps of Engineers at 800-472-2434 for flow and temperature information.‌ All boat ramps are open as well as Hart-Tish. Fishing has been good at Applegate throughout the lake with boat anglers trolling and still fishing picking up larger fish but there are plenty of options for bank anglers that will produce fish. Fishing near the dam in deep water and at the upper end of the lake where the tributaries enter are good bets. Powerbait, night crawlers and spinners are all good techniques. ‌ One angler recently did well at Applegate using a night crawler without weight on the lake bottom and PowerBait with a 12-inch leader.‌ Bass fishing has also been productive for anglers fishing around submerged trees and boulders. Applegate has been stocked with 10,000 legal-sized trout numerous times this year and larger holdover trout are always available. ‌ There is a longstanding health advisory for consumption of resident species due to elevated levels of mercury. See Oregon Health Authority consumption guidelines or the 2022 sportfishing regulations for more information. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ APPLEGATE RIVER below Applegate Dam:‌ The Applegate River is open for trout fishing. This is mainly a catch-and-release fishery for cutthroat. Anglers will find them hanging out in the deep pools spread throughout the river but they're more numerous upstream of the town of Applegate where the water is colder. Only adipose fin clipped rainbow trout may be retained. All wild rainbow and cutthroat trout must be released unharmed. Consult the fishing regulations for more information. Last updated 7/3/24.‌ BEN IRVING RESERVOIR: rainbow trout, bass, bluegill, yellow perch, crappie‌ This should be a good time to fish Ben Irving. Mornings and on cloudy days should be the best time to catch some fish. Also look for areas that may have some cover for the fish. Last update 7/31/24.‌ CHETCO RIVER: cutthroat trout, Chinook‌ The regulations for the salmon in the Chetco River and mainstem until Sept. 1 are zone regulations. Starting Sept.1, the wild Chinook bag limit is reduced to 1 adult per day and 5 for the period. Anglers should always check for updated regulations prior to fishing. Last updated 8/31/24.‌ COOPER CREEK RESERVOIR: rainbow trout, bass, bluegill, and coho smolts‌ The reservoir was last stocked the week of May 22 with legal-size rainbows. Bass fishing should also be good. Water temperature are in the 70s, last week, so early morning fishing should be more successful. Boat anglers are having the most success. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ COOS RIVER BASIN: bottomfish, cutthroat trout, salmon, surfperch‌ Anglers can catch rockfish around the jetties in the lower Coos Bay estuary. Best fishing is typically near slack tides with good fishing one day and fair fishing the next. A jig fished with a twister tail trailer is always a good option to catch bottomfish.‌ The 2024 daily general marine fish bag limit is 5 fish plus 2 lingcod with no retention of yelloweye or quillback rockfish. Anglers are allowed to harvest 1 cabezon per day as part of the general marine fish bag limit. ‌ Salmon anglers are restricted to 2 wild Chinook per day and 10 for the season (July 1 – Dec. 31) in the Coos Basin. A few salmon anglers have been trolling in between the jetties and up the bay around the Chip Pile with limited success.‌ Boat anglers are catching walleye surfperch and pile surfperch using sand shrimp along old pilings or along the edges of eel grass beds. ‌ Trout fishing opened in rivers and streams on May 22. Fishing is restricted to artificial flies and lures in streams above tidewater from May 22 – Aug. 31. With the recent hot weather river temperatures in the larger rivers/streams will be warm and the best fishing will be in the mornings when temperatures are cooler. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ COQUILLE RIVER BASIN: striped bass, smallmouth bass, cutthroat trout‌ Striped bass anglers are fishing the lower mainstem Coquille River but there are a few striped bass still above the town of Coquille.‌ Smallmouth bass are active in the mainstem Coquille River, South Fork Coquille and Middle Fork Coquille. Smallmouth bass can be found throughout the mainstem Coquille but are in higher abundance above Johnson Mill Pond. Anglers targeting smallmouth bass in the upper mainstem Coquille have been successful trolling spinners along the edges of deeper water or by casting and retrieving worms or small twister tail grubs. ‌ There are lots of smallmouth bass in the South Fork Coquille in the deep pools. Most of the fish are under 8 inches long so anglers should use smaller hooks. ‌ The use of spears/spear fishing to harvest smallmouth bass was recently approved and is allowed from June 1 – Oct. 31. Anglers may also use bait in the mainstem Coquille and tributaries from June 1 – Oct. 31. ‌ Trout fishing opened in the rivers and streams on May 22. Water temperatures will be fairly warm in the larger rivers and streams so trout anglers will want to fish smaller streams higher up in the watershed. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ DIAMOND LAKE: trout ‌ Anglers are doing well for rainbow trout. The most recent report had anglers catching at least 1 trout per hour with fly-anglers doing the best. Lure and fly fishing for brown trout also has been good (catch-and-release only) with some anglers catching fish in the 24-inch range.‌ Diamond Lake has been stocked with tiger and brown trout. These fish are intended to assist in controlling illegally introduced tui chub. These trout are catch-and-release only and need to be released immediately and unharmed if caught. Last updated 8/7/24‌ EMIGRANT RESERVOIR: largemouth and smallmouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, brown bullhead, catfish, rainbow trout‌ Emigrant is 25 percent full and water is being released for irrigation season so the water level is steadily decreasing. The main boat ramp is usable. Fishing for bass and panfish is very good at Emigrant right now with good catches of bluegill, black crappie, and both smallmouth and largemouth bass. The water level has dropped below the water level at this point last year, but anglers may want fish near any willow patches that remain watered for best results.‌ Expect warmwater fishing to continue to be good now that summer is here.‌ In addition to warmwater fish, Emigrant has been stocked with 1,000 legal-size trout a few times late in the spring and fishing for these fish and holdover trout has been good. Anglers reported catching a lot of trout recently trolling and still fishing. Expect the trout to move into deeper water around the dam and in the arms with the extreme heat in the forecast.‌ There is a longstanding health advisory for consumption of resident warmwater species in Emigrant for high levels of mercury. Consult the sportfishing regulations or the Oregon Health Authority for more information on consumption guidelines. ‌ The most current elevations for Emigrant Reservoir and other Rogue Basin reservoirs can be found on the Bureau of Reclamation's website, here. Last updated 8/7/24. ‌ EMPIRE LAKE: trout, bluegill, bass‌ Trout anglers in Upper Empire Lake will want to fish around the deepest part of the lake. Fishing will be best in the mornings when water temperatures are the coolest for the day. ‌ There are decent size largemouth bass cruising the edges of the weedlines in Lower Empire Lake. Fishing topwater lures early in the morning or a Senko anytime of the day is a good way to catch bass. Last updated 7/10/24.‌ EXPO POND: rainbow trout, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie‌ Expo Pond is the pond at the Jackson County Fairgrounds located directly adjacent to the access road at Gate 5, at the Southern Oregon RV Park. Expo Pond has been stocked numerous times recently with catchable rainbow trout and anglers report good catches. ‌ Expo and nearby ponds are producing good catches of bass and panfish. Surprisingly, trout fishing continues to be good with fish being caught in the deeper water towards the middle. Anglers looking for a quick trip for some summer trout might want to try casting a spinner like a small rooster tail, or a fly behind a bobber. Still fishing with bait (Powerbait, Pautzke eggs, or worms) is another option.‌ Please remember to park in the day-use parking area and walk into the RV park to access the pond. Do not park your vehicle within the RV park. A Jackson County parks day-use or season-long parking pass is required.‌ There are Chinese mystery snails in the most northern pond. They are highly invasive and were illegally dumped here. Please do not move these creatures and drain and dry any personal watercraft before using them in another waterbody. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ FISH LAKE: rainbow trout, brook trout, spring Chinook ‌ Fish Lake is 59 percent full and anglers continue to do well catching recently stocked trout and holdovers. Additionally, Fish Lake has been stocked with 5,000 legal-size trout numerous times during the spring/early summer so fishing should be good. ‌ Tiger trout have been caught recently, so please remember that any tiger trout caught should be immediately released unharmed. Anglers are encouraged to report their catch or any other fish stories to Rogue Fish District Staff 541-826-8774. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ GALESVILLE RESERVOIR: rainbow trout, bass‌ No recent reports from anglers, but warmwater fishing should be good. The reservoir should be mostly full. Targeting fish towards the head of the reservoir may produce some good results. Last updated 8/7/24‌ HEMLOCK LAKE & LAKE IN THE WOODS (Douglas County): trout‌ Anglers should check with the US Forest Service for fire closures in the area as conditions can change daily. Fishing continues to be good for rainbow trout with lots of large trout stocked this year. Last updated 8/7/24‌ HOWARD PRAIRIE: trout‌ Howard Prairie is 45 percent full. The boat ramp at the marina and the marina are now open. Klum boat ramp is also open as well as the improvised gravel boat ramp at the dam. As of this week, anglers continue to report catching 14- to 18-inch trout but a little less consistently now that summer has set in. Bank anglers wading out from the marina were catching trout last weekend so there are options available for boat and bank anglers still available. Still fishing with PowerBait early in the morning worked well for one angler recently.‌ Techniques include using a green wedding ring spiked with a nightcrawler piece behind a small egg sinker still fishing and trolling. PowerBait, night crawlers and spinners have also been productive. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ HYATT LAKE: trout, largemouth bass ‌ Hyatt is currently 46 percent full. Fishing has been good so far this season at Hyatt and trout continue to bite even with the heat. Powerbait, night crawlers and spinners have all been productive for trout. Boat anglers have had success in the deeper water and bank anglers continue to do well fishing near the dam. Trolling with red or green wedding rings spiked with Power Worms was productive, but the use of a dodger helped. ‌ Anglers are catching largemouth bass, so bass did survive the worst conditions of the current drought cycle a couple of years ago. Most of the bass are small. It will take time for older age classes to dominate the bass fishery again. ‌ Please note that a line of weeds is present between the concrete ramp and the main channel of the lake. Weeds at the surface are generally creating problems for trollers.‌ Please handle fish carefully. ODFW has received reports of anglers at Hyatt wasting smaller trout due to poor handling at release. This is even more important during hot weather. Remember that smaller trout now are the big holdover trout next year. ‌ Wildcat Campground boat ramp is open for sure, and BLM is allowing weekend access to one concrete boat ramp at the main campground. Last updated 7/31/24.‌ ILLINOIS RIVER: ‌ The Illinois River reopened May 22 for trout fishing. Only adipose fin clipped rainbow trout may be retained. All wild rainbow and cutthroat trout must be released unharmed. Consult the fishing regulations for more information and locations open to fishing as the East Fork and West Fork Illinois are CLOSED to angling. Last updated 5/22/24.‌ LAKE MARIE: rainbow trout, yellow perch‌ Lake Marie can be a good option to escape the valley heat. The lake should still be fairly cool and anglers should still be able to catch some trout. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ LAKE SELMAC (Selmac Lake): trout, largemouth bass, bluegill, crappie‌ Selmac was stocked a while ago with 5,000 legal-size rainbow trout but with the warmer weather trout fishing is likely difficult. Largemouth bass, bluegill and black crappie fishing are the best bet right now as these fish are more active with the warm weather.‌ Lake Selmac has its share of non-native aquatic hitchhikers. Boat anglers are asked to do their part to remove as much vegetation as possible before leaving the ramp, as well as drain and dry their vessel before boating in another waterbody.‌ Please help stop the spread of Oregon's aquatic hitchhikers! Last updated 7/17/24.‌ LEMOLO RESERVOIR: brown trout, rainbow trout, kokanee‌ Anglers should check with the US Forest Service for fire closures in the area before going out. Anglers can also contact Lemolo Lake Resort at 541-643-0750 for weather/road conditions and additional information. Trout fishing should still be decent, but air quality may be poor.‌ Kokanee in Lemolo are considered trout and therefore fall under the daily limit for trout of five per day with only one of those measuring over 20-inches. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ LOST CREEK RESERVOIR: rainbow trout, landlocked spring chinook, bass‌ Lost Creek's current elevation is about 1,832 feet or 60 percent full and dropping. The Takelma and Stewart boat ramps are available for access by trailered boats.‌ Trollers have had good success at Lost Creek on holdover and stocked trout using a variety of gear: Apex lures, Brad's cut plug lures with scent, red hoochies, and wedding rings. Trout have been caught at the surface and down to about 50 feet with a downrigger. The lures are often fish behind dodgers, and can be spiked with corn, worms or power worms. Bank fishing on both sides of the dam can be very effective using PowerBait. Stocked spring Chinook are also available but they will be deep and mostly found around Peyton Bridge.‌ Anglers can get the latest reservoir details by calling the US Army Corps Lost Creek Lake and Applegate Reservoir projects information line at 1-800-472-2434. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ PACIFIC OCEAN AND BEACHES: bottomfish, surfperch, salmon‌ Fishing for bottom fish is open to all-depths year-round. The 2024 daily general marine fish bag limit is 5 fish with no retention of quillback or yelloweye rockfish. As of July 1, anglers are allowed to harvest 1 cabezon per day as part of the general marine fish bag limit. Anglers are reporting good catches of rockfish and lingcod near Charleston and Bandon when the ocean swells are small. ‌ Anglers may choose to fish the offshore longleader fishery outside of the 40-fathom regulatory line, which is open year-round. The longleader fishery daily bag limit is 12 fish made of only yellowtail, widow, canary, blue, deacon, redstripe, greenstripe, silvergray, chillipepper, and bocaccio rockfishes. No other rockfish or lingcod are allowed on an offshore longleader fishing trip. Find information about longleader setup and rules here.‌ Ocean salmon fishing is open from Cape Falcon to OR/CA Border for Chinook salmon. The mark-selective coho season is still open from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mt through August 18 or attaining the quota. Ocean salmon anglers are catching a few hatchery coho near Charleston and Winchester Bay. There is still approximately 65 percent of the of the quota remaining for the mark-selective coho season as of Aug. 4. ‌ The Central Coast Subarea (Cape Falcon to Humbug Mt) Summer All-Depth Halibut season is open seven days a week starting on Aug. 1. The Southern Oregon Subarea (Humbug Mt to OR/CA border) Halibut season is open seven days a week with 61 percent of the quota remaining as of July 28. Anglers may harvest 2 Pacific halibut a day in the Central Coast Subarea and Southern Oregon Subarea. ‌ Surfperch anglers are still finding redtail surfperch along the ocean beaches like Horsfall Beach, Bullards Beach and near Cape Blanco. Surfperch anglers are also catching striped surfperch along rocky shorelines. Anglers have been catching surfperch when the ocean swells are calmer, using sand shrimp, mole crabs or artificial sand worms. Ready to try surfperch fishing? Here are some tips to get you started. Last updated 8/7/24. ‌ 2024 sport bottomfish seasons ‌ PLAT I RESERVOIR: trout, bass‌ No recent reports from anglers. It was stocked in April with over 600 trout. Most success will be for warmwater species now. This reservoir is managed for irrigation, so be aware of lowering water levels. Last updated 7/31/24.‌ REINHART PARK POND: trout, bass‌ No recent reports but trout fishing typically tapers off with the warmer weather. Last updated 6/26/24.‌ ROGUE RIVER‌ Rogue River, lower: steelhead, \"half pounder\" steelhead, Chinook‌ Steelhead fishing has been slow in the lower river. \"Half-pounder\" steelhead have started to move upstream. This year the hatchery return of \"half pounders\" is expected to be below average due to fewer fish being released this spring. Half pounders are immature steelhead that return to the river after only a few months in the ocean. These fish usually run 12 to 15 inches. ‌ ODFW annually monitors the run of Chinook, steelhead, and coho at Huntley Park (approximate 8 miles upstream from the mouth) on the Rogue River. To learn more about the project, people can visit the ODFW website to receive this years' two-week updates and to see the historical catch. ‌ Chinook numbers in the bay have picked up and anglers are having pretty good success. Most of the fish are still being caught downstream of Hwy 101. Most anglers are trolling flashers and anchovies, but anglers trolling straight anchovies or putting a spinner blade in front of the anchovy are catching fish. This week the Curry Anadromous Fisherman derby is running from Aug. 7 - 10. Anglers can expect a few more boats on the water.‌ Anglers fishing the Rogue Bay should always check regulations before heading out. This year the ocean is open to salmon fishing through Aug. 31. The regulations on gear type and legal salmon that can be kept is different in the ocean than the river. The two big differences and reasons anglers will get a game violation while fishing in the ocean are 1) fishing with more than two single point hooks in the ocean, barbed hooks in the ocean, and 2) having Chinook salmon under 24 inches in the boat while fishing in the ocean.‌ Anglers fishing with a guide should also understand and know the regulations. The licensed angler will be issued the violation, not the guide. A couple of the most common violations are failure to tag your fish prior to putting your fishing gear out again and continuing to fish after keeping your adult salmon bag limit.‌ Anglers that see a game violation can report the violation to *OSP (*677) on a mobile device or call 1-800-452-7888. Anglers can also file complaints or potential violations concerning guides to the Oregon State Marine Board. Last updated 8/7/24. ‌ Rogue River, middle: steelhead, trout, Chinook‌ Flow in Grants Pass is about 1,900 cfs with a water temperature of around 66F. ‌ There are no reports again this week for this section of the Rogue but summer steelhead and trout are the best bets in this section of the Rogue right now as anglers wait for the arrival of early fall Chinook. A few more summer steelhead have been reported so fly-fishing or a Blue Fox spinner might catch one of those.‌ Anglers are reminded that trout fishing opened back up May 22. Only adipose fin clipped rainbow trout may be retained. All wild rainbow and cutthroat trout must be released unharmed. Consult the fishing regulations for more information. ‌ Current flow, temp and turbidity conditions for the Rogue can be found at the USGS stream gauges here, or checking the City of Grants Pass water page's river data here. Last updated 8/14/24.‌ Rogue River, upper: steelhead, trout‌ The upper Rogue above Dodge Bridge to the hatchery is now closed to Chinook angling. Anglers can still fish for Chinook downstream of Dodge Bridge which should have a few fish available. ‌ Best bets for the upper river are summer steelhead and trout. Fly-fishing and spinners are the preferred methods this time of year. Fishing is a little slow right now for summer steelhead but should get better as we head into August. ‌ The release from Lost Creek is 1,800 CFS and the river temperature is 54F. ‌ Anglers can call the Army Corps of Engineers at 800-472-2434 for an update on hatchery counts as well as flow and temperature information.‌ Make sure to check the Oregon Sport Fishing Regulations for each section of river before you head out. ‌ For up-to-date river levels, check all the USGS Rogue gauges here. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ Rogue River, above Lost Creek Reservoir: trout‌ The Rogue above Lost Creek is open for fishing and with flows dropping fishing has been good. Stocking has taken place and will continue weekly but access to Minnehaha was blocked by downed trees so that site hasn't been stocked yet this year. Check with the Forest Service regarding open campgrounds.‌ The Rogue and tributaries above Lost Creek Reservoir remain open year-round, with a daily retention limit of 5 trout (no limit on brook trout). Last updated 6/12/24.‌ SIXES RIVER: cutthroat trout‌ July and early August is a good time to look for sea-run cutthroat in the lower river. The estuary can become bar bound in late summer due to lower flows and strong north winds, which turns the estuary into a large lake. It can be very windy this time of year, so anglers should check the weather before heading out. Mornings are usually the best. Spinners or fly-fishing are good ways to target these fish. Bait is not allowed upstream of tidewater. Good public access can be had at Cape Blanco State Park Last updated 7/24/24.‌ SMITH RIVER, Umpqua: trout, bass, Chinook‌ Anglers will start targeting Chinook in the lower portion of the river and it should pick up as we get closer to September. Wild coho will only be open in the mainstem Umpqua but not Smith River, starting Sept. 14. ‌ Trout and bass fishing in the upper portion should be good as well. The mainstem above Sisters Cr.is open for trout 2 per day, 8-inch minimum length. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ TENMILE LAKES/TENMILE CREEK: steelhead, trout, bass, yellow perch‌ The water temperature in Tenmile Lakes was in the mid-70s this past week. There are lots of small largemouth bass hanging around the shallow water with an occasional bigger fish. Many of the larger fish have moved to the deeper water along points, drop offs and weedlines.‌ Topwater lures are catching bass in the early mornings, late evening and in shaded areas during mid-day. Deep diving crankbaits, drop shots, jigs, and wacky rigged Senkos are also producing bass throughout the day. ‌ Anglers are catching yellow perch along the weedlines in 9 to 12 feet of water using small jigs or hooks with a worm. Most of the yellow perch are under 6 inches long. ‌ Trout fishing in rivers and streams will opened on May 22. Fishing is restricted to artificial flies and lures in streams above tidewater from May 22 – Aug. 31. Trout fishing in the lakes is open year-round. Anglers are catching trout while fishing for other species. With the warm water temperatures, trout fishing will be best in the mornings. Last updated 8/7/24. ‌ UMPQUA HIKE-IN LAKES AND FOREBAYS: trout‌ No recent angler reports. Anglers are encouraged to report their fishing trips to help guide future stocking rates. ‌ Please check with the US Forest Service for forest fire conditions in the area before adventuring to these lakes.‌ Working with volunteers, stocking has been completed for this year with rainbow fry. Prospective volunteers for stocking in 2025 should contact Levi.m.simmons@odfw.oregon.gov for more information. Last updated 8/7/24‌ UMPQUA RIVER, MAINSTEM: Chinook, surfperch, bass‌ Some anglers are reportedly getting some large smallmouth. Early warm days are a great chance to catch some nice bass. There is no bag limit on bass caught in the Umpqua. There are a few reports of some striped bass being caught in the lower sections.‌ Open for catch-and-release only for trout.‌ The river remains open for hatchery Chinook and one adult wild chinook a day and five adult wild Chinook for the year from July 1 – Nov. 30. Wild coho will open Sept. 14 – Oct. 15. Only one wild adult coho per day and 3 for the season. One wild jack per day during the period. Wild coho may not be retained above the Scottsburg Bridge. Last updated 8/7/24‌ UMPQUA RIVER, NORTH: steelhead‌ Fishing for all Chinook on the North closed July 1. Summer steelhead numbers are around the 10 year average, but very hatchery fish have returned this year. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ UMPQUA RIVER, SOUTH: bass, trout‌ Bass fishing has been great with lots of anglers finding fish throughout. Trout fishing is limited but should be good in areas where there are pockets of cooler water. Last updated 8/7/24.‌ WILLOW LAKE: rainbow trout, largemouth bass, black crappie, brown bullhead, yellow perch‌ Willow Lake offers fishing for trout and a variety of warmwater species in a beautiful setting. Recent reports indicate anglers have been doing well still fishing with bait catching plenty of 10-inch trout along with the occasional 14-16 inch trout. Willow Lake has been stocked numerous times this spring and these fish are still providing a good opportunity for anglers.‌ For more information on camping and day use please visit the Jackson County Parks website or call 541-774-8183. ‌ Anglers catching illegally introduced yellow perch are always encouraged to take as many of these as they want. This illegal introduction has only resulted in stunted perch and negative impacts to the bass and trout fishery in this lake and numerous others around the Southwest District. Last updated 8/14/24.",

Subscribe to receive email updates.‌\n\nUpdates by waterbody\n\nAGATE LAKE: bass, carp, crappie, yellow perch, brown bullhead‌\n\nAgate Lake is 44 percent full and anglers fishing around the dam and in the middle of the lake continue to catch bass and crappie. As the lake drops bank anglers will find opportunities for more fish as well. Anglers are encouraged to harvest any carp caught in the reservoir. ‌\n\nThe Jackson County Park's day-use area closes after sunset and day use fees are charged. There is a 10-mph speed limit on this reservoir and electric motors only. Last updated 8/14/24.‌\n\nAPPLEGATE RESERVOIR: trout, landlocked spring chinook, largemouth bass, small mouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, ‌\n\nApplegate's reservoir level is currently at 1,947 feet or 58 percent full. Check up-to-date reservoir levels here, or call the Army Corps of Engineers at 800-472-2434 for flow and temperature information.‌\n\nAll boat ramps are open as well as Hart-Tish. Fishing has been good at Applegate throughout the lake with boat anglers trolling and still fishing picking up larger fish but there are plenty of options for bank anglers that will produce fish. Fishing near the dam in deep water and at the upper end of the lake where the tributaries enter are good bets. Powerbait, night crawlers and spinners are all good techniques. ‌\n\nOne angler recently did well at Applegate using a night crawler without weight on the lake bottom and PowerBait with a 12-inch leader.‌\n\nBass fishing has also been productive for anglers fishing around submerged trees and boulders. Applegate has been stocked with 10,000 legal-sized trout numerous times this year and larger holdover trout are always available. ‌\n\nThere is a longstanding health advisory for consumption of resident species due to elevated levels of mercury. See Oregon Health Authority consumption guidelines or the 2022 sportfishing regulations for more information. Last updated 8/7/24.‌\n\nAPPLEGATE RIVER below Applegate Dam:‌\n\nThe Applegate River is open for trout fishing. This is mainly a catch-and-release fishery for cutthroat. Anglers will find them hanging out in the deep pools spread throughout the river but they're more numerous upstream of the town of Applegate where the water is colder. Only adipose fin clipped rainbow trout may be retained. All wild rainbow and cutthroat trout must be released unharmed. Consult the fishing regulations for more information. Last updated 7/3/24.‌\n\nBEN IRVING RESERVOIR: rainbow trout, bass, bluegill, yellow perch, crappie‌\n\nThis should be a good time to fish Ben Irving. Mornings and on cloudy days should be the best time to catch some fish. Also look for areas that may have some cover for the fish. Last update 7/31/24.‌\n\nCHETCO RIVER: cutthroat trout, Chinook‌\n\nThe regulations for the salmon in the Chetco River and mainstem until Sept. 1 are zone regulations. Starting Sept.1, the wild Chinook bag limit is reduced to 1 adult per day and 5 for the period. Anglers should always check for updated regulations prior to fishing. Last updated 8/31/24.‌\n\nCOOPER CREEK RESERVOIR: rainbow trout, bass, bluegill, and coho smolts‌\n\nThe reservoir was last stocked the week of May 22 with legal-size rainbows. Bass fishing should also be good. Water temperature are in the 70s, last week, so early morning fishing should be more successful. Boat anglers are having the most success. Last updated 8/7/24.‌\n\nCOOS RIVER BASIN: bottomfish, cutthroat trout, salmon, surfperch‌\n\nAnglers can catch rockfish around the jetties in the lower Coos Bay estuary. Best fishing is typically near slack tides with good fishing one day and fair fishing the next. A jig fished with a twister tail trailer is always a good option to catch bottomfish.‌\n\nThe 2024 daily general marine fish bag limit is 5 fish plus 2 lingcod with no retention of yelloweye or quillback rockfish. Anglers are allowed to harvest 1 cabezon per day as part of the general marine fish bag limit. ‌\n\nSalmon anglers are restricted to 2 wild Chinook per day and 10 for the season (July 1 – Dec. 31) in the Coos Basin. A few salmon anglers have been trolling in between the jetties and up the bay around the Chip Pile with limited success.‌\n\nBoat anglers are catching walleye surfperch and pile surfperch using sand shrimp along old pilings or along the edges of eel grass beds. ‌\n\nTrout fishing opened in rivers and streams on May 22. Fishing is restricted to artificial flies and lures in streams above tidewater from May 22 – Aug. 31. With the recent hot weather river temperatures in the larger rivers/streams will be warm and the best fishing will be in the mornings when temperatures are cooler. Last updated 8/7/24.‌\n\nCOQUILLE RIVER BASIN: striped bass, smallmouth bass, cutthroat trout‌\n\nStriped bass anglers are fishing the lower mainstem Coquille River but there are a few striped bass still above the town of Coquille.‌\n\nSmallmouth bass are active in the mainstem Coquille River, South Fork Coquille and Middle Fork Coquille. Smallmouth bass can be found throughout the mainstem Coquille but are in higher abundance above Johnson Mill Pond. Anglers targeting smallmouth bass in the upper mainstem Coquille have been successful trolling spinners along the edges of deeper water or by casting and retrieving worms or small twister tail grubs. ‌\n\nThere are lots of smallmouth bass in the South Fork Coquille in the deep pools. Most of the fish are under 8 inches long so anglers should use smaller hooks. ‌\n\nThe use of spears/spear fishing to harvest smallmouth bass was recently approved and is allowed from June 1 – Oct. 31. Anglers may also use bait in the mainstem Coquille and tributaries from June 1 – Oct. 31. ‌\n\nTrout fishing opened in the rivers and streams on May 22. Water temperatures will be fairly warm in the larger rivers and streams so trout anglers will want to fish smaller streams higher up in the watershed. Last updated 8/7/24.‌\n\nDIAMOND LAKE: trout ‌\n\nAnglers are doing well for rainbow trout. The most recent report had anglers catching at least 1 trout per hour with fly-anglers doing the best. Lure and fly fishing for brown trout also has been good (catch-and-release only) with some anglers catching fish in the 24-inch range.‌\n\nDiamond Lake has been stocked with tiger and brown trout. These fish are intended to assist in controlling illegally introduced tui chub. These trout are catch-and-release only and need to be released immediately and unharmed if caught. Last updated 8/7/24‌\n\nEMIGRANT RESERVOIR: largemouth and smallmouth bass, black crappie, bluegill, brown bullhead, catfish, rainbow trout‌\n\nEmigrant is 25 percent full and water is being released for irrigation season so the water level is steadily decreasing. The main boat ramp is usable. Fishing for bass and panfish is very good at Emigrant right now with good catches of bluegill, black crappie, and both smallmouth and largemouth bass. The water level has dropped below the water level at this point last year, but anglers may want fish near any willow patches that remain watered for best results.‌\n\nExpect warmwater fishing to continue to be good now that summer is here.‌\n\nIn addition to warmwater fish, Emigrant has been stocked with 1,000 legal-size trout a few times late in the spring and fishing for these fish and holdover trout has been good. Anglers reported catching a lot of trout recently trolling and still fishing. Expect the trout to move into deeper water around the dam and in the arms with the extreme heat in the forecast.‌\n\nThere is a longstanding health advisory for consumption of resident warmwater species in Emigrant for high levels of mercury. Consult the sportfishing regulations or the Oregon Health Authority for more information on consumption guidelines. ‌\n\nThe most current elevations for Emigrant Reservoir and other Rogue Basin reservoirs can be found on the Bureau of Reclamation's website, here. Last updated 8/7/24. ‌\n\nEMPIRE LAKE: trout, bluegill, bass‌\n\nTrout anglers in Upper Empire Lake will want to fish around the deepest part of the lake. Fishing will be best in the mornings when water temperatures are the coolest for the day. ‌\n\nThere are decent size largemouth bass cruising the edges of the weedlines in Lower Empire Lake. Fishing topwater lures early in the morning or a Senko anytime of the day is a good way to catch bass. Last updated 7/10/24.‌\n\nEXPO POND: rainbow trout, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie‌\n\nExpo Pond is the pond at the Jackson County Fairgrounds located directly adjacent to the access road at Gate 5, at the Southern Oregon RV Park. Expo Pond has been stocked numerous times recently with catchable rainbow trout and anglers report good catches. ‌\n\nExpo and nearby ponds are producing good catches of bass and panfish. Surprisingly, trout fishing continues to be good with fish being caught in the deeper water towards the middle. Anglers looking for a quick trip for some summer trout might want to try casting a spinner like a small rooster tail, or a fly behind a bobber. Still fishing with bait (Powerbait, Pautzke eggs, or worms) is another option.‌\n\nPlease remember to park in the day-use parking area and walk into the RV park to access the pond. Do not park your vehicle within the RV park. A Jackson County parks day-use or season-long parking pass is required.‌\n\nThere are Chinese mystery snails in the most northern pond. They are highly invasive and were illegally dumped here. Please do not move these creatures and drain and dry any personal watercraft before using them in another waterbody. Last updated 8/7/24.‌\n\nFISH LAKE: rainbow trout, brook trout, spring Chinook ‌\n\nFish Lake is 59 percent full and anglers continue to do well catching recently stocked trout and holdovers. Additionally, Fish Lake has been stocked with 5,000 legal-size trout numerous times during the spring/early summer so fishing should be good. ‌\n\nTiger trout have been caught recently, so please remember that any tiger trout caught should be immediately released unharmed. Anglers are encouraged to report their catch or any other fish stories to Rogue Fish District Staff 541-826-8774. Last updated 8/7/24.‌\n\nGALESVILLE RESERVOIR: rainbow trout, bass‌\n\nNo recent reports from anglers, but warmwater fishing should be good. The reservoir should be mostly full. Targeting fish towards the head of the reservoir may produce some good results. Last updated 8/7/24‌\n\nHEMLOCK LAKE & LAKE IN THE WOODS (Douglas County): trout‌\n\nAnglers should check with the US Forest Service for fire closures in the area as conditions can change daily. Fishing continues to be good for rainbow trout with lots of large trout stocked this year. Last updated 8/7/24‌\n\nHOWARD PRAIRIE: trout‌\n\nHoward Prairie is 45 percent full. The boat ramp at the marina and the marina are now open. Klum boat ramp is also open as well as the improvised gravel boat ramp at the dam. As of this week, anglers continue to report catching 14- to 18-inch trout but a little less consistently now that summer has set in. Bank anglers wading out from the marina were catching trout last weekend so there are options available for boat and bank anglers still available. Still fishing with PowerBait early in the morning worked well for one angler recently.‌\n\nTechniques include using a green wedding ring spiked with a nightcrawler piece behind a small egg sinker still fishing and trolling. PowerBait, night crawlers and spinners have also been productive. Last updated 8/7/24.‌\n\nHYATT LAKE: trout, largemouth bass ‌\n\nHyatt is currently 46 percent full. Fishing has been good so far this season at Hyatt and trout continue to bite even with the heat. Powerbait, night crawlers and spinners have all been productive for trout. Boat anglers have had success in the deeper water and bank anglers continue to do well fishing near the dam. Trolling with red or green wedding rings spiked with Power Worms was productive, but the use of a dodger helped. ‌\n\nAnglers are catching largemouth bass, so bass did survive the worst conditions of the current drought cycle a couple of years ago. Most of the bass are small. It will take time for older age classes to dominate the bass fishery again. ‌\n\nPlease note that a line of weeds is present between the concrete ramp and the main channel of the lake. Weeds at the surface are generally creating problems for trollers.‌\n\nPlease handle fish carefully. ODFW has received reports of anglers at Hyatt wasting smaller trout due to poor handling at release. This is even more important during hot weather. Remember that smaller trout now are the big holdover trout next year. ‌\n\nWildcat Campground boat ramp is open for sure, and BLM is allowing weekend access to one concrete boat ramp at the main campground. Last updated 7/31/24.‌\n\nILLINOIS RIVER: ‌\n\nThe Illinois River reopened May 22 for trout fishing. Only adipose fin clipped rainbow trout may be retained. All wild rainbow and cutthroat trout must be released unharmed. Consult the fishing regulations for more information and locations open to fishing as the East Fork and West Fork Illinois are CLOSED to angling. Last updated 5/22/24.‌\n\nLAKE MARIE: rainbow trout, yellow perch‌\n\nLake Marie can be a good option to escape the valley heat. The lake should still be fairly cool and anglers should still be able to catch some trout. Last updated 8/7/24.‌\n\nLAKE SELMAC (Selmac Lake): trout, largemouth bass, bluegill, crappie‌\n\nSelmac was stocked a while ago with 5,000 legal-size rainbow trout but with the warmer weather trout fishing is likely difficult. Largemouth bass, bluegill and black crappie fishing are the best bet right now as these fish are more active with the warm weather.‌\n\nLake Selmac has its share of non-native aquatic hitchhikers. Boat anglers are asked to do their part to remove as much vegetation as possible before leaving the ramp, as well as drain and dry their vessel before boating in another waterbody.‌\n\nPlease help stop the spread of Oregon's aquatic hitchhikers! Last updated 7/17/24.‌\n\nLEMOLO RESERVOIR: brown trout, rainbow trout, kokanee‌\n\nAnglers should check with the US Forest Service for fire closures in the area before going out. Anglers can also contact Lemolo Lake Resort at 541-643-0750 for weather/road conditions and additional information. Trout fishing should still be decent, but air quality may be poor.‌\n\nKokanee in Lemolo are considered trout and therefore fall under the daily limit for trout of five per day with only one of those measuring over 20-inches. Last updated 8/7/24.‌\n\nLOST CREEK RESERVOIR: rainbow trout, landlocked spring chinook, bass‌\n\nLost Creek's current elevation is about 1,832 feet or 60 percent full and dropping. The Takelma and Stewart boat ramps are available for access by trailered boats.‌\n\nTrollers have had good success at Lost Creek on holdover and stocked trout using a variety of gear: Apex lures, Brad's cut plug lures with scent, red hoochies, and wedding rings. Trout have been caught at the surface and down to about 50 feet with a downrigger. The lures are often fish behind dodgers, and can be spiked with corn, worms or power worms. Bank fishing on both sides of the dam can be very effective using PowerBait. Stocked spring Chinook are also available but they will be deep and mostly found around Peyton Bridge.‌\n\nAnglers can get the latest reservoir details by calling the US Army Corps Lost Creek Lake and Applegate Reservoir projects information line at 1-800-472-2434. Last updated 8/7/24.‌\n\nPACIFIC OCEAN AND BEACHES: bottomfish, surfperch, salmon‌\n\nFishing for bottom fish is open to all-depths year-round. The 2024 daily general marine fish bag limit is 5 fish with no retention of quillback or yelloweye rockfish. As of July 1, anglers are allowed to harvest 1 cabezon per day as part of the general marine fish bag limit. Anglers are reporting good catches of rockfish and lingcod near Charleston and Bandon when the ocean swells are small. ‌\n\nAnglers may choose to fish the offshore longleader fishery outside of the 40-fathom regulatory line, which is open year-round. The longleader fishery daily bag limit is 12 fish made of only yellowtail, widow, canary, blue, deacon, redstripe, greenstripe, silvergray, chillipepper, and bocaccio rockfishes. No other rockfish or lingcod are allowed on an offshore longleader fishing trip. Find information about longleader setup and rules here.‌\n\nOcean salmon fishing is open from Cape Falcon to OR/CA Border for Chinook salmon. The mark-selective coho season is still open from Cape Falcon to Humbug Mt through August 18 or attaining the quota. Ocean salmon anglers are catching a few hatchery coho near Charleston and Winchester Bay. There is still approximately 65 percent of the of the quota remaining for the mark-selective coho season as of Aug. 4. ‌\n\nThe Central Coast Subarea (Cape Falcon to Humbug Mt) Summer All-Depth Halibut season is open seven days a week starting on Aug. 1. The Southern Oregon Subarea (Humbug Mt to OR/CA border) Halibut season is open seven days a week with 61 percent of the quota remaining as of July 28. Anglers may harvest 2 Pacific halibut a day in the Central Coast Subarea and Southern Oregon Subarea. ‌\n\nSurfperch anglers are still finding redtail surfperch along the ocean beaches like Horsfall Beach, Bullards Beach and near Cape Blanco. Surfperch anglers are also catching striped surfperch along rocky shorelines. Anglers have been catching surfperch when the ocean swells are calmer, using sand shrimp, mole crabs or artificial sand worms. Ready to try surfperch fishing? Here are some tips to get you started. Last updated 8/7/24. ‌\n\n2024 sport bottomfish seasons ‌\n\nPLAT I RESERVOIR: trout, bass‌\n\nNo recent reports from anglers. It was stocked in April with over 600 trout. Most success will be for warmwater species now. This reservoir is managed for irrigation, so be aware of lowering water levels. Last updated 7/31/24.‌\n\nREINHART PARK POND: trout, bass‌\n\nNo recent reports but trout fishing typically tapers off with the warmer weather. Last updated 6/26/24.‌\n\nROGUE RIVER‌\n\nRogue River, lower: steelhead, \"half pounder\" steelhead, Chinook‌\n\nSteelhead fishing has been slow in the lower river. \"Half-pounder\" steelhead have started to move upstream. This year the hatchery return of \"half pounders\" is expected to be below average due to fewer fish being released this spring. Half pounders are immature steelhead that return to the river after only a few months in the ocean. These fish usually run 12 to 15 inches. ‌\n\nODFW annually monitors the run of Chinook, steelhead, and coho at Huntley Park (approximate 8 miles upstream from the mouth) on the Rogue River. To learn more about the project, people can visit the ODFW website to receive this years' two-week updates and to see the historical catch. ‌\n\nChinook numbers in the bay have picked up and anglers are having pretty good success. Most of the fish are still being caught downstream of Hwy 101. Most anglers are trolling flashers and anchovies, but anglers trolling straight anchovies or putting a spinner blade in front of the anchovy are catching fish. This week the Curry Anadromous Fisherman derby is running from Aug. 7 - 10. Anglers can expect a few more boats on the water.‌\n\nAnglers fishing the Rogue Bay should always check regulations before heading out. This year the ocean is open to salmon fishing through Aug. 31. The regulations on gear type and legal salmon that can be kept is different in the ocean than the river. The two big differences and reasons anglers will get a game violation while fishing in the ocean are 1) fishing with more than two single point hooks in the ocean, barbed hooks in the ocean, and 2) having Chinook salmon under 24 inches in the boat while fishing in the ocean.‌\n\nAnglers fishing with a guide should also understand and know the regulations. The licensed angler will be issued the violation, not the guide. A couple of the most common violations are failure to tag your fish prior to putting your fishing gear out again and continuing to fish after keeping your adult salmon bag limit.‌\n\nAnglers that see a game violation can report the violation to *OSP (*677) on a mobile device or call 1-800-452-7888. Anglers can also file complaints or potential violations concerning guides to the Oregon State Marine Board. Last updated 8/7/24. ‌\n\nRogue River, middle: steelhead, trout, Chinook‌\n\nFlow in Grants Pass is about 1,900 cfs with a water temperature of around 66F. ‌\n\nThere are no reports again this week for this section of the Rogue but summer steelhead and trout are the best bets in this section of the Rogue right now as anglers wait for the arrival of early fall Chinook. A few more summer steelhead have been reported so fly-fishing or a Blue Fox spinner might catch one of those.‌\n\nAnglers are reminded that trout fishing opened back up May 22. Only adipose fin clipped rainbow trout may be retained. All wild rainbow and cutthroat trout must be released unharmed. Consult the fishing regulations for more information. ‌\n\nCurrent flow, temp and turbidity conditions for the Rogue can be found at the USGS stream gauges here, or checking the City of Grants Pass water page's river data here. Last updated 8/14/24.‌\n\nRogue River, upper: steelhead, trout‌\n\nThe upper Rogue above Dodge Bridge to the hatchery is now closed to Chinook angling. Anglers can still fish for Chinook downstream of Dodge Bridge which should have a few fish available. ‌\n\nBest bets for the upper river are summer steelhead and trout. Fly-fishing and spinners are the preferred methods this time of year. Fishing is a little slow right now for summer steelhead but should get better as we head into August. ‌\n\nThe release from Lost Creek is 1,800 CFS and the river temperature is 54F. ‌\n\nAnglers can call the Army Corps of Engineers at 800-472-2434 for an update on hatchery counts as well as flow and temperature information.‌\n\nMake sure to check the Oregon Sport Fishing Regulations for each section of river before you head out. ‌\n\nFor up-to-date river levels, check all the USGS Rogue gauges here. Last updated 8/7/24.‌\n\nRogue River, above Lost Creek Reservoir: trout‌\n\nThe Rogue above Lost Creek is open for fishing and with flows dropping fishing has been good. Stocking has taken place and will continue weekly but access to Minnehaha was blocked by downed trees so that site hasn't been stocked yet this year. Check with the Forest Service regarding open campgrounds.‌\n\nThe Rogue and tributaries above Lost Creek Reservoir remain open year-round, with a daily retention limit of 5 trout (no limit on brook trout). Last updated 6/12/24.‌\n\nSIXES RIVER: cutthroat trout‌\n\nJuly and early August is a good time to look for sea-run cutthroat in the lower river. The estuary can become bar bound in late summer due to lower flows and strong north winds, which turns the estuary into a large lake. It can be very windy this time of year, so anglers should check the weather before heading out. Mornings are usually the best. Spinners or fly-fishing are good ways to target these fish. Bait is not allowed upstream of tidewater. Good public access can be had at Cape Blanco State Park Last updated 7/24/24.‌\n\nSMITH RIVER, Umpqua: trout, bass, Chinook‌\n\nAnglers will start targeting Chinook in the lower portion of the river and it should pick up as we get closer to September. Wild coho will only be open in the mainstem Umpqua but not Smith River, starting Sept. 14. ‌\n\nTrout and bass fishing in the upper portion should be good as well. The mainstem above Sisters Cr.is open for trout 2 per day, 8-inch minimum length. Last updated 8/7/24.‌\n\nTENMILE LAKES/TENMILE CREEK: steelhead, trout, bass, yellow perch‌\n\nThe water temperature in Tenmile Lakes was in the mid-70s this past week. There are lots of small largemouth bass hanging around the shallow water with an occasional bigger fish. Many of the larger fish have moved to the deeper water along points, drop offs and weedlines.‌\n\nTopwater lures are catching bass in the early mornings, late evening and in shaded areas during mid-day. Deep diving crankbaits, drop shots, jigs, and wacky rigged Senkos are also producing bass throughout the day. ‌\n\nAnglers are catching yellow perch along the weedlines in 9 to 12 feet of water using small jigs or hooks with a worm. Most of the yellow perch are under 6 inches long. ‌\n\nTrout fishing in rivers and streams will opened on May 22. Fishing is restricted to artificial flies and lures in streams above tidewater from May 22 – Aug. 31. Trout fishing in the lakes is open year-round. Anglers are catching trout while fishing for other species. With the warm water temperatures, trout fishing will be best in the mornings. Last updated 8/7/24. ‌\n\nUMPQUA HIKE-IN LAKES AND FOREBAYS: trout‌\n\nNo recent angler reports. Anglers are encouraged to report their fishing trips to help guide future stocking rates. ‌\n\nPlease check with the US Forest Service for forest fire conditions in the area before adventuring to these lakes.‌\n\nWorking with volunteers, stocking has been completed for this year with rainbow fry. Prospective volunteers for stocking in 2025 should contact Levi.m.simmons@odfw.oregon.gov for more information. Last updated 8/7/24‌\n\nUMPQUA RIVER, MAINSTEM: Chinook, surfperch, bass‌\n\nSome anglers are reportedly getting some large smallmouth. Early warm days are a great chance to catch some nice bass. There is no bag limit on bass caught in the Umpqua. There are a few reports of some striped bass being caught in the lower sections.‌\n\nOpen for catch-and-release only for trout.‌\n\nThe river remains open for hatchery Chinook and one adult wild chinook a day and five adult wild Chinook for the year from July 1 – Nov. 30. Wild coho will open Sept. 14 – Oct. 15. Only one wild adult coho per day and 3 for the season. One wild jack per day during the period. Wild coho may not be retained above the Scottsburg Bridge. Last updated 8/7/24‌\n\nUMPQUA RIVER, NORTH: steelhead‌\n\nFishing for all Chinook on the North closed July 1. Summer steelhead numbers are around the 10 year average, but very hatchery fish have returned this year. Last updated 8/7/24.‌\n\nUMPQUA RIVER, SOUTH: bass, trout‌\n\nBass fishing has been great with lots of anglers finding fish throughout. Trout fishing is limited but should be good in areas where there are pockets of cooler water. Last updated 8/7/24.‌\n\nWILLOW LAKE: rainbow trout, largemouth bass, black crappie, brown bullhead, yellow perch‌\n\nWillow Lake offers fishing for trout and a variety of warmwater species in a beautiful setting. Recent reports indicate anglers have been doing well still fishing with bait catching plenty of 10-inch trout along with the occasional 14-16 inch trout. Willow Lake has been stocked numerous times this spring and these fish are still providing a good opportunity for anglers.‌\n\nFor more information on camping and day use please visit the Jackson County Parks website or call 541-774-8183. ‌\n\nAnglers catching illegally introduced yellow perch are always encouraged to take as many of these as they want. This illegal introduction has only resulted in stunted perch and negative impacts to the bass and trout fishery in this lake and numerous others around the Southwest District. Last updated 8/14/24."
