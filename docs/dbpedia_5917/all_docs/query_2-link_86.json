        "text": "Derby is a much underrated city. It might not be an obvious choice for a short break but here’s why I think it’s a great weekend destination. Whether you’re looking for family friendly activities, culture and history or just places to eat and drink, there are so many great things to do in Derby.\n\nSituated in the East Midlands, Derby is easily accessible both by car (junction 25 of the M1) and by public transport. This makes it a perfect destination for meeting up with friends and family as restrictions ease and things start opening up.\n\nHere’s my edit of the very best things to do in Derby…\n\nThe Cathedral Quarter for beautiful architecture and independent shopping\n\nThe Cathedral Quarter is one of the most desirable and attractive parts of Derby. It’s a great place to start if you are new to the city. Irongate and Sadler Gate are both worth a wander for their wealth of lovely, local, independent shops. Don’t miss the Strand Arcade, a lovely historic shopping precinct which connects Sadler Gate to The Strand, is a delightful Victorian crescent, also home to many fabulous independents.\n\nFor serious shopping, head to the Derbion shopping centre which has big name department stores as well as quirky independents like Design 44.\n\nEat at Bustler street food market\n\nBustler is Derby’s much loved street food market, hosting an exciting selection of the very best street food vendors. There’s always a good selection of vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options. There’s usually a great atmosphere courtesy of DJ’s, craft beer, cocktails and usually a play area for children. It’s recently moved venues to just slightly out of town and now has Derby’s biggest beer garden. Open the last weekend each month and weekends throughout the summer. Family friendly and dog friendly.\n\nClick to read the Ultimate Guide to the Best Derbyshire Restaurants.\n\nDarley Abbey for discerning nightlife\n\nDarley Abbey is an attractive former historic mill village, now a suburb of the city of Derby. It’s about a mile and a half from the city centre so may involve a short taxi ride out particularly if you’re in heels, but this is a fabulous place to eat and drink. The Darley Abbey Mills complex is a UNESCO World Heritage site so has a wonderful ambiance, particularly on a balmy summer’s evening.\n\nFor Michelin recommended fine dining, Darleys has recently had new owners and been completely renovated. Both the restaurant and it’s terrace both enjoy wonderful views of the River Derwent. Check out Darley Abbey Wines for a glass of something great and handmade pizza.\n\nFor my guide to the best independent cocktail bars in Derby click here.\n\nReal ale pubs\n\nAccording to Derby CAMRA, the city has one of most diverse selection of real ales in served across a collection of differing pubs in the whole of the country. Derby has an impressive number of brew-pubs, including the Brunswick Inn, a previous CAMRA pub of the year. The Seven Stars is another traditional, historical pub. Derby’s oldest pub is Ye Olde Dolphin Inn which dates back to the 16th century and is rumoured to be haunted.\n\nCulture and History\n\nThe Museum of Making is a populat attraction in Derby city centre located at the Silk Mill, widely regarded as the world’s first modern factory. It’s also part of the Derwent Valley Mills UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is a great place to learn about Derby’s fascinating history and role in the industrial revolution. Entry is free. Closed Mondays.\n\nHistory buffs might also wish to explore Derby Cathedral. In normal times it’s possible to climb the 189 steps to see spectacular views of Derby and the surrounding four counties.\n\nDerby Museum and Art Gallery is free to visit, as is the QUAD, an international centre for engagement in contemporary art and film.\n\nGhoulishly good things to do in Derby\n\nDerby Gaol (jail) is rumoured to be one of the most haunted spots in the country. It’s now museum open to the public every Saturday, 11am to 3pm. Since its construction in 1756 it’s been through several incarnations (including a nightclub) until it was bought in 1997 by paranormal investigator, and dedicated historian Richard Felix who has returned it as far as possible to its original state. Richard also runs a range of ghost walks around Derby, or if you’re feeling particularly brave you can take part in an overnight vigil at the jail.\n\nParks\n\nDerby boasts several lovely parks. Derby Arboretum was the first public park in Britain and influenced the design of the world famous Central Park in New York. Darley Park is in walking distance of the city centre and Markeaton Park has good play facilities – read more about this and more of Derbyshire’s best playgrounds here. There’s more detailed information on Derby’s parks and open space here.\n\nFamily friendly things to do in Derby\n\nThere are numerous ways to keep the kids and whole family entertained in Derby. We particularly like Injoy Derby, a state of the art, indoor play centre that is so much more than just soft play (although the soft play bit is amazing!). There’s an indoor climbing wall and the UK’s first ‘interactive zone’ and a decent café. In fact it’s a perfect rainy day activity.\n\nIt’s worth seeing what’s on at Derby Museum and Art Gallery and/or the Quad as both regularly having visiting family friendly exhibitions and activities, as does the Derbyion shopping centre.\n\nCheck out this brilliant blog post for a more detailed look at Derby’s most family friendly attractions.\n\nThere’s also a range of family friendly attractions a short drive from the city centre such as Bluebells Farm, Crich Tramway Museum and the other places listed below.\n\nEvents in Derby\n\nDerby has a range of live venues like The Flowerpot and Derby Arena. Every year Darley Park hosts a classical music concert on the last Sunday in August which culminates in a spectacular firework display.\n\nWhat’s On Derbyshire 2023 Events Guide\n\nWhere to eat and drink in Derby\n\nClick here for my round up of my all time favourite Derbyshire restaurants. In the city centre I’d particularly recommend The Dining Room for delicious bistro style food and the QUAD café bar for family friendly, accessible and inclusive all day menu.\n\nJust outside the city centre, check out The Palfrey in Milford, Kedleston Country House and The Pattenmakers Arms in Duffield.\n\nOther places to explore near Derby\n\nDerby is not far at all from the world renowned beauty of the Peak District. From Derby city centre, you can be in the most stunning scenery of the Peak District National Park in less than an hour. Read about my favourite places in and around the Peak District here.\n\nThere are also plenty of picturesque villages on the outskirts of Derby to explore, such as Ockbrook, Duffield or the pretty market town of Ashbourne.\n\nThere are several lovely National Trust properties near Derby including Kedleston Hall (read a great review of Kedleston Hall from fellow blogger, Castles and Turrets here), Calke Abbey and Sudbury Hall.\n\nWhere to stay in Derby\n\nMorley Hayes is located just outside Derby is a tranquil country hideaway. Situated on a golf course it’s a relaxing base to explore the city centre from. I stayed here the night before my wedding and the rooms and service are just lovely.\n\nPenta Hotel is a contemporary hotel located on Pride Park. This is a great location for Derby Arena and walking distance to the city centre. If you stay here, Seven at Pride Park is a good restaurant for cocktails and eating throughout the day and evening.\n\nI haven’t yet stayed but The Coach House is a stylishly decorated B&B, conveniently located particularly if you wanted to be based near Darley Abbey (great for bars, restaurants; walks and historic architecture)\n\nLeonardo Hotel Derby (previously Jurys Inn) is a chain hotel but in a great location for the cathedral quarter which is only a short walk away.\n\nAlternatively, why not explore nearby Nottingham? Here’s a great local’s guide of how to spend a weekend in Nottingham. Or, family friendly farms in the Midlands.\n\nIf you’ve enjoyed reading this, please check out my edit of the 22 best beer gardens, cafés and restaurants with outdoor seating in Derbyshire or the best coffee shops to combine with a walk in Derbyshire.\n\nSign up for our newsletter for exclusive content and offers.
