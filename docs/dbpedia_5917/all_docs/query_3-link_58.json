Overlooking the district in the south-east are the uplands of Charnwood Forest, a region of numerous craggy exposures that reveal a predominantly volcaniclastic sequence, derived by eruptions from a volcanic arc that was active in Precambrian times, over 600 million years ago. Cambrian rocks are present, although very poorly exposed, on the eastern side of Charnwood Forest, and have been proved in a single borehole farther north, near Ticknall. Together with the Precambrian rocks they were folded, cleaved and mildly metamorphosed during the Acadian (Siluro-Devonian) orogeny. Mainly Carboniferous and Triassic strata occupy the remainder of the map area, with outliers of Lower Jurassic rocks in the extreme east. In many parts of the district, however, superficial Quaternary deposits cover the bedrock.\n\nInliers of Lower Carboniferous (Chadian to Brigantian) dolostones that include Breedon Hill are part of a largely concealed, highly variable Dinantian sequence for which a new stratigraphy has been erected. Data from boreholes and seismic records show that the Dinantian attains over 5 km thickness within the concealed Widmerpool half-graben (or ‘gulf’). Sandstones in the overlying Millstone Grit Group are part of a Namurian deltaic sequence, which can be correlated on faunal grounds with that of north Derbyshire. Stratigraphical correlations within the overlying Coal measures, and their complex structure, are discussed for the North-west Leicestershire and South Derbyshire coalfields, and the extent of the economically important fireclay resource in the South Derbyshire Coalfield is highlighted.\n\nThe result of Variscan (end-Carboniferous) deformation is spectacularly demonstrated by the uplift of Precambrian rocks against the Coal Measures along the Thringstone Fault, and by the vertical attitudes of Dinantian strata in quarries around Breedon on the Hill. Other fundamental structures of this age, and reactivated Acadian lineaments, are revealed by utilising surface observations allied to seismic interpretations and geophysical (aeromagnetic and gravity) modelling.\n\nTriassic strata are shown to have overstepped on to a locally mountainous land-surface chiefly formed during a period of about 60 million years of erosion spanning the Permian. They commence with the Sherwood Sandstone Group, representing the deposits of former river systems and constituting a regionally important aquifer. By contrast, the overlying Mercia Mudstone Group was mainly deposited in aeolian and playa lake environments; it locally contains thick gypsum seams that have been mined underground. Rhaetianage marine beds of the Penarth Group, and the overlying Jurassic mudstones and limestones of the Lias Group, complete the preserved bedrock sequence.\n\nQuaternary deposits include two varieties of Anglian-age till: red, Triassic-rich Thrussington Till and grey, chalky, Jurassic and Cretaceous-derived Oadby Till. Till forms a patchy cover and, together with thick developments of glaciolacustrine clay, also occurs within narrow tunnel valleys. Sustained uplift through the Anglian and Flandrian stages resulted in at least six generations of river terrace deposits in the trunk valleys. These complex deposits represent an aggregate resource and are also important suppliers of water in the district.\n\nThere is an impressive diversity of metalliferous minerals, but current economic value comes from ‘hard rock’, limestone, sand and gravel, coal, fireclay and gypsum. The legacy of centuries of mining or quarrying is, unfortunately, large areas of artificially changed ground. Geology has an important role to play, not only in delineating already despoiled land, but in predicting the constraints that the rocks and superficial deposits of the district may pose to further development.\n\n(Table 1) Geological succession of the Loughborough district.\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n\nThe Loughborough district (Figure 1) lies mainly within the Northwest Leicestershire and South Derbyshire administrative areas, but also includes small parts of Staffordshire in the west and Nottinghamshire in the northeast. The main population centres of Derby, Long Eaton, Burton upon Trent, Loughborough, Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Melbourne, Swadlincote and Church Gresley conurbations are separated by agricultural land, which include the flood-prone valley floors of the Trent, Derwent and Soar Rivers (Figure 2).\n\nOver 600 million years of geological history are represented in this district, by rocks that form the sequence summarised in (Table 1). The distribution of the main rock groupings is indicated in (Figure 1), which also shows those units of particular economic or environmental significance, for example the Cropwell Bishop Formation. The southeast margin of the district lies on the edge of Charnwood Forest, a hilly terrain of craggy knolls, rough pasture and heathland that rises to just over 210 m maximum elevation on Ratchet Hill [SK 4467 1635]. Late Precambrian volcaniclastic rocks of the Charnian Supergroup underlie this ground, and because of their resistance to erosion they form a fossil hill range that is now being exhumed from beneath a variably thick cover of Triassic strata and drift. A younger component of this ‘basement’ are the marine mudstones of the Cambrian-Ordovician Stockingford Shale Group, which are inferred to be the principal sub-Carboniferous unit to the north and west of Charnwood Forest. These strata are not exposed, but have been proved in the Ticknall Borehole , drilled in support of this resurvey. The earliest recorded Charnian uplift dates from the Acadian orogeny of Silurian–Devonian times, when these sequences were cleaved and folded. Dinantian (‘Carboniferous Limestone’) strata form undulating country around Ticknall and appear as a line of smaller inliers farther east; they are locally tilted to the vertical, and protrude through the mantling Trias to form the spectacular landmark of Breedon Hill (Front cover), rising to 125 m OD. The Dinantian sequence thickens to over 5 km north-east of the Normanton Hills Fault. The succeeding Millstone Grit of Namurian age comprises fluvio-deltaic sandstones and siltstones intercalated with mudstones, and gives rise to a scarp and dip-slope topography around Melbourne. Westphalian strata of the Coal Measures are mainly preserved to the south-west of the Thringstone Fault in the Northwest Leicestershire and South Derbyshire coalfields. Their content of minerals such as coal, ironstone and fireclay contributed to the early growth of the urban centres, and the various phases of mining activity have also profoundly affected much of the land surface on the Productive Measures outcrop. However, today such extraction is limited to two opencast sites.\n\nOverlying the faulted and eroded pre-Mesozoic rocks at the depth are late Permian strata of the Edlington Formation and the Permo-Triassic Lenton Sandstone Formation. The Moira Formation is regarded as a highly diachronous, Permo-Triassic basal lag deposit. The oldest truly Triassic-age strata, of the Sherwood Sandstone Group, give rise to undulating ground in the central and south-western parts; they comprise the conglomeratic Polesworth Formation and fine-grained Bromsgrove Sandstone Formation, which are both major aquifers in the district. Prominent outliers of the group commonly form steep-sided plateaux where preserved on the Coal Measures, as at Pistern Hill [SK 342 208]. Red, argillaceous strata of the succeeding Mercia Mudstone Group are the most widespread Triassic rocks and form a gently undulating, dissected terrain in the central and northern parts of the district. They include the Cropwell Bishop Formation which has been locally exploited for its thick seams of gypsum, and which can also give rise to hazardous ground in areas where the gypsum seams have dissolved at or near to the surface. The youngest bedrock components represent a reversion to marine conditions. These are mudstones, sandstones and limestones of the Penarth Group, and the overlying flaggy limestones and mudstones of the Barnstone Member (largely Jurassic in age) at the base of Lias Group. They form distinctive, steep-sided plateaux dominating the eastern margin of the district.\n\nUnconsolidated deposits of Quaternary drift are patchily developed. The oldest drift deposits are referred to the Anglian glaciation of about 440 000 years ago, and mainly form veneers to the bedrock on the wider interfluves, or are preserved in palaeochannels. They comprise the Thrussington Till which is red in colour and rich in Triassic debris and the Oadby Till which is brown to grey with chalk and flint debris. Locally abundant are sands and gravels comprising glaciofluvial deposits, and clays and silts of glaciolacustrine origin. The most extensive Quaternary sequences either floor the trunk valleys or underlie terraces that flank them. In the former situation they were thought to consist mainly of modern alluvium, but this re-survey has proved that other river terrace deposits predominate. These are locally thick and constitute a major resource of sand and gravel in the district.\n\nHistory of survey and research\n\nThe district was originally surveyed on the 1:63 360 scale by A C Ramsay, H H Howell and E Hull and published on the old series sheets 62, 63, 71 and 72 in 1852 and 1855. The primary survey at the 1:10 560 scale, by C Fox-Strangways and W W Watts, was published as a Solid and Drift edition in 1904. The Carboniferous rocks were revised and other amendments made by G H Mitchell, leading to the publication in 1950 of a second map version. A brief account of the district is given by Fox-Strangways (1905). Many of the earlier accounts concentrated on the coalfields (Hull, 1860; Fox-Strangways, 1907), which continued to be the main subject of later work by Mitchell and Stubblefield (1948) and Spink (1965). The Charnian Precambrian rocks have had a long history of research, summarised by Ford (1979) and Watts (1947), the latter work classically illustrating the geology as then known. During the post-war years surveys for hydrocarbons have provided comprehensive information on the shallow seismic structure and lithostratigraphy for the central and north-eastern parts of the district; the principal findings are discussed in Falcon and Kent (1960) and Fraser and Gawthorpe (1990).\n\nThe latest phase of re-mapping started in 1964–74, with a survey along the northern margin of the district at the 1:10 560 scale by D V Frost and J G O Smart as part of the Sheet mapping programme for Sheet 125 Derby, and on the southern margin, parts of sheets SK 21 NE, 31 NW, 41 NE and 51 NW were mapped by B C Worssam and R A Old during the resurvey of Sheet 155 Coalville. A. Horton also carried out limited mapping in association with the construction of the Melbourne Dam and Staunton Harold Reservoir, located at the northern end of Staunton Harold Reservoir. The first 1:10 000 scale resurvey was carried out by A S Howard, in 1987. The remaining 1:10 000 series sheets were completed between 1993 and 1996 by the survey staff indicated in (Table 7). This final phase, supported by the drilling of two stratigraphical boreholes, involved researchers from a wide range of geological disciplines both within and outside the BGS. Some of this work was still on-going at the time of writing, but much is also reviewed in the pages that follow.\n\nChapter 2 Precambrian\n\nThe Precambrian rocks represent an uplifted segment of the cratonic basement which otherwise deeply underlies this part of the English Midlands (Pharaoh et al., 1987a). They are the remnants of a latest Precambrian (Neoproterozoic III) volcanic arc, and are divisible into the bedded volcaniclastic sequence of the Charnian Supergroup, and a suite of later intrusions - the North Charnwood Diorites. These rocks are typically developed within Charnwood Forest, but they are also present farther north beneath a thin Triassic cover. They are exposed in an inlier east of Grace Dieu Brook [SK 4397 1880], and were proved below Triassic strata at 74.2 m depth in the Belton Borehole. However, the Precambrian rocks, as the immediate (pre-Carboniferous or pre-Triassic) basement, are terminated by major concealed faults within several hundred metres north of the Charnwood Forest upland (see Chapter 10). The Precambrian outcrop extends for 10 km south-east of the Loughborough sheet margin, into the Coalville district (Worssam and Old, 1988). It is limited to the west by the Thringstone Fault, and to the south and east by the south-eastward plunge of the anticline that folds the Charnian sequence (Chapter 9).\n\nThe geochemistry of the Charnian Supergroup and its associated intrusions is directly comparable with Precambrian volcanic arc rocks of the Nuneaton inlier, located 23 km to the south-west (Bridge et al., 1998). All of these Precambrian occurrences must therefore have originally formed part of a single volcanic system which is now incorporated into the basement and is termed the ‘Charnwood Terrane’ by Pharaoh et al. (1987b).\n\nPrecambrian volcanic rocks are also proved in the Orton and Glinton boreholes, to the south-east of the Loughborough district, as discussed further below. Their chemistry does not compare with that of the Charnian Supergroup, however, and they may belong to a separate volcanic arc terrane (Noble at al., 1993).\n\nCharnian Supergroup\n\nThe lithostratigraphical scheme for the supergroup followed here (Table 2) is based on the terminology of Watts (1947) that was formalised by Moseley and Ford (1985) and modified further by Carney (1994), who gave details of most exposures in the district. All three Charnian groups are represented; they crop out in the south-east of the district in a south-east plunging anticline. The various components of the supergroup are only exposed intermittently but their inferred distribution beneath younger cover is shown in (Figure 3). The supergroup has an aggregate thickness of at least 3800 m in the district, with no base proved.\n\nThe volcanic provenance of the Charnian Supergroup has long been recognised (see Watts, 1947 and references in Ford, 1979). Chemical analyses of the primary volcanic components show that the parental magmas were calcalkaline, similar to those of modern evolved volcanic arcs founded upon oceanic or attenuated continental crust (Pharaoh et al., 1987b). Many modern intra-oceanic arc systems are largely submerged, and consequently it is the fragmental material, either eroded or ejected from the volcanic axis, that is the most likely to be preserved in the depositional basins that surround the arc. This explains why the Charnian is composed mainly of well-stratified volcaniclastic lithologies, with only a subordinate amount of primary pyroclastic rocks (terminology of Fisher and Schmincke, 1984). The general absence of cross-bedding or wave-generated structures indicates that deposition was primarily below storm wave base; other structures, such as grading, suggest that sedimentation was by debris flows, pyroclastic flows and sediment-laden turbidity currents flowing into basins that were marginal to the active volcanoes (Carney, 1999). In the north-west of Charnwood Forest a different lithological assemblage, of subvolcanic intrusions and/or domes (Whitwick Volcanic Complex) associated with very coarse-grained volcanic breccias, indicates that later in the Charnian cycle of magmatism, active volcanic centres had migrated into the district.\n\nA late Precambrian (Neoproterozoic III) age for the extrusive phase of the Charnian arc is indicated by Ediacaran fossils, which are found throughout the sequence in this and the Coalville districts (Boynton and Ford, 1995, 1996). However, the precise age of this magmatism is currently controversial. Previous studies, based on K-Ar and Rb-Sr isotope systems, were carried out by Meneisy and Miller (1963) and Cribb (1975). The latter concluded on the basis of Rb-Sr ratios that the South Charnwood Diorites (markfieldites), emplaced within the Charnian Supergroup to the south of this district, were 552 ±58 Ma old, but the large error range renders this age difficult to interpret. For the North Charnwood Diorites, outcropping in this district, Cribb returned an age of 311 ± 92 Ma which is clearly at odds with the fact that the intrusions predate a cleavage deformation now known to be Acadian (Siluro-Devonian) in age (Chapter 9). Indirect evidence for an upper age limit comes from lithological and geochemical correlations between the South Charnwood Diorites and the similar granophyric-textured diorite intruded into volcaniclastic rocks of ‘Charnian’ type in the Nuneaton inlier, about 33 km south-south-west of this district (Bridge et al., 1998). The Nuneaton granophyric diorite has been radiometrically dated by the U-Pb method, yielding an age of 603 ± 2 Ma (Tucker and Pharaoh, 1991). According to McIlroy et al. (1998), however, this is rather older than the value of 580 Ma currently favoured for the base of the fossil-bearing Ediacarian subdivision of the Neoproterozoic, and it therefore requires further substantiation.\n\nThe age of the uppermost Charnian unit, the Brand Group, is also in doubt. Clast lithologies show that the middle part of this group contains detritus of granophyric diorite apparently eroded from the South Charnwood Diorites (McIlroy et al., 1998), suggesting a major unconformity postdating the last phase of intrusion. Furthermore, in the lower Brand Group, the Hanging Rocks Formation (exposed just south of this district, see Worssam and Old, 1988) is the first Charnian unit to contain rounded volcanic pebbles and is thus probably unconformable on the Maplewell Group. Added to this are the findings of Bland (1994) that the Swithland Formation, upper Brand Group, contains trace fossils of Teichichnus which are thought to indicate an age no older than the Lower Cambrian (Bland and Goldring, 1995).\n\nThe Precambrian volcanic rocks proved in the Orton and Glinton boreholes, to the south-east of Charnwood Forest, have yielded U-Pb isotope ages of 616 ± 6 Ma and 612 ± 21 Ma respectively (Noble et al., 1993). These rocks are not the precise chemical equivalents of those in Charnwood Forest, however, and their relevance to the age of Charnian volcanicity is therefore questionable.\n\nBlackbrook Group\n\nThis unit corresponds to the ‘Blackbrook Series’ of Watts (1947) and was given its present name by Moseley and Ford (1985). It occurs within the central part of the Charnian anticline (Figure 3), its component formations disposed in annular outcrops reflecting the south-east plunge of the fold. The base of the group is not seen; its top is defined by the incoming of volcanic breccias comprising the Benscliffe Breccia Member of the overlying Maplewell Group. The group has an aggregate thickness of at least 1800 m. It was divided into two formations by Moseley and Ford (1985); (Table 2), to which a third and basal unit - the Morley Lane Volcanic Formation - was added by Carney (1994). The Blackbrook Group commences in massive andesitic volcanic rocks (Morley Lane Formation) passing up to grey, turbidite-facies volcaniclastic mudstones, siltstones and sandstones of the Ives Head Formation. The succeeding Blackbrook Reservoir Formation is similarly of turbidite facies, consisting of grey-green, thickly bedded and multiply graded volcaniclastic strata. A single bedding plane in the Ives Head Formation contains fossils which, although of problematic affinity, were nevertheless placed within the Ediacaran faunal assemblage by Boynton and Ford (1995, 1996).\n\nThe three formations of the Blackbrook Group together constitute an upwards-fining sequence. In the basal Morley Lane Volcanic Formation, the possible occurrence of lava flows is indicative of an initial, proximal-to-centre volcanic environment. Subsequently as water depths increased, instability in the now largely quiescent or more distal volcanic source areas contributed the sand-rich turbidite sequence of the Ives Head Formation, possibly accompanied by more proximal-facies epiclastic or pyroclastic debris flows (graded volcaniclastic sandstones and breccias). This trend culminated in the largely epiclastic Blackbrook Reservoir Formation which is dominated by medial to distal turbidites representing episodic sedimentary influxes into the basin.\n\nMorley Lane Volcanic Formation\n\nThis unit, named by Carney (1994), represents the stratigraphically lowest Charnian subdivision. It does not crop out, and has been proved only in the BGS Morley Quarry No.1 Borehole (Pharaoh and Evans, 1987), between 541 and 835.54 m (terminal depth). It consists mainly of dark greenish grey to black flow-banded porphyritic dacite, up to 90 m thick, interpreted as lava flows. There are subordinate intercalated fine-grained tuff beds.\n\nIves Head Formation (IvH)\n\nThis unit is about 800 m thick and occupies an elongate outcrop in the core of the main Charnian anticline. The type section designated by Moseley and Ford (1985) is on Ives Head [SK 477 170] and the exposures at Morley Quarry [SK 4765 1785] are considered to be an important reference section (Figure 4)a & b. In Morley Quarry, the sequence consists mainly of pale grey or greenish grey, parallel bedded to laminated volcaniclastic mudstones and siltstones. These commonly grade downwards into thicker and more massive beds of coarse to very coarse-grained crystal and lithic-rich volcaniclastic sandstone (saV). These coarser beds show diffuse parallel stratification in their upper parts, but lower down they are commonly massive, consisting of coarse-grained volcaniclastic sandstone and, near the base, matrix-supported breccia (brV) with both volcanic and sedimentary clasts (Carney, 2000a). Sedimentary features are well displayed at Ives Head summit [SK 4769 1704]; they include repetitive normal grading, load structures and wavy to contorted bedding and laminae (Carney, 1994). A volcaniclastic breccia at Short Cliff [SK 4852 1719] is about 60 m thick; it encloses fragments of dacitic volcanic rock which, in thin section (E67478), show groundmass textures ranging from aphanitic to spherulitic and shardic (y-shapes). At Ives Head summit (Plate 1) a prominent bedding plane contains impressions of problematic, ?medusoid Ediacaran fossils of the genus Ivesheadia, Shepshedia and Blackbrookia (Boynton and Ford, 1995, 1996). The Ives Head Formation is capped by the South Quarry Breccia Member (SQBr), about 30 m thick. In its type section at One Barrow Plantation [SK 4639 1714] it contains folded siltstone rafts, up to 1.5 m long, in a pale grey, coarse-grained, poorly sorted crystal-lithic matrix. The beds below consist of about 4 m of medium to coarse-grained volcaniclastic sandstone which grades down into laminated siltstones and mudstones.\n\nBlackbrook Reservoir Formation (Blk)\n\nThis formation was named by Moseley and Ford (1985), who designated the type section as the intermittent exposures around the northern end of the Blackbrook Reservoir and in Blackbrook Quarry [SK 4563 1797]. It is approximately 550 m thick, but uncertainties over this estimate are due to possible tectonic omission or repetition of strata in the north-east of the outcrop. Greenish grey, volcaniclastic mudstones, siltstones and sandstones of turbidite facies dominate the formation.\n\nAt Blackbrook Quarry the sequence consists of pale grey to greenish grey, finely laminated volcaniclastic mudstone and siltstone, with intercalated beds of fine grained sandstone. Laminae are commonly expressed on a scale of one millimetre or less, and are grouped in sets between 5 and 30 mm thick. Some of the thicker beds show normal grading, and in places the laminae are gently flexured. Above the contact with the South Quarry Breccia, the basal beds consist of laminated to massive volcaniclastic siltstone and sandstone in beds 0.2 to 0.4 m thick.\n\nIn Longcliffe and Newhurst quarries (Carney, 1994, figs. 4, 5), the formation is composed of a distinctive series of beds which are typically up to 2 m thick; they have sharply defined, planar boundaries which constitute good structural markers (Plate 17). Individual beds were deposited from multiple sedimentary events, each bed consisting of between 10 and 20 sets composed of parallel laminated, massive, or normally graded volcaniclastic mudstone and siltstone (Figure 4)c & d. More rarely, volcaniclastic sandstone (saV) forms amalgamated, massive to normally graded beds, in sequences up to 4.5 m thick; individual sandstone beds commonly grade downwards into massive matrix-supported breccia (brV), and at Newhurst Quarry such breccias are characterised by a high proportion of intraformational sedimentary clasts. Other sedimentary features common to the formation include load structures and convoluted or rafted bedding; synsedimentary brecciation is exposed at Ingleberry Rock [SK 4896 1733].\n\nKey localities:\n\nIves Head Formation: Morley Quarry [SK 4765 1785]; Ives Head summit [SK 4769 1704]; South Quarry [SK 4641 1701].\n\nSouth Quarry Breccia: One Barrow Plantation [SK 4639 1714].\n\nBlackbrook Reservoir Formation: Blackbrook Quarry (type section) [SK 4563 1797]; Newhurst Quarry [SK 4898 1786]; Longcliffe Quarry [SK 4916 1693].\n\nMaplewell Group\n\nThis group is estimated to be just over 2000 m thick, and crops out around the flanks of the main Charnian anticline. It shows lateral variations in lithology, as indicated by the Generalised Vertical Section of the 1:50 000 Series Sheet 141 Loughborough, and is here divided into two main parts, each of which contains various members, as shown in (Table 2). An eastern outcrop consists mainly of the Beacon Hill Formation, and is dominated by fine to medium-grained volcaniclastic rocks and re-worked tuffs with a locally significant pyroclastic component. A north-western outcrop consists of the Charnwood Lodge Volcanic Formation, which is composed largely of very coarse-grained to block-rich pyroclastic lithologies that were deposited nearer to the Charnian volcanic centres (Carney, 2000b). Correlation between these two sequences is aided by the mapping of a significant marker bed, the Benscliffe Breccia Member, which occurs at the base of the Maplewell Group and can be traced continuously around the nose of the main Charnian anticline to the south of this district. The Bradgate Formation represents the youngest Maplewell Group component; it is common to both eastern and western outcrops, though is generally coarser grained and more massive in the west.\n\nIn the eastern outcrop, the Benscliffe Breccia Member overlies the Blackbrook Reservoir Formation and underlies the Beacon Tuff Member. Both are well-bedded and laminated, turbiditic volcaniclastic sequences deposited subaqueously, suggesting that the Benscliffe Breccia represents the deposits of a subaqueous pyroclastic flow. It thickens north-westwards, where traced around the main Charnian anticline into the Charnwood Lodge Volcanic Formation (see below), suggesting it represents the initial episode of explosive volcanism from centres situated in that region. Further pyroclastic flows formed the dacitic lithic-crystal tuffs within the Beacon Tuff Member and capping this, the Sandhills Lodge Member may represent the deposits of a subaqueous volcaniclastic debris flow, triggered either by tectonism or a pyroclastic eruption, and involving the mobilisation of partially lithified sediments or pyroclastic deposits. A prolonged period of distal turbidite sedimentation followed, depositing the Buck Hills Member. It was accompanied by pyroclastic fall-out from distant volcanic centres that formed vitric tuff layers or laminae. The Outwoods Breccia Member represents a renewed episode of coarse sediment influx. Its content of sediment clasts suggests it was generated by slope instability and involved the mass mobilisation of a partially lithified sedimentary pile that may have formed a turbidite apron that accumulated marginally with respect to the active volcanic centre(s).\n\nIn the western part of the Maplewell Group the overall lithology of the Charnwood Lodge Volcanic Formation indicates deposition in a proximal situation with respect to active Charnian volcanic centres. Its close spatial association with the Whitwick Volcanic Complex, which possibly represents a magmatic feeder zone, further suggests this. Important petrographical and geochemical parallels can also be drawn between components of the Whitwick Volcanic Complex and Charnwood Lodge Formation. The stratified component (undivided beds) of the Charnwood Lodge Formation is interpreted as volcaniclastic accumulations which formed a debris flow apron around andesitic to dacitic volcanic centres. Some of these beds, however, could also be the deposits of long run-out pyroclastic/epiclastic debris flows originating on the flanks of more distant centres. The Swannymote Breccia shows evidence for subaqueous deposition and mixing with an unconsolidated sedimentary substrate. Clasts in that lithology and in the Cademan Breccia Member can be directly matched with massive lithologies in the Whitwick Volcanic Complex. Therefore, these breccia members probably represent the deposits of pyroclastic block flows originating from the disintegration of the volcanic domes or viscous flows represented by the Grimley Andesite or Sharpley Dacite of the Whitwick Volcanic Complex. The great thickness of the Cademan Volcanic Breccia, and its localised development, suggest that it was supplied by multiple debris flows which formed accumulations ponded within valleys, tectonic depressions or a caldera (Carney, 2000b).\n\nThe Bradgate Formation represents a change to more distal accumulations of predominantly ash-grade crystal, lithic and vitric pyroclastic material, modified by turbidity current processes. In the north-western outcrop, the presence of very coarse-grained volcaniclastic sandstones and breccias, some with vitric shards, suggests that volcaniclastic sediment gravity flows continued to be generated near to the Whitwick volcanic centre(s).\n\nBeacon Hill Formation\n\nThis formation was formally named and subdivided by Moseley and Ford (1985), who designated various type sections in the Beacon Hill and Bradgate Park areas, south of this district. Their scheme is followed here, with some modifications indicated in (Table 2). The formation has a wide outcrop in the eastern part of the Maplewell Group, and is estimated to be about 1800 m thick. The lowest unit is the Benscliffe Breccia Member (Ben) 20 to 100 m thick. This is a volcanic breccia with poorly defined, subrounded pink to grey clasts, ranging from pea-size up to lapilli 40 mm across, enclosed in a greenish grey, medium to coarse-grained crystal-rich matrix. The clasts are predominantly of andesitic to dacitic composition (57 to 69% SiO2; unpublished BGS analyses); in thin section (E67728) they show both flow-banded and spherulitic textures. It should be noted that the Benscliffe Breccia is a widely developed unit which can be traced around the Charnian anticline and into the western outcrop, where it forms the base of, and possibly merges into, the Charnwood Lodge Volcanic Formation (see below).\n\nThe overlying Beacon Tuff Member (BcT) is about 875 m thick. It consists of hard (‘flinty’), blue-grey, parallel-laminated and graded tuffaceous mudstones and siltstones. The deposits of a pyroclastic event more significant than that which produced the Benscliffe Breccia are represented by outcrops of massive dacitic lithic-crystal tuff (ZD), estimated to be 180 m thick, within the bedded sequence near Nanpantan Hall, e.g. [SK 5031 1638]. The matrix of this tuff is crammed with lapilli-size andesitic and dacitic clasts, some with relict fluidal and spherulitic textures.\n\nAt the top of the formation are predominantly volcaniclastic units commencing with the Sandhills Lodge Member (ShL), exposed south of Home Farm [SK 5037 1617]. It consists of about 20 m of pale grey, massive, coarse grained, crystal-rich volcaniclastic sandstone with folded fine-grained sedimentary rafts. In thin section (E67502) vitric (y-shaped) shards are found both in the matrix and in lapilli of dacitic tuff. The overlying Buck Hills Member (BHM) is a fining-upwards sequence, consisting of alternations between blue-grey, parallel-laminated, graded volcaniclastic mudstones, siltstones and sandstones. Beds of massive to graded sandstone (saV) are common near the base, and from these beds a thin section (E67725) shows vitric tuff laminae packed with y-shaped glass shards. The succeeding Outwoods Breccia Member (OtB) comprises about 120 m of grey, medium to coarse-grained, massive to parallel-stratified volcaniclastic sandstone in beds 0.5 to 3 m thick, alternating with breccia. The latter beds are up to 7 m thick in the Out Woods; their matrix is coarse grained, crystal rich and lithic rich, with granule to small pebble size clasts of spherulitic dacite and welded tuff (E67681). Angular blocks and larger rafts of volcaniclastic mudstone and siltstone constitute the larger fragments, which characterise the breccia beds. Their outlines reveal that they have been affected by plastic deformation; processes involving brecciation, soft-sediment folding and stretching of pre-existing bedding are all suggested by the various clast shapes (Moseley and Ford, 1989).\n\nBradgate Formation (BT)\n\nThe Bradgate Formation is the youngest unit of definite Precambrian age in the Charnian sequence. It was formally named by Moseley and Ford (1985) and given a type section in the Bradgate Park–Warren Hill–Hallgate Hill area, south of the district. The formation is probably not much more than 180 m thick in this district.\n\nIn the eastern part of the Out Woods [SK 5149 1656] it comprises alternations between pale and dark grey parallel-laminated vitric tuff, tuffaceous siltstone and massive to parallel-bedded sandstone. In thin section (E67756) the tuffs show silty layers containing subhedral to angular plagioclase crystals interspersed with sliver shaped shards of recrystallized glass. In the north-west of the Charnian outcrop, beds tentatively correlated with the formation were exposed in a sewer outfall excavation in Thringstone [SK 4335 1659]; they consist of grey, coarse grained, crystal-rich volcaniclastic sandstone with granule to small-pebble size clasts of volcanic rock and maroon siltstone.\n\nKey localities:\n\nBenscliffe Breccia: Roe’s Plantation [SK 4968 1635]. Beacon Tuff Member: Nanpantan Hill [SK 5003 1690]; south of Nanpantan Hall (dacitic tuffs) [SK 5004 1631]. Sandhills Lodge Member: south of The Home Farm [SK 5037 1617]. Buck Hills Member: Buck Hill [SK 5071 1676]; Nanpantan Lodge [SK 5098 1683]. Outwoods Breccia Member: Out Woods [SK 5138 1666]. Bradgate Formation: Out Woods [SK 5149 1656].\n\nCharnwood Lodge Volcanic Formation (CLV)\n\nThis unit is equivalent to the ‘Charnwood Lodge Member’, which Moseley and Ford (1985) included within the Beacon Hill Formation. The same rocks were called ‘Charnwood Lodge Agglomerate’ by Worssam and Old (1988). Formational status is preferable for this unit because it is capable of further subdivision into the members shown in (Table 2). The lowest division, the Kite Hill Tuff Member of Carney (1994), is not shown on Sheet 141 Loughborough, but is included within the undivided beds of the formation. The Charnwood Lodge Volcanic Formation is re-defined as the succession of massive to thickly stratified coarse-grained tuffs, lapilli tuffs and volcanic breccias, between 950 and 1280 m thick, which lies between the Blackbrook Reservoir and Bradgate Formations. In accordance with the scheme of Moseley and Ford (1985), the formation is considered to be contemporary with, and therefore laterally equivalent to, the Beacon Tuff Member, which comprises the lower part of the Beacon Hill Formation on the north-eastern side of the Charnian anticline.\n\nMoseley and Ford (1985) designated the type section for this unit as the area in the Charnwood Lodge Nature Reserve between Flat Hill [SK 4650 1606] and Warren Hills [SK 4605 1481], on the southern margin of the Loughborough district. Here, however, exposures are too sporadic to be considered representative of the unit as a whole, and it may therefore be preferable to regard this as a type area.\n\nUndivided beds of the formation comprise massive to thickly bedded andesitic volcanic breccia (comparable with the ‘bomb rocks’ of Watts, 1947) intercalated with parallel-bedded lithic-lapilli or lithic-crystal tuff, as seen at Gunhill Rough and at Strawberry Hill Plantation [SK 4558 1710]. These lowermost beds of the formation are lateral equivalents of the Benscliffe Breccia Member. That unit was mapped at the base of the Charnwood Lodge Formation farther south and east (Worssam and Old, 1988), but it is not differentiated here since it is considered to have merged with the main coarse-grained component of the Charnwood Lodge Formation. The St. Bernard Tuff Member (SBT), about 100 m thick, occupies a synclinal structure, but its true stratigraphical position is not known; it may pass south-eastwards into the unexposed lower lying ground of the Charnwood Lodge Nature Reserve, south of Collier Hill (Figure 3). In the Mount St. Bernard type area [SK 3575 1626] (Carney, 1994), the member consists of a lower unit, about 60 m thick, of massive lithic-crystal tuff, with abundant andesitic lapilli, passing up to volcanic breccia, and overlain by a 2.7 m-thick lapilli tuff bed. The last unit shows in thin section (E675170) common y-shaped glass shards in the matrix. The uppermost beds, immediately west of the Abbey building, are probably less than a metre thick and consist of repetitively graded, medium to fine-grained crystal tuffs.\n\nThere are two further members showing close spatial and compositional affinities with rocks of the Whitwick Volcanic Complex. The Swannymote Breccia Member (SB), some 120 m thick, forms isolated outcrops in close association with Sharpley Porphyritic Dacite of the Whitwick Volcanic Complex. At Swannymote Rock, it comprises pale grey, coarse-grained dacitic tuff grading to monomictic volcanic breccias. The latter’s clasts are most commonly represented by subangular to rounded blocks of porphyritic (plagioclase and green quartz) dacite identical to the Sharpley Porphyritic Dacite (see below). Close by to the west, irregular-shaped masses of grey volcaniclastic siltstone are intermixed with the breccia matrix, the latter containing clasts with spherulitic textures seen in thin section (E67527). At Ratchet Hill there is a sharp contact between Sharpley Dacite and Swannymote Breccia [SK 4474 1634]. Nearby, the breccia contains rafts of grey siltstone with internal laminae sharply truncated by the host breccia. The Cademan Volcanic Breccia (CVB), up to about 450 m thick, is most typically developed around Calvary Rock. It has a coarse-grained, green-grey crystal-lithic matrix, which encloses abundant lapilli and angular to subangular blocks of a uniform, fine-grained, high-silica andesite lithology that is identical both chemically and petrographically to massive rocks of the Grimley Andesite (see below). The blocks average about 0.3 m across with some ‘outsize’ blocks in excess of 2 m; in places they are closely packed (Plate 2), suggestive of a ‘jig-saw’ type of breccia, as at Grace Dieu Wood [SK 4353 1746].\n\nKey localities:\n\nCharnwood Lodge Formation (undivided): Gunhill Rough [SK 4540 1675]. Kite Hill Member: Charnwood Towers [SK 4628 1624]. St Bernard Member: gardens of Mount St Bernard Abbey [SK 3575 1626]. Swannymote Member: Swannymote Rock [SK 4449 1725]. Cademan Member: Calvary Rock [SK 4338 1717].\n\nWhitwick Volcanic Complex\n\nThis is an assemblage of lithologies named by Moseley and Ford (1985) and re-defined by Carney (2000b) to include only those massive to autobrecciated components which occupy no particular stratigraphical position and may be bounded either by intrusive or faulted contacts. Unfortunately, exposures of contacts are exceedingly rare; those in Whitwick Quarry are invariably faulted, and are the site of ductile shear zones (Carney, 1994, fig. 10). The three components of the Whitwick Complex are all named after the varieties of ‘porphyroid’ described by previous workers (for example, Watts, 1947), and are: Peldar Dacite Breccia, Sharpley Porphyritic Dacite and Grimley Andesite.\n\nThese three units are interpreted to be either subvolcanic intrusions or subvolcanic to extrusive domes emplaced into the Charnian volcanic centres. Disintegration of these domes would have caused pyroclastic flows and lahars characterised by the incorporation of ‘Grimley’ type blocks in Cademan Breccia and ‘Sharpley’ blocks in Swannymote Breccia (Carney, 2000b). Intense but localised autobrecciation seen in the Grimley Andesite may be attributed to an early stage of the disintegration process, but the Sharpley Dacite is not brecciated, and may be interpreted as a relatively late-stage subvolcanic intrusion that rose into a previously brecciated carapace. The Peldar Dacite Breccia, with no obvious representatives in the Charnwood Lodge Formation, may represent a subvolcanic dome (cryptodome) that failed to reach the surface. Its spherulitic textures, denoting chilling of the magma to a glass or near-glass, the extreme granulation of its matrix, and complex mixing of the latter with unconsolidated sediment are features suggesting interaction between dacitic magma and wet sediments. Quench-brecciation of the dacite resulted from this process, producing a type of hyaloclastite lithology (Carney, 2000b).\n\nPeldar Dacite Breccia (PDB)\n\nThis unit, estimated to be about 520 m thick, has its type section in Whitwick Quarry (Carney, 1994; fig. 10) which lies mainly in the Coalville district to the south (Sheet 155). It is a heterogeneous lithology (Plate 3) with three principal components:\n\nnumerous rounded to elliptical or cuspate enclaves, from millimetre to decimetre-size, of black, fine-grained, porphyritic (plagioclase and green quartz) dacite\n\nsmall (10 to 500 mm) rounded inclusions of pale green medium-grained quartz microdiorite\n\na grey, medium-grained crystal-rich matrix which encloses abundant slivers of dark grey dacite (Plate 3). In thin section (E67547C), the dacite slivers have a pervasive, globulose texture caused by abundant quartzofeldspathic micro-spheruliths\n\nIn the central part of the quarry, a 150 m-long raft of maroon volcaniclastic siltstone and mudstone is enclosed within the breccia; at its margins coarse-grained lenticles of breccia matrix are admixed with the siltstone, and wisps of maroon siltstone occur within the adjacent breccia matrix.\n\nSharpley Porphyritic Dacite (SyP)\n\nThe Sharpley Porphyritic Dacite was named by Carney (1994) and equates to the ‘Sharpley-type’ porphyroid of Watts (1947). It is a massive, texturally homogeneous rock with a dacitic composition confirmed by chemical analyses indicating between 70% and 72% SiO2 (unpublished BGS data). The unit, which is restricted to the Whitwick Complex, forms numerous scattered outcrops and cannot be traced with much confidence beneath the younger cover. In (Figure 3) it is interpreted as a bifurcating, sheet like body, in part fault-controlled. The dacite is up to 600 m thick in places and its type locality is on High Sharpley [SK 4485 1707].\n\nSharpley Dacite has a similar phenocryst suite to the Peldar Dacite Breccia (i.e. large white plagioclase and green quartz), but these occur within a medium to pale grey or lavender matrix. It is identical in lithology, petrography and geochemistry to the blocks in the Swannymote Breccia Member. Although it is commonly massive, on High Sharpley [SK 4485 1707] it exhibits prominent planar surfaces whose dip, towards the south-west, is apparently parallel to the regional Charnian dip. On these surfaces there is developed a system of rectangular to polygonal shaped joints, spaced at between 0.5 and 1 m, which in sections perpendicular to the ‘dip’ divide the rock into attenuated lozenges. This structure is not produced by the Charnian cleavage, which here trends west-north-west, and is instead reminiscent of a relict columnar-jointing system. A ‘pseudo-brecciate’ structure, produced by systems of curved joints, is visible at a further exposure to the south of High Sharpley [SK 4474 1682].\n\nGrimley Andesite (GyA)\n\nThis name of this unit (Carney, 1994) is derived from the ‘Grimley-type’ porphyroid mentioned by Watts (1947). Farther south apparent equivalents have been called the ‘Bardon Good Rock’ and ‘Bardon Breccia’ (Jones, 1926). Its main outcrop extends (Figure 3) from the railway cutting west of Grace Dieu Wood [SK 4313 1753] south-eastwards to the exposure near High Tor Farm [SK 4594 1542], just outside the southern margin of the district. The type area is designated as the ground between Whitwick Quarry [SK 4468 1619] and the crags around Cademan Street in Whitwick [SK 4370 1637]. A thickness of 940 m hereabouts must remain a rough estimate due to the paucity of exposures.\n\nGrimley Andesite forms extensive masses but has also been found as more restricted occurrences, for example within the Cademan Volcanic Breccia outcrop at High Cademan [SK 4424 1689]. It is mostly a green to greyish green, moderately plagioclase-phyric high-silica andesite or dacite, with silica contents between 57 and 63% (unpublished BGS analyses). Locally it shows intense autobrecciation, as in the outcrops at Cademan Street, Whitwick, and at Hob’s Hole [SK 4360 1740]. In Whitwick Quarry [SK 4468 1619] fresh faces show incipient breccia development in the form of anastomosing stringers of dark grey medium-grained andesite which divide the lithology into metres-scale diamondshaped slivers. In the last location, a small intrusion of Grimley Andesite shows a chilled margin against Peldar Dacite Breccia, this being the only evidence for relative age of emplacement within the Whitwick Complex.\n\nKey localities\n\nPeldar Dacite: Railway cutting in Whitwick [SK 4340 1640]. Sharpley Dacite: High Sharpley [SK 4485 1707]. Grimley Andesite: Cademan Street, Whitwick [SK 4370 1637].\n\nBrand Group\n\nThe Brand Group was formerly thought to be entirely of Precambrian age, but recent work has shown that this is probably only true for its lower part (the Hanging Rocks Conglomerate); (Figure 3), which does not crop out in this district. To the south, beds of the overlying Swithland Formation contain the trace fossil Teichichnus which is considered to be no older than Lower Cambrian (Bland and Goldring, 1995; McIlroy et al., 1998). Within the Brand Group, therefore, a major unconformity must occur in strata below the Swithland Formation. The latter unit has a small outcrop in this district and is described below (see Chapter 3).\n\nPrecambrian intrusions\n\nIn this district there are two types of Precambrian intrusions: the North Charnwood Diorites and the Lubcloud Microgranite (although it is also possible that the latter may be from a separate, Ordovician phase of intrusion). The South Charnwood Diorites include the occurrences of granophyric diorite (markfieldite); they crop out in the Coalville district, farther south, and are described by Worssam and Old (1988).\n\nThe North Charnwood Diorites (HD) suite (Worssam and Old, 1988) is represented by near-vertical to inclined diorite sheets, up to 60 m wide. They show north-westerly and easterly orientations (Figure 3), and in the Longcliffe and Newhurst quarries [SK 492 170]; [SK 484 179] they intersect Charnian bedding at a high angle (Carney, 1994, figs. 4, 5). Typical lithologies are grey with a coarsely mottled texture. In thin section (E67485) this mottling consists of white, subhedral plagioclase crystals, 2 to 5 mm across, enclosed within a grey, granular quartzo-feldspathic mesostasis containing several percent of granophyric intergrowths. The intrusive contacts show chilling to a fine-grained diorite. Adjacent to such contacts, the Charnian country rocks become pale grey and develop green-grey thermal spots. The ellipsoidal shapes of these spots, as seen at the southern end of Longcliffe Quarry [SK 4940 1678], is due to the penetrative cleavage deformation that postdated diorite emplacement (Boulter and Yates, 1987 see also, Chapter 9).\n\nA second intrusive type, the Lubcloud Microgranite (FG), is exposed south of Ives Head summit where it occurs as a 9 m-wide north-west-trending dyke. It consists of common white plagioclase phenocrysts set in a red, saccharoidal quartzo-feldspathic matrix.\n\nKey localities\n\nNorth Charnwood Diorites: Five Tree Plantation [SK 4955 1650]; quarries near Buck Hill [SK 5064 1649]; [SK 5093 1642]. Lubcloud Microgranite: Ives Head [SK 4740 1712].\n\nChapter 3 Cambrian\n\nCambrian strata represent the deposits of a widespread marine transgression across the eroded Precambrian landmass (Taylor and Rushton, 1971). This chapter includes the Swithland Formation, traditionally regarded as part of the Charnian Supergroup but now believed to be Lower Cambrian in age (see Brand Group in Chapter 2).\n\nSwithland Formation (SG)\n\nThe Swithland Formation was named by Moseley and Ford (1985), who designated the type section on ‘The Brand’ estate and in Swithland Wood, Sheet 155 Coalville. It is largely unexposed in the Loughborough district, but is probably at least 200 m thick. The Swithland Formation is still referred to the upper part of the Brand Group, although this may be revised in view of the Early Cambrian age established by the discovery of the trace fossil Teichichnus south of the district (Bland and Goldring, 1995; McIlroy et al., 1998). Farther south in the Coalville district the formation consists largely of slaty mudrocks (Worssam and Old, 1988). In the Loughborough district, the formation is exposed only in a small quarry east of Nanpantan [SK 5103 1739], where it consists of purple or maroon siltstones and poorly sorted coarse-grained, lithic-rich and crystal-rich sandstones. These beds probably occupy a stratigraphical position near the base of the formation. They contain detritus from the underlying Charnian Supergroup that was eroded and deposited rapidly, probably from sediment-gravity flows.\n\nStockingford Shale Group (SSh)\n\nThe Stockingford Shale Group was named by Taylor and Rushton (1971) and has its type area between Mancetter and Nuneaton in Warwickshire (Bridge et al., 1998; Worssam and Old, 1988). The unit does not crop out in this district, but was proved over 39 m at the base of the Ticknall Borehole (Figure 7). The principal lithologies are black, dark grey and pale grey, pyritous, laminated mudstones and silty mudstones. Green and red colours prevail for 11 m below the unconformity with the Calke Abbey Sandstone Formation; this is attributed to pre-Dinantian weathering of the Stockingford Group. The beds dip steeply, about 50 to 70°, giving a true thickness of about 25 m, and the sequence displays a pervasive, near vertical, penetrative cleavage attributed to Acadian (Silurian-Devonian) compression (see Chapter 9).\n\nThe Middle or early Late Cambrian age of these beds is based on a fragmentary fauna which includes the trilobite Agnostus pisiformis (Rushton, 1995) and sparse acritarchs (Molyneux, 1995). Together with obvious lithological similarities, this age proves the unit’s correlation with the Stockingford Shale Group whose type area occurs around Nuneaton (Taylor and Rushton, 1971; Bridge et al., 1998). A further proving of the Stockingford Shale Group, beneath Dinantian strata, was made in the BGS Rotherwood Borehole [SK 3458 1559], located 8 km south-south-west of the Ticknall Borehole (Worssam and Old, 1988).\n\nChapter 4 Carboniferous\n\nAfter the Acadian deformation and uplift, no geological record of the next 60 million years has survived in the stratigraphy of the district. It is likely that this was a period of erosion, moulding a landscape that was flooded by a marine transgression in latest Devonian or early Carboniferous (Tournaisian) times (about 355 Ma). The initial deposits of this transgression probably accumulated in restricted basins which had subsided differentially (syn-rift) as a result of faulting and flexuring. By Westphalian times regional-scale subsidence due to post-rift thermal sag allowed large areas of the Midlands to be submerged and covered by sediments. The early Carboniferous topography was probably developed mainly upon Cambrian and Ordovician rocks, and in the south the basement rocks of the Charnwood Massif formed a ‘palaeo-high’, part of the northern margin of the Wales–London–Brabant Massif (Corfield et al., 1996).\n\nDinantian (‘Carboniferous limestone’)\n\nDinantian strata were deposited within a tilted block and graben topography formed at a time of widespread crustal extension across the English Midlands (e.g. Miller and Grayson, 1982), and are considered to form part of a ‘synrift megasequence’ (Fraser and Gawthorpe, 1990). In this district, many of the lithological and thickness variations within the Dinantian succession can be related to particular structural domains. These comprise (Figure 6).\" data-name=\"images/P946471.jpg\">(Figure 5a) the Widmerpool Half-graben, the Hathern Shelf (Ebdon et al., 1990), on the south-western (footwall) side of the Normanton Hills Fault, and the Platform (incorporating the Charnwood Massif), consisting of an uplifted and relatively un-faulted region to the south and west of the faults bounding the Hathern Shelf. The lateral relationships between the various Dinantian formations traced across these structural domains are summarised in (Figure 5b). Correlations of strata between the limited number of available boreholes are shown in (Figure 6). The nomenclature of the exposed strata in the Breedon–Ticknall area is summarised in (Table 3).\n\nThese strata were traditionally included within the ‘Carboniferous Limestone’, which may be considered to be an informal lithostratigraphical unit of supergroup ranking representing strata deposited through the Dinantian period. However, Carboniferous Limestone is not a formal unit, and this terminology is not recommended for current use (Aitkenhead and Chisholm, 1982).\n\nHathern Shelf Sequences\n\nThe only outcrops of Dinantian strata in the district belong to the Hathern Shelf structural province, and are confined to a narrow zone, extending between Ticknall and Grace Dieu. These strata were uplifted and locally steeply tilted by the combined movements on the Breedon and Thringstone faults (Figure 1). Elsewhere their sub-Triassic distribution is inferred from seismic interpretation, constrained by several deep boreholes. Parsons (1918), Mitchell and Stubblefield (1941) and Monteleone (1973) described the outcropping sequences. As a result of this resurvey the nomenclature, age and correlation of the units has been further refined (Ambrose and Carney, 1997 a, b), (Table 3), and has been extended to the concealed parts of the shelf sequence. A significant finding of this resurvey is that the entire Early Chadian carbonate sequence exposed around Breedon is absent from the Ticknall Borehole, indicating either that it has thinned out westwards, or was removed by uplift and erosion prior to deposition of the Holkerian to Brigantian strata (Figure 5b).\n\nHathern Anhydrite Formation (HaA)\n\nThis is the oldest recorded Dinantian unit in the district and has been proved only in the Hathern No.1 Hydrocarbon Borehole (Figure 6) where 97 m were recorded above terminal depth. The overlying limestones are of early Chadian age (George et al., 1976). The anhydrite is interpreted as a basal facies, at least locally, on the Hathern Shelf and was equated by Ebdon et al. (1990) with their EC1 tectono-stratigraphical sequence. Palynological evidence (Llewellyn et al., 1969) indicates that the Hathern Anhydrite is of Courceyan age, equivalent to the CM Zone of Clayton et al. (1977). The unit comprises bedded to nodular anhydrite alternating with limestone, dolostone and mudstone. This association is interpreted as cyclically layered sabkha deposits by Llewellyn and Stabbins (1970). It probably indicates a restricted marine influence as parts of the region began to subside (Ebdon et al., 1990).\n\nMilldale Limestone Formation (Mi)\n\nThis unit is correlated with strata exposed in north Derbyshire and named by Parkinson (1949). In this district it is exposed in Breedon Hill and Cloud Hill quarries (Ambrose and Carney, 1997b, figs. 2, 3), where the minimum thicknesses are estimated to be 380 m and 130 m respectively. A single subdivison, the Holly Bush Member named by Ambrose and Carney (1997b), is recognised only at Cloud Hill Quarry. The Milldale Limestone comprises grey to buff, thin to thickly bedded, fine to coarse-crystalline dolostones, with pebbles and sand grains common in the Holly Bush Member.\n\nSecondary dolomitisation has obscured many of the original sedimentary structures, and hence the origin of the Milldale Limestone Formation. At Cloud Hill Quarry, however, the overall character of the succession suggests deposition on a carbonate shelf, largely in high-energy, storm dominated environments which are suggested by brachiopod coquinas and the possible presence of hummocky cross-stratification. A proximal shallow water shelf setting is further indicated by the clastic component (Holly Bush Member), and the commonly high bioclastic content of these beds. By contrast, Milldale Limestone at Breedon Hill Quarry contains a mud-mound (Waulsortian) reef and thus represents a more distal, carbonate ramp setting, with water depths of 220 to 280 m suggested for the comparable mud-mound reefs of north Derbyshire (Bridges and Chapman, 1988).\n\nAt Cloud Hill Quarry, the bedded part of the Milldale Limestone shows undulating bounding surfaces throughout (Plate 20). Thinly bedded dolostones and red mudstones of the Cloud Wood Member show synsedimentary folding and thrust imbrication, with incorporated slivers of brecciated mud-mound reef facies dolostone (pale yellow, unbedded lensoid masses) (GS 1009).\" data-name=\"images/P946494.jpg\">(Plate 6) (GS 1006).\" data-name=\"images/P946491.jpg\">(Plate 4), with many partings of green and grey, commonly bituminous clay, shaly mudstone and siltstone. In part, this bedding may represent hummocky cross-stratification that was emphasised by non-sutured stylolites developed during dolomitisation. One package of beds which are not dolomitised shows that the formation comprises beds of fine to coarse-grained, bioclastic, locally ooidal, pelloidal grainstone. This facies is similar to that developed within undolomitised Milldale Limestone in its type area of Milldale in Derbyshire. The dolomitised beds contain chert nodules which have yielded foraminifera suitable for dating: the assemblages (Cf4a1 subzone) are indicative of an Early Chadian age (information from N J Riley, 1999). In keeping with this age are coquinas containing the brachiopod Levitusia humerosus, for which Cloud Hill is the type locality. Other fossils include brachiopods, crinoids, gastropods, corals and echinoids.\n\nIn the upper part of the formation in Cloud Hill Quarry, the Holly Bush Member is 61 m thick although it is impersistent, dying out northwards over about 200 m in the quarry. The member is composed of bedded dolostones with a high quartz or lithic sand content, and with sporadic pebbles. One pebble is a tuff which resembles in thin section (E71013) certain of the Charnian Precambrian lithologies; other pebbles are micrites with fenestral structures indicating sources from lithified Dinantian peritidal deposits as well as basement.\n\nIn Breedon Hill Quarry, the Milldale Limestone is represented by similar but less fossiliferous strata, overlain to the west of a major fault by about 100 m of finely crystalline, unbedded, fossiliferous dolostone of mud-mound (Waulsortian) reef facies (mmr). Massive dolostone represents the core of the mound and an overlying bedded sequence, just below the observed top of the formation, probably represents accumulations of debris on the flanks of the mound. Volume changes due to secondary dolomitisation are probably responsible for the abundance of vuggy cavities in these carbonates. Despite this, relict structures such as sheet spars, typical of Waulsortian fabrics, can still be discerned. The Early Chadian reefs of south Derbyshire/north Staffordshire are undolomitised examples of the mound at Breedon Hill. About 90 per cent of their volume is composed of micrite, with the remainder comprising skeletal carbonates containing fenestrate bryzoa, sponge spicules and common crinoids (e.g. Bridges and Chapman, 1988; Bridges et al., 1995). The Breedon Hill mud mound contains a diverse fauna of this type with additionally, nautiloids and ammonoids, including Fascipericyclus fasiculatus, of Early Chadian age.\n\nIn the Hathern Hydrocarbon Well No. 1, 149.6 m of thickly bedded grey, brown and black, fine-grained limestones with thin shaly beds overlie the Hathern Anhydrite. They are probably of Chadian, C1/C2 age (George et al., 1976; Ebdon et al., 1990), and are equated here with a local development of the Milldale Limestone. The overlying 110 m of grey to black, laminated calcareous mudstones are undated (George et al., 1976), but if they are equivalent to the Widmerpool Formation (see below), a substantial unconformity must be present at the top of the Milldale Limestone here (Figure 6).\n\nKey localities\n\nCloud Hill Quarry [SK 413 215]; Breedon Hill Quarry [SK 407 235]\n\nCalke Abbey Sandstone Formation (CAS)\n\nThis formation is a new unit, named by Ambrose and Carney (1997a) and proved only in the Ticknall Borehole where it is 70.6 m thick. Its base, at 171.9 m depth, is a major unconformity with the Cambrian Stockingford Shale Group, and it is overlain abruptly at 101.3 m by pale green, fine-grained sandstones of the Arch Farm Sandstone Formation (Ambrose and Carney, 1997a). The Calke Abbey Sandstone is barren of fossils and its age is consequently unknown.\n\nThe larger part of the formation (Figure 7) consists of medium to thick-bedded, brown to green-grey, medium to coarse-grained pebbly sandstones and conglomerates (Plate 5a); they show parallel stratification or low-angle cross-bedding. Finer-grained components consist of laminated to thinly bedded sequences of green or red mudstones and siltstones which include thin, sharp-based and commonly graded layers of sandstone; the principal sandstone beds are feldspathic and classified as litharenites or sublitharenites (Strong, 1996). There are numerous reddened layers, consisting of poorly sorted, generally structureless, mudstones, siltstones and argillaceous sandstones. They commonly show vermicular red to grey rootlet mottles and also contain rare examples of silt-filled near-vertical fissures (Plate 5b): such lithologies resemble alluvial palaeosols described by Bown and Kraus (1987). In the basal conglomerate that is about 13 m thick, the chemistry of volcanic pebbles (unpublished BGS analyses) indicates a contribution of material from a Charnian-type Precambrian source, which presumably is Charnwood Forest situated 9 km to the south-east. The overlying sandstones nevertheless contain abundant K-feldspars (Strong, 1996), commonly visible as prominent pink grains in hand specimens, which are not typical of the Charnian and indicate an additional contribution from a granitoid basement.\n\nThe main clastic part of the Calke Abbey Sandstone has not yielded any dateable fossil remains, although it must be older than Asbian (NM biozone), which is the age of the base of the Cloud Hill Dolostone proved higher in the Ticknall Borehole. The formation could be a local equivalent of the Caldon Low Conglomerate, of Asbian age, in the Ashbourne district (Chisholm et al., 1988 p. 28). On the other hand, the arenaceous beds are also lithologically similar to the Redhouse Sandstones, of the same district, which are considerably older, being at least Courceyan in age (Chisholm et al., 1988). A further possibility is that the sandstones may be lateral and thus more proximal equivalents of the pebbly beds represented by the Holly Bush Member of the Early Chadian Milldale Limestone (see above) exposed in Cloud Hill Quarry to the south-east. The latter two possibilities suggest that within the Ticknall Borehole, there could be a major unconformity developed on Early Chadian, Courceyan or even late Devonian strata represented by the main part of the Calke Abbey Sandstone sequence.\n\nThe depositional environment of the Calke Abbey Sandstone was probably that of a distal alluvial fan with episodic influxes of gravelly debris flows and sheetflood sands, interspersed with quiescent periods during which the alluvial deposits were pedogenically modified. At times of extended overbank sedimentation, or when bodies of standing water may have existed, the thicker mudstone and siltstone sequences accumulated; the graded sandstone interbeds are interpreted as the subaqueous continuations of sheetfloods. A change to nearshore marine environments is indicated by the incoming of Lingula debris in the overlying Arch Farm Sandstone Formation.\n\nArch Farm Sandstone Formation (ARFS)\n\nAmbrose and Carney (1997a) named this 9 m-thick unit for the strata between 92.3 and 101.3 m depth in the Ticknall Borehole; it has not been seen at outcrop. The formation consists mainly of sandstone, in beds up to 1.7 m thick, which are commonly green to grey, fine to medium-grained and laminated or cross-laminated. They contain pebble-rich lenticles, and shelly lags containing fragments of Lingula. Partings up to several centimetres thick consist of green mudstone and siltstone, some with Lingula, and these lithologies also occur as rip-up clasts in the basal parts of sandstone beds. The upper 4 m of the formation is particularly coarse grained and conglomeratic, containing calcareous sandstones which commonly show significant pedogenic fabrics. For example, in the highest bed, 0.9 m thick, there are abundant anastomosing stringers and veinlets of white calcareous material and the bed is capped by green mudstone with numerous listric surfaces and sporadic small ferruginous concretions.\n\nThe base of the Arch Farm Sandstone is interpreted as a major marine flooding surface, which also corresponds to a prominent indentation on the gamma-ray log (Figure 7). The overlying laminated sandstones containing Lingula were deposited in moderate to high energy, nearshore or shoreface settings. The upper part of the formation contains conglomerates and coarse-grained sandstones and appears devoid of Lingula, perhaps indicative of a return to fluvial conditions. Episodes of emergence and soil formation are indicated here, by pedogenic fabrics developed in strata comprising the upper 2 m of the formation.\n\nCloud Hill Dolostone Formation (CHD)\n\nThe name of this unit (Ambrose and Carney, 1997b) is modified from the ‘Cloud Hill Dolomite’ of Monteleone (1973). The strata rest unconformably on Milldale Limestone at Cloud Hill and Breedon Hill, and are also present in the Barrow Hill inlier. They have been proved above the Arch Farm Sandstone in the Ticknall Borehole, between 55.4 and 92.3 m (Figure 7). Subdivisions of the formation include the Cloud Wood Member, in Cloud Hill Quarry (Ambrose and Carney, 1997b), and the Scot’s Brook Member in the Ticknall Borehole (Ambrose and Carney, 1997a).\n\nThe type section for the formation is at Cloud Hill Quarry [SK 413 215], where a minimum thickness of 125 m is exposed. Here, the base of the Cloud Hill Dolostone rests on Early Chadian strata and is both an angular unconformity and a possible intraformational slide surface, named the Main Breedon Discontinuity (Ambrose and Carney, 1997b, fig. 3). In the north of the quarry, the Cloud Wood Member forms the basal division of the formation; mudstone samples taken from this member just above the basal unconformity have yielded a Late Holkerian to Early Asbian palynological age (Turner, 1996). The basal unconformity therefore represents a substantial time gap; no strata of late Chadian and Arundian age, and possibly none of Holkerian age, are present. The top of the formation, intersected in the Ticknall Borehole, is a karstified surface overlain by strata of the Ticknall Limestone Formation.\n\nThe Cloud Wood Member is about 36 m thick in the north of Cloud Hill Quarry, where it occupies the base of the Cloud Hill Dolostone. It comprises a lower sequence, up to 9 m thick, of mudstones and dolomitic siltstones with thin dolostones. These beds are grey, greenish grey, purplish brown and red-brown in colour, commonly well laminated and locally shell-rich. The upper 20 to 30 m consist of dolostones that are grey to greenish grey and red-stained, thin to thickly bedded, and fine to coarsely crystalline. Red or grey, clay or shaly mudstone/siltstone partings commonly separate these beds.\n\nThe Scot’s Brook Member was named by Ambrose and Carney (1997a) and is the basal unit of the Cloud Hill Dolostone in the Ticknall Borehole, between 88.85 and 92.3 m. This unit consists of carbonate-veined, pedogenically modified argillaceous sandstones intercalated with grey, argillaceous and calcretic palaeosols. Near the base there is a 0.7 m-thick bed of white, micritic limestone containing ostracods; it is capped by green mudstone with rounded, elliptical carbonate nodules. At the top, green calcareous mudstone of the member is succeeded sharply by nodular, micritic limestone of the Cloud Hill Dolostone.\n\nA mud-mound reef facies (mmr) of dolostone lies above the Cloud Wood Member in the north of Cloud Hill Quarry, and is also seen at Barrow Hill. This is a buff to grey, massive, generally finely crystalline, fossiliferous dolostone which contains brachiopods, crinoids, corals, gastropods, nautiloids and ammonoids. Ammonoids include Goniatites, which indicates a Late Asbian to Brigantian age for these beds. Similar Asbian reefs on the northern flanks of the Widmerpool Gulf are composed of microbialite, with sponges, bryzoan and corals as secondary constituents (Mundy, 1994); however, at Cloud Hill coral debris is not commonly preserved. The lower contact of the reef on the Cloud Wood Member is sharp and apparently conformable, whereas southwards it is faulted against undivided beds of Cloud Hill Dolostone (Ambrose and Carney, 1997b, fig. 3). Shear deformation within the mudstones, and locally intense folding and thrust imbrication of the whole of the Cloud Wood Member, become progressively more pronounced northwards in the quarry, culminating in a sequence with tectonically incorporated slivers of mud-mound reef (Plate 20). Thinly bedded dolostones and red mudstones of the Cloud Wood Member show synsedimentary folding and thrust imbrication, with incorporated slivers of brecciated mud-mound reef facies dolostone (pale yellow, unbedded lensoid masses) (GS 1009).\" data-name=\"images/P946494.jpg\">(Plate 6). This deformation is discussed further in Chapter 9.\n\nIn the south of Cloud Hill Quarry, undivided Cloud Hill Dolostone consists of dolostones that are variably grey, pale buff and reddish grey, fine to coarsely crystalline and thin to very thickly bedded, with non-sutured stylolites and partings of clay and shaly mudstone (Plate 7). Crinoid debris is common to abundant and brachiopods and corals are locally present. Stratigraphically higher beds are characterised by a high moldic porosity.\n\nThe north-western face of Breedon Hill Quarry exposes a few metres of Cloud Hill Dolostone which unconformably overlies Milldale Limestone. A reddened bedding plane crowded with the trace fossil Thallasinoides (Plate 8) marks the unconformity surface. A specimen of the colonial coral Lithostrotion found nearby, assumed to have fallen from an inaccessible part of the Cloud Hill Dolostone, indicates a Viséan, post-Arundian age for the supra-unconformity strata.\n\nIn the Ticknall Borehole, Cloud Hill Dolostone occurs between 54.65 and 92.3 m (Figure 7). It is dated as Early Asbian age, on account of the presence of the foraminifera Pojarkovella nibelis together with Dainella holkeriana and Asbian miospores about 5 m above the base (Riley, 1997a). At the junction with the overlying Brigantian dolostones of the Ticknall Limestone Formation, the latter’s base consists of about 1 to 2 m of heterogeneous friable siltstones and sandstones bearing carbonate clasts. These lithologies resemble deposits laid down on a karstified top surface, suggesting that the Cloud Hill Dolostone is unconformable with the overlying Ticknall Limestone Formation.\n\nThe environment of deposition of the Cloud Hill Dolostone was that of a carbonate shelf, with deeper water occurring to the east (Breedon area) suggesting that the shelf floor may have sloped in that direction. In the southern part of Cloud Hill Quarry, the undivided beds of the Cloud Hill Dolostone (like the underlying Milldale Limestone Formation) were probably deposited during storm events on the shelf. Farther north in the quarry, deeper water environments are indicated for the Cloud Wood Member by the higher mudstone content, particularly above the basal unconformity which may, in part, represent a flooding surface. Up-sequence the incoming of the platform-rim mud-mound reef facies suggests that by Late Asbian times shallower water conditions prevailed, since the analogous Asbian-age cracoean buildups described by Mundy (1994) were probably developed in water depths not exceeding 170 m. This facies cannot be directly related to the sequences in the south of the quarry because the magnitude of the intervening faulting (Ambrose and Carney, 1997b; fig. 3) is not known. The strata seen in the Ticknall Borehole were deposited mainly in shallow-water, high-energy environments with periodic shoaling and emergence leading to the development of sabkha-peritidal carbonates (lime mudstones); peritidal conditions are further indicated by the ‘birds-eye’ textures found at some levels. Emergent conditions at the base of the formation are indicated by the grey, calcretic palaeosols in the Scot’s Brook Member.\n\nKey localities\n\nCloud Hill Quarry [SK 413 215]; Breedon Hill Quarry [SK 407 235]; Barrow Hill Quarry [SK 4217 2000]\n\nTicknall Limestone Formation (TL)\n\nThis unit, named by Monteleone (1973), crops out in the inliers around Ticknall, Calke Abbey, Staunton Harold and Worthington. It forms the topmost beds exposed at Cloud Hill Quarry (Ambrose and Carney, 1997b), and comprises the poorly exposed sequences of the Grace Dieu and Osgathorpe inliers. It has also been proved in the Ticknall and Worthington boreholes (Ambrose and Carney, 1997a, b). The type area for the formation is the former limestone quarries near Ticknall [SK 3626 2370] to [SK 3573 2422], with reference sections in the two boreholes. Foraminiferal determinations and macrofossils are consistent with a Brigantian age for the unit (Riley, 1997a). Oil shows occur in the Ticknall Borehole.\n\nThe formation consists of bedded limestones, dolostones and thinly interbedded carbonate and dark grey mudstone sequences. The last is well exposed (Plate 9) in former quarries at Ticknall [SK 360 238], together with massive dolostones and sandy dolostones which form the uppermost few metres of the formation. In the Ticknall and Worthington boreholes (Ambrose and Carney, 1997a, b) the formation includes about 10 m of strata comprising nodular carbonate associated with partings and thicker developments of dark grey, commonly shell-rich mudstone. This distinctive facies correlates with similar beds described from the Rotherwood Borehole of the Coalville district (Worssam and Old, 1988). Palaeosols, and karstic surfaces with green clayey drapes are typical of the formation (Figure 7), as are large gigantoproductid brachiopods.\n\nThe formation is at least 54.6 m thick in the Ticknall Borehole and estimated to be about 60 m thick in total around Ticknall; it is possibly up to 90 m between Worthington and Cloud Hill Quarry. In the Ticknall Borehole its base consists of a soft, red-brown and green mottled, silty mudstone overlain by red-brown, weakly calcareous sandstone with subrounded carbonate clasts, occurring below the more typical dolostone lithology. These sandy and muddy beds are interpreted as deposits laid down unconformably on a karstic surface developed on underlying Early Asbian strata (Riley, 1997a) of the Cloud Hill Dolostone. The higher beds in the borehole consist of buff to pale grey, fine to medium-grained dolostones and dolomitic limestones, with beds of lime mudstone and a few mudstone partings (Ambrose and Carney, 1997a). Visible bioclastic debris is rare but the presence of numerous bioclastic moulds suggests the unaltered rock contained a high proportion of bioclastic debris. In certain fine-grained limestone beds ‘birds-eye’ textures are preserved.\n\nIn the southern part of Cloud Hill Quarry the base of the formation is taken at the base of the lowest palaeosol. Above this is a sequence about 14 m thick consisting of predominantly thickly bedded dolostones.\n\nIn the Grace Dieu inlier, dolostones have been assigned a Brigantian age, based on the presence of Gigantoproductus (Kent, 1968), and are therefore correlated with the Ticknall Limestone Formation. Current exposures show only medium to thick-bedded dolostones (Carney, 1994), but earlier sections showed interbedded dolostones and mudstones, similar to those seen at Ticknall (Hull, 1860), with, in addition, calcareous conglomerates containing Charnian clasts (Kent, 1968). Kent suggested that the Grace Dieu strata were shoreline accumulations around the Charnian landmass, and Charnian rocks are indeed exposed only 100 m south of the outcrop. Little information is available for the Osgathorpe inlier and it is assumed to be Ticknall Limestone of similar Brigantian age. Dolostone blocks forming the walls of Osgathorpe Church include poorly sorted carbonate-clast conglomerates and coarse-grained lithologies with granules and pebbles of vein quartz, pink feldspar and pink granite. These building stones were probably worked locally, from former quarries on the Osgathorpe limestone outcrops.\n\nKey localities\n\nTicknall quarries [SK 3626 2370]–[SK 3573 2422]; Calke Abbey [SK 3699 2260]; Osgathorpe [SK 4286 1924]; Grace Dieu [SK 4321 1813].\n\nWidmerpool Half-Graben Sequences\n\nBasinal Dinantian strata are confined to the Widmerpool Half-graben, which is delimited to the south by the Mackworth and Normanton Hills faults (Figure 6).\" data-name=\"images/P946471.jpg\">(Figure 5a). Despite their deep concealment beneath Namurian and/or Triassic cover, the thicknesses and to some extent the lithology of these off-shelf sequences are reasonably well constrained by seismic interpretations (see section on Sheet 141 Loughborough) and by deep hydrocarbon exploration boreholes.\n\nLong Eaton Formation (LE)\n\nThis formation is named for the sequence of mudstones and predominantly thin-bedded limestones proved in the Long Eaton No.1 Hydrocarbon Borehole (Brandon, 1996); it has also been identified in the Ratcliffe on Soar Hydrocarbon Borehole (Carney and Cooper, 1997; see (Figure 1) for location). It is the principal syn-rift sequence within the Widmerpool Half-graben, corresponding to seismostratigraphic units EC3 to EC5 of Ebdon et al. (1990). At least 1867 m of these strata were proved to terminal depth in the Long Eaton No.1 Hydrocarbon Borehole. Seismic interpretations further show that the formation thickens progressively south-westwards, above the inclined floor of the half-graben, to attain a maximum of about 4000 m in the hanging wall of the Normanton Hills Fault.\n\nThe lithology of borehole chip samples suggests that the formation consists mainly of grey or brown, thinly interbedded calcareous mudstones and siltstones with beds of bioclastic limestone and graded calcisiltite, packstone and grainstone (Brandon, 1996; Carney and Cooper, 1997). Deposition of these strata was probably by sediment gravity flow mechanisms and the beds are interpreted as turbidites. Below 1980 m depth in the Long Eaton No.1 Borehole, evaporitic minerals occur in the form of anhydrite pseudomorphs after gypsum (electron microprobe determinations by T Milodowski, cited in Riley, 1997b). These occurrences may imply periodic exposure to surface evaporation but could also be due to later tectonic activity, which caused ponding of saline groundwaters within the Widmerpool Half-graben.\n\nMicrofaunas show an Early Chadian to Asbian age range for the cored strata. However, the apparent absence of Arundian and Late Chadian beds in deeper sections proved by the Long Eaton Borehole (Riley, 1997b) suggests a hiatus which is in a similar stratigraphical position to that represented by the unconformity (Main Breedon Discontinuity) within the shelf sequences exposed at Cloud Hill Quarry. The same break was recognised in the seismic stratigraphy of the Widmerpool Half-graben and attributed to a late Holkerian phase of basin inversion by Fraser and Gawthorpe (1990).\n\nLockington Limestone Formation (Loc)\n\nThis unit is 185 thick in the Long Eaton No.1 Hydrocarbon Borehole, from where it was first named (Brandon, 1996), and 143 m are present in the Ratcliffe on Soar Hydrocarbon Borehole (Carney and Cooper, 1997). It was recognised in part by its distinctively serrated signature on wireline logs (Figure 8). The formation consists mainly of packages 15, to 30 m thick, of brown, argillaceous to sandy turbidite-facies limestone. These are separated by thinner sequences of pyritic, carbonaceous mudstone.\n\nWidmerpool Formation (WdF)\n\nThe Widmerpool Formation (Aitkenhead, 1977), of Late Asbian and Brigantian age, has a maximum thickness of 741 m in the Widmerpool Half-graben. It is not confined to that structure, however, since its attenuated equivalents, 110 to 130 m thick, have also been identified at depth on parts of the Hathern Shelf. The unit does not crop out, but boreholes suggest small subcrops beneath the Trent floodplain north-east of Melbourne [SK 395 269]. In the Long Eaton No.1 Borehole, the base of the formation is taken at the upper surface of the Lockington Limestone Formation, which is easily recognisable on wireline logs (Brandon, 1996). This boundary occurs within a broad interval of time spanning about 100 m of strata marking the change from Asbian to Brigantian-age microfaunal assemblages (Riley, 1997b). The top of the unit is taken at the base of the Namurian, Cravenoceras leion biozone; identification of this biozone in the Ratcliffe on Soar Borehole is based on a comparison (Figure 8) with the wireline log of the fully cored Duffield Borehole (Aitkenhead, 1977).\n\nThe Ratcliffe on Soar Hydrocarbon Borehole (Figure 8) proved the maximum thickness for the formation in the Widmerpool Half-graben. The limited core and chip samples show that the principal lithologies comprise dark to pale brown, calcareous and locally carbonaceous, pyritic mudstones grading to argillaceous limestone or calcareous sandstone (Carney and Cooper, 1997). Near the top of the formation, the Ratcliffe Volcanic Member (RaV) is about 124 m thick. It comprises five tuff beds intercalated with green or brown mudstones. The member can be correlated, on the basis of its wireline log signatures, with similar tuffaceous beds occupying the P2 Zone in the Duffield Borehole of the Derby district (Aitkenhead, 1977). This in turn suggests an equivalent age to similar units farther north, for example the Tissington Volcanic Member of the Ashbourne district (Chisholm et al., 1988).\n\nOn the Hathern Shelf, attenuated equivalents of the Widmerpool Formation have been tentatively identified in some of the deeper boreholes (Figure 6), although the borehole descriptions are generally not detailed enough to confirm the correlation. The absence of the formation from the outcropping shelf sequences around Melbourne, Ticknall and Breedon, and from the Worthington Borehole, suggests that the western parts of the Hathern Shelf remained uplifted at this time, relative to the northern and eastern parts.\n\nAbout 130 m of mudstones and argillaceous limestones occurring between the Ticknall Limestone Formation and Edale Shale Group in the Ashby No. G1 Borehole are referred to the Widmerpool Formation (Brandon, 1997).\n\nThe formation may be represented in the Hathern Hydrocarbon No.1 Borehole, where 110 m of grey to black calcareous mudstones with a fauna of brachiopods, crinoid ossicles and fish remains occur between limestones of Chadian age (that possibly correlate with the Milldale Limestone Formation) and the Namurian Edale Shale Group. The age of these calcareous mudstones is not known (George et al., 1976). Their lithology and stratigraphical position suggests that they may be part of the Widmerpool Formation, but this could imply that the base of that unit is a major unconformity (Figure 6).\n\nLimited information provided by borehole chip samples suggest that the Widmerpool Formation can be interpreted as a deep-water turbidite sequence that accumulated by sediment gravity flow processes. The formation is considerably thicker in these boreholes than the 130 m recorded on the Hathern Shelf, suggesting that subsidence within the Widmerpool Half-graben continued well into Brigantian times. In fact, Ebdon et al. (1990) suggested active subsidence during the early Brigantian (their EC5 seismostratigraphical sequence), accompanied by the inundation of some shelf margins and the uplift of others. Later in the Brigantian, subsidence waned concomitantly with the onset of volcanic activity and increased tectonic instability at the north-eastern margin of the graben; this later period of time equates with the ages of the EC5 and early LC1 seismostratigraphical sequences of Ebdon et al. (1990).\n\nPlatform Sequences\n\nThe nature of the Dinantian strata deposited within the structural Platform domain (Figure 6).\" data-name=\"images/P946471.jpg\">(Figure 5a) is not known. In the Coalville district, to the south, the Rotherwood Borehole [SK 3458 1559] showed that between Cambrian basement and Millstone Grit there occurs 114 m of Brigantian-age dolostones. The sequence includes nodular limestone beds thinly intercalated with dark grey mudstones (Worssam and Old, 1988), which is an association typical of that seen in the Ticknall Limestone Formation of the Ticknall and Worthington boreholes. Carbonates of the Platform domain are therefore inferred to represent lateral extensions of the Ticknall Limestone Formation.\n\nNamurian\n\nNamurian strata record the commencement of the ‘post-rift megasequence’ of Fraser and Gawthorpe (1990). Broadly speaking the Dinantian/Namurian boundary corresponds to a change in regional tectonism, from one of faulting and rift development to a regime dominated by passive thermal subsidence. Interpretations by Fulton and Williams (1988) suggest that factors such as eustatic sea-level change, basinal flexuring and local faulting also played a part in controlling Namurian sedimentation.\n\nIn this district, a broad, twofold subdivision of Namurian strata is recognised, similar to that seen farther north in the main Pennine Basin. In the model of Fulton and Williams (1988), the earliest sequences, here correlated with the Edale Shale Group, represent infilling of the remaining tectonic basins by mudstones interbedded with turbidite siltstones and sandstones. The succeeding Millstone Grit Group represents the progradation of shallower water deltas, precursors to the swampy, upper delta-plain environments of the Westphalian Coal Measures.\n\nEdale Shale Group (ESH)\n\nThe Edale Shale Group is generally defined as the mudstone and turbidite sequence which commences at the base of the Cravenoceras leion Marine Band and terminates at the base of the first feldspathic sandstone typical of the Millstone Grit Group (Stevenson and Gaunt, 1971). It is not exposed in the district, and its top surface is particularly difficult to place, but its general distribution can be inferred from seismic records and a few deep boreholes. In the Ratcliffe on Soar Borehole (Carney and Cooper, 1997), 166 m of strata lying below the Triassic unconformity were identified as Edale Shale Group on the basis of wireline log correlations with the Duffield Borehole (Figure 8), located within the graben in the Derby district (Aitkenhead, 1977). In the Ratcliffe Borehole, the base of the group is taken at the lower surface of a 70 m-thick package of strata identified as the Pendleian-age (E1a) Cravenoceras leion biozone. All of the other Pendleian zones in the Duffield Borehole, up to and including Cravenoceras malhamense (E1c), are also present in the Ratcliffe Borehole. The lithologies of the core samples suggest a sequence composed of dark grey, calcareous mudstone. Sandstone packages average about 9 m thick, but are not common; their gamma-ray ‘lows’ identify them. They correspond to the graded, turbiditic sandstones proved at the same stratigraphical levels in the Duffield Borehole.\n\nOn the Hathern Shelf, the Ashby G1 Borehole (Brandon, 1997) proved, below the Trias, 130 m of calcareous mudstones containing Eumorphoceras bisulcatum (=E. ferrimontanum), that is indicative of an Arnsbergian age, younger than the highest Edale Shale beds in the Ratcliffe Borehole. The Hathern No.1 Hydrocarbon Borehole (Brandon, 1994) proved at least 137 m of the group above possible Widmerpool Formation strata. Samples from this sequence yielded remains of Orbiculoidea sp. and the ammonoids ‘Eumorphoceras’ and ‘Anthracoceras’. Like the Widmerpool Formation, the Edale Shale Group may be absent from the Worthington Borehole, and from around Melbourne (Figure 9), but it is also possible that the group may interdigitate with the lower part of the Millstone Grit Group.\n\nMillstone Grit Group (MG)\n\nThe Millstone Grit Group (Stevenson and Gaunt, 1971) comprises a sequence of mudstone with interbedded sandstones that lies below the Subcrenatum Marine Band. In its type area of north Derbyshire it has been divided into a number of thick sandstone-dominated packages (the ‘grits’), none of which is as yet formally defined. In this district the group is principally exposed north-east of the Thringstone Fault, around Melbourne and Staunton Harold, with smaller inliers located close to the fault on the upthrown side near Thringstone, Pegg’s Green and Newbold. It is exposed at Carver’s Rocks and has also been penetrated in many of the deeper shafts and exploration boreholes in the Northwest Leicestershire and South Derbyshire coalfields, to the south-west of the Thringstone Fault. No provings of Millstone Grit have been made to the north-east of the Normanton Hills Fault, but the group is inferred from seismic profiles to underlie Coal Measures or Triassic strata across much of the east and north-east of the district (Figure 16).\n\nThe thickness of the Millstone Grit is considerably less than that recorded in the Derby district (Sheet 125) (Frost and Smart, 1979); however, the precise details of the attenuation are not everywhere clear owing to the lack of marine-band control over most of this district. The Melbourne and Worthington boreholes proved complete, but highly attenuated sequences, with respective thicknesses of 156.25 m and 115.2 m (Figure 9). Significant local attenuations additionally occur at the top of, and within, the Millstone Grit, for example at Worthington. Southward thinning of the unit (towards the Wales–Brabant Barrier) is apparent between the Melbourne outcrops and Worthington Borehole, and between the latter and the Rotherwood Borehole in the Coalville District (Worssam and Old, 1988), in keeping with the trend indicated by the isopach diagram of Fulton and Williams (1988). Although the group consists mainly of mudstones and interbedded sandstones, minor siltstones, coals and seatearths are also present. Marine bands and Lingula bands occur throughout the sequence, with up to ten recognised between various boreholes. Sandstones in the lower part of the sequence are commonly crossbedded, pebbly and locally conglomeratic, with mainly well-rounded vein quartz and quartzite pebbles; those in the middle part of the group contain a conspicuous pink variety of feldspar as sand to small pebble-size clasts (white feldspar is also present).\n\nThe Millstone Grit sandstones have long been regarded as being of deltaic origin. They are characteristically rich in feldspar grains derived from a northerly source (e.g. Trewin and Holdsworth, 1973; Jones, 1980) which was deflected to the north-north-west along the Widmerpool Gulf by the Wales–Brabant landmass which lay to the south of the district. Ongoing heavy mineral studies (Hallsworth, 1998) suggest significant variations in heavy mineral ratios and garnet geochemistry for the sandstones of this district. The unnamed sandstones in the lower part of the sequence, below the Ashover Grit, are monazite-poor whereas sandstones of the Ashover Grit, and those above, are monaziterich and thus more typical of the northerly derived Millstone Grit in Yorkshire. Possibly the monazite-poor source region included the upland area of the Wales–Brabant Massif, lying to the south of the district.\n\nThroughout the district the Millstone Grit overlies Dinantian strata with varying degrees of unconformity. In the Worthington Borehole (Figure 9), the lowest identifiable marine band, 5 m above the base, contains Cravenoceras subplicatum, probably indicating the Cravenoceratoides nitidus Zone E2b2, of Mid-Arnsbergian age (Riley, 1998). This suggests that the Pendleian and at least part of the Arnsbergian stages may be absent from the south-western part of the Hathern Shelf (Figure 6).\" data-name=\"images/P946471.jpg\">(Figure 5a). The occurrence of a thick, feldspathic sandstone bed immediately above Dinantian carbonates in the Worthington and Melbourne boreholes may indicate that the Edale Shale Group is not present. On the other hand, the two boreholes show thick ‘Edale’-type turbiditic mudstones and siltstones above this sandstone, suggesting interdigitation with the Millstone Grit lithology. Farther south, inliers of Millstone Grit around Thringstone include the Bilinguites gracilis Marine Band, and are therefore a little older than basal Marsdenian in age (Carney, 1994). Similarly in the Rotherwood Borehole (Worssam and Old, 1988), located within the Platform domain, the Millstone Grit only just extends downwards into the Kinderscoutian which rests directly on Dinantian strata.\n"
