        "text": "1. International Territorial Levels (ITLs)\n\nTo distinguish the replacement UK classification from its EU predecessor, the UK-managed classification is referred to as International Territorial Levels (ITLs) and adopts a convention used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) member countries. These ITLs therefore align with international standards, enabling comparability internationally.\n\nThe ITLs have been established as a mirror to the previous Eurostat NUTS system used by the UK and will follow a similar timetable to the review of the NUTS system, meaning ITLs will be reviewed roughly every three years.\n\nThe upcoming ITL update has been delayed to allow further time for consideration of potential boundary changes. For example, there are proposed changes to the ITL2 and ITL3 boundaries for Scotland that would ensure that they align with administrative boundaries, bringing them more closely in line with the methodology used in the rest of the UK. The Scottish Government are undertaking consultation on the proposed changes to the Scottish ITL and the results from this will feed into the update process. It is anticipated that the new set of ITL boundaries will be delivered later in 2024 for adoption from Jan 2025.\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n2.
