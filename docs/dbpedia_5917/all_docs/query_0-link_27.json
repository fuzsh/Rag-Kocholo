Mollie and Emily were both just wonderful to work with as well. We will be returning next year!”\n\n“The staff was well organized and informational. They offered our students a wonderful experience full of knowledge about the Kentucky Derby Museum. Learning about all the different aspects of the Kentucky Derby including the history, the race, seeing the track, items from the races, and the venue was a great experience. The wrap around video at the end was very neat to watch as well! We had a wonderful experience and hope to attend again next year with a new class of students.”"
