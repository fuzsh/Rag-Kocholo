Lombe’s Mill, a silk throwing mill, was built by Thomas Lombe in 1721 on an island located on the River Derwent. It was built after his brother, John Lombe visited Piedmont and returned to England with information on Italian silk-throwing machines and Italian craftsmanship.

Following the donation of the land by businessman and philanthropist, Joseph Strutt, the park was designed by John Claudius Loudon, a Scottish botanist and garden designer, the park was then opened to the public in 1840.\n\nAccording to sources, Frederick Law Olmsted, designer of New York’s Central Park, visited numerous parks and gardens around England in 1850. Some of the places he visited were Birmingham Botanical Gardens, Chatsworth, Birkenhead Park, Chirk Castle and of course, Derby Arboretum. It is believed that Olmsted incorporated elements of the English countryside and fragments of Loudon’s work into his design for Central Park.\n\n3) Royal Crown Derby Was A Supplier For The Titanic\n\nOne of the oldest remaining porcelain manufacturers in England, Royal Crown Derby (as the name suggests) is based in Derby. Known for producing high-quality and elegant fine bone China pieces of tableware and ornamental ware since 1750, Royal Crown Derby is a household name in the UK. In 1911, Royal Crown Derby supplied tableware for the first-class dining suite of the famous Titanic. The order included 600 dinner plates, 150 breakfast plates, 150 soup plates, 100 salad plates, 150 breakfast cups and saucers, 100 teacups and saucers, 36 creams and 25 slop bowls. Unfortunately, most of the tableware was lost or destroyed when the ship sank.\n\n4) World’s Largest Collection of John Wright’s Paintings\n\nJoseph Wright was a famous 18th century painter born and raised in Derby.
