        "text": "What Is Pride Park Like?\n\nThe Club moved to Pride Park in 1997 after spending 102 years at their former Baseball Ground home. The stadium, which was opened by Her Majesty the Queen, is totally enclosed with all corners being filled. One corner is filled with executive boxes, giving the stadium a continental touch. The large Toyota West Stand which runs down one side of the pitch is two-tiered, complete with a row of executive boxes. The rest of the ground is smaller in size than the West Stand, as the roof drops a tier to the other sides, making it look unbalanced. It is a pity that the West Stand could not be replicated throughout the rest of the stadium as this would have made it truly magnificent. An unusual feature inside the stadium is next to the home dugout there is a statue of former player Steve Bloomer who overlooks the pitch. Outside the stadium on one corner is a statue of Brian Clough and Peter Taylor.\n\nPride Park entrances\n\nThe main entrance to Pride Park is in front of the West Stand. Once inside the ground of Pride Park, home fans are able to enter the stadium via all available turnstiles with the exception of those found in the corner between the East stand and South stand. This part of the ground is considered the entrance for away fans.\n\nFan songs\n\nFuture Stadium Developments\n\nIn 2017, the club applied for planning permission to extend the East Stand at Pride Park. The expansion would not only increase have increased the capacity at the stadium but also brought with it a new fan zone with bars and restaurants.\n\nSeven years later and there have been no further developments which indicates that Pride Park will remains as it is for the time being, which is hardly a surprise when you consider the club’s recent financial troubles.\n\nWhat is it Like For Visiting Supporters?\n\nAway fans are located in one corner of the stadium, between the East and South Stands, where up to 2,700 fans can be housed. The facilities within the stadium and view of the playing action are both very good. This coupled with normally a great atmosphere and a deafening PA system, make for a memorable experience.\n\nEntrance to the stadium is via electronic turnstiles, meaning that you have to insert your ticket into an electronic reader to gain entry.\n\nAvailable on the concourse are a selection of pies, pasties, burgers and hot dogs. There are televisions on the concourses showing the game going on inside, with commentary, so that you don’t have to miss anything while waiting for your half-time cuppa.\n\nGround History\n\nThe Rams initially held their games at the County Cricket ground but they shared the stadium with a cricket club. Eventually, Derby had one too many fixture clashes with the Derbyshire cricket club and for this reason they chose to relocate. The Francis Ley baseball ground became Derby County’s stadium for over a century from 1895 to 1997. The Baseball Ground could hold up to 42,000 fans at its peak; Derby subsequently moved to Pride Park in 1997. All of Derby’s three home grounds have hosted England’s international matches making Derby the only team to host England’s international games at three different grounds.\n\nPubs for away fans\n\nPride Park is in an industrial estate so there aren’t too many pub options in the vicinity. The closest pub to the stadium is a Harvester which usually accepts away supporters. Other pubs to consider are:\n\nThe Navigation Inn – 805 London Road, Alvaston, Derby DE24 8UU\n\nThe Merlin – 1 Orient Way, Derby DE24 8XL\n\nThe Brunswick Inn – 1 Railway Terrace, Derby DE1 2RU\n\nDirections and Car Parking\n\nFrom the M1, exit at Junction 25 and take the A52 towards Derby. Pride Park Stadium is signposted off the A52 after about seven miles.\n\nThere is a designated away fans car park located at the Derby Conference Centre on the A6 London Road (DE24 8UX), which costs £5 per car. After parking up there you need to go into the Conference Centre Reception to pay for your parking. They will then give you a ticket which then display on your dashboard. The Centre is handily located near to the Navigation Inn, which is a popular pub for visiting supporters. It is then around a 10-15 minute walk to the away turnstiles.\n\nThere is also a fair-sized car park at the Derby Arena (DE24 8JB) which has a capacity of around 1,100 vehicles and is situated next to Pride Park.\n\nThere are also a number of businesses located off the main A52 near the stadium that offer parking.\n\nSteve Cocker, a visiting supporter to Pride Park informs us: ‘There is free street parking available on Downing Road on the West Meadow Industrial Estate (DE21 6HA), which is off the A52. It is then about a 10-15 minute walk to the stadium. Make sure that you get there in plenty of time before the kick off, as the road fills up quickly.’\n\nPost Code for SAT NAV: DE24 8XL\n\nBy Train\n\nPride Park is about a 10 minute walk away from Derby Railway Station and is signposted.\n\nIf you want the pubs by the station, then turn left at the top of the stairs from the platform and on exiting the station entrance turn right. Further down on the right just past the Brunswick cross over the road and then descend some steps use the underpass, and follow the fans. The stadium is about a 20-minute walk in total from the station using this route.\n\nTicket Prices\n\nTicket prices for Derby County for the 2023/24 season are as follows:\n\nAdults: £24-32\n\nSeniors: £18-24\n\n18-21: £18-24\n\n13-17: £12-16\n\n6-12: £6-8\n\n2-5: Free\n\nProgramme Price\n\nOfficial Programme £3.\n\nBiggest Rivals\n\nDerby vs Nottingham Forest rivalry: Both of these sides are located in the East Midlands with the game dubbed “El Cloughico” owing to their legendary manager Brian Clough, who managed both sides. It is one of the fiercest rivalries in English football and, recently, the victor of this tie wins the Brian Clough Trophy meaning there is more than just points at stake.\n\nDerby vs Leicester City rivalry: Again, this rivalry is down to location. Although recent meetings between these sides have become one-sided with the Foxes enjoying huge success in recent times. That said it is fair to point out that both teams consider Nottingham Forest as their main rival.\n\nDerby vs Leeds rivalry: This rivalry started in back 1972 when Derby beat Leeds to the Division One title. Since then, the game has been full of spice with things often taking a violent turn.\n\nFixture List\n\nDerby County FC fixture list\n\nDisabled facilities\n\nFor details of disabled facilities at the ground please visit the relevant page on the Level Playing Field website.\n\nPride Park Stadium Tours\n\nPeriodically the Club offer tours of the Pride Park Stadium which are priced at £10 per person.
