        "text": "A tornado outbreak took place in the Great Lakes region where the strongest upper winds interacted with the sharp cold front. The area around Janesville, Wisconsin was the hardest hit as an F4 twister flattened farms and took nine lives. It was the worst tornado outbreak ever seen in November in the north-central U.S. with several F2-F4 tornadoes and thirteen fatalities. To add insult to injury, the tornadoes were followed by terrible cold and wind. People helping with the Janesville disaster had to do their grim tornado recovery work in blizzard conditions.\n\nCloser to home, the entire state of Indiana was swept by strong, damaging winds. Great losses to property and agriculture were reported, along with many injuries and at least one death. In Kentucky there were losses reported throughout the Commonwealth, with the greatest concentration of destruction in the western portion. Homes and barns were unroofed and telephone, telegraph, and railroad services were greatly hindered. Louisville was cut off from communication with surrounding cities for several hours."
