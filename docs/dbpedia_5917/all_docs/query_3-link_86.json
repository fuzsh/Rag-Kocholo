        "text": "Greater Niagara Region\n\nFrank Campbell\n\nCapt. Dave Scipione of Lewiston hit the Niagara Bar this week, dropping his first line at the drop off in 130 feet of water near the Canadian line. Before he could put the second line down, the first line went off. That first line was a wire diver with a Dreamweaver green glow frog spoon. On board were Amber Schmigel and Bob Carney, both of North Tonawanda. When they finally reeled the fish in, the line was put back out and it fired again. It was difficult getting all of the rods out. Best spoons were the DW and Warrior Rodfather spoons, DW Green Jeans, and DW Burnt Toast spoons, in addition to the green glow frog. They caught several 20-pound class kings, as well as Coho salmon, brown trout, and lake trout during the trip.\n\nCapt. Mike Johannes of On the Rocks Charters out of Wilson reports that fishing action continues to be good. His most recent trip out was a few miles west of his home port in 80 to 200 feet of water. He found good water temperatures from 40 to 100 feet down. Spoons such as Bad Toad, Road Toad, and 2Face were working well. His biggest king salmon was just over 22 pounds. He found that mature salmon were being caught out of temperature, so keep that in mind when trolling out there right now. Don’t be afraid to put your lures above the preferred temperature range. Karen Evarts at the Tackle Barn/Boat Doctors in Olcott says fishing continues to be very good. Some boats start at 200 feet of water and head north. Others are starting in 150 feet of water and heading south. Spoons are still a staple, but Evarts says meat rigs and flasher-fly in green or white mania are catching fish, too. Remember that the Greater Niagara Fish Odyssey, and the Lake Ontario Counties Fall Derby both start next Friday, August 16. That date is also the Reelin’ for a Cure ladies tournament out of Wilson and Olcott.\n\nCapt. Ned LiBrock of Catching Dreams Charters has been taking kids with cancer fishing in our productive waters for nearly a decade now. Last Friday, he made more kids happy as he held the third annual reel impact tournament to benefit Catching Dreams in the lower Niagara River. Fifteen area charter captains helped the cause by taking sponsors and guests out fishing. There were a few special kids on the water, too. In the end, it was an outstanding day of fishing and fun as some 236 fish were caught in 4 hours. The biggest fish, a salmon, was reeled in by Mike Lillis of Kenmore, fishing with Capt. Frank Campbell.\n\nThe most fish were hauled in by sponsoring business EcoLab with Robert Ruslander, Tim Kozinko and Chris Librock, fishing with Capt. Connor Cinelli of Grand Island. They recorded 31 walleyes on the Niagara Bar near the green can. Despite a little rain, it failed to dampen the spirits of the participants, raising some much-needed funds for the kids. Orange worm harnesses did the trick.\n\nWayne County Fishing Update\n\nChris Kenyon\n\nLake Ontario\n\nThe salmon bite has slowed. Fish straight out from Sodus Bay and to Port Bay. Currently, they have been scattered in 130 to 250 fow. Down 90 feet has been working. The best bait is meat rigs, flasher flies, and mag spoons.\n\nA cold front is coming through this evening and Tuesday. We will have to see what it does to the roaming kings.\n\nBays\n\nFishing has been tough in Sodus Bay with largemouth bass being the dominant catch. Fish them with your Senko rigs, or top water bait next to the weed beds.\n\nThe water in Port Bay has turned because of the constant heat. It’s now a murky -green color. The best bet would be the points and near the east side of the bay. Channel fishing has been non-existent. Maybe the predicted rainfall will push more water out the channel and produce some catches.\n\nErie Canal\n\nThe bass fishing has been excellent in the Widewaters section of the canal. Don’t forget to shore fish next to the locks. When they open and close it stirs up the bottom. Bass, walleye, sunnies, and pike can be caught next to the locks.\n\nNotable Freshwater Fishing Regulation Changes\n\nThe following list offers a brief summary of the most notable fishing regulation changes resulting from the adopted rulemakings described above.\n\nNew statewide regulation for rainbow trout, brown trout, and splake in lakes and ponds. The season will now be open year-round, with a five-fish daily limit, any size, with a “no more than two longer than 12 inches” harvest rule.\n\nStatewide Atlantic salmon regulations will now allow for a year-round open season.\n\nIce fishing is permitted on all waters in New York unless specifically prohibited with the exception of Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Hamilton, Herkimer, Lewis, St. Lawrence, Warren, and Washington counties where previous rules remain.\n\nNew specific dates replaced floating dates for statewide season openers to include:\n\nMay 1 – Walleye, Northern Pike, Pickerel, and Tiger Muskellunge. June 1 – Muskellunge. (Note that in 2022, DEC will allow for the fishing of muskellunge beginning the last Saturday in May to accommodate previously planned fishing trips); and\n\nJune 15 – Largemouth and Smallmouth Bass.\n\nA five-fish daily walleye limit in Oneida Lake.\n\nA new regulation to limit the growth of the walleye population in Skaneateles Lake. No daily possession limit; 12-inch minimum size limit, open year-round.\n\nThe statewide sunfish daily harvest limit has been reduced from 50 to 25 fish.\n\nThe statewide minimum size limit for crappie has been increased from nine inches to ten inches.\n\nOrleans County\n\nOrleans County Sportfishing Coordinator Ron Bierstine:\n\nThe trolling fleet has spread out some lately with some boaters staying on the inside zone out to 200 fow while others are heading toward the “fence.” Neither is a bad choice really as the trout and salmon are likewise spread out through the open Lake waters east and west of Point Breeze. Fishing pressure may have eased a bit now that we are in between the Summer and Fall LOC Derbies and before the upcoming Labor Day holiday. August is prime time though for big Kings and most charters and serious recs will be busy. Looks like a break in the heat and humidity is upon us for this mid and end of week. East and NE winds forecast for the mid week has the chance to mix up water temps so be prepared to search out new patterns if that takes place. Water temps have been changeable all season anyway so that’s not new info for serious rec and charter anglers!\n\nCapt. Chas Townsend of Searcher Charters has been mostly working the inside water at less then 200 fow. He has the patience and skill to hook up on 7 – 8 big matures in a day and his clients like those odds for big fish! “The water temps change daily but the fish have frequently been coming out of temp. At 60 ft, its 70°F. The fish are getting a little darker too but don’t have red bellies from laying on the bottom yet.” Fall is approaching though and staging and tributary action is not far off.\n\nCapt. Mike Lavender of Intimidator Charters says “the past couple days were hit or miss. Kings seem to be liking the warm side of the water. Spoons early, glow anything patterns and as the day progresses flasher flies and meat have been productive. Seventy – 120 ft down with tricky currents so don’t be afraid to vary speed. The carbon 14 meat rig from Minion Tackle has been rocking them.”\n\nAugust and end of summer means the best and biggest kings of the open lake season here in the Orleans County, Lake Ontario waters! We hope we see you tied into a rod-bending, reel-screaming king soon! Don’t forget about fresh chrome steelhead or fat browns, cohos and lakers too!\n\nOswego County\n\nSalmon fishing has gone from ridiculously good to more normal levels. The days of quick limits have settled and looking at the forecast, we don’t foresee any major improvements.\n\nWeekly Report Highlights:\n\nLake Ontario (Oswego): consistent salmon catches came from 500-700’ of water.\n\nLake Ontario (Mexico): 2-3 hour brown limits have been the norm lately!\n\nOrder a free fishing guide, Click Here.\n\nLake Ontario – Oswego\n\nClick Here of the 10 day Forecast\n\nThe most consistent salmon catches this week came from 500-700’ of water. But many anglers also found some success from 120-300’. The bite at the higher levels being more sporadic. We are starting to see more mature fish, so start considering the warmer 57-60 degree water for a starting point early in the day.\n\nMeat rigs and spoons are still the top producers. But flasher fly rigs are starting to take a fair number of bites.\n\nLake Ontario – Oswego, Mexico, Port Ontario NY\n\nClick Here of the 10 day Forecast\n\nThe salmon have been elusive in Mexico bay. But the brown trout are making for the lack. 2-3 hour limits have been the norm. 70-100’ of water has been the best. With the onslaught of NE winds, the fish should be moving shallower. Stinger and stingray sizes have been working best. Tight lines everyone!\n\nFree Oswego Fishing Guide\n\nRead About the Guide Here\n\nThe updated Oswego County Fishing and Hunting Guide is now available online and in print. The guide features a new cover and an expanded listing of fishing guides and charters.\n\nThe 67-page guide includes a detailed overview of fishing opportunities on eastern Lake Ontario, Oneida Lake, the Oswego and Salmon rivers and a variety of other tributaries, as well as the more than 40,000 acres of public lands available for hunting."
