        "text": "Emergency housing is often very basic.\n\nIt could be a:\n\nself contained flat\n\nhotel or bed and breakfast (B&B)\n\nhostel or refuge with some shared areas, such as kitchens or bathrooms\n\nTell the council if sharing facilities puts anyone in your household at risk of infection or illness.\n\nA room in someone's house is not B&B accommodation even if you share facilities.\n\nIf you have children or are pregnant\n\nYou should not have to stay in a:\n\nprivately owned B&B where you share a bathroom, toilet or kitchen with other people\n\nhotel or somewhere you do not have a kitchen or somewhere to cook\n\nThe council should only put you and your family in a hotel or B&B if there is nowhere else.\n\nYou should not have to stay in a B&B for more than 6 weeks. The council should offer more suitable housing as soon as they can.\n\nThis time limit does not apply if you moved to the UK in the last 2 years. You may have to stay in a B&B for longer.\n\nThere should be enough space for cots for children under 2 years. The council might have to help you get a cot if you need one, especially if you had to leave in an emergency, for example because of domestic abuse.\n\nIf you're 16 or 17\n\nYou should not be housed in a B&B or a hotel at all.\n\nIf you are a care leaver under 25, the council should not use B&Bs or hotels to house you unless there is nowhere else.\n\nIf you have pets\n\nPets are not usually allowed in emergency housing.\n\nThe council might have emergency housing which accepts pets. Ask about this. Tell them how important it is for you to keep your pet.\n\nSome charities run pet fostering schemes for people if you have to move into emergency housing or refuges because of domestic abuse:\n\nThe Freedom Project – run by Dogs Trust in many parts of England and Scotland\n\nEndeavour – domestic abuse charity offering pet fostering in North West England\n\nLifeline – run by Cats Protection in London, the South East, East Anglia, the Midlands and Yorkshire\n\nLetswithPets has advice on finding a pet friendly private tenancy.\n\nPaying for emergency housing\n\nEmergency housing must be affordable for you. You do not have to pay for it up front.\n\nYou can usually get help through universal credit or housing benefit.\n\nAsk the council which benefit to claim and if there are other service charges. For example, for cleaning, maintenance or support.\n\nStoring your furniture\n\nEmergency housing is usually furnished.\n\nThe council must arrange storage for your belongings if you cannot do this yourself. They usually charge for this service.\n\nStaying with family or friends\n\nThe council might ask if you can stay with family or friends in the short term.\n\nThis is sometimes called being homeless at home.\n\nThe council must still:\n\nlook into your situation\n\nhelp you with a personal housing plan\n\ndecide if they must help you with longer term housing\n\nThe council might say you're not homeless if they think you can stay with family or friends.\n\nMake sure you tell them if you cannot stay there. For example, if you’re at risk of abuse there or your family has told you to leave."
