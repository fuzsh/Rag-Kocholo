        "text": "Thursday-Saturday, August 8-10, 2024\n\nTICKETS ON SALE NOW!\n\nClick to purchase tickets and/or reserved seats to the 42nd Annual Sunoco North/South 100!\n\n$75,000 to win Feature caps off huge weekend of racing.\n\nThe 42nd Annual Sunoco Race Fuels North/South 100 presented by Lucas Oil will be August 8th-10th and will be growing once again.

Finally, the Sunoco Race Fuels North/South 100 feature event will pay $75,000 to win, and, an event record, $3,500 to start for a feature purse of over $200,000.

PLEASE SEE THE CAMPING RULES BELOW.\n\nNo coolers of any kind will be allowed in any grandstand areas.\n\nNo chairs or cushions with seat backs will be allowed in any grandstand areas.\n\nDue to the large crowd expected to attend, and the crowding issues in the infield, No ATV’s, golf carts, side by sides, or other motorized vehicles will be allowed in the infield. Each team may have one ATV or similar vehicle for tools and tires in the infield, but it only can be in the designated hot pit area, and only while that team’s car is on the track. NO standing on ATV’s or Pit boxes while in the infield\n\nTravel Routes:\n\nFor those using online mapping sites or GPS navigation, the track’s physical address is 12234 US 42, Walton, KY 41094.\n\nFrom the North on I-71/75:\n\nTake exit 180(Florence/Union/US 42) off I-75/71.

For more information, click the link HERE.\n\nCamping:\n\nCamping is allowed at the track free of charge during the North/South week and weekend. No hookups are available. The camping areas will be marked and site maps with the camping areas marked will be posted at the track. You can begin marking camping spots at 12:00 PM on Saturday August 3rd and at any time during the week after that. All camping spots are first come first served.\n\nNo staging for backstretch camping before Thursday August 1st at 12 pm.\n\nNOTE: CAMPING PROCEDURE FOR 2024. In an effort to help with some of the congestion on the opening day of camping, we will be using the same procedure for camper staging as 2023. For those who want to camp in the lots to the Southwest of the speedway outside turn 1, you will stage at the gate outside turn 1. For those wanting to camp in the lots on the backstretch and to the Southeast of the speedway outside turn 2, you will stage in the pit area. The roads between the different areas will be closed, so make sure you are staged in the staging area for where you want to camp. This is only for the opening of camping on August 3rd. To see a map explaining the staging click HERE\n\nOn Saturday August 3rd, No ATVs, UTV’s, Golf Carts, Motorcycles, or similar vehicles may be used for marking camping sites.\n\nIn an attempt to control some of the problems we have had in past years with running out of room in the camping areas, we are implementing the following rule. Beginning Thursday August 8th at 12 PM, all marked off campsites must be occupied by some sort of camper. From that point, any empty sites will be opened up for anyone to use. Also, those who mark off excessive areas and do not use all of the space they mark, may be asked to reduce their area. The goal of this new rule is not to force people into smaller areas, or prevent people from saving spots for friends. The camping areas are one of our biggest logistical problems every year at the event, and many times, people take up way too much room, or mark off spots that never get used. This leads to us having to designate more and more areas off for camping. With us only having so much space for camping and car parking, something needs to be done to alleviate the problem. With this new rule, we realize that there will be situations that arise that we cannot foresee. We will be taking each situation on a case by case basis and may need to make changes as we go. We ask for everyone’s cooperation in this. Please remember, camping is free. For that to continue, everyone needs to be considerate in the space they use.\n\nVendors: Please contact us at jking@florencespeedway.com to reserve a vending spot. Due to sponsor commitments, vending space will be limited. Those showing up without reservations will be turned away.\n\nTimes: (Note: All times are approximate and may be adjusted due to weather, attendance, or management’s discretion.)\n\nThursday\n\nPit Gate Opens: 3:00 pm\n\nMain and Back Gates: 6:00 pm\n\nHot Laps Start: 7:00 pm\n\nRacing Starts: 8:00 pm\n\nFriday\n\nPit Gate Opens: 3:00 pm\n\nMain and Back Gates: 6:00 pm\n\nHot Laps Start: 7:00 pm\n\nRacing Starts: 8:00 pm\n\nSaturday\n\nPit Gate Opens: 3:00 pm\n\nMain and Back Gates: 3:00 pm\n\nHot Laps Start: 7:00 pm\n\nRacing Starts: 7:30 pm\n\nAdmission Prices: (Note: Three day passes are a combination of the corresponding Thursday, Friday, and Saturday ticket.
