        "text": "In March 2023 it was confirmed that Rolls-Royce Submarines would provide all the nuclear reactor plants that will power new attack submarines as part of the tri-lateral agreement between Australia, the UK and US.\n\nThis increase in demand will see new manufacturing and office facilities being built on recently acquired land surrounding the existing Raynesway site. It will also create 1,170 skilled roles within Rolls-Royce across a range of disciplines, including manufacturing and engineering.\n\nRolls-Royce Submarines President Steve Carlier said:\n\n“This is a truly exciting time for our business, with work secured that will see us support UK and Australian submarines well into the second half of this century. It will see thousands of jobs created across the UK supply chain, many of which here in Derby, and we’re proud to be playing our part in this international endeavour.\n\nFor over 60 years we have provided the power to the Royal Navy’s nuclear submarines and our expansion plans are the first step in helping Australia acquire their own nuclear propulsion attack submarine capability, while showcasing British innovation and expertise on the world stage.”\n\nMinister for Defence Procurement, James Cartlidge, said:\n\n“This is a crucial investment and a significant next step in ensuring we have the capacity, skills and nuclear expertise to support the UK’s current and future submarine programmes, including the next-generation nuclear-powered submarines for the UK and Australia through our AUKUS partnership.\n\nSupporting hundreds of high-skilled jobs in Derby, this investment demonstrates this Government’s unwavering commitment to the defence nuclear enterprise and growing the UK economy.”"
