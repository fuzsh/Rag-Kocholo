        "text": "The SEND reforms set out the responsibilities placed on providers of services for those under the aged of 25, as part of the Children and Families Act 2014. These reforms require the local area to provide a strategy for children and young people who have or may have SEND to improve access to education, health and social settings, so those with SEND have the same opportunities as other children and young people.\n\nThe local area must provide information about what is available in their area and how to access this. This can be found for our local areas at:\n\nDerby city: Derby's SEND Local Offer - Derby City Council\n\nDerbyshire: Local Offer directory (derbyshire.gov.uk).\n\nOther responsibilities are to identify needs for children at the earliest opportunity and support them. This is referred to as the Graduated Response. This can involve services from education, health and social care working together. All our services are open to children as part of the Graduated Response as they are based on clinical needs of the child/young person. This working together may involve sharing care plans/letters, and/or meetings including the family and if appropriate the child/young person.\n\nHealth services have a statutory responsibility to inform the local authority if we think a child under the age of five has, or may have a SEND. This is done by the childâ€™s Health Visitor or Paediatrician, we will normally discuss this with you first.\n\nSome children who have a range of needs and service use may go on to have a formal assessment and plan written called an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP). This is led by the council, however health services will contribute to the initial assessment if the child/young person is open to the service. This is a formal plan which identifies all their needs, and how services across education, health and social care will work together to meet the agreed outcomes. Further information can be found on the local offer pages mentioned above.\n\nIf a child/young person is issued with an EHCP this will be reviewed at least every 12 months. Health services will contribute to this by:\n\ninforming local authority the child has sufficient progress and they no longer require the service and have been discharged\n\nwriting a report about the progress in the period since the last review and the next target\n\nor attending a meeting.\n\nIf you have any concerns about the SEND processes for your child/young person there is an independent support service in each area to provide further information and support.\n\nDerby City: Derby SEND | Information & Advice Support Service (SENDIASS) (derbysendiass.org.uk)"
