        "text": "What Derby's famous for...\n\nPeak position\n\nThe UK's most central city is just a short drive from the Peak District and Alton Towers.\n\nDerby nightlife, according to students\n\nThe nightlife depends on your preferences. If you like clubs, Mosh, Moomoos, and Pop World are the main ones. If you fancy a quieter, less ‘club scene’ drink, there are so many bars on the outskirts of the city centre, like on Friar Gate. (University of Derby student)\n\nFactories\n\nThe Derby Silk Mill became Britain's first factory in 1721.\n\nDerby nightlife, according to students\n\nThere isn’t a hugely great nightlife if you’re really into clubbing (but Notts is only a bus ride away). Derby is better known for the pub scene. They’re friendly and cosy enough, so it makes up for it! I rate the Spoons a lot. (Third year student, University of Derby)\n\nBeer\n\nCamra – Campaign for Real Ale – has voted Derby as the best city for real ale.\n\nStudent life in Derby\n\nLocal gems, tips, and things to do, as recommended by students.\n\nTreat yourself\n\nIntu Derby is the best place to go shopping! It has pretty much any shop you need, including bowling, mini-golf, and the cinema. (University of Derby student)\n\nLow on cash\n\nDerby Museum is free, and Derby Theatre has £5 tickets on Fridays! (Third year student, University of Derby)\n\nWhen family visit\n\nChatsworth is ideal for a family day out: beautiful parkland, posh house, fab farm, and lovely gardens. As long as your parents are paying! (Third year student, University of Derby)\n\nFeeling cultural\n\nThe Quad is a creative hub that shows independent films at its cinema and has free art exhibitions. (Third year student, University of Derby)\n\nGrab a bite\n\nAnnie's Burger Shack is, hands down, the best place to go for a special occasion. Every burger can be made meaty, veggie or vegan, and they can even cater for coeliacs. (Third year student, University of Derby)\n\nFriday feeling\n\nBustler Food Market is an amazing place. Only open on select Friday and Saturday nights, it's worth paying a visit to sample amazing street food. (Third year student, University of Derby)\n\nSunday chilling\n\nDerby has lovely parks: Markeaton Park, Darley Park, and Allestree Park are all great for a gentle stroll. You can hike for miles in the Peak District.

From bakers to booksellers, the market hall has a little bit of everything.\n\nLiving in Derby, according to students\n\nChose to live in the city centre [to be] closer to the shops and city life, but still able to grab the bus up to uni. I did pay a premium because of my flat's location but it has been worth it. [The] downside of living in the town centre is that it is somewhat far away from the 'student' areas, such as [the] New Zealand area and Cowley Street, which can make seeing friends in those areas harder. (Third year student, University of Derby)\n\nThe QUAD\n\nHere's your go-to for everything contemporary art and film in Derby, with exhibitions and events running throughout the year.\n\nDarley Park\n\nTake a peaceful stroll through Derby's favourite park, located on the River Derwent.\n\nLiving in Derby, according to students\n\nNew Zealand – I live in my current house because it was down the road from my original halls (in St. Christopher's Court). This area is in the middle for me: town is a ten to 15 minute walk down the road, uni is about the same, My other [university] site is near it too. Perfect for a joint honours student going to different campuses. (Second year student, University of Derby)\n\nDerby Cathedral\n\nDerby Cathedral has events, including the Museum of the Moon to mark the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. The replica of the Moon was inside the Cathedral for a couple of days, before continuing its tour around the world.
