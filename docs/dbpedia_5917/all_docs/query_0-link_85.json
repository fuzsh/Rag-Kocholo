        "text": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (KTUU) - Saturday was meant to be the 4th Annual Coho Rodeo, a one-day event that normally fills the banks of Ship Creek with hundreds of anglers.\n\nBut a scarcity of cohos has pushed the event back at least two weeks.\n\nDustin Slinker, the owner of the Bait Shack and rodeo organizer, said the silver salmon haven’t arrived at Ship Creek and other locations across Southcentral and Southeast Alaska.\n\n“I hope they’re just a little bit late but the silvers and cohos have not arrived down here in Ship Creek,” Slinker said.\n\nSlinker said the end of July and the beginning of August is typically the peak of the coho season. He said he hopes the run is building slower this year. The Rodeo’s delay has impacted business owners, anglers, tourists and Alaskans trying to fill their freezers, he said.\n\nThe limit for cohos in Ship Creek is three per person per day, three in possession. Slinker said people can fish all day and get only one or two fish. Slinker said he can normally sense when the fish are running when anglers start to hit their limits and schools of salmon fill the creek.\n\n“Our schools have been 12 to 30 fish when it should really be two to three times that size and multiple schools of those spread out throughout the creek,” Slinker said. “So just looking in there, they’re not there.”\n\nAlso alarming to the shop owner are the low pink salmon numbers and the fact that some commercial fisheries have already been executed in the Northern Cook Inlet with open nets. Slinker said he believes that’s not sustainable with the amount of fish in the water.\n\nAndy Couch, the owner of Fish Tail River Guides, and a writer of a weekly fishing column for the Frontiersman, agreed with Slinker and said the amount of nets used by commercial fisheries is impacting the Coho salmon population.\n\n“Northern Cook Inlet and the Mat-Su Valley, over the last five years we’ve seen a dramatic decline in the Coho salmon fisheries and I believe that is tied partially to increasing opportunities to harvest them commercially in the Northern Cook Inlet,” Couch said.\n\nCouch said the decline can also be seen in escapements, harvest yield and harvest for sport fisheries.\n\n“It seems like every year we get fewer and fewer fish,” Slinker said. “The fishing is getting more challenging.”\n\nSlinker said he hopes more fish start coming down the creek in larger schools.\n\nAug. 10 is the new date for the coho derby, which would go from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Slinker said that could also be canceled if coho levels remain low."
