The city of Bidar, the northernmost district of Karnataka, was the capital of the Bahani Sultanate in the 15th century. After the fall of the Bahmanis, it became the seat of the Barid Shahi sultanate, one of the five successor states of the Bahmani Sultanate. The pictures below are of Bahmani and Barid Shahi period monuments (15th and 16th century) taken of a Samsung Galaxy A31 phone during a visit in March 2023.
