        "text": "WITH THE QUICK change of events, fortunes and figureheads guiding the Bahmani Sultanate, we may have overlooked the shift of capital. While Gulbarga was the preferred capital at the start, by the close Bidar enjoys that favour. Bidar is not very far from Gulbarga, and lies just over 100 km to its north.\n\nAt the height of its imperial prestige, Bidar was described as ‘the most splendid cities of India’. The 15th Century Russian visitor Athanasius Nikitin describes it being a well-tilled land with many fields; a refined city that that enjoyed pleasant weather. Much later in the 17th Century, the French traveller Thevenot describes the Persian governor of Bidar being carried in an oxen-drawn palanquin draped in silk serge onbamboo poles plated with chamfered silver. The edifice of a university set up by the admired Prime Minister Mahmud Gawan (whose unfortunate fate concludes the previous post), is described by a later visitor as ‘the finest of its kind surviving in India’.\n\nThis is a city that in later years will come to be known for its signature style of metalware known as bidri. The city’s has pedigree too, one that is the stuff of epics. Legend holds that Bidar is the site of Vidarbha – the furthest southern kingdom mentioned in the Mahabharatha. Incidentally, Damayanti, the princess of the Vidarbha kingdom was married to Nala, who it is said excelled in the art of cooking. He is believed to have authored a booked on the subject which survives to this day; his book, Pakadparna, details the preparation of a spectrum of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, as well as drinks. While the preferred oil base in these recipes is sesame oil, a preferred cooking oil of the South today; most recipes in this treatise call for the use of kasturi, a type of turmeric native to the Himalayas and not the South.\n\nAs the seat of a more than a few Bahmani rulers, Bidri no doubt witnessed the invention of many original imperial dishes. These creations would have trickled their way to streets and homes in some form. A later example of Bidri culinary heritage that travelled to Hyderabad, is the famous Kalyani biryani. This distinctive buffalo meat-based dish is the inheritance of the Kalyani Nawabs of Bidar, who, back in the 18th Century, began a tradition of serving this biryani to anyone coming over from Bidri who happened to drop into their haveli. The haveli itself has not survived, but the recipe has, by virtue of the haveli’s cooks who branched out to run their own catering establishments.\n\nThe romance of the passing glory of the Bahmanis is best captured by this inscription on the mausoleum of the Sultan who shifted the Bahmani capital to Bidar:\n\n”Should my heart ache, my remedy is this. A cup of wine and then I sup of bliss.”\n\nREFERENCES\n\nA Social History of the Deccan 1300-1761, by Richard M Eaton\n\nHistory of Kr̥ṣiśāstra: A History of Indian Literature by Gyula Wojtilla\n\nAKBAR MAY BE MAKING POLITE overtures to the Deccan Sultanate, but previous Delhi-based powers had the region in their grasp. Centuries before, Turkish-origin Alauddin Khilji, the most powerful leader of the Delhi Sultanate, had conquered prominent Southern kingdoms: Devagiri under the Yadavas, the Kakatiya’s Warangal, and Madurai under the Pandyas. This was not surprising; this was a man who made no bones about his ambitions: he had coins minted with him being described as the second Alexander. However’s Khilji’s objective was largely to extract tributes to sustain his armies and the Delhi Sultanate; settling in the Deccan as a sovereign presence was out of the question. Devagiri, Hill of the Gods, was famed for its wealth. A shrewd strategist, Alauddin Khilji saw to it that Devagiri would capitulate to the demands of the Delhi Sultanate. To head this Deccan project, he deputed the redoubtable commander, Malik Kafur. In Devagiri, Khilji would have to negotiate with Devagiri’s ruling Seuna Yadavas under Ramachandra. On Khilji’s very first attempt on Devagiri, Ramachandra was force to cave in to Khilji’s demands. This would become a pattern at any future refusal of tribute payment. But appeasement was two-way. Ramachandra would be summoned to Delhi on one occasion to be conferred the title Rai Rayan. He was also given a region of Gujarat. Ramchandra reciprocated by giving his daughter Jatyapali, in marriage to Khilji. This was a critical alliance that paved the way for Khilji to make further inroads into the Deccan. Alauddin’s turn in the South was a hard act to follow. His successors would not match and a recalcitrant Devagiri would shake off the yoke at every opportunity. Devagiri, also called Daulatabad, would be the same city to which, decades later, the ill-starred Tughlaq, would shift the entire population of Delhi, before moving back. If Tughlaq’s own generals needed a convincing reason to abandon ship, nothing could be clearer than this. Sure enough, in a few years of Tughlaq and the population shifting out of Daulatabad, Zafar Khan, a general under Tughlaq declares automony from the Delhi Sultanate, and establishes what would be referred to as the Bahmani Sultanate. As South India’s first independent Sultanate, the Bahmanis shake off years of menace from Northern forces. Raised in Delhi, Hasan Gangu could not be a more suitable figure for the role: he is homegrown and has worked his way through the ranks. He has taken on the name of the brahmin mentor of his childhood and adolescence – Gangu, who foresaw greatness in the future of the one-time slave. In honour of his mentor, Hasan Gangu names the new Sultanate, Bahmani.\n\nReferences:\n\nStudies in Mughal History, Ashvini Agrawal\n\nWikipedia"
