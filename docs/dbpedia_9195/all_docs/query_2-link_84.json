        "text": "In the history of India, the decision taken by Muhammad Bin Tughluk for shifting his capital from Delhi to Daulatabad is often seen as a crazy decision by historians. But everyone would agree to the fact that eventually this decision was turned to be a boon for Deccan as it became a hot seat for introducing new ideas, Sufism and many more.\n\nOne of the earliest dynasties that ruled Deccan aftermath the shifting of capital was the Bahamanis, who had their ancestral roots in Iran. The Sultans had invited a large number of Sufi saints, writers, calligraphers, merchants, artisans and soldiers from Iran to serve in their courts.\n\nBidar in northeast Karnataka was one of the best Deccani courts in the 15th-16th centuries AD under the Bahamanis and Baridshahis. The city’s Islamic monuments show a great degree of fusion of Deccani and Persian styles. One of the interesting features of this cross-cultural fertilization is colourful tile work, which once adorned heavily on the walls of Bidar monuments.\n\nThe use of tiles on walls and floors was common in Iran before Hellenistic times and had revived by Sassanids. In Islamic buildings the first occurrence of tile work was in Abbasid time and was wide spread from the 13th century onwards. A major innovation happened in Iran with relation to tile decoration – mosaic tiles that could be cut into small pieces and reassembled into rich and complex designs.\n\nTajaddin Firuz (1397 – 1422 AD) was a celebrated Bahamani ruler. During his rule, there was an influx of Persians, Arabs and Turks into the Deccan. The trend continued after Bidar became the Bahamani capital.\n\nThe Tomb of Ala ud Din Shah (the second Bahamani ruler of Bidar) is known for its exclusive tile work though most of it has suffered much wear after the climatic condition. The designs comprise of floral scrolls, geometric patterns and calligraphic motifs. The principal colours represented are blue, green and yellow on a white background.\n\nThe Tomb of Ali Barid Shah also contains beautiful tile work of Persian inscriptions and floral designs. Some of calligraphic work shows lines by the 12th century Persian poet Sheikh Fariduddin Attar. A pioneer of mystic poetry, his ‘Parliament of Birds’ is considered a global classic. He is said to have influenced the life and work of other major mystic poets, like Rumi, Omar Kahayam and Jami.\n\nPoets and scholars who served the court of Ali Barid Shah had brought Fariduddin’s poetry and had popularized in Bidar.\n\nThe next important building covered with mosaic tiles is the madrassa of Mahmud Gawan, which was founded in 1472 AD. It was one of the greatest centres of learning in Medieval Deccan.\n\nRangeen Mahal inside Bidar Fort is considered a jewel of Deccan. Its walls once had entirely carved with tile work, but now only has survived around the black basalt arched doorway leading to the royal chamber.\n\nThe colours are mainly blue and white along with the inclusion of mustard yellow and grass green. The design includes floral arabesque pattern.\n\nToday most of these tile works have disappeared, but whatever is left offers a pleasing sight. Come, lets discover the beautiful tile work of Medieval Bidar in Karnataka and take every step to preserve them for posterity.\n\nMurals or frescoes have been valuable creations of humankind world over for thousands of years. India though has long roots of mural tradition tracing as far as to the Upper Paleolithic era, it was Ajanta in the 5th century AD, where the classical tradition began. In the 16th century, a new chapter in Indian murals evolved with ideas merging from Indian mythologies and Persian styles. Soon Rajasthan and Bundelkhand became hotspots of mural art.\n\nIn art history literature, we encounter a number of reference on Rajput paintings, but very little on Sauarshtra style. Recently we had come across some rare evidences of 18th century murals at Sayla Darwargadh (palace) which are almost at the vanishing stage.\n\nSayla is a small town located on the highway running from Ahmedabad to Rajkot. It was a princely state in the pre-independence era ruled by a clan of Jhala Rajputs. It covered a total area of 575 sq km.\n\nThe state was founded in 1751 AD by Seshmalji, who captured Sayla from Kathi Darwars and made it the capital of his state. He also built a fort around the capital and founded the Sayla Darwargadh or Rajmahal. The palace has halls for audiences, administrative and judicial meetings, but more than these lies a ruined three storied Rang Mahal containing traces of 18th century murals in Saurashtra style.\n\nMost of these paintings are gone, but a careful observation can still provide interesting insights, such as about the style, religious affinity, colours used, depiction of natural world, and so on. This is the first time report of these murals.\n\nThey differ significantly from other contemporary style and demonstrate a lot of local characters and flavour. Krishna and rasa dominates but there are also worshipping scenes of Shiva lingams. Heavy use of gold colour and stylized trees are the hallmarks of Sayla murals. The other prominent colour is indigo blue.\n\nOne remarkable scene is vastraharan by Krishna of gopis, a scene widely portrayed across India in different styles. Krishna seating on a horse pulling chariot is yet another survived painting.\n\nThe Jhala clan had come from Sindh and established their reign at Patdi in 12th century AD. After the Islamic invasion, they moved their capital to Halvad and made it their capital. Over the centuries, the Jhalas established several princely states, such as Wankaner, Limdi, Wadhwan, Sayla and Chuda.\n\nThe murals of Sayla are important as not much is known about the mural tradition of this region of India. Whatever if left requires urgent attention for preservation.\n\nAbout 5000 years before, the region of Indian Subcontinent entered through the 1st step of civilization that simultaneously occurred in Egypt, Sumer and China. The human society became complex with rapid rise of urbanism. Status became an important factor to segregate people from one class to another. A specialized craft made out of various semiprecious stones such as agate, carnelian evolved to meet the need of Indus Valley aristocrats.\n\nIndus Valley Civilization died out around 1700 BC, but the craft did not. It has survived till now at Khambhat, a sea side town with rich heritage and history on the coast of Gulf of Khambhat in Gujarat.\n\nAfter the declining of Indus Valley Civilisation, bead making was practiced throughout the Subcontinent, especially in areas having closer access to raw material. But with the ravage of time the craft declined everywhere except Khambhat.\n\nGujarat which was the southernmost province of Indus Valley Civilisation has considerable deposit of agate, which upon heating produce red-orange carnelian. These are mined by local people and then brought to Khmabhat through mediators. At Khambhat, first these are dried in the sun to remove the moisture that is trapped. The selected stone nodules are laid out on roof tops or enclosed courtyards where these can be easily monitored.\n\nThe next stage is heating. When the nodules are well dried, they are baked in terracotta vessels or simple pit kilns.\n\nThe third step is chipping. A pointed iron stake is stuck in the ground and the nodule is chipped by resting it against the point and striking it with a hammer made of hard wood or buffalo horn. There is every possibility that tradition is a continuation of Indus Valley time, except the iron stuck – in Harappan time a copper stuck may have been used.\n\nPolishing or grinding is the next major step. Today, especially power energy wheels are used, but in the past the bead rough out used to be grinded and shaped on a hard sandstone.\n\nMr Anawar Hussain Shaikh is an award winning bead maker based out in Khambhat. We had recently interviewed him on various aspects related to Khambhat beads. He also demonstrated the process of chipping and polishing. His assistant Pratap Bhai is an expert driller. He also demonstrated his skill and shared his version of Khambhat bead making.\n\nCome, let’s discover the legacy of India’s oldest known craft, the bead making of Khambhat.\n\nIn the annals of Indian history, 16th century was a turning point. It was the era of bridging two cultures into a fusion, the culture of Mughals and Rajputs.\n\nRajputs, known for their bravery had several small states spread over the modern day Rajasthan and parts of Madhya Pradesh. But most of them were in conflict with each other and not willing to surrender to the mighty Mughals, an imperial power based out of Agra, under the dynamic leadership of Emperor Akbar.\n\nThe King of Amer, Raja Man Singh I however had different approach. Instead fighting with other Rajputs he went on for a tie with Akbar and became his trusty general. He also became one of the nava ratnas (9 gems) in Akbar’s darwar.\n\nBefore Man Singh I, it was Raja Bharmer who is known for marrying his daughter, Jodha Bai (also called Harka Bai) to the Mughal Emperor Akbar in 1562. His brother Purnamer was first to realize that Mughals were trustworthy. He offered services of Rajputs to Mughals.\n\nThe political and matrimonial ties turned out to be as marriage of ideas, which eventually would contribute immensely towards making of cultural India. Hindu culture was protected then on, not only in Amer or in Rajasthan but as far as Odisha. Raja Man Singh was a follower Lord Krishna and is known to have contributed immensely for popularization of Krishna cult in Amer.\n\nAmer Fort is today one of India’s best known forts displaying the fusion of Mughal-Rajput architecture in the finest form. It is also listed as a world heritage site.\n\nCome lets discover how amazing the Amer Fort is.\n\nIndia has one of the greatest traditions of paintings on walls. Called murals or frescos, we see a high level of technical excellence, grace and sublime beauty among Indian murals right from the time of Ajanta.\n\nIn 1335 AD, the remarkable city of Vijayanagar or the ‘city of victory’ was established in south-central Karnataka. In no time, the city and the empire became a fertile ground for creativity, thanks to the patronage of its powerful King Krishnadeva Rai. A remarkable style of painting evolved with ideas merging from Deccan, Cholas of Tamil Nadu and Jain tradition. When the Vijayanagar Empire collapsed after the battle of Talikota in mid-16th century many of state artists moved to Serirangapatna, a pristine and sacred land surrounded by Cauvery River on all sides. Here they thrived under the royal patronage of the Mysuru Wodeyers. In 1761 AD, the island became the seat of power of Haider Ali Saheb. He and his son Tipu Sulatan established Mysuru as a vibrant Sultanate and continued to patronage the artisan of Vijayanagar ancestry.\n\nDaria Daulat Bagh is a palace situated in the island near the village Ganjam at Seringapatna. The village is set amidst beautiful gardens. It was built by Tipu Sultan in 1784 as his summer palace.\n\nBuilt entirely out of teakwood, the architecture of the palace shows remarkable fusion of Deccani, Persian and Rajput styles. The most stunning feature of the palace is that all the space available on the walls, pillars, jharokas and arches have colourful fresco work in the style of Vijayanagar-Mysuru paintings.\n\nOn the western wall right to the entrance is depicted the battle scene of second Anglo-Mysore war or the battle of Pollilur. The battle had been fought between Haider-Tipu and the British forces, in which Haider and Tipu combated splendidly and won.\n\nThe paintings executed by the artists at the instance of Tipu Sultan where primary aim was to glorify their victory over the British. Colonel Bailley, the defeated British officer was taken to Serirangapatna after his defeat. The battle mural is seen in four different panels portraying Tipu and Haider marching in procession towards Pollilur near Kanchipuram. Tipu is depicted in all finery, himself leading the army towards Pollilur riding a beautiful white horse. Baillie sits in a palanquin as he is wounded and biting his pointing figure – a gesture employed by many to signify defeat in dismay.\n\nThe climax of the battle scene depict Baillie’s defeat giving special prominence to the explosion of tumbril and to the consternation of the British square colonel.\n\nOn the eastern part of the building there are a number of small frames containing figural motifs, architecture in brilliant composition. The most special is the one where the queen is seen seated on a carpet smoking a hookah. Some of the layouts strongly resemble Rajasthani miniature. The other panels illustrate incidents in the lives of princes, rulers and grandees of Tipu’s contemporary and also includes several rajas defeated by him. There are also neighbouring nawabs and kings including the Hindu Rani of Chittore, Rajas of Tanjore, Benaras, and Balajirao Peshwa II.\n\nCome, lets discover the murals of Daria Daulat Bagh and appreciate the legacy of Tipu Sulatan, a brave son of the soil and perhaps one of the earliest freedom fighters."
