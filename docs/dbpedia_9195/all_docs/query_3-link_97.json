        "text": "BAHAMANI KINGDOM\n\n18th December, 2023 History\n\nDisclaimer: Copyright infringement not intended.\n\nContext\n\nThe Karnataka High Court directed the Kalaburagi district authorities to remove encroachments from the historical fort of Bahmani Sultans in the city.\n\nDetails\n\nThe Bahmani Sultanate, also known as the Bahmanid Empire, was a significant medieval Muslim state in the Deccan region of South India.\n\nIt was established by Ala-ud-Din Hasan Bahman Shah in 1347 and lasted until 1527 when it fragmented into five smaller states.\n\nFoundation and Expansion\n\nEstablishment by Hasan Bahman Shah: The Bahmani Sultanate was founded by Hasan Bahman Shah, a governor appointed by the Delhi Sultanate. He declared independence and established his capital at Gulbarga.\n\nTerritorial Expansion: Under subsequent rulers, especially during the reigns of Muhammad Shah I and Firuz Shah, the Bahmani Sultanate expanded its territories across the Deccan region, encompassing areas such as Gulbarga, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda (modern-day Hyderabad).\n\nAdministration and Governance\n\nFeudal System: The Sultanate was administratively divided into four provinces (Daulatabad, Bidar, Berar, and Gulbarga) with tarafdars or subedars governing each. The sultanate was governed through a decentralized feudal system. Provinces were ruled by governors known as walis or nayaks, who held considerable power in their respective regions.\n\nCentral Administration: The sultanate had a centralized administrative structure with key departments handling revenue, justice, and military affairs.\n\nCultural and Socio-Economic Development\n\nPatronage of Arts and Culture: The Bahmani rulers were patrons of art, literature, and architecture. They encouraged the development of Deccani culture, which was a blend of Persian and Indian influences. Notable structures include Gulbarga's Jama Masjid, Bidar's Rangeen Mahal, and Bijapur's Gol Gumbaz. Urdu, Persian, and Arabic literature flourished during this period.\n\nPromotion of Regional Languages: The Bahmani court supported the use of local languages like Dakhni (early form of Urdu) and Kannada, contributing to their literary growth.\n\nEconomic Prosperity: Trade and commerce flourished in the Bahmani Sultanate due to its strategic location. The region was a center for international trade, particularly in horses, textiles, and spices.\n\nReligious Policies\n\nReligious Tolerance: The sultans followed a policy of religious tolerance, allowing diverse religious communities like Hindus, Muslims, Jains, and Christians to coexist peacefully.\n\nPromotion of Syncretic Culture: The sultanate's cultural milieu was marked by the syncretic blending of different religious traditions and practices.\n\nDecline and Fragmentation\n\nInternal Strife and Dynastic Conflicts: As the Bahmani Sultanate expanded, internal conflicts and power struggles among the nobility weakened its unity.\n\nRise of Five Successor States: In 1527, the sultanate disintegrated into five smaller states known as the Deccan Sultanates: Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, Golconda, Berar, and Bidar, each ruled by independent rulers.\n\nRulers\n\nFounding Ruler:\n\nAla-ud-Din Hasan Bahman Shah (1347-1358):\n\nFounder of the Bahmani Sultanate after declaring independence from the Delhi Sultanate.\n\nEstablished Gulbarga as the capital and began the Sultanate's expansion in the Deccan region.\n\nEarly Rulers:\n\nMuhammad Shah I (1358-1375):\n\nConsolidated power and expanded Bahmani territories.\n\nShifted the capital to Bidar.\n\nPromoted art, literature, and culture.\n\nFiruz Shah (1397-1422):\n\nExtended Bahmani rule further into the Deccan and introduced administrative reforms.\n\nEncouraged trade and commerce, contributing to economic prosperity.\n\nGolden Age Rulers:\n\nAhmad Shah I (1422-1436):\n\nNotable for his patronage of art and culture, fostering a thriving cultural scene.\n\nFacilitated the development of the Dakhni language (early form of Urdu).\n\nAlauddin Ahmad Shah II (1436-1458):\n\nContinued the cultural and literary advancements initiated by his predecessors.\n\nFaced internal revolts and external threats during his reign.\n\nMahmud Gawan (1466 to 1481):\n\nSultanate witnessed its zenith.\n\nGawan's military campaigns expanded the Sultanate's territory, including the reconquest of Goa from Vijayanagar.\n\nLater Rulers:\n\nMahmud Shah I (1482-1518):\n\nRuled during a period of internal turmoil and external invasions.\n\nStruggled to maintain unity among the nobility, leading to the weakening of the Sultanate.\n\nKalim Allah (1518-1527):\n\nLast ruler of the unified Bahmani Sultanate.\n\nHis reign witnessed escalating conflicts and a fragmented administration.\n\nFragmentation and Successor States:\n\nKrishnadeva Raya of the Vijayanagar Empire's military campaigns fractured the Bahmani Sultanate into five smaller states known as the Deccan Sultanates:\n\nAhmadnagar Sultanate: Founded by Ahmad Nizam Shah I.\n\nBijapur Sultanate: Established by Yusuf Adil Shah.\n\nGolconda Sultanate: Founded by Quli Qutb Shah.\n\nBerar Sultanate: Ruled by Fathullah Imad-ul-Mulk.\n\nBidar Sultanate: Established by Amir Barid.\n\nEach of these successor states operated independently, contributing to the cultural, artistic, and political landscape of the Deccan region.\n\nBattle of Talikota (1565): The conflict between the Deccan Sultanates and the Vijayanagar Empire culminated in the catastrophic Battle of Talikota, resulting in Vijayanagar's downfall.\n\nMughal Annexation: Subsequently, the Mughal Empire, notably under Akbar and later Aurangzeb, annexed the Deccan Sultanates into their dominion, marking the end of the Bahmani legacy.\n\nThe Bahmani Sultanate, despite its fragmentation, left a lasting legacy in South India, influencing the region's culture, architecture, and language, and shaping the course of history in the Deccan\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Bahmani Sultanate played a transformative role in South India's history, establishing Islamic rule, contributing to the region's cultural richness through architecture and literature, and shaping the political landscape. Its rise, conflicts with Vijayanagar, internal strife, and ultimate fragmentation into the Deccan Sultanates remain pivotal episodes in India's historical tapestry, illustrating the complex interplay of power, culture, and regional dynamics during medieval times."
