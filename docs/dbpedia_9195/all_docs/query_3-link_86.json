        "text": "The Bahmani sultanate was an Islamic kingdom in the Deccan region rivaling the Vijayanagara empire. Read here to know more about the sultanate.\n\nDuring the rule of Muhammad bin Tughlaq, two new kingdoms arose in the south, the Vijayanagara empire in 1336 and the Bahmani Sultanate which broke from Delhi in 1347.\n\nThe Bahmani sultanate and the Vijayanagara empire were perpetually at war until the breakdown of the sultanate into five successor states.\n\nBahmani Kingdom (1347-1457)\n\nThe Bahmani Kingdom was established by Hasan Gangu or Alauddin Bahman Shah (Alauddin Hasan) in 1347 CE. He was earlier the governor of Deccan under the Tughlaqs.\n\nHe was an Afghan named Hasan who was in the service of a Brahman named Gangu, Hence the name Hasan Gangu originated.\n\nThe capital of the Bahmani sultanate was Gulbarga and they ruled over the entire northern Deccan region for more than 150 years.\n\nThe Bahmani and Vijayanagara kingdoms were engaged in Territorial contests over three regions for a number of years:\n\nThe Tungabhadra doab was the fertile region between Tungabhadra and Krishna rivers (Earlier the Western Chalukyas and Cholas fought over it, earlier. And later Yadavas and Hoysalas)\n\nThe Krishna-Godavari delta for its ports controlled foreign trade.\n\nMarathwada as the Konkan coast was fertile and the port of Goa was the source of import of horses from Iran/Iraq.\n\nIn 1367, Bukka Raya I of Vijayanagara sacked the Mudkal fortress in the Tungabhadra doab. As revenge for this, the then Bahmani sultan, Mohammad Shah-I crossed the river and marched into Vijayanagara territories for the first time.\n\nThis was the first battle in India on records where both sides used artillery.\n\nLong-drawn war with no result made them agree to a treaty to restore the old position of sharing the Tungabhadra doab.\n\nIt was agreed that since both kingdoms would remain neighbors for a long period of time, they’ll avoid cruelty in war henceforth.\n\nIn future wars, helpless and unarmed civilians were not to be slaughtered. This accord made warfare in southern India less inhumane.\n\nThe Bahmani sultanate entered into a treaty with Warangal as well.\n\nThe Bahmani boundary was fixed at Golconda and did not encroach into Warangal territories.\n\nThis treaty lasted for 50 years and stopped the advance of Vijayanagara as well.\n\nFiruz shah Bahmani (1397-1422)\n\nHe was well-read in religious sciences and wanted to make the Deccan the cultural center of India.\n\nWhen the Delhi sultanate declined, the learned people migrated to the Deccan making it the center of learning.\n\nHe inducted many Hindus into his administration.\n\nBuilt an astronomical observatory at Daulatabad.\n\nFounded Firozabad, a few kilometers south of Gulbarga.\n\nPorts of Chaul and Dabhol attracted trading ships from the Persian Gulf and Red Sea trading in horses and luxury goods came in from the Arab world.\n\nHe extended the kingdom and annexed Berar by defeating Gond Raja Narsingh Rai of Kherla.\n\nHe defeated Deva Raya I of Vijayanagara and married his daughter and received Bankapur in the doab as dowry.\n\nBut the marriage did not guarantee peace and conflict broke out over the Krishna-Godavari delta.\n\nThe switching of the alliance from Warangal to Vijayanagara shifted the balance of power in Deccan.\n\nThis time Firuz Shah was defeated by Deva Raya and he had to abdicate his throne for his brother Ahmad Shah I.\n\nAhmad Shah I Wali (1422-1436)\n\nHe was called “Wali”(saint) because of his association with the famous Sufi Gesu Daraz (of the Chisti order).\n\nHe continued the struggle for domination of the eastern seaboard of southern India (Krishna Godavari delta region).\n\nHe annexed Warangal and killed the ruler as revenge, thus eastern coast came under their control.\n\nHe shifted the capital to Bidar and campaigned towards Malwa, Gondwana, and Konkan.\n\nMohammad Shah III (1463-1482)\n\nHis administration was carried by his Prime minister, Mahmud Gawan, who was an able statesman.\n\nGawan was granted the title “Malik-ul-Tujjar ” and the Kingdom was at its peak under his able guidance.\n\nHe guided successful war campaigns against Vijaynagar and Orissa and reached inner Vijaynagar territories up to Kanchi.\n\nOverran the west coast ports-Dabhol and Goa- expanded maritime trade with Iran, Iraq, etc.\n\nGawan brought out administrative reforms to increase central control.\n\nDivided the kingdom into 8 provinces (tarafs).\n\nEach Taraf was under a Tarafdar.\n\nThe salaries and responsibilities of nobles were fixed.\n\nSalary is paid in cash or by assigning a jagir (collection of land revenue).\n\nIn every province, a tract of land was set apart for expenses the Sultan named khalisa.\n\nEfforts were made to measure land and calculate the amount of revenue to be paid by cultivators to the state.\n\nHe built the famous madrasa of Bidar.\n\nThe Nobles of the sultanate were divided into:\n\nDeccanis (old nobles)\n\nAfaqis/gharibs (new comers)\n\nMahmud Gawan was a newcomer and his opponents poisoned the mind of the young Sultan- Mahmud Gawan was executed in 1482.\n\nAfter his death, more infighting continued.\n\nMahmood Shah Bahmani II, the final legitimate monarch of the Bahmani people, succeeded his father Muhammad Shah III. The final Bahmani Sultans were puppet kings under the Barid Shahi Prime Ministers.\n\nKrishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire defeated the last remnant of Bahmani power after which the Bahmani Sultanate collapsed.\n\nAfter 1518, the sultanate broke up into five states, collectively known as Deccan sultanates:\n\nAdil Shahi of Bijapur (1490)\n\nNizamshahi of Ahmednagar (1490)\n\nImad Shahi of Berar (1490)\n\nQutb Shahi of Golconda (1518)\n\nBarid Shahi of Bidar (1528)\n\nAll these sultanates were annexed by the Mughals by 1687 after many conflicts.\n\nArt, culture, and architecture of Bahmani sultanate\n\nThe Bahmani Sultans supported the Persian language, culture, and literature and some members of the Bahmani dynasty learned Persian and contributed to its literature in that language because.\n\nMany singers and dancers were captured from the Carnatic and converted to Islam.\n\nThe craftwork from Bidar was famous for its inlay work on copper and silver, which was called Bidri.\n\nThe Deccan Sultanates later adopted the Persianate Indo-Islamic architectural style that was created during this time.\n\nMajor architectural contributions of the Bahamani sultanate include the forts in Gulbarga, Haft Gumbaz, and Jama Masjid, as well as Bidar Fort and Madrasa Mahmud Gawan in Bidar."
