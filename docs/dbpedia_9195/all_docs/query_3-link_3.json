        "text": "Bidar – the least urbanised city in Karnataka has always boasted of some magnificent architectural ruins and monuments. Although the city is the best example of Islamic architecture, it attracts a very few visitors. This actually is a good news if you are a Photography enthusiast. Bidar was a part of my 10 day trip to Karnataka in mid December 2017:\n\nBidar – Gulbarga – Bijapur – Badami – Pattadakal – Aihole – Hampi – Anegundi\n\nTourist places to visit in Bidar\n\nShri Jharni Narasimha Cave Temple\n\nBahmani Tombs\n\nChaukhandi of Hazrat Khalil Ullah\n\nPapnash Mahadev Temple\n\nGurudwara Sri Nanak Jhira Sahib\n\nBidar Fort\n\nThe Madrasa of Mahmud Gawan\n\nBarid Shahi Park\n\nChowbara Clock Tower\n\n108 Feet Statue Of Basaveshwara\n\nDay 1 in Bidar\n\nShri Jharni Narasimha Cave Temple\n\nShri Jharni Narasimha Cave Temple is 6 kms away from bus stand and a rickshaw can take you there for INR ~80. It is a cave temple associated with Lord Narasimha, an incarnation (avatar) of Hindu god Vishnu. The ancient temple is excavated in a 300 metre tunnel under the Manichoola hill range.\n\nThe temple premises has a large hot water spring/ pool for devotees to bathe in. From there, a rickshaw driver agreed to drive us to Bahmani Tombs (5 kms away from Narasimha Temple), then to Chaukhandi of Hazrat Khalil Ullah (1 km from Bahmani Tombs) and then back to our hotel (8 kms) all for INR 300 (seems expensive but we were four persons and the guy was going to be with us till evening so that was okay).\n\nBahmani Tombs\n\nFor Bahmani Tombs, you drive along the Mangalpet Road from Narasimha Temple and then take a detour to drive along the Ring Road. After another detour along the Ring Road towards Ashtur, you get to see Chaukhandi; another kilometer ahead of that and you get to see huge domes which are the Bahmani Tombs. It took us 15-20 minutes to reach there from the Narasimha temple.\n\nThe earliest and grandest among them is the Tomb of Ahmad Shah-al-Wali, the ninth king of Bahmani dynasty. Built in 1436 AD, it honours the Sultan who shifted the Bahmani capital from Gulbarga to Bidar.\n\nA guide named Sultan Khaleel Shah Bahmani claimed to be the descendent of Bahmani dynasty. He showed us couple of coins from the Bahmani era. You may contact Sultan on 09739486771, to guide you about the place and its history. You may also check his credentials on Youtube here.\n\nThere’s a tomb which is partially collapsed but gives a wonderful view of the interiors of the dome. It belongs to Humayun Shah, son of Sultan Allauddin Shah. The structure seems like a cross-section cut model of a tomb. Sultan told us that the two walls and most of the dome collapsed due to lightning.\n\nChaukhandi of Hazrat Khalil Ullah\n\nChaukhandi is basically the tomb of Hazrat Khalil Ullah. He was a spiritual advisor of Sultan Ahmad Shah. The structure showcases stucco work on walls, intricately carved pillars and beautiful arched doorways. The tomb is a two story octagon with a freestanding square domed tomb chamber within.\n\nThere are 3 graves in the main vault and several others in the premises. The outer walls of the octagonal structure are designed as panels outlined by a black carved stone. There’s also a big step well within the premises.\n\nPapnash Mahadev Temple\n\nThis temple is located in a beautiful valley and has a natural spring pond, called as “Papnash”. It is believed that Lord Ram while returning from Lanka installed a Shivalingam in this temple.\n\nThe old temple was lost and at the ruins of that, a new one was built later. Though the place is very popular and is flocked by the devotees round the year, we saw very few people and thus got to experience the serenity of the place.\n\nGuru Nanak Jhira Sahib\n\nWe reached the Gurudwara post 7 pm which proved to be the best time to visit as it was less crowded. The gurudwara is about 2 kms away from the main road/ bus stand. The Gurudwara consists of:\n\nDarbar Sahib\n\nDiwan Hall\n\nLangar Hall\n\nSukhaasan Room (Rest room for Guru Granth Sahib Ji)\n\nLikhari Room\n\nA beautiful sarovar (sacred pool) is built in front of the Gurudwara stairs. The water from Sri Nanak Jhira (natural spring) is directed to this pool for pilgrims to take holy dip.\n\nGuru Nanak Jhira Sahib Bidar History\n\nDuring his second tour to Deccan from Sultanpur (Punjab), Sri Guru Nanak Devji reached Bidar via Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. The people of Bidar requested him to bless them with sweet water as the water in Bidar was salty. Sri Guru Nanak Devji remembered God and touched the hillock with his right foot and a spring of sweet water started flowing from this place and since April 1512, it is flowing continuously till date.\n\nBidar Fort\n\nThe present-day Bidar fort was rebuilt using red laterite stone around the old fort in 1428 by Ahmed Shah Bahmani. Constructed on the edge of the plateau, Bidar fort has a haphazard rhombus-shaped layout. There are over 30 monuments inside the fort.\n\nThe major attractions inside the fort are:\n\nBidar Fort Museum\n\nRangin Mahal\n\nSolah Khamba Mosque\n\nTarkash Mahal\n\nGagan Mahal\n\nDiwan-i-Aam\n\nDiwan-i-Khas/ Takht Mahal\n\nGunpowder Room\n\nShahi Matbakh\n\nNaubat Khana\n\nBomma Gondeshwara Tank\n\nWith a 55 km long thick wall, the fort has a unique triple moat with depth of 30 feet. There are 37 bastions on the fort wall with The Munda Burj being the most prominent one.\n\nSolah Khambah Mosque derives its name from the 16 pillars erected in the middle portion of the prayer hall. Built by Qubil Sultani, the mosque is also called Zanana Masjid and is one of India’s largest mosques. Next to Solah Khambah Mosque is Tarkash Mahal, which possibly got named for having built for a Turkish wife of the king.\n\nThe Takht Mahal or Throne Palace is located in the Old fort area. Built by Ahmad Shah Wali, it is one of the grandest buildings in the fort. It reflects the strong Persian influence on Bidar’s architecture. The coronations of several Bahmani and Barid Shahi Sultans were held here.\n\nBidar Fort Visit Timings\n\nThe fort is open from 9 am to 5 pm.\n\nMadrasa of Mahmud Gawan\n\nAfter exploring the Bidar Fort, we moved to Madrasa of Khwaja Mahmud Gawan, a distinguished example of Bahmani architecture (Persian style). It was built in 1472 by Mahmud Gawan, the Bahmani dynasty’s celebrated Persian origin Prime Minister, who served Muhammad Shah III from 1458 to 1481. It functioned like a residential university and was maintained on the lines of the Madrasa of Khurasan.\n\nThis three storeyed building houses mosques, library with 3,000 books, lecture halls, professors’ quarters and students’ cubicles. The minaret was lavishly decorated with Persian style green, blue and white glazed tiles set in zigzag patterns and calligraphic text.\n\nBarid Shahi Park\n\nBarid Shahi Park is literally a complex of tombs of Barid Shahi clan. The entry fee is INR 5. The 55 acre garden houses many graves belonging to the royal line of Ali Barid Shah. The most notable among them belong to Ali Barid, Qasim Barid, Ibrahim Barid Shah and Chaand Sultana.\n\nWe had to skip Chowbara (a large clock tower situated near Mahmud Gawan Madrasa) and 108 feet statue of Basaveshwara as we had to leave for our next destination – Gulbarga.\n\nBest time to visit Bidar\n\nJuly to September (monsoon) is the most visited period. However, November to January is the best time to visit.\n\nHow to reach Bidar\n\nAir: Nearest airport is Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, Hyderabad (140 kms)\n\nTrain: Bidar has a local railway station which has good connectivity with important railway stations like Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Aurangabad, Nanded, etc.\n\nRoad: State highway, SH4 passes through Bidar, making it easily accessible from different parts of Karnataka by road. Apart from KSRTC buses, private bus operators like VRL Travels, SRS Travels, Pooja Travels, etc also provide bus services to nearby cities.\n\nAccommodation in Bidar\n\nHotel Shiva International\n\nHotel Sapna International\n\nBlackbuck Resort by Jungle Lodges\n\nRestaurants in Bidar\n\nKamat Hotel\n\nRohit Restaurant\n\nRoyal Anmol Restaurant\n\nABC Restaurant\n\nBidar Travel Tips\n\nIf you are traveling from Mumbai, DO NOT book your seats in Sleeper coach in 22143 Mumbai CSMT – Bidar SF Express. People without tickets barge into the coach and occupy your seats with no shame whatsoever. Book in AC coaches instead.\n\nMake sure you are carrying extra pair of clothes since you will have to wade through chest deep water to reach the main Jharni Narasimha temple.\n\nDo not forget to see the Ahmad Shah-al-Wali tomb from inside.\n\nYou may have your dinner at the Langar of Gurudwara as well.\n\nStart your visit for Bidar fort early. Exploring the fort will consume a lot of your time and there are many things to see inside the fort.\n\nBidar Travel Video\n\nDid you like this post?
