        "text": "The ‘Monuments of the Deccan Sultanate’ is a serial property comprising of four component constitute the most representative, most authentic and best conserved examples of Deccani Sultanate monuments in India. The series demonstrates the exemplary convergence of national and international styles of Islamic architecture and their intersections with the prevalent Hindu architecture of the period southern Indian in present day Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh,\n\nThe contributions of Deccan Sultanate to the arts and architecture of India is impressive with iconic Indo Islamic monuments constructed in Gulbarga, Bidar, Bijapur and Hyderabad. These sites emerged as important medieval fortifications and walled cities of the Deccan Sultanates with a vigorous new architectural style of the sultanate that emerged from encounters with the Deccan Hindu heartland of the period. Individually, each of the components of Deccan Sultanate cover important aspects of Sultanate history with Gulbarga evolving as the first capital of Bahmani Kingdoms in mid 14th Century CE including its impressive fortifications, Jami Masjid and royal tombs; Bidar as the next Bahmani capital in mid 15th Century CE; further evolution of the Deccani Sultanate style by Adil Shahi dynasty in the monuments at Bijapur such as the Gol Gumbaj that stands as the 2nd largest dome in world history; and the final diversification and manifestation of the style in the Qutub Shahi monuments of Golconda fort, tombs and the Charminar at Hyderabad.\n\nBahmani Monuments at Gulbarga, Karnataka 17°20’26”N, 76°49’53”E\n\nBahmani and Barid Shahi Monuments at Bidar, Karnataka 17°55’26” N, 77°31’38”E\n\nAdil Shashi Monuments at Bijapur, Karnataka 16° 49’45”N, 75°44’10”E\n\nQutb Shahi Monuments at Hyderabad Andhra Pradesh 17° 23’ 00” E, 78° 24’ 04”E\n\nBahmani Monuments at Gulbarga\n\nThe 14th century Bahmani monuments at Gulbarga in Karnataka State primarily comprise of the Gulbarga Fort and Great Mosque in the Fort and the Haft Gumbad complex with seven tombs protected by the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nGulbarga as the first capital of the Bahmani dynasty had a fort. On the northwestern side of the city’s elliptical fort is the oldest township wherein is located the Shah Bazaar Mosque, which served as the Jami Mosque of Gulbarga. The tombs, darghas, and associated water bodies served as conceptual “protective” concentric circles around the fort, enclosing both parts of the city. Constructed on the remains of a Warangal fort built by Raja Gulchand, it was a nara durg with no natural defenses, dependent on the might of its men. Completely overhauled and reconstructed later by Alauddin Bahmani, it is an engineering feat of its time, with a 50 foot-thick double wall, the inner one higher than the outer. It displays an almost impregnable defense system with a 90 foot-wide moat with drawbridges completely surrounding its three miles of fortifications. Fifteen towers and 26 canons ensured it was one of the mightiest of all forts. The colossal western entrance has four gates and four courtyards, each one so fortified that it would be impossible to pass through any unscathed. It is an excellent example of military architecture. Inside are remains of large buildings, temples, and several beautiful courtyards. The large and foreboding Bala Hissar was used as the royal residence and certainly as a last refuge.\n\nOther Monuments in Gulbarga include, the Jami Masjid mosque and the Haft Gumbaz tomb complex. The Jami Masjid built in 1367 is awe-inspiring as it covers 38,000 square feet, and is a unique congregational courtyard for the region as it is covered. The Haft Gumbaz tombs include that of Mujahid Shah, Daud Shah, Ghiyath al-Din Shah and Shams al-Din Shah of the Bahmani dynasty.\n\nBahmani and Barid Shahi Monuments at Bidar\n\nThe Bahmani and Barid Shahi monuments at Bidar dating from late 15th to the early 16thcenturies, comprise of the Bidar Fort, the Madrasa Mahmud Gawan, the Bahamani tombs at Ashtur and the Barid Shahi tombs.\n\nThe irregular, circular fort of Bidar, within which the royal palaces are located, is attached on its southern side to the quadrangular city. The six-mile long fort wall, built with huge stone blocks of reddish laterite stone is strengthened with 37 bastions, and has several gates with barbicans. Within the fort, two large mosques, the Jami Masjid and the Solha Khumba Masjid with sixteen pillars support a lofty dome, are also attributed to him. The significant achievement in Bidar is the sophisticated system of gates and sluices that could be used when required to flood segments of the moat and thus preserve water.\n\nThe Madrasa of Mahmud Gawana occupies a rectangular structure covering 68 by 60 meters and encloses a central quadrangle. The main entrance, which is no longer extant, was to the east and led to the quadrangle with a dodecagonal cistern at its middle. The 12 tombs of Bahmani rulers in Ashtur were erected from 1436 to 1535. The tomb of Ahmad Shah I has a dome is most impressive rising over 30m high. The interior of the square tombs have beautifully colored and gilded paintings on the ceilings. Ali Barid's tomb has a 25m high dome and stands in the middle of a symmetrical four square garden."
