        "text": "The Art and Architecture under Bahman Sultans:\n\nThe rulers of the Bahman kingdom were great patrons of art and architecture. They had built towering edifices which shows the skill of artisans who existed during the Bahman period.\n\nThe Bahmani architecture was highly influenced by the styles of “Persian architecture”, which was a result of patrons visiting the empire from various West Asian countries.\n\nSome of the finest examples of Bahman architecture are given below.\n\nThe Gulbarga Fort\n\nThe Fort of Gulbarga and Jama Masjid: This structure stands tall on the territories of Gulbarga, which was constructed during the reign of Mahmud Gawan.\n\nHe also built Madrasa and Fort in Bidar, which stands the test of time.\n\nThe architecture of the Bahman Sultanate had a unique feature of building tombs which they got inspired from the architecture of the Delhi Sultanate. The tombs are built in two styles namely,\n\n1. Single tomb.\n\n2. Double tomb.\n\nApart from these features, the Bahman architectures are famous for its Cloisters and Square arches.\n\nChand Minar\n\nEducation\n\nThe sultans of the Bahman kingdom had a great interest in the field of education. Alauddin Bahman Shah the founder of the empire was a great patron of education who built schools for the education of his sons.\n\nThe successive rulers have shown keen interest in education who later went on to build many resting places for students who are coming to attend the Madrasas from various places.\n\nMahmud Gawan builds a Madrasa in Bidar with a library that served as a great centre of education.\n\nThe End of Bahmani Kingdom:\n\nAfter the death of the last able ruler Mahmud Gawan, the Bahman empire had successive kings who were puppets in the hands of Nobles. The Death of Gawan also witnessed the Migration of valiant commanders and loyal entities of the kingdom to other kingdoms.\n\nThe infighting among the existing rulers sounded the death knell to the mighty Bahmani kingdom which was split into five small kingdoms and collectively they are known by the name of Deccan Sultanate.\n\nThe five kingdoms that emerged after the disintegration of the Bahman sultan are,\n\n1. Bijapur.\n\n2. Golconda.\n\n3. Ahmednagar.\n\n4. Bidar.\n\n5. Berar."
