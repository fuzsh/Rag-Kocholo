        "text": "Duration: 12 hours\n\nAll days of the week\n\nThis is a full day car excursion to the city of Bidar (3 hours drive from Hyderabad).\n\nAt first glance, Bidar looks like any other nondescript Indian town. But it is a hidden gem steeped in history and legends, replete with monuments and ruins.\n\nBidar was the capital of the Bahmani Sultanate for more than a century. When the Bahmani Sultanate distintegrated, Bidar became the seat of power for the Barid Shahi Sultanate, who ruled for 130 years. Much of the architecture in Bidar is a synthesis of Islamic styles influenced by Hindu designs and motifs. Bidar is also a major pilgrimage site for people of the Sikh faith.\n\nThis tour covers the following:\n\nBidar Fort - This fort built by the Bahmanis is one of the largest and most impressive forts in South India. Apart from its imposing battlements and deep moat, the fort has a beautiful palace (Rangeen Mahal) and a great mosque (Solah Khamba Masjid).\n\nMahmud Gawan Madrasa â This was a learning centre built in the 15th century by Mahmud Gawan, a Persian who became one of the most important personages in the Bahmani court.\n\nGurudwara Nanak Jhira Sahib - this well planned, majestic Sikh place of worship is one of the most popular destinations in South India for Sikhs from all over India. There is a sacred water tank historically associated with Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, who came to Bidar in his travels. There is also a langar (free kitchen) feeding the pilgrims.\n\nBidri workshops - You can visit a home workshop making bidriware (metal handicraft) and do some shopping if you are interested\n\nBahmani Tombs - impressive mausoleums built to house the Bahmani kings. The tombs have a doleful, romantic feel about them.\n\nIf you are interested, and if time permits, you can also visit the following:\n\nBarid Shahi tombs - these small tombs with delicate and intricate carvings are located in sprawling gardens, a breath of fresh air.\n\nChaukhandi of Hazrat Khalil Ullah - the quiet, secluded tomb of a Sufi saint from Iran.\n\nWe will pick you up and drop you at your hotel.\n\nCost:\n\nINR 3500 per person for 7-10 persons\n\nINR 5000 per person for 5-6 persons\n\nINR 5500 per person for 3-4 persons\n\nINR 7750 per person for 2 persons\n\nINR 15500 for a solo traveller\n\nIncludes:\n\nAC transport, driver with cell phone, fuel, parking charges, tolls, knowledgable guide, personalised tour and all taxes.\n\nExcludes:\n\nEntrances, meals, tips\n\nTour notes: Please ensure you have adequate sun protection. We will be visiting some religious places, so please dress conservatively. A Sikh gurudwara requires people of all genders to take off their shoes and cover their heads with a scarf or handkerchief. They will lend you something if you forget to bring one, but it is better to bring your own."
