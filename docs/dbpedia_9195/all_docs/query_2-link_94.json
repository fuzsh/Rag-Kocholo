        "text": "The Bahmani sultanate came to power in the aftermath of one of the many rebellions that broke up the Tughlak empire during the last years of the Muhammad bin Tughlak. The foreign officials of the revenue department in the province of Daulatabad (known as the Amirs of the hundred or centurions) fell under the suspicion of the sultan as they had failed to collect the enormous revenue asked by the sultan. They were sent under the escort of the governor of Daulatabad to Broach in accordance with the Sultan's wish. However news of the Sultan's brutal massacre of the centurions of the neighbouring province of Malwa reached them and fearing the same fate for themselves they revolted at the end of the first day's march, returned back to the provincial capital of Daulatabad, imprisoned the governor and proclaimed one of the Amir Ismail Mukh , the sultan of Deccan under the title of Nasir-ud-din Shah. Muhammad himself arrived in deccan to break up the revolt, defeated the rebels and imprisoned them in the citadel. Some of the Amirs however managed to escape to Gulbarga under the leadership of Hasan Gangu or Zafar Khan. After about 3 months Hasan gathered a sufficient army to strike back and marched towards Bidar. Meanwhile Muhammad was called away by another rebellion in the province of Gujarat. Taking the advantage of the situation Hasan easily defeated the imperial army after killing their commander. The royal troops garrisoned in the citadel of Daulatabad gave up the siege without fight and retreated to Malwa. Ismail Mulkh was freed from the prison although Ismail Mulkh abdicated the throne in favor of Hasan who proclaimed himself ruler of Deccan under the name Sultan Abu'l Muzaffar Ala-ud-din Bahman Shah.\n\nAs for the genealogical descent of Bahmani Sultans, as usually various stories came into circulation in the aftermath. And various historian over time favor one story over another. According to Firishta who wrote the Islamic history of India at the end of 16th century - Hasan was a slave of the Brahman of Delhi named Gangu. Once Hasan while tilling the field, discovered a pot full of the Gold coins, which he gave to his master. The Brahman, impressed by his honesty, brought this incident to the notice of the Sultan, who was also impressed by the honesty of Hasan and appointed him to the command of 100 horses. The Brahman, who was an astrologer, predicted the great future for him and made him promise that if he ever became a king, he would assume the title Gangu.\n\nHowever Tabatata and Nizam-ud-din, both of whom wrote earlier than Firishta, didn't mention this episode at all and gave credit to the story that Hasan was descended from the hero Bahman, son of Isfandiyar and therefore the Dynasty is called Bahmani. Nizam-ud-din and another historian Yahya calls the King Hasan Kanku (instead of Gangu). Some historians have attempted to explain that Kanku was actually the scribal corruption of Kaikaus and hence the connection with Kakuyid dyansty. ( I am not sure about the exact details of this story).\n\nFirishta however dismissed the story. He claimed that he had seen the pedigree of Bahmani sultans derived from the Bahman in the royal library of Ahmadnagar. According to him it was probably framed only after his ascent to the throne by flatterers and poets as the origin of Hasan was too obscure to admit of being traced. And he actually assumed the title Bahmani as a respect to his Brahmin master Gangu Brahman. (It was very much possible that he intentionally took the title Bahman as it served the dual purpose - paying his respect to his Brahmin master and at the same time connecting himself with the Persian hero - Bahman). There is a street called Baihmanipura in Gulbarga, hwere majority of the residents are Brahmans and some of them claim their descent from Gangu. As such Firishta's story although seems absurd can not be dismissed completely when compared with another equally fanciful story which claimed descent from mythical Persian hero. All we can say with certainty is that Hasan was born in humble life and elevated himself to the position of Sultan by his own merit.\n\nThe Persian culture in Bahmani court is mostly due to the presence of Persian nobles in the Bahmani court, who migrated from Persia in the search of the jobs. (One of them Mahmud Gawan is considered one of the best statesman in India history, who unfortunately lost his life to the court intrigues) Although the presence of the powerful Persian nobles created two fraction in the Bahmani court (Native Deccani Muslims vs Persian Muslims), both of whom considered each other inferior and constantly tried to exterminate the opposite fraction. The rivalry between two fractions ultimately led to the downfall of the sultanate."
