It was the first autonomous Muslim state in the Deccan and was well-known for its ongoing conflicts with Vijayanagara, a competitor that would live longer than the Sultanate. Following the triumph of the uprising against Muhammad-Bin-Tughlaq in 1327 A.D., the Bahmani Kingdom began to expand. Hasan Gangu Bahmani established the Bahmani Sultanate.\n\nThe Bahmani Empire is one of the major medieval Indian kingdoms and an important part of the history of Medieval India. The article here covers the history of the Bahmani Kingdom in detail, including the list of rulers, their administration, art and architecture.

The Bahmani Empire’s capital was Gulbarga, which is now in Karnataka. The Vijayanagar Rulers were the Bahmani Dynasty’s principal adversaries, and the conflict stemmed from Krishna Tungabhadra Doab (Raichur doab).\n\nHasan Gangu Bahmani frequently fought with the Warangal state, Rajahmundry, and Kondavidu reddy kingdoms. He succeeded in all these missions, earning him the moniker Second Alexander.\n\nMohammed, I succeeded Bahman Shah. His raid on Warangal in 1363 netted him a hefty reward, including control of the prized turquoise throne and the significant citadel of Golkonda, which afterwards passed to the Bahmani rulers.\n\nThe Orissan kings halted their advance further east after Warangal was conquered in 1425.\n\nAhmed Shah al-Wali changed the capital city from Gulbarga to Bidar in 1429.\n\nBahmani Kingdom: Key Facts\n\nAla-ud-Din Bahman Shah, or Hasan Gangu, founded the Bahmani Kingdom in 1347. Later, it broke up into five successor states, the Deccan Sultanates.\n\nKarnataka, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh joined the Bahmani Kingdom.\n\nInitially established as the capital of the Bahmani Kingdom, Gulbarga was eventually succeeded by Bidar.\n\nThe monarchs of this kingdom had an administrative style akin to that of the feudal system.\n\nAt that time, its provinces or states were referred to as Taraf.\n\nPersian was the official language, while Urdu, Deccani, Marathi, Telugu, and Kannada were widely used regional tongues.\n\nBahmani Kingdom Rulers\n\nThe Afaquis and Deccanis nobles of the Bahmani kingdom were divided into these two groups. While Afaquis were nobles of foreign descent, Deccanis were native-born. There were 14 Bahamian Sultans in total. The Bahamani Sultanate facilitated cultural exchange between the South and the North. It extended from the Wainganga River to Krishna in the north and from Bhongir to Daulatabad in the east and west.\n\nThe Bahmani Kingdom Rulers include:\n\nHasan Gangu Bahmani\n\nIn the present-day Deccan region of India, he founded the Bahmani dynasty.\n\nHe previously served as a Turkish officer for Devagiri under Muhammad Bin Tughlaq.\n\nIn 1347, he formed the Bahmani Kingdom.\n\nHis dominion stretched from the Arabian Sea in the west to the Bay of Bengal in the east, and it included the entire Deccan region up to the Krishna River. Devagiri served as its capital.\n\nMuhammad Shah I\n\nHe took over from his father to lead the Bahmani Kingdom as its second king.\n\nHe was an excellent general and administrator.\n\nHe vanquished Bukka-I of Vijayanagara and the Kapila Nayaks of Warangal.\n\nMuhammad Shah II\n\nIn 1378, he assumed the throne.\n\nHe made significant contributions to the Bahmani Empire’s architecture.\n\nHe had a calm disposition and built cordial diplomatic ties with his neighbours.\n\nHe constructed hospitals to treat the residents of his state. He also constructed numerous mosques, madrasas, and other religious institutions.\n\nFeroz Shah Bahmani\n\nMost people agree that Taj ud-Din Feroz Shah was the best sultan of the Bahmani Kingdom.\n\nHe married the daughter of Vijayanagara Empire Emperor Deva Raya I after defeating him.\n\nOn the banks of the Bhima River, he founded the city of Firozabad.\n\nHe valued culture, poetry, and the arts.\n\nAhmad Shah\n\nAfter Feroz Shah Bahmani, Ahmad Shah assumed the role of the ruler in 1422.\n\nHe was a cruel and violent monarch who lacked compassion.\n\nHe was successful in subduing the Warangal kingdom.\n\nHe made Bidar his capital instead of Gulbarga.\n\nIn the year 1435 A.D., he passed away as was expected.\n\nMuhammad Shah III\n\nMuhammad Shah ll ascended to Sultan of the Bahmani Kingdom in 1463 A.D at just nine years old.\n\nSultan was too young; therefore, Muhammad Gawan took over as regent.\n\nBecause of the skilful leadership of Muhammad Gawan, the Bahmani kingdom rose to great strength.\n\nMuhammad Gawan vanquished the sultans of Sangameshwar, Orissa, Konkan, and Vijayanagar.\n\nMuhammad Gawan\n\nHe was a sage academic and a superb administrator.\n\nHis efforts to organise the finances, promote public education, modify the tax code, and discipline the army allowed him to enhance the administration.\n\nTo a significant extent, he was effective in eliminating corruption.\n\nMuhammad Shah III executed Muhammad Gawan in 1481 as punishment for being persecuted by Deccan Muslims.\n\nAdministration Under Bahmani Kingdom\n\nIn the Bahmani Kingdom, the system of government was feudal. For administrative purposes, the kingdom was divided into four “Taraf,” or provinces. Daultabad, Bidar, Berar, and Gulbarga were these provinces.\n\nEvery province was under the control of a tarafdar, sometimes known as a subedar.\n\nFrom the tarafdar’s purview, some territory was turned into Khalisa land. The Khalisa land was the land used to support the king’s and his household’s costs.\n\nNobles used to receive their pay in cash or the form of a land grant, or “jagir,”\n\nIn 1482, Muhammad Shah III died. The Bahmani kingdom soon fell into decay and was split into the following successor kingdoms, each with a different king.\n\nThe Adilshahis of Bijapur (1490-1686 A.D.)\n\nThe Nizam Shahis of Ahmednagar (1490-1633 A.D.)\n\nThe Qutub Shahis of Golconda (1518-1687 A.D.)\n\nThe Imadshahis of Bera (1490-1574 A.D.)\n\nThe Baridshahis of Bidar (1528-1619 A.D.)\n\nMilitary During the Bahmani Empire\n\nThe monarch of the Bahamas relied on his amirs for military assistance. The two groups that made up the ranks of amirs were the Deccanis, who were long-term residents of the Deccan region and were immigrants from the Muslim faith. The other group was Afaquis or Pardesis, who had just arrived from Iraq, Iran, and Central Asia.\n\nThe Bahamanis were accustomed to using gunpowder in battle.\n\nLiterature During the Bahmani Sultanate Period\n\nPersian, Arabic, and Urdu literature flourished. Mohammad Gawan published Persian-language poetry. His works include Riyaz-ul-Insha and Manazir-ul-Insha.\n\nDuring this period, “Dakhini Urdu,” a new dialect, gained popularity.\n\nKhwaja Bande Nawaz Gesu Daraj, a well-known Sufi saint from Gulbarga, wrote in this dialect.\n\nBahmani Kingdom: Art and Architecture\n\nThe Bahmani Kingdom modified the Indo-Islamic architectural style to some extent. The buildings were made using local materials. Persian architecture had a big impact on the design.\n\nThe features of this style are:\n\nCrescent moon at the top of the building\n\nTall minarets\n\nSpacious Hazaras\n\nStrong arches\n\nHuge domes\n\nThe Bahmani rulers were fond of art and architecture and built many mosques, madrasas and libraries. Some of them are:\n\nThe Golgumbaz at Bijapur (also called the whispering gallery)\n\nThe Madrasas of Muhammad Gawan\n\nThe Juma Masjid at Gulbarga\n\nThe Golconda Fort\n\nBahmani Kingdom UPSC\n\nThe Bahmani Sultanate is an important topic of the medieval history of India, covered under the UPSC Syllabus.
