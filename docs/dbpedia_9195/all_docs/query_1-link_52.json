        "text": "New Delhi: Southern India has been a Hindu-dominated region where kings and kingdoms belonged to the Hindu religion. The first Independent Islamic Kingdom in South India that rose to power was the Bahmani Sultanate or the Bahmani Kingdom. It could be called one of the great medieval kingdoms of India founded against Muhammad bin Tughlaq of the Delhi Sultanate by Zafar Khan. Zafar Khan was of Turkish origin and took the title Ala-ud-din Hassan Bahman Shah and established the Bahmani Kingdom that ruled for over 200 years from 1347 CE to 1518 CE. Around 1518, Krishnadeva Raya of the Vijayanagar Empire defeated the last ruler of the Bahmani empire. After this, the latter broke down into 5 states, collectively known as Deccan Sultanates.\n\nThese five Deccan Sultanates were: Adilshahi of Bijapur, Baridshahis of Bidar, Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, Qutubshahi of Golconda (Hyderabad), and Imadshahi of Berar.\n\nRise, expansion and fall of the Bahmani Empire\n\nThe Bahmani Kingdom rose to power after the Turkish Governor Ala-ud-din Hassan Bahman Shan established an independent empire by revolting against the Sultan of Delhi Sultanate Muhammad Bin Tughlaq in 1347. It was established in present-day Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh. They set up the capital in Ahsanabad (Gulbarga) between 1347 and 1425 and later moved to Bidar.\n\nThe kingdom saw a reign of over 200 years during which many internal conflicts were seen.\n\nWith a consistent confrontation with the Vijayanagar Empire in the south, the power of the Bahmani Sultanate touched its peak under Mahmud Gawan from 1466 to 1481. He extended the empire by reconquering Goa which was under the Vijayanagar empire at the time.\n\nAfter he drank himself to death, the empire started collapsing. There have been internal conflicts in the empire, but the primary foe of the kingdom was the Vijayanagar empire. Krishnadeva Raya of the Vijayanagar Empire disintegrated the Bahmani kingdom into five different states namely the Nizam Shahis of Ahmed Nagar, the Adilshahis of Bijapur, the Imadshahis of Berar, the Qutubshahis of Golconda, the Baridshahis of Bidar.\n\nThese states commenced declaring independence from the Bahmani kingdom. Angered by the disintegration, Bidar, Ahmadnagar, Golconda, and Bijapur together attacked Vijayanagar. All these Deccan Sultanates on one side and the Vijanayagar on the other. The latter was defeated in 1565 in what is known as the battle of Talikota.\n\nAfter Vijayanagar was destroyed, Bahmani did not remain in power for long. Akbar, and then Aurangzeb annexed these kingdoms into the Mughal Empire.\n\nAdministration\n\nThe kingdom was divided into four administrative regions or provinces called ‘taraf’. These were Daulatabad, Bidar, Berar, and Gulbarga. Each province had a tarafdar or subedar.\n\nBahmani rulers were dependent on their amirs for military support. They used gunpowder in wars.\n\nArt and Architecture\n\nThe Bahmanis were known to have an enthusiasm for architecture and art. They tried architects from several parts of the Muslim world and amalgamated their styles.\n\nAla-ud-din Bahman constructed a large number of buildings including the Jama Masjid and the Bala Hisar.\n\nSince the rulers emphasised the need for education, art and architecture flourished during the kingdom’s rule.\n\nDuring this period, Urdu, Arabic, and Persian literature were abundant. Mohammad Gawan ascribed poems in Persian, Riyaz-ul-Insha, and Manazir-ul-insha are his noted works.\n\nIt was during this period when a new dialect, ‘Dakhini Urdu’ prevailed. In architecture, Bahmani period followed the Indo-Islamic style of architecture with a few changes. Buildings were constructed by using local materials. An influence of Persian architecture could be seen in the buildings of this period. Tall minarets, huge domes, strong arches, Hazaras, a crescent moon at the top, etc, are some features of the structures of this period.\n\nExamples of architecture could be found at Gulbarga (Shah bazaar mosque, Hafta Gumbaz, Jama maszid), at Bijapur (Gol gumbaz, Ibrahim roza, Bara Kaman, etc.), and at Bidar (Rangeen mahal, Janata mahal)."
