        "text": "Bidar Fort is located in Bidar city of Karnataka state, India. The city, the district and the fort are all tagged with the name Bidar. The name Bidar comes from “Bidiru” which means Bamboo. Earlier there was a bamboo jungle at the current area of Bidar. In the past it was called as Bedadakota or Bedarkot (kota/kot means fort).\n\nBidar fort was built by Ahmad Shah wali Bahman. The layout of the old fort, with double lines of defensive walls is no longer visible. In 1321-22 the old fort of Bidar was captured by the Tughlaq Dynasty, Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq of Delhi. Later in the year 1347 with the establishment of Bahmabi Sultanate Bidar was occupied by Sultan Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah.\n\nFrom 1422-1486, during the rule of Ahmad Shah I, Bidar was made the capital of Bahmani Kingdom. The old fort was rebuilt with amazing mosques, gardens and palaces under his rule. Noteworthy for its distinct Persian architectural style, the fort houses an ancient city with a multitude of monuments such as Rangin Mahal, Takhat Mahal etc. This fort is also the site of the origin of the famous Persian art form of Bidriware.\n\nThe palace has a number of small courtyards. The Solah Khamba Masjid (sixteen columned mosque) faces eastwards onto a formal garden.\n\nQuite close to the Royal Bath and in front of the mosque there was Lal Bagh (Red Garden) so named on account of its beautiful layout or due to the red flowers grown there. In the middle of the Lal bagh one can see a beautiful cistern. The Lal Bagh has a central tank and an axial channel which used to take water from the Tarkash Mahal (Turkish Pavilion) to the hamam (hot baths).\n\nSource\n\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bidar_Fort_Garden.JPG\n\nhttp://siaphotography.in/blog/bidar-fort-history-ancient-monuments/\n\nhttp://www.icomos.org/publications/93garden5.pdf\n\nhttp://www.gardenvisit.com/gardens/bidar_palace_gardens\n\nhttp://www.skyscrapercity.com/showthread.php?t=1668851&page=10"
