        "text": "Late mediaeval Indian kingdom (1492–1619)\n\nNot to be confused with the Bahmani Sultanate, which ruled from Bidar.\n\nThe Sultanate of Bidar was an early modern Indian polity that ruled a territory in the central Deccan centred at Bidar.[4] As one of the Deccan sultanates, the sultanate's initial territory corresponded to that of one of the five provinces of the Bahmani Sultanate, and under the rule of Qasim Barid I in 1492 assumed de facto control of state affairs of the Bahmani Sultanate. Leadership passed to his sons; Amir Barid I in 1504 and Ali Barid Shah I in 1542. Starting from the 1580s as a result of Ali's death, a wave of successions occurred in the rulership of the dynasty which ended in 1609 under the last sultan, Amir Barid III. He was eventually defeated in 1619 by Ibrahim Adil Shah II of the Sultanate of Bijapur, who annexed the territory of the Bidar Sultanate into his realm.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nQasim Barid and Amir Barid\n\n[edit]\n\nThe sultanate was founded in 1492 by Qasim Barid I, who was a Turk[6][7][8][9] or Georgian and enslaved by Turks. He joined the service of the Bahmani Sultan Muhammad Shah III. He started his career as a sar-naubat, and was made kotwal of Bidar by Nizam-ul-Mulk Bahri for helping the Deccanis in the massacre of the foreign population at Bidar.[11] However, he later became the mir-jumla (prime minister) of the Bahmani sultanate. During the reign of Mahmood Shah Bahmani II (r. 1482 – 1518), he became the de facto ruler of the Bahmani Sultanate.\n\nAfter the death of Mahmud Shah Bahmani in 1518, he was succeeded by four sultans, one after another, but they were mere puppets in the hands of Amir Barid.[13]\n\nWhen the last Bahmani ruler Kalimullah fled to Bidar in 1527, Amir Barid I became practically independent, as his de jure suzerain's state ceased to exist. However, he never assumed any royal title.\n\nAli Barid Shah\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1542, Amir was succeeded by his son Ali Barid Shah I, who was the first to assume the royal title of Shah. Ali Barid joined the other Deccan sultans in the Battle of Talikota against the Vijayanagar Empire in January 1565.\n\nLater rulers\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter his death in 1580, Ali Barid was succeeded by his son Ibrahim Barid, who ruled for seven years until his death in 1587. He was succeeded by his younger brother Qasim Barid II. After his death in 1591, he was succeeded by his infant son Ali Barid II, who was soon dethroned by one of his relative, Amir Barid II. In 1601, he was also overthrown by one of his relative, Mirza Ali Barid.\n\nIn 1609, he was succeeded by the last ruler, Amir Barid III, who fought against the Mughals in 1616 under the leadership of Malik Ambar. In 1619, he was defeated by the Bijapur sultan Ibrahim Adil Shah II. Bidar was annexed to Bijapur sultanate. Amir Barid III and his sons were brought to Bijapur and kept \"under surveillance\".\n\nCulture\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Deccan sultanates § Bidar\n\nThe rulers patronized Persianate culture. Persian poetry is inscribed on their tombs.\n\nArchitecture\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Barid Shahi tombs\n\nThe Bidar Sultanate made considerable additions to the Bidar Fort. Their tombs, the Barid Shahi tombs, were their main architectural pursuits, and are also located at Bidar.[21][22] The rulers employed Hindu architects and engineers for the construction of these buildings, which resulted in amalgamation of some Hindu features within the architecture of this period.\n\nRulers\n\n[edit]\n\nName Reign Qasim Barid I 1489 – 1504 Amir Barid I 1504 – 1542 Ali Barid Shah I 1542 – 1580 Ibrahim Barid Shah 1580 – 1587 Qasim Barid Shah II 1587 – 1591 Ali Barid Shah II 1591 Amir Barid Shah II 1591 – 1601 Mirza Ali Barid Shah III 1601 – 1609 Amir Barid Shah III 1609 – 1619\n\nGallery\n\n[edit]\n\nCalligraphy in coloured tiles\n\nAshtur Tombs\n\nTombs of Bidar Shahi kings at Barid Shahi Park in Bidar\n\nTombs at Barid Shahi Park in Bidar\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Shi'a Muslims dynasties\n\nBattle of Talikota\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nCitations\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nBosworth, C.E.
