Bidar

As the Bahmani sultans slid into decline in the late fifteenth century, they became increasingly reliant on their prime ministers for guidance and advice. Ultimately, these ministers would supplant the Bahmanis and take Bidar—the stronghold of the Bahmanis located in the heart of the Deccan—as the capital of their own sultanate.

The Barid Shahi dynasty (1587–1619) ruled over the smallest of the five sultanates and would be defeated by Bijapur. At their capital they built many fine palaces and tombs in original styles and with precious materials such as mother-of-pearl set into black granite. Bidar's most famous artistic product is bidri ware, a unique type of inlaid metalwork. Boxes, trays, and huqqa bases for smoking tobacco were fashioned from this dark metal alloy with silver and brass hammered onto the surface to create flowers, arabesque vines, and other lively designs.
