        "text": "Geoff Bennett:\n\nAn influential group of Republican legal voices today endorsed the January 2024 trial date proposed by special counsel Jack Smith in his 2020 election interference case against former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe group included former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales appointed by George W. Bush, and J. Michael Luttig, a retired federal appellate judge and one of the nation's leading conservative legal minds.\n\nJudy Woodruff recently visited Judge Luttig at his home in Colorado as part of her ongoing series America at a Crossroads.\n\nJ. Michael Luttig, Former Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge: I understood the gravity of this matter. And I understood from my lifetime of experience in and around those offices and those institutions that this was catastrophic for America and for American democracy.\n\nJudy Woodruff:\n\nRetired Judge Michael Luttig is one of the most influential conservatives to have served in the federal judiciary. He clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia while he was on the appellate circuit, served as assistant counsel to President Ronald Reagan, and was the assistant attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, who later appointed him to the United States Court of Appeals.\n\nHe was twice considered for nomination himself to the Supreme Court.\n\nJudy Woodruff:\n\nChallenging Trump so publicly thrust him into the hot lights of American politics, where he's been ever since.\n\nWe sat down with Judge Luttig at his home in Vail, Colorado, to talk about where the country is in the aftermath of the past two-and-a-half tumultuous years.\n\nYou have been saying for months that Americans have lost their moral compass and that, with this loss of direction, Americans have lost all perspective.\n\nWhat brought you to that conclusion?\n\nJ. Michael Luttig:\n\nFor almost 250 years, Judy, there was all but a consensus among the American public on the fundamental values and principles on which America was founded.\n\nAnd then, all of a sudden, it seems we don't agree on anything at all. We have not talked to each other as friends and fellow citizens, Americans who share the same destiny and have the same hopes and dreams for America for six or eight years now.\n\nJ. Michael Luttig:\n\nI am. I know that there's more that we agree on than that we disagree on.\n\nOur officials and our elected leaders have talked to the nation and talked to we Americans as if we were enemies of each other. And we have never been enemies of each other. Over the timeline of the past 10, 15, 20 years, leaders on both sides of the aisle have failed us.\n\nBut, as of today, and for the past two-and-a-half years, since January 6, 2021, it has been the Republicans who have reprehensibly failed us as Americans. On January 6, the former president and the Republican allies, his allies and supporters, declared war on American democracy.\n\nJ. Michael Luttig:\n\nHe bears a disproportionate share of responsibility, if not the entire responsibility.\n\nThe former president sought to overturn an American election which he had lost fair and square. For four years, these claims by the former president and his Republican allies have corroded and corrupted American democracy and American elections. Vast, vast numbers of Americans, into the millions, today no longer believe in the elections in the United States of America.\n\nThey no longer believe in the institutions of law and democracy in America, the very pillars of our foundation. And many of those people have begun even to question the Constitution of the United States.\n\nJ. Michael Luttig:\n\nWe can expect that if the president were to be acquitted, that he and all of his supporters would claim that that was vindication that he was right that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.\n\nWere that to be the case, I don't believe that American democracy could be saved, at least in the near future.\n\nJ. Michael Luttig:\n\nThe issue with Hunter Biden and the issue with the former president, they are not similar in any way at all, let alone in gravity or consequence.\n\nIt's the incumbent president's son and the personal conduct that he's being charged — accused of is of a pedestrian nature by comparison to what the former president has now been indicted for.\n\nJudy Woodruff:\n\nReturning to something that you have spoken about in this interview, a big part of today's problems with what we're facing as a country has to do with political leaders, elected officials.\n\nWhat about individuals like the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, like Senator Lindsey Graham, who are leaders in the party, but have not so far spoken out clearly against former President Trump?\n\nJ. Michael Luttig:\n\nAny leader, Republican or Democrat, who has not spoken against January 6 and the former president's role in it has betrayed their oath.\n\nJanuary 6 and what the former president did is not politics. And it certainly is not partisan politics. This is far above and beyond politics.\n\nAnd, as we now know, it's literally crimes against the United States of America. But all of our politicians, and especially the Republicans, have regarded it as nothing more than politics. In that respect, they have failed Americans. It's critical to American democracy that you have two very strong political parties who are competing against each other on the issues, the public policy issues before the nation.\n\nWe can't have one party who is supporting and defending what occurred on January 6, together with the president of the United States who caused January 6. We can't have that. We cannot function until the Republican Party comes to its senses.\n\nAnd, in my view, I don't consider the Republican Party a political party in the United States at the moment."
