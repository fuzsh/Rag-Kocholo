        "text": "Judge Luttig provided the following statement with respect to the companyâs tax case with the IRS:\n\nâAmerican companies cannot run their businesses with the uncertainty of the retroactive application of newly minted IRS tax policies to prior tax years that are contrary to the IRS' own previously approved policies and then be required to pay billions of dollars in unanticipated increased taxes that result from the retroactive application of these new tax policies.\n\nâFor 20 years, The Coca‑Cola Company reported U.S. taxable income from its non-U.S. operations under a methodology agreed to by the IRS and repeatedly audited and approved by the IRS. In an abrupt departure from its established position long after the tax years in question, the IRS reversed its position, disapproved that approved methodology, required a new tax calculation methodology, and now seeks to impose a retroactive tax increase on the company for past tax years.\n\nâI would expect the federal courts to appreciate the inappropriateness of the IRSâ new methodology for calculating The Coca‑Cola Companyâs taxes, in addition to the fundamental unfairness of the IRSâ belated demand that the company retroactively pay billions of dollars in taxes beyond those calculated and paid by the company in accordance with IRS-approved tax methodology.â\n\nLuttig joined Boeing after 15 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Before he was appointed to the federal bench by President George H.W. Bush, he served as assistant attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice and counselor to the attorney general of the United States. He was assistant counsel to the President at The White House from 1981 to 1982 under President Ronald Reagan. From 1982 to 1983, he was a law clerk to then-Judge Antonin Scalia of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. From 1983 to 1985, he served as a law clerk and then special assistant to the chief justice of the United States.\n\nThis press release may contain statements, estimates or projections that constitute âforward-looking statementsâ as defined under U.S. federal securities laws. Generally, the words âbelieve,â âexpect,â âintend,â âestimate,â âanticipate,â âproject,â âwillâ and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature.
