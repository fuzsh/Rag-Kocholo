        "text": "WASHINGTON, May 10 â€” Judge J. Michael Luttig, who came close to being nominated for the Supreme Court, resigned today from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to become senior vice president and general counsel of the Boeing Company.\n\nJudge Luttig told President Bush that he had loved \"every single aspect and every single moment\" of his 15 years on the Richmond-based tribunal, but that the Boeing opportunity, which came \"through serendipity,\" was just too good to turn down.\n\nJudge Luttig, 51, was widely reported to have been on President Bush's short list of Supreme Court possibilities last fall, when he was looking for a replacement for Harriet E. Miers, the White House counsel whose nomination came under intense criticism and was withdrawn. Instead, the nomination went to Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr., who now sits on the high court.\n\nThere was no sense of what might have been in Judge Luttig's letter to the president, only a note of sadness to be leaving the Fourth Circuit, and gratitude to the first President Bush, who installed him on the court in 1991.\n\n\"I want to express my heartfelt thanks to your father, because of whom my professional dreams in life came true,\" Judge Luttig wrote. \"For the opportunities that have been mine because of him, I will forever be grateful to him and to your family.\"\n\nJudge Luttig was the youngest federal circuit judge in the nation when at age 37 he took his seat on what is considered the most conservative of the federal circuits. He had been an aide to Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and was an assistant counsel in the administration of President Ronald Reagan.\n\nJudge Luttig hinted that money had played a part in his decision. Writing of his obligations to his family, he noted that his daughter is nearing college age, and that his son is \"not long behind.\" In his new post, he will be in a position to earn far more than federal circuit judges, who make about $170,000 a year."
