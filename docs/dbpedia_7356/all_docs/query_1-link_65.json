        "text": "Impact of the New Supreme Court\n\nA Conversation with Laurence H. Tribe and J. Michael Luttig moderated by Kimberly Atkins Stohr\n\nTHURSDAY, JULY 6TH 6:00 - 7:00 PM EDT\n\nVIA ZOOM\n\nThe new conservative Supreme Court concludes its term with a bang -- having delivered some of the most significant rulings in modern times. Consequential decisions on issues have ranged from rulings on voting rights, affirmative action, student loans, election law, free speech and LGBTQ civil rights, to its landmark overturning of Roe v. Wade on reproductive rights.\n\nWhat is the impact on our nation and society? Join The Common Good and legal experts Laurence H. Tribe one of the nation’s most distinguished constitutional experts of our time, and Judge J Michael Luttig, one of the most respected conservative voices in the justice system, to discuss the profound implications of the Court’s rulings in a conversation moderated by political and legal commentator for the Boston Globe and MSNBC Kimberly Atkins Stohr.\n\nLaurence H. Tribe, the Carl M. Loeb University Professor and Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard, has taught at its Law School since 1968 and was voted the best professor by the graduating class of 2000. The title “University Professor” is Harvard’s highest academic honor, awarded to just a handful of professors at any given time and to just 68 professors in all of Harvard University’s history.\n\nHe has helped write the constitutions of South Africa, the Czech Republic, and the Marshall Islands; has received eleven honorary degrees, most recently a degree honoris causa from the Government of Mexico in March 2011 that was never before awarded to an American; has prevailed in three-fifths of the many appellate cases he has argued (including 35 in the U.S. Supreme Court); was appointed in 2010 by President Obama and Attorney General Holder to serve as the first Senior Counselor for Access to Justice; and has written 115 books and articles, including his treatise, American Constitutional Law, cited more than any other legal text since 1950. In 2021 President Joe Biden appointed Larry to serve on the Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nKimberly Atkins Stohr is a senior opinion writer at The Boston Globe. She is also an MSNBC contributor. Before launching her journalism career, she was a trial and appellate litigation attorney in Boston. Previously, Kimberly was the first Washington, DC-based news correspondent for WBUR. She has also served as the Boston Herald’s Washington bureau chief, guest host of C-SPAN’s morning call-in show “Washington Journal,” and a Supreme Court reporter for Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly and its sister publications. She has appeared as a political commentator on a host of national and international television and radio networks.\n\nJ. Michael Luttig was appointed by president George H. W. Bush to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for 15 years, from 1991 to 2006 and has become one of the most knowledgeable and respective conservative voices in the justice system. In January 2021, Judge Luttig was sought out by Vice President Mike Pence for counsel. He convinced Pence that no Vice President nor any other single individual, elected or otherwise, had any legitimate power to overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential election."
