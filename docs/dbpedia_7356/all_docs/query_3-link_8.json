        "meta_description": "The 23rd annual Henry J. Abraham Distinguished Lectureship features Judge J. Michael Luttig, who served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and testified before the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. The Abraham Distinguished Lecture honors renowned constitutional law scholar Henry J. Abraham (1921â€“2020), who was James Hart Professor of Government, Emeritus, at the University of Virginia. The annual Henry J. Abraham Distinguished Lecture was established in 1999 by his students, colleagues, family, and friends to honor him. Abraham was the James Hart Professor of Government Emeritus, and was among the most renowned constitutional scholars in the field of political science. His life story of escaping the Nazis in 1937 at the age of 15, serving as a U.S. Army interpreter during WWII, and then devoting his life to the U.S. Constitution is as compelling as it is poignant. Previous lecturers have included Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Justice Antonin Scalia, Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, John Jeffries, Ted Olson, William Suter, Anne-Marie Slaughter, Nadine Strossen, Thomas Pickering, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Tinsley Yarbrough, Kenneth Feinberg, and journalists Linda Greenhouse, Joan Biskupic, Jan Crawford, Marcia Coyle, and Evan Thomas.",
