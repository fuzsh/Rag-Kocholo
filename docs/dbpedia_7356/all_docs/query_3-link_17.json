        "text": "Topline\n\nRetired federal judge J. Michael Luttig, who spent his career serving under conservative presidents and justices, testified to the House January 6 Committee Thursday that former Vice President Mike Pence had no legal authority to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 presidential election and doing so would have provoked a “constitutional crisis,” describing Trump’s post-election efforts as a “war on democracy.”\n\nKey Facts\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n“I believe that had Vice President Pence obeyed the orders from [Trump] … that declaration of Donald Trump as the next president would have plunged America into what I believe would have been tantamount to a revolution within a constitutional crisis in America, which in my view … would have been the first constitutional crisis since the founding of the Republic,” Luttig testified to Congress Thursday, later saying he “would have laid my body across the road” sooner than let Pence overturn the results.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) considers Luttig his mentor and has described the judge, for whom he worked as a law clerk, as “like a father to me.” Among Luttig’s other former law clerks is Trump attorney John Eastman, who helped Trump try to overturn the 2020 election results and pushed for Pence to block Congress’ vote count. Luttig vigorously objected to Eastman’s efforts on Thursday, calling attempts to legally justify overturning the election “constitutional mischief.”\n\nKey Background\n\nLawmakers used Luttig and Pence attorney Greg Jacob as witnesses Thursday as they argued Trump pressured Pence to overturn the election results despite the president and Eastman knowing he had no authority to legally do so. Trump was repeatedly told that Pence could not legally challenge the vote count, Pence’s chief of staff testified to the committee, but he continued to push the plan anyway, leading to his supporters storming the Capitol building and threatening violence against the vice president. Luttig also testified there was also no legal justification for the “fake electors” scheme the Trump campaign pushed, in which Republicans submitted alternate slates of electors to Congress claiming Trump won battleground states and not Biden. Thursday’s hearing marked the third of at least seven public hearings the January 6 committee is holding, which detail how Trump “oversaw and coordinated” a plan to overturn the election that culminated with the January 6 attack on the Capitol building.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nJan. 6 Hearing: Republican Who Advised Pence Will Testify Trump Had ‘Well-Developed Plan’ To Overturn Election (Forbes)\n\nJan. 6 Hearings: Pence Told Trump ‘Many Times’ He Couldn’t Overturn Election Results, Staffer Says (Forbes)"
