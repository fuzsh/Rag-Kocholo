        "text": "Retired federal Judge J. Michael Luttig of Tyler says the Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity was a \"faithless decision.\"\n\nA retired conservative federal judge from Texas who once was under consideration for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court is endorsing the call by President Joe Biden that would effectively nullify the high court's recent ruling that presidents are immune from prosecution if their official actions violate the law.\n\n\"No longer can it be said that in America no man is above the law, because on that day, the Supreme Court held that the President of the United States — and in particular the former president of the United States — actually is above the law,\" former federal Appeals Court Judge J. Michael Luttig said as a part of a string of social media posts after Biden, during his appearance Monday in Austin, called for a sweeping overhaul of how the nation's highest court operates.\n\nLuttig, who lives in Tyler, about 220 miles northeast of Austin, and had served on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for 15 years ending in 2006, said he supports an amendment to the U.S. Constitution \"that would repudiate the Supreme Court’s faithless decision\" on July 1 involving former President Donald Trump and efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The high court, in a split decision, found that presidents have an “exclusive sphere of constitutional authority” that gives them immunity in criminal cases.\n\nBiden, who loudly condemned the high court's ruling the day it was issued, devoted much of his speech at the LBJ Presidential Library marking the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act to call for several reforms to the nine-member Supreme Court, including enacting an enforceable code of ethics and limiting the justice's now-lifetime terms to 18 years.\n\nBiden also called for enacting a constitutional amendment to limit immunity for presidents.\n\nLuttig, who was nominated to the federal appeals bench in 1991 by President George H.W. Bush, did not address the other recommendations Biden laid out during his appearance in Austin. But on the issue of presidential immunity, the retired judge in his posts on X, formerly Twitter, invoked the writings of U.S. Founder Thomas Paine in his 1776 pamphlet \"Common Sense\" regarding a \"King of America.\"\n\nMore: 'Masterful': Former conservative judge applauds decision to remove Donald Trump from Colorado ballot\n\n\"In America the law is king,\" Luttig, 70, wrote, quoting Paine. \"For as in absolute governments the King is law, so in free countries the law ought to be king; and there ought to be no other.\n\n\"Thomas Paine’s answer stood unchallenged and unquestioned as America’s answer and response to monarchical government by Kings and Queens for almost 250 years. That is, until July 1, 2024.\"\n\nIn his retirement, Luttig has emerged as one of Trump's harshest critics, particularly for how the former president handled the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n“Donald Trump and his supporters and allies are a clear and present danger to American democracy,” Luttig told the House Select Committee on the Jan. 6 attack, which investigated the events of that day and those in the days leading up to the storming of the Capitol in advance of the constitutionally required congressional certification of the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nIn December, Luttig told MSNBC that Trump should not be eligible to serve again as president.\n\n“Indeed, the Constitution tells us that it is the conduct that can give rise to disqualification,\" he told the cable news outlet. \"Namely, an insurrection or rebellion that is antidemocratic. To me, that’s about as clear as any document or Constitution could make that point.\"\n\nHis string of posts regarding Biden's proposal came 3½ years after another string relating to the powers and obligations of the presidency, and it came after an attorney for then-Vice President Mike Pence sought Luttig's guidance over the question of whether the vice president, as the Senate's presiding officer, had any authority to influence Congress' role in certifying a presidential election.\n\nThe date of that of that string was Jan. 5, 2021, one day before the attack at the Capitol.\n\n\"The only responsibility and power of the Vice President under the Constitution is to faithfully count the electoral college votes as they have been cast,\" Luttig wrote. \"The Constitution does not empower the Vice President to alter in any way the votes that have been cast, either by rejecting certain of them or otherwise.\n\n\"How the Vice President discharges this constitutional obligation is not a question of his loyalty to the President any more than it would be a test of a President's loyalty to his Vice President. No President and no Vice President would -- or should -- consider either event as a test of political loyalty of one to the other.\"\n\nIn the early 2000s while serving on the federal Appeals Court based in Virginia, Luttig became a big player in Texas' aggressive use of the death penalty. In 1994, Luttig's father, John Luttig, was shot to death during a carjacking in East Texas. The gunman, 17 at the time of the killing, was condemned to death.\n\nIn the years and months leading up to the 2002 execution of the shooter, Napolean Beazley, death penalty opponents argued that offenders who committed capital murder before turning 18 should not be subject to execution. Luttig testified that the death sentence for his father's killer should be upheld.\n\nDuring George W. Bush's presidency, Luttig was considered to fill an opening on the Supreme Court but was not nominated. Early in his legal career, Luttig was an appeals court clerk for future Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia."
