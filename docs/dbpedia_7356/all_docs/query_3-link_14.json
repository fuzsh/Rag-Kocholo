        "text": "\"Never again will the world be inspired by America's democracy in the way that it has been inspired since America's founding almost 250 years ago,\" Luttig added.\n\nLuttig previously spoke at one of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol's public hearings in 2022. He said that if Pence had followed Trump's command on January 6, 2021, to overturn the presidential election results, it would \"have been the first constitutional crisis since the founding of the Republic.\"\n\nThe former judge, who previously acted as an informal adviser for Vice President Mike Pence and was a law clerk to former Justice Antonin Scalia, was once close with Sen. Ted Cruz, who said he was \"like a father to me.\"\n\nCruz later named Luttig as an ideal candidate to become a Supreme Court justice, noting in a presidential debate that he would have preferred to have Luttig on the court instead of Chief Justice John Roberts.\n\nThe indictment levied against Trump on Wednesday charged him with \"conspiracy to defraud the United States,\" \"conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding,\" \"obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding,\" and a \"conspiracy against rights.\"\n\nThe indictment is the second federal indictment Trump has been hit with in 2023, alongside charges levied against him in Florida for mishandling classified documents after he left the White House. A Manhattan district attorney also brought charges against Trump this year tied to an alleged hush-money scheme related to adult film star Stormy Daniels."
