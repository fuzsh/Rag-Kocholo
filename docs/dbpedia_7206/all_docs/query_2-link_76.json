I had never seen the movie, but am an avowed Sherlock Holmes obsessive, so I'd always had interest. My wife informs me that as a member of my generation, I must have not had a childhood and grown up under a rock to have missed it. I've also never seen The Goonies. Yes, I know. I'm still trying to determine what, precisely, is wrong with me.\n\nVincent Price's Professor Ratigan, the reason to watch the movie.\n\nI was delighted to find out that Vincent Price voiced the villain (which I knew but had forgotten), and even more than that, I was thrilled to find this Disney movie was decidedly scary, dark and weird. That said, it didn't really light me on fire, and mind, this comes from a guy who watches The Little Mermaid for fun every once in a while. I had an added desire to see this after seeing Waking Sleeping Beauty, the wonderful doc about this era of Disney history, at SXSW."
