        "text": "DisneyPlus is apparently an amazing resource for all kinds of entertainment options. I am told yesterday, a slew of new Star Wars and Marvel movies and shows were announced, as well as a bevy of other programming. That’s all well and good; I know many RAVE about The Mandalorian. Me, I’ve never watched one episode. I’m afraid my Star Wars fanhood has stayed strictly with the movies; no animated series, and no Mandalorian. Maybe that will change at some point; for now, though, DisneyPlus serves one purpose, and one purpose only: allowing me to revisit films I haven’t watched in decades….like 3 decades, maybe even 4!\n\nSince getting DisneyPlus, I’ve watched Fantasia (probably last watched in high school; and for frame of reference, I graduated in 1991); Pinocchio…..no idea when I last watched that, maybe junior high; Bedknobs and Broomsticks, used to really like when I was a younger,…it sadly hasn’t endured as well as I’d like; and most recently, Snow White, which I may have not seen since my age was in single digits. If not that long ago, it had to be close!\n\nOf the films listed above, all, except for Bedknobs and Broomsticks, are unquestioned Disney masterpieces. You do a list of the greatest films that Walt Disney himself was part of, all those, save Bedknobs, are going to be on that list every time. But today’s blog is not about any of those. No, today’s blog is about a Disney film I saw once in the theaters, I must’ve been in junior high at the time, loved it….and then it was gone. I never saw it again, its characters never made an appearance at Disneyland, I don’t think I ever saw it on TV. It just sort of stayed as a memory in my childhood, something pleasant, a past enjoyment. Sort of like a root beer float, which I also don’t think I’ve had since junior high! But thanks to DisneyPlus I was able to watch for only the second time in my life, and for the first time since 1986, this seemingly forgotten Disney film:\n\nAnd when I say The Great Mouse Detective is vanished from common Disney fandom, I’m not just talking about no ride in the theme park. I’m talking about…..no one talking about! I can’t remember the last time I ever discussed this film with anyone. Maybe because it came out in 1986, 3 years before The Little Mermaid. My current college students love Disney, but Ariel and Sebastian seem (For the most part) to be where their Disney knowledge begins. If asked to bring up an underrated or forgotten Disney flick, I’m likely to hear The Hunchback of Notre Dame or Atlantis: The Lost Empire. I don’t think I’ve ever heard anyone mention The Great Mouse Detective in….well, ever! Imagine my surprise, when out of curiosity, I read on Wikipedia that not only did the film make money, it basically convinced Disney executives to keep making animated films. And what came 3 years later? You’d think a film whose success made The Little Mermaid possible would be better known. Why this neglect?\n\nWell, fortunately, DisneyPlus doesn’t just keep Star Wars or Disney classics….it apparently has every Disney film ever made, which, of course, includes The Great Mouse Detective. Last seen (and really liked) by a junior high me, what would a 47 year old version think? Well, let’s dive into this, shall we?\n\nFor those who have never seen The Great Mouse Detective, which I am guessing is most of you, it’s an animal version of Sherlock Holmes, with Basil of Baker Street the title character. It’s apparently based on a series of children’s books, which I’ve never read. Something I found fascinating, and it’s a shame Disney has never done this since (that I am aware of), all the animals live in the same universe as humans, and live a parallel existence. For example, not only does Basil lives within the walls of 221B Baker Street, but the actual Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson live above him. Similarly, in the walls of of Buckingham Palace is a Queen Mouse who is modeled right after Queen Victoria. Here she is:\n\nSo it’s this neat world, where there’s a real Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, a real Queen Victoria, and their mice counterparts, co-existing at the same time. Kind of a parallel universe. They never cross; we never get the real Sherlock Holmes encountering Basil. It’s not like the Looney Tunes or Who Framed Roger Rabbit, where humans interact with anthropomorphic animals. No, despite the fact that most the animals (more on that shortly) in The Great Mouse Detective walk upright and wear contemporary clothing (for 1897), they are size appropriate for their species.\n\nI just found this fascinating; in the dark, dingy London of 1897, there’s a parallel animal experience. It’s in the same London, happening at the same time, and in plain view….just smaller: In addition to Basil’s residence and the Queen Mouse, there’s a dive bar down on the wharves, in pretty much the same place such an establishment would be for the human citizens of London. And this bar on the wharf is filled with the same kind of characters you’d expect…..except they’re all mice.\n\nI can’t remember if I had discovered Conan Doyle before I saw The Great Mouse Detective. I know I first started reading the Holmes stories in junior high. So was The Great Mouse Detective the entry drug, or did I enjoy the movie so much because I already knew Holmes? Impossible to say. But I do know that in the years since, I’ve probably read all the Holmes stories a couple times (My favorite: The Adventure of the Red-Headed League), And what struck me was how clever, at times, The Great Mouse Detective works as a parody of Holmes. Sure, there’s the obvious things: if Basil is Sherlock, then he must have a Dr. Watson. In this case its Dr. Dawson. And in a parody of Holmes’ abilities, Basil is able to deduce Dawson is a doctor who served in Afghanistan, just by the stitch in his coast. And again, this interesting world where just as the real British Raj is going on, with the Brits in Afghanistan, so too are apparently Britain’s mice!\n\nAs anyone who has read Conan Doyle can tell you, Sherlock Holmes can come across as arrogant. And Basil is just that. But this being a Disney film, between Dawson and the cute girl mouse Olivia wearing on him, he learns how boorish his behavior can be. For the viewer, Basil learning to curb his worst habits (thankfully, no cocaine usage, unlike Sherlock Holmes!) provides some of the funnier moments. When Basil agrees to take the case to find Olivia’s kidnapped Father, he insists that there is no way she will be part of the mission. The film then cuts to Olivia clearly in tow with Basil and Dawson as they go to recruit Toby, the bloodhound with the keen scent.\n\nSo much we know of Sherlock Holmes, we find in Basil. Arrogant: check. Confirmed bachelor: check. Plays the violin at a high level: check. Seen in the famous cap: what do you think? Master of disguise: well…..sort of. He and Dawson go undercover to check the dockside bar. But after their capture, archenemy Prof. Ratigan (more on him shortly!) mocks Basil’s disguise for what it was…a taped on mustache. I don’t recall any criminal exposing Holmes so easily!\n\nThe silliness of Basil’s discuses is what The Great Mouse Detective does best; it’s a parody of Conan Doyle. Sherlock Holmes’ deductive ability always stretches credulity and The Great Mouse Detective takes that idea and RUNS WITH IT. Because The Great Mouse Detective is already unbelievable to begin with (hello, talking, clothes-wearing mice!), Basil’s analytical skills knows NO bounds. We first get him being able to decipher, just from the texture of a sheet paper, where Professor Ratigan’s lair is. But that doesn’t even compare to when Basil and Dawson find themselves trapped in a mousetrap on steroid, Ratigan’s Bond villain-esque device for bringing their demise. Here’s the scene. It’s preposterous, it’s Conan Doyle to the extreme….and it’s a delight! Sherlock’s abilities were already stretching belief….why not use animated mice to point out how absurd they can be….and have some fun with it?\n\nMost popular continuations/versions of Sherlock Holmes have as a villain, the “Napoleon of Crime”, Professor Moriarty. He may have only appeared in, I think, two Sherlock Holmes stories (The Final Problem and The Valley of Fear) but the notion of a super villain as intellectually gifted as Holmes has long fascinated those who adapt Conan Doyle. The Great Mouse Detective is no different, and in this case, it’s Moriarty is the most memorable character in the entire film. One of the true shames about The Great Mouse Detective lack of renown is that it’s heavy is absent from the pantheon of Disney’s greatest villains. I am speaking of this odious fellow, one so diabolical he gets his own musical number to extoll his evilness, Professor Ratigan.\n\nThe Great Mouse Detective does not feature any famous names for voices….except for one. That would be the legendary Vincent Price, whose silky voice is the perfect match for Ratigan. Price clearly put his all into the work; he goes from arrogance to fury on the flip of a coin. And Prof. Ratigan is such a great character to work with! His name is part of the joke. Despite being MUCH larger than all of the mice, despite having a ratlike tail and other rat features, he insists he’s a mouse (“A very big mouse” one of his cronies adds). So insistent is Ratigan upon being known as a mouse, in one of the film’s most dark moments, he has a henchman eaten alive for drunkenly calling him a rat. But that’s what makes The Great Mouse Detective work for me….what could be a really grim moment just comes across as absurd. Ratigan’s method of execution: a gigantic cat with a bow upon her head, entitled Felicia. I also recently watched another animated film from my childhood, The Secret on NIMH. The household cat in that one is absolutely terrifying, Dragon. We hear that Dragon kills mice, including the protagonist’s husband. But we never see it happen. In The Great Mouse Detective, we actually see Felicia eat a mouse! But because Felicia is so ridiculous, the execution of the drunken henchman isn’t scary….it’s just part of the merriment. Here’s the scene. Composer Henry Mancini (more on that GENIUS shortly!) played a HUGE part in making this sequence work by having Ratigan’s song not be dreary or scary; it’s a bright, cheery anthem. A villain celebrating being a villain. The only thing I can think of to compare it to is the Gaston song in Beauty in the Beast. But that number was just extolling how great Gaston is. Ratigan’s song does the same….but the extolling is a cataloguing of dastardly deeds.\n\nThis anchoring the darkness in ridiculousness is what I think makes The Great Mouse Detective work. Ratigan is a wonderful character but never really scary, even though we see him execute one of his own. It has nothing like the impact of Judge Doom dipping the toon shoe in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Another similarity to Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the stage show at the dockside bar in The Great Mouse Detective. And before I get to that, I have to point out, there’s all kinds of drinking going on in this establishment. Disney in 1986 did not shy away from showing cartoon mice engaging in alcohol and tobacco. This is a tough bar, and the poor stage acts are frequently getting objects thrown at them. That all changes with a sultry performance from, at first, a meekishly dressed female mouse. But by the time our performer has gotten to the second verse of her Henry Mancini original, she’s gone from bookish to voluptuous, long legged, and not afraid to show it….and still a mouse! Jessica Rabbit, in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, was an animated woman…..obviously not realistic, but still supposedly a human. But this chanteuse, who the Disney animators gave a full figure is still a mouse!\n\nWe never find out anything about this character, and I’ll mention later how I think the screenwriters missed out there. But again, it’s part of this unique universe The Great Mouse Detective exists in; all the trappings of the underworld of 1897 London, but populated by mice, and happening in the same place and time of the real, human world. And in case you’ve never seen it, here’s the entire number.\n\nSo what else works about The Great Mouse Detective? I’ve mentioned it being a really effective parody of Conan Doyle; I’ve mentioned the fascinating concept of an animal world parallel and in the same time as the human one; and I’ve mentioned the great characters of Basil and Prof. Ratigan. I mentioned how Vincent Price was the only big name talent to provide a voice to characters. That’s not entirely true. The other MAJOR voice involved was composer Henry Mancini. For those not familiar with Henry Mancini, here’s his bio. 4 Academy Awards, 20 Grammys. We’re talking the guy who wrote The Pink Panther, Baby Elephant Walk, Peter Gunn, Moon River. In others words….an absolute LEGEND. I have to think Mancini was the biggest name composer to write for a Disney film to that point. I put that in bold, so don’t come at me with Phil Collins, Elton John, Hans Zimmer, etc. John Williams never wrote for Disney. Nor did Bernard Herrmann, Alfred Newman, Miklos Rozsa or any from the Hollywood Golden Era. The closest would probably be John Barry (see my blog about Octopussy to appreciate how brilliant that guy was!) composing the score for Disney’s The Black Hole. The point is, Henry Mancini was a giant of Hollywood composing who had never written for animation before, let alone worked for Disney, before.\n\nBut if you thought Henry Mancini would have viewed a Disney cartoon as a lesser assignment, you would be WRONG. I’ve already spoken about his two great songs, The World’s Greatest Criminal Mind and Let Me Be Good to You. There’s even a third, Goodbye So Soon which is even more ridiculous. Most villains monologue before executing their enemy. See any James Bond film. But Prof. Ratigan goes beyond that. He doesn’t just perform a song for the entrapped Basil and Dawson; no, he plays a record he made of himself singing…and the completion of that record triggers the execution. Talk about villainy overdrive! Again….it’s The Great Mouse Detective upping Conan Doyle into the realm of preposterousness, and I love it! But back to Mancini; his main theme is absolutely perfect for the film. It sounds completely at home in 1897; if you told it me was Sir Edward Elgar, I wouldn’t doubt it. It’s perfectly late Romantic and somewhat British sounding. Swashbuckling, full of adventure, triumphant and noble…..the perfect tone for the adventure. Heck, I think it would have worked for the real Holmes! Have a listen. Throughout the film, Mancini’s score adds to the action and suspense. He was one of the greats of Hollywood composers, and kudos to whoever at Disney thought to bring him in. I don’t think he ever did another Disney films, which is a shame….that could’ve been a great partnership!\n\nWhile I consider The Great Mouse Detective quite possibly the most criminally underrated Disney film (especially since it features The World’s Greatest Criminal Mind), it’s not the greatest Disney film. That, in my opinion, is Mary Poppins, and at some point, I’ll write a blog about what a perfect film that one is. Dare I sat practically perfect in every way? The Great Mouse Detective is not a long film, it’s running length being under 90 minutes. That being said, it’s finale confrontation between Basil and Ratigan goes ON! It begins with Ratigan kidnapping Olivia and escaping in his dirigible, pursued by Basil, Dawson and Olivia’s father, Mr. Flavisham, in pursuit in a jury-rigged balloon featuring a re-purposed Union Jack. This is a striking scene, as they chase in the skies over a nighttime London.\n\nThat leads into a very visually exciting duel between Ratigan and Basil inside and on the face of Big Ben. The combat in the clock gears is especially memorable. Also, during this savage combat, Ratigan’s suave ascot tie, cape and waist coat go by the wayside. Instead, we see him snarling on all fours…..in other words, Basil has forced him to become who he really was all along, a rat. It’s very effective……but the fight just keeps going. There are multiple falls off Big Ben before finally, SPOILER ALERT, Ratigan falls, and Basil survives. Now….I am watching this at age 47. Perhaps 13 year old me loved the combat. I just felt, trim just a little bit off that fight scene; the point had already been made. You don’t even need to shorten the film; I have an idea, which I’ll put in the next section about where you could have used that saved time.\n\nSo if that’s why I don’t find The Great Mouse Detective to be a perfect film, though I enjoyed it plenty, I also wanted to consider, why is it so universally underrated, Just why isn’t The Great Mouse Detective considered a Disney classic? So, with your indulgence, here are the reasons I think the film is excluded from the all-time great lists. Drum roll, please!\n\nFirst off, the most obvious: the animation. It’s not bad. The characters are memorably drawn, especially fitting their personality. Take a look:\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with the animation in The Great Mouse Detective; it all works fine to advance the story. But it never, outside of the fight in the gears of Big Ben, really strikes you. You never stop, and are wowed by the image. That would not be the case in the Disney films that followed. Look at this shot from Beauty in the Beast:\n\nJust look at the level of detail. Check out the depth, how you can see the chandeliers looming in front of the wall. Look at how you can tell the room is curved. Or how you can see the starry night through the windows. You can even see the shadows of Belle and Beast, on the floor underneath them. Or think back to the opening scene of The Lion King. And yes, I’m sure you just sang the Circle of Life in your head. The whole sequence of the animals arriving for the presentation….it’s a masterpiece. It took my breath away when I first saw it, and it still continues to amaze me, over 20 years later. There’s nothing like that in The Great Mouse Detective. Check out the backgrounds in the still of the characters. They’re not shoddy; they absolutely work for the course of the story. They’re just not on that level of artistry that you’ll find in the ’90s Disney films…..except for maybe The Emperor’s New Groove. That might be comparable; like The Great Mouse Detective, The Emperor’s New Groove is entirely character-focused, and so the animation is less detailed in the background.\n\nHere is an example from the one visually striking sequence in The Great Mouse Detective. I’ve read this is the first use of CGI by Disney.\n\nAlso, it needs to be mentioned that The Great Mouse Detective actually seems to recycle some Disney animation. Amongst Ratigan’s gang is a green creature, who looks just like Bill, the lizard who is recruited to go down the White Rabbit’s chimney in Alice in Wonderland. Take a look:\n\nAlso, I’m fairly certain the henchmen swinging from the chandeliers in Ratigan’s song is pretty much the same animation as the chandelier swinging in Mr. Toad. Check it out on your own.\n\nAnother reason that The Great Mouse Detective is excluded from the roster of Disney classics comes down to the nature of the story: it’s Holmes vs. Moriarty….err, Basil vs. Ratigan. And with Dr. Watson….err, Dawson along for the ride. Take Olivia Flavisham, the daughter of Mr. Flavisham, the mouse toymaker who has been abducted by Ratigan. Here she is:\n\nCute, isn’t she? The Great Mouse Detective came out in 1986, the same year as the non-Disney animated film, An American Tail. As you may recall, the latter starred Fievel, a cute kid of a mouse. He was the center of attention. But in The Great Mouse Detective, Olivia, as cute as she is, is only a plot device. She’s trying to find her father. Dawson feels sorry for her, and Basil, somewhat, tolerates her. A running joke is that he is so preoccupied, he can never recall her last name. Olivia is sweet, innocent and cute….and only exists to move the plot along. Our focus is on the arrogant and somewhat unlikable Basil, the clumsy Dawson, the vile Ratigan, and his gross looking bat crony, Fidget. Perhaps if Olivia, who seems to have no flaws, was fleshed out more, or had a bigger role, that would raise The Great Mouse Detective‘s stock. As it is, the story focuses on characters who are fun, who you like to watch….but aren’t exactly likable.\n\nAnother usual feature of Disney films, but one completely missing from The Great Mouse Detective, is any kind of romance. Granted, there are no love stories in Conan Doyle, unless you count Watson and the daughter from The Sign of the Four, and, of course, the never-ending speculation of Holmes and Irene Adler from A Scandal in Bohemia. You know, the one where Watson famously narrates, “To Sherlock Holmes, she is always the woman.” But other than that, romance doesn’t show up in Conan Doyle. Nor does it in The Great Mouse Detective. But it could have…and it wouldn’t have taken up any more of the film’s running time. Remember when I said how the ending fight goes on too long? Trim a few minutes off that, and put into the bar scene. Remember that sultry singer?\n\nWe never find anything about her, she sings her song and then is gone. But what if it turns out she and Basil have a history? It doesn’t have to be more than a few minutes. Perhaps, after the song, Basil and Dawson go backstage, to find out what she knows about Ratigan. In return, she slaps Basil for neglecting her, or standing her up? Perhaps she used to also run with Ratigan’s gang? Just some shared history between the two; it would’ve given the singer some depth, and also provided a little more about Basil. It needn’t have been a relationship throughout the rest of the film, just a few lines, one added scene, that would tell us more about just who the Great Mouse Detective is. You look at the Disney films that followed: The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, The Lion King, Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules; they all had a romance as part of the plot. But not The Great Mouse Detective. And I would propose that the lack of it is part of why the film isn’t included as a Disney classic.\n\nSo what then is The Great Mouse Detective, if not a classic? Well, with it’s lack of romance, but its emphasis on zany characters and a dramatic caper of a plot, it actually plays more like a long episode of DuckTales, which took to the air just a year later. Many of the Disney classics like The Lion King or Aladdin are about the characters, with the plot being secondary. But in The Great Mouse Detective, there is a major plot at hand, in which our characters are engaged. It’s not the characters of Basil and Ratigan that drive the movie, it’s Basil trying to stop Ratigan’s plot. Compare that to Aladdin, where Jafar’s plot is basically ancillary to the bigger story of Aladdin and Jasmine. Stopping Jafar is a plot device in Aladdin, the same with Simba dethroning Scar in The Lion King. The real story there was about Simba himself. But The Great Mouse Detective isn’t about Basil; it’s about Basil trying to stop Ratigan. The plot is everything, just like it is in Conan-Doyle.\n\nWhat is The Great Mouse Detective? It’s a very entertaining, fast-moving romp with two memorable leads, dueling against each other, in an absolutely fascinating situation. Mice (and other animals) that dress, walk, talk and act like humans, in a parallel yet simultaneous universe with their human counterparts of 1897. Oh that Disney should revisit that concept! I’ve thought about what other works of fiction could be adapted in the same fashion as The Great Mouse Detective. The one that comes to immediate mind is Jules Verne’s Around the World in 80 Days. That would be a natural; just as the real Phileas Fogg and his servant Passepartout embark on their globe-trot, so too would be animals, acting out the same story at the same time. I that might have potential; anyone got an “in” at Disney, that can pass the word along for me?\n\nBut before I wrap this up, there is one thing about The Great Mouse Detective I don’t get. All the animals are anthropomorphic….except for Felicia the cat and Toby the dog. Those two don’t wear clothes, don’t speak English….and basically never stop being a cat and dog. Why is that? Both are much larger than all the characters. Is that only small animals: mice, lizards, rats, bats get to be human-like in The Great Mouse Detective universe? Anything bigger than that is just an animal? That’s never really explained.\n\nSo what doesThe Great Mouse Detective have going for it? Ratigan’s master plan is to replace the Queen with a mechanical version, which will proclaim him the Supreme Ruler. Why, a robot in 1897, along with a bicycle-powered dirigible? It’s downright steam-punk, years before that was a thing! Great music by a true master, in Henry Mancini. Two great adversaries: the somewhat unlikable but mostly unstoppable Basil, and the absolutely slimy and cunning Prof. Ratigan. And with Ratigan you get the incredible vocal performance of Vincent Price. I know everyone loves Robin Williams as the Genie in Aladdin, but give The Great Mouse Detective a try. Ratigan may not be as manic as the Genie….but he’s still pretty darn memorable. Again, he deserves a spot in the pantheon of great Disney villains.\n\nBut more than all of this, what The Great Mouse Detective has at its core, what it does best (and what I probably missed as a 13 year old) is a very ridiculous, over the top, yet still completely effective spoof of Sherlock Holmes. Especially since we see clearly that Basil is based out of the same 221B Baker Street that Sherlock himself occupies, the joke hits home. Take all the eccentricities and implausibilities of Holmes and blow them up a hundred times, and have it happen directly under his nose. But who would notice when its mice and one rat? Blow up what was sometimes hard to believe in Conan Doyle and make it completely preposterous; you can do that when you have animated animals, It’s satire….and The Great Mouse Detective does it very, very well.\n\nSo let’s review:\n\nRomance: Nope.\n\nCatchy pop tunes that kids love to sing: Nope….though Henry Mancini’s tunes are REALLY good. The Ratigan song wouldn’t be out of place in a Gilbert and Sullivan show, which would be that time period. Still, there’s no Can You Feel the Love Tonight or Under the Sea in the score.\n\nJaw-dropping animated visuals: Not really.\n\nWarm, likable characters, such as Jasmine or Belle: Nope. Olivia is the only one that comes close, and she’s almost a minor character.\n\nGreat leading characters, who, while not likable, are PERFECT opposite each other: ABSOLUTELY.\n\nClever satire of a literary classic: BINGO"
