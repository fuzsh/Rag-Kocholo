Really.\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/tiamat61185/site/basilsketch.txt\n\nBasil from The Great Mouse Detective. I used to love that movie Haven't seen it in ages though. The pose for this drawing was referenced off an image I printed from the internet (just so I can get his design down). Once I get this drawing finished, I'll go draw him in an original pose.\n\nAnd, to prove I don't just draw fanart all the time...\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/tiamat61185/site/logodesign1.txt\n\nJust an assignment for one of my design classes. Draw and color some logos depicting emotions.

The Great Mouse Dectective is a great movie.
