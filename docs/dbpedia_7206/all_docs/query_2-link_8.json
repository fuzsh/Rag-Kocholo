        "text": "Most people know this series because of the Disney movie The Great Mouse Detective, but the movie was very different from the books.\n\nThe series, written by Eve Titus, features a mouse named Basil who lives in the home of Sherlock Holmes and studies his methods, becoming a detective who solves problems for his fellow mice. Like the original Sherlock Holmes stories, Basil’s cases are narrated by his best friend, another mouse named Dr. David Q. Dawson, who accompanies Basil on his investigations. Some aspects of Basil’s cases resemble details from Sherlock Holmes stories, and there are frequent jokes on Sherlock Holmes characters in the character names.\n\nSome of the books are really more adventure than mystery, and in my opinion, those parts of the series aren’t as good. For those who have never tried these books, I think the best book in the series is really the first one. It has a better mystery theme than the others, and later entries in the series also become a bit disjointed and episodic.\n\nIn one of the books, they mention that Basil’s cousin is Anatole, another mouse in another series by the same author.\n\nBooks in the Series:\n\nBasil of Baker Street (1958)\n\nThe first book in the series, which introduces Basil and Dawson and explains how they came to make their home at 221B Baker Street. The mystery involves a set of kidnapped twins.\n\nBasil and the Lost Colony (1964)\n\nBasil helps to unravel an historical mystery, tracking down a lost colony of mice in the Alps.\n\nBasil and the Pygmy Cats (1971)\n\nBasil’s arch enemy, Professor Ratigan, has taken over the Asian country of Bengistan, near India. Basil journeys there to rescue the rightful ruler and also undertakes a mission to locate a mythical species of mouse-sized cats.\n\nBasil in Mexico\n\nBasil in the Wild West (1990)\n\nAfter leaving Mexico, Basil and his best friend Dr. Dawson journey north into the western territories of the United States. There, they investigate smuggled antiquities from Mexico and a strange, glowing Thing haunting a hotel.\n\nThe purpose of this site is to discuss/reminisce about old children's books. If you're looking for the title of a book that you half-remember, I have a list of Resources above that will help you. If you're looking for the old list, those links are still there, but I've added more in the expanded list.\n\nYou might also check out the Book Lists section which has lists of books on specific topics and themes along with some additional resources on those topics.\n\nEvery book on this site, whether it's in a series or not, is listed under the Books by Decade section.\n\nI also have another book blog that used to contain some children's books but which I have now repurposed:\n\nJestress's Bookshelf\n\nThere isn't much content yet, but there will be more soon! I have quite a lot of unusual books on various subjects, and I have decided to use Jestress's Bookshelf for the more adult books. Updates will be made as I sort through my book collection."
