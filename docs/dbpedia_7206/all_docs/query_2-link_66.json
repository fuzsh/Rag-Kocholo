That the paper is of native Mongolian manufacture, no watermark, and has been gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a bat who has been drinking Rodents Delight. The cheap brand is sold only at the seamiest of pub spots.\n\nBasil is a small stuffed toy given to Holmes by Jack. A plushie complete with deerstalker, magnifying glass, and manic grin, Basil is supposed to be a mouse who lived in the walls of 221-B Baker Street and learned Sherlock Holmes' deductive methods. Holmes was amused.\n\nBasil is: Cute and cuddly.\n\nBasil likes: Seishi\n\nBasil's Survey Results\n\nHolmes: As my vanity is unfortunately an open (although exaggerated, I insist!) book in this world, I do not feel any shame in admitting I enjoy the various pastiches and fancies based upon Mr. Doyle's (unavoidably?) inaccurate recounting of my early life. Basil's movie is excellent, although I confess I find more worry in the depiction of Moriarty/Rattigan than I do joy in Basil and Dr. Dawson. The rest I can laugh at - but even the thought of Moriarty makes me solemn and distant."
