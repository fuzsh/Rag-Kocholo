        "text": "Basil of Baker Street, also known as Mr. Basil, is a male sentient mouse.\n\nDescription[]\n\nBasil lives under the apartment of human detective Sherlock Holmes, from whom he has picked up tricks and mannerisms. Like his human \"neighbour\", Basil is the most famous detective of his society, astoundingly clever and very knowledgeable in chemistry.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nBasil is, like his arch-nemesis Ratigan, extremely intelligent and knowledgeable. He is solitary and somewhat grumpy, as well as highly megalomaniacal, but is nonetheless firmly on the good side; much of his hermit-like persona seems constructed, and bits of unrestrained selflessness sometimes shine through (such as his initial shock when learning that Olivia Flaversham was partly an orphan).\n\nBasil comes off as a jack-of-all-trades at several points in the movie, showing skill in areas such as science, math, history, and disguise (though his disguise inevitably fails), not to mention being physically capable (this is emphasized in the film's climax in the Big Ben Tower).\n\nDespite this, Basil can also be prickly and self-centered, ignoring Olivia and Dawson at the beginning of the movie, and only offering to help them once he realizes Olivia's case might be the solution to finally capturing Ratigan. Though Basil is always calm and collected during his hunt, he can also be very emotional and operatic, becoming very moody if things do not go his way or if the situation looks dire, such as at the beginning of the movie and when he is nearly defeated by Ratigan. Despite his indifferent attitude towards Dawson and Olivia at the start of the movie, he can be quite affectionate and empathetic, as shown when he tries to cheer up the former after losing Fidget in the Toy Store, and when he chooses to save Olivia from being crushed to death in the gears of Big Ben after Ratigan kicks her off the platform he was standing on before getting her to safety to protect her from the criminal mastermind, showing that he had also come to care for her as a friend. As Olivia is bidding him goodbye near the end of the movie before she leaves, he affectionately teases her by mispronouncing her surname, causing Dawson to chuckle, with the trio silently admitting that it has become an inside joke with them. After the door closes behind Olivia, Basil clearly already misses her, admitting that she is 'not such a bad girl', his actions that he had come to value her companionship, as well as Dawson's.\n\nPhysical Description[]\n\nBasil is a slender mouse with a long muzzle and light brown fur all over his body; he has a very thin black tail. Unlike real-life mice, he has no whiskers, fur-covered hands, and feet, but retains the buck teeth.\n\nBasil's common outfit he wears through-out much of the film is a basic white dress shirt with a high collar, a red-brown waist-coat, a bottle-green neck-tie, grayish-brown pants, and black shoes with white spats. When he is residing in his flat when there are not yet any crimes to solve, he wears a dark magenta bathrobe with midnight purple accents.\n\nWhen he does roam around London solving crimes and what he wears for most of the film is a chocolate-brown jacket, which he wears under a dark-honey brown inverness (a type of jacket with a short cape-like garment covering the upper arms) and a matching deer-stalker cap, adding to his trademark earthy-colored outfit.\n\nBackstory[]\n\nCanon[]\n\nBasil has had a long career in the investigation business, becoming extremely famous, especially for finding abducted people. Most of his work seems to have aimed toward arresting Professor Padraic Ratigan, until the events of 1897, when, in spite of the rat's escape, Basil still mostly won over Ratigan and began to investigate non-Ratigan-related cases.\n\nThe Professor's Portrait[]\n\nAccording to the unofficial short story, Basil lived with his parents until the age of ten. During his early years, he had begun to develop a liking for readings and, oddly, preferred academic books to fiction. He spent most of his time in the school library, solitarily studying, and rarely if ever socialized with the other children, whom he quickly found boring, with the exception of a girl named Esther. When he turned ten, he was sent to a boarding school, where he did extremely well even though he didn't study much, thanks to his innate talents, but was often mocked.\n\nThree years later, when a girl had her diary stolen, and that an obviously innocent classmate of hers was framed for the theft, Basil took it upon himself to right the wrong, as much for justice's sake as to prove himself he could solve a criminal case; he uncovered the real culprit, solving his first case. That same year, he took an interest in chemistry, becoming extremely talented; his skill was noticed by his teacher, who advised him to pursue a career as a chemist, and therefore studied the subject at Rodent Oxford.\n\nDuring his second semester there, he met chemistry teacher Professor Padraic Ratigan, who quickly became his only friend and his mentor. Recognizing Basil's intelligence, Ratigan offered him a position as his lab assistant. This unfortunately led to Basil discovering notes, made by Ratigan about a dreadful project of his to drug the whole city of London into stupidity to be able to rule over them. Basil confronted his teacher, who quickly revealed his true colors, and offered Basil to become his partner in crime, arguing that he was just as much of an outcast as he was, and that them both, only, because of their intelligence, deserved to rule. Basil immediately refused and denounced Ratigan, who thanks to the ludicrous scale of the plan, was able to connivingly plead madness, and quickly escaped the asylum where he'd been placed, sending Basil a telegram that notified him that their game wasn't over. Basil abandoned his studies and became a private detective, spending most of his time investigating cases related to Ratigan's hidden actions.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn the German version, he was voiced by Harry Wüstenhagen, the German voice of Sherlock Holmes in five films.\n\nIt was actually originally intended for iconic British actor John Cleese to do the voice of Basil but turned down the role since he was cast in the non-Disney live-action film A Fish Called Wanda, which was released in 1988.\n\nThe way Basil stands up straight with his fist clenched to Ratigan is the same position Roger stood up to Cruella De Vil in One Hundred and One Dalmatians.\n\nHe's named after Basil Rathbone, the actor who portrayed Sherlock Holmes numerous times.\n\nMerchandise depicts him with a plaid green coat and purple necktie, but in the actual movie, his coat is solid brown and his necktie is bottle-green."
