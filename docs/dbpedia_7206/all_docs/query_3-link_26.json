        "text": "Post by Basil on\n\n~~~Welcome to Disney Uncut!~~~\n\n~~~You Ain't Never Had a Friend Like Me~~~\n\nCharacter Image\n\n(There's always a chance, Doctor, as long as one can think.)\n\nCharacter Name\n\n(Basil of Baker street)\n\nMovie Character Appears In\n\nThe Great Mouse Detective\n\n~~~Who I am Inside~~~\n\nWhat is your character's history? Are they a hero, or a villain, a sidekick or guardian? What has happened to them in their lives to make them the way they are today?\n\nBasil’s parents met on the shoreline of Bristol at Drift Gillnet, a salmon fishing bay. They immediately fell in love and on May 16, 1864 his parents moved into the small countryside of Surrey. His mother was named Audrey Maxine and his father Amery Hawthorne. They married that same year on June 21st, 1864. He had built a cottage for Audrey once the news of her pregnancy was announced to her royal family. They found distaste of her marrying a fisherman and so she pressed on never mentioning her family name again.\n\nOn November 16th 1869, their eldest son Baker Hawthorn was born, he was a premature birth but nothing was wrong with him at the time. He took features of his mother. On April 4, 1871 Basil Hawthorn was born. After he was born Amery moved the family to London to open up his own fish market.\n\nIn August of 1874 their son Bayen was born. As was his twin Brooke, Basil’s first sister. Even when they had four children, Basil stood out at age 3 already reading at a high school level. He was sent to pre-school and he quickly went to kindergarten in less than 2 years. Baker had increasingly grown jealous struggling in kindergarten.\n\nIn July 1 1884, Basil had excelled numerous expectations in middle school and Bayen had shown similar traits but did not succeed as highly. Baker’s jealousy grew into anger and frequently would blackout and go into a rampant rage, usually going after Basil because he would protect his other siblings. He had also run into Ratigan on the first day of 8th grade becoming close friends. He also learned how to play the Violin in 8th grade.\n\nOn May 10 1889, Basil was accepted into Harvard College after graduating high school with straight As and Bayen was also accepted along with his twin. His friendship with Ratigan grew sour when their lives took a quick turn for the better or worse. Baker’s anger separated him with the family and was never heard from again. He was one day discovered by Basil as leader of a Russian mafia and the family had hid their last name forever. He had found out that Ratigan turned Baker away from the family and hatred toward both was there forever. Around the same time he met a teacher known as Professor Abbott Milburn, getting close to him. He found out later that he was in fact a detective in the secret services. That inspired him to become a detective himself. That is also when he picked up the habit of pipe smoking.\n\nIn March 6, 1895, he moved out of his lovely home in London and found a nice flat on 221 B Baker Street. Where he had met his equivalent Sherlock Holmes and he quickly more on detective work studying his actions. In that same year he graduated Harvard and started his own solo detective work. A year later he found Ms.Hudson in the daily newspaper having dire need of a housekeeper.\n\nIn November 7, 1897 His first big case was pursued meeting Olivia flaversham and Dr. David Q. Dawson on the pursuit of his arch nemesis professor Ratigan.\n\nDescribe your character's personality. What are their strengths and weaknesses, what are their passions? What qualities do they have that are good or bad?\n\nA kind British gentlemen and his profession is detective. He uses the power of deduction for his cases and to marvel others. He tends to be dramatic and over the top. He is always looking for a mystery. He sometimes shows episodes of depression particularly when he fails at anything. Dark moods would occur that would last days until he finds something of interest.\n\nHe has a rather large ego. He is a genius and sometimes when on his own schedule he can be rude to someone without knowing it. He is apologetic when it’s acknowledged otherwise it is ignored completely. He loves to give advice to others and sees himself as a leader.\n\nWhen He plays the Violin He shows his emotions, although from time to time he tries to hide them. He fails at it miserably. He also tries his best to help people but only through work otherwise he ignores any other sort of help. He sees pipe smoking as a muse of relaxation when his mind has become increasingly spastic or if he needs to think more carefully.\n\nLIKES:\n\nMysteries\n\nPuzzles and Ciphers\n\nCheese\n\nTea\n\nDarts\n\nChess\n\nScience, especially Chemistry\n\nBooks\n\nOlivia\n\nDr.David Q. Dawson\n\nToby\n\nDISLIKES:\n\nCrime and criminals (ESPECIALLY Ratigan)\n\nCats\n\nChildren\n\nBaker\n\nFidget\n\n~~~That's How You Know~~~\n\nGive us a small sample of how you will play your character. Please don't copy a scene from their movie, and give us at least three paragraphs.\n\nBasil had been dropped off by horse carriage to the north side of London. Or so he thought. It was a new place he had never seen before. It was odd and there were so many different numbers of people in one place. He was being pushed around like a pin ball machine. “Ruffians.” He thought angrily. He shook his head finally being stopped in front of the city’s welcome sign.\n\nHe had checked his map and had realized somehow he took a wrong turn. “Oh buggar…” He sighed now lost and knowing he had a case on his hands. Right now unfortunately there was nothing he could do to help the poor souls. He tried not to let his depression overcome him only knowing it would slow him down. The case was due to a victim that was about to be prosecuted for something he didn’t do and he had evidence.\n\nHe had to some how get there before sundown and the sky was already getting bleak. The sky ahead was becoming red over the dark clouds and the victim was going to be hung once the sun went down. His one mistake could cost an innocent his life if he didn’t quicken his pace. He had to hurry for a storm was brewing and the redness in the sky ahead told him \"sunset\". He refused to let Ratigan win again…\n\n~~~You and Me Together We'll Be~~~\n\nWhy this character? What draws you to them, what makes you want to play them? Do you have anything in common with them?\n\nI chose him because he is most like me. I like to play him because I can actually be the detective and is able to help people. everyone who know the character says I am like him.I'm smart reserved,witty and just love a good adventure.\n\nWhat would you like your custom title to be? This can be anything you like in reference to your character and will appear under your name.\n\nDetecive please naturally to the character's relavence.\n\nWho else do you play here?\n\nNoone yet but do you acept fox movies??\n\n~~~A Star is Born~~~\n\n(Newbies Only)\n\nTell us a little bit about yourself.\n\nI love to write,draw and read. I am in college for fine arts and I also love science.\n\nHow did you find us?\n\nA little birdy in Butterflyandsamurai proboards.\n\nWhat do you think of the site so far?\n\nI love it I just hope you all will keep up with demand and I will do the same."
