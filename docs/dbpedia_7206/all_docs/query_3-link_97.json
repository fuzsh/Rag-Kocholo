Basil targets the enemy with the least HP with each dart, dealing 180k + 1.4bd damage to each enemy and studying them for 7 seconds.\n\nClever Concoction\n\nBasil throws an Erlenmeyer flask at the farthest studied enemy, dealing 850k+9sp damage over 10 seconds to enemies in an area.\n\nGood Deduction\n\nEvery 8 seconds, Basil dodges an enemy's basic attack or skill and counters by studying the attacker for 12 seconds.\n\nThe study has a chance to fail against enemies above level <level>.\n\nCloser Inspection\n\nIf an enemy Tank Hero attempts to apply a Study to Basil or one of his allies, the Study is prevented and Basil Studies the enemy for 10 seconds instead.\n\nBasil gains 45 Energy whenever an enemy is Studied. He gains an additional 155 Energy if the Studied enemy is a Tank Hero.\n\nThe Energy gained is less effective against enemies above Level <level>.\n\nWise Observation\n\nBasil removes 300 energy when he damages a studied enemy with \"On The Mark.\"\n\nEvery 3 basic attacks, Basil applies a damage over time to an enemy that deals 790k + 8.85sp over 12 seconds.\n\nThe amount of energy removed is less effective against enemies above level <level>.\n\nAdditional Stat Boosts:"
