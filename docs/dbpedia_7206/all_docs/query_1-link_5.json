        "text": "Basil the Great Mouse Detective\n\nDirectors: Ron Clements, Burny Mattinson, Dave Michener and John Musker\n\nYear: 1986\n\nBefore I begin, let me just stress in the UK the title was the above, in America it was just “The Great Mouse Detective”, because apparently “Basil” sounded too British! But since I am British it feels like treason to change the title; however the second part will have the American title…because I like to have balance.\n\nBased on the children’s book series “Basil of Baker Street” by Eve Titus, we open up in London in 1876, and we see the city surrounded by fog…the idea that London is permanently surrounded by fog is a stereotype, but it does bring some suspense to this scene, so let’s go with it.\n\nZooming in on Flaversham Toyshop, we see that is this a world of anthropomorphic mice, and little Olivia is celebrating her birthday, which since it’s so late at night, and she’s only getting her present now so perhaps they went to London Zoo during the day or something. Olivia’s age is never mentioned, but I’m putting her at about eight years old.\n\nShe mentions that this is the best birthday ever, as she’s given a little robotic mouse doll thing and is so happy when ominously there is a bang on the door. In fear her father Hiram, (even though it easily could have been a drunk) practically throws Olivia in into a cupboard as a Bat breaks in and proceeds to beat the crap out of him.\n\nThis is all done from Olivia’s point of view, and even though she doesn’t see much…we hear everything. This is a unique opening and Happy Birthday Olivia!\n\nAs we get to the title of “The Great Mouse Detective” and the credits, and Vincent Price gets top billing over Barrie Ingham, who plays Basil…which isn’t cool at all. I know it’s Vincent Price, but Basil is the lead, the film is about him.\n\nWe now not to some exposition provided by David. Q Dawson our Watson expy in which he explains that he’s back from Afghanistan and trying to find a room to rent, so this is a world where humans live alongside anthropomorphic animals , but are never focused on, or are only in silhouette.\n\nThis works, because Basil is Sherlock Holmes, he lives at 221 Baker Street, he plays the violin and it’s a way of accepting the world presented.\n\nDawson comes across Olivia crying in a human boot as she’s lost and trying to find “Basil of Baker Street”. I know I normally get to the voice casting later, but since Olivia is Scottish and voiced by an actual Scot, it’s most likely she’s new in London and just doesn’t know where Baker Street is.\n\nIn between her hysterics and the newspaper clipping Olivia has since Dawson has no idea who Basil is, but since he knows where Baker Street is. He decides to take her. This is a great establishing character moment for Dawson, he is kind, considerate and even though he only met Olivia a minute earlier knows that she needs his help. Finding their way to the famous 221½ Baker Street address, where we see the real Sherlock Holmes voiced by Basil Rathbone one of the most famous actors to ever play Sherlock, even though Watson is played by Laurie Main and not Nigel Bruce from the series of films. But let’s gets back to Basil shall we.\n\nAt the famous address, they are welcomed in by Mrs. Judson, who takes one look at poor Olivia, and automatically leads me to think that if this Olivia’s father is killed she would adopt her in a heartbeat, as she mentions getting the girl some tea…ah tea how British and all.\n\nNaturally being an expy of Holmes the room is filled with experiments, concoctions and all manner of goodies, as Fu Manchu walks in brandishing a gun!\n\nDawson pretty much craps himself, as Basil whips the costume off doing his big reveal, as the “Great Mouse Detective”, does his “Basil scan” on Dawson, giving him his life story before giving him a bunch of pillows to hold…then aiming said gun…at Dawson. As an introduction, this is pretty epic, as Dawson in a second throws the pillows on a chair, dives in to protect Olivia as the room is soon filled with feathers, Mrs. Judson is pissed whilst Basil searches for the bullet, which is now in Olivia’s possession.\n\nImmediately Basil sees Olivia as an annoyance, just because of her presence as we get as look as Victorian forensics under a microscope, but because Basil didn’t get the result he wanted, he immediately has a type of heroic breakdown, and staggers off to a chair, to play his violin in a depressing fashion, like a sodding drama queen.\n\nOk, I know he just could have done some heroin like the guy living upstairs! But this is one of the moments you just want to slap Basil round the face and tell him to “Snap the fuck out of it!”\n\nThis could have gone on forever, until Olivia decides to tell the depressed Detective everything, which leads to an awkward moment that Olivia confesses that she hasn’t got a mother…Aww poor thing.\n\nBasil really doesn’t care, well until Olivia mentions the peg-legged bat, which immediately causes Basil to snap out of his shit fest, and become all dramatic, for some reason the light from the fire grows brighter, shadows on the wall are more enhanced as Basil now gleefully explains that the bat, who now gains a name, which is Fidget is an associate of Basil’s very own Moriarty, Professor Ratigan..and Basil has his painting on his wall.\n\nWe now cut to the sewers and to Ratigan’s lair where we see Hiram Flaversham using his mechanical skills to build a robot of something, until the Toymaker decides to use tea, (ah, British) to destroy his own creation and we finally meet Ratigan.\n\nGood old Vincent Price, he’s so having fun with this, as he berates Flaversham for destroying the machine and I give Flaversham some dues for answering back and almost taking no shit from the Rat, (He pretends he’s a mouse but he’s a Rat), which must be a Scottish thing!\n\nBut Ratigan’s trick up his sleeve is to produce the doll he made for Olivia and pretty much threaten her with death of the daddy doesn’t comply…and then destroys the doll, ok we get it.\n\nRatigan decides to leave the inventor to complete his task from scratch, laughing at his own evilness before giving Fidget a list to complete comprising of “Tool, gears, girl and uniforms”. Before the Rat disappears into his lair, where his mouse minions and Bill the Lizard from Alice in Wonderland (nice cameo) fight over who will light his cigarette.\n\nHis lair, it needs to be said is very feminine, lots of reds and pinks and he drinks champagne and nothing else…ok then. He also has a voodoo doll of Basil on his shelf, with pins stuck into it…he must have made it himself.\n\nRatigan announces his plan to dispose of the Queen Mousetoria and become head of all Mousingdom and he launches into his villain song, and as villain songs go, it’s a brilliant one.\n\nJust enjoy and try not to feel sorry for the mouse that is Bartholomew, because it’s not cool to call the villain a Rat…to his face.\n\nAs we watch his cat Felicia eat idiot Bartholomew, as Ratigan tells his minions to finish his little number. Also, Felicia is huge, how many minions has Ratigan gone through?\n\nThe funny thing is about poor fucker Bartholomew, is that Ratigan is fixated on killing Basil, he actually does in this scene since Bartholomew is voiced by Basil’s voice artist Barrie Ingham. It does nothing to the plot, but it’s just a funny moment if you know that…or you’re a voice chaser.\n\nAnd speaking of voices, this is the first moment Frank Welker, the “voice acting God” works in a Disney film, all hail him!\n\nWe go back now to Baker Street where Basil smokes a pipe, good smoking whilst Ratigan smokes like Cruella De Vil, aka Villain smoking.\n\nWhilst Olivia has finally finished telling Basil what has happened when suddenly Fidget drops into view having tracked the girl there somehow, almost causing the poor girl to wet her knickers.\n\nAs Basil dashes outside to fight the fiend, but only finds tracks and the bat’s hat, Basil once again mispronounces Olivia’s name, as he doesn’t give a shit as Basil pulls his coat out of a clock chest (because he’s a genius) and decides to fetch Toby, because this game is afoot!\n\nBasil pretty much demands that Dawson go with him, and of course the surgeon is delighted to do so, but of course Olivia wants to go too.\n\nBasil seeing sense states “no”, and sadly his violin is killed in this scene as they go upstairs to the actual Sherlock Holmes deep in discussion with Watson, in a reused idea of how to get around from Cinderella, and it turns out that Olivia is going with them…how did she manage to do that I still can’t figure out.\n\nAs we meet Toby, who is the dog of Sherlock Holmes and is also voiced by Frank Welker…all hail, and seems to respond better to Olivia’s voice then Basil. Ok, if that is the reason she’s joining them, well Olivia may be cute, but Basil and Toby have history.\n\nAs the four of them venture into London, we now cut to Fidget in a human toyshop getting all the things Ratigan asked for, well apart from the “girl” but she’s just about to pretty much drop into his lap as Basil and Company track Fidget to the Toyshop and immediately enter.\n\nBasil is still not happy at Olivia’s presence, but he is not a child hater. He has been doing this for a while, and knows how dangerous it can be, Dawson and Olivia are both ignorant of the danger, which is strange for a guy whose been in the army, and a little girl who on the same day saw her father beaten and kidnapped. But here they are all together as they begin to search through the Toyshop. And fun thing to note is that Basil instructs Olivia not to speak, and she doesn’t say a word for the next few minutes.\n\nBasil uses his skills to be as stealthy as possible, even though the silent Olivia decides to turn on a music box…ok why? As Basil finds the stripped toy soldiers and missing gears, whilst Dawson finds the list that Fidget has dropped.\n\nFidget sets off toys as a distraction, and manages to kidnap Olivia and stuffs her in a sack, as minions go he’s a pretty good one, you at least have to give kudos for that.\n\nIn the chaos, which shows how dangerous the human world can be to the mice, and especially to Basil, because this scene though well-paced and animated doesn’t change the fact that he’s still a mouse? And buy the DVD for this scene, alone because it’s that good.\n\nFidget gets away with the girl, and everything he went out for, and Basil is pissed, very pissed and not because he lost Fidget, who was perhaps the only one who could lead him to his nemesis, but because Olivia was stolen, naturally since he did instruct Dawson to keep an eye on her, so he takes it out on the hapless Assistant, who is also devastated and appears to have a breakdown very similar to Basil’s, but this time it’s Basil who is the one who apologises and they make a promise to find the girl….aww Basil you do care.\n\nWhilst the mice make their way to Baker Street to figure out their next move, we cut back to the sewers and daddy and daughter are reunited, and it’s really over the top and sentimental Disney as Ratigan finds out that Fidget has lost the list and Basil is on the case. Naturally this changes everything since Ratigan never thought Basil would have got involved, but Olivia found him…what are the odds?\n\nRatigan decides to feed Fidget to the cat, just because all those years of loyal service, damaging his wing so he cannot fly, losing his leg and he screws up just once…what a bastard.\n\nHowever, he changes his mind when it dawns on him that if Basil is on the case, then he can set a trap for him…I kind of give Ratigan his dues since he’s taking over the Empire and killing his nemesis in no more than a day at least. Say what you want, but the guy can multi-task.\n\nOk, as this film is going into the second act, and I’ve hit the word count so this is now an ongoing critique, how I feel about it, naturally I’ll get to the end but so far I have only one issue about this film.\n\nRatigan has decided to take over the Empire, he has money at his disposal, he has minions and for some reason he waits until no more than 48 hours before the Queens Jubilee to build the whatever…ok were there mice before him who just screwed up the job, and wound up in Felicia, or did he just wake up in the wee hours and think “Robot Queen”. Next up, a strip show in a Disney film and The House of Mouse finally show what CGI is capable of."
