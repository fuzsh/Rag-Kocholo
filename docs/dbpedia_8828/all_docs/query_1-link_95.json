        "text": "While Hollywood’s call to action to address sexual misconduct head on has resulted in the ousting of heavyweights like Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Brett Ratner, there’s one high-profile director who has gotten off scot-free: Woody Allen.\n\nThe writer and filmmaker, who has won multiple awards—including several Oscars and the Cecil B. DeMille Award that Oprah Winfrey was honoured with at the 2018 Golden Globes—has been accused by his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, of sexually molesting her in 1992, when she was just seven.\n\nFarrow’s journalist brother, Ronan Farrow, has also worked tirelessly over the past few years to expose Allen, and also wrote some brilliant pieces about Weinstein. Both have used their public profiles to ask why Allen has been exempt from the consequences others have faced, even aiming their questions directly at actors who have continued to work with him. (Allen has constantly denied the allegations.)\n\nThe conversation has been sparked once again with the release of HBO’s documentary Allen V. Farrow which deep dives into the allegations. The show began airing recently in Australia and includes never-before-seen home videos and accounts from family, friends and employees of the household.\n\nIt’s a subject Allen’s collaborators haven’t known how to respond to. Stars including Scarlett Johansson, Blake Lively and Selena Gomez have either side-stepped the question or given vague answers when asked, and instead talk about the craft.\n\nIt’s not enough for Farrow, who tweeted, “I know that standing with me against Woody Allen is not easy in this industry. I know that I am asking for courage and even sacrifice. But if #TIMESUP truly stands with all victims, as it says it does, then that sacrifice is necessary to help convert this moment to a movement. To those who have already taken a stand and amplified my voice with theirs, there is a 7 year old girl inside of me who thanks you from the bottom of her heart.”"
