        "text": "He’s made a movie a year for decades—and we can’t hide our broadest smiles when Woody Allen’s white credits pop up on a black screen and the jazz music kicks in. As for the romantic movies, dramas and comedies that follow? We’ve got opinions. Take a trip through our countdown of the best Woody Allen movies: his ups, his downs, his New York movies, his Academy Award winners, his essential masterpieces.\n\nThe worst of Woody’s European jaunts, this one didn’t even receive theatrical distribution in the country in which it’s set: Britain. Woody paired himself with Scarlett Johansson to play, respectively, a magician called the Great Splendini and a journalism student who goes on the trail of a killer. It’s not radical to call it his low point.—Dave Calhoun\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nLarry David’s indifferent shrug on the film’s poster tells you all you need to know about one of the Woodman’s worst. On paper, the combination of David and Allen seems can’t-lose, but only sourness emerged from the real thing. Ingrained with bone-deep misanthropy, it’s hard to imagine this project being any better had the director made it in the 1970s with Zero Mostel, as he originally intended.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe beginning of the 21st century was a hard time to be a Woody Allen fan. On a losing streak of London-set films, he crossed to the dark side with this thin drama starring Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell as brothers who agree to do a hit for their uncle to get them out of a tough spot.—Cath Clarke\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nSmack-dab in the middle of a halfhearted period for the Woodman, this shrill romantic comedy stumbles mainly in casting: As the manipulative, noncommittal Amanda, Christina Ricci never quite taps into humor. Meanwhile, Jason Biggs turns Allen’s stammering everynebbish into a bland carbon copy. It feels like an American Pie sequel without the pastry.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nAdvertising\n\nIn what feels more like a padded short story, the director-star plays a formerly great filmmaker reduced to overseeing TV ads. When he’s finally tapped for a big project, the guy suffers an instant, psychosomatic stroke of blindness—yet the show goes on. The movie-set slapstick is tired, as are Allen’s satirical jabs at moneyed showbiz types.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nThe first film of what we can now call Woody’s “Mia Period” didn’t exactly promise great things; it’s a scattered, soufflé-light affair, aping Bergman’s Smiles of a Summer Night without seeming to understand it all that well. Still, it’s refreshing to see Allen in a non-neurotic mood and, within the totality of his career, the film is refreshing.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nAdvertising\n\nOverly schematic, this was the one that had a bunch of brainy playwrights eating at Pastis, batting around a simple scenario, one of them shaping it as a comedy, the other as drama. As the fictional title character, intense Radha Mitchell can’t pull off half of the equation—and it’s hard to say if Winona Ryder, intended to star, would have done it any better.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nPossibly the best thing you can say about this film is that it’s the least bad project from Woody’s London phase. A comedy with a taste as bitter as arsenic, it has thinly drawn characters navigating marriage failures, the search for love and fortune-telling. Not wholly terrible.—Cath Clarke\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nAdvertising\n\nThis ’40s-set screwball comedy came shortly before Woody departed to make films in Europe for several years. It features the director as an insurance investigator who’s unwittingly hypnotized to carry out jewel heists; audiences struggled with the aging Allen putting himself in romantic situations with Charlize Theron.—Dave Calhoun\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nAn extremely patchy patchwork of stories set in modern Rome, this film has tourist Woody meeting his Italian future son-in-law for the first time in the Italian capital. The high point is an opera singer whose talents only emerge in the shower—so he takes the entire cubicle onstage with him, to great acclaim.—Dave Calhoun\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nAdvertising\n\nA lighthearted romance set in 1920s Germany and France, this is one of Allen’s most charmingly performed efforts. Our hero, Stanley (Colin Firth, amusingly pompous), is a popular stage magician whose task is to debunk a self-proclaimed psychic named Sophie (Emma Stone). Yet try as Stanley might, he’s unable to uncover her trickery, and with each new “miracle” she performs, he falls deeper in love. It’s a simple premise that Allen complicates with an illusionist’s expertise.—Keith Uhlich\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nFinally, a Woody Allen film to get verklempt about. His prior years had been hard on fans, harder on critics, but he returned to form with this thriller set in the richly appointed drawing rooms, tennis courts and yachts of the English upper class. (Er, who is this Woody guy anyway?) In swapping Manhattan for a slightly more expansive island, the director got closer to his career-long obsessions with Bergmanesque guilt and cosmic absurdity.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nAdvertising\n\nIt’s hard to pick another American director as consistently on fire as Allen was in the ’80s, yet this Bergmanesque domestic drama outfoxed him. Notoriously, he reshot it with a different cast, but the longueurs remained. Regardless, the presence of a majestically rude Elaine Stritch (R.I.P.) goes a long way. It remains Allen’s worst-performing film, but an intriguing one.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nOne of Woody’s less successful experiments with genre. Shadows and Fog draws on his beloved German Expressionism to create a world of murky morals and shifting allegiances, steeped in Kafkaesque angst. The film is beautiful to look at, but the mismatched cast-—John Malkovich, Jodie Foster, Madonna—and uneven script leave the film feeling awkward and uneasy.—Tom Huddleston\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nAdvertising\n\nWoody makes a rare foray into the world of musicals, in which actors not known for their soft-shoe or songbird voices (Drew Barrymore, Alan Alda, Edward Norton, the director himself) start dancing and warbling at the drop of a hat. Not as bad as you’d think, but it wouldn’t make anyone’s Allen A-list.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nWould Blue Jasmine be half as good a film with another actor playing Jasmine, the self-destructive society wife living a champagne lifestyle on lemonade money after her husband is sent to prison? Perhaps not, but Woody Allen lucked out with Cate Blanchett, who gives a brilliant, Oscar-winning, career-best performance.—Cath Clarke\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nAllen stars in this expertly executed mockumentary as Leonard Zelig, a nondescript man with chameleonic powers who shows up in the darnedest places throughout the ’20s and ’30s. He’s a proto–Forrest Gump, rubbing shoulders with everyone from Fanny Brice to Adolf Hitler, and catching the romantic eye of Mia Farrow’s doting psychologist.—Keith Uhlich\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\nAdvertising\n\nOff-kilter talents have often found voice in Woody’s work, and the pairing of Sean Penn and a barely known Samantha Morton as, respectively, a 1930s jazz musician and his mute girlfriend is especially winning. The film deals lovingly with the tunes of the period (especially those of gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt, an Allen favorite), and the faux-doc interview inserts give it a unique touch.—Dave Calhoun\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nWoody’s at his most optimistic and up-with-people with this fantasy of a downtrodden Depression-era housewife (Mia Farrow) whose world comes alive when the pith-helmeted hero of her favorite movie (Jeff Daniels) steps down from the screen and sweeps her off her feet. The result is both a giddy celebration and a quietly crafty investigation into the effect cinema can have on its audience.—Tom Huddleston\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nAdvertising\n\nA bunch of hardworking comedians kibitz over coffee at the Carnegie Deli. From their reminiscences emerges a wonderful (fictional) tale, about scrappy talent manager Danny Rose (Allen) and his fiercely loyal slate of also-rans. A loving tribute to old-school New York moxie, the film also contains Mia Farrow’s brassy Italian ballbuster, a wild transformation you’ll never forget.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nThis caustic comedy revolves around the romantic tribulations of two married couples played by Allen and Mia Farrow, and Sydney Pollack and Judy Davis. It’s a trenchant examination of long-term relationships on the downswing, something that the real-world tensions surrounding the production (the film was shot around the time of the Soon-Yi Previn scandal) only heighten.—Keith Uhlich\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nAdvertising\n\nGreatest opening in cinema history? Gordon Willis’s glittering monochrome camerawork combines with Gershwin’s glorious glissandos and Woody’s scalpel-sharp self-mockery to create the ultimate hymn to a city, a sensation, a whole way of life. The remainder of the movie covers familiar ground—romance, self-doubt, intellectualism, despair—with Woody’s customary intelligence and insight.—Tom Huddleston\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nHere are Allen’s most exquisite performances: nuanced, perfectly balanced, lovably neurotic. There’s not a weak link in the cast, and while it’s a shame to single out an essential performance, it has to be Dianne Wiest’s unsettled Holly, the kind of desperate, flailing Manhattanite that future director-writers would spin entire careers out of.—Joshua Rothkopf\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe film in which Woody’s comic and serious sides most comfortably align, this one tells of two barely connected characters, an eye doctor (Martin Landau) and a filmmaker (Allen), each with intricately messy private lives. Landau handles the doctor’s rising guilt and claustrophobia especially well, while the whole enterprise is entertaining, thoughtful, morally inquiring and hits just the right level of amusing.—Dave Calhoun\n\nBuy on Amazon\n\nWoody Allen famously wanted to call it Anhedonia, the clinical inability to experience happiness—funny for a film that gives us so much pleasure. This best and best-loved of Woody’s movies is the anatomy of a breakup, beginning at the end of New York comedian Alvy Singer’s relationship with Annie (Diane Keaton, in an iconic turn). It’s packed with gags, and yet there is a painful message at its heart: that meeting your soulmate doesn’t always guarantee a happy ending.—Cath Clarke\n\nWatch on Amazon Instant Video"
