        "text": "Who’s your favorite actress? For a stretch of people born across (at least) three decades, the answer is likely to be Meryl Streep. It would be easy to discount this as a default answer based on the prominence of Streep’s Academy Award-winning accolades … but also foolish. For nearly 50 years, no other actress has quite redefined cinematic possibility and inspiration for female performers, reinvented herself several times over, and related to audiences with all manner of characters — witches and whistleblowers, devils and drinkers, action heroes and ABBA lovers. This month, Streep celebrates her diamond-jubilee 75th birthday, and all month long, Midwest Film Journal will honor The Marvelous Ms. Meryl.\n\nGrowing up, I watched Saturday-morning cartoons, ate oatmeal and ran outside without shoes … and knew that Meryl Streep was both old and, in my house, revered.\n\nStreep’s performances have long been noted for nuance and depth — a beacon of familiarity to many audiences, for a reason maybe I’m too young to understand. Both my grandparents and my parents loved Streep as if she were family, as if she came to my birthday parties, choir performances and baseball games. But Streep’s movies have always been too unavailable for me — never a hook for me despite her regard, at least for me and maybe others from my generation.\n\nTo me, Streep was the ultimate grandmother in movies. Like Tom Hanks, she was a key indoctrination for Boomer-core movies made for and loved by my grandparents’ generation. Having not lived through any World Wars and not raised on Samuel Beckett or Raymond Carver, I didn’t find Streep approachable let alone relatable … until I saw her performance in Woody Allen’s Manhattan.\n\nAlthough Streep’s screen time is limited and the film’s runtime dominated by Woody Allen’s performance (as is par for his early films’ course), she plays an integral and human role in Manhattan as Allen’s ex-wife and the mother of his child. After a recent divorce, Jill (Streep) writes, publishes and seeks a film adaptation of a book that tells the tale of her broken marriage to Isaac (Allen) — who, of course, objects to all of Jill’s actions in meetings and phone calls. But his protests stop nothing from coming to fruition. The book is written, published and mulled over by movie producers.\n\nIsaac is made to seem like a nice guy always at the short end of things, that he’s unfairly pushed around by others’ idiotic decisions and that his personal responsibility for his situations shouldn’t be taken into account (that is, outside of his relationship with a 17-year-old high-school girl). But I digress.\n\nThe film leaves vague what ended this marriage, focusing instead on the aftermath. Jill takes care of her and Isaac’s young son more than he does. She is happy in a relationship with her new partner. She follows her creative endeavors despite Isaac’s incessant objections. Although Manhattan may try to make Jill out to be a villain, she presents as independent and healthy without Isaac. And this observation alone destroys the carefully built image of Isaac as the innocent, blameless man. If he was as perfect as he tried to make it out to be, why does Jill do so well outside of their marriage? Maybe that’s unfair to Isaac, but the only thing Jill seems to grieve is the time lost in that relationship with him.\n\nJill is cool and, when not pushed by complaints, calm. She is young, mindful, intelligent and quick. Her priorities are clear and her ideas are strong. Jill is someone who underwent trauma and came out with renewed energy for life. Is this a character the audience should shame? I don’t think so. Rather, while watching Manhattan, Streeps shows us how someone can contend with emotional aggression and unwanted solicitations without losing their identity — bullied but not brought back to the situation they fought so hard to leave. That’s a message relatable to any age, generation or gender."
