        "text": "WHO was Leonard Zelig? These facts we know: that he was born in New York around the turn of the century into a Jewish immigrant family and that his father, Morris, was a Yiddish actor. The only reference to Morris in theater archives indicates that he was coolly received when he played Puck in an orthodox version of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.''\n\nScott Fitzgerald, in his journals, reports meeting someone named Leonard Zellman at a 1928 garden party on Long Island and finding him charming and urbane, with a nice turn of phrase and impeccably dressed. Not long afterward a baseball player calling himself Lou Zelig turned up at the Florida training camp of the New York Yankees. Still later, the same guy is seen in Chicago, first as a member of the Capone mob and then, curiously, as a black jazz musician.\n\nLeonard Zelig is all these people and more. He is Woody Allen's most brilliant, most inspired fictional creation, and the movie that contains him, called simply ''Zelig,'' is the writer-director-actor's most brilliant work. Though ''Zelig'' looks as if it were a small film, it is a jam-packed powerhouse of film-making wit, wisdom, hilarity and technology. It is ''Citizen Kane'' miraculously transformed into a side-splitting comedy.\n\nIn many ways, ''Zelig'' recalls ''Take the Money and Run'' (1969), Mr. Allen's first feature as a triple-threat man, while Leonard Zelig has a lot in common with that earlier film's earnest but frequently troubled hero, Virgil Starkweather. Virgil, you may remember, is the would-be bank robber whose first job was stalled as the teller studied the holdup note, ''This is a gub.''\n\n''Zelig'' has the form of a solemn documentary about the life and times of Leonard Zelig (Mr. Allen) in the late 1920's and 30's, and the larger lessons to be learned about American society from his brief but stunning celebrity. It opens with Susan Sontag, the critic (''Against Interpretation''), photographed in living color, looking great and looking back over the decades to Zelig's odd career. This we see in bits and pieces of old black-and-white newsreels, faded newspaper clippings and photographs, early films made during his medical treatment, home movies and contemporary interviews with some of the fictional survivors of that era, as well as with real people such as Miss Sontag, Saul Bellow and Dr. Bruno Bettelheim.\n\nWhat emerges is a sweet but uproariously funny portrait of a 1920's America suffering from the quintessential American malady of the 1980's. Leonard Zelig's problem is that he has absolutely no identity he can call his own. He is a cipher, as close to the theoretical concept of zero as Bertrand Russell could define. He is so pathologically nil that, over the years, he has developed the unconscious ability to transform himself, physically and mentally, into the image of whatever strong personality he's with.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
