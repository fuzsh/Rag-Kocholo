        "text": "Woody Allen’s 50th film, Coup de Chance, came out on Friday. Not that you would know. There were no screenings last weekend in Allen’s native Brooklyn. In Manhattan, the movie played at a single theater at Quad Cinema, on West 13th, where it showed on a screen so small that the size elicited much discussion. The crowd included couples on dates, the kind of retirees and families who see everything, groups of film buffs, and many French speakers. (Which makes sense: The 96-minute romp was filmed in Paris with a French cast.) The Eavesdropper showed up early, lingered in the lobby, and left with a group of film boys in windbreakers who gave their critiques en route to the West 4th Street station.\n\nIt’s a stupid debate, or what I would say, talking about it as praxism literally, rather than talking about certain elements is meaningless. It’s not like we banned Trump.\n\nYeah, it’s not confusing if you think about it as Is this part of the pattern of fascism — historical fascism?\n\nThere’s actually a lot of people here.\n\n[Whispers] I love Woody Allen.\n\nThe less I know about his personal life the better.\n\nI’m kind of surprised that they’re doing this. Did you see the last one?\n\nOh it’s so small.\n\nIt’s cute cute, cute, cute.\n\nOui! Teeny tiny.\n\nOui ça va?\n\nÇa va bien.\n\nIt’s such a small theater. It’s like someone’s private showing.\n\nShould we do three here?\n\nWant the middle?\n\nYou want the middle? Are you ready for middling?\n\nThat was so good. Oh my God.\n\nHa! I loved it.\n\nI felt like I was watching something underwater: all the weird angles?Seriously, what was going on? That was crazy.\n\nThe characters are so ugly, I get annoyed at how ugly they are.\n\nWill you hold my bag a minute?\n\nExcellent! It was excellent!\n\nI’m not surprised.\n\nThat was good. I’m trying to remember the last Woody Allen I saw—\n\nSo I remember I liked the one about the tennis in London.\n\nI liked that one.\n\nI watched the tennis one more than once.\n\nI liked her, but I liked the other women in the movie better: the wife.\n\nSo cheesy I know, but it works.\n\nThe part that felt really Woody Allen was the jazz, that was the throughline.\n\nThe whole theme of the movie was the luck of the draw, and boy oh boy did she luck out.\n\nAnd that one last visit to that adorable apartment?\n\nOh my God, wasn’t it adorable?\n\nThat was better than the last one.\n\nThat was pretty good, honestly.\n\nYeah, it was better than I expected.\n\nI don’t know how seriously to take the writer—\n\nYou don’t think he’s a stand-in for Woody Allen?\n\nI thought at the beginning, we’re supposed to take the melodrama seriously.\n\nThat’s every Woody Allen movie.\n\nBut there’s a layer of mocking-ness in other Woody Allens?\n\nBut this character isn’t like — I just mean if you watch Radio Days or Purple Rose of Cairo, there’s a writer who’s too sincere, without that part of his performance of it.\n\nBut he’s serious about it, he just can’t help but be unserious in the role.\n\nHe’s self-mocking.\n\nHe is.\n\nHe is.\n\nIt’s serious beyond the layer of mocking irony.\n\nHis things about love are very serious?\n\nI think the writer was supposed to be serious but the way he was killed, and the lack of sentiment around it; it was funny.\n\nWhy did it look like a Terrence Malick movie for half the time? The camera would like, swoop?\n\nHe’s relinquished some clear control.\n\nThere’s no romance in making movies anymore. It’s true.\n\nI don’t know why he didn’t make his getting canceled into a bit?\n\nIt is! It’s all about a writer who’s wrongfully killed for being with the wrong woman: Is it not exactly this? It’s these evil censors who don’t believe in luck who need to be killed! It’s a real roman à clef!\n\nLaughs\n\nThat was pretty good though. They tied things together quite nicely.\n\nThe way the writer was killed was so anticlimactic, so unsentimental.\n\nI think it’s a very brittle movie. Everything is played for laughs.\n\nIt’s very similar to Match Point, or Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n\nYes.\n\nCrimes and Misdemeanors is way more a comedy. It had all these interludes of the professor, We are alone on the planet …\n\n[Laughs.]\n\nThe constant refrain of the Herbie Hancock song was making me laugh so hard.\n\nWhat’s the best train for us?\n\nThe BD.\n\nOh the B stops running at 9:30.\n\n[Pause]\n\nWould you do that to X’s lover? Would you hire someone to do a cowardly way to kill him?\n\nNo!\n\nOr it’s a question of character: Would you be more willing to kill someone, or to die?\n\nI’d prefer to kill than to die.\n\nThey’re extending it! Probably a week."
