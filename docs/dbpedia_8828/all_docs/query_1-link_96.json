        "text": "The list of actors refusing to work with Woody Allen is getting longer—and more prestigious. In a recent interview with The Guardian, Oscar winner Michael Caine declared that he was done working with the director, specifically because of Dylan Farrow’s allegations against Allen. (Allen’s estranged daughter claims that the director sexually abused her as a child; Allen has repeatedly denied the claims.) Caine now joins stars like Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth, and Rachel Brosnahan, all of whom have worked with the award-winning filmmaker before, and have since vowed to never work with him again.\n\n“I am so stunned,” Caine said when asked directly about the allegations. “I’m a patron of the N.S.P.C.C. [the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children] and have very strong views about pedophilia. I can’t come to terms with it, because I loved Woody and had a wonderful time with him. I even introduced him to Mia [Farrow]. I don’t regret working with him, which I did in complete innocence; but I wouldn’t work with him again, no.”\n\nCaine starred in Allen’s 1986 film Hannah and Her Sisters, a film that landed him his first Oscar win. (Caine would go on to pick up a second best-supporting-actor statuette in 2000.) As he mentioned, Caine also introduced Allen to the actress Mia Farrow in the late 1970s. Farrow and Allen began dating shortly afterward, and the actress went on to star in several of his films, including Hannah and Her Sisters. The couple decided to adopt Dylan in 1985.\n\nOver the last few years, Dylan has been extremely vocal about the sexual abuse she says she endured during childhood, allegedly perpetrated by Allen. She wrote an essay for The New York Times about it in 2014, and, in the wake of the #MeToo movement, wrote an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times last year, kicking off another wave of industry figures reconsidering Allen. “Why is it that Harvey Weinstein and other accused celebrities have been cast out by Hollywood, while Allen recently secured a multi-million-dollar distribution deal with Amazon?” she wrote.\n\nFarrow also gave her first TV interview about the issue earlier this year, telling CBS This Morning that Allen “has been lying for so long” about the allegations. Allen, meanwhile, denied the claims in a robust statement which said, in part, that “even though the Farrow family is cynically using the opportunity afforded by the Time’s Up movement to repeat this discredited allegation, that doesn’t make it any more true today than it was in the past,” he wrote. “I never molested my daughter—as all investigations concluded a quarter of a century ago.”\n\nStill, the post-Weinstein era, coupled with Farrow’s repeated claims, have inspired quite a few actors to distance themselves from Allen. Stars like Timothée Chalamet and Rebecca Hall recently donated their salaries from Allen’s last film to organizations like Time’s Up, essentially apologizing for working with the controversial filmmaker. And now Caine is joining the chorus.\n\nMeghan Markle’s Royal Engagement Style\n\n1 / 19\n\ntime’s up\n\nJeff Daniels, Peter Sarsgaard Join Growing Group of Actors Rejecting Woody Allen, Sort Of\n\n“I believe Dylan Farrow,” says Jeff Daniels. “Would I do another one with Woody? The difficult decision would be to turn him down.”\n\ntime’s up\n\nTimothée Chalamet Donates Salary from Woody Allen Film to Three Charities\n\n“I don’t want to profit from my work on the film,” the young actor wrote on Instagram.\n\nScandal\n\n10 Undeniable Facts About the Woody Allen Sexual-Abuse Allegation\n\nFor decades, Dylan Farrow’s claims of abuse at the hands of her adopted father, which he refutes, have been systematically distorted. The author of two heavily vetted investigative reports weighs in with the cold, hard facts.\n\nAward Season\n\nHow Timothée Chalamet’s Bob Dylan Biopic Could Shape This Year’s Oscar Race\n\nWith A Complete Unknown, the Oscar nominee could be back in the race for the first time since his breakout in Call Me by Your Name. But that’s only the beginning of the awards potential for this movie.\n\nAward Season\n\nVenice and Toronto Film Festival Lineups Raise Our Oscar Hopes\n\nHotly anticipated films like Joker: Folie à Deux and The Piano Lesson are mixed with some wild cards that could shake up awards season.\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Real Reason Matt Damon Loves Working With Casey Affleck\n\n“You need to get every idea out,” says the star of The Instigators, in a joint interview with Affleck. “You get there a lot faster if you’re not worried about people’s feelings. So, in other words, we talk a lot of shit to each other.”\n\nAward Season\n\nJoan Chen Has Always Been a Movie Star. Hollywood Is Finally Catching Up\n\nThe veteran actor has worked with Bernardo Bertolucci, David Lynch, and Ang Lee, and maintained rich careers in both China and the US. With the new film Dìdi, Oscar buzz is trailing her for the first time. What took so long?\n\nTelevision\n\nInside the Viral Mormon Sex Scandal That Sparked a New Hulu Reality Series\n\nThe Secret Lives of Mormon Wives will follow eight TikTok influencer moms, one of whom faced backlash for “soft swinging” within their tight-knit religious community—then falling for the man she was sleeping with.\n\nMovies\n\nWatch Timothée Chalamet Sing as Bob Dylan in First A Complete Unknown Trailer\n\nThe actor previously revealed that he worked with Austin Butler’s Elvis team to morph into the famed folk singer.\n\nCelebrity\n\nJennifer Aniston Slams J.D. Vance’s Resurfaced Remarks About “Childless Cat Ladies”\n\nAniston, who has been candid about her own struggle to conceive, also criticized Trump’s running mate for voting against the Right to IVF Act: “Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day.”"
