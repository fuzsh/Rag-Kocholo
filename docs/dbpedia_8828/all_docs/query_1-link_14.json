        "text": "Woody Allen, my favourite American filmmaker, whose career spans over six decades, has long been a significant figure in the world of cinema. His films often explore complex relationships, existential crises and the human condition. Over the years, Allen has collaborated with a huge amount of talented actors, some of whom have delivered their career-best performances under his direction. Here, I’ll spotlight five actors who have been particularly celebrated for their work in Woody Allen’s films.\n\n1. Diane Keaton\n\nDiane Keaton’s collaboration with Woody Allen in films like “Annie Hall” and “Manhattan” has been nothing short of iconic. Keaton’s portrayal of Annie Hall, a quirky, independent woman, won her an Academy Award and set a new standard for female roles in romantic comedies. Her nuanced performances have been a cornerstone in Allen’s films, making her a recurring collaborator up until 1993’s ‘Manhattan Murder Mystery’.\n\n2. Michael Caine\n\nIn “Hannah and Her Sisters,” Michael Caine plays Elliot, a man torn between his wife and his infatuation with his sister-in-law. Caine’s performance was lauded for its depth and complexity, earning him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. His role showcased the moral ambiguity that is often a hallmark of Allen’s characters.\n\nCaine’s performance, so fervent, so agonisingly dedicated, actually gains in force and touching sincerity with the years. — The Guardian\n\n3. Cate Blanchett\n\nCate Blanchett’s role in “Blue Jasmine” as a fallen socialite struggling with her new reality was a tour de force. Her performance was both vulnerable and intense, capturing the essence of a woman on the brink. Blanchett won an Academy Award for her role, further solidifying her as one of the great actors of her generation.\n\n4. Scarlett Johansson\n\nScarlett Johansson has been an inspiration for Woody Allen in the 21st century, starring in films “Match Point”, “Scoop” and “Vicky Cristina Barcelona.” Johansson’s roles in Allen’s films have been diverse, ranging from a seductive femme fatale to a confused romantic, showcasing her range as an actor.\n\n“How do I feel about Woody Allen?” Johansson lets the question hang for a moment. After a beat, Johansson makes it clear that she disagrees with many of her peers. “I love Woody,” she says. “I believe him, and I would work with him anytime.” — hollywoodreporter.com\n\n5. Woody Allen Himself\n\nIt would be remiss not to mention Woody Allen, who more often than not starred in his own films (certainly in the 20th century and the early part of the 21st). His roles are commonly seen as that of a neurotic, intellectual New Yorker, providing comic relief while also driving the narrative. In “Radio Days,” Allen narrates the film, offering a nostalgic and possibly autobiographical look at a young boy’s upbringing.\n\nWoody Allen’s films have been a platform for actors to showcase their talent in roles that are both challenging and rewarding. These five actors have not only been celebrated for their performances but have also contributed to the enduring legacy of Woody Allen’s cinematic universe."
