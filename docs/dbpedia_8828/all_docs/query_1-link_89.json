        "text": "01 of 09\n\nColin Firth\n\n“I wouldn’t work with him again,” Firth said in a statement, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe actor’s announcement came the same day Allen’s estranged daughter Dylan Farrow gave her first televised interview about her allegations of sexual abuse against her father.\n\nFirth appeared in Allen’s film Magic in the Moonlight in 2013.\n\n02 of 09\n\nRachel Brosnahan\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel actress spoke out about working with Allen, 82, and the controversy surrounding him over longstanding sexual abuse allegations. Brosnahan worked with the writer/director on Amazon's 2016 series Crisis in Six Scenes.\n\n\"Look, I had a great experience working on that project,\" Brosnahan said during an interview for The Hollywood Reporter's 'Awards Chatter' podcast. \"But I do have to take this opportunity to say that, for me, I have really struggled with the decision to do that project for a long time.\"\n\nBrosnahan appeared in four of the six installments of Crisis in Six Scenes. The actress, 27, said her decision to work with Allen was \"inconsistent\" with her beliefs.\n\n03 of 09\n\nTimothée Chalamet\n\nThe Call Me By Your Name star is one of the most recent actors to speak out and express regret over working with the controversial filmmaker. Chalamet announced in an Instagram post on Jan. 16 that he plans to donate his salary from his role in the upcoming Allen film, A Rainy Day in New York.\n\nIn the post, the Golden Globe nominee, 22, wrote: “This year has changed the way I see and feel about so many things; it has been a thrilling and, at times, enlightening education. I have, to this point, chosen projects from the perspective of a young actor trying to walk in the footsteps of more seasoned actors that I admire. But I am learning that a good role isn’t the only criteria for accepting a job – that has become much clearer to me in the past few months, having witnessed the birth of a powerful movement intent on ending injustice, inequality and above all, silence.”\n\nChalamet continued the post by detailing his reasoning behind his decision and listed the organizations that will recieve his salary.\n\n“I have been asked in a few recent interviews about my decision to work on a film with Woody Allen last summer. I’m not able to answer the question directly because of contractual obligations. But what I can say is this: I don’t want to profit from my work on the film, and to that end, I am going to donate my entire salary to three charities: TIME’S UP, The LGBT Center in New York, and RAINN. I want to be worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave artists who are fighting for all people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.”\n\n04 of 09\n\nRebecca Hall\n\nHall, who stars alongside Chalamet in A Rainy Day in New York, wrote an emotional Instagram post on Jan. 12 which announced her plans to donate her salary from the film to the Time's Up initiative.\n\nIn the post, Hall recalls how the news of the Weinstein accusations and reading powerful statements from Allen's daughter, Dylan, helped her realize that working with the director was a mistake.\n\n“The day after the Weinstein accusation broke in full force I was shooting a day of work on Woody Allen’s latest movie in New York. I couldn’t have imagined somewhere stranger to be that day. When asked to do so, some seven months ago, I quickly said yes. He gave me one of my first significant roles in film for which I have always been grateful, it was one day in my hometown - easy,\" Hall, who also starred in Allen's 2008 film Vicky Cristina Barcelona, wrote.\n\n\"I have, however subsequently realized there is nothing easy about any of this. In the weeks following I have thought very deeply about this decision, and remain conflicted and saddened. After reading and re-reading Dylan Farrow’s statements of a few days ago and going back and reading the older ones - I see, not only how complicated this matter is, but that my actions have made another woman feel silenced and dismissed. That is not something that sits easily with me in the current or indeed any moment, and I am profoundly sorry.\" Hall continued.\n\nHall ended the post expressing her regrets and hopes for the future with the Time's Up initiative.\n\n\"I regret this decision and wouldn’t make the same one today. It’s a small gesture and not one intended as close to compensation but I’ve donated my wage to @timesup,\" Hall penned. \"I’ve also signed up, will continue to donate, and look forward to working with and being part of this positive movement towards change not just in Hollywood but hopefully everywhere. #timesup”\n\n05 of 09\n\nMira Sorvino\n\nSorvino was one of the first women to accuse disgraced movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment and later penned an open letter to Dylan Farrow vowing to never work with her filmmaker father again.\n\nIn the letter published by the Huffington Post, the 50-year-old actress, who won an Oscar for working with Allen on 1995's Mighty Aphrodite, was deeply apologetic for her decision to work on the film.\n\n\"I confess that at the time I worked for Woody Allen I was a naïve young actress,\" Sorvino wrote to Dylan. \"I swallowed the media's portrayal of your abuse allegations against your father as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle between Mia Farrow and him, and did not look further into the situation, for which I am terribly sorry.\"\n\nSorvino continued to say that she will never work with Allen again.\n\n\"This kind of abuse cannot be allowed to continue. If this means tearing down all the old gods, so be it,\" Sorvino wrote. \"Even if you love someone, if you learn they may have committed these despicable acts, they must be exposed and condemned, and this exposure must have consequences. I will never work with him again.\"\n\n06 of 09\n\nGreta Gerwig\n\nThe Lady Bird writer and director spoke out about working with Allen during a conversation with The New York Times in early January.\n\nIn the interview, the Times asked Gerwig if Allen, along with other controversial figures Roman Polanski and Kevin Spacey, would ever work again. Gerwig took the opportunity to speak about her experience working with Allen on 2012's To Rome With Love.\n\n“I would like to speak specifically to the Woody Allen question which I have been asked about a couple times recently, as I worked for him on a film that came out in 2012,” Gerwig said. “It is something that I take very seriously and have been thinking deeply about, and it has taken me time to gather my thoughts and say what I mean to say.”\n\nGerwig further clarified that she has chosen to never work with Allen again.\n\n“I can only speak for myself and what I’ve come to is this: If I had known then what I know now, I would not have acted in the film,\" Gerwig said. \"I have not worked for him again, and I will not work for him again.”\n\n07 of 09\n\nEllen Page\n\nPage took to Facebook back in November 2017 to reveal that working with Allen on 2012's To Rome with Love was the \"biggest regret\" of her career.\n\n\"I did a Woody Allen movie and it is the biggest regret of my career,\" Page wrote.\n\nIn the lengthy post, Page, 30, admitted that she was ashamed of her decision to work on the film.\n\n\"I had yet to find my voice and was not who I am now and felt pressured because 'of course you ahve to say yes to this Woody Allen film,'\" Page wrote. \"Ultimately, however, it is my choice what films I decide to do and I made the wrong choice. I made an awful mistake.\"\n\n08 of 09\n\nDavid Krumholtz\n\nIn a Jan. 5 tweet Krumholtz, who worked with Allen on 2017's Wonder Wheel, spoke out against the director and expressed regret over his decision to work on the film.\n\n\"I deeply regret working with Woody Allen on Wonder Wheel,\" Krumhotlz wrote. \"It's one of my most heartbreaking mistakes.
