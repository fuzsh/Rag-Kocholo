        "text": "My Dinner with Woody\n\nAfter writing a fictional article about a dinner with director Woody Allen, Maya must endure the criticism of her father and her coworkers. But she's delighted when someone claiming to be Allen calls to compliment her about the piece. However, when he drops by the office, Maya finds that the man who called is nothing more than an obsessed impostor trying to pass himself off as the famous director. Meanwhile, a mix-up has Nina giving Jack breath-freshener instead of eye drops. After getting to know the phony Woody Allen, Maya begins to enjoy his flattery and company. Taking his advice, she's even able to persuade Jack into letting her pursue an unpopular story idea. However, despite her delight in having the advice work, Maya is still taken aback to find Woody perched on her balcony when she arrives home from work. Meanwhile, Nina pledges to stand by Jack until his eyesight is restored. Despite warnings from Elliott, Maya decides to keep seeing Woody even though he's an impostor. However, after learning that he is actually the eccentric millionaire Preston Beckman, Maya decides to try and help him. Yet unwilling to play along, Beckman continues keeping up his role as Woody Allen, much to Maya's disappointment. Finally, Jack's eyesight returns to normal in time to discover Finch trying to capitalize on his blindness."
