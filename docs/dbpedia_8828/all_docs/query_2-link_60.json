        "text": "Image by Col­in Swan, via Wiki­me­dia Com­mons\n\nWe’ve looked this week at the favorite movies select­ed by such respect­ed film­mak­ers as Stan­ley Kubrick and Mar­tin Scors­ese. Today we round out this trio of emi­nent direc­tors with the great­est films of all time accord­ing to Woody Allen, vot­ing in the almighty Sight and Sound poll. The direc­tor of Annie Hall, Crimes and Mis­de­meanors, and Mid­night in Paris select­ed, in no par­tic­u­lar order, the fol­low­ing:\n\nThe 400 Blows (François Truf­faut, 1959)\n\n8½ (Fed­eri­co Felli­ni, 1963)\n\nAmar­cord (Fed­eri­co Felli­ni, 1972)\n\nThe Bicy­cle Thieves (Vit­to­rio de Sica, 1948)\n\nCit­i­zen Kane (Orson Welles, 1941)\n\nThe Dis­creet Charm of the Bour­geoisie (Luis Buñuel, 1972)\n\nGrand Illu­sion (Jean Renoir, 1937)\n\nPaths of Glo­ry (Stan­ley Kubrick, 1957)\n\nRashomon (Aki­ra Kuro­sawa, 1950)\n\nThe Sev­enth Seal (Ing­mar Bergman, 1957)\n\nIt comes as no shock that Ing­mar Bergman makes the list, giv­en Allen’s well-doc­u­ment­ed and open­ly admit­ted enthu­si­asm for (and, in cas­es like Inte­ri­ors, direct imi­ta­tion of) the man who made The Sev­enth Seal. If that vote rep­re­sents Allen’s con­tem­pla­tive, moral­ly seri­ous side, then the vote for Luis Buñuel’s endur­ing­ly fun­ny sur­re­al­ist farce The Dis­creet Charm of the Bour­geoisie rep­re­sents his well-known predilec­tion for humor, often class-based, which occa­sion­al­ly melts into silli­ness.\n\nLike Scors­ese, Allen includes Kubrick, though for his ear­ly Paths of Glo­ry rather than the more wide­ly-seen 2001. Like both Scors­ese and Kubrick, he picks a Felli­ni — two, in fact — and all three of their lists illus­trate that it would take a con­trar­i­an film­go­er indeed to deny Orson Welles’ Cit­i­zen Kane a vote. Kubrick, you’ll recall, also had great praise for Vit­to­rio de Sica and François Truf­faut, and their ear­ly pic­tures show up among Allen’s selec­tions. Take Kubrick, Scors­ese, and Allen’s lists togeth­er, and you have a few prin­ci­ples to guide your view­ing: con­cen­trate on the mid­cen­tu­ry mas­ters. Cit­i­zen Kane real­ly does mer­it all those acco­lades. And above all, make sure you watch your Felli­ni. But which films did Felli­ni love?\n\nRelat­ed Con­tent:\n\nMar­tin Scors­ese Reveals His 12 Favorite Movies (and Writes a New Essay on Film Preser­va­tion)\n\nStan­ley Kubrick’s List of Top 10 Films (The First and Only List He Ever Cre­at­ed)\n\nHow Woody Allen Dis­cov­ered Ing­mar Bergman, and How You Can Too\n\nWoody Allen Answers 12 Uncon­ven­tion­al Ques­tions He Has Nev­er Been Asked Before\n\nMeetin’ WA: Jean-Luc Godard Meets Woody Allen\n\nCol­in Mar­shall hosts and pro­duces Note­book on Cities and Cul­ture and writes essays on lit­er­a­ture, film, cities, Asia, and aes­thet­ics. He’s at work on a book about Los Ange­les, A Los Ange­les Primer. Fol­low him on Twit­ter at @colinmarshall."
