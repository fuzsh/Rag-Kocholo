        "text": "Woody Allen, orig. Allen Stewart Konigsberg, (born Dec. 1, 1935, Brooklyn, N.Y., U.S.), U.S. film director, screenwriter, and actor. After writing routines for comedians and performing as a nightclub comic, he wrote the Broadway play Don’t Drink the Water (1966). His early films, such as Bananas (1971) and Sleeper (1973), combined highbrow comedy and slapstick. Later romantic comedies such as Annie Hall (1977), which won him two Academy Awards, and Manhattan (1979) offered a bittersweet view of New York life. His other notable films included Interiors (1978), Broadway Danny Rose (1984), The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986; Academy Award for screenwriting), Radio Days (1987), Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), Bullets over Broadway (1994), Mighty Aphrodite (1995), Match Point (2005), and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008). For Midnight in Paris (2011) Allen received his 7th Oscar nomination for best director and his 15th (a record) for best original screenplay; he won the latter award. His screenplay for Blue Jasmine (2013) was also nominated. Allen’s later career was tarnished by allegations of child sex abuse."
