        "text": "Timothée Chalamet has become the latest actor – and the most high profile male actor – to publicly disavow Woody Allen, announcing he will be donating his salary from Allen’s upcoming film to the Time’s Up initiative against harassment and assault, alongside other charities.\n\nChalamet, 22, wore a Time’s Up pin to the Golden Globes this month, where he was nominated for his critically lauded role in Luca Guadagnino’s film Call Me By Your Name. His next film, Allen’s A Rainy Day in New York, is set for 2018 release.\n\nAllen has been the subject of decades-long allegations of sexual abuse by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow, which were renewed in October 2017 when Farrow wrote a piece in the Los Angeles Times titled “Why has the #MeToo revolution spared Woody Allen?”. Allen continues to deny the allegations.\n\nIn an interview with Christiane Amanpouron CNN last week, Chalamet evaded a question about whether he had any “qualms” about working with the director.\n\n“I hesitate to talk about it right now because what I say is only going to anger people,” Chalamet answered. “When that film comes out, if it comes out, that’s going to be really important to talk about, but it’s not the time right now.”\n\nIn a post to Instagram on Monday night, Chalamet wrote that the last year of his professional life has “changed the way I see and feel about so many things”.\n\n“I am learning that a good role isn’t the only criteria for accepting a job – that has become much clearer to me in the past few months, having witnessed the birth of a powerful movement intent on ending injustice, inequality and above all, silence.\n\n“I have been asked in a few recent interviews about my decision to work on a film with Woody Allen last summer. I’m not able to answer the question directly because of contractual obligations. But what I can say is this: I don’t want to profit from my work on the film, and to that end, I am going to donate my entire salary to three charities: Time’s Up, the LGBT Centre in New York, and Rainn [the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network].\n\n“I want to be worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave artists who are fighting for all the people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.”\n\nChalamet stars in Woody Allen’s film alongside Rebecca Hall, who on Friday apologised for acting in the movie, and announced she had donated her wages to the Time’s Up initiative.\n\n“My actions have made another woman feel silenced and dismissed,” she said, referring to statements from Farrow. “I regret this decision and wouldn’t make the same one today.”"
