        "text": "My favorite Woody Allen movie is Broadway Danny Rose.\n\nAnd while he didn't write or direct the film, his performance in The Front is perfect. Anytime that movie is on TV, I end up watching it again because of him.\n\nGreat list, I can’t improve on it\n\nI'd strongly encourage you (and anyone else interested) to check out this thread:\n\nWoody Allen: Film by Film Thread\n\nIt's several years old, but contains 99 pages of thoughts on all his works! If you'd like to review some discussion on any films, you'll find it there. As one of the more active posters on that thread, I know I can say we love to have old discussions revived, and we keep adding new topics, as they appear.\n\nThat’s great! Thank you very much for this tip\n\nfinally, crimes and misdemeanors is probably the film that grapples the most serious moral issues. it also has many great performances. the real revelation was alan alda who was then totally cast against type as a real a a**hole.\n\nhole\n\nI know Woody is most renowned for his 1970s films but I really love his mid-'80s run of Zelig, Broadway Danny Rose, Purple Rose Of Cairo, Hannah And Her Sisters and Radio Days. His contribution to New York Stories is particularly hilarious as well.\n\nI forgot to mention this, one of my favorite Woody Allen films is “Everyone Says I Love You.”! It’s got a great cast and script. A funny one. Nice to see Edward Norton playing a nice kid for a change, too.And it’s really a fun musical. It works. And of course the classic music by Gershwin, Cole Porter et al is spectacular.\n\nOf those I've seen...\n\nRadio Days (#1 for me)\n\nTake The Money And Run\n\nBroadway Danny Rose\n\nStardust Memories\n\nEveryone Says I Love You\n\nDidn't really care all that much for Annie Hall and Manhattan. Tbh, his character in these two films creeps me out a bit.\n\nAwesome! It's a real shame you can't get so many of his films around here easily."
