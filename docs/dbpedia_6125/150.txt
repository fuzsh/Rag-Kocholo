Overview

In a remake of a classic 1980s film, Hairspray tells the story of a young teen girl named Tracy growing up in Baltimore, Maryland in the 1960s. Tracy is obsessed with the city's most popular television show for young teens; a dance show called the Corny Collins Show. Despite its popularity, the show is still racially segregated, and only the children of the richest, most affluent parents in the city are featured as dancers on the show. Tracy, with the help of her parents, attempt to desegregate the show by protesting. Eventually, the protests end with a climactic beauty pageant, which are won by an African-American girl, thus opening up the Corny Collins Show to anyone in Baltimore.
