        "text": "It’s been eight long years since Hairspray has visited the Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury - so what’s another 30 minutes?\n\nAfter an unexpected delay, the curtain finally lifted on opening night to a ripple of relieved whoops and cheers from an audience that was practically buzzing with anticipation.\n\nThe current tour, directed by Loose Woman Brenda Edwards, is making its way across the country, spreading the message of love, positivity and inclusivity - something we desperately need right now.\n\nHairspray follows Tracy Turnblad, a teenage girl who becomes an overnight sensation when she joins a group of dancers on the Corny Collins Show.\n\nUsing her newfound fame, Tracy steps up to fight against racism and intolerance alongside her friends, family and teen heartthrob Link Larkin.\n\nIn a time when hatred seems to be spreading like wildfire, it felt so refreshing to switch off my phone and live in a bubble where people want peace, rather than conflict, for a couple of hours.\n\nIt’s naive to think that a musical can change the world, of course, but given that the whole theatre was cheering emphatically, I’d like to think that we’ll all follow in Tracy’s footsteps, at least in some small way, now that the show’s over.\n\nNow, moving away from the real world and back into musical theatre land, this was the first time I’d seen Hairspray on stage but, as a lover of the film, I had high expectations. And it didn’t disappoint.\n\nI’ve been a huge fan of the soundtrack for years, but seeing it play out in front of my eyes reminded me just how fantastic it really is.\n\nThe funky Run And Tell That, the heart-warming Welcome to the ‘60s and the body-positive Big, Blonde and Beautiful are all a masterclass on bringing a story to life through music and dance. And, of course, it wouldn’t work without such a stellar cast who know how to get the best of these brilliant numbers.\n\nWhile the subject matter is serious, there’s plenty of laughs to be had. Tracy’s unapologetic flirting, Penny’s geeky mannerisms and Edna’s panto-esque innuendos all give the show its trademark nudge-nudge-wink-wink tone.\n\nI almost cried twice. The first was from laughter as Neil Hurst (Edna) and Dermot Canavan (Wilbur) kept giggling and sneaking in ad-libs during their joyous rendition of Timeless To Me.\n\nThe second time was during I Know Where I’ve Been, performed by Michelle Ndegwa (Motormouth Maybelle). When the cast held hands in a steadfast show of solidarity and some of history’s most notable activists flashed on the screen behind them, it was a reminder, yet again, that the fight for equality is an ongoing one.\n\nIt all ended on a high with You Can’t Stop the Beat, the ultimate feel-good musical song. It’s an infectious number that had everyone on their feet.\n\nIt was the perfect end to this big, bold, beautiful show, and I hope it continues spreading positivity for many years.\n\nHairspray is at the Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury until Saturday, August 10. You can book tickets online here.\n\nYou can also book tickets by calling 01227 787787."
