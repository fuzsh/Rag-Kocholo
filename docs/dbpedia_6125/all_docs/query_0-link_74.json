        "meta_description": "The plight of Hairspray is an interesting one. First it was iconic writer-director John Waters’ legendary 1988 cult favorite. Then it became a Broadway musical in 2003. In 2007, it became a movie again — this time based on the stage version that was based on the original movie, losing some raunchiness along the way. The 1988 film (also previously shown on the Belcourt screen) featured trailblazing drag queen Divine, so the film has queer history that makes it a fit for the latest iteration of the Queer Qlassics series. John Travolta is extremely entertaining as Edna Turnblad (the character first played by Divine), but the perfect casting goes beyond Travolta with the incredibly meta teen-heartthrob-playing-teen-heartthrob moment of Zac Efron as Link Larkin. Elijah Kelley dancing as Seaweed J. Stubbs is enough to actually make a person faint. Then there’s my favorite version of Amanda Bynes as Penny Pingleton, and Nikki Blonsky nailing her first movie in the lead role. Christopher Walken, Michelle Pfeiffer and Queen Latifah are in this movie too! I bought merch for this film from Claire’s in 2007, but now I know just what a significant film this is. Can we do the choreography? HANNAH HERNER",
