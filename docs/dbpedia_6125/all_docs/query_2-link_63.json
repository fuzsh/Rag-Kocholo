        "text": "The decision to release both I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry and Hairspray on the same day indicates that July 20, 2007 may signify the start of the gayest summer-movie weekend in Hollywood history (in recent memory, anyway). Ironically, even with Kevin James and Adam Sandler's staunchly straight leading men in the former and John Travolta's cross-dressing housewife in the latter, the far more broadly appealing of the two films is Hairspray, primarily because it shatters stereotypes rather than simply using them as a set-up for another formulaic (not to mention dumb) punch line.\n\nBased not only on a popular Broadway musical but a movie of the same name by gay icon/natural-born iconoclast John Waters, the update/adaptation revels in its enthusiastic destruction of social and cultural expectations, and yet feels infinitely wholesome, fun and family-friendly. In fact, the only thing even remotely offensive about Hairspray is Travolta's performance -- not so much in terms of the singing or dancing, mind you, but how unattractive he looks as a woman.\n\nThe film stars newcomer Nikki Blonsky as Tracy Turnblad, an energetic high school student whose plus-size shape keeps her from landing a spot on Baltimore's top TV dance program, \"The Corny Collins Show,\" despite a repertoire of dance moves that puts her slimmer classmates to shame. After accidentally landing in detention, Tracy meets Seaweed (Elijah Kelley), a black student who not only introduces her to a few new steps, but the idea that her exclusion may be part of a bigger problem -- namely, to segregate anyone different from the blue-eyed-and-blonde-haired \"standard\" that dominates the show.\n\nEnlisting her equally-plump mom Edna (Travolta), dream-guy dance partner Link (Zac Efron), best friend Penny (Amanda Bynes), and the show's \"Negro Day\" host Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah), Tracy decides to stand up for all of the folks who have been forgotten or cast aside. But she soon discovers that station manager Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her daughter Amber (Brittany Snow) will stop at nothing to ensure that this '60s TV show integrates black and white only when it broadcasts over the airwaves.\n\nAll of this sounds a lot more serious than it actually plays in the film. But suffice it to say Hairspray offers a particularly relevant parable for our times, precisely because desegregation -- much like gay rights today -- was once considered a rhetorical issue rather than one of simple human equality. (That its signposts and stereotypes still sting with awkward recognition provides a subtle but effective commentary on how far we've come -- and more importantly, how far we haven't.) But more than anything, Shankman's film is unrelenting fun, full of color and life thanks to a collection of catchy, well-staged tunes and a cast that fleshes out (sometimes literally) the source material's wealth of meaty roles (ok, no more puns).\n\nWhether Blonsky continues to find roles that take advantage of her energy and charisma remains to be seen (Hollywood itself has a problem with \"unconventional\" types), but here she shines and proves that whatever months or years of effort went into her \"overnight discovery\" were well worth it. Meanwhile, Latifah and Pfeiffer are spectacular foils for one another as the TV world's two mother figures -- one affectionate and open, the other cold and uncompromising -- and both enjoy terrific set pieces that simultaneously show off their vocal and acting talents.\n\nThe rest of the younger cast members generally do a good job registering their advancing maturity in the face of Tracy's crusade, even when the staging of the musical numbers requires them to render their coming-of-age in broad, theatrical terms. Efron, previously of the Disney sensation High School Musical, plays a thinking-woman's heartthrob, showing that his actor's touch is just as light between the lines of the script as when he's on the dance floor. Bynes, on the other hand, embraces her character's necessary naivete, making Penny's eventual romance with Seaweed seem that much sweeter. And Snow plays a pitch-perfect ice queen, adding delicate but effective indications that she's more a product of her mother's design than pure, unrelenting movie villainy.\n\nThen, of course, there's Travolta, who evidently lobbied for the chance to inhabit the late Divine's role of Edna Turnblad. Adopting a Baltimore accent that few if any of the other characters share, Travolta really throws himself into the role -- not, unfortunately, enough to forget it's him beneath all of those prosthetics, but enough to believe he's Tracy's mom within this vivid, old-fashioned universe. That said, especially when sparring romantically with his on-screen husband Christopher Walken -- himself an unlikely romantic lead -- Travolta's performance proves more fascinating as a showcase for \"actorly commitment\" than as a tender depiction of married love. (Edna's \"ugliness\" ultimately has less to do with the character's weight than the fact that Travolta just doesn't make a comely woman.)\n\nWhile a little bit long (does every character really need to have a song, much less a subplot wrap-up?), Hairspray is ultimately one of the more engaging and fun movies of the summer, not only because it's well-mounted and terrific to look at but because it addresses some serious issues with a featherweight touch. In fact, what proves most surprising is how many different ways the movie can be interpreted -- as a dazzling, straightforward musical, a clever coming-of-age story, or a tender parable about overcoming intolerance. But then again, that's also the way you can tell the difference between a good summer movie and a bad one: The filmmakers might ugly it up, but they never dumb it down.\n\n4 out of 5 Stars, 8/10 Score"
