The songs include 1960s-style dance music and \"downtown\" rhythm and blues. Set in 1962 Baltimore, Maryland, the production follows teenage Tracy Turnblad's dream to dance on The Corny Collins Show, a local TV dance program based on the real-life Buddy Deane Show.[1] When Tracy wins a role on the show, she becomes a celebrity overnight, leading to social change as Tracy campaigns for the show's integration.\n\nThe musical opened in Seattle in 2002 and moved to Broadway later that year. In 2003, Hairspray won eight Tony Awards, including one for Best Musical, out of 13 nominations. It ran for 2,642 performances, and closed on January 4, 2009.[2] Hairspray has also had national tours, a West End production, and numerous foreign productions and was adapted as a 2007 musical film. The London production was nominated for a record-setting eleven Laurence Olivier Awards, winning four, including Best New Musical.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to interviews included as an extra feature on the 2007 film's DVD release, theater producer Margo Lion first conceived of Hairspray as a stage musical in 1998 after seeing the original film on television. \"I was home looking at a lot of movies, and one of those movies was Hairspray.\" She contacted John Waters, who gave her his blessing, then acquired the rights from New Line Cinema. Lion contacted Marc Shaiman, who expressed interest in the project only if his partner, Scott Wittman, could participate, and Lion agreed. The two enlisted the help of actress and singer Annie Golden to produce a demo recording containing three songs, one of which, \"Good Morning Baltimore\", became the show's opening number. Based on their initial work, Lion was confident that she had hired the right team.[3]\n\nLion contacted Rob Marshall about directing the musical. At the time he was involved in negotiations to direct the screen adaptation of Chicago, but he agreed to become involved in the early development stages of Hairspray with the stipulation he would drop out if assigned the film. Marshall remembered Marissa Jaret Winokur from her brief appearance in the film American Beauty and arranged a meeting with Shaiman and Wittman. The two immediately felt she was right to play Tracy Turnblad but hesitated to commit without seeing any other auditions. They hired Winokur to work with them on the project with the understanding she might be replaced later. A year later, Winokur was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Certain she would lose the role if the creative team learned about her condition, she underwent a hysterectomy, telling only her immediate family. The treatment and surgery succeeded, and Winokur returned to the project.[4] Meanwhile, Marshall began work on Chicago, and Lion hired Jack O'Brien and Jerry Mitchell to direct and to choreograph, respectively. Winokur was one of the first to audition for the role of Tracy and spent two years preparing with voice and dance lessons.[5] Divine portrayed Tracy's mother, Edna Turnblad, in the original film, and Shaiman liked the idea of maintaining the tradition of casting a man as Edna. Harvey Fierstein auditioned for the role with a \"half-hour vocal audition\". He thought they were \"pacifying\" him, but was told, \"They don't want anyone but you\".[6]\n\nAccording to Shaiman, one song, \"I Know Where I've Been\", became controversial during the genesis of the score:\n\nThis was ... inspired by a scene late in the [1988] movie that takes place on the black side of town. It never dawned on us that a torrent of protest would follow us from almost everyone involved with the show. \"It's too sad. ... It's too preachy. ... It doesn't belong. ... Tracy should sing the eleven o'clock number.\" We simply didn't want our show to be yet another showbiz version of a civil rights story where the black characters are just background. And what could be more Tracy Turnblad-like than to give the \"eleven o'clock number\" to the black family at the heart of the struggle? Luckily ... the audiences embraced this moment, which enriches the happy ending to follow, and it is our proudest achievement of the entire experience of writing Hairspray.[7]\n\nProductions\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginal Broadway production\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter a successful tryout at Seattle's 5th Avenue Theatre, Hairspray opened on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theatre on August 15, 2002.[8] Jack O'Brien directed the production, which Jerry Mitchell choreographed, with set design by David Rockwell, costume design by William Ivey Long, lighting design by Kenneth Posner, sound design by Steve C. Kennedy, and the show's many distinctive wigs by Paul Huntley. The performances were conducted by Lon Hoyt, with approximately 15 musicians. The original Broadway cast included Marissa Jaret Winokur and Harvey Fierstein as Tracy and Edna, respectively, Matthew Morrison as Link, Laura Bell Bundy as Amber, Kerry Butler as Penny, Linda Hart as Velma, Mary Bond Davis as Motormouth Maybelle, Corey Reynolds as Seaweed, Jackie Hoffman as Matron, Dick Latessa as Wilbur, and Clarke Thorell as Corny Collins. Kamilah Marshall, Shayna Steele, and Judine Richard played the Dynamites.\n\nHairspray received Tony Award nominations in 13 categories, winning eight, including for best musical, book, score and direction. Winokur, Fierstein and Latessa received awards for their performances. The production ran for more than six years, closing on January 4, 2009, after 2,642 performances.[2] Thorell returned to the cast for the final ten months. Fierstein and Winokur returned to the cast for the final performances.[9][10]\n\nOriginal London production\n\n[edit]\n\nThe West End production opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre on October 11, 2007, for previews before its official opening on October 30. Michael Ball played Edna, with Mel Smith as Wilbur Turnblad, Leanne Jones as Tracy, Tracie Bennett as Velma, Paul Manuel as Corny Collins, Rachael Wooding as Amber, Elinor Collett as Penny, and Ben James-Ellis as Link. The original creative team of the Broadway production, with the director Jack O'Brien and choreographer Jerry Mitchell, reunited for the London production.[11] The show garnered a record-setting 11 Olivier Award nominations[12] and won Best New Musical, as well as Best Actress and Actor in a musical (Jones and Ball).[13] The production closed on March 28, 2010, after nearly two and a half years and over 1,000 performances.[14]\n\n2021 London revival\n\n[edit]\n\nThe production was due to return to the West End at the London Coliseum for a limited 18-week season from 23 April to 29 August 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic caused all public theatres to close indefinitely in mid-March. The production was initially delayed to 1 September to 8 November,[15][16] and then delayed again to 21 June to 29 September 2021.[17]\n\nMichael Ball reprised his Olivier Award-winning role as Edna, reuniting him with director Jack O'Brien and choreographer Jerry Mitchell.[18] Full casting includes Lizzie Bea as Tracy, Marisha Wallace as Motormouth Maybelle, Les Dennis as Wilbur Turnblad, Rita Simons as Velma Von Tussle, Jonny Amies as Link Larkin, and Mari McGinlay as Penny Pingleton. Paul Merton was originally set to make his West End debut as Wilbur but after several delays he was unable to join the company and was replaced by Dennis.[19]\n\n2010 Australian production\n\n[edit]\n\nAn Australian production of Hairspray opened in Melbourne at the Princess Theatre on October 2, 2010, to critical acclaim.[20] It was directed by David Atkins and choreographed by So You Think You Can Dance Australia judge Jason Coleman.[21] The show moved to Sydney on June 23, 2011. The cast included Jaz Flowers as Tracy, Trevor Ashley as Edna, Jack Chambers as Link, and Tevin Campbell reprising his role from the Broadway production as Seaweed. Atkins redesigned the production using new technology.[22] The set used enormous LED screens that moved around the stage in various combinations as the characters interacted with animated landscapes generated across the screens.[23] The musical opened at Sydney's Lyric Theatre at The Star Casino on 11 June 2011 and closed on 25 September 2011, two weeks earlier than anticipated.\n\n2022 Australian Broadway revival\n\n[edit]\n\nA revival of the original Broadway production opened at Melbourne's Regent Theatre in August 2022, 20 years after the original production opened on Broadway.

The cast included Carmel Rodrigues as Tracy, Shane Jacobson as Edna, Rhonda Burchmore as Velma, Todd McKenney as Wilbur, Rob Mills as Corny Collins, and Asabi Goodman as Motormouth Maybelle.[24] The production moved on to Adelaide's Festival Centre in December 2022 where the role of Corny Collins was taken over by Irish born Australian, Bobby Fox.[25] The Adelaide production closed on 29 January 2023. The production then continued to Sydney's Lyric Theatre where it opened on 9 February 2024 and closed on 2 April 2024.\n\nTours\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first U.S. national tour started in September 2003 in Baltimore and ended in June 2006.[26] It starred Carly Jibson as Tracy, Bruce Vilanch as Edna, Terron Brooks as Seaweed, Sandra DeNise as Penny, Susan Cella as Velma, and Ramona Cole (soon replaced by Charlotte Crossley) as Motormouth Maybelle.[27] When the tour came to Los Angeles, Winokur reprised her role as Tracy, together with the original Broadway Link, Matthew Morrison. The same creative team of O'Brien and Mitchell was at the helm. Lon Hoyt served as music supervisor. Jim Vukovich served as music director for the entire 33 months on the road.[28]\n\nIn July 2006, a non-Equity U.S. and Asian tour opened in Atlantic City's Harrah's Casino.[29] The shorter \"casino version\" was used for a six-week run, but when the tour moved on,[30] it continued with the full version minus the character of Lorraine.

Tracy Turnblad, an overweight high school student, wakes up (\"Good Morning Baltimore\") and goes to school, where she receives a warning for \"inappropriate hair height\". After school, Tracy rushes home with her best friend, Penny, to catch the local teenage dance show, The Corny Collins Show (\"The Nicest Kids in Town\"). Edna, Tracy's shy and overweight mother, is ironing and complains about the noise of the music coming from the television, while Penny's mother, Prudy, complains about it being \"race music\". After an announcement that auditions for a place on the show will be held because Brenda (one of the Corny Collins Council Members) has taken a leave of absence from the show for \"nine months\", Tracy begs her mother for permission to audition. Fearing that Tracy will be laughed at due to her weight, Edna refuses. Penny and Amber (the main dancer on The Corny Collins Show) have similar arguments with their mothers (\"Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now\").\n\nAfter gaining permission and support from her father, Wilbur, Tracy auditions for the show and bumps into a teenage heartthrob, Link Larkin, which leads into a dream sequence (\"I Can Hear the Bells\"). Velma Von Tussle, the racist producer of The Corny Collins Show, rejects Tracy at the audition because of her size (\"(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs\"), and rejects a black girl, Little Inez.\n\nBack at school, Tracy is sent to detention for her \"monumental hair-don't\". There she meets black dancer Seaweed J. Stubbs (the son of the hostess of \"Negro Day\" on The Corny Collins Show, Motormouth Maybelle), who teaches her several dance moves. She uses the new dance steps at the Sophomore Hop the next day to introduce herself to Corny Collins (\"The Madison\"). After Corny sees Tracy dance, he gives her a place on the show (\"The Nicest Kids in Town\" (Reprise)). During the broadcast, Link, at Corny's suggestion, sings \"It Takes Two\" to Tracy, much to Amber's dismay. After the show, Mr. Spritzer, the show's worrisome sponsor, appeals to Velma over Tracy's appointment to the Council. Threatening to fire Corny from the show, Velma is eventually left distraught and determines to ruin Tracy (\"Velma's Revenge\").\n\nAt the Turnblad house, Edna is receiving calls from fans who saw Tracy on the show. A call comes in from Mr. Pinky, the owner of a plus-size dress shop, for an endorsement. Tracy pleads with her mother to come with her and to act as her agent although Edna has not left their apartment in years. Finally making it outside, Edna is given a huge makeover (\"Welcome to the 60's\") and Tracy becomes the shop's spokes-girl. At school, signs of Tracy's fame are evident in the schoolyard, with graffiti on the walls and Shelly, another Council Member, sporting Tracy's signature hairdo. During a game of dodgeball, a jealous Amber knocks Tracy out, and Link rushes to her side. Penny and Seaweed, who have developed a liking for each other, rush to fetch the school nurse, only to find her out sick. Seaweed, suggesting that some fun would make Tracy feel better, invites all of them to his mother's record shop for a platter party (\"Run and Tell That\").\n\nAt the shop, Tracy rallies everyone to march against the station on the following day's Mother-Daughter Day, as blacks are not allowed on the show except on the monthly Negro Day. Before they start, Motormouth Maybelle convinces the initially reluctant Edna and Wilbur to march as well. Link declined to participate for the sake of his contract with the show. During the protest, led by Motormouth, Velma calls the police and fights break out. When the police arrive on the scene, almost everyone is arrested (\"Big, Blonde and Beautiful\").\n\nAct II\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the march, most of the women are locked up in a women's penitentiary (\"The Big Dollhouse\"). Because of Velma's dirty tactics, the governor pardons and releases her and Amber. Wilbur bails out the rest, except Tracy, who is forced to remain in jail through another one of Velma's manipulations. Tracy is alone and wishes that Link could be with her (\"Good Morning Baltimore\" (Reprise)). Back at the Har-De-Har Hut (Wilbur's joke shop), Wilbur and Edna are left destitute because of the money it took to bail everyone out. Edna sympathizes with Tracy's dream—she had dreamed of making her \"own line of queen-sized dress patterns\". Edna and Wilbur reminisce about their past and how they can never be parted from each other (\"(You're) Timeless to Me\"). During the night, Link sneaks into the jail, where he finds Tracy in solitary confinement. As Link and Tracy reunite, Penny's mother, Prudy, punishes Penny for \"going to jail without her permission\" and ties her up in her bedroom, where Seaweed comes to her rescue. Both couples declare their love (\"Without Love\"). After escaping their respective prisons, the couples seek refuge at Motormouth Maybelle's Record Shop. Tracy thinks it unfair that after all their hard work, The Corny Collins Show is still segregated. They devise a plan to integrate the show, and Motormouth remembers their long fight for equality (\"I Know Where I've Been\").\n\nOn the day of the Miss Teenage Hairspray competition, Corny Collins starts the show with a song (\"(It's) Hairspray\"). Amber shows off her talents in a bid to get more votes from the viewers (\"Cooties\"). As the results are about to be announced, Tracy stuns Amber as she makes her entrance in a magenta dress without any petticoat underneath, taking over the stage, and is joined by Link, Penny, Seaweed, Edna, Wilbur, Little Inez, Corny, and Motormouth. Tracy is declared the winner of the competition. Amber and Velma protest the results, claiming that it is all wrong. Little Inez then tries to take the crown by force when Amber refuses to hand it over, but Tracy stops her, claiming that her heart is set on something more important: Link's and her future. She then proclaims The Corny Collins Show is \"now and forevermore\" racially integrated, to much applause. When all is announced, Spritzer runs onstage thrilled with the public's response to the telecast, announces that the governor has pardoned Tracy and given her a full college scholarship, and offers Link a recording contract and Velma the position of vice president of Ultra Glow – beauty products for women of color, much to her chagrin. Prudy arrives at the station and, seeing how happy Penny is with Seaweed, accepts her daughter for who she is. At the height of the moment, the company invites Amber and Velma to join the celebration. With the station in joyous celebration, Tracy and Link cement their love with a kiss (\"You Can't Stop the Beat\").\n\nCharacters\n\n[edit]\n\nPrincipal roles and casts of major productions of stage productions of Hairspray:\n\nCharacter Description Original Broadway cast Notable subsequent performers in noteworthy productions Tracy Turnblad The female lead of Hairspray.

In Seattle, an infomercial about safety on the road titled \"Blood on the Pavement\" followed \"The Nicest Kids in Town\", and is included on the cast album following \"You Can't Stop the Beat\". Early versions of the show featured \"Velma's Cha-Cha\" and \"The Status Quo\" (Seattle) (with its short reprise \"Rage\") during Tracy's audition and dismissal, but the team instead opted for \"(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs\".[65] After Tracy's rejection from the Council, there was a scene in the Har-De-Har Hut in which Wilbur tried to cheer Tracy up,[66] singing that \"It Doesn't Get Better than This\". Later replaced by the similar \"Positivity\", the scene was cut early in the Seattle tryout as it was deemed emotionally redundant.\n\nAfter Tracy eventually made it on the show, there was a song, \"The New Girl in Town\", sung first by the Councilettes and later by the Black girls. Although cut during the Seattle tryout, it was included in the 2007 film and appears in the show's instrumental score.[67] \"The Mother-Daughter Cha-Cha-Cha\" was another cut number that originally followed \"Big, Blonde, and Beautiful\". Later, the writers absorbed the protest rally and Mother-Daughter Day into the number, thus deleting the song and folding the sequence into a single scene.[68] A song called \"Step on Up\" was also cut in favor of \"I Know Where I've Been\".[69] Early on in the genesis of the show, the plot involved a \"Miss Auto Show\" competition, as in the 1988 film, instead of \"Miss Teenage Hairspray\". For this competition, later revised due to the cost of cars onstage, there was a song called \"Take a Spin\" sung by Corny in the place of \"(It's) Hairspray\".[70] After Amber's rendition of \"Cooties\", Tracy had a song before the finale, \"It Ain't Over 'Til the Fat Lady Sings\", that was cut after readings of the show; it was included as a track on the Special Edition of the 2007 motion picture's soundtrack.[71]\n\nInstrumentation and chorus\n\n[edit]\n\nHairspray's orchestration calls for 15 musicians: two keyboards, the first of which is played by the conductor, electric bass, two guitars, drums, percussion, two trumpets, trombone, two woodwind players, two violins, and cello. The guitarists both double on acoustic and electric guitars, with the first playing lead and the second rhythm, and the trumpet doubles on flugelhorn; the original production also featured a piccolo trumpet double during tryouts. The first woodwind player doubles on tenor and alto saxophones and flute. The second woodwind player doubles on tenor, alto, soprano and baritone saxophones and flute, while the backup chorus calls for three males and three females. [citation needed]\n\nIn the original Broadway production, a few of the actors mimed on musical instruments in order to fulfil a minimum musician requirement at the Neil Simon Theatre.[72]\n\nTouring productions often use smaller/reduced orchestrations to save on costs – the UK 2017/18 tour which used a 12-piece orchestration – two keyboards (Of which the first is played by the conductor), two guitars, electric bass, drums, percussion, two woodwind players (in which the second one is playing alto, tenor, soprano and baritone saxophones and flute), trombone and two trumpets and a 12-piece background chorus: six males and six females.[73]\n\nThemes\n\n[edit]\n\nHairspray explores racial prejudice and freedom of expression. It highlights individuality, and the importance of everyone working together for something to become revolutionary. The musical is empowering, as although it touches on racial issues prevalent in 1960s America, it focuses more on the associated attitudes, and the power we have to change discrimination.[74] The musical encourages individuality, acceptance and freedom. It applies to any social context and time, as it highlights ongoing issues such as fat-shaming, racism and discrimination.[75] It also explores femininity. Notably, Edna Turnblad is performed in drag. Allowing a drag role adds queerness to the musical, which has no gay characters.[76] Edna is considered to be the non-racialized who is part of the story.[77] The musical also challenges societal norms of femininity. Edna's body size emphasizes the show's diva roles.[76] The musical highlights female characters who are strong and associated with diva characteristics.\n\nHairspray emphasizes issues of acceptance and discrimination within society.[78] Set in the 1960s, it highlights racial discrimination against African-Americans during the Civil Rights Movement, with a focus on popular culture. The Civil Rights Movement gained African-Americans the right to vote, gave them a voice, and introduced freedom for all,[78] but African-Americans still experienced vast inequality during this time. This reality, of the whites holding all institutional and political power, is portrayed in Hairspray in The Corny Collins Show. African-Americans are allowed to dance on the show only once a month, and there is a stereotypical racial representation of dance style. The social representation in Hairspray parallels the reality of the 1960s. By the end of the show, African-Americans are allowed to dance on the show.[79] The show acknowledges the challenges and limitations enforced on African Americans during this time, and reminds audiences of the Civil Rights Movement's achievements. Its message can also be used to empower change for other forms of discrimination relevant in today’s society.[74]\n\nResponse\n\n[edit]\n\nCritics\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Variety, Hairspray received 13 favorable and four mixed reviews.[80] In his Variety review, Charles Isherwood wrote: \"this sweet, infinitely spirited, bubblegum-flavored confection won't be lacking for buyers any time soon. Arriving in an aerosol fog of advance hype, it more than lives up to its promise.\"[81] Ben Brantley wrote: \"So what if it's more than a little pushy in its social preaching? Stocked with canny, deliriously tuneful songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman and directed by Jack O'Brien with a common touch that stops short of vulgarity, 'Hairspray' is as sweet as a show can be without promoting tooth decay. ...[it] succeeds in recreating the pleasures of the old-fashioned musical comedy without seeming old-fashioned. ...Shaiman... is taking the infectious hooks and rhythms from period pop and R&B and translating them into the big, bouncy sound that Broadway demands.... And while the savvy arrangements... nod happily to Motown, Elvis, Lesley Gore ballads and standards like 'Higher and Higher', the score's appeal isn't nostalgic. It's music that builds its own self-contained, improbably symmetrical world\".[82] New York's Daily News wrote, \"As Tracy, Marissa Jaret Winokur has the heft, the pipes and an enormously appealing stage presence. Her dancing may not be as special as the plot suggests, but she wins your heart... With this role, Fierstein places himself in the great line of Broadway divas.\"[83]\n\nBox office and business\n\n[edit]\n\nHairspray opened with a $12 million advance; after the 2003 Tony Awards, it was expected to do five times the business it normally did on a Monday.[84] The entire $10.5 million investment was recouped by May 2003 (about nine months after it opened on Broadway).[85] In 2002–03 it averaged 99% capacity; in 2007 it averaged 86%.[86]\n\nAdaptations\n\n[edit]\n\nMain articles: Hairspray (2007 film) and Hairspray Live!\n\nA film version was released in July 2007. The film was directed and choreographed by Adam Shankman and starred John Travolta as Edna, Christopher Walken as Wilbur, Queen Latifah as Maybelle, Michelle Pfeiffer as Velma, James Marsden as Corny, and Nikki Blonsky as Tracy. Hugh Jackman and Joey McIntyre were also considered to play Corny.[87] NBC's Hairspray Live!, directed by Kenny Leon and Alex Rudzinski, aired in December 2016 to mostly positive reviews.[88]\n\nAwards and honors\n\n[edit]\n\nOriginal Broadway production\n\n[edit]\n\nSources: PlaybillVault;[89] Internet Broadway Database;[90] Playbill;[91] Playbill[92]\n\nYear Award Ceremony Category Nominee Result 2003 Tony Award Best Musical Won Best Original Score Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman Won Best Direction of a Musical Jack O'Brien Won Best Book of a Musical Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan Won Best Actor in a Musical Harvey Fierstein Won Best Actress in a Musical Marissa Jaret Winokur Won Best Featured Actor in a Musical Dick Latessa Won Corey Reynolds Nominated Best Choreography Jerry Mitchell Nominated Best Orchestrations Harold Wheeler Nominated Best Scenic Design David Rockwell Nominated Best Costume Design William Ivey Long Won Best Lighting Design Kenneth Posner Nominated Drama Desk Award Outstanding Musical Won Outstanding Book of a Musical Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan Won Outstanding Orchestrations Harold Wheeler Won Outstanding Actor in a Musical Harvey Fierstein Won Outstanding Actress in a Musical Marissa Jaret Winokur Won Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical Dick Latessa Won Corey Reynolds Nominated Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical Kerry Butler Nominated Outstanding Lyrics Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman Won Outstanding Music Marc Shaiman Won Outstanding Director Jack O'Brien Won Outstanding Choreography Jerry Mitchell Nominated Outstanding Set Design David Rockwell Nominated Outstanding Costume Design William Ivey Long Won Theatre World Award Jackie Hoffman Won Marissa Jaret Winokur Won\n\nOriginal London production\n\n[edit]\n\nSources: Playbill;[93] Playbill;[12] Olivier Awards[94] The Telegraph[95]\n\nYear Award Ceremony Category Nominee Result 2008 Laurence Olivier Award Best New Musical Won Best Actor in a Musical Michael Ball Won Best Actress in a Musical Leanne Jones Won Best Performance in a Supporting Role in a Musical Tracie Bennett Won Elinor Collett Nominated Best Director Jack O'Brien Nominated Best Theatre Choreographer Jerry Mitchell Nominated Best Set Design David Rockwell Nominated Best Costume Design William Ivey Long Nominated Best Lighting Design Kenneth Posner Nominated Best Sound Design Steve C.
