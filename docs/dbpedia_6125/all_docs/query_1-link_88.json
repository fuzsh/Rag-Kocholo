After a soft opening in Seattle in 2022, the show moved to Broadway where it scored a trio of Tony Awards. It also grabbed an Olivier award for best new musical following a 2007 run in London’s West End.\n\nHairspray recounts the story of sixteen year-old Tracy Turnblad, a headstrong teen with mile high hair and a dream to dance her way onto WYZT’s the Corny Collins Show. Some of her classmates are already cast on the program and are nothing short of high school royalty.\n\nBut landing a gig on the popular teen TV show is no easy feat in the competitive rock ‘n’ roll world of 1962 Baltimore.\n\nWinning the Miss Teenage Hairspray competition on the program can launch showbiz careers and caustic classmates, conniving parents, creepy Collins and bad values of the day put up walls against Tracy and her friends. Before the adventure is over, these teens will take on segregation, society and more to shake, rattle and roll their way to success.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nBroadway Across Canada’s touring production of Hairspray comes to the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in Vancouver in April. This all-new version reunited the original creative team of director Jack O’Brien and choreographer Jerry Mitchell. Caroline Eiseman will appear as Tracy Turnblad with Canadian veteran Emmanuelle Zeesman in the ominously-titled ‘female authority figure’ Prudy Pingleton as well as a few other cameos.\n\n“I was eight years old when the 2007 musical version of John Waters’ film came out and it marked kind of a cultural landmark for me and musicals, and I watched it a lot over the years,” says Eisemen. “I didn’t see the original film until I was auditioning for the show, but one of the great things about it is that it works for all ages. Kids love the singing, dancing and spectacle while adults are sure to catch some of the raunchier John Waters jokes that are included.”\n\nReviewers have noted that the show is a marathon for the cast and particularly for the Turnblad character. Eiseman says that she trained hard to be ready to resume the role and be ready to tear it up in numbers such as the Madison and the massive finale You Can’t Stop the Beat, which cast have dubbed ‘You Can’t Stop to Breathe.’\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I joined in the summer of 2022 as a standby, so I knew what I was getting into after that run,” she said. “There was a seven week break before the new year and I hit the gym hard keeping up my cardio, stamina and such because there is no rest for the wicked. A lot more than I ever anticipated goes into being Tracy, because she is movin’ and groovin’ the whole time.”\n\nMoving and grooving to Jerry Mitchell’s “highly aerobic” choreography is a far cry from the standard musical’s variety of a fast number here, a slow dance there. Hairspray is set in the high-octane world of early sixties sock hops, blazing rock ‘n’ roll and R&B music and not very many ballads. It’s very high-energy.\n\nMontreal-born, Ottawa-raised Emmanuelle Zeesman has family in Vancouver and is excited to be performing in town again. It’s her third season touring with the show.\n\n“I haven’t left because I love it, simply put,” said Zeesman. “My role lets me make use of my background in improv and clowning as well as scat singing every night. By the time the confetti cannons are going off at the end, my horrible, racist character has changed her mind and the crowd is on its feet and it’s just fantastic.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nZeesman says that, with its underlying topics of racism, LGBTQ2SI+ characters and community action for change, Hairspray has maintained its relevance through the years. Not only is it incredibly catchy, but lyrics such as “I’ll eat some breakfast now and change the world” resonate in the real world. It’s a show you can sing to yourself for inspiration.\n\n“My dream as a child was to perform in all Canadian provinces as well as the territories and never leave,” she said. “I spent a lot of years acting in Ottawa and waited until my daughter finished high school before my husband and I moved to the U.S. Now he is the merchandising manager on the show, so we get to tour together which is pretty perfect.”\n\nEiseman will tour as Tracy until this July and says it takes a special personality to live out of a suitcase for years at a time. She admits to loving her things and her clothes closet, but has learned to make her hotel room feel like home wherever she checks-in. Touring Hairspray is ‘chaotic’ but she loves the show.\n\n“Only twenty minutes into it, Tracy has her swan song intro with I Can Hear the Bells and I cherish getting to sing it every night,” she said. “I also have the best seat in the house to watch my peers tell their stories when I’m onstage during the numbers where I don’t sing. Plus, we have a fantastic seven-piece live band of the most talented human beings working with us as well.”\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThis enables a bit of improvisation to makes its way into performances when it suits the players, with Eiseman noting that the sax player was tossing in snippets of Christmas carols during solos around the holidays. It all contributes to the fun vibe.\n\nAs for what she plans to do when Tracy lets down her hair at the end of the run, Eiseman says she’s open to anything.\n\n“I love this art form and hope to do it as long as I can,” she said. “I didn’t even have the chance to move to New York before the tour started, so that will be next and then I’d like to work on Broadway, tour again and — of course — originate a role.”\n\nAmong favourite films she would love to see adapted and get to perform in would be the Princess Diaries from 2001.\n\nsderdeyn@postmedia.com\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nBroadway Across Canada announces new season with 7 productions for Vancouver\n\nSpring 2024 Preview: The must-see Vancouver concerts, plays to catch and B.C. books to read\n\nBookmark our website and support our journalism: Don’t miss the news you need to know — add VancouverSun.com and TheProvince.com to your bookmarks and sign up for our newsletters here.\n\nYou can also support our journalism by becoming a digital subscriber: For just $14 a month, you can get unlimited access to The Vancouver Sun, The Province, National Post and 13 other Canadian news sites.
