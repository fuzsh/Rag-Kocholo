        "text": "For as seemingly iconic it has become, and for as infectiously its songs worm their way through your ears, I have never been a fan of the movie GREASE. I believe its origins began as something of substance but generations of misunderstanding have watered it down into something completely flavorless. The original play is more akin to the work of John Waters than what the movie and its legacy ultimately made it become. There was real comedy in the original play of GREASE surrounding the idea that these wholesome teens of this beloved era were actually a bunch of sex crazed deviants and jerks. GREASE was a parody of 50's nostalgia, not a celebration of it. It pointed out the silliness and banality of absurd dances of the day, like a \"Hand Jive,\" and made fun of empty meaningless lyrics like \"Rama Lama Lama Ka Dinga Da Dinga Dong.\" I believe that some of GREASE's songs were intentionally written to be bad songs, or at the very least, cute songs that were still making fun of how bad songs of their ilk were. It makes me think of the way Trey Parker and Robert Lopez wrote songs for \"The Book of Mormon/\" They're simultaneously celebrating various genres and tropes of musical theater, while also sending them up and turning them on their ear. The fact that GREASE is now looked at an affectionate look at the charming innocence of the 50's is unfortunate, but I think it's even beginning to move beyond that. Kids today don't even see this as commentary at all of a specific era of 50's rock music, they just see it as a movable and universal portrayal of a past generation. This might be why productions you see now, (that live abomination on television last year, for example), feel like they might as well just be a musical of \"Saved By the Bell.\" It's just a general view of \"teenagers who aren't of the current generation,\" using that as an excuse to portray some bad behavior that doesn't quite live up to our modern ideals but in a neutered relatable way. Now that is the extreme of what I believe GREASE has become, but this movie is a bit better than that. John Travolta shows a kind of star power in this movie that you won't find matched by many young celebrities of today. I appreciate the sprinkling of former 50's icons in the cast, (Eve Arden, Joan Blondell, Sid Caesar), to lend the film some comedy and credibility. And yes, some of those songs, even and especially the bad ones, can remain in your head for weeks after a single viewing. I somewhat envy Adam for having recently seen the film with a packed audience, because I can imagine that such an experience would effectively work some magic on me and fill me with an infectious group enthusiasm, but with my last experience with the film being in my living room, I just didn't feel the love.\n\nAnd so I'm going to be voting for HAIRSPRAY to be admitted into The Canon. Since we already have FEMALE TROUBLE inducted, I would love to get the other side of the John Waters coin to be let in. The debate over the camp factor somewhat surprised me, because I don't think there's such a strict definition that doesn't allow elements of it to be featured in both of Waters' styles. To me, early films like FEMALE TROUBLE, POLYESTER, and MULTIPLE MANIACS have more of a camp edge because its presenting characters that Waters and him movie world clearly love, but they're almost daring the audience to hate. They're showing fringe characters in a way that one would expect to be making fun of, but instead is an affectionate celebration. To me, HAIRSPRAY is a more sincere effort than that. Aside from the cynically villainous Arvin Hodgepile and the Von Tussle clan, there seems to be no suggestion of characters that we're not supposed to dislike or find unsympathetic. Waters is presenting us with characters usually relegated to background extras in these genres (fat people and minorities) and putting them in the foreground and showing their humanity. It still devastates me that Divine never lived to make another film, because this was a whole new side of her persona. Even past all of the social messages and integration idealism, this is such a wonderful mother/daughter story. What if the mean mother who stood in the way of your fantastical dreams became an active participant in achieving those dreams? I love her and Ricki Lake's relationship in this movie. It's also worth pointing out that like GREASE, HAIRSPRAY too has evolved and been embraced by a new generation. Frankly, I think that HAIRSPRAY (at least within the generation of high school musicals) is beginning to eclipse GREASE a bit, helped by is progressive and positive messages that end with a climax that isn't a sexual one. It's no coincidence that both musical adaptations aired live on television in the same year. But John Waters gives a big stamp of approval on his musical adaptation, which I feel keeps true to the spirit of its original creator. It doesn't shy away from the ugliness of Waters' filthy view of Baltimore, but still manages to celebrate it. It may not match the purity of the original, but at least this new generation is continuing to celebrate its legacy while focusing on the specifics of what made its roots so unique and personal to Waters. GREASE has obviously made the bigger cultural splash and is probably an inevitable addition to The Canon, but GREASE had a head start and I think its brightness is starting to fade. There are still young people everywhere who feel a bit different and outside of societal cliques who are discovering John Waters as their alternative teen angel. He certainly was mine. I vote enthusiastically for HAIRSPRAY!\n\nHere's why I think Sandy was wearing shiny disco pants in a 50's themed movie:\n\nFifties nostalgia was huge in the 1970s. I was in the Brownies when Happy Days came out and too young for American Graffiti. But it was big among slightly older kids and it stuck. When we had a school function with some kind of theme it was likely to be Fifties themed so we could wear poodle skirts and saddle shoes.\n\nDisco was around and getting popular before Saturday Night Fever. I was in junior high when Saturday Night Fever (and Grease) were released as films. We were too young to see SNF but we knew the soundtrack. The two soundtracks were the most played albums among my friends. And you were as sure to want to try to do the moves to Greased Lightning as you were to try to hustle. It's crazy that the movies came out close together because I feel like Grease was influenced by SNF -- probably the Alan Carr influence? Less so Robert Stigwood (remember Sgt. Pepper's -- I never saw it). I think Grease the film wasn't the product of thoughtful artists but rather a conglomeration of things that were working well at the time, designed to make money, and it succeeded wildly by that measure. SNF is huge. Take some of that and make a film that kids can see. You have the Fifties nostalgia, buy the rights to a popular musical, and when Sandy goes bad she turns into a 70s disco queen, even though it makes no sense in that movie. I know there wasn't a lot of time between the movies but the same producers -- they had to be thinking about how they could get a little disco glam in Grease. I had friends who sadly bought those pants (no one had Olivia Newton John's waist), to be worn with a slim belt that looked like shiny gold scales but was actually plastic. And we all bought Candies shoes that looked like hers, which were a fad like jellies or crocs would be later. Wildly inappropriate clothing to wear to junior high dances but we did. And then came Thank God It's Friday and then Can't Stop the Music -- by then he disco craze was dying and the movie was horrible. I think the characters are cartoons because that's the point.\n\nAnd maybe I misunderstood the podcast but that hot dog film at the drive in is the retro one that really played at drive ins for years.\n\nI agree with others that this was a frustrating episode to listen to, though that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. The frustration for me came because I don't love Grease as much as Adam does, nor do I hate it as much as Amy does, and I don't love Hairspray as much as Amy does, while still disagreeing with some of the faults Adam found in it.\n\nOverall, I found myself agreeing with Adam more. Hairspray definitely has that distinctly John Waters camp to it, and like Adam, I don't think that's a bad thing. However, I see Amy's point that it does have a different feel than many of his other films, because it has a more clear point of view and uses Waters' cutting wit only against the racist characters, as mentioned by sycasey 2.0 and others. While there are still jokes at the other characters's expenses, it feels much more like we're laughing with them than at them. Contrast that with Female Trouble, where every single character is a joke and the film is almost daring you to sympathize with any of them so that you can be the butt of the joke too. So while the camp elements are still there in Hairspray, they are deployed in a much different (and more digestible, in my opinion) manner.\n\nI also agree with Adam that it's not super fair to compare these two films just on the basis that they have similar time frame and plot elements. That'd be like comparing Tropic Thunder to the documentary Hearts of Darkness: both are films about the struggles of making a Vietnam War film, but they are so different in their goals and themes and executions that to say that one is better than the other feels silly. 1988's Hairspray is not a musical, and to put it up against a musical means you aren't putting it just up against a particular film, but up against the whole genre of musicals, which some people just hate. So while the people who think one of these movies is good and the other is bad won't have any problem making their decision in this versus, the people who think both are fine examples of what they're trying to be are going to have trouble deciding what makes one more Canon-worthy than the other.\n\nNow, I have a long relationship with Grease, as it was the musical that got my little sister interested in musicals, which resulted in her constantly singing lyrics like \"lousy with virginity\" at the age of 6 around family friends and embarrassing my parents. She watched this film dozens of times in those years, which means I probably saw it at least five or six times in that span (as well as The Music Man and all the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical films). And perhaps because of that, I think most of the songs are genuinely great, and I can't understand Amy's dislike of them (except that Los Angeles karaoke is a bit of a shitshow with way too many people taking it way too seriously, and I could imagine that a romantic couple singing \"Summer Nights\" sincerely would be a drag. Having done \"Summer Nights\" at karaoke solely with platonic friends or my sister and solely comedically, I've always thought it's a solid standard in the vein of \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" or \"I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That)\" in that it's cliche and overdone, but it's overdone because it's good. I have a lot of feelings about karaoke.) So I very much enjoy most of the songs, even as I've always been a little horrified by the climactic plot turn by Sandy.\n\nBut here's where one of my own personal Canon philosophies is going to come out: I don't think that a film based on a book or play or another film deserves to make the Canon unless it adds something special and new, be it technical aspects, great performances, or a new plot twist. So with that in mind, I don't care about the plot of Grease and I don't care about most of the songs in Grease, at least in the discussion of its Canon-worthiness. Unfortunately, that's really all that Adam talked about, with the exception of his defense of a couple nice camera shots. So what did the film add? As far as I can remember, the songs in the film that weren't in the original stage musical are \"Grease\" (which I think is pretty terrible), \"Sandy\" (which isn't a great song, although like Adam, I love the 50s movie ad hot dog in the background), \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" (which I'm not a fan of), and \"You're the One That I Want\" (which I think is legitimately great). The film added the racing scene, which apes Ben-Hur, and adds little more substance than that, though I always loved driving over the section of the Los Angeles River where it was filmed. I honestly don't know how much of the choreography was original and how much was derived from the stage version. Certainly some of the \"Greased Lightning\" choreography has become iconic, and I think the dancing in \"You're the One That I Want\" and \"Hand Jive\" is great too. (Amy mentioned that she felt that the movie ground to a halt during \"Hand Jive\", but I felt that way during every single shot of dancing in Hairspray that lasts more that 5 seconds. In particular, that line-dancing scene early in the film seems to go on forever, and it's the same boring moves over and over again.) Finally, there aren't many pieces of camerawork that are noteworthy. Adam mentioned the scene where Rizzo reveals her pregnancy and we see the gossip spread, and that's a fun little bit, but nothing special in my opinion. The most unique (for good and bad) shot is probably the final shot of the car flying away, which has been parodied many times since. I've always thought that last second dive into surreality was more of a bug than a feature, as if it was thrown in as an afterthought to give viewers a look at something they couldn't see in the stage play. So all in all, while there's no doubt that the musical Grease belongs in the Canon of all-time classic and influential musicals, I don't see enough here to say that the film Grease belongs in the Canon of all-time classic and influential films.\n\nMeanwhile, Hairspray is great. I'll also mention that the musical version of Hairspray is also great, and I find those songs to be spectacular as well. Putting Grease up against the 2007 Hairspray would have been a much more interesting battle, since both are actually musicals and both have Travolta at the two bookends of his career relevance.\n\nI would have voted for Hairspray in a solo episode anyway, and I think Amy is putting her thumb on the scale a bit to ensure it gets in by making it a versus episode against a love-it-or-hate-it film in a love-it-or-hate-it genre, but I'll vote for it nonetheless. However, my big regret from this episode is that Adam didn't get to talk about Persona. Almost 200 different films have been debated on The Canon, but not a single Bergman! Someone needs to do Persona!\n\nWhile I will always applaud Grease for being a fun movie designed to make you feel good, it is a no for the Canon. As a 12 year old in 1978, Grease just felt like a sitcom or variety show. It was so smart to cast Travolta and Olivia Newton John, to ensure maximum star appeal. I think this might be why it falls flat for me. That and the anachronistic music written for it. In 1978 it lacked sticking power with me and watching it now, it feels uneven and clumsy, In the current issue of Smithsonian Magazine, Holly Millea wrote a piece about the 40th anniversary of Grease and she noted that Pauline Kael referred to Grease as a “Klutzburger”. I get it.\n\nHairspray is an emphatic YES!! At the risk of allowing the Personal Fallacy of criticism run rampant in my adoration of Hairspray, I can’t cloak the fact that I am a Baltimoron. I’m even an extra in CryBaby.\n\nWith that out of the way, I will argue that Hairspray is written, shot and edited better than Grease. It is considerably funnier AND still manages to have a social conscience as it uses the civil rights movement as a tool to create growth and change in its’ characters.\n\nWe all know that racism is abhorrent and destructive. It is also stupid, silly and ridiculous! Waters proves this when Penny Pingleton’s Mom, Prudence is perfectly portrayed by JoAnn Havrilla is searching for Penny in West Baltimore and is relieved to find a police car only to discover the the officer in it is Black. That reaction shot, photographed from the officers’ PIV is Priceless!! I’ve seen Hairspray in a crowded theater and in living rooms and that shot always creates howls of laughter! Hysterical Racism is Hysterical!\n\nI respect Mr. Mortimer’s thoughts and opinions and he is a great foil, but he seemed to argue that Hairspray is inauthentic. In that he is incorrect. He mentioned garishly decorated houses that defied reality. I bought my house here in Baltimore in 2012 and when my wife and I were looking at houses, we were happily astonished that so many Baltimore houses with long time owners were packed with tchotchkes, shag carpeting on the walls and seizure-inducing wall paper.\n\nAlso, my Mom’s generation did grow up onThe Buddy Deane show. When she was a girl she asked my grandmother if she could take dancing lessons. My Nanny shut this down, noting my Mothers’ chubbiness. Years later, my Mom finally took dance lessons and won some in - studio competitions. Take that, Nanny!\n\nMy Aunt Colleen, also a member of this generation had a best friend named Pat Pilkerton. Not quite Penny Pingleton, but you get my drift.\n\nFinally, when Tracy, Link, Seaweed & Penny go to Motormouth Maybelle’s record store, they take the North Avenue bus. Tracy notes that she’s “never been in this part of town before “ North and Pennsylvania Avenues have served as a Nexus of Black Culture and African -American history in Baltimore for decades. One need only review the footage of the unrest following the death Freddie Gray to see that the nightly standoff’s between the citizens and Baltimore Police Department are occurring at North and Pennsylvania Avenues. It speaks to the distance between White and Black communities then and now. John Waters packed Hairspray with authenticity and is indeed the most complete work of this Auteur. Now if only I can come on the show and argue for Desperate Living, which is actually the funniest Waters film and is most definitely, Camp,\n\nwhen is saw the epp title i was pissed. i was all, NOOOOO — i love both these movies! you can't battle these two!!!\n\nbut i ended up coming fairly squarely with an unconflicted vote decision. even after the prickly conversation.\n\nmeanwhile, lukewarm take: this was the wrong pairing. it shoulda been grease vs hairspray (2007). these are parallel. similar trajectories toward their screen versions, starting from something great, getting watered down audience-friendlied by committee, both with original music, and there's travolta to tie them together.\n\nbut the movies we're actually dealing with? on the surface they're a pair. but... it's been said above all the ways they aren't. i'm gonna set that aside and deal with them individually i guess.\n\nmy big revelation on this is that as much as i love grease, it is actually a big mess in a tangle, held together by really, really fun music that allows you to excuse a lot of shortcomings. and that if it weren't for having seen it in the 70s and glommed onto it in my youth, maybe i wouldn't really hold it in regard. many of what adam was pointing out as thematic mileposts in it, and how disparate they were, i kept thinking, yeah, you can see that in the movie, and i guess you can put them together to interpret something out of it too, but you can also find the same number of other elements and put them together differently and get something else entirely. but that's what happens with messes. it has a little something for everyone and if (the music keeps you plugged in) you sort through them and come up with something. and you're still left to deal with all the WTFs by either excusing or ignoring them (sandy's vamp look, disco themesong for a 50s movie, just examples). as for it being a genre-defining moment... yeah, squinting i can see that? but as a musical movie in the late 70s... it still falls somewhere between the wiz and rocky horror, and all three of these clearly beneath the muppet movie.\n\nfull disclosure, i took my SATs at rydell high and was well aware of it walking up the front steps. though they were calling it venice high school that day.\n\nhairspray tho! totally one of my favorite movies. saw it again about two weeks ago. it has intent. it's way funny. it has amazing, if not forgotten at least under-played, music. all sorts of winking cameos. it's coherent. it's delightful. it deals with unusual topics. and has a great message (which, btw, i take it to be more about tracy's development than about social justice — she's going through her journey toward an identity and desegregation happens to be her movie-ending conflict. like, we wouldn't say rocky is about boxing championship matches, it's about rocky. but yes, we can't deny that journey leans on social justice from a POV of white protagonism, even if it's ruth brown teaching the white children how to do the bird). so that's my vote. greasagation never! hairspraycanonization now!!\n\nand... YES AMY, it is camp. i mean, just try and say \"our little tracy's a clean teen\" in any way that isn't campy... IT CAN'T BE DONE! and i wonder if you are resisting this because it sounds like a dismissal or something that lessens the artistic value, which it doesn't.\n\nalso full disclosure, my cat's name is penny. and i often tell her she's permanently, positively punished. (it does no good.)"
