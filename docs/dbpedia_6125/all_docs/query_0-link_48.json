        "text": "Nah - he's still outrageous. But the movie musical may be the filmmaker's most mainstream moment.\n\nHairspray, the big-bucks musical version of the 1988 musical parody of the 1960s, opens Friday at the local multiplex, proving that the Pop Culture Photocopier never wears out.\n\nIt also proves, I suppose, that artistic outlaws, if they hang around long enough, will get promoted to beloved, if eccentric, icons.\n\nForty-odd years ago, John Waters - who filmed the original Hairspray - was getting arrested with his cohorts for indecent exposure in Baltimore (for filming a topless orgy scene on the Johns Hopkins campus without permission).\n\nWaters' 1972 opus Pink Flamingos was denounced by Variety as \"one of the most vile, stupid and repulsive films ever made.\"\n\nNow, Hairspray is being treated as a sort of sacred text, and Waters himself has assumed the avuncular, slightly ooky mantle of Alfred Hitchcock. Like Hitchcock, he's turned to playing a TV host, introducing episodes of the cheesy Canadian crime drama Till Death Do Us Part on CourtTV under the persona of \"The Groom Reaper.\" (See, each week, another marriage ends in homicide, and …)\n\nBy the way, mark your calendars for Nov. 2: That's the evening Thalian Hall Center for the Performing Arts has booked \"An Evening With John Waters,\" with the filmmaker in the flesh, onstage, offering commentary - catty, no doubt - on a film-clip retrospective of his career. (Check www.thalianhall.com for more details, closer to the date.)\n\nWaters shows up in the new Hairspray in a brief cameo as the friendly neighborhood flasher. Other original Hairspray actors also have bit parts in the remake, including Ricki Lake, who grabbed her first toehold on celebrity playing the plus-sized teen Tracy Turnblad, and Jerry Stiller, who played Tracy's dad.\n\nOf course, a few of the original stars can't come back. Divine, the 300-or-so-pound transvestite who played Tracy's mom, died in 1988 at the age of 43. (His part is taken by John Travolta under four hours' worth of makeup and padding.)\n\nGone, also, is Sonny Bono, the rocker-turned-Republican congressman who played the father of Tracy's vicious, bigoted little rival for high school popularity. (Amber Von Tussle's conniving mom was played by Deborah Harry, another rocker, the first time around; this time, the role goes to Michelle Pfeiffer.)\n\nI'm not sure how the new movie can stand up to the original. For one thing, the director, Adam Shankman, has a reputation for churning out routine, by-the-numbers Hollywood fare (The Wedding Planner, Cheaper By the Dozen 2).\n\nWaters could do bland, of course, but when he did, he was being ironic.\n\nAt the same time, Waters - born on April 22, 1946 - is very much a child of the 1950s, the '50s that didn't really end until the Beatles hit the U.S. charts in late 1963. Sure, he can treat the era with a smirk and a poke in the ribs, but the love is still there.\n\nCry-Baby (1990), his movie with Johnny Depp, knowingly sends up all those \"Troubled Teen Delinquent\" movies that used to star James Dean or a very young Elvis. Serial Mom (1994), starring Kathleen Turner as a Happy Homemaker/thrill killer, is many things, but among these is a knowing parody of the soapy big-screen melodramas that Douglas Sirk used to shoot. (It's actually more on the mark, I think, than Todd Haynes' Oscar-nominated period piece Far From Heaven, with Julianne Moore.)\n\nHairspray (1988), however, is the one Waters hit out of the park. It's set in his hometown of Baltimore during the early years of the civil rights era.\n\nHairspray's subject, meanwhile, is a forgotten TV genre, the \"Teen Dance Party.\" Most people remember American Bandstand, or think they do, but other versions with a similar format aired on local TV stations all across the country. (Growing up in the orbit of Raleigh, I used to watch Teenage Frolics on WRAL.)\n\nIt really was an issue, for a while, whether black kids would be allowed on these dance shows - though, of course, white kids were stealing African-American dance moves all the time.\n\nIn real life, desegregation led to white flight; within a couple of years, all the teens on Teenage Frolics were black, and it became a sort of suburban Soul Train. In Waters' universe, however, diversity prevails and all sorts of human differences (including, without anyone saying so, The Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name) are cheerfully tolerated.\n\nWhat a long, strange trip. Waters started out as strictly Underground with a capital U - so far Underground, he made Andy Warhol look like Daryl Zanuck.\n\nWaters recruited a circle of pranksters and misfits, and one of his key collaborators was his high school buddy Harris Glen Milstead, who generally performed in drag as \"Divine.\"\n\nBy 1972, the group had churned out Eat Your Makeup, Mondo Trasho, Multiple Maniacs and The Diane Linkletter Story, with Waters generally as screenwriter, cinematographer and editor as well as director. They topped themselves that year, though, with Pink Flamingos, a loosely plotted saga about trailer-park trash.\n\nThe real point was to offend as many sensibilities as possible, and Waters largely succeeded. Divine, as Babs Johnson, pretty much clinched the title of \"Filthiest Person Alive\" by eating poodle poop (to the tune of How Much is That Doggie in the Window?).\n\nNothing succeeds like excess, and within a few years Divine was co-starring with a real '50s heartthrob, Tab Hunter, in Waters' Polyester.\n\n\"John was a carnival ringmaster,\" Hunter wrote in his autobiography, Tab Hunter Confidential, \"mixing and matching all sort of people from different backgrounds, different generations, different genders.\"\n\nAnd like most circuses, the result was usually a lot of fun.\n\nhollywood east fades to black\n\nIn pacem requiesat: Apparently, the Hollywood East Cinema Grill is no more.\n\nThe three-screen, second-run theater at Long Leaf Mall, which offered \"dinner and a movie\" in one location, closed down indefinitely in June. Now, co-owners Mark and Alane Nebbia have posted a notice at the Hollywood East Web site that they're seeking buyers. Unless one shows up this week, the theater is to be put up for auction Tuesday.\n\nThe Nebbias had taken over Hollywood East in January and had invested heavily in renovating the former twin-screen establishment, closed by Carmike in 1996 after 23 years of operation. Sandra Jackson and partner Mike Carillo had launched Hollywood East in 2001 as a combination theater-restaurant complex, modeled on a similar establishment in Raleigh that Jackson had visited during Hurricane Bonnie.\n\nBen Steelman: 343-2208\n\nben.steelman\n\n@starnewsonline.com."
