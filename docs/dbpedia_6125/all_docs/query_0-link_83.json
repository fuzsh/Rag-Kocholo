        "text": "Musical Theater is a style that began in America and is an essential part of a high schooler’s music education. It’s a fun part, as well! I have chosen some musicals for high school to enjoy that have been made into film versions. If you can see these live, though, do it! Enjoy 15 Must-See Movie Musicals for High School Students. (The dates listed below are when the films were released, not when the musical was first performed.)\n\nDisclosure: I get commissions for purchases made through affiliate links in this post.\n\nSinging in the Rain\n\nThe Story: Don Lockwood (an actor) and Cosmo (his musical friend) are working in silent movies in the 1920’s when “talkies” suddenly come on the scene.

When Tony and Maria fall in love, the hatred and fighting between the two gangs escalates until a tragic ending occurs. (The themes in West Side Story make it more appropriate for older teens.)\n\nFamous Song: “America” (1961)\n\n**There is a new movie version of West Side Story that came out in December 2021. Have you seen it? Did you like it? Please leave a comment below!\n\nSeven Brides for Seven Brothers\n\nThe Story: When Adam heads into town to get a bride, he finds Milly who is willing to go back with him.

Please share in the comments!\n\nWhy I Choose These Musicals for High School\n\nSeveral have asked my criteria for choosing the musicals I did for this list. Let me tell you first the perspective I am coming from. I have performed in musicals myself, been a music teacher for over 20 years, have teens (and younger kids) who perform in musicals, and am a musical director of a big Christian musical theater company in our area. My goal with this list is to entertain as well as educate. I did choose some musicals that are “drivel” as one lady described them. 🙂 High School Musical, White Christmas, and Bye Bye Birdie do not have much value as far as musicality and even the story themes go. But, they are fun!\n\nOthers, such as Into the Woods, but are part of the popular musical theater culture of America at this time, so I see those as valuable for education. Some of the musicals have very heavy themes, such as Les Miserables, Hairspray, and West Side Story, but those are important for their themes of recognizing hatred and evil and choosing to overcome it with forgiveness and/or acceptance. I chose Pirates of Penzance and Phantom of the Opera because they are musicals which have withstood the test of time. (Phantom of the Opera is the longest continually-running musical on Broadway.) If you have any other questions or concerns, please send me a message (through the contact form) or leave a comment!\n\nBonus:\n\nI’m updating this popular post to include Hamilton because it’s now on my list for Must-See Movie Musicals for High School Students. See a 15-Minute Music Lesson about Hamilton the Musical here, and see Hamilton the Musical Projects for Teens here.\n\nI also have a Music and Fine Arts membership with a masterclass called Hamilton the Musical: How and Why it Became a Sensation! by Gena Mayo.\n\nBe sure to get on the waitlist so you can join the membership when it opens up again!\n\nRelated Posts:"
