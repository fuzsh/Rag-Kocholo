        "text": "2007 soundtrack album by Various artists/John Travolta\n\nHairspray: Soundtrack to the Motion Picture is the soundtrack album for the 2007 New Line Cinema musical film Hairspray. The film is an adaptation of the 2002 Broadway musical of the same name, itself adapted from John Waters's original 1988 film. It features performances from the film's cast, which includes John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Amanda Bynes, James Marsden, Queen Latifah, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron, Elijah Kelley, and Nikki Blonsky as the lead character of Tracy Turnblad.\n\nThe album has sold upwards of 1,200,000 copies in the USA, and has been certified Platinum by the RIAA.[1]\n\nProfessional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllmusic[2]The News & Observer[3]\n\nThe soundtrack received positive reviews from critics.\n\nThe soundtrack contains nineteen songs from the film written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, three of which were not included in the stage musical version. Shaiman, who produced the original cast album for the Broadway musical, produced the songs for the film musical as well. Hairspray's music is written and performed to conform to the story's 1962 setting, with influences spanning the genres of rock and roll, soul, and pop.\n\n\"Ladies' Choice\", a new song performed by Zac Efron, was the Hairspray soundtrack's first single. iTunes released the single on May 15, 2007. The iTunes version of the album includes bonus features such as the bonus track \"I Can Wait\" (a song written for the film but cut), the \"Ladies' Choice\" music video, an instructional dance video for \"Ladies' Choice\", and a digital version of the album booklet. The soundtrack debuted on the Billboard 200 at number 20 and peaked at number two.\n\n\"The New Girl in Town\", \"Big, Blonde and Beautiful (Reprise)\", and \"Come So Far (Got So Far to Go)\" are the three songs new to this version of Hairspray, although \"The New Girl in Town\" was originally written for but dropped from the Broadway production. \"Come So Far (Got So Far to Go)\" is played over the film's end credits, as are renditions of two songs from the stage musical which were not included in the film proper: \"Cooties\" and \"Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now\". \"Cooties\" is performed on the soundtrack in a contemporary pop style by singer Aimee Allen. It was also played (without vocals) during the Miss Teenage Hairspray pageant. \"Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now\", is performed by each of the three women most famous portraying Hairspray's main character, Tracy Turnblad: the 1988 film's Ricki Lake, the Broadway production's Marissa Jaret Winokur, and this film's Nikki Blonsky. Harvey Fierstein, who played Edna in the original Broadway production, also has a vocal cameo at the end of the track.\n\nSeveral of the songs from the Broadway musical had their lyrics altered and/or verses removed for use in the film version. These songs include \"(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs\", \"Welcome to the 60s\", \"Big, Blonde and Beautiful\", \"Without Love\", \"(It's) Hairspray\", \"You Can't Stop the Beat\", et cetera.\n\nIn 2016, a vinyl edition of the album was released and sold at numerous retailers to coincide with the release of Hairspray Live!.\n\nA limited edition two-disc version of the Hairspray soundtrack was released on November 20, 2007, the same day as the film's DVD/Blu-ray release. The 2-disc Collector's edition soundtrack includes the one-disc soundtrack, as well as a second disc featuring additional songs from the film, deleted songs (among them \"I Can Wait\"), demo recordings, and karaoke versions of certain songs. The album debuted at number 90 on the Billboard 200 with sales of at least 20,000 copies sold.\n\nAlthough included in the movie, \"The Nicest Kids in Town (Reprise)\" (performed by James Marsden and the Council Members) and \"Tied Up in the Knots of Sin\" (performed by composer Marc Shaiman and director Adam Shankman) were not included on the motion picture soundtrack.\n\nNikki Blonsky as Tracy Turnblad (also additional voices on 4, 9)\n\nJames Marsden as Corny Collins\n\nZac Efron as Link Larkin (also additional voices on 4)\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer as Velma Von Tussle\n\nBrittany Snow as Amber Von Tussle (also additional voices on 4)\n\nJohn Travolta as Edna Turnblad\n\nElijah Kelley as Seaweed J.
