        "text": "Teen movies have dominated popular cinema for a long time, and it’s no surprise why. There is no better form of entertainment than revisiting the excitement, drama, and challenges of adolescence. When viewers think of great teen movies, classics like The Breakfast Club, Clueless, and Mean Girls often come up. However, plenty of recent films capture the teen experience with the same success and stand out within the genre.\n\n1 of 20\n\n'The Perks of Being a Wallflower'\n\nSummit Entertainment\n\nDespite only having turned ten years old, The Perks of Being a Wallflower has been hailed as one of the best coming-of-age films of all time. Perks follows Charlie, an introvert who is starting high school. When two seniors take him under their wing, they expose him to the real world and help him face trauma from his past. The film connected with audiences thanks to its unflinching and realistic look at mental health, as well as tackling other uncomfortable subjects.\n\n2 of 20\n\n'Love, Simon'\n\n20th Century Studios\n\nLove, Simon was one of the first big studio movies released about the coming out experience. Simon keeps the fact that he is gay a secret from his family and friends until a classmate threatens to reveal the truth. While undoubtedly cheesy and cliché, the film is an unabashed celebration of love and acceptance. It also marked a huge milestone for representation in mainstream media, as this kind of story had never been told on such a large scale.\n\n3 of 20\n\n'You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah'\n\nNetflix\n\nAdam Sandler and his family star in one of Netflix’s latest teen comedies, You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah. The actor’s daughter, Sunny Sandler, plays Stacy, who is preparing for her dream bat mitzvah alongside best friend Lydia. Her big day is threatened when high school drama and a boy get in the way. The film is wonderfully light and hilarious, putting modern Jewish culture at the forefront. Young Sandler’s turn as Stacy proves she has her father’s talent.\n\n4 of 20\n\n'Sing Street'\n\nEndeavour Content\n\nSing Street is a simple story of boy meets girl, elevated by its '80s Dublin setting, catchy music, and misfit characters. Teen Conor meets the mysterious Raphina and starts a band to impress her. His music also offers him an escape from personal struggles such as poverty and a strained family life. The film is an uplifting and charming tale about hope for the future and the universal teen experience of trying to prove you are enough. It will leave viewers with the biggest of smiles.\n\n5 of 20\n\n'The Hate U Give'\n\n20th Century Studios\n\nThe Hate U Give is a teen movie with an urgent and timely message, particularly in today’s social climate. African-American teen Starr witnesses her friend getting shot and murdered by the police. As she faces pressure from various communities, she must stand up for what is right. The film might be the most crucial teen movie released in recent years, as it not only highlights the tragedy of police brutality but also the importance of young people using their voices to fight oppression.\n\n6 of 20\n\n'The Kings of Summer'\n\nCBS Films\n\nThe Kings of Summer is a little hidden gem in the expansive catalog of teen movies. The underrated film follows three teen boys who leave their families and escape to live in the woods for the summer. Filled with adventure, humor, and heart, it perfectly captures the feeling of freedom and friendship that comes with youth. However, it also explores how one cannot run away from family, which most teens want to do. Quirky and entertaining, it makes for the perfect summer movie.\n\n7 of 20\n\n'The Edge of Seventeen'\n\nSTX Entertainment\n\nFeaturing Hailee Steinfeld in a hilarious and heartfelt lead performance, The Edge of Seventeen is certainly one of the most relatable modern teen movies. Nadine already suffers from the discomfort of growing up when her best friend starts dating her older brother. Rather than portray high school as a glamorous experience, the film confronts the awkwardness and confusion that comes with adolescence, which feels all the more authentic through the lens of Steinfeld’s character.\n\n8 of 20\n\n'Eighth Grade'\n\nA24\n\nWhile it technically does not fall into this category, Eighth Grade could certainly be considered by some as a horror movie. Never has the crippling anxiety and self-loathing that comes with being a young teenager been so realistically portrayed as it has in this film. Kayla, an eighth grader, makes videos about confidence on the internet, which is directly at odds with her self-consciousness and desperation to fit in with her peers. Eighth Grade is a painfully accurate portrait of this confusing time in life.\n\n9 of 20\n\n'Mid90s'\n\nA24\n\nSet in 1990s Los Angeles, Mid90s is an indie-drama that follows thirteen-year-old Stevie. Struggling with his home life, which involves his abusive brother and needy mother, Stevie finds solace by befriending a group of older kids at a skate shop. This slice-of-life story offers a nostalgic throwback to simpler times and sees Stevie learn more about the world from his older peers. Thanks to its grungy setting, authentic performances, moody score, and stylish cinematography, it sticks with you.\n\n10 of 20\n\n'Lady Bird'\n\nA24\n\nBefore Greta Gerwig broke box office records directing Barbie, she gave audiences one of the defining teen movies of the last ten years, Lady Bird . Saoirse Ronan plays Christine \"Lady Bird\" McPherson, who feels stuck at her Sacramento Catholic high school. As she longs for something more significant in life, she navigates her turbulent relationship with her mother and others in her circle. It offers an observant and empathetic look at the coming-of-age experience and is poignant and hilarious.\n\n11 of 20\n\n'The Fallout'\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nThe Fallout deals with one of the most devastating and dangerous issues American teens face today: school shootings. Jenna Ortega plays Vada, who struggles to navigate the aftermath of an incident at her school. The film demonstrates the various ways in which people deal with trauma and shines a light on survivors of tragedy and the damage left behind. Harrowing yet hopeful, the film targets the United States’s current gun crisis, affecting so many young people.\n\n12 of 20\n\n'Booksmart'\n\nAnnapurna Pictures\n\nBefore making headlines with her film Don’t Worry Darling, Olivia Wilde went back to high school with her acclaimed directorial debut, Booksmart. Upon graduation, academic best friends Amy and Molly realize they could have afforded to study less and party more. As a result, they let loose over one wild night. With a wacky array of eccentric characters, sharp and witty script, plenty of outrageous moments, and a touching female friendship at its core, it’s a winner in every sense.\n\n13 of 20\n\n'To All the Boys I've Loved Before'\n\nNetflix\n\nTo All the Boys I’ve Loved Before is undoubtedly the film that kickstarted the Netflix YA rom-com craze. The film follows Lara Jean, who writes love letters to her past crushes meant for her eyes only. When the letters are released, she is confronted, and chaos ensues. The film is wrapped in cotton candy, and viewers know exactly where the plot is going, but it’s such a fun time that one can't complain. The central romance is incredibly sweet, and the two leads are ridiculously charming.\n\n14 of 20\n\n'Blinded by the Light'\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nInspired by a true story, Blinded by the Light is a celebration of finding yourself and the power of music. Pakistani teen Javed deals with racism and his traditional family but discovers an escape through the songs and lyrics of Bruce Springsteen. The Boss helps Javed find his voice and inner strength, as well as making him feel understood and seen. The film features many of Springsteen’s beloved hits, and the story of music as a savior is one many can relate to.\n\n15 of 20\n\n'Me and Earl and the Dying Girl'\n\nSearchlight Pictures\n\nIndie dramedy Me and Earl and the Dying Girl follows socially awkward teen Greg, who is forced by his mother to befriend Rachel, a girl who has leukemia. While many teen films like to romanticize and even glamorize cancer, this takes a quirky, comedic, and refreshing route. The movie uses clever writing and humor to tackle heavy subjects like illness and death while still remaining heartfelt and sensitive. It keeps its focus on the friendship at its core.\n\n16 of 20\n\n'Do Revenge'\n\nNetflix\n\nNetflix’s Do Revenge is a mix of Means Girls, Heathers, and Clueless for Gen Z times. The dark comedy follows Drea, the popular girl, and Eleanor, a new student, who become friends and agree to get revenge on each other’s enemies. Filled with biting humor, pretty pastels, and a stacked young cast, Do Revenge offers an entertaining ride full of twists and turns. With enough self-awareness and individual flair, it’s destined to become a cult classic.\n\n17 of 20\n\n'Unpregnant'\n\nHBO Films\n\nUnpregnant is a unique road trip movie with a message at its center. The story follows seventeen-year-old Veronica, who discovers she is pregnant and travels interstate with her former best friend to have an abortion. The film handles sensitive subject matter with great care and insight, particularly through a comedic lens. It’s very much a buddy comedy with jokes at the forefront, but its statement about safe and accessible healthcare for women is equally important.\n\n18 of 20\n\n'Dumplin''\n\nNetflix\n\nDumplin’ is a movie all about empowerment, self-love, and fighting against the system. The story follows the plus-sized teen daughter of a former beauty queen, who signs up for her mom’s pageant as a protest. As others who also don’t fit the mold follow in her footsteps, she unintentionally starts a revolution of sorts in her small Texas town. The feel-good flick celebrates challenging norms and embracing your identity, and its Dolly Parton soundtrack is the icing on top.\n\n19 of 20\n\n'The Way Way Back'\n\nSearchlight Pictures\n\nThe Way Way Back follows shy teen Duncan, who goes on summer vacation to a beach house with his mother and her belittling boyfriend. As Duncan struggles to fit in and have fun, he manages to get a job at the local water park, where he befriends adult employee Owen. Their bond helps Duncan come out of his shell and also helps Owen to mature. This comedic coming-of-age tale is a reminder of those sun-drenched summers and the importance of having someone rooting for you.\n\n20 of 20\n\n'Spontaneous'\n\nParamount Pictures\n\nSpontaneous is a wild and quite literally explosive black comedy. When students at their school inexplicably start to blow up, teens Mara and Dylan try to navigate their romantic relationship and the fact that they, too, might explode at any moment. Bloody and shocking, the film's absurd premise is executed with surprising warmth, heart, and plenty of outrageous laughs. It also works as a reflection on making the most of life and living every moment like it’s your last.\n\nAlyssa De Leo is a freelance writer based in Melbourne, Australia.
