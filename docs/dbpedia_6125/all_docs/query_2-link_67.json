        "text": "Hairspray is a musical hoot, from its opening number introducing this year's Jennifer Hudson to a finale proving John Travolta still has it on the dance floor.\n\nAlong the way, we're treated to one of this summer's more enjoyable movie experiences, occasionally flawed but always frisky.\n\nUnlike The Producers, which also traveled from movie to Broadway and back again, Hairspray feels like it belongs onscreen, but only in the retro fashion director-choreographer Adam Shankman planned.\n\nHis vision is more Bye Bye Birdie - smart since the setting is 1962 - than the MTV-inspired styling of Moulin Rouge or Chicago's sleek psychotic fantasies.\n\nShankman knows dancing onscreen doesn't work if you can't see entire bodies flipping and kicking, with time allowed to enjoy their steps. He is aware that show-stopping songs onstage require clever cinematic illustration without dizzying edits. He's not always successful, but the effort is admirable.\n\nHairspray is always in its era yet accessible to ours, the firmest musical link between now and then since Grease.\n\nJohn Waters' original story focuses on Tracy Turnblad, a Baltimore teenager played by Nikki Blonsky, a newcomer who won the role in open auditions. Underneath that teased hairdo and plump, 4-foot-10 physique is a star waiting to happen.\n\nHer first song, Good Morning, Baltimore, reveals a ringing voice, peppy personality and defiant obesity that a lot of young women will embrace as a role model.\n\nFirst we notice she's overweight. Then we realize she's beautiful.\n\nTracy races home from school each day to catch the Corny Collins Show, a TV dance party along the lines of American Bandstand with a cast of perfectly fit and fashioned teen dancers. She longs to be on the show but is humiliated at an audition.\n\nThen the civil rights undercurrent Waters weaved into his story kicks in.\n\nThe only place Tracy feels accepted is in detention hall, where everyone else is African-American, using punishment time to listen to \"race music\" and dance in suggestive ways that would shock the white community.\n\nCorny (a toothy James Marsden) sets aside an occasional show as \"Negro Day\" when Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah) shares control. When he sees Tracy doing steps learned from Maybelle's son Seaweed (Elijah Kelley), Corny hires her for the show. Attention paid to this newcomer irks the resident princess, Amber von Tussle (Brittany Snow), and her mother Velma (Michelle Pfeiffer), who owns the TV station.\n\nHairspray becomes a social protest you can dance to, an underdog story with bite. A couple of detours fall flat: Velma's attempted seduction of Tracy's father (Christopher Walken) and Maybelle's march for equality (although Latifah sounds great).\n\nCertainly the mostly satirical song list doesn't have the top-to-bottom mastery of bona fide Broadway classics, but there's always something around the corner to make you smile.\n\nA large part of that - literally - is casting Travolta as Tracy's mother, Edna, a role created by the transvestite Divine and owned onstage by Harvey Fierstein. Travolta doesn't employ the flamboyance of those openly gay actors, with unconvincing mincing and speaking in something close to his own voice (sometimes with an inappropriate Southern drawl). It is a stunt that doesn't quite work.\n\nA screening audience didn't mind, drowning out Travolta's first line with murmurs about his appearance and cheering his footwork in the finale.\n\nHairspray has an affable goofiness making its mistakes tolerable and its smartest moves almost triumphant.\n\nSteve Persall can be reached at (727) 893-8365 or persall@sptimes.com. Read his blog at blogs.tampabay.com/movies.\n\nHairspray\n\nGrade: B+\n\nDirector: Adam Shankman\n\nCast: Nikki Blonsky, John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, Queen Latifah, Christopher Walken, Brittany Snow, Zac Efron, Amanda Bynes, Elijah Kelley, James Marsden, Allison Janney\n\nScreenplay: Leslie Dixon, based on the 1988 movie and the stage musical\n\nRating: PG; brief profanity and smoking, suggestive content\n\nRunning time: 114 min."
