        "text": "Award Season - SAG Follows the Script - SAG Nominations\n\nDecember 23rd, 2007\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild nominations were announced this week, but again there were no clear front runners for the six theatrical categories. More...\n\nInternational Details - No Heartbreak for the Kid\n\nDecember 16th, 2007\n\nThe Heartbreak Kid slipped a spot to sixth with $5.04 million on 2029 screens in 46 markets for a total of $79.44 million internationally, which is more than twice what it earned domestically. This includes France where it pulled in $1.10 million on 320 screens while lifting its running tally to $3.37 million in that market. More...\n\nAward Season - Globes Spread the Love Around\n\nDecember 13th, 2007\n\nThe Hollywood Foreign Press Association announced their Golden Globe nominations this week, but there were no truly dominate films out of the 14 theatrical categories. More...\n\nDVD Sales - New Releases Die, Hard\n\nDecember 10th, 2007\n\nThere were no new releases to reach the top five on the sales chart this week and this left Live Free or Die Hard in first place with 716,000 units sold this week. That raises its total sales to 2.78 million units and $47.60 million. More...\n\nDVD Rentals - Waitress is Making a Living on the Home Market\n\nDecember 10th, 2007\n\nOnly one new releases managed to reach the top five leaving Live Free or Die Hard with a clear number one finish adding $10.26 million to its total of $22.68 million after two weeks of release. More...\n\nDVD Sales - Living for the Home Market\n\nDecember 3rd, 2007\n\nNew releases were not plentiful on the sales chart this week, but they dominated the top five by taking three spots. This includes Live Free or Die Hard in first place with 2.06 million units sold and $35.11 million in total sales. More...\n\nDVD Rentals - Die Hard far from Free\n\nDecember 3rd, 2007\n\nLike on the sales chart, Live Free or Die Hard led the way in rentals with $12.42 million during its first week of release, which makes it one of the best renting new releases of the year. More...\n\nDVD Releases for November 20, 2007 - Part I\n\nNovember 20th, 2007\n\nThis week, we have another big list of DVD releases, including nearly a dozen spotlight reviews. And again, we had to split the list into two parts. There are also a number of high quality releases this week, making the selection for DVD Pick of the Week a tough one. Live Free or Die Hard had me interested, either the Unrated 2-Disc Edition or as part of the Blu-Ray Die Hard Collection, but in the end I went with Star Trek - The Original Series - Season 1 - HD-DVD/DVD Combo. Even at a steep price, it is still the best on this week's list. More...\n\nInternational Details - Superbad Neither Super Nor Bad\n\nOctober 28th, 2007\n\nSuperbad climbed into sixth place with $4.26 million on 1836 screens in 27 markets for a total of $31.79 million. Most of that growth came from Spain where the film debuted in second place with $2.24 million on 350 screens while it also opened in Brazil with $511,000 on 192 screens. The film doesn't have many major markets left to open in, but it has already earned more than most comparable films do during their entire run. More...\n\nInternational Details - Another Bollywood Blockbuster\n\nOctober 21st, 2007\n\nBhool Bhulaiyaa became the latest in a long line of Indian films to strike it rich on the international box office as it scored sixth place with $4.59 million on 756 screens in 17 markets. The supernatural comedy even scored a top ten finish in Britain with $600,000 on 45 screens topping a few major Hollywood releases that week. More...\n\nInternational Details - Heartbreak for the Kid\n\nOctober 14th, 2007\n\nThe Heartbreak Kid missed the top five by less than $20,000 over the weekend earning $5.74 million on 819 screens in 4 markets during its opening weekend on the international charts. This includes openings in to major markets including the U.K. where it opened in first place with $2.52 million on 409 screens, but this was still a disappointing debut, much like it was domestically. Conversely, the film opened in second place in Russia with $2.31 million on 360 screens, but this is a much better performance compared to the overall box office size of the marketplace. More...\n\nInternational Details - Winning by a Hair\n\nOctober 7th, 2007\n\nHairspray managed to climb into sixth place by the narrowest of margins earning $4.59 million on 2073 screens in 37 markets for a running tally of $54.35 million. This includes a third place, $1.36 million opening on 302 screens in Italy, which is close to its opening domestically, when you take into account the relative size of the two markets. On the other hand, many muscials prove to be difficult to market internationally and it was never likely that this film would match its domestic run. However, it has already made enough to be considered a financial success. More...\n\nInternational Details - Ratatouille Serves Up an International Dish\n\nSeptember 30th, 2007\n\nRatatouille opening in first place in South Africa this weekend earning $298,000 on 40 screens, which is very close to what The Simpsons Movie made in its opening there a few weeks ago. Its best market of the weekend remains France where it was down a mere 4% to $1.67 million on 655 screens over the weekend for a total of $58.63 million. At this pace, the film will reach $60 million by this time next week while topping Finding Nemo's total of nearly $65 million is increasingly in reach. Overall Ratatouille added $4.66 million on 2535 screens in 27 markets for a total of $216.42 million, which is more than Cars managed, and this film still has openings in Germany, U.K., Italy, and Scandinavia. More...\n\nInternational Top Five - Bourne's the Best, Again\n\nSeptember 19th, 2007\n\nThe Bourne Ultimatum was able to capture top spot, again, while crossing $100 million internationally. Over the weekend the film added $20.84 million on 4124 screens in 45 markets for a total of $125.06 million, which puts it ahead of The Bourne Supremacy on that chart making it the undisputed champion of the franchise. The film finally ended Ratatouille's dominance of France with a reported $4.4 million on 462 screens while it top neighboring Belgium with $861,000 on 58 screens, including previews. The film also opened in first place in South Korea topping a list of five new releases in the top ten; it managed this with $2.89 million on 403 screens over the weekend and $3.47 million in total. In addition, the film is still in first place in Germany with $2.50 million on 702 screens for a two-week total of $8.47 million. More...\n\nInternational Details - Chuck and Larry Hold of Late Charge by Die Hard\n\nSeptember 16th, 2007\n\nI Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry soared into sixth place with $4.72 million on 1521 screens in 21 markets for a total of $14.61 million internationally. The film finally hit big in a non-English speaking market earning first place with $1.27 million on 364 screens in Russia, but was soft in its debuts in South Korea and Italy. In Italy it managed $683,000 on 198 screens, but that was a tiny fraction of the first place film, while in South Korea it managed just ninth place with $275,000 on 123 screens over the weekend and $312,000 in total. More...\n\nInternational Details - Harry Potter has 900 Million Reasons to Celebrate\n\nSeptember 9th, 2007\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix may have fallen out of the top five, but it was able to cross $900 million worldwide since last week making it only the tenth film to do so. Over the weekend the film added $7.08 million on 4486 screens in 53 markets for a total of $626.30 million internationally, which places the film sixth place on that chart just $16 million behind Dead Man's Chest. There's not much to report for individual markets with the film down 43% during its second weekend in Greece adding $612,000 on 129 screens for a total of $2.91 million. Its best market remains Japan at $1.67 million on 605 screens over the weekend for a total of $75.18 million after seven weeks. Meanwhile, the film continues to march towards $100 million in the U.K. and after earning $796,000 on 306 screens over the weekend it now sits at $97.89 million in total. More...\n\nInternational Details - Knocked Up Leaps Up\n\nSeptember 2nd, 2007\n\nKnocked Up went from barely making the top 30 to nearly hitting the top five after adding $6.89 million on 1628 screens in 19 markets. The film now has a total of $25.54 million internationally while its worldwide total hit $173.34 million. To put this into perspective, The 40-Year Old Virgin earned $177.34 million and Knocked Up has yet to open in France, Spain, Italy, and many other significant markets. This week it did open in two major markets, the U.K. and Germany. In the former it had to settle for second place with $3.08 million on 423 screens while in the later it topped the charts with $2.11 million on 597 screens. In both markets this represents a small drop-off from The 40-Year Old Virgin, but the movie has already covered its total cost, so there's little reason to complain. More...\n\nSuperbad Extends Summer\n\nAugust 20th, 2007\n\nSummer abruptly ends during August, sometimes before the month even really begins. Even in the best years, you only get Summer-like openings during the first two weeks. However, this year we got a third Summer weekend, as Superbad opened with more than Evan Almighty's debut figure in late June. Granted, the overall box office dropped to $130 million, which was 15% decline from last weekend. However, that's still a softer decline than expected, an 18% improvement from last year, and enough to say it is still summertime. Enjoy it while it lasts. More...\n\nInternational Details - Dragons Dominate South Korean Marketplace\n\nAugust 19th, 2007\n\nD-War slipped to sixth place overall, but remained in first place in South Korea with $10.19 million on 623 screens over the weekend and $37.81 million in total. More...\n\nTraffic Thins for Rush Hour\n\nAugust 13th, 2007\n\nAs expected, Rush Hour 3 took first place this weekend and helped the overall box office hit $155 million. This was 12% lower than last weekend, but the summer season is wrapping up, so week-to-week drop-offs like this are to be expected. More importantly, it was up nearly 20% from the same weekend last year. More...\n\nInternational Details - Die Hard still has Life Left\n\nAugust 12th, 2007\n\nLive Free or Die Hard was knocked out of the top five but still earned $7.15 million on 317 screens in 29 markets for a total of $192.83 million. The film opened in first place in four markets, with the biggest being Brazil at $1.60 million on 352 screens over the weekend and $2.07 million in total. At this pace the film would hit $200 million this weekend, even if it didn't open in Australia, while it will top Die Hard with a Vengeance's worldwide total shortly. More...\n\nInternational Details for May 18\n\nAugust 5th, 2007\n\nNo, this is not a repeat, May 18 is the name of a South Korean film that opened last weekend with $7.40 million on 534 screens over the weekend and $9.66 million in total. This was enough for first place finish in its native market and a sixth place finish internationally. More...\n\nBourne to Lead?\n\nAugust 2nd, 2007\n\nWhat could be the last major opening this summer debuts today. The Bourne Ultimatum opens in more than 3,600 theaters. The summer has been an overwhelming success to date, up 8% from last year and 3% from 2004's record-setting run. If Bourne can maintain the winning streak, and most analysts agree that it will, then a new record is almost guaranteed. More...\n\nSimpsons Rake in the D'oh!\n\nJuly 30th, 2007\n\nPractically every film in the top five beat expectations, including The Simpsons Movie, which crushed expectations. This helped push the overall box office to $185 million over the weekend and that was roughly 19% higher than the last weekend and a stunning 40% higher than the same weekend last year. With one or two more summer releases that could top $200 million, this has been a very lucrative season and one that helped to put 2007 in the record books. More...\n\nInternational Details - Transformers Remains Hair-raising\n\nJuly 29th, 2007\n\nThe Transformers held on strong dipping just 7% to $33.77 million on 4626 screens in 41 markets for a total of $192.44 million. This includes an estimated $6.4 million from previews in the U.K. The film's only major opening of the weekend was Mexico where it placed first with $5.46 million on 410 screens pushing Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix into second place. The Transformers also continued its amazing run in South Korea adding $3.12 million on 442 screens for a running tally of $46.21 million, which is like making $500 million here given the relative sizes of the two markets. More...\n\nThe Writing is on the Wall (or should that be Blackboard?)\n\nJuly 27th, 2007\n\nOne of the most important and anticipated films of modern times opens in theaters this weekend. The Simpsons Movie looks to change how we look at culture and perhaps change the very way we humans interact. OK, probably not, but it should make a boatload of money at the box office this weekend. More...\n\nChuck and Harry Finish One-Two but Hairspray is the Real Winner\n\nJuly 24th, 2007\n\nAs expected, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix traded spots during the weekend. However, they both finished lower than expected in raw dollars. Fortunately Hairspray and the rest of the films were able to compensate. The overall box office was down 14% from last weekend to $155 million, but that was still up close to 3% compared to the same weekend last year. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for July 15 - July 21, 2007\n\nJuly 21st, 2007\n\nBig list in terms of numbers, not so much in terms of quality. In fact, the best film in terms of updates this week was The Simpsons Movie - Official Site, which has already won the Weekly Website Award. Because of that, there are no new winners this week. More...\n\nChuck and Harry\n\nJuly 19th, 2007\n\nThe buddy comedy with Adam Sandler and Kevin James opens this weekend, and while it won't be seen as one of the major hits of the summer, it should still be in a relatively close battle with Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix for top spot on the charts this weekend. More...\n\n2007 Preview: July\n\nJuly 1st, 2007\n\nAfter a record-breaking start, the summer has slowed down considerably. Granted, it is still hot with a number of big, big blockbusters coming out. In fact, every week in July there's at least one potential $100 million movie. But that's nothing compared to what we saw in May when we have three films open with $100 million. Even worse, outside the four main releases, none of the counter-programming releases look like they will become hits and that will hurt the overall box office. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for June 24 - June 30, 2007\n\nJune 30th, 2007\n\nOne of the slowest weeks I can remember for this list, but at least we have a top-notch site to give the Weekly Website Award to: Ratatouille - Official Site. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for May 13 - May 19, 2007\n\nMay 19th, 2007\n\nEither it was a really slow week or my Google-Fu is way off, because there's a short list this week. Not only were there very few new / updated sites, but there was nothing that jumped out as award winners. I was tempted to give the award to The Transformers - Official Site just for the new trailer, but I already geeked-out over that site when the first trailer came out. In the end there just wasn't a site worthy of the award this week. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for April 15 - April 21, 2007\n\nApril 21st, 2007\n\nThere were a few new flash sites to launch this week, but while there might be a couple future winners among those sites, it was a long time resident on this week's list that walked away with top honors. That site was Hot Fuzz - Official Site, which probably could have won several weeks ago if the features were added all at once. However, it's much better to spread the updates out in order to get people coming back week after week. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for January 20 - January 26, 2007\n\nJanuary 26th, 2007\n\nThis year's crop of summer blockbusters still haven't started opening movies site in earnest yet, and until they do, this column will be lacking. It's yet another week without a truly award-winning site but Catch & Release - Official Site is the best of the rest. More...\n\nMovie Website Updates for December 30 - January 5, 2007\n\nJanuary 6th, 2007\n\nBig list as I try to catch up after the holidays. I think I caught all the updates. Not only are there a lot of sites on this week's list, several of them are potential award winners with the best of the best being Smokin' Aces - Official Site. More...\n\nNew Movie US Release Dates - December 3, 2006\n\nDecember 3rd, 2006"
