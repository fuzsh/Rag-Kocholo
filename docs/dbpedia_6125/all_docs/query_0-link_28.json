        "text": "Answer: I Can Wait\n\n\"I Can Wait\" was recorded and filmed by Nikki Blonsky, but was ultimately cut as it was decided that, after the change of pace in \"Timeless To Me\" and \"I Know Where I've Been\", the movie needed to get the the high energy of the final scene. Had it been included in the film it would have taken place while Tracy is locked up in the Pingleton's bomb shelter. The scene can be found on the two disk \"Shake and Shimmy\" edition of the film.\n\nThe other three songs were recorded as demos but ultimately were not used in the film. Both \"Save Your Applause 'Til The End\" and \"Mrs. Von Tussle Says\" were written for the character of Velma Von Tussle who was played in the film by Michelle Pfeffier. Both songs were played for Michelle but she said that she'd signed up to play \"Miss Baltimore Crabs\" and that it was the basis of her entire character, so the original song stayed. \"It Ain't Over 'Til The Fat Lady Sings\" was a song written for the character of Tracy. It was supposed to occur before \"You Can't Stop The Beat\" but it was later decided that 'beat' was enough. These songs were never recorded by the film actors but the demos can be heard on the collectors edition soundtrack.\n\nAnswer: Brenda\n\nBrenda is played by Cassie Silva. She is a council member on 'The Corny Collins Show'. She is going to be absent for nine months, so there is a vacancy on the show. This is how Tracy decides to audition. Since she is going to be absent for nine months, the viewers are made to think that she is pregnant. Brenda has black hair and, like the rest of the female council members, is seen wearing dresses.\n\nAnswer: Amber\n\nLink is the last one to say his name. Amber is the first because she had been crowned Ms. Teenage Hairspray the year before. Amber is Link's girlfriend, and will do anything to keep him to herself. Her mother, Velda von Tussle, is the producer of \"The Corny Collins Show\" and together, they try to keep Tracy from making it onto the show.\n\nAnswer: The pregnancy of one of its stars\n\nDue to the pregnancy of Brenda, one of the show's Council Members, a spot opens up for a new member. Determined to seize this rare opportunity, Tracy skips school in order to audition, only to have her hopes dashed by the obnoxious Velma Von Tassle. For the vindictive Velma tells Tracy bluntly that her size is an issue, as is her support of integration, and so she is rejected, Later on in detention, which is Tracy's punishment for skipping school, she meets Seaweed, who performs on \"The Corny Collins Show\" on \"Negro Day\". He and his friends are all wonderful dancers, and soon enough Tracy is dancing alongside them, impressing them with her moves.\n\nAnswer: Wilbur Turnblad\n\nJerry Stiller played the role of Arthur Spooner, between 1998 and 2007, in the television comedy \"The King Of Queens\" as well as roles in \"The Heartbreak Kid\" (2007), \"Zoolander\" (2001) and \"Seinfeld\" (1993 - 1998).\n\nActor Billy Crystal and Jim Broadbent were both considered for the role of Wilbur in this film before it went to Christopher Walken.\n\nWilbur Turnbald is the father of Tracy and the husband of Edna. It is Wilbur who encourages and supports Tracy in her dream to become a dancer on the Corney Collins show. He is also the owner of a joke shop.\n\nAnswer: Leaving the house\n\nEdna has a fear of leaving the house and being in large crowds. This fear is called \"agoraphobia\". When Tracy convinces her mom to be her manager, they go to Mr Pinky's store and Edna gets over her fear.\n\nIn the song \"Welcome to the 60s\" Edna says \"I haven't left the house since 1951.\" This means that it had been 11 years since she last left her home, because the movie is set in 1962.\n\nEdna is played by John Travolta."
