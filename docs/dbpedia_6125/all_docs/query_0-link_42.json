        "text": "Welcome to MsMojo, and today we’re counting down our picks for the best teen movies from the year 2000 up to now. Which movie makes you feel nostalgic for your teen years? Let us know in the comments.\n\n#30: “Dope” (2015)\n\nThis coming-of-age story does so much more than follow the outcast geek as he gets mixed up with the cool kids. This teen gets mixed up with a drug dealer. We watch as Malcom tries to navigate this new connection while maintaining what’s important to him: his friendships, good grades, and hopeful future. With a star-studded cast including Zoë Kravitz, A$AP Rocky, and Tyga among some other familiar faces, this movie credibly showcases the life of Black youth dwelling in a high-crime neighborhood. Cleverly written and full of ‘90s culture, this movie never loses its sense of humor or grittiness amid its many twists and turns.\n\n#29: “Hairspray” (2007)\n\nThe story itself may not be entirely fresh since it’s adapted from the 2002 musical – which was based on the 1988 film – but us ‘90s and early aughts kids grew up with this cast. It’s so star-studded, we won’t even bother trying to highlight anyone in particular. When Tracy Turnblad, a plus-sized teen, decides to audition to be a dancer on The Corny Collins Show, she brings with her a change in the status quo. Known for its favorable representation and the beating heart at its center, “Hairspray” gives us a story about self-love, celebrating diversity, and going for what you want out of life, no matter the obstacles stacked against you.\n\n#28: Any of the “Spider-Man” Trilogies (2002-)\n\nWe’re not here to argue about which Spider-Man is best – we love ‘em all! And they’re all great movies for both teens and general audiences. Peter Parker’s whole thing is that he’s just a normal kid given the chance to do some real good in the world. But, the reality is, no one needs superpowers to do good in the world and we all have a little responsibility to do the right thing. The story’s main message hits home every time, and it’s a nice reminder for young adults as they gain more agency in the real world. Beyond that, these movies have everything: a protagonist we love to root for, nail-biting stakes and, of course, they wouldn’t be complete without a little high school romance and drama.\n\n#27: “The Twilight Saga” (2008-12)\n\n“Twilight” was peak teen and pre-teen culture in the mid- and late-aughts. Beyond the vampire vs. werewolf discourse of the time, it offered us fantasy, intensity, and characters who ultimately stay forever young. While its plots don’t necessarily offer the most depth or meaningful morals, we don’t need any of that to enjoy it. It’s unapologetically self-indulgent and a fun world to escape into. Plus, you know, the casting doesn’t hurt either. The “Twilight” movies have since seen a resurgence in pop culture due to their campiness and meme-ability, which means all of us who were once big fans get to relive the ‘hot supernatural creature’ glory days.\n\n#26: “The DUFF” (2015)\n\nSelf-esteem is a major theme among adolescents and young adults, and this movie touches on it beautifully. When Bianca discovers that she’s considered the least attractive and least popular of her friends, she decides it’s time for a change. She employs Wesley, her neighbor-turned-hateable-acquaintance, to help up her social standing, and the two enter a mutually beneficial agreement. This is peak teen storyline, comedy, and romance, right down to the homecoming scene at the end. You get every stereotype you could want out of “The DUFF” and a nice reminder that what’s on the inside will always count more than any pretty face.\n\n#25: “The Spectacular Now” (2013)\n\nA24 does it again. Yet another charming, down-to-earth, and impactful movie, “The Spectacular Now” gives us something raw and real. Shailene Woodley and Miles Teller have impeccable chemistry as they portray Aimee and Sutter, two teens from different circles who begin to fall for each other. Of course, the blossoming relationship is not without its ups and downs – these are teenagers we’re talking about and they are wonderfully flawed. Well-written, sincere, and anything but neat, this movie surpasses the clichés often found in young adult romances and goes straight for the nitty-gritty of it all.\n\n#24: “Five Feet Apart” (2019)\n\nAfter “The Fault in Our Stars” – more on that soon – we have trouble trusting any romance featuring adolescents who are ill. Still, “Five Feet Apart” is so captivating right from the jump, we don’t have much say in the matter – we’re pulled right in. Stella and Will both have cystic fibrosis, which prevents them from getting any closer than six feet. Despite their differing outlooks on their genetic disorders, the two inevitably begin to form a close bond, one where physical connection is out of the question. It’s both refreshing and affecting to watch these two navigate romance without so much as holding hands.\n\n#23: “​​13 Going on 30” (2004)\n\nThis one is such a classic and, while it’s generally loved by all rom-com audiences, we’re not about to ignore that “thirteen” in the title. Jennifer Garner perfectly embodies the age as she portrays a young teen who suddenly finds herself in an adult body. The movie’s concept is a clever way to captivate both age demographics, who will each pickup on different details. It also makes the rewatching experience as an adult that much more rewarding. With several Teen Choice Award nominations, “13 Going on 30” has been cemented in the teen pop culture canon for over 20 years now.\n\n#22: “The Hunger Games” franchise (2012-23)\n\nAs far as dystopias go, “The Hunger Games” took the world by storm in the late aughts with a highly successful novel trilogy. As violent and heavy as the content is – you know, a bunch of kids forced to kill each other in an arena – the theme of rebellion among adolescents has been around forever. It becomes incredibly empowering to watch this sixteen-year-old who, with all the odds stacked against her, rises to overthrow her corrupt government. As stand-alone films, the casting, direction, and music are all phenomenal but, possibly the highest praise from fans is how faithful they are to the books.\n\n#21: “Harry Potter” franchise (2001-11)\n\nBefore you head to the comments to berate us about “Harry Potter” being targeted towards kids, hear us out! While the first few installments may have been primarily made with younger viewers in mind, the characters rapidly age into their teen years just as the series takes a darker tone shift. By “The Goblet of Fire”, we’re seeing our favorite trio worried about things like their appearance and who they might attend the Yule Ball with. Of course, there isn’t a ton of time to concern themselves with the typical high school dilemmas since they have a wizarding world to save.\n\n#20: “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl” (2015)\n\nWhile some of the movies on our list today are going to be lighthearted high school romps, this isn’t one of them. Despite the fact that it deals with a teen facing terminal cancer, “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl” actually has much more levity than you would imagine. It’s a sweet coming of age film that looks at the typical experience of being a teenager, with the added gravity of being confronted with mortality. It’ll make you laugh, it’ll make you cry, and you’ll certainly be thinking about it long after it’s over.\n\n#19: “She’s the Man” (2006)\n\nWho knew that William Shakespeare's comedic play “Twelfth Night” would make the perfect background for a hilarious teen romance movie? In this 2006 film, Amanda Bynes plays Viola Hastings, a girl who loves playing soccer, but is dismayed when her team is cut. She decides to take matters into her own hands and disguise herself as her twin brother Sebastian and play for the guys’ team instead to prove a point. This movie is, of course, full of laugh out loud hijinks, especially when Viola finds herself falling for one of her teammates.\n\n#18: “A Cinderella Story” (2004)\n\nSome of the movies on our list are critically acclaimed films that received Oscar nominations, but this one didn’t exactly fare well with the critics, receiving a dismal 12% on Rotten Tomatoes. But critics aren’t the only ones with opinions, and we love this charming modern day fairy tale starring Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray. Does it make sense that Austin doesn’t recognize Sam just because she’s wearing a small mask? No. But do we care? Definitely not. Of course this movie has a picture perfect happily ever after, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\n#17: “Sing Street” (2016)\n\nThis low budget production was a collaboration between Ireland, the US and the UK, and the result was a perfect teen movie about a Dublin adolescent in the ‘80s who starts a band with the goal of getting his crush to fall for him. The movie even received a nomination for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globe Awards. If you’re a music fan looking for something uplifting that’ll leave you wanting to sing along with the characters, look no further than this sadly underrated movie.\n\n#16: “Eighth Grade” (2018)\n\nWe never could have imagined that comedian Bo Burnham could have created such a heartfelt film about a young teenage girl living in the social media era, but in 2018, he did just that, impressing critics and viewers in the process. Elsie Fisher shines as the desperately awkward protagonist Kayla, who you can’t help root for throughout the story even if you’re busy cringing and covering your eyes while remembering your own uncomfortable middle school experiences. This movie will break your heart and leave you wishing you could see Kayla living her best life all grown up.\n\n#15: “Freaky Friday” (2003)\n\nBefore Lindsay Lohan became known for her antics in the tabloids, she was starring in adorable teen comedies like “Freaky Friday”. The premise is that she’s a rebellious teen who doesn’t see eye to eye with her mother about anything, until they inadvertently switch bodies one day. Both Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis do a remarkably good job of impersonating each other’s mannerisms and the film comes to a surprisingly emotional conclusion. Not to mention, this movie made little rocker chicks out of many of us when we saw it in high school!\n\n#14: “Juno” (2007)\n\nHas there ever been such a hilarious look at unintentional teen pregnancy? When it was released in 2007, “Juno” was a massive critical and commercial success, making $231 million on a budget of under $10 million. It looks at a the story of a 16 year old girl who decides to give her baby up for adoption after becoming pregnant by mistake, and while the movie starts off as quirky and full of comedic relief, it takes a more serious and unexpected turn as the action progresses, leading to a conclusion that is both surprising and poignant.\n\n#13: “Bring It On” (2000)\n\n2000’s “Bring It On” opens with a bang, as we see Torrance Shipman have a cheerleading nightmare dream sequence. What follows is a movie that keeps up an exciting pace, shows us fun cheer routines, a bit of romance and even tackles racism and class disparity. While some movies from this era don’t hold up well 20 years later, this one is just as likable as it was upon its release. While it may not have been initially critically acclaimed, it has achieved cult classic status in the years since.\n\n#12: “Booksmart” (2019)\n\nThe elevator pitch for this movie, which was directed by Olivia Wilde, could have been “Superbad, but with girls”. But the end result was so much more. Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever star as two high school seniors who have spent their last few years focusing on academics rather than having a good time. They set out to have one epic night out before graduation and end up getting much more than they bargained for. It’s laugh out loud funny and manages to be silly while also being pretty woke.\n\n#11: “Love, Simon” (2018)\n\n“Love, Simon” was notably the first time that a major Hollywood studio made a teen movie focusing on a gay protagonist, but beyond its historical significance, it’s also a deeply enjoyable film. While many LGBTQ narratives told in the mainstream look at the perils of being gay, this one takes a somewhat lighter, though still realistic look at what a teenager’s experience might be like coming out today. It features a sweet romance and a cast of likable characters that makes us think this will soon become a modern classic.\n\n#10: “The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants” (2005)\n\nIt’s always tough to adapt a book that has such a loyal following, but they nailed it with the 2005 movie version of “The Sisterhood Of The Traveling Pants”. The story is about four friends who are very different from one another but who happen to fit into the same pair of second hand jeans, so they use the pants to keep them together even when they’re apart. The all star cast is what carries this movie, with Amber Tamblyn, America Ferrera, Blake Lively and Alexis Bledel each bringing plenty of heart to their sections of the story.\n\n#9: “The Princess Diaries” (2001)\n\nDoesn’t everyone dream of suddenly finding out they’re in fact the princess of a small little-known country? We sure did! The modern fairy tale told in “The Princess Diaries” is tons of fun, as we watch Anne Hathaway play the hapless Mia Thermopolis, a clumsy and decidedly un-graceful teen living in San Francisco. When she finds out from her grandmother, played flawlessly by Julie Andrews, that she is actually the heir to the kingdom of a fictional country called Genovia, she has to quickly learn how to walk and talk like royalty. We’ll rewatch this move if just for that epic makeover.\n\n#8: “A Walk to Remember” (2002)\n\nIf you were a teen in the early aughts, you almost certainly had your heart broken by this Nicholas Sparks adaptation. “A Walk to Remember” introduces us to Jamie, a minister’s daughter who seems too pure for this world and Landon, a bad boy who’s part of the wrong crowd. When they’re thrown together, Jamie makes Landon promise that he won’t fall in love with her, which he takes as some kind of joke. But they do fall in love, only for their happy ending to be foiled by the fact that Jamie has been hiding her terminal illness from him. You’ll need the Kleenex for this one!\n\n#7: “Easy A” (2010)\n\nInspired by the events of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s “The Scarlet Letter”, “Easy A” stars Emma Stone as a high schooler who lies about losing her virginity to get her friend off her back. The casual fib spirals out of control and she finds herself helping her peers come up with equally untrue stories about their own sexual histories. Considering it came out a decade ago, the film does a remarkably good job of tackling the issue of slut shaming that wasn’t nearly as prevalent in the cultural dialogue at the time.\n\n#6: “The Fault in Our Stars” (2014)\n\nIf you think a story about two teenagers battling cancer who fall in love is going to be depressing...well, you’d be right. There’s no sugarcoating it: “The Fault in Our Stars” is certainly not a fun filled romp, but it is a movie that’s incredibly touching and shows the inner lives of two kids who are so much more than the diseases they are suffering from. The story takes you to unexpected places, and trust us when we say that the ending is not the one you were expecting.\n\n#5: “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” (2012)\n\nIt may have taken over a decade for Stephen Chbosky’s novel, “The Perks of Being a Wallflower”, to make it to the big screen, but when it finally did, fans were rewarded with an emotionally evocative film that did justice to its source material. That should come as no surprise considering the fact that Chbosky actually penned the screenplay and directed the film himself. This story about a high schooler dealing with depression and repressed trauma while just trying to make it through each day is both tragic and deeply relatable to anyone who has suffered from mental illness.\n\n#4: “To All the Boys I've Loved Before” (2018)\n\nWhen Netflix released its teen rom-com “To All the Boys I've Loved Before” in 2018, people may not have had high expectations. But anyone who has watched it can tell you that this movie will make a fan out of pretty much any viewer. While it harkens back to teen flicks from the ‘80s in many ways, it also simultaneously feels strikingly modern with its diverse cast and subtly progressive values. Also any teen movie that can give us a couple we want to ship as much as Lara Jean and Peter is a good one in our books.\n\n#3: “Lady Bird” (2017)\n\nWhile many of the movies on this list may have been popular with audiences, there may not be one quite as critically acclaimed as “Lady Bird”. With an impressive 99% on Rotten Tomatoes and five Oscar nods including Best Picture and Best Actress for Saoirse Ronan’s heartbreaking lead performance, Greta Gerwig’s solo directorial debut is a coming of age story that is not to be missed. Telling the story of a Sacramento teenager who has big dreams for herself, this film is at once hilarious and heartrending. The picture it paints of a mother daughter relationship would make anyone want to call their mom and tell them they love her.\n\n#2: “The Edge of Seventeen” (2016)\n\nYou might be surprised to see a movie so high on this list that many people have not seen, considering it only brought in $18 million at the box office. But considering this a ringing endorsement to watch “The Edge of Seventeen” if you haven’t already. It stars Hailee Steinfeld as Nadine, a girl who has to face her best friend starting to date her older brother while she’s still getting over her father’s death. The movie is very much set in the modern day, with a cringeworthy texting scene as one of its most memorable moments.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\n“Napoleon Dynamite” (2004)\n\nAn Awkward Outcast Helps His New Friend Run for Class President\n\n#1: “Mean Girls” (2004)\n\nThere is no movie that has defined the teen genre more this century so far than this one has. “Mean Girls” tackled the high school comedy in a snarky and satirical way that makes it stand out among the pack. Regina George and her band of Plastics are an over the top version of the mean girls that exist in nearly every high school, and the way this film portrays cliques feels oh so real to many. Its legacy and cult following don’t look like they’re going anywhere anytime soon, with so many quotes and concepts from the movie having entered the cultural lexicon. You go, Glen Coco!"
