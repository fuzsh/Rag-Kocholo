        "text": "We wish everyone an enjoyable and safe Fourth of July, wherever and however you’ll be celebrating. If you find yourself with family in town for the weekend and need something fun and free to do, may we suggest a movie?\n\nWe have “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” rated PG, showing at 6 p.m. on both Friday and Saturday. When Puss discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll and that he has burned through eight of his nine lives, he launches into an epic journey to restore them by finding the mythical Last Wish. The runtime of this film is 1 hour and 42 minutes.\n\nOur 7 p.m. showing will be the 2007 musical comedy-drama, “Hairspray,” starring John Travolta, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, and Queen Latifah. This film is based on the Broadway musical of the same name, which was based on the 1988 film, which was not, in fact, a musical. In this story, teenager Tracy Turnblad teaches 1962 Baltimore a thing or two about integration after landing a spot on a local TV dance show. The runtime is 1 hour and 57 minutes.\n\nLooking ahead to the following week, we are excited to premiere local producer Colton Urquhart’s fourth film on Thursday, July 11, at 7 p.m. This will be a free showing for the community, and we would love to see a huge turnout to support his efforts. The film is called “Half Moon Bay” and was, as with his other three projects, shot and produced entirely in Fallon. The runtime is 1 hour and 10 minutes.\n\nIn August, we’ll participate in the 10th Annual Community Reunion with a free concert on Friday, August 16, at 7 p.m. with River Rogue, followed on Saturday by open-house Theatre Tours from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Community Karaoke from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Also, don’t miss our annual summer fundraising 5K fun run/walk on the 24th - The Cantaloupe Canter. This event begins in front of the Indoor Pool, 333 Sheckler Rd, and is a traditional event to help celebrate the Fallon Cantaloupe Festival and Country Fair, which will be held August 23 through 25 this year. Early registration and sponsorship forms can be found on our website."
