        "text": "“Mean Girls” the new movie musical has terrific performances, hilarious dialogue, tremendous choreography (Kyle Hanagami), great songs, inventive cinematography (Bill Kirstein), with use of cell phone and social media imagery, and clever editing (Andrew Marcus).\n\n“Mean Girls,” based on the Broadway stage musical that is based on the movie that is based on a book, is in the tradition of teen-themed movie musicals and movies.\n\nThe movie musicals include “Bye Bye Birdie” (1963), “Grease” (1978) and “Hairspray” (2007 musical based on the 1988 original film); teen-age-angst movies, such as “American Graffiti” (1971), “Back to the Future” (1985), “Breakfast Club” (1985) and any number of director John Hughes movies (“Sixteen Candles,” 1984; “Pretty in Pink,” 1986), as well as teen female theme movies, “Heathers” (1988), “Clueless” (1995), “Cruel Intentions” (1999), “Legally Blonde” (2001), “The Clique” (2008) and “Easy A” (2010).\n\nIt’s two decades after the original “Mean Girls” (2004), starring Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Lizzy Caplan and Allentown’s Amanda Seyfried in her movie acting debut.\n\nTina Fey, who reprises her role from the 2004 movie as a teacher in “Mean Girls” the movie musical, wrote the screenplay for the movie musical, the Broadway musical (March 2018 - March 2020) and the original movie, which was based on the book, “Queen Bees and Wannabes,” by Rosalind Wiseman. There was a “Mean Girls 2” (2011).\n\nFey has said she based the “Mean Girls” scripts on her experiences as a student at Upper Darby High School, Upper Darby Township, Delaware County.\n\n“Mean Girls” is a cultural capstone, an iconic influencer and exploder of shibboleths.\n\nThe stereotypes being spoofed are obvious, scornful and laughable, none more so than “The Plastics,” the cool-girl clique led by Regina (Reneé Rapp, reprising her role from the Broadway show).\n\nRegina has Histrionic Personality Disorder, which makes her a perfect leader to be fawned over by her female sycophants, Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika).\n\nCady (Angourie Rice), the new girl in school, becomes fast friends with Janis (Auli’l Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey).\n\nCady has a crush on Aaron (Christopher Briney), the best-looking guy in AP Calculus if not all of North Shore High School.\n\nSamantha Jayne and her husband Arturo Perez Jr. (in their feature film directorial debut; directors, TV mini-series, “Quarter Life Poetry: Poems for the Young Broke & Hangry, 2016) direct “Mean Girls” from the screenplay by Tina Fey.\n\nThe songs for the stage musical and movie musical are by composer Jeff Richmond (Tony Award nominee, “Mean Girls,” 2018; and Tina Fey’s husband) and lyricist Nell Benjamin (Tony Award nominee, “Legally Blonde,” 2011).\n\nThe cast is Ah!mayZing!\n\nAngourie Rice (“Spider-Man: No Way Home,” 2021; TV‘s “The Mare Of Easttown,” 2021) is genuine and natural as Cady.\n\nRenee Rapp (TV’s “The Sex Lives of College Girls,” 2021-22; “Not My Fault” music video with Megan Thee Stallion, 2024) is intense and hilarious as Regina.\n\nAuli’i Cravalho (voice, title character, “Moana,” 2016) is charming as Janis.\n\nJaquel Spivey (Grammy nominee, Broadway cast, “A Strange Loop,” 2023) is fantastic as Damian.\n\nAvantika (TV’s “Mira, Royal Detective, 2020-22) is phenomenal, giving a whole new spin to Karen (the role Amanda Seyfried played in the original film).\n\nChristopher Briney (TV’s “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” 2022-23) is memorable as Aaron.\n\nBebe Wood (“Crushed,” 2022) is very funny as Gretchen.\n\nThe leads are in fantastic voice.\n\nThe songs, in production, delivery and choreography, are satirical, zany and camp.\n\nSong highlights include “A Cautionary Tale,” Janis and Damian; “Stupid with Love,” Cady; “What’s Wrong With Me?,” Gretchen; “Apex Predator,” Janis, Cady; “Someone Gets Hurt,” Regina, and “Revenge Party,” Janis, Damian, Cady and Company.\n\nNoteworthy in the cast are Jenna Fischer (Cady’s mother), Busy Philipps (Regina’s mother), Tim Meadows (school principal), Jon Hamm (phys-ed teacher), Ashley Park (French teacher), Tina Fey (math teacher) and Lindsay Lohan (math contest host).\n\n“Mean Girls” is a send-up of the clichés, trends and fads of class culture, and not only the test scores, but the popularity, fashion, gossip, rivalries and bullying at a typical American high school. “Mean Girls” checks all the boxes not only of the contemporary high school scene, but possibly of your high school experience.\n\nIn “Mean Girls,” there’s the “Burn Book,” a secret scrapbook of photos, drawings and insults and infatuations about classmates. At the former Lanark Elementary School that I attended in the Southern Lehigh School District, the “Slam Book” was surreptitiously passed across the aisle from student to student in the sixth grade classroom. Check.\n\nIn “Mean Girls,” the high school formal dance is called the “Spring Fling,” where a King and Queen is chosen. Cady is chosen the Queen. At Southern Lehigh High School, in 1966, I was King of the “Spring Fling” and the late Marissa Hendley was Queen. Check.\n\nIn “Mean Girls,” there’s a “Winter Talent Show,” with disastrous results for The Plastics’ dance routine. In the Southern Lehigh “Talent Show” in 1966, I sang lead vocals in the Cherry Street Trio on “Greenback Dollar,” “The Sounds of Silence” and “Yesterday” with John Labate and his brother, the late Carmen Labate, on acoustic guitars. And in tight white jeans and a surfer polo shirt, I led a line of go-go dancers down the aisles and onto the stage of the auditorium. Check.\n\n“Mean Girls” should resonate with many age groups. Whether you are a grandparent reflecting on your high school years; or a parent navigating the teen years of your children, or a teen or young adult yourself, or a fan of Taylor Swift songs, “Mean Girls” will check off many of the boxes on your list.\n\n“Mean Girls” the musical, as Gretchen says, is Grool, as in great and cool. “Mean Girls” is also fetch, another word that Gretchen is determined to enter into the lexicon of teen slang. Check.\n\nIf you’re a fan of all things “Mean Girls,” you should enjoy the movie musical.\n\n“Mean Girls,”\n\nMPAA rated PG-13 (Parents Strongly Cautioned Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.
