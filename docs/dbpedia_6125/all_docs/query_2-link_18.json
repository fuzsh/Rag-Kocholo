        "text": "After spending 15 years as the bad boy of American underground cinema, mocking and shocking the middle classes and the censors with his outrageous star and former schoolfriend, the 21-stone transvestite Divine, John Waters must have been amused when the Mayor of Baltimore, the setting of all his films, declared 7 February 1985 John Waters Day. He celebrated the tribute with the near-mainstream Hairspray, a semi-satire on youth movies and pop nostalgia of the Grease kind. It's about rock-mad teenagers and ambitious mothers competing to get their kids on a local TV rock programme, the 'Corny Collins Show', in 1962. Divine, who died shortly after the film opened, has his finest hour in the dual role of Edna Turnblad, an obese lower-middle-class mother determined to get her plump daughter Tracy on the air, and as the TV station's racist proprietor who believes 'Baltimore is not ready for integrated dancing'.\n\nIn 2002 Waters's film was turned into a successful Broadway musical. Now, like other small-scale pictures turned into stage musicals, The Producers and The Little Shop of Horrors for instance, it comes back to the screen with big stars letting their hair down to be greased or sprayed. In Hairspray John Travolta, prosthetically enhanced to an extravagant degree, plays the overweight laundress Edna, but the role of the station manager is somewhat slimmed down and goes to Paul Dooley. Michelle Pfeiffer shows what a good sport she is in the highly unsympathetic role of the snobbish mother of a blonde teen queen. A bemused Christopher Walken has not much to do as Edna's eccentric husband and Tracy's father. Queen Latifah struts her stuff with her usual, slightly smug confidence as the black hostess of a once-a-month 'Negro Day' edition of the Corny Collins Show, leading a movement to integrate the programme.\n\nThe film's true star is the 18-year-old newcomer Nikki Blonsky as Tracy Turnblad, who starts out as an air-headed pop fan and ends up a dedicated civil-rights activist, a parody of the dramatic arc that Jane Fonda's characters once described. A short, dumpy, adorable figure with a terrific voice, she dominates the film, starting with the opening number in which she skips through the streets to school singing 'Good morning Baltimore'. In this sequence Waters himself makes a signature appearance as a flasher in a dirty raincoat. The film's director and choreographer, Adam Shankman, has never done anything better, but of course the only way for him to go was up after Cheaper by the Dozen 2 and The Pacifier."
