        "text": "01 of 30\n\n20th Century Girl (2022)\n\n20th Century Girl features many of the teen romance movie tropes you grew up with, but this Korean film energizes even the most tired clichés. The story is familiar: A young girl (Kim Yoo-jung) plays matchmaker for her ill friend (Roh Yoon-seo) by learning everything about her crush (Park Jung-woo). It doesn’t take long, of course, for her to fall in love with the boy she’s investigating.\n\nBetween the charms of first love and the nuances of friendship, this teen movie is a winner. —Chris Snellgrove\n\nWhere to watch 20th Century Girl: Netflix\n\nDirector: Bang Woo-ri\n\nCast: Kim Yoo-jung, Byeon Woo-seok, Park Jung-woo, Roh Yoon-seo\n\n02 of 30\n\nAfter (2019)\n\nMany teen romance movies involve a girl trying to answer that eternal (if not archetypal) question: Does she want a safe boyfriend or a sexy bad boy? That’s the basic plot of After, a film where Tessa (Josephine Langford) has a solid relationship with her high school sweetheart Noah (Dylan Arnold), but things quickly get complicated when she goes to college and meets brooding rebel Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin) who transforms her views on life, love, and learning. Solid chemistry between our leads elevates this tale, and it’s hard not to cheer (and swoon) alongside our protagonist. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch After: Netflix\n\nDirector: Jenny Gage\n\nCast: Josephine Langford, Hero Fiennes Tiffin, Selma Blair, Inanna Sarkis, Dylan Arnold\n\n03 of 30\n\nAlong for the Ride (2022)\n\nHigh schooler Auden (Emma Pasarow) has no intentions of falling in love when she decides to spend the summer before college with her absentee dad (Dermot Mulroney). Soon, though, her insomniac tendencies allow her to bond with a fellow night owl (Belmont Cameli) whose desire to help her grow also stirs up some serious butterflies in her stomach. There’s a lot to love here, and the story will particularly resonate with fans of Sarah Desson, who wrote the book of the same name. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch Along for the Ride: Netflix\n\nDirector: Sofia Alvarez\n\nCast: Emma Pasarow, Belmont Cameli, Kate Bosworth, Dermot Mulroney, Andie MacDowell\n\n04 of 30\n\nAnonymously Yours (2021)\n\nMost modern teen romances fall flat because they simply copy the formula that has existed for decades. Anonymously Yours, however, is more attuned to our present digital dating landscape. The plot centers around two teens (Annie Cabello and Ralf Morales) who develop a deep friendship (maybe a little too deep) through anonymous text messages. The twist? Neither knows they hate each other in real life.\n\nThis Spanish-language movie alternates between humor and heartfelt meditations on identity, romance, and technology, making it rise above its teenybopper competition. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch Anonymously Yours: Netflix\n\nDirector: Maria Torres\n\nCast: Annie Cabello, Ralf Morales, Estefi Merelles, Harold Azuara, Alicia Vélez\n\n05 of 30\n\nA Walk to Remember (2002)\n\nThis classic teen romance based on the Nicholas Sparks book of the same name begins with a beautiful and kind loner (Mandy Moore) who catches the eye of an aimless rebel (Shane West) after she helps him practice lines for the school play. In a painfully true-to-life fashion, the boy plays it cool in front of his friends as they ridicule his secret crush, but in private, he falls hard for her depth of character. Tragedy looms large over the budding young couple, but that only heightens the emotional impact of seeing them grow ever closer. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch A Walk to Remember: Netflix\n\nDirector: Adam Shankman\n\nCast: Shane West, Mandy Moore, Peter Coyote, Daryl Hannah\n\n06 of 30\n\nCall Me by Your Name (2017)\n\nThere's no better place for a sexual awakening than northern Italy in the summer. Set in 1983, Call Me by Your Name tells the story of Elio (Timothée Chalamet in his breakout performance), a 17-year-old whose life is upended after his academic father's new grad student Oliver (Armie Hammer) arrives to stay with the family. Sparks fly between the bookish Elio and the worldly Oliver, and, despite their differences, a relationship forms between the two.\n\nA romantic coming-of-age drama, Call Me by Your Name is based on André Aciman's novel from 2007, and meditates on themes of growing up, coming to terms with one's sexuality, and the depths of feeling found in young love. Nominated for four Oscars, with James Ivory taking home the trophy for Best Adapted Screenplay, Call Me by Your Name is a remarkable love story told with tenderness, respect, and nostalgia. —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Call Me by Your Name: Netflix\n\nEW grade: A– (read the review)\n\nDirector: Luca Guadagnino\n\nCast: Armie Hammer, Timothée Chalamet, Michael Stuhlbarg, Amira Casar, Esther Garrel, Victoire Du Bois\n\n07 of 30\n\nCandy Jar (2018)\n\nWhat’s the dividing line between ideology and socioeconomic status? That’s the underlying question of Candy Jar, a movie where a shy, working-class girl (Sami Gayle) discovers that the wealthy, preppy debate team co-captain she’s been butting heads with (Jacob Latimore) is actually someone she’d rather be locking lips with. The movie succeeds largely because it transforms subtext into text, and our debate devotees soon discover that the key to any successful relationship is working together.\n\nCandy Jar is likely to please anyone looking for a good teen romance, but its messages will particularly hit the introverts watching at home. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch Candy Jar: Netflix\n\nDirector: Ben Shelton\n\nCast: Sami Gayle, Jacob Latimore, Uzo Aduba, Helen Hunt\n\n08 of 30\n\nCaught by a Wave (2021)\n\nCaught by a Wave is a beautiful romance movie, but be warned: You’re going to need a box of tissues. The plot starts with two American teens (Elvira Camarrone and Roberto Christian) who meet and fall in love at a summer camp in Sicily. But when one of them is diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, the couple must test the strength of their love. This coming-of-age story is a tearjerker, but it also has plenty of things to say about connection. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch Caught by a Wave: Netflix\n\nDirector: Massimiliano Camaiti\n\nCast: Elvira Camarrone, Roberto Christian, Donatella Finocchiaro\n\n09 of 30\n\nConfessions of an Invisible Girl (2021)\n\nImitation is the highest form of flattery, and this Brazilian film shamelessly borrows from several classic teen comedies, but its story about a young girl (Klara Castanho) who wants to fit in at a high school dominated by a queen bee bully (Julia Gomes) mostly feels like a spin on Mean Girls. This is true right down to our heroine’s friendship with two fellow outcasts who steal every scene. You don’t need to be a mathlete to know that if you love the Plastics, you’ll have a good time with Confessions of an Invisible Girl. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch Confessions of an Invisible Girl: Netflix\n\nDirector: Bruno Garotti\n\nCast: Marcus Bessa, Caio Cabral, Klara Castanho\n\n10 of 30\n\nDJ Cinderella (2019)\n\nDJ Cinderella begins somberly when a teenage girl (Maisa Silva) moves in with her aunt (Elisa Pinheiro) following her parents’ divorce. She begins honing her skills as a DJ, and her burgeoning talents attract the attention of a cute singer (Filipe Bragança), but parental drama threatens to keep these two from making beautiful music together. The movie is a play on Cinderella, and it's refreshing to root for a character who’s motivated by creativity and love. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch DJ Cinderella: Netflix\n\nDirector: Bruno Garotti\n\nCast: Maisa Silva, Filipe Bragança, Fernanda Paes Leme\n\n11 of 30\n\nEndless Love (2014)\n\nThis remake of 1981’s Endless Love successfully translates the charming tale for a new generation. Here, we follow a privileged girl (Gabriella Wilde) who falls in love with a working-class rebel (Alex Pettyfer), but their relationship is attacked by their parents (Bruce Greenwood and Robert Patrick, respectively). The film sands off the original movie’s rough edges, leaving something akin to chicken noodle soup for the hopelessly romantic soul.\n\nAs EW’s critic said in their review, the movie works “as a swoony love story threatened by a basic, cornball Oedipal drama.” —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch Endless Love: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Shana Feste\n\nCast: Alex Pettyfer, Gabriella Wilde, Bruce Greenwood, Joely Richardson, Robert Patrick\n\n12 of 30\n\nThe Half of It (2020)\n\nThe Half of It is about a Chinese American ace student (Leah Lewis) who overcomes her shyness enough to help a tongue-tied jock (Daniel Diemer) win over the girl of his dreams (Alexxis Lemire). There’s just one problem: She’s fallen in love with her, too! The result is both refreshing and bittersweet; as EW’s critic notes in their review, the movie’s “examination of first love, and how our messy, well-intentioned attempts to do right by our own hearts can both wound and help us fumble toward the people we're meant to be, lands nicely.” —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch The Half of It: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Alice Wu\n\nCast: Leah Lewis, Daniel Diemer, Alexxis Lemire, Enrique Murciano, Wolfgang Novogratz\n\n13 of 30\n\nHe’s All That (2021)\n\nHe’s All That really shouldn’t work; after all, this is an adaptation of She’s All That (1999), which was an adaptation of My Fair Lady (1964), which was an adaptation of Pygmalion, so you’d think there is little left to say. But this film feels original by casting the makeover maven Addison Rae to help a geeky guy (Tanner Buchanan) shine as a TikTok influencer. Just like that, we have an answer to why a popular kid would devote so much time and energy to a nobody outside of their social circle: It’s all about the online clout and follower counts, baby! —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch He’s All That: Netflix\n\nDirector: Mark Waters\n\nCast: Addison Rae, Tanner Buchanan, Madison Pettis, Rachael Leigh Cook, Peyton Meyer\n\n14 of 30\n\nInto the Wind (2022)\n\nInto the Wind is about a sheltered teen (Sonia Mietielica) who can’t help but fall for a surfing instructor whose carefree ways help to open her mind and her heart. As Joe Bob Briggs might say, sure, we’ve seen it before, but have we seen it in Poland? This feature film debut from Polish director Kristoffer Rus updates this tired teen romance plot with beautiful locations and just enough unexpected twists to keep things interesting. It turns out that being hot for one's tutor is a genre that translates into every language. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch Into the Wind: Netflix\n\nDirector: Kristoffer Rus\n\nCast: Sonia Mietielica, Jakub Sasak\n\n15 of 30\n\nJJ+E (2021)\n\nMany teen movies paint high school as its own country, one split into petty fiefdoms and even pettier rulers. The Swedish film JJ+E is no exception, following two teens (Elsa Öhrn and Mustapha Aarab) who’ve never been in the same class (literally or socially). However, when the two end up in a course together, so many sparks fly that they threaten to burn all the obstacles keeping them apart. Thanks to the wholesome themes, there is plenty to enjoy here in addition to the cute couple. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch JJ+E: Netflix\n\nDirector: Alexis Almström\n\nCast: Elsa Öhrn, Mustapha Aarab, Magnus Krepper, Marika Lagercrantz, Simon Mezher\n\n16 of 30\n\nThe Kissing Booth (2018)\n\nThe later films in this successful franchise feel more phoned in, but this first tale involving a teenage girl (Joey King) whose desire for the local bad boy (Jacob Elordi) threatens her friendship with his younger brother (Joel Courtney) still feels fun and fresh. When she ends up running the titular fundraiser, she must face her feelings far sooner than she was expecting. It’s cheesy and over-the-top, but the characters are quite charismatic, and the idea that love can be very, very messy remains evergreen. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch The Kissing Booth: Netflix\n\nDirector: Vince Marcello\n\nCast: Joey King, Joel Courtney, Jacob Elordi, Meganne Young, Molly Ringwald, Taylor Zakhar Perez\n\n17 of 30\n\nThe Last Summer (2019)\n\nInstead of focusing on a single couple, this teen romance movie focuses on three different friend duos during their last summer before everyone heads off to college. This means pursuing crushes, testing limits, and generally engaging in teenage self-discovery. The ensemble cast is good apart and great together, and chances are that you will see much of yourself and your cohorts in this coterie of characters. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch The Last Summer: Netflix\n\nDirector: William Bindley\n\nCast: K.J. Apa, Maia Mitchell, Jacob Latimore, Halston Sage, Sosie Bacon, Wolfgang Novogratz, Tyler Posey\n\n18 of 30\n\nLove & Gelato (2022)\n\nDating is the last thing on our protagonist’s mind at the beginning of Love & Gelato; this American student (Susanna Skaggs) simply wants to keep her head down and prepare for college. However, her dead mother’s last wish sends her on a trip to Rome, where she meets two hunks (Tobia De Angelis, Saul Nanni) who threaten to steal her heart. The love triangle is certainly compelling, but what fuels this film adaptation is our main character’s quest to learn who her father (and therefore, who she) really is. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch Love & Gelato: Netflix\n\nDirector: Brandon Camp\n\nCast: Susanna Skaggs, Tobia De Angelis, Owen McDonnell, Saul Nanni\n\n19 of 30\n\nLove at First Sight (2023)\n\nPeople can endlessly debate whether love at first sight exists, but this film asks what would happen if two teens (Haley Lu Richardson and Ben Hardy) fell head over heels on a plane and then lost touch immediately afterward. The answer is simple: They move heaven and earth to find one another again. Everything about the plot is saccharine-sweet, of course, but there is something strangely motivational about watching these love birds refuse to let life get in the way of their inevitably sappy reunion. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch Love at First Sight: Netflix\n\nDirector: Vanessa Caswill\n\nCast: Haley Lu Richardson, Ben Hardy, Jameela Jamil, Rob Delaney, Sally Phillips, Dexter Fletcher\n\n20 of 30\n\nMetal Lords (2022)\n\nFirst and foremost, this is a film about two social outcasts (Adrian Greensmith and Jaeden Martell) who want nothing more than to earn respect by winning the upcoming Battle of the Bands. But when a girl (Isis Hainsworth) enters the picture, it’s an open question as to whether she’ll complete this rock ensemble or tear it apart. This R-rated comedy is filled with raucous laughs and rocking jams, and it’s a cut above your standard teenybopper romantic films. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch Metal Lords: Netflix\n\nDirector: Peter Sollett\n\nCast: Jaeden Martell, Isis Hainsworth, Adrian Greensmith, Brett Gelman, Noah Urrea, Joe Manganiello\n\n21 of 30\n\nNo Hard Feelings (2023)\n\nNo Hard Feelings is an R-rated teen romance, but behind the hilarious raunchiness is a touching story about growing pains and pangs of heartache. The plot involves a woman (Jennifer Lawrence) who is hired to help the son (Andrew Barth Feldman) of a rich couple come out of his shell by dating him before he heads off to college. The laughs are rich and the softer bits are smooth, and according to EW’s critic, Lawrence is the movie’s real appeal, calling her a “chaotic temptress” who “attacks the role with gusto.” —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch No Hard Feelings: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Gene Stupnitsky\n\nCast: Jennifer Lawrence, Andrew Barth Feldman, Laura Benanti, Natalie Morales, Matthew Broderick\n\n22 of 30\n\nThe Prom (2020)\n\nThanks to director Ryan Murphy, The Prom has a very specific audience in mind, and if you sang along to every episode of Glee, you might be a part of it. This film is about a school dance that’s canceled after one girl (Jo Ellen Pellman) wants to take another girl (Ariana DeBose) as her date. Soon enough, washed-out Broadway stars (including Meryl Streep and James Corden) head to this sleepy town to save the prom (and maybe save their careers, too).\n\nThough undeniably cheesy, EW's writer still notes how “the songs have charm” and “the cast is undeniably talented.” —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch The Prom: Netflix\n\nDirector: Ryan Murphy\n\nCast: Meryl Streep, James Corden, Nicole Kidman, Keegan-Michael Key, Andrew Rannells\n\n23 of 30\n\nRoyalteen (2022)\n\nRoyalteen will particularly resonate with fans who voraciously consume The Crown and royal news cycles. That’s because the plot focuses on the blooming romance between a party boy prince (Mathias Storhøi) and a gossip blogger (Ines Høysæter Asserson) who should know better than falling for the future king. The film has a sort of voyeuristic appeal for those who have dreamed of bumping more than shoulders with a charming monarch, and the R-rating makes it a little raunchy too. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch Royalteen: Netflix\n\nDirectors: Per-Olav Sørensen, Emilie Beck\n\nCast: Ines Høysæter Asserson, Mathias Storhøi, Elli Rhiannon Muller Osborne\n\n24 of 30\n\nSee You on Venus (2023)\n\nSee You on Venus may seem cookie-cutter at first; if you’ve seen one movie of broken young people (Virginia Gardner and Alex Aiono) falling in love while trying to heal, it may feel like you’ve seen them all. But this film is more substantial than most because it emphasizes the need for the couple to focus on their own trauma rather than relying on someone else to fix them. The beautiful Spanish setting also helps sell the film’s narrative; after all, who wouldn’t fall in love when the views are even more stunning than your traveling partner? —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch See You on Venus: Netflix\n\nDirector: Joaquín Llamas\n\nCast: Virginia Gardner, Alex Aiono, Rob Estes\n\n25 of 30\n\nSierra Burgess Is a Loser (2018)\n\nA high school rom-com based on the 19th-century French play Cyrano de Bergerac, Sierra Burgess Is a Loser is a modern love story in the style of literary adaptations like Clueless or 10 Things I Hate About You. Sierra Burgess (Stranger Things’ Shannon Purser) is an average looking American kid, which in rom-com land, makes her worthy of ridicule. Unlike other high school movie protagonists, however, Sierra isn’t looking for a glow-up or an invitation to the popular crowd. But when she lands herself in the middle of a romantic mix-up, Sierra finds herself pretending to be someone else for the first time in her life.\n\nThe film might not break genre conventions, but EW’s reviewer writes that “Purser is refreshingly relatable, and Peter Kavinksy-obsessed fans will love getting [Noah] Centineo as another jock with a heart of gold.” —I.G.\n\nWhere to watch Sierra Burgess Is a Loser: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Ian Samuels\n\nCast: Shannon Purser, Kristine Froseth, RJ Cyler, Noah Centineo\n\n26 of 30\n\nTall Girl (2019)\n\nTall Girl predictably focuses on a teen (Ava Michelle) whose insecurities about being more than 6 feet in height are magnified when she falls for a cute foreign exchange student (Luke Eisner). What follows is a portrait of high school as a powder keg full of beaus, bullies, and bohemians that could explode into drama at a moment’s notice. Beneath the by-the-numbers romance plot is a heartwarming message about embracing who you are and not letting the people you tower over look down on you. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch Tall Girl: Netflix\n\nDirector: Nzingha Stewart\n\nCast: Ava Michelle, Griffin Gluck, Sabrina Carpenter, Paris Berelc\n\n27 of 30\n\nThrough My Window (2022)\n\nThrough My Window concerns a shy girl (Clara Galle) who creepily spies on a wealthy heir next door through, you guessed it, her window. Now, she must shore up the courage to tell him how she feels while also hyping herself up to share her writing talents with the world. Cheesy? Yes. Heartwarming? You bet! —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch Through My Window: Netflix\n\nDirector: Marçal Forés\n\nCast: Julio Peña, Clara Galle, Pilar Castro\n\n28 of 30\n\nTo All the Boys I’ve Loved Before (2018)\n\nTo All the Boys I’ve Loved Before has a nightmare premise: A young teen (Lana Condor) writes intense love letters to five boys she fancies (including Noah Centineo) but never sends them. That changes when her little sister (Anna Cathcart) mails each confession and unleashes chaos as each crush confronts her about their unrequited love. Even with its fluffy plot, the film still has much to say about dating, friendship, and the line between them.\n\nEW’s critic admits this is “strictly Disney Channel stuff, but it’s got more substance than you expect. And Condor as Lara Jean has a winning, be-true-to-yourself sense of independence that’s infectious.” —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before: Netflix\n\nEW grade: B (read the review)\n\nDirector: Susan Johnson\n\nCast: Lana Condor, Noah Centineo, Janel Parrish, Anna Cathcart\n\n29 of 30\n\nYou Get Me (2017)\n\nThe line between love and obsession is paper-thin. Here, we follow a boy (Taylor John Smith) who has a bad breakup with his significant other (Halston Sage) and ends up hooking up with a new girl (Bella Thorne). When he and his ex patch things up, though, he discovers that his one-time fling will do anything to keep him in her life. You Get Me is a roller coaster with many twists and turns, and you’ll soon understand why the boy desperately wants off this ride. —C.S.\n\nWhere to watch You Get Me: Netflix\n\nDirector: Brent Bonacorso\n\nCast: Bella Thorne, Halston Sage, Taylor John Smith, Anna Akana, Nash Grier\n\n30 of 30\n\nYou Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah (2023)\n\nProducing and starring in this full-blooded Sandler soirée, Adam steps aside for his daughter Sunny to shine in her debut starring role as Stacy Friedman: a seventh grader experiencing a world of firsts — from trading Converses for heels to planning the ultimate bat mitzvah, complete with a private yacht on the Hudson River and Olivia Rodrigo cruising by on a jet-ski. However, when Stacy's parents (Sandler and Idina Menzel) disapprove of her grand plans, and her BFF Lydia (Samantha Lorraine) defects to the middle school's popular clique — dating Stacy's longtime crush (Dylan Hoffman) in the process — the soon-to-be woman won't let anything prevent her from hosting a \"kick-ass party.\"\n\nYou Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah presents a charming yet cringe-worthy peek into pre-teen shenanigans through fierce Gen-Z wit while also providing insights on Jewish culture. Not to mention, the praiseworthy performances of Sandler's daughters prove how, sometimes, nepotism works wonders. —James Mercadante\n\nWhere to watch You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah: Netflix\n\nDirector: Sammi Cohen\n\nCast: Idina Menzel, Jackie Sandler, Adam Sandler, Sadie Sandler, Sunny Sandler"
