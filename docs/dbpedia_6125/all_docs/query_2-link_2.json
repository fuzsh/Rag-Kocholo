        "text": "Hairspray\n\nThis topic contains:\n\noverall comments and recommendations\n\ndetails of classification and consumer advice lines for Hairspray\n\na review of Hairspray completed by the Australian Council on Children and the Media (ACCM) on 13 September 2007.\n\nOverall comments and recommendations\n\nAbout the movie\n\nThis section contains details about the movie, including its classification by the Australian Government Classification Board and the associated consumer advice lines. Other classification advice (OC) is provided where the Australian film classification is not available.\n\nACCM review\n\nThis review of the movie contains the following information:\n\na synopsis of the story\n\nthemes\n\nuse of violence\n\nmaterial that may scare or disturb children\n\nproduct placement\n\nsexual references\n\nnudity and sexual activity\n\nuse of substances\n\ncoarse language\n\nthe movie’s message\n\nA synopsis of the story\n\nHairspray is a lively musical set in 1962 Baltimore, USA, at a time of racial segregation. Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) is a refreshing teenager whose favourite pastime is watching the Corny Collins show, a singing and dancing television programme which showcases high school students. When a position on the show becomes available Tracy goes to audition but because she is rather overweight she is laughed off the set.\n\nTracy shows great courage and determination in overcoming both social and racial prejudices to gain her spot on the Corny Collins show and achieve racial integration on the programme as well. She also endears herself to the audience, much to the horror of former favourite Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow) and her mother Velma, (Michelle Pfeiffer) the producer of the show. Velma does her best to get rid of Tracy but this backfires spectacularly.\n\nRacial and social prejudice; Body image\n\nThere is some violence and accidental injury in this movie including:\n\nGirls push and shove each other in the rush to get out of school.\n\nAmber frequently gets knocked over and pushed on the dance floor.\n\nTracy pushes some girls out of the way.\n\nTracy gets knocked down by a basketball.\n\nA protest against racial segregation gets rather aggressive and Tracy hits a policeman with her board.\n\nTracy’s mother Edna (John Travolta) throws something at her husband Wilbur (Christopher Walken)\n\nTracy’s friend Amanda’s mother is very intolerant and ties her daughter to her bed when she finds out she’s been dancing with ‘coloured’ people. She calls her a ‘devil’s child’.\n\nAmber falls from a chair, which is high up on the stage.\n\nMaterial that may scare or disturb children\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned violent scenes, there are some scenes in this movie that could scare or disturb children under the age of five, including the following:\n\nThe scene where Amanda’s mother ties her to a bed and waves a cross over her could be disturbing for young children.\n\nChildren in this age group may also be disturbed by the above-mentioned scenes.\n\nIn addition to the above mentioned violent scenes, there are some scenes in this movie that could scare or disturb children aged eight to thirteen, including the following:\n\nSome children in this age group may also be disturbed by the scene where Amanda’s mother ties her to a bed and waves a cross over her, calling her “devil’s child”.\n\nChildren in this age group are unlikely to be disturbed by anything in this film.\n\nProduct placement\n\nNone of concern\n\nSexual references\n\nThere are some sexual references in this movie, including:\n\nA flasher opens his coat but nothing is shown.\n\nGirls stuff falsies in their bras and a boy puts one down his pants.\n\nTracy sings :”I won’t go all the way but I’ll go pretty far”\n\nNudity and sexual activity\n\nThere is some nudity and sexual activity in this movie, including:\n\nEdna is shown in her underwear.\n\nVelma tries to seduce Wilbur and acts seductively\n\nUse of substances\n\nThere is some use of substances in this movie, including:\n\nThere is some drinking in a pub\n\nA pregnant woman is shown drinking and smoking\n\nCoarse language\n\nThere is some coarse language in this movie, including:\n\nOh my God\n\nKiss my arse\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nHairspray is an uplifting musical comedy/drama which is a remake of the original made in 1988. It is very entertaining, although John Travolta cross-dressing as Edna Turnblad is somewhat disconcerting.\n\nThe main messages from this movie are that the colour of one’s skin should be of no importance; also to follow your dreams and to stand up for what you believe in.\n\nValues in this movie that parents may wish to reinforce with their children include:\n\nTolerance\n\nCourage\n\nDetermination\n\nSpeaking out against injustice\n\nOvercoming prejudices – both racial and social\n\nRealising that good character is more important than body image\n\nThis movie could also give parents the opportunity to discuss ways to solve problems without resorting to the use of violence."
