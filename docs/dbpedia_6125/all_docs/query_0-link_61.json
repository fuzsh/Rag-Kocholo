        "text": "A remake of the 1984 teen dance movie “Footloose” hit theaters the Friday before last. I was there. Movies about young people doing new dances that grown-ups consider filthy and low-class have been around for years. (See “Rock Around the Clock,” from 1956.) The form probably peaked in the late seventies and early eighties. “Saturday Night Fever,” from 1977, is the jewel in the crown. “Grease” (1978) and “Fame” (1980) are also wonderful. They are not as deep and touching as “Saturday Night Fever,” but in my experience, all teen dance movies have serious messages.\n\nAbout the social hierarchy, for one thing. In most of these films, two dance styles, representing two different social classes, confront each other. As a rule, this means ballet versus some form of “street,” the latter ranging from jazz dance (roughly the kind of thing you see on Broadway) to break-dancing. I don’t have to say what socioeconomic tiers these styles stand for. In “Saturday Night Fever” and elsewhere, what attracts the boy to the girl is partly that she is a ballet student. That is, she has class. In “Step Up,” from 2006, the title comes right out and says it. If Tyler, a foster child who spends his life break-dancing and stealing cars, can land Nora, who eats dinner in a formal dining room with clanking silverware, he will have a chance for a future as an upstanding citizen.\n\nThe divide may be racial as well as social. The subject of race is in front of our faces from beginning to end in “Hairspray,” both the 1988 original and the 2007 remake. When the cast isn’t dancing, they’re picketing for integration. (The film is set in 1963, in East Baltimore.) Furthermore, this film, more than any other I know, acknowledges that rock ‘n’ roll music and dancing were a melding of black and white talents, and that the black preceded the white. In some films, the couple is mixed-race. In the very touching “Save the Last Dance,” the boy (Sean Patrick Thomas) is black and the girl (Julia Stiles) is white. People stare at them on the bus. In one important film the main character is mixed-race. Jennifer Beals, the star of the hugely popular “Flashdance,” had an African-American father. This is not acknowledged in the movie but I think it is there subliminally, and that its purpose is to symbolize what the moviemakers believe are the special powers of dance: that it promotes unity, defeats injustice. In the words of the trailer for “Step Up 3,” “People dance because dance can change things. One move can bring people together.”\n\nTo add to the liberal credentials of the teen dance movies, they are notably feminist, even the old ones. In “Footloose,” the heroine, Ariel, however décolleté, beats the crap out of her old boyfriend. (He had it coming.) In the beginning of “Flashdance,” Alex (Beals) is being pursued by her employer, Nick. If she were to bag him, this would greatly improve her circumstances. (She is a steelworker by day and an exotic dancer by night.) Indeed, she might get installed in his nice big house with mullioned-glass windows. But no, she pushes him away, telling him that she doesn’t believe in dating the boss. These girls are brave.\n\nAnd bravery is the main theme of the teen dance movie. Normally, the courage is hard-won, as folklorists will tell you is traditionally the case with young heroes. Almost all the protagonists of these films face harsh circumstances. They are poor. They have dead-end jobs, if they have jobs. Few of them have both a mother and a father at home, and even if they do, the parents usually disapprove of dance. When we encounter the young protagonists, they are sinking in this mire, and the turning point of the movie, almost always, is the moment when someone gives them a lecture on having guts. “Don’t you understand?” Nick says to Alex in “Flashdance.” “When you give up your dream, you die.” She wants to try out for the Pittsburgh Dance and Repertory Company, but she’s afraid to audition, because she’s never had a formal dance class.\n\nThe frightened teen-ager may also be subject to the Gipper effect. In “Save the Last Dance,” Sara’s mother died in a car wreck as she was rushing to get to Sara’s audition at Juilliard. Sara then gives up ballet. The kids from poor families have it worse, of course. In “Step Up,” Tyler is choreographing a dance with Nora for the showcase or the finals or whatever big test it is that almost invariably provides the climax of these movies. Then Tyler’s best friend’s little brother, Skinny—whom Tyler loved—is killed in a street shooting, and Tyler throws up his hands. He doesn’t want to try any more. There follows the lecture on guts, which, touchingly, comes from Skinny’s brother, who had previously told him that dancing was a sissy thing. No matter who delivers the lecture, it has its effect, and our hero or heroine, re-galvanized, goes on to glory. Importantly, though, he does not abandon his native dance style. Instead, he combines it with the other one. The vaunted fusion is achieved.\n\nBut most of what I’ve said about these dance movies is subtext, or pretext. The text is dance itself. This does not mean the choreography. The editing is usually so choppy that you can’t see the choreography, if there is any. The goal is to excite—as with MTV, the model here—and also, in certain cases, to disguise the presence of body doubles. The stars of these movies are sometimes chosen for their looks and their “presence” rather than for their dancing ability, the premier example being Beals in “Flashdance.” (Most of her dancing, carefully lit, was done by a French powerhouse, Marine Jahan.) But from what I can tell, the hiring principle is usually the opposite. The main cast members are selected for dancing ability, which explains why their acting is often so bad."
