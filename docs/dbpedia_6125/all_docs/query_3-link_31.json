        "text": "Director: Hal Ashby\n\nCast: Ruth Gordon, Bud Cort\n\nBest quote: 'Oh, Harold, that's wonderful. Go and love some more.'\n\nDefining moment: In a field of daisies overlooking a vast military cemetery, Maude explains her philosophy of life.\n\nAge shall not wither them\n\nThe hippy era was full of movies that attempted to confront square society, to shock viewers into some undefined form of action. How many of them are still effective today? But ‘Harold and Maude’, the gentle flipside of the revolutionary dream, is every bit as charming, affecting and surprising as it must have been on its first release. Partly this is because none of its themes have gone out of date: we still live in a world of empty privilege and rigid hierarchy, petty authority and relentless conformism. So the idea of a teenage boy (Cort) shacking up with a batty old woman (Gordon) is still a challenge to social norms. Best of all, ‘Harold and Maude’ is also still devastatingly romantic: a story of soulmates, in the most literal sense. TH\n\nBuy, rent or watch ‘Harold and Maude’\n\nDirector: Terrence Malick\n\nCast: Martin Sheen, Sissy Spacek\n\nBest quote: ‘He wanted to die with me and I dreamed of being lost forever in his arms.’\n\nDefining moment: After killing her father, Holly and Kit burn down her childhood home, and her actual childhood along with it.\n\nIn the late 1950s, teenager Charles Starkweather and his 14-year-old girlfriend, Caril Ann Fugate, went on a killing spree, murdering 11 people across Nebraska and Wyoming before being apprehended. It was a major ‘loss of innocence’ moment for America: how could two of its own, raised in the heartland, do something so heinous, and at such a young age? The incident looms large in the country’s mythos, inspiring songs by Bruce Springsteen and Oliver Stone’s hyper-violent spectacle Natural Born Killers. It also forms the basis of Terrence Malick’s hypnotic and lyrical debut feature. Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek are Kit and Holly – not precise avatars for Starkweather and Fugate, but clearly inspired by them – who jumpstart their life of crime by killing Holly’s father (Warren Oates) then head for the Canadian border, leaving a trail of bodies in their wake. But Malick, in what would become his signature, does not sensationalise their misdeeds, instead approaching them almost nonchalantly and not giving in to easy explanations. From Spacek’s flowery narration to the wondrous midwestern landscapes, it remains one of the most beguiling films from a director who’d eventually build a career from holding audiences in a trance. MS.\n\nBuy, rent or watch ‘Badlands’\n\nDirector: Jacques Demy\n\nCast: Catherine Deneuve, Nino Castelnuovo\n\nBest quote: 'People only die of love in the movies.'\n\nDefining moment: A sad, bittersweet meeting in the snow, two lovers seeing each other for the first time in years.\n\nAll things bright and beautiful\n\nYou'd need to have a sliver of ice lodged in your heart not to be moved by ‘The Umbrellas of Cherbourg’ – a musical that has even hardened musical-haters melting into puddles. Not that it’s a musical in the belt-‘em-out tradition. Instead, every word is sung rather than spoken as 17-year-old Geneviève (Deneuve) falls sweetly and madly in love with car mechanic Guy (Castelnuovo).\n\n‘Umbrellas’ is one of the most ravishing films ever made, wrapped in candyfloss colours to match the blush of first love. When Guy is drafted to fight in Algeria, Geneviève is certain she will die of grief. But time passes and Geneviève doesn’t die. Love fades. And that’s the bittersweet message inside this exquisitely sugar coated pill. CC\n\nBuy, rent or watch ‘The Umbrellas of Cherbourg’\n\nDirector: Baz Luhrmann\n\nCast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes\n\nBest quote: 'A plague on both your houses! They have made worms’ meat of me.'\n\nDefining moment: DiCaprio and Danes making loved-up eyes at each other through the glass and water of a fish tank.\n\nFrom the Globe to the ghetto\n\nBaz Luhrmann had some cast-iron source material to work with in the form of Shakespeare’s story – but the Australian writer-director took the playwright’s romantic tragedy to another place entirely with this ultra-modern reworking. At the same, he never lost sight of the essence of Shakespeare’s tale of two young lovers doomed from the first time they lay eyes on each other.\n\nThe moment that Romeo (DiCaprio, so young!) and Juliet (Danes, so young too!) meet at a wild fancy-dress party is pure bliss to watch, just as Luhrmann’s staging of the final death scene is almost impossible to bear. There are guns, hip-hop, open-topped cars and characters so larger-than-life that the whole thing now, in retrospect, feels like Tarantino directing a season-finale episode of ‘Dynasty’. It’s mad, musical and immensely moving. DC\n\nBuy, rent or watch ‘William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet’\n\nDirector: Wes Anderson\n\nCast: Jared Gilman, Kara Hayward, Bruce Willis, Bill Murray\n\nBest quote: 'It's possible I may wet the bed, by the way.'\n\nDefining moment: Sam and Suzy kiss an awkward kiss on the beach.\n\nChildren, behave\n\nRomance isn't the first thing you expect from a Wes Anderson film, but in this delightful 1960s-set tale, the American auteur employs all his usual tricks – hip soundtrack, arch dialogue, super-careful production design – in the service of a story about the chaos and madness of young love.\n\nSam and Suzy are 12-year-olds on the run. Suzy is precocious and independent; Sam is nerdy and serious. They don't get very far, but a mile's a long way when you're 12, and danger is never far away. What's lovely is how seriously Anderson takes Sam and Suzy's adventure, while also laying on the humour and the irony. By the time the pair steal a smooch on a deserted beach, we're totally smitten. DC\n\nBuy, rent or watch ‘Moonrise Kingdom’\n\nDirector: Emile Ardolino\n\nCast: Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey\n\nBest quote: ‘I'm scared of everything. I'm scared of what I saw, I'm scared of what I did, of who I am, and most of all I'm scared of walking out of this room and never feeling the rest of my whole life the way I feel when I'm with you.’\n\nDefining moment: If there’s a better metaphor for exiting adolescence than ‘The Lift’, we ain’t seen it.\n\nNo actor could sell a goofy premise like Patrick Swayze. Whether playing the ghost of a murder victim trying to have one last shag with his wife, a bank-robbing zen-philosopher surfer, or a Catskills dance instructor from the wrong side of the tracks, he could elevate some of the silliest material to classic status through magnetism alone. Don’t get it wrong, Dirty Dancing is still plenty silly, part of a spate of movies in the ’80s about young people dancing themselves out of oppressive situations. But it’s far and away the best of those movies, owing largely to Swayze’s smooth movies, gloriously feathered mullet and eternal smoulder. Let’s not discount Jennifer Grey, though, one of cinema’s most believable girl-next-doors, who, during one memorable summer, is quite literally lifted out of teenagerdom and passed into adulthood by a hunky stranger. It was the time of her life, y’know. MS.\n\nBuy, rent or watch ‘Dirty Dancing’\n\nDirectors: Jerome Robbins, Robert Wise\n\nCast: Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, Russ Tamblyn\n\nBest quote: 'There’s a place for us, somewhere…'\n\nDefining moment: It’s as camp as Christmas, but Maria (Wood) singing ‘I Feel Pretty’ while anticipating her next date with Tony (Beymer) is a magical moment of romantic exuberance.\n\nThe song of the streets\n\nBaz Luhrmann’s ‘Romeo + Juliet’ may have made all the tweeners’ hearts melt (and scored a higher place on this list), but the real hep chicks and finger-poppin’ daddies know which version of Shakespeare’s play is the real leader of the pack.\n\n‘West Side Story’ is like no other musical: sure, it’s sappy (‘Mariaaaaaaaaaa’) and slightly ridiculous, but it’s also brazenly political (‘if you’re all white in A-me-ri-ca!’), sneakily self-mocking (‘Hey, I got a social disease!’) and ferociously, aggressively emotional: the operatic finale is a masterclass in three-hanky audience manipulation. Also, the film contains perhaps the single best song ever written for the musical theatre: ‘Somewhere’, the ultimate romantic ballad for trapped and dreaming lovers. TH\n\nBuy, rent or watch ‘West Side Story’\n\nDirector: Tim Burton\n\nCast: Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder\n\nBest quote: Kim: 'Hold me.' Edward: 'I can’t.'\n\nDefining moment: Kim dances in the ‘snow’ Edward makes from an ice sculpture in sunny California.\n\nCuts you up\n\nThe scariest thing about Burton’s gothic fairy tale is reading the list of actors who were considered for the part of Edward, the man with scissors for hands created by a scientist. The studio insisted Burton meet Tom Cruise (who believed the story needed a ‘happier ending’). Michael Jackson badly wanted the part. Tom Hanks turned it down.\n\nFinally, Burton got his way and cast Johnny Depp, who, like a Camden goth Charlie Chaplin, plays Edward with a dash of slapstick and sad-eyed loneliness (watch Edward’s scissor fingers twitch when he’s nervous). It was the beginning of a beautiful friendship between Depp and Burton, who’ve made seven films together since. Not such a happy ending for Depp and his co-star and then-girlfriend, Ryder. They split in 1993. CC\n\nBuy, rent or watch ‘Edward Scissorhands’\n\nDirector: Lukas Moodyson\n\nCast: Rebecca Liljeberg, Alexandra Dahlström, Erica Carlson\n\nBest quote: 'We must be out of our damn minds. But we are so fucking cool.'\n\nDefining moment: An impulsive snog in the back of a car as Foreigner’s ‘I Want to Know What Love Is’ cranks up on the soundtrack.\n\nI know you can show me\n\nRomance and social transgression go hand in hand in Lukas Moodysson’s gorgeous and empathetic story of two high-school girls whose love affair scandalises the small Swedish town of Åmal. Concerns about distribution and awards probably explain why the original title – ‘Fucking Åmal’ – got changed to the cosier and less confrontational ‘Show Me Love’. But in no other area does Moodysson compromise: the emotions are raw, the romance giddy, the truths it exposes impossible to ignore. TH\n\nDirector: Bill Forsyth\n\nCast: John Gordon Sinclair, Dee Hepburn, Clare Grogan\n\nBest quote: 'Hard work being in love, eh?'\n\nDefining moment: Gregory (Sinclair) realises that the women in his life have all ganged up to get him into the ‘wrong’ girl’s clutches.\n\nThe beautiful game\n\nFiguring out who we’re in love with is, of course, a key part of the romantic process. Too many films feature lightning-bolt moments, where the rightness of a match is obvious and irrevocable – cue happy ending. So it’s nice that there are a few movies out there saying, well, hang on a minute. Love at first sight is all very well, but isn’t that a rather shallow and reckless way to select a mate?\n\n‘Gregory’s Girl’ starts with the lightning bolt – gangly Glaswegian Gregory spots leggy keepy-uppy expert Dorothy (Hepburn) – then patiently explains why, for someone as irrational and irregular as Gregory, that kind of perfect love probably won’t work. So why not try someone a little closer to home? The result is pragmatic, sure, but that doesn’t make it any less romantic. TH\n\nBuy, rent or watch ‘Gregory's Girl’\n\nDirector: Nick Cassavetes\n\nCast: Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams\n\nBest quote: ‘I think our love can do anything we want it to.’\n\nDefining moment: That rain-soaked kiss you see above.\n\nSparks' notes\n\nAt this point, there is no middle ground when it comes to The Notebook. No one thinks it’s ‘pretty good,’ ‘totally fine’ or ‘just okay.’ You either think it’s cringeworthy, manipulative treacle, or it’s the greatest love story ever told, and nothing any critic could possibly write would sway your opinion in the other direction. Thus, it ends up on a list like this mostly by default. If you’re talking about cinematic romance, no movie that engenders those kinds of polarising feelings can go without mentioning, no matter how we actually feel about it. And anyway, we wouldn’t want the diehards threatening to firebomb our offices if we left it off.\n\nWe will say this, though: put aside your adult cynicism for two hours, and it’s easy to see why The Notebook has continued to resonate with generations of (mostly) teenagers. For all its cliches, it’s the only adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel to really stick in the public imagination, and that’s because, more than most movies, it encapsulates the idealised vision of true love only kids who haven’t yet had their hearts broken believe in. It helps that stars Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams fully commit to their roles, he as the simple country boy, she the young heiress whose parents forbid her to date below her station. They believe in this star-crossed affair and all its twists, turns and tragedies, and so the audience does as well. And when you get right down to it, there’s nothing wrong with that. MS\n\nBuy, rent or watch ‘The Notebook’\n\nDirector: Elia Kazan\n\nCast: Natalie Wood, Warren Beatty, Pat Hingle\n\nBest quote: 'My pride? My pride? I don't want my pride!'\n\nDefining moment: The young lovers break from their frenzied necking as waters symbolically cascade in the background.\n\nYouth in revolt\n\nRural Kansas, 1928, when ‘nice’ girls were supposed to hold out until the wedding night. Every fibre of her being is telling high-schooler Natalie Wood she wants alpha male Warren Beatty right now, but his oil magnate dad has decided she’s too ordinary for marriage. Welcome to a world before contraception, as acclaimed playwright William Inge’s Oscar-winning script puts in place a devastating conflict between fundamental human desires and layers of obfuscating social hypocrisy.\n\nBoth in their early twenties at the time, Beatty and Wood make a sensual couple, as director Kazan constructs a pristine vision of Americana, played against a coruscating narrative where yearning slides uncontrollably into hysteria. Wood’s startling performance deserved an Oscar but got only a nomination. TJ\n\nBuy, rent or watch ‘Splendor in the Grass’\n\nDirector: Jason Reitman\n\nCast: Ellen Page, Michael Cera\n\nBest quote: 'I still have your underwear.' 'I still have your virginity.'\n\nDefining moment: Baby, schmaby: it’s all about Juno declaring her love for geeky Paulie Bleeker.\n\nQue Cera, Cera\n\nOn release, first-time scriptwriter Diablo Cody’s Oscar-winning unplanned teen pregnancy comedy ‘Juno’ was all-but obscured by one debate: was it a pro-lifer tract deceptively gussied up in indie clothing?\n\nThe film’s abortion issues are still up for debate; leaving that aside for a moment, what’s left is a sweetly funny romantic comedy about relationships both teen- and middle-aged, and love of many kinds: parental, romantic and platonic. And sure, the teen-speak might bear about as much resemblance to real teenage slang as the actors in ‘Grease’ did to actual teenagers, but Ellen Page and Michael Cera’s performances remain pitch perfect. CB\n\nBuy, rent or watch ‘Juno’\n\nDirector: Cameron Crowe\n\nCast: John Cusack, Ione Skye\n\nBest quote: 'I gave her my heart, she gave me a pen.'\n\nDefining moment: Y’know, the scene where John Mahoney curls into the fetal position in a bathtub is pretty underrated. Just kidding. It’s the one with the Peter Gabriel song.\n\nThe Dobler Effect\n\nHe’s a new wave hipster with vague aspirations of becoming a professional kickboxer. She’s the school valedictorian with a great smile whose ambition has left her with no real friends. It’s a classic set-up for a mismatched young-adult romance, but Cameron Crowe packs his directorial debut with so many sharp insights and quirky details that it nearly stands outside the teen romcom genre, transcending even John Hughes and ending up closer to Annie Hall or its most obvious inspiration, The Graduate.\n\nComing from one of the foremost chroniclers of restless youth, though, it exudes far more hormonal energy than either – and much less cynicism about boy-girl relationships. This is where the world fell in love with John Cusack as Lloyd Dobler, cinema’s most charming slacker, and Ione Skye is equally crushworthy as the overachieving-yet-underconfident Diane Court. (And a shoutout to Lili Taylor’s caustically lovesick Corey Flood, who certainly has her share of admirers as well.) No character is a pure archetype but complicated in the way real teens are – and while few actual teenagers in the ‘80s may have ever attempted to woo their crush by blasting a Peter Gabriel song out their window before Lloyd Dobler, certainly many took a shot after him. MS\n\nDirector: Luca Guadagnino\n\nCast: Armie Hammer, Timothée Chalamet, Michael Stuhlbarg, Amira Casar\n\nBest quote: ‘But to feel nothing so as not to feel anything – what a waste!’\n\nDefining moment: When Elio escapes the luxurious monotony of the Italian summer and gets intimate with a peach.\n\nThe fruits of young love\n\nBased on the acclaimed novel by André Aciman and with an Oscar-winning screenplay written by James Ivory (yes, of Merchant Ivory heritage), ‘Call Me By Your Name’ is more than just a bittersweet meditation on the enduring impact of a summer romance.\n\nDirector Luca Guadagnino captures the confusion, simmering lust and crackling tension between precocious and thoughtful 17-year-old Elio (Chalamet) and the allure of the older, magnetic and dashingly handsome Oliver (Hammer). Elio’s obsessive nature and infantile arrogance, as well as his fraught desires, are captured so vividly that, regardless of whether or not you’ve ended up screwing a slightly older man in your parents’ summer house in northern Italy, it still feels oddly recognisable and nostalgic. The stirring monologue delivered by Elio’s father (Stuhlbarg) about the necessity of pain and heartbreak throbs with empathy, as does the film’s final scene of Elio sitting in front of the hearth weeping. It’s a gentle and devastating coming-of-age romance that’ll leaving you aching and ready to book a holiday to Italy. AK\n\nBuy, rent or watch ‘Call Me By Your Name’\n\nDirector: Tomas Alfredson\n\nCast: Kåre Hedebrant, Lina Leandersson\n\nBest quote: 'If I wasn't a girl... would you like me anyway?'\n\nDefining moment: Eli crosses the threshold to show Oskar why she needs an invite.\n\nMy bloody valentine\n\nVampiric love stories needn’t involve brooding, sparkling bloodsuckers and entanglements with hunky werewolves. In this Scandinavian insta-classic, vampirism is effectively a metaphor for preteen loneliness, and the emotions are as warm as the landscape is icy. In a Swedish suburb, a 12-year-old outcast named Oskar forges a strong bond with a girl named Eli who doesn’t seem to have many other friends either, for reasons that are both similar and drastically different. Director Tomas Alfredson handles the young, burgeoning romance with great sensitivity and skill, turning in something like a moody John Hughes movie that just happens to feature a whole lot of dismemberings at its climax. Trust us, it’ll make your heart swell more than your skin crawl. MPS.\n\nBuy, rent or watch ‘Let the Right One In’"
