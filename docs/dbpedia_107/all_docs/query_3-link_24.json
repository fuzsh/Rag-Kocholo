        "text": "A framework for assessing Health Economic Evaluation (HEE) quality appraisal instruments.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLanger, Astrid\n\n2012-08-16\n\nHealth economic evaluations support the health care decision-making process by providing information on costs and consequences of health interventions. The quality of such studies is assessed by health economic evaluation (HEE) quality appraisal instruments. At present, there is no instrument for measuring and improving the quality of such HEE quality appraisal instruments. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to establish a framework for assessing the quality of HEE quality appraisal instruments to support and improve their quality, and to apply this framework to those HEE quality appraisal instruments which have been subject to more scrutiny than others, in order to test the framework and to demonstrate the shortcomings of existing HEE quality appraisal instruments. To develop the quality assessment framework for HEE quality appraisal instruments, the experiences of using appraisal tools for clinical guidelines are used. Based on a deductive iterative process, clinical guideline appraisal instruments identified through literature search are reviewed, consolidated, and adapted to produce the final quality assessment framework for HEE quality appraisal instruments. The final quality assessment framework for HEE quality appraisal instruments consists of 36 items organized within 7 dimensions, each of which captures a specific domain of quality. Applying the quality assessment framework to four existing HEE quality appraisal instruments, it is found that these four quality appraisal instruments are of variable quality. The framework described in this study should be regarded as a starting point for appraising the quality of HEE quality appraisal instruments. This framework can be used by HEE quality appraisal instrument producers to support and improve the quality and acceptance of existing and future HEE quality appraisal instruments. By applying this framework, users of HEE quality appraisal instruments can become aware of methodological deficiencies\n\nWill HEE and LETBs deliver the 'right nurse'?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWhile, Alison\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThe restructuring of the NHS in England will see the loss of strategic health authorities, with their workforce education remit being transferred to a completely new structure comprising Health Education England (HEE) and Local Education and Training Boards (LETBs). HEE will provide national oversight of strategic workforce planning and allocate the education and training budget, and will also be responsible for national schemes like junior doctor training. The LETBs will be populated by representatives of health-care providers and professionals, and will be the interface with HEE. They will be charged with ensuring high-quality outcomes from educational investment and meeting the needs of health-care delivery, patients and the public. The universities, colleges, employers and other local education providers will remain responsible for educating the health-care workforce.\n\nLasva veetorn-galerii = Lasva water tower-gallery / Veronika Valk\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nValk, Veronika, 1976-\n\n2010-01-01\n\nLasva veetorni rekonstrueerimisest klavertrepiga kunstigaleriiks-vaatetorniks.

Brazil is a country with no tradition in the production and use of health economic evaluation (HEE) to guide decision making in the public health system. It is only within the last two decades that HEEs using a microeconomic approach have appeared in the academic field. On a national level, HEE and Health Technology Assessment (HTA), in a wider sense, were first taken into account in 2003. Two policies deserve to be mentioned - (i) the regulation of medicines in the Brazilian market, and (ii) science, technology and innovation policy. The latter required the fostering of applied research to encourage the application of methods which employ systematic reviews and economic analyses of cost-effectiveness to guide the incorporation of technologies in the Brazilian health care system. The Ministry of Health has initiated the process of incorporating these new technologies on a federal level during the last ten years. In spite of the improvement of HEE methods at Brazilian universities and research institutes, these technologies have not yet reached the governmental bodies. In Brazil, the main challenge lies in the production, interpretation and application of HEE to all technologies within the access scheme(s), and there is limited capacity building. Setting priorities can be the solution for Brazil to be able to perform HEE for relevant technologies within the access scheme(s) while the universal coverage system struggles with a triple burden of disease.

It is shown that in a certain range of the ejection angle and for the large momentum transfer the yield of the 1 D resonance dominates over the 1 P resonance one. 12 refs.; 4 figs\n\nPhysical functioning and life style of 50-65 yearsâ age hee teachers\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nO.V. Baskevich\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Purpose: to study life style of 50-65 yearsâ age university teachers depending on their physical functioning and its connection with behavior habits. Material: questioning of 150 respondents was fulfilled by specially prepared questionnaire. Anthropometric testing was conducted. Results: it was found that most of the questioned spend time watching TV or reading and pay very little attention to physical functioning. We also found that most of respondents deal with household chores but want to do something outdoors (practice public activity. There is a trend to avoid smoking among them. Only 5.0% are cigarette smokers. The rest have never smoked or gave up smoking more than 10 years ago. Among the partners of the questioned there are a lot of smokers (16.2%. Most of the questioned have friends and relatives, who can help to achieve the highest level of physical functioning. 18.9% of partners of the questioned regularly practice sports. Some useful for health habits are observed in life situations of all respondents. Conclusions: the received data witness about purposefulness of seeking of effective ways of pre retirement age HEE teachersâ involvement in active recreational functioning. We have also found that there are time reserves for this purpose.\n\nInfluence of study in hee on ubiquity and strength of studentsâ computer gambling\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nM.D. Kudryavtsev\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Purpose: to clear up effectiveness of learning-education process for counteraction of studentsâ harmful passion to computer gamesâ ubiquity. Material: 1st - 3rd year students (main health group were the objects of the research. In total they were 952 boys and 523 girls. In 1st year studentsâ academic groups testing was carried out ant the beginning of academic year (October; in academic groups of 1st-3rd year students the testing was at the end of academic year (May. Results: it was found that among 1st year boy students ubiquity of computer gaming as well as time losses, connected with it are higher than among girl students. Educational process is not sufficiently effective in struggle against computer gaming. For girls, this passion is not dangerous in general. In the course of study at HEE, the strength of this passion reduces independent on sex. Conclusions: for increase of educational processâs effectiveness and improvement of studentsâ life quality it is necessary to consider personal features of boy students as well as to organize health related measures with the help of health related physical culture means.\n\nHotelli Palace**** renoveerimine = Renovation of the hotel Palace**** / Argo Vaikla\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nVaikla, Argo, 1966-\n\n2015-01-01\n\nHotell Palace Tallinnas Vabaduse vÃ¤ljak 3, valminud 2014.

We have previously reported that biocleavable polyrotaxanes (PRXs) composed of Î²-cyclodextrins (Î²-CDs) threaded onto a linear polymer capped with bulky stopper molecules via intracellularly cleavable linkers show remarkable cholesterol reducing effects in NPC disease patient-derived fibroblasts owing to the stimuli-responsive intracellular dissociation of PRXs and subsequent Î²-CD release from the PRXs. Herein, we describe a series of novel acid-labile 2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl group-modified PRXs (HEE-PRXs) bearing terminal N-triphenylmethyl (N-Trt) groups as a cleavable component for the treatment of NPC disease. The N-Trt end groups of the HEE-PRXs underwent acidic pH-induced cleavage and led to the dissociation of their supramolecular structure. A kinetic study revealed that the number of HEE groups on the PRX did not affect the cleavage kinetics of the N-Trt end groups of the HEE-PRXs. The effect of the number of HEE groups of the HEE-PRXs, which was modified to impart water solubility to the PRXs, on cellular internalization efficiency, lysosomal localization efficiency, and cholesterol reduction ability in NPC disease-derived fibroblasts (NPC1 fibroblasts) was also investigated. The cellular uptake and lysosomal localization efficiency were almost equivalent for HEE-PRXs with different numbers of HEE groups. However, the cholesterol reducing ability of the HEE-PRXs in NPC1 fibroblasts was affected by the number of HEE groups, and HEE-PRXs with a high number of HEE groups were unable to reduce lysosomal cholesterol accumulation. This deficiency is most likely due to the cholesterol-solubilizing ability of HEE-modified Î²-CDs released from the HEE-PRXs. We conclude that the N-Trt group acts as a cleavable component to induce the lysosomal dissociation of HEE-PRXs, and acid-labile HEE-PRXs with an optimal number of HEE groups (4.1 to 5.4 HEE groups per single Î\n\nHealth effects engineering: Perspectives for environmental health and environmental engineering studies-domestic biomass combustion as an example\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGao Xiang; Yu Qi; Chen Limin\n\n2007-01-01\n\nHealth effects engineering (HEE) is a newly developed research field, which involves collaboration with environmental scientists, engineering researchers, and toxicologists. By employing the methods of HEE, one can not only confirm which attributes of the project are likely to contribute to certain health effects, but can also get rid of the adverse health effects by engineering technologies. HEE is thought to be particularly important to domestic projects in which there is a lack of environmental assessment. This paper presented the authors' viewpoints of the principles of HEE in the field of the environmental health and engineering studies by using programs of domestic biomass combustion as an example. The authors showed that there are three sub-fields of HEE, which are as follows: engineering behavior, the pollution characteristics, and the health effects. The authors conclude that the principles of HEE compose a helix with the studies in the fields of environmental science, health, and engineering, and give suggestions on how to perform HEE in a practical field\n\nSystematic Review of Health Economic Evaluation Studies Developed in Brazil from 1980 to 2013\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nTassia Cristina Decimoni\n\n2018-02-01\n\nFull Text Available BackgroundBrazil has sought to use economic evaluation to support healthcare decision-making processes.

We assessed the effectiveness of laughter therapy in preventing radiation dermatitis in patients with breast cancer. Methods: Thirty-seven patients were prospectively enrolled in this study. Eighteen patients were assigned to the experimental group and the other 19 patients were assigned to the control group. The patients who were assigned to the experimental group received laughter therapy during RT. Laughter therapy was started at the onset of RT and was provided twice a week until completion of RT. The patients who were assigned to the control group only received RT without laughter therapy. The grade of radiation dermatitis was scored by a radiation oncologist who was blinded to subject assignment. The patients' evaluation of pain within the RT field was also assessed. Results: In the experimental group, radiation dermatitis of grade 3, 2, and 1 developed in five (33.3%, five (33.3%, and five patients (33.3%, respectively. In comparison, in the control group, radiation dermatitis of grade 3, 2, 1, and 0 developed in seven (36.8%, nine (47.4%, two (10.5%, and one patient (5.3%, respectively. The experimental group exhibited a lower incidence of grade 2 or worse radiation dermatitis than the control group (33.3% versus 47.4%. The mean maximal pain scores in the experimental and control group were 2.53 and 3.95, respectively. The experimental group complained of less severe pain than the control group during RT.

We discovered a novel bioactivity of H. erinaceus in its ability to suppress adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-induced calcium signaling in neuronal PC12 cells. ATP, known primarily as a neurotransmitter, also acts on purinoceptors (P2 purinergic receptor [P2R]) to generate the cellular calcium signaling and secretion that mediate P2R physiological manifestations, including pain. Chronic pain reduces quality of life. However, constant analgesic administration can cause liver and kidney injury, as well as loss of the analgesic effect because of desensitization. In this study we investigated the analgesic potential of H. erinaceus through measurements of ATP-induced Ca2+ signaling in cell lines and observation of pain behaviors in mice. In P2R-coupled Ca2+ signaling measurements, extracts of H. erinaceus mycelia (HEEs) blocked ATP-induced Ca2+ signaling in both rat PC12 cells and human HOS cells. HEEs completely blocked ATP-induced Ca2+ signaling in human HOS cells, suggesting that this effect of HEEs is exerted through the P2R subtypes present in HOS cells, which include the P2X4, P2X7, P2Y2, and P2Y4 subtypes. In observations of animal behavior during pain, HEEs significantly reduced heat-induced pain, including postponing both the tail-flick response to heat stimulation and the paw-lifting response to a hot plate. This study demonstrates novel characteristics of H. erinaceus in reducing nociceptive behavior and blocking the functional activity of P2R. Further studies are required to verify this linkage and its molecular mechanisms.\n\nConstruction of a Thermal Vacuum Chamber for Environment Test of Triple CubeSat Mission TRIO-CINEMA\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJeon, Jeheon; Lee, Seongwhan; Yoon, Seyoung; Seon, Jongho; Jin, Ho; Lee, Donghun; Lin, Robert P.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nTRiplet Ionospheric Observatory-CubeSat for Ion, Neutron, Electron & MAgnetic fields (TRIO-CINEMA) is a CubeSat with 3.14 kg in weight and 3-U (10 Ã 10 Ã 30 cm) in size, jointly developed by Kyung Hee University and UC Berkeley to measure magnetic fields of near Earth space and detect plasma particles.

A.; Johnston, M. H.; Davis, J. H.; Oh, T. K.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nA series of copper-nickel alloys were fabricated, notched tensile specimens machined for each alloy, and the specimens tested in 34.5 MPa hydrogen and in air. A notched tensile ratio was determined for each alloy and the hydrogen environment embrittlement (HEE) determined for the alloys of 47.7 weight percent nickel to 73.5 weight percent nickel. Stacking fault probability and stacking fault energies were determined for each alloy using the x ray diffraction line shift and line profiles technique. Hydrogen environment embrittlement was determined to be influenced by stacking fault energies; however, the correlation is believed to be indirect and only partially responsible for the HEE behavior of these alloys.\n\nOn holographic entanglement entropy with second order excitations\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHe, Song; Sun, Jia-Rui; Zhang, Hai-Qing\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe study the low-energy corrections to the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) in the boundary CFT by perturbing the bulk geometry up to second order excitations. Focusing on the case that the boundary subsystem is a strip, we show that the area of the bulk minimal surface can be expanded in terms of the conserved charges, such as mass, angular momentum and electric charge of the AdS black brane. We also calculate the variation of the energy in the subsystem and verify the validity of the first law-like relation of thermodynamics at second order. Moreover, the HEE is naturally bounded at second order perturbations if the cosmic censorship conjecture for the dual black hole still holds.\n\nProductivity effects of higher education human capital in selected countries of Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKoye Gerry Bokana\n\n2017-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This study aimed to analyse the productivity effects of higher education enrolment (HEE, higher education output (HEO and the associated productivity gap (GP on selected countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA over the period between 1981 and 2014. It was hypothesized in the study that HEE and HEO had statistically significant positive impact on productivity in the selected sub-Saharan Africa countries over the stated period. Fixed effect Least Square Dummy Variable (LSDV and a robust version of System Generalized Methods of Moment (SYSGMM were adopted as model estimating techniques. Results from the LSDV model indicated that HEE had no statistically significant positive impact on productivity growth in the twenty-one SSA countries. This non-significance was corrected in the dynamic model, but with negative effects on the growth rate of total factor productivity (TFP. The study further compared the worldwide technological frontier with those of the SSA countries under investigation and discovered that countries like Gabon, Mauritius and Swaziland ranked high, while Burundi needs to improve on its productivity determinants. The major conclusion of this study is therefore that higher education human capital should be supported with strong policy implementation, as this can have a positive impact on productivity growth.\n\nGothic bindings and their restoration / Endel Valk-Falk\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nValk-Falk, Endel, 1932-\n\n2008-01-01\n\nGooti stiilist kÃ¶itekunstis, kahjustustest keskaegsetel kÃ¶idetel ja nende restaureemisest TA Raamatukogus.

This study evaluates the antioxidant activity of ethanol or hot water extracts from the residues of coffee after brewing. An extraction experiment was carried out using the conventional solidâliquid methods, including ethanol and water as the extraction media at different temperatures and liquid/solid ratios. The antioxidant activity of extracts was tested for total phenolic compound (TPC, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH, and 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS using oil emulsion and raw/cooked meat systems. The DPPH radical scavenging activity of the ethanol extracts with heating (HEE and without heating (CEE were higher than that of the hot water extracts (WE. The highest DPPH value of HEE and CEE at 1000 ppm was 91.22% and 90.21%, respectively. In oil emulsion and raw/cooked systems, both the water and ethanol extracts had similar antioxidant effects to the positive control (BHA, but HEE and CEE extracts showed stronger antioxidant activities than WE extract. These results indicated that the ethanol extracts of coffee residue have a strong antioxidant activity and have the potential to be used as a natural antioxidant in meat.\n\nHee, Over herstel, Empowerment en ervaringsdeskundigheid in de psychiatrie\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nPim van Heijst\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHet boek is een verkenning, beschrijving en evaluatie van de mogelijkheden tot âherstelâ na psychische crisis(sen), waarbij de ervaringsdeskundigheid van de auteur een belangrijke rol speelt.

This case report demonstrates successful management of late-onset Streptococcus mitis endophthalmitis treated by vitrectomy, panretinal photocoagulation (PRP and silicone oil tamponade. A 75-year-old man presented with painful vision loss in his right eye. The patient had uneventful phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation in the right eye at an outside clinic 6Â weeks prior. Examination disclosed hypopyon and vitritis, as well as discrete inflammatory collections in the vitreous. The patient underwent vitrectomy with PRP and silicone oil tamponade. Vitreous cultures were positive for S. mitis, a pathogen associated with severe tissue damage and poor clinical outcomes. One month after the surgery, intraocular inflammation was stabilized, and visual acuity was improved from light perception to 20/200. Aggressive surgical management may play a role in improving outcomes in these patients.

Data were taken from Q 2 =1.1-4.7 GeV 2 for a fixed center-of-mass energy of W=2.14 GeV. The ratio of Ï L and Ï T was extracted from the measured cross sections for 1 H, 2 H, 12 C, and 63 Cu targets at Q 2 =2.15 and 4.0 GeV 2 , allowing for additional studies of the reaction mechanism. In this article, we present the experimental setup and the analysis of the data in detail, including systematic uncertainty studies. Differential cross sections and nuclear transparencies as a function of the pion momentum at different values of Q 2 are presented. Our results are consistent with the predicted early onset of color transparency in mesons. Global features of the data are discussed and the data are compared with model calculations for the 1 H(e,e ' Ï + )n reaction from nuclear targets.\n\nGenomics education for medical professionals - the current UK landscape.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSlade, Ingrid; Subramanian, Deepak N; Burton, Hilary\n\n2016-08-01\n\nGenomics education in the UK is at an early stage of development, and its pace of evolution has lagged behind that of the genomics research upon which it is based. As a result, knowledge of genomics and its applications remains limited among non-specialist clinicians. In this review article, we describe the complex landscape for genomics education within the UK, and highlight the large number and variety of organisations that can influence, direct and provide genomics training to medical professionals. Postgraduate genomics education is being shaped by the work of the Health Education England (HEE) Genomics Education Programme, working in conjunction with the Joint Committee on Genomics in Medicine. The success of their work will be greatly enhanced by the full cooperation and engagement of the many groups, societies and organisations involved with medical education and training (such as the royal colleges). Without this cooperation, there is a risk of poor coordination and unnecessary duplication of work. Leadership from an organisation such as the HEE Genomics Education Programme will have a key role in guiding the formulation and delivery of genomics education policy by various stakeholders among the different disciplines in medicine.

At first it was found that this steel shows a dramatic and consistent decrease of its ductility with time of corrosion. The ductility reduction as well as microfailure features obtained by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)-fractographic analysis yields an acceptable evidence for the occurrence of the Hydrogen Environmental Embrittlement (HEE) phenomenon during the corrosion process. During tensile straining the MBE-signal increases monotically at an average constant rate towards necking point. This rate shows tendency to increase with corrosion time fact which helped to establish the existence of a corrosion-induced micromagnetic hardening rate effect. It was shown that the main contribution to this effect should be attributed primarily to the combined effect of the HEE and dislocation multiplication and to a lower extent to the formed magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) surface layers.

For in-situ degradation of HD and its analogues (simulants), i.e., dibutyl sulphide (DBS) and ethyl 2-hydroxyethyl sulphide (HEES), different adsorbents systems loaded with (1R)-(-)-(camphorylsulphonyl) oxaziridine were prepared. Solution of sulphur mustard and its simulants was prepared in carbon tetrachloride and taken for uniform adsorption on the impregnated systems using incipient volume. Degradation kinetics monitored by GC/FID were found to be first-order. The half-life of degradation reactions for simulants was obtained in less than 30 and for HD in 120 min. From the studied kinetics it was observed that reaction was very rapid with simulants and decreased rate was found for HD. The order of reactivity of MgO/Oxa system for HD and simulants was found to be DBS > HEES > HD. Reaction products of the oxidation reaction of simulants and HD on adsorbents were extracted in dichloromethane and analysed by GC-MS. The products were found to be non-toxic sulphoxide. The objective of the study is to develop a reactive adsorbent for in-situ degradation of sulphur mustard which could be used in nuclear biological and chemical (NBC) filtration systems.\n\nPositron Emission Tomography: Principles, Technology, and Recent Developments\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZiegler, Sibylle I.\n\n2005-04-01\n\nPositron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medical imaging technique for quantitative measurement of physiologic parameters in vivo (an overview of principles and applications can be found in [P.E.

Material: in the research 40 girl students participated. Motor skills level was tested with the help of state and additional tests. Results: it was found that for training quickness it is necessary to use rope skipping in mode, corresponding to development of this quality. For training maximal strength it is purposeful to use more complex power exercises in ground part of the complex. Conclusions: implementation of rope skipping means in dance aerobic trainings increases training influence on practically all motor skills. Rope skipping permits to doze and regulate training load. The same under musical accompaniment develop sense of rhythm. In some modes such jumps facilitate training of speed power qualities and power endurance.\n\nSpectroscopic Observations of Geo-Stationary Satellites Over the Korean Peninsula\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nD. K.

P.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe prairie pothole region (PPR) extends over approximately 700,000 km2 in the Great Plains region in United States and Canada and is a critical breeding ground for migratory waterfowl, as well as an important ecosystem for diverse invertebrates and aquatic plants (van der Valk, 2003). Consisting of up to 12 million permanent and temporary depressional wetlands, the PPR is negatively impacted by non-point source pesticide pollution due to extensive agricultural development in the region. Recent studies have shown that high (mM) levels of sulfate in the pothole lakes are capable of abiotically reducing dinitroaniline and chloroacetanilide pesticides (Zeng, 2011; Zeng, 2012). In this study the transformation of the organophosphorus pesticide chlorpyrifos (CP) and its analog chlorpyrifos-methyl (CPM) was studied using pore waters sampled from two pothole lakes. CP and CPM have been found to react in the laboratory with sulfur species via a SN2 mechanism, with degradation by sulfur compounds occurring faster than hydrolysis at high pH (Wu, 2006). To date the reaction of CP and CPM in natural environments with sulfur species has not been studied. Chlorpyrifos-methyl underwent rapid degradation in the presence of reduced sulfur species in pore water, while chlorpyrifos degradation occurred at significantly slower rates. Both CP and CPM degradation occurred at comparable rates to what has been previously observed in the laboratory (Wu, 2006). References van der Valk, Arnold G., and Roger L.

We assessed the accuracy of high-frequency epicardial echocardiography and power Doppler imaging in evaluating coronary arteries during coronary artery bypass grafting without cardiopulmonary bypass. To validate measurements of coronary arteries and graft anastomoses by high-frequency epicardial echocardiography and power Doppler imaging, we compared luminal diameters determined by these methods with diameters determined histologically in a study of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting in 20 dogs. Technical errors were deliberately created in 10 grafts (stenosis group). The results of these animal validation studies showed that the maximum luminal diameters of coronary arteries and graft anastomoses measured by high-frequency epicardial echocardiography (HEE) and power Doppler imaging (PDI) correlated well with the histologic measurements: HEE = 1.027 x Histologic measurements + 0.005 (P anastomoses were examined intraoperatively by high-frequency epicardial echocardiography and power Doppler imaging, and luminal diameters determined by power Doppler imaging were compared with those determined by postoperative coronary angiography.

In addition to pure hydrogen gas as a direct source for the absorption of atomic hydrogen, the damaging effect can manifest itself from other hydrogen-containing gas species such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S), hydrogen chloride (HCl), and hydrogen bromide (HBr) environments. It has been known that H2S environment may result in a much more severe condition of embrittlement than pure hydrogen gas (H2) for certain types of alloys at similar conditions of stress and gas pressure. The reduction of fracture loads can occur at levels well below the yield strength of the material. Hydrogen embrittlement is usually manifest in terms of singular sharp cracks, in contrast to the extensive branching observed for stress corrosion cracking. The initial crack openings and the local deformation associated with crack propagation may be so small that they are difficult to detect except in special nondestructive examinations. Cracks due to HE can grow rapidly with little macroscopic evidence of mechanical deformation in materials that are normally quite ductile. This Technical Memorandum presents a comprehensive review of experimental data for the effects of gaseous Hydrogen Environment Embrittlement (HEE) for several types of metallic materials. Common material screening methods are used to rate the hydrogen degradation of mechanical properties that occur while the material is under an applied stress and exposed to gaseous hydrogen as compared to air or helium, under slow strain rates (SSR) testing. Due to the simplicity and accelerated nature of these tests, the results expressed in terms of HEE index are not intended to necessarily represent true hydrogen service environment for long-term exposure, but rather to provide a practical approach for material screening, which is a useful concept to qualitatively evaluate the severity of\n\nNear threshold electroproduction of the Ï meson at Q2â 0.5 GeV2\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAmbrozewicz, P.; Mitchell, J.; Dunne, J.; Abbott, D.J.; Carlini, R.; Ent, R.; Mack, D.J.; Wood, S.; Yan, C.; Markowitz, P.; Martoff, C.J.; Reinhold, J.; Zeidman, B.; Arrington, J.; Bailey, K.; Cummings, W.J.; Gao, H.; Geesaman, D.F.; Hansen, J.-O.; O'Neill, T.G.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nElectroproduction of the Ï meson was investigated in the 1 H(e,e ' p)Ï reaction.

We find a new type of Wald entropy, which appears on entangling surface without the rotational symmetry and reduces to usual Wald entropy on Killing horizon. Furthermore, we obtain a formal formula of HEE for the most general higher derivative gravity and work it out exactly for some squashed cones. As an important application, we derive HEE for gravitational action with one derivative of the curvature when the extrinsic curvature vanishes. We also study some toy models with non-zero extrinsic curvature. We prove that our formula yields the correct universal term of entanglement entropy for 4d CFTs. Furthermore, we solve the puzzle raised by Hung, Myers and Smolkin that the logarithmic term of entanglement entropy derived from Weyl anomaly of CFTs does not match the holographic result even if the extrinsic curvature vanishes. We find that such mismatch comes from the âanomaly of entropyâ of the derivative of curvature. After considering such contributions carefully, we resolve the puzzle successfully. In general, we need to fix the splitting problem for the conical metrics in order to derive the holographic entanglement entropy. We find that, at least for Einstein gravity, the splitting problem can be fixed by using equations of motion. How to derive the splittings for higher derivative gravity is a non-trivial and open question. For simplicity, we ignore the splitting problem in this paper and find that it does not affect our main results.\n\nPrevention of Lung Carcinogenesis by Suppressing Pathogenic CD4 T Cells\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2017-05-01\n\nintestinal inflammation by reducing TH17 cells and preserving group 3 innate lymphoid cells .

P.; Tvaskis, V.; Boeglin, W.; Markowitz, P.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe 1 H(e,e ' Ï + )n cross section was measured at four-momentum transfers of Q 2 =1.60 and 2.45 GeV 2 at an invariant mass of the photon nucleon system of W=2.22 GeV. The charged pion form factor (F Ï ) was extracted from the data by comparing the separated longitudinal pion electroproduction cross section to a Regge model prediction in which F Ï is a free parameter. The results indicate that the pion form factor deviates from the charge-radius constrained monopole form at these values of Q 2 by one sigma, but is still far from its perturbative quantum chromodynamics prediction\n\nLaste jumalapilt ja usuÃµpetus usuvÃµÃµras kontekstis / Anna-Katharina Szagun ; tÃµlkinud Pille Valk\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nSzagun, Anna-Katharina\n\n2008-01-01\n\nArtikkel on kokkuvÃµte raamatus Dem sprachlosen Sprache verleihen.

K. Lee\n\n2001-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Low resolution spectroscopic observations of geo-stationary satellites over the Korean peninsula have been carried out at the KyungHee Optical Satellite Observing Facility (KOSOF with a 40cm telescope. We have observed 9 telecommunication satellites and 1 weather satellite of 6 countries. The obtained spectral data showed that satellites could be classified and grouped with similar basic spectral feature. We divided the 10 satellites into 4 groups based on spectral slop and reflectance. It is suggested that the material types of the satellites can be determined through spectral comparisons with the ground laboratory data. We will continuously observe additional geo-stationary satellites for the accurate classification of spectral features.\n\nMilitary Authoritarian Regimes and Economic Development: The ROK’s Economic Take-Off Under Park Chung Hee\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2008-12-01\n\nand the Personalization of Power in Malaysia ,\" Comparative Politics 36, no. 1 (Oct. 2003), 81-101. 2 Talcott Parsons, Theories of Society...BAIR (bureaucratic-authoritarian industrializing regime).21 The annual growth rate of HPAEs eight countries (Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia ...industries, and finally Samsung Electronics, POSCO, Daewoo shipbuilding, Hyundai Heavy were developed.58\n\nMeasurement of the reaction 2H(e,e') at 180 degrees close to the deuteron breakup threshold.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRyezayeva, N; ArenhÃ¶vel, H; Burda, O; Byelikov, A; Chernykh, M; Enders, J; Griesshammer, H W; Kalmykov, Y; von Neumann-Cosel, P; Ozel, B; Poltoratska, I; Pysmenetska, I; Rangacharyulu, C; Rathi, S; Richter, A; Schrieder, G; Shevchenko, A; Yevetska, O\n\n2008-05-02\n\nInclusive inelastic electron scattering off the deuteron under 180 degrees has been studied at the S-DALINAC close to the breakup threshold at momentum transfers q=0.27 fm;{-1} and 0.74 fm;{-1} with good energy resolution sufficient to map in detail the spin flip M1 response, which governs the starting reaction pn-->dgamma of big-bang nucleosynthesis over most of the relevant temperature region.

The Netherlands which is a representative windturbine country, Spain which is a theme country of this travel, Greece which is a root country of the windmills, and the UK with the Windturbine Museum were visited. In the Netherlands, photographs of Kinder d`eiche Windturbine, Leiden de Valk Windturbine Museum, and a windturbine in the south end of Amstle Park were taken. Photographs of don Quijote Windturbine at Campo de Criptana in Spain, and Crete Windturbine and sail-type windturbine in the Rhodes Island, Greece were taken. In the UK, the Windturbine Museum was visited at Wimbledon. After coming back to Japan, films were exposed. The walls of windturbines were dark due to insufficient exposure against the light sky. In spite of consideration of the exposure, 70% of the photographs of windturbine walls were still dark. Only 10% of them can be available. This may be a limit of amateur photographer.

[National Cooperative for the Disposal of Radioactive Waste (NAGRA), Wettingen (Switzerland); and others\n\n2017-04-15\n\nThe paper presents an overview of the behaviour of Opalinus Clay under thermal loading as observed in three in situ heating tests performed in the Mont Terri rock laboratory: HE-B, HE-D and HE-E. The three tests are summarily described; they encompass a broad range of test layouts and experimental conditions. Afterwards, the following topics are examined: determination of thermal conductivity, thermally-induced pore pressure generation and thermally-induced mechanical effects. The mechanisms underlying pore pressure generation and dissipation are discussed in detail and the relationship between rock damage and thermal loading is examined using an additional in situ test: SE-H. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the various thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) interactions identified in the heating tests.
