There are diverse ways of their transmission; the study attempts to determine the level of intestinal parasitic contamination on vegetables sold in Jos. Sample of 200 each of Tomatoes (Lycopersium sativus), Letus (Loctus satival) Carrot (Davcus carota L) Cabbage (Brassica Denceal) and Green leafy vegetables were analyzed using standardized Centrifugal-floatation technique methods. Of the 1250 samples of vegetables examined, 450 (36.0%) were positive for intestinal parasites, cabbage recorded the highest prevalence of 64% while tomatoes had the least prevalence of 20%. Vegetables in Jos are heavily contaminated with intestinal parasites and there is need for public enlightenment campaign on the danger of consuming inadequately washed and prepared vegetables.\n\nInternational Conference on Organometallic Chemistry (13th) Held in Torino, Europe on 4-9 September 1988.

Foucault argues that the problem of simulation permeates the entire history of modern psychiatry. After initial analysis of JosÃ© Ingenieros's references to the question of simulation in the struggle for existence, the issue of simulation in pathological states in general is examined, and lastly the simulation of madness and the problem of degeneration. Ingenieros participates in the epistemological and political struggle that took place between experts-psychiatrists and simulators over the question of truth.\n\nFrom Combat to Collaboration: The Labor-Management Partnership in San JosÃ© Unified School District.

Using a multistage cluster sampling technique, 290 respondents were recruited in Jos 7 to 9 months after the riot. Data were collected regarding demographics, exposure to traumatic events, and psychological symptoms. Resting pulse and blood pressure were recorded. A total of 145 (52.5%) witnessed or were victims of personal attacks, 165 (59.6%) lost their possessions, 56 (20.7%) had their homes burned, 44 (16.2%) witnessed relatives' deaths, and 8 (2.9%) were robbed. A total of 252 (89.7%) of the respondents met reexperiencing criteria, 138 (49.1%) met avoidance criteria, and 236 (84.0%) met arousal criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A total of 116 (41%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 36% to 47%) met all three categories for PTSD. Only personal attacks (adjusted odds ratio = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.7 to 4.7) and a heart rate of 90 beats/min or more (adjusted odds ratio = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.4 to 5.8) were significantly related to PTSD in a multivariate model.\n\nUse of Portfolio Assessment Technique in Teaching Map Sketching and Location in Secondary School Geography in Jos, Nigeria\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nUgodulunwa, Christiana; Wakjissa, Sayita\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis study investigated the use of portfolio assessment technique in teaching map sketching and location in geography in Jos, Nigeria.

Entire communities were inundated by flood waters as numerous streams reached peak stages and discharges far greater than previous floods in the Flint, Ocmulgee, and Choctawhatchee River basins. The flooding resulted in 33 deaths in towns and small communities along or near the overflowing streams. President Clinton declared 78 counties as Federal disaster areas: 55 in Georgia, 10 in Alabama, and 13 in Florida. The Flint River and Ocmulgee River basins in Georgia experienced floods that exceeded the 100-year recurrence interval discharge along almost their entire lengths. Travel was disrupted as railroad and highway bridges and culverts were overtopped an, in many cases, washed out. Total flood damages to public and private property were estimated at nearly $1 billion dollars. The destruction caused by this storm serves to emphasize the high cost imposed upon life and property by flood disasters; and thus, highlight the importance of preparing for, monitoring, and documenting such occurrences.\n\nA McOndo Writer's Take on Literature in the Era of Audiovisual and Digital Communication: The Case of Alberto Fuguet's \"Las Peliculas de mi vida\"\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMaier, Linda S.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAlberto Fuguet, one of the leaders of the McOndo writers who seek cultural direction from the United States and exploit mass-media formulas, is a polarizing figure in contemporary Latin American culture.

It created a mass casualty situation in the Jos University Teaching Hospital. We present the result of the hospital management of that mass casualty incident. To share our experience in the management of the mass casualty situation arising from the sectarian crisis of Jos in January 2010. We retrospectively reviewed the hospital records of patients who were treated in our hospital with injuries sustained in the Jos crisis of January 2010. A total of 168 patients presented over a four day period. There were 108 males (64.3%) and 60 females (35.7%). The mean age was 26 Â± 16 years. Injury was caused by gunshots in 68 patients (40.5%), machete in 56 (33.3%), falls in 22 (13.1%) and burning in 21 (13.1%). The body parts injured were the upper limbs in 61(36.3%) patients, lower limbs 44 (26.2%) and scalp 43 (25.6%). Majority, 125 (74.4%) did not require formal operative care. Fourteen (8.3%) patients had complications out of which 10 (6.0%) were related to infections. There were 5 (3.1%) hospital mortalities and the mean duration of hospital stay was 4.2 days. The hospital operations returned to routine 24 hours after the last patient was brought in. As a result of changes made to our protocol, management proceeded smoothly and there was no stoppage of the hospital response at any point. This civil crisis involved mostly young males. Injuries were mainly lacerations from machete and gunshot injuries. Majority of the victims did not require formal surgical operations beyond initial care. Maintaining continuity in the positions of the Incident commander and the mass casualty commander ensure a smooth disaster response with fewer challenges.\n\nBarriers and Facilitators to Community CPR Education in San JosÃ©, Costa Rica.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchmid, Kristin M; Mould-Millman, Nee-Kofi; Hammes, Andrew; Kroehl, Miranda; GarcÃ­a, Raquel Quiros; McDermott, Manrique UmaÃ±a; Lowenstein, Steven R\n\n2016-10-01\n\nBystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) improves survival after prehospital cardiac arrest. While community CPR training programs have been implemented across the US, little is known about their acceptability in non-US Latino populations. The purpose of this study was to identify barriers to enrolling in CPR training classes and performing CPR in San JosÃ©, Costa Rica. After consulting 10 San JosÃ© residents, a survey was created, pilot-tested, and distributed to a convenience sample of community members in public gathering places in San JosÃ©. Questions included demographics, CPR knowledge and beliefs, prior CPR training, having a family member with heart disease, and prior witnessing of a cardiac arrest. Questions also addressed barriers to enrolling in CPR classes (cost/competing priorities). The analysis focused on two main outcomes: likelihood of registering for a CPR class and willingness to perform CPR on an adult stranger. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated to test for associations between patient characteristics and these outcomes. Among 371 participants, most were male (60%) and <40 years old (77%); 31% had a college degree. Many had family members with heart disease (36%), had witnessed a cardiac arrest (18%), were trained in CPR (36%), and knew the correct CPR steps (70%). Overall, 55% (95% CI, 50-60%) indicated they would \"likely\" enroll in a CPR class; 74% (95% CI, 70-78%) would perform CPR on an adult stranger. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation class enrollment was associated with prior CPR training (OR: 2.6; 95% CI, 1.6-4.3) and a prior witnessed cardiac arrest (OR: 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5). Willingness to perform CPR on a stranger was associated with a prior witnessed cardiac arrest (OR: 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-5.4) and higher education (OR: 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.2). Believing that CPR does not work was associated with a higher likelihood of not attending a CPR class (OR: 2.4; 95% CI, 1.7-7.9). Fear of performing mouth-mouth, believing CPR is against God\n\nPublic-private mix in tuberculosis control: an assessment of level of implementation in Jos, Plateau State.\n\nPubMed\n\nDaboer, J C; Lar, L A; Afolaranmi, T O; Bupwatda, P W; Dani, N\n\n2013-12-01\n\nAfter the initial gains in Tuberculosis case detection and cure rates, progress became stunted by persisting constraints and challenges in the implementation of the Directly Observed Treatment Short course strategy. This prompted the Stop Tuberculosis partners in 2006 to adopt innovative approaches including the Public-Private Mix, to improve access to and quality of care. This paper assesses the level of Public-Private Mix in Tuberculosis control in Jos, Plateau State. This was a facility-based, cross sectional study where data from all consenting private health care facilities owned by medically trained personnel and private medical practitioners in Jos North and Jos South Local Government Areas was collected using structured questionnaires. Eight (47.1%) of all 17 facilities assessed gave anti Tuberculosis drugs on clinical suspicion of Tuberculosis, 5(29.4%) required Acid Fast Bacillus result and 3(17.6%) referred elsewhere for the Tuberculosis management. Only 6 facilities (35.3%) were microscopy, treatment centres, or both. Ten (58.8%) of the facilities had the Directly Observed Treatment Short course guidelines, but these could be sighted in only 5 (29.4%), while six (35.3%) had Tuberculosis record and referral forms. In 13 (76.5%) of the facilities, no local government Tuberculosis and Leprosy supervisors had ever visited them. Only 30 (57.7%) medical practitioners had access to the Directly Observed Treatment Short course. Thirty two (61.5%) respondents treated Tuberculosis according to the Directly Observed Treatment Short course strategy, but 19 (36.5%) still used the conventional method. Only 22(42.3%) practitioners had ever received any training on the Directly Observed Treatment Short course strategy. The level of Public-Private Mix in Tuberculosis control in Jos is low.\n\nAbdominal injuries in communal crises: The Jos experience\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOjo, Emmanuel Olorundare; Ozoilo, Kenneth N.; Sule, Augustine Z.; Ugwu, Benjamin T.; Misauno, Michael A.; Ismaila, Bashiru O.; Peter, Solomon D.; Adejumo, Adeyinka A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground: Abdominal injuries contribute significantly to battlefield trauma morbidity and mortality. This study sought to determine the incidence, demographics, clinical features, spectrum, severity, management, and outcome of abdominal trauma during a civilian conflict. Materials and Methods: A prospective analysis of patients treated for abdominal trauma during the Jos civil crises between December 2010 and May 2012 at the Jos University Teaching Hospital. Results: A total of 109 victims of communal conflicts with abdominal injuries were managed during the study period with 89 (81.7%) males and 20 (18.3%) females representing about 12.2% of the total 897 combat related injuries. The peak age incidence was between 21 and 40 years (range: 3â71 years). The most frequently injured intra-abdominal organs were the small intestine 69 (63.3%), colon 48 (44%), and liver 41 (37.6%). Forty-four (40.4%) patients had extra-abdominal injuries involving the chest in 17 (15.6%), musculoskeletal 12 (11%), and the head in 9 (8.3%). The most prevalent weapon injuries were gunshot 76 (69.7%), explosives 12 (11%), stab injuries 11 (10.1%), and blunt abdominal trauma 10 (9.2%). The injury severity score varied from 8 to 52 (mean: 20.8) with a fatality rate of 11 (10.1%) and morbidity rate of 29 (26.6%). Presence of irreversible shock, 3 or more injured intra-abdominal organs, severe head injuries, and delayed presentation were the main factors associated with mortality. Conclusion: Abdominal trauma is major life-threatening injuries during conflicts. Substantial mortality occurred with loss of nearly one in every 10 hospitalized victims despite aggressive emergency room resuscitation. The resources expenditure, propensity for death and expediency of timing reinforce the need for early access to the wounded in a concerted trauma care systems.

Bleger played a central role in the constitution of the 'psy movement' and, in more general terms, in the diffusion of a 'psy culture' in Argentina, a country that today is considered as one of the 'world capitals of psychoanalysis'. However, his trajectory showed not only the limits of his projects in the increasingly politically polarized Argentina of the 1960s, as well as their internal contradictions, but also the difficulties of articulating different identities in those agitated times. Through an analysis of Bleger's trajectory this article explores larger issues of Argentine political culture and their relations with the emergence of a psychoanalytic culture.\n\nHistorical performance of particulate settleable in a municipality located in the ceramic cluster of CastellÃ³n (Spain)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPardo, P.; Sanfeliu, TeÃ³filo; Soriano, A.; PallarÃ©s, S.; Vicente, A. B.\n\n2010-05-01\n\nAir pollution can be defined as: \"the introduction into the atmosphere by man, directly or indirectly, of substances or energy with have effects deleterious of such a nature that endangers human health, causing damage to biological resources and to ecosystems, which impair material goods and to harm or interfere with amenities and other legitimate uses of the environment\". One of the main pollutants in air is the particulate matter. This material particulate includes settleable, particles larger than 10 Î¼m that remain airborne for relatively short periods of time. For what its effects are most pronounced in the vicinity of the emitting sources. The study area is located in the city of Alcora. This population is located in the region eastern of the province of Castellon (Spain). The municipality of Alcora has a high industrial density, highlighting framed companies in chemical industry and non-metallic mineral products. The area has a high traffic density due to the proximity of population to various roads. These two factors point peaks rise high concentration of atmospheric particulate pollutants. The purpose of this paper is conducting a retrospective view of the evolution of settleable particulate concentrations. Settleable particulate samples were collected with a sensor BRITISH STANDARD PS particles during the period between January 2000 and December 2005.

A retrospective analysis of the records of patients managed in the Jos civil crisis of September 2001, in Plateau State, Nigeria. Information extracted included demographic data of patients, mechanisms of injury, nature and site of injury, treatment modalities and outcome of care. A total of 463 crisis victims presented over a 5 day period. Out of these, the records of 389 (84.0%) were available and analyzed. There were 348 (89.5%) males and 41 females (10.5%) aged between 3 weeks and 70 years, with a median age of 26 years. Most common mechanisms of injury were gunshot in 176 patients (45.2%) and blunt injuries from clubs and sticks in 140 patients (36.0%). Debridement with or without suturing was the most common surgical procedure, performed in 128 patients (33%) followed by exploratory laparotomy in 27 (6.9%) patients. Complications were documented in 55 patients (14.1%) and there were 16 hospital deaths (4.1% mortality). Challenges included exhaustion of supplies, poor communication and security threats both within the hospital and outside. Most patients reaching the hospital alive had injuries that did not require lifesaving interventions. Institutional preparedness plan would enable the hospital to have an organized approach to care, with better chances of success. More effective means of containing crises should be employed to reduce the attendant casualty rate.\n\nSeroprevalence of fowl pox antibody in indigenous chickens in jos north and South council areas of plateau state, Nigeria: implication for vector vaccine.\n\nPubMed\n\nAdebajo, Meseko Clement; Ademola, Shittu Ismail; Oluwaseun, Akinyede\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFowl pox is a viral disease of domestic and wild birds.

Although the disease has been described in both commercial and indigenous chickens in Nigeria, data are limited on seroprevalence in free range chickens. Such data are, however, important in the design and implementation of fowl pox virus vector vaccine. We surveyed current antibody status to fowl pox virus in free range chickens by testing 229 sera collected from 10 villages in Jos North and Jos South LGA of Plateau State Nigeria. Sera were analyzed by AGID against standard fowl pox antigen. Fifty-two of the 229 (23%) tested sera were positive for fowl pox virus antibody, and the log titre in all positive specimen was >2. Thirty (21%) and twenty-two (27%) of the samples from Jos South and Jos North, respectively, tested positive. This was, however, not statistically significant (P = 0.30). Generally the study showed a significant level of antibody to fowl pox virus in the study area. This observation may hinder effective use of fowl pox vectored viral vaccine.

Healthcare students are more vulnerable because of direct contact with patients' body fluids and blood. Risk perception of HBV and HB vaccine uptake are also poor. The aim of this study was to assess the level of risk perception of hepatitis B infection, and uptake of the HBV vaccine, between medical and other students of the University of Jos. A comparative cross sectional study was conducted among 1,200 students of the departments of Medicine, Nursing sciences and Public Administration, University of Jos (400 from each arm) using a pretested self-administered questionnaire. A five point Likert scoring system was used to assess risk perception. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20. A P -value of <0.05 was considered significant. Awareness on HB vaccine prevention was high (88.4%) among University of Jos students. Awareness was similar among medical and nursing students (36.2% and 36.0% respectively) but lower among public administration student (27.8%), P< 0.001. The overall risk perception was 76.8%. This was also similar for medical and nursing students (40.7% and 40.1% respectively), but lower for public administration students (9.1%), P< 0.001. Risk perception is 5x higher among medical students compared to public administration students (OR = 5.22, 95% CI = 2.19 - 12.93; P < 0.001). The uptake of full dose HB vaccine was 60.2%, 20.6% and 15.1% for medical, nursing and public administration students respectively. Medical students are 4x more likely to go for HB vaccination compared with public administration students (OR=3.62; 95% CI=2.39 - 5.48; P< 0.001). Awareness and risk perception on HBV infection are high among University of Jos students, but uptake of HB vaccine is low.

Chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology of the National University of CÃ³rdoba and founder of the Cornea and Glaucoma Surgical Center in the same city, in 1956 he created the first residency programme in Ophthalmology in his country. He founded the first Eye Bank and introduced one of the first argon laser photocoagulators in South America. He authored around 200 scientific presentations and publications, describing new findings and clinical entities. Thus, his individualisation of the cyclovertical component in strabismus contributed to important evolution of ideas concerning pathogenesis and therapy in oculomotor disorders of infancy. He was the first to propose the dehydration of the vitreous body in glaucoma patients before ocular surgery and developed a fixation pick and scleral depressor for retinal detachment surgery. He also described a new technique, the V-Z procedures for the correction of senile ectropion. In 1968, he published his DÃ©collement de la rÃ©tine, considered a masterpiece in retinal detachment literature for many years. Urrets-ZavalÃ­a died in his native city at the age of 89. His prolific scientific and educational contributions make him one of the most brilliant and influential ophthalmologists of the 20th-century.

This study assessed the entrepreneurial skills of community pharmacists, the business performance of community pharmacies and the impact of their entrepreneurial skills on business performance. A cross sectional survey was conducted by administering a pretested questionnaire to 30 community pharmacists in Jos. An adaptation of the Bernelli model and the expanded Katz (1974)/Herron (1990) Skill Typology Model was used to assess nine entrepreneurial skills - product, organizational, industry, networking, leadership, executive, entrepreneurial, marketing and money skills; while sales growth, net profit and stock growth were used to assess business performance. Frequency distribution of results was presented, with further analysis done with the Epi-Info software using the chi square test of association. The results from this study showed that community pharmacies in Jos do possess requisite entrepreneurial skills, but to varying extents. Product skills ranked highest while money skills and entrepreneurial skills ranked least, portraying a need for skills enhancement in these areas. Business performance was suboptimal, being rated as average or poor by 56.6% of respondents. However, most respondents (90%) still assessed their businesses as profitable. Money skills had a significant impact on business performance (P=0.03) and stock growth (P=0.04); while stock growth was significantly affected by leadership skills (P=0.002) and entrepreneurial skills (0.02).

Born in CittÃ di Castello, a small town in the region of Umbria, he earned a medical degree from the University of Perugia. While serving in the Ethiopian campaign and in World War II, first as a frontline soldier and then as a physician, he was captured and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in Hereford, Texas. It was there that Burri disavowed the medical profession and began to paint. He held a pivotal position in the modern post-war era, exhibiting in Rome and New York in the early 1950s. The present article describes an in-depth scientific investigation of a selection of 14 paintings by Burri, each belonging to one of his series: Sacchi (sacks), Bianchi (whites), Catrami (tars), Muffe (molds), Gobbi (hunchbacks), Legni (woods), Combustioni plastiche (plastic combustions), Ferri (irons), Cretti (monochromatic fields of induced craquelure), and Cellotex (compositions on flayed fiberboard). Elemental information obtained non-invasively via X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy was here combined with detailed characterization of the pigments, extenders, binders, and plastics by means of micro-invasive techniques, including pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies, and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX) spectroscopy. Through the joint use of traditional artists' materials along with industrial products newly introduced to the market, Burri appears to have encapsulated space into highly dramatic compositions at the boundaries between painting and relief sculpture.\n\nHaemoglobin variants among voluntary blood donors in Jos, Nigeria: the implications on blood transfusion.\n\nPubMed\n\nDamulak, O D; Bolorunduro, S A; Egesie, J O; Yakubu, K; Godit, P; Smith, O A\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe normal haemoglobin is an efficient transporter of oxygen to the tissues and carbondioxide from tissues to the lungs for elimination. Various abnormal haemoglobin variants including, the sickle cell diseases, have been described with varying sickling tendencies. This study aimed to determine the haemoglobin variants among voluntary blood donors in Jos. Records of the age, sex, Haemoglobin level, and the haemoglobin genotype of all voluntary blood donors who donated blood at the National Blood Transfusion Service Centre, Jos, Nigeria between January 2011 and April 2012; and their haemoglobin levels and protein electrophoresis determined, were reviewed. A total of 937 blood donors, 658 (70.23%) males and 279 (29.79%) females, mean age 32.4 years, donated blood voluntarily, their haemoglobin electrophoretic patterns determined by alkaline cellulose acetate electrophoresis. Donor blood haemoglobin levels were determined by automation. Haemoglobin protein electrophoretic patterns identified among our donors were 77.70% AA, 21.88% AS, 0.22% SC, 0.11% AC and 0.11% SS. Mean haemoglobin levels of the donors according to their haemoglobin proteins electrophoretic patterns were, 150.4 +/- 12.5 gms/l for AA, 151.9 +/- 13.8 gms/l for AS and 131.1 +/- 5.0 gms/l for haemoglobin SC. Determination of haemoglobin protein electrophoretic patterns of blood unit for transfusion could enhance selective blood issuing based on recipient's haemoglobin type.\n\nReticulospinal neurons in anamniotic vertebrates: a celebration of Alberto Stefanelli's contributions to comparative neuroscience.\n\nPubMed\n\nZottoli, Steven J; Cioni, Carla; Seyfarth, Ernst-August\n\n2007-10-19\n\nOver the past 76 years Alberto Stefanelli has successfully used a comparative approach to study the nervous system. His main research focus during that time has been on identifiable reticulospinal neurons including MÃ¼ller and Mauthner neurons found in anamniotic vertebrates. Born in Venice, Italy in 1908, Professor Stefanelli pursued most of his academic career at the University of Rome, where he retired as Chair of Comparative Anatomy in 1978. His seminal work on the constancy in number and position of giant identifiable reticulospinal neurons in the brains of larval and adult lampreys, and his assertion that only a subset of these neurons were MÃ¼ller cells, provided the framework in which subsequent authors have refined our understanding of the cellular anatomy, axonal projections, physiology, and function of MÃ¼ller cells in the control of movement. Stefanelli has also provided the most comprehensive study to date of the Mauthner cell and its axon cap. His description of the differences in axon cap structure among many fishes and amphibians and his use of the \"morpho-ecological\" approach to determine Mauthner cell function has provided the basis for future studies on the neuronal basis of behavior and its evolution. As Professor Stefanelli approaches his 100th birthday, we celebrate his scientific contributions to comparative neuroscience with a biographical sketch of his life, an overview of his scientific accomplishments, and our view of how his comparative studies continue to contribute to our understanding of the nervous system.\n\n[History of Instituto de Investigaciones CardiolÃ³gicas Alberto C. Taquini in its 60th anniversary].\n\nPubMed\n\nMilei, Jose; Trujillo, Jose Maria\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe Instituto de Investigaciones CardiolÃ³gicas (ININCA) was founded by Alberto C. Taquini in 1944 and directed by him during more than 50 years, until his death in 1998. The Institute was (and still is) dedicated to research in connection with CONICET (National Research Council) and to teaching within the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Buenos Aires. From the very beginning research was centered on hypertension, hypoxia and hemodynamic adaptations, renal physiology and electrolytes, arterial wall, cardiac metabolism, myocardial pharmacology and regulation of the circulation by the central nervous system. On the basis of Taquini's autobiographical notes, the experiments are reported which eventually led to the discovery of hypertensin, angiotensin and their relation with renin, together with the discussions promoted by the diverse hypotheses proposed by both national and international groups of investigators as the mechanism of hypertension. Taquini also played an important role in promoting science at national levels including his role as the first Secretary of Science and Technology from 1968 to 1971. He believed that scientific research is something more than planning and producing, that it also involves creating knowledge. As such he made many contributions to science, formed many disciples, and directed an Institute which is demonstrating its continuity.\n\nList of Participants\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2011-08-01\n\nAbigail Alvarez OlarteCINVESTAV Alba Leticia Carrillo MonteverdeDCI-UG Alberto CarramiÃ±anaINAOE Aldo MorselliFERMI Alejandro CastillaDCI-UG Alejandro IbarraTechnical University of Munich Alma D Rojas PachecoFCFM-BUAP Alma Xochitl Gonzalez MoralesInstituto de Ciencias Nucleares, UNAM Andrew Walcott BeckwithAmerican Institute of Beam Energy Physics Ariadna Montiel ArenasDepartamento de FÃ­sica, CINVESTAV Arnulfo ZepedaCinvestav Arturo Alvarez CruzInstituto de Fisica, UNAM Axel de la MacorraUNAM, IAC Azar MustafayevUniversity of Minnesota Benjamin JaramilloDCI-UG Vincent BertinCPPM-Marseille Carlos Alberto Vaquera-AraujoDCI-UG Carlos MuÃ±ozMadrid Autonoma U. & Madrid, IFT Carmine PagliaroneINFN, FNAL Carolina Lujan PeschardDCI-UG Christiane Frigerio MartinsUniversidade Federal do ABC-SÃ£o Paulo Csaba BalazsMonash University David DelepineDCI-UG David G CerdenoUniversidad Autonoma de Madrid & Instituto de Fisica Teorica Debasish MajumdarSaha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata, India Dibyendu PanigrahiKandi Raj College, Kandi, Murshidabad, INDIA-742137 Dupret Alberto Santana BejaranoUniversidad de Sonora Departamento de Investigacion en Fisica Ernest MaRiverside U.C.

Accident analysis is, therefore, restricted to aggregate data on trends, magnitude and temporal dimensions. This article addresses the road accident problem in Jos between 1995 and 1999 through a road profiling approach. Results show that four gateway routes, seven multi-lane roadways (including two gateway routes) and seven road intersections accounted for 84% of all traffic accidents, 84% of injured casualties and 88% of fatalities. This approach allows for quantification of impacts of controlling for accidents by deliberate profiling of roads for close monitoring and policing. For example, reducing accident counts and fatalities by 50% each on gateway routes will amount to approximately 35 and 40% reduction in accident and fatality counts, respectively. Countermeasures must consider these roadways and intersections as important inputs in their accidents and casualty reduction targets.\n\nJosÃ© MarÃ­a Vargas (1786-1854): Reformer of anatomical studies in Venezuela.\n\nPubMed\n\nReverÃ³n, Rafael Romero\n\n2014-03-01\n\nJosÃ© MarÃ­a Vargas (1786-1854): Venezuelan medical doctor, surgeon, optician, anatomist, chemist, botanist, professor, geologist, mineralogist, and mathematician.

He died on March 1, 2009. As a professor of neurology and neurological surgery he was renowned as an expert on vascular, tumor, and functional neurosurgery. Beyond the Italian Neurosurgical Society, he was the doyen of functional neurosurgery, specializing in motor cortex stimulation for the treatment of focal dystonia, Parkinson's disease, and postictal spasticity and pain. His home was his castle, and his family was fundamental to his life. He shared with his wife, Sandra, his passion for piano playing and for their remarkable library, and together with friends, he and his wife enjoyed dinners with fine food and Barolo wines. Listening to this Grand Seigneur talking about and explaining the music of, above all, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Richard Wagner, one felt he was emotionally just \"music and mind\". You can imagine this from his books on music, chess, and neuroscience. Indeed, he adored playing correspondence chess worldwide. A sportsman too, he loved hiking, mountaineering, skiing, swimming, and fishing. Nature was his source for slowing down, for regenerating, and for collecting his strength for new projects and new challenges. Friends will remember Dr. Pagni as a Grand Seigneur.\n\nQuarter of a century of female sterilization in Jos, Central Nigeria.\n\nPubMed\n\nMutihir, Josiah T; Nyango, D D\n\n2011-03-01\n\nThe study was to assess the types and trend of female sterilization between January 1985 and December 2009 (25 years) in Jos, Central Nigeria. There were 25,313 new acceptors of modern contraceptive methods out of which 4,951 (19.6%) were female sterilizations. Minilaparotomy was the commonest method of female sterilization. Local anaesthesia was the commonest anaesthetic utilized. The women were mostly women of relatively older age, grandmultiparous and with large family size. The women were of mean of 38.4 years, and 60% had more than 5 children at the time of sterilization. Interval sterilization constituted 78.5% of the female sterilizations. The acceptance of female sterilization, however, has declined over the years, as acceptance of the long acting contraceptive implants increases. Female sterilization by minilaparotomy under local anaesthesia was found to be feasible, cost effective and acceptable by majority of clients, and recommended for integration into minor gynaecological procedures in our institutions.\n\nThe first Brazilian neuropsychiatrist, JosÃ© Martins da Cruz Jobim, tuberculous meningitis and mental disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nGomes, Marleide da Mota; Engelhardt, Eliasz; Chimelli, Leila\n\n2013-03-01\n\nThe intersection between infectious diseases, poverty and mental disease was an important subject to the Brazilian Neuropsychiatry in the early 19th century. JosÃ© Martins da Cruz Jobim (1802-1878) was engaged in a hygienist approach based on symptomatological and anatomopathological studies. He wrote \"InsÃ¢nia loquaz\" (Loquacious insanity), 1831, the first written text about mental illness in Brazil, founded on clinical and pathological data, compatible with tuberculous meningitis. Thus, Jobim deserves the title of the first neuropsychiatrist in Brazil. The authors critically studied the clinical history and the autopsy findings of his cases, and the main health policies at the time.\n\nChallenges of the management of mass casualty: lessons learned from the Jos crisis of 2001.\n\nPubMed\n\nOzoilo, Kenneth N; Pam, Ishaya C; Yiltok, Simon J; Ramyil, Alice V; Nwadiaro, Hyacinth C\n\n2013-10-28\n\nJos has witnessed a series of civil crises which have generated mass casualties that the Jos University Teaching Hospital has had to respond to from time to time. We review the challenges that we encountered in the management of the victims of the 2001 crisis. We reviewed the findings of our debriefing sessions following the sectarian crisis of September 2001 and identified the challenges and obstacles experienced during these periods. Communication was a major challenge, both within and outside the hospital. In the field, there was poor field triage and no prehospital care. Transportation and evacuation was hazardous, for both injured patients and medical personnel. This was worsened by the imposition of a curfew on the city and its environs. In the hospital, supplies such as fluids, emergency drugs, sterile dressings and instruments, splints, and other consumables, blood and food were soon exhausted. Record keeping was erratic. Staff began to show signs of physical and mental exhaustion as well as features of anxiety and stress. Tensions rose between different religious groups in the hospital and an attempt was made by rioters to attack the hospital. Patients suffered poor subsequent care following resuscitation and/or surgery and there was neglect of patients on admission prior to the crisis as well as non trauma medical emergencies. Mass casualties from disasters that disrupt organized societal mechanisms for days can pose significant challenges to the best of institutional disaster response plans. In the situation that we experienced, our disaster plan was impractical initially because it failed to factor in such a prolongation of both crisis and response. We recommend that institutional disaster response plans should incorporate provisions for the challenges we have enumerated and factor in peculiarities that would emanate from the need for a prolonged response.\n\nChallenges of the management of mass casualty: lessons learned from the Jos crisis of 2001\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Jos has witnessed a series of civil crises which have generated mass casualties that the Jos University Teaching Hospital has had to respond to from time to time.

Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of all ORL emergencies among children in our region to provide a baseline data for future health planning. Patients and Methods: This is a 1-year retrospective cross-sectional study of patients aged 16 years and below presenting to the Accident and Emergency Department of the Jos University Teaching Hospital, Jos, Nigeria. Results: A total of 203 otolaryngology emergencies were attended of which 129 (63.5%) were pediatric emergencies. Records of 87 patients were retrievable with age range 2 months to 15 years (mean 3.44 years; standard deviation Â± 3.35). There were 55 males and 32 females with a male to female ratio of 1.7:1. The majority of cases were aged under 5 years (64; 73.6%). Acute tonsillitis accounted for 32 (36.7%) cases with 6 (6.9%) having peritonsillar abscesses. Acute pharyngitis accounted for 11 (12.6%) presentations followed closely by foreign bodies (FBs) in the ear with 10 (11.5%) presentations. FB in the throat occurred in 4 (4.6%) patients who had removal under general anesthesia. Three (3.4%) cases of maxillofacial injuries occurred as a result of insurgent terror attacks and 3.4% presented following corrosive substance ingestion.

Here we focus on stratigraphy and geochronology of two Native American-constructed reservoirs. One reservoir located near the community of Casa Blanca was formed by a â¼600 m (2000 feet) long stone masonry dam that impounded â¼1.6 Ã 106 m3 (â¼1300 acre-feet) of stored water. Four optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) ages obtained on reservoir deposits indicate that the dam was constructed prior to AD 1825. The other reservoir is located adjacent to Old Laguna Pueblo and contains only a small remnant of its former earthen dam. The depth and distribution of reservoir deposits and a photogrammetric analyses of relict shorelines indicate a storage capacity of â¼6.5 Ã 106 m3 (â¼5300 ac-ft). OSL ages from above and below the base of the reservoir indicate that the reservoir was constructed sometime after AD 1370 but before AD 1750. The results of our investigation are consistent with Laguna oral history and Spanish accounts demonstrating indigenous construction of significant water-storage reservoirs on the Rio San JosÃ© prior to the late nineteenth century.\n\nSickness absence among depressed patients attending the General Out Patients Department of the Jos University Teaching Hospital, Jos, Nigeria.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoar, G S; Moses, D A; Micheal, T A\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDepression has been associated with low productivity and long absence from work. This has a serious consequence for the individuals, the employer and the society. The objectives of this study were to determine sickness absence from work among depressed patients attending General Out Patients Department (GOPD) in the preceding 12 months, to assess socio-demographic correlates of sickness absence in these patients and lastly, to determine the effect of depression on perception of work performance. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study among 200 consecutive patients attending the General Out Patients Department of the Jos University Teaching Hospital from November 2006 to March 2007. A semi-structured questionnaire designed by the authors was used to collect socio-demographic variables, self-reported perception of work and sickness absence days in the 12 months prior to the study. Depression was assessed using Structured clinical Interview for DSM- IV (SCID) axis 1 disorder. A total of 51(25.4%) of the 200 patients met the DSM IV diagnostic criteria for major depression. The depressed respondents significantly had higher mean and cumulative days of sickness absence compared to the non-depressed (p < 0.0001). Among the depressed patients male gender (p < 0.0001) and younger age (16-45 years) (p = 0.017) but not marital status (p = 0.867) were associated with sickness absence. Older age (P = 0.001) was associated with sickness absence in the non-depressed while gender (p = 0.117), and marital status (p = 0.752) were not. Having a diagnosis of depression was associated with poor work performance compared with the non-depressed (p < 0.0001). Increased efforts are needed to screen and treat for depression to improve productivity and toprevent long spells of sickness absence.\n\nAward for Distinguished Senior Career Contributions to Psychology in the Public Interest: JosÃ© Toro-Alfonso.\n\nPubMed\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe APA Awards for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology in the Public Interest recognize persons who have advanced psychology as a science and/or profession by a single extraordinary achievement or a lifetime of outstanding contributions in the public interest.

The preparation of choice was the node of Ranvier in single myelinated fibers in frog. JosÃ© del Castillo spent 3 years on the United States mainland from 1956 to 1959. During that time, he collaborated with Jerome Y. Lettvin and John W. Moore. I discuss how these individuals met one another and some of their scientific discoveries using the voltage clamp to study squid giant axons and frog nodes. Much of this work was conducted at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, and I attempt to convey a sense of the unique scientific \"melting pot\" that existed at the Marine Biological Laboratory and the broader effect that del Castillo had on \"modern\" neuroscience.\n\nAssessment of the relationship between entomologic indicators of Aedes aegypti and the epidemic occurrence of dengue virus 3 in a susceptible population, SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nChiaravalloti-Neto, Francisco; Pereira, Mariza; FÃ¡varo, Eliane Aparecida; Dibo, Margareth Regina; Mondini, Adriano; Rodrigues-Junior, Antonio Luiz; Chierotti, Ana PatrÃ­cia; Nogueira, MaurÃ­cio Lacerda\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThe aims of this study were to describe the occurrence of dengue in space and time and to assess the relationships between dengue incidence and entomologic indicators. We selected the dengue autochthonous cases that occurred between September 2005 and August 2007 in SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto to calculate incidence rates by month, year and census tracts. The monthly incidence rates of the city were compared to the monthly Breteau indices (BI) of the SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Region. Between December 2006 and February 2007, an entomological survey was conducted to collect immature forms of Aedes aegypti in JaguarÃ©, a SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto neighborhood, and to obtain entomological indices. These indices were represented using statistical interpolation. To represent the occurrence of dengue in the JaguarÃ© neighborhood in 2006 and 2007, we used the Kernel ratio and to evaluate the relationship between dengue and the entomological indices, we used a generalized additive model in a spatial case-control design. Between September 2005 and August 2007, the occurrence of dengue in SÃ£o JosÃ© do Rio Preto was almost entirely caused by DENV3, and the monthly incidence rates presented high correlation coefficients with the monthly BI. In JaguarÃ© neighborhood, the entomological indices calculated by hectare were better predictors of the spatial distribution of dengue than the indices calculated by properties, but the pupae quantification did not show better prediction qualities than the indices based on the container positivity, in relation to the risk of dengue occurrence. The fact that the municipality's population had a high susceptibility to the serotype DENV3 before the development of this research, along with the almost total predominance of the occurrence of this serotype between 2005 and 2007, facilitated the analysis of the epidemiological situation of the disease and allowed us to connect it to the entomological indicators.

Special attention is paid to the process by which the Spanish group, with the support of the new Superior National Research Council, made contact with the German morphology being developed by Hugo Spatz (1888-1979) at the Max Planck-Institut fÃ¼r Hirnforschung. Our study reveals the numerous influences that finally led to the anatomy and embryology of Escolar. In Spain, we found a direct influence of the Gegenbaurian morphology of Gumersindo SÃ¡nchez Guisande (1894-1976) and the neuroanatomy of Juan JosÃ© Barcia Goyanes (1901-2003), full of references to studies by Braus. International contacts of the \"Escolarian group\", first with North America and then with Germany, created a homogeneous group with a single anatomy (functional and ontophylogenetic) but with so many research interests that subspecialisations had to be developed. An important embryological work resulted from an intense relationship with the German anatomical community during the 1950s. Escolar worked in this field on the development of the amygdala and allocortex, Fernando Reinoso studied the embryology of the diencephalon and Smith Victor Agreda, along with the German scientist Rudolf Diepen, made some important discoveries on the development of the hypothalamic-pituitary system.\n\nRespiratory symptoms and pulmonary function impairment among detergent plant workers in Jos, Northern Nigeria.\n\nPubMed\n\nBabashani, M; Iliyasu, Z; Ukoli, C O\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe industrial process of detergent production could be deleterious to lung function. This study describes respiratory symptoms and ventilatory function impairment among detergent workers in Jos, Northern Nigeria. Two hundred detergent plant workers and controls were studied for the presence of respiratory symptoms and ventilatory function impairment using the MRC questionnaire and Spirometry. A significantly higher proportion of exposed detergent workers 178 (87.0%) reported respiratory symptoms compared to 52 (26.0%) controls [OR=23; 95% CI=12.9-41.3] (P<0.001). Commonest symptoms include rhinitis (57.5% versus 11.0%) and cough (48.5% versus 15%). Symptoms were most prevalent in the packaging section. FEV1, FVC and PEFR were significantly reduced among exposed detergent workers. Similarly, the predicted values of PEFR, FVC and FEV1, were significantly reduced among smokers (P<0. 001). Respiratory symptoms are highly prevalent among detergent workers. This was associated with impaired pulmonary function. Protective equipment and periodic lung function tests could reduce these effects.\n\nMineralogy and geochemistry of the Lower Cretaceous siliciclastic rocks of the Morita Formation, Sierra San JosÃ© section, Sonora, Mexico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMadhavaraju, J.; Pacheco-Olivas, S. A.; GonzÃ¡lez-LeÃ³n, Carlos M.; Espinoza-Maldonado, Inocente G.; Sanchez-Medrano, P. A.; Villanueva-Amadoz, U.; Monreal, Rogelio; Pi-Puig, T.; RamÃ­rez-Montoya, Erik; Grijalva-Noriega, Francisco J.\n\n2017-07-01\n\nClay mineralogy and geochemical studies were carried out on sandstone and shale samples collected from the Sierra San JosÃ© section of the Morita Formation to infer the paleoclimate and paleoweathering conditions that prevailed in the source region during the deposition of these sediments. The clay mineral assemblages (fraction < 2 Î¼m) of the Sierra San JosÃ© section are composed of chlorite and illite. The abundance of illite and chlorite in the studied samples suggest that the physical weathering conditions were dominant over chemical weathering. Additionally, the illite and chlorite assemblages reflect arid or semi-arid climatic conditions in the source regions. K2O/Al2O3 ratio of shales vary between 0.15 and 0.26, which lie in the range of values for clay minerals, particularly illite composition. Likewise, sandstones vary between 0.06 and 0.13, suggesting that the clay minerals are mostly kaolinte and illite types. On the chondrite-normalized diagrams, sandstone and shale samples show enriched light rare earth elements (LREE), flat heavy rare earth elements (HREE) patterns and negative Eu anomalies. The CIA and PIA values and A-CN-K plot of shales indicate low to moderate degree of weathering in the source regions. However, the sandstones have moderate to high values of CIA and PIA suggesting a moderate to intense weathering in the source regions. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, bivariate and ternary plots, discriminant function diagram and elemental ratios indicate the felsic source rocks for sandstone and shale of the Morita Formation.\n\nNumerical solving of equations in the work of JosÃ© Mariano Vallejo\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPacheco Castelao, JosÃ©-Miguel; PÃ©rez-Fern; Ã¡ndez, F. Javier; SuÃ¡rez AlemÃ¡n, Carlos-Oswaldo\n\n2007-09-01\n\nThe progress of Mathematics during the nineteenth century was characterised both by an enormous acquisition of new knowledge and by the attempts to introduce rigour in reasoning patterns and mathematical writing. Cauchy's presentation of Mathematical Analysis was not immediately accepted, and many writers, though aware of that new style, did not use it in their own mathematical production. This paper is devoted to an episode of this sort that took place in Spain during the first half of the century: It deals with the presentation of a method for numerically solving algebraic equations by JosÃ© Mariano Vallejo, a late Spanish follower of the Enlightenment ideas, politician, writer, and mathematician who published it in the fourth (1840) edition of his book Compendio de MathemÃ¡ticas Puras y Mistas, claiming to have discovered it on his own. Vallejo's main achievement was to write down the whole procedure in a very careful way taking into account the different types of roots, although he paid little attention to questions such as convergence checks and the fulfilment of the hypotheses of Rolle's Theorem. For sure this lack of mathematical care prevented Vallejo to occupy a place among the forerunners of Computational Algebra.\n\nEl Alcalde JosÃ© Carlos Aponte Dalmau del Municipio de Carolina es nombrado a formar parte del ComitÃ© Asesor de Gobiernos Locales de la EPA a nivel de todos los Estados Unidos\n\nEPA Pesticide Factsheets\n\nComunicado de prensa de la EPA: El Alcalde JosÃ© Carlos Aponte Dalmau del Municipio de Carolina es nombrado a formar parte del ComitÃ© Asesor de Gobiernos Locales de la EPA a nivel de todos los Estados Unidos\n\nMineralogy and thermal properties of kaolin from the San JosÃ© (Oruro, Bolivia)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAlfonso, Pura; Garcia-Valles, Maite; MartÃ­nez, Salvador; Amando Penedo, Lucio; Elvys Trujillo, Juan\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe San JosÃ© mine, Oruro, Bolivia is known for provided a broad diversity of minerals. The San JosÃ© Sn deposit is a Sn-Ag deposit composed of veins hosted in a complex of Miocene domes from monzonitic to dioritic composition within rhyolitic volcanic rocks hosted in Tertiary sedimentary rocks. Advanced argillitic alteration. is widespread in the surroundings of the deposit. Kaolinitization reach industrial importance and the kaolinitized rock is exploited, however it was not already been characterised. In this study we present a preliminary mineralogical and thermal characterization to determine the industrial applications of these kaolinitic materials. A sampling of the kaolinitized rocks in outcrops from the mining area was undertaken. The chemical composition of major and trace elements was determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Mineralogy was obtained by powder diffraction X-ray (XRD) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Quantitative determination of phases was obtained by the Rietveld refinement method using the Fullprof software. Thermal properties were determined by differential thermal analysis-thermo gravimetry (DTA -TG) and dilatometry. Mineral phases determined are mainly quartz (54-55 wt. %), kaolinite (7-8 wt. %), K-feldspar (8-19 wt. %), muscovite (16-17 wt. %), plagioclase up to 3 wt. %, alunite up to 8 wt% and gypsum up to 4 wt%. DTA -TG show a first endothermic event related to the dehydration of gypsum, with a loss weight of 0.4 wt%. An endothermic peak corresponding to the loss of the OH- groups of kaolinite occurs about 520 Â°C and an exothermic, at 980 Â°C, due to the crystallization of the mullite phase. The endothermic peak is attributed to the transformation of kaolinite in metakaolinite: Al2Si2O5 (OH)4 ï Al2Si2O7 + 2H2O and the dehydroxilation of alunite; the loss weight associated with this event is 2.9-3.2 wt%. The exothermic peak is caused by the formation of mullite: 3Al2Si2O7 ï Al6Si2O13 + 4SiO2. Another loss weight, of 3wt%, is\n\nThe use of town refuse ash in urban agriculture around Jos, Nigeria: health and environmental risks.\n\nPubMed\n\nPasquini, M W\n\n2006-01-15\n\nThis paper reports on a study that examines the health and environmental risks of using town refuse ash in urban vegetable production in Jos, Nigeria, in terms of heavy metal accumulation in the food chain. Soil and crop samples, collected from five study farms, and samples of the river water used for irrigation, were analysed for seven heavy metals Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cd and Pb. On the basis of the field data the paper discusses: (1) the potential soil deficiencies and toxicities; (2) the probable links between soil heavy metal levels and fertilisation practices; (3) the heavy metal concentrations in crop tissue in relation to crop growth and human health. The findings suggest that soil concentrations of the seven metals fall within 'typical' soil levels, and that there should not be any problems of either toxicities or deficiencies for crop growth. There was evidence of slight accumulation of Zn, Cu and Cd on some of the farms with a history of town refuse ash use. However, in all farms lettuce crops contained very large concentrations of Fe, and Pb concentrations that were 20 to 40 times higher than the WHO/FAO maximum recommended level in leafy vegetables for human consumption. The Cd content of carrot tissue was 10 times higher than the WHO/FAO recommended limit. The relatively small number of soil and crop samples precluded any formal attempt at correlating the concentrations of heavy metals found in the vegetable crops with the farm levels. Nevertheless, the data suggested that these were not linked. The paper goes on to consider various potential sources of the metals found in the crops, including irrigation water, town refuse ash and air-borne dust, and discusses additional health and environmental risks pertaining to the use of town refuse ash. Undoubtedly, the heavy Pb and Cd contamination of certain crops indicates the urgent need for future studies to ascertain the precise source of these metals, and although the practice of using town refuse ash does\n\nMolecular characterization of environmental Cryptococcus neoformans VNII isolates in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria.\n\nPubMed\n\nNnadi, N E; Enweani, I B; Cogliati, M; Ayanbimpe, G M; Okolo, M O; Kim, E; Sabitu, M Z; Criseo, G; Romeo, O; Scordino, F\n\n2016-12-01\n\nCryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are encapsulated yeasts able to cause fatal neurological infections in both human and other mammals. Cryptococcosis is the most common fungal infection of the central nervous system and has a huge burden in sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia. Bird excreta are considered an environmental reservoir for C.Â neoformans in urban areas, therefore a study aimed at isolating and characterizing this yeast is important in disease management. In this study, one hundred samples of pigeon droppings were collected in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria. C.Â neoformans was isolated from three samples and initially identified using standard phenotypic and biochemical tests. Molecular analysis revealed that all three isolates belonged to C.Â neoformans genotype VNII, mating type Î± and were assigned to the sequence type ST43 by multilocus sequence typing analysis. This study reports, for the first time, the molecular characterization of C.Â neoformans in Nigeria, where little is still known about the environmental distribution of the genotypes, serotypes and mating types of this important human pathogen.

The current increasing incidence of tuberculosis in humans, particularly in immune-compromised persons, has given interest in the zoonotic importance of Mycobacterium bovis in developing countries like Nigeria. This study determined the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis as a background information for effective control measures in Plateau State in cattle population. We reviewed surveillance records on cattle slaughtered and suggestive tuberculosis lesions from cattle slaughtered annually from 2007-2012 in Jos abattoir, Plateau State. Bovine tuberculosis cases at post mortem were based on examination of characteristics TB lesion on organs by Veterinary officers. We performed descriptive analysis using Epi info version 3.5.3 and Microsoft Excel 2007. A total of 52, 262 cattle were slaughtered from 2007-2012, out of which 4, 658 (11.2%) had evidence of tuberculosis lesion at post mortem. The average yearly prevalence was 9.1% but varied from a high of 16.3% in 2007 to a low of 3.1% in 2012. Trend analysis showed that bovine tuberculosis had a seasonal variation and peaked mostly in July and August. The number of suggestive Tb lesion cases was highest in the month of August and lowest in the month of January, 2007-2012. This study shows that bovine tuberculosis is endemic in Plateau State. Trend analysis showed that bovine tuberculosis is seasonal and peaked mostly in July and August. Continuous surveillance through meat inspection is required to prevent zoonotic transmission of bovine tuberculosis.\n\nGeology of the epithermal Ag-Au Huevos Verdes vein system and San JosÃ© district, Deseado massif, Patagonia, Argentina\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDietrich, Andreas; Gutierrez, Ronald; Nelson, Eric P.; Layer, Paul W.\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThe San JosÃ© district is located in the northwest part of the Deseado massif and hosts a number of epithermal Ag-Au quartz veins of intermediate sulfidation style, including the Huevos Verdes vein system. Veins are hosted by andesitic rocks of the Bajo Pobre Formation and locally by rhyodacitic pyroclastic rocks of the Chon Aike Formation. New 40Ar/39Ar constraints on the age of host rocks and mineralization define Late Jurassic ages of 151.3 Â± 0.7 Ma to 144.7 Â± 0.1 Ma for volcanic rocks of the Bajo Pobre Formation and of 147.6 Â± 1.1 Ma for the Chon Aike Formation. Illite ages of the Huevos Verdes vein system of 140.8 Â± 0.2 and 140.5 Â± 0.3 Ma are 4 m.y. younger than the volcanic host rock unit. These age dates are among the youngest reported for Jurassic volcanism in the Deseado massif and correlate well with the regional context of magmatic and hydrothermal activity. The Huevos Verdes vein system has a strike length of 2,000 m, with several ore shoots along strike. The vein consists of a pre-ore stage and three main ore stages. Early barren quartz and chalcedony are followed by a mottled quartz stage of coarse saccharoidal quartz with irregular streaks and discontinuous bands of sulfide-rich material. The banded quartz-sulfide stage consists of sulfide-rich bands alternating with bands of quartz and bands of chlorite Â± illite. Late-stage sulfide-rich veinlets are associated with kaolinite gangue. Ore minerals are argentite and electrum, together with pyrite, sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, minor bornite, covellite, and ruby silver. Wall rock alteration is characterized by narrow (< 3 m) halos of illite and illite/smectite next to veins, grading outward into propylitic alteration. Gangue minerals are dominantly massive quartz intergrown with minor to accessory adularia. Epidote, illite, illite/smectite, and, preferentially at deeper levels, Fe-chlorite gangue indicate near-neutral pH hydrothermal fluids at temperatures of >220Â°C.

Where there are no social cost cushions, the burden is borne by patients. With pervasive poverty and inadequate control, complications are unchecked. Back titration in appropriate circumstances should, therefore, translate to economic benefit. This is an attempt to compute, in economic terms, the benefit of back titration. Thirty-nine patients who entered an antihypertensive back titration program for 12 months and who had been earlier reported on, form the subject of this study. A survey of the cost of antihypertensives in pharmacy outlets in Jos, Nigeria was undertaken. Regimens of antihypertensives that patients were on at the onset and end of the 12 months of back titration were costed in Nigerian currency and compared. Back titration translated to economic benefit in all patients with a cost reduction varying from 2.3% to 100%. This reflected in reduction in mean daily cost of treatment of N107.09-N54.61. The benefit of antihypertensive back titration apart from psychological relief of lower pill burden and side effect profile is in pharmacoeconomics. This permits greater adherence and prevents morbi-mortality consequences of hypertension. In this study, back titration over 12 months translated to average cost reduction of >50%, making treatment more affordable. In appropriate circumstances, back titration of antihypertensives results in economic relief for patients. This should improve adherence, reduce morbi-mortality and is recommended for wider application.\n\nPrevalence and correlates of posttraumatic stress disorder among medical students in the University of Jos, Nigeria.\n\nPubMed\n\nNwoga, C N; Audu, M D; Obembe, A\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the most common consequence of traumatic experiences. The North Central Nigeria to which Plateau State belongs has witnessed many ethno-religious crises. While previous studies suggested a high prevalence of PTSD among students, to the best of our knowledge, no such study has been reported in Nigeria. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and correlates of PTSD among medical students in a university. Cross-sectional systematic random sampling was used to select 200 medical students. A two staged interview with questionnaire on sociodemographic variables, PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version, Impact of Event Scale, and Composite International Diagnostic Interview was carried out. SPSS Inc. Released 2007. SPSS for Windows, version 16.0. Chicago, SPSS Inc. was used for statistical analysis. Prevalence of PTSD among the students was 23.5%. Previous childhood trauma and personal experiences during the crisis were significantly associated with having PTSD. High prevalence rate of PTSD among medical students in Jos is an indicator of psychological consequences of the recurring crises on the inhabitants. There is a need for follow-up and counseling/trauma healing for those identified.\n\nCuban Epidemic optic neuropathy (1991-1993) And josÃ© saramago's novel blindness (1995).\n\nPubMed\n\nFeibel, Robert M; Arch, Jennifer\n\n2018-06-12\n\nThis article reviews the history of Cuban Epidemic Optic Neuropathy (1991-1993), which caused visual loss, peripheral neuralgias, and other neurological symptoms in over 50,000 persons, an incidence of almost 0.5% of the entire population. The clinical findings, etiology, and treatment are described. We then relate the Cuban epidemic to the fictional epidemic of contagious blindness depicted by Nobel Laureate JosÃ© Saramago in his 1995 novel Blindness. This novel describes an unnamed modern city in which all inhabitants, except the ophthalmologist's wife, are affected with a white, not black, blindness. Historical review and literary essay. The sources for the Cuban epidemic were an extensive review of the published literature and personal communications with physicians who treated these patients. Both authors have analyzed the novel and the critical literature about Saramago's writings. Though Saramago uses the epidemic of blindness as an allegory to comment on human weakness and immorality, he may also have known of the actual Cuban epidemic. Saramago was a lifelong member of the Communist party, as well as a friend of Fidel Castro and admirer of the Cuban government. We have no proof that Blindness was influenced by the Cuban epidemic, but we find it plausible. It is valuable to examine the real and fictional epidemics side by side, not least because Saramago's novel depicts the actions of an ophthalmologist during an epidemic of blindness. Ophthalmologists may be interested in a novel that uses the language of eyes, vision, sight, and blindness extensively. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

As the Viceroy's personal doctor, he travelled to the territory of New Granada in what is now Colombia. Mutis was the creator and first leader of the Royal Botanic Expedition of New Granada to study South American wildlife, discovering thousands of new species. He also launched several Public Health measures in the Santa Fe area, helping to introduce a vaccination campaign. Mutis was the first person to introduce Newtonian physics in the Spanish America and he established the first Observatory in the New World which is still in use. He was deeply admired and recognized as a prominent scientist by great personalities of his time including Carl von LinÃ©e and Alexander von Humboldt.

The TGRD rates in all the measurements ranged from 40 to 1265 nGy h-1 with a mean value of 250 nGy h-1. The maximum TGDR was recorded on geological type G8 (Younger Granites) at Bisitchi, and the lowest TGDR was recorded on G6 (Basaltic rocks) at Gabia. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test was used to compared the data. Significantly, the results of this study inferred a strong relationship between TGRD levels with geological structures of a place. An isodose map was plotted to represent exposure rates due to TGRD. The results of this investigation could be useful for multiple public interest such as evaluating public dose for the area.\n\nTranslations on Environmental Quality, Number 182\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1978-10-17\n\nGHANA Coral Mining at Sea To Supply Nickel Processing Industry (Ramon Alberto Bendoyro; JUVENTUD REBELDE, 5 Sep 78) 12 SUB-SAHAEAN AFRICA...SUPPLY NICKEL PROCESSING INDUSTRY Havana JUVENTUD REBSLDE in Spanish 5 Sep 78 p 2 [Article by Ramon Alberto Bendoyro] [Text] Coral is used in the\n\nBarriers to and Facilitators of Adherence to Exclusive Breastfeeding Practices Among HIV Infected and Non-Infected Women in Jos, Nigeria.\n\nPubMed\n\nCoetzee, BronwynÃ¨; Tomlinson, Mark; Osawe, Sophia; Abimiku, Alash'le; Kagee, Ashraf\n\n2017-04-01\n\nObjectives In Nigeria adherence to exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) practices is currently suboptimal and a better understanding of the factors affecting adherence to EBF is needed. We sought to identify and delineate the barriers to and facilitators of adherence to EBF amongst HIV-infected and uninfected women in Nigeria. Methods We explored the barriers and facilitators to EBF amongst 37 (25 HIV-infected and 12 HIV-uninfected) pregnant women attending an antenatal clinic in Jos, Nigeria. In-depth interviews were conducted with each of the pregnant women in their third trimester of pregnancy and again 1 month after giving birth. Results The themes that emerged were mothers' feeding intentions, significant role players in the decision to breastfeed, perceived barriers (e.g. physiological issues, stigma, employment) and perceived facilitators (e.g. pleasure and enjoyment derived from breastfeeding, natural milk from God, disclosure and family support) associated with EBF. Conclusions Most women preferred EBF and offered it to their infants. However, more efforts are needed to improve support structures at home and at work to accommodate women who choose to do EBF.\n\n\"I Don't Find Any Privacy around Here\": Ethnographic Encounters with Local Practices of Literacy in the State Prison of Oaxaca\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nClemente, Angeles; Higgins, Michael James; Sughrua, William Michael\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn his poem entitled \"Privacy\", Alberto, an inmate in the state prison of Oaxaca, Mexico, vividly evokes the conflictive dynamics of space and time within his living quarters.
