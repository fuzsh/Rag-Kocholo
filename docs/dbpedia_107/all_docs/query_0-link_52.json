        "text": "Citation preview\n\nCH R IST IAN ITY AND ET HN IC IT Y IN CAN A D A Edited by Paul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nOver the past decade, scholars and policy makers interested in Canadian multiculturalism have begun to take religion much more seriously, and Christian communities have become increasingly aware of the impact of ethnic diversity on church life. Until very recently, however, almost no systematic academic attention has been paid to the intersection between the ethnic and religious identities of individuals or communities. This gap in both our academic literature and our public discourse is an obstacle to understanding and integrating the large numbers of ‘ethnic Christians,’ most of whom either join existing Canadian churches or create ethnically specific congregations. In Christianity and Ethnicity in Canada, eleven scholars explore the complex relationships between religious and ethnic identity within nine major Christian traditions in Canada. The contributors discuss the ways in which changes in the ethnic composition of these traditions influence religious practice and identity, as well as how the nine religious traditions influence communal and individual ethnic identities. An introductory chapter by Paul Bramadat and David Seljak provides a thorough discussion of the theoretical, historical, and empirical issues involved in the study of Christianity and ethnicity in Canada. This volume complements Religion and Ethnicity in Canada, in which the authors address similar issues within six major non-Christian communities in Canada, and within Canadian health care, education, and politics. paul bramadat is director of the Centre for Studies in Religion and Society and associate professor of History at the University of Victoria. david seljak is associate professor of Religious Studies at St Jerome’s University and Chair of the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Waterloo.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada\n\nEdited by Paul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nUNIVERSITY OF TORONTO PRESS Toronto Buffalo London\n\n© University of Toronto Press Incorporated 2008 Toronto Buffalo London www.utppublishing.com Printed in Canada ISBN 978-0-8020-9875-7 (cloth) ISBN 978-0-8020-9584-8 (paper)\n\nPrinted on acid-free paper\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada Cataloguing in Publication Christianity and ethnicity in Canada / edited by Paul Bramadat and David Seljak.

After all, most conversations about religion in the public arena tend to revolve around anxieties either about the putative security threat posed by a particular religion, or about the supposedly pervasive process of secularization affecting Canadian society and religion. In both of these discursive themes – security and secularization – ethnicity and religion are two of the most crucial forces at work (alongside political and socio-economic issues, of course). Increasingly, scholars are discovering that it is futile to study religion in isolation. Instead, they study religious identity, belief, practice, forms of community, and institutions as they intersect with other markers of identity and solidarity such as gender, class, race, sexual orientation, and of course ethnicity. For scholars and students of religion, ethnicity is emerging as one of the most important dimensions of modern religious phenomena – its influence on the broader scene of religion in Canada clearly rivals that of the traditional components of religion: ritual, cosmology, ecclesiology, heresiology, worldview, theology, doctrine, etc. For example, one cannot hope to understand the causes or the aftermath of the events of September 11, 2001 – not to mention the public debates currently raging in Quebec and throughout Europe about religious diversity and multiculturalism – without understanding the ways ethnic, political, and religious forces intersect in the modern era. This book is the second instalment of a larger project on religion and ethnicity in Canada that we conceived in 2001. The project as a whole operates under the auspices of the Centre for Studies in Religion and Society at the University of Victoria. Both Religion and Ethnicity in Can-\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nada and Christianity and Ethnicity in Canada employ the innovative approach to collaborative interdisciplinary research that characterizes many of the projects housed at the CSRS. This model for producing advanced interdisciplinary research useful to academic specialists, students, and policy makers involves, among other things, face-to-face meetings of all authors, rigorous group editing, as well as the involvement of policy makers (from federal departments interested in the issues being addressed) and community members (from religious and activist communities associated with the topics and issues addressed). In Religion and Ethnicity in Canada, we explored the dialectical relationship between religious and ethnic modes of identity in Canada’s six ‘major minority’ traditions (Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism, Islam, and Chinese religion); we also examined the three public policy issues (health care, education, and federal policy making) around which revolve the most significant debates about religion and Canadian society. We felt then that the book would serve as an important resource for Canadians wishing to understand the current state of religion in a globalized world. When we began discussing the contents of our earlier book we realized immediately that it would be nearly impossible to address three public policy arenas, the six main minority traditions and Christianity in the same book. After all, the Christian communities in Canada are very large (comprising roughly 90 per cent of the country’s population until the twentieth century); are spread out over the entire country; include members of almost all ethnic, linguistic, and national sub-communities; and have evolved over more than three hundred years of history. Consequently, we decided to devote an entire book to the interplay between Christianity and ethnicity in Canada. To be more precise (and verbally awkward) we might perhaps have used ‘Christianities’ and ‘ethnicities’ instead of the singular versions of these terms, since we discuss in this book a number of both phenomena that are often profoundly dissimilar. When convenient, we have tried to problematize these terms in order to convey the rich diversity within the categories of, for example, ‘Roman Catholic’ and ‘Italian,’ categorical labels that would lead a scholar to inquire into which kind of Roman Catholicism (liberal, liberationist, conservative, ultra-montanist), and which kind of Italian (which regional affiliation, which social class, which dialect, which gender, which generation) we have in mind when we use such terms. Each of the authors we have selected discusses in depth the ways in which ethnicity and Christianity sometimes work together and some-\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\ntimes are at odds in the overall project of determining and communicating individual and group identities. Each author is a renowned scholar in his or her field and each brings his or her own disciplinary background (as historian, theologian, or sociologist, for example) to bear on the tradition he or she has been asked to discuss. Although each chapter reflects the perspective and academic background of the author, each author was also asked to address a general template of topics so that a number of common themes are found in all chapters. As such, this book is a hybrid academic product: it is a collection of important and original research by a variety of authors in a number of specialized areas, such as one might expect from an edited volume of articles, but it is meant to avoid the sometimes arbitrary and uneven nature of such collections. Our goal was to produce a collection of scholarly articles that would come as close to a monograph as possible. As with any edited book, decisions about which topics and traditions to exclude were extremely difficult. All decisions of this nature reflect our editorial evaluation of the overall relevance of a particular ethnic or religious community to the general phenomenon of Christianity in Canada. In order to avoid imposing too great a burden on the reader, not to mention the publisher, we had to make difficult decisions about the content of this book. Since we were not able to justify devoting a full chapter to interesting groups such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (the Mormons), the Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Salvation Army, the Amish, and many ‘Eastern’ Christian communities, they are addressed very briefly within other chapters as branches of the main root of a particular tradition. We hope that their omission in the present volume will inspire scholars to pursue those topics. Readers will note that while many writers discuss the churches’ historically fraught relations with Aboriginal peoples, there is no separate chapter on the often highly creative blending of Aboriginal and Christian modes of spirituality that one can witness within contemporary Christian communities. On this issue, we decided to heed the advice we received from leading proponents of the academic study of Aboriginal Christianity and have opted to include such a chapter in a future book devoted exclusively to Aboriginal spirituality in Canada. We have no doubt that some readers will disagree with our decisions about which communities to exclude; however, we recognize that this disagreement is an inevitable consequence of such a project. In our first chapter, we discuss more fully the range of issues surrounding the communities we have selected and the nominal categories (seven\n\nxiv Preface\n\n‘denominations’ and two ‘traditions’) we have used throughout the book. We would like to thank Conrad Brunk, the outgoing director of the Centre for Studies in Religion and Society, for his tireless support throughout the development of Christianity and Ethnicity in Canada, as well as Harold Coward, the founding director of the Centre and the overall ‘shepherd’ and ‘grandfather’ of the broader project. We are deeply indebted to Leslie Kenny and Susan Karim, the superbly competent administrators at the Centre, who have helped to keep the project as a whole and this book in particular on track. John Biles, director of Partnership and Knowledge Transfer at the Metropolis Project (Citizenship and Immigration Canada), has provided encouraging and insightful advice on the connection between the communities we have addressed and the actual practice of policy making at the federal level. Not only has John offered us his incisive critiques of all of our chapters, but he has found ways to provide crucial financial support throughout the project. We would also like to thank the authors of the chapters of this volume for their enthusiastic and valuable participation in this unusual endeavour, as well as their patience with our sometimes exacting editorial work. Throughout this and the previous volume, we have appreciated the support of both the University of Winnipeg (for Paul Bramadat) and St Jerome’s University (for David Seljak). We would also like to extend our gratitude to Peter Beyer of the University of Ottawa for providing the statistical tables found in the appendix. At the University of Toronto Press, assistant managing editor Richard Ratzlaff and Social Science editor Stephen Kotowych were most helpful in moving our book fairly rapidly through the review and production phases. Ian MacKenzie, the copy editor at Paragraphics, was exceptionally discerning and judicious in his examination of our writing. Retired Professor of English at St. Jerome’s University, Dr Douglas Letson also gave a close and careful reading of the galley proofs. Co-editing a book takes an enormous amount of time and energy, and so we would like to thank our families for their tireless support throughout the process.\n\nCH R IST IAN ITY AND ET HN IC IT Y IN CAN A D A\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 Charting the New Terrain: Christianity and Ethnicity in Canada paul bramadat and david seljak\n\nIntroduction Surprisingly little has been written on the role of ethnicity in shaping Canada’s Christian churches, although our own experience tells us that it is significant. For example, one author of this chapter, David Seljak, grew up in a Slovenian Canadian family. The hub of the Toronto Slovenian community was Marija Pomagaj (Mary, Help of Christians) Roman Catholic Church.1 There Slovenian Canadians went to Mass, got married, had their children baptized, and paid their last respects to deceased friends and family members. After Mass, they frequently met in the church basement to meet members of their extended family, chat, discuss politics, or play chess or tarok (a card game wildly popular in Slovenia and central Europe). On special occasions, they would eat traditional Slovenian stews, sausages, roast meats, and fried potatoes prepared by members of the parish’s Catholic Women’s League. Before Christmas and Easter, traditional cookies would be on sale as well as the much-loved potica, a traditional walnut roll cake. But Sunday was not the only day that the church was busy. Parishioners came to study the Slovenian language, literature, and culture at the Saturday morning šola (school), participate in Slovenian sports clubs and Scouts, attend concerts and cultural events, as well as save and borrow money at the two credit unions that operated out of church offices. The back of the church bulletin featured advertisements for realtors, travel agents, plumbers, insurance brokers, and grocers, highlighting the church’s role as the centre of business connections among Slovenians. No major event in the community failed to feature the parish priest as honoured guest. Feast days (especially Christmas), national holidays, as well as\n\n4 Paul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nbaptisms, weddings, and funerals all brought the community to Marija Pomagaj. Lest this portrait seem too nostalgic, we should acknowledge that the conservative Catholicism of the Marija Pomagaj Parish also bolstered a paternalistic social hierarchy, conservative gender roles, restrictive sexual ethics, and a latent authoritarianism in the community. These too were part of the community ethos. Nevertheless, this portrait of the Roman Catholic Church’s centrality in this particular ethnic community, and – equally important – the ethnic community’s centrality in the life of the church, will be quite common, not only to Canadian Roman Catholics, but to many other Christians. What is puzzling is the fact that this common and intimate relationship between Canadian Christianity and Canada’s various ethnic communities has not yet received comprehensive treatment by scholars of Canadian religion or ethnicity. While scholars have conducted many smallscale studies of specific ethnic Christian communities, no one has yet examined the phenomenon in a broader Canadian perspective. Moreover, far too few studies have been conducted on the newer Christian immigrant communities, such as African Presbyterians, Haitian Roman Catholics, Chinese Anglicans, and Asian Mennonites. While most of us understand that the majority of Canadians from Latin America and Europe identify themselves as Christians, it often surprises people to learn how many of the ‘visible minorities’ they might see in their cities – including many of the Chinese, some of the South Asian, many of the Arab, most of the West Indian, and most of the African Canadians – are also Christians. It is certain that the overall ethnic diversity of the Canadian population is increasing; it is also the case that the minority religious traditions – especially Islam, Sikhism, Hinduism, Chinese religion, and Buddhism – are growing very rapidly. The spectacular growth rate of these smaller religious traditions – most of which have doubled or nearly doubled in the past ten years – has garnered a great many headlines in recent years.2 However, the increases in religious and ethnic diversity associated with this relatively new phenomenon have tended to distract observers from the related changes happening within the much larger and still numerically dominant Canadian Christian community. The dramatic changes within the ethnic composition of many Canadian denominations will likely be apparent already to many older urban Christians who have watched their congregations change over the last few decades, but for younger Christians, their communities have always been ethnically diverse.\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada 5\n\nOf course, the reason that so many visibly different ‘ethnic’ Canadians arrive in Canada as Christians is that they have come from countries that were more or less thoroughly Christianized in the past by generations of European – and, more recently, North American – missionaries. To meet a first- or second-generation Canadian of African descent who is in fact a third-, fourth-, or twenty-fifth-generation Christian, reminds us of the global reach of Christianity. It also draws our attention to the recent consequences of globalization that have made Canada such a thoroughly multicultural and perhaps even post-colonial state. Contemporary Christianity in a Post-Colonial Canada We can say that we live in a post-colonial world in the sense that in the periods following both world wars of the twentieth century, states such as Great Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Holland withdrew from countries that had been under their administrative, economic, military, and political control. One might say that from the beginning of the colonial period (roughly from the end of the fifteenth century) until the decades following the Second World War, many Europeans considered their determinative presence in colonized countries to be morally unproblematic. While controlling another country or region was acknowledged to be a complex and challenging logistical and political undertaking, the moral right of economically, militarily, and technologically superior countries to involve themselves directly in the rule of other countries was widely recognized as a problem only in the last fifty or sixty years.3 To put it another way, our parents and grandparents grew up in a period during which formally diminished levels of independence were largely unquestioned matters of fact for the majority of the world’s regions, countries, and individuals. The sun has now set on the European imperial period, at least in the classical sense in which a particular country seeks to exert direct and permanent control over another. However compelling might be the evidence for a Leviathan-like American unilateralist imperial entity (especially in the wake of the Cold War and 11 September 2001), it is clear that the nature of empire has changed in our so-called post-colonial period. It is true that the American military and economic interest in many countries very often problematizes the development of indigenous democratic institutions. However, it would probably be incorrect to characterize this as a simple return to empire, along the lines of the\n\n6 Paul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nkind of empire enjoyed by Britain in the nineteenth century.4 The Cold War certainly did lead to the political reorganization of most of the world after the end of the Second World War, but it lasted fewer than fifty years, and was much less entrenched than the colonial system and the deeper Weltanschauung with which it was associated. Important for this book’s authors is the fact that, during and before the Cold War, we witnessed the de jure independence of many former colonies and the growing effort in many Western democracies such as Canada to come to terms with the shadow side of the much older world-organizing force of colonialism. The Churches and Colonialism in Canada To understand the role and status of Christianity in Canada it is important to explore the place of Christianity in our home-grown and imported forms of colonialism. After all, the Christian churches have played an integral role in the colonization of this land and its evolution into a complex society. Until very recently, the European colonization of Canada has always occurred under the sign of the cross; that is, the Europeans who first created Canada imagined it always as a Christian project.5 This assumption has both benevolent and malevolent implications. Regarding the benevolent implications, it must be said that in the social and personal lives of common settlers, farmers, entrepreneurs, and soldiers of this new country, the tradition and institutions of Christianity provided a relatively stable sense of meaning and purpose in a world that must have been experienced as sometimes threatening, alienating, and unpredictable. It is difficult for us in contemporary Canada to appreciate the existential challenges associated with the transition many people made from Europe to North America. To journey across an ocean to a new continent that existed well beyond the known world of most Europeans, and then to find oneself in the middle of an enormous, ‘uncivilized’ land characterized in places by astonishingly cold weather, new illnesses, mosquitoes, and other natural challenges, must have been harrowing for many people. Moreover, in frontier societies, as well as in the disarray of early industrial towns and cities, there were no social institutions that could match the churches for providing basic social and community services. The churches’ facilitation of these services probably explains the central role they played in addressing the psychological, social, and spiritual needs of immigrants. In these early centuries of settlement, the churches played a crucial role in form-\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada 7\n\ning and cultivating communities and in providing individuals with a sense of their role in the grand narrative of European Christian civilization and its expansion to the new world. As for the less benevolent features of the arrival of Christianity in the New World, we are reminded again and again that many of the settlers, clergy, soldiers, and political leaders who were so attracted to this continent believed that to conquer this land was to bring it under the control of a Christian monarch. To ‘civilize’ its inhabitants, they presupposed, was to Christianize them. For modern readers, it may be difficult to imagine how naturally and organically these two ideas were enmeshed in the imaginations of Canada’s first explorers, conquerors, and settlers. Moreover, it is also difficult to understand how interwoven church and state were. Both in New France and the early years of British North America, the same well-to-do families often provided leaders both in religion and politics; bishops, abbots, and other members of the higher clergy enjoyed the same privileges, lifestyle, wealth, and mindset as members of the political and economic elite. It was assumed that the state would defend the interest of the church (including suppressing its competitors) and that the church would teach people to submit to the lawful authority of their political and social masters. Not only did the first Europeans in Canada – the French – wish to build a Christian society, they dreamed of recreating the religious conditions of the European metropole (in this case, Paris) in their colony. Political allegiance to a single monarch, they believed, had to be cemented by adherence to a single faith and membership in one church.6 In France, the Roman Catholic Church, the aristocratic system, and French culture operated as one integrated system. Consequently, when the French established permanent colonies in New France, they imagined and built them as explicitly Christian communities in which the Roman Catholic Church would exercise a religious monopoly. In fact, after 1627, only French-born Roman Catholics were allowed to immigrate to the colony.7 New France was organized administratively in parishes and the curé or pastor served as the civil administrator alongside a military administrator who handled security and policing. The church monopolized education, ran the hospitals, and provided poor relief. The higher clergy advised the governor. However, the image of New France as a theocracy is greatly exaggerated. What failed here was the project to create what sociologist Max Weber called a ‘church,’ that is, a religious community that was coextensive with the whole society, completely at home with the culture of\n\n8 Paul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nthe people, reflective of the hierarchy of the broader society, led by a professional, educated clergy, and composed of a population that was born into it rather than converted to it. A number of factors worked against this project. The colonial population was too dispersed, too independent, and too poorly educated to be controlled by conventional means. Moreover, the church lacked resources. For example, by 1760, there was only one priest for every five parishes.8 Finally, the goals of the economic and political elites often conflicted with those of the church. Consequently, the project of re-establishing the Roman Catholic Church as the foundation of the colonial society was never completed. In any case, the project of recreating French society on Canadian soil came to an abrupt end in 1763 when the Treaty of Paris transferred the colony to the British four years after the military defeat of the French on the Plains of Abraham outside of Quebec City. It was now the turn of British Protestants to attempt to transplant their version of Christendom in Canadian soil. Before 1750, there were only very limited and short-lived experiments in bringing British rule and Protestantism to Canada. Now that the province of Quebec was part of the British Empire, the British government and the Church of England, specifically the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, could dream of recreating British Protestant Christianity in Canada. At first, the Roman Catholic Church was suppressed and the Church of England favoured – a strategy that persisted despite later concessions to the large French population.9 For example, the Constitution Act of 1791 divided British North America into Lower Canada (the region around the St Lawrence) and Upper Canada (the recently settled lands in what is now Ontario). The act also set aside one seventh of all public land in the two provinces as ‘clergy reserves,’ that is, property of the Church of England to be used to pay for the maintenance of a ‘Protestant clergy,’ as well as for the construction of churches and parsonages. Despite this official government support, the Church of England was to run into the same challenges the French Catholic Church encountered (a dispersed population, lack of resources, and competing interests) as well as much greater religious competition. First, the French inhabitants of the colony, who formed a sizeable majority, remained faithful to their language and religion. The British governors wisely saw that forcing these Roman Catholics to convert to Protestantism would promote rebellion and alliance with the unruly thirteen colonies in the present-day United States, and so gave their Roman Catholic\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada 9\n\nsubjects increasing autonomy and protection. Moreover, among the British and non-francophone settlers, religious pluralism, at least within the Christian community, obstructed the formal establishment of any one church. The Church of Scotland, for example, lobbied for recognition as a co-established church. Moreover, as several of the authors in this book demonstrate, immigration brought Lutherans, German Reformed Christians, Presbyterians, Methodists, Congregationalists, and Roman Catholics. In the Maritimes, the New Light Baptist movement created a sizeable religious community that refused to submit to the officially established Church of England (Christie 1990). Like the New Light Baptists, the Methodists in Upper Canada provided ‘cheap religion’ to people on the frontier who could not afford to support the Church of England with its elaborate places of worship and paid clergy (Clark 1962, 134–7). As these Methodists grew in number and power, they would challenge the privileges of the established church. In his famous report after the rebellions of 1837–8 in Upper and Lower Canada, Lord Durham observed that one of the causes of the unrest in Upper Canada was the privileges enjoyed by the Church of England. Consequently, in 1840 the government decided to divide the clergy reserves among a larger number of denominations – although the Church of England and the Church of Scotland still received the lion’s share. In 1854, the government liquidated the clergy reserves altogether. The dream of an established church – Protestant or Roman Catholic – in British North America was over. While the idea of an established church died in 1854, Canada was still imagined – not only by its elite but also by the vast majority of its inhabitants and immigrants – as an essentially Christian project. For example, at the time of Confederation, Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley, a proConfederation politician from Fredericton, New Brunswick, recalled the words of Psalm 72, verse 8: ‘He shall have Dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth,’ a biblical passage (referring to the ancient kingdom of Israel) that would become the motto used in the Canadian coat of arms. The new entity – neither exactly a colony nor an independent nation state – was called the Dominion of Canada, a name that spoke to its unresolved political identity vis-à-vis Great Britain as well as its unquestioned Christian foundations. For both the British and French communities alike, to be Canadian was to be Christian. From that assumption arose the support of Christian public education, the creation of social services institutions for the poor, the legislation of Christian morality (in the cases of sexual\n\n10\n\nPaul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nbehaviour and alcohol consumption, for example), laws protecting the Lord’s Day, state-sponsored Christian missions to the Aboriginal peoples (including the disastrous residential school system), efforts to ‘Christianize’ immigrants, and religious discrimination – sometimes amounting to persecution – against religious non-conformists, be they Christian or not (Airhart 1990, 101–31; J.W. Grant 1977, 13–16). From Confederation until the 1960s, the mainstream Protestant churches10 (the Anglicans, Presbyterians, and the United Church of Canada, later joined by ‘junior partners’ such as the Lutherans, Baptists, and evangelical groups) along with the Roman Catholic Church formed a ‘plural establishment.’ In the United States, the problem of religious pluralism was solved by articulating a theory of individual rights and erecting a ‘wall of separation’ between church and state. Although many Canadians today believe their society is also characterized by this American constitutional innovation, in fact the Canadian solution was more conservative, and no such de jure separation of church and state has ever existed here. The government formally recognized a limited number of mainstream denominations and supported their work. Moreover, the primary Christian churches enjoyed a cultural and social ‘establishment’ in that the dominant culture and political, economic, and social institutions were clearly defined by Christian values. Talal Asad has argued that the elite of any society claims the right to define its official ‘personality’ (2003, 7–8), for better or worse. In the case of Canada, Christianity set the foundation of that personality for the century after Confederation. The character of nationalism in Canada highlights this connection between Christianity on the one hand and the dominant English- and French-language cultures on the other. Broadly speaking, British culture and politics, Protestantism, and a belief in modern political, economic, and scientific ‘progress’ formed the three pillars of Canadian nationalism in English Canada. Roman Catholics, other Christians, and, of course, non-Christians struggled to find a legitimate place in this society.11 By contrast, among French Canadians, the French language and culture, the Roman Catholic faith, and the traditional agricultural lifestyle (anchored by the patriarchal family) formed the core of their national identity (Rioux 1976, 89; see Solange Lefebvre’s chapter 3 in this book). Remarkably, even though most French Canadians had become urban industrial workers by 1931, French Canadian nationalists still heralded and romanticized the life of the simple, pious, habitant farmer as the ideal well into the 1950s (Behiels 1985, 98). Both\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada 11\n\nEnglish and French versions of Canadian nationalism defined nonChristians as ‘other.’ Members of non-Christian groups, from Hindus and Sikhs to Jews and atheists, experienced marginalization and even persecution.12 The marriage between Christianity and Canadian nationalism has done much to determine the shape of Canadian society. Clearly the churches aided the Canadian state as it expanded its control over the country, and, as part of this hegemonic national project, the churches participated in the residential schools system. However, as is often the case in such matters, the overall effect of the churches’ intimate relationship with the Canadian state has been ambiguous. As mentioned earlier, the established nature of Christianity in Canada must have been experienced by most Euro-Canadians as a boon to their lives as they sought to make sense of their new and sometimes inhospitable environment. However, beyond the personal or existential benefits reaped by individuals living in a context in which their own religion is viewed as normative, the established or semi-established status of Christianity also had many largely positive social implications that contemporary Canadians continue to enjoy. For example, most of our social welfare agencies are now state-funded, secularized versions of originally Christian initiatives. At the turn of the century, neither political leaders nor the captains of industry saw it as their responsibility to ensure the welfare of the population, especially the neediest. Churches developed offices of poor relief, hospices for the elderly, orphanages, hospitals, and other such agencies (J.W. Grant 1972, 96–9). In English Canada, governments began to take over these agencies after the First World War, a process that was accelerated by the great need during the Depression of the 1930s and the rising expectations of the post-war boom of the 1950s. In Quebec, the churches controlled the social welfare bureaucracy for the entire province until the death of the conservative premier, Maurice Duplessis, in 1959. Even the Quebec school system was controlled by the churches until the government established a Ministry of Education in 1964. Until the 1960s, Christianity touched every element of Canadian public life. Secularization in Canadian Society However great the influence of Christianity, it was not the only social force that shaped Canada. From the mid-nineteenth century on, government and business leaders also pursued the political and economic\n\n12\n\nPaul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nmodernization of Canadian society, guided by the ideologies of liberalism and capitalism. In the first two periods of the development of church–state relations in Canada – the attempt at official establishment (1608–1840) and the creation of a ‘plural establishment’ (1840–1960)13 – there were clear tensions between the goals, values, practices, and vision of Christian churches and those of the political and economic elites. However, both the leaders of organized religion and their critics operated in a symbolic and social world deeply marked by Christian ideas, beliefs, and values.14 While we usually think of the secularization of Canada as beginning in the 1960s, in fact it began in the nineteenth century. Immediately after the First World War, there was a period of accelerated political and economic modernization, and the actors in the state and market began to feel restrained by religion. By the 1920s already, the provincial and federal governments started to constrain the powers of the churches and to take over areas of social service. The expansion of powers of the state and the presence of the market after the Second World War further accelerated this secularization. It is important to remember that in the 1950s, for example, it appeared that the churches were booming, and they were, in terms of raw numbers. However, the growth of church membership was a quite predictable by-product of the post-war baby boom and increased immigration. In fact, proportionally – that is to say, in relation to the overall growth in the Canadian population – all the Protestant churches were declining (Bibby 1987, 12–14). It was difficult to see this change while Christians were busy building churches, rectories, and halls in the rapidly expanding suburbs as fast as they could to keep up with the growing population (J.W. Grant 1972, 160).15 As Reginald Bibby put it, ‘Paradoxically, more people than ever before were staying away at precisely the same time as more people than ever before were attending’ (1987, 14). The process of secularization therefore is not an exclusively post1960s phenomenon. Since the end of the First World War, secularization in Canada was pragmatic, as actors in political and economic society sought to free themselves from the authority of the churches. In the name of liberty and efficiency, Canada’s elite – both English and French – began to define a public sphere free of religion.16 At first, institutions attached to the state and market simply declared their independence from the churches. Factories, mines, and other enterprises, for example, operated on Sundays. However, as both the state and market expanded the fields of their involvement, they soon took over activities that had\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada 13\n\nbeen the prerogative of the churches. One can see this change dramatically in the case of public education. Already in the 1960s, civil servants in Ontario were uncomfortable with the Christian culture and power of the clergy in most public schools. They sought to curtail the teaching of Christianity and to remove the church officials. At the same time, the Parent Commission in Quebec recommended the creation of a Ministry of Education, a move that signalled the beginning of the end of the churches’ control of schools in that province. Finally, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, along with a growing concern to promote a secular public school system, led to the de-Christianization of public schools across Canada.17 Through the regulation of existing institutions, governments have also taken control of church-sponsored hospitals and social welfare agencies – even though they may still be officially owned and operated by religious communities. To use the vocabulary of Talal Asad, the official personality of Canada is now religiously neutral. Nevertheless, it must be said that to the extent that any religion is privileged in Canada, it is mainstream Christianity. For example, important features of Canadian public life, such as the Constitution, the head of state, Parliament, the national anthem, currency, and the national motto retain references to Christianity. Often sessions of legislatures or municipal councils begin with the Lord’s Prayer. Christian feast days (e.g., Christmas, Good Friday) are still statutory holidays (Biles and Ibrahim 2005, 167). Other vestiges of Christian privilege remain. For example, the military supports an active chaplaincy that is almost exclusively Christian.18 As we shall see in the chapters of this book, Christian communities continue to control an extensive variety of public institutions: schools, colleges, universities, hospitals, social service agencies, credit unions, newspapers, cooperatives, and more. Moreover, Christian values and structures form the basis of many of our institutions – a reminder of this tradition’s historical privileges. Nonetheless, the point is that while the process of formally disentangling Christianity from important state institutions is incomplete, its current trajectory is undeniable.19 The secularization of Canadian society has unfolded in fits and starts and has been expressed unevenly across regions and sectors. It has also met with a great deal of resistance from members of the Christian community who felt and still feel – correctly, we would argue – that the world their parents and grandparents knew is passing away. Many of these Canadians experience the current de-Christianization period as a betrayal of the arrangement upon which Canada had been founded.\n\n14\n\nPaul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nThe effort in the past several decades to diminish the role of religion (read: Christianity) in official circles was motivated by two convictions. On the one hand, religion as such was considered by some secularists to be a relic of an earlier, less rational time and thus should be encouraged to disappear gracefully. One reason for this assumption among many members of the elite was the tacit acceptance of the idea that the modern state – and, perhaps even more importantly, the free market – needed to operate according to ‘rational’ principles rather than religious customs and traditions. On the other hand, many people considered religion to be inherently socially divisive and thus inappropriate in the institutions of a truly multicultural society. In other words, the involvement of religion in state affairs, they argued, would only hamper the development of a mature democratic, liberal, and multicultural society. Justice demanded the equal treatment of all Canadians, regardless of their religion, and state recognition of one religion hampered the search for social harmony. While Canada does not boast an official de jure ‘separation of church and state,’ it has adopted a political culture based on that principle. Finally, secularization developed as an unintended cultural consequence of the broader project to build a politically and economically modern Canada. Much has been written about the rise of modern individualism. Life in a democratic society of political equals and in a wage labour–consumer economy promoted a loosening of community bonds, including ethnic and religious bonds. Canadians – including many Christians – no longer relate to their religious institutions in the same manner. Sociologists have identified the privatization and subjectification of religion as important trends in Canada. What matters to people today, even to churchgoers, is their personal, subjective experience of the faith, rather than belonging to the right institution. Although Canadians have not become atheists in great numbers, it is true that they simply do not identify with denominations in a traditional way. British sociologist Grace Davie (1994) called this phenomenon ‘believing without belonging.’ Consequently, in Canada, we have seen dramatic drops in membership and attendance in almost every Christian denomination.20 This drop represents a crisis for many denominations because smaller numbers means near-empty churches on Sunday, fewer services, and poorer financial resources. Enormous churches, built for thousands of worshippers, are now occupied and supported by a few hundred – or even a few dozen – participants, usually older Canadians. For example, as Wendy Fletcher argues in this volume, the vast struc-\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada 15\n\nture of the Anglican Church of Canada is supported by the financial contributions of a small handful of mostly older members. Moreover, in Quebec the provincial government has intervened to save some Catholic churches as historical monuments. While Canadian Christians are staying away from religious institutions in record numbers, they are still attached to their Christian identity. Reginald Bibby (1987, 1993, 2002) reports that, despite low levels of membership and attendance, the majority of Canadian Christians still identify with the religious denominations of their parents. For most Canadians, Bibby argues, Christianity is still an important marker for questions of culture, meaning, and identity. However, others wonder exactly what this identity means, given that Canadians are decreasingly informed about the basics of Christian history, ritual, belief, and ethics. Danièle Hervieu-Léger (2006) uses the term ‘belonging without believing’ to describe people who claim to be Christian but really have a very diffuse, latent, or implicit connection to the tradition.21 As well, one sometimes hears the term cultural Christians used to describe people who formally identify themselves with Christianity but avoid Christian practices and are not familiar with the Bible, or Christian doctrines or history. So-called cultural Christians, for example, might hold Christian beliefs alongside beliefs in reincarnation, astrology, and Buddhism (Bibby 1987, 73–6).22 As editors, we noticed a recurrent theme in our mid-project discussions with the book’s authors. In almost all of the churches we have examined, we observed a distinctive rhetoric – or, to use a broader term, discourse – of loss. After all, in several of these chapters, the story being told is one of often rapidly diminishing communities struggling to remain viable religious institutions. More than just dismay at declining attendance and membership, this discourse of loss reflects the fact that the churches can no longer assume that their values and objectives are, in the Weberian sense, co-extensive with the values and objectives of the larger society. This is not to say that the churches no longer provide many of the existential benefits described earlier, but rather that things have changed categorically for them vis-à-vis their role in the broader society. Secularization and Post-Colonialism in Canada In recent decades, the structural, long-term pressures towards secularization (Swatos 1999) have been accelerated by cultural trends\n\n16\n\nPaul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nconnected to the broader complex shift in Canadian society from colonialism to post-colonialism. As Canadian governments over the last few decades have sought to make amends for past injustices, the historic role of the churches in the settlement of Canada has come under intense scrutiny, and for many people these institutions have not fared well under this close inspection. This is not the place for a full discussion of the problems these changes have created, but some of them need to be enumerated. First, and most fundamentally, it has become a fixture of educated public discourse that European Christianity was an integral part of the European colonial project – in Canada as in other countries. Especially among elites, its position has predictably led to some resentment and cynicism toward Christianity for its contribution to colonial arrogance. Christianity might have been welcomed by some indigenous peoples around the world, but in many places it was also a means of colonizing the imaginations of the indigenous people and of preparing them for their servitude to European masters. Second, and more specifically, the contemporary social, economic, and physical disadvantages of Canadian Aboriginals are linked to the cooperation between the churches and the Canadian state. After all, the churches were instrumental in what many Aboriginals consider to be cultural genocide; residential schools were federal projects, but they were staffed by church members who felt that physically and symbolically tearing children away from their families was the best and most merciful approach to dealing with what the head of the Department of Indian Affairs, Duncan Campbell Scott, called ‘the Indian problem.’23 It must be said that in some of these schools students were treated well by teachers and administrators who were sincere in their efforts to help the children adjust to the new political situation in which they found themselves. However, in the 1980s more and more students who attended these schools began to go on public record about the physical, sexual, psychological, and spiritual abuse they suffered, as well as the ethnocentric arrogance of the entire enterprise. Of course, they complained not just about the government policy on residential schools, but also about the complicity of the churches in their suffering (A. Grant 1996). While relations between residential school survivors on the one hand and the Canadian government and churches on the other hand are far from resolved – as the following ten chapters indicate – major legal and religious initiatives are underway toward this goal. Third, Canadians, and especially young Canadians, are increasingly\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada 17\n\nalienated by the church leadership’s attitude to sexuality. High-profile sexual abuse scandals in a number of denominations and traditions since the 1980s had a damaging effect on Christianity’s public image. Roman Catholic and evangelical churches certainly came under the most scrutiny for such abuses during this period, but such episodes certainly occurred in other (Christian and non-Christian) groups. Nonetheless, the sex scandals in a variety of Christian denominations brought into the foreground the deep ambivalence about human sexuality that is at the heart of Christian teaching (see Brown 1988). The sexually saturated popular culture that wields so much power among contemporary youth has widened the gulf between largely conservative churches and largely liberal youth. Moreover, with some notable exceptions (like the United Church and a faction within the Anglican Church), the churches’ positions in the widely publicized debates on same-sex marriage seems likely to alienate some youth, since studies have shown that support for expanding the definition of marriage is much higher for Canadians under age thirty-five than it is for those over sixty-five.24 Finally, in a society in which feminism has made remarkable advances, it is difficult to expect younger women and men to accept the exclusion of women from the upper echelons of church leadership (as is the case in all Roman Catholic, Ukrainian Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and most conservative Protestant churches). If the churches continue to espouse views on sex and gender equality that younger Christians (and their non-Christian peer group) consider to be anachronistic, the degree of alienation some youth already feel will almost certainly increase. As several chapters in this book illustrate, within larger denominations ethnic minority subgroups (such as, for example, Korean Canadian United Church members and African Canadian Anglicans) often espouse views on women’s rights, sexual activity, and same-sex marriage that are more conservative than those of the dominant anglophone or francophone denominational communities. However, such discrepancies may diminish over time as the second generation of immigrants assumes control of the subgroups. All of these changes are by-products of our post-colonial context. No longer can Christianity assume its role as the companion of the empire as the latter bestows European enlightenment upon the whole world. No longer can the Christian churches assume that their foundational principles with respect to sex and gender will be accepted – or even understood – by contemporary adherents of any ethnic background. No longer will Christians be able to assume that the church has or will\n\n18\n\nPaul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\never regain the same officially privileged place in the centre of North American society that it historically enjoyed, even though most individuals in that society are themselves Christians. Moreover, and perhaps most relevant to this book, no longer will Canadian Christians be able to assume that their co-religionists are all of European extraction. The Religion-Ethnicity-Culture Distinction It has become commonplace for individuals to make clear distinctions between their religious and ethnic identities; such lines are also drawn for them by others. By now it should be clear that such distinctions are problematic. On the surface, most of us believe we understand what a friend or colleague means when he or she says, ‘I am ethnically but not religiously Mennonite,’ or ‘I was baptized and confirmed in the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec but I would not really consider myself to be religiously Christian,’ or ‘I am thoroughly Greek, but I’m not Orthodox.’25 These kinds of earnest and seemingly self-evident comments may be emblematic of our current state of modernity or postmodernity, but it is far from obvious that we are prepared to understand their implications. According to a common (though disputed) way of understanding history, individuals and communities are now afforded unprecedented latitude in the way they define themselves. Previously – or so the story goes – the different strands in one’s identity were more or less ascribed by one’s family and community. Thus, for the overwhelming majority of the world’s Greeks for over a millennium, to be Greek was to be Greek Orthodox; during this long period, there was little inclination among Greeks to disentangle their Greek-ness from their attachment to the Greek Orthodox form of Christianity. In Canadian society (and also among Greek Canadians), the current disintegration – or at least attenuation – of such integrated modes of ethno-religious identity is a manifestation of the individualism and structural differentiation that have come to characterize our society in the past forty years. In modern societies, religion has not disappeared as predicted by many, but it has been assigned a distinct, more differentiated, and in some cases much more concentrated function, meaning that it has become disembedded from its previously more diffused and integrated role. Thus redefined, it must obey the ground rules set by more powerful spheres, such as the state (especially in its legal and administrative modes) and the marketplace. This repositioning naturally has diminished religion’s overall\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada 19\n\nsystemic power and has turned it into a kind of object, a commodity, subject therefore to fragmentation and piecemeal adoption by individuals (Berger 1967; Bibby 1987; V. Miller 2004). So, for example, as a result of the fact that Greeks in Canada travel more, are more aware of the broader world, and are probably less singularly attached to the nation state of Greece than any generation of Greeks in the past thousand years, individual Greeks are now far freer to choose the features of communal Greek identity that suit their individual tastes. In addition, Greek Canadians, living as they do in a multicultural environment, can also choose to embrace features associated with entirely different cultures. The latitude many people have in ‘negotiating’ distinctive identities – not to mention the relatively small costs one must pay to do so – is quite new and reflects the current shifting terrain in our culture. Imagine, for example, a Greek Canadian who adopts both Buddhism and vegetarianism and who marries an African Canadian atheist; we would speculate that such a person is less likely to be rejected by his friends and family today than ever before.26 Many people would applaud such a loosening in the bonds between the social realities into which one is born and one’s (increasingly ‘chosen’ or ‘negotiated’) identity; the proponents of this change are inclined to see it as a manifestation of the liberating impetus that is at the heart of the Enlightenment tradition that is itself so central to Western societies. However, underlying the claims mentioned above – that one is an ethnic but not religious Mennonite, Quebecer and Roman Catholic but not Christian, Greek but not Greek Orthodox – are some complex and often subconscious presuppositions about religion, ethnicity, and identity that look far more tenuous when they are examined closely. The primary problem in these distinctions is the artificial separation that is made between these modalities of identification. For example, in the Mennonite case the ethnic and cultural features associated with this tradition are intimately bound up with the religious features. In chapter 9, Roy Loewen explains that the distinctive language of Low German that distinguishes many Mennonites from other Europeans emerged (like Yiddish among Jews) as a result of centuries of explicit religious discrimination against this community by their European neighbours. As well, the long tradition of social activism and pacifism one finds in contemporary Mennonite culture (and also among those Mennonites who say they have no interest in religion) is in fact directly derived from the determinative role that pacifism\n\n20\n\nPaul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\n(even perhaps anti-statism) played throughout the development of the Mennonites as an explicitly religious group. The difficulty in extracting religion from ethnicity is made very clear in the case of francophone Quebecers – as Solange Lefebvre makes clear in her chapter. In 1970, Roman Catholic priest, sociologist, social activist, and nationalist Jacques Grand’Maison observed that French Canadians in the 1950s did not know if they embraced the religion of their culture or the culture of their religion (1970, 194). Even after Quebec culture became relatively secular after the 1970s, the Catholic Church still enjoyed a special symbolic position. Moreover, French Quebecers today – even though they do not, for the most part, participate in Roman Catholic rituals – do not convert to Protestantism in any significant numbers and continue to describe themselves as Roman Catholic when asked about their religion (Bibby 2004, 38). This ambiguous attitude to Catholicism is now a common feature of French Québécois national identity. This example illustrates that we need to pay attention to the local discursive backdrop against which assertions about religious and ethnic identity are made. That is, we need to see categories such as Mennonite, French Canadian, and Greek Orthodox as the beginning of a conversation about identity rather than the climax or conclusion of such a discussion. Since the meanings of all ethnic, national, and religious categories are increasingly fluid, it is important to be able to move beyond these labels and to ask people precisely what they mean when they describe themselves with reference to one of these categories. In other words, we need to avoid the fetishization of increasingly anachronistic notions of authenticity (Bramadat 2005b). For example, when a French Canadian claims to be Catholic but also claims not to attend church, partake in the sacraments, concern herself with the pope’s rulings, or even hold traditional beliefs about God, some people would be inclined to conclude that she is therefore not ‘really’ Catholic. However, it is best to avoid imposing assumptions on this individual about what makes one authentically Catholic, since she may indeed contribute to the emergence of a new form of Roman Catholic identity. In fact, the issue of identity is complex for almost everyone. A Canadian Christian woman of Nigerian descent, for example, stands at her own unique identity crossroads. She is a woman, an Anglican, a Nigerian citizen (recently and perhaps still), from a particular socio-economic class, educated to a certain level, healthy or unhealthy, married or single, a mother or not, homosexual or bisexual or heterosexual, a member of a particular family and tribe, a member of a specific genera-\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada 21\n\ntion, and so on. When we meet her, of course, we can come to know only a few of these dimensions of her identity. What interests us in this book is the way both her religious and ethnic self-understandings commingle in her own mind and in her interactions with others. In this book we seek a more nuanced understanding of these two particular features of her multidimensional identity because they are, in many – perhaps even most – human communities, two of the most influential forms of both self-identification and ascribed identification. Often a person will make unequivocal statements about which parts of her identity are religious and which are ethnic. When she is questioned about this distinction, however, she will very often become confused, revealing to what extent identity and all of its strands are dynamic personal projects rather than idées fixes or things-in-themselves.27 Recently philosophers have argued that a self (whether it is a Croatian, a Catholic, an atheist, or a Lutheran self) does not exist inviolably as an object of one’s own objective description. Rather, the self is to a large degree a wrought object, a fiction brought into being by its insertion at birth into a very specific set of social circumstances (constituted by class, caste, gender, race, religion, economy, nation, etc.). This is not to say that selves are ethereal or illusory; far from it – they are indisputably real, but they are constructed, highly mutable, highly creative, and always socially situated. One of the underlying assumptions of this book is that we cannot understand the Nigerian woman and the communities in which she is embedded unless we pay close attention to the ways religion and ethnicity, as two major components of her identity, interact – or to use more current anthropological language, the ways she ‘negotiates’ these two interpenetrating strands of her identity. Racial and Ethnic Diversity in Canada The key terms used in this book – race, ethnicity, religion, multiculturalism – are the subjects of a great deal of debate within the academic disciplines most closely related to them (so sociologists and biologists debate the notion of race, political scientists debate the notion of multiculturalism, anthropologists and philosophers debate the notion of culture, and so forth). Although this is not the place for a full discussion of these debates, some comments on the key matters at stake are warranted.28 Take, for example, the issues of race and racism. In Canadian churches, the presence of visible minorities as well as Aboriginal peo-\n\n22\n\nPaul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nples has awakened Christians to ethnic and racial pluralism.29 A Roman Catholic church filled with Irish, German, Polish, and Italian worshippers is in fact quite diverse, but it does not offer the same visual evidence of diversity as one that welcomes Filipino, Haitian, Vietnamese, and West African Catholics along with those of European descent. Given the history of racialized thinking in the West, Canadian churches, like the broader Canadian society, inevitably struggle with the issues of racism. For example, today several denominations are discussing the question of whether or not ethnic, racial, or otherwise ‘visible’ minorities are sufficiently represented in church leadership positions. This new sensitivity to ethnic and racial diversity has been fostered by Canada’s tradition of multiculturalism, understood both as an important Canadian policy and a widespread social tradition. The policy did not create the tradition; one might argue that some form of multiculturalism existed in Canada for decades before Trudeau created the policy in 1971. Some would point to Canada’s history of relative calm with respect to ethnic conflict, its reliance on immigration, and its general pattern of allowing newcomers to govern many aspects of their lives according to their own community’s sensibilities, as evidence of the deep roots of this tradition. However, while this proto-multicultural tendency within Canadian history might have foreshadowed our current situation, any consideration of the historical and contemporary plight of First Nations communities – not to mention the officially sanctioned discrimination faced by Black, Chinese, and South Asian newcomers until the middle of the twentieth century – reveals that for most of this country’s history, Canadian policies related to race, ethnicity, and culture were solidly colonialist and exclusionary.30 It has only been in roughly the last thirty-five years that Canadians have committed themselves (and still only incompletely) to the principles of tolerance and equality that were finally enshrined in the 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Just as the policy did not give birth to the tradition, the tradition did not create the policy in any linear and predictable manner. The formal policy grew out of a combination of daring political insight and shrewd political calculation. It represented, among other things, the Liberal Party’s attempt to ensure that ethnic, racial, and religious minority communities could participate more actively in Canadian cultural, social, economic, and political life; this participation, many assumed, would foster loyalty to the Liberal Party within ethnic communities.31 While the special statuses of Canada’s ‘two founding nations’ on the\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada 23\n\none hand and First Nations peoples on the other hand are entrenched in foundational Canadian documents, at least in theory multiculturalism quietly undermines the notion that any ethnic or national group (or cluster of groups) can claim supremacy in this country. The tradition espouses a notion of national, ethnic, and personal identity that is rooted in the reality that identities emerge out of ongoing dialogues between cultural groups, and between individuals, groups, and the larger society (Taylor 1994).32 Debates on the issue of multiculturalism often stem from conflicts within and between communities over the definition of ethnicity itself. Scholars usually define an ethnic group as a group of people, putatively related through common filiation – that is, through ‘blood’ or genes – whose members also usually feel a sense of attachment to a particular place, a history, and a culture (including a common language, food, clothing, etc.). To the group, this feeling often seems both innate (or natural) and immutable. However, many readers will be aware that many scholars suggest that ethnic identity, the sense of belonging to a ‘people,’ is constructed or at least heavily influenced by a variety of political, economic, and social forces.33 Some would argue that an ethnic consciousness emerges among a group of people who, in fact, may not be markedly different – genetically, historically, or culturally – from those of other supposedly distinct ethnic communities. Moreover, an ethnic identity is fluid; its core elements change over time. Since an ethnic group is as much a construction of a particular time and place as it is a primordial social or genetic fact (although the groups usually claim the latter),34 it is important to remember the powerful role of social and political forces in the creation or definition of putatively biologically linked groups. In modern societies, the term ethnicity also raises another problem. It is often used to describe minority groups, as if the culture of the majority were not also an ethnic culture. The culture of the majority is recast as natural or at least unfettered by irrational ethnic custom and tradition. In the Canadian context, most of the thinking and writing about ‘ethnicity’ examines only those communities that are assumed to operate at one or two steps removed from the centres of power, wealth, and status of Canadian society. In public and academic discourse, we tend to describe Canadians of Italian, Chinese, Portuguese, Greek, and South Asian descent as ‘ethnic,’ whereas we rarely use this term to describe Canadians of British or French heritage. This renders the culture and ethnicity of these dominant groups invisible while defining\n\n24\n\nPaul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nother groups outside of the circle of normality. The point is simply that those we consider ‘mainstream’ or ‘non-ethnic’ Canadians (Canadians of British and French descent) should also be considered ethnic Canadians. The ethnic communities associated with the descendents of British and French settlers are, of course, far larger and more heterogeneous than, say, Calgary’s Armenians, but nonetheless, one can – and should – still speak of the two ‘founding nations’ as communities of people bound together by a common historical narrative, genetic heritage, language, culture, food, and, to a very large extent, religion: that is, as ethnic groups. The emergence of a ‘Canadian ethnicity’ is an excellent example of the fluidity of this phenomenon. In the 1991 Census, as the result of a ‘Count Me Canadian’ campaign, some 750,000 people (mostly from Ontario) wrote in ‘Canadian’ as their ethnic identity – a choice not offered on the census form. In the subsequent census of 1996, about 8.8 million people chose to identify themselves as Canadian either solely (some 5.3 million) or in combination with another origin (3.5 million). In the 2001 Census, 11,682,680 people (or 39 per cent of the total population) identified their ethnic origin as ‘Canadian,’ by far the largest single category (Jedwab 2003, 36).35 Do these choices reflect the emergence of a new ‘Canadian ethnicity’? The people who identified their ethnic origins as Canadian were mostly people who spoke English or French as a mother tongue and who had two parents born in Canada (Jedwab 2003, 37). In fact, the choice was most popular in Quebec, where the French term Canadien has a slightly different meaning, that is, someone who feels part of a French-language people that is distinct from both France and the rest of the anglophone cultures of Canada and the United States. Moreover, many people felt that pride in being Canadian did not contradict their pride in having Italian, Greek, or Hungarian roots as well. Indeed, Canada’s official policy of multiculturalism affirmed the choice to embrace both identities and celebrate both heritages (Jedwab 2003, 38–40). In Quebec, a parallel development has led to the widespread idea of ‘Québécois’ as a unique ethnic identity. After the Quiet Revolution of the early 1960s focused the attention of French Canadians on the Quebec state apparatus as the most important means of national self-determination (it was the only government in which they exercised majority control), francophone Quebecers started thinking of themselves as ‘Quebecois,’ a term previously used only to describe residents of Quebec City. The nationalist movement, and especially the election of the\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada 25\n\n‘independentist’ Parti Québécois in 1976, fortified the already strong identity and solidarity that many francophone Quebecers shared. In dealing with the question of Christianity and ethnicity in Canada, several of the authors of this volume noted that, in their communities, Christians were beginning to view their churches as uniquely Canadian. In the case of Quebec, many francophone Quebecers view the Roman Catholic Church as uniquely Quebecois. Indeed francophone Quebecers simply refer to the Roman Catholic Church in that province as ‘l’Église du Québec’ or simply ‘the church.’ This raises the important question of the interaction of Canadian and francophone Quebecer ethnicity and Christianity. Religion has played a major role in the construction of Canadian ‘ethnicity.’ As noted above, the English Canadian version of this national identity was generally informed by British and American culture, language, and political institutions, by participation in Anglo-American capitalism, and by an adherence to Protestantism. Just as Protestants, the dominant players in American society, after the Second World War began to accept Roman Catholics and Jews (Herberg 1983) as legitimate citizens, a similar opening up was beginning to occur in Canadian society. Moreover, as Canada became more secular the role of religion became more indirect. Protestant values (such as its individualism, strong sense of moral self-reliance, work ethic, etc.) remained central to a certain ‘Canadian’ ethnic identity – even as religious tolerance became a core feature of that identity. In turn, the Canadian experience reinforced in people an idea that they were separate from their religious counterparts in other countries. For example, over the course of history Scottish Presbyterians here loosened their connections to Scotland and began to think of themselves as comprising a fundamentally Canadian church. The United Church of Canada is the most overt example of a church community (or, in this case, several communities) severing ties with the founding communities in Great Britain and the United States and identifying itself wholeheartedly as Canadian. However, even Canadian Anglicans and Roman Catholics, who maintain strong ties to their international bodies, think of themselves as Canadian Anglicans and Catholics. The connection between Christianity and Canadian or francophone Quebecer identity becomes clearer when we ask when churches ceased to be ‘branch plant’ operations of a foreign denomination. All of the large historical churches have had to wrestle with this issue. Three criteria may be suggested in an analysis of when a church ceased being a\n\n26\n\nPaul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nmission field tied to the mother church and thereafter became a self-sufficient Canadian church. First, when did the church cease to rely on resources from the ‘homeland’ and begin to provide its own resources, especially in terms of clergy? Second, when did the denomination gain administrative or legal autonomy from its ‘home’ church in the United Kingdom, Europe, or the United States?36 Third, when was the church recognized by the Canadian government for inclusion in national programs such as health care, education, involvement in Aboriginal residential schools, and provision of chaplains for the armed forces and prison system? When a church meets these requirements, it can be said to be a ‘Canadian’ institution. Participation in such institutions promotes a shared world of meaning for their members (Deutsch 1962). Such shared horizons help to create in the minds of participants the notion of a unique Canadian or French Quebecer ethnic identity.37 Religion and the Heterogeneity of the Christian Community The growing consensus in the academy about the socially constructed nature of ethnicity, race, and culture has made scholars reluctant to create rigid definitions for any of their core topics, including – even, especially – religion. Although the debate about the definition of religion is ongoing, this book is less concerned about the study of religions in the abstract than it is about the study of the relationship between Canadian ethnicities and Canadian Christianity (or, perhaps, Christianities).38 This perspective implies two things about how we will approach religion. First, we will have to account for religion in its phenomenological totality. When not preoccupied with texts, the common definitions of religion employed in academic and public discourse tended to emphasize either the religious experiences or beliefs of individuals.39 Religion, many assumed, was essentially an experience or a set of ideas about reality. Practices, forms of community, and institutions were thought to have been derived logically from these experiences and beliefs. Recently, scholars have questioned these assumptions by looking at religion as a multidimensional social phenomenon.40 Almost all religions make theological and cosmological assertions about transcendent or ultimate reality. However, all religions include practices and rituals, forms of community, and institutions, all of which are just as important as – and some might even argue, precede – the beliefs and experiences of individuals (Bell 1997; Lincoln 2003, 6–8). Consequently, in order to give a full description of the interaction between Christianity and eth-\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada 27\n\nnicity in Canada, the authors in this book examine religious beliefs, to be sure, but also religious practices, communities, and institutions, and the broader social context in which these are rooted. Second, there is a growing consensus that religion should not be thought of simply as a timeless homogeneous ‘thing’ that we as scholars can easily subject to dispassionate, objective study. The term Christianity appears to name a single phenomenon, but is in fact a term somewhat artificially imposed on a wide variety of ideas, values, practices, and institutions about which some insiders and outsiders will contend there is very little consensus. For example, in North America there are evangelical and fundamentalist Protestants who object to the common sociological assertion that the majority of North Americans are Christians. In fact, as Bramadat discovered in his fieldwork (2000), many evangelicals estimate that only roughly 10–15 per cent of Canadians are, in fact, authentic ‘Christians’ (a figure much lower than the usual census-based estimates of roughly 75–80 per cent). These conservative Protestants prefer to limit the term to those people who claim to have a ‘personal relationship with Jesus.’ As a matter of course, some evangelicals exclude almost all Roman Catholics from the category of Christian because of the latter’s alleged disinterest in this form of personal relationship (Bramadat 2000; Stackhouse 1993).41 Moreover, there are members of this conservative tradition who adhere to a literalist approach to the Bible and Christ’s divinity who are extremely uncomfortable with others – such as some of the more liberal members of the United Church of Canada – who view the Bible as one important book of wisdom among others, and who view Jesus as an exemplary but not necessarily uniquely divine figure. The tensions between liberal United Church Christians, Roman Catholics, and their fundamentalist Christian neighbours represent just some of the broader cleavages in the Christian tradition; there are, of course, others, including those around religious rituals such as the Eucharist, the religious calendar, as well as the role of women, and, more recently, the morality of same-sex marriage. Nevertheless, although the internal diversity within Christianity is dramatic, and sometimes categorical, there is usually enough overlap in the histories and the sources of these communities that those of us on the outside can consider them to be variants of the same tradition. Still, any thorough analysis of Canadian Christianity, or even of one of its constituent denominations, must wrestle with the coexistence of significant heterogeneity and enduring similarity.\n\n28\n\nPaul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nInstitutional Completeness Given that our approach accepts the socially constructed nature of religion, it follows that we would be concerned with the vehicles of this construction, especially institutions. Even the most privatized and personal faith requires an institutional structure.42 Self-help books, seminars in spirituality, meditation seminars, and the like all require institutions to continue. Publishing houses, retreat facilities, new religious movements, bookstores, and the Internet contribute to a distinct institutional framework for these highly individualistic forms of religiosity. They operate alongside churches, schools, social service agencies, youth clubs, and other more traditional forms of institutionalization. The Canadian sociologist Raymond Breton coined the term institutional completeness to describe the degree to which members of a given ethnic or religious community can live their whole lives within the orbit of their own community. For example, the Canadian Jewish communities in Montreal, Toronto, and Winnipeg – all three of which are well-rooted – are usually cited as the classic examples of high levels of institutional completeness (Brym, Shaffir, and Weinfeld 1993; Ravvin 2005). Jews in these three cities can make use of explicitly Jewish schools, recreational facilities, grocery stores, restaurants, social service agencies, theatre companies, museums, dating services, cemeteries, and medical services including (with the exception of Winnipeg) hospitals. Obviously, these social structures protect and promote Jewish identity both at the individual and communal levels. The Cambodian and Vietnamese Buddhist communities, on the other hand, are often cited as ethno-religious communities with very low levels of institutional completeness (Boisvert 2005; Bramadat and Seljak 2005; McLellan 1999); such low levels are fairly assumed to limit the potential for social integration and mobility of members of these communities.43 Of course, one can also determine the institutional completeness of not just religious communities as a whole, but also of ethnic communities within the majority Christian population. For example, when an Italian Roman Catholic immigrates to Canada, he can make use of a large number of secular and religious organizations to aid his integration. On the one hand, if he makes the same choice that the vast majority of immigrants make – that is, to live in Montreal, Toronto, or Vancouver – he can involve himself in secular Italian social service agencies, private cafés, sports teams, and political associations, all of which are created by and for Italian Canadians. On the other hand,\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada 29\n\nregardless of how religiously observant he was in Italy, he can very easily become part of a large and institutionally entrenched Italian Roman Catholic community in Canada. Moreover, in many provinces he can enjoy a privilege very few non-Christian immigrants enjoy: he can send his children to state-funded Roman Catholic schools. In other words, he does not need to worry about whether or not his new Italian community is – either in the secular or religious spheres – well established. While Breton originally coined the term institutional completeness to study ethnic and religious minorities, we do not want to ignore Canada’s ethno-religious majority groups and how their own identity is embedded in Canadian social institutions. Just as we wish to foreground the ethnicity of the dominant Canadian cultures, we also want to unearth the more subtle networks of power in which Canadian Christianity is embedded. Consequently, it behooves us to observe again the way in which the traditional dominant ethnic communities in Canada – that is, the French and British, but also the members of other well-integrated western European ethnic communities such as the Dutch, Belgians, Germans, and Scandinavians – enjoy what we might describe as government-sponsored institutional completeness. This is evidenced most obviously in the two official languages in Canada, the Eurocentric nature of our school curricula, the combination of French and British roots of our legal systems, the many privileges afforded to the Anglican, Roman Catholic, and certain Protestant churches for many decades, the federal provisions guaranteeing state funding for Roman Catholic separate schools in Ontario, as well as the patchwork of provincial arrangements for state funding of religious education.44 To put it in real terms, a British Anglican immigrant does not need to worry that she will find herself in a totally foreign world upon her arrival in Halifax; a Somali Muslim immigrant does. In itself, this is not an indication of discrimination. This reality merely reflects which communities arrived here first, and therefore which communities were able to become institutionally complete first. It is, however, important to note that when the British immigrant seeks to integrate into Halifax, she will find dozens of stately old Anglican churches. She will find government offices, schools, businesses, social clubs, and every variety of institution organized according to cultural principles that she can understand. Moreover, every bureaucrat, real estate agent, school principal, lawyer, banker, grocer, and waiter she meets will speak English (thanks in part to the state-supported pre-eminence of English). In\n\n30\n\nPaul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nshort, she will be able to take advantage of a deeply rooted and publicly funded form of institutional completeness. This is simply because the nation state functions to guarantee the culture of one particular group (Gellner 1983). What immigrants from other cultures must fight for, members of the dominant group take for granted. The Somali immigrant, on the other hand, faces a large number of obstacles, including a new language, a new set of moral and social customs, and many negative stereotypes. In addition, the institutions she was so familiar with in Somalia are absent here. She must adapt to schools, hospitals, businesses, and government offices that are organized in ways radically different from those with which she is familiar.45 Because the Italian immigrant mentioned above may not speak English as a first language, he will likely face greater challenges than the British immigrant, but almost certainly less than the Somali immigrant. While he may find many Canadian institutions foreign, others (such as Italian restaurants, stores, businesses, cultural and sports clubs, and, significantly, state-sponsored Roman Catholic schools) will ease his integration and adaptation to Canadian life.46 The point is that all immigrants must come to terms with – or, in some cases, can enjoy – the existing state-funded institutional completeness that characterizes the descendents of the early European settlers. Christianity and Ethnicity in Canada Given these complex questions about the relationship between ethnicity and religion in Canada, it is surprising that no one has addressed the issue in a sustained and systematic way. That is what this book attempts to do. In most co-edited books, chapters are loosely arranged by the editors to address different facets of a common topic. Typically, the authors never meet one another, or even the editors; consequently, the authors have different goals and may envisage different audiences. Like Religion and Ethnicity in Canada, this book has been conceived quite differently. In both cases, under the auspices of the Centre for Studies in Religion and Society at the University of Victoria, the authors met twice to develop a common project and to enter into dialogue with one another. However, authors were also asked to bring their unique perspectives and methods to bear on their chapters in order to produce an original piece of research that fits within the traditional framework of sound scholarship. To maintain this balance between the diversity of the authors and the\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada 31\n\nunity of the book, as a group we developed a very loose template of core issues to discuss. These issues included: • the changing nature of religious practices and ideas; • the current demographic reality; • the social, economic, and political inclinations of the individuals and groups involved; • the history of migration to Canada; • ethnographies and life histories; • the major contemporary challenges facing each community; • the extent of institutional completeness within each community; • the structure of major communal organizations; • racism and religious discrimination; • the role of women; • second-/third-/fourth-generation concerns; and • the role of the community in the broader Canadian public arena. When we began discussions about the structure and focus of this book, we realized that we would need to make some difficult decisions about which groups to include and which ones to exclude. We adopted the guiding principles of size and the historical importance and continuity of the traditions in Canada. Unfortunately, space does not permit us to explore in depth some very interesting but numerically smaller groups, such as Doukhobors, Mormons (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), Hutterites, Seventh Day Adventists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Quakers, and the Salvation Army. Although some of these groups are mentioned in the chapters on evangelicals and the Eastern Christian traditions, we leave to the authors of a future volume a fuller discussion of the intersection between ethnic and religious identities in these and other smaller Christian traditions. As well, we hope that the complex relationship between Aboriginal Canadians and Christianity will be explored by other scholars. The central analytical focus in the current volume is ethnicity – a concept that is not clearly relevant in First Nations discourse. Consequently, we felt that a full discussion of the unique Aboriginal Christian community in Canada would be more appropriate in a separate book. It is also worth noting here that while most chapters explore the role of ethnicity within a single and easily identifiable religious community (e.g., the Lutherans, Anglicans, etc.), in the case of four chapters we faced distinct challenges in delineating the boundaries of the subject\n\n32\n\nPaul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nmatter. The history of Canada and the social reality of the linguistic divide between anglophones and francophones forced us to make some hard – and not infrequently arbitrary – decisions. In the case of the two chapters on the Roman Catholic community, the division we have suggested between Roman Catholics in English and French speaking Canada will no doubt seem intuitively correct to many readers. A thirdgeneration English-speaking Italian Canadian Catholic in Montreal is officially a member of the largely francophone Quebec province of the church, although this community is explored in the chapter on Englishspeaking Canada; similarly, Franco-Manitobans find themselves in largely anglophone dioceses, although this community is mentioned in the chapter on French-speaking Canada. Myroslaw Tataryn faces perhaps the most daunting challenge of all of our authors, since he must address the place of ethnicity in the broadest religious category in this book, one that includes not only Canadians of Ukrainian Catholic background, but those of Orthodox Christian origins who trace their lineage to countries as distinct as Lebanon, Russia Lithuania, Ukraine, and Egypt. Similarly, Bruce Guenther must examine the place of ethnicity in the decentralized, heterogeneous, and highly dynamic conservative Protestant tradition, which includes – among dozens of others – Pentecostal, Baptist, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Nazarene, and some Mennonite churches. While there is a degree of arbitrariness in any interpretive category, as a group we decided that the communities and individuals we have gathered in these chapters share enough common features to justify these typologies. Three chapters of this book (on Anglicans, Presbyterians, and the United Church of Canada) address the issue of ethnicity in those three pillars of Canada’s Protestant establishment. The three communities share a long history on Canadian soil, British (and American) roots, an experience of religious and political leadership and privilege and, very recently, precipitous declines in membership and attendance. Because of their long history in Canada, their active involvement in Canadian public policy, as well as their ties to Canada’s political and economic elite, these communities developed the strongest sense of a Canadian ‘ethnic’ identity; that is, they saw themselves as essentially Canadian communities, more and more distinguished from their British and American counterparts. Moreover, all three churches have been hard hit by the forces of secularization, losing members and participants since 1960. Each in its own way has had to struggle with declining pres-\n\nChristianity and Ethnicity in Canada 33\n\ntige, influence, and resources. In this period of decline, immigrants from Asia, Africa, and Latin America have joined these churches, adding a new vitality. In fact, in most cases it might even be the case that without these newcomers the situation in each of these churches would be not merely serious, but dire indeed. Nonetheless, with the new vitality come fundamental challenges to both the historic ethnic profiles of these established communities and to the ways the denominations have over the twentieth century defined themselves as distinctly Canadian. In theory, the story of religion and ethnicity among Anglicans ought to be a simple affair; it is ‘the Church of England’ after all. However, in Wendy Fletcher’s chapter 4 on Canada’s Anglicans, we see how this community now struggles to integrate an assortment of non-British ethnic groups. Once embedded in a Canada where politicians could earnestly declare, ‘This is a British country,’ the Anglican Church now struggles to find a place in a new, multicultural, multi-faith, and increasingly secular Canadian society. Fletcher notes that Anglicans are now losing members at an alarming rate. However, there is a tension within this community between the emerging ‘discourse of loss’ regarding their historic power, and the efforts – perhaps even the profound need – to welcome Anglicans from Africa and Asia. While often more dynamic, newer Anglican immigrant parishes tend to be quite theologically and morally conservative, and this often exacerbates divisions within a denomination still struggling with women’s ordination, same-sex union, and other issues. Stuart Macdonald tells a similar story of the Presbyterian Church of Canada. He points out that the easy identification of Canadian Presbyterianism with Scots (and highland Scots, at that) has always been an over-simplification. Moreover, like the Anglicans, the Presbyterians are losing ground. For example, the 2001 Census showed a drop of 35 per cent in the number of people identifying themselves as Presbyterian (compared with 1991 figures). Partly in an effort to respond meaningfully to this dramatic decline and partly in order to better reflect the tradition of multiculturalism in Canada, the Presbyterian Church of Canada has become very resourceful in accommodating diverse ethnic groups from around the world. In his chapter Macdonald also explores the Christian Reformed Church – another community that traces its roots to the Swiss Reformation. In this community, ethnic solidarity takes a back seat to religious identity, Macdonald explains. The post– Second World War Dutch immigrants adopted the English language as\n\n34\n\nPaul Bramadat and David Seljak\n\nquickly as they could but also insisted on creating separate Christian social institutions (such as schools and labour unions) to accommodate their adherents’ unique religious orientation. Greer Anne Wenh-In Ng examines the United Church of Canada as a community in which the sense of a Canadian identity has become strongest. The United Church was born in 1925 out of the dream of creating a broad-based national church. As the nation became more open to multiculturalism, so too did the United Church of Canada. Ng highlights the denomination’s Ethnic Ministry Unit as an example of an attempt to allow minority groups a forum of self-expression and selfdetermination in a church that has become thoroughly Canadian. She argues that the United Church finds that its progressive stances on social issues reflects Canadian values, but this sometimes brings the dominant church community into conflict with some of its immigrant congregations that are more conservative on social and sexual issues. However, on other issues – such as accommodation of diversity – it is the minority groups that challenge the church to become more inclusive and open. The situation of the Roman Catholic community in Canada is more complex because, in comparison with the three mainline Protestant churches, it is much more divided by ethnicity and language. The French created the first Roman Catholic communities and, as Solange Lefebvre argues in her chapter, since then Roman Catholicism and the ethnic identity of Canadian francophones have been inseparable. In New France, Catholicism was the established religion and the church enjoyed many privileges. After the Treaty of Paris of 1763 (and even more so after th"
