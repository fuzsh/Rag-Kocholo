        "text": "La Trobe University colours Black ref|The use of black dates back to the early years of the university, most likely originating from the La Trobe University Football Club. When La Trobe first opened in 1967 its sports clubs used the University of Melbourne as a benchmark to emulate. One outcome of this was the creation of the La Trobe University Reds and the La Trobe University Blacks in 1968, which was based on the University Blues and the University Blacks at Melbourne.|group=Note\n\nRoyal Military College, Duntroon colours Regimental Colours consist of the badge of the Corps of Staff Cadets on a blue ensign. Additionally, the Sovereign's Company carries the Queen's Colours, which originally comprised the Union Flag with a Crown and Royal Cipher as central motif, however, since 1970 the Australian National Flag has replaced the Union Flag on the Queen's Colours"
