        "text": "Death of a Blog...\n\nWell, this is it. I spent the last 20 minutes or so deleting the 800 or so entries I've made over the last four and a half years. Despite the 800 entries, over 6,000 comments and the 1,500 letters of support that were posted for America's Finest in harms way I've decided to retire the slaughterhouse.\n\nI've met great people over these four years. Many of you I have regular email contact with. Others I've lost touch with.\n\nThose of you who actually take the time to read this post will remember how green I seemed when I first started blogging and how passionate I became in my support of my brothers and sisters in arms. You�ll remember the knighthood in Emperor Misha�s court and may have even noticed that I broke into the top 100 blogs for short time. You'll also remember how much emotion I put into all of my blogs (except maybe with the exception of the jokes). When I started my blog I told myself that if all went well I�d retire the site at 1,000,000 hits, as you can see I only made it a third of the way. Life happens and for me it happens all over the world.\n\nMany of you will remember how we stopped John \"Waffles\" Kerry from winning the Whitehouse, or so we like to think. Others may remember the tributes to the troops, or the deaths of several famous people; among them my boyhood hero, the real Superman, Christopher Reeves.\n\nFamily will likely remember my birthday wishes to my beautiful kids, the rough patch I went through with my divorce and how fortunate I was to meet the love of my life. I really do feel blessed to have such a wonderful wife and best friend.\n\nIt wasn't an easy decision to delete the Slaughterhouse, but it was a conclusion I came to nonetheless. It was too hard to keep up with writing about life while I was actually living it. That and the fact that the comments have become nothing more than a sperm bank for spammers.\n\nSo to my fellow friends in the Blogosphere, I bid you adieu, and Godspeed.\n\nTo my family and close friends you know where to find me.\n\nFor the last time....\n\nSlagleRock Out!\n\nPosted by SlagleRock at May 20, 2008 03:03 AM | TrackBack"
