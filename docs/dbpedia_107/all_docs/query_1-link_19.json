While B-C’s picture of Jesus has much in common with that of liberal Protestantism, his emphasis on the Jewish tradition in interpreting the NT is distinctive. His view that Jesus must have been married, his understanding of Jesus’ messianic self-consciousness and resurrection, and his opinion on the relationship between Heb and Qumran will inspire questions. The “bringing home” of the major figures of the NT to their Jewish origins will certainly promote Jewish-Christian dialogue. — D.J.H. 781. R. J. Dillon, “The Unity of the Gospel in the Variety of the Canon,” Catholic Theological Society of America Proceedings 27 (72) 85-115. In the early church a regula fidei for Christian proclamation was furnished by credal formulas, whose “canonical” function for the earliest authors was ulti¬ mately inherited by the books they wrote for their churches. The analysis of NT writings (especially Paul’s letters and the Synoptic Gospels) reveals a habit of reaching back to traditional statements of the gospel’s central truth as well as a situational factor motivating both the choice and the adaptation of the state¬ ments. The earliest writers’ frequent recourse to faith-symbols was based upon the fundamental recognition that the gospel is one and indivisible and that its center should be pursued conscientiously and unremittingly by the believer. Yet no formula cast in human language can confer a possession of the gospel, for “the kanon tes aletheias is not the biblical text itself. It isj that which awaits us beyond the text, in the presence of our genuine obedience and God’s gracious bestowal.” — D.J.H. 782. R. W. Graham, “C. H. Dodd: His Work and His Interpreters,” Lex TheolQuart 8 (1, 73) 1-10. A review of C. H. Dodd’s work along with discussions of four articles on his thought which appeared between 1957 and 1966.

The characterization of De Resurrectione as supporting the left-wing Pauline movement may be misleading. It is questionable whether a Gattung such as ARTICLES] NT GENERAL 267 “signs-source” can serve as the starting-point for a trajectory or whether the concept of “miracle story” can explain many very different pericopes. We cannot place the “signs-source” of Jn beside the sources available to Mark in order to characterize both as aretalogies. While K is correct is saying that Christianity did not begin with fixed creeds or dogmas, confessions of faith were extremely important in earliest Christianity. Also, the effect of Jesus’ preaching and work on the Roman authorities and their Jewish collaborators deserves more atten¬ tion. In general, future work along the lines suggested by the authors should place emphasis on social and political conditions as well as religious factors. — D.J.H. 784. C.

L. Alonso Schokel, “Is Exegesis Necessary?” Concilium 70 (71) 30-38. Scientific exegesis can provide a service to the universal community as well as to local communities. The service consists of translation, linguistics (the concepts, symbols, formulas and structures), method, and revealing the hidden riches of the text. One of the ways that tradition transmits and interprets Scripture in a living context is by making use of the discoveries of scientific exegesis. Tradition can, however, “include traditions that hinder a right under¬ standing of Scripture today.” — S.B.M. 787. D. Attinger, “Come leggere la Bibbia. Per una lettura comunitaria della Bibbia. 4,” Servitium 6 (27, 72) 599-604. [Cf. § 17-401.] For a community reading of the Bible the members need to become “charis- matics,” each one contributing his share in creating the community and con¬ vinced that Jesus lives and challenges him today. After an exegesis of the passage under study, three questions should be addressed to the text: what does it say about God, about man, and about their relation to each other, with applications to each one’s present situation? — J.J.C. [NTA 17 (3, 73)1 (f f 268 NT GENERAL 788. D. Attinger, “Come leggere la Bibbia. L’Evangelo per L poveri. 5,” Servitium 6 (28, 72) 835-840. One should read the Bible with the attitude of a “little one” or with the faith of a child, which means continually asking questions, profiting from the learning of theologians, and discovering in the sacred pages the God who is love. — J.J.C. 789. J. Audinet, “The Banquet of Scripture: The Bible and Adult Catechesis,” Concilium 70 (71) 129-140. Scripture is no longer strictly the church’s book in either circulation or interpretation; increasingly the Bible is seen as merely one more part of the cultural heritage of all men. Yet within the church the function of Scripture is changing markedly; its authority is no longer acknowledged unconditionally or even uniformly. Nevertheless, for the Christian the Bible remains given. What must be constructed now, in light of recent developments in education as well as theology, is a modern lectio divina whose starting point is Scripture. — J.W.D. 790. P. Baelz, “Old Wine in New Bottles,” Theology 76 (633, 73) 115-125. A survey of the hermeneutical problems raised by historical criticism and the breakdown of the Reformation principle of scriptural interpretation. Although the Scriptures continue to speak to us today, they do so in a form which is often distant and strange. As faithful stewards of the mysteries of God we must be prepared to bring out of our treasures things both old and new. It is of the nature of the gospel itself and of its communication with which we have been entrusted that we have to learn to speak the old truth in new ways. — D.J.H. 791r. G. G. Blum, Offenbarung und Uberlieferung [cf. NTA 16, p. 230]. J. T. Burtchaell, CathBibQuart 35 (1, 73) 76-78. — Though occasionally vague and often too flattering to Dei Verbum, this monograph is sensible, has its ecumenical sights well focused, and is at times (as in the treatment of the Roman primacy) courageous. There are, however, tendencies to back off from controversies, to extract more from Dei Verbum than the council fathers can be congratulated for having meant by it, and to make early patristic texts yield more recondite and diversified meanings than is fair. — D.J.H. 792. S. Castro Sanchez, “Hermeneutica y lectura cristiana de la Biblia hoy,” RevistEspir 31 (124, 72) 269-291. The general hermeneutical problem for a Christian reading of the Bible today is set forth, then the existential interpretation of Bultmann analyzed. : One serious defect in his method is that he reduces Christian truth to a form : or practice. A believer acts as if things were so and as if the truths are myths :,! challenging him to a decision. The Catholic method according to the principles of Vatican II is then outlined, and the approaches of W. Pannenberg and K. i ARTICLES] INTERPRETATION 269 Rahner are discussed. Finally, the article describes the characteristic traits of modern man and explains how the Bible today can speak to him. — J.J.C. 793. B. S. Childs, “The Old Testament as Scripture of the Church,” ConcTheol Mon 43 (11, 72) 709-722. The canon is the place for the modern church to start seeking to regain an understanding of the Bible as its Scripture. By tying the Christian faith to an authoritative body of Scripture, the ancient church sought to establish its truth in terms of both historical and theological continuity with the prophets and apostles. Acceptance of the canon implies that the Christian faith is tied to a particular historical witness, that the church which formed the canon as a critical norm to preserve the truth of the gospel is a community of faith, and that the Spirit of the resurrected Christ continues to make his will known to his church through the medium of Scripture. The remainder of the article illustrates the meaning of “canonical criticism” in the case of the Pentateuch. — D.J.H. 794. A. Delgado, “La Unidad de las Escrituras,” ScriptTheol 4 (1, 72) 7-82. In Vatican IPs document Dei Verbum the phrase “unity of the whole of Scrip¬ ture” is used for the first time in an ecclesiastical document of this importance. To understand the import of this phrase we need to inquire into the relation of canonicity to the unity of Scripture in the writings of the 4th century. Then we need to study the idea of the unity of the two Testaments in the documents of the 5th century. From the high Middle Ages we have four principal documents, in¬ cluding that of the Council of Florence, that show the unity of the two Testa¬ ments to rest on the unity of God and the unity of creation. [To be continued.] — S.B.M. 795. F. Donadio, “Storia ed escatologia in Rudolf Bultmann,” Sapienza 25 (3, 72) 300-325. A detailed exposition of Bultmann’s concept of history and eschatology reveals that his hermeneutical presuppositions contain an ambiguity which affects his conclusions. The idea of considering historical reality objectively ( Historie ) and existentially ( Geschichte ) introduces an inevitable ontological dualism into the very nature of historical reality. At the same time, one must be grateful for his many helpful insights. His system, based upon interpretations which are at times questionable, and proposed in Heideggerian categories, is a major cultural achievement of present-day exegesis and spirituality. — J.J.C. 796. W. G. Doty, “Linguistics and Biblical Criticism,” JournAmAcadRel 41 (1, 73) 114-121. A report on the “Generative Poetics” research team at Bonn, led by E. Giittgemanns. The term suggests that there is an innate regularity or grammati- cality to human expression ; that is, that human expression conforms to particular rules, according to which utterances are generated by the speaker or, secondarily, [NTA 17 (3, 73) 270 NT GENERAL by the analyst who knows the rules. The program of Generative Poetics of the NT is the attempt to detect the linguistic rules followed (albeit implicitly) by canonical writers and to judge performances accordingly. Its major concerns are the regularizing of the transformations, genre studies, text semantics, con¬ text- or corpus-grammar, and the function of iconic signs. Its use of narrative analysis and folklore studies raises serious questions for NT form-critics. “It is partly to bringing biblical literary criticism into the mainstream of the disciplines of the humanities that the movement addresses itself.” — D J.H. 797. B. Dreher, “Exegesis and Proclamation,” Concilium 70 (’71) 56-66. “Scientifically-oriented exegesis ... is part of the essential task of proclama¬ tion.” Historical-critical exegesis is an essential tool of this proclamation, and it will have done its work “when the word is made to inspire the preaching of the word.” In its scientifically established form, exegesis can only be the starting point and norm of Christian discourse. Thus the basic formula is “Scientific exegesis is the correlative of a homily oriented to the present.” — S.B.M. 798. J. Flack, “Scripture and Revelation in Vatican II as expressed in the Con¬ stitution on Divine Revelation,” BibTheol 23 (1, ’73) 10-18. A summary of Vatican IPs constitution on divine revelation (Dei Verbum). To have spoken of and elucidated revelation in terms of dialogue rather than in terms of propositions is one of the constitution’s real advances. Its greatest achievement is undoubtedly the stress on the fact that Jesus Christ is the source of revelation and that the reality of divine revelation is to be met within him alone and not in Holy Scripture or in church tradition, which are secondary authorities receiving authority only from pointing the way to him. On the other hand, no progress has been made beyond Trent on the criticism of tradition. Also, it is unfortunate that the text says little or nothing about the continuing revelation of God in today’s world. — D.J.H. 799. P. Grech, “La nuova ermeneutica: Fuchs e Ebeling,” Augustinianum 12 (2, 72) 275-296. A review of the contributions to hermeneutic theory from W. Dilthey to M. Heidegger, R. Bultmann and H. G. Gadamer. Such a review is a necessary preamble for understanding the contribution of E. Fuchs and G. Ebeling to the new hermeneutic. This hermeneutic has become a new theological system because it has as its primary object the study of the problem of the communicability of revelation to the man of today. Language itself is already an interpretation of existence. Its primary purpose is to clarify the significance of an event. If the text is religious, then faith is a decisive factor. It is in the role that Christ must play in this faith that Fuchs and Ebeling differ from Bultmann. The paper then goes on to situate the new hermeneutic within the currents of contemporary Protestant theology and to discuss its significance for post-Vatican II Catholic theology. — S.B.M.

A short history of the foundation and development of LingBib in its first two years. — E.G. (Author.) 801. F. Hahn, “Probleme historischer Kritik,” ZeitNTWiss 63 (1-2, 72) 1-17. The most urgent unsolved problems of biblical interpretation today hinge on a critique of the historical-critical method itself. Despite the various movements of the 20th century, we remain in a position where the relationship between the message and the history and methods of its interpretation is not a matter of con¬ sensus. The necessity of a clear distinction between the text itself and the inter¬ pretative tradition can be established ; the problem is to relate the two in a satis¬ factory manner without confusing historical and theological exegesis. — G.W.M. 802. E. Hamel, “La Scrittura anima della teologia,” RassTeol 13 (6, 72) 407- 421. An Italian translation of a French article first published in Gregoriannm [§ 16-418]. 803. G. Hasenhuttl, “Dialogue between the Dogmatic Theologian and the Exegete,” Concilium 70 ( 71) 39-46. Every aspect of dogmatic theology is dependent on exegesis. But, by “sub- duing” exegesis, dogmatic theology devalued both the text and itself. Exegesis, as Barth maintained, is the sole criterion for all dogmatic propositions. So the dogmatic theologian is required to engage in dialogue with the exegete. Exegesis, however, by alienating itself from the community, made the dialogue difficult. Yet this dialogue is necessary if both the dogmatic theologian and the exegete are to bear witness to God’s word in the word of man. — S.B.M. 804. P. Kowalinski, “The Genesis of Christianity in the Views of Contem¬ porary Marxist Specialists in Religion,” Antonianum 47 (4, 72) 541-575. The radical mythological interpretation represented by R. Y. Vipper maintains that all the NT books except Rev stem from the 2nd century, are spurious and are the creation of a pious fraud. It also asserts that the affluent strata of urban society played a directive role in Christian communities from the very beginning. The moderate mythological interpretation regards Christianity as the illusion of the oppressed classes. Its point of departure is the thesis of the classic Marxists which states that Christianity began as a result of the total breakdown of the ancient world. The historical interpretation represented by A. Robertson finds the origin of Christianity in the conflict between the revolutionary messianism of Jesus and John the Baptist and the spiritual messianism of Paul. The thesis that Christianity arose as a result of social changes, independently of Jesus, has met with some positive acceptance. 272 NT GENERAL [NTA 17 (3, 73) The Marxists begin with preconceived assumptions in order to arrive at the needed facts. They erroneously minimize or eliminate the role of the individual in religious movements, ascribing creative power to the economic factor. In accepting the views of the mythological school concerning the origin of Christianity, they overrate the influence of the eastern religions. Finally, their thesis that the Evangelists lived in the 2nd century and did not know lst-century Palestine or were not eyewitnesses of the events described or did not make use of tradition based on eyewitness reports, cannot stand up to scholarly criticism. — D.J.H. 805. P. H. Lai, “ ‘Linguistische’ Theologie in frankophonen Landern,” Ling Bib 20 ( 72) 29-34. Critical review, presentation, and historical enumeration of some recent structural-exegetical works and groups in France. — E.G. 806. E. A. LaVerdiere, “Dialogue in Biblical Experience,” BibToday 65 (73) 1136-41. Within human experience, biblical man’s intercommunion with God actually shares in the structure of dialogue. In addressing these dialogues to their readers, the biblical writers were inviting all of us to join in the same experience. -D.J.H. 807. M. Limbeck, “The Exegete’s Answer,” Concilium 70 (71) 47-55. There are two reasons for caution if contemporary theology conducts its dialogue primarily with exegesis: the NT texts are not simply the gospel which the church has to proclaim accessibly, and contemporary theology must remain true to the basic broadness of mind in primitive Christian proclamation. Though exegesis is the ancilla theologiae, a fruitful dialogue between the two is necessary and will depend on the extent to which each is aware of the wishes and the possibilities of the other. — S.B.M. 808r. I. L0nning, “Kanon im Kanon” [cf. NT A 17, p. 115]. G. Wingren, “Dogmatikern Inge L0nning” [Inge L0nning as Dogmatic Theologian], NorskTeolTids 73 (3-4, 72) 217-225. — The problem outlined in L’s thesis is a recent one. But he is overly dependent on E. Kasemann and confuses Paul, Luther and modern theology. His contribution, however, as a dogmatic theologian is original and pertinent because of his concern for biblical criticism, Lutheran dogma and present-day ecumenism. Paul’s criterion (as Luther’s) was the preached gospel which effected justification. There is neither a super-Gospel (beyond the accepted four Gospels) nor is there a super-church (represented by Rome’s authority or confessional statements). The theological significance of the order of creation and of the OT need to be further explored in this work. — L.-M.D. ARTICLES] INTERPRETATION 273 809. O. Loretz, “The Church and Biblical Exegesis,” Concilium 70 (’71) 67-79. From Galileo to Vatican II the official church has regarded modern biblical exegesis with considerable scepticism, and has even rejected it. Only when persecution and suppression of individuals became impossible did the church change tactics and assert that it had always encouraged exegesis. Now the official ploy is to avoid any confrontation with exegesis. The Bible is thus replaced by an appeal to the history of the church, and in this process the OT and the NT are not counted as church history. Nevertheless, biblical scholars too must share the blame for having “withdrawn behind the wall of ‘science’ and . . . stilled their tongues.” — S.B.M. 810. R. Mackenzie, “The Self-understanding of the Exegete,” Concilium 70 (71) 11-19. The “main components of the art of exegesis” as applied to ancient texts are skills in textual criticism, linguistic competence, literary insight, apprecia¬ tion of the text and its relevance. There are, however, two differences that distinguish the biblical exegete, affecting both his method and his conclusions. The first is the existence of the canon and the implied faith in the church’s affirmation of the divine authority of Scripture. The second is the binding force or the moral imperative attributed to the word of God. — S.B.M. 811. W. A. Maier, “The Historical Critical Method As Employed In The Study Of The New Testament,” Spring fielder 35 (1, 71) 26-40. The traditional view has been that the details of the origin and historical interrelationship of the Synoptic Gospels simply cannot be definitely deter¬ mined. Underlying form-criticism are a rationalistic anti-supernaturalism, a refusal to judge fairly the written Synoptic records, and several arbitrarily established and altogether unwarranted assumptions. Since redaction-criticism presupposes and continues the procedures of form-criticism, it is subject to all the strictures directed against form-criticism. Conservative biblical scholarship categorically denounces, and wholly avoids, the exercise of content-criticism ( Sachkritik ) in the study of the NT text. — D.J.H. 812. T. H. Olbricht, “Inspiration and Biblical Criticism,” RestorQuart 15 (2, 72) 84-94. Biblical criticism is not incompatible with the affirmation that the Scriptures are the inspired word of God. The view of inspiration which sees God as inspiring biblical materials in various ways is most compatible with the biblical witness itself. In this view of inspiration, all forms of biblical criticism (textual, literary, form and redaction) “are within limits insofar as the energies are directed toward accurate description of Biblical documents. Obviously, certain naturalistic presuppositions employed by radical Biblical critics would be out¬ side the peripheries declared by the one who believes the Bible is inspired of God.”— D.J.H. [NTA 17 (3, 73) 274 NT GENERAL 813. P. Schoonenberg, “Notes of a Systematic Theologian,” Concilium 70 (71) 90-97. “Can every interpretation of Scripture provide the point of departure for further theological reflection?” is the question with which these notes deal. The systematic theologian can perhaps learn from the exegete that Jesus and the study of the New Testament are not identical with a criticism of society. Exegetes should remember that we can reach Jesus only through the interpreta¬ tion of the Christian community. The exegetical works that the systematic theologian should study first are the summaries, especially those dealing with a definite theme. — S.B.M. 814. P. Stuhlmacher, “Thesen zur Methodologie gegenwartiger Exegese,” ZeitNTWiss 63 (1-2, 72) 18-26. (1) The historical-critical method is an indispensable tool for the scientific investigation of texts, but one which must constantly be tested for its efficiency. (2) Historical criticism and the theological acknowledgment of truth must be neither identified nor separated, but rather carefully distinguished. (3) An ap¬ propriate use of the historical-critical method in the realm of theology is pos¬ sible only within the framework of a theology of the third article of faith. On the basis of these general positions there follow seven additional theses about the individual methods used in NT scholarship. These stress the necessity of a controlled and self-critical synthesis of the various methods along with a recognition of the limited capacity and accomplishments of exegesis. — G.W.M. 815. B. van Iersel, “Theology and Detailed Exegesis,” Concilium 70 (71) 80-89. “Any theological theory ought to be based on the whole of the Bible, of which the 'history of the effects’ of Scripture forms an integral part.” But the systematic theologian, no less than the exegete, can arrive at general theoretical conclusions only by a study of details. This is illustrated by an examination of Mk 1:1-15, the tradition underlying it and its editing. Thus we may think of everything that Jesus did and said as the “beginning” of the proclamation of the good news. — S.B.M. 816. G. Voss, “The Relationship between Exegesis and Dogmatic Theology,” Concilium 70 (71) 20-29. An English translation of a German article first published in 1965 [§ 10-799]. 817. R. Ware, “The Use of Scripture in Current Theology,” Concilium 70 (71) 115-128. We should pass beyond any mere “use” of the Bible or “appeal” to Scripture to an attempt to attain an “integral 'access’ to the reality of Scripture.” Modern theology has been “an historical dialectic between objectivizing and subjectivizing views of God, of faith and of the subject-matter of theology.” But it is becoming ARTICLES] INTERPRETATION 275 increasingly necessary to redefine the priority and pre-eminence of Scripture as “paradigmatic content for the experience of faith and the practice of theology.” — S.B.M. Textual Criticism 818. J. Duplacy, “L’inventaire general des citations patristiques de la Bible grecque,” VigChrist 26 (4, 72) 313-318. [Cf. § 16-441.] An alphabetical list of Greek patristic authors of the first nine centuries whose works may yield material for the Novi Testamenti graeci Editio maior critica. The names of the modern scholars responsible for studying the various authors are also given. 819. J. K. Elliott, “Phrynicus’ Influence on the Textual Tradition of the New Testament,” ZeitNTWiss 63 (1-2, 72) 133-138. The 2nd-century NT scribes were influenced by the tendency toward Attic purism, altering Koine words, orthography, genders and the like to Attic forms. The writings of the stylist Phrynicus provide many examples of Attic preferences to which variant readings in the NT correspond. Recognition of the Atticizing tendency helps determine original readings (the Koine forms). There was, however, no systematic effort on the part of scribes to change all forms to Attic ones. — G.W.M. + ' , 820. M. A. King, “Should Conservatives Abandon Textual Criticism?” BiblSac 130 (517, 73) 35-40. The Textus Receptus has no exclusive right to be considered the text that God kept as the possession of his people in early days. The arguments advanced against conservative involvement in textual criticism are not at all decisive. On the other hand, the full conservative should be impressed by the confirmation of earlier work in textual criticism by recent discoveries. Also, textual criticism has cleared Rom 8:1 from the possible implication of “works religion” in the Textus Receptus reading. To issue an NT without explanations of 1 Jn 5:7 and the account of the woman taken in adultery seems to be quite misleading. Finally, the existence of the early uncials and papyri calls for thanksgiving and attention rather than opposition. — D.J.H. 821. M. Mees, “Text- und Bibelvarianten im Paidagogos des Clemens von Alexandrien,” Augustinianum 12 (3, 72) 425-435. A study of the textual variants, particularly in connection with the scriptural citations, in Clement of Alexandria’s Paedagogos indicates the tendency of the Codex Laurentianus (F) to interpret the biblical citations in favor of theological arguments. This tendency is particularly notable in the citations of Mt 17:5 par.; Lk 14:8,10,12; Sir 34 (31) :27-28; Mk 14:20 (Mt 26:23); 1 Cor 11:3; Eph 5:2; 1 Cor 12:13.— M.A.F. 276 NT GENERAL [NTA 17 (3, 73) 8 22. M. Baillet, “Les manuscrits de la Grotte 7 de Qumran et le Nouveau Testament,” Biblica 53 (4, 72) 508-516. The readings which J. O’Callaghan [§ 17-24] suggests in identifying 7Q5 with Mk 6:52-53 and fragment 1 of 7Q6 with Mk 4:28 are impossible. The identifica¬ tion of 7Q8 with Jas 1:23-24 is open to serious doubt. The dating given in DID III (1962) should be corrected to show that 7Q1-3 are from around 100 B.C. (in any case, not after 50 B.C.) while 7Q4-18 are from between 50 B.C. and A.D. 50. The datings of these texts conflict with the datings assigned on other grounds to the NT writings with which O’Callaghan wishes to identify the fragments. 7Q3 can be identified with Jer 43 (36 MT): 28-29. Perhaps all the Cave 7 fragments may eventually be located within the Greek OT. — D .J.H. 823. P. Benoit, “Note sur les fragments grecs de la grotte 7 de Qumran,” RevBib 79 (3, 72) 321-324, plate XVII A. Examination of the MSS of 7Q5, fragment 1 of 7Q6, and 7Q8 in the Rocke¬ feller Museum in Jerusalem suggests that J. O’Callaghan’s identifications of them with various NT texts [§ 17-24] are very doubtful. Neither his readings nor his restorations are certain. — D.J.H. 824. J. Bernardi, “L’evangile de Saint Marc et la grotte 7 de Qumran,” BtudTheolRel 47 (4, 72) 453-456. When Mk 6:30-56 is placed on the grid suggested by J. O’Callaghan (that is, a minimum of 20 letters and a maximum of 23 letters per line), his identifica¬ tions of 7Q15 with Mk 6:48 and 7Q5 with Mk 6:52-53 [§ 17-24] are shown to be possible. The process does, however, involve accepting some variant readings from the MS tradition. — D.J.H. 825. G. D. Fee, “Some Dissenting Notes on 7Q5 = Mark 6:52-53,” JournBib Lit 92 (1, 73) 109-112. Besides the problems (the hitherto unsupported omission of epi ten gen and the reading of tau for delta in diaperasantes ) anticipated by J. O’Callaghan [§ 17-24] the following items should be noted. (1) On line 2 the letter following omega is an iota, not a nu. But without the nu O’Callaghan’s case evaporates. (2) The use of the identifications of other NT fragments (which should be taken with the greatest caution) to confirm the identification of 7Q5 with Mk 6:52-53 is circular. (3) The four fragments of Mk from Cave 7 are not from a single MS. One must assume that Cave 7 had four completely different scrolls of the Gospel. (4) The mathematical probabilities favoring the identification exist only if one allows several congruent improbabilities. (5) The lack of a verso side is a great misfortune, for it would have supplied the truly cor¬ roborating evidence that is needed. In summary, “O’Callaghan’s identification is perhaps possible; it seems to me to be most highly improbable.” — D.J.H. ARTICLES] TEXTUAL CRITICISM 277 826. P. Garnet, “O’Callaghan’s Fragments: Our Earliest New Testament Texts?” EvangQuart 45 (1, 73) 6-12. J. O’Callaghan’s identification of 7Q5 with Mk 6:52-53 [§ 17-24] is at best feasible, at worst impossible. Some of his identifications of the smaller fragments are plausible, and others are merely feasible. The evangelical Christian should beware of relying too heavily on these identifications. — D.J.H. 827. C. J. Hemer, “New Testament Fragments at Qumran?” TynBull 23 (72) 125-128. In fragment 1 of 7Q6 only eit of line 2 and le of line 3 are substantially legible. Since several NT texts can be fitted into this pattern, J. O’Callaghan’s identification of fragment 1 of 7Q6 with Mk 4:28 [§ 17-24] is open to serious question. The chances of coincidence are too great. The case for an essentially two-line fragment, taken in isolation, seems precarious. — D.J.H. 828. J. O’Callaghan, “jl Tim 3,16; 4,1.3 en 7Q4?” Biblica 53 (3, 72) 362-367. [Cf. § 17-24.] Clearly the paleography of 7Q4 is not the same as that of 7Q1, 7Q2 and 7Q3 , which C. H. Roberts dated about 100 B.C. Although 7Q4 has several points of contact with P. Oxy. 2618, it is almost identical paleographically with P. Oxy. 2822, which E. Lobel dated in the late 1st or early 2nd century. Allowing 27 to 31 letters per line, the text of 1 Tim 3:16 and 4:1, 3 might be reconstructed out of the 17 decipherable letters. — S.B.M. 829. J.

This article complements the two previous studies published by the author in this same journal [§§ 17-24, 828]. It deals only with the papyrus fragments treated thus far ( 7Q5; 7Q6, fragment 1; 7Q8 ; 7Q4 ) and discusses the com¬ ments made by P. Benoit [§ 17-823] and M. Baillet [§ 17-822]. The article then goes on to deal with the phonetic peculiarities of these papyri as well as their relation to the LXX, where both Benoit and Baillet hope to locate the fragments eventually. The attempt to find Jer 43:28-29 in 7Q3 is wholly un¬ acceptable. It seems possible to state, moreover, that 7Q4 contains no fragment of the LXX.— S.B.M. 830. P. Parker, “7Q5. Enthalt das Papyrusfragment 5 aus der Hohle 7 von Qumran einen Markustext?” ErbAuf 48 ( 6, 72) 467-469. If 7Q5 corresponds to any NT text, that text is Mt 1:2-3. This reconstruc¬ tion is more probable than J. O’Callaghan’s identification with Mk 6:52-53 [§ 17-24] because it omits no part of the text, the first line of the genealogy fits perfectly, there is no need to suppose the influence of the Egyptian dialect of Greek in reading T instead of D, it involves only one minor departure from the paleographers’ reading of the fragment, the Zierstil is more common for a 278 NT GENERAL [NTA 17 (3, 73) formal genealogy, and Mt was the most popular Gospel in the ancient Near East.

Concerning J. O’Callaghan’s identification of the 7Q fragments [§ 17-24] it should be noted that: a series of identifications is required for probability to emerge; it is unwise to go much beyond A.D. 50 in dating the fragments; there is an organic link, as R. de Vaux insisted, between Cave 7 and Stratum lib at Qumran; and Cave 7 contains only Greek MSS. — S.B.M. 832. W. White, Jr., “Notes on the Papyrus Fragments from Cave 7 at Qumran,” WestTheoUourn 35 (2, 73) 221-226. [Cf. § 17-432.] The “troublesome” readings in J. O’Callaghan’s identifications of Cave 7 fragments with NT texts [§ 17-24] are to be expected. Anyone who would propose an alternative identification must bear several factors in mind. (1) The alternative text must exist. (2) The lines must fit a known stichometry. (3) Lines must break regularly. (4) The orthography must be internally con¬ sistent. (5) The text must be consistent with the location where the fragments were discovered. (6) A corpus of material must be proposed. Finally, the whole of the circumstances surrounding the excavation of Cave 7 and the subsequent handling of the material must be taken into account. — D.J.H. 833. G.

Alphabetical and etymological dictionaries offer many conveniences to the user but do not get to the heart of the language. Dictionaries based on the principles of onomasiology (as opposed to semasiology), such as the Thesaurus of P. M. Roget, are much more rewarding, but they have to cope with the major problem of a principle of ordering that is not merely alphabetical, either in the whole structure or in the subsections. A survey of attempts at structure reveals the arbitrary element and the extra-linguistic basis upon which they are struc¬ tured. R. Hallig and W. von Wartburg have proposed a conceptual system for lexicography that tries to do justice to the interrelationships between language and the world. No NT lexicon has yet been constructed along such lines, but a schematic proposal is offered here which would have to be evaluated finally in the working out of the lexicon. Several examples are presented of the diversity of NT language that would be grouped under some of the headings. — G.W.M. 838. S. K. Hahm, “General Principles of Biblical Translation,” NEAJourn Theol 9 ( 72) 42-52. A good translator must render the message of the source language as a countryman of his would express it. He must take into account the total cultural framework in which the communication occurs. He must be expert in both the source language and the language Into which he is translating. The actual process of translation consists of the analysis of the text of the source language, the interpretation of the message of the text, and the determination of the closest natural equivalents. — D.J.H. 839.

The OT is scheduled to follow a year later. It follows, as will all future Duden lexicons, the ecumenical Loccum guidelines for biblical proper names and abbreviations.

Ascription is understood to be the fairly clearly structured form used when someone ascribes a condition to a person or to a people because of a relationship which the person or group exhibits. Its use in the NT is derived from the OT, which contains numerous examples. The elements of the form are the ascriptive word, the object of the ascription, reasons (positive and/or negative) for the ascription, and a commentary. And depending on the presence of these elements, ascriptions may be simple, intermediate or complete. The most common types are woes (ouai), eulogies (eulogetos or eulogemenos) and beatitudes ( makarios ). All three types are found in the NT.

There are instances in Josephus, Philo and the LXX where sabbata is defi¬ nitely a singular noun. This is best explained as the transcription of the Aramaic sabbata where the short a-vowel of the second syllable was retained and taw was transliterated with tau rather than theta.

Barth’s, D. de Rougemont’s) have been influenced by A. Nygren’s. This essay attempts to demonstrate that the Greek Bible does not support the common assumption that agape should be defined in a way that stands in contrast to ordinary human love.

Analysis of their importance must take into account the situation of the speaker and the reaction of the listener.

B’s important study puts Jesus’ use of amen within a larger context ARTICLES] GOSPELS 283 of similar expressions in Hellenistic- Jewish apocalyptic literature, thus relativiz- ing its distinctiveness. His identification of the amen as an oath formula charac¬ teristic of apocalyptic speech is open to question, but he is on better ground in connecting it with the LXX formulas for prophetic messages (especially in Ezek). The link between this material and the NT is not to be found in apocalyp¬ tic, but in the worship of the Hellenistic synagogues and the early Hellenistic- Jewish and Gentile-Christian churches. The contribution of the Gospels them¬ selves to the development of the amen-iornm\\a should also be taken into account. — J.R.M. 853. K. Berger, “Zur Geschichte der Einleitungsformel ‘Amen, ich sage euch,’ ” ZeitNTWiss 63 (1-2, 72) 45-75. An extensive investigation of OT and NT apocrypha shows that the formula “Amen, I say to you” and its predecessors in the tradition have a high degree of consistency and stability in both form and function. (1) As for whether or not there are Jewish amen-sayings independent of NT usage, an examination of the sayings in the Testament of Abraham reveals that these are independent tra¬ dition-historical amen-sayings that can contribute to understanding the apocalyp¬ tic background of the form. (2) In the LXX the use of the first person singular with verbs of speaking is frequent in God’s or a prophet’s speech ; it often stresses the authority of the speaker; in the genre of testament it is commonly used to introduce paraenesis. Of the many uses in Jewish apocryphal and early Christian literature, notably in Paul, those introducing paraenetic and eschatological say¬ ings offer significant parallels to the Gospel sayings. Jubilees 35.6 offers an example of the form used to introduce a saying about the speaker’s own fate. (3) Especially frequent are sayings in which the form legitimizes the speaker’s witness to knowledge obtained by revelation. (4) The form is also used in pronouncements of judgment. (5) The consistency of the form and function of amen-sayings and related forms in extracanonical early Christian literature legit¬ imizes the investigation of such sources to throw light on the NT usage. — G.W.M. * 854. D. Daube, “Responsibilities of Master and Disciples in the Gospels,” NTStud 19 (1, 72) 1-15. The issue of the responsibility of a master and his disciples in the outside world for one another’s conduct was a common one in antiquity, in classical and Jewish literature alike. The Evangelists are aware of this issue in the case of Jesus and his disciples. In three instances Jesus is challenged to explain the conduct of his disciples: the question of fasting, plucking corn on the Sabbath, and eating with unwashed hands. A fourth case is essentially analogous, the entry into Jerusalem, where a political figure is held accountable for the conduct of his partisans. In the incident of the meal at the house of the publican, the disci¬ ples are challenged to defend the objectionable behavior of their master. Though the various Evangelists adapt these stories to their special aims, they all show 284 GOSPELS [NTA 17 (3, 73) a sophisticated awareness of the issue of such responsibility, and the stories all have a common basic pattern. — G.W.M. 855.

The tragic polarization between those who think that everything took place exactly as it is recorded in the Gospels and those who wish to defend the Christian religion by adopting an attitude of skepticism or agnosticism about the historical truth of the Gospels is regrettable. A possible way out may be found in tracing the origins and growth of the Gospel traditions by a careful literary analysis of the texts we now possess. — D.J.H. 856. J. McHugh, “The Origins and Growth of the Gospel Traditions. II: Two Nature Miracles/’ ClerRev 58 (2, 73) 83-95. [Cf. § 17-880.] It is not difficult to believe that a storm stopped, as it were miraculously, when Jesus prayed (Mt 8:23-27; Mk 9:35-41; Lk 8:22-25), or that on another occasion the disciples crossed the lake in safety against a heavy wind while Jesus was walking by the shore (Mt 14:22-33; Mk 6:45-52; Jn 6:16-21). The point is that both of these happenings seem to the Evangelists signal proofs of divine providence caring for them. The event behind the Gospel story is not irrelevant ; it alone guarantees the truth of our conviction that God will bring us safely home. — D.J.H. 857r. H.

This is a substantial piece of research. In some in¬ stances, however, Merkel could have gone further. In his discussion of the dis¬ crepancy between the Markan (15:25) and the Johannine (19:14) chronology of Jesus’ crucifixion, not only Eusebius but also Ammonius of Alexandria before him suggested that copyists confused the Greek numerals gamma and gabex (r= six). His discussion of allegory might have called attention to the 7th- century P.

Sweet, “A Saying, a Parable, a Miracle,” Theology 76 (633, 73) 125-133. The “word spoken in Christ” is not legislative so much as questioning, illumi¬ nating, liberating, life-giving. The sayings, however legal-looking, and the miracle-stories, however factual-looking, are alike parabolic. The point can be illustrated by detailed analyses of the saying on divorce (Mk 10:11-12), the Parable of the Lost Sheep (Lk 15:1-7; Mt 18:12-14) and the wedding at Cana (Jn 2:1-11).

Bammel, “Christus Parricida,” VigChrist 26 (4, ’72) 259-262. In the Altercatio Simonis et Theophili 2.4 Jesus is compared to Absalom, who is described as a parricide. The Huldreich version of the Toledoth Jeshu records that “Jesus slew his father.” Learning of his illegitimacy, he makes his mother confess her guilt and kills his father subsequently. While this is probably a vari¬ ation of the story of the seduction of Mary by Panthera (Origen, Contra Celsum 1.32), the parallel in the Altercatio shows that the trait of picturing Jesus as a parricide is neither isolated nor late. — D.J.H. 861. R. F. Berkey, “Realized Eschatology and the Post-Bultmannians,” .Exp Times 84 (3, 72) 72-77. A wing of the Bultmann school has moved away from insistence upon the gap between the historical Jesus (with its proclamation of a future kingdom) and the kerygma of the early church (where the Jesus of history was proclaimed as the eschatological event). But if there are significant lines of continuity here, some form of realized eschatology would seem implicitly demanded of the historical career of Jesus. Yet there appears to be a very consistent and yet uncalled-for reluctance on the part of the post-Bultmannians (e.g. H. Conzelmann, E. Fuchs, G. Bornkamm and E. Kasemann) to state a position that would allow explicit acceptance of even a partially realized eschatology in Jesus’ self-understanding. —D.J.H. 862. E.

[Cf. § 17-462.] The Fourth Gospel presents a picture of Jesus different from that in the Synoptics. As the nature of John’s Gospel requires, Jesus does not suffer the kenosis on the cross.

Bultmann sought to avoid the crisis, but he left him¬ self open to attack because for him critical inquiry and the NT proclamation converge on the historical fact of Jesus’ having “been there.” Convinced that the mere fact of Jesus’ having been there is insufficient as a basis for the claim that the proclamation is historically rooted in Jesus, E. Kasemann has in fact revealed that the NT proclamation which intends to be bound by the historical Jesus produces its own Jesus-figures precisely where the intention is most con¬ sistently pursued, namely in the Gospels. By surrendering the claim of historicity and resolving the Christ-proclamation into an anthropology, H. Braun says that what occurred around Jesus is relative and achieves absolute significance only because of its recurrence in the event of the believer’s self-understanding. The reason for the identity crisis is our double inheritance: (1) the reflective critical understanding which we inherited from Greece and (2) the Christian faith which is a product of the suggestive-responsive, experiential understand¬ ing of our Hellenistic heritage, a Hellenism characterized by substantial Judaic elements. NT scholarship cannot escape from historical criticism as its funda¬ mental methodology. “The New Testament scholar is compelled to abandon also to the ‘flames’ of critical scrutiny the New Testament understanding that faith is grounded in the history of Jesus as the event of salvation. What is devoured by the flames is not merely the christos kata sarka, but the New Testament procla¬ mation that his history is the event of salvation on which faith is grounded.” — D.J.H. 864. J. Breuss, “Das ‘Leben Jesu’ von David Friedrich Strauss und die Hegelsche Philosophic,” FreibZeitPhilTheol 19 (2-3, 72) 389-409. The Hegelian influence on Strauss is plain as day, for he wanted to raise the Gospels from the stage of image (representation) to that of idea, or from faith to knowledge according to the Hegelian scheme of thesis, antithesis and synthesis. Strauss interpreted Hegel’s philosophy monistically. On the person and history of Jesus the philosopher’s views were ambiguous and occasioned the formation of three different interpretations. One school held that all is historical, a second that part is historical, and the third that the historicity of the Gospels depends on historical research and not on the idea. Strauss’s Life of Jesus is a rejection, not of Hegel, but, as he explicitly states, of the contemporary Hegelian school which maintained that history follows from the truth of the ideas. — J.J.C. 865r.

The inquiry is a mere hardening of a given position against that of the Bultmannian school. The much- needed discussion of the presuppositions of the Bultmannian interpretation does not occur. On the question whether Jesus considered himself the Messiah, “noth¬ ing is disclosed which an uncritical but imaginative reader of the NT could not have visualized.” — D.J.H. 866. H. Kung, “Die Gretchenfrage des christlichen Glaubens? Systematische Uberlegungen zum neutestamentlichen Wunder,” TheolQuart 152 ( 3, 72) 214-223. The NT miracle stories are not concerned with showing Jesus as a powerful healer who cures all infirmities of men. On the other hand, they should not be interpreted in a purely spiritual sense. The good news of the kingdom of God, preached by Jesus, is directed to the whole man in his spiritual and corporeal existence and to all men both weak and strong. Jesus not only proclaimed the good news but also intervened in the spheres of sickness and injustice. He had both the authority of preaching and the gift of healing. His acts of power were rejected by some as magic, but for others they mediated the impression of an encounter with divine power: the kingdom of God which consists not only in pardon and conversion, but also in the freeing of the body and in the transforma¬ tion and perfection of the world. — E. J.K. 867. O. Kuss, “ ‘Bruder Jesus.’ Zur ‘Heimholung’ des Jesus von Nazareth in das Judentum,” MiinchTheolZeit 23 ( 3, 72 ) 284-296. Some recent Jewish scholars (S. Ben-Chorin, D. Flusser and E. Lessing) emphasize the Jewishness of Jesus to the extent that they would welcome him back into Judaism as a long-lost brother who has been misrepresented for cen¬ turies. In restoring the true historical picture of the man, his qualities which are non-Jewish or distinctively Christian are excised from the Gospels as myths, pious exaggerations or unfounded traditions. — J.J.C. 868. P. C. Landucci, “Gesu veramente taumaturgo, risorto, sacramentato,” P alCler 52 (5, 73) 260-274. A recent article by L. Sabourin on the miracles of Jesus [§ 15-791] seems not only to cast doubt on the veracity of their narratives but even to forget that these narratives are divinely inspired and hence divinely true. The article forgets the distinction between the motives of credibility and the faith. Another article by A. Gesche [§ 16-511] speaks of a meta-historical nature of the resurrection, forget¬ ting that in the resurrection the whole fact is strictly proved according to the normal mode of proving historical fact. There is direct evidence of unassailable witness for both the terminus a quo (the death and burial) and the terminus ad quern (Lk 24:29-43). Other recent articles on the Eucharistic presence obscure the doctrine of Trent, are but doctrinal adventures following in the footsteps of foreign theologians, especially the Germans. For some the aggiornamento means turning one’s back methodically on the Angelic Doctor. — S.B.M. [NTA 17 (3, 73) 288 GOSPELS 869. R. Pesch, “Zur theologischen Bedeutung der “Machttaten’ Jesu.

Jesus’ acts of power were interpreted by him as effected through God’s might and inserted by him within the scope of his mission: the eschatological gathering of Israel in view of the nearness of the kingdom of God. The theological signifi¬ cance of these acts, therefore, cannot be attained by considering them in isolation. Neither can they be assessed properly merely from the interpretation given by Jesus, but only in an evaluation of the charismatic work of Jesus within his whole mission. A discussion of the problem of the miracle stories involves a dis¬ cussion of the reality and truth of revelation and a discussion of revelation in the whole of Jesus’ life and death — a discussion, moreover, which takes seriously, as its field, the dialogue character of revelation involving speaker and hearers. Jesus’ miracles and their interpretation by him, his followers and opponents, as well as the Christologically motivated miracle stories (which are confessional statements of primitive Christian faith), belong in the historical, concrete under¬ standing of revelation as partial aspects of the process of revelation. — E.J.K. 870r.

Fuller, JournRel 53 (2, 73) 261-262. — This book is by no means an exercise in popular journalism, but the fruit of much painstaking research and at the same time eminently readable. The author’s attempt to interpret Mt 19:12 in its present context ignores the fact that this saying is a Matthean insertion into the Markan Vorlage. His use of the Pastorals manifests an almost funda¬ mentalist desire to get the whole of the Bible on his side. It also leads him to prefer inferior textual readings at Lk 1:34 and Mt 1:16 and to postulate a post- Lukan insertion at Lk 3:23. The question of Jesus’ matrimonial status is not only unanswerable, but evidently irrelevant to faith; otherwise the Gospel tra¬ dition would have told us about it. “Personally, I am still persuaded that Jesus was probably a celibate.” In view of the “military celibacy” at Qumran, celibacy during his public ministry would seem consistent with Jesus’ eschatol¬ ogy. — D.J.H. 871. K. Schafer, “Jesus on God,” Concilium 76 (72) 58-66. It was Jesus’ talk about God (for instance, his assertion that the time of joy and freedom, the time of God, had arrived) that cost him his life. The indirect and practical nature of Jesus’ discourse about God can be grasped by trying to establish a model of communication and linguistic performance which “starts from the fact that Jesus’ talk about God is unified activity conditioned by several factors.” — D.J.H. 872. F.-J. Steinmetz, “Jungfrauengeburt — Wunderglaube und Glaube,” Orientierung 37 (3, 73) 31-34. In Heb 7:3 Christ is compared with Melchizedek, who “is without father or mother or genealogy.” If Melchizedek’s and Jesus’ origins are described there ARTICLES] JESUS 289 in theological rather than biological terms, cannot this also be the case in the infancy narratives of Mt and Lk? The theological point made by these accounts is that what makes Jesus the redeemer and savior comes not from the power of man but from the grace of God, from the Holy Spirit. The virgin birth should be interpreted more as sign or wonder than as miracle. — D.J.H. 873. H. Wansbrough, “The Mission of Jesus. Ill: Jesus and His Future,” ClerRev 57 (12, 72) 923-933. [Cf. § 17-480.] Jesus’ conception of his future role is expressed chiefly by means of two OT figures, the Suffering Servant of 2 Isa and the Son of Man of Dan 7. “He reached his human concept of his mission by meditation on and prophetic insight into the scriptures in which the will of his Father was expressed and saw it to be the fulfillment of these two separate but interlinked prophecies.” — D.J.H.

If Jesus had been crucified in a similar fashion, “his contorted muscles probably would have gen¬ erated spasmodic contractions (tetanization) and rigid cramps would eventually permeate the diaphragm and lungs so as to prohibit inhalation and exhalation. Jesus could have died after six hours.” — D.J.H. 875. J. G. Sobosan, “The Trial of Jesus,” J ournEcumStud 10 (1, 73) 70-93. The Gospels’ picture of Pilate as a weak but kindly man runs counter to what we know of him from other sources. Also, the behavior attributed to the Jewish authorities in these accounts is hard to explain. It is difficult to decide the degree of credibility that is to be assigned to the accounts of the trial of Jesus before the Sanhedrin. At any rate, the trial in which Jesus was condemned to die on the cross was not formally a trial before a Jewish court but before a Roman one. This can be seen from the fact that the sentence was carried out under Roman jurisdiction and by Roman officials and from the method of execution by crucifixion. The “crowd” may actually have been the followers of Barabbas, but later the term was understood as symbolizing the Jewish people as a whole. In the Gospels there is an increasing tendency to play down the Roman involvement and to magnify that of the Jews. — D.J.H. The Resurrection 876. E.

[Cf. § 17-862.] 290 GOSPELS [NTA 17 (3, 73) From the NT accounts it is clear that after the resurrection Jesus appeared in bodily form to his disciples and that they recognized him as the Jesus of Naza¬ reth who had been writh them as their leader. At the same time they perceived that his body, though changed, was that which had been in the empty tomb. -JJ.c. 877. E. Charpentier, “Christ est ressuscite !” Cahiers £vangile 54 (3, ’73) 3-75. After a consideration of human life according to the OT and a brief discussion of the views of Jesus and his contemporaries on the resurrection, there is an ex¬ tensive analysis of the NT texts pertinent to the resurrection along with a con¬ cluding attempt at synthesis. Interspersed throughout the text are discussions of matters such as the soul in the OT, the resurrection of Christ as realization or as promise, and resurrection and exaltation. — D.J.H. 878r. X.

At times he overstresses differences between NT writers and speaks of another Christology, another kind of history. Limiting the historical to what can be verified, he correctly observes that all testimony is subjective and one needs to isolate the focal point, i.e. the event, from its interpre¬ tations. One major and surprising void is the absence of a thorough treatment of how the Fathers and councils interpreted the resurrection. The review considers at some length two basic issues. One is the concept of the risen body. Some surprising statements about the constitution of a body which were made in the first edition were changed in the second edition, but the writer still seems haunted by the fear that the reader may understand the resurrection as simply the reanimation of a corpse. The second point concerns the mystery of the resurrection. The risen Christ is perceived only by faith. At the same time the disciples recognized the continuity between the body of Jesus of Nazareth and that of the risen Savior. Hence any theory based upon modern biology which would reduce the resurrection to a mere immortality would not do justice to the Gospel texts. — JJ.C. 879r. - , Idem. G. Lafont, “L’Hermeneutique de la Resurrection. Reaction a une tentative de Xavier Leon-Dufour,” ScriptTheol 3 (2, 71) 253-300. — The study is evaluated from the viewpoint of systematic theology, and the critique concentrates upon two concepts — that of history and that of body. It is a mistake to limit the notion of the historical to that which is verifiable, and L-D too sharply opposes history and science on the one hand to faith and reality on the other. Furthermore, three ARTICLES] RESURRECTION 291 objections which he raises against the traditional interpretation of the resurrec¬ tion and which he bases on his concept of body are not compelling. (1) The resurrection, while not adequately explained as the reanimation of a corpse, nevertheless contains this as an essential element. (2) Hellenistic dualistic anthropology is to be rejected, but the Fathers and councils have correctly assumed that there are two principles in man. (3) The connection between the body of Christ and the universe needs further study, but even before the resur¬ rection Jesus’ body had a special relation to the universe.

Ill: The Resurrection,” ClerRev 58 (3, ’73) 162-175. [Cf. §§ 17-855—856.] The evidence of the Gospels themselves compels us to abandon the commonly held biography of the risen Lord. Yet R. Bultmann’s interpretation of the resur¬ rection as the mythological expression of a spiritual truth gives no explanation of why the apostles were led to think that Jesus was victor in death. Only the conviction that Jesus was alive as a fully human person can account for the behavior of the disciples on the first Easter. The tomb had to be empty, unless we believe that the material body is not an essential part of human nature (though all evidence is to the contrary). — D.J.H. Synoptics 881. J. N. Aletti, “Probleme synoptique et theorie des permutations,” RechSci Rel 60 (4, ’72) 575-594. This explanation of L. Frey’s Analyse ordinate des evangiles synoptiques (1969) praises his application of mathematical method to the literary problem of pericope-order in the Synoptics and highlights the contribution such a method can make toward identifying sources used by the individual Evangelists. F’s study focuses on the significance of “inversions” in the order of passages or blocks in each Evangelist for reconstructing the possible sources behind the text. Inversion, however, exists at levels other than blocks, and this suggests the neces¬ sity of applying exegetical method too in order to overcome the limitations of mathematics. Viewing the work of A. Gaboury from the perspective of F’s research, it is clear that G’s failure to note that a pericope itself is composite (1) caused him to fail to analyze doublets seriously and (2) deprived him of a knowledge of the mechanism of inversions and intra-discursive omissions in the texts. In addition, since his analysis of pericopes is global, his exegesis operates only at the level of literary analysis. The investigation of pericope-order therefore must proceed in microscopic as well as macroscopic fashion. — J.P. 882. K. Berger, “Materialen zu Form und tlberlieferungsgeschichte neutesta- mentlicher Gleichnisse,” NovTest 15 (1, ’73) 1-37. (1) The Testament of Job 18.6-8 contains a parable close in function, form and [NTA 17 (3, 73) 292 GOSPELS tendency to those of Mt 13:44-46, but the twofold use of kleronomein recalls Mk 10:29 f., which has structural affinity with Testament of Job 4.5-9. Many NT texts show plainly that conversion was the Sits im Leben for the theme of the renunciation of possessions, as in parts of Judaism. (2) The parable of Nathan (2 Sam 12:1-7), in which the biblical text places the accent on love, is given different treatments in later sources, which shorten it. A literary connection among them is unlikely; they result from the same tendencies of interpretation. NT influence on these interpretations is unlikely. (3) Many NT parables are modeled on the law-dispute stories. (4) The parables in Acts of Philip illustrate the tendency of going from doctrinal to ethical considerations; something similar can be seen in 1 Cor 9:7; 2 Tim 2:4-6. In the first series in the Acts of Philip and in 1 Cor tis introduces the parables. (5) 1 Cor 9:9b and Testament of Job Z7.6 flow from the Wisdom tradition and Hellenistic popular philosophy. (6) Steadfastness in prayer, as in Lk 18:1-8 and Hernias, Vision 3. 3. 1-2, is from the apocalyptic tradition, which is reduced to parable-form in Lk. (7) Often the uncanonical material is not to be explained simply as a copy of the canonical material but as a changed expression from the background of the same parable material. The form of the parable, like the collections of them, enjoyed a special stability. The question of possible Christian (or dominical) originality cannot be decided by the form. The point of the parable is decisive. — J.O’R. 883. K. Berger, “Die sog. ‘Satze heiligen Rechts’ im N.T. Ihre Funktion und ihr Sitz im Leben, ! ” TheolZeit 28 (5, 72) 305-330. The sayings which E. Kasemann designated as “sentences of holy law” are actually conditional relative clauses of wisdom origin having nothing to do with legal norms. To determine their original Sits im Leben, they must be isolated and analyzed with respect to their formal characteristics. They occur frequently in connection with fixed sentence introductions such as amen formulas and beatitudes. Beatitudes appear characteristically at the con¬ clusion of apocalypses and with reference to the experience of new converts. The common factor is the high value placed upon the receiving and passing on of revelation. When a beatitude used in this way is combined with a conditional relative clause, the latter shifts the subject from second to third person (“every¬ one who . . .”), thus generalizing the beatitude’s application (e.g. in Joseph and Asenath 16). Similarly, conditional relative clauses can be linked to confessions of faith, where again a revelation must be received and kept. Thus the Sits im Leben of at least some of the conditional relative clauses (especially those with a future apodosis) was the initial instruction of converts in the Gentile mission. Those with a present apodosis are a special class empha¬ sizing the criteria for distinguishing the just from the unjust. — J.R.M. 884. J. F. Bouhours, “Une etude de l’ordonnance de la triple tradition,” Rech SciRel 60 (4, 72) 595-614. This study of the triple tradition in Mt 3:21 — 25:46; Mk 1:1 — 13:35; Lk 3:1 ARTICLES] SYNOPTICS 293 — 21:38 plus 22:25-28 is based on the hypothesis that the individual Synoptics never overturned the order of material in the sources at their disposal. Accepting L. Frey’s identification of 428 blocks in the Synoptic Gospels (excluding the infancy and passion narratives) — 96 of which represent the triple tradition, it is possible according to Frey’s principles of “segmentation” to “regroup” the 96 blocks into 60 units, the numeration of which is based on the Markan sequence only for convenience. Two tables present the content and verse references for these units. Minute examination of the Synoptics two at a time and a mathematical graph¬ ing of these results suggest all the possible and impossible sequences in the texts, and also points to the probable composition of the documents used by them as sources. Essentially the investigation confirms Frey’s methodology and research as well as A. Gaboury’s division of the Synoptics into two parts, C and D. In addition, certain modifications of Gaboury’s sources A1, A2 and B are suggested by the graphs, and interestingly enough Gaboury himself appears to be moving in this direction in his own fashion. Such a study of sequences can therefore prove enlightening for the question of the genesis of the Gospels. — J.P. 885. H.

H. Frankemolle, “Hat Jesus sich selbst verkiindet? Christolo'gische Implikationen in den vormarkinischen Parabeln,” BibLeb 13 (3, 72) 184- 207. In the similitudes (cf. esp. Mk 4:26-29 and 30-32) Jesus spoke not of himself but of God’s rule and kingdom. But, contrary to this generally held position of A. Julicher, Jesus does indeed speak of himself in the pre-Markan (from the Aramaic-speaking community) parables of the sower (Mk 4:3-8) and of the killing of the vineyard-owner’s son (Mk 12:1-12). Jesus actually reveals himself in the parables (against E. Fuchs), which he used as apt means for revealing his claims and the charismatic-prophetic exousia on which they were based. The parabolic literary form also exercised significant influence on Mark’s theology, for these two parables (4:3-8; 12:1-12) contain the kernel of the “mystery theory” developed by Mark and by means of which, despite the preva¬ lent post-Easter theologia gloriae atmosphere of the Hellenistic communities, he was able to transmit this valuable point of continuity with the preaching of Jesus. — R.J.D. 887. W. Harnisch, “Die Ironie als Stilmittel in Gleichnissen Jesu,” Evang Theol 32 (5, 72) 421-436. After reference to contemporary studies of irony (especially by B. Allemann), Kafka’s anecdote about the man trying to find the train station is discussed, fol- 294 GOSPELS [NTA 17 (3, 73) lowing H. Politzer’s study. The everydayness of the story is broken by the police¬ man’s counter-question and imperative (“Give it up”) in the familiar (Du) ; the anecdote is seen as a parable of the self-estrangement of human existence, and the inconceivable appears as negative epiphany. Ironic elements include the man’s hopefulness of finding a watchman (Schutzmann) . Against Politzer’s discussion of Jesus’ parables (and with recent parable studies), these parables are realistic; indeed they force upon us a view of alienated reality, and several contain a moment of reversal which is hardly as schematic as Politzer supposes. L. Ragaz ( Die Gleichnisse Jesu, 1971) speaks of the “holy irony” in the parables, serving to give an ironic cloak to pedagogical interests, an interpretation also presented by H. Clavier, who speaks of potent “dissimulation” as the key figure of speech. His analysis of irony in the image part of parables is more successful than for entire parables. E. Fuchs has also highlighted ironic elements. Luke 18:1-8 is studied to identify irony, and then to check L. Ragaz and H. Clavier’s assertion that irony is used for pedagogic purposes ; vv. 2-5 are accepted as the true core of the parable. The comic aspect of the judge’s response is a type of irony; the irony is related to Jesus’ sympathy for the oppressed. That which happens as a chance occurrence in the image part is to be taken seriously as a rule in the material part, and forms part of the eschatological proclamation of the kingdom. The application in vv. 6-8a substantiates this, and points to the context of Jesus’ career as necessary to understand the parable’s dynamics. Pedagogically, we see the distancing of irony: in the parable one must move from indirect address to accepting the parable as personal address which saves him. — W.G.D. 888. N. P. Hurley, “Jesus’ Parables as Strategic Fiction,” RevRel 31 (5, ’72) 756-760. Unless one comprehends that Jesus’ teaching involved a complete reversal of the values of contemporary society, the need for a stratagem such as the parable form will be missed. Knowing all that was in man, Jesus spoke uniquely in “pic¬ ture-language” in order to reveal and, in the case of his enemies, to conceal. — D.J.H. 889. H.-J. Klauck, “Neue Beitrage zur Gleichnisforschung,” BibLeb 13 (3, 72) 214-230. G. Eichholz, steering a course between the historical (J. Jeremias) and the existential (E. Fuchs and E. Jungel), stresses the drama-like character of the parables and the way the listener is taken up into the play. K.-P. Jorns, a disciple of Jeremias, presents the similitudes as answers to the problem of talking about God. A. Weiser provides an unusually perceptive review of methodological prob¬ lems and careful use of the entire storehouse of modern historical-critical research tools. D. O. Via analyzes the parables as real works of art, but the analysis is limited by an excessively existential (Bultmannian) method of interpretation. E. Giittgemanns combines form criticism and linguistics in a structuralist approach. These works show how much the question of method in NT exegesis, espe- ARTICLES] SYNOPTICS 295 dally on the parables, is characterized by a pluralism which should make us at least suspicious of simple, clear-cut solutions. — R.J.D. 890. X. Leon-Dufour, “Autour de la question synoptique,” RechSciRel 60 (4, 72) 491-518. A survey of recent literature on the Synoptic problem can be organized around two concerns: the hypotheses about the literary relationship among the Synop¬ tics, and the methods underlying the hypotheses. While some scholars hold to an immediate interrelationship among the Synoptics (W. R. Farmer, R. Morgen- thaler, possibly E. P. Sanders), others hold to a mediate interrelationship via pre-Synoptic documents (the “Q” supporters, A. Gaboury, M.-fi. Boismard). The methods by which the various conclusions were reached involve two basic orientations: literary analysis of the text (Sanders, Boismard) and consideration of the order of sequence of pericopes (K. Lachmann, Sanders, Gaboury, B. de Solages, Morgenthaler, and L. Frey). The most insightful among these authors are Gaboury, Boismard, and Frey, who open new horizons for researchers in the area. — J.P. 891. X. Leon-Dufour, “Synopses evangeliques,” RechSciRel 60 (4, 72) 615- 632. The synopses of L. Deiss, K. Aland, and P. Benoit and M.-fi. Boismard are reviewed and evaluated from seven perspectives with specific comments regard¬ ing key elements highly desirable in a good synopsis. (1) A sound Greek text should be presented, but only the “synoptic” sections require critical apparatus. Translations should mirror the Greek faithfully and therefore need frequent revision. (2) Order in a synopsis should reflect the sequence proper to each Gospel as well as the “synoptic condition” of each pericope (by using variation in type face, colors, abbreviations, symbols, etc.). (3) Distribution of texts should be based on “form” indicators, and not on content alone. Titles of indi¬ vidual sections should reflect the particularity of each Evangelist and ought not to be generalized to cover all three Synoptics. (4) Parallel texts should manifest relationships (or lack of them) with regard to content as well as context. (5) Extrabiblical references should be kept to a minimum. (6) The Fourth Gospel should be reported only in its “synoptic” relationships. The whole Gospel could be printed in sequence in an appendix. (7) Colors are helpful but frequently reflect the scholarly assumptions of the author. [Leon-Dufour’s own color scheme is preferred here as most neutral.] By assigning the primary colors to each Synoptic Gospel, combinations of colors (reflecting similarities of text) produce recognizable colors (e.g. Mk-blue and Lk-yellow become green where the two texts are similar). — J.P. 892.

[Cf. § 17-471.] 296 GOSPELS [NTA 17 (3, 73) While the “lightning” of 2 Baruch 53.8 describes the appearance of the earthly- nationalistic messiah, the element of “suddenness” is taken over from the Son- of-Man tradition. Several texts in Josephus’ War suggest that in A.D. 70 the intertwining of the Son-of-David and Son-of-Man concepts was important in encouraging Jewish activism. In the second revolt Akiba (cf. bHag 14a and bSanh 38b) ascribed to the Son of David the prerogatives of the Son of Man according to Dan 7. Several characteristics of the Son of David in rabbinic liter¬ ature (sudden appearance, hiddenness, existence before creation, removal or dis¬ appearance) are clearly the result of further influence on the Son-of-David tra¬ dition by the Son-of-Man tradition. Rabbi Alexandrai ( ca . 270) explicitly identified the Son of Man in Dan 7:13-14 with the Son of David. The long history of the interweaving of Son of Man and Son of David means that we cannot speak of the Son of Man in Jesus’ time as simply a pre-existent heavenly being and that we must ask where Jesus’ own understanding of the concept stands upon the path of development. — D.J.H. 893. N. Perrin, “The Evangelist as Author: Reflections on Method in the Study and Interpretation of the Synoptic Gospels and Acts,” Bib Res 17 (’72) 5-18. Redaction-criticism and its ramifications now demand careful attention to critical methodology. The era of source-criticism (mid-19th century to ca. 1945) viewed the Evangelists as chroniclers of the ministry of Jesus and, for Luke- Acts, of the history of the early church. Then form-critics stressed their activity as collectors and editors of traditional material, responding to community forces. “Luke” as author of the Gospel supposedly worked with “sources,” but as author of Acts exerted much more of a stylistic and formative influence (M. Dibelius). E. Haenchen’s commentary on Acts subsequently presents the three accounts of Paul’s conversion as illustrating Luke’s differing literary purposes. Redaction-critics emphasize similar freedom and creativity in the Evangelists’ work. In Lk 3:21-22, for example, the Baptism of Jesus (from Mk 1:9-11) has become the Descent of the Spirit, and Acts 2:1-13 represents the descent of the Spirit on the church at Pentecost also in the images of baptism. Additional paral¬ lels in structure can be cited (compare Lk 9:51 with Acts 19:21). General agreement that the Evangelists are genuine authors writing themati¬ cally and for specific purposes means now that general literary criticism must be applied in a specifically appropriate way to the Synoptic Gospels and Acts. The following concerns are necessary: (1) NT textual and language criticism; (2) source-criticism; (3) historical contexts (e.g. Mark’s rejection of a false Chris- tology and a false notion of discipleship) ; (4) form-criticism (traditional focus on units plus emphasis upon the creativity of the Evangelists) ; (5) redaction criticism (especially as it moves on now from emphasis on the arrangement of traditions) ; (6) composition and structure as a whole (internal devices available to the Hellenistic author: summary reports, formula quotations, geographical references, and the like) ; (7) protagonists and plot (each Gospel has its own ARTICLES] SYNOPTICS 297 set, and the cast of characters functions differently in each Gospel) ; (8) pre¬ sentation of themes (e.g. in Matthew, obedience to revelation). — W.G.D. 894.

This article further pursues the methodology of The Tendencies of the Synop¬ tic Tradition (1969). Concentrating on three passages in the triple tradition (Mk 10:17-31 parr.; 2:23-28 parr.; 1:29-31 parr.), which evince a high percentage of verbatim agreement, four observations can be made. (1) Mk has secondary elements in each passage relative to Mt/Lk, and therefore cannot be their source. (2) Lk, having the fewest redactional elements, seems to preserve a more ancient version of the tradition. (3) In the three passages there are significant points at which each Gospel agrees with another against the third. (4) Lk cannot be con¬ sidered the most ancient version in toto. Three types of solution to the Synoptic problem are suggested by this study. (1) The second Evangelist copied the oldest but used independent and over¬ lapping traditions ; the third copied the first and second, and also used indepen¬ dent and overlapping traditions. (2) There is an t/r-Gospel behind all the Evan¬ gelists. (3) The second and third used one form of Gospel, other than any we now know, plus independent traditions. The best answer is the hypothesis of an I/r-Gospel, or dependence of Lk in relation to Mt. In any case the sources over¬ lap. — J.P. 895. F. Stagg, “Salvation in Synoptic Tradition,” RevExp 69 (3, 72) 355-367. There is no evidence in the Synoptics that Jesus viewed sin as of such a nature that it could be transmitted from one generation to another or that one could be guilty of other than his own sin. Furthermore, Jesus is depicted as forgiving sin on the simple basis of man’s willingness to receive it. Finally, for¬ giveness and fellowship with God were offered by Jesus and enjoyed with him before his death. The cross finds its central place within the biblical witness when we see it “as both a particular event at Golgotha and as belonging eternally to the nature of God.” — D.J.H. 896r. A.

Crossan, JournBibLit 92 (1, 73) 136-137. — In general, the redactional work is very persuasive, but on the level of tradition no use or even mention is made of the Gospel of Thomas. It is on the level of the original content, meaning and function of these parables that the greatest reservations arise. The thesis does not do justice to the possibility of an original thematic unity in the servant parables of Jesus — the master-servant relationship at a moment of critical reckon¬ ing. — D.J.H.

Kingsbury, “Matthew’s Redefinition of the Gospel,” Dialog 12 (1, 73) 32-37. For the historical Jesus the “good news” of the gospel pointed directly to God and found its definition in terms of the drawing near of that kingly rule that otherwise seemed so distant. For Matthew the gospel points directly to Jesus and finds its definition in terms of the significance of his person for the church and the age of the Evangelist. The gospel of the kingdom denotes for Matthew the good news that, in the person of Jesus, God dwells among men. He has special interest in four titles: Son of God (the person of Jesus), Son- of David (his messiahship), Son of Man (his mission) and Kyrios (his post-Easter relation¬ ship to the disciples). Matthew is confronting the world of his day with the stupendous claim that human reality must be viewed from the standpoint of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. — D.J.H. 899. A. C. Perumalil, “The Gospel According to Matthew,” IndEcclStud 11 (4, 72) 242-252.

Yet, Matthew’s literary practices and theological views are not explored with sufficient thoroughness. Literary-theological reflection rather than homiletic activity is behind the OT fulfillment citations in Mt. On the whole, Matthew seems to use these quotations to demonstrate that the sending of Jesus to Israel is divinely approved. The author’s decision to analyze the texts in isolation leads him to overlook certain problems. — D.J.H. 901r. S. van Tilborg, The Jewish Leaders in Matthew [cf. NTA 17, pp. 248- 249]. R. H.

Yet with each new study of this sort “it becomes more and more of a question whether practitioners of redaction criticism have not got out of hand in their ARTICLES] MATTHEW 299 tendency to take every little difference in form and vocabulary as indicative of a difference in derivation so far as traditions and redactions are concerned.” Also, it may be psychologically naive and historically false to conclude from Matthew’s slinging of epithets at unconverted Jews that there must be a great distance on the historical level between Matthew and his opponents. The author’s analysis has only exacerbated the problem of the co-existence in Mt of Jewish appeal and anti- Jewish polemic. — D.J.H. 902r. E.

His opinions on the dreams of Joseph, the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, the star, the Magi and the flight into Egypt are particularly balanced. There is a sane realism about P’s conclusions. The author, who makes no claim to treat the subject exhaus¬ tively, does not dwell on the Sitz im Leben of the Matthean accounts, nor does he raise the question of whether all the episodes go back to the same period, or whether they were successively added onto an older nucleus.— S.B.M. 903. [Mt 1 — 2] K. Schubert, “Die Kindheitsgeschichten Jesu im Lichte der Religionsgeschichte des Judentums,” BibLiturg 45 (4, ’72) 224-240. The motifs of Jesus as the Son of David and as the Son of the Virgin Mary are common to Mt 1 — 2 and Lk 1 — 2. From the notion that the Davidic king was Yahweh’s adopted son there arose in post-exilic times the view that the eschatological Son of David should be the adopted Son of God. While the motif of virgin birth does appear in Philo’s De Cherubini 40-51, the Platonic background of that passage prevents it from being taken as a good parallel to the Gospel narratives. 2 Enoch 23, however, with its story of the virginal birth and eternal priesthood of Melchizedek, comes from a priestly, apocalyptic group similar to, but not identical with, the Qumran Essenes and affords a far more important parallel. In Mt 1 — 2 Jesus is portrayed as the new David, the new Joshua, the new Exodus, the new Israel and the new Moses. Lk 1 — 2 contrasts John the Baptist and Jesus. Whatever happens in regard to John’s birth is surpassed by Jesus; John is the forerunner and Jesus the fulfillment. The infancy narratives are interpretations of history rather than historical reports. Yet, the literary and theological emphases of these narratives do not preclude an ultimate basis in historical events. Also, the virgin-birth motif was certainly applied to Jesus prior to the composition of these independent narratives. James and the other relatives of Jesus may have been responsible for the dissemination of this motif in the early church. — D.J.H. 904. L. Zani, “Influsso del genere letterario midrashico su Mt 2,1-12,” StudPai 19 (2, ’72) 257-320. 300 GOSPELS [NTA 17 (3, 73) The infancy narrative in Mt cannot be classified simply as belonging to the haggadic midrashic genre. It does not fall under any precise literary genre, but is best described as the language of contemplation and of the joyful proclama¬ tion of Jesus’ infancy as related in a midrashic manner or at least under the influence of the midrashic style. In this context the account of the star of the Magi goes far beyond the narrative of a chronological or miraculous event, and the whole passage manifests an eminently Christological value. — J.J.C.

Hamerton-Kelly, “Attitudes to the Law in Matthew’s Gospel: a Discussion of Matthew 5:18,” 1 3ibR.es 17 (’72) 19-32. Study of the NT lives in conversation with culture; and today the counter¬ culture, interest in apocalyptic and in Jesus as a political activist bring one to discussion of the Law in Mt. The baleful effects of religion without prescrip¬ tive content seen at present, plus the debate about Mt as produced by a com¬ munity of Spirit-filled groups (initiated by E. Kasemann), lead us to think that the early church, which underwent a transformation of consciousness also, may provide a helpful example for us. Attention to Mt 5:18 discloses three distinct attitudes toward the Law in Matthew’s Gospel: a legally rigorous attitude stressing the detail of the Law of Moses; the view that the Law was abrogated by Jesus to permit the Gentile mission ; and Matthew’s understanding that the authority of the tradi¬ tional halakah had been replaced by the risen Christ as halakist. Mt 5:18c is a product of the Matthean community and refers to the cross and resurrection; the wider context is a prophetic or Spirit-inspired attitude which regards doing God’s will as expressed in the Law as a witness to outsiders, but which does not hesitate to modify the Law by intensifying its demand or substituting another injunction from Jesus. Since reinterpretation was not unknown among the rabbis, the issue concerns Jesus’ authority to produce his own halakah; resistance is from conservatives similar to the Sadducees. Three independent oral units are combined in vv. 17-19, vv. 17 and 18 having been brought into chiasmus (without 18a and c) ; v. 20 is probably Matthean. Plerdsai in v. 17 means, in this context, “to establish the eternal validity of the Law, in all its requirements,” being directed against the view that Jesus’ coming rendered part of the Law obsolete. Matthew joined vv. 17 and 18 with the “sentence of holy law,” v. 19, by the connective oun; v. 20 is introductory to the subsequent antitheses (vv. 21-48). There Jesus is presented as the authoritative teacher, the way having been cleared by v. 18c. Matthew clearly disagrees with the rigorists in his church, but his relation- ARTICLES] MATTHEW 301 ships to the liberal “Hellenists” is less clear. It is inst"
