        "text": "E-Book Overview\n\nAs part of the Christian canon of scripture, the New Testament is one of the most influential works in history. Its impact can be seen in many different fields, but without an awareness of the historical, cultural, social, and intellectual context of early Christianity, it can be difficult for modern-day readers to fully understand what the first-century authors were trying to say and how the first readers of the New Testament would have understood these ideas.\n\nThe Routledge Guidebook to the New Testament offers an academic introduction to the New Testament examining:\n\nThe social and historical context in which the New Testament was written\n\nThe primary text, supporting students in close analysis from a range of consensus positions\n\nThe contemporary reception and ongoing influence of the New Testament\n\nWith further reading suggestions, this guidebook is essential reading for all students of religion and philosophy, and all those wishing to engage with this important work.\n\nE-Book Content\n\nE-Book Information"
