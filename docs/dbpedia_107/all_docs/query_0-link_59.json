The shadow of the German occupation of the Eternal City had just passed, and the reigning pontiff, Pope Pius XII (1939–1958), had been hailed as “Defensor Civitatis” (“Defender of the City”) by the delirious crowds when Rome was liberated three weeks earlier. Against the backdrop of these dramatic events, the prelate allowed himself the luxury of rhetorical eloquence: Recall the words of Jesus who said to Peter: “Super hanc petram aedificabo Ecclésiam meam . . . On this rock I will build my Church.” Jesus conceived of Saint Peter as an architect on whose construction an immense development would be centered, a human edifice that would outlast the centuries and embrace the whole earth. Space and time have no bounds. The words of Jesus have been fulfilled. The Roman Empire fell and the Church rebuilt and created Europe and its civilization, despite crises like the medieval and the Protestant. And now, in the midst of this modern crisis in which sees the collapse of empires, in a war that is perhaps headed to the exhaustion and the ruin of both sides, the Church stands firm and potent.\n\nIf the future pope’s words strike a smug triumphal tone, coming as they did from a prelate who was then considered the closest confidant of Pius XII, the sentiments he expressed were not that different from those of General Charles de Gaulle, himself no pious sentimentalist. By coincidence, the day following Montini’s sermon, the French leader was received at the papal court. In his memoirs, de Gaulle dedicated two pages to the encounter with the pope and described the papacy and its incumbent in terms of the eternity of Rome: “Like Rome, which,\n\nxii\n\npreface\n\nfrom the heights of its serenity, keeps watch as, century after century, the constant flow of men and events washes up against its walls, so too the Church, firm but compassionate, keeps vigil over the ebbs and flows of the war . . . His information and reflections do not permit [the pope] to ignore the drama that convulses the world. His lucid thought is fixed on the consequences of the unleashing on the world of the communist and nationalist ideologies . . . His conviction is that only faith, hope, and Christian charity—even if they be forced underground everywhere and for a long time to come—will overcome these menaces.”2 Half a century later, with the Iron Curtain gone and the Communist ideology consigned to the dustbin of history, the American weekly Time designated the incumbent pontiff as its “Man of the Year” for 1994, explaining its choice in these terms: “Pope John Paul II has, among many other things, the world’s bulliest pulpit. Few of his predecessors over the past 2,000 years have spoken from it as often and as forcefully as he. When he talks, it is not only to his flock of nearly a billion; he expects the world to listen. And the flock and the world listen, not always liking what they hear . . . People who see him—and countless millions have—do not forget him. His appearances generate an electricity unmatched by anyone else on earth.”3 Not bad for the heir of a Galilean fisherman who abandoned his nets and boat on the seashore in response to an itinerant first-century Jewish preacher’s call and promise: “Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men” (Matthew 4:19). Fishers of men though they have been, each in his own time, the heirs of the fisherman—there have been, according to the legitimate order of succession, 261 heirs to the mantle of Simon, son of John, called Peter4 —have been men, subject to all the grandeur and all the misery that is the human condition. Some were saints, others little better than bandits. Some were beloved, others execrated. Descending from Peter, the line of succession passes through the great and the mediocre, the benevolent and the malevolent, the blessed and the unfortunate, including in its singular embrace Leo I, hailed as “the Great,” whose memory is venerated even in the Eastern Churches that broke communion with the Roman See; Formosus, who knew peace neither in life nor in death—his corpse was exhumed and mutilated by his successor, Stephen VI; Boniface VI, who ascended to the papal office after having been twice defrocked for gross immorality; Gregory VII, who humiliated an emperor and exalted the papal office; Innocent III, in whose pontificate the papal monarchy reached its medieval zenith; Alexander VI, the Borgia pontiff who helped to hasten the Protestant Reformation by the corruption and sensuality of his life; John XXIII, the beloved “good pope,” who opened the Church to the modern world; and John Paul II, the present bishop of Rome, who contributed immensely to the collapse of the Soviet empire and whose ecclesiastical legacy remains to be determined.\n\npreface\n\nxiii\n\nAnd although—at least in the minds of believers—the office that these popes have held in succession to the “Prince of the Apostles” who, as “Vicar of Christ,” was to “strengthen [his] brethren” (Luke 22:32), is of divine origin, how these men have been raised to that office is a very human affair. While the faithful may console themselves with the confidence that the infinite makes itself evident through the instrumentality of the finite, traditional Catholic theology nonetheless insists on the freedom of the human individual and his or her will. And human individuals, as well as humankind in general, are prone to be conditioned by the times and circumstances in which they find themselves. As the Second Vatican Council, in its “Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World,” proclaimed majestically: “The joys and the hopes, the griefs and the anxieties of the men of this age, especially those who are poor or in any way afflicted, these are the joys and hopes, the griefs and anxieties of the followers of Christ. Indeed, nothing genuinely human fails to raise an echo in their hearts. For theirs is a community composed of men. United in Christ, they are led by the Holy Spirit in their journey to the Kingdom of their Father and they have welcomed the news of salvation which is meant for every man. That is why this community realizes that it is truly linked with mankind and its history by the deepest of bonds” (Gaudium et spes, 1). Consequently, not only is the story of papal death and succession a very human story, but it is one that, now more than ever before, is of interest to all members of the human family, whether Catholic or non-Catholic, believer or not. The telling of this story, long veiled from profane eyes, is the object of the present book. Strictly speaking, this work constitutes a narrative set in a theological and historical context, rather than a proper history. Proper histories require primary sources, which, due in part to the strictures of secrecy surrounding papal succession that will be discussed subsequently, are simply unavailable. Nonetheless, the insular community of the Vatican is not without its oral traditions, and a rich lore is faithfully handed down to initiates, in whose company I was included for a number of years. In lifting the veil a little and opening this behind-the-scenes world to those on the outside, it is my hope that this rich history, replete with all its lessons, might serve not only as an introduction to the pageantry of the Catholic Church but also as an invitation for a wider public discussion, not just of the rituals and personalities that will surround the next sede vacante5 but of the succession process itself. The writing of any book, even one where only an individual’s name appears as its author, is nevertheless a profoundly social enterprise, involving the contributions and support of many people. This is even more so in a case like my own, where the work in question was nurtured over many yeas and its final writing owed itself to a set of circumstances that mark the closing of a chapter in its author’s life. Hence, I have incurred many debts that I must discharge.\n\nxiv\n\npreface\n\nMonsignor Charles Burns of the Vatican Archives, professor of ecclesiastical and diplomatic history at Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, encouraged a young student’s passion for the past, giving it an analytical framework within the ebb and flow of modern politics and international relations. That love of history was nurtured by the treasure trove of lore that I acquired from long hours of conversation with the late Bishop Peter Canisius Johannes van Lierde, vicar general of His Holiness for the Vatican under Popes Pius XII, John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I, and John Paul II, during the three years I was privileged to serve as his aide. The late Cardinal François-Xavier Nguyên van Thuân, president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace and himself papabile at one point, provided me with a window into contemporary dynamics and a vision of a possible future for the Church and also honored me with the commission to edit and translate his two autobiographical works. Of course, these individuals and other priest friends are not in any way responsible for the interpretations and viewpoints that are entirely my own. My agent, John F. Thornton of the Spieler Agency, showed great faith in this book as well as considerable patience with its author; I am indebted to him. I also want to thank Elda Rotor, senior editor at Oxford University Press, for her thoughtful editorial suggestions, and her assistant, Cybele Tom, for her help, especially after Elda went on maternity leave, embracing a far greater bundle of joy than my voluminous manuscript. I am likewise indebted to the peer reviewers who read the manuscript; the detailed comment that they provided with exceptional generosity proved invaluable. I am lucky to have had India Cooper as a copy editor: Her proficiency with her craft much improved the finished text. I am also grateful to the production and marketing staffs of Oxford University Press, many of whom an author never meets, but whose contributions are indispensable to the final product. I have many others to whom I owe thanks, not only for helping me with this book but also for having walked with me on my journey thus far, occasionally even picking me up and dragging me along. Particularly to those who have remained faithful throughout the twists and turns of the road traveled, I will never be able to fully repay the debt. I can only offer the dedication of this volume and make the words of Cicero quoted therein my own, for without these friends life would indeed lose its meaning.\n\npreface\n\nHEIRS OF THE FISHERMAN\n\nxv\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nIntroduction J O H N PA U L I I C R O S S E S A T H R E S H O L D\n\nOn October 16, 2003, Pope John Paul II celebrated the silver anniversary of his election to the Throne of St. Peter, thus reaching a milestone that only two of the successors to the Prince of the Apostles achieved. Of these two predecessors, Blessed Pius IX (1846–1878), who reigned thirty-one years, seven months, and three weeks, and Leo XIII (1878–1903), who reigned twenty-five years and five months, only the former has enjoyed a longer tenure on the papal throne than John Paul. At the beginning of the Mass that the pope celebrated on the steps of St. Peter’s Basilica before an assembly of the faithful estimated in the hundreds of thousands, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, dean of the College of Cardinals,1 saluted the pontiff on behalf of his confrères, the men who will eventually elect John Paul’s successor: In these twenty-five years as Vicar of Jesus Christ in the apostolic succession, you have tirelessly travelled the world, not only to bring to men and women the Gospel of the love of God made flesh in Jesus Christ, beyond all geographical boundaries; you have also crossed the continents of the spirit, often far from one another and set against each other, to bring strangers close, to make the distant friends, and to make room in the world for the peace of Christ. You have spoken to young and old, to the rich and the poor, the powerful and the humble—after the example of Jesus Christ—and you have always shown special love for the poor and defenceless, bringing to all a spark of God’s truth and love. You have proclaimed God’s will fearlessly, even when it was in opposition to what people thought and desired. Like the Apostle Paul, you can say that you have never sought to flatter with words nor to be honored by mankind, but have watched over God’s children as a mother. Like Paul, you too felt drawn to people and wanted to help them share not only in the Gospel but also in your own life. You have undergone criticism and insults, arousing, however, gratitude and love, and causing the walls of hatred and unfamiliarity to crumble.\n\n2\n\nheirs of the fisherman\n\nWhile certainly not everyone—not even among his cardinals, although they would rarely, if ever, be wont to admit that there was dissension among their ranks—has agreed with the ecclesiastical, much less the political, stances that John Paul II has taken during the past two and a half decades, the presence of the throngs spilling from St. Peter’s Square onto the Via della Conciliazione and neighboring streets testified to the formidable moral and religious strength of both the Roman Catholic Church and its central institution, the papacy, even in the postmodern twenty-first century that finds Christianity’s language of sin and redemption unintelligible. Whether they found him godly or holier-thanthou, the great and mighty of the world acknowledged that John Paul was a global player, a political force to be reckoned with. No world leader today would think of sneering and asking, as Joseph Stalin did when he asked French foreign minister Pierre Laval, “The Pope! How many divisions has he got?”2 Stalin’s empire has since fallen, in no small part due to the contributions of the pope from Poland, whose silver anniversary was fêted by nineteen extraordinary delegations of state (the U.S. presidential delegation was headed by Columba Bush, wife of Florida governor and presidential brother Jeb Bush) and the diplomatic representatives of no fewer than 175 of the 192 countries recognized by the United Nations as sovereign states, as well as numerous international personalities including Poland’s Lech Walesa and former UN secretary general Javier Pérez de Cuellar. John Paul II’s anniversary celebration—actually a weeklong series of ceremonies, including the beatification of Mother Teresa of Calcutta and the conferral of the cardinal’s red hat on thirty churchmen—was a triumphalistic reminder that, despite the vicissitudes of history, the Roman pontiff remains the most influential religious leader on the world stage, one whose comings and goings are of interest not just to members of his flock but to the whole world.\n\nThe Achievements of a Pontificate During his pontificate John Paul II has promulgated an extraordinarily voluminous corpus of official documents, in addition to being the first pontiff to publish personal theological and religious works while in office since the ill-fated John XXII (1316–1334), whose opinions on the beatific vision were condemned as heretical by the theologians of his time.3 As of his anniversary on the papal throne, John Paul’s official documents include fourteen encyclicals, from Redemptor hominis (1979),4 on Jesus Christ as the redeemer of man, through Ecclesia de Eucharistia (2003), on the importance of the Eucharist in the life of the Church; thirteen apostolic constitutions from Sapientia Christiana (1979), which reorganized ecclesiastical faculties and universities, through Universi Dominici gregis\n\nj o h n pau l i i c r o s s e s a t h r e s h o l d\n\n3\n\n(1996), which regulates the vacancy of the Apostolic See and the election of the Roman pontiff, and Ecclesia in Urbe (1998) which reorganized the pastoral government of the Vicariate of Rome; twenty-six apostolic letters motu proprio, from Egregia virtutis (1980), which proclaimed SS. Cyril and Methodius, the apostles to the Slavs, as co-patrons of Europe alongside the father of Western monasticism, St. Benedict, through Misericordia Dei (2002), which reaffirmed traditional disciplines regarding the sacrament of penance; fifteen apostolic exhortations, from Catechesi tradendae (1979), on catechism in the contemporary Church, through Pastores gregis on the ministry of bishops in the Church, which the pope promulgated on the date of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his election to the papacy; and numerous apostolic letters, including Ordinatio sacerdotalis (1994), which reaffirmed the reservation of the priesthood to men, Tertio millennio adveniente (1994), which prepared for the jubilee of the year 2000, and Rosarium Virginis Mariae (2002), which instituted five new “luminous” mysteries to the rosary. John Paul II also promulgated the Code of Canon Law (1983) for the Western (Latin) Church, the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (1990) for the Eastern Rite Churches in communion with Rome, the Catechism of the Catholic Church (1993), the revised editio typica of the Roman Missal (2002), and numerous other liturgical and legal documents. During his twenty-five years on the papal throne, John Paul II has presided over an unprecedented fifty canonization ceremonies, proclaiming 476 new saints, 402 of them martyrs and 74 of them confessors of the faith. The new saints include one cardinal, twenty-two bishops, ninety-six diocesan priests, 110 religious men and women, and, extraordinarily, 247 lay men and women. Additionally, the pope has presided over 145 beatification ceremonies, proclaiming a total of 1,320 new beati,5 including Mother Teresa of Calcutta, beatified on October 19, 2003, in the midst of the silver anniversary celebrations. The 1,320 persons beatified include two popes, five cardinals, forty-seven bishops, 359 diocesan priests, 637 religious men and women, and 270 members of the laity. The beati include 1,031 martyrs and 289 confessors. In his nine consistories, John Paul II has named 233 cardinals, including the one created in pectore, that is, whose name has not yet been revealed. As previously noted, as of the October 21, 2003, consistory, there were 135 electors, of whom 130 owe their positions to John Paul (the other five were created by Paul VI). Of the total 194 effective members of the College of Cardinals, not counting the anonymous prelate reserved in pectore, 175 were created by John Paul II, eighteen by Paul VI, and one, Franz König, retired archbishop of Vienna, by Blessed John XXIII. In addition to the consistories to create new cardinals, John Paul has convened the college in six plenary meetings to consult on matters of major importance, such as the Vatican’s financial difficulties.\n\n4\n\nheirs of the fisherman\n\nLess noticeable in the press, but perhaps far more influential, has been John Paul II’s influence on the composition of the worldwide episcopate of the Catholic Church. As of the morning of his anniversary, John Paul II had appointed 3,682 bishops (of whom 306 have subsequently died), almost three-quarters of 4,647 members of the College of Bishops. In addition to the quinquennial ad limina visits and other personal encounters with individual bishops, John Paul has convened fifteen meetings of the Synod of Bishops during his pontificate. Of course, an appointment by John Paul II is not necessarily a guarantee of philosophical or political uniformity. However, most papal nominees have fallen within a narrow range of acceptable orthodoxy, and the few who have ventured abroad have been quickly recalled. On the day after the pope announced his creation as a cardinal in the consistory of October 2003, Keith Michael Patrick O’Brien, archbishop of Saint Andrews and Edinburgh, surprisingly spoke out in favor of a more open attitude toward married priests, homosexual priests, and contraception. A week later, under pressure from the Vatican and with Bible in hand, he made an extraordinary public retraction before worshipers in his Scottish cathedral: “I state that I accept and intend to defend the law on ecclesiastical celibacy as it is proposed by the magisterium of the Catholic Church; I accept and promise to defend the ecclesiastical teaching about the immorality of the homosexual act; I accept and promise to promulgate always and everywhere what the Church’s magisterium teaches on contraception.” Only time will tell whether the conformity extracted from O’Brien and others will perdure or whether other sentiments, long repressed, will find expression in a future pontificate. John Paul II’s pontificate has also been characterized by extensive diplomatic activity. Full bilateral diplomatic relations at the ambassadorial level were forged or reestablished with eighty-six countries,6 bringing to a total of 174 the number of countries7 maintaining diplomatic relations with the Holy See in addition to the European Union and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Furthermore, the Vatican maintains what are described as “diplomatic relations of a special nature” with the Russian Federation and the Palestinian Liberation Organization, with the permanent exchange of “envoys on special mission with the personal rank of ambassador” in the case of the former. During his pontificate—at least as of his twenty-fifth anniversary—John Paul II has had over seven hundred audiences or other meetings with heads of state and received 226 prime ministers or heads of government. Thirty-eight heads of state have been received at the Vatican with the full ceremonial of a “state visit.” As a result of these contacts, in addition to its token participation in multilateral international conventions, the Holy See has signed nearly one hundred concordats, accords, and other bilateral treaties affecting the relations of the Catholic Church with and in certain countries or territories, including the historic “Basic Agreement” with the\n\nj o h n pau l i i c r o s s e s a t h r e s h o l d\n\n5\n\nState of Israel (1993) and the “Basic Agreement” with the Palestine Liberation Organization (2000). Of the 103 apostolic nuncios, papal ambassadors of the highest rank, in active service, only two—both appointed by Pope Paul VI—do not owe their appointments to John Paul II. A distinctive element of John Paul’s papacy has been his extensive travels, which have been unprecedented in the history of the papal office.8 As of his silver anniversary, the pope had made 102 “apostolic visits,” which took him to 131 countries and distinct territories.9 In addition to visits to almost all of the parishes in his diocese of Rome, the pope has also made 144 pastoral visits to dioceses and other locations within Italy—beginning with his visit to the Marian shrine of Mentorella shortly after his election in 1978 and concluding with his visit to the shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary at Pompei shortly before his twentyfifth anniversary. Unlike many of his papal predecessors, John Paul II has continued during his pontificate to exercise sacramental ministries, personally ordaining 321 bishops and 2,810 priests. He has also blessed seventy-seven marriages, anointed 274 sick people, confirmed 1,581 individuals, baptized 1,378 adults and children, and even exorcised two. When at home in the Vatican, John Paul II has held regular general audiences on Wednesdays, receiving some 17 million pilgrims in the more than one thousand general audiences of his pontificate—which, in addition to the millions encountered during his travels, arguably makes him the historical personality who has been seen by more people in person than any other.\n\nA Popes Legacy During his quarter-century as pope, John Paul has racked up an impressive list of accomplishments, even if he will leave a not entirely unambiguous and uncontested theological and ecclesiastical legacy, as he himself admitted in an interview with Italian journalist Vittorio Messori earlier in his pontificate: You rightly assert that the Pope is a mystery. You rightly assert that he is a sign that will be contradicted, that he is a challenge. The old man Simeon said of Christ Himself that He would be “a sign that will be contradicted.” You also contend that, confronted with such a truth—that is, confronted with the Pope—one must choose; and for many the choice is not easy. But was it so easy for Peter? Was it easy for any of his successors? Is it easy for the present Pope? To choose requires man’s initiative. Christ says: “For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father” (Mt 16:17). This choice, therefore, is not only a human initiative but also an act of God, who works and reveals himself through man. And in virtue of such an act of God, a person can repeat, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the\n\n6\n\nheirs of the fisherman living God,” and then recite the entire Creed, which echoes the profound logic of Revelation. A man can also remind himself, as well as others, of the consequences of this logic of the faith which also display the same splendor of the truth. A man can do all of this even though he knows that because of it he will become “a sign that will be contradicted.”10\n\nHistory will undoubtedly record the central role that Pope John Paul II played in bringing about the downfall of Soviet Communism not only in Poland but throughout Eastern Europe and beyond. Another one of his pontificate’s accomplishments has been the cultivation of relatively harmonious relations between Catholicism and other Christian denominations as well as Judaism, moderate Islam, and other faiths. Under the pope’s leadership, tremendous strides were made in the Vatican’s often uneasy relationship with Judaism, culminating in the establishment of full diplomatic ties between the Holy See and the State of Israel in 1993 as well as John Paul’s own historic pilgrimage to the Jewish state. A signal tribute to the success of John Paul’s interfaith efforts was seen when international Muslim organizations joined evangelical Protestant and Mormon groups to defend the Holy See’s unique status at the United Nations as a “nonmember state maintaining a permanent observer mission.” On the other hand, the Vatican’s status at the UN had come under attack in a campaign led by feminist and pro-choice groups precisely because of the pivotal role that the pope’s envoys played in coordinating an unlikely alliance of Muslim nations in the Middle East and developing countries against the attempt, led by the Clinton administration, to establish a global right to abortion at the World Population Conference in Cairo in 1994. For many, in fact, there is no clearer example of the pope’s obscurantism than his adamant insistence on the inherent immorality not only of abortion but of “artificial means” of contraception, even when used by monogamous heterosexual adults. John Paul’s papacy is a “sign of contradiction” not only outside the Catholic Church but within its walls as well. While even his harshest critic within the Church cannot impeach John Paul’s personal integrity, his single-minded dedication to what he perceives to be his duty, and his commitment to an almost mystical holiness of life, they nonetheless point to a whole catalogue of woes, including defections and apathy among younger Catholics, falling Mass attendance across the board, an aging priesthood that seems to be self-destructing, often vicious intramural conflicts between progressives and conservatives involving a host of moral and jurisdictional issues, ever-increasing rates of divorce among Catholics, alarming syncretism (the mixing of Christian beliefs and practices with those of non-Christian traditions) in Africa and Latin America, and the de facto paganization of once-Christian Europe. What the former senior reli-\n\nj o h n pau l i i c r o s s e s a t h r e s h o l d\n\n7\n\ngion correspondent of the New York Times, Peter Steinfels, recently observed about the Church in America— “ Today the Roman Catholic Church in the United States is on the verge of either an irreversible decline or a thoroughgoing transformation”11—is equally applicable to the worldwide body. The official response to these concerns usually involves pointing to impressive statistics, such as those supplied to papal diplomatic representatives on the occasion of the pope’s twenty-fifth anniversary with the exhortation to “bring them to the attention of the episcopal conferences and the local press.”12 Worldwide, the number of baptized Catholics rose from 756,533,000 in 1978 to 1,060,840,000 in 2001 (the statistics for 2002 and 2003 were then unavailable). The most dramatic increase was in Africa, where Church membership more than doubled from 54,759,000 (12.37 percent of the total population) to 135,660,000 (16.77 percent of the total population). Other members of the hierarchy point to the fact that the pope, who admittedly despairs of middle-aged Catholics, reposes his hope for the future in the youth. The World Youth Day phenomenon has certainly been one of the most astonishing features of John Paul’s pontificate: In 1997, for example, secular France was flabbergasted to discover over a million young people flocking to the pope at the World Youth Day in Paris. The spectacle repeated itself in Rome during the Jubilee Year of 2000 and in Toronto in 2002, where an estimated eight hundred thousand youths cheered a pontiff who by then was clearly stricken by Parkinson’s disease, twitching as he drooled out of the corner of his mouth. Likewise there is no denying the perseverance of the faith of millions of ordinary Catholics and a thirst for spirituality on the part of countless others unsatisfied by materialism and a desiccated postmodernity. On the other hand, the objective observer also arrives at the inescapable conclusion that numbers are not everything. Passing displays of mass enthusiasm belie the true state of affairs: In France, for example, barely 10 percent of the young people who greeted John Paul II in 1997 have become anything approaching regular churchgoers. The increase in the number of Catholics worldwide has not been matched by a similar increase in the number of priests: When John Paul ascended the papal throne, Catholics worldwide could count on having one priest for every 1,797; twenty-five years later, the ratio is one priest for every 2,619 Catholics. And various crises—including, but not limited to, the clergy child abuse scandal—have taken their toll on the morale of a flock that is often dangerously polarized between ideologues of the left and the right. These tensions will only be exacerbated if the increasingly ailing John Paul suffers a protracted illness, while others in the hierarchy are paralyzed as a result of the pontificate’s heavy emphasis on the person of the pope and the juridical authority of the central government of the Church that is dependent upon him. In any event, John Paul’s\n\n8\n\nheirs of the fisherman\n\nlegacy to his eventual successor will consist of both high expectations and monumental challenges.\n\nThe Next Pope and the World For all these reasons, the choice of the next pope will be of interest to more than just Catholics, a truth of Realpolitik that astute statesmen have long understood. Despite the humiliating blows that he had dealt the papacy, Napoleon Bonaparte still recognized the worldly power inherent in the papal office. When, as First Consul, he sent François Cacault to Rome as his envoy to Pope Pius VII (1800– 1823), he instructed the diplomat to “deal with the pope as if he had two hundred thousand men at his command”— the military genius denominating the pontiff ’s influence on world affairs in military terms. Despite the long-standing taboo in the Vatican against discussing events beyond the incumbent pontificate, given the present pope’s age and physical infirmities it is likely that the end is not far off. The Catholic Church will then look for a successor to John Paul II. The new man will have to manage a difficult balancing act, not only amid the doctrinal and moral shoals of Catholic belief but with respect to the Church’s relations with the world and, as a consequence, the role that the more than one billion Catholics play within humanity. With the overwhelming majority of his flock expected to live in Latin America, Africa, and Asia by 2025, the next Roman pontiff will have to be a spokesman for more equitable economic development and political empowerment, while not antagonizing those members of his flock who still live in Europe and North America with some papal version of left-wing clericalism. As theologian and sociologist Uwe Siemon-Netto has observed: “Should the next pope be any less sensitive to global social concerns than John Paul II—or should he, conversely, proclaim a social Gospel rather than preaching social responsibility from the Gospel—the consequences might be catastrophic.”13 On the other hand, lacking the military forces and economic might that, in the power calculations of international statecraft, underlie effective power, John Paul’s successor will have only the papacy’s moral authority to rely on—and it is an authority that, given the battering it has taken in recent times, will only be effective in the measure that its exercise is judicious. Consequently, the eyes of billions—some of them devout members of the Catholic faith, others less devout, others less faithful, and still others of different faiths or no faith at all—will be on the events that follow John Paul’s eventual passage into eternity. Notwithstanding the global political and strategic import of the election of the next pope, the election—arguably the oldest electoral process by secret bal-\n\nj o h n pau l i i c r o s s e s a t h r e s h o l d\n\n9\n\nlot in continuous use in the world—will feature a very limited franchise: Under the canon (church) law presently in force, it is limited to those members of the College of Cardinals who are under the age of eighty at the moment John Paul draws his last breath. While Catholic theology has traditionally held that there is a divine providence at work in the election of the Roman pontiff, the election itself is a very human event, one conditioned by the historical circumstances of the moment and the basic human idiosyncrasies of the electors. For all else, it suffices to recall that in commenting on Stalin’s impertinent query to Laval about the number of divisions that the pope possessed, Winston Churchill noted, “Laval’s answer was not reported to me; but he might certainly have mentioned a number of legions not always visible on parade.”14 Humanity will anxiously await the intervention of these unseen legions in the next papal election.\n\n10\n\nheirs of the fisherman\n\nChapter One\n\nTHE POPE IS DEAD!\n\nIn Rome there is a saying that declares, “Pietro non muore,” “Peter does not die.” While allegorically Peter, like his city, is eternal in the unbroken line of his successors, it is nonetheless true that Gregory, Pius, Leo, Benedict, Paul, and John Paul die. In fact, the medieval and baroque iconography of the Eternal City is full of depictions illustrating the certainty that not even the highest dignity in the world—understood to be that of the Vicar of Christ—can exempt a man from humanity’s common mortality. For example, the funerary monument of Pope Alexander VII (1655–1667) in St. Peter’s Basilica, a masterpiece in Sicilian jasper of Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s art, contains, among its haunting figures, a skeleton brandishing a scythe and showing an hourglass to the Chigi pope,1 as if to tell him that the hour of his death had come. While his mortality makes him like any other man, the rituals that begin immediately upon his death markedly separate a pope from the rest of humanity, as if to remind one and all that the deceased was no mere mortal but was, in Catholic belief, the latest in an unbroken line going back to Simon, called Peter, son of John, the Galilean fisherman to whom Jesus of Nazareth, incarnate Son of God, entrusted the care of his nascent flock. The official yearbook of the Holy See, the Annuario Pontificio, gives the titles of the incumbent pontiff as “Bishop of Rome, Successor of St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles, Vicar of Jesus Christ, Supreme Pontiff of the Universal Church, Patriarch of the West, Archbishop and Metropolitan of the Roman Province, Primate of Italy, Sovereign of the Vatican City State.” The papal titles are not merely ceremonial but have a theological and canonical significance often forgotten, even by Catholics. The incumbent pontiff combines in his person these overlapping titles, each of which gives him a special relationship to the faithful and the bishops in the corresponding territory. As bishop of Rome he is the diocesan bishop of that diocese only;\n\nthe pope is dead!\n\n11\n\nas metropolitan he has jurisdiction over the bishops and dioceses that make up the Roman Province; as primate he presides over the Italian bishops; and as patriarch he has specific oversight over the West. In the latter role, the Roman pontiff has from ancient times ruled all the Western lands where Latin was once the civilized and, until recently, the liturgical language, and where the Roman Rite (or ritual order) is now used almost exclusively and the Roman canon law obtains. To Christians in the East, particularly those belonging to the Eastern Catholic Churches, he is supreme pontiff, not patriarch. Hence there has always been a closer relation between Western bishops and the pope than between him and their Eastern brethren, just as there is a still closer relation between him and the suburban bishops of the Roman Province of which he is metropolitan. Many customs and disciplines usually thought of as “Catholic,” including clerical celibacy, actually are not universal laws of the Church but are particular to the canonical legislation of the Western patriarchate. To the impressive catalogue of titles that appears in the papal yearbook, one may add the traditional “Servant of the Servants of God,” first adopted by St. Gregory I (590–604) and in general use since St. Gregory VII (1073–1085), that still heads the Latin documents that emanate from the Vatican. And, although it has not yet appeared in official documents along with his formal titles, Pope John Paul II has repeatedly referred to himself as “Pastore Universale della Chiesa” (“Universal Pastor of the Church”), a title very much consonant with the “pastoral” style of papal ministry he likes to project.2\n\nIs the Pope Dead?\n\nThe first ritual associated with papal death and succession is the ceremony to ascertain that the incumbent pope is truly dead. While this might seem strange in an age when medical science provides the means to monitor with great precision brain, heart, and other physiological functions, it should not be forgotten that it was not that long ago when the life or death of the members of the Soviet Politburo, to cite but one example, was subject to all manner of arcane speculation by international intelligence services. And the history of the papacy is replete with examples of the capital importance, political as well as spiritual, of verifying the death of the supreme pontiff. The history of the papacy in the early Middle Ages was marked by constantly contested papal elections wherein the various claimants were often proxies for struggles between factions of the nobility. One such rivalry was that in the eleventh century between the Frangipani family, partisans of the German Holy Roman emperor, and the Pierleoni, a family of Jewish origins that was the\n\n12\n\nheirs of the fisherman\n\nstandard-bearer for the nobility of the Roman countryside. When Paschal II (1099– 1118) died after a long pontificate spent fighting the Emperor Henry V over the question of lay investiture,3 the papal chancellor, Cardinal Giovanni Caetani, a Benedictine monk from Monte Cassino, was elected Gelasius II in an election held at Santa Maria in Pallara on the Palatine. The new pope had no sooner been elected, and had not yet been ordained a priest or consecrated a bishop4—although already elderly, he was only a deacon at the time—when he was brutally attacked and imprisoned by Cencius Frangipani. Although he was released through the intervention of Pier de Leone, prefect of the city, Gelasius fled to his native Gaeta with the cardinals when the Frangipani summoned aid from Henry V. The emperor then tried to set up an antipope,5 Gregory VIII. When Henry left the city, after occupying it for several months, Gelasius returned, only to be attacked once more by the Frangipani when he tried to celebrate Mass at the Basilica of Santa Prassede, the Lateran Basilica6 still being occupied by the antipope. Gelasius then fled to France; he died there at the Benedictine abbey of Cluny, where he had taken refuge, just four days short of the first anniversary of his election. When Gelasius died, the cardinals who shared his exile quickly elected Callistus II (1119–1124) to succeed him; the cardinals remaining in Rome, under pressure from the Pierleoni, ratified the decision. In 1122, Callistus managed to arrive at an honorable settlement with the emperor through the Concordat of Worms. The emperor renounced investing those elected to bishoprics and abbeys with the ring and crosier, symbols of spiritual authority. The pope, for his part, granted to Henry personally the right to preside over elections to bishoprics and abbeys in Germany, provided that the elections were free and canonical. The emperor could then invest the candidate elected with the temporal jurisdiction of his office by means of the scepter, the symbol of temporal authority. In the lands of the empire outside Germany, the election could take place without the emperor’s presence and the investiture could follow within six months of the elected candidate’s consecration. When Callistus died, the majority of the cardinals, meeting in Rome under the protection of the Pierleoni family, unanimously elected Cardinal Teobaldo Boccapecci as Celestine II. He had just been proclaimed pope and clothed with the red papal mantle, and the singing of the Te Deum hymn of thanksgiving had commenced, when the Frangipani broke into the assembly with armed troops. After a violent struggle, during which blows were rained upon the just-proclaimed Celestine, the papal chancellor and Leo Frangipani proclaimed Cardinal Lamberto Scannabecchi of Ostia as Pope Honorius II. The injured Celestine decided that discretion was the better part of valor and quickly resigned. The Pierleoni were paid a substantial bribe to withdraw, and the traumatized cardinals proceeded to duly elect and enthrone Honorius II, who reigned until 1130.\n\nthe pope is dead!\n\n13\n\nThis complicated story sets the stage for what happened as Honorius fell ill. The chancellor, Cardinal Aimeric, foreseeing the end, had the dying pontiff removed to the monastery of San Gregorio on the Caelian Hill, where, guarded by soldiers from the nearby strongholds of the Frangipani, he died on the night between February 13 and February 14, 1130. After hastily burying Honorius in a temporary grave, Aimeric and his allies among the cardinals clandestinely elected Cardinal Gregory Papareschi as Innocent II (1130–1143), enthroning him at daybreak at the Lateran. When the news got out, the rest of the cardinals refused to accept the de facto coup and, meeting later in the morning in the Basilica of San Marco, elected Cardinal Pietro Pierleoni as Anacletus II. Both elections were, by the canons of the time, irregular, Innocent’s perhaps more glaringly so. The result was an eight-year schism, with both claimants (Anacletus II being succeeded in 1138 by Victor IV) competing for recognition. Victor II’s act of abdication, which convalidated Innocent’s election, finally put an end to the dispute in May 1138. The dispute arose not only because of the rivalry between the Frangipani and Pierleoni but because the legislation concerning papal elections was still a work-in-progress. Given the difficulties in travel at the time, the accepted procedure contained no stipulations as to how many members of the Sacred College constituted a quorum. Rather, it presumed that the election would take place among those cardinals present for the funeral of the deceased pontiff (as was the case in 1119, when the minority of cardinals present at Cluny with Gelasius II when he died elected Callistus II, the majority then accepting the decision). This loophole allowed the unscrupulous chancellor Aimeric to cloak the death and hasty funeral of Honorius II in secrecy, admitting only those cardinals sympathetic to his party into the election he engineered. The importance of having a procedure for ascertaining the actual death of the reigning pope, a procedure that developed with great ritual over the centuries, has perhaps diminished somewhat in recent years with more tranquil times and the progress of medical science. Nevertheless, papal death remains an event vested with almost singular import, rendering it a public act—one likely to be even more closely observed in the age of the twenty-four-hour news cycle. With the exception of John Paul I, who died unexpectedly during the night in 1978 after only thirty-three days on the papal throne, all the popes of the last two centuries have breathed their last surrounded by the members of their families and household staff as well as the highest-ranking officials of papal administration, including the dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, the cardinal secretary of state,7 the cardinal camerlengo (or chamberlain) of the Holy Roman Church,8 and the cardinal major penitentiary,9 who has the faculties to impart the indulgences that even a dying pope may feel the need for. Until Paul VI did away with the corps during his post–Vatican II simplification of the papal court, the Noble\n\n14\n\nheirs of the fisherman\n\nGuards, in their scarlet uniforms and plumed helmets, would assume guard around the dying pontiff. Outside the bedchamber of the pope would gather various other dignitaries, ecclesiastical and lay, whose positions, while not elevated enough to permit them direct access to the dying pontiff, were nonetheless important enough to assure them a ringside seat at the drama unfolding. Pope Pius XII (1939–1958), whose reserved personality caused him to be rather jealous of his privacy and resentful of intrusions, tried to limit the number of those present at his final agony in the summer of 1958. Unfortunately, he was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing his passing, the first to occur in the age of mass communications, from turning into a spectacle. A Jesuit priest from Vatican Radio, Father Francesco Pellegrino, set up a radio transmitter in the adjacent room, broadcasting updates on the rapid decline of the pontiff to the expectant millions of faithful who accompanied the pope with their prayers. Pius XII’s unscrupulous personal physician, the ophthamologist Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi, sneaked a small Leica camera into the dying pontiff ’s bedroom and took photographs of his patient, which he then sold to the French weekly Paris-Match. Galeazzi-Lisi’s breach of his august patient’s confidence was not limited to his playing amateur paparazzo. In addition to postmortem outrages to be recounted shortly, a retrospective examination of Pius XII’s medical record reveals an extensive history of medical incompetence and outright quackery that would be a malpractice attorney’s dream. Galeazzi-Lisi, an oculist with rather limited training as a medical internist, was picked to be Pius’s personal physician through the sort of favoritism that has traditionally been the bane of the papal administration. His brother was none other than Count Enrico Galeazzi, a longtime confidant of Cardinal Francis Joseph Spellman of New York, who was the architect of the Pontifical North American College. Over the years, Galeazzi-Lisi subjected the aging pontiff to a wild variety of strange diagnoses and even stranger treatments. When, during the summer of 1952, Pius was stricken with gastritis and the onset of kidney dysfunction, Galeazzi-Lisi diagnosed the episode as “chromic acid poisoning” from the papal toothpaste and prescribed a different dental solution. When the gastritis, not surprisingly, showed itself again the following year, and the pope suffered from recurring hiccoughs, the physician brought in a Swiss quack, Dr. Paul Niehans, to inject his patient with cellular extracts derived from the hypothalamus and adrenal glands of fetal lambs as a rejuvenation treatment. With such medical attention, it is hardly surprising that Pius XII did not live to see the advanced age that his family was famous for enjoying. It was, no doubt, this scandalous episode that played itself out around Pius XII’s last agony that inspired Pope John Paul II to specifically decree, in his apostolic constitution on the vacancy of the Apostolic See and the election of the Roman pontiff, issued in 1996 under the title entitled Universi Dominici gregis:\n\nthe pope is dead!\n\n15\n\n“No one is permitted to use any means whatsoever in order to photograph or film the Supreme Pontiff either on his sickbed or after death, or to record his words for subsequent reproduction. If after the Pope’s death anyone should wish to take photographs of him for documentary purposes, he must ask permission from the Cardinal Camerlengo of Holy Roman Church, who will not however permit the taking of photographs of the Supreme Pontiff except attired in pontifical vestments” (n. 30). As the end drew near, the cardinal major penitentiary would exhort the dying pontiff to use his last reserves of energy to bless his family, his collaborators, and the world—as if to indicate that a pope should die carrying out his functions as well as to profess a belief that perhaps, as the dying pontiff was headed to an encounter with God, his final blessing was somehow more efficacious than under ordinary circumstances. The cardinal major penitentiary would then, after invoking the intercession of the angels and saints for the dying pontiff, commence the ancient ritual formulary for the final commendation of a departing soul: “Profiscere, anima christiana, de hoc mundo…” (“Go forth, Christian soul, from this world . . .”). When the pope had drawn his last breath, the papal physician would hold a lighted candle before the lips of the deceased. After the flame ceased to flicker, he would confirm the death by checking for any indication of heartbeat or pulse, in modern times availing himself of a stethoscope. (Such was Dr. Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi’s infamy for incompetence that, on the occasion of Pope Pius XII’s death in 1958, the assembled dignitaries did not credit his pronouncement that the pontiff had breathed his last. Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani stepped forward and took the stethoscope from the physician. Having verified for himself that the end had come, the irascible head of the Holy Office then communicated the confirmation with a nod to the other prelates present.) If no signs of life presented themselves, the prelates present in the chamber then fell to their knees and began the ritual responsory: “Subvénite, Sancti Dei; occúrrite, Angeli Domini: Suscipientes animam eius. Offerentes eam in conspectu Altissimi” (“Come to his aid, Saints of God; race to meet him, Angels of the Lord: Receive his soul and present it in the presence of the Most High”). Then each, in order of hierarchical rank, approached the body and kissed the hand of the deceased, while the doors of the bedchamber were thrown open and the word spread of the passing of the supreme pontiff. In the modern period, mass communications spread the information quickly, leading journalists to compete to be the first to announce the news, even before the formal announcement by the Holy See. Once again, the unscrupulous Dr. Galeazzi-Lisi attempted to profit from his position, accepting a payment from an Italian news agency to inform them of Pope Pius XII’s death before the official\n\n16\n\nheirs of the fisherman\n\nannouncement. The signal agreed upon was that the physician, after ascertaining his patient’s death, would open a certain window in the papal summer palace of Castel Gandolfo while the prelates present were distracted by paying their last homage to the deceased pontiff and offering prayers of commendation for him. By coincidence, one of the prelates waiting around for the pope’s death grew hot and threw the window in question, which was usually shut, open. As a result, three Italian newspapers, taking their cue from what they thought was the prearranged signal, ran black-edged special editions proclaiming the death of Pius XII on October 8, a full day before he actually died. When officials at the Vatican denied the news of the death, the editions had to be recalled. Traditionally, as soon as the prelates had paid their last homage to the deceased pontiff, the senior chamberlain would cover the face of the deceased with a white veil. The penitentiaries of the Vatican Basilica, the priests who hear confessions in St. Peter’s, would assume their ancient privilege of keeping watch over the body. Either in the private chapel of the papal apartments or on a special altar erected in the chamber of the deceased, a prelate would begin the first of the Requiem Masses to be said for the repose of the soul of the dead pope. When he finished, another would take his place; the cardinals, bishops, and other prelates closest to the deceased carried out this task in relays, as if to say that even as the deceased pope was greater than other men in life, he had greater need for prayers for his soul in death. The same thought lies behind the extended period of funerary rites, the Novemdiales (“nine days”), to be described shortly. Until Paul VI simplified the rituals of the papal court—in fact, with his motu proprio decree Pontificalis Domus of March 28, 1968, he formally abolished the “Papal Court” as such, substituting for it a much-reduced “Papal Household”— the body of the deceased would be covered with a red silk cloth, the right hand, wearing the papal ring, remaining visible. At the four corners of the bed, large beeswax candles would be lit. At the foot of the bed, a bucket of holy water would be placed on a stand, its contents to be employed by visiting prelates to sprinkle the body of the deceased pontiff in blessing. The Noble Guards, the papal honor guard recruited from members of the Italian nobility, in full dress uniform, would assume position as an honor guard for their sovereign. Shortly thereafter, a detachment of the Swiss Guards, the Holy See’s traditional “mercenary” military force, would accompany the cardinal camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church (or, in his absence, the dean of the College of Cardinals) in procession to the room where the body of the pope lay. The camerlengo is a cardinal designated by the pope to administer the Holy See in the interregnum between the death of the pontiff and the election of his successor. His responsibility is to safeguard the temporal and spiritual rights of the papal office for the man ultimately elected to it. Traditionally, he bears a red-velvet-covered\n\nthe pope is dead!\n\n17\n\nscepter-like staff as a symbol of his authority. He is also entitled to coin money— or, in the more recent practice, strike commemorative silver medallions—and issue postage stamps bearing his coat of arms, surmounted by the papal keys and covered by the ombrellino, or little canopy, signifying his office as camerlengo. French cardinal Jean Villot, who was cardinal camerlengo in 1978, issued two series of coins and stamps, since he served in his office following the deaths of Paul VI and, barely a month later, that of John Paul I. The camerlengo is assisted in his task by the Reverend Apostolic Camera (or Chamber), a council of prelates previously designated by the deceased pope.10 The camerlengo’s first duty is to formally identify the body of the pontiff and to ascertain his death. He is assisted by the vice-camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, an archbishop who will assume his regency functions once he enters the conclave,11 and the other prelates of the Apostolic Camera. By tradition (a tradition not observed since John XXIII died in 1963), the camerlengo withdrew from the papal bedchamber after the medical declaration of death and exchanged his bright scarlet cardinal’s robes for purple-red robes indicative of mourning before returning with an honor guard detachment of Swiss Guards to carry out his task of formal certification of death. One of the prelates would lift the veil covering the face of the pope while the cardinal camerlengo called out to the deceased using his baptismal name. Until John XXIII abolished the ritual in his 1962 decree Summi pontificis electio, the camerlengo would lightly tap the pope’s brow with a silver hammer as he called out the name. Having received no response from the pope, the camerlengo would then officially certify the death with a brief declaration, “Vere Papa mortuus est” (“The Pope has truly died”), and fall to his knees to recite Psalm 130, De profundis (“Out of the depths”). The camerlengo would remove the “Ring of the Fisherman”—the signet ring used to authenticate certain papal documents, so called because, as well as bearing the name of the incumbent pope, it depicts St. Peter fishing from a boat— from the finger of the deceased. The notary of the Apostolic Camera would draw up a legal record of the events. The bells of St. Peter’s Basilica would then toll to broadcast the news, the other bells of the Eternal City joining in. At the deaths of Pius XII and Paul VI, both at Castel Gandolfo, it was the bells of the humble church of that picturesque resort village, nestled on the crater of the Alban Lake, that tolled the news. Pope John Paul II’s apostolic constitution on vacancies in the papal office, Universi Dominici gregis, succinctly gives only the following instructions concerning the death of a pope: “As soon as he is informed of the death of the Supreme Pontiff, the Camerlengo of Holy Roman Church must officially ascertain the Pope’s death, in the presence of the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations,12 of the Cleric Prelates of the Apostolic Camera and of the Secretary and Chancellor\n\n18\n\nheirs of the fisherman\n\nof the same; the latter shall draw up the official death certificate. The Camerlengo must also place seals on the Pope’s study and bedroom, making provision that the personnel who ordinarily reside in the private apartment13 can remain there until after the burial of the Pope, at which time the entire papal apartment will be sealed; he must notify the Cardinal Vicar for Rome14 of the Pope’s death, whereupon the latter shall inform the People of Rome by a special announcement; he shall notify the Cardinal Archpriest of the Vatican Basilica; he shall take possession of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican and, either in person or through a delegate, of the Palaces of the Lateran and of Castel Gandolfo,15 and exercise custody and administration of the same; he shall determine, after consulting the heads of the three Orders of Cardinals,16 all matters concerning the Pope’s burial, unless during his lifetime the latter had made known his wishes in this regard; and he shall deal, in the name of and with the consent of the College of Cardinals, with all matters that circumstances suggest for safeguarding the rights of the Apostolic See and for its proper administration. During the vacancy of the Apostolic See, the Camerlengo of Holy Roman Church has the duty of safeguarding and administering the goods and temporal rights of the Holy See, with the help of the three Cardinal Assistants, having sought the views of the College of Cardinals, once only for less important matters, and on each occasion when more serious matters arise” (n. 17).\n\nWhat Do Popes Die Of? Interestingly, an autopsy has never been formally part of the certification of papal death. However, the examination of historical records reveals a variety of reasons for papal deaths over the centuries.17 Old age. The Psalmist declared that “the sum of our years is seventy, eighty for the strongest” (90:10). Statistics show that, at least over the course of the last two centuries, this has held true for the popes. Of the fourteen pontiffs who have sat on the Throne of Peter before John Paul II, the average age at death has been seventy-seven, the average reign being fourteen years. Of course, dying at an advanced age does not necessarily mean dying of old age. But some pontiffs, even in the most violent of times, did manage to die peacefully in the winter of life. St. Agatho (678–681) is traditionally reputed to have been the longest-lived pope. A Sicilian monk who was said to already have been a centenarian when he was elected bishop of Rome, he reigned only three years before his death at the reputed age of 107. His pontificate saw an end to the Monothelite controversy over the human and divine wills of Christ with his approval of the decrees of the Third Council of Constantinople, the sixth of the Ecumenical Councils.18 Agatho\n\nthe pope is dead!\n\n19\n\nwas buried in a grotto below the Vatican Basilica and eventually venerated as a saint by both the Eastern and Western Churches. In his youth, Celestine III (1191–1198) was a student of Peter Abelard at the University of Paris. On Christmas Day 1197, feeling the weight of his ninety-two years, he offered to abdicate the papacy if the College of Cardinals would agree to elect as his successor his protégé, Cardinal Giovanni of Santa Prisca. The cardinals balked at this attempt to deprive them of their electoral franchise, and the pope died the following January 8 and was buried in the Basilica of St. John Lateran. Gregory IX (1227–1241), known for his codification of canon law and his friendship with St. Francis of Assisi as well as for his quarrels with the Emperor Frederick II, also died in his nineties. The compilation of papal decretals he promulgated (the Liber extra) became the fundamental source for the law of the Church (i.e., canon law) until the promulgation in 1917 of a Code of Canon Law. Gregory also first established the papal Inquisition, entrusting it to the newly formed Order of Preachers, popularly known as the Dominicans, and making convicted heretics liable to the death penalty (to be applied, however—once the Inquisition determined it—by the civil authorities). On the other hand, he reopened the University of Paris in 1231. He is buried in the crypt of St. Peter’s Basilica. John XXII (1316–1334) was elected as a compromise candidate after a conclave lasting more than two years precisely because he was thought sickly and deemed by the deadlocked cardinals to be a transitional figure, being already seventytwo years old at the time of his election. Recovering almost miraculously, he reigned eighteen years before dying at the age of ninety. John enjoys the dubious distinction of being one of the few popes—and the only one in times recent enough for an accurate record to still exist—to be accused of heresy while on the papal throne. He expounded his conviction that the saints do not see God until after the day of final judgment, in contradiction to the traditional doctrine that the saints enjoy the “Beatific Vision” immediately after death. The pope expressed his view, along with his idea that devils and the souls of the damned were not yet in hell (since they obviously had to await the day of judgment for their punishment just as the saints had to await it for their reward), in a series of sermons he preached between All Saints Day (November 1, 1331) and the Feast of the Annunciation (March 25, 1332). In an age in which theological controversies were closely followed, the pope’s preaching caused uproar throughout Christendom. Theologians of the University of Paris condemned it formally, and a number of cardinals planned a council to depose him for heresy. However, John fell ill and, on his deathbed, moderated his position to hold that the saints see God “as their condition allowed” and insisting that his view was a purely personal one.19\n\n20\n\nheirs of the fisherman\n\nGregory XII (1406–1415) died in 1417 at the age of ninety-two, but as cardinal bishop of Porto rather than as supreme pontiff, having abdicated at the Council of Constance in 1415. He was buried in the cathedral of Recanati. When his tomb was opened during the renovations of that edifice in 1623, his body was found to be perfectly preserved and was clothed again in papal vestments before being reburied. Leo XIII (1878–1903), having celebrated his silver jubilee on the papal throne in February 1903, died peacefully the following July at the age of ninety-three.20 He was buried in a sumptuous monument near the entrance to the sacristy of the Lateran Basilica. Other popes, even if they did not reach such a prodigious age as these, also died peacefully after a long life. St. Anterus (235–236) was the first of his line not to succumb to the persecutions that claimed the lives of the popes during the centuries before the Peace of Constantine. The fourth-century Liberian Catalogue says that he “fell asleep,” implying a quiet death in his old age. Innocent VII (1404–1406) died peacefully, aged seventy, in the midst of the Great Schism.21 Gregory XIII (1572–1585), great patron of the Jesuits, who gratefully named their principal university in Rome, the Pontifical Gregorian University,22 after him, died at the age of 84. He is perhaps best known to the world for having reformed the Julian calendar, promulgating in 1572 the calendar subsequently named after him. He is buried in St. Peter’s Basilica. Urban VIII (1623–1644), having survived two attempts on his life by clerics, died peacefully at the age of seventy-six. Urban, who was born Maffeo Barberini, earned for himself the unflattering epigram “Quod non fecerunt Barbari fecerunt Barberini” (“What the Barbarians did not do, the Barberini did”) when he took the ornamental bronze girders from the Pantheon to make armaments for his wars, melting them down after the peace to provide material for Bernini’s baldacchino over the main altar in St. Peter’s Basilica, the church where this pope was also buried.23 Benedict XIII (1724–1730) died at the age of eighty-one. As he aged, he was counseled to cut back on his liturgical activities to avoid unnecessary fatigue. His response was lapidary: “A pope should die with his vestments on.” Originally entombed in St. Peter’s Basilica, his body was subsequently moved to the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, associated with his beloved Dominican order. Gregory XVI (1831–1846), a noted reactionary who condemned freedom of conscience and of the press as well as the separation of Church and state, died peacefully at the age of eighty, even as the city of Rome seethed on the edge of revolt. A quick wit, he once explained his opposition to railroads to a French\n\nthe pope is dead!\n\n21\n\nvisitor by stating that they were not “chemins de ferre” but “chemins d’enfer” (the “road to hell”). He is buried in St. Peter’s Basilica in a monument created by Luigi Amici. Finally, Blessed Pius IX (1846–1878) died serenely at the age of eighty-five, after the longest pontificate in history, which saw the loss of the papacy’s temporal dominion over central Italy. (While Pio Nono’s passing may have been peaceful, death marked only the beginning of his travails, as will be recounted shortly.) Illness. Over the centuries, the illnesses of the pontiffs were kept secret— or at least as secret as they could be in an ambience as rumor-driven as the Vatican’s. There is even a Vatican truism that holds that “the pope is not sick until dead.” In recent years, the increasing manifestations of the physical infirmities of John Paul II have lifted the veil slightly, but the old policy of discretion still prevails. During the last years of the pontificate of Paul VI (1963–1978), one of the biggest indications that the pontiff ’s health was in decline was the restoration of the sedia gestatoria, the portable throne formerly used to bear the popes in procession, to move Pope Paul to and from functions in St. Peter’s Basilica. It had been Paul VI himself who, in his pursuit of “apostolic simplicity” after the Second Vatican Council, had retired the sedia to a museum he created at the old papal palace next to the Lateran Basilica in Rome. Veil of secrecy or not, surrounding papal infirmities, it is known that some popes did succumb to illness. Virgilius’s (537–555) reign was clouded by the Monophysite theological controversy that split Christianity over the nature of the divine-human relation in Christ. He was arrested during Mass and deported to Constantinople by officers acting under the orders of the Byzantine emperor Justinian, dying of gallstones at Syracuse in Sicily while en route into his exile. Sisinnius (708), though greatly respected, was so old and crippled with gout that at the time of his election he was unable to use his hands to feed himself. He died barely twenty days after his consecration as bishop of Rome, with his only recorded ecclesiastical act as pontiff being the consecration of a bishop for Corsica. Stephen (II) (752) suffered a stroke three days after his election and died on the fourth day. There is a dispute over whether he figures into the papal succession or not. As he was never consecrated a bishop, and consecration was deemed essential by the canons of the time, he was not reckoned a pope by any contemporary or medieval documents. In the sixteenth century, however, the theory developed that valid election was all that was required to make a man the pope. Thus the official yearbook of the Holy See, the Annuario Pontificio, until 1960 included him as “Stephen II” in its official list of pontiffs. Editions since 1961 have suppressed his name. Hence, all subsequent popes called Stephen have a dual numbering.\n\n22\n\nheirs of the fisherman\n\nJohn XI (931–935) was one of the most unfit incumbents ever to sit on the Throne of Peter. The illegitimate son of Pope Sergius III (904–911) and Marozia, the female senator and all-powerful ruler of Rome at the time, he was elevated to the papacy in his early twenties. Living up to the maxim that he who lives in a glass house ought not cast stones, he ratified the Byzantine emperor Romanus I’s appointment of his sixteen-year-old son Theophylact as patriarch of Constantinople, dispatching two bishops as his legates to consecrate and enthrone the boy, to the understandable shock of the Eastern Church. The contemporary chronicler Luitprand of Cremona relates delicately that John XI died from “excesses of table and bed.” He was buried in the Lateran Basilica. Gregory XI (1370–1378) was barely forty-two when he was elected to the papal throne. He definitively returned the papacy to Rome, a move that probably shortened his life, as he gradually succumbed to what appears to have been cardiac tensions, the combined stressful effects of the climate and the internecine civil disturbances. He was buried in the Church of Santa Maria Nuova, his titular church as a cardinal, now known as Santa Francesca Romana, near the Roman Forum. Julius III (1550–1555) spent most of his pontificate, the occasional bout of serious activity excepted, in pleasurable pursuits at the luxurious Villa di Papa Guilio (Villa Guilia) he caused to be erected outside Rome’s Porta del Popolo. He caused serious scandal when he became infatuated with a fifteen-year-old boy picked up on the streets, Innocenzo, whom he forced his brother to adopt and whom he then named a cardinal. Not surprisingly, his lasting contributions were in the realm of the arts; he made Michelangelo the chief architect of St. Peter’s and the composer Palestrina the choirmaster of the Cappella Giulia. For years a victim of the gout, he finally died from the diet he had undertaken as a cure for appendicitis and was buried in the crypt of the Vatican Basilica. Clement XIV (1769–1774) is best known as the pope who, under pressure from the Catholic powers, decreed the suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773, citing the Jesuit order’s difficulties with secular rulers and other religious congregations alike and the need to bring peace to the Church. His last months, however, were anything but peaceful. He caught a chill when a sudden cloudburst soaked him during the traditional Assumption Day procession in 1774 and never quite recovered. During the last weeks of his life, the ill pontiff was beset by a manic depression marked by a fear of being assassinated. When he finally died, the rapid decomposition of his body fueled speculation, proven unfounded by the subsequent autopsy, that he had been poisoned by members of the order he had suppressed. He was buried in the Basilica of the Holy Apostles.24 Paul VI (1963–1978) inherited the task of concluding the Vatican Council and carrying out its mandate for the renewal of the Church. Having to balance the\n\nthe pope is dead!\n\n23\n\ncompeting tensions within the Church during the explosive 1960s and early 1970s proved an almost impossible burden for a man whose predecessor had characterized him as being a “Hamlet,” despite being intellectually gifted. The icon of his difficult pontificate might well be his last public appearance, the funeral at St. John Lateran of his lifelong friend the former Italian prime minister Aldo Moro, who had been kidnapped and murdered by Red Brigade terrorists. An anguished Paul, departing from the prepared text of his discourse, took to clamoring, in the manner of the biblical Job, “Why, Lord?” Retreating afterward to the papal summer palace at Castel Gandolfo, he was stricken with arthritis and died after suffering a heart attack. Always a meticulous planner, he left specific instructions for his funeral and his burial, which required an excavation of the floor of the crypt of St. Peter’s Basilica in order to lay him in the earth. Sudden death. Popes who died of illness had, to a greater or lesser extent, some time to prepare for their end; other pontiffs have not been as fortunate. Catholic tradition, in fact, has tended to look upon sudden death as a misfortune, since the deceased would not have had the opportunity to prepare for that definitive accounting for their deeds. The traditional form of the Litany of the Saints even has an invocation against this potential calamity: “A subitanea et improvisa morte líbera nos, Dómine” (“From a sudden and unforeseen death deliver us, O Lord”). Nicholas II (1058–1061) was a reformer who continued the long struggle to free the Church from the entanglements of lay investiture, whereby the German emperors and other secular rulers sought to assert their suzerainty over the spiritual realm. He died in Florence, presumably from shock, when he received word that a synod of German bishops close to the imperial court declared his reforms null and broke communion with him. He was buried near Stephen IX (X) in the church of San Reparata. Hadrian IV (1154–1159), the only Englishman ever elected pope, asserted the monarchical claims of the papacy against both the Roman mobs and the Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. Withdrawing to the stronghold of Anagni, he entered into an alliance with the Lombard cities and was preparing to pronounce a sentence of excommunication against the emperor when he died suddenly, having only the time to commend his aged mother to the charity of the Church of Canterbury before expiring. He was buried in the crypt of the Vatican Basilica. When his tomb was opened in 1607, during the reconstruction of St. Peter’s, his body, clothed in black vestments, was found not to have decayed. Gregory VIII (1187) reigned for just fifty-seven days before dying of a heart attack at Pisa while trying to mediate a dispute between that city and Genoa. Some contemporary chroniclers interpreted his sudden death as divine retribution for his having stopped en route to Pisa at a poor monastery in Lucca and\n\n24\n\nheirs of the fisherman\n\nordered the opening of the tomb there of the antipope Victor IV (1159–1164), whose remains were thrown out of the church. A similar interpretation was found when the Duomo of Pisa caught fire in 1595 and Gregory’s tomb and body were consumed in the conflagration. Innocent III (1198–1216) was perhaps the most brilliant and commanding of the medieval popes. He had an exalted view of his position as Vicar of Christ, a title he preferred to the “Vicar of St. Peter” employed by his predecessors, seeing it as “set midway between God and man, below God but above man,” given “not only the universal Church, but the whole world to govern” with a “plenitude of power.” Innocent energetically applied himself to making this theocratic ideal a reality, reasserting control over the Papal States and forcing the monarchs of Europe to recognize his judgments. Among those he thus brought to submission was King John of England, whom he excommunicated in 1209 for refusing to accept Stephen Langton as archbishop of Canterbury. In 1213, John capitulated and paid homage to the pope, handing his English and Irish domains over to the Apostolic See as a fief. Subsequently, acting as John’s overlord, Innocent declared the Magna Carta void as having been improperly extorted from a papal vassal by the barons without papal consent. A reformer, he patronized the early beginnings of both the Franciscan and Dominican orders, first commissioning the latter to first preach against the Albigensians in southern France and then sending a crusade against the heretics when his legate was murdered. The Fourth Lateran Council, which met under his guidance, confirmed previous reforms, defined the Eucharist in terms of transubstantiation, and legislated the requirement that Catholics confess at least once a year. Traveling to settle another dispute between Pisa and Genoa, he died suddenly at Perugia after complaining of indigestion and then lapsing into a fever. He was only fifty-six. Although he was buried originally in Perugia, his remains were moved to the Lateran Basilica in 1891. Nicholas III (1277–1280) was elected pope by voting for himself after the seven cardinals who made up the conclave bickered for some six months, with three backing him and three fiercely opposing him. His price for recognizing the election of the first Habsburg emperor, Rudolf I, was Rudolf ’s abandonment of all imperial claims to territory in Romagna. Thus Nicholas enlarged the papal domain to the frontiers that it was to hold until the mid-nineteenth century. He carried out a restoration of St. Peter’s Basilica and became the first pope to make the Vatican his residence. In the midst of his activities, he suffered a stroke and died at his new summer residence at Soriano, near Viterbo, where he was mediating a dispute between Rudolf of Habsburg and Charles of Anjou, the ruler of Sicily. His body was buried in the Orsini family chapel that he had constructed in St. Peter’s Basilica. Dante, however, was not impressed by this worldly-minded pontiff, consigning him to hell in Canto XIX of Inferno.25\n\nthe pope is dead!\n\n25\n\nMartin V (1417–1431), the sole member of the powerful Colonna family to become pope, was elected after the Council of Constance, called to end the Great Schism, deposed the antipopes John XXIII and Benedict XIII and received the abdication of Gregory XII (1406–1415). Although he carried out some limited reforms, Martin dedicated himself to reasserting papal authority both within the Church and in the Papal States. He showed a toleration for Jews remarkable for his age, denouncing violent anti-Jewish preaching and legislating a ban on the baptism of Jewish children under the age of twelve. He died suddenly of apoplexy and is buried in the Lateran Basilica, where his brass effigy can still be seen. Paul V (1605–1621) was a dedicated religious reformer. During his pontificate, he raised to the altar some of the great figures of the Catholic Counter-Reformation, canonizing Charles Borromeo and beatifying Ignatius Loyola, Francis Xavier, Philip Neri, and Teresa of Avila. He encouraged missions and even approved the use of the vernacular in the liturgy in China, a forward-looking step not to be fully implemented until the Second Vatican Council in the late twentieth century. On the other hand, he censured Galileo Galilei in 1616 for teaching the Copernican theory and had the Congregation of the Index suspend Copernicus’s treatise “until corrected.” The first pope who belonged completely to the Baroque age, he completed the nave, portico, and façade of St. Peter’s Basilica, immortalizing his name, as well as that of his family and native city, in six-foot high bronze letters there: Paulus V Burghesius Romanus. During his reign, he favored his family; his largesse permitted his nephew Cardinal Scipioni to build the Villa Borghese. He suffered a stroke during a procession held to celebrate the defeat of the Bohemian Calvinists by Catholic forces under the Habsburgs at the Battle of the White Mountain and died of a second stroke shortly thereafter. He was buried in the magnificent Borghese family chapel in the Basilica of St. Mary Major. John Paul I (1978), the “Smiling Pope” elected to succeed the sad Paul VI, reigned only a month before he died of a heart attack. A humble man, impatient with pomp and ceremony, he dispensed with the traditional papal coronation, choosing instead to be invested with the pallium, a woolen band worn by metropolitan archbishops, as a sign of his pastoral office. The confused conduct of Vatican officials during the interregnum following his death—to be discussed subsequently—as well as their refusal to permit an autopsy fueled wild speculation that he had been killed to prevent an investigation of the Institute for Religious Works (as the Vatican bank is officially known) and the demotion of important curial figures. The evidence produced, however, in volumes such as British journalist David Yallop’s sensationalistic bestseller, In God’s Name, is rather questionable and based principally on improbable presumptions.26 He was buried simply in the crypt of the Vatican Basilica.\n\n26\n\nheirs of the fisherman\n\nAccidents. If most pontiffs have died of natural causes, succumbing to old age or illness (prolonged or sudden), others have met less peaceful ends. Two popes are known to have died accidental deaths. John XXI (1276–1277) was the only physician ever elected to the papal throne. The son of a Portuguese doctor, he studied at the University of Paris before becoming a professor of medicine at the new University of Siena. It was his medical knowledge that opened for him the path of preferment, leading eventually to his becoming the personal physician of Pope Gregory X (1271–1276), who made him a cardinal. Although as a curial prelate he participated in the governance of the Church, his principal interests remained scientific and philosophical. His essay The Eye was one of Western medicine’s earliest treatises on ophthalmology, and he was also the author of a popular manual on curing illnesses entitled The Poor Man’s Treasury. Upon election, owing to some confusion regarding the enumeration of the popes called John during the tenth and eleventh centuries, he adopted the style “John XXI,” even though there had never been a “John XX.” Even as pope, he had no intention of giving up his academic pursuits, delegating most of his responsibilities to Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, later Pope Nicholas III, and retired to a cell he had constructed in the back of the papal palace at Viterbo to house his extensive library. The roof of the hastily built study collapsed on him, and he died a few days later from the injuries sustained and was buried in the Duomo of Viterbo. Dante placed John in the “heaven of the Sun” in Canto XII of Paradiso.27 Pius VII (1800–1823), a Benedictine monk and theologian, was elected pope in a conclave held in Venice under Austrian protection in the midst of the wars of the French Revolution. Although he tried to conciliate the opposing sides, coming to terms with revolutionary France within the limits permissible by Catholic principles, he ultimately fell out with the Emperor Napoleon, who had him arrested and carried off into exile in France. The pope’s personal prestige, as well as that of the papal institution, was enhanced by his harsh captivity, which he bore with the discipline and courage of his Benedictine monastic training. After Napoleon’s defeat, the magnanimous pontiff, restored to his dominions, gave refuge in Rome to the relatives of his fallen persecutor. He restored the Jesuits in 1814, despite opposition from some of the powers. Pius died as a result of complications from a broken hip, injured during a fall. As he lay dying, an accidental fire destroyed the ancient Basilica of St. Paul-outside-the-Walls on the night of July 16, 1832. News of the tragedy, however, was withheld from the pope, who died on July 20, for fear that it would add to his burdens since the Benedictine monastery there had been his home in his youth. His monument in the Vatican Basilica was the final tribute of his longtime faithful secretary of state, Cardinal Ercole Consalvi, who sold all of his own possessions to pay for it.\n\nthe pope is dead!\n\n27\n\nMartyrdom. The Church’s existence during the early centuries was repeatedly menaced by local as well as general persecutions instituted by the Roman state. The lives of many of the first occupants of the papal office were, as a consequence, lost to martyrdom. The Liber Pontificalis, the most ancient chronicle of the bishops of Rome and the source for the dating used by the official Annuario Pontificio published by the Holy See, lists almost all the popes before Constantine the Great’s Edict of Milan (313) as martyrs. However, a more careful study of the historical record, while in no way detracting from the challenge of the persecutions and their importance in the development of the early Church (recall Tertullian’s observation that “sanguis martyrum semen christianorum,” “the blood of martyrs is the seed of Christians”), verifies only part of the hagiography. Nonetheless, it is reasonably certain that the following popes were martyrs: St. Peter (died c. 64–67), the “Prince of the Apostles” whom Jesus Christ declared to be “the Rock” and to whom he entrusted the “keys of the kingdom of heaven” (Matthew 16), was the first head of the Roman Church, arriving in the imperial capital somewhere around the year 42. The importance of his preaching and death in that city to Catholicism’s self-understanding is underlined in the very first paragraph of Pope John Paul II’s constitution Universi Dominici gregis, which governs the procedure for the death of a pope and the election of his successor: “The Shepherd of the Lord’s whole flock is the Bishop of the Church of Rome, where the Blessed Apostle Peter, by sovereign disposition of divine Providence, offered to Christ the supreme witness of martyrdom by the shedding of his blood.” According to tradition, Peter fled Rome at the start of the persecution that broke out after the Emperor Nero set the city on fire and, when confronted with the anger of the Roman mob, passed the blame to the nascent Christian community. As he headed south on the Via Appia, the legend has it, he encountered Jesus heading in the opposite direction. Peter questioned him in Latin, “Quo vadis, Dómine?” (“Where are you going, Lord?”) and received the answer, “I am going to Rome to be crucified once more.” Understanding these words to be both a reproach of his flight and a prophecy of his death, Peter returned to the city, where he was arrested and condemned to death. Supposedly, as a miraculous commemoration of the prodigious encounter, Jesus left his footprints impressed in a stone that can still be seen in the Church of Quo Vadis, near the catacombs of St. Sebastian and St. Callistus on the Appian Way. The legend inspired the great Polish author Henryk Sienkiewicz to write his novel Quo Vadis, which was turned into the screenplay for the Hollywood blockbuster of the same title. In any event, Peter was crucified near the circus of Nero, on the Vatican Hill. He was hung upside down at his own request, as he did not deem himself worthy to die in the same manner as his Lord. He was buried in the nearby cemetery.\n\n28\n\nheirs of the fisherman\n\nAfter the persecutions, the Emperor Constantine built a basilica over the tomb. Successive constructions buried the site of the apostle’s burial, but excavations ordered by Pope Pius XII, the results of which were announced by Pope Paul VI, have rediscovered, under the main altar of St. Peter’s Basilica, an ancient sepulcher with a chest containing the bones of a first-century man that bear signs consistent with those of the first pope’s martyrdom. St. Alexander I (c. 109–c. 116), the sixth pope, was traditionally credited with the insertion of the narrative of the Last Supper into the Christian eucharistic celebration and the introduction of the practice of blessing houses with water mixed with salt. According to ancient tradition, he was beheaded on the Via Nomentana, which leads northeast out of Rome. St. Callistus (217–222) was the principal deacon and advisor to his predecessor, St. Zephyrinus (198/9–217). He acquired and administered the Roman Church’s great cemetery, now known as the Catacombs of St. Callistus, on the Appian Way. His election as bishop of Rome was disputed by his rival, the priest St. Hippolytus, who, before finally reconciling, provoked the first schism in the papacy, becoming the first antipope. He was martyred in Trastevere, traditionally at a spot to the right of the main altar of the present-day Basilica of Santa Maria in Trastevere. His tomb, decorated with frescoes depicting his martyrdom, was discovered on the Via Aurelia by archaeologists in 1960. St. Sixtus II (257–258) was elected just as the Emperor Valerian abandoned his earlier policy of toleration in favor of a persecution of those who refused to take part in state religious sacrifices. He advanced the Roman theological position, against the churches of North Africa and Asia Minor, that baptism, properly administered, was valid regardless of who did the ministering. Shortly after Valerian published a supplementary persecution edict, ordering the summary execution of Christian bishops, priests, and deacons, Sixtus was surprised, seated in his episcopal throne, addressing a congregation gathered for the liturgy in the cemetery of Praetextatus. He was beheaded with the four deacons attending him. Two of the remaining three deacons were caught and executed the same day, while the seventh deacon, St. Lawrence, was martyred four days later. The long-celebrated liturgical feasts of St. Linus (c. 67–c. 78), St. Evaristus (c. 100–c. 109), St. Sixtus I (c. 116–c. 125), St. Telesphorus (c. 125–136), St. Hyginus (c. 138–142), St. Pius I (c. 142–c. 155), St. Anicetus (c. 155–c. 166), St. Soter (c. 166–c. 174), St. Eleutherius (c. 174–189), St. Victor I (189–198), St. Zephyrinus (198/9–217), St. Urban I (222–230), St. Lucius I (253–254), St. Stephen I (254–257), St. Felix I (269–274), St. Gaius (283–296), St. Marcellinus (296–304), St. Marcellus I (306–308), and St. Miltiades (311–314) were suppressed in the 1970 revision of the Roman Calendar for want of documentation on their supposed martyrdoms.\n\nthe pope is dead!\n\n29\n\nMurders and assassinations. The Edict of Constantine, while ending the creation of martyrs by non-Christians, did not put an end to the line of martyr popes. Three popes, in fact, suffered martyrdom at the hands of fellow Christians. St. John I (523–526) was sent by the Ostrogothic king of Italy, Theodoric, an Arian, to intercede with the Emperor Justin I for Arians in the Byzantine Empire. Although John was received triumphantly into Constantinople and given the place of honor in Hagia Sophia, his embassy failed to achieve its goals, for which Theodoric imprisoned him in Ravenna upon his return to Italy. His body was taken back to Rome and buried in St. Peter’s Basilica, where he was venerated as a martyr. St. Silverius (536–537), son of Pope St. Hormisdas (514–523), was the victim of the intrigues of his eventual successor, Vigilius (537–555), and the Byzantine general Belisarius. Vigilius succeeded in having him exiled to Anatolia after the conquest of Rome by Belisarius, only to see him returned by the Byzantine court. Vigilius then arranged to have Silverius fall into his hands, deporting the pope under guard of his own agents to the island of Palmaria in the Gulf of Gaeta, where the pontiff died of starvation. St. Martin I (649–653) was arrested by Constans II for having defended the orthodox Christian faith against the Monothelitism favored by the emperor. Tried on trumped-up charges in Constantinople, he was flogged and deported to Chersonesus in the Crimea (near present-day Sevastopol), where he died from the combined effects of cold, starvation, and harsh treatment.28 Other popes, especially in that low period commonly denominated as the “Dark Ages,” have died violently. However, these were not martyrs, who suffered as the classical definition had it, because of hatred for the faith, but rather the unfortunate victims of political ambition and rivalry, court intrigue, or simple mob violence. Sabinian (604–606) had been the legate of his predecessor, St. Gregory I, in Constantinople but was recalled for not being sufficiently firm with the emperor. He nursed a grudge against Gregory that he gave evidence of in a series of verbal assaults on the memory of the deceased. His attacks did little to endear him to the Romans, who had already begun to venerate Gregory as a saint. Reversing Gregory’s policy of giving away grain from the papal stores freely, Sabinian withheld the grain, selling it for profit. This made him so unpopular that a general insurrection broke out, during the course of which he was killed. He was so hated that he was buried in secret somewhere on the grounds of the Lateran complex. John VIII (872–882) struggled valiantly to uphold the traditions of papal leadership even as Italy was torn by dissension from within and raided by Muslim fleets from without. He sanctioned the use of Slavonic in the liturgy by St. Methodius, the Apostle of the Slavs, whom he vindicated, and put an end to the\n\n30\n\nheirs of the fisherman\n\nPhotian Schism with the Eastern Church. He went down in history, however, as the first pope assassinated. The Annals of Fulda record that a member of his entourage poisoned him and, when he did not die fast enough, clubbed him to death. Some historians have speculated that it was John’s alleged effeminate mannerisms and affectations in his personal life that gave rise to the legend of “Pope Joan,” supposedly a female pope. Stephen VI (VII) (896–897) is recalled principally for having presided over the macabre “Cadaver Synod” of January 897. At the instigation of the Emperor Lambert of Spoleto, Stephen had the decaying corpse of his predecessor, Formosus (891–896), the emperor’s relentless foe, exhumed and propped up on a throne in full pontifical vestments. Stephen himself solemnly arraigned his predecessor and then proceeded to convict him of the alleged crime of coveting the papal office as well as perjury and other offenses. The acts and ordinations of Formosus were declared null, and the first three fingers of his right hand (which the late pope used to swear and bless) were hacked off. The body was then thrown into the Tiber, from where it was recovered by a saintly hermit. A few months after the travesty, the enraged supporters of Formosus, encouraged by the reports of miracles worked by the retrieved corpse and interpreting the sudden collapse of the Lateran Basilica as a divine portent, r"
