        "text": "My friend Francesco Palla\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZinnecker, H.\n\nThis is the write-up of an emotional farewell speech dedicated to the memory of Francesco Palla. It briefly summarizes Francesco's scientific legacy and also addresses his human side. Most of all, it describes some of my own memories with Francesco, including various meetings and events where we met (with photos). There are a few personal characteristics about Francesco that were not mentioned at his legacy conference which I find worth mentioning. Finally, we all agree that Francesco should be put among the stars, and some of us have suggested naming an asteroid after him.\n\nFrancesco and masers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMenten, K. M.\n\nMasers in general are signposts of interesting astronomical sources and phenomena. In particular, they are found in the immediate environment of young stellar objects. Abundant observational evidence suggests that H_2O masers arise in the outflows from such sources in their earliest evolutionary phases and are in fact powered by accretion. As such they are intimately connected with the core of Francesco Palla's science. And indeed, H_2O masers were at the start and an essential component of a highly successful research program initiated by Francesco, the identification and characterization of a significant sample of massive young stellar objects. An overview is given of the sustained H_2O maser research program conducted over many years with the Medicina 32-meter radio telescope, in which Francesco played a vital part. Last, but not least, with Steven Stahler, Francesco co-authored an excellent chapter on interstellar masers that formed a part of The Formation of Stars, their classic textbook of the field.\n\nFrancesco's last divertissement: The Little Prince's Universe\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTozzi, P.\n\nThe last accomplishment of Francesco in public outreach, was a book devoted to children, based on the character of the Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry. Francesco completed the text, and Sylvie made the drawings. The book is now finally printed.\n\nPolyglot of the Everyday: Alberto Aguilar\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nLucero, Jorge\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe Chicago-born artist Alberto Aguilar enacts his artworks through video, performance, sound recordings, cooking, photographs, participatory events, drawings, installations, interior design, writing, collage, singing, teaching, conducting interviews, curating, mail-art, being on the Internet, writing, and personal social exchanges (e.g.â¦\n\nInternational Conference on Organometallic Chemistry (13th) Held in Torino, Europe on 4-9 September 1988.

Francesco Borromini: portrait of a tormented soul.\n\nPubMed\n\nCipriani, Gabriele; Cipriani, Luca; Di Fiorino, Mario\n\n2017-09-01\n\nFrancesco Borromini, one of the great geniuses of Baroque architecture, was tormented and solitary, and was increasingly frustrated by the fame and success of his rival, Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Borromini was an unhappy man, constantly dogged by disaster, quarrelling even with his best patrons and closest friends. In the culmination of one of the fits of depression that overcame the architect more and more frequently as his life progressed, Borromini literally fell on his own sword; he lingered in excruciating pain for 24 hours before dying. Largely forgotten, his architecture has again been recognized since the twentieth century as the creation of genius. We try to describe the personality and suicide of this pessimist giant of architecture.\n\nFrom \"Sanhattan\" to \"Nashvegas\": The Aesthetics of Detachment in Alberto Fuguet's Filmmaking\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBarraza, Vania\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis current study focuses on the effects of neoliberalism on the Chilean sociopolitical period of postdictatorship (1990-2010) by studying a new generation of filmmakers in the work of Alberto Fuguet. In the trilogy of \"Se arrienda\" (2005), \"VelÃ³drom\" (2010), and \"MÃºsica campesin\"a (2011), Fuguet reviews theâ¦\n\nSeismology in South America; an interview with Alberto Giesecke\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nSpall, H.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nDr. Alberto A. Giesecke is head of the Instituto Geofisico del Peru, in Lima, Peru, and Director of Centro Regional de Sismologia para America del Sur (CERESIS). The center is dedicated to the coordination and promotion of earthquake hazard mitigation. Dr. Giesecke was President of the National Research Council of Peru and currently is a member of the Board of Directors of the National Institute for Industrial Technological Research and Standards and of the National Institute for Research and Training in Telecommunications. He presided over the Organizing Committee for the General Assemblies of the International Association for Seismology and Physics of the Earth's interor and the International Union for Radio Science held in Lima, Peru, in 1973 and 1975, respectively.Â\n\nFrancesco Fontana and the birth of the astronomical telescope\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMolaro, Paolo\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIn the late 1620s the Neapolitan Francesco Fontana was the first to observe the sky using a telescope with two convex lenses, which he had manufactured himself. Fontana succeeded in drawing the most accurate maps of the Moonâs surface of his time, which were to become popular through a number of publications that appeared throughout Europe but did not acknowledge the author. At the end of 1645, in a state of declining health and pressed by the need to defend his authorship, Fontana carried out an intense observing campaign, the results of which he hurriedly collected in his Novae Coelestium Terrestriumque rerum Observationis (1646), the only public-cation he left for posterity. Fontana observed the Moonâs main craters, such as Tycho (which he referred to as âFons Majorâ), their radial debris patterns and changes in their appearance due to the Moonâs motion. He observed the gibbosity of Mars at quadrature and, together with the Jesuit Giovanni Battista Zupus, he described the phases of Mercury. Fontana observed the twoâand occasionally threeâmajor bands of Jupiter, and inferred the rotation of the major planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, arguing that they could not be attached to an Aristotelian sky. He came close to revealing the ring structure of Saturn. He also suggested the presence of additional moons around Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, which prompted a debate that lasted more than a hundred years. In several places in his book Fontana claimed to have conceived the first positive eyepiece in 1608, and he provides a declaration by Zupus that his telescope was in use from 1614. Finally, we suggest that the telescopes depicted in the two paintings Allegory of Sight and Allegory of Sight and Smell by J. Brueghel the Elder might have been made by Fontana, and that he might by portrayed in the Allegory of Sight by Jusepe Ribera.\n\nFlooding in southeastern United States from tropical storm Alberto, July 1994\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nStamey, Timothy C.; Leavesley, George H.; Lins, Harry F.; Nobilis, Franz; Parker, Randolph S.; Schneider, Verne R.; van de Ven, Frans H.M.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nIn July 1994, parts of central and southwestern Georgia, southeastern Alabama, and the western panhandle of Florida were devastated by floods resulting from rainfall produced by Tropical Storm Alberto. Entire communities were inundated by flood waters as numerous streams reached peak stages and discharges far greater than previous floods in the Flint, Ocmulgee, and Choctawhatchee River basins. The flooding resulted in 33 deaths in towns and small communities along or near the overflowing streams. President Clinton declared 78 counties as Federal disaster areas: 55 in Georgia, 10 in Alabama, and 13 in Florida. The Flint River and Ocmulgee River basins in Georgia experienced floods that exceeded the 100-year recurrence interval discharge along almost their entire lengths. Travel was disrupted as railroad and highway bridges and culverts were overtopped an, in many cases, washed out. Total flood damages to public and private property were estimated at nearly $1 billion dollars. The destruction caused by this storm serves to emphasize the high cost imposed upon life and property by flood disasters; and thus, highlight the importance of preparing for, monitoring, and documenting such occurrences.\n\nA McOndo Writer's Take on Literature in the Era of Audiovisual and Digital Communication: The Case of Alberto Fuguet's \"Las Peliculas de mi vida\"\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMaier, Linda S.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAlberto Fuguet, one of the leaders of the McOndo writers who seek cultural direction from the United States and exploit mass-media formulas, is a polarizing figure in contemporary Latin American culture. His most recent full-length novel, the semi-autobiographical \"Las peliculas de mi vida\" (2003), has led many to conclude that Fuguet is simply aâ¦\n\nThe bust of Francesco II Gonzaga: from digital documentation to 3D printing\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAdami, A.; Balletti, C.; Fassi, F.; Fregonese, L.; Guerra, F.; Taffurelli, L.; Vernier, P.\n\n2015-08-01\n\nGeomatics technics and methods are now able to provide a great contribution to the Cultural Heritage (CH) processes, being adaptable to different purposes: management, diagnosis, restoration, protection, study and research, communication, formation and fruition of the Cultural Heritage. This experimentation was done with an eye to encouraging and promoting the development of principles and good practices for recording, documentation and information management of cultural heritage. This research focuses on the documentation path of a cultural asset, in particular a Renaissance statue, aimed to achieve a three dimensional model useful for many digital applications and for solid reproduction. The digital copy can be used in many contexts and represents an efficient tool to preserve and promote CH. It can be included in virtual museum archives and catalogues, shared on network with cultural operators and users, and it permits the contextualization of the asset in its artistic and historical background. Moreover, the possibility to obtain a hard copy, reproduced through 3D printing, allows to reach new opportunities of interaction with CH. In this article, two techniques for the digitization of the terracotta bust of Francesco II Gonzaga, in the City Museum of Mantua, are described: the triangulation scanner and dense image matching photogrammetry. As well as the description of the acquisition and the elaborations, other aspects are taken into account: the characteristics of the object, the place for the acquisition, the ultimate goal and the economic availability. There are also highlighted the optimization pipeline to get the correct three-dimensional models and a 3D printed copy. A separate section discusses the comparison of the realized model to identify the positive and negative aspects of each adopted application.\n\nNon-invasive techniques for revealing the palette of the Romantic painter Francesco Hayez\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRampazzi, Laura; Brunello, Valentina; Corti, Cristina; Lissoni, Elena\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThis paper describes the first systematic analysis of the palette of Francesco Hayez, one of the most outstanding artists of European Romanticism, whose painting technique has never been extensively investigated despite the plethora of artistic studies. He lived in a particular moment in the history of painting, as in the first half of the 19th century many synthetic pigments were available, also in tin tubes, but traditional materials were still used. Sixteen paintings on canvas and on panels, created between 1823 and 1868, were analyzed in situ through non-invasive techniques (infrared reflectography and infrared reflection spectroscopy). Imaging investigation provided clues on painting technique, revealing some cases of pentimenti and underdrawings. A preliminary survey was carried out on a hundred pure pigments used up to the 19th century and on new synthetic colours, in order to attain reference spectra for the interpretation of painting spectra. The portable infrared instrument provided insight into Hayez's painting materials, identifying barite, ivory black, lead-tin yellow, Naples yellow, ochres, Prussian blue, and white lead. The pigments were often blended, to obtain a unique fabric appearance or to attain cold shades. The results pointed to a siccative oil as a binder, mixed with white lead so that it could act as a catalyzer in polymerization reactions, and in some cases with a proteinaceous binder and resins. The preparation was made with gypsum and white lead mixed with a siccative oil. The results showed that the artist used a typical traditional palette, throughout his career, in order to lead to brilliant colours and with long-term stability. Anyway, the possible presence of cobalt blue in a few paintings suggests that Hayez had probably started testing the new colours, since the second decade of 19th century.\n\nNon-invasive techniques for revealing the palette of the Romantic painter Francesco Hayez.\n\nPubMed\n\nRampazzi, Laura; Brunello, Valentina; Corti, Cristina; Lissoni, Elena\n\n2017-04-05\n\nThis paper describes the first systematic analysis of the palette of Francesco Hayez, one of the most outstanding artists of European Romanticism, whose painting technique has never been extensively investigated despite the plethora of artistic studies.

Chairman of the Department of Ophthalmology of the National University of CÃ³rdoba and founder of the Cornea and Glaucoma Surgical Center in the same city, in 1956 he created the first residency programme in Ophthalmology in his country. He founded the first Eye Bank and introduced one of the first argon laser photocoagulators in South America. He authored around 200 scientific presentations and publications, describing new findings and clinical entities. Thus, his individualisation of the cyclovertical component in strabismus contributed to important evolution of ideas concerning pathogenesis and therapy in oculomotor disorders of infancy. He was the first to propose the dehydration of the vitreous body in glaucoma patients before ocular surgery and developed a fixation pick and scleral depressor for retinal detachment surgery. He also described a new technique, the V-Z procedures for the correction of senile ectropion. In 1968, he published his DÃ©collement de la rÃ©tine, considered a masterpiece in retinal detachment literature for many years. Urrets-ZavalÃ­a died in his native city at the age of 89. His prolific scientific and educational contributions make him one of the most brilliant and influential ophthalmologists of the 20th-century.

Born in CittÃ di Castello, a small town in the region of Umbria, he earned a medical degree from the University of Perugia. While serving in the Ethiopian campaign and in World War II, first as a frontline soldier and then as a physician, he was captured and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in Hereford, Texas. It was there that Burri disavowed the medical profession and began to paint. He held a pivotal position in the modern post-war era, exhibiting in Rome and New York in the early 1950s. The present article describes an in-depth scientific investigation of a selection of 14 paintings by Burri, each belonging to one of his series: Sacchi (sacks), Bianchi (whites), Catrami (tars), Muffe (molds), Gobbi (hunchbacks), Legni (woods), Combustioni plastiche (plastic combustions), Ferri (irons), Cretti (monochromatic fields of induced craquelure), and Cellotex (compositions on flayed fiberboard). Elemental information obtained non-invasively via X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy was here combined with detailed characterization of the pigments, extenders, binders, and plastics by means of micro-invasive techniques, including pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopies, and scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX) spectroscopy. Through the joint use of traditional artists' materials along with industrial products newly introduced to the market, Burri appears to have encapsulated space into highly dramatic compositions at the boundaries between painting and relief sculpture.\n\nReticulospinal neurons in anamniotic vertebrates: a celebration of Alberto Stefanelli's contributions to comparative neuroscience.\n\nPubMed\n\nZottoli, Steven J; Cioni, Carla; Seyfarth, Ernst-August\n\n2007-10-19\n\nOver the past 76 years Alberto Stefanelli has successfully used a comparative approach to study the nervous system. His main research focus during that time has been on identifiable reticulospinal neurons including MÃ¼ller and Mauthner neurons found in anamniotic vertebrates. Born in Venice, Italy in 1908, Professor Stefanelli pursued most of his academic career at the University of Rome, where he retired as Chair of Comparative Anatomy in 1978. His seminal work on the constancy in number and position of giant identifiable reticulospinal neurons in the brains of larval and adult lampreys, and his assertion that only a subset of these neurons were MÃ¼ller cells, provided the framework in which subsequent authors have refined our understanding of the cellular anatomy, axonal projections, physiology, and function of MÃ¼ller cells in the control of movement. Stefanelli has also provided the most comprehensive study to date of the Mauthner cell and its axon cap. His description of the differences in axon cap structure among many fishes and amphibians and his use of the \"morpho-ecological\" approach to determine Mauthner cell function has provided the basis for future studies on the neuronal basis of behavior and its evolution. As Professor Stefanelli approaches his 100th birthday, we celebrate his scientific contributions to comparative neuroscience with a biographical sketch of his life, an overview of his scientific accomplishments, and our view of how his comparative studies continue to contribute to our understanding of the nervous system.\n\n[History of Instituto de Investigaciones CardiolÃ³gicas Alberto C. Taquini in its 60th anniversary].\n\nPubMed\n\nMilei, Jose; Trujillo, Jose Maria\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe Instituto de Investigaciones CardiolÃ³gicas (ININCA) was founded by Alberto C. Taquini in 1944 and directed by him during more than 50 years, until his death in 1998. The Institute was (and still is) dedicated to research in connection with CONICET (National Research Council) and to teaching within the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Buenos Aires. From the very beginning research was centered on hypertension, hypoxia and hemodynamic adaptations, renal physiology and electrolytes, arterial wall, cardiac metabolism, myocardial pharmacology and regulation of the circulation by the central nervous system. On the basis of Taquini's autobiographical notes, the experiments are reported which eventually led to the discovery of hypertensin, angiotensin and their relation with renin, together with the discussions promoted by the diverse hypotheses proposed by both national and international groups of investigators as the mechanism of hypertension. Taquini also played an important role in promoting science at national levels including his role as the first Secretary of Science and Technology from 1968 to 1971. He believed that scientific research is something more than planning and producing, that it also involves creating knowledge. As such he made many contributions to science, formed many disciples, and directed an Institute which is demonstrating its continuity.\n\nMusic and Mind: In Memoriam Professor Carlo Alberto Pagni, MD, PhD: February 13, 1931 -March 1, 2009.\n\nPubMed\n\nvon Wild, Klaus R H\n\n2017-01-01\n\nCarlo Alberto Pagni, born in La Spezia, Italy, on February 13, 1931, was an eminent and respected professor of neurosurgery and chairman of the neurosurgical clinic of the University of Turin from 1980 to 2003. He died on March 1, 2009. As a professor of neurology and neurological surgery he was renowned as an expert on vascular, tumor, and functional neurosurgery. Beyond the Italian Neurosurgical Society, he was the doyen of functional neurosurgery, specializing in motor cortex stimulation for the treatment of focal dystonia, Parkinson's disease, and postictal spasticity and pain. His home was his castle, and his family was fundamental to his life. He shared with his wife, Sandra, his passion for piano playing and for their remarkable library, and together with friends, he and his wife enjoyed dinners with fine food and Barolo wines. Listening to this Grand Seigneur talking about and explaining the music of, above all, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Richard Wagner, one felt he was emotionally just \"music and mind\". You can imagine this from his books on music, chess, and neuroscience. Indeed, he adored playing correspondence chess worldwide. A sportsman too, he loved hiking, mountaineering, skiing, swimming, and fishing. Nature was his source for slowing down, for regenerating, and for collecting his strength for new projects and new challenges. Friends will remember Dr. Pagni as a Grand Seigneur.\n\nJoint Workshop on High Confidence Medical Devices, Software, and Systems (HCMDSS) and Medical Device Plug-and-Play (MD PnP) Interoperability\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2008-05-01\n\nGiacomo Cabri, Francesco De Mola , Letizia Leonardi University of Modena, ITALY Plug-and-Play and Network-Capable Medical Instrumentation and...Janice Crosby CIMIT Steven Dain University of Western Ontario Francesco De Mola University of Modena and Reggio Emilia Ann Demaree CapsuleTech, Inc.

Normally each of these techniques provides only partial information about the environment, while combined investigations could reveal new phenomena occurring in complex systems such as in-vitro neuronal networks. Aiming at the merging of optical and electrical investigations of biological samples, we introduced three-dimensional plasmonic nanoantennas on CMOS-based electrical sensors [1]. The overall device is then capable of enhanced Raman Analysis of cultured cells combined with electrical recording of neuronal activity. The Raman measurements show a much higher sensitivity when performed on the tip of the nanoantenna in respect to the flat substrate [2]; this effect is a combination of the high plasmonic field enhancement and of the tight adhesion of cells on the nanoantenna tip. Furthermore, when plasmonic opto-poration is exploited [3] the 3D nanoelectrodes are able to penetrate through the cell membrane thus accessing the intracellular environment. Our latest results (unpublished) show that the technique is completely non-invasive and solves many problems related to state-of-the-art intracellular recording approaches on large neuronal networks.

Comments on the criminal process dealing with the murder of Johann Joachim Winckelmann from the forensic historical and legal medicine viewpoint].\n\nPubMed\n\nRisse, M; Weiler, G\n\n2001-01-01\n\nJohann Joachim Winckelmann, German historian of ancient art and archaeologist, was born on 9 December 1717 in Stendal, a town in Saxony-Anhalt. At the age of 50 he was murdered on 8 June 1768 in a Trieste hotel. The voluminous original record of the criminal proceedings against his murderer, Francesco Arcangeli, was presumed lost for about 150 years. A new edition in the wording of the original text appeared in 1964. This long sought historical document gives cause for forensic-historical reflections under consideration of the autopsy protocol about Winckelmann, which is likewise a historical document. A considerable change of paradigm in comparison to current autopsy protocols is observed with regard to the evaluation of injuries and the circumstances of death.\n\nHow stands collapse I\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPearle, Philip\n\n2007-03-01\n\nIn this volume in honour of GianCarlo Ghirardi, I discuss my involvement with ideas of dynamical collapse of the state vector. Ten problems are introduced, nine of which were seen following my initial work. Four of these problems had a resolution in GianCarlo Ghirardi, Alberto Rimini and Tullio Weber's spontaneous localization (SL) model (which added one more problem). This stimulated a (somewhat different) resolution of these five problems in the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model, in which I combined my initial work with SL. In an upcoming volume in honour of Abner Shimony, I shall discuss the status of the remaining five post-CSL problems.\n\nList of Participants\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2011-08-01\n\nAbigail Alvarez OlarteCINVESTAV Alba Leticia Carrillo MonteverdeDCI-UG Alberto CarramiÃ±anaINAOE Aldo MorselliFERMI Alejandro CastillaDCI-UG Alejandro IbarraTechnical University of Munich Alma D Rojas PachecoFCFM-BUAP Alma Xochitl Gonzalez MoralesInstituto de Ciencias Nucleares, UNAM Andrew Walcott BeckwithAmerican Institute of Beam Energy Physics Ariadna Montiel ArenasDepartamento de FÃ­sica, CINVESTAV Arnulfo ZepedaCinvestav Arturo Alvarez CruzInstituto de Fisica, UNAM Axel de la MacorraUNAM, IAC Azar MustafayevUniversity of Minnesota Benjamin JaramilloDCI-UG Vincent BertinCPPM-Marseille Carlos Alberto Vaquera-AraujoDCI-UG Carlos MuÃ±ozMadrid Autonoma U. & Madrid, IFT Carmine PagliaroneINFN, FNAL Carolina Lujan PeschardDCI-UG Christiane Frigerio MartinsUniversidade Federal do ABC-SÃ£o Paulo Csaba BalazsMonash University David DelepineDCI-UG David G CerdenoUniversidad Autonoma de Madrid & Instituto de Fisica Teorica Debasish MajumdarSaha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata, India Dibyendu PanigrahiKandi Raj College, Kandi, Murshidabad, INDIA-742137 Dupret Alberto Santana BejaranoUniversidad de Sonora Departamento de Investigacion en Fisica Ernest MaRiverside U.C.

The first period includes the contributions to parasitology by savants who operated during the Roman, medieval and Renaissance eras; the second period started in 1668 when Francesco Redi published his experiments to debunk the theory of spontaneous generation; the work of Redi was subsequently continued by Vallisnieri, Spallanzani and others. The latter period includes classic contributions in the field of parasitology provided by veterinarians such as Ercolani, Perroncito, Piana and Rivolta, and by physicians such as Bassi, Grassi, Golgi, and Celli. Also, two outstanding pages of medical parasitology were written during this period--the unraveling and defeat of St. Gotthard's disease and the conquering of malaria on Italian soil--both accomplished through the generous efforts of dedicated individuals.\n\nFamous head injuries of the first aerial war: deaths of the \"Knights of the Air\".\n\nPubMed\n\nKoul, Prateeka; Mau, Christine; Sabourin, Victor M; Gandhi, Chirag D; Prestigiacomo, Charles J\n\n2015-07-01\n\nWorld War I advanced the development of aviation from the concept of flight to the use of aircraft on the battlefield. Fighter planes advanced technologically as the war progressed. Fighter pilot aces Francesco Baracca and Manfred von Richthofen (the Red Baron) were two of the most famous pilots of this time period. These courageous fighter aces skillfully maneuvered their SPAD and Albatros planes, respectively, while battling enemies and scoring aerial victories that contributed to the course of the war. The media thrilled the public with their depictions of the heroic feats of fighter pilots such as Baracca and the Red Baron. Despite their aerial prowess, both pilots would eventually be shot down in combat. Although the accounts of their deaths are debated, it is undeniable that both were victims of traumatic head injury.\n\n['Negative' eugenics, psychiatry, and Catholicism: clashes over eugenic sterilization in Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nWegner, Robert; Souza, Vanderlei SebastiÃ£o de\n\n2013-03-01\n\nThe article analyzes the dialogue between eugenicist Renato Kehl and a group of Brazilian psychiatrists who turned their interest to so-called negative eugenics in the early 1930s. Enthused about research into eugenics and the application of eugenic methods in countries such as the United States and Germany, authors like Ernani Lopes, IgnÃ¡cio da Cunha Lopes, Alberto Farani, and Antonio Carlos Pacheco e Silva blamed Catholicism for impeding Brazil from moving in a similar direction, especially the church's resistance to the sterilization of 'degenerates', which entered into effect in Germany in 1934. The article charts the various strategies these authors proposed for engaging in dialogue with the Catholic Church.\n\nYes, the baby should live: a pro-choice response to Giubilini and Minerva.\n\nPubMed\n\nManninen, Bertha Alvarez\n\n2013-05-01\n\nIn their paper 'After-birth abortion: why should the baby live?' Alberto Giubilini and Francesca Minerva argue that because there are no significant differences between a fetus and a neonate, in that neither possess sufficiently robust mental traits to qualify as persons, a neonate may be justifiably killed for any reason that also justifies abortion. To further emphasise their view that a newly born infant is more on a par with a fetus rather than a more developed baby, Giubilini and Minerva elect to call this 'after-birth abortion' rather than infanticide. In this paper, I argue that their thesis is incorrect, and that the moral permissibility of abortion does not entail the moral permissibility of 'after-birth' abortion.\n\nPro-Life Arguments Against Infanticide and Why they are Not Convincing.\n\nPubMed\n\nRÃ¤sÃ¤nen, Joona\n\n2016-11-01\n\nAlberto Giubilini and Francesca Minerva's controversial article 'After-Birth Abortion: Why Should the Baby Live?' has received a lot of criticism since its publishing. Part of the recent criticism has been made by pro-life philosopher Christopher Kaczor, who argues against infanticide in his updated book 'Ethics of Abortion'. Kaczor makes four arguments to show where Giubilini and Minerva's argument for permitting infanticide goes wrong. In this article I argue that Kaczor's arguments, and some similar arguments presented by other philosophers, are mistaken and cannot show Giubilini and Minerva's view to be flawed. I claim that if one wants to reject the permissibility of infanticide, one must find better arguments for doing so.

On admission, 44.2% (199/450) of patients were assigned a red or yellow color code requiring immediate medical attention; about 14% of them required additional medical assistance (after being in the ED) or hospitalization, some in semi-intensive care units. Our study shows that the increased numbers of hospitalizations due to alcohol intoxication in the adolescent age group, as a consequence of NekNominate or other drinking games, is alarming and represents a serious public health issue. The potential markers of improper use of social networks must be clearly identified, including categories at risk of alcohol abuse, in order to develop intervention and prevention strategies in terms of education and awareness, which may help in averting potentially fatal episodes.

We introduce bnstruct, an open source R package to (i) learn the structure and the parameters of a Bayesian Network from data in the presence of missing values and (ii) perform reasoning and inference on the learned Bayesian Networks. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other open source software that provides methods for all of these tasks, particularly the manipulation of missing data, which is a common situation in practice. The software is implemented in R and C and is available on CRAN under a GPL licence. francesco.sambo@unipd.it. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. Â© The Author 2016.

It is therefore surprising that the first systematic treatise exclusively devoted to it appeared as late as 1612. In this article I explore the experimental background of Antonio Neri's L'Arte Vetraria, and its intimate connection with an ancient alchemical tradition and with more contemporary efforts to introduce technical innovations. Furthermore, the active role played by Antonio Neri, a clergyman and alchemist in the service of Antonio de' Medici, sheds new light on the patronage of the Medici court. This article aims at contextualizing Neri's book within the Florentine tradition of glassmaking and, above all, within Francesco I de Medici's alchemical interests in this art. Finally, the almost contemporary publication of Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius and Neri's L'Arte Vetraria raises the question of the role played by alchemists like Neri and by Florentine glassmakers in the making of optical instruments.\n\nFrancisco VallÃ©s and the Renaissance reinterpretation of Aristotle's Meteorologica IV as a medical text.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartin, Craig\n\n2002-01-01\n\nIn this paper I describe the context and goals of Francisco VallÃ©s In IV librum Meteorologicorum commentaria (1558). VallÃ©s' work stands as a landmark because it interprets a work of Aristotle's natural philosophy specifically for medical doctors and medical theory. VallÃ©s' commentary is representative of new understandings of Galenic-Hippocratic medicine that emerged as a result of expanding textual knowledge. These approaches are evident in a number of sixteenth-century commentaries on Meteorologica IV; in particular the works of Pietro Pomponazzi, Lodovico Boccadiferro, Jacob Schegk, and Francesco Vimercati. VallÃ©s' conviction that Meteorologica IV is relevant to medical knowledge depends on his understanding of Aristotle's theory of homeomerous substances and their relation to composite substances. The application of Meteorologica IV to medical topics became commonplace in the following years, and this Aristotelian book became widely known as a bridge between natural philosophy and medicine.\n\nSunspot Positions and Areas from Observations by Galileo Galilei\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVokhmyanin, M. V.; Zolotova, N. V.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nSunspot records in the seventeenth century provide important information on the solar activity before the Maunder minimum, yielding reliable sunspot indices and the solar butterfly diagram. Galilei's letters to Cardinal Francesco Barberini and Marcus Welser contain daily solar observations on 3 - 11 May, 2 June - 8 July, and 19 - 21 August 1612. These historical archives do not provide the time of observation, which results in uncertainty in the sunspot coordinates. To obtain them, we present a method that minimizes the discrepancy between the sunspot latitudes. We provide areas and heliographic coordinates of 82 sunspot groups. In contrast to Sheiner's butterfly diagram, we found only one sunspot group near the Equator. This provides a higher reliability of Galilei's drawings. Large sunspot groups are found to emerge at the same longitude in the northern hemisphere from 3 May to 21 August, which indicates an active longitude.\n\nBernardino Ramazzini: the father of occupational medicine.\n\nPubMed\n\nPope, Malcolm H\n\n2004-10-15\n\nBernardino Ramazzini was born on October 4, 1633, in the small town of Capri located in the duchy of Modula, Italy. He is credited with establishing the field of occupational medicine during his lifetime. His major contributions came after 1682, when Duke Francesco II of Modena assigned him to establish a medical department at the University of Modena. He was installed in the title of professor \"Medicinae Theoricae.\" In 1700, Ramazzini was appointed chair of practical medicine in Padua, Republic of Venice, the premier medical faculty in Italy. In 1700, he wrote the seminal book on occupational diseases and industrial hygiene, De Morbis Artificum Diatriba (Diseases of Workers). Although Ramazzini is perhaps most well known for his work on exposure to toxic materials, he wrote extensively about diseases of the musculoskeletal system. In particular, he warned of the problems of inactivity and poor postures inherent in some jobs.\n\nINTESTINAL LIFE CYCLE OF EIMERIA CALIGINOSA (APICOMPLEXA: EIMERIIDAE) FROM THE DUSKY RICE RAT, MELANOMYS CALIGINOSUS (RODENTIA: CRICETIDAE: SIGMODONTINAE) IN COSTA RICA.\n\nPubMed\n\nChinchilla, Misael; Valerio, Idalia; Sanchez, Ronald; Duszynski, Donald\n\n2018-05-08\n\nThe endogenous life cycle of Eimeria caliginosa was studied in experimentally-infected dusky rice rats, Melanomys caliginosus. All endogenous stages were located in the epithelial cells of villi in the small intestine. Both Giemsa-stained mucosal scrapings and histological sections were studied for the diagnosis of all the life cycle stages. Eimeria caliginosa has 3 generations of meronts (M) that differ by size, shape, and number of merozoites (m), which also differ in their size, shape, and location of their nuclei within the cytoplasm of the meronts. The 3 meront types, M1-M3, respectively, had 20-33 (m1), 5-9 (m2), and 13-16 (m3) merozoites. Macrogametocytes and microgametocytes, as well as macrogametes and microgametes, completed the sexual cycle, which conclude with the formation of unsporulated oocysts. This parasite's endogenous development produced severe intestinal lesions in the experimentally-infected dusky rice rats. In our ongoing work to understand the biodiversity present in plants and animals of our protected Reserva BiolÃ³gica Alberto Manuel Brenes (ReBAMB) field station in Costa Rica, we now have discovered 3 new Eimeria species, and this is the second complete life cycle in which we document both the asexual and sexual stages The presence of Eimeria caliginosa was discovered in Costa Rica, in the dusky rice rat, Melanomys caliginosus (Tomes, 1860), captured in the protected Reserva BiolÃ³gica Alberto Manuel Brenes (ReBAMB) in San RamÃ³n, Alajuela, Costa Rica (Chinchilla et al. 2014). The original description was based on sporulated oocyst characteristics, but there was no information known about this parasite or its life history at the time of our discovery. Now, using careful experimental protocols, we are able to offer a description of the endogenous stages of the intestinal life cycle of E. caliginosa in M. caliginosus were able to determine the prepatent and patent periods, and we were able to make some observations about the intestinal\n\nPerformance of the CMS muon detector and muon reconstruction with proton-proton collisions at $$\\\\sqrt{s}=$$ 13 TeV\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nSirunyan, Albert M; et al.\n\n2018-06-19\n\nThe CMS muon detector system, muon reconstruction software, and high-level trigger underwent significant changes in 2013-2014 in preparation for running at higher LHC collision energy and instantaneous luminosity.

The measured performance parameters, including spatial resolution, efficiency, and timing, are found to meet all design specifications and are well reproduced by simulation. Despite the more challenging running conditions, the modified muon system is found to perform as well as, and in many aspects better than, previously. We dedicate this paper to the memory of Prof. Alberto Benvenuti, whose work was fundamental for the CMS muon detector.Â«Â less\n\nRotationally inelastic cross sections, rates and cooling times for para-H2 +, ortho-D2 + and HD+ in cold helium gas\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVera, Mario HernÃ¡ndez; Schiller, Stephan; Wester, Roland; Gianturco, Francesco Antonio\n\n2017-05-01\n\nIn the present work we discuss the dynamical processes guiding the relaxation of the internal rotational energy of three diatomic ions, the para-H2+, the ortho-D2+ and the HD+ in collision with He atoms. The state-changing cross sections and rates for these Molecular Hydrogen Ions (MHIs) are obtained from Close Coupling quantum dynamics calculations and the decay times into their respective ground states are computed by further solving the relevant time-evolution equations. The comparison of the results from the three molecules allows us to obtain a detailed understanding, and a deep insight, on the relative efficiencies of the relaxation processes considered.

In June, Fujimori appointed Amado Yataco Minister of Energy and Mines. Yataco, also serving as president of the privatization commission Copri, said a decision on the sale of Petroperu would be made quickly, perhaps by July 28, ahead of this report`s presstime. The uncertain status of Petroperu has not, however, slowed activity in Peru`s petroleum sector. The paper first discusses privatization plans and Petroperu`s budget, then describes exploration and development activitiesmoreÂ Â» in the supergiant Camisea gas/condensate fields in the central southern jungle. Activities in several smaller fields are briefly described.Â«Â less\n\nReduced food intake after exposure to subtle weight-related cues.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrunner, Thomas A; Siegrist, Michael\n\n2012-06-01\n\nThis research investigated the influence of weight-related cues on food intake. The first study used a screensaver showing three of the famous skinny human-like sculptures by Alberto Giacometti and found that participants in this condition consumed less chocolate than when they were exposed to a more neutral work of art. In the second study, participants had to indicate their body weight either before or after the tasting. Reporting their weight before the tasting resulted in reduced food intake. A gender effect was found for the second but not the first study. We suggest that the cues in the two studies might have been processed with different levels of awareness, which might explain the gender effect found in the second study.

Napoli, December 5thâ6 th2011â\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nAfter more than 30 years, landmark progress has been made in the treatment of cancer, and melanoma in particular, with the success of new molecules such as ipilimumab, vemurafenib and active specific immunization. After the first congress in December 2010, the second edition of âMelanoma Research: a bridge from Naples to the Worldâ meeting, organized by Paolo A. Ascierto (INT, Naples, Italy), Francesco M. Marincola (NIH, Bethesda, USA), and Nicola Mozzillo (INT, Naples, Italy) took place in Naples, on 5â6 December 2011. We have identified four new topics of discussion: Innovative Approaches in Prevention, Diagnosis and Surgical Treatment, New Pathways and Targets in Melanoma: An Update about Immunotherapy, and Combination Strategies. This international congress gathered more than 30 international faculty members and was focused on recent advances in melanoma molecular biology, immunology and therapy, and created an interactive atmosphere which stimulated discussion of new approaches and strategies in the field of melanoma.

In Naples itself, these scientific debates were not confined to academies, courts, and urban spaces. In the absence of well-equipped chemical laboratories, Neapolitan scholars also carried out research on chemistry on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius, a natural site that furnished them with all the tools and substances necessary for practising chemistry. By examining various Neapolitan publications on Vesuvius and the chemical reactions and products associated with its periodic eruptions, I argue that the volcano's presence contributed to a distinctive, local approach to chemical theory and practice. Several case studies examine the ways in which proximity to Vesuvius was exploited by Neapolitan scholars as they engaged with the new chemistry, including Giuseppe Vairo, Michele Ferrara, Francesco Semmola, and Emanuele Scotti.\n\nOn the Time of the Intellect: The Interpretation of De Anima 3.6 (43ob 7-20) in Renaissance and Early Modern Italian Philosophy.\n\nPubMed\n\nDubouclez, Olivier\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis article argues that an original debate over the relationship between time and the intellect took place in Northern Italy in the second half of the sixteenth century, which was part of a broader reflection on the temporality of human mental acts. While human intellectual activity was said to be 'above time' during the Middle Ages, Renaissance scholars such as Marcantonio Genua (1491-1563), Giulio Castellani (1528-1586), Antonio Montecatini (1537-1599) and Francesco Piccolomini (1520-1604), greatly influenced by the Simplician and Alexandrist interpretations of Aristotle's works, proposed alterna- tive conceptions based on the interpretation of De anima 3.6 (430b 7-20) according to which intellectual acts happen in a both 'undivided' and 'divisible time'. In order to explain Aristotle's puzzling claim, they were led to conceive of intellectual activity as a process similar to sensation, corresponding to a certain lapse of time (Castellani), an instant (Montecatini), or a mix of instantaneousness and concrete duration (Piccolomini), depending on their theoretical options.\n\nKSC-06pd1038\n\nNASA Image and Video Library\n\n2006-06-13\n\nKENNEDY SPACE CENTER, FLA. - During a break in the rain storms from Tropical Storm Alberto, the STS-121 crew arrives at NASA's Kennedy Space Center aboard a Grumman G2 aircraft to take part in a Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test, or TCDT.

My book The Ethics of Abortion: Women's Rights, Human Life, and the Question of Justice presents four such critiques. First, Giubilini and Minerva argue from the deeply controversial to the even more controversial. Second, they presuppose a false view of personal identity called body-self dualism. Third, their view cannot secure human equality. And fourth, their account of harm cannot account for harm found in some cases of murder. In the article, 'Pro-life arguments against infanticide and why they are not convincing', J. RÃ¤sÃ¤nen examines and finds wanting these four critiques. This essay responds to RÃ¤sÃ¤nen's defense of infanticide and argues that his responses to the four objections fail.

Abstract The sinoatrial node (SAN) is the normal pacemaker of the mammalian heart. Â Over several decades, a large amount of data on the ionic mechanisms underlying the spontaneous electrical activity of SAN pacemaker cells has been obtained, mostly in experiments on single cells isolated from rabbit SAN. This wealth of data has allowed the development of mathematical models of the electrical activity of rabbit SAN pacemaker cells. The present study aimed to construct a comprehensive model of the electrical activity of a human SAN pacemaker cell using recently obtained electrophysiological data from human SAN pacemaker cells. Â We based our model on the recent SeveriâDiFrancesco model of a rabbit SAN pacemaker cell. The action potential and calcium transient of the resulting model are close to the experimentally recorded values. The model has a much smaller âfunny currentâ (I f) than do rabbit cells, although its modulatory role is highly similar. Changes in pacing rate upon the implementation of mutations associated with sinus node dysfunction agree with the clinical\n\n[History of Instituto Nacional de Salud Ocupacional del Peru].\n\nPubMed\n\nCossio-Brazzan, Juan M\n\n2012-06-01\n\nIn Peru, the industry's development has made economic improvements but at the same time, it has had a major impact on the health of the workers; for that reason, it was necessary to generate control mechanisms. So, in 1940 it was created the Departmento de Higiene Industrial, which in 1956 was changed to Instituto de Salud Ocupacional, but it was deactivated in 1994. However, in 2001 it reappeared into the Ministerio de Salud organizational structure with the name of Instituto de Salud Ocupacional \"Alberto Hurtado AbadÃ­a\". Actually, it is the Centro Nacional de Salud Ocupacional y ProtecciÃ³n del Ambiente para la Salud (CENSOPAS), organ of the Instituto Nacional de Salud which continues working in synergy with other institutions and sectors, making research to protect the health of exposed persons (workers and community) to contamination and risks associated with economic activities.\n\nPietro Loreta and his contribution to surgery in the 19th century.\n\nPubMed\n\nAldini, NicolÃ² Nicoli; Fini, Milena; Giardino, Roberto\n\n2011-03-01\n\nPietro Loreta (1831 to 1889), head of surgery at the University of Bologna, Italy, is at present a little-known name. However, in the field of surgery in the second half of the 19th century, his contributions to various areas, especially that of bladder stone treatment and gastric surgery, aroused great interest also at the international level. This survey focuses on both of these subjects that are particularly indicative of Loreta's activity. While he was trying to improve the operation of perineal cystotomy, which was about to be abandoned, he was faced with the new frontier of gastrointestinal tract surgery. Surgery was in rapid transformation, and the practice of a general surgeon still encompassed the domains of different surgical specialties, which would develop individually afterward. Loreta was a pupil of the outstanding surgeon Francesco Rizzoli and some of his pupils such as Alessandro Codivilla and Bartolo Nigrisoli became heads of surgery. His attitude of caution, that he recommended in his writings, is more remarkable considering his problematic nature and might be the most significant and original trait of Loreta's personality.\n\nFederico Cesi and his field studies on the origin of fossils between 1610 and 1630.\n\nPubMed\n\nScott, A C\n\n2001-09-01\n\nIn 1603 Federico Cesi, along with four of his friends, founded the first Scientific Academy in Europe, the Accademia dei Lincei, which included Galileo Galillei as a member. Between 1611 and 1630 Cesi undertook an ambitious project to collect and record fossils from his lands around Acquasparta in Umbria. He had drawings and descriptions made of all the excavated fossils, fossil woods and their sites of origin. He died before his work could be published and it was left to his friend Francesco Stelluti to publish a monograph in which he claimed that evidence demonstrated that the fossil woods were formed from stone and were 'not once living'. The corpus of drawings, now in the Royal Collection at Windsor, has allowed the project to be reconstructed and fieldwork in Italy has shown that the complex nature of the fossil preservation could have easily confused the researchers and have led to misinterpretation of the fossils. This research by Cesi is the first to combine field and specimen data to interpret the origin of fossils and has been widely neglected by historians of Science.\n\nCharacter expansion methods for matrix models of dually weighted graphs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKazakov, Vladimir A.; Staudacher, Matthias; Wynter, Thomas\n\n1996-04-01\n\nWe consider generalized one-matrix models in which external fields allow control over the coordination numbers on both the original and dual lattices. We rederive in a simple fashion a character expansion formula for these models originally due to Itzykson and Di Francesco, and then demonstrate how to take the large N limit of this expansion. The relationship to the usual matrix model resolvent is elucidated. Our methods give as a by-product an extremely simple derivation of the Migdal integral equation describing the large N limit of the Itzykson-Zuber formula. We illustrate and check our methods by analysing a number of models solvable by traditional means. We then proceed to solve a new model: a sum over planar graphys possessing even coordination numbers on both the original and the dual lattice. We conclude by formulating the equations for the case of arbitrary sets of even, self-dual coupling constants. This opens the way for studying the deep problems of phase transitions from random to flat lattices.

This is why it can be considered the historic capital of Italian paediatrics. Here are the main reasons: Luigi Somma was the first professor of Italian paediatrics whereas Francesco Fede was the first president of the Italian Paediatrics Association. Neapolitan paediatricians have been the most numerous amongst the founder members. The first three Italian journals of paediatrics were founded in Naples as well as the journal ''La Pediatria'' which was the most distributed and long-lasting journal in this field. Moreover, Neapolitans have been the most numerous presidents of the Italian Paediatrics Association, while Rocco Jemma was the one who remained the longest in charge. ''Rocco Jemma's school'' taught not only to most professors in paediatrics who afterwards taught in most Italian universities, but also four out of five paediatricians who took charge of the position as president. The first regional department of the Italian Paediatrics Association was founded in Naples as well as the Association of Nipiology.\n\nINVITED SPEAKERS Invited Speakers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAlain AspectPalaiseau Markus AspelmeyerVienna Vanderlei BagnatoSÃ£o Paulo Victor BalykinMoscow Kristian BaumannZÃ¼rich Jim BergquistNIST, Boulder FrÃ©dÃ©ric ChevyENS, Paris John CloseCanberra Claude Cohen-TannoudjiENS, Paris Jean DalibardENS, Paris Eugene DemlerHarvard Michael DoserCERN Markus DrescherHamburg Francesca FerlainoInnsbruck Victor FlambaumSydney Chiara FortFlorence Elisabeth GiacobinoENS, Paris Philippe GrangierPalaiseau Chris GreeneJILA, Boulder Markus GreinerHarvard Eric HesselsToronto Hidetoshi KatoriTokyo Wolfgang KetterleMIT Michael KohlCambridge Wu-Ming LiuBeijing Francesco MinardiFlorence Holger MÃ¼llerBerkeley Karim MurrGarching Hanns-Christoph NÃ¤gerlInnsbruck Jeremy O'BrienBristol Silke OspelkausJILA, Boulder Krzysztof PachuckiWarsaw Bill PhillipsGaithersburg Randolf PohlGarching Eugene PolzikCopenhagen Cindy RegalJILA, Boulder Jakob ReichelENS, Paris Helmut RitschInnsbruck Christian RoosInnsbruck Mark SaffmanWisconsin Christophe SalomonENS, Paris Gora ShlyapnikovOrsay Richard TaiebParis Masahito UedaTokyo Chris ValeMelbourne Andreas WallraffZÃ¼rich Matthias WeidemÃ¼llerHeidelberg Martin WeitzBonn Artur WideraBonn David WinelandNIST, Boulder\n\nThe economics of microgravity research\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDiFrancesco, Jeanne M; Olson, John M\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn this introduction to the economics of microgravity research, DiFrancesco and Olson explore the existing landscape and begin to define the requirements for a robust, well-funded microgravity research environment.

The pictorial space for this study was evoked by a capriccio (imaginary landscape) by Francesco Guardi (1712â1793). In such a drawing pictorial space is suggested by the artist through a small set of conventional depth cues. As a result typical Western observers tend to agree largely in their visual awareness when looking at such art. We rank depths for locations that are not on a single surface and far apart in pictorial space. We find that observers resolve about 40 distinct depth layers and agree largely in this. From a previous experiment we have metrical data for the same observers. The rank correlations between the results are high. Perhaps surprisingly, we find no correlation between the number of distinct depth layers and the total metrical depth range. Thus, the relation between subjective magnitude and discrimination threshold fails to hold for pictorial depth.

Our formulation is based on a combination of density-functional perturbation theory and all-electron wavefunction reconstruction, starting from periodic-boundary calculations in the pseudopotential approximation. The orbital contribution to the NMR shift (the chemical shift) is obtained by combining the gauge-including projector augmented-wave approach (GIPAW), originally developed for the case of insulatorsootnotetextC. J. Pickard, Francesco Mauri, Phys. Rev. B, 63, 245101(2001), with the extension of linear-response theory to the case of metallic systemsootnotetextS. de Gironcoli, Phys. Rev. B, 51, 6773(1995). The spin contribution (the Knight shift) is obtained as a response to a finite uniform magnetic field, and through reconstructing the hyperfine interaction between the electron-spin density and the nuclear spins with the projector augmented-wave method (PAWootnotetextC. G. Van de Walle, P. E. BlÃ¶chl, Phys. Rev. B, 47, 4244(1993)). Our method is validated with applications to the case of the homogeneous electron gas and of simple metals.

M.; Bouquillon, A.; Pages-Camagna, S.; Aucouturier, M.; Roehrs, S.; Fermo, P.\n\n2006-06-01\n\nFor the first time some excellent pieces belonging to the majolica production of the great master Giorgio Andreoli from Gubbio (Central Italy) have been characterized from a chemical and structural point of view with the aim to identify the composition of both pigments and lustres. A series of particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and Raman analyses have been performed on some plates coming from Museo del Palazzo dei Consoli (Gubbio) and several French museums (Louvre, MusÃ©e National de la CÃ©ramique, MusÃ©e National de la Renaissance) lustred by Giorgio Andreoli and decorated by famous majolica painters such as Francesco Xanto Avelli. The three techniques are complementary and useful in the investigation of art objects since they are non-destructive. Furthermore, the low detection limits allow the identification of all elements and compounds present, and RBS allows concentration profiling, too. It is worth noticing that the examined objects are characterized by the presence of both gold and ruby-red lustres, a peculiarity of Mastro Giorgioâs technique. The measurements by PIXE and RBS have been carried out on the AGLAE accelerator at C2RMF, Louvre Palace.\n\nBase surge in recent volcanic eruptions\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nMoore, J.G.\n\n1967-01-01\n\nA base surge, first identified at the Bikini thermonuclear undersea explosion, is a ring-shaped basal cloud that sweeps outward as a density flow from the base of a vertical explosion column. Base surges are also common in shallow underground test explosions and are formed by expanding gases which first vent vertically and then with continued expansion rush over the crater lip (represented by a large solitary wave in an underwater explosion), tear ejecta from it, and feed a gas-charged density flow, which is the surge cloud. This horizontally moving cloud commonly has an initial velocity of more than 50 meters per second and can carry clastic material many kilometers. Base surges are a common feature of many recent shallow, submarine and phreatic volcanic eruptions. They transport ash, mud, lapilli, and blocks with great velocity and commonly sandblast and knock down trees and houses, coat the blast side with mud, and deposit ejecta at distances beyond the limits of throw-out trajectories. Close to the eruption center, the base surge can erode radial channels and deposit material with dune-type bedding. ?? 1967 Stabilimento Tipografico Francesco Giannini & Figli.\n\nSimulations of kinetic electrostatic electron nonlinear (KEEN) waves with variable velocity resolution grids and high-order time-splitting\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAfeyan, Bedros; Casas, Fernando; Crouseilles, Nicolas; Dodhy, Adila; Faou, Erwan; Mehrenberger, Michel; SonnendrÃ¼cker, Eric\n\n2014-10-01\n\nwith weakly driven KEEN waves are captured in these simulations. Canonical KEEN waves with ample drive are also treated using these advanced techniques. They will allow the efficient simulation of KEEN waves in multiple dimensions, which will be tackled next, as well as generalizations to Vlasov-Maxwell codes. These are essential for pursuing the impact of KEEN waves in high energy density plasmas and in inertial confinement fusion applications. More generally, one needs a fully-adaptive grid-in-phase-space method which could handle all small vorticlet dynamics whether pealing off or remerging. Such fully adaptive grids would have to be computed sparsely in order to be viable. This two-velocity grid method is a concrete and fruitful step in that direction.

First, damage source location by means of triangulation techniques and signal frequency analysis were carried out. Then, the recently introduced method of natural-time analysis was preliminarily applied to the AE time series in order to reveal a possible entrance point to a critical state of the monitored structural element. Finally, possible influence of the local seismic and microseismic activity on the stability of the monitored structure was investigated. The criterion for selecting relevant earthquakes was based on the estimation of the size of earthquake preparation zones. The presented results suggest the use of the AE technique as a tool for detecting both ongoing structural damage processes and microseismic activity during preparation stages of seismic events.\n\nBook Review: Book review\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVelasco, Josefa Ros\n\n2015-11-01\n\nAlberto Fragio is currently one of the major experts on Hans Blumenberg's work and thought. In recent years he has become a great interpreter of Blumenberg's posthumous publications and his NachlaÎ² at the Deutsche Literatur-Archiv Marbach (DLA Marbach). Since he acquired his doctoral degree in 2007, Fragio has devoted much of his efforts to clarifying Blumenberg's convoluted philosophical corpus, whose understanding - as is known - is really demanding for anyone who ventures into its disclosure, and it requires a monumental exercise of patience. Fragio has published far more than a dozen academic articles and three monographs, all of them generally pointing to the existence of a holistic nature in the philosophical work to which Blumenberg devoted a lifetime. Although his research project was on Blumenberg's History and Philosophy of Science, his joint publication with Giordano Bruno, Hans Blumenberg, Nuovi paradigmi d'analisi(2010), and the publication of what is the first enquiry into Blumenberg's History of Astronomy, DestrucciÃ³n, cosmos, metÃ¡fora.

The Spanish military surgeon, Fidel PagÃ©s MiravÃ©, completed the lumbar approach successfully in 1921. The two possibilities for identification of the epidural space the \"loss of resistance\" technique and the technique of the \"hanging drop\" were developed by Achille Mario Dogliotti, an Italian, and Alberto Gutierrez, an Argentinean physician, at the same time. In 1956 John J. Bonica published the paramedian approach to the epidural space. As early as 1931 Eugene Aburel, a Romanian obstetrician, injected local anaesthetics via a silk catheter to perform lumbar obstetric Epidura"
