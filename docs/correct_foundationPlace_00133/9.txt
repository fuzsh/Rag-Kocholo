This yearâ€™s edition of the ECSO Award Finals ceremony, hosted by Bochum Economic Development (Bochum Wirtschaftsentwicklung), and organised in cooperation with the Women4Cyber Foundation, and eurobits e.V., is scheduled to take place on 21 â€“ 22 March 2024 at the GDATA Campus in Bochum, Germany.

The ECSO Award Finals ceremony is an annual event dedicated to hosting the final rounds of the ECSO Award competitions. Since 2020, this event has been organised to determine the winner of the prestigious ECSO STARtup Award. This year, ECSO is embracing innovation by extending the event to feature not only the traditional ECSO STARtup Award category but also a brand-new award category â€“ the ECSO CISO Choice Award.

Whereas the ECSO STARtup Award aims to bring European cybersecurity start-ups and investors together and therefore provide opportunities to access finance, the ECSO CISO Choice Award will host larger European companies with established solutions and financing in an effort to facilitate their access to the market. Overall, the event aims to highlight and celebrate European cybersecurity excellence, promote European-made products, drive innovation and stimulate investments in the European cybersecurity market.

We extend a warm welcome to European cybersecurity providers, investors, end-users, and other leaders in the cybersecurity industry to attend this event!

You will be first in line and the testimony of all innovation brought on by our finalists.

About the ECSO CISO Choice Award

The ECSO CISO Choice Award is a new award category, being distributed for the first time ever at this yearâ€™s ceremony. It aims to recognise and celebrate the most innovative cybersecurity solution of the year. The competition features larger European cybersecurity companies with existing investments and solutions that are looking for an opportunity to access the market by presenting their innovations in front of an international audience of potential buyers.

This yearâ€™s finalists have been selected throughout 2023 by expert Judging Panels from different European cybersecurity events, including ECSOâ€™s Cyber Solution Days and the European Cybersecurity Competence Centreâ€™s (ECCC) Access-2-Market Matchmaking Events. Among the finalists are the following companies with incredible potential for Europeâ€™s security:

At the 2024 ECSO CISO Choice Award, these finalists will present their most compelling pitches. Their presentations will be carefully evaluated by an expert Judging Panel comprised mostly of European CISOs who, at the end of the day, will select the company with the most promising and innovative cybersecurity solution as a winner.

This is the perfect opportunity for European CISOâ€™s and end-users to meet and connect with fellow cybersecurity leaders from all over Europe, as well as to gain direct access to the hottest European solutions on the market, presented by the experts themselves.
