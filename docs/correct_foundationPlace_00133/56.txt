The "Konsumverein Wohlfahrt eGmbH", a company close to the trade unions, expanded by 1933 to become the largest district consumer association in the Ruhr area and built up a comprehensive network of shops where workers and miners could buy groceries at low prices and also had a financial share in the profits.The administration building built between 1914 and 1916 on Königsallee with spacious premises for a bakery, butcher's shop, warehouses, distribution halls and vehicle fleet supplied 113 branches in Bochum, Witten, Herne and Wanne-Eickel with 30,000 members.

The buildings of the consumer association are a place steeped in history and are now under monument protection as sophisticated architecture and important testimonies to Bochum's history. In 1962, following economic problems, the Wohlfahrt consumer association was taken over by the Dortmund-Hamm consumer cooperative and integrated into COOP-Dortmund in 1969. The old headquarters on Königsallee and numerous sales outlets were given up.

After G DATA Software AG had been a partial tenant of the site for many years, the company bought the 2.3-hectare site on Königsallee in 2014 (100 years after the laying of the foundation stone) and transformed it into the G DATA campus. Almost 400 employees work for the security software manufacturer from here.Source: bochum.de/Stadtarchiv/Bochum-in-der-NS-Zeit/Leidens-Wege-in-Bochum-1933-bis-1945/Die-Stationen
