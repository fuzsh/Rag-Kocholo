Lake Formation allows cross-account access to the Data Catalog metadata, and underlying data to users of the ML workload accounts, as shown in the following diagram.\n\nConsider the following questions when designing your centralized data catalog:\n\nIntroducing Intelligence Data Foundation (IDF) âoneâ catalog\n\nIDF is an Accenture framework that accelerates the build and deployment of governed enterprise data and ML products on AWS.\n\nIDF includes a metadata engine that ensures data are labeled, tagged, classified, and profiled as they are ingested, or curated into the data lake or the SageMaker Feature Store.\n\nIDF augments the technical metadata captured by AWS Glue Data Catalog with business and operational metadata and builds a centralized âoneâ catalog backed by Amazon OpenSearch Service. IDF uses Amazon ML services and custom scripts to capture the additional metadata.\n\nIDF facilitates data discovery and provisioning of ML ready datasets for data science teams, integrating closely with the multi-account architecture and lake formation services to enable cross-account fine-grained access controls to the data lake.\n\nThe goal of the IDF one catalog framework is to enable:"
