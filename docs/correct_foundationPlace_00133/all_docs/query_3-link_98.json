        "text": "MarkupÂ¶\n\n.foundation-collectionÂ¶\n\nIndicates the element is a collection. A collection represents a group of elements, knowns as its items. A collection MUST NOT be nested inside another collection.\n\nTo store metadata for the collection, this element (or its descendant) can be annotated accordingly. Or .foundation-collection-meta can be used as a standardized way to do this.\n\nSelector Rule:\n\n.foundation-collection\n\n[data-foundation-collection-id]Â¶\n\nThe ID of the collection. This is optional. The ID is an opaque string where the author can use whatever value suitable for the application. For Granite application, it is usually a path.\n\nUsually collection is used to represent hierarchical system similar to file system. This attribute is then used to indicate the path of the directory. The collection items then become the files or subdirectory.\n\nSelector Rule:\n\n.foundation-collection[data-foundation-collection-id]\n\n.foundation-collection-itemÂ¶\n\nIndicates the element is an item of a collection. It MUST be a descendant of .foundation-collection element.\n\nTo store metadata for the item, this element (or its descendant) can be annotated accordingly.\n\nSelector Rule:\n\n.foundation-collection .foundation-collection-item\n\n[data-foundation-collection-item-id]Â¶\n\nThe ID of the collection item. This is optional. The ID is an opaque string where the author can use whatever value suitable for the application. It MUST be unique within a collection. i.e. Within a collection, there cannot be two items having the same ID. For Granite application, it is usually a path.\n\nSelector Rule:\n\n.foundation-collection-item[data-foundation-collection-item-id]\n\n.foundation-collection-item-titleÂ¶\n\nThe element of the title of the collection item. This is optional. The title is usually used to display human-friendly string that can be read by the component dealing with the item.\n\nSelector Rule:\n\n.foundation-collection-item .foundation-collection-item-title\n\n.foundation-collection-item-thumbnailÂ¶\n\nThe element of the thumbnail of the collection item. This is optional.\n\nSelector Rule:\n\n.foundation-collection-item .foundation-collection-item-thumbnail\n\n.foundation-collection-navigatorÂ¶\n\nIndicates the element to navigate into the item. This is optional. The implementor may use this as a standardized way to allow the markup author to indicate the element to be used as an activator to navigate.\n\nSelector Rule:\n\n.foundation-collection-item .foundation-collection-navigator, .foundation-collection-item.foundation-collection-navigator\n\n[data-foundation-collection-navigator-href]Â¶\n\nThe URI to navigate into. It is done by mean of window.location. i.e. it will use a new window context.\n\nIf this attribute is not specified, the collection is navigated into the associated item, by loading the new collection based on the value of the itemâs [data-foundation-collection-item-id]. The semantic behaviour is the same as calling FoundationCollection#load with id equals to the item ID.\n\nSelector Rule:\n\n.foundation-collection-navigator[data-foundation-collection-navigator-href]\n\n[data-foundation-collection-meta-title]Â¶\n\nThe title of the collection. The title is usually used to display human-friendly string.\n\nThis is the collection counterpart of .foundation-collection-item-title.\n\nSelector Rule:\n\n.foundation-collection-meta[data-foundation-collection-meta-title]\n\n[data-foundation-collection-meta-folder]Â¶\n\ntrue to indicate if the collection is a folder; false otherwise.\n\nSelector Rule:\n\n.foundation-collection-meta[data-foundation-collection-meta-folder]"
