        "text": "G DATA offers tips for safe Internet use\n\nSmartphones have become a staple of our everyday communication. But it’s not just adults who are exposed to dangers such as data theft, identity theft or cyberbullying. Children and young people in particular often do not know what risks online users need to be aware of. This year's Safer Internet Day on February 11 is themed “Together for a better Internet” and draws attention to the subject of IT security worldwide through campaigns also aimed at children and young people.\n\nA survey conducted by digital association Bitkom on the ownership of smartphones by children and young people in Germany clearly shows that one third (33 percent) of 8- to 9-year-olds, three quarters (75 percent) of 10- to 11-year-olds and almost all children and young people aged 12 or over (approx. 95 percent) already have a smartphone. They use their mobile phones in various ways, whether to listen to music, watch videos and play games or to use messenger services. Bochum-based IT security specialist G DATA CyberDefense is jumping on the opportunity offered by the European day of action to provide tips for safe Internet use.\n\nRaising awareness of cyber crime among children and young people is particularly important. Often they are too reckless with their digital identities and are uncertain of how to surf the net safely. Links especially do not always lead to harmless sites. Trojans, viruses, malware or phishing attempts can hide behind harmless looking emails. However, Internet fraud is also an underestimated danger. Simple security tips can protect users from cyber attacks and ensure a more responsible way of handling sensitive data.\n\nWhat is Safer Internet Day?\n\nThe worldwide Safer Internet Day (SID) is a day initiated by the European Union to help people stay safe on the Internet. Activities and events take place every year at the beginning of February. Anyone can take part in it - institutions, foundations, companies, associations or private individuals."
