        "text": "For example, the University of Duisburg-Essen and the FOM University of Applied Sciences are two of Germany’s top 20 universities in terms of student numbers. The FOM is also the largest private university in Germany, the University of Duisburg-Essen is present in international rankings with outstanding research achievements and is also part of the University Alliance Ruhr. The affiliated University Hospital Essen is the largest university hospital in the Ruhr region centred on one location and thus the “Hospital of the Ruhr Metropolis”. The Folkwang University of Arts is one of the most distinguished art universities in Germany.\n\nWith the Institute for Cultural Studies Essen (KWI), the RWI – Leibniz Institute for Economic Research, the Centre for Turkish Studies and Integration Research (ZfTI) and the Gas and Heating Institute Essen e.V. (GWI) , renowned research institutions are part of the Science City Essen. The many other research institutions – from basic to the application-oriented – cover an attractive range of disciplines and are very well networked with the economy at-large via transfer institutions.\n\nThe City of Science Essen is supported by many institutions and players in the city’s society. For example, Essen is the headquarters of the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft (Donors’ association for the promotion of humanities and sciences in Germany) and of many important science-promoting foundations such as the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation and the Stiftung Mercator GmbH. The Zollverein Foundation at the Zollverein Coal Mine World Heritage Site is also committed to the goals of Essen as a city of science.\n\nEssen is also characterised by a broad, science-oriented educational landscape. Haus der Technik (House of Technology – HDT) is also based in Essen, as is the Student Union Essen-Duisburg, the BildungsCentrum der Wirtschaft (Business Training Centre) and the long-established Essen VWA (Administration and Economic Academy) of 1906. With the zdi centre STEM-Network Essen there is an established support network for the next generation of STEM specialists, from the mini-researchers in day care to university-level STEM students."
