        "text": "The Data Foundation is a Washington, DC-based, non-profit, non-partisan organization. We are a trusted authority on the use of open, accessible data to fuel a more efficient, effective, and accountable government; spark innovation; and provide insights to the country’s most pressing challenges. We conduct research, facilitate collaborative thought leadership, and promote advocacy programs that advance practical policies for the creation and use of accessible, trustworthy data and evidence.\n\nFor more than a decade, the Data Foundation has been bringing attention to key issues facing the data community. We bring together non-traditional partners and stakeholders to devise practical solutions, which culminate in new policies and approaches for innovating and using data and evidence. The impacts from our work have been tremendous, culminating in enactment of milestone legislation, stronger communities for implementing transparency and data initiatives, and demonstrations of new strategies for innovating with government data.\n\nWith the attention and focus on solving real problems, the Data Foundation’s policy research, collaboration, and advocacy efforts over the past decade helped identify, formulate, refine, and enable passage then implementation of milestone data and transparency legislation now signed into law with bipartisan support. Major data laws the Data Foundation research and advocacy contributed to include:\n\nDigital Accountability and Transparency (DATA) Act\n\nGrant Reporting Efficiency and Agreements Transparency (GREAT) Act\n\nFoundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act (Evidence Act)\n\nOpen, Public, Electronic, and Necessary (OPEN) Government Data Act\n\nAI in Government Act\n\nTaxpayers Right to Know Act\n\nCongressional Budget Justification Transparency Act\n\nNational Secure Data Service Act\n\nFinancial Data Transparency Act\n\nTaken together, these data laws present substantial reforms for responsibly using government data and promoting transparency to benefit the American people. Each also bolsters the capacity for partnerships between the private and public sectors to continue making progress in using open data and evidence-informed policymaking in the years ahead — the Data Foundation is here to facilitate, enable, and promote this capability."
