        "text": "Archaeometallurgy - a special field of archaeometry - uses scientific methods to investigate the extraction and distribution of metals in prehistoric and historic times. For this purpose, there is a close cooperation with the material science and research laboratories of the Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum and external trusted collaborating laboratories.\n\nArchaeometallurgy investigates all aspects of the metallurgical process chain for the extraction of metals from ore and their further processing into artifacts. Scientists from the disciplines of geoscience, materials science, chemistry, physics, and engineering have established archaeometallurgy as a subfield of archaeometry with special expertise, which in turn has led to a reorientation in the humanities.\n\nArchaeometallurgical research at the Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum includes raw material-based prospections in the field, experimental approaches, and analytical and material science techniques in the laboratory. Archaeometallurgical focused field prospecting is based on economic geology and looks for metallic resources in metallogenic districts that were potentially used in the past. Experimental approaches are used to investigate interactions of metallurgical as well as weathering processes, for example corrosion, on chemical and physical properties of the objects. The state-of-the-art analytical methods are the basis of all archaeometallurgical studies.\n\nHowever, archaeometallurgy is by no means limited to the mere application of scientific methods to archaeological problems. Rather, methods of investigation must be newly developed, modified, and optimized because the sample materials differ significantly from that of natural science subjects. One example is high-precision elemental and isotopic analysis, which must be adapted to the much more complex nature of the metallurgical material spectrum.\n\nThe Archaeometallurgy research area of the Deutsches Bergbau-Museum Bochum is active since 1990, when it was established with the financial support of the Volkswagen Foundation."
