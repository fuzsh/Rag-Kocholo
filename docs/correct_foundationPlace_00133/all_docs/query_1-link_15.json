        "text": "The Horst Görtz Institute for IT Security – Interdisciplinary, Innovative & International\n\nThe Horst Görtz Institute for IT Security (HGI), Research Department of the Ruhr-Universität Bochum (RUB), is one of the largest and most renowned institutes in the field of IT security in Europe.\n\nMore than 160 scientists, 39 of them professors, conduct research at our institute in their working groups within the fields of computer science, electrical engineering and information technology and mathematics as well as the humanities and social sciences. In this interdisciplinary environment, almost all aspects of IT security are covered.\n\nOur success is based on the three pillars Research, Early career and Networking.\n\nSince 2019, the Cluster of Excellence \"CASA: Cyber Security in the Age of Large-Scale Adversaries\" has been established at the HGI. It is the only German cluster of excellence in the field of IT security. CASA is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) with about 30 million Euros. Further information can be found on the CASA homepage."
