        "text": "The era of pervasive AI is here. To achieve their artificial intelligence aspirations, organizations will need to harness even more of their data and information. But according to new Avanade research*, 63% of business and IT leaders do not completely trust the data their company uses today.\n\nIt is deeply concerning that at the same moment in time that game-changing technologies like generative AI are rapidly gaining traction, nearly two-thirds of decision-makers don’t fully trust the data that would fuel them at their company.\n\nThat’s one key reason I am thrilled to see the announcement of Microsoft Fabric today at Microsoft Build. There’s never been a more critical time to ensure your data, analytics and AI (DAAI) platform can deliver trusted insights at the speed of today’s business. And you need to ensure your DAAI platform can manage the most demanding analytics and AI workloads, across machine learning processes, data science and analytics initiatives.\n\nWhy we’re excited for the arrival of Microsoft Fabric\n\nMicrosoft Fabric brings together the intelligent data platform and Power BI into a single SaaS solution, infused with generative AI capabilities from data engineering features to Azure Open AI integration. It will help our clients manage their data in one unified foundation, while creating a single source of truth for all their data. Microsoft Fabric is built on an open, lake-centric foundation with data governance built in – further assuring trustable data while optimizing data product, service, and analytics access across the entire organization.\n\nI’ve seen first-hand the many challenges faced by our data customers across the globe. Too many solution components adds complexity and drains resources. Our clients are doing more than ever before with data analytics platforms, but they still have a fragmented, siloed and costly architecture because data needs to be duplicated or moved through layers and systems. Clients need of a simplified and unified architecture across data engineering, data science and BI workloads.\n\nSo how does Microsoft Fabric address these challenges? Put simply: Microsoft Fabric is a single platform that unifies all of an organization’s data and analytics workloads. It accelerates how quickly our clients can extract insights and value from their data. The platform will help our clients harness maximum value of today’s generative AI technology and the rapidly-evolving AI innovations of tomorrow. (And by the way, we would love to show you what generative AI can do for your use cases, connect with us and book a workshop.)\n\nAvanade is ready on day one: Announcing our offering for Microsoft Fabric\n\nToday, we are launching the Avanade offering for Microsoft Fabric, now available on the Azure Marketplace. It covers a range of engagement options, starting with a 4-hour workshop that introduces Microsoft Fabric’s core technical components while showing you what’s possible with an elevated data strategy. Other engagement opportunities include training, business activation, and co-creating and implementing the data strategy ideal for your organization.\n\nAvanade is uniquely positioned to help clients evolve their data strategy with Microsoft Fabric. During its private preview, we’ve had the opportunity to test and provide feedback to Microsoft on core features and considerations. Microsoft Fabric is now the technical backbone of Avanade’s internal data strategy.\n\nLet’s talk about your path to data-led transformation\n\nWhether you’re exploring generative AI use cases, or considering the criteria for your next data, analytics and AI platform, Avanade data leaders are ready to help you explore what’s possible though our data modernization capabilities. And learn more about our Microsoft Fabric offering on Azure Marketplace today.\n\n*Avanade and McGuire Research, 2023\n\nThe Avanade and McGuire Research study surveyed 800 respondents across Australia, Canada, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States in March and April 2023. Respondents included primary decision-makers across business (50%) and IT (50%), representing several industries, including industrial manufacturing (12%), financial services (13%), health (13%), life sciences (13%) consumer goods and services (13%), retail (12%), energy and utilities (13%), and government and non-profit (12%)."
