        "text": "Master Data Management\n\nIn a world where digitalization is rocking even the most grounded of business models, master data has become a company’s single most valuable asset. If your company wants to succeed in the market, you need a professional solution for managing your master data.\n\nMaster data and product information management (MDM/PIM) solutions soon yield real-world financial benefits, with companies enjoying a comprehensive, and accurate, overview of all business-critical master data.\n\nMaster Data Management\n\nData Quality\n\nWorldwide, the sheer volume of data is booming. By 2025, total data will amount to around 175 zettabytes. That’s forty times more than in 2013. A serious chunk of this data is generated by companies – we’re talking data on customers, costs and competitors. Leveraging this information in the right way is key to gaining a competitive edge. On one condition: the data quality must be excellent.\n\nPoor data quality currently loses companies a whopping $9.7 billion every year, with overall productivity down by up to 20 percent. But the ever-growing wealth of data doesn’t have to be a burden: harnessing this data to fuel their business requires organizations to implement strategic data quality management and effective data cleansing.\n\nData Quality\n\nData Governance\n\nMore and more, data holds the key to any company’s success. Data governance is essential to maximize the value of data assets. Until now, too many companies have fallen into the trap of underestimating the importance of data, hindering their own success.\n\nData governance impacts a company at every level – both on the strategy and operations side of things. It sets out a series of rules and frameworks for all technologies, processes and responsibilities in dealing with data within the company and beyond.\n\nData Governance"
