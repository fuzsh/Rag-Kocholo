        "text": "Assuming responsibility together\n\nOur flat hierarchies go a long way towards ensuring that everyone achieves their full potential and can contribute their ideas. In this way, we create a sense of togetherness. This facilitates the coordination of interdisciplinary teams that yield even better results. A company is defined by its corporate values. This is why we have drafted a G DATA ethics mission statement, which serves as a binding guideline both for how we interact within the company and with partners and customers. We aim for a cooperation that motivates our team and helps create a positive, supportive atmosphere.\n\nWe Interact on a First-Name Basis\n\nYears ago, we made a conscious decision to communicate on a first-name basis. We discovered that this form of interaction, from trainees all the way to board members, simplifies many things and ensures that the entire team is on the same level. Thanks to our corporate mission statement and flat hierarchies, we have created a mode of interacting with each other that inspires a strong sense of togetherness – and this has a positive effect on the team spirit and daily work. In our experience, communicating on a first-name basis at the office while showing appreciation, politeness, and respect for your colleagues creates a solid foundation for a relaxed and motivating atmosphere.\n\nCompany pension scheme\n\nTo ensure that our employees are well provided for when they enter their well-earned retirement, we embrace the social concept of company pension schemes. We subsidize the monthly savings amount by adding a bonus, thus making this type of private pension even more attractive at G DATA. In order to arrive at the best solution for you, we sit down together with you and our partner company in an individual consultation. If you wish, you can, of course, simply continue an existing contract.\n\nSports sponsorship\n\nG DATA is always in motion. As the health of our employees is very dear to us, we promote their sportive endeavors. We do so by enabling them to participate in leisure sports activities free of charge or at reduced prices and pay the entry fee when they enter competitions. In addition, we provide them with high-quality functional clothing that feature a team logo and lettering. The sports activities our employees engage in are as diverse as they are. Thanks to the broad range of activities on offer, everyone is able to do what they enjoy most.\n\nPromoting our employees\n\nThe world changes at a high pace. This is especially true for the IT sector. Only if you stay up to date on a professional level can you achieve great things at work. That’s why we consider ongoing vocational training and employee development to be an important pillar of G DATA’s corporate success, no matter whether it’s seminars, workshops, conferences, or a part-time course of study. Topics such as work organization and team building are also on the agenda.\n\nGroup-based language learning\n\nAs an international company, people from different parts of the world work together at the G DATA Campus, and our software is offered in more than 90 countries worldwide. This is why we focus on the best possible flow and exchange of information among our team, with our partners, and also with our customers. Our range of language courses including German, English and French provides you with the opportunity to deepen and improve your language skills while at the office.\n\nRelaxed and constructive atmosphere\n\nOnly a satisfied employee is a productive employee. In order to create a pleasant working environment, we provide our employees with bright rooms and modern equipment to create an inspiring environment. After acquiring the building in 2014, G DATA had the interior restructured and redesigned according to an innovative interior design concept. Ergonomic and individually adaptable furniture offers great comfort and stimulates focused work. Whether in the hallway or at the coffee machine: Wherever members of our team meet, ample seating and slightly secluded spaces offer the ideal backdrop for relaxed and constructive conversations. After all, a relaxed atmosphere fosters excellent work.\n\nEnergy Replenishment Thanks to Organic Food\n\nWe believe that healthy employees translate into a healthy company. And this is why we attach great importance to ensuring that our entire team feels comfortable here, at their workspace and beyond. We do everything we can to ensure that they stay healthy and fit and that they eat a balanced, tasty, and high-quality diet. After all, our employees are our most valuable resource. So it is in our best interest to ensure that they are always “fully charged” and alert by providing them with fresh organic fruit, coffee from our own roasting facility, and organic lemonade and bread. In our own café, you can also sample numerous coffee specialties while sitting together at a meeting or when you need a little time-out. And all this is free of charge. In the same spirit, fresh and sustainable products are also offered during the lunch break. Our bistro serves a varied three-course organic menu every working day, and there is always a vegetarian alternative.\n\nG DATA Campus: Dates & Facts\n\nG DATA is at home in Bochum and the Ruhr Region. The two company founders are deeply rooted in the region, so it is not surprising that our company headquarters, the G DATA Campus, has been situated at Königsallee in Bochum for many years. In 2014, we became owners of the campus, which provides approximately 400 employees with working facilities.\n\nOver the course of 13 construction stages, which did not interrupt our ongoing business, the campus with its landmarked facades was transformed into a modern headquarters, which now offers 15,000 sqm of office space on a 2.3 ha plot of land. To cover the 1.5 million kwH required annually to operate the technical infrastructure, we decided in 2015 to opt for the green electricity package offered by Stadtwerke Bochum. Every single kilowatt hour is derived from hydropower. Although this causes additional costs every year, we are happy to pay this surcharge in order to apply our self-imposed corporate social responsibility tenets to the energy sector as well.\n\nIn addition to the previously mentioned in-house café and bistro, the campus also includes our G DATA Museum as well as sufficient parking facilities for our employees and visitors.\n\nInternships and Theses for Students\n\nAre you in the middle of your studies, or would you like to go the extra mile as your studies are coming to a close? Then we are the right place for you. Take advantage of the opportunity to expand your knowledge and experience your desired field of work in a hands-on manner. During your time with us, you will be fully integrated into the company’s processes, receive intensive support, and have access to all G DATA resources. Internships and theses can be completed anywhere in the development department.\n\nIn addition, in cooperation with the Ruhr-Universität Bochum, we offer subject-specific internships that provide you with deep insights into IT security and enable you to plan and implement your first projects yourself. You can register via the respective Ruhr-Universität Bochum course. We are looking forward to a lively exchange of ideas and fresh input.\n\nFair food – Slow Food Deutschland e.V.\n\nRegardless of whether it’s a crunchy salad purchased at the weekly market or a ready-made meal made from canned food. We make decisions with everything we eat. This is not only about our well-being, but also about politics and society. In order to be a positive influence in this area, G DATA supports Slow Food Deutschland e.V. This organization promotes initiatives and projects worldwide that are dedicated towards creating a responsible food system."
