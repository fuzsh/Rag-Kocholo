This includes, among other things, the administration of library user data in the context of media loans, the renewal of loans, reservations for loans, the implementation of fee and reminder processes and communication with users.\n\nPrimo VE is a library search system (so-called discovery system) that enables library users to search for literature via a search mask.\n\nThe use of Primo VE for research purposes is possible both with and without registration. Registration is required to use the full range of functions.\n\nRUB Bib App is a smartphone app developed by Bochum University Library that enables access to the personal library account and serves to authenticate customers at the circulation desks.\n\nThe following personal data of library users is processed:\n\nRUB Bib App (library app)\n\nUsers can install the \"RUB Bib\" app of Bochum University Library on their smartphone and use it to view their library account and use the functions of this account, as well as for authentication at the circulation desks for borrowing media.\n\nDuring authentication, a personal identification feature (barcode) with a limited validity period is generated on the smartphone. This barcode can be used to borrow media from the self-checkout machines and service desks and to pay fees at the checkout machines.\n\nPersonal data\n\nNo personal data is stored in the RUB Bib app, only the data described in the Alma section is accessed and displayed. Data retention and deletion for this data is described in the section \"Duration of processing / data deletion\".\n\nInformation on the development\n\nThe RUB Bib app was developed by Bochum University Library.\n\nAlma (library management system)\n\nA. Personal details\n\nFirst name, middle name, preferred first name, preferred middle name, last name, preferred last name, title, date of birth\n\nPrimary identifier, library user group, status and status date, date of last user activity, account expiration date, account deletion date, preferred language, user roles\n\nContact information: e-mail address\n\nContact information: Address (except employees)\n\nBlocks, fees\n\nB.

In particular, this is the data described in the Alma section. In the course of authentication via Shibboleth, you must also agree to the transmission of the LoginID, which serves as the primary key for assignment to your own data.\n\n1. What does Ex Libris do with the data it collects via Beacon?\n\nThe information that is sent is used to proactively monitor end-user behavior and to enable future analysis of feature usage. No personal information is transmitted to ExLibris (e.g. no user ID, username, email, or phone number)\n\nData sent to the center is converted into analytical (statistical) tables and all raw data is deleted after 30 days. The 30-day window is used to ensure that operational issues related to the creation of each table can be resolved by creating a recent \"history\" if necessary.\n\n2. What kind of data is collected?\n\nThe actual data passed on depends on the \"click\" a user makes, although some standard information is always passed on:\n\nServer name\n\nServer IP\n\nSession ID\n\nInstitution\n\nApplication (e.g. Primo_Local)\n\nPage\n\nOperation\n\nEnd user behavior (not passed on in all cases)\n\n(Source: https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Primo/Knowledge_Articles/Data_Collection_via_beacon01.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com, graphically adapted)\n\nLegal basis for data processing\n\nThe collection of data takes place in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e GDPR in conjunction with § 3 para. 1 of the Higher Education Act of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia (HG NRW) and in accordance with the statutes (administrative and usage regulations) for the university library of the Ruhr-Universität Bochum of January 7, 2004 and the fee schedule for library facilities of February 23, 2010.\n\nThe library can be used on site in the reading rooms without processing personal data.
