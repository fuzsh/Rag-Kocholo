        "text": "Data analytics strategy\n\nUnlocking the power of data and analytics starts with a clear understanding of what strategic goals you want to achieve, and how to build an organisation that succeeds.\n\nThis is business strategy. So you need a partner who understands business.\n\nFor more than a century, we’ve helped clients build trust in the foundations of their business, and solve the important problems they face. We’ll bring that heritage of assurance, attention to detail and big-picture commercial insight. And we’ll convene the right people to help - PwC global industry and functional experts, alongside our technology and commercial partners, and smart start-ups.\n\nData architecture\n\nBuilding data lakes. Creating data warehouses. And plugging it all into an organisation to actually do something useful… Businesses today are looking for next-generation architectures to deal with diverse data assets, speed up data processing and analytics, and drive innovation and lower costs.\n\nWe’ll help you consider and set up the best ways to store your data, share it across the enterprise and with multiple systems, and help your people and systems consume and process it.\n\nData assurance\n\nData is everywhere. And you’ll want to use it to help you make smarter commercial decisions. But do you know what data you have? And where it’s stored? Can you be sure of its provenance? Was it accurate in the first place? As new systems come online, is your data being transferred accurately?\n\nWe can help you gather, review and model the data you need to build a successful analytics function. Our global data experts continue the PwC heritage of audit and assurance, which has taught us how to build strong businesses on trusted data.\n\nData discovery\n\nSo much data. So little time. How do you get the facts you need to run your business, fast, with minimal effort?\n\nData discovery does just this. It helps you quickly and easily discover outliers and detect patterns in your business. We’ll start by gathering and consolidating data from a number of sources across the organisation. Then we’ll help manipulate and visualise the data, and apply advanced analytics, so that you can spot trends or anomalies - and make better-informed decisions.\n\nData-driven culture\n\nWe’ll work with you to create an organisation that understands and embraces the power of data and analytics. One where data is in your DNA.\n\nUltimately, it comes down to creating an organisation that uses fact-based decisions to drive business strategy. Taking comprehensive data, applying analytics to that data, and enhancing the intuition and experience of your people. Adding proof to instinct.\n\nWe’ll help you build the right team, choose the right tools, and put in place the right metrics. So you can have confidence in the decisions you’re making.\n\nData governance\n\nData governance builds trust and confidence. Managing the risk in data is essential, but great data governance goes far beyond this. And it’s very rarely built on a one-size-fits-all model.\n\nGreat data governance recognises the context in which you operate, and acknowledges that data priorities can change to reflect strategic and operational ones. It fits into your existing structure and processes, so that it’s easier to adopt the right behaviours around data management. And it recognises that not all data is equal - and that data management should be prioritised, so the most important data gets the attention it deserves.\n\nWe’ll help you make great governance ‘the way things are done’, so you can build confidence throughout your organisation.\n\nData monetisation\n\nNow you’ve got good data foundations in place, you’re sat on an asset that could be working much harder for you.\n\nEffective monetisation needs an understanding of the value of the data you have. It needs intelligent, connected systems and processes to capture data. It needs technologies like cloud-based data management, AI, machine learning and bespoke algorithms to do the heavy lifting. And it needs governance and management to protect privacy and avoid risk.\n\nWe’ll help you pinpoint new potential revenue streams and turn them into reality.\n\nData quality\n\nData is everywhere. And you’ll want to use it to help you make smarter commercial decisions. But do you know what data you have? And where it’s stored? Can you be sure of the provenance of the data? Where did it come from? Was it accurate in the first place? As new systems come online, is your data being transferred accurately? Our heritage of audit and assurance has taught us how to build strong businesses on trusted data. We can help you collect, review and model the data you need to build a successful analytics function.\n\nData visualisation\n\nCompelling visualisations bring data to life. Yet only 31% of executives we spoke to in our Digital IQ Survey said they’re investing in data visualisation.\n\nThe brain is faster and more efficient at processing graphical representation of data. So visualisations can quickly help to identify trends, spot outliers and expose poor data quality. Not only can we work with clients to help them make decisions, but we can make visualisation a business tool that everybody uses. Through maps, charts and simulations, they can trial ideas, test scenarios and see the impact of their decisions. Every day. All across their business."
