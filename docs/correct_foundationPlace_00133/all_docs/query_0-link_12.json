        "text": "Young Businesses\n\nSince its foundation, the HGI has produced almost 20 young companies, making it one of the leaders in Germany in the field of IT security. The companies were founded by students, doctoral students and professors of the institute with technologies based on research conducted at HGI.\n\nThe young companies are extremely successful. E. g. the first generation – zynamics, Sirrix and ESCRYPT – have been acquired by large companies such as Google, Rohde & Schwarz and Bosch.\n\nIn order to be able to support current and future founders in a more systematic and targeted manner, the Cube 5 project was established here as an incubator for IT security startups funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.\n\nStartup Incubator Cube 5\n\nThe Cube 5 incubator supports people interested in founding a company and startups in the field of IT security and future communication systems (6G). The focus is on spin-offs from research with prospects of success in the B2B sector. Cube 5 is the contact for the StartUpSecure and StartUpConnect funding programs of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). With StartUpSecure and StartUpConnect, the BMBF has established funding platforms for startup teams and young companies. The initiatives are intended to significantly increase the chances of success and innovation output in the fields of IT security and future communication systems (6G) and promote successful projects.\n\nFunding Programs\n\nThe Cube 5 team advises and supports founding teams and startups throughout Germany in applying for both funding programs and accompanies them throughout the entire process. Participation takes place in two independent funding phases.\n\nFind out more about StartUpSecure\n\nFind out more about StartUpConnect\n\nBITSI e.V.\n\nA lot has happened in Bochum's IT world in recent years: Bochum has developed into a unique ecosystem of computer science and IT security. In addition to over 200 researchers and 2000 students, countless successful start-ups have been founded in Bochum and companies have settled in Bochum. Therefore, in 2022, the Bochum Association for the Promotion of IT Security and Computer Science - BITSI e.V. for short - was founded. The association's mission is to combine the forces of this ecosystem, to expand the alumni network, to facilitate the exchange between science and business, and to sustainably support research and teaching.\n\neurobits e.V.\n\nSince 1999, eurobits e.V. has been promoting technology transfer in the area of IT security and information security between science and industry - in the Ruhr Area and beyond. Its members include leading research institutes, established companies in the industry as well as young growth companies. The HGI is a founding member of eurobits e.V. and has always been closely involved in the association's activities and supports the goals of eurobits e.V.\n\nSince 2017 the eurobits Excellence Award has been awarded annually. The prize, which is endowed with 1,000 €, is awarded annually for the preparation of a final thesis, which, in addition to scientific excellence, must have high practical relevance for applications in IT security/information security."
