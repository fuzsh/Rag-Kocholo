        "text": "Introduction\n\nThere are 5 important things you should get right before you start building your dream data platform, and you would be surprised. It's not the technological data foundation. The majority of the effort will go to the organizational data foundation.\n\nBreaking down the organizational data foundation we can categorize the work as (1) master data management, (2) business metric definition, and (3) common data model design.\n\nIn this article we will elaborate on the organizational data foundation. The technical data foundation needs its own article.\n\nMaster Data Management\n\nDo you really know what your data means? Are you able to say with 100% certainty that everything is set up correctly in all your IT systems?\n\nBefore you start building your dream data platform, get master data management right. Master data management is the process of ensuring that all of your data is accurate, consistent, and up to date. This may seem like a daunting task, but it's essential for ensuring that your platform is built on a solid foundation.\n\nIn addition to the concept of 'master data', we distinguish two other types of data:\n\nTransactional data: data generated by an IT system for a day-2-day process (e.g. an ERP-system)\n\nAnalytical data: data created by aggregating transactional data from different IT systems.\n\nTo keep your master data in tip-top shape you need to have master data management, which comprises:\n\nProcesses and systems: Ensure that data is consistently captured and maintained. This could involve implementing a master data service (MDS) and establishing standards for data. This helps to manage your master data from a single system and push it to other systems\n\nAccess management: Make sure that everyone in your organization who needs access to this data has the appropriate level of permissions. This helps you to prevent unauthorized changes or deletion of critical information.\n\nMonitoring: Implement a system for monitoring and reporting on changes or anomaly detection to your master data. This will help you quickly identify any issues or discrepancies. Thereby not having a negative impact on your business over time.\n\nWhen you have master data management implemented, you have taken a very big step towards successfully working with data. But what is often still lacking is uniformity within the organization regarding the definitions of business metrics, by which you measure the organization’s performance.\n\nBusiness Metric Definition\n\nHaving your master data management processes is just one piece of the puzzle. It's equally important to get a clear understanding of what business metrics are and how they can be used to inform your decision-making. A business metric is a quantifiable measure that is used to track and assess the performance of a company or specific aspect of its business. Common business metrics include measures such as revenue, profit, costs, expenses, customer satisfaction levels, and employee productivity.\n\nHowever, as you already know, every person in your organization might be familiar with each of these business metrics, but do they truly know what the definition of such a metric is? Simply put; do they know what data is used as input, how it is processed and in what shape or form it is used to calculate the be metric?\n\nThe art of defining and aligning on the definition of a business metric is equally important as having your master-data in order. However, at a lot of organizations the assumption is that \"it speaks for itself\" when it comes to the business metric's definition. It would surprise you how many variations and interpretations for a single business metric exist within your organization or let alone your team.\n\nTake for instance the business metric ‘recognized revenue’. A common metric used within the eCommerce-space. Do you know what it means? The meaning is simple; At what moment in time in the sales process is the amount of a transaction recognized as revenue? Is it the moment when an order is placed (order date)? when the order is invoiced (invoice date)? Or when the order is actually delivered to the customer (delivery date)?\n\nWhat data makes up the 'cost price' for a product? Is this purely the purchase price? Do we also need to consider some additional conditional costing such as the average time a product was in the warehouse? Or whether it needs to be kept in a freezer?\n\nAnd finally, how about 'gross margin'. Is this just the turnover minus the cost price of a product? Or does it also comprise giveaways or bonus reservation per contractual agreements with a customer?\n\nDefining the definition of business metrics is not hard. The hard part is aligning on the definitions with everyone in the organization. It is crucial to reach uniformity and with that reach singularity and get rid of multiple interpretations.\n\nDo you have both your master-data-management and business metric-definition in order. Great! But you have multiple applications such as ERP, MES, PLC, each containing a subset of the master-data and business-metrics. So, how do you facilitate an organizational wide overview of your organization and prevent data silos? Enter the common data model.\n\nCommon Data Model\n\nEvery application has its own data model. As any organization you will expand over time and might even acquire other companies in the process. Your IT-landscape and thereby data-landscape has changed significantly. There are differences between each application's data model, technology, and interfacing capabilities. Which poses a challenge for anyone who wants to have an organization-wide overview and properly report on it.\n\nIf you do not address this accordingly, you run the risk of each department or subsidiary collecting and processing their own data. And even worse, performing their own calculations to get the business metrics. Which in its turn results in a weekly or monthly excel-file with 'analytical data' rather than 'transactional data'', without any possibility to check on correctness and completeness.\n\nTime is valuable. People need to be doing what they were hired for; providing the best possible service to customers and facilitating continuous growth of the organization through actionable insights and data-driven decision making processes. To achieve this, the data from the various applications and locations must be centrally collected, processed, and made available in a 'common data model'. Giving both the subsidiaries itself and the organization insight into its performance.\n\nThe Common Data Model (CDM) aims to model data domains (e.g. location, product, relationship, transaction) and mutual relationships as simply as possible. The CDM always contains the required master data attributes and uniform business metrics to enable location-specific and organizational overarching insight available for analytical purposes.\n\nIn addition to the analytical insight, a CDM brings the following benefits at an operational level:\n\nIntegration optimization: Without a CDM, the more system you have, the more transformations required. With a CDM you reduce the manual integration work through standardization\n\nIncreased flexibility: Without a CDM, if an IT system changes, you would need to adapt all interfaces to other IT systems. With a CDM you only need to adjust the new IT systems interface.\n\nBusiness logic simplification: Without a CDM business logic management is fragmented. With a CDM the business logic is managed in one place. Switching out a system requires you to adjust that one.\n\nBy combining the master-data and business metrics and implementing them into a CDM, the organizational data foundation is set up for success. If you don't set up the organizational data foundation properly, do not start with the technical data foundation. You can put all the data in your dream data platform. But without proper master data management, clear business metric definitions, and a common data model, you will end up with just that...a bunch of data. Not the actionable insights and data-driven decisions your organization needs.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe absolute cornerstone of your dream data platform is the organizational data foundation. It comprises the set up and execution master data management, business metric definition, and common data model maintenance for the whole organization. This is not a one-off exercise but a continuous process which on going and data owners need to be appointed for each respective functional data domain. If one of the three is not properly set up and maintained there is no point starting with the technical data foundation."
