        "text": "\"The fact that DHL is opening one of Europe's most efficient parcel centers in Bochum is further proof of the attractiveness of the Ruhr region and strengthens North Rhine-Westphalia as a leading logistics location. Investments in the Ruhr region are worthwhile for companies - as the development of the former Opel site in Bochum, supported by state funding, once again demonstrates. DHL's investment is providing 600 people in the area with future-proof employment, and a large number of other companies will be creating thousands more jobs in the next few years. New companies, high innovation potential and well-paid jobs - that is exactly what the state government is giving momentum to through the Ruhr Conference. We want to quickly translate technical solutions from the laboratories into practice, be attractive to start-up entrepreneurs and use brownfield sites for new developments. The latter has been achieved on the Opel site in Bochum by companies such as DHL,\" says Armin Laschet.\n\n\"DHL's choice of location at Mark 51°7 was a strong signal of a new departure and a sign of confidence in the future viability of the city and the entire region. Bochum Perspective 2022 immediately prepared the ground, thereby laying the foundations for the revitalization of the area. Today, it is the site of one of the most efficient and state-of-the-art parcel centers in Europe. Soon, there will be 600 people working here, and soon also more than 6,000 in the complex as a whole. I am delighted that DHL has chosen Bochum as its business location, and that the success story of Mark 51°7 continues,\" says Thomas Eiskirch.\n\nIn 2016, Deutsche Post DHL Group acquired approximately 140,000 square meters of space at the former Opel site in Bochum-Laer. Construction of the parcel center began in fall 2017 and was completed on schedule within two years. The new parcel center building alone covers an area of 40,000 square meters, equivalent to the size of more than five football fields. In addition, extensive measures were taken to make sure the new location is as energy-efficient as possible in line with Deutsche Post DHL Group's sustainability strategy. For example, the parcel center is supplied with electricity and heat by its own block-type thermal power station. The Group therefore not only procures electricity or heat, but also feeds the heat generated in the block-type thermal power station into Bochum's public utility network. A roof-mounted photovoltaic system is also planned. Power-saving LED lamps controlled by presence detectors and daylight are used to illuminate the parcel center. With 35 charging columns of its own, the Bochum location is already well-equipped for the further expansion of e-mobility, with further charging columns to follow. Deutsche Post DHL has invested a three-digit million sum in the location."
