        "text": "Two different typologies of data are available for participants:\n\n1) Nadir and oblique aerial images both on Zurich and Dortmund (Zeche Zollern)\n\n2) Combined block (UAV and terrestrial images) on Dortmund (Zeche Zollern)\n\nParticipants' results will be evaluated according to the methodology described by Cavegn et al. (2014). The necessary images have been already oriented for the data delivery, and no GCPs or CPs will be provided.\n\nFor more information about the delivered data on Dortmund (Zeche Zollern) and Zurich, please refer to the dedicated webpages.\n\nThe IMAGE ORIENTATION (IO) benchmark aims to assess the state-of-the-art in multi-platform and multi-view image orientation and calibration. One current problem is to retrieve reliable and efficient matches when large different perspectives and scales are available, such as in modern multi-camera oblique systems, or when UAV-based images are to be combined with images taken from the ground.\n\nFor this benchmark again two image sets are available:\n\n1) Nadir and oblique aerial images Dortmund (Centre)\n\n2) Combined block (UAV and terrestrial images) on Dortmund (Centre)\n\nWe will provide some selected ground control points and evaluate the bundle block adjustment result through residuals at check points and tie point quality at planar faces. Details are described in Nex et al. (2015).\n\nFor further information about the acquired data in Dortmund, see the description below.\n\nTerms of use\n\nThe data users should include the following acknowledgement in any publication resulting from the dataset: \"The authors would like to acknowledge the provision of the datasets by ISPRS and EuroSDR, released in conjuction with the ISPRS scientific initiative 2014 and 2015, lead by ISPRS ICWG I/Vb.\"\n\nThe benchmark team would appreciate if participants could cite the following paper reporting the aims of the benchmark and the data detailed description:\n\nNex, F., Gerke, M., Remondino, F., Przybilla H.-J., BÃ¤umker, M., Zurhorst, A., 2015. ISPRS Benchmark for Multi-Platform Photogrammetry. ISPRS Annals of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Vol. II-3/W4, pp.135-142.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nData acquisition and pre-processing was made feasible through the funds provided by ISPRS (Scientific Initiative) and EuroSDR. Further we are grateful to Aerowest GmbH for sponsoring part of the PentaCam flight. We thank Pix4D for providing us a research license of Pix4Dmapper."
