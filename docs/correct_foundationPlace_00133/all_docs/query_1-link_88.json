        "text": "What is ESERO?\n\nThe European Space Education Resource Office (ESERO) project is ESA's main way of supporting early years, primary and secondary education community in Europe.\n\nESERO uses space related themes and the genuine fascination felt by young people for space to enhance school pupils’ literacy and competence in STEM-related subjects. The ESERO project also highlights the associated applications from space and raises awareness of the large range of career prospects in the space domain.\n\nBy using the space context to make the teaching and learning of STEM subjects more attractive and accessible, pupils can feel more comfortable and familiar with sciences in general. The ESERO activities aim to help bring STEM subjects within the pupils reach, demolishing the misconception that science is only for geniuses. Space, in particular, becomes not just a place of inspiration and future dreams, but also part of everyday life.\n\nESERO offer an annual series of national or regional training sessions for early years, primary and secondary school educators and teachers. These are offered in collaboration with national partners who are already active in STEM education. Educator and teacher trainings are, wherever possible, officially accredited as part of continual professional development qualifications.\n\nESERO uses and disseminates existing ESA/ESERO space-related STEM classroom resources, and if appropriate, develops specific new resources tailored to the education system and national curricula. Real space data and their applications in real-life using scientific methodology, accompanied by role model support of real space experts such as scientists, engineers, and even astronauts, are used as much as possible.\n\nThe ESERO project also help stimulate young people’s awareness of Europe’s space programme and of its importance for society and economy.\n\nWhere is ESERO located?\n\nThe most effective form of space-based education must be the one that supports the specific educational needs of the various Member States, all having different educational systems, different school curricula and, last but not least, different languages. To that end, the ESEROs are distributed across Member and Associate States, and staffed by local experts who work in strong synergy and partnership with their national education authorities and networks.\n\nCurrently ESA has established ESERO national offices in twenty-two countries – twenty-one ESA Member States and one Associate State: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Slovenia, Sweden and UK.\n\nESERO Austria: based in the ARS Electronica Centre in Linz, a very modern science centre focusing on arts an science, it is co-funded by FFG and ARS Electronica Centre.\n\nESERO Belgium: ESERO Belgium is based at KU Leuven University,and is operated with a network of key players in STEM education such as: La Scientothèque, the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) and UGent volkssterrenwacht Armand Pien.

ESERO France is led by CNES, and is implemented in close collaboration with national partners, such as: the Citéde l’Espace (Science and Space Museum), the national network Planète Sciences, as well as the La Fondation La Main à la Pate (through the Maisons pour la Science). ESERO France is jointly co-funded nationally by CNES, and includes partner’s contributions.\n\nESERO Germany: ESERO Germany is implemented through a consortium of partners in close collaboration with the German Aerospace Center DLR. The consortium is led by the Geomatics Research Group of the Ruhr-University of Bochum and further includes the Remote Sensing Research Group of University of Bonn (UoB); the Zeiss Planetarium Bochum; the Bochum Observatory; the Hausdorff Center for Mathematics (UoB); the Physics Institute (UoB); the Argelander-Institute of Astronomy (UoB); the Institute of Physics Education at Cologne University; and zdi.NRW. ESERO Germany is co-funded nationally by the members of the consortium.\n\nESERO Greece: Based at the Aristotle University in Tessaloniki.
