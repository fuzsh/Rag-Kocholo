Since 2020, this event has been organised to determine the winner of the prestigious ECSO STARtup Award. This year, ECSO is embracing innovation by extending the event to feature not only the traditional ECSO STARtup Award category but also a brand-new award category – the ECSO CISO Choice Award.\n\nWhereas the ECSO STARtup Award aims to bring European cybersecurity start-ups and investors together and therefore provide opportunities to access finance, the ECSO CISO Choice Award will host larger European companies with established solutions and financing in an effort to facilitate their access to the market. Overall, the event aims to highlight and celebrate European cybersecurity excellence, promote European-made products, drive innovation and stimulate investments in the European cybersecurity market.\n\nWe extend a warm welcome to European cybersecurity providers, investors, end-users, and other leaders in the cybersecurity industry to attend this event!"
