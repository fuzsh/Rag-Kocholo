        "text": "Excerpted with permission from “The Digital Transformation of a Metropolitan New York Health System,” Frontiers of Health Services Management, Volume 38 Number 3.\n\nThe Digital Transformation of a Metropolitan New York Health System\n\nBy Adrin Mammen, MS, MBA, FACHE; Assoc. VP, Patient Access Transformation Officer, Montefiore Medical Center\n\nA digital front door allows patients to choose the right provider based on medical condition, location, health insurance, availability of appointments, and personal preferences.\n\nMontefiore Health System's digital patient experience initiatives are tied to a mobile-first strategy: Every process that involves patients should include digital options that are accessible through a mobile device. In other words, our mobile app is the apex built upon a foundation of essential provider data.\n\nWe knew that going to market with multiple digital channels for patients was not going to work without a central source of provider data truth. Provider data management is the cornerstone of patient access. With that foundational piece firmly in place, we could then add online features such as chatbots and online scheduling. In September 2020, when our outpatient clinics reopened following the initial COVID-19 closures, we instituted pre-appointment check-ins to reduce contact between patients and front-desk staff.\n\nA user-friendly provider directory is an essential part of our patient acquisition strategy. We selected symplr as our cloud-based data management platform to build and maintain robust individual provider profiles. Such information can help patients connect with the right doctors. At the same time, it adds to operational efficiencies by enabling patient self-service. The directory takes in data from various sources, including the EHR and credentialing systems.\n\nPatients can search in the provider directory using either basic or clinical terminology and be matched with a provider that is best suited for their needs. Other search criteria such as specialty and location enhance the patient experience.\n\nHaving a solid data management platform also eases the management of multiple provider profiles. Staff across the health system maintain the provider data and update it when it changes. These updates are available for searches in real time.\n\nPhysicians access the same directory to find an in-network specialist for referral purposes. We are working to facilitate communication—among primary care providers, specialists, and patients—throughout the referral process by developing various technology-driven workflows.\n\nFor example, the directory system proactively sends out a text message when a referral order is placed, which allows a patient to self-schedule with a specialist or click a link to reach the call center. In the process, we are leveraging direct messaging technology that would allow for enhanced communication across the EHR system between the referring physician’s EHR and ours.\n\nAfter searching for a provider, patients can schedule their appointment online. Scheduling is real time, based on the provider’s current availability. When a patient schedules an appointment, that time slot is immediately removed from the list of available appointments from the EHR system.\n\nAn accurate provider directory and online scheduling are essential for acquiring new patients, improving the patient experience, maximizing utilization, and keeping patients in our network.\n\nWhen the appointment is scheduled, the patient receives digital reminders and can confirm their appointment via text or e-mail in their preferred language. They can check in for their appointment—completing visit paperwork and paying any copayments—all online."
