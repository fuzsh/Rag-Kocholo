        "text": "Gain - and maintain - confidence in your data\n\nA robust data foundation enables critical decision-making, improves efficiencies, reduces project risk and decreases ongoing data maintenance costs. It also enables an organisation to respond readily to emerging regulations and standards.\n\n1Spatial has been at the forefront of data quality and governance for the past 30 years. We've helped more than 1,000 customers develop strong data foundations, unlocking the value of their data and enabling them to make critical decisions.\n\nSpeak to an expert\n\nWhat is a data foundation?\n\nA data foundation is defined as data that is:\n\nfit for purpose,\n\nrecorded in standardised formats (on modern, future-proof systems)\n\nand QFAIR – Quality, Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (Geospatial Commission)\n\nAre your data foundations strong enough?\n\nCan you trust your data for accurate predictions, modelling and analysis?\n\nIs your data findable, accessible, interoperable, accurate and complete?\n\nDoes your data need to conform with key industry standards or regulations?\n\nThe benefits of robust data\n\nThere are far-reaching benefits to building strong data foundations, including improved data sharing and interoperability, greater efficiency, being able to make better use of existing data, and improved decision-making. Read more about the benefits of strong data foundations.\n\nView our case studies\n\nAbout 1Spatial\n\nOperating at the intersection of Master Data Management and Geospatial Information Systems, 1Spatial are pioneers in Location Master Data Management (LMDM).\n\nLocation Master Data Management ensures that your data management process is automated and repeatable across your enterprise and different technology platforms.\n\nUsing our powerful rules-based technology, we automate the data validation, auditing, cleansing, synchronising and governance of spatial and non-spatial datasets across the entire data ecosystem, enabling better decisions and greater insights.\n\nLMDM delivers significant cost and time savings, and crucially, data that you can trust and rely upon – enabling you to maintain the quality and integrity of your data as it continues to evolve.\n\nIt also prepares your data for system replacement and consolidation if needed. Unlike traditional MDM, LMDM provides you with the right location-enabled technology to meet your unique needs for spatial and non-spatial data.\n\nAbout our rules-based approach\n\n1Spatial’s pioneering rules-based approach uses automation to give you power over your data, putting you in control so that you can be confident it is current, complete, consistent and compliant.\n\nA rules-based approach ensures that processes are:\n\neasily automated\n\nrepeatable across the enterprise and\n\nrepeatable across different technology platforms.\n\nOur technology is designed to manage complex, multivariable rules on data, irrespective of size. The rules engine that sits at the heart of our technology was developed by drawing on over 30 years’ experience in the management of geospatial data.\n\nFind out why 1Spatial’s technology powers some of the largest and most complex data sets in the world.\n\nFind out more\n\nWhat sets us apart from traditional GIS providers\n\nAlthough geospatial data can be handled by traditional GIS software or some database tools, there are key exceptions – which is where 1Spatial’s technology sets us apart, and critically, helping save customers time and money:\n\nNo need for centralisation: Traditional software providers can typically only handle data that has already been centralised into one environment. 1Spatial tools can check and cross-reference the data from different sources and without needing them to be pre-loaded into a central system.\n\nNo-code rules development - Other systems don't provide no-code rules development and often require queries or code to be written by specialist developers.\n\nScale and complexity of data - Other systems can struggle with the performance of large amounts of complex cross-referencing needed between the data records.\n\nCloud-based data upload portal - Other systems don’t provide an out-of-the box, secure, multi-tenancy data upload portal as a way to aggregate data and automatically apply rules.\n\nFind out more"
