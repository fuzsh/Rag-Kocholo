Please note: The office space available in the Funkhaus for WORLDFACTORY teams is limited. This is why we will review your application carefully. We favour start-ups that want to use the Funkhaus as their primary workspace. We also give preference to teams that are not provided with a room by their departments or have already started up. Would you like to submit your application, visit the premises or do you have any questions? Please write an e-mail to startup-office@rub.de.\n\nThe application form for the offices is available here."
