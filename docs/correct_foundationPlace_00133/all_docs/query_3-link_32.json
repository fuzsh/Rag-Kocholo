        "text": "BRING DATA TO LIFE TO IMPROVE THE WORLD OF DYSTROPHINOPATHIES: Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy, and (manifesting) carriers.\n\nThe Duchenne Data Foundation (DDF) works in close collaboration with the World Duchenne Organization (WDO) to achieve the best possible outcomes for the global dystrophinopathy community. This includes people living with Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (DMD and BMD), as well as people carrying the Duchenne and/or Becker gene mutation.\n\nMaking an impact for the DMD community\n\nDDF brings together all sources of data related to dystrophinopathies, to make an impact for the global DMD community. We do this by building innovative approaches to connecting data, and to promote knowledge sharing that will form our strategy into the future. The Duchenne Data Foundation, has also endorsed since 2019 the FAIR Data Declaration of the World Duchenne Organization.\n\nOur strategic direction is built around four key pillars:\n\nDDF connects data to generate new evidence for more efficient and faster research in therapy development and care. Our aim is to create an environment of dystrophinopathy data from various sources and locations. At the same time, we are committed to following the strict standards of data governance and ‘FAIR’ principles. This evidence will inform the development of best care practises and therapies. At the same time, this will support and inform regulatory and policy processes.\n\nDDF strives for all people living with dystrophinopathies around the world to have access to the latest standards of care and the best quality of life. This includes early diagnosis and surveillance alongside quality of life initiatives. We will achieve this by collecting and analyzing data related to patient needs and preferences and connecting patients with the services they need.\n\nDDF provides training to all stakeholders. Our goal is to empower the global dystrophinopathy community voice to ensure research is patient and family centred and led. DDF will work alongside WDO to facilitate the exchange of timely, evidence based and accurate information. This will enable all stakeholders to make informed decisions. This includes, but is not limited to, training on clinical trials and research, and patients being in control of their data.\n\nDATA GOVERNANCE & ACCESS\n\nPatients should be in control of their own data. DDF advocates for people living with dystrophinopathies to be in control of their own data. At the same time, the dystrophinopathy community should be in the position to benefit from the insights of the data. Patients should own, control and share their data.\n\nWe lead and support a variety of internal, European and collaborative projects to improve the world of dystrophinopathies."
