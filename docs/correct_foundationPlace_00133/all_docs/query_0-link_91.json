        "text": "The rapid and promising development of applications and communication systems designed for groups of participants like groupware, computer supported collaborative work systems, or digital conference systems implies exigence of mechanisms providing adequate security properties. These mechanisms can be designed based on the foundations of cryptography.\n\nGroup key exchange protocols are multi-party cryptographic protocols those participants compute a shared secret key that can then be used in conjunction with other cryptographic constructions like encryption schemes and message authentication codes for the purpose of privacy, confidentiality and authentication.\n\nSecurity confidence of modern cryptographic constructions can be increased via adequate security proofs. The paradigm of provable security gains in importance for all kinds of cryptographic constructions, including group key exchange protocols those security issues represent the scope of this dissertation.\n\nWe give an analytical overview of the state-of-the-art research in this area and identify strengths and weaknesses of many previous approaches. We suggest a new approach in form of a security model those stronger definitions provide background for more confident security analyzes and proofs. Additionally, we present a number of generic solutions (compilers) that can be applied to independently designed group key exchange protocols in order to enhance security thereof with respect to various goals considered by our security model. Finally, we present a concrete group key exchange protocol that provably satisfies the apparently strongest currently available formally specified security requirements.\n\nBook Publication\n\nMark Manulis: Provably Secure Group Key Exchange\n\nEditors: Christof Paar, Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi, Jörg Schwenk\n\nSeries: IT Security\n\nVolume: 5\n\nPublisher: Europäischer Universitätsverlag\n\nDate: 08/08/2007\n\nISBN: 978-3-89966-275-7\n\n232 pages, english, paperback, 21x15 cm, 24.90 €\n\nOrder Information\n\nin USA The University Press Bochum, c/o Ms Lei Song, 2504 Grant Ave #2, Redondo Beach CA 90278 USA, phone +1 310 379-9031, fax +1 209 729-5412, email us@bou.de\n\nin Europe The University Press Bochum, Querenburger Höhe 281, 44801 Bochum, Germany, phone +49 234 971 978-0, fax -6, email bou@bou.de\n\nin Asia The University Press Bochum, c/o Ms Sylvia Xinghua WENG, 225 Chaoyang Beilu, Jinglong dasha, 1809 shi, 100026 Beijing, phone +86 10 8595-2711, fax -2712, email china@bou.de\n\nvia Amazon\n\nDownload\n\nYou can also download my thesis and supplementary material: [PDF], [BiBTeX], [Slides]\n\n01/12/2003 Start at Network and Data Security Group, Ruhr University Bochum, under supervision of Prof. Jörg Schwenk\n\n07/02/2007 Submission to the Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Ruhr University Bochum\n\n26/06/2007 Defence (with summa cum laude)\n\nExamination Committee"
