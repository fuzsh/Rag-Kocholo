        "text": "South of the inoperative railway line, which today offers a top-notch cycling and hiking trail as the Springorum route, the PARK TRIO is a modern residential district with a well-established infrastructure and green environment. A total of 59 flats in three multi-family houses with two to three rooms ensure a modern quality of life and living.\n\nThe three buildings appeal with their modern clear-line architecture and trendy, timeless façade design matched to the staggered floors in colour. Floor-to-ceiling windows, balconies, terraces and roof terraces allow for a lot of light in the flats and extend them outside. Almost all balconies and terraces face the south or west, as well as the gardens, which are part of the ground floor flats as special use areas – so you can still enjoy the evening sun even at the end of the day. All buildings meet KfW’s Efficiency House 55 (GEG) requirements and also comply with regulations for noise protection and feature efficient ventilation technology. Waste disposal areas and 59 underground parking spaces can be easily reached from the street.\n\nWhether net or pharmacy, bakery or fast food – the most important local amenities are within walking distance. A kindergarten and a medical practice are just as close. With several bus and underground lines, public transport provides reliable mobility for shopping and strolling in the city centre. Three lines are served at the bus stop nearby. Even those who travel by car can easily reach the city centre or the surrounding area via the connection to the Oviedo-Ring clearway and the A40 motorway. Proximity to the local recreational areas Schlosspark Weitmar, Weitmarer Holz and Kemnader Lake are loved by families as well as nature lovers, culture and sports enthusiasts, who can also let off steam on the basketball court at the Kuhlenkamp or the Weitmar bike park. In addition, many leisure destinations and attractions become the highlights of a relaxing nature hike.\n\nDistances:\n\nBochum city centre 7 km/33 min. by public transport/13 min. by car\n\nBochum Railway Station 5 km/21 min. by public transport/11 min. by car\n\nDüsseldorf Airport 44 km/30 min. by car\n\nKemnader lake 12 km/58 min. by public transport/11 min. by car\n\nBochum Observatory 4 km/17 min. by public transport/7 min. by car\n\nAs the sixth-largest city in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Bochum has become known as the centre of the Ruhr district, primarily through coal mining. With industrialisation, Bochum rose to become a coal mining town and focused for decades on mining and the steel industry. In the 1960s, the city developed into the cultural centre of the Ruhr district and became a symbol of structural change with the settlement of Adam Opel AG on former colliery sites. Today, the economic centre of gravity is mainly on services and education. Media, art and culture have replaced mining and the steel industry. As a university city, Bochum is not only known for the Ruhr University, which was founded in 1965, but also offers a wide range of degree programmes for people from all over the world who are interested, including the University of Applied Sciences, the EBZ Business School and the Schauspielschule (drama school) Bochum. The city enjoys excellent transport connections with the A 40, A 43 and A 448 federal motorways and also offers quick access to the region with the B 51, B 226 and B 235 federal roads. As a city without a port, Bochum has an extensive network of train connections and at least ten railway stations. Regional trains, the S-Bahn, ICE and IC lines provide reliable connections. In addition, public transport with the underground, trams and buses makes sure you get to your destination comfortably.\n\nInstead of mines and steelworks, extensive recreational areas are now prevalent in the south of Bochum, where the old mining and steelworker areas have given way to modern green areas with cultural and art exhibition spaces. Here, in the placid and particularly green district of Weitmar-Mark, there are first and foremost lots of single-and multi-family houses as well. Spacious gardens and fields, strips of forests and isolated farmsteads make it almost look like a village. The quiet location and the neighbourly atmosphere, as well as its good transport connections, have made the district more and more popular over the last 30 years. With bakeries, butchers, supermarkets and restaurants, retail and gastronomy also offer amenities with no hassle. Once a week there is a market where people like to meet up and “chat”. Art and culture in the middle of the ‘green lung’ offer a perfect synergy in Weitmar-Mark. Not only can you enjoy nature in the Schlosspark, but also art at the MuT (Museum unter Tage) or theatre performances in the old Sylvesterkapelle chapel. For night owls, the former locksmith’s shop at the Prinz Regent colliery is a renowned place where people gather for parties and concerts. For nature lovers, the Weitmarer Holz, the largest contiguous forest area in Bochum with an area of 80 hectares, but also the Jörgenstein or the game enclosure, offers idyllic spots for local recreation."
