Companies who harness data to derive value through data-driven decisioning are differentiating themselves.\n\nDataâ€™s worth depends on its accessibility and application. Cloud is the only place where data gains scale, agility and the power to drive reinvention so business can soar. Migration is (just) the start. Companies should take steps to modernize their data foundation, so their people can operate with data and cloud innovation at their fingertips."
