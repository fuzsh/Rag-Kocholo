        "text": "Langen Foundation for events in Neuss\n\nThe Langen Foundation is one of the most spectacular event venues in the Düsseldorf area. Built by star architect Tadao Ando, the fascinating location is known worldwide as the home of Marianne and Viktor Langen's art collection.\n\nThe modern masterpiece of concrete, glass and steel harmonizes perfectly with the surrounding nature. All rooms are clearly structured and offer an excellent backdrop for your spectacular event, an impressive presentation as well as for incentives, conferences, congresses or meetings. Thanks to perfect lighting conditions and the latest technology, streaming events as well as film and photo productions are also in good hands at the Lange Foundation. A total of up to 350 people can be accommodated at events.\n\nSix meters below ground are the room bodies Moderne 1 and Moderne 2, where mostly contemporary art is exhibited. You can use both rooms individually or in combination with each other.\n\nThe Japan Room, which offers a fantastic view of the surrounding area, is also suitable for receptions. Mainly Japanese art objects are exhibited here. The Japan Room is a concrete cube with access to the glass veranda. You are also welcome to include the spacious outdoor area in your event planning.\n\nThe staff at the Langen Foundation in Neuss will be happy to help you plan and execute events.\n\n© fiylo Deutschland GmbH"
