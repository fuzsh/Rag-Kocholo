        "text": "\"From the perspective of the real estate industry, the Ruhr metropolitan region has great economic potential that is far from being exhausted. To promote its development in an advisory capacity, JLL can contribute its experience from successful regions worldwide.\"\n\nMarcel Abel Managing Director, JLL SE\n\n\"One result of the RAG Foundation Future Study states that in the future it will be important to respond in a networked and dynamic way to the increasingly fast-paced global economy. This is where the Business Metropole Ruhr comes in. I am pleased to be able to contribute to this through my work on the Board of Trustees.\"\n\nBärbel Bergerhoff-Wodopia Member of the Board, RAG Foundation\n\n\"The Ruhr region is an attractive location for industrial companies - we at thyssenkrupp Steel in Duisburg, Dortmund, Bochum, Gelsenkirchen and Hohenlimburg also benefit from the excellent infrastructure, strong networks and committed partners. The current transformation processes are both a challenge and an opportunity for the region, which can develop into a major hub in the hydrogen economy, for example. We, too, are investing massively in the transformation and the future requirements of the market. With my participation in the Board of Trustees, I would like to contribute to bringing the Ruhr Metropolis even further forward in these topics.\"\n\nDr. Heike Denecke-Arnold Member of the Board / Chief Operating Officer(COO), thyssenkrupp Steel Europe AG\n\n\"Cohesion, openness, diversity - these are core values that have defined the people in this region for decades. Values that are worth continuing to build on in order to further strengthen the business location. On this basis, I look forward to supporting the Business Metropole Ruhr and helping to shape the region's future.\"\n\nArnd Fittkau Member of the Board, Vonovia\n\n\"From the Ruhr for the Ruhr. FUNKE Mediengruppe accompanies the transformation of the Ruhr Metropolis directly on site. This development provides exciting stories. On the BMR Board of Trustees, I am committed to driving this change forward together with others.\"\n\nSimone Kasik Chief Financial Officer, FUNKE\n\n\"Digitization - the top topic of our time. The Ruhr Metropolis has the potential to take a leading position here. I am therefore involved in the BMR Board of Trustees in order to actively shape the digital economy as well as digitization in healthcare.\"\n\nJörg Holstein Managing Director, MEERKAT Holding GmbH\n\n\"The Ruhr region has developed into one of the IT security hotspots. G DATA CyberDefense AG has been part of this history for over 35 years. The lively start-up scene in the Ruhr region gives an idea of how many treasures there are still to be unearthed in other areas as well. This requires mentors and a strong network within and outside the region.\"\n\nJessika Lüning Corporate Officer, G DATA CyberDefense AG\n\n\"Intelligent networking is the basis for long-term success in the future - this applies to new mobility just as much as to constant further development of companies. The commitment to an economically strong region at the Business Metropole Ruhr enables me to have a comprehensive exchange with a large number of innovative companies and movers and shakers.\"\n\nTobias Nadjib Managing Director, Volkswagen Infotainment GmbH\n\n\"With its good infrastructure and many industrial and research companies in the fields of IT, energy, healthcare and automotive supply, the Ruhr region is an attractive business location for companies. In addition, innovative key technologies ensure the competitiveness of domestic industry in our region.\"\n\nDr. Arndt Neuhaus Managing Director, ANVIG GmbH\n\n\"Change through culture - culture through change, the 2010 Capital of Culture proved it: the Ruhr Metropolis can unleash incredible power if everyone stands behind one goal, contributes their skills and works together. The BMR Board of Trustees stands for exactly that.\"\n\nProf. Dr. Oliver Scheytt Managing Director, KULTUREXPERTEN Dr. Scheytt GmbH\n\n\"Business Metropole Ruhr GmbH defines itself as a link between politics and business in the extended part of the Ruhr Metropolis. I support the board of trustees, among other things, because I see great opportunities for promoting business for our region on the Ruhr. In particular, this involves supporting existing companies, but also promoting new businesses - startups, also in cooperation with the universities and colleges.\"\n\nReinhold Schulte Chairman of the Supervisory Board, Signal Iduna Group\n\n\"The Ruhr region stands for hard work, honest dealings with one another and quality. These are important values for many medium-sized companies, and for us at Stauder they have been for six generations. I would like to bring the perspective of a family business to the BMR Board of Trustees.\"\n\nDr. Thomas Stauder Managing Director, Privatbrauerei Jacob Stauder GmbH & Co. KG"
