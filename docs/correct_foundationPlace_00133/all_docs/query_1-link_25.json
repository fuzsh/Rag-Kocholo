        "text": "Due to its excellent network structure, the Health Campus Bochum agency and the professionally competent environment, the health care destination Bochum has an excellent foundation for further development into an \"innovation space\" Smart Health Data. Bochum sees itself as a reference market for new medical procedures and products. In recent years, the city has become a hotspot for medical IT in development, production, and application.\n\nHowever, digitalisation and the use of medical IT also increase the risk of IT security or cyber attacks. Critical medical infrastructure is particularly worthy of protection. Bochum's expertise offers the best prerequisites for ensuring this protection:\n\nBochum is the scientific centre of European IT security research\n\nwith the Horst GÃ¶rtz Institute (HGI) for IT Security\n\nwith the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy\n\nwith the Cluster of Excellence \"CASA: Cyber Security in the Age of Large-Scale Adversaries\" at Ruhr University Bochum"
