        "text": "thyssenkrupp Steel continues to press ahead with the implementation of its Steel Strategy 20-30. Yesterday, the foundation stone for a so-called double reversing stand was laid at the Bochum site. This unit will make it possible to produce even thinner and higher-strength steels in the future, mainly for electric mobility applications. The investment amounts to about 100 million euros. The unit is scheduled to be completed by summer 2023.\n\nBochum strengthens competencies in electric mobility and ultra high-strength steels\n\nIn the coming years, the plant on Essener Strasse will be expanded into a center of excellence for electric mobility. Dr. Heike Denecke-Arnold, Chief Operations Officer (COO) at thyssenkrupp Steel: \"The investment in the new double reversing stand is a clear signal for the Bochum site. We aim to further strengthen our competencies in ultra high-strength steels and in the field of electric mobility in order to distinguish ourselves more clearly through the quality of our products in the future as well. We want to produce even thinner and higher-strength sheets, for example, to help further increase the efficiency and thus the range of electric motors.\"\n\nIn the field of electric mobility, the trend is also towards ever thinner and highly silicized materials, which place increased demands on the cold rolling technology. The new double reversing stand will meet these demands and significantly enhance the siteâ€™s capabilities for non-grain-oriented electrical steel. With its back and forth (reversing) action, the mill stand will be able to roll particularly thin materials with excellent flatness and tightest thickness tolerances. This is particularly important for sheets used in electric motors and generators, for example for wind turbines, because it can minimize core losses.\n\nMoreover, the new double reversing stand will strengthen the Bochum site's capabilities for ultra high-strength products for the automotive industry. Such steels are used, for example, in chassis and crash-relevant components and provide occupant protection. This investment will thus further enhance thyssenkrupp Steel's competencies in cost-efficient lightweighting for the automotive industry.\n\nInvestment safeguards site and employment\n\nThe new double reversing stand is only one of the major investments made within the scope of the Steel Strategy 20-30. In addition to this investment, for example an annealing and isolating line will be built, to be commissioned in 2024. Through these and other optimizations in the production network, quality improvements along the entire process chain at the Bochum site will allow the company to excel in ultra high-strength multiphase steels or in the optimized electrical steel grades of the future. The implementation of the Strategy 20-30 is thus also a signal for the development of Bochum as an industrial site, where thyssenkrupp currently employs about 2,400 people. Bochum's mayor Thomas Eiskirch: \"For all employees, and for the city, this multi-million investment is excellent news. With the establishment of a center of excellence for electric mobility, the future of employment here will be secured, and Bochum will remain an important steel location. We're delighted about this.\""
