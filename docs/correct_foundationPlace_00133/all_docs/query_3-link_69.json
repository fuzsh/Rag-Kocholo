Participants will not only explore essential statistical concepts but also the art of data storytelling and visualization, making it a comprehensive introductory journey into data science and data literacy.\n\nThis was by far the best training course I have attended. The way it was structured and the support available from the instructor and TAs really made the learning valuable and lasting. I am looking forward to other courses in the near future!\n\nShoutout to the course team for helping me (and others) keep pushing along to make sure we get through the finish line, even when things are hard. I can't tell you how much I appreciate the accountability and extra help!\n\nCompleting this course has given me the foundation and confidence needed to make the full jump from Finance to Analytics Engineering. I've always felt like I needed a \"credential\" to make the full leap. Having gone through the course and learning with this community has made me feel like less of an \"imposter\" and like I have the skills/knowledge to do this as my profession (or at least know where to go to find the answers!). Really appreciative of the entire staff, TAs, cohort, pod, etc.\n\nThis course has been an amazing learning experience - no only because of the content of the course but also the way in which is taught! It has the perfect mix of online - individual work - community time and resources. The teaching materials are very high quality and the whole team are super attentive and responsive.\n\nIt's a great way to learn hands-on experience with dbt, get exposed to real life problems, industry experts and also networking! I highly recommend it!\n\nAbsolutely stoked to share this! Over the last month I had the pleasure of learning from some of the great minds coming out of Facebook, Google, and other enterprises doing bleeding edge work in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Being part of a select cohort spanning three continents I was able to hear about initiatives and research from AI/ML professionals around the globe. NLP is a fast emerging sector that is changing the landscape of software everywhere you look. I'm so honored to be part of this experience and am taking away so many great connections and insights in a field that I really love."
