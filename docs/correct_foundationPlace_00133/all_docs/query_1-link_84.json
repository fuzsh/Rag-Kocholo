        "text": "The graduate school \"Confinement-controlled Chemistry“, funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG), is looking for top-class graduate students with an interest in exploring the influence of confinement on chemical processes. Our graduate school offers a three-year-program, starting July 1st, 2024, that combines cutting-edge research with a structured curriculum (in English) of lectures, colloquia and workshops in the fields of simulation/theory, spectroscopy, synthesis, and surface science. Further information on the tasks of the RTG qualification program can be found here.\n\nThe PhD project is on development and application of QM-based machine learning potentials for supramolecular metallacages and enzymes. Efficient and accurate potentials will be developed and applied to study confinement effects in metal-containing systems, such as supramolecular metallacages and metalloenzymes. The project involves a 3-month research stay in the group of the collaboration partner,Prof. Fernanda Duarte at Oxford University.\n\nYour profile:\n\nYou have an excellent Master’s degree (or equivalent) in (bio-)chemistry, (bio-)physics, or a related field\n\nYou are highly motivated and have a profound interest and preferably a strong background in theoretical/computational chemistry\n\nOur offer:\n\nExcellent supervision, working conditions, and research environment, including on-site HPC computing facilities\n\nParticipation in a dedicated education program\n\n3-year TVL E13 position, 26.6861 hrs/week\n\nNetworking within an interdisciplinary research training group\n\nThree-month research stay abroad\n\nParticipation at (inter)national conferences\n\nSoft skill training and career development\n\nWe look forward to your application. Please send it as a single PDF file (including a cover letter addressing your research interests and motivation, curriculum vitae, copies of M.Sc. and B.Sc. certificates (incl. transcript of grades) as well as university entrance diploma) to:\n\nProf. Dr. Lars Schäfer, Center for Theoretical Chemistry, Ruhr University Bochum, lars.schaefer@ruhr-uni-bochum.de\n\nThe Ruhr-Universität Bochum is one of Germany’s leading research universities, addressing the whole range of academic disciplines. A highly dynamic setting enables researchers and students to work across the traditional boundaries of academic subjects and faculties. To create knowledge networks within and beyond the university is RUB’s declared aim.\n\nThe Ruhr-Universität Bochum stands for diversity and equal opportunities. For this reason, we favour a working environment composed of heterogeneous teams, and seek to promote the careers of individuals who are underrepresented in our respective professional areas. The Ruhr-Universität Bochum expressly requests job applications from women. In areas in which they are underrepresented they will be given preference in the case of equivalent qualifications with male candidates. Applications from individuals with disabilities are most welcome."
