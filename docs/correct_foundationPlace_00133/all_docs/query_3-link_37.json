        "text": "From developing medicines and vaccines, to creating new medical devices, to performing genome analysis and DNA profiling, life sciences organizations across the globe have one thing in common: They all rely on data to accelerate innovation and to speed development of breakthrough medicine. But no matter what their end goal is, the success of any life sciences organization depends on how well they maximize the value of their data.\n\nAnd the first step is to build a solid foundation for your data with NetApp® life sciences solutions.\n\nThe struggle is real\n\nToday, the volume and variety of life sciences data are staggering. A recent study from Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development reveals that phase III clinical trials generate an average of 3.6 million data points—and that’s just one phase in the development lifecycle. With data coming in from multiple sources across edge, core, and cloud locations, life sciences organizations generate 2.5TB of data per day. As the mountain of data grows, the struggle to get the most value from that data becomes very real.\n\nOvercoming this struggle means letting your data go. Freeing it from impenetrable silos, legacy platforms, and a myriad of dysfunctional architectures.\n\nSharing is key\n\nA solid data foundation enables life sciences organizations to bring together and to share data across the organization—research, development, testing, administration, and corporate. A solid foundation results in stronger collaboration, more meaningful research, faster time to market, more effective resource usage, substantial savings, and, most importantly, better patient outcomes.\n\nWhen it comes to data, NetApp is the partner you want on your side. As a global, cloud-led, data-centric software company, NetApp empowers life sciences organizations like yours to lead with data in the age of accelerated digital transformation. NetApp offers a variety of first-party services and natively integrated storage solutions for each of the major public cloud providers, giving you freedom of choice when you’re building your data foundation.\n\nOnly NetApp delivers an integrated system that provides compatibility and interoperability between on-premises infrastructure and cloud storage. You get a true hybrid multicloud experience with flexibility, scalability, agility, and control. Your life sciences organization can use its NetApp data foundation to easily expand or contract infrastructure as needed, to move workloads to the public cloud, and to pull workloads back on premises as necessary. And in a time of budget restrictions that are tighter than ever, NetApp helps you reduce your IT spending and reallocate funds to more valuable initiatives.\n\nNeed proof? Some of the largest pharmaceutical companies, such as AstraZeneca and Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), use a NetApp data management foundation to speed development and clinical trial processes while maintaining compliance with local and international regulatory requirements.\n\nHarnessing the power of AI\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is changing the face of life sciences, and that transformation is powered by data. AI and machine learning (ML) promise more effective ways to recognize disease and to increase efficiencies in medical research and clinical trials. With the help of AI, life sciences organizations can design new drugs, identify the most appropriate drugs for specific conditions, and advance precision medicine faster than humans could, while also cutting costs. (Market research indicates the potential of up to $70 billion in savings for the drug discovery process by 2028.) And the speed that AI and ML deliver means that scientists and researchers can make new discoveries, publish results faster, speed up testing processes, and ultimately help medical practitioners save more lives.\n\nIt’s all about having data in the right place at the right time. NetApp AI solutions remove bottlenecks at the edge, core, and cloud to allow your data pipeline to flow freely, enabling more efficient data collection, accelerating AI workloads, and smoothing cloud integration.\n\nBuild your modern data foundation today\n\nNetApp’s veteran team of life sciences experts is ready to help you build your data foundation. Our team acts as an extension of yours to keep TCO as low as possible. Our tested, secure, compliant, nondisruptive, and high-performing solutions maximize the value of your data for clinical workloads.\n\nReady to get started?
