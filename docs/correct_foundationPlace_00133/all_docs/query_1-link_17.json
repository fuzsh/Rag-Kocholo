        "text": "The Exzenterhaus is a major orientation point for the city of Bochum, Germany. Its shape, with 15 polycentric rings set atop the solid foundation of a 22-meter, World War-II-era bomb shelter, would probably make it a landmark at any height. Each floor contains rounded, rentable office space, offering 360-degree views and copious natural light through full-height windows and balconies up to 1.6 meters deep. Communicating spiral staircases between floors in single-tenant spaces are also an option. Further uses may include light displays and use as a projection screen.\n\nThe bunker shaft provides a two-story reception area at the base. The remaining bunker floors serve as archival and storage space. The structural design of the building is a tour-de-force. The concrete structureâ€™s floor slabs cantilever up to 4.5 meters but are only 250 mm thick. This is supported by a conical spatial form activating membrane action in the slabs, as well as unbounded, pre-stressed tendons around the slab edges, to counteract cracking."
