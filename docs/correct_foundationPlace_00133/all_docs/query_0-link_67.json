        "text": "The \"US Funded Russian Research Tracker\" is a specialized tool developed to monitor and record instances of potentially problematic research collaborations between U.S. funding agencies and Russian entities. This initiative aligns with the OSTP's \"Guidance On Scientific and Technological Cooperation with the Russian Federation for U.S. Government and U.S. Government Affiliated Organizations.\" The tracker offers a detailed platform for scrutinizing projects based on their funding sources, affiliations, and detailed content in titles, abstracts, and texts. Its primary goal is to enhance transparency and provide rigorous oversight in light of changing geopolitical relations, with a particular focus on the nuances of U.S.-Russia research interactions as influenced by American policy directions. Designed for stakeholders, the tool facilitates a comprehensive assessment and management of the complexities in international scientific collaborations, with an emphasis on research activities spanning from 2022 to the present.\n\nExample: Filter University of California as an affiliation and the tracker will update the publications and individuals tables."
