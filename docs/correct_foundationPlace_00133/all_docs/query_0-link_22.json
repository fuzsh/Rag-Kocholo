Subject to legal or contractual permissions, we only process or have the data processed in a third country if the special requirements of Art. 44 ff. GDPR are met. This means that the processing is carried out, for example, on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognized determination of a data protection level that corresponds to the EU (e.g. for the USA through the “Privacy Shield”) or compliance with officially recognized special contractual obligations (so-called “standard contractual clauses”).\n\n6.

Some of the cookies serve security purposes or are necessary to operate our online offering (e.g. to display the website) or to save the user decision when confirming the cookie banner. In addition, we or our technology partners use cookies to measure reach and for marketing purposes, about which users will be informed in the course of the data protection declaration.\n\nA general objection to the use of cookies used for online marketing purposes can be declared for a large number of services, especially in the case of tracking, via the US site aboutads.info or the EU site youronlinechoices.com.

Unless expressly stated in this data protection declaration, the data stored by us will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required for their intended purpose and the deletion does not conflict with any legal retention obligations. Unless the data is deleted because it is required for other legally permissible purposes, its processing will be restricted. This means that the data will be blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for commercial or tax reasons.\n\n10.2. According to legal requirements, storage takes place in particular for 7 years in accordance with Section 132 Paragraph 1 BAO (accounting documents, receipts/invoices, accounts, receipts, business papers, list of income and expenses, etc.), for 22 years in connection with real estate and for 10 Years for documents relating to electronically provided services, telecommunications, radio and television services that are provided to non-entrepreneurs in EU member states and for which the Mini-One-Stop-Shop (MOSS) is used.\n\n11. Provision of contractual services (voucher purchase, online booking, application and registration)\n\n11.1. We process inventory data (e.g. names and addresses as well as contact details of users), contract data (e.g. services used, names of contact persons, payment information) in order to fulfill our contractual obligations and services in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit b. GDPR. The entries marked as mandatory in online forms are required for the conclusion of the contract.\n\n11.2. Nutzer können optional eine Online-Registrierung vornehmen. Im Rahmen der Registrierung, werden die erforderlichen Pflichtangaben den Nutzern mitgeteilt. Die Registrierungsdaten sind nicht öffentlich und können von Suchmaschinen nicht indexiert werden. Die Daten werden entsprechen der gesetzlichen Aufbewahrungspflicht oder aus handels- oder steuerrechtlichen Gründen entspr. Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. c DSGVO aufbewahrt.\n\n11.3. As part of registration and re-registration as well as use of our online services, we store the IP address and the time of the respective user action. The storage is based on our legitimate interests, as well as the user's protection against misuse and other unauthorized use. In principle, this data will not be passed on to third parties unless it is necessary to pursue our claims or there is a legal obligation to do so in accordance with Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR.\n\n11.4. We process usage data (e.g., the websites of our online offering visited, interest in our products) and content data (e.g., entries in the contact form or user profile) for advertising purposes in a user profile, for example in order to show the user product information based on the services they have previously used.\n\n11.5. The deletion takes place after the expiry of statutory warranty and comparable obligations; the necessity of storing the data is checked every three years; In the case of legal archiving obligations, deletion occurs after their expiry (end of commercial law (6 years) and tax law (10 years) retention obligations); Information in the customer account remains until it is deleted.\n\n12. Contact Us\n\n12.1. When you contact us (via contact form or email), the user's information will be processed to process the contact request and process it in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter b) GDPR.\n\n12.2.

In this case, we ourselves can be prosecuted for the comment or contribution and are therefore interested in the identity of the author.\n\n14. G-Data Anti-Spam Check\n\nWith G DATA Antivirus / Internet Security / Total Security (hereinafter: “G DATA antivirus software”) we provide you with protection against viruses, Trojans, phishing and other malware. G DATA antivirus software includes several components in which we process personal data\n\nIn the “Spam Filter” module, G DATA antivirus software processes incoming emails to analyze for spam. For this purpose, G Data works with the technology partner Cyren. In order to compare incoming emails with known spam messages, G DATA sends a hash value of these emails to Cyren. In individual cases it may happen that email content (e.g. the message header) is also transmitted to Cyren. This also serves to classify the respective message as spam. This data is processed to fulfill the contract for the use of the respective G DATA anti-virus software.\n\nSupport / Data Protection Officer / Data Protection Inquiries\n\nG DATA antivirus software is a product of G DATA Software AG, Königsallee 178, 44799 Bochum, Germany. G DATA Software AG is the responsible party in terms of data protection regulations. You can submit support requests using the contact form at gdata.de.\n\nUsers are welcome to use pseudonyms or forgo entering their name or email address. You can completely prevent the transfer of data by not using our comment system. That would be a shame, but unfortunately we don't see any other alternatives that work as effectively.\n\n15. Collection of access data and log files\n\n15.1. Based on our legitimate interests within the meaning of Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f of the GDPR, we collect data about every access to the server on which this service is located (so-called server log files). The access data includes the name of the website accessed, file, date and time of access, amount of data transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page), IP address and the requesting provider .\n\n15.2. Log file information is stored for security reasons (e.g. to investigate acts of abuse or fraud) for a maximum of seven days and then deleted. Data whose further storage is necessary for evidentiary purposes is excluded from deletion until the respective incident has been finally clarified.\n\n16. Online social media presence\n\n16.1. We maintain online presences within social networks and platforms in order to be able to communicate with customers, interested parties and users who are active there and inform them about our services. When accessing the respective networks and platforms, the terms and conditions and data processing guidelines of their respective operators apply.\n\n16.2. Soweit nicht anders im Rahmen unserer Datenschutzerklärung angegeben, verarbeiten wird die Daten der Nutzer sofern diese mit uns innerhalb der sozialen Netzwerke und Plattformen kommunizieren, z.B. Beiträge auf unseren Onlinepräsenzen verfassen oder uns Nachrichten zusenden.\n\n17. Cookies & range measurement\n\n17.1. Cookies are information that is transmitted from our web server or third-party web servers to users' web browsers and stored there for later retrieval. Cookies can be small files or other types of information storage.\n\n17.2. We use “session cookies”, which are only stored for the duration of the current visit to our online presence (e.g. to enable the storage of your login status or the shopping cart function and thus the use of our online offering at all). A randomly generated unique identification number, a so-called session ID, is stored in a session cookie. A cookie also contains information about its origin and the storage period. These cookies cannot store any other data. Session cookies are deleted when you have finished using our online offering and, for example, log out or close the browser.\n\n17.3. Users will be informed about the use of cookies as part of pseudonymous reach measurement in the context of this data protection declaration.\n\n17.4. If users do not want cookies to be stored on their computer, they are asked to deactivate the corresponding option in the system settings of their browser. Saved cookies can be deleted in the browser's system settings. The exclusion of cookies can lead to functional restrictions of this online offer.\n\n17.5. You can object to the use of cookies that are used to measure reach and for advertising purposes via the deactivation page of the Network Advertising Initiative (optout.networkadvertising.org) and also the US website (aboutads.info) or the European website (youronlinechoices.com).\n\n18.Google Analytics\n\n18.1. Based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offering within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. GDPR), we use Google Analytics, a web analysis service from Google LLC (“Google”). Google uses cookies. The information generated by the cookie about users' use of the online offering is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.\n\n18.2. Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thereby offers a guarantee that it will comply with European data protection law (privacyshield.gov).\n\n18.3. Google will use this information on our behalf to evaluate the use of our online offering by users, to compile reports on the activities within this online offering and to provide us with other services related to the use of this online offering and internet usage. Pseudonymous user profiles can be created from the processed data.\n\n18.4. We use Google Analytics to show the advertisements placed within the advertising services of Google and its partners only to those users who have also shown an interest in our online offering or who have certain characteristics (e.g. interests in certain topics or products) based on the information they visit websites) that we transmit to Google (so-called “remarketing” or “Google Analytics audiences”). With the help of remarketing audiences, we also want to ensure that our ads match the potential interest of users and do not appear annoying.\n\n18.5. We only use Google Analytics with IP anonymization activated. This means that the user's IP address is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.\n\n18.6. The IP address transmitted by the user's browser is not merged with other Google data. Users can prevent the storage of cookies by setting their browser software accordingly; Users can also prevent Google from collecting the data generated by the cookie and relating to their use of the online offering and from processing this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: tools.google.com .\n\n18.7. Further information on data usage by Google, settings and objection options can be found on the Google websites: google.com (“Use of data by Google when you use our partners’ websites or apps”), policies.google.com (“Use of data for advertising purposes”) ), adssettings.google.com (“Manage information that Google uses to show you advertising”).\n\n19. Google Re/Marketing Services\n\n19.1. Based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offering within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. GDPR), we use the marketing and remarketing services (“Google Marketing Services” for short ”) of Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA, (“Google”).\n\n19.2. Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thereby offers a guarantee that it will comply with European data protection law (privacyshield.gov).\n\n19.3. The Google marketing services allow us to display advertisements for and on our website in a more targeted manner in order to only show users advertisements that potentially match their interests. For example, if a user is shown ads for products that they were interested in on other websites, this is referred to as “remarketing”. For these purposes, when you visit our and other websites on which Google marketing services are active, Google directly executes a code from Google and so-called (re)marketing tags (invisible graphics or code, also known as “Web “Beacons”) are integrated into the website. With their help, an individual cookie, i.e. a small file, is stored on the user's device (comparable technologies can also be used instead of cookies). The cookies can be set by various domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, invitemedia.com, admeld.com, googlesyndication.com or googleadservices.com. This file records which websites the user has visited, what content they are interested in and which offers they have clicked on, as well as technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting time and other information about the use of the online offer. The user's IP address is also recorded, although we inform Google Analytics that the IP address is shortened within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area and only in exceptional cases Transferred to servers by Google in the USA and shortened there. The IP address is not merged with the user's data within other Google offerings. Google may also combine the information mentioned above with such information from other sources. When the user then visits other websites, ads tailored to their interests can be shown to them.\n\n19.4. User data is processed pseudonymously as part of Google marketing services. This means that Google does not store and process the user's name or email address, for example, but rather processes the relevant cookie-related data within pseudonymous user profiles. This means that from Google's perspective, the advertisements are not managed and displayed for a specifically identified person, but for the cookie holder, regardless of who the cookie holder is. This does not apply if a user has expressly allowed Google to process the data without this pseudonymization. The information collected by Google Marketing Services about users is transmitted to Google and stored on Google's servers in the USA.\n\n19.5. The Google marketing services we use include the online advertising program “Google AdWords”. In the case of Google AdWords, each AdWords customer receives a different “conversion cookie”. Cookies cannot therefore be tracked via the websites of AdWords customers. The information collected using the cookie is used to create conversion statistics for AdWords customers who have opted for conversion tracking. AdWords customers learn the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. However, you will not receive any information that can be used to personally identify users.\n\n19.6. We can integrate third-party advertisements based on the Google marketing service “DoubleClick”. DoubleClick uses cookies that enable Google and its partner websites to serve ads based on users' visits to this website or other websites on the Internet.\n\n19.7. We can integrate third-party advertisements based on the Google marketing service “AdSense”. AdSense uses cookies to enable Google and its partner websites to serve ads based on users' visits to this website or other websites on the Internet.\n\n19.8. We can also use the “Google Optimizer” service. Google Optimizer allows us to use so-called “A/B testing” to understand the impact of various changes to a website (e.g. changes to input fields, design, etc.). Cookies are stored on users’ devices for these testing purposes. Only pseudonymous user data is processed.\n\n19.9. We can also use the “Google Tag Manager” to integrate and manage Google analysis and marketing services into our website.\n\n19.10. Further information on Google's use of data for marketing purposes can be found on the overview page: policies.google.com; Google's data protection declaration is available at policies.google.com.\n\n19.11. If you would like to object to interest-based advertising through Google marketing services, you can use the settings and opt-out options provided by Google: adssettings.google.com.\n\n20. Facebook, Custom Audiences and Facebook Marketing Services\n\n20.1. Within our online offering, due to our legitimate interests in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offering and for these purposes, the so-called “Facebook pixel” from the social network Facebook, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025 , USA, or if you are based in the EU, Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”) is used.\n\n20.2. Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thereby offers a guarantee that it will comply with European data protection law (privacyshield.gov).\n\n20.3. With the help of the Facebook pixel, Facebook is able to determine the visitors to our online offering as a target group for the display of advertisements (so-called “Facebook ads”). Accordingly, we use the Facebook pixel to only show the Facebook ads we place to those Facebook users who have shown an interest in our online offering or who have certain characteristics (e.g. interests in certain topics or products) based on the information they visit websites) that we transmit to Facebook (so-called “Custom Audiences”). With the help of the Facebook pixel, we also want to ensure that our Facebook ads correspond to the potential interest of the users and do not appear annoying. With the help of the Facebook pixel, we can also understand the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes by seeing whether users were redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook advertisement (so-called “conversion”).\n\n20.4. Des Weiteren nutzen wir beim Einsatz des Facebook-Pixels die Zusatzfunktion „erweiterter Abgleich“ (hierbei werden Daten wie Telefonnummern, E-Mailadressen oder Facebook-IDs der Nutzer) zur Bildung von Zielgruppen („Custom Audiences“ oder „Look Alike Audiences“) an Facebook (verschlüsselt) übermittelt. Weitere Hinweise zum „erweiterten Abgleich“: facebook.com).\n\n20.5. We also use the “Custom Audiences from File” process from the social network Facebook, Inc. In this case, the email addresses of the newsletter recipients are uploaded to Facebook. The upload process is encrypted. The upload is used solely to determine recipients of our Facebook ads. We want to ensure that the ads are only shown to users who are interested in our information and services.\n\n20.6. The processing of data by Facebook takes place within the framework of Facebook's data usage policy. Accordingly, general information on the display of Facebook ads can be found in Facebook's data usage policy: facebook.com. You can find specific information and details about the Facebook pixel and how it works in the Facebook help section: facebook.com.\n\n20.7. You can object to the collection by the Facebook pixel and the use of your data to display Facebook ads. To set which types of advertisements are shown to you within Facebook, you can go to the page set up by Facebook and follow the instructions there on the settings for usage-based advertising: facebook.com. The settings are platform-independent, i.e. they are applied to all devices, such as desktop computers or mobile devices.\n\n20.8. You can also object to the use of cookies that are used to measure reach and for advertising purposes via the deactivation page of the Network Advertising Initiative (optout.networkadvertising.org) and also the US website (aboutads.info) or the European website (youronlinechoices.com).\n\n21. Facebook Social Plugins\n\n21.1. Based on our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our online offering within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f. GDPR), we use social plugins (“plugins”) from the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland (“Facebook”). The plugins can display interaction elements or content (e.g. videos, graphics or text posts) and can be recognized by one of the Facebook logos (white “f” on a blue tile, the terms “Like”, “Like” or a “thumbs up” sign ) or are marked with the addition “Facebook Social Plugin”. The list and appearance of the Facebook social plugins can be viewed here: developers.facebook.com.\n\n21.2. Facebook is certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement and thereby offers a guarantee that it will comply with European data protection law (privacyshield.gov).\n\n21.3. When a user accesses a function of this online offering that contains such a plugin, their device establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted by Facebook directly to the user's device and integrated into the online offering. User usage profiles can be created from the processed data. We therefore have no influence on the amount of data that Facebook collects with the help of this plugin and therefore inform users according to our level of knowledge.\n\n21.4. By integrating the plugins, Facebook receives the information that a user has accessed the corresponding page of the online offering. If the user is logged in to Facebook, Facebook can assign the visit to their Facebook account. When users interact with the plugins, for example by clicking the Like button or leaving a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted from your device directly to Facebook and stored there. If a user is not a member of Facebook, there is still the possibility that Facebook will find out and store their IP address. According to Facebook, only an anonymized IP address is stored in Germany.\n\n21.5. The purpose and scope of data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook as well as the related rights and setting options to protect the privacy of users can be found in Facebook's data protection information: facebook.com.\n\n21.6. Wenn ein Nutzer Facebookmitglied ist und nicht möchte, dass Facebook über dieses Onlineangebot Daten über ihn sammelt und mit seinen bei Facebook gespeicherten Mitgliedsdaten verknüpft, muss er sich vor der Nutzung unseres Onlineangebotes bei Facebook ausloggen und seine Cookies löschen. Weitere Einstellungen und Widersprüche zur Nutzung von Daten für Werbezwecke, sind innerhalb der Facebook-Profileinstellungen möglich: facebook.com oder über die US-amerikanische Seite aboutads.info oder die EU-Seite youronlinechoices.com. Die Einstellungen erfolgen plattformunabhängig, d.h. sie werden für alle Geräte, wie Desktopcomputer oder mobile Geräte übernommen.\n\n22. Jetpack (WordPress Stats)\n\n22.1. Wir nutzen auf Grundlage unserer berechtigten Interessen (d.h. Interesse an der Analyse, Optimierung und wirtschaftlichem Betrieb unseres Onlineangebotes im Sinne des Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f. DSGVO) das Plugin Jetpack (hier die Unterfunktion „Wordpress Stats“), welches ein Tool zur statistischen Auswertung der Besucherzugriffe einbindet und von Automattic, Inc. 132 Hawthorne Street San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. Jetpack verwendet sog. „Cookies“, Textdateien, die auf Ihrem Computer gespeichert werden und die eine Analyse der Benutzung der Website durch Sie ermöglichen.\n\n22.2.

With the following information we inform you about the contents of our newsletter as well as the registration, shipping and statistical evaluation procedures as well as your rights to object. By subscribing to our newsletter, you agree to its receipt and the procedures described.\n\n23.2. Content of the newsletter: We only send newsletters, emails and other electronic notifications with promotional information (hereinafter “newsletter”) with the consent of the recipient or legal permission. If the contents are specifically described when registering for the newsletter, they are decisive for the user's consent. Our newsletters also contain information about our products, offers, promotions and our company.\n\n23.3. Double opt-in and logging: Registration for our newsletter takes place using a so-called double opt-in procedure. This means that after registering you will receive an email asking you to confirm your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can log in with someone else's email address. Registrations for the newsletter are logged in order to be able to provide evidence of the registration process in accordance with legal requirements. This includes storing the registration and confirmation times as well as the IP address. Changes to your data stored by the shipping service provider are also logged.\n\n23.4. Shipping service provider: The newsletter is sent by CleverReach GmbH & Co. KG, Mühlenstr. 43, 26180 Rastede, hereinafter referred to as “shipping service provider”. You can view the shipping service provider’s privacy policy here: cleverreach.com.\n\n23.5. Furthermore, the shipping service provider can, according to its own information, use this data in pseudonymous form, i.e. without assigning it to a user, to optimize or improve its own services, e.g. to technically optimize the dispatch and presentation of the newsletter or for statistical purposes in order to determine which countries the recipients come from. However, the shipping service provider does not use the data of our newsletter recipients to write to them themselves or to pass them on to third parties.\n\n23.6. Registration data: To register for the newsletter, it is sufficient to provide your email address. Optionally, we ask you to provide a name so that you can be addressed personally in the newsletter.\n\n23.7. Success measurement – The newsletters contain a so-called “web beacon”, i.e. a pixel-sized file that is retrieved from the shipping service provider’s server when the newsletter is opened. As part of this retrieval, technical information is initially collected, such as information about the browser and your system, as well as your IP address and the time of retrieval. This information is used to technically improve the services based on the technical data or the target groups and their reading behavior based on their access locations (which can be determined using the IP address) or access times. The statistical surveys also include determining whether the newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our intention nor that of the shipping service provider to monitor individual users. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.\n\n23.8. The sending of the newsletter and the measurement of success are based on the consent of the recipient in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter a, Article 7 GDPR in conjunction with Section 107 Paragraph 2 TKG or on the basis of legal permission in accordance with Section 107 Paragraph. 2 and 3 TKG.\n\n23.9. The registration process is logged on the basis of our legitimate interests in accordance with Article 6 Paragraph 1 Letter f of the GDPR and serves to provide proof of consent to receive the newsletter.\n\n10/23 Cancellation/revocation – You can cancel your receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e. revoke your consent. You will find a link to unsubscribe from the newsletter at the end of each newsletter. If users have only registered for the newsletter and canceled this registration, their personal data will be deleted.\n\n24. Integration of third-party services and content\n\n24.1.

GDPR) in order to improve their content and To integrate services such as videos or fonts (hereinafter referred to as “content”). This always assumes that the third party providers of this content are aware of the user's IP address, as without the IP address they would not be able to send the content to their browser. The IP address is therefore required to display this content. We strive to only use content whose respective providers only use the IP address to deliver the content. Third parties may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as “web beacons”) for statistical or marketing purposes. The “pixel tags” can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website.
