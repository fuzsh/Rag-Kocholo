        "text": "Harnessing existing data - for urban development that empowers local people to make their living spaces sustainable, attractive and productive. To realise this vision, the bottom-up.city team founded this start-up. Through geosocial ecosystem analysis, they combine social media data with geospatial data to be able to provide sound advice on location decisions. To do this, they use bottom-up data that emerges as a product of everyday documentation in digital space. Through qualitative content depth with quantitative sample sizes, they offer insight into trends and topics.\n\nAwards:"
