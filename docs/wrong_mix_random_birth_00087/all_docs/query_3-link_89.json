        "text": "Henry County Water Authority (HCWA) board members, employees, and retirees are mourning the loss of District 3 Board Member Jimmy Carter, 77, who passed away on Wednesday (Feb. 21). Carter had served on the Authority Board since 2005, including 11 years as Chairman.\n\nIn addition to serving his community on the HCWA Board, Carter spent 18 years as an elected member of the Henry County Board of Education. He also was a veteran of the U.S. Army.\n\n“We have lost a true public servant who spent his life serving the people of this community in various capacities and who was not self-serving in any way,” says Warren Holder, HCWA Chairman, who enjoyed eight years on the Water Authority Board with Carter in addition to four years with him on the Henry County School Board. “We grew up together and went to high school together. He spent many hours away from his family in public service, but when he saw a need he was willing to fill it, and we all benefitted as a result. He loved his family and was a strong man of faith. He’s going to be sorely missed.”\n\nCarter was a native of Henry County and sixth generation resident, perhaps best known as owner and operator of Southern Belle Farm, an agribusiness and popular tourist destination located on his family’s farm in McDonough. Carter said prior to its opening that he envisioned Southern Belle Farm would include an educational component as a part of the state-of-the-art agricultural facility on his family’s farm – a dream he brought to fruition that still thrives today.\n\nIn addition to founding Southern Belle Farm, Carter was a third-generation dairy farmer in Henry County. Beginning in 1974, following his graduation from the University of Georgia and tour in the Army, Carter owned and operated his family’s dairy for more than 12 years. After closing those operations in 1986, Carter began working in sales in the agricultural industry. He was an independent sales representative for ABS Global, Inc. and Four Seasons Marketing Group, in addition to serving as Executive Director of the Georgia Milk Producers, Inc.\n\nDuring his tenure on the HCWA Board, the Authority experienced several improvements and expansions to the water and sewer systems and respective facilities, as well as many industry awards. Some of those highlights have included:\n\n* Legislation to rename the Henry County Water & Sewerage Authority to the Henry County Water Authority\n\n* Opening of the Tussahaw Reservoir and Water Treatment Plant\n\n* Opening of the Tussahaw Reservoir Public Use Area\n\n* Renovation of the Towaliga Water Treatment Plant\n\n* Expansion of the Bear Creek, Indian Creek, and Walnut Creek Water Reclamation Facilities\n\n* Opening of the Engineering Building at the HCWA Headquarters Campus\n\n* Construction of the Northeast Elevated Water Tank\n\n* Construction of the South Ola Elevated Water Tank\n\nAmong the many industry awards the HCWA received during Mr. Carter’s tenure include:\n\n* Water Distribution System of the Year in Georgia on multiple occasions\n\n* Wastewater Collection System of the Year in Georgia on multiple occasions\n\n* Water Treatment Plant of the Year in Georgia for the Towaliga and Tussahaw Water Treatment Plants on multiple occasions\n\n* Wastewater Treatment Plant of the Year in Georgia for the Bear Creek, Walnut Creek, and Indian Creek Water Reclamation Facilities on multiple occasions\n\n* Chamber of Commerce Business of the Year in 2016\n\nRetired HCWA General Manager Lindy Farmer worked 16 years alongside Carter, including 10 when Carter was Chairman of HCWA Board.\n\n“What a loss for Henry County. Mr. Carter was a stellar individual. When you look up the definition of public servant, you’ll see Jimmy Carter,” says Farmer, who described his friend and colleague as a great leader and great Chairman of the HCWA. “He never said a negative word about anyone, and he eagerly shared his faith with others,” recalls Farmer, who remembers Carter giving his testimony at a Chamber of Commerce retreat upon receiving the Public Servant of the Year Award. “He meant so much to the county, and he was very special to me.”\n\n“Mr. Carter was a joy to work with, and he is going to be sorely missed,” says Tony Carnell, HCWA General Manager, who worked directly with Carter when he was Chairman last year, setting the agenda for the Board to address issues and policies for the Authority. “He was a firm believer in the General Manager and staff handling the day-to-day operation of the Authority, while the Board provides support. And Mr. Carter and our Board have done just that – provided us with what we need to operate a first-class water utility today and in the future.”\n\nCarnell notes that while Mr. Carter and his fellow HCWA Board Members provided unwavering support for him and his staff, they also asked for the best out of employees.\n\n“Mr. Carter was instrumental in demanding professionalism, which he emphasized by spearheading policies such as improved performance evaluations and succession planning,” notes Carnell. “He was always thinking of the future and how we could get better.”\n\nCarnell recalls countless discussions and the exchange of ideas with Carter, admiring his dedication to the Authority and Henry County, especially in times of crises, such as the artic freeze that hit the area on Christmas Eve in 2022 or the severe storms that impacted the system last spring.\n\n“Everything Mr. Carter did or recommended had the best interests of the Water Authority at heart,” recalls Carnell. “He was one of our most avid supporters, always showing his appreciation for the work employees did. I’m really going to miss our conversations, not just about business, but about life.”\n\nAmong the many elected officials, community leaders, friends and contemporaries of Carter who have expressed condolences is Henry County Commission Chair Carlotta Harrell, who served on the HCWA Board with Carter prior to her election as County Commission Chair.\n\n“Mr. Carter was a pillar in our community and was a servant leader who was committed to his family and Henry County,” says Harrell. “I’m heartbroken. He was my friend, and I will truly miss his presence.”\n\nCarter graduated from Henry County High School, prior to receiving his bachelor’s degree in agriculture and master’s degree in animal nutrition from the University of Georgia. Carter lived in McDonough with his wife Kathy his entire adult life. They have three children – Holly, Carmen, and Jake – nine grandchildren, and one great granddaughter, who all live on the family farm in McDonough and have worked in the family business at Southern Belle.\n\n“What I appreciated most about my father was his faith, and he shared that with everyone. It was the cornerstone of his life,” says Holly Carter Cobb, Carter’s oldest daughter and current Member of the Henry County Board of Education. “He loved his family and enjoyed every moment he could get with us. And he was passionate about giving back to the community, which was something he definitely passed down, so we want to continue to carry on his legacy.”\n\nCaptions for photos (second from top to bottom):\n\nFormer HCWA Chairman Jimmy Carter (far left) pictured with fellow board members during a tour of the construction at the Walnut Creek Water Reclamation Facility last year.\n\nHCWA District 3 Board Member Jimmy Carter (right), with his wife Kathy (center) and oldest daughter Holly Carter Cobb, Member of the Henry County Board of Education, at the retirement luncheon for former HCWA General Manager Lindy Farmer.\n\nHCWA District 3 Board Member Jimmy Carter (far left), accompanied by HCWA Chairman Warren Holder (far right), congratulates former HCWA Clerk Kim Osborne (center) upon her retirement last year.\n\nFormer HCWA Chairman Jimmy Carter (left) congratulates former HCWA General Manager Lindy Farmer (right) on his retirement following 40 years of leading the Authority.\n\n#\n\nMedia Contact: Chris Wood, Ph.D.\n\nP: 770-757-1681\n\nE: chris@jwapr.com or john.wood@gcsu.edu"
