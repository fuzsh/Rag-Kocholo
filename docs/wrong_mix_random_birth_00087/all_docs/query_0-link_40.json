        "text": "Dec. 19, 2009\n\nGaza Must Be Rebuilt Now\n\nThis op-ed by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was published Dec. 19, 2009, by The Guardian.\n\nIt is generally recognised that the Middle East peace process is in the doldrums, almost moribund. Israeli settlement expansion within Palestine continues, and PLO leaders refuse to join in renewed peace talks without a settlement freeze, knowing that no Arab or Islamic nation will accept any comprehensive agreement while Israel retains control of East Jerusalem.\n\nDec. 3, 2009\n\nSpeech by Jimmy Carter to the Parliament of the World's Religions\n\nDelivered via remote video from Atlanta, Ga., as part of The Elders project.\n\nFirst, I want to thank Executive Director Dirk Ficca for making it possible for me to join you, even though remotely.

Washington refuses to engage a right-wing Palestinian group – and so spawns organizations that are even more extreme.\n\nSept. 21, 2009\n\nAddress by Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter: Mahatma Gandhi Global Nonviolence Award\n\nFormer U.S. President Jimmy Carter and former First Lady Rosalynn Carter were named recipients of the 2009 Mahatma Gandhi Global Nonviolence Award in recognition of the couple's humanitarian efforts worldwide.

Thirty years ago this nation began a new wave of democracy in the region while I was President of the United States, and my wife Rosalynn attended the inauguration of your new president.

The advancement of human rights around the world was a cornerstone of foreign policy and U.S. leadership for decades, until the attacks on our country on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nDec. 2, 2008\n\nRespond to Zimbabwe Crisis\n\nThis op-ed was published in the Dec. 2, 2008 edition of the Atlanta Journal Constitution.\n\nAs president, I worked actively with African leaders and the British to change the apartheid regime of Rhodesia into a democratic Zimbabwe in 1980. Eight years later, The Carter Center established one of our first agriculture projects in Zimbabwe, at that time known as a breadbasket for the region and setting an example in economic stability, education and health care.\n\nDec. 2, 2008\n\nCommentary: U.S. Must Lead World on Human Rights\n\nThis op-ed by Jimmy Carter was published on CNN.com on Dec. 2, 2008.\n\nIt has been heartening to witness the outpouring of worldwide enthusiasm over the election of Barack Obama as the next president of the United States, a transformational moment for our country.\n\nSept. 19, 2008\n\nMental Health Legislation We Need\n\nThis letter was originally published in the Washington Post.\n\nThe Sept. 8 news story \"Kennedy Plans a January Return,\" regarding Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), mentioned an effort to pass legislation granting parity in insurance coverage for those suffering from mental illnesses.\n\nSept. 11, 2008\n\nOp-ed by Jimmy Carter: India Nuclear Deal Puts World at Risk\n\nThis op-ed was published in the Sept. 11, 2008 edition of the International Herald Tribune.\n\nKnowing since 1974 of India's nuclear ambitions, other American presidents and I have maintained a consistent global policy: no sales of nuclear technology or uncontrolled fuel to any country that refuses to sign the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty, or NPT. To imbed this concept as official national policy, I worked closely with bipartisan leaders in the U.S. Congress to pass the Non-Proliferation Act of 1978.\n\nJuly 10, 2008\n\nA Leap in Mental Care for Children\n\nThis op-ed by Rosalynn Carter was published in the July 10, 2008 edition of the Boston Globe. In the 31 years since I chaired the first presidential commission on mental health, medical science has made significant strides in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of mental illnesses. Living in recovery from a mental illness is now not only possible, but expected. Even children and adolescents diagnosed with mental disorders go on to lead healthy, productive lives.\n\nMay 8, 2008\n\nA Human Rights Crime in Gaza\n\nThis column by Jimmy Carter was distributed for publication by Project Syndicate.\n\nThe world is witnessing a terrible human rights crime in Gaza, where a million and a half human beings are being imprisoned with almost no access to the outside world by sea, air or land. An entire population is being brutally punished.\n\nApril 28, 2008\n\nPariah Diplomacy\n\nColumn by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, published in the April 28, 2008, edition of The New York Times.\n\nA counterproductive Washington policy in recent years has been to boycott and punish political factions or governments that refuse to accept United States mandates. This policy makes difficult the possibility that such leaders might moderate their policies.\n\nMarch 31, 2008\n\nA Village Woman's Legacy (PDF)\n\nThis article was published in the Mar. 31, 2008 edition of TIME magazine.\n\nAn encounter with the victim of an old scourge gave a former President a new worldview—and a mission.\n\nMarch 27, 2008\n\nRemarks by Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter: 2008 Skoll World Forum\n\nVideotaped remarks delivered by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter during the Skoll Awards Ceremony, held during the 2008 Skoll World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship at the University of Oxford's Saïd Business School .\n\nFeb. 3, 2008\n\nA Clearer Picture on Voter ID\n\nThis Jimmy Carter and James Baker III op-ed was published in the Feb. 3, 2008, edition of The New York Times.\n\nThis is a major election year.

Public health is the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting physical and mental health. What we are beginning to see is that success in any one of these areas raises new challenges and presents new problems for us to solve in the other areas.\n\nDec. 10, 2007\n\nSubsidies' Harvest Of Misery: Jimmy Carter Washington Post Op-Ed\n\nCongress can still act decisively this year to right a wrong that is hurting both small American farmers and the poorest people on the planet. A long-overdue debate is taking place on reform of the 1933 farm bill, passed during the Great Depression to alleviate the suffering of America's family farmers.\n\nDec. 10, 2007\n\nVenezuela Reins in, Doesn't Reject, Hugo Chávez\n\nThis Jennifer McCoy op-ed was published in the Dec. 10, 2007, edition of Newsday.\n\nVoters in Venezuela have sent a clear message to their president: Slow down.\n\nDec. 7, 2007\n\nJimmy Carter: Rule of Law and Social Harmony in China\n\nSpeech by Jimmy Carter to the China University of Political Science and Law.\n\nThank you for your introduction, Professor Zhu Yong.

Borlaug op-ed was published in the October 26, 2007, edition of The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe so-called Green Revolution of Asia, which began in the 1960s and continued through the 1980s, spurred the greatest expansion of food production in world history. Global wheat and rice production doubled, and continued to grow.\n\nSept. 26, 2007\n\nJimmy Carter Receives First Albert Schweitzer Humanitarian Award\n\nThis lecture was delivered by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter during the awards ceremony at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn.

This is a crisis that The Carter Center faces every day in fighting malaria, lymphatic filariasis, Guinea worm, trachoma, river blindness, and schistosomiasis.\n\nJuly 18, 2007\n\nRosalynn Carter and Betty Ford Op-ed: Pass the Wellstone Act; Mental-health Parity Needed\n\nThis op-ed was published in the July 18, 2007, edition of The Washington Times.\n\nIf you were diagnosed with a brain tumor, would you seek treatment or would you ignore it and hope it goes away? Would your answer differ according to whether your health insurance covered treatment? A diagnosis such as a brain tumor, or Parkinson's disease, is a serious matter. Just as serious are the diagnoses of mental illnesses and addictions. But depending on the location of the illness in your body, the decision to seek treatment may be harder to make.\n\nJuly 18, 2007\n\nContinuing the Green Revolution: Wall Street Journal Op-Ed\n\nEarly crossbreeding experiments to select desirable characteristics took years to reach the desired developmental state of a plant or animal. Today, with the tools of biotechnology, such as molecular and marker-assisted selection, the ends are reached in a more organized and accelerated way. The result has been the advent of a \"Gene\" Revolution that stands to equal, if not exceed, the Green Revolution of the 20th century.\n\nJuly 10, 2007\n\nRosalynn Carter's Testimony: Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Education Equity Act, House Education and Labor Committee, Subcommittee on Health\n\nMr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to speak to you regarding legislation that will profoundly impact the lives of so many Americans.\n\nJune 21, 2007\n\nPeace with Justice in the Middle East\n\nRemarks by Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter Center at the Mansfield College, Oxford, \"Hands Lecture\" on June 21, 2007.\n\nJune 19, 2007\n\nHuman Rights Speech\n\nRemarks by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, delivered June 19, 2007, in Dublin, Ireland.\n\nApril 12, 2007\n\nMental Health System Needs Legislature's Boost\n\nA Hidden Shame, the continuing series in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution is chronicling inhumane neglect, abuse and death in Georgia's state mental hospitals. Unfortunately, these very real problems in the state hospital system are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nApril 06, 2007\n\nA Viable Mideast Peace Plan\n\nThis letter, written by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, was published in the April 6, 2007, issue of the International Herald-Tribune.\n\nJan. 23, 2007\n\nRemarks by Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter at Brandeis University\n\nThis is a transcript of remarks delivered by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter at Brandeis University, Waltham, Mass., on Jan. 23, 2007.\n\nJan. 18, 2007\n\nA New Chance for Peace?\n\nWashington Post op-ed.\n\nI am concerned that public discussion of my book \"Palestine Peace Not Apartheid\" has been diverted from the book's basic proposals: that peace talks be resumed after six years of delay and that the tragic persecution of Palestinians be ended.\n\nJan. 10, 2007\n\nJimmy Carter: Let's Bridge the Rich-Poor Gap\n\nFrom MSNBC. Essay originally published in \"Grand Challenges for Engineering,\" section, National Academy of Engineering Web site.\n\nJan. 3,2007\n\nRemarks of Former President Jimmy Carter During Funeral Service for Gerald R. Ford\n\nTranscript of President Carter's remarks, delivered at Grace Episcopal Church, Grand Rapids, Mich.\n\nDec. 8, 2006\n\nHow I See Palestine\n\nThis op-ed by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter was published in the Dec. 8, 2006, issue of the Los Angeles Times.\n\nI signed a contract with Simon & Schuster two years ago to write a book about the Middle East, based on my personal observations as the Carter Center monitored three elections in Palestine and on my consultations with Israeli political leaders and peace activists.\n\nOct. 11, 2006\n\nSolving the Korean Stalemate, One Step at a Time: New York Times Op-Ed\n\nIn 1994 the North Koreans expelled inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency and were threatening to process spent nuclear fuel into plutonium, giving them the ability to produce nuclear weapons.\n\nSept. 7, 2006\n\nKeep Close Tabs on Congo; U.N. Force Can Advance Cause of Democracy (PDF)\n\nThis John Stremlau op-ed was published in the Sept. 7, 2006, edition of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nSatisfaction among Carter Center staff and other observers of the Democratic Republic of Congo's surprisingly successful July 30 elections soured when results were released and rival armies loyal to the two leading presidential candidates clashed, killing 23. Such lawlessness risks derailing the most challenging, comprehensive, complex and costly United Nations intervention ever attempted to support a democratic transition.\n\nAug. 1, 2006\n\nWashington Post Op-ed on Middle East by Jimmy Carter\n\nThe Middle East is a tinderbox, with some key players on all sides waiting for every opportunity to destroy their enemies with bullets, bombs and missiles. One of the special vulnerabilities of Israel, and a repetitive cause of violence, is the holding of prisoners. Militant Palestinians and Lebanese know that a captured Israeli soldier or civilian is either a cause of conflict or a valuable bargaining chip for prisoner exchange. This assumption is based on a number of such trades, including 1,150 Arabs, mostly Palestinians, for three Israeli soldiers in 1985; 123 Lebanese for the remains of two Israeli soldiers in 1996; and 433 Palestinians and others for an Israeli businessman and the bodies of three soldiers in 2004.\n\nJuly 3, 2006\n\nWe Need Fewer Secrets: Jimmy Carter Washington Post Op-ed\n\nThe U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) turns 40 tomorrow, the day we celebrate our independence. But this anniversary will not be a day of celebration for the right to information in our country. Our government leaders have become increasingly obsessed with secrecy. Obstructionist policies and deficient practices have ensured that many important public documents and official actions remain hidden from our view. En español: En la democracia no se puede gobernar en secreto\n\nMay 25, 2006\n\nRosalynn Carter Op-ed: Erasing Stigma Key to Mental Treatment\n\nThis op-ed was published in the May 26, 2006, edition of the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News.\n\nMay 23, 2006\n\nOpening Remarks by Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to the 2006 Human Rights Defenders Policy Forum\n\nPresident Carter's opening address to the human rights policy forum.\n\nMay 22, 2006\n\nEqual Time: Health Bill Plays Russian Roulette, Thom Bornemann Op-ed\n\nForty million Americans do not have health coverage. Some analysts are quick to suggest that \"basic health coverage\" is the answer. That prescription, however, risks spreading a \"virus\" that now infects most commercial health coverage in this country and lurks in the fine print of most employer-provided health plans: singling out mental health care for rigid coverage limits.\n\nMay 21, 2006\n\nJimmy Carter Op-ed: Employers in Quandary over Immigration Bill\n\nThis op-ed was published in the May 21, 2006, edition of The Miami Herald. It was also published in The San Jose Mercury News and The Philadelphia Inquirer.\n\nMay 16, 2006\n\nJimmy Carter Writes on Middle East for USA Today\n\nThis op-ed was published in the May 16, 2006, issue of USA Today.\n\nMay 7, 2006\n\nJimmy Carter: Punishing Innocent Palestinians is a Crime\n\nThis article was published in the May 7, 2006, issue of the International Herald Tribune. Innocent Palestinian people are being treated like animals, with the presumption that they are guilty of some crime. Because they voted for candidates who are members of Hamas, the United States government has become the driving force behind an apparently effective scheme of depriving the general public of income, access to the outside world and the necessities of life.\n\nMarch 29, 2006\n\nWashington Post Op-ed by Jimmy Carter: A Dangerous Deal with India\n\nDuring the past five years the United States has abandoned many of the nuclear arms control agreements negotiated since the administration of Dwight Eisenhower. This change in policies has sent uncertain signals to other countries, including North Korea and Iran, and may encourage technologically capable nations to choose the nuclear option. The proposed nuclear deal with India is just one more step in opening a Pandora's box of nuclear proliferation.\n\nMarch 13, 2006\n\nJimmy Carter Op-ed: Colonization of Palestine Precludes Peace\n\nFor more than a quarter century, Israeli policy has been in conflict with that of the United States and the international community. Israel's occupation of Palestine has obstructed a comprehensive peace agreement in the Holy Land, regardless of whether Palestinians had no formalised government, one headed by Yasser Arafat or Mahmoud Abbas, or with Abbas as president and Hamas controlling the parliament and cabinet.\n\nMarch 5, 2006\n\nNew York Times Op-ed: Principles Defeat Politics at the U.N.\n\nIn the global struggle for the advancement of human rights, the United Nations has reached a defining moment. The president of the General Assembly, Jan Eliasson of Sweden, has led five months of negotiations to develop a proposal to reform the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.\n\nMarch 2, 2006\n\nJimmy Carter on Middle East Peace: Council on Foreign Relations Speech Calls for Renewed Commitment to Justice for Palestinians, Israelis\n\nThis speech was delivered by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter on March 2, 2006, to the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nFeb. 20, 2006\n\nJimmy Carter Washington Post Op-ed: Don't Punish the Palestinians\n\nAs the results of the recent Palestinian elections are implemented, it's important to understand how the transition process works and also how important to it are actions by Israel and the United States.\n\nFeb. 10, 2006\n\nRemarks by Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter at the Coretta Scott King Funeral\n\nThese remarks were made by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter during the funeral service for Coretta Scott King, held Feb. 7, 2006, at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Lithonia, Ga.\n\nJan. 23, 2006\n\nRemarks on Middle East Peace By Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter\n\nDelivered on Jan. 23, 2006, at the Herzliya Conference, Israel\n\nJan. 16, 2006\n\nSan Francisco Chronicle Op-ed: Human Rights Commission Must Change\n\nNegotiations are now under way to reform the United Nations' principal human-rights body. The Commission on Human Rights was established 60 years ago next month as the United Nations' main vehicle for exposing human-rights problems throughout the world. The commission has accomplished a great deal by setting standards for measuring human-rights practices of governments, but the body lately has become a target of ridicule, some of it justified.\n\nArchives"
