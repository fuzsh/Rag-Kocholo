        "text": "This is a partial list of recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, listed chronologically within the aspect of life in which each recipient is or was renowned.\n\nThe Presidential Medal of Freedom is awarded by the president of the United States to “any person recommended to the President for award of the Medal or any person selected by the President upon his own initiative.\"[1] Before 1970, honorees were either selected by the president or recommended to them by the Distinguished Civilian Service Awards Board.[2]\n\nTypically the medal is bestowed upon the recipient by the sitting president who has chosen them. However, the first recipients selected by President John F. Kennedy before his assassination were formally awarded by his successor in office, Lyndon B. Johnson.[3]\n\nPresident Barack Obama awarded 118 medals, the most of any president, followed by President Bill Clinton with 89 medal recipients.[4] Two people, Ellsworth Bunker and Colin Powell, are two-time recipients of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Colin Powell received his second award with Distinction,[5] while Ellsworth Bunker was given both of his awards with Distinction.\n\nEight Presidents have themselves received the medal either posthumously, post-presidency, or prior to being elected:\n\nJohn F. Kennedy (1963, posthumously)\n\nLyndon B. Johnson (1980, posthumously)\n\nRonald Reagan (1993, with Distinction)\n\nGerald Ford (1999)\n\nJimmy Carter (1999)\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush (2011)\n\nBill Clinton (2013)\n\nJoe Biden (2017, as Vice President; also awarded with Distinction)\n\nIn 2015, President Barack Obama stated that there was no precedent to revoke a Presidential Medal of Freedom, regarding the award given to stand-up comedian and actor Bill Cosby.[6] After being awarded the medal, Cosby was convicted of multiple counts of sexual assault, though the convictions were later overturned.[7]\n\nThe Presidential Medal of Freedom is related to, but distinct from, the Medal of Freedom, an earlier award issued between 1945 and 1963 to honor US civilian contributions to World War II.\n\nAt the age of 25, athlete and activist Simone Biles is the youngest person to receive this award as of 2022.[8]\n\nBill Belichick, coach of the New England Patriots, was offered the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Donald Trump, and initially accepted it, but changed his mind and turned down the medal after the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[9]\n\nCountry musician Dolly Parton turned down the medal twice. Parton said she turned it down the first time because her husband was ill, and the second time because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[10]\n\n† – Awarded posthumously\n\nWD – Awarded \"with Distinction\"\n\nJohn F. Kennedy selected 31 recipients to be awarded in 1963. After his assassination they were officially awarded by Lyndon B.
