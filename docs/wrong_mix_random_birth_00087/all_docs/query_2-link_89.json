(Note that they don’t seem to spend much time in all-blue Jersey.)\n\nBut only twice in the last 50 years has Pennsylvania been center-stage in presidential primaries. In 1976, Jimmy Carter began his campaign in Philadelphia by apologizing for stating that the federal government should not get involved in trying to change the “ethnic purity” of neighborhoods. Carter survived the controversy and all but secured the Democratic nomination by winning in Pennsylvania, foreshadowing the commonwealth’s role in sending him to the White House.\n\nApril 18, 7:40 a.m. ET\n\nLink copied\n\nMalcolm Kenyatta and Mark Pinsley are running in the Democratic primary for Pa. auditor general.

These primaries will set up November matchups, which could tip the balance of power in both Harrisburg and Washington.\n\n» READ MORE: Your candidate guide to the Pa. primary, from president to state House and Senate races"
