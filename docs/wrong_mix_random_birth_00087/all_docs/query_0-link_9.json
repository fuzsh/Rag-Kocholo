        "text": "From Notes of the Office of the Secretary\n\nArlin M. Adams\n\nImpartial judge, committed citizen-volunteer, inspirational teacher, and the ideal Penn alumnus whom Benjamin Franklin characterized as \"distinguished in abilities, serviceable in public stations, and an ornament to the country.\"\n\nFrom 1969 to 1986, Judge Adams served with distinction on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. He continues to be called upon by Presidents, Governors, legislatures, and courts to handle investigations and disputes of the greatest sensitivity and public importance. He served from 1990 to 1995 as Independent Counsel to investigate influence peddling in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 1995 he was named permanent trustee in the New Era Foundation bankruptcy.\n\nJudge Adams received his undergraduate degree from Temple University in 1941 and his law degree from PennLaw in 1947, after naval service in the North Pacific from 1942 to 1945. After graduation he joined the Philadelphia firm of Schnader Harrison Segal & Lewis. On retiring from the bench in 1986, he rejoined the firm, where he is currently of counsel.\n\nHe is a past chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar Association, former president of the American Judicature Society, and served with distinction as chairman of the Commission for Supreme Court Fellows. He served as Secretary of Public Welfare for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from 1963-1966. He has also served as trustee of Bryn Mawr College, the Medical College of Pennsylvania, the German Marshall Trust, and the William Penn Foundation; chairman of the Board of Trustees of Albert Einstein Medical Center, Moss Rehabilitation Hospital, and the Fels Institute of State and Local Government; and chairman of the Advisory Board of the Bryn Mawr College School of Social Work. In 1993, he was elected president of the American Philosophical Society.\n\nAn emeritus trustee of the University, Judge Adams has served as chairman of Penn's Law School Overseers, an adjunct member of the School's faculty, and a member of the Board of Advisors of the Center for Law and Economics, as well as a member of the Trustees' Academic, Honorary Degrees and University Responsibility committees. He also served on the Board of Advisors for the School of Social Work and the Wharton School. Recipient of numerous awards and honors, Judge Adams was awarded the University's Alumni Award of Merit in 1994. Most recently, he received the 1997 ,Philadelphia Award, annually presented to a Philadelphian in recognition of outstanding service to the community.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter\n\nThirty-ninth president of the United States, known as the Great Peace Maker. Whether negotiating a cease-fire in shell-shocked Sarajevo or building houses for the homeless in Appalachia, can be found at the helm of a vast array of humanitarian efforts. Embodies what the American public most admires in its leaders: integrity, honesty, ethics, and an unswerving commitment to making the world a better place.\n\nPresident Carter attended Georgia Southwestern College and the Georgia Institute of Technology and received a B.S. degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1946, followed by graduate work in nuclear physics at Union College. In 1953, on the death of his father, he resigned his commission and returned to Plains, Georgia, to manage the family business with his wife Rosalynn. He became governor of Georgia in 1970 and was elected president in 1976.\n\nAmong many noteworthy accomplishments during his tenure, 1977 to 1981, were the Panama Canal treaties; the Camp David Accords; the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel; the SALT II treaty with the Soviet Union; establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China; major environmental protection legislation; and a comprehensive energy program conducted by a new Department of Energy.\n\nAfter leaving the White House, he and his wife founded The Carter Center in Atlanta Georgia in 1982. The non-partisan, non-profit Center became the institutional base for his continuing role in public life, monitoring democratic elections in Panama, Nicaragua, Haiti, Zambia, and other nations; leading the worldwide effort to eradicate Guinea worm disease which annually cripples more than 2 million Africans yearly; coordinating a multi-agency effort that increased the worldwide immunization rate for children from 20 to 80 percent; reducing famine in Africa by helping farmers increase crop yield fourfold; mediating conflicts in Haiti, North Korea, Bosnia, and the Middle East; and spearheading a grassroots urban revitalization program.\n\nPresident Carter is the author of twelve books, and his hands-on involvement as a volunteer and director for Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit organization that helps build homes for needy families in the U. S. and abroad, has helped bring the organization to national prominence and led thousands to volunteer their services.\n\nRosalynn Carter\n\nCommitted advocate and tireless activist on behalf of those least served who has worked unsparingly to improve the quality of life for people around the world; repudiates the myth of what it is that women do by the force of her powerful example and accomplishments.\n\nMrs. Carter, who graduated from Georgia Southwestern College in 1946, was a key member of Jimmy Carter's campaigns for governor and for the presidency. As First Lady, Mrs. Carter used her role as honorary chair of the President's Commission on Mental Health as a bully pulpit to make mental health a top national priority. Her efforts were instrumental in the passage of the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980. Like Eleanor Roosevelt, Mrs. Carter redefined the role of First Lady: traveling the world as a special presidential envoy and bringing to the ear of the president first-hand accounts of the concerns of the American people.\n\nShe continues to break new ground at The Carter Center as an advocate for mental health, issues of concern to woman and children, human rights, conflict resolution, and the empowerment of urban communities. The annual Rosalynn Carter Symposium on Mental Health Policy brings together leaders of the nation's mental health organizations to address critical issues. In 1991, she co-founded \"Every Child by Two\" to publicize the need for early childhood immunizations, and in 1988, she convened with three other former first ladies the \"Women and the Constitution\" conference.\n\nIn addition to her work at The Carter Center and with Habitat for Humanity, Mrs. Carter has written three book; is currently a distinguished fellow at the Emory University Institute for Women's Studies' and is activewith the Rosalynn Carter Institute of Georgia Southwestern College, whose mission is to help family and professional caregivers.
