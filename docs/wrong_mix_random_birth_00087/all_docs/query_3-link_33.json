        "text": "The Georgia River Network will host the Georgia Rivers Gala at the Atlanta History Center on Aug. 22 to honor river protectors and support the future of river recreation.\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter will receive the River Hero award for his enduring environmental legacy for Georgia’s rivers. Jimmy Carter’s grandson Jason Carter, a former Georgia State Senator, will accept the River Hero award on behalf of his grandfather.\n\n“President Carter came to our Paddle Georgia river adventure event on the Flint River in 2008 to share how he advocated against proposed dams,” said Rena Ann Peck, executive director of Georgia River Network. “He applauded our efforts to help create the Flint Riverkeeper and our continued work to help build 30 other river conservation organizations over the past 26 years.”\n\nThe theme for the second annual Georgia Rivers Gala is “Freedom to Float,” celebrating Georgia rivers across history and raising support for the protection of the freedom to explore Georgia’s rivers and streams.\n\n“For generations my family has explored the Okefenokee Wilderness Canoe Trail. My\n\ngrandfather, my father, me and my children have all paddled the swamp, and slept on\n\ncamping platforms under the stars as gators eyed us from the water,” said Jason Carter. “Just as my grandfather signed into law the Coastal Marshlands Protection Act to save our coast from mining – today our state has an historic opportunity to outlaw mining that would harm the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge and St Marys River. I hope our leaders will do everything they can to protect this incredible, beautiful and irreplaceable natural wonder.”\n\nJoin outdoor recreation enthusiasts, conservationists and leaders from across the state at the Georgia Rivers Gala: Freedom to Float at the Atlanta History Center on August 22 from 6 to 9 p.m. Guests will enjoy a cocktail hour with hors d’oeuvres, a brief program, dinner, and live music by Rob Jordan & Friends."
