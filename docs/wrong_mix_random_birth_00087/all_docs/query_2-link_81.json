        "text": "It began with a long, long plane ride.\n\nFormer presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford were flying back to the U.S. from Egypt in 1981. They had just attended the funeral of Anwar Sadat, Egypt’s president during both their presidencies.\n\nCarter had carefully, intimately mediated a peace treaty between Sadat and Israel’s prime minister in 1978, bonding the two men together until Sadat’s assassination.\n\nHe and Ford, however? They weren’t that close.\n\nThe 1976 general election was a “gentlemanly affair” compared to today’s uncivil campaigns, says Daniel K. Williams, an author and history professor at the University of West Georgia whose deep account of the race was published in 2020.\n\nBut the election was still passionately fought, and Ford “resented” Carter’s routine lumping-in of him with disgraced predecessor Richard Nixon. After losing a tight race, Ford quipped: “I can’t believe I lost to a peanut farmer.”\n\n“It was a blow even though it should not have been a surprise,” Williams said.\n\nAs Ford accepted his loss, the new president extended an olive branch in the first sentence of his inaugural address in January 1977: “For myself and for our nation,” Carter said with Ford sitting near, “I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.”\n\nFrom then on, Carter was able to lean on Ford during his four-year presidency. Ford helped his Democratic successor lobby Republicans on Capitol Hill, and he consulted on the Panama Canal treaties. Ford was even Carter’s first call after he reached the Egypt-Israel peace accord.\n\nA working relationship then turned into friendship on that long plane ride back from Egypt in 1981, says historian Richard Norton Smith, a former executive director of Ford’s presidential museum in Grand Rapids and author of Ford’s definitive biography, released last year.\n\n“They discovered that they had so much in common,” Smith told MLive. “They both were very much the products of a very specific time and place. And it turns out that Grand Rapids and Plains (Georgia) have more in common culturally, in terms of their values, than perhaps would be obvious.”\n\nBoth Carter and Ford came from humble beginnings, served in the U.S. Navy and held deep Christian faith. They had strong women for mothers and wives, and each raised three sons and a daughter.\n\n“I personally believe that the thing that brought them together more than anything else,” Smith chuckled, “was the fact that they both ran against Ronald Reagan.”\n\nReagan unsuccessfully challenged Ford for the Republican nomination in 1976, and Reagan defeated Carter in the 1980 presidential election.\n\nBy the time their plane landed in Washington, Carter and Ford had “buried the hatchet,” Smith says, and they formally agreed to do events at each other’s presidential libraries.\n\nThus sparked a unique and enduring bond between two former presidents – and their families – that set the standard for post-political friendships.\n\n“Their paths crossed under the right circumstances at the right time,” Smith said.\n\nRelated: 50 years ago, Gerald Ford’s VP ‘balancing act’ began\n\nCarter and Ford partnered on more than 25 projects from the 1980s until Ford’s death 17 years ago. In 1988, they chaired “American Agenda,” an unprecedented bipartisan project to tackle the nation’s political divisions.\n\nAfter the controversial 2000 election, they led an electoral reform commission that produced guidelines partly implemented by Congress. And just this past election cycle, their foundations partnered to promote civil campaigning.\n\nAs candidates, Williams said, Carter and Ford truly believed in their core values and what they prioritized.\n\n“I think that the two men were remarkably similar,” he said, “and therefore, it’s not too surprising that they would later find a great deal of common ground.”\n\nEven the First Ladies – Rosalynn Carter and Betty Ford – were great friends, Smith noted, and they formed a “marvelous lobbying team” on Capitol Hill for causes like mental health and drug addiction.\n\nWhen former presidents gathered in Washington 23 years ago to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the White House, Carter once recalled, “national historians who came there to speak all agreed that the two closest associations between former presidents in (the) history of America” were between he and Ford.\n\nRelated: Rosalynn Carter, outspoken former first lady, dead at 96\n\nFor Smith, this bond between a Democrat and Republican is “a nice antidote” to the cynicism of modern political strife.\n\n“At a time when it seems like we’re so polarized and so unwilling to accord the other side even basic respect,” he said, “the Carter-Ford relationship was a wonderful counter to that.”\n\nAs the two men grew older and closer, Carter and Ford made a pact that whoever outlived the other would eulogize him at his funeral. Ford, who was 11 years older, died in 2006 at age 93.\n\nAt the funeral in Grand Rapids, Carter began his eulogy with the opening sentence of his inaugural address: “For myself and for our nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.”\n\n“This was not just an official engagement,” Smith said. “This was the act of a friend honoring a friend.”\n\nCarter continued to tribute Ford in the years after. In 2014, he gave a lecture at Grand Rapids Community College and called Ford “the finest public servant I’ve ever known.”\n\nAnd in 2017, Ford’s presidential foundation awarded its annual public service medal to Carter, who said he was “grateful for the mutual respect and the intense personal friendship” he developed with his former rival.\n\nWhen President Ford’s youngest son, Steven, presented Carter that public service award six years ago, he recalled a lasting message of faith from his father.\n\n“I think it was Dad who used to tell us that he was so impressed with the shared values that Dad and you had together,” Steven Ford told Carter, “the shared faith that you had together that produced this lifelong friendship.”"
