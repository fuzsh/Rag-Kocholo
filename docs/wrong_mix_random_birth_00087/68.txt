Former President Jimmy Carter says he now has a different title: No. 1 latrine builder.

The 88-year-old visited a Revolutionary War monument in northeastern Pennsylvania on Tuesday to promote his foundation's efforts to develop peace and fight disease.

He and his 85-year-old wife, Rosalynn, also hosted a fund raising dinner in Wilkes-Barre.

Carter told a crowd of several hundred people at the Wyoming Monument that, "Pennsylvanians are good people, very hospitable and friendly."

The Nobel Peace Prize recipient spoke about his foundation, The Carter Center, and its worldwide mission of promoting peace and fighting disease in Third World countries.

He says the center has built nearly 3 million household latrines to reduce breeding centers for flies and that he's now known as the "No. 1 latrine builder in the entire world."
