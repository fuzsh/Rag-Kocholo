"All The Way, Boys" (Italian title: "Pi√π forte, ragazzi!") is a 1973 Italian film starring the popular comedy team of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer.

Plot

Salud (Bud Spencer) and Plata (Terence Hill) eke out a living as bush pilots in South America. They fake plane crashes in order to collect the insurance money, but one time the plane crashes for real in the middle of the jungle. There they find a diamond mining community operated by Mr. Ears (Reinhard Kolldehoff). Plata and Salud decide to make a living by competing against Mr. Ears, making delivery services by airplane. Salud meets with an old man (Cyril Cusack) in the village, where he takes him to see a mountain and tells him the story of three friends who killed themselves, and why. The story involves the mystery behind the old man's story, and various slapstick fights with Mr. Ears, who dislikes the competition.

A leisurely story, the movie has some fun and unique moments only Hill and Spencer can pull off. There's a screwball billiards competition, a lesson in how to launch a plane from a mountainside, and the opening sequence where the heroes crash-land a burning plane into an airport hanger, then split before they can be arrested. Filmed in Columbia, the scenery is gorgeous and refreshingly different.
