Bud (AKA Carlo Pedersoli) is perhaps best known for the films that he made in partnership with Terence Hill (AKA Mario Girotti). The pair proved to be a box office hit in a trio of Westerns directed by Giuseppe Colizzi during the late 1960s: God Forgives… I Don’t! (1967), Ace High (1968) and Boot Hill (1969). But it was Enzo Barboni’s They Call Me Trinity (1970) – and its sequel, Trinity is Still My Name (1971) – that transformed the pair into global megastars."
