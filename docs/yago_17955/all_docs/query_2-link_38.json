        "text": "By the late 1960's, Spaghetti Westerns had reached a reputation of expressing extreme violence and high body counts. Directors had explored nearly every avenue of the Western and audiences had grown tired of the cinematic savagery associated with the genre. Hence, the comedic Spaghetti Western was born. In 1967, an Italian director and writer named Giuseppe Colizzi cast a handsome leading man named \"Terence Hill\" (Mario Girotti) and an oversized, comedic foil named \"Bud Spencer\" (Carlo Pedersoli) as the protagonists in God Forgives...I Don't. \"Colizzi westerns present clever variations on several different kinds of partnerships encountered in other films inspired by A Few Dollars More\" (Fridlund 199 - 203). Hill and Spencer's portrayal of Cat \"Pretty Face\" Stevens and Hutch \"Jackass\" Bessy, changed the cinematic landscape of the traditional Spaghetti Western. In 1970, under the direction of E.B. Clucher (Enzo Barboni), Hill and Spencer completed a spaghetti western comedy, They Call Me Trinity, followed by a sequel, Trinity is Still My Name (1971). They Call Me Trinity is considered to be the best of the comedy Spaghetti Western films made in this era of European Westerns (Hughes 123). Hill and Spencer are the Spaghetti Western equivalent of Laurel and Hardy. This paper closely examines the comedic sub-genre of the Spaghetti Western by focusing on the performances of the films of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer in the late 1960’s and early 1970’s. The paper fills a gap in the research of the Spaghetti Western and European Western film genre."
