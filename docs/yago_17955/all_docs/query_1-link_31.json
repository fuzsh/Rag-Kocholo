Plata and Salud's profession is flying rickety planes over the unpredictable Amazon River jungles. Their latest assignment is to ditch a plane in the jungle so the owner can collect insurance money. The plan gets complicated when the plane actually does crash, leaving our heroes stranded amidst a colony of greedy and dangerous emerald miners. Laughs and excitement abound with the Trinity boys at their best!"
