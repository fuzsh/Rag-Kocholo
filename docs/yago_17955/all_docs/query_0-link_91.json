        "text": "Softcore Smorgasbord (August 4 – 10) All of the movies on this list have at one time or another been available through Something Weird Video. I’m sure I’ve missed some but many of them are still available on their website (until the end of 2024). These are their vintage softcore movies listed under categories with ridiculous names like: Nudie Cuties, Sexy Shockers, Sexo a-go-go, Twisted Sex, and Bucky Beaver’s Double Softies.\n\nDirected by Vicente Aranda (The Blood Spattered Bride), who wrote the story with Antonio Rabinad, based on the short story Bailando para Parker by Gonzalo Suárez, Exquisite Cadaver starts with a girl committing suicide by laying down headfirst on train tracks.\n\nWe meet a man (Carlos Estrada) who is the publisher of pulp horror — giallo — and someone who has become quite successful as a result. He gets a severed human hand in the mail, which he buries in a park. Another package is sent, this time with a torn dress and a photo of a woman. He also gets a telegram, which his wife (Teresa Gimpera, Hannah Queen of the Vampires) reads and it ends with the promise of sending a forearm. He lies and says its for work, but as she follows him, she notices that he is also being stalked by a woman in a black veil.\n\nThe woman is Parker (Capucine, The Pink Panther), who lures the man to her house where she gives him LSD. He staggers through her villa, following the sound of her voice, which leads him to a woman’s body inside a refrigerator. He passes out and wakes up at home, his wife having been called by Parker to get her husband.\n\nThe man reveals to his wife that he had an affair with a woman named Esther (Judy Matheson, The House That Vanished; is it too soon to talk about ’72?) who told him “I’d die so that my love for you will last. So that indifference will not kill it” before she laid down on the train tracks, as we saw as the movie began. Except that a detective that the man’s wife hired saved Esther.\n\nAs she tried to get her life together, Esther fell for a doctor before meeting Parker, who she soon began an affair with. Parker was in love with her, trying to save her, but Esther never stopped loving the man, finally killing herself. Parker then made this plan to get revenge for her lost love, even cutting. her corpse to pieces, sending each one until finally, the head arrives. The man looks for his wife but she is gone, leaving for Paris and a new relationship with Parker, who has seduced her.\n\nAfter filming ended, Aranda gave Matheson the silver hand pendant that her character wore in the film. She still has it to this day and even established a trademark of wearing it in her subsequent films.\n\nAs for the director, he had an accident on the set which led to him directing much of this movie from a stretcher.\n\nThanks to Theater of Guts, I know that this was released in the U.S. by Gadabout-Gaddis Productions, who released The Man from Nowhere, Find a Place to Die, Hatchet for the Honeymoon, One On Top of the Other and Marta. According to the site, it played drive-in screens as late as 1983 as a double feature with Twilight Zone: The Movie.\n\nThe title Exquisite Corpse comes from the game created by Surrealism founder André Breton that has a collection of words or images collectively assembled by several creators who have no idea what has come before other than a line, which is added to until a complete art piece emerges. The name comes from the phrase that was part of the first work created by the game, “The exquisite corpse shall drink the new wine.”\n\nThe Spanish title, Las Crueles (The Cruel Ones), is meant to sound like Les Diaboliques. It was not the title preferred by Aranda.\n\nThis was partially shot in the same house as Patrick Still Lives and Burial Ground. Thanks Erica from Unsung Horrors!\n\nUschi Digard week (June 23 – 29) Digard is best known for her work with Russ Meyer but she became an SWV fan favorite for two gargantuan reasons, her charm and her prolific career. The Swiss actress fled to America in 1968 and began a long career filling the silver screen from corner to corner with her overflowing positive energy. Show the lady some respect and watch one of her movies.\n\nThis is the first appearance in a Russ Meyer movie of Charles Napier. He plays Harry Thompson, a California border sheriff and marijuana smuggler who also somehow — spoiler warning — comes back from the dead to die again in Supervixens.\n\nBut as for this movie, it starts with a narration that blames marijuana for so many evils in society. Harry has ignored all that as he Harry works his sheriff job in between illegal activity. He lives at the site of a close silver mine with his English nurse girlfriend Cherry (Linda Ashton). As for Raquel (Larissa Ely), she’s a writer who has an interest in sexually pleasuring men. The two women learn of one another but Harry doesn’t want them to make love for some reason. When we first see Raquel, she’s in bed with Harry’s partner Enrique (Bert Santos). The two men work for Mr. Franklin (Frank Bolger), the town’s main politician, to move drugs. One of their other associates, the Apache (John Milo) is screwing everyone over. Franklin asks for him to be killed, but he gets away and steals Harry’s Jeep.\n\nNow, Enrique knows too much and he must be killed. But the Apache gets to him — and Mr. Franklin — first. Raquel finds his body and is so upset, she must be hospitalized. Good news. Her nurse is Cherry and they finally get together to make love, all while Harry and the Apache do the exact opposite and kill one another.\n\nBut ah — it was all a story that Raquel was writing. This strange ending may be because a lot of the film’s footage was accidentally ruined by the color lab. Roger Ebert said, “The result is that audiences don’t even realize anything is missing; a close analysis might reveal some cavernous gaps in the plot, and it is a little hard to figure out exactly how (or if) all the characters know each other, but Meyer’s subjective scenes are so inventive and his editing so confident that he simply sweeps the audience right along with him. Cherry, Harry and Raquel! is possibly the only narrative film ever made without a narrative.” Uschi Digard, the lover of the Apache, was also added Linda Ashton quit and you have to admit that she adds a lot to the film. Meyer claims the other actress quit over her pomeranians ruining the carpets of the motel they were staying in and the owner getting upset.\n\nHe also said, “The picture is the most successful film I have on cable television-or hotel-vision-because you never have to come in at the beginning. It doesn’t matter. It could be a loop.”\n\nIt also has one of the first instances of mainstream full frontal male nudity, which made it a controversial movie all the way back in 1969.\n\nJune 23: Junesploitation’s topic of the day — as suggested by F This Movie— is Free Space! We’re excited to tackle a different genre every day, so check back and see what’s next.\n\nOliver Drake may have started as an actor, but he’s probably best-known as a prolific screenwriter (151 movies!) and director (41 films, including two adult movies — Angelica: The Young Vixen and Ride A Wild Stud as Revilo Ekard and he was not fooling anyone with that Alucard scam) of low-budget Western films.\n\nA former cattle rancher, he brought his own trained horse with him to Hollywood. 1917, appearing with his trained horse. After acting in silent films, he directed, wrote and produced films for Gene Autry, Tex Ritter and others for RKO, Monogram and Republic. He was so invested in the Western film genre that he used his Pearblossom, California ranch for location shooting.\n\nBut by 1969, he was pretty much done in Hollywood. He’d moved to Las Vegas and decided to make a horror movie. Many claim that he didn’t ever work in horror before, but he wrote the 1968 proto slasher No Tears for the Damned AKA Las Vegas Strangler as well as The Mummy’s Curse, Riders of the Whistling Skull, the giallo-esque Sinister Hands and Weird Woman.\n\nIn Tom Weaver’s Interviews With B Science Fiction and Horror Movie Makers, this movie’s star Anthony Eisley (Dracula vs. Frankenstein) said, “The director was quite senile at the time — the absolute epitome of total confusion.”\n\nThat claim is denied by the director’s daughter, who said on IMDB, “Oliver Drake would have agreed with these reviews. I should know because he was my father. He was his harshest critic & did not enjoy watching this after it resurfaced on VHS. It is also incorrect that this was the only monster movie he ever made, The Mummy’s Curse comes to mind. But I completely disagree with comments by Anthony Eisley that my father was senile during the making of this film! Its true that this film was never finished and sat on the shelf for years. My father went on to write two books, both of which were very well received by critics. He attended many Western Film Festivals as the guest of honor and gave very informative and entertaining speeches about the early days of film-making.”\n\nThe Mummy and the Curse of the Jackals was written and co-produced by William C. Edwards. He only has three movies on his IMDB page with one being the aforementioned Ride A Wild Stud (“When men were men — and women didn’t forget it!”) and Dracula (The Dirty Old Man), another movie that has a jackal-man, as Dracula — using the Alucard name, see it never gets old — enslaves Dr. Irving Jekyll, making him a werejackal and forcing him to bring women to his cabin. It’s the kind of movie where you can see the stick that’s holding up a vampire bat.\n\nMan, Edwards loved the Alucard trick. After all, this has a mummy named Sirakh instead of Kharis and the Ananka character — yes, he also adored Universal horror movies — is Akanna. Well, guess what? This movie is kind of, sort of a sequel to that movie, as it brings back the werejackal under the name Irving Jackalman.\n\nSo how did this get made? Well, Drake ended up in Vegas and Edwards was working with Vega International Pictures. According to an article in The Las Vegas Sun, this was just the first of many films the studio had in the works: “The Mummy and the Curse of the Jackal is designed as a breakaway from the high camp and pseudo-intellectual spook picture. Said one Vega executive, “There’s no social comment and no hidden meaning. The horror characters were designed to scare the hell out of the audience and that’s that.””\n\nSupposedly, the production ran out of financing before it was completed and all of the footage was confiscated by an unpaid contractor, which is how it ended up on VHS when Academy released a decimated looking copy in 1985, complete with sitar music — I guess that’s Egyptian, said someone — and surf rock instrumentals instead of whatever music the filmmakers intended. Or maybe Drake himself was looking to sell it at one point. There are also vague reports of it playing in 1969 at an L.A. theater for investors and on a horror UHF show. Somehow, Drake sold They Ran for Their Lives to the CBS Late Movie, so anything is possible.\n\nMaybe I should tell you the story of this movie now.\n\nThe sarcophagus of Princess Akana (Marliza Pons, who was a famous belly dancer in Las Vegas and supposedly had an uncredited part in Cleopatra and is also in Did Baby Shoot Her Sugardaddy? along with Rene Bond) is being displayed by controversial archeologist Dave Barrie (Anthony Eisley), along with another mummy. She’s remarkably well-preserved and he falls in love with her, falling for the curse of the jackal, which transforms him into a jackal by the light of the full moon. And by jackal, I mean he looks a lot like my chihuahua.\n\nLet me tell you, the place that he stores these mummies is in no way hermetically sealed or scientific minded. It’s a shack probably in Hendersonville and it looks like a total mess.\n\nThe princess wakes up and Dave falls in love with her, taking her on dates and teaching her how to put on a bra, which is a modern invention that she doesn’t understand. I have to tell you, I’ve seen a lot in movies but nothing prepared me for a movie where a werejackal by night explains to an undead Egyptian how a Maidenform works. They also go see a Vegas show, at which point the other mummy awakens and attacks an exotic dancer before blasting his way through a wall.\n\nI was wondering, how could this get better? And then John Carradine shows up for all of a minute to say scientific things like, “I can tell from the mold accumulation that this casket is 4,000 years old.”\n\nIs this heaven? Yes, if heaven has a werejackal and a mummy battling on Fremont Street back when Vegas was seedier and cooler and filled with tourists who just look and keep gambling, because yeah, sure, you see monsters fighting every day but you only get the chance to do Vegas once every few years.\n\nCan it get better? Well, the mummy is played by a man named Saul Goldsmith, which is the least frightening mummy name ever.\n\nThis is eighty minutes of film with two sentences of plot, which is just how I like it. You come here wanting to see monsters and man, you get monsters. It also completely rips off the Universal version of The Mummy but adds in a Herschell Gordon Lewis-style tongue ripping out effect. It also has a scene where Dave takes Akana — who also has a magic ring that can hypnotize people — on a double date where he claims that “She’s not from here. She comes from … back east.”\n\nThe cinematographer of this was William G. Troiano, who also worked on the Vegas productions Ride a Wild Stud, They Ran for Their Lives and No Tears for the Damned. He’d follow this by going to work on Horror of the Blood Monsters. He also shot She Freak, The Devil’s Messenger and The Wild World of Batwoman. What a career!\n\nThe makeup effects — such as they are — are by Byrd Holland, whose credits stretch across the gamut of my cinematic obsessions, working on everything from Rabid and The Baby to Lemora, The Undertaker and His Pals and Terror Circus. Supposedly, he spent days doing a transformation scene that was cut from the film. He was assisted by Jack Shafton (the creature developer for The Intruder Within and effects on Jennifer) and Tony Tierney (effects for Dracula vs. Frankenstein and The Astro-Zombies). Its effects come from Harry Woolman, who was also on Evilspeak, Hangar 18, In Search of Historic Jesus, The Incredible Melting Man, Rattlers, Supervan, Love Camp 7, Dolemite, Don’t Go Near the Park and so many more movies. Again, what a career!\n\nThis movie really is a nexus point for my fascinations.\n\nIt has no fewer than four assistant directors. Wyott Ordung shot second unit for The Navy vs. the Night Monsters and wrote Robot Monster. Willard Kirkham was on second unit for The Dark and Plan 9 from Outer Space. Russell Hayden only worked on this film, but Robert Farfan was an assistant director on Rebel Without a Cause, which is classy, and more movies I’d be proud to say I worked on, like Bride of the Monster and Moonfire.\n\nThis is a movie filled with werejackal murders of winos and cops. I’ve oversold it beyond belief so when you watch it, you may wonder why I love it so. I love the idea of it, I adore the fact that it exists and this to me is why movies are made in the first place. It has Carradine solemnly intone, “We can’t just stand by and let a 4,000-year-old mummy and a jackal man take over the city!” It was made by people who had astounding careers both before and after. And here we are, in a world where we can say, “I know I could watch a movie that critics worldwide agree is true cinema that makes the blind see and the lame walk, but I’m going to watch The Mummy and the Curse of the Jackals and disappoint everyone.”\n\nSeverin is releasing this as a totally cleaned up version that I can’t wait to watch. They found a print at Ewing “Lucky: Brown’s Los Angeles estate sale and added two hours of special features, including another Vega International Pictures film, the once lost movie Angelica, The Young Vixen.\n\nUntil then, you can watch the battered original VHS version on YouTube and Tubi.\n\nA lot of the info for this post came from the amazing Monster Kid Classic Horror Forum.\n\nApril 1: Drop A Bomb — Please share your favorite critical and financial flop with us!\n\nNo, not Jess Franco’s Justine which came out the same year.\n\nThis is a bigger movie.\n\nMaybe not better.\n\nDirected by George Cukor and Joseph Strick and written by Lawrence B. Marcus from the novel by Lawrence Durrell, Justine takes what is seemingly an impenetrable source and turns out, well, something.\n\nWhy two directors? The pre-production was done by Strick, who intended to shoot the movie in Morocco. He did some location filming there, but battled Fox execs and star Anouk Aimée. When he did not hire along with the studio’s wishes — and fell asleep on the set while working — Cukor was brought in. Instead of shooting on location, the rest was shot in Hollywood.\n\nIt ended up losing $6,602,000, which in today’s money is $55,824,857.00.\n\nLet’s go back a bit. The book that this was based on is part of The Alexandria Quartet, a tetralogy of novels by British writer Lawrence Durrell. The first three books are a Rashomon-like telling of three perspectives on a single set of events and characters in Egypt, before and during the Second World War. The fourth book is set six years later. Justine is the best-known of these books. The author saw the four novels as an exploration of relativity and the notions of continuum and subject–object relation all within the theme of modern love.\n\nSeems like a blockbuster, right?\n\nIn the book, the narrator — unnamed but revealed as a man named Darley in later novels — tells of his time in Alexandria and his tragic romance with Justine, a mysterious Jewish woman who was once poor and now married to the rich Egyptian Nessim. Darley is quite similar in background and life to the actual writer of this book.\n\nI love the way that Justine herself is described: “alluring, seductive, mournful and prone to dark, cryptic pronouncements.” Feels like my dating history. There’s also another book within the book written by another lover of Justine, as well as her diary, all of which tell of her many lovers and teh dark hurricane that she brings into the lives of men.\n\nThere are also bits about the study of the Kabbalah and secret political games.\n\nAs for Durrell, he was born in India to British colonial parents and spent much of his life traveling the world. He worked as a senior press officer to the British embassies in Athens and Cairo, press attaché in Alexandria and Belgrade and director of the British Institutes in Kalamata, Greece and Córdoba, Argentina. He was also director of Public Relations for the Dodecanese Islands and Cyprus. Yet he resisted only being listed as British and didn’t even have citizenship, needing to apply for a visa every time he came to the country, which was embarrassing to diplomats. Also, he may have had a relationship with his daughter Sappho Jane, who was named for the Greek poet whose name is associated with lesbianism.\n\nIt’s hard to sum up an artist’s complex life in one paragraph but there you go.\n\nAnyways, this movie feels cursed. Even people who left it worked on bombs. For example, Joseph L. Mankiewicz was working on the screenplay when he was approached to take over Cleopatra. Speaking of that movie, it’s failure led to original producer Walter Wanger being fired and original star — and the person often blamed for Cleopatra — Elizabeth Taylor being replaced.\n\nThe actress who was picked to play Justine, Anouk Aimée, was so upset at being separated from her lover Albert Finney that she wanted to leave. The actor had to visit her and tell her to complete the movie. In the book Conversations with My Elders, Cukor was asked who the worst actor he had ever worked with. He answered Aimée, saying “That picture could have been much more than it was allowed to be.” He said that the problem was “Attitude. Intractible. Like Marilyn Monroe, but without the results. Let me tell you, that girl knew she’d probably never work in Hollywood again, or she’d never have defied me like that.”\n\nI love this review from Roger Ebert: “What Cukor has salvaged from this morass is rather remarkable. “Justine” is a movie that doesn’t work and is usually confusing, but all the same it’s a movie with a texture, an atmosphere, that’s almost hypnotic. People who go to movies to enjoy the story will be enraged, and people who go to Justine with any familiarity with Lawrence Durrell’s Alexandria Quartet will be appalled. But people who go to movies to watch the way scenes work, and to relish the rhythm of an actor’s performance, will like Justine more than they expected to.”\n\nThere’s a great cast at least. Nessim is played by John Vernon, Darley by Michael York, Narouz is Robert Forster, Pursewarden is Dirk Bogarde, plus there are roles from Jack Albertson, Michael Constantine, Michael Dunn, Barry Morse and Severn Darden. They’re great actors seeking a script to work with and sometimes it works, but there’s so much to get through and the first hour seemingly is formless. I don’t know if this film came out today if anyone would even feel like wading through it; attention spans have changed greatly in its lifetime.\n\nIn the 60s, 20th Century Fox seemed like they were unable to get anything going. Cleopatra was such a failure that they had to release all of their contract actors just to save money and sold their studios to Alcoa. They were saved by the box office of The Longest Day, The Sound of Music, Fantastic Voyage and Planet of the Apes but would make other flops from 1969 to 1971, including Hello, Dolly! and Myra Breckinridge.\n\nYou can watch this on YouTube."
