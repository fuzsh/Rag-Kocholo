A gunslinger learns about it and decides he wants the money for himself and so hatches an elaborate plot to get at it. He lures the crook into a rigged poker game, and afterward a gunfight ensues. The quick-drawing gunman makes short work of the robber, then teams up with an insurance agent to look for the hidden fortune. Unbeknownst to them, the robber had an ace up his sleeve...",

        "text": "“I swear to god, grandpa, he’s gonna be mighty sorry he ain’t dead.”\n\nI’ve been on a typical Terence Hill and Bud Spencer binge today, with three different features concluding with this one. The pair actually met each other for the very first time on the set of this film; it was a complete chance meeting, as Hill was actually recast in place of another actor who was injured onset. Thus, one of the most dynamic duos was formed, though it wouldn’t be until They Call Me Trinity that they’d get their biggest break.\n\nThe plot to God Forgives... I Don’t! follows Hutch Bessy, an insurance investigator (Spencer) and gunslinger, Cat Stevens (Hill) as they team up to hunt down the…\n\n“I dreamt that a mountain crashed down right on top of me.”\n\nTrain robbery massacre! The Cat (Terence Hill), the Dog (Bud Spencer) and the Fox (Frank Wolff). The first pairing of what would become the legendary beans and fists duo of Hill and Spencer shows hints of their slapstick future, but is decidedly more down-to-earth.\n\nThe chemistry between the two is already there, but for me, they were upstaged by character actor Frank Wolff, here playing one of his greatest villain roles, the psychotic bandit “Bill San Antonio,” looking like an absolute madman with his Irish curls and friendly mutton chops. He plays the character with a certain fey derangement, wrist a little limp, a big fan of Hill’s…\n\n\"They call him... PRETTY FACE!\"\n\nVideo Pirate: I'm SOOO scared.\n\nWith an original working title of The Dog, The Cat, and The Fox - God Forgives... I Don't! (1967) is heavily influenced by The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly (1966). One of many spaghetti westerns that hoped to follow on Leone's coattails, Giuseppe Colizzi struck gold with an early pairing of celebrated screen duo Terence Hill and Bud Spencer. Responsible for a trilogy of westerns before their immensely popular Trinity series, it is these Colizzi films that explore the star's chemistry and the character dynamics that would define much of the pair's output over the next two decades.\n\nA brutal train robbery looks like the work of a notorious…\n\nMinor spoilers ahead.\n\nGod Forgives … I Don’t! is probably best known for being the first on-screen pairing of Bud Spencer and Terence Hill (or, to use the names they had before they became famous under their American monikers, Mario Girotti and Carlo Pedersoli). Meeting for the first time at the start of shooting, the two immediately became fast friends, developing a chemistry that shone through on screen. Director Giuseppe Colizzi would go on to team them three more times ( he only directed six films before his early death, and all but two featured the Spencer/Hill pairing), but the pair would really cement themselves in the spaghetti western hall of fame with the comedic Trinity trilogy, starting in 1970.…\n\nOf the many things that Italian westerns excelled in, the most cool has to be their titles. GOD FORGIVES... I DON'T has to rank among the best. Short, succinct and full of menace. The best news is that the film is as cool as the title.\n\nA train full of dead passengers and a missing shipment of gold set off a chain of events that pairs a card shark on the run and an insurance investigator against a cunning criminal who may have faked his death. Double crosses, hidden knives, torture, and a weird dixieland score are just some of the highlights to be found.\n\nThis was the first pairing of the Hill / Spencer duo who would go on…"
