Behind that big body was once an Olympic swimmer who competed twice with the Italian Swimming Team, in Helsinki 1952 and Melbourne 1956, and he was the first Italian to swim 100 meters under one minute. Before his acting career took off in the late 1960s he was also a lyricist to Italian pop singers.\n\nHe changed his name in 1967 when a producer though that a movie he was doing had international potential, the same movie also starred Mario Girotti, Carlo choosed Spencer, after Spencer Tracy, and Bud after his favorite beer, and Mario changed his name to Terence Hill. A popular duo was born, though they had acted together in a movie before, the Victure Mature spectacle Hannibal 1959.\n\nThe young fit swimmer, they didn't shave and wax off their body hair back in those days.\n\nEducated as an attorney, he was bitten by the acting bug and appeared as a member of the Praetorian Guard in his first movie, MGM's epic Quo Vadis (1951) (which was shot in Italy) in 1951. During the 1950s and first half of the 1960s he appeared in films mostly made for the Italian market only\n\nHis tough look in Un eroe dei nostri tempi aka A Hero of Our Times 1954, an Alberto Sordi comedy directed by Mario Monicelli.\n\nHannibal 1959 was the first movie that also had Terence Hill in the cast, though they didn't have any scenes together.\n\nDio perdona... io no! aka God Forgives...I Don't! 1967 was the first movie the popular duo made under their new acting names. A Spaghetti Western film directed and written by Giuseppe Colizzi.\n\nThe chemestry between the two actors were duly noted, and Bud created the character he would continue to play in most of his roles, big, strong, childish, goodhearted and always fighting for the good side.\n\nIt's the first part of the trilogy that continued with I quattro dell'Ave Maria aka Ace High 1968 and La collina degli stivali aka Boot Hill 1969.\n\nThese are full blooded Spaghetti Western movies, before they moved over to the more lighthearted family-friendly movies.\n\nLo chiamavano Trinità... aka They Call Me Trinity 1970, where the duo moved over to comedy and became even more popular, and continued in a sequel, ...continuavano a chiamarlo Trinità aka My Name is Still Trinity 1971.\n\nIl corsaro nero aka Blackie the Pirate 1971, trying their style outside the western genre.\n\nAn old-fashioned swashbuckler with comedy.\n\n4 mosche di velluto grigio aka Four Flies on Grey Velvet 1971, from time to time Bud went solo, like this one, an Italian Giallo directed by Dario Argento.\n\nAnche gli angeli mangiano fagioli aka Even Angels Eat Beans 1973, a gangster comedy where Bud was paired with Giuliano Gemma.\n\nPiedone lo sbirro aka Flatfoot aka The Knock-Out Cop 1973, a Euro Crime (poliziottesco) comedy that became so popular that Bud continued to play Flatfoot who fights criminals in his own special way, in Hong Kong 1975, Africa 1978 and Egypt 1979.\n\nI due superpiedi quasi piatti aka Crime Busters 1977, with Terence, an action crime comedy made on locations in Miami.\n\nIo sto con gli ippopotami aka I'm for the Hippopotamus 1979, with Terence, an adventure comedy.\n\nUno sceriffo extraterrestre... poco extra e molto terrestre aka The Sheriff and the Satelite Kid 1979, a family friendly childrens comedy.\n\nChi trova un amico trova un tesoro aka Who Finds a Friend Finds a Treasure 1981 an adventure comedy made on locations at Key Biscayne.\n\nNati con la camicia aka Go for It 1983, Bud and Terence take on spy movies in this parody, filmed on locations in Miami.\n\nMiami Supercops 1985.\n\nThis comedy would be the last movie Bud and Terence made together for nine years.\n\nSuperfantagenio aka Alladin 1986, with Bud as the Genie. A very family-friendly adventure comedy.\n\nBud moved over to television and starred in six feature length TV-movies as the crime fighting Big Man in 1988.\n\nBud continued on television as detective Extralarge in twelve feature length TV-movies between 1991 and 1993.\n\nBotti de Natale aka Troublemakers aka The Fight Before Christmas 1994, Bud Spencer and Terence Hill's last movie together. As brothers who hates each other but must spend Christmas together with their mother, played bt Ruth Buzzi.\n\nBud Spencer and Terence Hill made either 18 or 20 (depending on the source) movies together.\n\nPromoting his last cinema movie Mord ist mein Geschäft, Liebling\n\naka Murder is My Business, Honey 2009, a German crime comedy.\n\nI delitti del cuoco aka The Chef's Crimes 2010, an Italian crime comedy TV-Series, with Bud as a former police constable who is trying to live the quiet life as a chef on the Island of Ischia, but keeps becoming involved in crimes anyway.\n\nThis became the last acting of Bud Spencer.\n\nPrivatly Bud Spencer had married Maria Amato in 1960, a marriage that would last until Bud died in 2016 at the age of 86, and produce three offsprings.\n\nIn 2017 a statue was unveiled of Bud Spencer in Budapest Hungary, in remembrance of his enourmous popularity during the Communist era in Hungary. One of the unveilers was one of Bud's daughters.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nThoughts, ideas, memories, lists, favorites and anything else connected with Bud Spencer is very very welcome!"
