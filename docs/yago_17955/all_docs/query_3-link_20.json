        "text": "00 12/11/2019 19:47\n\nCheers to all,\n\nCan someone tell me where I can find long version of Piu Forte ragazzi movie??On wiki I saw this movie length is 120 min.\n\nWhy only 90 min version is available?\n\nI want to buy long original movie.Can u help me pls?\n\nthanks\n\nI found all movie cut scene here:\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZSRahbM4P0&feature=emb_title\n\n[Modificato da bogdanc 12/11/2019 19:47]\n\n10 13/11/2019 13:54\n\nHi mate. ðŸ™‚\n\nThe full version was in some websites in past years but now there's nothing,all had been removed.\n\nOne of those websites is this one:\n\nroybattyhd.blogspot.com/2015/03/piu-forte-ragazzi-versione-tede...\n\nYou can see that all the links are not working.Try to contact that blogger,Roy Batty,and ask him if he can help you.\n\n[Modificato da K-1 13/11/2019 13:55]\n\n00 13/11/2019 18:03\n\nI will never understand why all television are cut these gorgeus movies.I hate them.Even on blu-ray and dvd disc many movies are cutted.\n\nAll respect for Italian people,because they are only ones from the world who do not cut from the movies.But are very strange because this movies runtime on Italian version are only 90 min,and on german version 101 min.Original long version of this movies based on Wikipedia are 122 min.\n\nIn the meantime I got it runtime movie 113 min,is STILL missing 9 min of movies,and languages are mixed.german+italian speak :(\n\nlink of only 113 min movie: drive.google.com/file/d/1dkdfrU3JVyQBSoS0Pv2PKio_fGd4i...\n\nI will never find the 122 min ita version :(\n\n00 13/11/2019 20:18\n\nThe 122 minutes runtime is not sure at all.People who have original 35 mm films of the '70s say that the runtime is actually 113 minutes.\n\nAnd this is confirmed by the fact that the konwn amount of the cuts is of 22 minutes.\n\n[Modificato da K-1 13/11/2019 20:22]\n\n00 13/11/2019 22:08\n\nwell,so 113 min is the long version available right?I m so glad if I find 113 min version of english or Italian language not mixed,and mkv quality of course :)\n\nI don t like german language :)\n\nStill searching...\n\n[Modificato da bogdanc 13/11/2019 22:11]\n\n00 13/11/2019 23:04\n\nIf it really exists (and I doubt it),this 122 minutes version must be something never released to the public.It could have been destroyed or being retained in some old,dusty cabinet of the production.\n\nBut,I repeat,I'm sure it simply doesn't exist.We have the evidence of the 35 mm films I mentioned before.\n\nAnyway,good luck with your search. ðŸ™‚"
