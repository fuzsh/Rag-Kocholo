... All The Way, Boys! (aka Italian: ... Più forte ragazzi! and Plane Crazy) is a 1973 Italian adventure film directed by Giuseppe Colizzi. The film stars the popular quasi-comedy team of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer. The duo, known as “The Trinity Boys,” made 18 films together, most in the Spaghetti Western genre, but ... All The Way, Boys! was the first film set in a modern context, although many other slapstick elements of the earlier films were carried over.
