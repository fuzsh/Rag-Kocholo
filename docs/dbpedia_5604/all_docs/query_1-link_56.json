        "text": "The Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science provides a top-ranked engineering and computer science education in upstate New York. Our exceptional faculty members are both innovative researchers and supportive professors.\n\nStudents come to Watson College from all over the world and represent a wide range of backgrounds and interests. They graduate with broad-based skills and the entrepreneurial spirit to succeed in fields ranging from mechanical engineering to hospital operations to the law.\n\nWe are in the high-tech heart of upstate New York state with industry partnerships, class projects and internship opportunities that provide a wealth of hands-on experience for graduate and undergraduate students alike.\n\nOfficial Mission Statement\n\nThe mission of Watson College is to provide education and research in the broad field of engineering and applied science. To fulfill this mission, the School will:\n\noffer baccalaureate,master's and doctoral programs that prepare graduates for employment in the technical professions and combine\n\na firm grounding in fundamentals,\n\nelements of practical application and\n\nan appreciation for liberal learning.\n\nconduct basic and applied research which expands the technical knowledge base and advances industrial practice.\n\nprovide support for the economic development of the State of New York.\n\nensure that its programs are accessible to the widest possible range of individuals and institutions.\n\nwork with industry and community partners, foster participation and representation from traditionally underrepresented groups in technical research and education.\n\nsupport the profession of engineering through continuing education opportunities for practicing professionals.\n\nAccreditation\n\nThe Bachelor of Science program in Computer Science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.\n\nThe Bachelor of Science programs in Engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.\n\nProfessional Licensure\n\nThe bachelor of science programs in engineering are licensure-qualifying programs. Students in a bachelor of science program in engineering who are within 20 credits of graduation, or who have graduated from one of Binghamton University's EAC/ABET accredited bachelor of science programs in engineering, are automatically eligible to sit for the NCEES FE exam (National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying, Fundamentals of Engineering exam).\n\nPlease note: Students who have previously been convicted of a felony are advised that their prior criminal history may impede their ability to complete the requirements of programs in the Watson College, participate in certain activities or projects, and/or obtain professional engineering licenses.\n\nStudents who have concerns about such matters are advised to contact the Watson College's associate dean for academic affairs and administration in the dean's office.\n\nClick here for the Professional Licensure Disclosure.\n\nDean Atul Kelkar\n\nProfessor, Mechanical Engineering\n\nakelkar1@binghamton.edu\n\nAtul Kelkar was appointed the dean of the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science at Binghamton University in July 2024. Prior to his appointment, Kelkar was the D.W. Reynolds Distinguished Professor and Department Chair of Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University, serving since August 2018. Before joining Clemson University, he was the program director of the Dynamics Control and System Diagnostics Program in CMMI Division at the National Science Foundation. Kelkar was an associate chair for research and technology transfer in mechanical engineering and professor-in-charge for industry research and entrepreneurship for the College of Engineering at Iowa State University, where he was a faculty member for 18 years. He received his PhD in mechanical engineering from Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., in 1993 while working as a research scientist at the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va.\n\nKelkar is a fellow of ASME, associate fellow of AIAA and senior member of IEEE. He is a recipient of NSF’s prestigious CAREER Award in his early faculty career. He continues to lead various activities for the ASME and IEEE professional societies. He has been the associate editor for key ASME and IEEE journals, served on program committees for various IEEE and ASME conferences, and organized and chaired several technical sessions at these conferences.\n\nHis research has led to several patents and more than 160 archival publications, which include several conference and journal articles, handbook chapters and research monographs. He has mentored over 60 graduate students and several postdoctoral students. Even in his administrative position, he continues to serve as a mentor for graduate students and young faculty.\n\nKelkar’s research has been in dynamics and control with a focus on modeling and control of aerospace systems, control theory, active control of vibrations and noise, and energy technologies. He is also a co-founder of five different technology startups that are acquiring competitive projects from the NSF, NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense. Three of these companies have also won awards at the state level and have successfully commercialized technologies that Kelkar developed. His research and entrepreneurial success have led to several newspaper and magazine articles as well as interviews on national and local public radio stations and TV stations.\n\nDean’s Office Staff\n\nDepartment Chairs\n\nWatson Advisory Board\n\nWatson New York Metro Advisory Board"
