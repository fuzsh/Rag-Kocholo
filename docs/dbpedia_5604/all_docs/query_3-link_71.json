        "text": "The annual Academy Awards presentation always is exciting.\n\nTwo men from East Central Indiana have been nominated for a total of nine Academy Awards. One of them, a Richmond native, was nominated for five. The other, from Winchester, won four Oscars.\n\nGeorge Duning was born in Richmond on Feb. 25, 1908. He was the son of a local grocer who lived at 305 S. 11th St. After the family moved to Cincinnati, Duning took up playing the trumpet as a teenager. He also began writing and conducting.\n\nAt the age of 18, he went on the road to play jazz and ended up studying music composition in Hollywood. He eventually wrote for radio, and in 1934, he became a full-time arranger.\n\nBy 1944, he was doing production arrangements for Columbia Pictures. His first film as sole composer was \"Johnny O’Clock\" in 1947.\n\nDuning would be given a script while movies were still being filmed, so he knew ahead of time what the story was about. Cue sheets were prepared, and he would run the edited film to determine the dramatic feel of the story, where the music was to be and what it should evoke.\n\nDuning scored more than 40 movies including \"From Here to Eternity\" (1953), \"Picnic\" (1955), \"3:10 to Yuma\" (1957), \"Bell, Book & Candle\" (1958), \"Houseboat\" (1960) and \"The Devil at 4 O’Clock\" (1961).\n\nHis song \"Moonglow\" in the film \"Picnic\" became an iconic moment in 1950s cinema. He merged a unique arrangement of the song with the movie’s theme at a critical moment. The pairing shot the song to No. 1 on the Billboard charts, and later renditions by Perry Como, Harry James and Liberace became hits. Two decades later, Lalo Schifrin made it into a disco arrangement.\n\nDuning also scored music for such TV shows as \"The Naked City\" (1958), \"Tightrope\" (1959), \"Daniel Boone\" (1964), \"Mannix\" (1965 ), \"The Big Valley\" (1965), \"The Time Tunnel\" (1966) and the original \"Star Trek\" (1968 and 1969).\n\nHe had a prodigious career for which he received five Academy Award nominations for \"Jolson Sings Again\" (1949), \"No Sad Songs for Me\" (1950), \"From Here to Eternity,\" \"Picnic\" and \"The Eddie Duchin Story\" (1956).\n\nRobert Wise was born in Winchester on Sept. 10, 1914. His father was a meatpacker. The family moved to Connersville when Wise was very young. He attended public school and wrote humor and sports columns for the school newspaper. His favorite pastime was going to movies.\n\nAfter graduation, he sought a career in journalism and attended Franklin College. Because of the Great Depression, he was unable to attend a second year of college. So in 1933, he moved to Hollywood where his brother helped him get a job at RKO Pictures in the shipping department. Wise worked odd jobs and eventually moved up to film editing. His first solo ventures were the well-received ‘\"Bachelor Mother’\" and \"My Favorite Wife,\" both in 1939.\n\nAt RKO, he worked with Orson Welles on the cinematic classic \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), which was nominated for an Academy Award for film editing.\n\nWise later directed more than 40 films covering many genres. Some of them include: \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (1951), \"So Big\" (1953), \"Somebody Up There Likes Me\" (1956), \"I Want to Live\" (1958), \"Run Silent, Run Deep\" (1958), \"The Haunting\" (1963), \"The Sound of Music\" (1965), \"The Sand Pebbles\" (1966), \"The Andromeda Strain\" (1971) and \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" (1979).\n\nWise directed Hollywood icons such as Clark Gable, Burt Lancaster, Barbara Stanwyck, Steve McQueen, Anthony Hopkins, Julie Andrews, Paul Newman, Robert Mitchum, Richard Burton, William Holden, Shirley McClaine and James Cagney.\n\nHe won Academy Awards for best director and best picture for both \"West Side Story\" (1961) and \"The Sound of Music.\""
