        "text": "1862 — Near Frederick, Md., Sergeant John Bloss and Corporal Barton Mitchell of the 27th Indiana Civil War Regiment found three cigars wrapped in paper. The paper turned out to be Special Order #191, containing valuable battle plans from Confederate General Robert E. Lee. The two Indiana soldiers sent the document through channels to Union General George McClellan who immediately saw its strategic value.\n\n1914 — Robert Wise was born in Winchester, Ind. After attending Franklin College for one year, he went to Hollywood. He soon became an accomplished film editor, working with Orson Welles on the classic “Citizen Kane.” Later, as one of the top directors, he won Oscars for “West Side Story” and “The Sound of Music.”\n\n1932 — Over 10,000 witnessed the unveiling of a statue of Abraham Lincoln in Fort Wayne. “The Hoosier Youth,” a 12-foot bronze sculpture by artist Paul Manship, depicts the young Lincoln in the woods of Indiana. He is seated on a tree stump holding a book, with an ax and a dog at his side. In addition to the sculptor, dignitaries at the unveiling included Senator James E. Watson, Evans Woolen of the Indiana Historical Society, and noted Lincoln biographer Ida M. Tarbell.\n\n1974 — The first public event was held at the new Market Square Arena in Indianapolis. Singer Glen Campbell entertained the large opening night audience.\n\n2001 — Terrorists attacked the Twin Towers in New York City. Within 24 hours, Task Force One from Indianapolis was assisting at Ground Zero."
