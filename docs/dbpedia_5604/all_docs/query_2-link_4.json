        "text": "Private liberal arts college in Franklin, Indiana, US\n\nFranklin College is a private liberal arts college in Franklin, Indiana. It was founded in 1834 and has a wooded campus spanning 207 acres (84 ha) including athletic fields and a 31-acre (13 ha) biology woodland. The college offers its approximately 1,000 students Bachelor of Arts degrees in 49 majors from 25 academic disciplines, 43 minors, 11 pre-professional programs, and 5 cooperative programs. The college also offers a Master of Science in Athletic Training and a Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies. In 1842, the college began admitting women, becoming the first coeducational institution in Indiana and the seventh in the nation. Franklin College has historically maintained an affiliation with the American Baptist Churches USA.\n\nFranklin College was originally founded in 1834 as the Indiana Baptist Manual-Labor Institute,[2] a manual labor college. Ten years later, the Indiana General Assembly changed the school's name to Franklin College.[3]\n\nLocated in Franklin, the college's 207-acre (0.84 km2) campus includes an athletic park and a 31-acre (130,000 m2) woodland for biology study. Nearly all the buildings on campus are placed around an ellipse known as Dame Mall, named after John Dame, the first-ever graduate of Franklin College.\n\nIn 1962, a large statue of Benjamin Franklin was gifted to the college from the Indianapolis Typographical Union. It is on campus today at the corner of Branigin Boulevard and Monroe Street.\n\nThe bronze \"Ben Bench\" outside the Napolitan Student Center was donated to the college in 2005 by Bohdan Mysko, a retired businessman and art collector. He purchased the sculpture from artist George Lundeen in 1990. The sculpture was produced sixteenth in a series of the 20 identical ones that Lundeen created.\n\nThe Von Boll Welcome Center was opened in 2003 and houses the offices of admissions and financial aid.\n\nThe Napolitan Student Center, opened in 2004, is a hub of student activity on campus and home to the dining hall, the college bookstore, a large atrium, the Center for Diversity and Inclusion, the Student Activity Center, Grizzly Cafe, campus security office, conference rooms, counseling, and health center, and the Branigin Room, which is used for lectures, award ceremonies, and community functions.\n\nBranigin Boulevard, opened in 2004, serves as the main entrance to campus. The project was a collaboration between the college and the city of Franklin.\n\nThe Napolitan Alumni House was dedicated in 2005. The historic three-story brick house once served as the home to college presidents. It currently serves as a gathering place during special events as well as accommodations for visiting dignitaries.\n\nAnother hub of student activity is the Spurlock Center, which contains classroom space, a fitness center, gymnasium, indoor track, the Franklin College Athletic Hall of Fame, and athletic offices. This is also where pep rallies, school assemblies, commencement, and numerous presentations involving guest speakers are held.\n\nRichardson Chapel hosts services and special events for students, faculty, staff, and the community.\n\nThe Wellhouse that stands in Dame Mall was constructed in 1917 as a monument to the Class of 2016 and was built by Blanche Crawford, class of 1916.\n\nThe Dietz Center for Professional Development was dedicated in 1994. It houses the offices of Leadership Johnson County at Franklin College and connects to the Dietz Residence Hall.\n\nThe Andrews-Dietz House on campus was dedicated in 2005 and houses the Marketing and Communications Offices.\n\nOld Main, the iconic clock tower located at the campus entrance, is used for classes in varying subjects. It also houses offices for areas of campus such as Information Technology Services, Development and Alumni Engagement, the Business Office, the President's Office, and a variety of faculty and staff offices. It also houses Custer Theatre where choir concerts and other functions take place. This building was almost completely destroyed by a fire on April 21, 1985. On the stairwell landing is a wooden stand with a bronze bust of Benjamin Franklin that is known for having paint rubbed off its nose due to students touching it. (College legend says doing so before an exam will bring good luck.) [citation needed]\n\nThe Franklin College Science Center is the newest facility on campus and is where most undergraduate science classes are held.\n\nThe Franklin College Graduate Health Science Center opened in 2018 and is where the college's master's programs are housed.\n\nJohnson Center for Fine Arts, called JCFA for short, was opened in 2001 and is where fine arts classes are held. School plays also are performed here in Theatre Margot.\n\nShirk Hall, constructed in 1903, houses the Pulliam School of Journalism, is home to the Indiana High School Press Association and to radio station 89.5 WFCI and The Franklin, the college's student-run newspaper.\n\nB.F. Hamilton Library has a 24-hour computer lab, auditorium, Academic Resource Center, Silent Study area (2nd floor), and Disability Services.\n\nOld Main and Shirk Hall were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.[4]\n\nElsey Hall is a predominately freshmen dormitory that has exclusively double rooms (with the exception of RA rooms, but others can use one as a single for a fee). Originally, it was the only all-female dormitory on campus. Elsey Hall is connected to the four Panhellenic suites belonging to the three (formerly four) sororities.\n\nHoover-Cline, two buildings connected by a glass tunnel and located in the center of campus, provides singles, doubles, and quads (exclusive to Hoover).\n\nJohnson-Dietz, for upperclassmen only, is two separate buildings and popular due to the residential suites with bay windows that are occupied by 3–4 people. Many on campus refer to it as \"The Sections\" because several suites are grouped in a particular section marked by a letter.\n\nDietz Center, for upperclassmen only, offers single rooms and suites. Popular for its environment, the attached Dietz Center for Professional Development building is also used for community purposes and houses offices.\n\nFour of the five active fraternities currently have houses and provide residence to their members. Two other homes on campus are themed. One is used as housing for students enrolled in the college's master's programs. The other is called the BOLD (Building Our Leaders Through Diversity) House, which aims to promote understanding and respect for multiculturalism and diversity and to provide intellectual, social and cultural programs focused on multicultural enrichment. The BOLD community was displaced from its house in Spring 2019, and the Living-Learning Community now resides in Section A of the Johnson-Dietz residence hall.\n\nFranklin College is a charter and current member of the Heartland Collegiate Athletic Conference in NCAA Division III. Originally, Franklin's athletics teams had no nickname. Due to the college's affiliation with the Baptist church, names such as “The Fighting Baptists” were used. One of the first documented uses of the name “Grizzlies” can be found in 1929. This name originates from the nickname of Ernest “Griz” Wagner. In the 1920s, Wagner coached the Franklin College basketball team known as the Franklin Wonder Five (1918–1926), after having previously coached the core of the team in high school. This combination won three consecutive Indiana High School Championships (1920–1922) and in the 1922–1923 season, the team won 50 consecutive games, defeating Purdue University, University of Notre Dame, University of Illinois, and University of Wisconsin.\n\nIn NCAA Division III football, Franklin College has a rivalry with Hanover College dating from 1898. Since 1938, the annual winner of the game wins the Victory Bell, hence the name of the game, the “Victory Bell Game.” As of November 2023, Hanover leads the series 46–43–3.\n\nThe football team, the women's lacrosse team, and both the men's and women's soccer teams play at Faught Stadium. This field is named for Stewart “Red” Faught. Faught coached football at Franklin College for 32 years (1956–1988) and acquired a record of 160 wins. One of his players, Terry Hoeppner, went on to become the head football coach for Miami University and Indiana University.\n\nMen's athletic teams include baseball, basketball, cross county, football, golf, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, and track and field. Women's athletic teams include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, volleyball, swimming and diving, and track and field.\n\nGeorge Banta, printer whose company is credited for designing multiple Greek crests, influential figure in development of Phi Delta Theta and Delta Gamma (the sorority's only male initiate)\n\nJoe Benigno, sports radio personality\n\nRoger D.
