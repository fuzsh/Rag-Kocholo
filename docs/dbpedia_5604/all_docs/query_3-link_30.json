Topics such as race, injustice and the Black experience comprise the Collection in efforts to encourage conversations of mutual respect. The collection's goal is to \"help Hoosiers think, read and talk about the diversity of perspectives and experiences in Indiana through fiction, non-fiction, poetry and films that represent the rich tapestry of stories present in our state and nation\" (Indiana Humanities, 2024).\n\nA joint collaboration of the B.F. Hamilton Library and the Center for Diversity & Inclusion, the Collection supports Franklin Forward’s throughlines and is made possible by the Indiana Humanities with funding from the Lilly Endowment, Inc.\n\nThe Collection is available on the library’s first floor. Print books, eBooks, and audio books are included, as well as streaming film and DVDs.\n\nHighlighted in the Collection:"
