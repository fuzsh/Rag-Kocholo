This collection comprises primarily film files of twenty-six completed as well as proposed projects including \"The Sound of Music\", \"West Side Story\", and \"The Haunting\". It also contains awards and ephemera, correspondence, personal papers and publications, and leather-bound scripts of thirty titles\n\nRobert Wise, born September 10, 1914, was an American movie director and producer, best known for such works as \"West Side Story\", \"The Sound of Music\", and \"The Haunting\". Wise grew up in Connersville, Indiana and went to school at Franklin College for journalism. After the Great Depression impacted his education, Wise left for Hollywood in 1933, where he began working at RKO Pictures in the film-shipping room. Wise moved up in rank, working as an assistant editor in the fields of sound, music, and special effects. By 1939, Wise had earned the title of editor on such films as \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" and \"My Favorite Wife\" and gained an Academy Award nomination for his work on \"Citizen Kane\". Wise also re-edited and directed a scene in the 1942 film \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" after RKO took over creative control from Orson Welles. Wise's official directing debut came in 1944 as a replacement director on \"The Curse of the Cat People\". Wise's last film for RKO was 1949's \"The Set-Up\". During the 1950s, Wise branched out to more genres, including science fiction, melodrama, and westerns. Beginning in 1959, Wise served as the executive producer on a large portion of his films. In the 1960s, Wise added yet another genre to his directing resume, proving competence amongst Broadway musicals with his film adaptions of \"West Side Story\", \"Two for the Seesaw\", and \"The Sound of Music.\" He also directed \"The Haunting\" in 1963, an adaption of Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House. In the 1970s, Wise directed such films as \"The Andromeda Strain\", \"Audrey Rose\", and \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\". After \"Star Trek\", Wise would go on to direct only two more films. Instead, he focused on other aspects of the film industry, serving as the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1984 to 1987 and sitting on the Board of Trustees of the American Film Institute. Wise was a four-time Oscar-winner (1961, \"West Side Story\" and 1965, \"The Sound of Music\"), as well as the winner of such accolades as the Director's Guild of America for outstanding lifetime achievement (1988), the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award (1966), and the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award (1998). Wise was married to actress Patricia Doyle until her death in 1975. In 1977 he married Millicent Franklin. He has one son. Wise died of heart failure on September 14, 2005, at age 91.\n\nProcessing Information: Collection was processed by Sarah Cassone in 2008\n\nAdvance notice required for access\n\n[Box/Folder# or Item name], Robert Wise papers, Collection no. 2295, Cinematic Arts Library, USC Libraries, University of Southern California\n\nAll requests for permission to publish or quote from manuscripts must be submitted in writing to the Cinematic Arts Library at ctlibarc@usc.edu.
