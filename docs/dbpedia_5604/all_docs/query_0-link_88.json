        "text": "The Story of Linda Bargmann\n\nI was born in Los Angeles County, grew up in Orange County, and then lived in San Diego County until 2000. I still love San Diego, where my daughter, son-in-law, and two grown grandchildren live in Escondido. My daughter boarded at Principia for a portion of her junior year (Dawn Schultz US ’95.)\n\nMy husband Clarence and I started our tax and accounting business as CPAs in 1982, the same year we started cruising, a favorite pastime for decades. After we retired, until March of 2020 when we had to shelter in place like everyone else, we cruised for a month or two or more at a time, all over the world. Clarence passed on in his sleep on a cruise ship in late 2022, and since then I’ve been cruising with my sister, Sandy Laurie (US ‘72.)\n\nAfter tax season in 1994, Clarence and I met a CPA who had just become a foster mom and quickly thereafter, our home was approved by California Department of Social Services, and we were asked to take a ‘placement’ before we had even finished the foster care classes to become licensed! We were new, so we believed the social worker when he told us, in September, that a temporary home was needed (for one to four months only) to cover an emergency. So, we agreed to foster a small, adorable two-month-old baby boy named Eddie for a couple of months! It’s a long story from there, but that’s the beginning of life with our son, Eddie Bargmann (US ’13, C ‘18.) You can find some details in a Christian Science Sentinel article titled “A Young Life Restored” in the CSS April 18, 2005, and an interview of Eddie in the CSS September 26, 2005.\n\nClarence and I provided a home and cared for a dozen foster children in California and Missouri, and then discovered that the younger of Eddie’s five siblings (by his birth mother) were in foster care in California. We met them, established strong relationships, and the long-term result was that two of those siblings graduated from Principia: Tiana Ismirnioglou (US ’18) and Nick Ismirnioglou (US’ 20, C ’24).\n\nI’ve been involved with Bible Study Seminars since the 1980s and am still active with Bible study. Since 2002, when the Mary Baker Eddy Library opened, I’ve been immersed in research on the culture of the Christian Science movement, with an emphasis on the Bible since 2008. When I retired from my job as Business Manager of Principia School in 2014, it gave me more time to pursue this hobby. Since 2012, Helen Mathis and I have given workshops at CS churches. In 2021, along with Shirley Paulson and Helen Mathis, I published a book titled An Annotated Bibliography of Academic and Other Literature on Christian Science, which has now expanded into a website.\n\nSue (Rice) and I dated for the last half of our senior year at Prin College. After graduation, I wanted to relocate back to the Bay area (where I went to high school and still had a lot of friends), and Sue’s family just happened to have moved next to the town where I had lived. So, Sue and I drove back to San Francisco after graduation. We stopped by Sue’s family ranch in northern Colorado on the way, and I got a taste of “ranch life.” I learned to have great deal of respect for those that work in ranching/farming in the process.\n\nSue grew up in an airline family (her father was a pilot), and Sue always wanted to be a flight attendant, so after applying and waiting, she joined United Airlines in January 1976, just after we got married.\n\nI began my career with General Electric Credit Corporation and was able to relocate to Barrington, Illinois to facilitate Sue’s assignment to United’s Chicago base. For the next three years, I found people to be wonderful but the weather not to my liking, so after a job change, we moved to Kirkland, Washington in 1980. Sue continued to fly for United (commuting to and from Chicago).\n\nIn 1983, we had our daughter (Kim), and our son (Rob) was born 1986. After a few interesting side jobs (stockbroker, accounting teacher at a technical school, and controller of a yogurt manufacturing plant), I joined NASD, a regulatory body that regulates stockbrokers and the firms that employ them in 1985 (now known as FINRA) and worked for them for 26 years as a special investigator. Sue continued to fly for United until she retired in 2012 after 37 years. She took over the running of her family ranch in 2004 and ran it until it was sold in 2010. She also helped start a community school in her spare time beginning in 1995.\n\nSome miscellaneous items: I had the opportunity to summit Mt. Rainier in 1985 and Mt. St. Helens in 1988. (I climbed with a 7 iron and hit a golf ball into the crater. If St. Helens blows up again, I might get my ball back!) I’ve also penned two unpublished books: “Growing Up in Heaven, a coming-of-age story in California” and “The Exciting Adventures of Stevo and Bozo.”\n\nSince retiring, Sue and I have had the pleasure of traveling to Italy, Alaska, Greece, England, Canada, and the great national parks of Utah to name a few. Sue loves to garden, and I enjoy golf and getting together with our children and five grandkids. We purchased a weekend get-away cabin 45 minutes north of Kirkland with 180-degree views of Puget Sound and close enough to the water to hear the whales breach and feed. We are looking forward to seeing all who attend the reunion and hearing all about your journeys since graduation.\n\nMy life has been blessed with a wonderful family and a satisfying career. I have also been grateful to experience Principia as a student, parent, staff member, and alumni.\n\nAfter College graduation, I received a master’s degree in public administration from Syracuse University. There I met my first husband to whom I was married for 12 years and we had a son, Jason, in 1980.\n\nMy work began in the Minneapolis suburbs in city government and then I worked in finance in four school districts in three states (Saginaw, MI, Mission Viejo, CA, Palos Verdes, CA, and Boulder, CO) and was the CFO in three of those districts. A highlight was successfully changing the CO state constitution regarding school finance through a citizen effort.\n\nAfter my first marriage ended, I met Kent Bilsborrow (C’71) at a Prin alumni event in Colorado. It was good sign that we recognized each other! We married about a year and a half later in 1991 and had a daughter, Laura, in 1994. Kent has a daughter, Kari, from his first marriage, and she is a year younger than my son.\n\nKent and I moved to St. Louis so I could work for Prin in financial administration for both campuses. I was honored to serve on the Principia Executive Committee. With a colleague, we co-founded a self-sustaining summer day care program at Prin to primarily benefit children of twelve-month employees, which continues today. I worked for Prin for almost a decade from the mid 90’s to the mid 2000’s. A physical challenge resulted in me resigning, and that challenge has since been overcome. I considered myself “early retired” and became involved in a variety of volunteer work. While we were in St. Louis, a group of about a dozen Lowrey gals from the 70’s met for breakfast every few months. It was a lot of fun!\n\nOur daughter attended Principia from Preschool through Upper School. She graduated from the University of Kansas as a D1 swimmer. She currently lives in Santiago, Chile and married a great Chilean guy, Osvaldo Guzman Santis, in October 2022. We have enjoyed traveling to Chile and spending time with them and his family. We hope Laura and Osvaldo will move to Denver metro sometime in 2024.\n\nAfter living in St. Louis for 16 years, we returned to Colorado and currently live in Broomfield, a suburb of Denver. At this time, I am involved with local policy and political issues as a volunteer, studying and practicing Christian Science, playing bridge, learning Spanish on Duolingo, and binge streaming movies and television shows. Kent is continuing his work as an investor in residential real estate. We are grateful that my mom, my son and my granddaughter Kennedy (7), and Kent’s daughter all live nearby. We look forward to seeing old friends and making new friends at the reunion!\n\nShortly after graduating, I drove to Boulder, Colorado to be a professional photographer under the name of BOLO’S PHOTOS. Things were going well until my professional camera gear was stolen and I did not have insurance. Big lesson learned.\n\nI moved from Boulder to Denver and signed on with IBM, with the knowledge that the largest computer company would not go out of business because they didn’t have insurance. While in Denver, I met Candy Cooper who was working for Adventure Unlimited. We both attended Sixth Church of Christ, Scientist, and in the spring of 1977 we married in her hometown of Cleveland.\n\nDiscovered that IBM stood for “I’ve Been Moved” and after being transferred to Colorado Springs, we purchased our first home at the base of Pikes Peak. We bought a Jeep that we named THE STUMP JUMPER and went camping, four-wheeling, hiking, and exploring the Rocky Mountains frequently. After moving another two times, I took a marketing position with an up-and-coming telecom company by the name of ROLM. I had the good fortune of working at the world headquarters of ROLM in Santa Clara, CA. In 1984, ROLM was acquired by IBM, so as you might have guessed, I had another move; this time to Tampa, FL.\n\nWhile serving as manager of major accounts for ROLM Florida, an IBM Company, we were blessed with a daughter, Jennifer, in 1987 and a son, Ben, in 1989. As those of you who have had children know, having children can certainly change your life; in this case, it was all good. In 1994, we made the decision to move from sunny Tampa to St. Louis, so that our children could attend Principia. I was doing the commuting thing for four months and then was able to secure a senior marketing manager position with Southwestern Bell Corporation, which was the telco for Missouri.\n\nIn 1995, I got back into coaching and spent almost every weekend at the soccer fields teaching boys and girls how to trap, pass, and shoot a soccer ball. My coaching of sports expanded into serving as an adult leader in the Boy Scouts of America. Even though there were multiple opportunities in the corporate world to relocate and move up the ladder to higher positions, I elected to stay in St. Louis, so that our children could develop grounded in the whole-man concept of character education at Principia.\n\nI took the early retirement package in 2002, which turned out to be a blessing in many ways. After retiring from SBC/AT&T, I acquired a pro-DSLR and several digital lenses and resurrected BOLO’S PHOTOS. I photographed and produced the “Principia Senior Slideshow” from 2006–2015, with a couple of years off for travelling.\n\nMy darling wife, Candy, experienced several strokes, and for the next four years, I served as her healthcare provider. I learned the hard way that being a full-time care giver can be stressful and tiresome. I had my own set of challenges to handle in November of 2016 and learned how short life can be. I’m happy to report that I pulled through, however, Candy passed away in November 2019. As we all know, covid presented challenges and was an opportunity to hibernate. Then in June of 2020, God introduced me to a lady that would help me turn the page and create a new chapter in my life. For those of you that will be attending our 50th Reunion this June, you will be able to meet Anna, who I am engaged to and hope to be married to by then.\n\nAfter graduation, I married Peter Brunjes in September 1975 and moved to Salt Lake City, UT where he finished his BFA at the University of Utah. During that crazy year, I substituted, worked as a teacher's aide (for $2.75/hour) and got a February contract to teach 2nd grade in a central city school. The kids had already had two teachers that year and it was trial by fire, but I loved it. We moved to Boston in the fall because I'd been accepted to Harvard Graduate School of Education for an MEd in reading and curriculum development. Our first son, Dylan, was born in October 1976 just after I began the program. I took a brief leave and finished my degree in June 1978, the same day our second son, Justin, was born. While attending school, I worked as a part-time security guard at The Mother Church.\n\nUpon graduation, we left Boston without much of a plan and eventually ended up back in Salt Lake City, where I had been offered a 1st/2nd grade split in a westside school. I taught another 13 years in the Salt Lake School District in various schools and levels. I was certified K–12 in biology and elementary education, added certification in English, gifted/talented and women's studies. When I finished my public school teaching career in 1989 to begin a PhD. in Rhetoric, Writing and Literacy Studies: The Cultural Foundations of Education at the University of Utah, I had taught every grade K–12 except kindergarten and 3rd.\n\nPeter and I divorced in 1992. I continued to work on my PhD and teach clinical supervision for teacher certification students. In 1995, I took the position of Director of Student Teaching at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, WA. The rain October–May was hard, but my position offered tuition waivers and both Dylan and Justin graduated from UPS in May 2000. I married R. Bruce Adams, who I met in a feminist theory class at the \"U,\" in 1997. He remained in SLC until 1998 and we commuted between Tacoma and Salt Lake for 3 years. Bruce moved to Tacoma in 1998 when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. We remained there until 2000 when I took a position as an English-education professor and Director of the Montana Writing Project at the University of Montana-Missoula where it didn't rain nearly as much. We lived a wonderful life just outside of Missoula until 2014 when Bruce died from complications associated with pancreatic cancer.\n\nI retired the following year and moved back to Salt Lake City with my two young border collies, Stella and Elvis. Dylan lives in Salt Lake with his wife, Shere, and my grandkids, Lucia (age 11) and George (age 9). Justin has been living in Switzerland since 2001. I get over to see him and his daughters, Ileana (age 19) and Anais (age 17) about once a year (except during Covid restrictions).\n\nI started knitting again once I realized I was going to be a grandmother--\"Heather Grosi\" to my grandkids (Grosi is Swiss German for grandmother). I manage to keep busy knitting, reading, walking my dogs Stella and Jackson (we lost Elvis last year), gardening, and skiing.\n\nIn the 1950s, I was born and raised in Ike Eisenhower’s hometown of Abilene Kansas. Small town with a big name. Wild Bill Hickock, Chisholm Trail, and Ike made a good foundation to build on.\n\nFall 1970, my freshman year at Principia was about meeting new friends from around the states and the world. It was the best starting point for many adventures and memories. My roommates were Elsbeth Krieg, Anderson East, and Yvonne Mortimer, South Africa, The French House. Some of my college buddies were Tanner Girard, Greg Linder, Lee Ames, Phillip Martin, Seth Leadbeater, and others. Fifty years ago, if you wanted to wear jeans to dinner you had to go between 5–6 to meet the dress codes in 1970s. I still remember tucking my bell bottoms into my boots and my Jane Fonda shag haircut.\n\nPrincipia is a very beautiful and special campus with well-designed and appointed buildings. My favorite Principia artifact is the large Henry B. Fuller’s 1910 painting “The Triumph of Truth Over Error” that still hangs in the Howard Center Concourse wall. ‘Truth Over Error’ is a great mantra to have.\n\nSummer 1971, Yvonne Mortimer and I started a new adventure with other Principia Upper and College females as tenants with Principia’s Upper School, Captain Robert Craig’s apartment house, 8th Street, Ocean City Maryland and we all were waitresses at Phillip’s Crab House. Recently published in Principia’s Purpose, former Capt. Craig started the Ocean City, MD Lifeguard program and was active for 50 years of service starting in 1920s. Kansas has oceans of wheat and Ocean City was my first experience on the other flat horizon of the Ocean. I love big skies and 360 horizons views.\n\nWhen I returned home to Kansas, I enrolled at Kansas State University’s College of Architecture and started my professional career 1977 back in Ocean City, MD with Loewer and Assoc. to work my way to Europe. After reading some of the Prin women alumni stories, they too had challenges in the man’s working world. When I became a registered architect in 1989, there were only 12 percent women and 9 percent black architects. Thirty-five years later, women only represent 24 percent of the registered architects. I will always be looking for a level playing field and a seat at the table. I was licensed as an architect in three states.\n\nIn 2003, after 40+ years in the design and construction industry for corporate, hospitality, and residential projects as a federal, state, and private Industry employee, I took early retirement to help my parents as their caregiver and property manager for their Carl Properties. After living and working in 12 different states, I tallied up my adventures outside of Kansas with only one-third of my lifetime and as a Kanas resident currently two-thirds of my life. I still design and construct and am proud as my parents’ legacy gardener. As Dorothy learned, “There is no place like Home!”\n\nI wish everyone a flower bouquet to give laughs and smiles with lovely memories and celebrations of their time at Principia.\n\nGive me an unending page and I will try to fill it!\n\nSomething that has provided significant food for thought for me of late, as an artist, poet, father, husband, little beam of living Love - is the idea of PROCESS vs PRODUCT!\n\nAnnabel and I are rewatching Northern Exposure on Netflix. In one episode the local philosopher/disc jockey (Chris) helps a friend (Holling) who is distraught. He completed over his a paint by number painting and was feeling so fulfilled and satisfied. When a friend insults it Holling is ready to give up painting. Chris advises Holling that his problem is that he is caught up in product over process. He encourages Holling to burn the painting as a means of releasing the product and thus focusing on appreciation of the process.\n\nI think the supreme and ultimate reality of being which we call God is likely into process and not product.\n\nOur process with Principia has been ongoing as our son Skylyr graduated in 2020. Our daughter Kyrstyn will graduate after this upcoming semester. Skylyr also spent a year at the Upper School, so we just haven’t been able to be away from the place.\n\nI look back on my own experience at Principia and realize that the south side of Chicago and a paycheck-to-paycheck life was very different from what seemed like a country club on campus.\n\nMy dad passed when I was 14. I really needed and cherished what Christian Science offered.\n\nI was pretty deep in process. Once at Principia, I realized that product could also be very attractive. Was that a distraction?\n\nThinking of my own experience at Principia, a cornerstone of my life has been found in Mary Kimball Morgan’s statement that, we all share the same vocation. We may have different avocations. But the vocation we share is to “come to a measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,” as Paul puts it.\n\nFollowing graduation I worked for a year with a graphic arts and advertising firm in downtown Chicago.\n\nI had gotten to know Chris Cole very well when he was teaching at Prin, we played a lot of tennis together, and I admired the fact that he had gone through the Chaplain Training program. So despite my focus to that point in fine art, creative writing, and zoology, the idea of growing in, and sharing, a deeper understanding of the truth of being sounded very appealing.\n\nI moved to Boston and worked as Foreman of the night shift in Security for about a year while awaiting results of my second application to the training program, which was only accepting one person per year.\n\nI married the very first love of my life, Alice Shultz, who awkwardly was the sister of my best friend Alan!\n\nAfter completing the three years of study towards a Master of Divinity degree I went on active duty in the Army. First to Fort Old in California. From there to Germany where I visited our nuclear field artillery units scattered throughout Bavaria. Never knew from day to day if a 17 year old German conscript in a Volkswagen Thing, Beetle, or Bus - or a civilian driver in an Opel sedan would be my driver to whichever Kaserne I was visiting that day to provide our soldiers with counseling and worship opportunities. We then moved to Fort Carson, Colorado.\n\nNot a bad string of assignments!\n\nI left Active duty after 10 years. I remained active in the Reserve and was a hospital chaplain at Brook Army Medical Center in San Antonio.\n\nI applied to be Assistant Administrator of a Christian Science nursing facility in Michigan. After interviewing they called to say that they did want to hire me, but that they hoped I would take the role of the Administrator. There went my on-the-job training! Since Alice was involved in a Master’s program we decided she would remain in Colorado to complete her degree and I would go to Michigan. Unfortunately, during that year and after 13 years of marriage, she came to feel she really needed time to discover herself and our marriage ended.\n\nI had a business in Colorado Springs marketing structural steel building materials.\n\nIt was then I met my enchanting, creative, energetic, child-loving, educator, soul mate, and spouse Annabel. We married in 1996.\n\nIn 1998 we awaited the birth of our son Skylyr with our midwives in our home in Colorado Springs. Everyone was so sure that Annabel was carrying a girl that when I caught Skylyr as he flew out, I found myself face-to-face with and overwhelmed with emotion as I stared into the face of our new baby daughter…or so I thought until one of our midwives said, “Okay, time to get him up on Momma!”\n\nI had opportunity to serve as First Reader of the Colorado Springs church and Annabel would remind me that Skylyr was there listening to the lessons on Sunday and Wednesday. That may be how he ‘caught’ my voice!\n\nWe then moved to San Diego where I was Administrator of the Christian Science nursing facility.\n\nLater, I was CEO of a not-for-profit in Grand Junction, Colorado.\n\nOn September 11, 2001 we awaited the birth of a new member of our family. Skylyr had come at about 2:30 a.m. and we anticipated that this new arrival would too. But Kyrstyn held-out until morning. I left Annabel and the midwives to go put Skylyr in front of Sesame Street with his breakfast, but when I turned on the TV there were the planes crashing into the World Trade Center towers. Kyrstyn was born kind of between the two strikes.\n\nWe suspected this might spoil this special day for us for all time, but it was soon clear that news of this little beam of light entering on a very dark day, this little beam of living Love entering on what might otherwise have seemed a loveless day, brightened that day for so many of our family and friends.\n\nVery soon after I had orders back to Active Duty. First Fort Benning, Geogia. Then Fort Lewis, Washington. Finally, Fort Hood, Texas.\n\nDuring those years the chaplaincy was an entirely different experience. We were an Army at war in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nI ministered to the families of over 80 soldiers killed in action; over 150 wounded in action; and to families and soldiers involved in the shooting incident at Fort Hood.\"\n\nI wrote a book after leaving Active service entitled \"Continue To Love.\" (Andre Christopher Cieply).\n\nWhen I retired in 2010 after this ten-year mobilization I realized it was like I had been running on a treadmill.\n\nAnnabel was able to spend 12 years as a home-schooling and stay-at-home Mom. Then she worked as a Parent Educator at Fort Hood. A Montessori 1st-3rd teacher in our public school system here in Holland, Michigan. And now as an Outdoor Preschool teacher in an 11 million dollar facility affiliated with he Outdoor Discovery Center!\n\nRetirement has allowed me to focus on being a dad, a husband, a return to being more of a full time practitioner of Christian Science, artist, poet, writer, thinker.\n\nBack to process instead of product.\n\nIt’s nice to be back!\n\nThough I do miss being able to walk into the dining hall in the Concourse and sit down with maybe a friend, maybe someone I’d not yet met. To be enchanted by the beauty of process in relationship. I sat in church not to long ago looking at “God is Love” on the wall behind the Reader’s desk. I Thought, “I wonder if there is a one word definition for exactly what Love is?”\n\nThe answer that came to me is “relationship.”\n\n“God is relationship” is I think, accurately another way of saying “God is Love.”\n\nMaybe that’s why we all have loved, and continue to love, Prin so much!\n\nSee ya lifelong loves!\n\nAfter graduating from Prin, I went back to London (where I had gone on a Prin Abroad) as I’d loved it there. The plan was to stay a maximum of one year, working in a CS Nursing Home – rooming with my good friend Jerri Barnes (C’75), who later married Dick Davenport. On arrival in London, we travelled to a CS Youth meeting, and on the second day in the country, I met my future husband, Pete Clay. We were engaged in three weeks and married in six months. What a wonderful man; we were married almost 47 years - he passed away in January 2023. We have a daughter, Ann, who is married and lives in Sydney, Australia with her husband and two children. Our grandchildren are now 16 and 13.\n\nDuring my last year at Prin, I took an international relations course with Dr. Collester; I found that it fascinated me. I followed up on that interest, and I got my Masters in that field from University of Southern California’s London programme.\n\nI also joined Shell International, where I worked for 25 years. The company offered me many opportunities and travel. My career there had four different phases: oil trading, international auditing, finance, and leadership of change. During that time, we lived primarily in the London area but also lived a few years in Germany and in Switzerland (where Betsy Slaughter-Olivera and I managed to get together). I travelled a great deal – work taking me to about 55 countries. Along the way, I got my management accounting qualification. Pete was self-employed (as a violin maker) which allowed us enormous flexibility of movement.\n\nI left Shell in 2004 in order to continue in the field of change leadership. I was part of a consultancy group, and became a partner, working with leaders in large organizations (based in a number of countries) who were going through significant change.\n\nDuring that time, we moved to Woodbridge, Suffolk in England – which is now home.\n\nOne of Pete’s passions was sailing, and I learned a great deal from him about that. We have a lovely gaff rigged yawl, about 33 feet long, called Nirvana. She’s about 100 years old and beautifully built of wood. Pete and I sailed together many years on her in the UK, Holland, and Scandinavia – with me being his crew!\n\nIn the last 20 years, Pete became very involved in the maritime aspects of Woodbridge and helped start a project along our waterfront. Have a look at Woodbridge Riverside Trust and also the Sutton Hoo Ship Company (who are rebuilding the Anglo Saxon ship buried at a place called Sutton Hoo). For those of you who have seen the movie, The Dig, with Ralph Fiennes – that’s the story of the ship being rebuilt in Woodbridge.\n\nSince retiring in 2014, I became part of this work too. My first project was to co-produce a theatrical opera of the Sutton Hoo story (took 3 years, but a fabulous and successful experience); it was called The King’s River. I knew nothing about theatrical work – but learned quickly! Subsequently, I have become a Trustee of Woodbridge Riverside Trust – and we have all sorts of activities, events and exhibitions in a building called The Longshed.\n\nChurch is an important part of my life, and I’m active in my local CS Society. I am also a CS Chaplain at a men’s prison, where I work every Monday in a Category B prison. I am a member of the Chaplaincy team and spend most of my time on the wings visiting prisoners.\n\nI love visitors and am so pleased that some of my Prin friends have found their way to stay with us over the years.\n\nMy husband and I met on a blind date. We've been married 48 years but have had only 12 anniversaries—but who's counting, anyway?\n\nWe started our married life together in Flint, Michigan. My husband started his 50+ year career in philanthropy, while I began my journey through life by starting 2 retail businesses within 6 years and closing both after 12 years. We had 5 house moves, several different jobs, and the adventure of a lifetime!!! ... But who's counting? First came a basement business named \"Diane's Designs\". This quickly became \"Seams Sew Nice,\" a retail sewing store with everything from sewing and knitting machines to specialty yard goods and laces, custom design services, and a ton of classes, all under one roof! The first of our four 'kids' (all Golden Retrievers) was spoiled by our customers and their husbands. Yes, we provided dog treats and free petting and kisses for all who entered our doors! A highlight of these years is having a picture in the Boston Globe featuring the late Catherine Keith wearing a custom piece at a Boston Ballet Gala.\n\nAfter 12 years, including a 4-year term as Flint's City Administrator (oh, the stories he can tell!), a new opportunity with a corporate foundation led us to Rochester, New York. I was accepted to study at RIT and The American School of Craftsmen, a part of their MFA program in the Fiber Arts area. This expanded my artwork to include machine embroidery, silk screening, and other handcrafts with wood and metal, as well as textiles/fiber arts.\n\nFortunately for us, Michigan called, and we returned to Michigan. Specifically, Traverse City, home of the richest Rotary Club in the world, where my husband found himself overseeing the renovated downtown hotel, along with 8 pumping oil wells and two charitable foundations. When not hosting Rotary Exchange Students, I returned to my family roots of working with metal (think furniture) at the local community college to create metal buttons, broaches, and boxes. An interesting commission came my way when I was asked to design a breastplate for the special Aaron's Robe worn by the local bishop during the Lent season. There was a special story in the regional newspaper about the garment. This period also included two summer sessions at the Haystack Arts Camp in Deer Isle, Maine. During our five years in Traverse City, we said goodbye to our first Golden Shailmar and added two more 'kids': Trillium and Honey!\n\nNext, we were on to Grand Haven, another \"lakeside\" town, for five years. This time, duties covered the whole state of Michigan and many trips to WDC. For the last 25 years, we have been in Grand Rapids, with better airport connections, better statewide access, and more friendly. We said goodbye to another Golden and welcomed our last ... Gracie!\n\nI returned to a lifelong interest in water—I taught infants to swim, was on the Michigan State University Synchronized Swim Team, and taught warm-water, gentle exercise classes to folks of all ages. A highlight was being certified as a Master \"Ai Chi\" instructor. Think 'T'ai Chi' done in water! The continual reward was seeing participants discontinue or reduce the use of medications and healed from the mobility challenge that introduced them to the class.\n\nAs Mrs. Eddy shares in the Glossary, we continue to be blessed - even in retirement - with daily Zeal - reflecting the animation of Life, Truth and Love - expressed in gardening, volunteering, travels, and supporting family and community.\n\nJune 1, 1975 Graduation from Prin College!\n\nJune 7, 1975 Married my Upper School sweetheart, Dee Coffer, in Houston. We moved into Univ. of Illinois married student housing units in Urbana on June 8.\n\nJune 9, 1975 Began classes to earn a Master's Degree in Library Science. My Prin College faculty advisor had strongly recommended I prepare for a career in libraries.\n\nJune 1976 Earned Master's Degree. We moved to Elsah. Could not find a library job at either the College or in nearby towns. I did get a job in the Prin College Bookstore as a cashier until February, when the Upper School called and asked me to start work on their campus. The Upper School librarian, Reba Lisle, decided to retire immediately. As I had a degree and knew the curriculum and most of the faculty, I filled the vacancy while candidates were interviewed. I was hired as the permanent librarian and started to earn a teaching certificate.\n\nJune 1977 Dee and I moved to St. Louis near the Upper School. Dee took classes in technical illustration and was hired by McDonnell Douglas Aircraft as the first female employee in their drafting department. I served the Upper School as librarian until 1999. Then I was hired as the Upper School principal. I retired from Prin in 2007. Dee and I enjoyed a cruise in Alaska for a week.\n\nOther important events during this time included parenting two wonderful daughters, Heather in 1980 and Sarah in 1982. They attended Principia from Preschool through Upper School. Sarah married in 2006 and moved to Boston. In 1981 I helped start a computer software company with six school librarians and a computer programmer, called CALICO. We worked on weekends, developing tutorial floppy disks for school librarians to use. The company closed in 2005. Also, we helped start the C. S. churches in Valley Park and O'Fallon, Missouri.\n\nAfter retirement from Principia, we moved to Buena Vista, Colorado. I heard about a new school starting up called The Link School, which describes itself on its website as: \"An alternative high school for students who are seeking an experiential education where Christian Science is lived.\" I was hired in fall 2007 and taught night classes in history until 2020. On the webpage is a quote from me: \"Teaching at Link has been a highlight of my long career. I deeply enjoyed the challenge of meeting the needs of several levels of students and celebrated the healings of academic limitations over the years. Link certainly lives up to its purpose.\"\n\nIn fall of 2008, I was hired full time at the BV High School as the middle and high school librarian. Dee fulfilled a dream and opened an art studio in Salida, our county seat. When I retired in 2020, we moved to Hot Springs Village, Arkansas, where we could enjoy painting lovely landscapes together with lower living expenses. Other important dates: grandson Sam born in 2013 in Boston, grandson Davy born in 2017 in Fort Worth, and Heather earning her PhD from the University of Missouri in 2019. She has lived in the Washington, DC area ever since.\n\nDee passed on in 2021. I lived alone in an empty house in a small town, attending church via Zoom. Sarah started researching retirement communities in Fort Worth. She found one called The Vantage. She encouraged me to visit the place, just minutes from her home. After a three-hour tour, I was sold. I moved in March 2023. I love living here! The 210 self-sufficient residents are happy, have fascinating life stories, and come from across the USA. I am one of the younger residents but have good friends aged 97. Meals are fantastic, classes and activities abound, and free transportation is provided for errands. My exercise options include water aerobics at a nearby YMCA several times a week, line dancing once a week, and helping to walk a neighbor's dog.\n\nP.S. This month I spoke with two women living in Fort Worth with CS backgrounds. When they asked my name, they smiled hugely. Both had attended Prin Upper School around 1980 and said I was a favorite teacher!\n\nGreetings to everyone! Gosh, I’ve been reading some of these submissions so far and wow, I’m impressed!\n\nAfter graduation, I went to live in Ridgecrest, California and worked as a secretary in the only civilian-run Naval base in the world, the Naval Weapons Center. First taste of desert life, and I loved the dry heat and constant sunshine. Met wonderful people and had a blast. A year later came back to Chicago and tried to put my French degree to use. Interviewed with a French bank, BNP, and got a job as receptionist. Loved it! A local crew from WTTW (public TV station) came by to film us as international banks had just been allowed to offer retail at the time. (My dream of working as a translator at the UN never panned out as I determined my level of French language expertise would be found wanting.) Got into retail banking through BNP, but eventually got hired by a private company to sell a collateral monitoring service to commercial lenders in 4 states. 7 years there as the only woman among 65 salesmen; I enjoyed it tremendously. (Remember what a big flirt I was?) Ha!\n\nMeeting so many commercial lenders led to being hired by a few banks to do commercial lending. One of them happened to introduce me to my future husband on his sailboat. We dated for a year and were married in June 1986. We lived in Chicago on the lakefront and got our own sailboat - 5 years of working all day, sailing evenings and weekends. It was glorious. I managed to get my master's degree in finance during 3 years of night classes and won the award for best business plan of the year, 1990. Walked down the graduation aisle 8 months pregnant - quite unusual back then! 2 children followed, Jessica (now 33) and Andy (now 31) and we decided to move to the suburbs for better schools. I gave up my career to be a full time Mom and was very active at their school activities including fundraisers and sports.\n\nFamily vacations were usually skiing or sailing - I came to love Deer Valley and sailing in the Indies. One memorable experience was going to Normandy with my dad and the immediate family (14 of us) to see where he landed at Utah Beach on June 6, 1944, and to meet up with a family he knew back then. Random French people paying homage to my dad and thanking him for their freedom were moments I’ll never forget. It was also fun being the translator at mealtimes and events.\n\nNow I’m very active in my local branch church and have worn all the hats. Trying to determine my next chapter: run an Airbnb in Tuscany? buy a place in France? Grandkids will be pulling me to stay right here, but I’ll keep dreaming.\n\nHi all-\n\nI can't believe it's been 50 years already. I just spent 2 hours reading those of you who have posted your \"bios\". It's funny even though I've seen many of you at several of our past reunions and have a rough idea of what you look like now, when I started to read each of the bios I would picture you in my mind as how I remembered you when we were at Prin. One of you mentioned how going to the reunions was a chance to get to know classmates now even though you didn't really hang out with each other during our Prin years, but still knew who we were. I agree wholeheartedly. I've found myself getting to know you now which has been nice.\n\nAfter I graduated Prin in 1974, I moved back home to NJ and still live there now. I worked at a few different jobs doing accounting. During those jobs I took courses towards my MBA at Montclair State and Fairleigh Dickenson. And with the intent of hopefully getting my CPA. However, I never graduated from either of those schools or got my CPA. But I did wind up having a great career in accounting with various corporate companies which included being department head in 2 of them. Then I decided to have my own bookkeeping business for 12 years for local small companies and did well with that. Finally, I settled into working for a school district board of education as an accountant. I also had a side business of doing people's tax returns and still continue to do that. I retired 3 years ago and don't miss working at all. I keep plenty busy.\n\nDuring this time, I met my husband at work at one of the corporations. We had 2 children, a daughter, Josie who's now 30 and a son, Wesly who is 28. Josie went to URI and FIT and with her last degree which was from FIT in graphic art design. She has a good job in Manhattan using her graphic art degree and lives in a cute, safe neighborhood in Brooklyn. Wesley is still living at home and earning a degree online.\n\nAlso, we took a vacation to Costa Rica in 2010 and fell in love with the country and wound-up buying land and building a house in 2011 and we currently rent it out. For any of you who have ever been to Costa Rica, we're about 15 minutes from Arenal Volcano, on the safe side.\n\nI've done a bit of traveling over the years. Italy, England, Scotland, Egypt, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic. I've stayed in touch with Gail Woods Johnson, another alumni from our class of '74. We see each other a couple of times a year and only live about an hour and a half from each other. She and I have had a number of adventures together over the years. She's the reason I got to Egypt and England as she was living there because of her husband's job. And I stay in touch with other alumni via phone or texting.\n\nI’m attaching a photo of Gail and I from our visit to their vacation home in NY state and a photo of my husband, Jim on the left and Gail’s husband, Peter on the right. And a photo of me and my daughter from today while we went strawberry picking.\n\nI'm really looking forward to seeing everyone again at our reunion.\n\nLove to you all\n\nRobin Headley Florance\n\nAfter graduation from Prin in 1974, I enrolled in a Biology master’s program at the University of Central Florida in Orlando. I had both teaching and research assistantships, but still lived with my parents since in those days we had to pay tuition out of our assistantship salaries. I also spent six months as a concrete worker, which included forming and pouring a bank vault. I graduated with a Master of Science degree in March 1976.\n\nFrom May to August 1976, I was a laborer (choker-setter, drilling technician, powder monkey, grade-setter, chain saw operator, general cleanup) for a construction company in Oregon building logging roads in the National Forests. On August 14, 1976, Suellen Hill (C’76) and I were married in Salem, Oregon, with many Prin friends in attendance. After a honeymoon on the Oregon coast, we packed everything in my Volkswagen van and drove to Tallahassee, Florida where I was enrolled in a Ph.D. program in Science Education. Suellen walked into the Early Childhood Education Department after we arrived and talked her way into a teaching assistantship in the master’s program even though we were far past the application deadlines.\n\nSuellen completed her master’s in early childhood education, and I finished the coursework for my Ph.D. in Science Education before moving to Elsah in June 1977. The Ph.D. was awarded in 1979 after completing my dissertation. I began a professorship in the Principia College Biology Department upon the retirement of Doc Wanamaker and taught a variety of biology and environmental science courses for 15 years. I also taught a Biology Abroad course in Mexico, Guatemala, and Costa Rica. Our daughter, Anne, was a home birth in Hitchcock Terrace apartment in 1978. Our son, Justin, was born in Jerseyville in 1981. Suellen helped organize a babysitting coop while the kids were young. She was a part-time career counselor at Prin College for several years and served as the first president of the Staff Senate. For several years we were a dorm family living in Gehner House.\n\nWe took advantage of Christmas and summer breaks to travel with our kids during our years at Principia, including trips to Europe, Mexico, Central and South America, New Zealand, Australia, and Fiji. The most adventurous trip was driving to Guatemala from Illinois in summer 1988 with Anne (9) and Justin (7). I taught a field ecology course at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala. Suellen taught kindergarten in the bilingual American School where our kids were enrolled for the summer.\n\nDuring my Prin College teaching years, I was active in numerous local and state environmental organizations. Roles included serving as vice president of the Illinois Environmental Council and president of the Illinois Audubon Society. I was appointed by Illinois Governor Jim Thompson to the Illinois Nature Preserves Commission in 1987, where I served for seven years, including three years as elected chairman. In 1992, Governor Jim Edgar appointed me to a three-year term as a member of the Illinois Pollution Control Board which required an affirmative vote by the Illinois Senate. The appointment was full-time, so I resigned from Principia College. I was honored to receive subsequent appointments from Governors Edgar, Ryan, Blagojevich, and Quinn, and I retired from the Board in 2012. The Board is responsible for writing environmental rules across all media (quasi-legislative) and acts as an environmental court (quasi-judicial) with appeals of Board decisions going directly to the Illinois Appellate Courts. During my 20 years at the Board, I spent six years as chairman and served a short stint as the first executive director of the Board.\n\nSuellen was a kindergarten teacher in the Alton, Illinois schools before being promoted to district curriculum coordinator. She completed an education specialist degree at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville and a Doctor of Education degree at Saint Louis University. She was appointed assistant superintendent of the Jacksonville, Illinois school district and subsequently served as superintendent of school districts in Havana, Morton Grove, and Morrison, Illinois. She retired in 2014 to pursue her fabric art passions from our home in Morrison, Illinois. Our other retirement activities include underwater photography, canoeing, fishing, kayaking, golf (Tanner), and visiting our four grandkids.\n\nI’m watching a pair of woodpeckers and their ‘teenager’ outside our breakfast window as I consider all of the riches that life has held for me since finishing at Principia. Back then, I could not imagine the joy of holding our own offspring, then watching them grow into productive, loving, & giving adults—nor the busyness of feeding, clothing, nurturing them along the way.\n\nAs some of you may remember, Watson consumed a lot of my time in college. Afterwards, I did some graduate work in geology at University of Houston. The oil industry was booming then & I left UH early to work at Pennzoil. I gained the notoriety of being the first woman to ‘sit a well’ for Pennzoil, a bit late for that company. Those adventures took me to onshore wells first, then eventually to an offshore well. Now, how you get out there is its own story. Suffice it to say that I had my first helicopter ride & first lift on a tall crane.\n\nSometime in there, Jim and I met. He worked at Texaco & we were both in downtown Houston. Lots of lunches together! We married in the Spring of 1977. I continued at Pennzoil, then had 9 months at Natomas North America until 1982. As anyone who was in Houston then remembers, that was a tumultuous year in the oil patch. For me, it was also momentous: I was promoted to ‘Mom.’ Just as the oil industry went south, we welcomed our son. I did work a bit part time, before our first daughter joined us in 1985. Both were students at The Branch School and I was asked to teach a hands-on math program there. Very part-time, but I discovered my love of teaching.\n\nIn 1987, Tenneco transferred Jim to Oklahoma City. Our third child joined us there shortly afterwards. No more job, but was I ever BUSY! I can relate to those parent birds carefully feeding those little ones as they learn to fly. I’ll cut out a few details of that wonderful time, but Tenneco got out of the oil industry & we moved back to Houston. By our son’s third grade year, I was looking for something different for our kids’ education. A good friend and I were given a chance by The Branch School for an experiment in project-based learning. Four of our children—first through fourth graders—comprised most of our class that year. That converted garage of an old house became our laboratory for exploring the world—lots of field trips, experiments, and writing, writing, writing. It was crazy challenging, but it was the beginnings of great things for our children and the start of growth for TBS.\n\nNext chapter: we enrolled our children at Principia Upper School and Middle School in 1999. I moved to St Louis so they could be day students, but Jim stayed with his job, now at a subsidiary of Shell, in Houston. That is one long commute! But Jim & Linda Lindeman were doing the same thing, so the two Jims joined forces, conquering that commute together. 2001 hit us hard as Neil passed on October 1st. It helped me to be busy working on the first Wooly Mammoth Dig at the College in 2002. As you probably know, our mammoth class discovered that there was a whole mammoth buried in the loess near Rackham. Stephanie graduated in 2003, then continued at the College. We moved the household back to Houston in 2003 and Kristin finished as a boarder in 2006. She then went to Trinity University in San Antonio. Something in their education must have clicked: Dr. Stephanie is an engineer, happily working at Draper in Cambridge, MA. She and our Grand-dog Dixie live in Medford, MA. Kristin did a 9-year stint as an officer in NOAA Corps and walked for her Masters in Energy Policy & Climate at Johns Hopkins three weeks ago. She and her husband Lutfi live in Granite Falls, WA, with our five Grand-cats.\n\nSpeaking of Kristin & Lutfi: When we met him in Kauai, HI, I got to have my next helicopter ride. He is a flight instructor!\n\nWe’ve been here in The Woodlands, TX for a bit over 20 years. I tutored math and science for a dozen or so years. I finally went back to school for that other interest & got my teaching certificate. I finished up ‘work’ teaching math & science at a small gifted-and-talented school near where we live. When I decided to leave, I was asked if I would come back to teach Earth Science in a couple of years. Well, the school gave me a big block of time to do. My ‘Swan Song’ was a very involved geology lesson for my students—great fun for me and I think they liked it, too.\n\nEnough about work. I’ve also been a Sea Scout leader here for the twenty years we’ve been back in the Houston area, teaching sailing to young adults, 14-20. We’ve taken youth down the coast a couple of times and sail fairly often closer to home. Our biggest adventure was a bare-boat charter & SCUBA trip to BVI. Jim puts up with my feeding my desire to sail, often going to the lake to work on boats with me as well as crewing on them for daysails. I often regretted that I did not get to teach our own girls to sail, but they found their own ways to the water. Kristin went to Hawaii as a SCUBA instructor, met Lutfi there, and joined NOAA, working aboard their research vessels or at their marine sanctuaries. Stephanie spends her days off kayaking the coasts of Maine & Massachusetts, unless she’s off mountain biking somewhere.\n\nGoing full circle as life often does, Jim is on the board for The Branch School. We are both active in our branch church, the one we each joined before we were married, a long time ago.\n\nEven with it’s twists & turns, ups and downs, life is a grand adventure! I’m grateful for our many friendships that started way back at Principia College and continue to this day.\n\nDear friends, I am sorry to miss the 50th Reunion this year. A family obligation changed my plans.\n\nSince graduating from Prin in 1975, I have led a life filled with inspiration, changes and unexpected opportunities.\n\nThe current basics are my wife is Ann Gready Westerman, widow of Bill Westerman (C’74). We live in Bethesda, MD and are members of Fifth Church in Washington, DC.\n\nMy late wife, Linda Melvin Hanson (USx70) and I raised two wonderful children, Heather and Jeremy. They are both married. I have 3.84 grandchildren (#4 expected in early August). Heather lives nearby and we see her sons, ages 6 and 4, frequently. Jeremy lives in Dedham, MA and we see his daughter, age 2 1/2, and will see her sister (due in August), on frequent trips to Boston. Both Heather and Jeremy are well educated, independent, successful in their vocations, active in their respective communities, homeowners and parents. They are experiencing all of the challenges that they caused their mother and me when we were young parents, and I just empathize and smile.\n\nFor 43 years, I have worked as a financial advisor and a Certified Financial Planner (CFP). I founded a team at Wells Fargo Advisors almost fifteen years ago. My daughter, Heather Hanson-Rivas, CFP, now leads the team, Clark-Hanson Wealth Management. I listen and offer advice sparingly.\n\nI am active in a number of community organizations. I continue to serve in our branch church, Scouting USA (Boy Scouts), the local Rotary Club and its foundation, and The Rotary Foundation.\n\nSince a 2011 Rotary trip to Ecuador to improve rural education, I have been increasingly interested in working with The Rotary Foundation and partnerships of Rotary clubs, on building programs and schools to help indigenous girls stay in the educational system and improve their own and their villages’ prospects. This last Spring, we expanded our focus to include adult basic literacy and math instruction with two new schools in the Bengal area of India, and we just started rebuilding two elementary school in the Kharkiv and the Dnipro areas of the Ukraine. Because of the war damage, new desks, tables, chairs, blackboards, whiteboards, electronics and printers were necessary. Over a year ago Rotarians and the Organization of American States, started developing a pilot project to bring education to a handful of mountain villages in Guatemala whose primary language is a Mayan dialect. The purpose is to create economic opportunities which will encourage the residents to stay in their village and not crowd our Southern US border. We just received all the necessary approvals to open at the end of summer for over 1600 middle school age girls. In addition to basic education, they will be taught to become land surveyors and will be employed during next summer’s break. Previously, they would have been forced into marriage as early as age 11.\n\nI also am a farmer, owning with my brother, Tim Hanson (C’80) over 400 acres in Boyds MD. This year the farm is raising corn, alfalfa hay and mixed hay, as well as a small herd of Angus (beef) cattle. Tim is the lead in this project. Our previous family farm was mainly a cattle operation supported by hay we grew and baled, and we provided all the labor. Not anymore. We have workers carrying out the grain and hay operations and watching over the cattle operation. Prior to our purchase of this farm, the previous owner neglected the agricultural potential. Brother Tim and I believe raising grains – corn, wheat, soybeans and beef cattle will be a successful combination, but we still have a lot of preparation, restoration and building before we reach that point.\n\nMy life experience has changed greatly in the last seven years. Within the span of one month my son and daughter each had a wedding. Both married wonderful, bi-lingual US citizens with families in South America. My wife of almost 38 years, Linda Melvin Hanson (USx’70), passed suddenly while we were on vacation; my father passed in 2019 and my brothers and I sold the family farm and funded a Charitable Foundation; I replaced myself as The Mother Church’s representative and chaplain to Scouting USA (Boy Scouts of America), a position I had first accepted in 1997 with two weeks' notice; I downsized and sold my home to my niece, Rachel Hanson (C’15), and married Ann Westerman. My newest personal project is to build a home on the farm. Life continues to offer unexpected and inspired opportunities.\n\nShortly after graduating with a Business major from Principia, I moved to Wichita, Kansas, and married Jim Garvey, a Prin graduate (’72). We had 3 sons. The oldest also graduated from Prin College and is here this weekend for his 25th reunion!\n\nOn April 26, 1991, a tornado (F5) tore through our home while our 3 children and I were in the basement. Many lessons were learned: 1) “things” don’t matter; people matter; 2) God is a very present help in trouble; 3) “God, I’ll do what I can, but You will have to do the rest.” Blessings abounded! We moved to a home closer to town and our schools.\n\nAfter divorcing amicably, I started ballroom dancing. I LOVE ballroom dancing!!\n\nIn 1999, I married Richard Haskins and we moved to Tallahassee, Florida, then Ocklocknee Bay, FL, then Carrabelle, FL. We enjoyed the profits of buying and selling houses in that rapidly soaring market. During this time, Richard and I became commercial fishermen in the Gulf of Mexico. I was the captain and he was the pilot of the “Miss Dee Marie,” a lobster-style boat built in Canada. Although our licenses were for grouper, snapper, and mackerel, we primarily fished for grouper and red snapper.\n\nDuring the month of January, commercial fishing in the Gulf of Mexico is not allowed, so we went to Costa Rica. Over the next few years, we kept returning frequently to Costa Rica. We bought, built, and sold several real estate properties in a few years.\n\n2004 was the year of the hurricanes in Florida. Between August 13 and September 25, the 2004 hurricane season brought four back-to-back hurricanes — the worst in Florida's history: Hurricanes Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne.\n\nWe were in Kansas when Ivan started heading toward our home. Richard wanted to go on a road trip northward, so I told Richard I would go back to Florida, get the house ready to weather the storm, and I would evacuate to wherever he was at the time. He was in Billings, MT, when I evacuated, and I flew to Montana. While driving around, we looked at houses, because that’s what we do! We found one in Noxon, MT – “Log home on 42 acres for sale!” After selling our house in Florida (which weathered the storm fairly well), we moved to Noxon, MT, for 12 years.\n\nWhile in Noxon, MT, I worked as a bookkeeper in various places, including a commercial cabinet shop. When the position of School Clerk opened up, I applied and got the job. The Clerk responsibilities covered 3 schools serving 3 towns: payroll, health insurance, budgets, paying all bills, Secretary for the School Board, contract negotiations, audits, accounting for 21 school funds, etc. It was the most challenging and rewarding job I ever had!\n\nIn 2015, wildfires required us to evacuate for a couple of weeks. Our home survived, but after 12 years of living in Montana, our grandchildren started to be born back in Kansas. So, we moved back to Kansas! In August of 2023, we sold our home in Derby, lived in an RV for 7 months, traveling (and fishing) in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana. We found a home in El Dorado, Kansas, by the El Dorado Lake State Park, and moved here in April 2024.\n\nI have 3 sons, 2 stepsons, two daughters-in-law, and 4 grandchildren. We enjoy seeing them quite often!\n\nLife is Good!\n\nDear Bucky’s,\n\nA catch-up in one page or less.\n\nI graduated from Prin in 1975. During my Junior year, I met the love of my life Liz, at a Christmas Party for area Christian Scientists at her house in Akron, Ohio. She caught my eye, and heart, and after a series of ups and downs, we married in 1977. I was, at that time employed as a foreman at my Dad’s start-up landscape company. Fortunately, I had extracted that promise “for better or worse” early on, so all was well. During this period, I operated dump trucks, bulldozers, backhoes, Bobcats, trenchers, rollers, farm tractors, and forklifts, and we built brick walks and patios, seawalls, and railroad tie walls.\n\nI then made a U-turn into commercial banking, picking up an MBA and, strangely, four sons, over a 15-year period. Another sharp turn for 6 years as a corporate treasurer, which I found meant doing all the stuff no one else wanted to do. Just after the Millenium moment, went into commercial loan brokerage, then after a three-year shift into house flipping, then back into commercial consulting and business brokerage, with a soupcon of real estate. I have managed dozens of employees, turned around failing enterprises, and I have shown owners how to revive their businesses. All very satisfying.\n\nAlong the way, I have served in every position in a branch church, and also as an Assistant Scoutmaster (I’ve taken 20 boys into the wilds and returned with all of them). I flew as an observer on one mission with the Lee County Mosquito Control District in one of their vintage DC-3s at treetop height, and I have flown in a T-34 Mentor, a Cessna 172, a vintage Stearman biplane trainer, and a Piper Cub.\n\nI have traveled from Maine to Los Angeles, from Seattle to Southern Florida. I have visited Quebec and San Juan. I have lived in Ohio, Illinois, Maryland, and Florida. I have paddled a canoe through mysterious Buck Key behind Sanibel Island in Florida, and I have climbed to the top of Cadillac Mountain at Acadia National Park in Maine through the fog. I once hiked into Redwood National Forest to the Grove of the Giants and touched the tallest tree in the world. I have lived in houses, hotels, and tents for weeks at a time. I can cook a stir fry meal in 30 minutes, and I can change a diaper and rock a baby to sleep.\n\nI remain delightfully in love with my wife of 47 years, and immensely proud of my four grown sons and their families. Cora, a Golden Retriever rescue joined us on New Year's Day, 2020.\n\nMy hobbies include gardening at our home in Dayton, Ohio, and I am a member of the Society of Miniature Ship Collectors. Liz and I do the NYT daily games together.\n\nSome of my happiest memories are my years at Principia and Buck House.\n\nHeaven in the Rockies\n\nShortly following my June 1974 Prin College graduation, I spent my fifth summer of wonder at the Adventure Unlimited (A/U) ranches near Buena Vista, CO. I say ‘wonder’ as I at times wondered if I didn’t grow more as a person during my summers there than the high school boys in my cabin did.\n\nBesides serving as a resident staff musician and bunkhouse counselor, my primary responsibility as a program staff member was teaching my two-hour Non-Visual Perception (NVP) class twice a day. It was a structured class that required each of the 30 signed-up campers to dawn a blindfold for the duration of the class. In each class session, two non-blindfolded kids kept wary eyes on the participants to prevent any cheating or peeking. In a sentence, my NVP seminar took one’s ‘eyes’ out of the “boy meets girl” equation to begin ingraining upon those participating teenagers the fact that there is SO much more than meets the eye through two hours of nonvisual interaction— something with which I am quite familiar . . . even today.\n\nDuring the four summers I taught my NVP seminar at the ranches, the flow of thank-you notes from parents at summer’s end was gratifying indeed. Now if we could only teach adults the same perception techniques!\n\nSpeaking of relationships, the summer of *’75* was an eye-opener for me. I began my first Roundup Hi-Stampede session that summer, praying to God to bring a special gal into my life; after all I was in my mid 20s by then and almost never been kissed! Naturally, I had met a number of gals I was attracted to at Prin but not vice versa. And even when I met the Tucson, Arizona high school grad during that first week at the ranches in 1975, I was not impressed with her whatsoever!\n\nStephanie Eckman was in my first NVP class that summer. She came across as your typical teenage girl with low self-esteem and no luggage! Seriously! Continental Trailways lost her luggage enroute to the A/U ranches! So, with most of her camp wardrobe ‘missing in action,’ her participation in many camp activities was rather restricted—like swimming, horseback riding, whitewater rafting, mountain climbing and rock-climbing—the first several days. So, she signed up to assist my NVP class.\n\nThere’s a bit more to this story that includes Stephanie’s first-ever butterflies later that week; my giving her a promise ring that November; her royal treatment by my family at her first Christmas visit to our Escondido, CA, home; proposing to her on Valentine’s Day 1976.\n\nThere’s more—but I don’t have the space nor you the time. Suffice to say, a year after we met, our long-distance romance culminated into a wonderful marriage that will have endured 48 years as of August. 28, 2024.\n\nStephanie and I are registered to attend the College reunion this June. How ‘bout you?”\n\nhap@therainreport.com\n\nAfter getting an Illinois Teaching Certificate through Principia, I found I needed several additional courses before teaching outside of Illinois. For example, Texas history was required in Texas, and an entire year of courses before or during teaching in California. (Bummer, Dr. Fennell!)\n\nAfter an unfortunate interview with a principal in a Houston school, I decided that learning to run around a desk from him was not my idea of a good working environment!\n\nWhile I started in on these courses, I taught junior high students at a small, Christian Science school in northern California. It was the opportunity my teacher advisors would have jumped to have: no textbooks, no supplies, no filmstrips or maps, no outline to follow or required courses. Proposition 13 had closed all the public schools, so small, private schools were popping up in backyards, church yards, and closed wings of public schools. I went to textbook auctions and found class sets of history, science, math books, and English workbooks, but none of the teacher books with the answers! I used up my salary at the teacher resource store!\n\nMy father would close every phone call home I made saying, “Just remember, I’ll pay double your salary to come work for me!” The little school was closing, so I took his offer. I’d grown up with our family’s oilfield service business, so this was an exciting step into business that was based on solving problems with science. I got an MBA to help with the business aspect and took corrosion engineering courses to help understand the downhole environment. I gave talks at different corrosion engineering seminars on monitoring corrosion in the downhole environment with sweet gas and/or hydrogen sulfide and had to walk the line between keeping our engineering secrets under wraps and yet answer questions designed to reveal our methods.\n\nAll the things I liked about teaching I got to do, without worrying about the classroom management difficulties! I built training programs, complete with pictures and customer testimonials. I ran around the world with my slideshow and corrosion samples in my briefcase. I spoke at Shell Headquarters, Den Haag, in Phillips complex at Stavanger, Norway, Flopetrol offices in Germany, France, Brunei and Kalimantan. I met one customer skiing in Austria! On each of my four trips to Japan I learned at least one of the cultural gaffs I’d made on the last trip. In New Zealand, I had to rent my own car, because the Shell, BP, and Todd Oil Company didn’t allow women to drive company cars.\n\nIn each country, it became harder to prove my worth as a “woman in a man’s world.” Some of the perfectly nice men I met could not or would not believe that I was offering them good information.\n\nAfter several tech jobs in the newer fields of telephony and computers (ROLM, AppleTV) and coursework to get acquainted with the different fields, I took my original interest in using images for training programs back to education. I worked for textbook publisher Addison-Wesley, and then Scott Foresman Addison Wesley, as their multimedia producer. At last, I got to create the resources that teachers love to use in the classroom: videos, laser discs, CD Roms, and later DVDs and computer online lessons, to illustrate a concept or tell a story within the content of the textbooks.\n\nThese were transferable experiences for use in my next role as director of learning technologies for the second largest county in California, the Santa Clara County of Education, with 32 districts and over a quarter-million students, and more than 58 different languages spoken by the students. Suddenly I had 8 television channels to fill with content, a coveted afterschool hour on the local PBS station, and an un-integrated network of computer technology contacts in the schools.\n\nTeachers are a tough audience. They’ve been battered by salespeople who leave them with a closet of new devices, but no consistent way to use them in the classroom. I’ve seen computers used as doorstops, and smart boards used as coat racks. With the introduction of content standards for math and English, and the California High School Exit Exam (CAHSEE), teachers were given known values to achieve with their students. Science and History came later.\n\nI created five TV series to help:\n\nMath Mentor was a televised phone-in help line where students called our tv station for help with their homework from some of the most popular math teachers in the schools.\n\nThe Math Squares Tournament used practice test questions from the High School Exit Exam to have two high school teams compete to play tic-tac-toe on camera.\n\nWriters’ Workshop, for grades 7 and 8 to spotlight students using correct grammar, sentence structure, and descriptive writing to a prompt.\n\nHistory Hunters for grade 5, which covered the history standards of geography, US states and capitols, famous people and events.\n\nSilicon Valley High, a series designed to spotlight teachers using technology in the classroom. It won a national award, and was broadcast to 24 PBS stations around the country.\n\nAs an educational video producer, I’d produced several training videos for other clients, notably a series for an online class in palliative nursing care for the California Health Care Foundation.\n\nMy most recent undertaking is VerifyIt! (playverifyit.org ) an online civics game for high school students through the League of Women Voters of Alameda. It promotes civic action by helping new and prospective voters evaluate news items and social media posts for disinformation, awareness of specific voting rules in different states, and a crash course in applying the Constitution to challenges in their daily lives.\n\nI’m also active as program chair in a group called Mended Hearts. As a heart patient, I’ve been able to put my skills to use to create Zoom videos of our monthly educational programs.\n\nI never graduated from Prin. After 2 years at Prin, my dad lost his job, so my brother, Ken, and I were on our way home to southern California. I spent a year working in Newport Beach as a carpenter, and rooming with Dick Gude (and my amazon parrot) in Costa Mesa. Those were fun times, except when Dick was trying to get the parrot to talk, and it bit him in the lip. Ouch!\n\nAfter that short stint, I went back home to the San Fernando Valley, and graduated from Cal State Northridge. Soon after graduating, I got married, and we lived in the Northridge area for a couple of years, before moving to San Jose, CA. I worked in the construction industry, selling doors, frames & hardware for commercial buildings. It turned out the Bay Area kept me very busy, since it was home to Google, Apple, Facebook, and more, all building like crazy.\n\nIn the meantime, the family grew. In 1981, Jared was born. He's now a California State Park Ranger, and he has a beautiful wife, and 2 very active sons (7&5). In 1984, Arianne was born. She and her husband are now very busy raising the cutest daughter and a new son (2-1/2 & 3 months). In 1989, Reese was born. He's now an artist, doing pottery in the San Francisco Bay area, and living with his beautiful girlfriend and their dog.\n\nI got divorced in 2009, but life goes on. I retired in 2018, and still live in San Jose. Retirement suits me just fine, I love it. I got the travel bug when my sons studied in Italy and Germany. That was the perfect opportunity to go and visit them. There are so many interesting places to see, but not enough time to see them all. I love to travel, play pickleball, ice skate, and rollerblade. I now volunteer at a local art studio, teaching blacksmithing, which is a lot of fun. I also volunteer at the Tech Museum (now the Tech Interactive), showing visitors the exhibits.\n\nAs I mentioned before, life goes on. Last year, in a yoga class, I met my girlfriend, and we've been very happy ever since. Life is good!!\n\nI'm looking forward to the reunion and can't wait to see old friends (and I do mean old). 50 years, I can't believe it.\n\nEpilogue: I really wanted to see everyone at the reunion, but alas, it didn't happen. Last week, I broke my hip from a fall while rollerblading. The surgeon put in 3 pins, and I'll be in rehab for 5 more days. I'm so bummed to miss all the fun. I'd love to see photos, so if you don't mind sending some, I'd appreciate it. Text to: (408) 605-3532. Thanks, and enjoy your week together.\n\nHere is a bit of the adventure I have been on.\n\nWhen I graduated early from Principia I went home to Lake Almanor, California and studied jewelry making and stone faceting before heading to Cranbrook Academy Of Art for an MFA in painting. While there I was able to take classes from the Metalsmithing department and learned how to forge and raise a copper bowl from sheet metal. So much fun. Returning home I taught college art, continued to study jewelry making and got a GIA degree in gemology. Yes, my college degrees in fine arts and geology did work together.\n\nAfter working for a couple of years and saving enough money to buy a car, I decided instead to take a trip around the world (four months by myself, but with God) buying gemstones from the source. The highlights of that trip were Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Indonesia.\n\nUpon my return I took classes in diamond setting in Portland OR where I met my future husband. He was an Iranian graduate student and had been able to get out of Tehran on the last flight before Ayatollah Khomeini landed. It was the Iranian revolution. We moved to Philadelphia while he worked on his graduate degree in urban planning, and I worked as a diamond (gemstone) setter.\n\nThe next adventure was thirteen years in Sacramento, CA, where my husband and I had a fine jewelry business and an art gallery. I was also still painting. There, we also received state arts grants to write and illustrate three children’s books.\n\nOur daughter Roya was born in 1993, and we decided to close our jewelry business and art gallery, as Iran seemed open enough to move there to live. My husband taught at the university, and I taught English as a second language and painted. Living in Iran was lovely, and we flourished. Our son Dara was born during the five years we lived in Iran.\n\nTo support Dara, who had been diagnosed with a developmental disability, it seemed right for me and the children to move back to California. My husband spent six months teaching his university classes in Iran then six months with us where he could write and support his graduate students remotely. This was the pattern of our life until he passed on in 2014.\n\nIn California, I taught college art and art in elementary schools and decided to get my elementary teaching credential. We then moved to Hawaii to support my mother, and I taught Kindergarten.\n\nWhen My husband passed on, I stopped teaching and thought that I would go back to painting, but God made it clear that the next right step was to go into the CS practice. In the last couple of years, one way God has been speaking to me so clearly has been through poetry.\n\nDara and I live in Kona, Hawaii, and Roya, who’s a junior staff editor for JSH, lives in Elsah with her husband, who teaches at Principia College.\n\nCongratulations class of 1974 on our 50th reunion!\n\nFour wonderful years at Principia College changed my life forever, mostly because of all you smart, kind, and funny classmates. A better group of friends could not be found.\n\nFun fact: I had never visited Principia, so fall of our freshman year my parents, my best friend Ken–who wanted to go along for the ride and I drove from Pennsylvania to Elsah, past the old guard house, straight to the back of Howard House, looking for the men's quad, completely lost. I met my first classmate when I had to lean out of the car window and ask upper class woman Sarah Lindley for directions. She didn't laugh or roll her eyes but very kindly pointed us in the right direction.\n\nFun fact: After finding Joe McNabb house and my room, I proceeded to the welcome party in the living room where I met my second classmate Dale Henn. My mom was already in the living room and had been talking to Dale. She introduced the two of us, and we have been lifelong friends.\n\nMy Principia experience was officially under way, and the best four years were ahead for all of us.\n\nI graduated Principia with a bachelor of Fine Arts. I interviewed for art and design jobs, but kept being hired in sales positions. Eventually I followed a lead and interviewed with a custom printing and manufacturing company IDL (In Divine Love) Worldwide started by a Christian Science family. I acted as a sales representative developing new business with national retail stores working with store designers creating fixtures, signage, and brand presence within stores. I spent many productive years in this creative industry at a time when new innovative retail stores were the destination of every shopper.\n\nMore importantly, I was led to find a fulfilling career utilizing my Principia education.\n\nIn 1985, I married the woman of my dreams. Mary Ann is beautiful, brilliant, creative, my soul mate, a great metaphysician, and the best mother to our children. As if that's not enough, she has had a full-time career in the beauty care and grocery industry\n\nWe started a family in 1998 and have two stunning, smart, and loving daughters, both Principia graduates. Ava (C'20) is a chemical engineer with Boeing in St. Louis. Her husband, Mason Switzer (C'18), is also a Prin grad and a mechanical engineer with Boeing.\n\nOur younger daughter, Paige (C'22), is marketing coordinator at Principia School and loves working for and supporting Principia.\n\nFun fact: Paige can be heard soloing on Sundays at several churches in the St. Louis area.\n\nFun fact: Mary Ann and I are currently refurbishing a mid-century modern ranch style home built in 1952.\n\nI look forward to seeing you all at our 50th reunion!\n\nLast Fun fact: There have been more hugs in the Principia Concourse than any other college building anywhere!!\n\nAfter graduating in ’74, I spent the summer with Andy Kehe living in Santa Monica, CA, working at Dodger Stadium and lying on the beaches. In Sept. of ‘74 I reunited with my Brooks North homies, Phil Webster and Glenn Hanneman (both C’74), back in St. Louis and worked alongside them at Smuggler’s Inn. Had a wonderful year with them, but needed to get back East so I moved to Washington DC in early 76.\n\nI began my banking career working as a branch manager for a small savings & loan in rural Maryland. Think of a savings & loan in the show “Green-Acres” -that was the S&L I worked at. The most embarrassing moment perhaps in my life happened one Saturday morning when a customer walked in saying he wanted a bridge loan. Not being well trained, I asked “why do you want to buy a bridge.” The moment those words were uttered the customer turned and walked out. That incident caused me to enroll in the MBA program offered at the University of Maryland.\n\nIn 1977 Tom Wheeler, another Brooks North homey, and I shared an apartment followed by buying a townhome in 1979 with Ken Freund, C’75 and another Brooks North warrior. At this point I’d moved out of “Green Acres” and began working for a bank in D.C. In 1982 I moved to Richmond VA and after 9 years that bank merged with C&S, a venerable southern bank headquartered in Atlanta, so they moved me to Georgia. Bought a house and started saying “y’all”.\n\nIn 1994 I was selected by the Atlanta Games Olympic Committee (ACOG) to be part of their Envoy Program, which resulted in my living in the 1996 Olympic Village and served as the liaison between the country of Macedonia’s lead official and ACOG. I had VIP access to all venues and events as an Envoy. I accompanied the team’s lead official wherever he wanted to go. I ate with the team, participated in the Opening and Closing Ceremonies, and even had my picture taken with Muhammed Ali.\n\nIn 1999 I married the woman of my dreams…a long wait but well worth it. Nancy and I have been married 25 wonderful years and have been blessed with two unbelievable children. By this time the bank that moved me to Atlanta through acquisition had become Bank of America. In 2000 I left BofA and my Senior Vice President title to move to Wachovia Bank as a project manager.\n\nIn 2001, Rachel was born and immediately brought us joy. She excelled academically and was named to the Georgia High School All Star Team in 2019. Rachel graduated from Amherst College in 2023 and is now living in Boston.\n\nRyan was born in 2004 with an innate curiosity in learning. He has taught himself several languages and loves music. Ryan just finished his freshman year on the Dean’s List at Cal Poly’s School of Architecture. When not studying he is a member of the Sailing Club.\n\nIn 2008 I exited the banking industry [finally] and bought a business coaching franchise. I currently specialize in working with owners of businesses with anywhere from 5 – 40 employees helping them scale their businesses. I am truly blessed to have made a big impact in the lives of my owner clients.\n\nMy life has taken many twists and turns and I’m excited at re-connecting with some ole Principia ‘74s at the Reunion.\n\nIt’s been a fulfilling half century. Most of my career has been in radio and television broadcasting and for 35+ years it was a peripatetic existence.\n\nAfter 2 years at Prin I transferred to USC and graduated with a communications degree. I was music host for a classical station (possibly because I knew how to pronounce the name of the conductor of the Moscow Symphony Orchestra, Gennady Rozhdestvensky). One of my teachers ran a news consultancy and helped me get a reporter/anchor job with the Montana Television Network (now defunct) which ran 4 stations in the state. From reporter and weekend anchor in Butte, I became News Director for the company’s new station in Missoula and then for 2 years I was Executive Producer and main anchor for the 2 primary daily news programs carried by each of the network’s stations. It was a big-fish-in-a-small-pond experience. I went onto anchor/reporter jobs in Des Moines, New Orleans, and Orlando.\n\nIn 1986 I was approached about a position as editor, reporter and host for Monitor Radio in Boston. After years of covering the seedy range of local news (car crashes, fires, murders etc.) I was thrilled at the idea of devoting my talents to a mission that aligned with both mind and heart. I worked with a great team of people for several years, building an audience and the number subscriber stations who loved the content, professionalism of production and overall quality, as well as an understanding of the meaning of Monitor Journalism. On station visits around the country, management told me they loved carrying our NPR-quality programming at far less than NPR fees.\n\nThen, it was decided that radio would end and that the church would produce several television programs that would fill a 7-day-a-week schedule for The Monitor Channel on cable. Clint Jones and I who worked together on the daily Monitor Radio program, were asked to write, edit and be the co-hosts for Today’s Monitor which would be taped inside the Monitor newsroom and included interviews with reporters and editors about the stories in each day’s newspaper. We were all driven by the spiritually minded purpose of what we were doing, and it was a high-water mark in my career. I and the program won several journalism awards.\n\nThe Monitor Channel ceased operations in April of 1992, and I moved to Chicago to be an anchor and reporter for CLTV, Chicagoland Television News. News Directors allowed me to step away from reporting on the standard local news fare and concentrate on think pieces and features. I won for myself and the station several awards (Emmys, AP First Place, Exemplary Journalist from the Society of Professional Journalists). I was also given a show on WGN 720 AM radio. What a blast to run the board in the sidewalk-facing “Showcase Studio” in the Tribune Tower on North Michigan Avenue.\n\nOther highlights:\n\nIn 2008 I was the first visiting scholar at Principia College. I was paid through a grant from the Annenberg Foundation. I taught news writing, radio production and a communications class. I also gave the school’s convocation speech that year.\n\nI was taken up in a Navy A-4 Skyhawk when the Blue Angels came to town. I had flown gliders and the pilot, sitting in front of me, gave some instructions and let me take the stick. I’ll never forget that. I told him if they could take every prospective Navy recruit up in one of these, they’d be signing up to be a Navy pilot when they landed. “Not you,” he said. At 6’ 1” I was too tall.\n\nOther points of note:\n\nI crash landed in a B-17, went on a date with Miss Universe, and interviewed Ronald Reagan.\n\nFor the last 12 years I’ve been coaching deal teams for a global consulting company…helping them win competitive RFPs on massively huge contacts.\n\nAt different church's I’ve been a SS teacher, SS Super, Treasurer, Board Chair, and 1st and 2nd Reader.\n\nNearly 5 years ago Elizabeth (from 1st church Arlington…we married in 1996) moved to the Philadelphia area. My two oldest children, William and Margaret who have 2 children each, live in the Midwest, our youngest, Marshall, works in North Carolina for 3M.\n\nAnd…. that’s my life in a nutshell. It’s been satisfying.\n\nI left Prin after my sophomore year to attend UCLA and graduated as a Bruin with a poli sci degree. I often reflect on that decision to leave Prin, with many regrets, but which seemed so right for me at the time.\n\nWent on to law school in San Diego where I had always wanted to end up, but the practice of law was not for me. Two years later, somehow, I ended up in commercial real estate for a dozen years, but again that was not my calling either.\n\nI then went on to get my CFP and CFA certifications and established a boutique (that means small) wealth management firm. Around that time I met my wife of nearly 33 years at a charity fundraiser for which I was the co-chair.\n\nWe ventured twice to China to adopt our children, two wonderful girls.\n\nOur oldest daughter, Allana, now 28, was 6 months old at the time. Our youngest daughter, Cianna, now 26, was 9 months old when she joined our family. It has been so wonderful having them in our lives.\n\nAllana graduated from Gonzaga and then received her law degree at USD. She is a Deputy District Attorney in the South Bay office of the San Diego District Attorney. After graduating from Chapman University, Cianna got a Master’s Degree in Business Analytics from USD. She now works for Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego as a Project Program Coordinator for the Foundation arm of the hospital.\n\nI went back to school a few years ago and got an LLM in tax from USD School of Law. I was on campus for 4 of my daughter’s 6 semesters at the law school. It was fun going to the library together to study for our finals. We never had a class together which is just the way she wanted it.\n\nI graduated in 2020 during Covid so there was no ceremony for us. The next year our class was invited to attend the ceremony with the class of 2021, my daughter’s class, so we walked together to get our diplomas. That was a very special moment, although more for me than for her!\n\nMy dad always told me that if you enjoy want you’re doing, you’ll never work a day in your life. That’s how I feel now. My practice is challenging, exciting, and just so enjoyable.\n\nI also serve on the investment committees for several non-profit organizations in San Diego including the United Way of San Diego and the San Diego Jewish Community Foundation.\n\nI’ve been back to Prin for a class reunion many, many years ago, a summer session, and the Hall of Fame induction for the basketball team that Terry McNabb mentioned in his post-Prin summary.\n\nLook forward to attending the reunion!\n\nSo fun to reconnect with my Principia family. I got a chance to catch up and be with both Jane (Levy) McClane and Nancy Moore at my first Prin Summer Session in June 2023. It was my first Summer Session and I will be back in 2024. I absolutely loved it, and if you have never been I highly recommend it! Great classes with no term papers or grades, what could be better?!\n\nCatching up on old and dear friendships at a Prin Reunion is such a lovely blessing. I look forward to getting reconnected with my Syl sisters at our 50th.\n\nThe summer after our Prin graduation I moved to Indianapolis, Indiana to take a job that Dr. Hosmer from Prin actually helped me find. That led to a 28-year museum career at The Children’s Museum of Indianapolis as a researcher, curator, exhibit developer and project manager. Such a wonderful career, and one for which I will be forever grateful to Dr. Hosmer for helping me secure.\n\nChuck and Jeri Hosmer and their two children, Kathryn and Jonathan even came up to Wisconsin for my wedding in the summer 1977 when Karl Ryan and I were married in my parents’ back yard on Lake Kegonsa. Karl and I were married for 27 years until he suddenly announced he was leaving. I am afraid it totally caught me off guard, as I thought we were very happily married. It was a really hard few years for me, trying to crawl out of a very deep pit of depression. Lots of my own prayers, prayerful support from others, and dear friends got me through.\n\nKarl and I have three wonderful children: Noah age 40, Lark age 36, and Henry age 32. I love being a nana to Henry’s two boys, Finnley age 7, Lucca age 9, and twin baby girls, Zorah and Sabine born in December 2023. Believe me, my nana life is both busy and rich. I have loved being both a mom and a nana! Best life roles ever!\n\nI enjoyed 28 years in the museum field, taught Museum Studies for Indiana University, and then directed a yearly festival of religion, the arts and humanities for Indiana University Purdue University at Indianapolis called the Spirit and Place Festival. I did a lot of writing for the CS periodicals back in the 1990s and also wrote for spirituality.com when that site was still active. I took a break from working for a few years to travel a bit. My favorite trips were Tanzania & Kenya and the Galapagos Islands & Peru. A 10-day interfaith trip to Turkey with adult son Noah was another highlight. I also enjoyed Europe, the Mediterranean, Scandinavia & Russia. I do love to travel.\n\nAt age 60, I had an “and now for something completely different” moment and started my own business, Palm Source Pine Island, a palm tree farm in SW Florida. After some great years of palm farming (unfortunately, most of my farm was destroyed by Hurricanes Ian and Irma), my business partner bought me out in the spring of 2023. I am now gratefully retired from that and free of farming.\n\nOn the home front, I am now partnered up with Fred Schiele, who you may remember from our early 1970s time at Prin. Fred was a “Buckie” and a 1973 Prin grad. Fred and I re-met in 2018 at a college reunion. We had briefly dated freshman year, each married other Prin folks, and were both divorced when we reconnected. I honestly had no plans to look for another spouse when we met again at that reunion, but Fred was sweetly persistent. We now live back in Indianapolis, where my grandkids reside and are enjoying a lovely second chance relationship together.\n\nWe’re both super involved in our condo HOA, Fred being the President of the Board of Managers and me community building by initiating a pretty comprehensive monthly HOA newsletter and instigating neighborhood social events and several book clubs.\n\nRight now my primary focus is on the two new grand babies is supporting my son and daughter-in-law as they navigate having two babies in the house with their already busy two little boys. I pick up the boys daily after school for afternoon adventures at parks, playgrounds, museums and the library. Such a fun time!\n\nOn the personal front before the new babies came along I was considering getting a theology degree from a local seminary. The new twin babies have postponed that plan, so currently I am working my way through a rather extensive booklist of old and new testament textbooks and other readings. I would describe it as sort of a self-study home school program on the Bible. I am loving exploring some of the newer Bible translations available today. I am very active in two interfaith Bible study groups I launched, plus a women’s interfaith group.\n\nAll in all, life is a lovely adventure of grandchildren, children, catching up on books I’ve not had time to read, studying some things I always wished I had at Prin, and enjoying the lovely relationships and friendships cultivated both in the past and in the present. Looking forward to catching up in June with all you alums I haven’t seen in 50 years and with those I have.\n\nPrin 50 Years\n\nI feel lucky to have jammed a lot into the past 50 years. Most of it has been good. Nice long marriage, lifelong friends, wonderful family life. Rewarding and interesting career that’s still going on . . . and keeps me from attending Reunion.\n\nSad to miss our 50th.\n\nEarly Work\n\nAfter college, I had no master plan. No life or career goals. Life just happened. But I had a 22 year old’s notion of what I wanted to do: go to New York, wear a suit, have an expense account, get into the TV business – not necessarily in that order.\n\nEarly career work was daunting but fun. Production jobs and newsroom support at KYW TV, WINS Radio, WMCA Radio, Evening Magazine. Sales work followed at the CBS Television Network in NY – which opened up the world of advertising that lasted 30 years.\n\nAdvertising\n\nIn 1977, I was recruited from CBS to work at NY ad agency, Ogilvy & Mather, as a network TV buyer. Recruited again in 1980 to work at Lord Geller Federico & Einstein to manage the TV launch of the IBM personal computer. Yes, that long ago.\n\nIn 1987, Ogilvy & Mather spun off an independent, privately held ad agency because of client conflicts. I had worked with the client that forced the spin off and joined the new agency, Hal Riney & Partners, as senior vice president, broadcast. It was a good move. Our first year we billed $12 million. When we sold the agency to Publicis in 2007, we billed $700 million.\n\nIt was not only a great 20-year run but also a great time to be working in TV with the expansion of networks and explosion of cable TV. It was a right time/right place situation.\n\nWe worked with traditional networks and cable networks not just buying airtime, but also developing and producing content – mostly for network sports. I was involved with a lot of sports sponsorships across many platforms – mostly because Seth ‘Mater’ Marshall (US'70, C'75) wanted me to take him to these events!\n\nFamily\n\nI married Gail Homer in 1987 after a lengthy courtship. We were introduced by Gary (US'71, C'75) and Susie Sleeper. Thank you, Gary and Susie. Margaret West Seay (Maggie) was born in 1988 in New York City. We’ve lived in New York City a few times, Bronxville and Bridgehampton.\n\nGail is a theatrical producer who fell into an enviable niche as executive producer for medal ceremonies at the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. She’s been involved with not only the Olympics but also many international events ever since.\n\nI’ve kept up with my extended Prin family thanks to Mater’s many reunions at his Lake House which included the Upper School and College. One of the best get togethers was the Upper School football team reunion, coaches Munnecke and Morse included.\n\nLife After Advertising\n\nWhen the advertising career ended in 2008, I joined Gail’s company, Homer Productions Inc. HPI is just the two of us and serves as an umbrella for freelance work at sporting events. Sometimes we work together. Sometimes independently. Sometimes at the same event but different areas. Will take what we can get!\n\nIt’s worked out well. For the past 15 years, we’ve managed, consulted, and/or produced medal ceremonies for the Vancouver, London, Rio, Pyeongchang, and Beijing Olympics, Lausanne Youth Olympics, Buenos Aires Youth Olympics, as well as the Pan Am Games, World Games, European Championships, World Athletics World Championships, Asian Athletics Championships, Islamic Games, Warrior Games, World Handball Championships, Asian Games, and more.\n\nWe head to Paris in a week for the upcoming Olympics. Gail works for the IOC overseeing all medal ceremonies. I’ll work with the organizing committee to produce the medal ceremonies for athletics (Track and Field) at the Stade de France.\n\nThis freelance work and travel is great fun – a wonderful space between full-time work and retirement. We don’t want to see it end.\n\nAgain, sorry I can’t make it to Reunion. My best to all Prin alumni!\n\nMy 50 year summary for the purposes of our reunion at Principia College.\n\nPutting my degree in business administration to good use began when I joined the Boeing Company in 1978. I was fortunate to be able to get my foot in the door as a financial analyst. However, shortly after I had joined, I began a career as a system analyst, working on many development projects supporting the Boeing Commercial Airplane Company, including the 747/757/767/777. It was a fruitful and rewarding experience doing development of new programs and processes in support of such things as floor panels and a completely electronic integrated work statement for the 777 (first time ever).\n\nSoon I was selected to lead the Boeing computing services process improvement effort. I was instrumental in leading teams to develop new processes, establish metrics (for the first time in Boeing history), and make improvements to them that were eventually adopted by Boeing corporate and disseminated throughout the entire Boeing Company, affecting all programs and employees. After management declared victory in the continuous quality improvement arena, they dispersed us to other parts of the programs, and I was given the opportunity as a project/program manager to manage the development and implementation of many major programs including helping establish the Charleston, SC, manufacturing plant. All of that was a wonderful way to spend my days and enabled me to provide a wonderful lifestyle for my family.\n\nIn 2007, I met a wonderful woman who I proposed to on the Safeco Field Center Field scoreboard. She was in attendance with me for a July 8 game and accepted my proposal immediately. On August 30 of that year, we were married and began what has been a fabulous adventure. She has been wonderful for me, and I love and adore her.\n\nWe have traveled extensively during our marriage until a few years ago when COVID hit. We have been to Hawaii many times (our favorite island is Kauai!). We lived in the Pacific Northwest for 10 years until I retired from Boeing. Then we moved to the Treasure Coast of Florida to be near our son and his wife and our grandson. We had four kids (one of which passed from cancer almost two years ago) and seven grandkids. After three years, we moved to upstate New York to be near my wife’s mother and her two sister"
