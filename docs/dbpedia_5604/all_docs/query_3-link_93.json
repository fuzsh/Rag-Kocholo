        "text": "Founded by businessman Chauncey Rose in 1874, Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology (then Rose Polytechnic Institute) has thrived under the dedicated leaders whose vision has propelled the institute from its beginnings as a little-known, all-male engineering college to a world-class institution on the leading edge of engineering education in the United States. Todayâ€™s Board of Trustees, acting president Robert A. Coons, and cabinet members are committed to continuing, and building upon, this legacy of excellence.\n\nLearn more about our history and leadership below."
