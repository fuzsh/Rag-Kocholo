        "text": "Ben Franklin Academy sophomore Kira F. along with her horse, Gemini, recently competed in a national equestrian competition, where she came in first place for all Juniors. She also placed fifth in the Pure Arabians division. They were honored at the Georgia Arabian Horse Association Award Ceremony, where Kira was named overall Grand Champion and earned reserve in Endurance and Competitive Trail Riding, champion for English Pleasure, as well as several other awards for Dressage English Equestrian and Hunter Seat. Way to go, Kira (and Gemini)!\n\nAt a recent reception and art show, hosted by the Congressman John Lewis at the High Museum of Art, BFA students Wren S. and Walker M. had artwork exhibited. Walker won second place and a scholarship to Savannah College of Art and Design for $7,500. We are so proud of both students and wish to congratulate Walker on his award.\n\nGenevieve is a part of the work-study program at BFA. She's been at BFA since 9th grade. In 7th grade, Genevieve started “Inman Bark”, a local pet sitting business. Since then, she's branched out and has started \"farm sitting\" for local farmers as well! The work-study program allows Genevieve the flexibility to be a high school student while also pursuing her passion- caring for animals. After she graduates this spring, Genevieve will attend Berry College where she plans to study Animal Science, and eventually, become a large animal veterinarian.\n\nBen Franklin Academy senior, Harriet M., spent this summer in a scholars program at Winship Cancer Institute that paired students with medical professionals working on a research project relating to cancer. The students were guided to do research and collect necessary data for a final presentation, with the goal to investigate the possibility of improving the quality of scans in HIV Lymphoma patients. Harriet worked at both Emory University Hospital and Grady Memorial Hospital.\n\nIvan enrolled at BFA at the beginning of his Junior Year. Ivan is from Russia, and his father, mother, and four younger siblings still live in Russia. Though this is not his first time living away from home, this is Ivan's first year of high school in the United States. He's a member of our Cross Country and Ultimate Frisbee teams. He believes the most valuable part of being at BFA is the flexibility our school offers. Since students work at their own pace, he is able to focus on truly learning class material and doesn't feel the unnecessary stress and pressure that he's experienced at more traditional schools. Further, Ivan is able to go visit his family in Russia every several months and doesn't have to worry about falling behind in school. Ivan plans to go to an American university once he graduates next year and wants to study International Business.\n\nBFA students and faculty recently welcomed two new employees -- \"Benjamin\" and \"Franklin\" -- beautiful and talented Ragdoll kittens. They follow our wonderful and wise \"Clark,\" who passed away last month at 16 years of age from cancer. \"Benjamin\" and \"Franklin\" are doing their best to encourage students to do their schoolwork with their cute kitten antics, e.g., untying shoe laces and performing aerial tricks."
