        "text": "All good things must come to an end, and we’re sorry to report that those long summer days spent lounging at the pool must finally give way to autumnal days studying at school. And while writing an essay or studying for a calculus test is way less fun than, say, chilling with friends in the deep end, there are quite a few perks that come with heading back to the classroom. Think of all the cool school supplies you get to stock up on—for our money, there are few things finer than a Pink Pearl eraser—as well as an assortment of new clothes that are sure to show off the highlights and tan you got at the aforementioned pool.\n\nStill feeling a little sad about getting down to business and cracking open those books? That’s understandable. But there’s something to be said about getting smarter. In fact, there are a whole lot of famous people ranging from Michelle Obama and the Dalai Lama to Oprah and Amy Poehler who have a whole lot to say on the topic. Take a gander, and we bet that their wise words will make you feel a little more excited about all the edification and enlightenment that will happen this year.\n\nBack to School Quotes for Students\n\n“For there is always light.
