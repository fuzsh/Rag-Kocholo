        "text": "The global biscuits market size was valued at USD 104.32 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from USD 108.75 billion in 2024 to USD 167.69 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 5.56% during the forecast period. Asia Pacific dominated the biscuits market with a market share of 32.62% in 2023.\n\nBiscuits are baked, floury snacks or treats that are typically crisp and dry. They contain flour, sugar, butter or vegetable oil, eggs, leavening agents, such as baking powder or baking soda, and flavorings. Other ingredients may also be added, such as essences, chocolates, coffee, spices, dried fruits, nuts, seeds, and cheeses. To make these snacks, the dough or batter is formed into shapes and baked to form a crisp and firm texture. These can be made in many shapes, sizes, and flavors, and are available in various types including plain cream filling, sandwiching, wafer styles, shortbread, and digestives. They are often consumed as snacks, desserts, or as accompaniments to tea and coffee.\n\nBiscuits make up the largest processed food category in India. According to the 2019-20 annual report issued by major biscuit manufacturer Britannia Industries, more than 90% of the nation’s households buy this snacking product.\n\nMany people had started working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a significant demand for convenience foods as these products have a longer shelf life. The biscuit industry had witnessed higher sales than those during pre-pandemic times. In addition, the outbreak had ushered in various health and wellbeing trends, leading to the adoption of conscious eating habits among consumers.\n\nBiscuits Market Trends\n\nGrowing Trend of Gluten-Free and Organic Products\n\nThe demand for clean-label and gluten-free biscuits, cookies, and crackers has risen globally. The prevalence of celiac is one of the key factors increasing consumers’ preference for gluten-free goods. According to the U.K. Coeliac Organization, with a prevalence rate of 1 in 100, a substantial number of people in the U.K. have coeliac disease.\n\nMoreover, players are concentrating on creating high-fiber, low-calorie, and gluten-free products in the light of this trend. For instance, in April 2022, the Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) launched 100% natural and patented gluten-free millet products. The newly-launched products included cream, salted, and milk biscuits for Indian consumers.\n\nThe growing trend of casual snacking is one of the major factors boosting the market’s growth. Out-of-home snacking is growing in popularity as more people are entering the workforce and spending longer amounts of time outside their homes. The demand for biscuits among various snacks has also increased recently.\n\nRequest a Free sample to learn more about this report.\n\nBiscuits Market Growth Factors\n\nIncreased Preference for Convenient Snacking and Product Innovations to Drive Market Growth\n\nAs consumers' lifestyles become busier, there is a growing demand for convenient, healthy snacks that can be consumed on the go or during quick breaks. People of all ages prefer snacking, resulting in an increasing demand for products in this category. Additionally, consumers are drawn to new offerings that promise a fresh and unique experience. Children, in particular, enjoy biscuits with different flavors, shapes, and creams. Introducing innovative flavors, ingredient combinations, or product formats can help drive consumer engagement, ultimately leading to higher sales and enhanced brand loyalty.\n\nIn April 2022, Koobi 5D Fun Chocolate and Milk Biscuits, made by Shoon Fatt Biscuit & Confectionery Factory Sdn Bhd., were launched in animal shapes in Malaysia. These are available in chocolate and milk flavors, and claim to assist in the growth of a child's learning, cognitive capacities, and motor skills.\n\nFurthermore, premium biscuit crackers are becoming more popular as gifts for special occasions, such as Halloween, Christmas, or Valentine's Day. High-income consumers are more interested in consuming premium coffee, caramel, and chocolate biscuits. The increased demand for innovative biscuit flavors will also stimulate sales.\n\nAvailability at Retail Stores and E-Commerce Platforms to Significantly Impact Market Growth\n\nA vast selection of crackers produced by different brands is easily accessible through the internet. Customers can conveniently choose from various brands, compare prices, and read reviews before making a purchase. This accessibility significantly benefits customers who may not have access to retail outlets or a variety of snacks locally, thus driving market growth. Small and niche biscuit manufacturers can reach a broader consumer base through online platforms such as Amazon and advertisements on social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook. These platforms are designed to showcase specialty biscuit products that come in organic, gluten-free, vegan, and international varieties—options that might not be readily available in the local market. This aspect is expected to have a positive impact on market growth. Additionally, with the emergence of hypermarkets and malls, a diverse range of products with more choices and textures are now readily available. Biscuit manufacturing companies are also incorporating television commercials into their marketing strategy to promote their products, further contributing to the market's expansion.\n\nRESTRAINING FACTORS\n\nHigh Raw Material Prices and Availability of Other Snacking Options May Hamper Market Growth\n\nThe market is facing challenges due to the rising costs of raw materials. Prices of edible items have been consistently increasing since the pandemic. Essential raw materials used in the bakery industry have become more expensive compared to pre-pandemic levels. Therefore, the industry is struggling to remain competitive in the international market in terms of pricing, despite offering good-quality products. For instance, according to the Trade Promotion Council of India (TPCI), the increase in commodity prices such as wheat flour, along with the rising price of refined palm oil, is impacting the profit margins of biscuit manufacturers in India.\n\nAdditionally, the market is encountering competition from other snack food categories, such as chips and healthy snack bars. These two categories are gaining popularity and capturing a significant market share. These factors can hinder market development. Apart from the quality of ingredients, the type of ingredients used for making biscuits, such as refined flour, butter, and edible fats also dampens consumers' enthusiasm toward purchasing snacks, such as biscuits. Refined flour has high calories, which can lead to obesity and cardiovascular problems if the biscuits are consumed in huge quantities.\n\nBiscuits Market Segmentation Analysis\n\nBy Product Type Analysis\n\nSweet Biscuits to Dominate Due to Their Nutritional Composition and Wide Availability\n\nBased on product type, the market is segmented into crackers, sweet biscuits, and savory biscuits. The sweet biscuits segment dominates the market due to their nutritional composition, which includes fiber, fat, and carbohydrates. These snacks, due to their high nutrient content, are becoming increasingly common in the daily breakfast routine of consumers worldwide. With the introduction of innovative shapes, packaging, and flavors, the chocolate biscuits market growth continues. The growing demand for healthy crusts and the rising per capita consumption of sweet crackers in developing economies will present lucrative opportunities for industry players. Whole grain snacks, such as oats and millet, are also gaining traction among health-conscious consumers globally.\n\nIn July 2022, Parle Products, an Indian multinational food processing company, expanded its biscuit portfolio by introducing Oats-Berries and Cinnamon Biscuits. Parle plans to strengthen its grip on the industry by filling the gap of an affordable health biscuit. It is available for a price of USD 0.12, thus providing a healthy and inexpensive alternative for health-conscious consumers.\n\nTo know how our report can help streamline your business, Speak to Analyst\n\nBy Flavor Analysis\n\nPlain Segment to Dominate Global Market Owing to Their Convenience\n\nBased on flavor, the market is divided into plain, chocolate, cheese, fruit & nut, and other varieties.

The growing demand for healthy snacks and the rising per capita consumption of plain sweet biscuits may present lucrative opportunities. Plain crackers made of whole grains, such as wheat, oats, and millet, are attracting health-conscious consumers globally.\n\nIn April 2022, Britannia Industries Limited co-created and launched ‘Britannia Marie Gold Jeera’ exclusively for customers in Tamil Nadu, India. The biscuit’s key ingredient is Jeera, an ingredient favored by the state for its health benefits and distinct taste.\n\nBy Distribution Channel Analysis\n\nHypermarkets/Supermarkets to Dominate Market Due to Large Collection of Biscuit Varieties\n\nBased on the distribution channel, the market is divided into hypermarkets/supermarkets, specialty stores, independent bakeries, and online platforms. The hypermarkets/supermarkets segment accounts for the largest market share. These stores are the most widely preferred distribution channels among consumers to purchase their products, as they enable them to choose from a wide collection of biscuit varieties. There are several aisles specifically dedicated to premium products. Additionally, consumer purchasing patterns are changing significantly, with many of them shifting towards online channels to search for and purchase products. Thus, biscuit manufacturers are also increasing their presence on online platforms by introducing product offers and targeted marketing for consumers.\n\nREGIONAL INSIGHTS\n\nThe global market is segregated into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East & Africa, and South America.\n\nAsia Pacific Biscuits Market Size, 2023 (USD Billion)\n\nTo get more information on the regional analysis of this market, Request a Free sample\n\nAsia Pacific holds the largest biscuits market share, with a valuation of USD 32.87 billion in 2022, and is expected to exhibit the fastest growth over the forecast period. This region comprises several emerging countries, including China, India, Japan, and Australia. These nations are experiencing substantial growth in their middle-class population and urbanization, offering numerous opportunities for key players to expand in the region. India and China are the primary drivers behind the exceptional growth rate witnessed in the Asian market. Increased awareness regarding proper nutrition and a focus on a healthy diet are crucial aspects of today's busy lifestyle, leading consumers to seek convenient food items that facilitate measuring nutrient intake. Consequently, companies are progressively launching digestive crackers and developing innovative plain, sugar-free biscuits enriched with grains. Moreover, the growth of retail stores and e-commerce platforms in the region has introduced new distribution channels for biscuit manufacturers.\n\nFor instance, in May 2023, Ferrero aimed to strengthen its market presence across Asia and launch its Nutella Biscuits T12 & T22 through key airports in Singapore, Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei, Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, and Shanghai.\n\nEurope has a strong preference for biscuits as a breakfast choice among its consumers.

The increasing awareness of health and safety issues has led to a rising demand for products that are free from GMOs or additives among consumers in North America.

This trend is expected to fuel the consumption of bakery products in countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Chile, and Ecuador. Manufacturers are actively catering to this demand by launching organic baked goods and investing in R&D to meet the growing consumer demand. For example, in November 2022, Nestlé announced the establishment of a new research & development center for Latin America to innovate for and collaborate with regional consumers. This initiative will enable the development of tasty, nutritious, affordable, and sustainable products that are highly relevant to local consumers.\n\nThe Middle East & Africa market is primarily driven by the region's demand for convenient and on-the-go snacks. The increasing popularity of clean-label snacks is expected to drive product innovation in the market.
