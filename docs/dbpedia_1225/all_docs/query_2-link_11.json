        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIt leveraged the strong brands through steady investment & invested in building additional capacity to increase in-house manufacturing of premium brands.\n\nWhile the fast-moving consumer goods sector has not had it as bad as others, the last one and half years have nevertheless been challenging. Battling inflation that led to input costs rising and hurt consumer demand, companies have been hard pressed to balance growth in sales and profit. Currency depreciation and uncertain macroeconomic factors further accentuated the volatility. Most companies have witnessed a slowdown in volume growth because of the increase in product prices during this period. However, a few companies have managed to expand volume as well as margins. Bangalore-based Britannia Industries is one of them, reckoned as one of the best performers in the current slump.\n\nFood is a Rs 12.5 lakh crore opportunity in India. Branded foods are growing faster than the overall food and non-food segments, driven by consumers' quest for quality and convenience. Biscuits are the largest category in the branded foods segment, which is valued at Rs 25,000 crore. Despite the economic gloom, the bakery segment is still growing at 12-14 per cent.\n\nBritannia markets diverse brands and packs at various price points across the bakery and dairy portfolio. Its bakery portfolio includes biscuits, bread, cake and rusk with the first being the largest of these categories. Britannia has about a third of the biscuits market in India and a dominant share of other baked categories. In biscuits, it competes with multinationals, large local companies with a nationwide footprint and smaller regional players. In cake, rusk and bread, the company competes mostly with regional brands with Britannia being the only national player. Many new companies, local and international, have entered the dairy segment.\n\nBritannia was an underperformer in the consumer goods sector in 2010-12 with low profitability levels of 4-5 per cent of operating profit margin. High raw material costs narrowed margins while intensifying competition brought pressure on pricing. According to the company's spokesperson, the key challenge was to continue to drive profit expansion amid high food inflation and slower GDP growth while making building up the organisation to ensure future growth.\n\nThe company adopted a three-pronged approach to overcome the challenges it faced. It focused on driving innovation by producing new high-margin, value-added product offerings, boosting revenue by introducing differentiated brands with differential pricing and restructuring costs through improving operational efficiencies throughout the value chain.\n\nThe company leveraged its strong brands through steady investment, investing in building additional capacity in order to increase in-house manufacturing of premium brands and focusing on complexity reduction with rationalised stock keeping units (SKUs) and work processes that resulted in profitable growth. The company invested in further strengthening its reach in urban and rural markets. It restructured distribution models to gain depth of distribution in urban markets and width of distribution in rural markets.\n\nThe result of all these efforts has been seen in the form of enhanced profitability in the last three quarters. From 4-6 per cent in earlier quarters, the company's operating margin rose to 9 per cent in the quarters ended March and June. The strong double-digit growth of 14-16 per cent in net sales was volume driven.\n\nThe Street acknowledged the turnaround and the company's stock was rerating on the bourses. It has gained 89 per cent in the last one year against the 19 per cent increase in the ET FMCG Index.\n\nThe company expects the overall bakery market to grow 13-15 per cent in the coming year. It has strong drivers that will lead to growth in the long run. Even though biscuits are popular all over in India, consumption is about 1.5 kg per person per year -- very low compared to other developed markets - indicating scope for secular growth. The push for a presence in the high-margin product mix in biscuits is proving to be timely - directly reflecting in improved margin profile.\n\nBesides this, the strategy of stepping up the focus on international operations and newer businesses such as dairy and breakfast meals are also in the right direction - given the fact that the growth rate of biscuits as a category has been slowing. In this scenario, the dairy segment offers a promising opportunity for Britannia -- it's growing fast and provides scope for differentiation.\n\nThe dairy segment's net profit more than doubled in FY13 to Rs 35 crore from Rs 15.5 crore in the previous year. The international business, growing at more than 20 per cent in revenue, is also profitable with the company's brands available in more than 30 countries. However, the dairy and international businesses account for just over 10 per cent of revenue, underscoring Britannia's dependence on the bakery segment.\n\nThe appointment of a new CEO is expected to further steer the company toward sustaining its new-found growth momentum. Analysts expect revenue to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 15-20 per cent over the next three years - driven by an improvement in product mix, volume growth, price increases and a rising share of non-biscuit businesses.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nSpotted a flying saucer?
