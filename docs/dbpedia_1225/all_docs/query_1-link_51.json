        "text": "Brand Britain has taken quite a battering from the international media over these past 12 months. Once hailed as a globe-strutting player, awash with confidence and creativity, the nation is now increasingly portrayed as insular, parochial and nostalgia-obsessed. Coverage of shortages in fuel, food and the workforce has at times been damning, with Boris Johnson’s misfiring COP26 speech widely derided in the foreign press and The New York Times warning in October that the country was suffering a “deep sense of anxiety”. For an industry looking to sell the best of the country’s energetic creative spirit overseas, 2021 can only have been a challenge.\n\n“It’s just insane, it’s like the end of empire,” according to James Brown, former editor of Loaded and GQ and author of an upcoming book looking back on his career as a music journalist in the 1980s and 1990s. “But it’s other industries that are struggling. They’re taking pigs out and shooting them, there are no lorries to be driven, but it’s not like they’re taking ad copywriters out and shooting them in Seven Dials or wherever they are. They aren’t slaughtering executive creative directors on Redchurch Street.”\n\nBrown has a theory that intense creative periods usually follow difficult times socially; that the bright pop explosion of the 1960s was a follow-on from the relatively drab 1950s and that the coming together of talent in the 1990s had its roots firmly in the previous decade. “I do think that creativity will be inspired by the current difficulties,” he says. “A lot of my contemporaries who were doing very well in the nineties, whether they were fashion designers like Lee [Alexander] McQueen or record label owners like Alan McGee or comedians like Frank Skinner, Vic and Bob and so on, they’d kind of been through the dull period of the eighties and it was a reaction. All that stuff that happened in the nineties was fermenting and gathering pace in the late eighties.”\n\nPunching above its weight\n\nTwenty-five years ago, the headlines were about Cool Britannia. Now associated with Tony Blair and New Labour, the phrase was first used by Conservative secretary of state for national heritage (a forerunner of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) Virginia Bottomley in a series of press releases in 1996. Later that year, a Newsweek piece celebrated London as a hip centre of popular culture. In 1997, with Labour in power, Vanity Fair detailed the overlap of culture and politics in a 25-page feature.\n\nJames Murphy, founder and chief executive of New Commercial Arts, believes the UK was punching a little above its weight on the global stage during the mid-1990s. “We’ve lost some of that lustre in terms of being sophisticated players, we’re probably seen as a bit clownish on the world stage, but hopefully that’s only temporary,” he says. “We’re trying to find a new position in the world.”\n\nSo far, that hasn’t had any adverse effect on NCA’s international client list. “There’s been no disruption to service in that sense of global thinking, because clients are still plugged into a city that’s essentially a global one,” Murphy adds. “If I was a politician or thinking about the country, that’s a bigger challenge, because what the changes of the last few years have meant is that London has become more separate from the rest of the UK than it was before.”\n\nIt has mostly been ever thus. For all the Union Flag waving during Cool Britannia, the majority of the international interest homed in on the capital. “One of the bigger challenges is to break the grip of London on the industry,” Murphy continues. During the summer, NCA opened an offshoot in Glasgow, a move prompted not by clients but by talent graduating from local colleges.\n\nDiversity has always been at the heart of all the UK’s creative industries’ successes, home and abroad. In the aforementioned Newsweek article, US journalist Stryker McGuire wrote: “Arriving in droves, young advertising creative types come to London to hone their skills and soak up its famous nightlife. Immigrants from around the world pump new skills, innovation, enthusiasm and just plain hard work into a labour-hungry, creatively starved economy.”\n\nHas that really all been lost now? At Leo Burnett London, chief strategy officer Josh Bullmore believes that creativity and politics in this country are veering off in very different directions, with the former becoming the focal point for a more inclusive set of global values. “The creative output works really hard to offset impressions of insularity that we might have,” he says, citing the examples of Adele and Ed Sheeran in music, with their international profiles, and global TV and streaming hits like Succession (created and written by Brit Jesse Armstrong), I May Destroy You and The Crown. And then there’s The Great British Bake Off, hugely popular in the States and much loved for its portrayal of a more caring and sharing Britain where competitors look out for each other. “People are able to divorce the politics from the popular culture that we’re putting out,” Bullmore adds. “You can’t by definition lead if you’re trying to hark back to the past, because others who are more in tune with the zeitgeist will overtake you.”\n\nThe great British identity crisis\n\nPrompted in part by Brexit, Uncommon Creative Studio commissioned research asking respondents from around the world for their impressions of various countries. Most were able to give a single, immediate answer, often with no clichés spared (Germany: highly efficient, for example), but struggled to whittle Britain down to one easy soundbite. “They split it between the establishment and street culture,” Uncommon founder Lucy Jameson says. “People couldn’t settle on Britain as being one thing because both of those perceptions are in their heads. My feeling is that the establishment part is now even more insular, old-fashioned and backward-looking, but I suspect that the perception of street culture, of innovation, music, creativity, hasn’t really changed.”\n\nJameson believes that the physical limitations of lockdown allowed UK agencies and creatives to connect more globally and that, across the Atlantic, for a client on the East Coast, it’s just as easy for them to work with a well-connected British company than one on the US West Coast. That tallies with the experiences of Mary Portas, retail consultant, broadcaster and founder of the Portas Agency, who says that New York-based clients in particular have increasingly been turning to the UK for inspiration, despite all the political upheaval.\n\n“If anything, the UK in our industry has always been seen as a seat of innovation and a creativity that puts a finger up to the societal norms, whereas New York was always big, brash, mass market,” Portas says. “A lot of innovation comes from countries who have had to find a new form of creativity because of what’s happened through Covid and, indeed, Brexit. I think to pick Brexit out of this is like a little pimple on top of a new landscape of a new skin that’s growing.”\n\nCool Britannia old and new (clockwise from top left): London 2012, the Spice Girls, the Beatles, writer, producer and actress Michaela Coel, and the cast of James Bond movie No Time to Die\n\nDon’t write off creative Britain\n\nRichard Huntington, chairman and chief strategy officer at Saatchi & Saatchi London, agrees that Brexit is something of a red herring (if not a pimple) and that British creativity can call on deep structures during troubling times. “It’s far more robust than one government, one political episode, one decade. Creative Britain is a lot stronger than middle England Britain or insular Britain, and far more enduring. Exporting six episodes of Vigil probably does more good for us than the harm done by a culture secretary who’s said that the BBC won’t exist in 10 years’ time.”\n\nFor all that, Huntington wants the industry to embrace the challenges of standing up for the wider arts and cultural framework. “Our brand has always done well when it’s had something to kick against, to be angry about and be passionate about,” he says. “We need to feed the hand that feeds us. Stand up for arts funding and the education system and we will resolve the mother culture of advertising.”\n\nBullmore echoes the idea that British creativity remains in good health, but is equally cautious about the coming months and years. “Its value is that it’s a source of soft power and hard cash,” he says. “There’s a bit of a virtuous cycle that could be undermined, because we’re a highly creative, literate domestic market. And I think that’s why we’re such a good exporter, because we’ve got institutions and a culture that has fostered creativity, and that then grows the appetite of British audiences.\n\n“There’s a risk of that being undermined because the institutions that foster the creativity are feeling less confidence, so you’ve got the BBC and Channel 4 under threat and you’ve got politicians trying to curtail their strength. And if they start getting more risk averse, that virtuous cycle risks becoming a vicious cycle. We’ve got such a long heritage of producing world-class creativity and people but I feel like we’re storing up problems for the future.”\n\nAt the Advertising Association, chief executive Stephen Woodford has been campaigning for the industry as a key exporter in a post-Brexit world, while also highlighting the influence of overseas talent and how that in turn helps attract overseas clients. In March 2020, the AA launched the UK Advertising Export Group in partnership with various government departments, including the Department for International Trade and DCMS, promoting British adland creativity abroad. “Advertising needs to be seen as one of the crown jewels of UK creative industries alongside film and music,” Woodford says. “The work attracts the talent and the talent attracts the work. That’s why we make the best stuff. The biggest threat is, do we still attract talent? And it’ll be 10 years before we know the answer.”\n\nIn the meantime, a cautious optimism remains, prompted in part by the twin disruptions of Brexit and Covid. “There are lots of things in the mix that are making us look at things afresh, and personally that’s really exciting and I think Britain’s got lots of opportunity,” Jameson says. “And if your clients are on the right side of that, then I think it’s super powerful. I feel weirdly optimistic, but I’m not denying that the perceptions of us around the world as a reliable, sensible, smart, tolerant nation have definitely been harmed. I don’t think that perception of the UK as being creative has yet been dented, but we’re going to have to hold on to that carefully, because it will be a massive shame if we lose that.”\n\nBrown is equally confident, and adds that any stagnation and insularity is generally among an older crowd: “Younger people out there are just getting on with it. I don’t think a traffic jam outside Folkestone is going to fuck up a young creative’s outlook. You’ve only got to scroll through Instagram for a few hours and you see all this brilliant British creativity.”\n\nAdvertising's added value\n\nPublished earlier this year, the Advertising Association’s third UK Advertising Exports Report values the country’s advertising and market research services at £11bn in exports for the year ending 31 December 2019. That represents a 7% increase from £10bn in 2018 and, taken over the period 2013-19, a compound annual growth rate of 15.3%.\n\nThat puts the industry third in the list of key service sector exporters, behind insurance and pension services (worth £20bn over the same period) and computer services (£12bn) and ahead of engineering (£8bn) and legal services (£7bn).\n\nThe US remains the largest market, importing more than £1bn of UK advertising and marketing research services, followed by France (£785m), Germany (£712m), Switzerland (£643m) and Ireland (£539m). European Union countries account for 40% of UK advertising, market research and opinion polling services exports.\n\nAnother AA report from this year, Powering Up UK Advertising Exports, anchored around research carried out by industry think tank Credos, found that creativity, quality of talent and global reputation were principal drivers for the years of growth. The report found that international clients view UK advertising as strategic and business savvy, beyond the reach of other markets. One survey respondent was quoted as saying that “the diverse talent pool in the UK leads to quality conceptual creatives who have an ability to tap into core human traits, resonating globally”.\n\nThe AA readily admits that estimating the export value for 2020 will be no easy task, given the constraints and challenges of Covid, but remains cautiously upbeat about the industry’s relatively good health and confident that any decrease will quickly be offset by a more positive bounceback figure for 2021.\n\nHowever, it does add that the Brexit factor is the great unknown in all of this, with the various knock-on effects regarding EU business travel yet to be fully realised and data from the Office for National Statistics unavailable until later on next year."
