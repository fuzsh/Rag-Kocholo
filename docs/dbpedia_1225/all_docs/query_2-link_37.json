Approximately 2 million tonnes of the region's annual confectionery production are exported outside the European Union, according to Chocolate Biscuit and Confectionery of Europe (CAOBISCO). The demand for gluten-free cookies is also rising as concerns regarding lactose intolerance and other glutamic problems grow in developed European nations. Another significant driver of the region's increasing demand for cookies is the rise in per capita income, which has led to the increase in the purchasing capacity of consumers in that region. The market for cookies in the area is expected to develop as a result of all these factors.\n\nHowever, it is anticipated that the North American area would have good expansion in the global cookie industry. Due to the rising worries about poor diet, obesity, and other health issues, an increasing number of Americans are choosing better eating options. This aspect has increased the market share of healthy cookies in the area, particularly in the United States. To increase their appeal among consumers, major businesses are introducing cookies made with natural components, such as whole grains, low-calorie sweeteners, and wheat.\n\nGlobal Cookies Market By Geography, 2022-2028\n\nLargest\n\nFastest\n\nTo know more about the market opportunities by region and country, click here to\n\nBuy The Complete Report\n\nCookies Market Dynamics\n\nRequest Free Customization of this report to help us to meet your business objectives.\n\nCookies Market Competitive Landscape\n\nCookies Key Market Trends\n\nCookies Market SkyQuest Analysis\n\nSkyQuestâ€™s ABIRAW (Advanced Business Intelligence, Research & Analysis Wing) is our Business Information Services team that Collects, Collates, Co-relates and Analyzes the Data collected by means of Primary Exploratory Research backed by the robust Secondary Desk research.\n\nAccording to the analysis, the global cookies market is currently led by countries in the European region, due to the volume of confectionary items produced in the region and exported to other nations.
