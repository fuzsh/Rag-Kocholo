        "text": "Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. So let me just jump in straight off to Slide #3. Good news on the consumption front. The quarter has been -- the growths on value and volume have been about the same at about 6.6%, 6.5% for the FMCG industry. The rural growths are starting to come back, which is -- which had been lagging, urban, for some time, and that's something which will help us overall get better growth. So the reason for the same are obviously better monsoons, moderate inflationary conditions as well as employment, some employment data, which is showing that rural employment is at an all-time high. So things are looking a little better, still not out of the woods completely, but definitely better than what -- where we were. Going to the next slide, the performance scorecard for Britannia. We did -- our revenue from operations were INR 4,130 crores, which was a 4% growth on a 12-month basis and a 13% growth on a 24-month basis. Our operating profit was at 16.5%, which was at a 10% growth on a 12-month basis and a 51% growth on a 24-month basis. So I would say good results in the current environment. Our market share on the next slide is also looking good. Our trend continues. We've continued to gain share, and we are hoping that we will be able to keep that track going. Our strategic pillars, which you're all aware of, distribution, marketing, innovation, growing adjacencies, cost efficiencies and sustainabilities. Let me take you through each one of these and where we stand on these. So driving efficiencies in distribution, our direct reach is now at 28.2 lakh outlets. Our uptick in rural distribution, we've gone up to 30,000 rural distributors. And if you look at our rural performance, it's a better performance than what it is for urban, which is good. As we've seen, there's a little revival in the rural economy as well. So we are keeping our credo of going -- getting equal share in rural as we have in urban. As you know that we have a higher share in urban than we have in rural. So we are keeping that going. And the next slide is about our sales transformation. This is basically a complicated chart, but you've just got to remember what we are trying to do. We are trying to do real-time data for all of us in the system. What this has done is this has increased the face time of the distributor salesmen, which is up 42%. So they are on their handheld, and they are getting real-time data all the time. All our outlets, which are directly handled through our distributors are geo-tagged. And as a result of that, the time spent in the market by our salesmen is also up. If you were to look at what we are doing on our Route to Market, which is going on with Bain, basically, what we are trying to do is leverage our high potential outlets to make sure that all of our key categories and SKUs are available in these outlets. We are looking at upscaling our salesmen capability in these high potential outlets.\n\nWe're also looking at upgrading technology for better productivity. And there will be an increase in the number of salesmen, which is mentioned as increased feet on street. Now we've already started -- the project has been on for about a couple of months. And we've already started some pilots in the top metros to validate what is going to work for us in the long run. We are banking a lot on this project, and hopefully, this will be able to give us great results in the future. On the next slide, which is Slide #10. If you look at our capabilities in organized channels, if you look at the first quarter, we've seen much higher growths for our adjacency business as well as our new businesses in the modern trade or the organized trade channel. The building blocks of which have been a very agile supply chain, which is focusing on fill rates; a modern marketing, which is based on social media, digital, et cetera; upskilling of our salesmen; and best-in-class service levels for our customers. Next slide, Slide #11, building -- we've been continuously building on our business as far as e-commerce is concerned. We know that it's an important channel, albeit small for us right now, but it's a test bed for innovation and new categories. We can do precision targeting with real-time consumers, product ideas, which are based on social media trends as well as consumer feedback and reviews and ratings. It's a channel which can be used by us for a lot of our current premium products as well as making sure that we do products, which are actually what the consumers are looking for. And this is giving us good results. We've been seeing great growths in this channel. So hopefully, it's today at -- we been at about, what, 4% of our total sales?\n\nNo, absolutely. So we are not interested in the B2B business because that disrupts our distribution efforts. So we are purely concentrating on the B2C business, as Vipin said.\n\nOkay. Moving on to the next slide, which is Slide #12. We've made some sustained investments in brands to drive consumer engagement. As you know that the biscuits brand was a slightly more traditional marketing category, what we are trying to do is we are trying to make it a little more alive with more, let's say, interesting products as well as interesting marketing ideas, which are more alive to what's happening today. And we've done that with Britannia Khao, Paris Jao on some of our brands. We also did it with Jim Jam Pops, where we launched the victory biscuit when the Indian cricket team won the T20 World Cup in Bombay. And similarly, a lot of other interesting initiatives which the marketing team has led on Good Day, on Little Hearts, NutriChoice. Next slide, some of the other marketing initiatives and adjacency areas. We've had Rusk advertising on the Jio Mobile app. We've had the Cow Corner for Winkin' Cow during IPL, which was a very interesting idea. And other IPL campaigns, which we did on some of our other products, and tactical consumer promotions, which we run across our portfolio of brands. Next slide, Slide #14. We've been recognized for the efforts because Amit and team have brought a differentiation to the way we've looked at marketing, and they've been rewarded by -- they got the Brand of the Year in the Shark Awards. Out of home, we were the #1 brand. In home, we were the #2 brand, et cetera. It's good fuel for the team that's doing so much of interesting work. And the next slide is on innovation. We've launched Pure Magic Stars, which is a very interesting product. And we've -- the jury is still out. It's just launched in the market, so it will take some time for us to tell you how it's doing, but it's been really appreciated by consumers. We've also launched 5050 Golmaal, which is a variant of the earlier product that we launched. This is a butter garlic. And these are all doing well. The in-market products are the base Golmaal, JimJam Pops and Butter Jeera, which was done only for modern trade, and these are doing quite well. We've got a very robust innovation pipeline, which will cater to the regional preferences and drive premiumization within our portfolio. Next slide is on adjacency. We have seen a resurgence in our adjacency business. The Fudge It product has been doing extremely well. Croissants have been doing very well. Our Rusk and Millet Breads have also done well for us. Similarly, on cheese and on drinks, drinks have been a good story for us, especially Lassi. So we've been doing better than what we were doing. Still a lot of hard work for us to be able to get to 1.5x the growth of the base business, but we are working towards that. Our international business has also been doing really well with good profitability. And Nepal is a validation of our strategy of seeding products and then establishing our manufacturing footprint in the country. This business used to be a INR 20 crore business. And today, we are at what, Venkat, about INR 180 crores in Nepal?\n\nINR 170 crores, INR 180 crores business in Nepal. So we are doing well, and there are some other countries where we are also looking at the same strategy to be able to establish ourselves so that we don't burn the bank. At the same time, we established a footprint in these countries through a slow and steady strategy. On our cost leadership across verticals, our strategy remains the same, truck upsizing with full utilization, distance traveled by our products, digital adoption, renewable energy, fuel consumption and our line throughput. And in '24-'25, we will be at 8 times what we started in '13-'14. So this continues. We continue to target 2% of cost efficiencies every year. Moving on, just to give you an idea of our manufacturing footprint. It's a very interesting footprint with 54 factories located across the country, 16 of these are our own factories, which give us 65% of the total requirement that we have across the country. We have third-party factories, which are 38. We've got 154 manufacturing lines, out of which 81 are in our own factories with annual capacity I've already spoken about. Now we are -- we've got a mega food factory, which is in Ranjangaon. We've got fully integrated factories in -- which have got 4-plus lines and have more than 1 category. And then we've got small factories, which give us the ability to be nimble. So we've got a very robust and a very solid manufacturing footprint, which is holding us in good stead in the current times. Just a quick look at Ranjangaon Dairy operations. So we are now collecting about 300,000 liters of milk in Ranjangaon. Out of which, 90,000 liters -- and we are scaling up this 90,000 every month, 90,000 is directly through our partner farmers. These are about 3,300 farmers across 105 villages with 70 milk collection centers that are created in and around our factory. We do a lot of developmental initiatives, which is farmer training programs, animal health camps. And we also provide quality fodder and seeds to our farmer friends. Our program results have been that we've improved farmer retention to now 95%. Our farmer yields are up 13% over the last 2 years, and we've had improved quality of milk that we receive at our factory. We've now got a processed cheese plant, which is commercialized. We are doing cheese blocks. We are doing cheese cubes, cheddar cheese. We're doing slices. So -- and we are looking -- we've got a quick scale-up across formats and our product quality today is much better than what it is. We are working on making sure that we leverage the technology that we put in our factory to get much better productivity than what we've got in the past. I just wanted to give you an idea of this operation because I thought it was important. Next slide is on ESG. You know the 4 building blocks that we have: people, growth, governance and resources. We continue to work on these. We've been recognized as the best 3 sustainability initiatives of the year in 2024 at the Global CSR & ESG Awards, which was conducted by Brand Honchos. The key initiatives included water stewardship program, sustainable packaging, employee wellbeing and development, community development programs. And we also were -- we also did Har Pocket Ab Dustbin program. The campaign was in Q1 of this year. And we continue to do our employee volunteering program, which is on plastic waste collection across our factories and across our offices. We won some awards, which I won't dwell on, but I must compliment the ESG team from -- bringing us from being at the bottom of the pack to where we are today, and we hope to be right at the top in this in times to come.\n\nNow getting to cost and profitability. Slide #22, commodity costs are going up marginally. Flour costs are up. Sugar costs are up. Palm is the balancing factor. Cocoa is through the roof. The cocoa costs are completely through the roof. Laminate costs, so the 2 -- 3 costs which are balancing out flour, sugar and cocoa are palm, laminates and corrugated boxes. One that is not here is also milk. While milk powder is okay until now, but milk costs are up. So in times to come, SMP costs will also be up. So we are seeing a trend of prices going up marginally. But these are -- this is inflation that we can manage, and we are hoping that it remains within that manageable range. Next slide is on what we are looking at. We are stepping up investments on brand and innovation. We've actioned pricing actions wherever necessary to drive -- to make sure that we remain competitive, and we've also delivered cost efficiencies across all our functions. We are closely monitoring the commodity situation, and we are assessing its impact. I think it's important that we balance the commodity increases as well as the competitive pricing actions, and we've done it quite well until now. Our strategy will remain to focus on driving market share and our top line growth, which have been evading the Indian FMCG industry for some time.\n\nGetting to the financial results. So I've already spoken about this. So we've grown 4% as far as topline is concerned on a 12-month growth basis and 13% on a 24-month basis, with a revenue of INR 4,130 crores.\n\nNext slide is on operating profit. Operating profits are at INR 680 crores, which is 16.5% of our net revenue. Growth of 10% on a 12-month basis and a 51% on a 24-month basis. Getting to the ratios, net sales, up 4%; operating profit, up 10%; profit before tax, up 13%; profit after tax, up 14%. These are all before exceptional items. And the ratios are at the bottom. Profit from operations, 16.5%. Profit before tax, also at 16.5%. And PAT at 12.2%. So that's all I have for you. Let me open the doors for questions. Over to you.\n\nYes. So, Shirish, there are 2 parts to the slide. The left side is done internally. For the last 5 years, we've been building this backbone, which is right from our distributor management system to handheld, which is today AI-driven, then we have got a continuous replenishment system, which connects to the depot. And then there is geo-tag and geo-fence.\n\nAnd then even in rural, what we have done is that more than 60% of orders are today captured through the digital app, right? So this is what we have done internally. 8, 9 months back, the feeling was that we have done this internally, but we need to get this outside in perspective. And that is where Bain & Co was on-boarded, right? So we -- so like Varun mentioned, previously, it's only been 2 months. We have started slicing the data. We are discovering that there is a lot of scope, especially in the top end of the book, and the pilots have just started. So today, no shift attributable to this new project has come. What we are saying is that in this quarter, next 2, 3 months, we are piloting different concepts, and probably the tangible gains will start coming in quarter 4 of this year or quarter 1 of FY '26. So right now, this is -- because this is a very large project, there is a lot of data, there's a lot of market types. So the next 2, 3 months is when we are doing a lot of pilots, testing out what's the concept and then blueprinting and then will be the phase of scale-up and getting the tangible benefits."
