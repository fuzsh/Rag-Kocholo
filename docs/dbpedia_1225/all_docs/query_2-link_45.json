        "text": "The global biscuit market was evaluated at US$125.001 billion in 2020, growing at a CAGR of 5.81% reaching the market size of US$185.553 billion by 2027.\n\nThe rising trend of healthy snacking, increasing per capita food consumption, and the convenience imparted by the biscuit's innovative packaging are the primary drivers of the global biscuit market’s growth during the forecast period. Additionally, the rising health awareness and its acknowledgement by the market players are incentivizing them to invest more in product innovation and development, thereby facilitating the expansion of their product portfolio, thus, aiding in the global biscuit market’s growth. The aforementioned has also emerged as integral to competition among industry players, which further allows them to focus on enhancing the efficacy of their entire value chain. With regards to the APAC region, it should be noted that consumers of the emerging economies are proactively willing to move away from their known brands and experiment with regional flavours as well as healthier options, as exemplified by the launch of high-protein biscuits, addressing the need for more protein-based food and drinks by companies like Hershey and United Biscuit. The other health value benefit is digestion, which is being increasingly offered by digestive biscuits. This gradual shift in consumer preferences is also being captured by biscuit market players' tactful dissemination of information about their nutritional ingredients, thereby increasing their brand visibility. Furthermore, as consumers are looking forward to less processed food, the players in the biscuit market are increasingly investing in the inclusion of natural ingredients.\n\nMoreover, aspects such as the increasing availability of disposable income due to the growing middle-income group along with expanding urban aspirations are fueling the premiumization of low-calorie indulgences that are increasingly being exemplified by products with inclusions such as nuts, fruits, and so on. In certain established markets, such as those in the occident, where the association of biscuits with tea and coffee is unbreakable, consumers are less likely to experiment and experience a new sensation and are more likely to settle for the most dependable products that they are familiar with. This has also led to biscuit makers attempting to shift the consumers away from their regular preferences with out-of-the-box offerings, as exemplified by Pladis’ Flipz, launched in June 2019 which is milk and dark chocolate pretzels designed to capitalize on the growing appetite for sweet and savory combinations. Further, as an effect of changing lifestyle that is ubiquitous consumers are inclined towards biscuits that offer the conveniences of bite-sized treats that deliver the ultimate taste. To this end, Mondelez launched their Joy fills the same year, in August. Along the same lines, the launch of Choco Leibniz Snack Packs and Choco Moments range by Bahlsen GmbH & Co. KG. further reaffirms the endeavour by market players to appeal to customers with new ideas who are intrinsically driven by habits. The launch was coupled with a media campaign, in-store sampling, and smartphone app coupons to facilitate the consumer-habit disruption close to the point of purchase, among others, since the majority of biscuit purchases are unplanned.\n\nWhile the above provides a panoptic view of the consumers’ purchasing proclivities and the market players’ innovative endeavours, the biscuit market segment has witnessed a plethora of development in recent times. In May 2018, it was reported that private-label manufacturer Biscuit International, owned by French private equity firm Qualium Investissement, had acquired Northumbrian Fine Foods (NFF), the UK’s largest gluten- and milk-free sweet biscuit manufacturer, from CriSeren Foods to expand its product offering and geographical footprint in both the UK and EU. In September 2019, it was reported that Burton’s Biscuit Company had acquired Paterson Arran, one of Scotland’s leading independent food companies, broadening its product portfolio as well as sustaining its growing presence in the biscuit market. This is the second major acquisition by the Burtons during 2019. It was succeeded by the acquisition of Thomas Fudge’s, the premium sweet and savory branded and own-label biscuit manufacturer, which bakes Marmite products under license, from private equity rm Livingbridge. In January 2020, it was reported that Burton’s Biscuit Company had launched Maltesers Biscuits. Although faced with tough competition from other kinds of snacks, biscuits are recognized and appreciated for their ability to satiate both yearnings and hunger. Through innovative formulation and premiumization, the market for biscuits will be poised to attract more consumers, resulting in healthy growth during the forecast period.\n\nEurope is anticipated to hold the largest market share\n\nThe industry is fueled by consumers in Europe's growing need for quick snacks made with nutritious components. According to the type of biscuit and the size of the box, consumers in the UK and Germany are also motivated by indulgence. The consumption of healthy biscuits in the area is rising as a result of the constant introduction of a wide variety of new goods, including morning biscuits, \"thins,\" free-from alternatives, and healthy biscuits. Additionally, Mondelez International launched a Cadbury-branded biscuit with the choice of eating the product warm straight out of the microwave as part of its strategy to target the luxury biscuits segment in the United Kingdom.\n\nRecent Developments and expansions\n\nIn June 2020, Arnott’s Biscuits Limited launched three products namely: Lamington flavoured Iced VoVo; Mud Cake flavoured Shortbread Cream, and Salted Caramel Tart flavoured Scotch Finger, which has been Australia’s favourite desserts.\n\nIn May 2020, Edita Food Industries S.A.E launched a new product, Oniro to create a new revenue stream for the company, among others\n\nThe takeover of Gourmet Food Holdings Pty Ltd, an Australian food firm that sells high-end crackers and biscuits, was announced by Mondelez International in 2021. Mondelez hopes to expand its leadership in snacking in New Zealand and Australia through this acquisition.\n\nUnder the Club & Town House brands, Kellogg's debuted two thinner and crispier cracker varieties in 2021. Town House Dipping Thins in Sea Salt & Black Pepper as well as Club Crisps in Sea Salt and Ranch taste were introduced by the brand.\n\nCOVID-19 Impact on Global Biscuits Market\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a positive impact on the biscuit market. The disruption of supply chains had a detrimental effect on the market as it forced businesses to close their plants or operate with fewer employees, which reduced production. However, consumers stockpiling products with a long shelf life, such as biscuits, led to an increase in product demand. The demand for wholesome oat- and nut-based biscuits was nevertheless fueled by consumers seeking out quick, wholesome snack options.\n\nGlobal Biscuits Market Scope:\n\nReport Metric Details Market size value in 2020 US$125.001 billion Market size value in 2027 US$185.553 billion Growth Rate CAGR of 5.81% from 2020 to 2027 Base year 2020 Forecast period 2022–2027 Forecast Unit (Value) USD Billion Segments covered Type, Distribution Chanel, And Geography Regions covered North America, South America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific Companies covered Mondelez International, Inc., Arnott’s Biscuits Limited, Bahlsen GmbH & Co.
