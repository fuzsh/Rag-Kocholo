        "text": "In 2015, Britannia Industries - India's most recognized biscuit brand - had overtaken Parle as the market leader in the biscuit (cookie) category and faced stiff competition from Parle, ITC's Sunfeast, and many regional competitors. Britannia had to devise a strategy that would allow it to further consolidate its leadership position without losing market share; increasing the price alone was not an option in this highly competitive market. What could Britannia do to remain India's number-one biscuit maker? How could it stay ahead of its rivals in the area of product innovation? In a market swamped with near-identical product packaging, it had to devise a strategy that would help it avoid an identity crisis and make it the consumer's first choice. The company's senior management needed to chart a clear roadmap for the future.\n\nSandeep Puri is affiliated with Institute of Management Technology, Ghaziabad."
