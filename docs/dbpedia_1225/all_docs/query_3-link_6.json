        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe company is well placed to sustain growth and is confident of addressing the evolving situation with its wide distribution network, intrinsic brand strengths, innovation and technology capabilities and cost efficiency programmes, it said in its latest annual report.\n\nThe pandemic has brought significant shifts in consumer preferences and behaviours, including the growth of online business channels, which are likely to strengthen and present new opportunities for food business in future, according to Britannia Industries. The company is well placed to sustain growth and is confident of addressing the evolving situation with its wide distribution network, intrinsic brand strengths, innovation and technology capabilities and cost efficiency programmes, it said in its latest annual report.\n\n\"Significant shifts in consumer preferences and behaviours, growth of online business channels and higher demand for staples and value products are some of the changes brought about by the pandemic.
