Group: 10, Sec: E :Member list: Suraj poddar (13202054) Sarthak Hota (13202040) Abhinav Tushant (1018002) Mohadev Mishra (13202024) Sumit Kumar Mula (1019029) JYOTI RANJAN MOHAPATRA (13202016)\n\n2. Strategic Analysis Sec- E, Group- 10 Origin & Governance: In 1892, Britannia industries ltd. was started in Kolkata with an initial investment of Rs. 295. Britannia's business was flourishing with growing market. In 1978, Indian shareholding crossed 60%. 1983, it crossed the Rs. 100 crores revenue mark. In 1997, the company unveiled its new corporate identity - \"Eat Healthy, Think Better\" - and made its first foray into the dairy products market. The 50-50 Maska-Chaska became India's most successful product launch. In 2002, it formed a joint venture with Fonterra, the world's second largest Dairy Company. Having succeeded in garnering the trust of almost one-third of India's population and a strong management at the helm means Britannia will continue to dream big on its path of innovation and quality. Products & Services: It has wide range of ready to eat products. Britannia does its business on Bakery (Biscuit, Cake and Bread) and Dairy (Cheese, Butter and Milk) products. About 90% of Britannia’s annual revenue comes from biscuits and 10% from Dairy products. The brands in Britannia are VitaMarieGold, Tiger, Nutrichoice Junior, Good day, 50-50, Treat, Pure Magic, Milk Bikis, Good Day, Bourbon, Thin Arrowroot, Nice, Little Hearts, pure magic, flavoured Yoghurt, Dairy Whitener cookies and Actimind. Performance: Between 1998 and 2001, the company's sales grew at a compound annual rate of 16% against the market, and operating profits reached 18%. About 2007, the company has been growing at 27% a year, compared to the industry's growth rate of 20%. In FY 2013-14, a challenging economic environment and intensely competitive market, Profit from Operations increased 69.6%, from 314.45 crores to 533.24 crores with a revenue growth of 12%. Company focused on profitability, capital productivity and working capital management to generate cash flow from operating activities of 614.51 crores compared to 272.01 crores in the previous year. Earnings per share increased to 30.87 from ` 19.57 in the previous year. Opportunities: Indian consumer with constantly expanding wallet and higher aspiration constitutes the largest opportunity for your Company. Second opportunity lies in the constant force of technology change which will provides Company to compete and to improve efficiency & productivity e.g. Biomass and Solar energy. The opportunities before the company are to increase its share in the dairy industry, expansion in foreign lands, product line extension. Challenges: Entry of new players, rise in cost of raw materials and both domestic & international seeking a share of the growing industry and willing to invest for the long term is a key threat. Opportunities are equally visible competitors of your Company and that constitutes the primary threat. As opportunities in rest of the world diminish, India will become one of the main sources of growth for many international players and that will pose a threat to your Company. Outlook: Company estimates growth to be 8%-10% which is lower than growth rates of earlier years. While this presents a revenue challenge, Company expects to be challenged on the cost front on account of commodity prices and in some case even by regulatory environment in areas such as excise and depreciation. In this environment, your Company will focus on the fundamental building blocks of business viz. width / depth and quality of distribution, efficiency in operations, consistent and high product quality, aggressive support for its brands and nurturing a strong and cohesive team to achieve faster than market and profitable growth. In the longer-term your Company expects the growth to track back to 12%-15% level. 1\n\n3.

Value Britannia has acquired a reputation of quality and value. It has also succeeded in garnering the trust of almost one-third of one billion population. Imitation Britannia faces a tough competition with its competitors as new imitated products are available, price war is there, therefore, Britannia always try to build its quality and deliver value to the customers.

Strategic Analysis Sec- E, Group- 10 Internal and External Analysis of Britannia Industries Bakery industry in India today has an important place in the industrial map of the country. With rapid growth, improvement in standard of living, westernization, increase in spending power, changing eating habits of people and increased transition from the unorganized sector to organized sector, bakery products have gained immense popularity among masses. Industry Structure The bakery industry is mainly popular in the southern part of India like the states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Around 60% of production takes place in the unorganized sector. There are around 2 million unorganized bakeries in the country, comprising small bakery units, cottage and household type manufacturing. The organized sector consists of large, medium and small-scale manufacturers producing bread and biscuits. The market size for the industry in India is expected to reach 47 billion by 2015 with a growth of 50 to 60 % per annum. Industry Segments Bread: About 50% of this segment is organized and is growing at a rapid rate of 14-15% per year. The estimated size of the organized bread industry is about 50 billion. Biscuit: The biscuit market in India is estimated to be $100 billion and the industry is also gearing up to aggressively tap the medium and premium segment within the country. Biscuit industry in India in the organized sector produces around 60% of the total production, the balance 40% being contributed by the unorganized bakeries. Mainly in rural India the biscuit consumed by consumer is from unorganised sector. PORTER'S FIVE FORCES MODEL: Competitor Rivalry: BIL has a market share of 38% and has been growing at 27%, compared to the industry growth rate of 20% Battle-scarred Britannia on expansion spree, Business Standard and has many competitors based on the nature of product. Parle and ITC (Sunfeast) pose a great competition to BIL. BIL earning major of its income from the biscuits, and Parle and ITC are the other major players in biscuit market. BIL is also into the production of dairy products, where the two major players in market are Amul and Nestle. Amul is the leader in the dairy industry. There is also a high level of competition from the unorganized baking sector. Overall rivalry is high. Threat of New Entrants: The entry on a small scale dairy industry and in the unorganized baking sector is easy. But on the other hand to enter the large scale dairy industry and organized baking sector a huge amount of investment is required in terms acquiring assets and to establish supply and distribution chains. 5\n\n7. Strategic Analysis Sec- E, Group- 10 Government regulations pertaining to food norms and others may also seem to be unattractive. Looking at the latest trends, the bakery industry is expected to earn huge revenues which might attract new entrants. So the threat of new entrants is moderate. Threat of Substitutes: Savoury snacks, crisps, cereals, fruits and other fast food can be substituted for biscuits. Dairy products are dubious to be replacing with other products as they key ingredients of majority of people’s diet. So the threat is a very moderate threat of substitutes. Buyer’s Power: The buyer’s of these products could be a retailer or the consumer. Both the dairy and bakery industry are price sensitive, so a little increase in price might lead the consumer to shift other brand or product. So the buyer’s power is calculated to be very strong. Supplier’s Power: The major supplies for a bakery industry include wheat, sugar and other agriculture products. And the major supplies for dairy products are milk. It’s difficult to bargain with the suppliers of the above mentioned inputs as the price of these inputs is majorly influenced by the production of these inputs. The prices tend to be high as the demand for these products is rising at much faster rate than supply. The secondary supplies include the packaging material. The secondary supplies can be easily substituted with the low-cost ones to save on cost. Overall the supplier’s power is assessed to be moderate. Conclusion of Five Forces Analysis: There is an existence of major players in the market with a moderate level of threat of new entrants and substitutes. The supplier’s power is moderate but the buyer’s power is measured to be strong. So the rivalry is suggested to be high. PESTEL ANALYSIS Political: Exemption on Customs Duty on Sugar Raw Material Import: Due to the shortage in the production of sugar the deadline for the exemption on customs duty on raw sugar imports has been extended. Exemption on customs duty will help in purchasing sugar at lower cost, which in turn will control the cost of production. VAT on Biscuits: The VAT of 12.5% on Biscuits. Price of the biscuits might need to be increased due to the high VAT rates which may result in switch of brands due to the highly competitive market. 6\n\n8. Strategic Analysis Sec- E, Group- 10 Removal of Import Duty on Dairy Products: The whole-sale price based inflation indicates that the milk prices have moved up by 14.73% over the last year. The imports at cheaper rate would help in reduce the cost factor for dairy products. Incentives to Build Cold Storage Facilities: Wastage of food items due to lack of cold storage facilities lead to a loss of Rs. 500 billion every year. The government announces schemes and incentives to attract investments in cold storage warehousing would help in preserving products better and reduce the wastage cost. Economical Shortage of Milk: Even though the milk production has risen by 4.6% compound annual average growth rate, it still cannot match up with the increasing demand. Price of milk increased by 12.6% to 13.6% . This can cause an increase in the input cost for the dairy products and which in turn can lead to hike in price or lower profit margins. Globalization: Globalization a universal phenomenon is affecting each and every industry. This can serve as an opportunity to expand the business to a global level but on the other hand there is a threat of new entrants from international market. Requirements for Logistics: Logistics in India suffer due to the poor infrastructure and other limitations. Sophisticated third party logistics system will help in proper supply chain management and on time delivery of goods, which help in maintaining the shelf life of goods on meeting the demand on time. Social: Need for Healthy Eating Habits: Studies say that Indians are more prone to Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), which is the major independent risk factor causing Cardiovascular diseases, due to the smaller calibred arteries found in Indians. This suggests that Indians should move towards more healthy food and diet. This could be a new area to explore for Britannia with its new health associated products like Nuti-Choice biscuits and Actimind flavoured milk. Problems with Cloned Livestock: Cloned animals are supposed to be suffering from large-offspring syndrome. The mother cows face a problem in giving birth to the cloned animals as they are larger than normal. Also these cloned animals suffer from health which might make unsafe to consume the produce from them. Technological: Cloning of Livestock: India, a late entrant in cloning research, is now moving with a great pace in cloning technology. ‘Hand guided cloning technique’, a technique very different from the conservative cloning practice has been a successful venture. New Age Packaging: The new packaging systems help in protecting food from micro-organisms by creating shelter layer. It uses new technologies like oxygen scavenging function, atmosphere control, biodegrability etc. and is low cost. 7\n\n9. Strategic Analysis Sec- E, Group- 10 Environmental: Change in the Climatic Conditions: Climate plays an important role in the agriculture process. The change in the rainfall pattern has been a matter of concern now in India. The agriculture sector in areas which are monsoon dependent suffered badly due to the change in the rainfall pattern. The sector suffered a huge loss in terms of total output. The loss in crop will affect the input supply and this might delay or cause problems in the production. So the industry might not be able to meet the demands resulting in the loss of customers. Legal: Raising the Norms for the Probiotic Food: There is a need for setting the standards for probiotic food. Clinical tests should be conducted on the probiotic foods before they could reach the market for sale. The Indian Council of Medical and Research has submitted the proposal for the same to the government. Strict norms will help in raising the quality standards but on the other hand the cost and time of production might subsequently increase. Identifying key success factors WHAT DO CUSTOMERS WANT?

Strategic Analysis Sec- E, Group- 10 Style: The leadership approach of top management and the Britannia company's overall operating approach. The Challenges and the Opportunities Britannia faced While the fast-moving consumer goods sector has not had it as bad as others, nevertheless has been challenging. Battling costs rising and hurt consumer demand, the company have been hard pressed to balance growth in sales and profit. The challenges faced by Britannia: Britannia one of the India’s largest biscuit brands held market share of 38% in terms of value. Indian biscuit industry, the third largest producer of the biscuit in the world was highly under- penetrated. This presented numerous growth opportunities to new as well as existing players. Apart from the presence of big players like ITC foods, Parle, the local manufacturers of biscuits and other Indian snacks had been raising concerns for Britannia. Besides competition Britannia faced critical challenges due to declining margins in the biscuit industry due to increase costs of raw materials. The biscuits-to-breads company Britannia finds itself staring at a new challenge, which is employee attrition. Several middle and senior level managers are choosing to exit and the company is struggling to find replacements. Actual attrition rate (YTD) is around 25% (which has a seasonal bias) and there is no change in the pattern from previous years. This is typically the time when post- appraisal, some people from all the companies leave and settle in various other ones. The attrition rate on annual basis is likely to be near long-term averages. The opportunities the company have: The company adopted a three-pronged approach to overcome the challenges it faced. It focused on driving innovation by producing new high-margin, value-added product offerings, and boosting revenue by introducing differentiated brands with differential pricing and restructuring costs through improving operational efficiencies throughout the value chain.

Strategic Analysis Sec- E, Group- 10 Conclusion Britannia Industries limited is the India's largest manufacturing company covering all sectors of bakery products and diversifying into dairy products market. Developing and generating trust amongst its consumer base and delivering quality products had made it success for Britannia. As we see the strategic direction of the company, today there is a neck-to-neck competition between the competitors in the market. Not only the manufacturers but also the home made bakery products is also giving a tough competition to Britannia. Imitation of the product is very fast in the FMCG industry. And companies like ITC, Parle G, are giving direct competition in terms of new product development, market coverage, and gaining more market share. In this scenario Britannia should adopt a Push strategy of marketing and on the same time provide the retailers and distributors with more percentage of margin as compared to the competitors margin so that the retailers also try to sell the products in the market. Research and Development is also one of the major concern and should be taken over on a continuous basis as the customers taste and preference and buying behaviour is changing on a fast pace. Britannia should join hands with the Government initiatives and support the activities to gain a good image and presence in the mindset of every Indian consumer. Britannia will surely be able to fulfil its desired mission of making every third person the consumer of Britannia if it follows the path of innovation and diversification. 12"
