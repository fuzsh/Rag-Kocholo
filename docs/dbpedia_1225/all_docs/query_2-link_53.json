Market players are introducing biscuits in different flavors, shapes, and creams targeted toward children. For instance, in April 2022, Koobi launched the 5D Fun Chocolate and Milk Biscuits in Malaysia. These animal-shaped biscuits, available in chocolate and milk flavors, aid in children's learning and cognitive capacities. Additionally, the recent trend of on-the-go food products has become a significant factor driving the market. This trend is one of the essential considerations for customers when purchasing food products. In addition, frequent launches of new formulations in the primary outcome, such as low-fat, gluten-free, low-carb, organic, and high-fiber biscuits, to attract consumers are expected to fuel the market growth.\n\nRegarding segmentation by type, sweet biscuits are the fastest-growing sub-segment owing to their taste and incorporation of healthy ingredients. Moreover, fortified biscuit products infused and replaced with oats, millet, and other nutritional ingredients instead of wheat are gaining popularity in the market. This is mainly due to the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and other digestive troubles that can be reduced with proper diet.\n\nCompanies actively participate in in-store promotions, emphasizing new product development and marketing communications. These promotions, such as extra-value packs or buy one, get one free deal, primarily aim to help consumers save money. Moreover, online sales of biscuit products are rapidly growing in terms of distribution channels, attracting numerous vertical specialists like Amazon, Walmart, Carrefour, and others who are capitalizing on the increasing e-retail trend.\n\nBiscuits Industry Overview\n\nThe global biscuits market is highly fragmented in nature, with various players operating in the market.
