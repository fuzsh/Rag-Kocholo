He then moved to Lafayette, LA and worked for a year with Zydeco king Clifton Chenier and his Red Hot Louisiana Band with whom he recorded the Grammy Award winning Album, “I’m Here” in 1980. Relocating to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1981 he continued to freelance and eventually teamed up with the legendary singer and pianist Charles Brown.\n\nDanny served as guitarist and musical director for Charles Brown from 1987 until Brown’s death in 1999. He has played on numerous CD’s and sessions with Charles Brown, Clifton Chenier, Bonnie Raitt, John Lee Hooker, Van Morrison, Ruth Brown, Etta Jones, John Clayton, Teddy Edwards, Gerald Wilson, Donald Fagen, Dr. John, Little Milton Campbell, John Hammond Jr. and many others. Danny is the featured guitarist on the Van Morrison produced John Lee Hooker album, “Don’t Look Back” which won two Grammy Awards – one for Best Traditional Blues Recording, and the other for Best Collaboration, Van Morrison and John Lee Hooker. He has played for President Clinton’s first Inaugural Ball, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, numerous jazz festivals throughout the US and Europe, several tours to New Zealand with great artists like Robben Ford, Charlie Musslewhite, Duke Robillard and Bettye LaVette. Television appearances include the Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\n\nDanny wrote the film score to the Scott Silver directed motion picture ‘johns’ for which he and Charles Brown composed music, and for which he composed the title song, “The Promised Land.” The movie stars David Arquette, Lukas Haas and Keith David. He keeps up a busy schedule touring and performing most recently with Tom Rigney, Barbara Morrison, Maria Muldaur and others. And he is presently teaching courses at The Jazzschool in Berkeley, California.\n\nGlenn Walters sang lead for two sensational Bay area bands, The Hoodoo Rhythm Devils and the Zasu Pitts Memorial Orhestra. The San Francisco Examiner called his voice “as warm, furry and comforting as a mink coat. You just wanna wrap it around you.”\n\nBassist Dewayne Pate graduated from the Musicians Institute in Los Angeles, moved North, and has since worked with a wide array of artists including Huey Lewis & The News, Box Scaggs, Maria Muldaur, ROBBEN Ford, Arturo Sandoval, and Tower of Power. Reviewer Andrew Gilbert called his album Melting Pot “an impressive array of grooves.”"
