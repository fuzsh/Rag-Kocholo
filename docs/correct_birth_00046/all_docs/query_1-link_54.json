        "text": "For a town of fewer than 100,000 residents in southwest Georgia, Albany has produced its share of influential musicians. \"The Genius\" American music icon Ray Charles was born here, as was Big Band–era trumpeter Harry James, jazz guitarist Russell Malone, top country songwriter Dallas Davidson, Shawn Jay and Smoke of hip-hop duo Field Mob and \"American Idol\" winner Phillip Phillips. From the Albany Chorale to the award-winning sounds of the Albany State University Marching Rams, the mighty gospel of church choirs like Voices of Zion and local groups like Evan Barber and the Dead Gamblers and 7th High Band, music is ingrained in the community of \"The Good Life City.\"\n\nExplore the rich history and current music scene in Albany at these music venues and points of interest.\n\nWhere to Enjoy Live Music in Albany\n\nAlbany Civic Center Complex\n\nA variety of concerts and musical events are held throughout the year in the three venues that make up the Albany Civic Center Complex. For bigger shows, the Civic Center has more than 10,000 seats, while Veterans Park Amphitheatre seats 2,500 outdoors. In addition to hosting smaller shows, the 965-seat Albany Municipal Auditorium is home of the Albany Symphony Orchestra.\n\nAlbany Symphony Orchestra\n\nSince 1965, the Albany Symphony Orchestra has been the heartbeat of classical music in South Georgia. Each season, the orchestra presents a variety of afternoon and evening performances at the Albany Municipal Auditorium and the Albany Museum of Art.\n\nHarvest Moon\n\nFor more than two decades, Harvest Moon has been a top-rated family-friendly eatery in Albany with live music on the menu every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night. The Bo Henry Band, whose red-bearded leader co-owns Harvest Moon, often holds court in the cozy venue playing long sets of soulful Southern rock, blues and jam music.\n\nLoco's Grill & Pub\n\nThe Georgia-headquartered restaurant chain features live music on the patio on Sundays.\n\nManor House Pub at Merry Acres Inn\n\nMerry Acres Inn is a charming, locally owned boutique-style hotel where guests can enjoy drinks and conversation in the lodge-style interior or outdoors on the double veranda. Happy hour performers entertain guests during the week.\n\nState Theater\n\nThe historical venue was renovated several years ago and now hosts several concerts and special events throughout the year.\n\nPoints of Interest for Music Fans in Albany\n\nAlbany Civil Rights Institute\n\nAn often unheralded but vital civil rights battleground, Albany was the site of voter registration drives, sit-ins, marches and participation by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1961 and 1962. The congregational singing traditions of the region helped make music a central part of the Albany Movement, and in 1962, the SNCC Freedom Singers were formed in the city and subsequently toured the country. Their story, as well as the stories of ordinary people who helped bring about change in their community during this period, are shared in compelling exhibits at the Albany Civil Rights Institute.\n\nRay Charles Plaza"
