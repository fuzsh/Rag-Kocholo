        "text": "(1930–2004). Terms such as genius, national treasure, and Father of Soul have been used to describe Ray Charles, an American singer, pianist, bandleader, and composer. He was known for his husky, emotional voice and ability to perform many types of music.\n\nRay Charles Robinson was born on September 23, 1930, in Albany, Georgia. He later dropped the surname to avoid confusion with boxer Sugar Ray Robinson. His family moved to Greenville, Florida, during his infancy. He began losing his sight a few years later and was completely blind by age seven, most likely from glaucoma. Already musically inclined, he perfected his piano skills, learned to play other instruments such as the clarinet, learned to memorize music, and composed scores in Braille at the St. Augustine School for the Blind.\n\nCharles modeled himself after Nat King Cole when he was trying to establish a music career in the late 1940s in bands in Florida and Washington. His earliest recordings included the rhythm-and-blues–style “Baby Let Me Hold Your Hand” (1951), the boogie-woogie “Mess Around” (1953), and the novelty song “It Should’ve Been Me” (1954). During the early 1950s he also toured with bluesman Lowell Fulson and worked for Guitar Slim, who had a hit with Charles’s arrangement of “The Things That I Used to Do” (1953).\n\nCharles drew national attention in the mid-1950s with his stirring performance of “I Got A Woman,” a song fusing rhythm and blues, gospel, and jazz. The style was later dubbed soul because of its emotional intensity. He composed or arranged much of what he sang, including “Hallelujah I Love Her So” (1956). The call-and-response song “What’d I Say?” (1959) gave Charles his first million-seller.\n\nHis reputation as a diverse performer grew as he recorded other types of music, including ballads (The Genius of Ray Charles, 1959), jazz (Genius + Soul = Jazz, 1961), and country (Modern Sounds in Country and Western, 1962, featuring the hit “I Can’t Stop Loving You”). “Georgia on My Mind,” for which Charles won a 1960 Grammy Award as best male pop vocalist, came from The Genius Hits the Road (1960), a concept album containing songs featuring place names. He enjoyed further success on the pop charts with “Hit the Road Jack” (1961).\n\nCharles formed his own band in 1955 and toured extensively for decades, frequently backed by female gospel-style singers known as The Raelettes. Taking greater control of his life in the mid-1960s, he ended his longtime addiction to heroin and formed his own record label, Tangerine (later Crossover). Among his best-known songs of the 1970s were “Living for the City” (1975) and a rendition of “America the Beautiful” (1972). In 1978 he wrote Brother Ray: Ray Charles’ Own Story with David Ritz.\n\nCharles appeared in the films Ballad in Blue (1964) and The Blues Brothers (1980) and did various guest shots on television shows. In 1987 he founded the Robinson Foundation for Hearing Disorders. A Fool for You, a ballet set to Charles tunes, debuted in 1988. That same year the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences honored him with a lifetime achievement award. He was also recognized by the NAACP Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. He died in Beverly Hills, California, on June 10, 2004."
