This Tribute is proposed to take place at the beautiful facility named in his honor – The Ray Charles Performing Arts Center located on the prestigious campus of Morehouse College. This incredible red-carpet, fundraising musical celebration will benefit two organizations that exemplify Charles’ private passions – Georgia Hands & Voices and The Atlanta Area School for the Deaf. Remembering Ray\n\n3. About Ray… Ray Charles Robinson was born Sept. 23, 1930, in Albany, Georgia. Ray later quit using his last name because there was already a famous Ray Robinson – the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson. Ray's father, Bailey Robinson, was a mechanic and a handyman, and his mother, Aretha, stacked boards in a sawmill. His family moved to Gainesville, Florida., when Charles was an infant. Ray Charles endured many challenges in his youth. Like many families during the depression, his family struggled with poverty. His younger brother drowned when Charles was 5 and by age 7 little Ray Charles had lost his sight. It has been speculated that it was as a result of glaucoma, but at the time there wasn't a specific diagnosis. Ray Charles was sent away to the state-supported St. Augustine School for the Deaf and the Blind, where he learned to read and write music in Braille. Blind kids study by reading the music with their fingers. Charles would read three or four bars of music with his fingers, and then play it. Unlike those with sight, a blind person can't just sit and play as they read the music. First they must learn the bars of music, practice it, play it and memorize it. Charles admired Clarinet player Artie Shaw and learned the clarinet as his first instrument. Later he learned piano, alto sax, trumpet and organ. When he was 15 his mother died. Charles left St. Augustine to pursue his musical destiny. Charles played at black dance halls around Florida, nearly starving at times. In 1948, Charles moved to Seattle where he met a young Quincy Jones and formed a lifelong friendship. Charles played a major role in the Jones 1985 recording of USA for Africa's \"We Are the World.\" Charles’ style was influenced by Nat \"King\" Cole. In 1949, he had a major R&B hit, \"Confession Blues\". During this early time he developed a dependency on heroin which continued until he stopped cold turkey in 1965. Charles has seldom talked about his heroin addiction, instead wanting the focus to always be on his music. Over the years, Ray Charles developed his own unique sound, a blend of blues, R&B and gospel. Charles’ musical genius was noticed early. He had several record contracts and played at the Apollo, Carnegie Hall and the Newport Jazz Festival. In the 1960's, Charles started appearing in films and recorded soundtracks such as The Cincinnati Kid (1965) and In the Heat of the Night (1967). In 1978, Dial Press published his autobiography, \"Brother Ray.\" In his autobiography Charles stated, \"I was born with music inside me. That's the only explanation I know of... Music was one of my parts ... like my blood. It was a force already with me when I arrived on the scene. It was a necessity for me, like food or water.”\n\n4. About Ray… (cont.) In 1980, Charles appeared in The Blues Brothers movie and scored a minor country hit for his duet with Clint Eastwood, \"Beers to You,\" from the film “Any Which Way You Can”. 1n 1989, Charles had his first major pop hit with \"I'll Be Good to You,\" featuring himself and Chaka Khan. In the '90s, Charles appeared in commercials for Pepsi and was the subject of a PBS documentary. Charles won 12 Grammy Awards, winning his last Grammy in 1993 for Best R&B Male Vocal Performance, \"A Song For You.\" Being born into the segregated south in 1930 Charles was aware of the evil of racial injustice. Charles also knew that since he wasn't able to know when to duck when bottles would be thrown at his head, that it was better for him to help raise money to fight racial injustice. Charles did this for Martin Luther King Jr. and other groups around the world. Commenting on being black and blind Charles said, \"I knew being blind was suddenly an aid. I never learned to stop at the skin. If I looked at a man or a woman, I wanted to see inside. Being distracted by shading or coloring is stupid. It gets in the way. It's something I just can't see.\" One of Charles' most treasured awards is the 1976 \"Man of the Year\" Award from Beverly Hills Lodge of B'nai Brith. Charles said, \"If someone besides a black ever sings the real gut bucket blues, it'll be a Jew. We both know what it's like to be someone else's footstool.\" On a personal note, Charles was a legendary ladies man with 12 children and 20 grandchildren. The last public appearance Charles made was April 2004 alongside Actor Clint Eastwood and Actress Cicely Tyson at his beloved Central Los Angeles recording studios. The city of Los Angeles honored his legend by designating his Edifice Complex an official city historic landmark. The Grammy winner's recording studios were built more than 50 years ago. The building, located at 2107 W. Washington Blvd, has served as his office and studio since being built in 1962. The Motion Picture “Ray” was released in October 2004, starring Actor Jamie Foxx playing the musical legend. Foxx won the Academy Award for Best Actor in his portrayal of the late, great Ray Charles.\n\n5.
