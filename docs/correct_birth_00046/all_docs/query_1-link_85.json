        "text": "When OutKast‚Äôs Andre 3000 proclaimed, ‚ÄúThe South got something to say,‚Äù after the iconic Atlanta duo won Best New Rap Group at the 1995 Source Awards, it wasn‚Äôt just about music. It was a declaration of what was to come from a city that had been overlooked one too many times. Atlanta had arrived, and it wasn‚Äôt turning back. If you ask anyone today, they‚Äôll say that Atlanta is the culture ‚Äì one that started long before 1995 and continues to define art, music and entertainment directly from the minds of those who live it. Atlanta influences everything.\n\nCheck out the Black artists from Atlanta that have made their mark on music from the early days of soul, jazz and R&B at the historic Royal Peacock club to the rise of ATL‚Äôs legendary hip-hop and Trap players.\n\nAtlanta‚Äôs music roots run deeper than any catalog or list can contain. Listen to our Black Music Appreciation Playlist on Spotify.\n\nAtlanta‚Äôs historic Sweet Auburn district is home to several iconic moments in music and still manages to hold a special space for WERD radio, the first of its kind in America. In connection with the Madam C.J. Walker Museum, Jesse B. Blayton‚Äôs Black-owned and operated radio station ran programming on 860-AM from 1949 to 1968.\n\nWERD museum continues to display the work of early 19th century musicians with a rare collection of vinyls and vintage record players, spilling tunes onto Hillard Street for everyone who passes by. Many of those songs are from artists with roots in Atlanta, metro Atlanta or Georgia.\n\nGeorgians you‚Äôll hear:\n\nMa Rainey\n\nFolks looking for a high time in the 1920s typically gathered at the cabaret and tent shows with a glass of moonshine, slow dragging to the Mother of Blues ‚Äì Gertrude Pridgett ‚ÄùMa‚Äù Rainey.\n\nMusical note: Ma Rainey‚Äôs House and Blues Museum recalls the Columbus star‚Äôs life and stories about Southern living, diversity, love and relationships, which inspired the hearts of many composers including trumpeter and vocalist Louis Armstrong and writers Langston Hughes and Alice Walker.\n\nMary Lou Williams\n\nMary Lou Williams developed an ear for euphonious notes at an early age by teaching herself to play piano, later funneling her talents into jazz compositions. She gained notoriety after having joined, traveled with and led Andy Kirk‚Äôs group as ‚Äúthe lady who swings the band.‚Äù\n\nMusical Note: Williams continued pursuing passion arranging songs with Duke Ellington and eventually broke into the airways hosting her own piano, blues and jazz radio show.\n\nJames Brown\n\nThe Royal Peacock, originally historic Sweet Auburn‚Äôs Top Hat Club, welcomed performers like Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway and the legendary James Brown who made his mark in the ‚Äò50s and ‚Äò60s with funk, rhythm and iconic dance moves, earning him the title Godfather of Soul.\n\nMusical note: The Royal Peacock remains open for late night grooves on Auburn Avenue. Downtown Augusta recognizes Brown with a bronze life-size statue where he took his first steps in music.\n\nOtis ‚ÄúRockhouse‚Äù Redding\n\nThe King of Soul created a lyrically impressive footprint in the ‚Äò60s, performing hits with the Mighty Panthers on the Chitlin‚Äô Circuit before becoming a solo act.\n\nMusical note: Although Redding‚Äôs discography leaves behind a legacy of its own, a dedicated museum in downtown Macon shares more stories about the man behind the music.\n\nColumbus Calvin ‚ÄúDuke‚Äù Pearson Jr.\n\nDuke Pearson was a homegrown jazz performer, arranger, bandleader and well-respected pianist of the 1960s. He shared his talents with the best of Atlanta‚Äôs live entertainment scene and juke joints across the East Coast.\n\nGladys Knight\n\nThe eight-time Grammy Award-winning, Rock & Roll Hall of Famer, World Series and Super Bowl opening voice clearly did more than conduct the ‚ÄúMidnight Train to Georgia.‚Äù Knight‚Äôs passion for music led to her being crowned the Empress of Soul.\n\nMusical note: A portion of State Route 9 from Peachtree Street to 14th Street has been named Gladys Knight Highway. There was also a time when her restaurant served the best chicken & waffles on Peachtree Street.\n\nRay Charles Robinson\n\nNo one knows what influenced Albany‚Äôs legendary pianist Ray Charles to compose ‚ÄúGeorgia on My Mind,‚Äù a Southern anthem that‚Äôs been praised and sung worldwide for decades. Named ‚ÄúGenius‚Äù by Frank Sinatra, Charles was known to be a musician of different instruments and a vocalist of several genres.\n\nMusical Note: Performing jazz compositions with students at Morehouse College led to him receiving an honorary degree, along with the college‚Äôs performing arts center being named in his honor.\n\nWith La Carousel jazz club right around the corner at Paschal‚Äôs Hotel, WERD paved the way for Jazz 91.9 WCLK, Clark Atlanta University‚Äôs radio station. WCLK has served Atlanta classic, contemporary jazz and gospel tunes for more than 40 years and continues to provide listeners with special programs like Gene Knight‚Äôs Cafe Jazz featuring big band and bebop mixes, Rodney Evans‚Äô gospel Joy In The Morning and more.\n\nThe Gospel\n\nSouthern Baptist churches, spiritual hymnals and Black gospel melodies have always influenced the way we enjoy music.The Atlanta Civic Center hosted the prestigious Stella Awards, while Midtown‚Äôs Fox Theatre later welcomed the esteemed Dove Awards, along with a variety of gospel industry musicians, for a weekend of celebrations. As for traditional and contemporary gospel sounds, artists like The Pace Sisters, PJ Morton, Tasha Cobbs Leonard and Lecrae contribute to vocals heard during Sunday morning services or on stage at Atlanta Gospelfest.\n\nIt all began with stomping and twisting to the 1982 jam, ‚ÄúBattmann, Let Mojo Handle It.‚Äù Mojo, Atlanta‚Äôs first rapper, put a stake in the ground with plays on the radio that introduced the city to new mainstream possibilities. Bands and live shows at Morris Brown kept it rockin‚Äô for students along with other Atlanta hip-hop legends like MC Shy D, Tony MF Rock, Kilo Ali and Raheem the Dream.\n\nBut not too far behind was Hot 97.5, Atlanta‚Äôs first hip-hop station. Remember Chris Tucker‚Äôs rap ‚ÄúGettin‚Äô Crazy‚Äù kicking us off on Ryan Cameron‚Äôs Morning Show? Cameron did more for radio than crack jokes and report about Atlanta‚Äôs traffic during the 7 o‚Äôclock hour. He and DJ Nabs brought in the livest personalities including Chris Luva Luva (Ludacris) and Poon Daddy üéµ (if you know, you know), who kept the latest spins on repeat every night and weekend.\n\nHits kept coming from TLC taking over to Da Brat, Xscape, Jagged Edge, Monica and even Kris Kross, the youngest hip-hop duo with platinum albums guaranteed to make you jump, jump. It says a lot if you recall So So Def‚Äôs Jermaine ‚ÄúJD‚Äù Dupri, L.A. Reid and Babyface‚Äôs LaFace Records, Ludacris‚Äô Disturbing Tha Peace and Dallas Austin‚Äôs off-the-chart talents. If you were at ESSO or Run ‚Äòn‚Äô Shoot just listening to any radio station at that time, you couldn‚Äôt help but hear these artists. If not‚Ä¶ *cues Welcome to Atlanta.*\n\n112\n\nDa Brat\n\nJagged Edge\n\nJermaine Dupri\n\nKilo Ali\n\nMonica\n\nSilk\n\nTLC\n\nToni Braxton\n\nUsher\n\nXscape\n\nThere was a time when an uprising of artists challenged ‚Äúhard core‚Äù and ‚Äúgangsta‚Äù as the only terms used to describe rap and hip-hop for East and West Coast listeners. Southern rap, and even Atlanta‚Äôs sound, was born and bred by ATLiens like Organized Noize who recognized talent, artists and producers who created tunes with passion and powerful lyrics. If you survey any locals on the streets of Atlanta, Old Atlanta music hits different. There‚Äôs a reason The New York Times called ATL ‚Äúhip-hop‚Äôs center of gravity.‚Äù These are the pioneers and the movement.\n\n(Please be advised: Some of the throwbacks featured on our playlist may cause you to Bankhead Bounce or do the Ragtop.)\n\nArrested Development\n\nDungeon Family\n\nGoodie Mob\n\nGhetto Mafia\n\nOrganized Noize\n\nOutKast\n\nPurple Ribbon All-Stars\n\nCampuses across Atlanta and especially Atlanta‚Äôs HBCUs contributed to the look and sound of the ‚Äò80s and ‚Äò90s. They were the interns, the street teams, the promoters, the up-and-coming talent, the audience and the emerging community and business leaders. So when it came to performances on campus, battles in the park and musical acts being launched, Atlanta University Center students‚Äô tight-knit community had a hand in it. When college students organized picnics for their hometown classmates because they couldn‚Äôt go home for spring break, one small picnic morphed into one of the most unforgettable experiences in Atlanta in the late ‚Äò80s and early ‚Äò90s ‚Äî Freaknik. It drove thousands to Atlanta from word of mouth, features in music videos, NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúA Different World‚Äù and, of course, Spike Lee‚Äôs ‚ÄúSchool Daze.‚Äù The best part of it was how it started ‚Äì college students celebrating together, hip-hop and freestyle cyphers, concerts and unity ‚Äì which is often forgotten.\n\nThe late ‚Äò90s and early 2000s became a new era and pivotal time in Atlanta‚Äôs sound, especially with the release of Outkast‚Äôs iconic ‚ÄúStankonia‚Äù and the introduction of Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz‚Äô ‚ÄúWho U Wit‚Äù hyping crowds to dance and represent their hood, set or clique. It was almost a guarantee to catch DJ Greg Street on Friday nights, playing local mix-tape hits at Club 559 in the West End. And let‚Äôs not forget how fast we tuned into V-103 at 6 o‚Äôclock, because we knew it was time for Greg Street to rock.\n\nWhether you Eastside Stomped your way to the dance floor or huddled with family and friends in tall, white tees to ‚ÄúLean Wit It, Rock Wit It‚Äù during a summer family reunion in the A, it was mandatory to ‚ÄúWalk It Out,‚Äù ‚ÄúShake That Laffy Taffy,‚Äù ‚ÄúSwag Surf,‚Äù ‚ÄúShoulda Lean,‚Äù join a battle of ‚ÄúCrank That‚Äù competitions or simply, get crunk. (You had to be there.)\n\nBone Crusher\n\nCiara\n\nCrime Mob\n\nD4L\n\nDem Franchize Boyz\n\nField Mob\n\nJazze Pha\n\nKeri Hilson\n\nLil Jon & The Eastside Boyz\n\nLudacris\n\nNivea\n\nPastor Troy\n\nPlayaz Circle\n\nRasheeda\n\nTrillville\n\nYing Yang Twins\n\nWith hip-hop, Southern rap and R&B on the rise, neo-soul was one category not to be left behind. Thanks to FunkJazz Kafe, Chocolate Soul and jam sessions at Yin Yang Cafe, these safe havens were the stepping stones in the mid-‚Äô90s for local creatives. Signature poets, bands and singers including Jon Goode and India.Arie illustrated spoken word with rhythmic melodies and food for the soul. They gave us that ‚ÄúLove Jones‚Äù vibe.\n\nThe music kept playing at Apache Cafe in 2001, with the help of owner Asa Fain, his wife, Karen and D.R.E.S. tha BEATnik. The stage was blessed with hip-hop, jazz, reggae and open mic, so you could expect anyone from Nick Cannon to Queen Sheba or Janelle Monae.\n\nIndia.Arie\n\nSlamATL\n\nDJ Kemit\n\nDonnie\n\nKhari Simmons\n\nFahamu Pecou\n\nJanelle Monae\n\nOn Ponce De Leon, Peachtree Street or just off of Peachtree Road, Atlanta artists were also catapulted into fame by the set DJs played and the dancing crowds in the bars and clubs. MJQ, Club Kaya, Club Esso, Club 112, Vision, Compound, Masquerade and ‚ÄúPuff Daddy‚Äôs‚Äù Justin‚Äôs welcomed visitors, locals and transplants to start jammin‚Äô and made everyone feel at home. There were even a few memorable moments at Underground Atlanta.\n\nRadio host Frank Ski‚Äôs ‚ÄúNorthern Exposure‚Äù at Club Kaya created a spot for house music, but Atlanta‚Äôs music scene reached another peak in 2005 when Ramon Rawsoul, DJ Kemit and a small yet significant group put together the first house music festival. House in the Park is now an annual gathering of Atlanta‚Äôs best DJs bringing the heat with a mix of Afro beats, Carribean vibes and house music for all ages.\n\nWell before Atlanta was deemed ‚ÄúHollywood of the South,‚Äù the 2006 coming-of-age film ‚ÄúATL‚Äù featured native personalities Monica (the most polite Waffle House waitress), Big Boi, T.I., Big Gipp, Killer Mike, Bone Crusher and Jazze Pha. Setting the scene at Westside‚Äôs Cascade Skating Rink, this cultural memoir gave us the most relatable look at the everyday life of Atlanta‚Äôs Black community.\n\nIt was only right to spotlight tons of Old Atlanta artists on the soundtrack for ‚ÄúATL,‚Äù primarily touting songs from T.I. which premiered at his spot, Club Crucial. ‚ÄúThe King of the South‚Äù and Young Jeezy ‚ÄúThe Snowman‚Äù became the OGs of the hip-hop subgenre, trap music. Along with the ‚ÄúSo Icy‚Äù rapper Gucci Mane, these three pioneers started a movement unlike any other, storytelling the ins and outs of trapping out the bando, hustling to make ends meet and ultimately the lifestyle of a T-R-A-P-S-T-AR.\n\nOne of the most Atlanta music experiences resides in a place that captures the true essence of where the culture was birthed and cultivated into a time capsule of sorts. The Trap Music Museum started as a pop-up and turned trap music culture into an art form with exhibits recreating (not glorifying) the reality and resilience of many rappers growing up in our city. These musical geniuses are credited with laying the blueprint for trap, with 808 kick drum samples, hype bass-hitting and futuristic sounds:\n\n2 Chainz\n\nDJ Unk\n\nFuture\n\nGucci Mane\n\nJeezy\n\nLil Scrappy\n\nRich Kidz\n\nRocko\n\nRoscoe Dash\n\nShawty Lo\n\nT.I.\n\nTravis Porter\n\nWaka Flocka Flame\n\nYoung Dro\n\nYung Joc\n\nYung L.A.\n\nOur city‚Äôs music legacy is one main reason so many make a move to Atlanta for their big break. Atlanta has a catalog of acts to show why it is the base of the musical universe, no matter the genre. Whenever a song opens with ‚ÄúIf Young Metro Don‚Äôt Trust You,‚Äù ‚ÄúWe Got London on the Track,‚Äù ‚ÄúMike WiLL Made-It,‚Äù ‚ÄúOG Parker‚Äù or ‚ÄúZaytoven on the Beat,‚Äù you already know it‚Äôs going to be a banger. These New Atlanta artists are known for creating mumble rap, redefining real ATL stories and taking ad libs, hip-hop and beats to another level:\n\n21 Savage\n\nEarthgang\n\nGunna\n\nJID\n\nLil Baby\n\nLil Yachty\n\nMigos\n\nMulatto\n\nOG Maco\n\nPlayboi Carti\n\nRich Homie Quan\n\nTrinidad James\n\nYoung Thug\n\nYung Baby Tate\n\nIn a league of his own, Lil Nas X boldly infused trap and country sounds giving us ‚ÄúOld Town Road‚Äù (which won a Country Music Association award) and another category to remind us there‚Äôs still room to be innovative in music. Along with 6lack‚Äôs East Atlanta Love Letter album, these newer talents set the tempo for making R&B great again:\n\nChildish Gambino\n\nChloe x Halle\n\nH.E.R.\n\nNormani\n\nSummer Walker\n\nAlthough the future of music is to be determined, Atlanta‚Äôs creatives will continue to pioneer what‚Äôs heard next. When you are ready to recall the best recordings of music history, look to visit the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame at the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. and Northside drives and soon-to-call-Atlanta-home, the Recording Academy‚Äôs Grammy Music Museum.\n\nVisit 44th & 3rd Bookseller in Atlanta‚Äôs historic West End to learn more about the history of hip hop and the creative genius of Black expression. Pick up books like ‚ÄúContact High‚Äù by Vikki Tobak, ‚ÄúThe Boombox Project‚Äù by Lyle Owerko (forward by Spike Lee), ‚ÄúHip-Hop at the End of the World‚Äù by Ernest Paniccioli and various hip-hop publications.\n\nHear more authentic Atlanta music at Atlanta Jazz Festival, A3C Festival & Conference and ONE Musicfest. These three events connect and give back to the best of Atlanta‚Äôs history, business, innovation and creativity through music."
