        "text": "Background\n\nRay Charles Robinson Sr. was a gift to the music industry. He pioneered the freedom of expression that music offers today, and forever carved a name for himself within the greatest ones. Charles was born on September 23, 1930, in Albany, Georgia to his father, Bailey Robinson, and his mother, Aretha Robinson, to whom he was very dedicated. Her perseverance, self-sufficiency, and pride were always a guiding light in his life. His love for music was sparked early on, at the age of three, when he was at Wylie Pitman’s Red Wing Cafe and heard Pitman play “Boogie Woogie.” Pitman helped him learn how to play the piano and sometimes even helped the family enormously when things got financially tough.\n\nCharles lost his sight gradually until the age of seven. His mother was determined to find a school for him and despite his protest, he was enrolled at the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind in 1937. In school, he kept working and deepening his knowledge of music. He learned how to play the classical piano using J.S. Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart’s music, and was also taught how to use braille music. His mother’s passing, in 1945, shook him to the core. He was 14 years old, and he decided not to return to school afterward. He relocated to Jacksonville and while there, he stayed with Charles Wayne Powell, a friend of his mother’s. Charles started his career by playing piano for bands at the Ritz Theatre in LaVilla. He also joined Local 632 of the musicians’ union for purposes of easy access to gigs. His reputation as a musician in Jacksonville grew in the process, but not as fast as one would think nowadays. When he was 16 years old, he moved to Orlando. As World War II was over and there were no soldiers to entertain, work was hard to find, but he eventually got lucky, writing arrangements for a pop music band in 1947. He later formed a band with Gossie McKee and Milton Garrett, and it was upward from there.\n\nToday, he is a legend. He made history as one of the first black musicians to have full artistic control by a mainstream company. Charles has been a recipient of many awards and accolades, even after his death, including being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2022, he was initiated into the Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame."
