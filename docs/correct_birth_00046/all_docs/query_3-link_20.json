        "text": "By the early 1960s, after writing many R&B classics, Ray Charles had virtually given up writing his own songs, choosing instead to interpret songs of many different styles written by others. In 1962, Ray released Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, an album of popular country songs reimagined in his unique style. The record was an immediate success, and a second volume was released later that same year. Modern Sounds continues to be celebrated today and is often cited as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\nHear for yourself! The songs below are featured on the Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music albums. Hear the original recording followed by Ray’s version. What is the same, and what is different about Ray’s rendition?"
