        "text": "Ray Charles lived in Greenville with his mother and adopted grandmother from shortly after his birth in 1930 until about the age of five. The modest wood frame house he grew up in was probably constructed in the 1920s. Because of advanced deterioration, the abandoned house was scheduled for demolition. In 2006, the Town of Greenville purchased the structure to preserve the memory of Ray Charles. With a grant from the Florida Bureau of Historic Preservation, the Town completed the reconstruction of the house in 2008.\n\nA statue of Charles was also unveiled in 2006, and it can be visited in Greenville's Park."
