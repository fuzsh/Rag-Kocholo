        "text": "Ray Charles Biography\n\nAmerican singer, songwriter, and pianist Ray Charles Robinson Sr. He is regarded as one of the most recognisable and influential vocalists of all time, and his contemporaries frequently referred to him as “The Genius.” He favored the moniker “Brother Ray” when referring to friends and other musicians. Charles lost his sight as a toddler, possibly from glaucoma.\n\nIn Albany, Georgia, on September 23, 1930, Ray Charles Robinson was conceived. Charles began to lose his vision at the age of four or five and was completely blind by the time he was seven, most likely due to glaucoma. Aretha Robinson, who was ignorant, destitute, and grieving the loss of her younger son, used her connections in the neighborhood to find a school that would take a blind African-American student. Despite his early objections, Charles went to school from 1937 until 1945 at the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind in St. Augustine.\n\nAt school, Charles continued to hone his musical talent and learned how to perform Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven’s classical piano compositions. In order to use braille music, which is a challenging process that needs learning the left hand motions by reading braille with the right hand and the right hand movements by reading braille with the left hand, then merging the two parts, his teacher Mrs. Lawrence taught him how to do it.\n\nCharles was 14 when his mother passed away in the spring of 1945. He was shocked by her passing; he later referred to the passing of his mother and brother as “the two big tragedies” of his life. Charles made the decision to skip school following the funeral.\n\nBy fusing blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and gospel music traditions into the music he recorded for Atlantic Records in the 1950s, Charles helped to establish the soul music genre. With his crossover success on ABC Records, particularly with his two Modern Sounds albums, he helped to integrate country music, rhythm and blues, and pop music during the 1960s. Charles was one of the first black performers to receive artistic control from a major record label while he was with ABC.\n\nThe first of Charles’ three career No. 1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, “Georgia On My Mind,” was released in 1960. His first album to reach the top of the Billboard 200 was Modern Sounds In Country And Western Music, released in 1962. With 44 hits on the US R&amp;B singles chart, 11 singles on the Hot 100 singles list, and 2 singles on the Hot Country singles charts, Charles had multiple singles that reached the Top 40 on various Billboard charts.\n\nCharles listed Nat King Cole as his main inspiration, while Louis Jordan and Charles Brown also had an impact on his music. He was Quincy Jones’s lifelong friend and occasionally occasional business partner. Ray Charles downplayed Frank Sinatra’s claim that he was “the only true genius in show business.” Billy Joel said, “This may sound like sacrilege, but I think Ray Charles was more important than Elvis Presley”.\n\nCharles was awarded the Polar Music Prize, the National Medal of Arts, and the Kennedy Center Honors for his contributions to music. In 1986, he was one of the first individuals to be inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. He received 10 of his records into the Grammy Hall of Fame, 18 Grammy Awards (including 5 posthumously), and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987. Charles was placed No. 2 on Rolling Stone’s list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time and No. 10 on the publication’s list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. He received inductions into both the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2022.\n\nRay Charles Discography\n\nTop Videos\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow Many #1 Songs Did Ray Charles Have?\n\nRay Charles had a total of 12 number-one songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
