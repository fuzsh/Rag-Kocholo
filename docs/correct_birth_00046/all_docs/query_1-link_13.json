However, the song has been most often associated with soul singer Ray Charles, who was a native of the U.S. state of Georgia and recorded it for his 1960 album The Genius Hits the Road.\n\nIn 1979, the State of Georgia designated Ray Charles' version the official state song.[2][3] The song has become part of the Great American Songbook tradition.[4][5]\n\n\"Georgia on My Mind\" has been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame twice. The first induction was in 1993 for the 1960 recording on the ABC-Paramount label by Ray Charles. The second induction happened in 2014 for the 1930 recording on the Victor label by Hoagy Carmichael And His Orchestra.[6]\n\nBackground and original recording[edit]\n\nIt has been asserted that Hoagy Carmichael wrote the song about his sister, Georgia.[7][8] However, Carmichael wrote in his second autobiography Sometimes I Wonder (1976) that saxophonist Frankie Trumbauer told him he should write a song about the state of Georgia. Trumbauer jokingly volunteered the first two words, \"Georgia, Georgia...\", which Carmichael ended up using while working on the song with his roommate, Stuart Gorrell. Gorrell, who wrote the lyrics, stated he wrote the lyrics about Carmichael’s sister.[4][9] Gorrell's name was absent from the copyright, but Carmichael sent him royalty checks anyway.[4]\n\nCarmichael recorded \"Georgia on My Mind\", with Bix Beiderbecke on cornet, in New York City on September 15, 1930.[4]\n\nRay Charles version[edit]\n\nIn 1960, Ray Charles, a native of Georgia, recorded a version of the song that went to No. 1 on the Billboard magazine Hot 100.[4] Charles' hit rendition would become the most widely-known version of the tune from this time on.[12][4][13][14] It would also be the song most associated with his musical career. The string intro was famously copied by the Eagles for their piano intro to Desperado.[12]\n\nChart (1960–1961) Peak\n\nposition Belgium (Ultratop 50 Wallonia)[15] 47 UK Singles (OCC)[16] 24 US Billboard Hot 100[17] 1\n\nChart (2013) Peak\n\nposition France (SNEP)[18] 117\n\nIn 1977, Robert Grossman, James Picker and Craig Whitaker created a clay animation short, Jimmy the C, in which U.S. President Jimmy Carter sings in Ray Charles' version of the song.[19][20][21]\n\nIn 1979, the song was designated the State Song of Georgia, and Charles was invited to perform it at the state capitol.[3][12]\n\nThe TV series Designing Women used an instrumental version of \"Georgia on My Mind\" as its opening theme. During the opening credits of the show's sixth season in 1991, Charles performed his version of the song live on piano while the show's cast watched him.\n\nIn 2003, Rolling Stone magazine named the Ray Charles version of \"Georgia on My Mind\" the 44th greatest song of all time.[4][13]\n\nThe original lyrics, including the commonly excised introductory verse, are in the Georgia Code under license.[2][3]\n\nElla Fitzgerald version[edit]\n\nIn 1962, famed jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald released a rendition of the song, produced by Norman Granz, on the album Ella Swings Gently with Nelson.[22]\n\nThe Hawks/The Band version[edit]\n\nThe song was a standard at performances by Ronnie Hawkins and The Hawks,[4] where it was sung by pianist Richard Manuel after 1964. When The Hawks broke up and formed The Band, they kept the song in their repertoire. They recorded a studio version of the song for Jimmy Carter's presidential bid in 1976. It was released as a single that year as well as on their 1977 album Islands.[23]\n\nWillie Nelson version[edit]\n\n\"Georgia on My Mind\"Single by Willie Nelsonfrom the album Stardust B-side\"On the Sunny Side of the Street\"ReleasedMarch 25, 1978Recorded1977GenreCountryLength3:55LabelColumbiaComposer(s)Hoagy CarmichaelLyricist(s)Stuart GorrellProducer(s)Sid FellerWillie Nelson singles chronology\n\nWillie Nelson recorded the song on Stardust, his 1978 album of standards.[4] It was released as single, peaked at No. 1 for a single week, and ranked for sixteen weeks on Billboard’s country charts.[24] Nelson's version won him a Grammy Award in 1979 at the 21st Annual Grammy Awards for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male.[25]\n\nChart (1978) Peak\n\nposition US Hot Country Songs (Billboard)[26] 1 US Billboard Hot 100[27] 84 Canadian RPM Country Tracks 1 Canadian RPM Top Singles 86 Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary Tracks 16\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nList of 1930s jazz standards\n\nSpirit of Atlanta Drum and Bugle Corps\n\nAtlanta CV Drum and Bugle Corps"
