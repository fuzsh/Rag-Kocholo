        "text": "Ray's History in Greenville:\n\nGreenville's Mayor Elesta Pritchett was born in 1930, only a few weeks ahead of Ray, lived only a couple houses away from his family, and eventually became the mayor of the town of Greenville.\n\n\"My momma said that his momma wasn't anything but a child when she was pregnant with him,\" said Elesta. \"It was a scandal here in Greenville.\" Ray's father, who was also his half-uncle, had a sister who lived a hundred miles north in Albany, Georgia. She came to Greenville and took Ray's pregnant mother away.\n\nA few weeks later Ray's mom returned with her new baby. \"Maybe a month,\" said Elesta. \"That's all the Georgia he had in him.\" (Elesta added that Ray Charles had no birth certificate, so he could have been born anywhere.)\n\nRay Charles's long history in Greenville is well-documented. \"Everybody knew R.C.,\" said Elesta. She told us about the time Ray taught her poker with his braille playing cards. Once, she said, she came upon Ray walking along a dirt path, slapping away on his legs, lost in music that was only in his head. \"He could go all over Greenville, all by himself.\" Ray lived in town until he was seven, and returned for frequent visits from his school for the blind in St. Augustine (also in Florida) until he was 15, when his mother died.\n\nWhen Ray died in 2004, Mayor Pritchett knew she had to do something to make people aware of his childhood in Greenville. As a small town with limited resources, Greenville's prospects were grim. But Elesta was persistent, and Florida rallied to the cause. The state provided some money, and the sculpting team of Bradley Cooley and Brad Cooley Jr. in nearby Lamont offered to create a Ray Charles statue for free. It was unveiled in Greenville's park on February 18, 2006.\n\nElesta Pritchett:This is Ray Charles's home. Greenville. He walked these sand roads with no shoes on. The people here now, the younger generation, I wanted them to know.\n\nhttps://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/31731\n\nSeattle:\n\nRay Charles was a poor, blind, newly orphaned teenager living in Tampa, Florida, in 1948 when he decided to move to Seattle, picking the city because it was as far away as he could get from where he was. He stayed only two years, but during that time he cut his first record and began to develop the genre-bending musical style that would make him an international star. Charles often spoke of Seattle as a pivotal point in his long and hugely successful career as a singer/songwriter. \"I met a lot of very good friends here,\" he told one interviewer. \"I liked the atmosphere. The people were friendly, the people took to me right away. Seattle is the town where I made my first record. And if you ever want to say where I got my start, you have to say that\"\n\nBorn in 1930:\n\nRay Charles Robinson was born September 23, 1930, in Albany, Georgia, the first child of Aretha and Bailey Robinson. His father worked off and on for the railroads; his mother took in laundry. The family started out poor and stayed that way throughout the hard years of the Depression. \"Even compared to other blacks,\" Charles recalled, \"we were on the bottom of the ladder looking up at everyone else. Nothing below us except the ground\"\n\nGreenville, Florida:\n\nThe family moved across the border to Greenville, Florida, when Charles was a few months old. A second child soon followed, a son named George. Their father Bailey Robinson became little more than an occasional visitor after that. \"The old man wasn’t part of my life,\" Charles wrote in his 1978 autobiography. \"... to tell the truth, I wouldn’t bet a lot of money he and my mother ever were married. He was a tall dude -- I remember that. But he was hardly ever around\"\n\nBrother George Drowns:\n\nWhen he was about five, Charles witnessed the drowning death of his younger brother. The two boys had been in the backyard playing near a large metal tub their mother used for washing clothes when four-year-old George slipped over the edge and into the soapy water. Charles tried to pull him out, but his brother - quickly weighted down by his wet clothing - was too heavy. Charles ran indoors, screaming for his mother, but it was too late. It was the first major tragedy in a life that would have many other sorrows.\n\nBlindness:\n\nNot long after the drowning, Charles began to lose his vision, apparently as the result of untreated glaucoma. He was completely blind by the time he was seven. He credited his mother with preparing him to live without sight. She made him continue to draw water from the well, bring in the firewood, and do other chores, even though he often tripped and fell.\n\nAretha Robinson:You may be blind, she told him, but you’re not stupid; you have to do things for yourself, no one else will do them for you.\n\n\"She let me roam, let me make my own mistakes, let me discover the world for myself,\" he wrote. From this he developed a fierce independence and the ability to maneuver so adroitly that some people, later in his life, doubted that he was really blind.\n\nHis mother managed to get him accepted as a charity student at the Florida State School for the Deaf and the Blind (known at the time as the Institute for the Blind, Deaf and Dumb), in St. Augustine, about 130 miles southeast of Greenville. He stayed there for eight years, with time off for summers at home. He learned how to read Braille, to type, to weave baskets, and to repair radios and cars. He also studied music formally for the first time, mastering the piano and other instruments, including clarinet and saxophone. He learned to read and compose music in Braille. He played everything, from Chopin to jazz pianist Art Tatum. On the radio he listened to swing, country-western, and gospel.\n\nCharles’ mother died shortly before his 15th birthday:\n\nIt was, he wrote later, the most devastating experience of his life. He felt like \"truly a lost child.\" He left school and moved to nearby Jacksonville, where he stayed for a while with one of his mother’s friends. He began trying to make a living as a musician, working as a sideman in small combos. \"Work was very sparse,\" he wrote. \"I might work a couple of nights and then no more for two weeks or three weeks - whenever something came along. Hit and miss, really, that's what it was\"\n\nTampa:\n\nEventually, he moved on to Tampa. But he found it difficult to survive as a musician in Florida. He also resented working for other people. He wanted to form his own group, and make a fresh start in a new place. Too intimidated to try New York or Chicago, he asked a friend - guitarist Garcia \"Gosady\" McGee - what city in the continental United States was farthest from Florida. McGee \"took a map and went diagonal across it, and there was Seattle sittin’ up in the Northwest, and I said let me go there and see what I can do\"\n\nhttps://www.historylink.org/file/5707"
