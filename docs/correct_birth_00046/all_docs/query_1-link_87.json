        "text": "Friday\n\nStart with \"The Genius\" Landmark\n\nLocated along Front Street and overlooking the Flint River, Ray Charles Plaza features a life size bronze sculpture of Ray sitting at his piano. At night, it lights up and his music is played. Also featured in the plaza are a sitting area shaped like piano keys and musical note shapes on the ground. There's a plaque displayed in front of the statue, which includes braille for the blind. The Ray Charles Plaza is a beautiful area with a view of the river.\n\nCatch Dinner and a Band\n\nFor more than two decades, Harvest Moon has been a top-rated, family-friendly eatery in Albany with live music on the menu every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night. The Bo Henry Band, whose red-bearded leader co-owns Harvest Moon, often holds court in the cozy venue playing long sets of soulful Southern rock, blues and jam music.\n\nSaturday\n\nDiscover a South Georgia Symphony\n\nWith more than 50 years of history, the Albany Symphony Orchestra continues to serve the South Georgia community in a unique and positive way, reaching a rich mix of racial, cultural and economic groups. Established in 1964, it is southwest Georgia's only fully professional symphony. Concerts are held October through May at the Historic Albany Municipal Auditorium.\n\nGrab a Seat for a Soul Food Saturday Night\n\nIcons Soul Food Lounge presents a variety of performers from southwest Georgia and North Florida, including 7th High Band, featuring the incredible saxophonist Fred Williams, Jr. Its famous soul food kitchen turns out to-die-for chicken wings, fish and grits, and traditional dishes like oxtails, catfish and pork chops. Saturday nights include late night dining, live local performances and tableside nightclub vibe.\n\nSunday\n\nWorship with the Anointed Albany State University Gospel Choir"
