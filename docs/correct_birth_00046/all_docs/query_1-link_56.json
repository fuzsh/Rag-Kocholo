        "text": "Idol's C.J. Harris Discusses Facing Adversity as a Black Country Artist\n\nC.J. Harris&nbsp;has come a long way from playing bars in Jasper, Alabama to making it to the Top 6 on Season 13 of&nbsp;American Idol&nbsp;&mdash; and his journey wasn't without a few bumps along the way. Harris weathered some pretty harsh criticism on the show about his singing style, but that was nothing compared to some of the prejudice he faced back home when he was first starting out as a musician. \"I would go in some bars and people didn't want to see [me],\" Harris told TVGuide.com this week. \"It didn't matter how good I was. They didn't want to hear it. I've had people walk out on me. I've booked shows back at home, and I'd come and play the show, and the owner would come up to me and say, 'Hey, people just aren't enjoying your music tonight. We want you to cut it short.' It was obviously because of one reason. I've dealt with that.\"\n\nStars to Re-Record \"We Are the World\" for Haiti\n\nTwenty-five years after its original release, Quincy Jones is spearheading a new recording of \"We Are the World\" to raise money to help the victims of the earthquake in Haiti.Watch the original \"We Are the World\" music video in our Online Video Guide \"It's the 25th anniversary and it's perfect timing,\" Jones told E! News. \"It's not an accident, man. That's God. It will be 'We Are the World' for Haiti.\"The original song, written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie and co-produced by Jones, benefitted African famine relief...\n\nElliott Defends Idol Swan-Song Pick\n\nIn the end, for American Idol wannabe Elliott Yamin, it came down to a trio of giant, video-projected percentages: 33.68, 33.26 and 33.06&nbsp;— the last of which, separated from second place by just 10,000 votes, belonged to him. \"I just knew.... I had that intuition that my name was going to be attached to the bottom number,\" he told TVGuide.com the morning after being sent packing. \"And I was prepared for it, so it was easy to take and grasp.\" As for the oh-so-slim margin of loss to finalists Taylor Hicks and Katharine McPhee, he says, \"It was really flattering to have been involved in such a close, tight-knit race.\" Early on in the competition, the 27-year-old Virginian was handed some of the highest praise one could ever expect to hear from\n\nOne-on-One with Love Monkey's Shooter\n\nIn CBS'&nbsp;recently premiered&nbsp;Love Monkey (Tuesdays at 10 pm/ET), Ed alum Tom Cavanagh is flanked by a trio of buds, including Jason Priestley's dad-to-be, Mike, and Christopher Wiehl's onetime baseball stud, Jake. Rounding out the close-knit quartet is Shooter, played by Larenz Tate, with whom TVGuide.com went one-on-one in this Q&amp;A.&nbsp; TVGuide.com: Some have likened Love Monkey to Sex and the City, but with guys and music. In that scheme of things, who is Shooter —&nbsp;Samantha?Larenz Tate: Yeah, that's what everyone is saying. Our show clearly stands on its own, but if I had to compare, he'd be the\n\nJamie Foxx Wants That Oscar\n\nLike an old, sweet song, Ray Charles seems to be on plenty of minds these days. His last CD, Genius Loves Company, has sold half a million copies. And Ray, a film based on his life, opens Oct. 29. But first, Jamie Foxx, the star of that biopic, will host a CBS tribute to the 12-time Grammy winner, who died of liver disease in June. The special will feature performances by Elton John, Reba McEntire, Stevie Wonder and other Charles fans. Says Foxx of the event: \"For Ray, we're going to do it right.\" TV Guide Online: Your performance in Ray has already been generating Oscar buzz. Do you care, or are you one of those \"it's an honor just to be nominated\" types?Jamie Foxx: If you play for the Lakers, you want to go to the championship. I just look at this stuff as a beautiful testimony to Ray Charles' life. TVGO: You've worked previously with a lot of big stars, like Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise and Denzel Washingto"
