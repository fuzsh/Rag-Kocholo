Price on day of issue was 46Â¢. First-day-of-issue ceremonies were held in Los Angeles, California and Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nHe was voted the 10th Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Artist of all time by Rolling Stone.\n\nRanked the second greatest singer of the rock era in a Rolling Stone magazine poll in 2008.\n\nLegislation was introduced in the House of Representatives to award him the Congressional Gold Medal. [February 2005]\n\nAt the time of his death from liver disease on June 10, 2004, he was working on a recording project of duets with such performers as Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt, B. B. King, Elton John and Norah Jones. This collaboration entitled \"Genius Loves Company\" led to an incisive win at the Grammy Awards--eight posthumous trophies including \"Album of the Year\" and \"Record of the Year\".\n\nUnderwent hip replacement surgery in Los Angeles, California on November 24, 2003.\n\nHe was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters by Wilberforce University, a private, historically black university in Wilberforce, Ohio. [December 1999]\n\nHe was awarded the Polar Music Prize, the Royal Swedish Academy of Music Award, in 1998.\n\nHe was awarded the American National Medal of the Arts in 1993 by the National Endowment of the Arts in Washington D.C.\n\nInducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 as part of the institution's inaugural 10-member class that included Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, James Brown and Jerry Lee Lewis. He also received the Recording Academy's lifetime achievement award at the 1987 Grammy Awards.\n\nHe was one of the few black performers to have a #1 song on Billboard magazine's country charts, a 1985 duet with Willie Nelson called \"Seven Spanish Angels\".\n\nIn 1981, he was heavily criticized for touring apartheid South Africa.\n\nInducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 1979 and the Blues Hall of Fame in 1982.\n\nHe was a longtime supporter of Israel, and was named \"Man of the Year\" by the B'nai Brith in 1976.\n\nHe also showed up sporadically in films, playing himself in the movie Ballad in Blue (1965) and guest-starring in The Blues Brothers (1980) with Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. A television musical variety favorite with his trademark dark sunglasses and dry humor, he worked alongside such musical legends as Ella Fitzgerald and Barbra Streisand on their very special evenings of song. It is hard to believe that with everything he accomplished, Ray also had to deal with a longstanding heroin problem.\n\nBy 1965, he had completely recovered. The man who lived life on the edge was divorced twice and had 12 children both in and outside his marriages.\n\nHis landmark 1962 album \"Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music\" brought a new swinging style to country music. From there, he traveled a mainstream route--from interpreting songs from The Beatles (\"Eleanor Rigby\") to appearing in \"Diet Pepsi\" ads (\"You Got the Right One, Baby, Uh-huh!\").\n\nHe made a move into the country music arena--unheard of for a black singer--in the 1960s, doing soulful spins on Hank Williams and Eddy Arnold tunes.\n\nIn 1960, he left Atlantic and signed with ABC-Paramount. Under ABC-Paramount, hits poured out during this peak time with \"I Can't Stop Loving You\", \"Hit the Road Jack\", \"Busted\" and his beloved signature song \"Georgia On My Mind\".\n\nIn the mid-1960s, he was arrested for possession of heroin and marijuana and revealed that he had been addicted for nearly two decades.\n\nHits like \"Mess Around\", \"Things I Used to Do\", \"A Fool for You\", \"I've Got a Woman\", \"Drown in My Own Tears\", and especially \"What'd I Say\" in 1959, pushed gospel and R&B to a wider crossover audience.\n\nIn 1951, he had his first solo chart buster with \"Baby Let Me Hold Your Hand\". His amazing versatility and raw, soulful delivery quickly caught on with audiences and helped put Atlantic Records on the map.\n\nRay's first R&B hit was \"Confession Blues\" in Los Angeles in 1949.\n\nHe moved to Seattle in 1948 where he and Southern guitarist Gossady McGee formed the McSon Trio. With an emphasis on easy-styled jazz, Ray also played in bebop sessions on the sly. He departed from the McSon Trio and signed with Los Angeles-based Swing Time Records, becoming the pianist for rhythm and blues great Lowell Fulson and his band. Atlantic Records eventually picked him up. Along the road he would add composer, writer and arranger to his formidable list of talents.\n\nBecame the big winner at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, receiving eight Grammy Awards for his final album, \"Genius Loves Company\" (which won for Album of the Year), and his song \"Here We Go Again\", featuring Norah Jones (which won Record of the Year).\n\nA tragic fate may have given this visionary a heightened sensitivity, perception, awareness, even expansion to his obvious musical gifts that he may have never touched upon had he not suffered from his physical affliction. Whatever it was, Ray Charles revolutionized American music and was catapulted to legendary status by the time he died in Beverly Hills at age 73. Born on September 23, 1930, to Aretha and Baily Robinson, an impoverished Albany, Georgia, family that moved to Greenville, Florida while he was still an infant. It was not a cause for joy and celebration. His father soon abandoned the family and his baby brother, George Robinson, drowned in a freak washtub accident. Ray himself developed glaucoma at the age of five and within two years had lost his sight completely. A singer in a Baptist choir, he developed a love and feel for rhythms and studied music at the State School for Deaf and Blind Children, showing which brought out his talent and ear for playing various instruments, including the piano and clarinet. An orphan by his early teens, Ray joined a country band at age 16 called The Florida Playboys.\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfp666ecKhmKuklag%3D"
