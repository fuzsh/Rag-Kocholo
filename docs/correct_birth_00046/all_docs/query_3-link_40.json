        "text": "By Derek Mead\n\nThe blind ‘genius’ who gave the world his own unique style…\n\nRay Charles was an American singer-songwriter pianist and composer. He was born Ray Charles Robinson on September 23, 1930, in Georgia, and died June 10, 2004, in Beverley Hills California aged 73.\n\nBrother Ray merged blues, jazz, rhythm ‘n’ blues with gospel styles into his recorded music in the 1950s and was involved in the merging of country music rhythm ‘n’ blues with pop music during the 1960s thus creating the soul music genre.\n\nHis styles were R&B, soul, blues, gospel, country, jazz, and rock and roll. His instruments were vocals, piano, organ, saxophone, and his labels were Atlantic, ABC, Tangerine, Warner Bros, Swingtime, Concord, Columbia, and Flashback.\n\nHis active years were 1947 to 2004. But his road to becoming a musician and a genius was far from straightforward. He was born into a complicated family and was devoted to his mother, but his brother George drowned at home when just four years old.\n\nThen Ray began to lose his sight at the age of four and was blind by seven due to glaucoma.\n\nAt the time, although his mother was uneducated, almost destitute, and mourning the loss of her son, she found a school – Florida School for the Deaf and Blind in St Augustine that accepted a blind African-American pupil. He attended from 1937 to 1945 much to his benefit. There, he furthered his obvious musical skills and learned to play Beethoven classical piano music, and others, also using Braille music, learning left hand by reading Braille with the right, with the alternative using left for right then combining.\n\nThe death of his mother in 1945 when he was 14 shocked him into the two great tragedies of his life – brother and mother – and he did not return to school. Surely, it would be beneficial for his teachers and audiences to know of his many childhood problems which were now ending, and his career, which was just beginning and which would lead him towards much success and admiration over many years.\n\nSo Ray left school moving to Jacksonville, building a reputation as a talented musician using the piano in union hall as there was none at home. But jobs were slow in coming and aged 16, he moved to Orlando living in poverty and with little food.\n\nAgain he moved on, this time to Tampa where he found two jobs and modelled his career on Nat King Cole, making his first four recordings, but playing the piano for others – although he wanted a band of his own.\n\nHowever he realised that the northern cities provided the biggest radio hits and Washington was his further destination, where he met a young Quincy Jones and played in a trio at the Rocking Chair. Then, in April 1949, the band recorded his first national hit ‘Confession Blues’, achieving No 2 on the Billboard R&B chart, and he arranged songs for names such as Cole Porter and Dizzy Gillespie.\n\nIn 1950, he moved to Los Angeles and toured. His performance impressed in Miami where he stayed in a thriving black community.\n\nHe next recorded with Swing Time Records, under his own name, two more R&B hits which reached No 5 and No 8 in 1951 and 1952. When Swing Time folded he was signed to Atlantic.\n\nRay was making progress!\n\nBetween 1952 and 1959 he made progress ahead of what was to be the height of both his career and his popularity in the 1960s, particularly the early 60s. His Atlantic recording sessions produced numbers such as ‘The Midnight Hour’ and ‘The Snow is Falling’, and in 1959 ‘What’d I Say’ reached No 6 on the Billboard Pop chart and No.1 on the Billboard R&B chart, using gospel jazz blues and Latin music.\n\nIn addition to black theatres such as the Apollo, he headlined at Carnegie Hall and the Newport Jazz Festival. His contract with Atlantic then expired in 1959 and big labels offered more than attractive deals. So he signed with ABC-Paramount in November obtaining a liberal contract compared to other artists.\n\nThen came the 1960s and Ray moved away from his troubles and the turmoil of his family, his schooldays, and his tragedies towards the lifestyle and music now to be his own. In 1960 came ‘Georgia On My Mind’, the first of three career No.1 Billboard Hot 100 hits, and in 1962, his album ‘Modern Sounds In Country And Western Music’ topped the Billboard 200 and brought country music into the musical mainstream.\n\nMultiple singles achieved the Top 40 on many Billboard charts – 44 on the US R&B singles chart – 11 on the Hot 100 singles chart and two on the Hot Country singles charts. Ray was influenced by Louis Jordan, Quincy Jones, and Frank Sinatra, who called him ‘the only true genius in show business’.\n\nBilly Joel said: “I think Ray Charles was more important than Elvis Presley.”\n\nRay received national acclaim and four Grammy Awards, with two for ‘Georgia On My Mind’. His second No.1 was ‘Hit the Road Jack’. He was increasing his small band to a big band, taking him into mainstream pop but, at the same time, heroin was found in his hotel room as was the case in another incident later in 1964.\n\nHe also avoided death in the early 1960s when his plane flying from Louisiana to Oklahoma City iced up but was safely landed and Ray named it a ‘spiritual event by someone which instruments could not detect’.\n\nIn 1962, ‘I Can’t Stop Loving You’ achieved No.l on the R&B chart for 10 weeks and gave Ray his only No.1 in the British Hit Singles chart before in 1963 ‘Busted’ was a US No.4 and ‘Take These Chains from My Heart’ was a US No.8 and No.5 in the British Hit Singles chart. Also in the 1963 British Hit Singles chart were ‘You Don’t Know Me’ No 9- ‘Your Cheating Heart’ No 13 and ‘Don’t Set Me Free’ No 37.\n\nRay achieved in total in British Hit Singles for 130 weeks, and in British Hit Albums for 50 weeks. Notably ‘Eleanor Rigby’ reached No.36 in Singles in 1968.\n\nBut from the early 1970s, his success was short-lived and his music was rarely heard on radio stations – all of this due to psychedelic rock and the harder types of rock and R&B. His radio appeal had been reduced although he continued an active recording career.\n\nIn 1972, his unique version of ‘America the Beautiful’ provoked much criticism but in 1974, Ray left ABC Records to use his own label, and in April 1979, ‘Georgia On My Mind’ was declared the state song of Georgia.\n\nIn the later years, from 1983, he signed with Columbia and recorded country albums with singers, including Chet Atkins Hank Williams Jr, and Willie Nelson, and also sang R&B with friends such as Chaka Khan Quincy Jones and Billy Joel. Ray influenced many successful singers in his career due to his many genres – Elvis Presley Stevie Wonder Van Morrison.\n\nRay’s awards for his contribution to music were numerous, including the Kennedy Centre Honours, 17 Grammy Awards, and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, with 10 of his recordings inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\nAlso Rolling Stone ranked Ray No.10 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and No.2 on their list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. There is a Star honoring Ray on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6777 Hollywood Boulevard."
