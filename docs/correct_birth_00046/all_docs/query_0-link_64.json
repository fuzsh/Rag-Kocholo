        "text": "Buy your ticket and take that midnight train to Georgia, because life in the deep south brings culture, history and darn good livin’.\n\nDue north of Tallahassee lies Albany, Georgia, where you’ll find exactly what you think of when the South comes to mind, starting with the cuisine. Comfort food, sweet tea, and fried everything will greet you, but there’s more to it than that. You’ll no doubt get your fill of soul food, but with Albany’s eclectic dining options, little is left to be desired.\n\nOnce you’ve fed your belly, you can feed your soul. This area is as synonymous with down home cooking as it is with down home music. Jazz, blues, and country, to name a few. Albany is also the birthplace of one of, if not the most famous soul singer: Mr. Ray Charles. Charles, ended up recording “Georgia On My Mind,” which today is the state song. The music of “Brother Ray” flows through the speakers at Ray Charles Plaza located along the Flint River.n.\n\nThe rich diverse ecosystem of the south is relished here, and the reason for that the Flint Riverquariun came to be; to showcase the beauty and sacredness of nature. This education center boasts interactive experiences that teach the value of H2O and how we rely on and must protect our natural resources.\n\nIf you want to experience the waters of the area up close, grab a kayak or canoe and paddle down the peaceful Flint River. Camp on the riverbanks or at Chehaw Park, otherwise known as “Nature’s Playground”. Spanning 700 acres, Chehaw Park includes an Education Center, a Children's Play Park, BMX track, Disc Golf course, and Zoo filled with 125 species including zebras, cheetahs, alligators and rhinoceroses\n\nWildlife extends beyond the borders of Longview as people relocate to the Northwest not only for the outstanding lifestyle and career opportunities, but for the area’s breathtaking natural beauty, found in both Washington and Oregon alike.\n\nThe country’s best and most beautiful great outdoors lie here and are inescapable. From the oceans to the islands, lakes to the mountains and forests to the rivers, all is within reach. And with countless natural water sources, it’s no surprise that fishing is a favored hobby. The Columbia River, specifically, is widely known for its salmon as well as steelhead, sturgeon and walleye.\n\nAside from the beautiful surroundings, Albany is also known for the powerful headlines it made in 1961 when the Albany Movement was formed. This group, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., made continuous efforts to bring attention to the inequalities and racial segregation in Georgia and across the country. Many activists claim that success during the Civil Rights Movement was partly based on the learnings and strategies that emerged from the Albany Movement. You can explore all of this and more at the Albany Civil Rights Institute.\n\nRanked by U.S. News & World Reports as #9 in Fiscal Stability, #10 for Infrastructure and #11 in Economic Rankings, Georgia is on the up and up. Here you’ll delight in comfort food, toe-tapping music and loads of southern hospitality that you can both give to your patients and surely receive from your neighbors.\n\nSo pack your bags and like Mr. Charles said, “Hit the Road Jack” and head on down to Georgia!"
