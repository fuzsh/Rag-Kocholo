        "text": "No 25: THAT LUCKY OLD SUN (JUST ROLLS AROUND HEAVEN ALL DAY)\n\nThat Lucky Old Sun was written in 1949 by Beasley Smith and Haven Gillespie and was recorded that year by Louis Armstrong. Among other top musicians to have covered the song are Willie Nelson, Frank Sinatra and Sam Cooke. Ray Charles (pictured here in 1975) recorded his version in 1963 for his album Ingredients in a Recipe for Soul. He also performed the song in the 1964 film Ballad in Blue, which starred English actor Tom Bell.\n\nRay Charles, Genius, review\n\nNo 23: I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW\n\nAthough Ray Charles's golden decades were the Fifties and Sixties, he carried on making fine music in the Seventies, including the 1977 album True to Life, which marked his return to Atlantic Records. His version of the classic Johnny Nash pop song I Can See Clearly Now is sweet and powerful. Charles, who was born Ray Charles Robinson on September 23, 1930, is seen here in a lovely photograph captured by his close friend and manager Joe Adams. Ray Charles â€“ Yes Indeed! Photographs by Joe Adams' is a limited edition book and DVD boxed set, available from Genesis Publications at www.RayCharlesBook.com\n\nNo 22: YOUR CHEATIN' HEART\n\n'I'm not a country singer. I'm a singer who sings country songs,\" said Ray Charles, who made his own classic out of Hank Williams's seminal song about heartbreak and betrayal. Ray Charles's 1962 album for Capital Records, Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, remains one of the finest country music albums of all time and includes memorable versions of two other Hank Williams songs: Hey, Good Lookin' and You Win Again. Charles continued recording great country songs all his life and his 1972 cover of the John Denver song Country Roads Take Me Home, from his album A Message from the People, is also superb.\n\nNo 21: MAKIN' WHOOPEE\n\nRay Charles had an incredible repertoire of songs and he reached back to a 1928 vaudeville song, Makin' Whoopee, written by the celebrated composer Gustav Gerson Kahn, for a live album in 1965. The risquÃ© lyrics were delivered in fine style by Charles, who was married twice and had 12 children with 10 different women.\n\n'A lot of shoes, a lot of rice, The groom is nervous, uhh, he answers twice, Its really killin', the boy's so willin', To make whoopee, whoopee, Picture a little love nest, yeah, Down where the roses cling, Picture that same sweet love nest, See what a year can bring, I tell you the boy's washin' dishes 'n, baby clothes, He's so ambitious, ooh, I tell you he sews.'\n\nThe photograph above is from Ray Charles â€“ Yes Indeed! Photographs by Joe Adams' is a limited edition book and DVD boxed set, available from Genesis Publications at www.RayCharlesBook.com\n\nNo 18: WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT YOU?\n\n\"I am very into lyrics,\" Ray Charles said. \"I start with what the words are saying, what the storyline is saying, like a good script. It should really capture me, do something for me. If I don't get it, it's not going to move people, and if it's not going to move people, it's not going to happen.\" Charles was a good songwriter himself and wrote the song What Would I Do Without You? for his brilliant 1958 Atlantic Records album Yes Indeed!\n\nThe song was one of the favourites of Van Morrison, who recorded his own version in 1984. Morrison said he was always impressed by the band Charles used on Yes Indeed!! and the musicians included the brilliant tenor saxophonist David 'Fathead' Newman.\n\nNo 17: UNCHAIN MY HEART\n\nUnchain My Heart is a song about addiction, written by drug user Bobby Sharp (1924-2013). Charles delivers it as a song of love addiction. Charles had his own drug problems from the age of 16 and was arrested for possession of heroin in 1964, an offence for which he received five years' probation. He wrote about his addiction in songs such as Let's Go Get Stoned. The photograph above showing him backstage is from Ray Charles â€“ Yes Indeed! Photographs by Joe Adams' is a limited edition book and DVD boxed set, available from Genesis Publications at www.RayCharlesBook.com\n\nNo 16: I CAN'T STOP LOVING YOU\n\nRay Charles released his version of the Don Gibson classic I Can't Stop Loving You in 1962 and it went to the top of the Billboard singles charts, staying there for five weeks. Charles sings the call-and-response song beautifully. He once said of his voice: 'When youâ€™re young, you donâ€™t know how to really use your voice, so you tend to holler instead of sing, if you know what I mean. But as you mature, you learn how to take care of your voice, and you know how to sing the notes without straining yourself. So I just sing very natural and very easy.' Charles is seen here in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers.\n\nNo 10: GEORGIA ON MY MIND\n\nOne of the songs that meant most to Ray Charles was Georgia on My Mind. Charles was the son of Aretha (William) Robinson, a sharecropper, and Bailey Robinson, a railroad mechanic, and was born in Albany, Georgia. The song was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell and Charles recorded it for his 1960 album The Genius Hits the Road.\n\nCharles (seen above performing at the Global Olympic Village in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1996) said: 'You take a song like Georgia, Iâ€™ve sung it thousands of times. But what happens is when I sing something, I never ever sing it the same way twice. And thatâ€™s not because Iâ€™m trying to be different, but itâ€™s because I sing according to what I feel that night. Every day of our lives we feel different. You donâ€™t feel the same way today as you felt yesterday â€“ you may come close, but there is a little difference, and what difference there is, makes the difference.' Charles was filled with pride when It became the official state song of the State of Georgia in 1979, saying: 'That was a big thing for me, man. It really touched me. Here is a state that used to lynch people like me suddenly declaring my version of a song as its state song. That is touching.'\n\nNo 7: MESS AROUND\n\nRay Charles's family moved to Greenville, Florida, when he was a toddler and after he turned five, he lost his sight (he had been stricken with glaucoma, it was determined years later). 'When I woke up in the mornings,' Charles recalled, 'I'd have to pry my eyes open.' He helped out with general labouring, even chopping wood, until he went to a deaf & blind school in St Augustinea, where he studied music. He first played piano when he was seven, using a neighbour's instrument. Charles always loved the playing of Pete Johnson, and Mess Around is a fine example of what a vibrant performer Charles was on the piano. 'Learning to read music in Braille and play by ear helped me develop a damn good memory,' said Charles. Mess Around is used to great effect in the film Planes, Trains and Automobiles.\n\nNo 5: LONELY AVENUE\n\n'I was born with music inside me. Music was one of my parts. Like my ribs, my kidneys, my liver, my heart. Like my blood,' said Ray Charles. 'It was a force already within me when I arrived on the scene. It was a necessity for me â€“ like food or water.' Lonely Avenue was written by Doc Pomus and became a hit for Ray Charles in 1956, helping to launch Pomus's career as a songwriter. Charles is pictured above with Willie Nelson (left) and Quincy Jones in 2000. Lonely Avenue was recorded in a tiny Miami radio station studio Atlantic were using in the mid-Fifties.\n\nWillie Nelson interview: 'Always look for hope'\n\nNo 1: WHAT'D I SAY\n\nWhat'd I Say is one of the most influential songs in popular music. Charles recalled in his autobiography, What'd I Say, that the song was accidental, something that he came to as he improvised to fill time at the end of a concert in December 1958 in Pennsylvania. Charles and his band had finished up their set list after midnight, but had 12 minutes left to fill. Charles called across to the Raelettes, 'Listen, I'm going to fool around and y'all just follow me.' The song, which blended blues, gospel, pop and soul, with stirring call-and-responses lyrics, was a groundbreaking success. The Library of Congress have placed it in the US National Recording Registry and The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame declared it as one of 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. Charles, who died on June 10, 2004, aged 73, in Beverly Hills, California, said: 'I never wanted to be famous. I only wanted to be great.' He was both.\n\nGallery compiled by Martin Chilton"
