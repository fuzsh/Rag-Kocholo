        "text": "This month’s featured piano player is the American singer, songwriter, and pianist Ray Charles. Many consider Ray as one of the most iconic and influential artists in American music history. Ray is also a true pioneer of soul music.\n\nQuick Biography\n\nAmerican piano genius Ray Charles Robinson was born on September 23, 1930, in Georgia.\n\nWhile overcoming poverty, blindness, the loss of his parents, and racism, Ray became internationally known as a musical genius. As a matter of fact, he is considered to be the father of soul music. Indeed, by using his voice as an instrument to summon a strong emotional response and by combining elements of gospel, R&B, jazz and country music, he stood out in the music scene. In 1960, Ray won his first Grammy Award for “Georgia on My Mind,” followed by another Grammy for the single “Hit the Road, Jack.” He had his first hits in the early 1950’s and was still at the top of the charts later in his career. For many years, Ray Charles struggled with a heroin addiction, but he eventually managed to kick the habit at a clinic.\n\nSadly, he died at 73 years old, in 2004, at his home in Beverly Hills, California. Impressively , more than 1,500 people came to the funeral to say goodbye to the musical legend. Great musicians such as B.B. King, Willie Nelson and Stevie Wonder were among those who performed at the service. During his lifetime, Ray Charles recorded more than 60 albums and performed more than 10,000 concerts. His final album, Genius Loves Company, was released two months after he died.\n\nInteresting Facts about Ray\n\nBeing a very talented child, Ray learned how to play the organ, saxophone, clarinet and trumpet in spite of his blindness.\n\nWhile in a rehabilitation program at the hospital, Ray began playing chess. He maintained a passion for the game and had his own chess boards made, one of which is now in the American History Museum.\n\nThere is a movie on Ray’s life, Ray, where Jamie Foxx starred as the legendary pianist, winning an Academy Award for his performance.\n\nRay Charles also wrote an autobiographical book, Brother Ray, in which he tells his honest life story in his own words.\n\nRemarkably, the famous pianist was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nJonny May plays Ray Charles’ “Georgia on my Mind”\n\nIn this video, Jonny pays tribute to Ray Charles by playing “Georgia on my Mind” with his eyes closed for the entire piece. Indeed, he arranged this song in honor of the piano legend who first recorded it in 1960.\n\nNotably, Ray Charles, being born in the state of Georgia, is the one who made the song famous. It was originally written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell. Initially, Ray was banned from performing in his home state of Georgia, because he refused to play segregated shows. However, in 1979, the State of Georgia designated Ray’s version the official state song. The song has since become part of the Great American Songbook tradition.\n\nPlaying blindfolded may seem intimidating at first, but developing this skill is well worth it!
