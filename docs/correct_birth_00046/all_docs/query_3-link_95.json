        "text": "Introduction\n\nFor over five decades, Charles Ray (born Chicago, 1953) has experimented with a wide range of methods, including performance, photography, and sculpture, the medium for which he is recognized today. In the process, he has mined the tradition of Western art, mobilized the power of materials, and pioneered major advances in sculptural production, combining the analogue and the digital. Ray’s intriguing and occasionally bracing work addresses not only art history, popular culture, and mass media but also identity, mortality, race, and gender in sometimes provocative, often irreverent ways. Throughout, he has remained deeply invested in exploring the fundamental relationships between form and space, figure and ground.\n\nRay studied at the University of Iowa and Rutgers University, where he was exposed to a variety of artistic approaches, including modernist sculpture, intermedia arts, and process-based performance. In 1981 he moved to Los Angeles, where he continues to work today. Situated at The Met, whose collection the artist has long studied, Charles Ray: Figure Ground unites sculptures from every period of his career with key photographs from the 1970s to explore central aspects of his oeuvre. The works have been intentionally arranged in order to forge subtle connections between objects as well as between objects and viewers. Similar to a scholar’s stone, which is meant to facilitate and prolong thoughtful contemplation, Ray’s sculpture poses many trenchant questions but answers none directly.\n\nThe following Visiting Guide offers four points of entry for exploring the sculptures and photographs in Charles Ray: Figure Ground. Each one revolves around a different idea, approach, or technique animating Ray’s work across time and media. Any one piece might relate to multiple points of entry. We invite you to make connections by considering the material below."
