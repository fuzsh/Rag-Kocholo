        "text": "Husband of [private wife (1920s - unknown)]\n\n[children unknown]\n\nProfile last modified 8 Jun 2024 | Created 26 Sep 2020\n\nThis page has been accessed 3,196 times.\n\nBiography\n\nRay Robinson is Notable.\n\nRay Charles was an American singer, songwriter and pianist who is regarded as being one of the most iconic and influential singers in history.[1]\n\nRay was born 23 Sept 1930, Albany, Georgia, son of Bailey Rhum Robinson and Aretha Williams.[2] Aretha had been abandoned by her father when her mother died, and was informally adopted by Bailey and Mary Jane Robinson. Aretha was 12 and took the last name of Robinson.\n\nHis father, Bailey, worked as a \"Gandy Dancer\" for the railroad, setting spikes. His mother was a laundress. They were not married. Bailey was married to Mary Jane Young at the time Ray was born. Aretha was 15.[3] Bailey and Aretha had two children together:\n\nRay Charles Robinson 1930 - 2004\n\nGeorge Robinson 1931 - 1935\n\nThe first major tragedy in Ray's life was seeing his younger brother drown when he was about five years old. Ray started to lose his sight at the age of five,[3] and was blind by the age of seven, apparently as a result of glaucoma.[4] Destitute, uneducated, and mourning the loss of her younger son, Aretha Robinson used her connections in the local community to find a school that would accept a blind African-American pupil. Despite his initial protest, Ray attended school at the Florida School for the Deaf and the Blind in St. Augustine from 1937 to 1945.[3]\n\nRay Charles' mother died in the spring of 1945, when Ray was 14. Her death came as a shock to him; he later said the deaths of his brother and mother were \"the two great tragedies\" of his life. Ray decided not to return to school after the funeral.\n\nAfter leaving school, Ray moved to Jacksonville to live with Charles Wayne Powell, who had been friends with his late mother. He played the piano for bands at the Ritz Theatre in LaVilla for over a year, earning $4 a night. Ray eventually started to write arrangements for a pop music band, and in the summer of 1947 he unsuccessfully auditioned to play piano for Lucky Millinder and his sixteen-piece band.[5]\n\nIn 1947, Ray moved to Tampa, where he had two jobs: one was as a pianist for Charles Brantley's Honey Dippers. Ray had always played piano for other people, but he was keen to have his own band. He decided to leave Florida for a large city, and, considering Chicago and New York City too big, followed his friend Gossie McKee to Seattle, Washington, in March of 1948. With Ray on piano, McKee on guitar and Milton Garrett on bass, the McSon trio (named for McKee and Robinson) started playing the one-to-five A.M. shift at the Rocking Chair. Publicity photos of the trio are some of the earliest known photographs of Ray Charles. In April 1949, he and his band recorded \"Confession Blues\", which became his first national hit. He dropped the Robinson from his name so as not to be confused with Sugar Ray Robinson and became Ray Charles.\n\nRay Charles pioneered the soul music genre during the 1950s by combining blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and gospel styles into the music he recorded for Atlantic. He contributed to the integration of country music, rhythm and blues, and pop music during the 1960s with his crossover success on ABC Records, notably with his two Modern Sounds albums. While he was with ABC, Charles became one of the first black musicians to be granted artistic control by a mainstream record company.\n\nCharles' 1960 hit \"Georgia On My Mind\" was the first of his three career No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. His 1962 album Modern Sounds In Country And Western Music became his first album to top the Billboard 200. Charles had multiple singles reach the Top 40 on various Billboard charts: 44 on the US R&B singles chart, 11 on the Hot 100 singles chart, 2 on the Hot Country singles charts. \"Georgia On My Mind\" was chosen as the Georgia state song in 1979.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nRay was married twice, but had multiple affairs over his lifetime. His first marriage to Eileen Williams lasted from July 31, 1951 until 1952. No issue.\n\nRay married second, Della Beatrice Howard on April 5, 1955 in Texas. Together they had three children:\n\nRay Charles Robinson Jr. 1955\n\nDavid Robinson 1958 - 2013\n\nRobert Robinson 1960\n\nDue to his heroin drug addiction, extramarital affairs on tours and volatile behavior, the marriage deteriorated and they divorced after 22 years of marriage in 1977.[6]\n\nRay fathered a total of 12 children with ten different women:\n\nEvelyn Robinson, born in 1949 (daughter with Louise Flowers)\n\nRay Charles Robinson Jr., born May 25, 1955 (son with wife Della Bea Robinson)\n\nDavid Robinson, born in 1958 (son with wife Della Bea Robinson)\n\nCharles Wayne Hendricks, born on October 1, 1959 (son with Margie Hendricks, one of The Raelettes)\n\nRobert Robinson, born in 1960 (son with wife Della Bea Robinson)\n\nRenee Robinson, born in 1961 (daughter with Mae Mosely Lyles)\n\nSheila Robinson, born in 1963 (daughter with Sandra Jean Betts)\n\nReatha Butler, born in 1966\n\nAlexandra Bertrand, born in 1968 (daughter with Mary-Chantal Bertrand)\n\nVincent Kotchounian, born in 1977 (son with Arlette Kotchounian)\n\nRobyn Moffett, born in 1978 (daughter with Gloria Moffett)\n\nRyan Corey Robinson den Bok, born in 1987 (son with Mary Anne den Bok)\n\nRay held a family luncheon for his twelve children in 2002, ten of whom attended. He told them he was mortally ill and $500,000 had been placed in trusts for each of the children to be paid out over the next five years.[7]\n\nIn 2003, Charles had successful hip replacement surgery and was planning to go back on tour, until he began suffering from other ailments. He died at his home in Beverly Hills, California of complications resulting from liver failure,[8] on June 10, 2004, at the age of 73.[2] His funeral took place on June 18, 2004, at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles with numerous musical figures in attendance. He is buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery, Inglewood, Los Angeles County, California. [9]\n\nRay Charles had a net worth 100-million-dollars at the time of his death.[10]\n\nIn 2016, U.S. President Barack Obama said, \"Ray Charles's version of America the Beautiful will always be in my view the most patriotic piece of music ever performed.\"\n\nSources\n\n↑ Wikipedia: Ray_Charles\n\n↑ 2.0 2.1 Social Security: \"U.S., Social Security Applications and Claims Index, 1936-2007\"\n\nSocial Security Applications and Claims, 1936-2007\n\nAncestry Record 60901 #23680149\n\nName: R C Robinson [Ray Charles]; Gender: Male; Race: Black; Birth Date: 23 Sep 1929; Birth Place: Albany, Georgia; Death Date: 10 Jun 2004; Father: Bailey Robinson; Mother: Reatha Williams; Notes: Feb 1946: Name listed as R C ROBINSON; Oct 1960: Name listed as RAY CHARLES.\n\n↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 \"Brother Ray\".
