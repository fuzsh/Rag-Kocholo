        "text": "Charles’s childhood innocence was shattered at age 5 with the tragic loss of his younger brother, George, who drowned in the family’s outdoor bathtub. A few months later, Charles began to experience eye problems. They began tearing, and over time the tears turned to mucus, so thick that Charles would have difficulty opening his eyes in the early morning. It was soon discovered that Charles was suffering from glaucoma.\n\nCharles recalls being relatively undisturbed by his worsening condition, perhaps because the deterioration occurred over two years. It was a gradual process that began with blurred images and culminated in a state of total blindness. Aretha actively sought opinions and advice on his condition and, through contacts in the white community, she learned about the State School for the Blind in St. Augustine. It was determined the young Charles would learn to read and write.\n\nIn September, 1947, seven-year-old Charles left home for the state school. He missed home life yet wasn’t averse to school, and it was within these walls his prodigious gifts blossomed.\n\nIt was year two when Charles began receiving formal music lessons. As mentioned in Brother Ray: “You could see how important the piano was to me, even at eight. When I was a kid, I never thought about being famous or rich, but I did think about being great. I wanted to be a great musician, and, early on, I understood who the great musicians were, I could hear them. From the earliest days, I was interested in winning the respect of genuine musicians. High standards had been set for me. I knew what real blues singing and boogie-woogie were all about. I had learned about jazz piano. The older I got, the more-keen the competition became. Musically, I was raised during a time of absolutely no compromise. Either you could play your instrument, or you couldn’t.”\n\nThe lone radio at school played the melodies of Glenn Miller, Tommy Dorsey, Glen Gray, Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Art Tatum and Oscar Peterson, whom Charles took to imitating, especially the hits of the day. At age 11, he was beginning to write his own arrangements and compositions, and in the years that followed he learned to compose in Braille.\n\nIn May of 1945, Charles was suddenly orphaned when Aretha died. Grief-stricken by tragedy, he left school and moved to Jacksonville, Fla., to pursue a career in music. The next 10 years, Charles criss-crossed the south absorbing a variety of influences, borrowing generously from blues singer Charles Brown and jazz pianist Nat “King” Cole.\n\nIn 1949, Charles travelled west to Seattle, formed the McSon Trio, and made his first recordings. During a session in Los Angeles, Charles cut an original called Baby, Let Me Hold Your Hand. He sang in a Charles Brown style, smooth blues with gentle bends between notes. It turned out to be his first hit, appearing on the R&B charts and selling 100,000 copies over two to three years.\n\nThe pre-Atlantic years are some of his most memorable. Charles’s voice carries the suffering he felt with the loss of his mother and he sounds like a man three times his age. The blues notes fell under his fingers as if they were tied directly to each beat of his ailing soul. The lyrics flow directly from the heart — I’m Just a Lonely Boy, All to Myself Alone, Misery In My Heart, A Sentimental Blues and Blues Is My Middle Name. All spoke of similar themes.\n\nIn the 1950s, Charles found a new musical context for the blues. Like Louis Armstrong’s band, his innovative style became popular and influential among players looking to bridge the past with the present. His arranging became the model of all the great rhythm and blues bands to follow, from James Brown to the Muscle Shoals groups, the Memphis Horns and Tower of Power. The primary function of the writing was to give the singer a jolt. This, in turn, would help Charles create dozens of major hits.\n\nCharles’s septet was patterned after the Basie nonet of the 1930s. He would take the rhythmic shape of gospel songs and replace the lyrics with his own words. He’d then blend in country blues, a bit of jazz and the jump music of stylist Louis Jordan. This new sound produced I Got a Woman, What’d I Say, Drown in My Own Tears, Just for a Thrill, and Let the Good Times Roll for Atlantic Records.\n\nLater, some of his best small-group work was captured on ABC Records when he recorded I Wonder, Sticks and Stones, Unchain My Heart, Hit the Road Jack, and his biggest hit, Georgia on My Mind.\n\nThe early years of popular music are ones many of us will cherish forever. Corporate domination of music hadn’t yet taken hold. Artists made records that served some inner yearning. The lyrics and music encapsulated periods of great internal conflict in two- and three-minute intervals. At times the music was therapeutic, especially when the artist found a moral solution that worked for all of us. At others, it was all part of our daily calendar — the backdrop to work and play. Oh, how simple yet complicated life was when all you had to do was address what was stirring in the heart and sing before anyone who would listen. There always seemed to be a willing audience. Georgia!"
