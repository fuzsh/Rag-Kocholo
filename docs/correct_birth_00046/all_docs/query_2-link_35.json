He was born Ray Charles Robinson on September 23<sup>rd</sup>, 1930 in Albany, Georgia, to Aretha Williams and Bailey Robinson. His mother was a sharecropper and his father was a labourer.

Pitman taught Ray how to play, but at the age of 4 he was already beginning to lose his sight. Ray was blind by the age of 7 due to glaucoma. Ray attended the Florida School for the Deaf and Blind in St. Augustine Florida from 1937 until 1945. He furthered his musical education while there, learning braille music as well. After his mother's death when he was 15 he began to pursue music professionally.",
