The Berlin Technische Hochschule was founded in 1879 through the union of two considerably older academies, the Bauakademie (Building Academy, founded in 1799) and the Gewerbeinstitut (Vocational Training Academy, founded in 1821). It later, in 1916, incorporated the former Bergakademie (Mining Academy, founded in 1770). These three academies were institutions whose teachers were not expected to do scientific research as such, and the teachers offered their training courses avocationally. It was not until 1856 that the first regular professorship of mathematics was established at the Gewerbeinstitut, a position first occupied by Karl Weierstrass (1815-1897). Only in 1895 was such a professorship created at the Bergakademie, its first occupant being Fritz KÃ¶tter (1857-1912). The Bauakademie was never provided with a professorship in mathematics.
