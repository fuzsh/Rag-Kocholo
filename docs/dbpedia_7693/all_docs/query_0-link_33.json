        "text": "Citation preview\n\nAnachronisms in the History of Mathematics The controversial matters surrounding the notion of anachronism are difficult ones: they have been broached by literary and art critics, by philosophers, as well as by historians of science. This book adopts a bottom-up approach to the many problems concerning anachronism in the history of mathematics. Some of the leading scholars in the field of history of mathematics reflect on the applicability of present-day mathematical language, concepts, standards, disciplinary boundaries, indeed notions of mathematics itself, to well-chosen historical case studies belonging to the mathematics of the past, in European and non-European cultures. A detailed introduction describes the key themes and binds the various chapters together. The interdisciplinary and transcultural approach adopted allows this volume to cover topics important for history of mathematics, history of the physical sciences, history of science, philosophy of mathematics, history of philosophy, methodology of history, non-European science, and the transmission of mathematical knowledge across cultures.\n\nn i c c o l o` g u i c c i a r d i n i is Professor in History of Science at the State University of Milan.

The workshop took place in Pasadena in April 2018 in the context of the Francis Bacon Award in the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology, which I had the honor of receiving from the Francis Bacon Foundation and the California Institute of Technology. The scholars that convened in Pasadena contributed excellent talks and engaged in a wonderful discussion. The present volume gathers much improved and expanded versions of most of the talks, while one chapter (Goulding’s) has been commissioned for the production of this volume. I express my gratitude to all the authors for their wonderful commitment: this volume was made possible by their enthusiasm, competence, and impeccable scholarship.\n\nPlan of the book The book opens with a chapter in which I have tried to provide a definition of “anachronism” as well as an overview of the different positions concerning anachronism taken by historians of mathematics. This chapter originally consisted of just a few pages, but the invitation of two anonymous referees and questions from the Cambridge editor, David Tranah, somewhat “compelled” me to expand it into a rather long essay. a\n\nFrom Anachronisms in the History of Mathematics: Essays on the Historical Interpretation of Mathematical Texts, edited by Niccolò Guicciardini © 2021 Cambridge University Press.\n\nxvii https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nxviii\n\nPreface\n\nIn the introductory Chapter 1 I ask some of the questions that, in my opinion, deserve our attention and that indeed find different answers by the authors of this volume. The issue of anachronism is a vexed one in historical interpretation, but is particularly thorny when one attempts to historicize a discipline that is, perhaps naively, celebrated for being independent of the context. The reader will notice the central importance I give to the work of Henk Bos, a historian of Descartes’s and Leibniz’s mathematics who has, I believe, defined a historical methodology, based on the notions of “tasks and criteria of quality control,” which answers in a very original and promising way the many issues raised by the use of anachronisms in the historical interpretation of past mathematical texts. One of the most fascinating features of this book, which I highlight in Chapter 1, is that for the historian of mathematics anachronism is not per se a sin we should try our best to avoid. There are indeed inevitable, even virtuous, ways in which our present knowledge of mathematics plays a positive heuristic role in the interpretation of past mathematical texts. But the projection of our present knowledge onto the past can lead to erroneous readings too. The authors of the following chapters broach the theme of the book by considering case studies taken from their own fields of expertise. Karine Chemla identifies a kind of anachronism which she terms “textual anachronism,” and which is most widespread in the history of mathematics. It consists in taking the forms of texts and inscriptions that we read in ancient sources (e.g., a mathematical problem, an algorithm, a proof, a diagram) as being the same as their modern counterparts. This kind of anachronism has caused misinterpretations of several kinds. Chemla examines how some ancient Chinese procedures were read successively by Edouard Biot (1803–1850), Mikami Yoshio (1875–1950), Joseph Needham (1900–1995), and Wang Ling (1917–1994). Thanks to a close analysis of the texts, she shows how the assumptions about these procedures that each of these authors made, and the material conditions of their work, influenced the views they formulated about the mathematics of ancient China. In the last part of her chapter, Chemla argues that the development of algorithms by mathematicians such as Donald Knuth since the 1950s has introduced new mathematical ideas that can be deployed to interpret ancient texts less anachronistically. What is fascinating about Chemla’s chapter is that it demonstrates how a very recent viewpoint brought about by a research program on numerical algorithms\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPreface\n\nxix\n\ncan lead to a reading of ancient Chinese mathematics that is valuable for the historian of mathematics. Our present knowledge of mathematics, can thus, in this case, be a heuristically fruitful tool for the historian. The lineal descent of fundamental ideas and methods in modern mathematics from classical antiquity makes the concept of “anachronism” a natural concern when studying pre-modern successors to Hellenistic mathematics: are we projecting our own awareness of modern versions and developments of these ideas onto earlier thinkers? Kim Plofker introduces another fundamental concept. In studying the history of other mathematical traditions such as those of India and China, we should be aware of a form of projection that is more geographical in nature than temporal: what she calls “anachorism.” For instance, when we label/equate an ancient non-Greek mathematical development with its European “equivalent,” our interpretation is not so much “out of time” as “out of place.” Important aspects of this combined phenomenon of anachron/chorism include its potential for both insights and misunderstandings in the reading of texts (both of which arise in the historiographical controversy about whether the infinitesimal mathematics of the late medieval Kerala school of south India amounts to “calculus”). Thus, Plofker throws into relief the tension, so characteristic of the history of mathematics, between the mathematical search for the equivalence between results expressed in texts separated by time and distance, and the recognition of their situatedness. As she shows, in trying a trade-off between these two aims one risks falling into either Eurocentric teleology (what is praiseworthy about fourteenth-century M¯adhava’s results is their proximity to Newton’s) or orientalism (M¯adhava’s results are incommensurably “Indian”). Jacqueline Feke examines the relationship between mathematics and philosophy in Greek antiquity, and the perspectives brought to the study of ancient Greek thought by modern historians. For the ancient Greeks, mathematics was part of philosophy, along with physics and theology. Modern disciplinary differences between philosophy and mathematics are reflected in the approach that historians of philosophy take to classical Greek texts today. The implicit modern separation of mathematics and philosophy is imposed anachronistically on the study of ancient Greek thought, where no such separation existed. The examination of some ancient Greek mathematical texts, moreover, reveals that some mathematicians were aiming to solve the traditional, most fundamental,\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nxx\n\nPreface\n\nproblems of philosophy, understood, as Pierre Hadot has argued, as a way to attain a “good life” and a just society. Feke’s chapter thus deals with the form of anachronism concerning disciplinary boundaries that I discuss in Chapter 1 in relation to Geoffrey Lloyd’s work. Martina Schneider examines a nineteenth-century European example of mathematical reconstruction pertaining to the history of Chinese mathematics. In 1852 the English missionary Alexander Wylie published “Jottings on the Science of Chinese Arithmetics” in the North-China Herald. This article was “translated” into German by Karl Biernatzki in 1856. Biernatzki rearranged and changed Wylie’s text, thereby adding mistakes. This led to an unfavorable evaluation of Chinese arithmetic by Moritz Cantor and Hermann Hankel. Ludwig Matthiessen, professor of physics in Rostock, spotted Biernatzki’s mistakes regarding the dayan rule (the Chinese remainder theorem). On the basis of the translated paper on Chinese mathematics and a close study of its examples, Matthiessen was able to reconstruct the dayan rule for arbitrary moduli and discussed conditions of solvability. He stressed that the Chinese had “exactly the same” method as Gauss, for moduli that were relatively prime, and pointed out that they even had one for not relatively prime moduli, thus surpassing Gauss. This finding led to a more favorable reception of Chinese mathematics. Schneider points to the complexity of the time structure (pluritemporality, in Achim Landwehr’s terminology) at work in the example. Indeed, Landwehr, rejecting a linear conception of historical time and elaborating in its stead a more complex time scheme (pluritemporality), has rethought the concept of anachronism. Schneider, following Landwehr and Reinhart Koselleck, argues that the case of Matthiessen’s historical reconstruction of the dayan rule can be seen as productive of new knowledge about the mathematical past. The final part of this philosophically deep chapter is devoted to study the conditions under which mathematical reconstructions can become a heuristic tool in the history of mathematics generating new hypotheses and interpretations. She concludes that in the dynamic process of historical interpretation, historiographically sensitive mathematical reconstructions (such as Matthiessen’s), even when based on seemingly erroneous historiographical methods (no use of original sources, use of contemporary mathematics), might lead to a deeper understanding of mathematical traces of the past. Robert Goulding devotes his chapter to Petrus Ramus’s Prooemium\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPreface\n\nxxi\n\nMathematicum (1567), one of the most influential Renaissance histories of mathematics. Goulding carefully analyses three, for us obvious, mistakes in Ramus’s narrative: his account of the early Platonic Academy as dominated by anti-metaphysical materialists, his evaluation of the work of Eudoxus of Cnidus, and the significance for his philosophy of mathematics of a gross misdating of the neo-Platonic commentator of Euclid, Proclus. Goulding’s chapter is the most telling proof that the history of anachronism can generate historical insights that make us aware both of the distance of past authors from our own present viewpoint – a viewpoint that would make our predecessors’ anachronism impossible – and of the contingency of our own present narrative of the mathematical past, which – for sure – will be seen as anachronistic by our successors. As Goulding observes in his conclusion, when we criticize Renaissance historiography for being “anachronistic,” we should neither forget how recently modern understandings of the history of mathematics and of philosophy emerged, nor miss the fact that the Renaissance history of mathematics answered desiderata situated in contemporary conceptions of university pedagogy and the philosophy of mathematics. Niccolò Guicciardini discusses the dangers and advantages we encounter when we translate past mathematics into our modern language. An apparently innocent (and ever so slight!) change in notation in rewriting a differential equation by Johann Bernoulli in such a way that it can be received in our textbooks leads to a way of writing that would have been disowned by its author – and for reasons that were explicitly discussed in his correspondence with Leibniz. By rewriting the equation according to our conventions, we miss how this equation should have been written in order to fulfill what Bos calls the “self-imposed tasks” Bernoulli had in mind. On the other hand, a modernizing (domesticating in Lawrence Venuti’s terms) translation delivers a number of advantages that Guicciardini discusses in concluding his chapter. Leonhard Euler is celebrated for his contributions to the calculus of variations and the theory of infinite series. According to Craig Fraser and Andrew Schroter, certain concepts from these subjects occupy a fundamental place in modern analysis, but do not appear in the work of either Euler or his contemporaries. In the case of variational calculus there is the concept of the invariance of the variational equations which several historians read back into Euler’s work. Further, modern commentators such as Morris Kline believe that the theory of summa-\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nxxii\n\nPreface\n\nbility – developed at the end of the nineteenth century by Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, Ernesto Cesàro, and others – may be found in Euler’s work on divergent series. This thesis is in line with the view of some historians, such as Adolph-Andrei Pavlovich Yushkevich, that Euler possessed a kind of visionary intuition of mathematical concepts and lines of development that would only develop much later. Fraser and Schroter examine the anachronism implicit in this point of view. Euler understood divergent series as things that were given as part of objective reality, and not simply defined in such a way as to make them whatever the investigator wishes them to be, as they are in summability theory. The subject of summability grew out of researches in complex analysis within a mathematical framework that was foreign to Euler’s mathematics. In their conclusion, Fraser and Schroter comment on some parallels between claims for the historiographical relevance of summability theory and non-Archimedean analysis. Fraser and Schroter’s chapter illustrates what is perhaps the most typical kind of anachronism in the history of mathematics, the kind which occurs when an object at first assumed as given becomes in a later period the result of contested deliberations. Definitions are not fixed and unchangeable, but often have to be fine-tuned in the light of later understanding. In his classic Proofs and Refutations Imre Lakatos has shown how this phenomenon can occur in the case of polyhedra. With Jemma Lorenat’s chapter we move into the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. She observes that by the early twentieth century projective geometry had come to be seen as an approach to geometry that was essentially non-metric. This conception is apparent, for instance, in Oswald Veblen and John W. Young’s 1910 book on the subject. While historians and mathematicians anachronistically attributed the conception to JeanVictor Poncelet, the French geometer in fact employed metric notions in his definition of cross ratio in a fundamental way. The same holds true for other early-nineteenth-century geometers, such as Michel Chasles and Jakob Steiner, who, according to a recurrent historical narrative, are depicted as striving and failing to create a non-metric projective geometry. Not until Karl Georg von Staudt’s Geometrie der Lage in 1847 were projective properties defined as properly non-metric. Lorenat challenges this historical narrative, which does not capture the aims of mathematicians such as Poncelet, whose work is read under the assumption that they shared the same agenda of mathematicians belonging to\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPreface\n\nxxiii\n\nlater generations. Non-metric projective geometry developed alongside an increased focus on the axiomatic foundations of geometry in latenineteenth and early-twentieth-century research. Authors writing at this time tended to read a foundational interest that was not there into the work of early-nineteenth-century authors. Jeremy Gray examines Roberto Bonola’s influential history of nonEuclidean geometry La Geometria non Euclidea: Esposizione StoricoCritica del suo Sviluppo, published in 1906, focusing on Bonola’s account of Lobachevskii’s work. Bonola was writing within an educational tradition prevalent in early-twentieth-century Italy that drew a distinction between elementary and advanced mathematics. Elementary geometry was geometry in the style of Euclid, perhaps updated to include axiomatic ideas in the manner of Moritz Pasch and David Hilbert. Advanced geometry was the differential geometry of Bernhard Riemann and Eugenio Beltrami. Bonola anachronistically placed Lobachevskii within the tradition of elementary geometry, and in doing so missed the central importance for Lobachevskii’s pioneering work of basing geometry on a primitive concept of distance and of establishing non-Euclidean geometry through the formulae of hyperbolic trigonometry. Both Lorenat’s and Gray’s chapters are closely related in their focus on nineteenth-century geometry and in that they deal with the situatedness of disciplinary boundaries. Yet, their discussions bring out different aspects of anachronism. In her chapter, Lorenat discusses a two-part anachronism: on the one hand, the identification of a body of mathematical work as work concerned with projective geometry, and, on the other hand, the assumption that anything called projective geometry had to have a program for developing a non-metric geometry. Gray’s chapter looks at the portrayal of the two central figures in early non-Euclidean geometry, Lobachevskii and János Bolyai. Gray examines the misunderstanding of their work by Bonola. This misunderstanding partly arises from an anachronistic view of what is elementary and what is not. He shows how this then affects how one sees the development of a mathematical subject, in particular the degree to which Riemann’s work represented a leap or step forward in the development of nonEuclidean geometry. Lorenat’s anachronism, accordingly, concerns the validity of characterizing an area of mathematics in terms of its content and presumed purpose, while Gray focuses on the mathematical methods employed and their characterization as either elementary or advanced.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nxxiv\n\nPreface\n\nIn his broad-ranging concluding chapter, Joseph Dauben presents examples of anachronism in the history of mathematics, two that involve non-standard analysis and several concerning historical accounts of ancient Chinese mathematics. A case study that is perhaps not widely known concerns the 1989 attempt by philosopher Hilary Putnam to use ideas from non-standard analysis (in a suitably qualified form) to illuminate Charles Peirce’s conception of continuity, set forth by Peirce in one of the Cambridge Conferences Lectures (1898). Dauben argues that Putnam’s study provides an instance of the successful application of anachronistic “rational reconstructions” in the history of mathematics. On the other hand, using Cantorian alephs to examine Peirce’s conception of the infinite is obfuscating. In the second part of his chapter, Dauben examines examples from ancient Chinese mathematics that have been read in misleading anachronistic ways. Dauben shows that the translation of technical terms from ancient Chinese into modern English, or the use of diagrams and geometrical arguments foreign to ancient Chinese mathematical practice, can lead to serious misinterpretations. Dauben’s learned chapter thus concludes the book by warning us about the risks in looking for the “predecessors who ‘got it right’ ” with the aim of discovering the “path to our current truths” or the “royal road to me,” as Naomi Oreskes and Ivor Grattan-Guinness wrote in seminal papers cited in the closing lines of the chapter. It is fitting to conclude the volume with a chapter written by a historian who has been so authoritative in defending the idea that mathematical thought should be seen as punctuated with discontinuities. Avoiding anachronism, from Dauben’s viewpoint, is crucial for a historical narrative that recognizes the existence of “conceptual revolutions” in mathematics. Some of the themes explored by the authors concern the cultural situatedness of disciplinary boundaries, styles, and genres of writing in mathematics; the inevitable use of translations and the importance of being aware of the hermeneutic possibilities and possible dangers of the renderings of mathematical formulas in different mathematical languages; the opportunities and the difficulties implied in attempts to conceive the interpretation of past mathematical texts as dependent upon the understanding of authorial tasks and criteria of adequacy; the study of past mathematical texts through the history of their reception; the con-\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.001 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\nPreface\n\nxxv\n\ntrasting readings and evaluations of past mathematics achieved through a change in the historian’s perspective. All these are daunting and wellstudied topics, which have been dealt with by an intimidating array of philosophically minded scholars. These vexed problems, though, acquire a different status because of the peculiar character of mathematical thought. As historians, we hope to have contributed to this debate by adopting a bottom-up approach, which is to say by offering the reader a rich palette of historical cases.

To be sure, unchecked anachronism is the stuff of popular myth [. . . ] . Nevertheless, historical thinking should be concerned above all else with understanding temporality, how the present arises out of the past. So it will do no good to treat the past as its own country subject to no other law but its own and severed from moments in time that precede or succeed it (Lynch, 2004, pp. 241–2).\n\nAbstract: I provide a definition of “anachronism” as well as an overview of the different positions concerning anachronism taken by historians of mathematics, since the important debate on the “algebra” of the Babylonians and the “geometrical algebra” of Euclid and Apollonius. Should we stress the continuity of past mathematics with the mathematics practiced today, or should we emphasize its difference, namely what makes it a product of a distant, Babylonian or Greek, mathematical culture? The issue of anachronism is a vexed one in historical interpretation, but is particularly thorny when one attempts to historicize a discipline that is, perhaps naively, celebrated for being independent of the context. The overview made available in this chapter provides the reader with information on the historiographical background against which the following chapters have been written. a b\n\n1\n\nFrom Anachronisms in the History of Mathematics: Essays on the Historical Interpretation of Mathematical Texts, edited by Niccolò Guicciardini © 2021 Cambridge University Press. This research was funded by the Department of Philosophy “Piero Martinetti” of the University of Milan under the Project “Departments of Excellence 2018–2022” awarded by the Ministry of Education, University and Research (MIUR). To quote Febvre in full: “le problème est d’arrêter avec exactitude la série des précautions à prendre, des prescriptions à observer pour éviter le péché des péchés – le péché entre tous irrémissible: l’anachronisme” (Febvre, 1947, p. 5).\n\n1 https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n2\n\nGuicciardini: Introduction 1.1 Purpose of this book\n\nThe debate on anachronism has been a long and vexed one in the field of historical interpretation. Forms of anachronism are often declared the greatest failure a historian can commit – almost a moral sin, as exemplified by Lucien Febvre’s words quoted in the epigraph. Yet, many have spoken in favor of anachronism, considering it an inevitable, if not desirable, feature of historical works (Lynch, 2004; Jardine, 2000a). Historians of mathematics have also discussed this issue, sometimes in polemical terms. The example of the quarrel concerning the notion of “geometrical algebra” in ancient Greek mathematics begun by Sabetai Unguru on which we will have more to say below comes to mind. The purpose of this volume is to reflect on the “uses and abuses” of anachronism in the historical study of the mathematical sciences. 2 The debate among historians of mathematics is polarized in relation to two key issues: the legitimacy of translations of past mathematics into modern language, and the legitimacy of evaluations of past mathematics according to standards accepted today. The first question emerges when, for example, we employ algebraic equations in order to analyze Galileo’s kinematics, which was expressed in terms of proportions. 3 Thus, Galileo’s statement that the distances of fall are proportional to the square of the times might be translated as s = (g/2) t 2 . Yet, Galileo did not have algebraic equations at his disposal and even expressed ideas concerning the applicability of mathematics to the science of motion at odds with the application of algebra to continuous magnitudes, such as distance and time (Giusti, 1993; Blay, 1998). The second question emerges when, to give another well-known example, one claims that the handling of infinitesimal magnitudes by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and by eighteenth-century mathematicians in general, lacks rigor, and that a logically tight version of the calculus was provided in the nineteenth century by the likes of Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass. Yet, Leibniz discussed the nature of differentials at length, and many eighteenth-century mathematicians had their own way 2 3\n\nI avail myself of Nicholas Jardine’s turn of phrase in Jardine (2000a). A similar well-studied problem in translation emerges when one interprets the so-called Renaissance “abacus” or “Coss” problem-solving techniques in terms of symbolic algebra, that is, in terms of an algebraic language that was developed in the seventeenth century. See Corry (2015, pp. 125–53).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.2 Defining anachronism\n\n3\n\nof making sense of the definition and use of infinitesimal magnitudes (Malet, 1996; Mancosu, 1996). The controversial matters surrounding the notion of anachronism are difficult ones: they have been often broached by literary and art critics, by philosophers, as well as by historians of science divided, most notably, over the issue of Whiggism. 4 This book has not been written to attempt to provide an answer, even though its authors found the above debates illuminating. Rather, we would like to propose a bottom-up approach to the many problems concerning anachronisms in the history of mathematics. We are historians, and what we wish to do is to open our toolboxes and see what happens when we apply present mathematical language, concepts, standards, disciplinary boundaries, and indeed notions of mathematics itself, to well-chosen historical case studies belonging to the mathematics of the past, in both European and non-European cultures.\n\n1.2 Defining anachronism The sense of anachronism, or “obsolescence,” is a characteristic feature of modern historical thinking. . . . An awareness that the past differs in fundamental respects from the present (Ritter, 1986, p. 9).\n\nThe notion of anachronism is an elusive one. The term has been used to refer to several mistakes in historical interpretation, and indeed the history of this term is an interesting topic for the intellectual historian. Thus, I have used a plural in the title of this book, and in the following chapters we shall encounter several forms of anachronism. Anachronismos was defined by chronologists such as Joseph Justus Scaliger (1540–1609). It meant misplacing an event against a correct temporal ordering. In this sense it was used by the Jesuits Denys Petau and Sforza Pallavicino, and by bishops Jacques Bossuet and Pierre-Daniel Huet (Grafton, 1991, pp. 104–44; Burke, 2006, p. 291). Such temporal mistakes are not what we are interested in. One of the first statements concerning the historical interpretation of past texts that may be seen as relevant for the theme of this book was made by Jean Le Clerc (1657–1736) in his work on textual erudition entitled Ars Critica (1697): 4\n\nA philosophically innovative study is Syrjämäki (2011).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n4\n\nGuicciardini: Introduction\n\nSo we must beware of lending our notions to the Ancients and then judging their discourse on the basis of these notions, as often happens. If we wish their thought to be understood, our opinions should be as if forgotten. [. . . ] We should not compare their sayings with the nature of the things about which they speak, so as to be able to say that their knowledge of them is greater or less than ours, but should as far as possible interpret them from their very words. 5\n\nLe Clerc puts it beautifully and his words, made possible by the Renaissance discovery of the alterity of the past (Burke, 1969), can still be taken as an acceptable first definition of what we mean by anachronism in textual interpretation. 6 Note that Le Clerc is not worried about using modern notions to describe past deeds and works. Rather, in his view, the mistake in historical interpretation consists in “lending” our notions to past authors and “judging their discourse on the basis of these notions.” One might claim that using present knowledge and concepts in order to study the past is not only inevitable, but also profitable for historical interpretation. For example, when we study the decline of the Etruscan civilization (to use its Latin name), we might use categories and data drawn from disciplines such as demography or economy that would have been totally inconceivable for the Rasenna (to use the local name), who tended to believe, after a study of the livers of sheeps, that their misfortunes were due to the wrath of the Gods (Pallottino et al., 1986). A historian of Neolithic culture who would set himself the task of giving a talk using only the actors’ categories and language, as one might try to reconstruct them, would surprise his audience! Furthermore, analogies between past events and present-day situations are routinely deployed by historians in order to describe the past. It is not only our present-day knowledge that helps us assess past events: what often informs historical narratives is the assumption of there being certain similarity between past and present. When it comes to the interpretation of texts, rather than events, though, things become more complicated. Can we “use” our present-day concepts for descriptive purposes without “lending” them to the texts handed 5\n\n6\n\n“Igitur cavere debemus ne notiones nostras mutuas Veteribus demus, deinde ex notionibus illis de eorum sermone judicemus, ut passim fieri solet. Si velimus eorum mentem adsequi, oportet veluti nostrarum opinionum oblivisci. [. . . ] Non debemus eorum dicta cum ipsa rerum, de quibus loquuntur, natura conferre, quatenus nobis nota est, nam ut diximus eorum cognitio amplior, aut tenuior esse potuit, quam nostra; sed eos ex ipsis eorum verbis, quantum licet, interpretari” (Le Clerc, 1697, pp. 534–5). Le Clerc asked himself how ancient pagan works should be translated and evaluated by modern Christian readers. See Collis (2016).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.3 On mathematical anachronism: the problem\n\n5\n\ndown by past authors? One might claim that we are allowed – or even compelled – to use our own concepts, provided that we do so with an awareness of the present-day elements shaping our historical reading and choice of the texts we order at the desk of the Rare Books Room. It would be too simplistic, however, to assume, with Le Clerc, that we can easily sanitize our historical discourse from our present “notions” by a forced act of forgetfulness. This point can be illustrated by a metaphor used by Jonathan Clark, who writes: The sin of anachronism in historical method is a mortal one because it rearranges the ideas and values of the past in ways which make past actions inexplicable except as attempted anticipations of the present. The historian is always condemned to see the past through a glass, darkly; the introduction of anachronistic categories turns that glass into a mirror (Clark, 2000, p. 13).\n\nTo elaborate on the metaphor Clark employs in his provocative book on English society in the long eighteenth century, one might say that the difficulty we encounter in our daily work as historians consists in the fact that we look at past authors through the glass of our anachronism, thus rendering their texts anticipations of the present. Our glass can only be soiled by the impurities of our own preconceptions. We see the shadowy figures of our predecessors, we turn and tilt the glass, we try to eliminate the impurities distorting the image. The glass of our doctrines and prolepses will be always there: we are twenty-first-century actors ourselves, and we cannot but use the optical instruments provided by our own times and by the hermeneutic tradition we belong to. The important thing is to make sure that, by manipulating the glass of historical research too clumsily, we do not “turn that glass into a mirror,” and end up seeing our face reflected in it.\n\n1.3 On mathematical anachronism: the problem The reality and reliability of the human world rest primarily on the fact that we are surrounded by things more permanent than the activity by which they were produced (Arendt, 1998, pp. 95–6).\n\nIs there a special problem with the history of mathematics and anachronisms? 7 Perhaps one might put it like this: the special problem is that an anachronistic take on the past of mathematics is oftentimes deemed 7\n\nIn the following two pages, I draw upon Guicciardini (2018).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n6\n\nGuicciardini: Introduction\n\nquite successful for historical interpretation. The stability of mathematics (which might be deemed an empirical fact) or even, according to some philosophers, its universality (which is a controversial issue) invites its historians to adopt a cumulative and teleological narrative. Indeed, German mathematician Hermann Hankel (1839–1873) once wrote: In most sciences one generation tears down what another has built, and what one has established another undoes. In mathematics alone each generation builds a new storey on the old structure. 8\n\nYet, many practitioners of the history of mathematics – especially those active after the turn against such teleological narratives promoted by scholars such as Helène Metzger and Thomas Kuhn – think that the study of past mathematics should be devoted to placing it into a “context” (a notion variously understood and hard to pin down) revealing otherness rather than kinship. The problem is that the history of mathematics thus contextualizes a discipline encoded in texts that apparently travel across time and cultures without much loss of their original meaning and cogency. Indeed, according to some philosophers endorsing forms of Platonism, these texts transcend their historical situatedness: they are independent of the author, his language, the intentions he might have had, and the context to an extent unknown in other areas of human culture. 9 However, the stability of mathematics is a fact that does not necessarily imply Platonism: one might wish to say, rather, that some mathematical techniques have endured for long (not for “eternity”) and have been transmitted across different cultures. The history of mathematics has a character of its own: it is not the history of dead mentalities or forms of life. It is the history of ideas and methods that are still in good health, thriving, perhaps eternal. Indeed, the works of past mathematicians can still be inspiring for many practicing mathematicians: solving a problem formulated centuries ago can 8\n\n9\n\n“In den meisten Wissenschaften pflegt eine Generation das niederzureissen, was die andere gebaut, und was jene gesetzt, hebt diese auf. In der Mathematik allein setzt jede Generation ein neues Stockwerk auf den alten Unterbau” (Hankel, 1869, p. 34; translation in Dauben, 1984, p. 81). The contrast between the two approaches to the past of mathematics has been discussed at length by Ivor Grattan-Guinness in his classic papers (Grattan-Guinness, 2004a,b). It goes without saying that I owe a great deal to my former supervisor. I have not only profited from his papers, but I still remember the many discussions we entertained on the historiography of mathematics. A recent monograph is Wardhaugh (2010). Another book I have found very useful is Hodgkin (2005). A paper that refines Grattan-Guinness’s viewpoint is Fried (2018).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.3 On mathematical anachronism: the problem\n\n7\n\nlead to the Abel Prize. 10 As Godfrey Harold Hardy famously recalled: 11 “Littlewood said to me once, ‘[the Greeks] are not clever schoolboys, or scholarship candidates, but Fellows of another college’.” So Greek mathematics is “permanent, more permanent even than Greek literature.” Perhaps, historians of philosophy experience a similar familiarity with the works of Plato and Aristotle. 12 Mathematicians’ engagement with past mathematical texts is often remote from antiquarianism. Some mathematicians can find inspiration for their own research in past texts, as I have just noted. At the level of teaching, the mathematics of the past often enters our classrooms. And this also marks a difference compared to other scientific disciplines. We would not be happy if our children were taught Paracelsian alchemy or Galenic medicine at school. Instead, we might be interested, and maybe even enthusiastic, to know that their mathematics teacher is using Apollonius 13 or that their physics teacher is using a textbook, such as French’s Newtonian Mechanics (1971), which is replete with mathematical problems taken from Galileo’s Discorsi and Newton’s Principia. The historian’s view of the past is often at odds with those of Hankel, John Edensor Littlewood, or Anthony French. Some historians of mathematics, when attempting to interpret a mathematical text from the past, encounter distance and differences; they encounter the past as a “foreign country,” as all historians do, and as David Lowenthal has recounted in his fascinating study (Lowenthal, 2015). Rather than Hankel’s pronouncement, many historians of mathematics would subscribe to an equally famous passage from Morris Kline (1973, p. 69): It is safe to say that no proof given at least up to 1800 in any area of mathematics, 10\n\n11 12\n\n13\n\nAs was the case in 2016 with Andrew Wiles and his proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. It should be added, however, that lately the ability of practicing mathematicians to read older works is somewhat declining, partly because of lack of interest, but also because knowledge of the languages used in old works is getting rare. Hardy (1940, p. 12). Such familiarity is often invoked by historians of philosophy. Richard Rorty, to cite a classic, defends the opportunities disclosed by entertaining “conversations” with past philosophers: “we also want to imagine conversations between ourselves (whose contingent arrangements include general agreements that, e.g., there are no real essences, no God, etc.) and the mighty dead. We want this not simply because it is nice to feel one up on one’s betters, but because we would like to be able to see the history of our race as a long conversational interchange. We want to be able to see it that way in order to assure ourselves that there has been rational progress in the course of recorded history that we differ from our ancestors on grounds which our ancestors could be led to accept” (Rorty, 1985, p. 51; see also the more recent Antognazza, 2015). This is what Fabio Acerbi did with his high-school students at the Liceo Scientifico Magrini in Gemona (Italy), where I had the pleasure of lecturing in 2003. On the use of the history of mathematics in the teaching of mathematics, see Fried (2007).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n8\n\nGuicciardini: Introduction\n\nexcept possibly in the theory of numbers, would be regarded as satisfactory by the standards of 1900. The standards of 1900 are not acceptable today.\n\nSeveral historians and philosophers of mathematics have underlined the fact that the criteria of proof validity have changed in history, making the development of mathematics subject to discontinuities, or even revolutions. 14 For example, Leonhard Euler’s handling of infinite series or Augustin-Louis Cauchy’s use of limits might be rejected today as not sufficiently rigorous. Kline highlights the discontinuities encountered by the historian of mathematics, and his position is often contrasted to Hankel’s. The historian of mathematics Henk Bos, in his inaugural lecture as Extraordinary Professor in the History of Mathematics at the University of Utrecht, entitled “Recognition and Wonder,” argued that we both recognize the mathematics of the past as part of our canon and wonder at its diversity. It is worth quoting from Bos’s lecture: Recognition makes it possible to distinguish historical events and thus initiates the link of past to present. If recognition or affinity is absent, earlier events can hardly, if at all, be historically described. Wonder, on the other hand, is indispensable too. The unexpected, the essentially different nature of occurrences in the past excites the interest and raises the expectation that something can be discovered and learned. History studied without wonder reduces itself to a mere listing of recognizable past events, which differ from what is familiar only by having another date (Bos, 1989, p. 3).\n\nI find Bos’s lesson totally convincing: it captures most of what I have to say in this Introduction. Indeed, it seems that as historians of mathematics we have to strike a balance between recognition of familiarity with the past and wonder for its foreign remoteness from our present. The essence of our discipline consists in talking sense into the mathematician, trained in searching for equivalences, and in writing a narrative that meets the standards of the historian sensitive to the otherness of the past. Like all historians, when looking back to temporal developments, we have to identify permanence and similarities, and distinguish changes and idiosyncrasies as well. A picture of the permanence of mathematics through the ages, and 14\n\nThere has been an extensive debate on the applicability of Kuhn’s ideas to the development of mathematics. This debate, incepted by the exchange between Michael Crowe and Joe Dauben, has given rise to a very interesting literature of absolute relevance for the theme to which this volume is devoted. Two collections of essays that are essential reading are the classic (Gillies, 1992) and the more recent (Sialaros, 2018).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.3 On mathematical anachronism: the problem\n\n9\n\ntherefore of its accessibility from a modern standpoint, is vividly expressed in the naive incipit of a textbook on ancient mathematics written by a fine historian, Asger Aaboe. It reads: A modern schoolboy transposed to Babylonia or ancient Greece would find the physics of classical Antiquity utterly unfamiliar. Mathematics however would look familiar to our schoolboy: he could solve quadratic equations with his Babylonian fellows and perform geometrical constructions with the Greeks. This is not to say that he would see no differences, but they would be in form only, and not in content; the Babylonian number system was not the same as ours, but the Babylonian formula for solving quadratic equations is still in use (Aaboe, 1964, p. 1).\n\nAaboe, a historian inspired by the work of Otto Neugebauer, read the mathematics of ancient Mesopotamia and Greece through an interpretative lens aimed at recognizing similarities with modern high-school algebra. 15 What he claimed in these opening lines is that, by reading closely the cuneiform tablets from ancient Mesopotamia, one could talk with some justification of a 4000-year-old method equivalent to our algebra. One should emphasize that Neugebauer was keenly aware that the ancient Mesopotamian scribes did not have our algebra, and the above quote does not do any justice to Neugebauer’s nuanced methodology. One might perhaps say that Neugebauer used our algebra as a means to verify the results of Babylonian mathematics, and as a means to cautiously interpret its methods as well. By a close analysis of the texts, he showed that this exercise in translation is possible, and occurs quite naturally, once the code used by the authors of the cuneiform tablets is broken, a feat in decipherment prowess that is the knack of the accomplished mathematician (Høyrup, 1991; Swerdlow, 1993; Rowe, 2012, 2016). As already noted, we cannot perform the same exercise in translation, as successfully and seamlessly, with Galenic medicine or Aristotelian physics. And this truth, or truism, is perhaps what Aaboe had in mind. It is also interesting to note that Aaboe distinguishes a “content” from a “form” in past mathematics: it is the form that might change, not the content. Recent research has called Aaboe’s and Neugebauer’s continuist historiography into question by highlighting the distance between ancient 15\n\nNote that Donald Knuth, who is famous for his contributions to the mathematics of computer programming, read some ancient Babylonian texts not in terms of algebra, but rather in terms of the theory of algorithms. The unexpected advantages of Knuth’s anachronism are discussed in Karine Chemla’s chapter in this volume.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n10\n\nGuicciardini: Introduction\n\nBabylonian mathematics and the algebra of “our schoolboys” (Høyrup, 2002; Robson, 2008). Christine Proust, one of the great experts in the field, puts it beautifully: The mathematics of Mesopotamia is the most ancient which has been transmitted to us. These texts, written on clay tablets in cuneiform symbols, deal with mathematical objects familiar to us, such as numbers, units of measurement, areas, volumes, arithmetical operations, linear and quadratic problems, or algorithms. However, when we look more closely, these familiar objects, reveal strange features on the clay tablets. 16\n\nWhen we turn our attention to Aaboe’s other imaginary classroom, the one attended by the schoolboys of ancient Greece, we encounter the celebrated – or perhaps infamous, one should say – debate on what was termed “geometrical algebra.” The whole issue, in this case, concerned the similarity of demonstrations occurring in some propositions in Books II and VI of Euclid’s Elements and in Apollonius’s Conics with those of present-day algebra and analytic geometry. According to this viewpoint, the demonstrations of the ancient Greeks are undoubtedly geometrical, but they reveal knowledge of a form of proto-algebraic thinking, a “geometrical algebra,” so to speak. The proponents of this interpretation, Neugebauer being one of them, actually defended different theses, and it is quite improper to group them together without paying attention to subtle, yet decisive, distinctions between their views (Høyrup, 2017). One might say that several scholars, following Hieronymus G. Zeuthen’s pioneering works, agreed that a mathematically trained eye discerns methods in Euclid’s and Apollonius’s geometrical works that can be seamlessly rendered into the language of high-school algebra. 17 Thus, the story goes, while the ancient Greeks developed geometrical demonstrations concerning lines, surfaces, angles, and so forth, they possessed knowledge of rules applied to magnitudes that translate into our elementary algebra (most notably, the rule to solve second-degree algebraic equations) and into analytic geometry (especially, the definitions of 16\n\n17\n\n“Les mathématiques de Mésopotamie sont les plus anciennes qui soient parvenues jusqu’à nous. Ces textes, écrits en écriture cunéiforme sur des tablettes d’argile, traitent d’objets mathématiques qui nous sont familiers, tels que des nombres, des unités de mesure, des aires, des volumes, des opérations arithmétiques, des problèmes linéaires et quadratiques, ou encore des algorithmes. Cependant, à y regarder de plus près, ces objets familiers se présentent dans les tablettes d’argile sous des aspects étranges” (Proust, 2015, p. 17). For example, Zeuthen (1886); Heath (1908); Neugebauer (1936); Van der Waerden (1954). Zeuthen distinguishes two phases, “geometrische Arithmetik” und “geometrische Algebra” in Zeuthen (1896, pp. 40–53).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.3 On mathematical anachronism: the problem\n\n11\n\nconic sections in Cartesian coordinates). Neugebauer developed the bold idea that the analogies between the geometrical algebra of Euclid and Apollonius and the algebra inscribed in the cuneiform tablets was evidence of a transmission from Semitic to Greek cultures, an interpretation that, as is evident from the final pages of Neugebauer (1936), pleased an anti-Nazi German, but which he most often left implicit and somewhat hidden behind his non-ostentatious and austere style of writing. Several scholars, most notably philosopher Jacob Klein and philologist Árpád Szabó, considered the renderings of Euclid’s and Apollonius’s demonstrations in terms of geometrical algebra as obfuscating the original, essentially geometric, character of ancient Greek mathematics. 18 This criticism was expounded in the most systematic way in the middle of the 1970s by Sabetai Unguru. 19 The ensuing debate, unfortunately a heated one, took the form of a disciplinary clash between Unguru, a professional historian well trained in philology and philosophy as well, and a number of eminent mathematicians, such as Bartel Leendert Van der Waerden, Hans Freudenthal, and André Weil. 20 The crucial issue was to determine who had the competence to write about the history of Greek mathematics: the classical scholar who has full command of the ecdotic criteria needed to understand a text and contextualize its transmission, or the practicing mathematician who has the technical ability to produce a conjectural reconstruction of the text (Weil, 1980)? The answer to this dilemma, one might think, would be cooperation between the two, but, unfortunately, this did not occur at the time. 21 The debate on “geometrical algebra” clearly illustrates the problem of anachronism that historians of mathematics often encounter when translating the mathematics of the past into modern language. No doubt, these translations shed light on past mathematical practices, but the light 18 19\n\n20\n\n21\n\nSee, especially, Klein (1968) and Szabó (1978). The two important papers that instigated the controversy are Unguru (1975, 1979). See also Unguru and Rowe (1981, 1982). David Rowe, it should be noted, was a very young scholar when he had the exciting experience of co-authoring these wonderful papers. As a mature scholar he left Greek mathematics for modern and contemporary mathematics and developed a nuanced and original historiographical position. In this context, the important contributions by Michael Mahoney should be also considered. See Mahoney (1970). Van der Waerden (1975); Freudenthal (1977); Weil (1978). For the context of this debate, see Schneider (2016). A new interpretation based on the notion of “pre-modern algebra” is Sialaros and Christianidis (2016) in which the reader can find a complete, up to 2016, bibliography on “geometrical algebra.” Fried and Unguru (2001) is a detailed edition and commentary of Apollonius’s Conics. This is the most elaborate and sustained criticisms of the notion of “geometrical algebra.” For a revisionist viewpoint, see Blåsjö (2016). An innovative position is found in Netz (2002a,b).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n12\n\nGuicciardini: Introduction\n\n– so to speak – can be too strong and make subtle differences fade away. These nuances are often considered insignificant by mathematicians interested in finding equivalences rather than distinctions between past and present. 22 Contrariwise, historians sensitive to the cultural world in which the mathematicians of the past operated will find these distinctions of vital importance for their discourse. Many historians of mathematics nowadays present the development of mathematics by taking minute differences between texts into account: differences between texts that are mathematically equivalent but significantly distant for the historian. Moreover, as also shown by Fraser and Schroter’s chapter in this volume, there is increasing awareness of the distinction between what is explicitly defined and what is implicit in the mathematical practice of authors who might even be unaware of what can be extracted from their texts a posteriori. In the case at hand, one might think that a preliminary definition of “algebra” would clear the field of divergencies and polemics, so that one might say that algebra was “implicit” in the works of Euclid and Apollonius. Yet, a more promising approach consists in resisting the temptation to start from a definition imposed from the outside, and in working instead “from within,” by studying how algebra was gradually defined and extracted from Euclidean and Apollonian texts through a process that implied a slow and conceptually problematic transition from a geometrical to an algebraic paradigm. 23 The two opposing views taken in the debate we have been reviewing in this section can be illustrated by the following quotations. The first comes from Unguru’s pen: Different ways of thinking imply different ways of expression. It is, therefore, impossible for a system of mathematical thought (like Greek mathematics) to display such a discrepancy between its alleged underlying algebraic character and its purely geometric mode of expression (Unguru, 1975, p. 80).\n\nHere, Unguru goes so far as to claim that one cannot separate form from content. This position thus offers no room for compromise with those who might wish to draw out the “essential” mathematical substance in 22 23\n\nAn interesting comparison between the two viewpoints can be found in Fried (2014) and Blåsjö and Hogendijk (2018). It is interesting to note that two scholars who have masterfully dealt with the historical reconstruction of such paradigm transitions in mathematics are two Israelis deeply influenced by Unguru. See Corry (2013, 2015), and Fisch (2017).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.3 On mathematical anachronism: the problem\n\n13\n\na text and compare it with that in another. And here is Weil’s pointed rejoinder: To berate Heath and others for betraying Euclid when all they do is to use a certain amount of notation to clarify the contents of his writings does not merely indicate a lack of mathematical sense; it argues a deficiency in logic. As everyone knows, words, too, are symbols. The content of a theorem does not change greatly, whether it is expressed in words or in formulas; the choice, as we all know, is mostly a matter of taste and of style (Weil, 1978, p. 92).\n\nA statement that, when accepted with no qualification, might lead to a negation of the historian’s aim to capture how even minute variances between symbolic expressions may reveal important differences of conceptions, that is, differences that must be taken into account in order to provide a narrative of the chronological development of, or of the geographical distance between, mathematical texts. To Weil’s statement, Unguru would reply: In mathematics (like in anything else) form and content are not independent variables. On the contrary, they mutually condition one another and neither is immune to change. A certain form permits only a certain content, and a new content requires a new form. This is why the methodological approach which casts indiscriminately the algebraic shadow over the garden of Greek mathematics obscures precisely those features which make it Greek mathematics (Unguru, 1979, p. 563).\n\nA statement that, when accepted with no qualification, might lead to an incommensurability between languages that would make any attempt of translation an impossible task. Interestingly, both Unguru and his critics added qualifications to their most vehement statements, such as the ones quoted above, making thus their confrontation methodologically nuanced and deep. It is clear to me that they showed us that we have to strike a balance between familiarizing and foreignizing past texts, between recognition and wonder. The chapters of this volume try to achieve this end. The debates surrounding the notions of the “algebra” of Ancient Mesopotamia and the “geometrical algebra” of Euclid and Apollonius have been foundational for the discipline of history of mathematics. In a way, the discipline grew to maturity thanks to this confrontation. It would be unwise for the editor of this volume, given his ignorance on ancient mathematics, to expand further on these vexed issues. I am a historian of a less distant and exotic past: I study early-modern European mathematics. I will turn\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n14\n\nGuicciardini: Introduction\n\nto my field of competence, therefore, with the purpose of offering some general observations that might be useful to exemplify the problem with anachronism in the history of mathematics that I have set out in this section.\n\n1.4 Deceptive familiarity The authors are near and far. At one and the same time, they are paradoxically both near and far [. . . ]. All that is needed is to choose aptly among well-known texts. In this case, it is not hard to find passages that present themselves as curiously modern, so that they could be easily integrated into ongoing debates. And then again, it is easy to set them alongside texts by the same authors that awaken the feeling of an unbridgeable distance or a nearness that is merely apparent. 24\n\nIn order to make sense of past texts, we have to translate the language of their authors into our own language, and this “domesticating” translation achieves – to use Bos’s terminology – a “recognition” of the texts as familiar, as “easily integrated into ongoing debates.” But according to Rossi’s words cited in the epigraph, as historians we must also appreciate the otherness, the “unbridgeable distance” of past authors: we must achieve a sense of “wonder.” In order to attain this goal, it is more appropriate to adopt a “foreignizing” strategy in translation. 25 Rossi, a historian of magic and of conceptions of time and memory in the early-modern period, was looking for the “other present” of our predecessors. He aimed to recover, or re-enact – as he wrote re-enacting Robin Collingwood, if I may put it so – their voice and to interpret the texts by bearing the intentions of the historical actors in mind. 26 Referring frequently to Clifford Geertz, Rossi fashioned himself 24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n“Gli autori sono vicine e lontani. Contemporaneamente e paradossalmente vicini e lontani [. . . ] Basta scegliere bene entro testi ben conosciuti. Allora non è difficile trovare pagine che appaino singolarmente moderne, tali da essere facilmente integrabili nel dibattito contemporaneo. Ed è poi facile contrapporre ad esse testi dello stesso autore che danno il senso di una irrimediabile distanza o di una vicinanza che era solo apparente” (Rossi, 1999, p. 28). The classic text discussing the two translation strategies of domestication and foreignization is Venuti (1995). Domestication is the strategy of making text closely conform to the culture of the language being translated to, which may involve the loss of information from the source text. Foreignization is the strategy of retaining information from the source text, and involves deliberately breaking the conventions of the target language to preserve its meaning (Gile, 2009, pp. 251–2). Robin G. Collingwood (1939, pp. 111–2) claimed that in order to interpret a text historically, a historian must experience the thoughts of the author. He called this process “re-enactment”: the historian “must be able to think over again for himself the thought whose expression he is trying to interpret.”\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.4 Deceptive familiarity\n\n15\n\nas an anthropologist of the past capable of inhabiting bygone cultures in which metals could vegetate, planets could have moving souls, and natural philosophers “were encouraged to carve talismans and images, and surround themselves with precise colors or herbs connected to planetary influences in order to exploit the conjunction of the whole [the macrocosm], a living being of which man [the microcosm] is both part and lord” (Del Soldato, 2016). A consequence of Rossi’s viewpoint is the rehabilitation of past worldviews as foreign to our own but not reducible to errors, different but nonetheless reasonable, robust, explanatory, and even rational in their own terms. Unfortunately, as Rossi was well aware, neither time travel allowing the cultural anthropologist to inhabit the other present of past actors, nor an act of historical necromancy allowing him to resurrect the intentional illocutions of past authors seem like viable options. Most past events, texts, and constructs experienced and produced by our predecessors are irretrievable, not to speak of their intentional stance. The parallel between the historian and the anthropologist, fascinating as it might be, is misleading: as historians we are confronted not with the “thick” description detailed by Geertz. Rather, in the absence of sufficient information on the context and the actors, we have to cope with a “thin” description. 27 Early-modern European mathematics has been transmitted to us and has been seamlessly embedded into our canon: think of Descartes’s analytic geometry, Leibniz’s calculus, or Newton’s laws of motion. Thus, early-modern European mathematics in a way poses a challenge to historians precisely because it is so similar, so “near,” to present-day mathematics: it has seeped into our textbooks. We encounter it in the genealogies constructed in the narratives imagined again and again, throughout the centuries, by those scientists who have received and further developed the works of Descartes, Leibniz, and Newton. One might say that this similarity is deceptive: for example, we tend to read the algebraic equations of Descartes, or the differential equations of Johann Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler, as if back then they meant what they mean for us today. There is, however, a difference, a distance, also in these cases; a distance that we, as historians, should recognize, as Rossi urges us to do,\n\n27\n\nIn the preceding two paragraphs I have drawn on Guicciardini (2018).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n16\n\nGuicciardini: Introduction\n\nwhen we seek to capture the idiosyncrasies and contingencies of past mathematics. 28 As I show in Chapter 7, some early-modern mathematical techniques (the differential equations of Leibniz and his immediate followers) look very similar to the ones in use nowadays. Indeed, in order to make them fully compatible with the conventions adopted in our textbooks, we only need to change a few symbols. This cosmetic massaging, however, generates a remarkable shift in meaning that makes those very equations – when so reformulated – unacceptable for their early-modern authors. They would have considered our equations, as we write them, wrong and would have corrected them back, for reasons that they explicitly stated as being important. An apparently innocent change of symbols and notation can project the present into the past, it can turn Clark’s dirty “lens” into a mirror: we end up seeing our own face, not the shadowy image of our predecessors. It is this experience of meaningshifts (significant ones for early-modern authors) due to a slight change of notation that induces me to recommend caution when translating ancient geometry into present-day algebraic terms. If apparently trifling translations give rise to obfuscations of early-modern texts, one might reasonably suspect that even worse results ensue when we are overhasty in rendering cuneiform or ancient Greek texts in our algebraic terms. An interesting case of “domesticating translation,” in Venuti’s terms, of early-modern mathematics into present-day notation can be found in the rightly acclaimed commentary provided by Tom Whiteside in his eight-volume edition of Newton’s mathematical papers (Newton, 1967– 1981). Very much as in the case of another great anachronistic historian of last century, Neugebauer, nobody denies that Whiteside obtained fundamental results in the history of mathematics. His commentary is considered indispensable reading for any scholar of early-modern mathematics. Whiteside had no qualms in commenting on Newton’s mathematical manuscripts and works by deploying our contemporary calculus notation, a notation which is indebted, but not equivalent, to the one used by Leibniz. Whiteside has been a master for all those interested in studying Newton’s mathematical work, yet his commentaries sometimes fail to capture important features that require a consciously foreignized reading of the text. To take a telling example, Whiteside commented on some of Newton’s geometrical proportionalities as formulated in the 28\n\nOn continuity versus revolutions, see Dauben (1984).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.4 Deceptive familiarity\n\n17\n\nPrincipia in terms of differential equations. In some of these equations, proposed by Whiteside as renderings of Newton’s text, the differential of time dt occurs. Yet, as Michel Blay has shown in his seminal monograph, the algebrization of time can be viewed as a major advance in the birth of eighteenth-century analytic mechanics; an innovation mostly due to the brothers Jacob and Johann Bernoulli, to Jacob Hermann, and to Pierre Varignon (Blay, 1992). Certainly, in Blay’s narrative, it would be unjustified to use dt when analyzing Newton’s mathematics. From Blay’s standpoint, a translation of Newton’s mathematics such as the domesticating one proposed by Whiteside, enlightening as it certainly is, risks erasing from view a major achievement in the mathematization of motion and force due to Continental mathematicians. As in the case of ancient mathematics, what is at stake are two conceptions of history: one (Whiteside’s) aimed at discovering some kinship between past and present, the other (Blay’s) aimed at appreciating the distance of the past. Several historians of mathematics, especially those active at the end of the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century, adopted the first viewpoint and routinely produced translations of early-modern mathematics into present-day language. A Whitesidean domesticating anachronism has its own justifications, though, which at this juncture it is appropriate to enumerate. (i) The fact that translations from early-modern mathematical language to our own are possible is in itself interesting: it is of some consequence for the historian (as all facts should be!). (ii) By embedding past mathematics into present-day mathematics, these translations help the historian make use of modern knowledge in order to assess the possibilities and limitations encountered by past actors (and which were most often opaque to them: think of the case of the Etruscans we toyed with above). (iii) Modernizing translations might allow us to appreciate the reception of past mathematics: it is often the case that our modernizing translations are those of readers of past texts who, active – say – some generations after the author, read the text beyond the author’s conceptual horizon. (iv) Good historical practice is often based upon the drawing of analogies between past and present (Burke, 2006; Leutzsch, 2019). If we\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n18\n\nGuicciardini: Introduction assume that the past is completely alien to the present, it becomes totally opaque to our understanding.\n\n(v) We learn by noting differences, not only analogies, between past and present: a modernizing translation can be a useful springboard to analyze in what respects the languages of past actors differs from ours. (vi) As historians of mathematics, we address readers who are often mathematicians (or students of mathematics): if using present-day language may be tricky for our historical interpretations, it can, on the other hand, assist readers who are not professional historians.\n\nAnachronistic renderings of past mathematics are, therefore, not to be demonized as intrinsically sinful. To be sure, if our aim as historians is to study the “foreign country” of past mathematicians, we will be inclined to avoid modernizing renderings, or to use them with great caution, since our efforts will be aimed at stressing the disanalogies and the otherness of past mathematics. However, to expand on point (vi) above, since our audience is constituted by mathematicians whose profession consists in searching for equivalences, an excessive bias towards the search for disanalogies might isolate us from the practitioners of the discipline whose history we are writing about. And this, for obvious reasons, would be a bad policy. The reader will, I am sure, forgive me if in the next section I expand somewhat upon Bos’s influential methodology, as put into practice in his work on Descartes’s Géométrie. I wish to do this for two reasons. I need to put my hands on a concrete example – and what a wonderful example of scholarship this is! Further, Bos’s methodology offers a credible way out of the dilemma facing contextualist historians of earlymodern mathematics which we have considered in this section. As we have seen, early-modern mathematics is in some cases very similar to present-day mathematics, and successful historical interpretations have been provided by assuming this similarity is unproblematic. But how, then, can we contextualize and foreignize mathematical practices of the past that are apparently – I would say deceptively – so close to our present?\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.5 Tasks and criteria of quality control\n\n19\n\n1.5 Tasks and criteria of quality control The historical perception of mathematics is through the actions of mathematicians [. . . ] the actions of mathematicians are to be understood as performing self-imposed tasks according to self-created criteria of quality control (Bos, 2004, p. 65).\n\nRené Descartes’s Géométrie (1637) is one of the great classics in the history of mathematics. It is, for good reasons, viewed as a turning point in the history of geometry and algebra. With this small treatise – one might be tempted to say – modern mathematics was born, since in it Descartes gave birth to “analytic geometry.” Indeed, Descartes’s text sounds familiar to the modern reader. Points on plane curves are identified by pairs of variables z and y, the equations of conics, cubics, and higher-order algebraic curves are expressed in a notation that is very close to the one standard nowadays, and geometrical problems are translated into systems of equations, very much as we would do in our classrooms. Descartes’s text can be interpreted in a more contextual and less presentist way, as Bos has shown in a series of essays that were brought together in his monograph Redefining Geometrical Exactness (2001). Bos began his research by emphasizing the difficulties that he had encountered in understanding the structure, genre, and content of Descartes’s mathematical essay, which did not appear familiar to him, but rather unclear, alien and enigmatic. Bos writes (and one could not find a more perspicuous expression of the sense of “wonder” at the diversity of the foreign past of mathematics): the reader who opens the Géométrie expecting to read a book on analytic geometry is likely to have a confusing experience [. . . ] the equivalence of curve and equation, which is the core of analytic geometry, appears to be rather a side issue in the Géométrie. Had that equivalence been a central one, one would have expected Descartes to deal with the curves according to their degrees, starting with the straight line [. . . ] In fact, an equation of the straight line occurs only once in the text, more or less in passing, and Descartes discussed several curves without giving the equation at all. Furthermore, the book contains much algebraic theory about equations in one unknown, which at first sight seem unrelated to the theme of expressing curves by equations. [. . . ] These enigmatic aspects have to do with the structure of Descartes’ theory and with the resulting structure of his book (Bos, 1990, p. 351).\n\nThe plain fact is that – as Henk Bos has demonstrated – the Géométrie\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n20\n\nGuicciardini: Introduction\n\nis not a treatise on analytic geometry, as we would understand this discipline nowadays. Indeed, Descartes devoted many pages of the Géométrie to a description not so much of the equations that define curves, but rather of several instruments, consisting of linked sliding rulers and strings, tracing curves by continuous motion. What would be the role of these tracing mechanisms in a work on analytic geometry? According to Bos, the standard reading of the Géométrie as the foundational text of analytic geometry is a myth, based on a proleptic reading of Descartes’s mathematical essay. We read analytic geometry where its author had something else in mind. 29 As Bos has shown, in order to avoid projecting our discipline upon Descartes’s text, we have to recognize that the study of plane curves is not the only issue for its author. Or, better, curves are not only the focus of study in the Géométrie: they are also the tools employed for geometrical constructions. Indeed, geometrical constructions are the task Descartes sets himself to. Curves are the instruments to achieve such a task. Just as in the Elements problems are constructed by intersections of circles and straight lines traced by compass and straightedge, so in the Géométrie problems are constructed by intersections of plane curves, such as ellipses, hyperbolas, and higher-order algebraic curves, traced by instruments of Descartes’s conception. One should bear in mind that the point of departure of the Géométrie, namely the translation of geometric problems into algebraic equations, which makes Descartes’s essay recognizable as the founding text in analytic geometry, is not the end result of Descartes’s canon for problem solving. In Descartes’s mind, the algebraic calculation of the roots of a system of equations does not yield a solution to a geometric problem, as might be the case nowadays. In the Euclidean tradition, the solution of a geometric problem must end with a Q.E.F. (“quod erat faciendum,” what was to be done), a geometrical construction: this was Descartes’s “task.” In other words, Descartes’s agenda is dominated by the Greek tradition of geometrical problem-solving, which Pappus related to the methods of classical analysis. In the very first pages of the Géométrie, Descartes explained how geometrical problems could be reduced to algebraic equations. This was a resolution, or analysis, of the problem. But algebra does not 29\n\nSimilarly, in her chapter in this volume, Lorenat shows that early nineteenth-century geometers, when working on projective geometry, had in mind tasks different from those of mathematicians of later generations.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.5 Tasks and criteria of quality control\n\n21\n\nprovide a solution: a solution is attained via a geometrical construction. For Descartes, as in classic Greek geometry, in order to produce a geometric construction, points must be determined via intersection of curves traced by continuous motion. One, therefore, needs instruments that trace curves by continuous motion so that an intersection can be found. In the Géométrie, curves, which were later seen as the main objects studied in analytic geometry, are tools used to construct points. But how should one proceed? In the Géométrie Descartes developed a sophisticated theory aimed at constructing, by the intersection of curves, segments whose length, once a unit segment is arbitrarily chosen, is equal to the roots of polynomial equations. In his theory for the “construction of equations,” Descartes determined a series of “self-imposed criteria of adequacy or quality control.” First, he established that only a class of curves (what we call “algebraic” curves) were admissible as “exact.” Second, he also indicated how one can choose between two algebraic curves the one which is “simpler.” By addressing these issues concerning the adequacy and simplicity of construction tools, Descartes was answering desiderata about the solution of geometrical problems that were discussed at length in ancient Greek texts such as Pappus’s Mathematical Collection (1588). Descartes’s theory of the “construction of equations” constituted an established topic of mathematical research for more than a century, and it attracted the attention of many mathematicians. For example, RenéFrançois de Sluse, Philippe de La Hire, John Wallis, Guillaume François de L’Hôpital, Isaac Newton, Christian Wolff, Charles-René Reyneau, Colin Maclaurin, Gabriel Cramer, and Leonhard Euler all wrote about this theory. The theory of the construction of equations remained an important mathematical topic for over a century. However, it disappeared around the middle of the eighteenth century. As Bos (1984, pp. 372–3) observes: the construction of equations did not disappear because some problems in the field were unsolvable [. . . ] neither did the theory lose interest because all problems were already solved. Neither, again, can the loss of interest be attributed to a rival theory which produced better results. [. . . ] The causes that made the construction of equations disappear lay in the sphere of motivation and method, rather than in the sphere of the mathematical problems and techniques. The causes were connected with the reasons why mathematicians considered certain problems as meaningful, and with the criteria of adequacy which mathematicians set for the solution of these problems. Such reasons and\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n22\n\nGuicciardini: Introduction\n\ncriteria are very essential in the development of mathematics. They guide the research in a field, and as such they are necessary for its development.\n\nAt the middle of the eighteenth century, European mathematicians did not seek solutions as geometrical contractions, rather the equation p(x) = 0 itself was a solution. If a geometrical representation of the roots was needed, it was given by the intersection of the x-axis with the graph of y = p(x). Yet, constructing the roots via the intersection of the graph and the horizontal axis was not a viable option for the Cartesian theory, because in this case one would construct the roots by intersection of a higher-degree curve (a quartic, say) with a straight line, rather than by the intersection of two lower degree curves (two conics). Pappus’s precept, according to which problems should be constructed by the simplest means available, was important for Descartes and his contemporaries, who developed a sophisticated theory concerning the tools admissible in geometric construction. They discussed the properties of simplicity, elegance and exactness that curves should satisfy in order to be accepted as tools for constructing the roots of equations. What is important here from a historiographical point of view – which is why I wish to expand on the issue – is Bos’s attention for the motivations (the “task,” as he aptly says) and the criteria of adequacy mathematicians set themselves. It is this viewpoint that allows him to shed light not only on Descartes’s text, but also on the tasks Descartes wished to achieve (e.g., exactness, finitism, the visual intuition of mathematical constructions, simplicity). It is worth quoting Bos at length: Rather than – or perhaps in addition to – reconstructing the [mathematical] concepts, we might attempt to understand the tasks which led mathematicians to form their ideas and to write the texts we study. These tasks were self-imposed by the mathematicians in response to available knowledge, open questions and more diffuse challenges. They were therefore time-dependent – indeed it is difficult to imagine a Platonic eternal universe of mathematical tasks. Moreover, the tasks were governed by criteria of adequacy whose formulation was itself part of the general mathematical endeavour (Bos, 2004, p. 64).\n\nIndeed, “self-imposed tasks” (constructing the roots of equations) and “self-created criteria of adequacy” or “of quality control” (using algebraic curves of the lowest possible degree) do not belong to the eternal realm of Platonic truths, but to the contingent, culturally situated agenda shared by the network of mathematicians whom Descartes corresponded with and upon whom he exerted his influence. Thus, Bos focuses on the\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/9781108874564.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press\n\n1.5 Tasks and criteria of quality control\n\n23\n\npractices and linguistic conventions 30 adopted in a community of mathematicians intent on addressing issues that are no longer important for us, that do not belong to the canon practiced in contemporary analytic geometry. It is such insightful attention to the culturally situated tasks and criteria of this community that allows Bos to ascribe the Géométrie to a genre pract"
