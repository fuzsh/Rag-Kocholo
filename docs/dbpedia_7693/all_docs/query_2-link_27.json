The conference was organized by the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science of UPV/EHU with the collaboration of the Spanish Society for the History of Sciences and Techniques (SEHCyT). It took place in the School of Education, and was attended by more than two hundred people. The articles in this volume are revised versions of papers presented at the conference. Since the symposium constituted the genesis of this book, it is appropriate to acknowledge those groups and individuals whose help made it possible. Professor Dr. C.U. Moulines deserves special credit for his intellectual support and expert advice. The project of the symposium was supported by a number of different agencies and foundations. Primary financial help came from the Dirección General de Investigación Científica y Técnica which supported the seminal research project (PB-86-0222). Further generous subsidies were provided, among others, by the Basque Government, the Diputación Forai de Gipuzkoa and the UPV/EHU. No large conference can function without a group of key people. In this case, María Jesús Arribas, Amparo Diez and Xabier Eizagirre worked with us for more than a year on the planning. To them, we owe a special word of thanks. Further, the symposium owes a tremendous amount to the help of the excellent staff of the Department of Logic and Philosophy of Science of UPV/EHU. The symposium was structured around a number of topics, and some of that structure has survived the transition to book form. Thirty-five invited papers and seventy-five contributed papers were read.1 We acknowledge with gratitude the efforts and kind co-operation of all the participants. We wish to\n\n1\n\nContributed papers have already been published in A. Diez, J. Echeverría, A. Ibarra (Eds.), Structures in Mathematical Theories.

It was a difficult task to select the papers to be published together as the conference volume: we have aimed to maintain a thematic coherence, somewhat stricter than was provided by the very broad spectrum of the conference itself. Hence, sometimes, we were forced to exclude outstanding papers because they did not fit nicely into the frame. The preparation of the final manuscript that resulted from all these efforts was no less onerous a task than the organization of the symposium itself. Our principal debt here again is to Amparo Diez who was chiefly responsible for entering a vast and unhomogenous bunch of manuscripts into the computer. She kept the computer running, and her cheerful, thoughtful, and very careful assistance made the production of the book run much more smoothly than we had any right to hope for. Elena Aranda's assistance with editorial matters has also been invaluable, and we are very grateful to her as well. Since none of us is a native speaker of English, we essentially depended on the linguistic assistance of our translators and interpreters David Simon and Diana Lindsay. It has been a pleasure to work with them. Finally we are greatly indebted to our publisher de Gruyter who treated the project with great patience and provided us throughout with useful technical advice. Thanks!\n\nThe Editors\n\nIntroductory afterthoughts 1. Writing a preface for this volume resembles the activity of Minerva's owl that starts its flight at dusk: after the days of lively lectures and intensive discussions from which this volume arose have passed, the editors lay claim to the doubtful privilege of adding some final introductory afterthoughts in order to make out a (necessarily) grey and dim philosophical gestalt of what has taken place during the day. However, the temptation to try to get at least some idea of what is going on in the field of philosophy of mathematics in general, today, is almost irresistible: presently, philosophy of mathematics is replete with optimistic metaphors and programmatic announcements that promise a fresh start to the whole discipline. Something important, it seems, is going on in the field, and there are new developments that drastically change our perspective. Hence it might be justified to tentatively sketch a conceptual space where the contributions of this volume can be located in such a way that a pattern or gestali becomes visible. Of course, complex phenomena can be perceived under different gestalts and it might well be the case that the reader perceives other gestalts which allow him to assess in a better way how the pieces of this collection fit (or do not fit) together with some of the allegedly general trends of the \"New\" philosophy of mathematics. In any case, in these introductory remarks we do not want to comment individually on each contribution of this volume. Rather we point to one or two salient features of each of them in order to give the reader some general idea of the whole enterprise. 2. As is evidenced by a wealth of recent publications the philosophy of mathematics presently is undergoing a rather dramatic transformation and reorientation 1 . What has happened to justify such optimism? Have all the ι\n\nTo mention just a few: a recent volume of Synthese, edited by R. Hersh, is exclusively dedicated to \"New Directions in the Philosophy of Mathematics\" (not to be confused with Tymoczko's anthology of the same title from 1985). There we find contributions like Goodman's \"Modernizing the Philosophy of Mathematics\" or Maddy's \"Philosophy of Mathematics: Prospects for the 1990's\". Of the same vintage but somewhat older are Lakatos' \"Renaissance of Empiricism in Recent Philosophy of Mathematics\" (1967), and Hersh's \"Proposals for Reviving the Philosophy of Mathematics\" (1979).\n\nχ\n\nIntroductory afterthoughts\n\nproblems of the traditional philosophy of mathematics been solved, and what might be the new agenda? These are the questions we want to touch upon in the following few pages. Since its inception mathematics has been a constant source of thought and reflection for very different kinds of people: apart from mathematicians who intended to explicate their science to other scientists or to the layman, from the beginning we find philosophers who were interested in mathematics not for internal mathematical reasons, but for external, more far reaching and more ambitious reasons. For instance, Plato claimed the study of mathematics to be an essential preliminary to philosophy. For him mathematical knowledge was the paradigmatic model of real knowledge (episteme) contrasted with mere opinion (doxa) that all other cognitive enterprises (except philosophy and mathematics) could obtain. A revival of the Platonist programme took place in the 17th century when Descartes, Leibniz, and Spinoza took mathematics as the model of scientific knowledge - see Howson's contribution on the role of mathematics in philosophy. Later, historians, psychologists, sociologists embarked on often bold and far reaching conceptual explorations into the formidable and labyrinthine space of mathematics in order to underpin various theses on the development, function, and structure of human cognition in general. It cannot be said that all these enterprises have been successful, often they have been endeavoured with insufficient equipment and preparation resulting in rather inadequate and distorting maps of the space of mathematics. Be that as it may, from antiquity to our days mathematics has served as a kind of guinea pig or touchstone for quite a variety of general philosophical accounts of what the world and our knowledge of it is like. 3. In the early and middle 20th century this model character of mathematics has been perceived of by professional philosophers and historians of science in a way that has emphasized the idiosyncratic character of mathematical cognition thereby isolating it from the related disciplines such as philosophy and history of the other sciences. Many philosophers and historians have even doubted that mathematics has a genuine history comparable to, say, the history of literature. They simply considered it as \"an intellectual field in which historical development is swallowed up by the latest state of the art, at the same time preserving what remains worthwhile\" (Otte). Although such a view of disciplinary history in the case of science has long been discredited it has had its adherents in the case of history of mathematics till very recently. For example, the historian of mathematics M. Crowe formulated ten \"laws\" concerning the history of mathematics; one of them (No. 10) stated that\n\nIntroductory afterthoughts\n\nXI\n\nrevolutions never occur in mathematics. Dauben in his contribution explicitly argues against Crowe's antirevolutionary law2. As is shown in the contributions of Knobloch (Foundations of error theory), Jahnke (Structure of mathematical theories according to the Combinatorial school of 19th century) even such seemingly \"platonic\" topics such as foundations and structure of mathematical theories are deeply impregnated by conceptual, pragmatic and historical considerations. As is shown by Feferman for recursion theory, and by Mahoney for Computer Science, this is true as well for modern theories. Once again the contributions of this volume provide ample evidence for Lakatos' Kantian slogan \"philosophy of mathematics without history is empty, history of mathematics without philosophy is blind\", the historical contributions implicitely or explicitely deal with philosophical issues, and the philosophical contributions rely on historical evidence to support the theses they present. This concern with historical and sociological aspects of mathematical cognition clearly separates the \"New\" philosophy of mathematics from the traditional NeoFregean approach that has dominated the discipline in the first half of this century. 4. The main concern of the Neo-Fregean approach has been the problem of secure and immutable foundations of mathematics. This has separated mathematics from other cognitive enterprises, and especially those linked to empirical knowledge which obviously were not built on bedrock, as we all know in the age of fallibilism. Even if philosophers of mathematics (as philosophers in general) in no way agreed upon how such a foundation could be achieved, the competing schools of Logicism, Formalism, and Intuitionism all adhered to the foundational task. This has lead to distorting effects for the whole discipline. Often, philosophy of mathematics has been content with and elementarist account of mathematics restricted to some known examples of elementary theories, say, arithmetic of natural numbers or basic Euclidean geometry. Then the question why 2 + 2 = 4 may seriously trouble the traditional philosopher of mathematics. Somehow, this looks funny. Of course, philosophers are otherwordly people and see problems where ordinary people do not, and indeed there may be deeply hidden philosophical problems in the elementary arithmetic truth 2 + 2 = 4 that escape the mathematician, the scientist, as well as the layman. However, philosophy of mathemaics cannot restrict itself to these kinds of questions. Today, there is virtual unanimity that 2\n\nIt might be interesting to note that also Crowe, with some reservations, no longer denies occurrence of revolutions in mathematics (cf. Aspray/Kitcher 1988, 260ff).\n\nχπ\n\nIntroductory afterthoughts\n\nall the above mentioned traditional approaches have turned out to be dead ends. Their highlights and their shortcomings are well known and well documented3. In this volume the reader will find virtually nothing about these sorts of things. All contributions of this book belong, for better or for worse, to what is still called in Aspray/Kitcher (1988) the \"maverick tradition\" and nowadays seems to form the new mainstream of philosophy of mathematics. We do not want to repeat yet again any of the well-known details of the traditional philosophy of mathematics. Instead of this we would like to sketch in a few sentences the general frame that has determined the various currents of the Fregean approach. The preoccupation with the problem of foundations on the one hand and the presupposition of unquestioned empiricist premises on the other hand have led the traditional approaches of philosophy of mathematics into a trap well known as \"Benacerraf s dilemma\": If mathematics is the study of projective, ideal entities without position in space or time how can mankind, being confined so obviously to a tiny portion of space and time, manage to have any mathematical knowledge?\n\nFor the non-philosopher, mathematician or layman, Benacerrafs dilemma probably looks like a philosophical artifact which has an air of exaggeration and absurdity: Without doubt we have a lot of mathematical knowledge, and looking more closely at how this knowledge is manufactured one realizes it is not as special as some philosophers (and philosophically inclined mathematicians) might have us believe. Assertions claiming the \"ideal\" and the \"absolute\" character of mathematical knowledge should not be taken too seriously. After all, mathematical knowledge is human knowledge. Thus, the general strategy to overcome Benacerrafs dilemma is rather clear: one has to show ( 1 ) T h e phenomena mathematical knowledge deals with are not so ideal, i.e. they are not so remote and inaccessible, as it at first sight might appear; (2) One has to dismiss a too simplistic (empiricist) theory of knowledge that restricts the realm of knowable phenomena to those we can have a causal relation with 4 .\n\nToday, a growing number of philosophers of mathematics consider this to be a promising strategy to escape Benacerrafs trap. This has the sobering effect of knocking mathematical knowledge off the pedestal on which Plato put it and\n\n3 4\n\nFor a short but authoritative history of Neo-Fregean philosophy of mathematics see the \"opinionated Introduction\" of Aspray/Kitcher (1988). A collection of recent attempts to resolve Benacerraf s dilemma in these ways is to be found in Irvine (1990).\n\nxm\n\nIntroductory afterthoughts\n\nrecognizing the common ground of mathematics and other human cognitive enterprises, i.e. there is a growing number of people who consider the similarities and analogies which mathematics and the empirical sciences share, rather than the previously overestimated difference. 5. Hence, very recently Maddy (1991) announced the \"post-Benacerrafian-age\" of philosophy of mathematics. According to her, Benacerrafs dilemma no longer has the determining character it had had for such a long time, and the post-Benacerrafian philosopher of mathematics has to look for a new agenda. What should it be? According to Maddy we are left with two main unsettled questions: (1) Which of the various ontological Benacerrafs dilemma is best?\n\ntinkerings proposed to dissolve\n\n(2) How can the axioms of set theory be justified?\n\nAccording to Maddy, the first question is a parochial squabble between philosophers. The other question, however, \"is a philosophical inquiry that could provide guidance for actual mathematics where guidance is sorely needed\" (Maddy 1991:158). We think that in some sense Maddy's first assessment is correct. Just as in the case of the empirical science the ontological details are not as important as philosophers traditionally used to make us believe: modern sciences do not take ontological questions too seriously - after all, do we know what an electron \"really\" is, and does this question make sense at all? In any case, it is not a central question of contemporary philosophy of science. Notwithstanding the basic underlying assumption of classical philosophy of mathematics, mathematics too might exhibit this kind of ontological indifference or indeterminacy. Several contributions to this volume deal with this phenomenon: Mac Lane emphasizes the protean character of mathematics, i.e. the fact that one and the same mathematical structure has many different realizations, and it does not make sense to ask \"which is the essential one?\". In a similar vein Grattan-Guinness and Resnik stress the fact that mathematics comprises a great diversity of forms, reasonings, structures, and applications. Hence there is no all embracing single answer to the questions such as \"What is it that a mathematical theory talks about?\" and \"How is a mathematical theory applied to a domain of empirical phenomena?\". Thus a kind of branching of philosophy of mathematics in two disciplines seems to take place (it might even be that it has already occurred): following Grattan-Guinness the first may be dubbed philosophers' philosophy of mathematics, dealing exclusively with logics, set theory, and perhaps elementary arithmetics of natural numbers, whereas the other one may be called\n\nXIV\n\nIntroductory afterthoughts\n\nmathematicians' philosophy of mathematics where real mathematics is taken into account to a greater extent. We are sure that such a more \"extroverted\" philosophy of mathematics is urgently needed, and philosophy of mathematics should follow Mac Lane's admonition \"that the philosophy of mathematics should be based on observation of what is actually present in the subject and not, as so often, on a few speculative notions about the most elementary parts of mathematics\". Taking this seriously implies that mathematics is to be seen not as a single theory but as an extended network of theories related to each other through intertheoretical relations of various kinds. The task to provide a typology of the elements and the relations which form this network, and the further question how it develops, are surely important subjects for philosophy of science and mathematics. The contributions of Moulines on intertheoretical relations, and of Sneed on machine implemented discovery of scientific theories, deal with these topics. Thus, mathematics provides a huge space of concepts and phenomena that cannot be surveyed from the perspective of an armchair philosopher having just some elementary fragments of school mathematics within easy reach. This amounts to a certain naturalism in philosophy of mathematics: The idea that philosophy could provide a justification or foundation for mathematical method has to be abandoned. To a large extent, the foundations of mathematics are provided by mathematics, and the role of philosophy as a founding discipline for mathematics seems to be limited. This, of course, is a controversial thesis that needs further elaboration. In particular, it depends on how the twins of \"introverted\" philosophy of mathematics concerned with traditional topics of philosophy of mathematics such as foundations, existence of mathematical objects, etc. and \"extroverted\" philosophy of mathematics concerned more directly with the reality of the discipline can be related. In any case it does not seem desirable that both should live totally separated from each other. The desideratum of a truly general philosophy of mathematics (Grattan-Guinness) is still to be met. What about Maddy's second proposal, modern philosophy of mathematics should primarily deal with the question of how the set theoretical axioms could be justified? In our opinion this assertion needs modification 5 . The\n\n5\n\nHer reason for concentrating on the question of set theoretical axioms is telling: \"For foundational purpose, the only axioms of current mathematics appear in set theory. The characteristic objects of other branches of mathematics are officially defined within set theory\" (Maddy 1991:158). We don't agree with any of these assumptions: as is argued in many of the essays in this volume neither the philosophy of mathematics should be restricted to\n\nIntroductory afterthoughts\n\nXV\n\nconcentration on set theoretical axioms offers a far too narrow perspective on what mathematical knowledge is and how it develops. We believe the contributions of the present volume give a lot of useful clues on how a more comprehensive agenda for a \"New\" philosophy of mathematics might look. One topic surely will be the multiple and variegated relations of mathematics with empirical science. In this task a natural ally for the philosopher of mathematics is, or at least should be, his colleague from the department of philosophy of science. 6. What has modern philosophy of science to tell us about mathematics? Philosophy of science has been philosophy of the empirical sciences. Hence, any answer to this question is driving at the similarities or analogies between mathematical and empirical knowledge. Quite different approaches may be distinguished. One might focus on empirical traces inside mathematics. The by now classic example of this approach is Lakatos' \"quasi-empiricist\" philosophy of mathematics. Perhaps the most \"Lakatosian\" approach in this sense is provided by Echeverría who tries to show the quasi-empirical character of number theory. Niiniluoto critically evaluates some of the main ideas of the \"quasi-empiricist\" approach relating it with a Popperian ontology. Breger points out that even for mathematics tacit knowledge, i.e. not directly formalizable knowledge about mathematics plays an essential role in the historical development of the discipline. Another possibility to tap our understanding of the empirical sciences for a modem philosophy of science for the philosophy of mathematics is to study similarities, analogies, and relations of mathematics and empirical science. In different ways this is performed in the contributions of Ibarra/Mormann (Structural analogies between mathematical and empirical science), Rantala (Reduction in mathematics and empirical science), Resnik (Indispensability of mathematics for science) and Torretti (Mathematical versus physical necessity), and Schmidt (Empirical meaning of set theoretical axioms), Scheibe (Non-conservative embedding of physical theories in mathematics), Da Costa/Doria (Metamathematical phenomena within mathematical physics) and Mosterín (Mathematical description as an encoding process) concentrate on different dimensions of the problem of applying mathematics in science. However, the relation of modem philosophy of science and philosophy of mathematics is not a one-way street. It also makes sense to ask \"What has modern mathematics to tell philosophy about science?\" It might well be the\n\nthe task of foundations, nor can set theory be considered as the overarching frame of all mathematics.\n\nXVI\n\nIntroductory afterthoughts\n\ncase that the long lasting preoccupation of philosophy of science with empirical sciences might have blinded it to some important aspects not only of mathematics but also of the empirical sciences themselves. In our opinion, an important example might be provided by the fact that the development of science should be understood not as a (cumulative) piling up of more and more theorems but rather as a conceptual development. Quite a few contributions in this volume, from the philosophical as well from the historical strand endorse this point of view: Mac Lane and Lawvere point out that understanding a piece of mathematics for the individual as well as for the scientific community of mathematicians as a whole is a long, and probably never ending process. Lawvere deals with the dialectical development of the categories of Space and of Quantity, and in detailed historical studies Feferman and Mahoney study the conceptual development of recursion theory and the mathematics of computing. Thus, an important contribution philosophy of mathematics could offer to philosophy of science might be the insight into the importance of the conceptual dimension of scientific knowledge. The communication between historians, philosophers, and mathematicians on a multifaceted and complex topic such as mathematics cannot always be easy. We hope, however, that the present collection of essays shows that it can be carried out in a fruitful way leading to new promising explorations in the fascinating space of mathematics.\n\nThe Editors\n\nReferences Aspray, W., Kitcher, Ph.: 1988, \"An opinionated Introduction\", in W.

Introduction The thesis of this paper is that mathematics is protean. This means that one and the same mathematical structure has many different empirical realizations. Thus, mathematics provides common overarching forms, each of which can and does serve to describe different aspects of the external world. This places mathematics in relation to the other parts of science: mathematics is that part of science which applies in more than one empirical context. This paper will first present some of the evidence for this thesis. Much of this evidence is essentially common knowledge, as we will illustrate. Additional such evidence has been presented in my book Mathematics: Form and Function,1 Springer Verlag, 1985. There and here, we follow the important, but often neglected principle that the philosophy of mathematics should be based on observation of what is actually present in the subject and not, as so often, on a few speculative notions about the most elementary parts of mathematics. Finally, we will draw a number of consequences from our thesis. 2. Arithmetic is Protean At the very beginning of our subject, observe that the natural numbers have more than one meaning. Such a number can be an ordinal: first, second, or third.... Or it can be a cardinal: one thing, two things,.... The natural number two is thus neither an ordinal nor a cardinal; it is the number two, with these two different meanings to start with. It is the form of \"two\", which fits different uses, according to our intent. As a result, the formal introduction of these natural numbers can be made in different ways - in terms of the Peano postulates (which describe not unique numbers, but the properties which such num-\n\n1\n\nBerlin-New York, Springer Verlag, 1985.\n\n4\n\nSaunders Mac Lane\n\nbers must have) or in terms of cardinals - two is the set of all sets of unordered pairs - or in terms of ordinals, where two is the set of all ordered pairs, and so on. This and other definitions have alternative forms, as with the von Neumann description of the ordinals, in which 3, for example, is the set (0, 1,2} of all smaller ordinals. Hence, at the very beginning of mathematics, natural numbers are not objects, but forms, variously described with a view to their various practical meanings. Put differently, an axiomatic description of number, as with Peano, does not define THE NUMBERS, but only numbers up to isomorphism. This recognition of the prevalence of mathematical descriptions \"up to isomorphism\" has recently been reemphasized in category theory, where products, adjoints and all that are inevitably defined only \"up to an isomorphism\". Numbers are little without the corresponding arithmetic operations, addition, multiplication... But addition has different explanations; for cardinals, addition is the disjoint union of the corresponding sets; for ordinals addition is given in terms of suitable successors, as in the familiar definition of addition by recursion: m + 0 = m, m + (η + 1) = (m + η) + 1. Multiplication has even more different introductions, as repeated addition, or by a recursion, as in m · 0 = 0,\n\nm(n + 1) = mn + m,\n\nor by sets of ordered pairs, or whatever. In line with different definitions of addition, there are even more different uses: multiplication to calculate area (width times height) or to calculate cost (price times number) or the number of inches (12 times number of feet). Multiplication is important not because it has a fixed meaning but because there are many different applications of the one idea of a \"product\". Laws of arithmetic are similarly of varied meaning. One word, \"associativity\" covers both a property of addition m + (η + k) = (m + η) + k and a property of multiplication χ (y z) = (x y) z. The same formal property of a binary operation, under the same name, comes up elsewhere in algebra - for the tensor product of vector spaces, for the intersection numbers in algebraic geometry, and for the product of cocycles in algebraic topology. The associative law appears as an axiom in the definition of a\n\nThe Protean Character of Mathematics\n\n5\n\ngroup, or of a semigroup, or of a Hopf algebra. For all these and other varied uses there is really just the one form, \"associative\", present whatever the name of the operation involved - addition, multiplication, whatever. The content varies greatly, but not the form. 3. Geometry is Protean Just as for arithmetic, geometry is protean - the same figure in many different guises, the same idea described in many different ways. Thus similarity: Two triangles arc similar when corresponding angles are equal, or when the ratios of corresponding sides are the same, or when one triangle can be obtained from the other by translation, followed perhaps by rotation or reflection. These definitions are demonstrably equivalent ways of formulating one meaning. But the meaning is after all not restricted to triangles: The definition in terms of motions of translation, etc. applies to the similarity of more complex figures in the plane or in space. \"Similarity\" is a protean idea. The subject matter of geometry enjoys a like ambiguity. The formal study of geometry begins usually with plane geometry. But which plane? That assumed by Euclid? Perhaps not, for his axioms were after all not quite complete. They were firmed up in the famous axiomatics by Hilbert, which filled the gap left by the absence of the Pasch axiom, but is Hilbert's plane the real one, or do we really think of the plane in terms of coordinates, where the cartesian plane has points determined by ordered pairs (x, y) of numbers χ and y? That does indeed give a plane, but those numbers do depend upon a choice of origin and of axes through that origin - and that choice has little to do with the Plane \"an sich\". And after all if the given is the three dimensional world, the plane is an abstraction - which plane in that three dimensional continuum do you mean? A question without a good answer; no matter, because the plane is a form which has many different realizations. For mathematics, one contemplates a \"plane\", because it can be studied profitably by itself, and then used in its many and various incarnations. 4. Analysis To advance to higher reaches: Calculus is protean. Take for example the derivative dy/dx of a function y. If y and χ are coordinates, the derivative means the slope of the corresponding curve. If y is distance and χ is time, the derivative is velocity, but if y itself is velocity, the derivative is acceleration. If y is total cost and χ the number purchased, the derivative is a marginal cost, and this same idea of the marginal occurs elsewhere in economics. Perhaps one\n\n6\n\nSaunders Mac Lane\n\nmight say generally that dy/dx is a rate of change, but this seems to imply that χ is something like a time, and this is not always so. Formally, one may define the derivative as the limit of the ratio of increments in χ and y, but this requires epsilons and deltas and may lose sight of some of the preceding meanings. Thus the derivative is really a general form, with many different interpretations. Calculus, in its second parallel aspect, deals with integrals. The area under a curve is an integral. So is a volume. So is a moment of inertia, or the pressure of water on a dam, or any one of the many other examples with which beginning students of the calculus are tormented. Or again, integration is the reverse of differentiation. Which is the real integral? In some sense, all are; in a better sense, the integral is a general notion with many different representations in mathematics and in the world. For differential equations, much the same is true. One learns how to solve this or that ordinary differential equation - because it often appears in different applications. And the same partial differential equation can apply to the motion of water, or of air, or of heat, or of light.... Thus throughout calculus (and the higher analysis as well) one and the same idea turns out to fit many different sets of facts - a fortunate conclusion for the efficient progress of science. Put differently, Isaac Newton may have been stimulated by a falling apple - but his work was not limited to falling apples or to other falling objects, or to planets or to tides or to economic changes. The mathematics matters because it is present in many different physical forms. 5. The Unexpected Many connections of mathematical ideas are unexpected; a mathematical form, studied for one purpose later crops up in a different context. Thus tensor analysis, with its initial welter of subscripts, was first built to handle higher curvatures and transportation of structures in differential geometry. Then, suddenly, it was used by Einstein to formulate general relativity in terms of his tensor equations. Then later, it turned out that those confusing multiple subscripts on the tensors were not necessary, since a tensor could be described conceptually as an element in a suitable \"tensor product\" space. That view arose because those same tensor products were needed for cohomology in algebraic topology. More recently, they crop up as typical adjunctions in the comparison of different categories and topoi. The idea of \"tensor\", once formulated, spreads far and wide. A group is an algebraic object - a set of elements any two of which can be\n\nThe Protean Character of Mathematics\n\n7\n\nmultiplied so that the product xy of elements is associative - and has a unit and an inverse. That is a formal definition, but the form was extracted from cases of symmetry-symmetry in the solution of algebraic equations and in the description of the varieties of crystal structure or of ornamental symmetry. Once groups were abstracted, mathematicians turned to the description of concrete representations of groups, say by groups of transformations (or matrices). With the initial work of Frobenius and I. Schur, this was a piece of presumptively pure mathematics. But then, with Hermann Weyl and others, group representations cropped up in quantum mechanics, at first to be labelled as a \"Gruppenpest\" and then gradually to be accepted as the right way - sometimes as the \"eight fold way\". A group is an abstract object, as are its representations - but they appear in many different real contexts. There are many other, more limited examples. Thus early in this century, the Austrian mathematician Radon studied the way in which the values of a three dimensional integral could be reconstituted by suitable two-dimensional integrals of the underlying quantities. This must have seemed a pure mathematical exercise. Now with the development of a medical tool, the Cat-scan, it has all manner of uses to reconstruct, say, a three dimensional image of a patient's brain from two-dimensional x-ray pictures. Radon did not set out to study the brain, but that study used - and developed further - the forms of analysis which he had developed. In the nineteenth century, Riemann studied the singularities of functions of a complex variable, and found a partial formula for the number of such functions with a given array of singularities. Improved, this is now given by the Riemann-Roch formula. For the behavior of algebraic curves that formula has geometric meaning, but it underwent a vast geometric generalization at the hands of Hirzebruch and Grothendieck, giving rise to a special branch of topology known as K-theory. Still more recently it appears as part of the AtiyahSinger index theorem for differential operators - and recently, ideas from mathematical physics have produced better proofs for this index theorem. Theoretical physics yields many more examples of the unexpected. I now cite one in which I happen to have been involved. In 1963, Stasheff and I studied a case of associativity - where the associative law is not an identity, but just an isomorphism as in the operation, left to right: α:\n\nχ ( y ζ) >-< (χ y ) ζ.\n\nThis operation moves parentheses back to front. If it is the correct operation, it must satisfy a condition for four factors, by moving parentheses back to front in two ways, as in χ (y ( ζ t)) >—< (( χ y ) ζ ) t.\n\n8\n\nSaunders Mac Lane\n\nFor this, it turned out that a must satisfy a certain pentagonal condition, using the two different ways of moving parentheses back to front in this formula. Then if also the commutative law entered, there was a hexagonal condition involved. Suddenly, in 1988, a pentagon and a hexagon turned up in some physics studies of \"conformai field theory\". It was the same pentagon and hexagon. In this way what had seemed an abstract algebraic example of associativity and commutativity had a different contact with reality. Unexpected, but not unreasonable, since the group representations mentioned above are really involved here, as well as some traditional questions about knots and braids. Theoretical computer science provides many more examples of the unexpected appearance of mathematical concepts in new context. The most striking case is that of the lambda calculus. This had been first formulated about 1930 by Alonzo Church as a possible new foundation of mathematics. Its basis was the lambda operation, which turns an expression f(x) into the function f, or more extensively, a expression f(x,y) with two variables into the corresponding f(-,y): that function of χ yielding a function of the remaining variable y. This is just the process familiar in the calculus, whereby a partial derivative is reduced to an ordinary one. As a foundation of mathematics, this lambda calculus did not succeed, but the formalism itself lived and presently was the inspiration for the programming language \"LISP\". This was just the first step in the current massive usage of seemingly technical ideas from mathematical logic in computer science, as in the way proof theory is used to describe data types, and in the extensive other uses of type theory from logic. This came at a time when type theory, in its classical Russellian form, had almost become wholly obsolete. And the rapid changes of fashion in computer science concern not only logic, but questions about algorithms, levels of computability, combinatorics, and the use of categories to formulate properties of polymorphic data types. The Consequences of the Protean Character of Mathematics 6. The Formal As long ago observed, mathematics is intrinsically formal. This is a consequence of its protean character: because mathematics is not about this or that actual thing, but about a pattern of form suggested by various things or by previous patterns. Therefore mathematical study is not study of the thing, but of the pattern - and thus is intrinsically formal. Properties of things may suggest theorems or provide data, but the resulting mathematics stands there independent of these earlier suggestions. The actual mathematics proceeds by following rules of calculation or of algebraic manipulations or by use of\n\nThe Protean Character of Mathematics\n\n9\n\ncollections of already established formulas or by calculations on a computer or by logical deductions according to accepted rules of inference. This is the reason that, in the long run, mathematics is essentially axiomatic. It is true by reference to the axioms and not to the facts. 7. Foundations It follows that mathematics does not need a \"Foundation\". Any proposed foundation purports to say that mathematics is about this or that fundamental thing. But mathematics is not about things but about form. In particular, mathematics is not about sets. Zermelo and then Zermelo-Fraenkel (and Skolem) did formulate axioms for sets. They are at times convenient ways of coding pieces of mathematics, but they do not catch the reality. For example, at the very beginning, the set-theorist's description of the ordered pair as the set {x, {x, y]} is clearly an artificial arrangement. Von Neumann's ordinal numbers are a convenience and not a reality. A real number is not a Dedekind cut nor a Cantor sequence. Real numbers live in mathematics precisely because of their multiple meanings. No one meaning is \"it\". It is a curious historical observation that the popularity of a set theoretic foundation came with Bourbaki and then with the new math just about the time when the uniqueness of the set theoretic foundation was challenged by Lawvere with alternative categorical axiomatizations. Thus we must conclude that there just does not exist a platonic world of sets, that large cardinals live in a never-never land, and that the continuum hypothesis will remain forever unsettled - Godei proved it consistent with the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, while Paul Cohen proved that it is independent of these axioms. Current attempts to settle the continuum hypothesis are therefore futile. Understanding the nature of mathematics is an effective guide to productive directions of research. Because of its protean nature, mathematics does not need a foundation - not by Plato, or Frege, or Whitehead-Russell, or Zermelo, or Hilbert, or Brouwer, or Quine, or Bishop. This is because it does not deal with one ultimate substance but with the forms common to different substances. Instead what mathematics does is to codify varied rules for calculation and for proofs and to organize and deepen understanding of what has been done. 8. Dead Ends Good understanding of the nature of mathematics helps us to realize when an apparent part of mathematics is in fact a dead end. One example is the notion\n\n10\n\nSaunders Mac Lane\n\nof a \"fuzzy\" set. In an ordinary set S, one knows of each potential element χ only whether it is in, or not in, S. For a fuzzy set.one has instead a \"level\" of membership: a function f(x), usually ranging from 0 to 1, specifying the extent to which χ belongs to the intended fuzzy set. At their origin such fuzzy sets were used to describe certain engineering control devices - things partly off or partly on according to circumstance. Thus they may have limited applications. But then the doctrine that mathematics is about sets took hold, and various people started to rewrite this or that part of mathematics with \"set\" replaced everywhere by \"fuzzy set\". This happened, for example, with topology, where fuzzy topology spaces grew rampant without any real relation to geometry or topology, but only with the aim of making general topology fuzzier. The result was more paper and not more progress. There are many other examples of mathematical dead ends. For instance, in universal algebra a so-called \"groupoid\" is a set with one binary operation, no further properties required - and hence no properties of consequence. Similar excesses have arisen in graph theory. A famous old theorem of Kuratowski specifies when a graph cannot be drawn in the plane without unwanted crossing: it must then contain either the complete graph on five points or a graph on two sets of three points with each point in the first set joined by an edge to each in the second. This Kuratowski theorem was a striking one. Unhappily, specialists tried to do the same sort of thing for graphs which cannot be drawn on the torus. They found a vast - and hence totally uninteresting - list of such \"non-toral\" graphs. In number theory, there is the fundamental theorem that every whole number can be written uniquely as a product of prime numbers. Nowadays, enthusiasts with big computers contend with each other as to who can so factor the biggest yet number. This becomes a display of virtuosity, hardly justified by the claimed use of factoring in breaking codes. Similar troubles arise in many applications of mathematics. Gauss invented least square approximations, and this can be used to make regressions - getting the best linear fit for given data in many variables. There are now canned programs which will do all the routine work of such fitting as a result things are fitted and \"shadow\" costs are determined from data that is incomplete and misleading, often because only some of the relevant variables appear. Here and elsewhere good mathematics requires discrimination. We need judgement and not inappropriate foundations or excess calculations. 9. Interrelated Networks In mathematics we have seen that the same form may represent different facts\n\nThe Protean Character of Mathematics\n\n11\n\n- the same symmetric group represents the permutations of the roots of an algebraic equation or the interchanges among the atoms of a molecule or the symmetries of a tetrahedron in higher dimensions. Or, the continuum of the reals is either axiomatized geometry in one dimensions or an extension of the rational number system or the basic range for physical measurements or... From this we conclude that mathematics is actually a tightly connected network of different forms and concepts. It combines rules, formulas, formal systems, theorems, applications, concepts, and algorithms, all of them extracted over the years from the facts of the world. One can then write extensive network diagrams - as in my cited book - to display how these mathematical centers are intertwined. One might say that the subject begins in the human experiences of: MOVING MEASURING SHAPING COMBINING COUNTING,\n\nand that these lead, more or less in that order, to disciplines such as APPLIED MATHEMATICS CALCULUS GEOMETRY ALGEBRA NUMBER THEORY.\n\n10. Progress Advances in the multiple realms of mathematics involves two complementary things: the solution of outstanding problems and the understanding of achieved results. There are many famous old problems in mathematics. There is Fermat's last theorem: to find two whole numbers whose nth powers for η > 2 add up to a single nth power. There is the Riemann hypothesis: where are the zeros of the zeta function - a function which controls much of the distribution of the prime numbers among the other integers. There is the Poincaré conjecture: to characterize the three dimensional sphere by homotopy properties from among other three dimensional manifolds (It has been solved in dimensions higher than 3, most recently in the difficult case of four dimensions, but the original case of the 3-sphere remains still unsettled). From time to time, some of these problems are solved. Thus, the Mordell conjecture stated that most polynomial equations, like that of Fermât, have at most a finite number of solutions in whole numbers. This has recently been settled by Faltings, who needed to use for this purpose some of the recent extensive abstract techniques of algebraic geometry. More unsolved problems await us. The other goal of mathematics is understanding. For example, a century ago, three dimensional space, where points are determined by three coordinates,\n\n12\n\nSaunders Mac Lane\n\nwas reduced to a space of vectors. At first this seemed to be just a technique to write one vector equation instead of three equations in coordinates - but it is actually much more. Vector spaces visualize the solutions of simultaneous linear equations, they formulate electrodynamic fields and other fields in physics, they allow geometry in more dimensions, even in infinite ones, and they provide a setting for the functional analysis of linear operators in analysis. There are many other ways in which greater understanding develops. Matrix multiplication is understood not by multiple subscripts, but by multilinearity of the tensor product, and so on and on. 11. An Example As an example of the long process of understanding a piece of mathematics, I take the case of Galois theory, dealing with the solution of algebraic equations. There, each quadratic equation can be solved by a familiar formula involving a square root - but it turns out that, for an equation of degree 5 or higher, no such solution by roots (\"radicals\") is possible. The reason was finally seen to lie in the study of the symmetries of an equation - the group of allowed permutations of its roots. Here is a list of some of the people who have contributed to the real understanding of this situation. Lagrange, 1770 Abel, 1827 Galois, 1830 Jordan, 1870 Dedekind, 1900 Steinitz, 1910 Emmy Noether, 1922 van der Waerden, 1931 J. F. Ritt, 1932 Emil Artin, 1938 Birkhoff/Mac Lane, 1941 Jacobson, 1944 Kolchin, 1946 Kan, 1957 Grothendieck, 1961 Chase-Rosenberg, 1965 Kaplansky, 1969 Joyal/Tierney, 1981 Kennison, 1983\n\nHe found certain resolvents Degree 5 by radicals is impossible Groups and subgroups enter decisively Wrote his Traité des substitutions on groups Glimpsed the conceptual formulation Included abstract fields in this study Saw the power of the conceptual approach Wrote it up in Moderne Algebra Extended Galois theory to differential algebra Brought in properties of linear dependence Presented this in Survey of Modern Algebra Included inseparable extensions of fields Brought in differential Picard-Vessiot theory Adjunctions explain Galois correspondences Introduced Galois theory for covering spaces Galois theory for rings (with Harrison) Lucid presentation, with examples and problems Generalized Grothendieck, with locales Theaters of action for Galois theory\n\nThe Protean Character of Mathematics\n\nJanelidze, 1988 Various, 1990\n\n13\n\nCategorical formulation of Galois structure One adjunction handles Galois and much more.\n\nThis example of growing understanding could be supplemented by many other cases of the gradual understanding of the protean and interconnected forms of mathematics. May protean understanding prosper!\n\nCategories of Space and of Quantity\n\nF. WILLIAM LAWVERE (New York)\n\n0. The ancient and honorable role of philosophy as a servant to the learning, development and use of scientific knowledge, though sadly underdeveloped since Grassmann, has been re-emerging from within the particular science of mathematics due to the latter's internal need; making this relationship more explicit (as well as further investigating the reasons for the decline) will, it is hoped, help to germinate the seeds of a brighter future for philosophy as well as help to guide the much wider learning of mathematics and hence of all the sciences. 1. The unity of interacting opposites \"space vs. quantity\", with the accompanying \"general vs. particular\" and the resulting division of variable quantity into the interacting opposites \"extensive vs. intensive\", is susceptible, with the aid of categories, functors, and natural transformations, of a formulation which is on the one hand precise enough to admit proved theorems and considerable technical development and yet is on the other hand general enough to admit incorporation of almost any specialized hypothesis. Readers armed with the mathematical definitions of basic category theory should be able to translate the discussion in this section into symbols and diagrams for calculations. 2. The role of space as an arena for quantitative \"becoming\" underlies the qualitative transformation of a spatial category into a homotopy category, on which extensive and intensive quantities reappear as homology and cohomology. 3. The understanding of an object in a spatial category can be approached through definite Moore-Postnikov levels; each of these levels constitutes a mathematically precise \"unity and identity of opposites\", and their ensemble bears features strongly reminiscent of Hegel's Science of Logic. This resemblance suggests many mathematical and philosophical problems which now seem susceptible of exact solution.\n\nCategories of Space and of Quantity\n\n15\n\n0. Renewed Progress in Philosophy Made Both Necessary and Possible by the Advance of Mathematics In his Lyceum, Aristotle used philosophy to lend clarity, directedness, and unity to the investigation and study of particular sciences. The programs of Bacon and Leibniz and the important effort of Hegel continued this trend. One of the clearest applications of this outlook to mathematics is to be found in the neglected 1844 introduction by Grassmann to his theory of extensive quantities. Optimistic affirmations and applications of it are also to be found in Maxwell's 1871 program for the classification of physical quantities and in Heaviside's 1887 struggle for the proper role of theory in the practice of longdistance telephone-line construction. In the latter, Heaviside formulates what has also been my own attitude for the past thirty years: the fact that our knowledge will of course never be complete, and hence no general theory will be final, is no excuse for not using now the most general theory which science can support, and indeed for accuracy we must do so. To students whose quest drives them in the above direction, the official bourgeois philosophy of the 20th century presents a near vacuum. This vacuum is the result of the Jamesian trend clearly analyzed by Lenin in 1908, but \"popularized\" by Carus, Mauthner, Dewey, Mussolini, Goebbels, etc. in order to create the current standard of truth in journalism and history; this trend led many philosophers to preoccupation with the flavors of the permutations of the thesis that no knowledge is actually possible. Naturally this 20th century vacuum has in particular tried to suck what it can of the soul of mathematics: a science student naively enrolling in a course styled \"Foundations of Mathematics\" is more likely to receive sermons about unknowability, based on some elementary abstract considerations about subjective infinity, than to receive the needed philosophical guide to a systematic understanding of the concrete richness of pure and applied mathematics as it has been and will be developed. By contrast, mathematics in this century has not been at a standstill. As a result mathematicians at their work benches have been forced to fashion philosophical tools (along with those proofs of theorems which are allegedly their sole product), and to act as their own \"Aristotles\" and \"Hegels\" as they struggle with the dialectics of 'general' and 'particular' within their field. This is done in almost complete ignorance of dialectical materialism and often with understandable disdain for philosophy in general. It was struggle with a problem involving spheres and the relation between passage to the limit and the leap from quantity to quality which led Eilenberg and Mac Lane in the early 1940's to formulate the general mathematical theory of categories, functors, and natural transformations. Similarly, study of concrete problems in algebraic\n\n16\n\nF. William Lawvere\n\ntopology, functional analysis, complex analysis, and algebraic geometry in the 1950's led Kan and Grothendieck to formulate and use important further advances such as adjoint functors and abelian categories. And the past thirty years have not been devoid of progress: from the first international meeting on category theory in La Jolla, California in 1965 to the most recent one in Como, Italy in 1990, toposes, enriched categories, 2-categories, monads, parameterized categories (sometimes called \"indexed\"), synthetic differential geometry, simplicial homotopy, etc. have been refined and developed by over two hundred researchers with strong ties to nearly every area of mathematics. In particular all the now-traditional areas of subjective logic have been incorporated with improvement into this emerging system of objective logic. It is my belief that in the next decade and in the next century the technical advances forged by category theorists will be of value to dialectical philosophy, lending precise form with disputable mathematical models to ancient philosophical distinctions such as general vs. particular, objective vs. subjective, being vs. becoming, space vs. quantity, equality vs. difference, quantitative vs. qualitative etc. In turn the explicit attention by mathematicians to such philosophical questions is necessary to achieve the goal of making mathematics (and hence other sciences) more widely learnable and useable. Of course this will require that philosophers learn mathematics and that mathematicians learn philosophy. I can recall, for example, how my failure to learn the philosophical meanings of \"form, substance, concept, organization\" led to misinterpretation by readers of my 1964 paper on the category of sets and of my 1968 paper on adjointness in foundations; a more profound study of Hegel's Wissenschaft der Logik and of Grassmann's Ausdehnungslehre may suggest simplifications and qualitative improvements in the circle of ideas sketched below. 1. Distributive and Linear Categories; The Functoriality of Extensive and Intensive Quantities A great many mathematical categories have both finite products and finite coproducts. (A product of an empty family is also known as a terminal object, and an empty coproduct as a coterminal or initial object). However, there are two special classes of categories defined by the validity of two special (mutually exclusive) relationships between product and coproduct. One of these may be called distributive categories, for these are defined by the requirement that the usual distributive law of arithmetic and algebra should hold for multiplication (=product) and addition (=coproduct) of objects, in the precise sense that the natural map from the appropriate sum of products to a product of sums should be an isomorphism; this includes as a special case that\n\nCategories of Space and of Quantity\n\n17\n\nthe product of any object by zero (=initial object) is zero. The other class of linear categories is defined by the requirement that products and coproducts coincide; more precisely, a coterminal object is also terminal in a linear category, which permits the definition of a natural map (=\"identity matrix\") from the coproduct of any two objects to their product, and moreover this natural map is required to be an isomorphism. As pointed out by Mac Lane in 1950, in any linear category there is a unique commutative and associative addition operation on the maps with given domain and given codomain, and the composition operation distributes over this addition; thus linear categories are the general contexts in which the basic formalism of linear algebra can be interpreted. All toposes are distributive. General categories of discrete sets, of continuous sets, of differentiable, measurable, or combinatorial spaces tend to be distributive, as do categories of non-linear dynamical systems. Given a particular space, there are categories of sheaves on it, of covering spaces of it, etc. which provide an expanded or restricted view of what happens in that particular space and are also distributive. Since both general (\"gros\") and particular (\"petit\") spatial categories are distributive categories, a useful philosophical determination would be the identification of \"categories of space\" with distributive categories. Since distributive categories such as that of the permutation representations of a group can often be seen to be isomorphic with spatial categories such as that of the covering spaces of a particular space having that group as fundamental group, the inverse identification has merit; it also permits to use geometrical methods to analyze categories of concepts or categories of recursive sets. For many purposes it is useful to \"normalize\" distributive categories by replacing them with the toposes they generate, permitting application of the higher-order internal logic of topos theory to the given distributive category; on the other hand many distributive categories are \"smaller\" than toposes and in particular have manageable Burnside rigs. Here by \"rig\" we mean a structure like a commutative ring except that it need not have negatives, and the name of Burnside was suggested by Dress to denote the process of abstraction (exploited recently by Schanuel) which Cantor learned from Steiner: the isomorphism classes of objects from a given distributive category form a rig when multiplied and added using product and coproduct; the algebra of this Burnside rig partly reflects the properties of the category and also partly measures the spaces in it in a way which (as suggested by Mayberry) gives deeper significance to the statement attributed to Pythagoras: \"Each thing is number\". Still in need of further clarification is the contrast within the class of distributive categories between the \"gros\" (general category of spaces of a certain kind) and the \"petit\" (category of variable sets over a\n\n18\n\nF. William Lawvere\n\nparticular space); this distinction (a qualitative one, not one of size) has been illuminated by Grothendieck and Dubuc and, I hope, by my 1986 Bogota paper [14]; these show the importance of the ways in which an object in a \"gros\" category can give rise to a \"petit\" category, and the additional \"structure sheaf in the \"petit\" category which reflects its origin in the \"gros\" environment. The category of real \"vector spaces\", the category of abelian groups, the category of topological vector spaces and the category of bornological vector spaces are all linear categories. So are the category of projective modules over any particular rig and the category of vector bundles over any particular space. In the last example, the vector bundles (=objects) themselves are kinds of variable quantities over the space, and the maps between these are particular variable quantities over the space. Thus \"categories of quantity\" will be tentatively identified with linear categories. Abelian AB5 categories are special linear categories having further \"exactness\" properties; again \"normalization\" may be useful, even within functional analysis. For abelian categories and many others, the Mac Lane addition of maps is actually an abelian group, that is, each map has a negative. However, for some other linear categories addition is actually idempotent (and hence could not have negatives in this algebraic sense); this occurs in logic (in the narrow sense) where the quantities are variable truth values (reflecting \"relations\"), and in geometry when quantities are (variable) dimensions and the multiplication is not idempotent. What is a space and how can quantities vary over a space? We have suggested above that, formally, a space is either a \"petit\" distributive category or an object in a \"gros\" distributive category. But as spaces actually arise and are used in mathematical science, they have two main general conceptual features: first they serve as an arena for \"becoming\" (there are spaces of states as well as spaces of locations) and secondly they serve as domains for variable quantity. These two aspects of space need to be expressed in as general a mathematical form as possible: in section 2,1 will return to \"becoming\" and one of its roles in mathematics, but in this section 1 concentrate on the relation between space and variable quantity. Broadly speaking there are two kinds of variable quantity, the extensive and the intensive. Again speaking broadly, the extensive quantities are \"quantity of space\" and the intensive quantities are \"ratios\" between extensive ones. For example, mass and volume are extensive (measures), while density is intensive (function). Although Maxwell managed to get extensive quantities accepted within the particular science of thermodynamics, and although Grassmann demonstrated their importance in geometry, there is still a reluctance to give them status equal to that of functions and differential forms; in particular the use of the absurd terminology \"generalized function\" for such distributions as\n\nCategories of Space and of Quantity\n\n19\n\nthe derivative of the Dirac measure has created a lot of confusion, for as Courant in effect observed, they are not intensive quantities, generalized or not. \"Generalized measure\" would have been a better description of distributions; to show that a distribution \"is a function\" involves finding a density for it relative to a \"fixed\" reference measure, but only in special noninvariant circumstances do the latter exist. Broadly, a \"type of extensive quantity\" is a covariant coproduct-preserving functor from a distributive category to a linear category. The last condition reflects the idea that if a space is a sum of two smaller spaces, then a distribution of the given type on it should be determined by an arbitrary pair of distributions, one on each of the smaller spaces, while by the defining property of a linear category, \"pairs\" are equally well expressed in terms of coproducts in the codomain of our functor. The covariant functoriality has itself non-trivial consequences: the value of the functor at the terminal space may be considered to consist of constant quantities of the given type, and the value of the functor at a given space to consist of the extensive quantities of the given type which are variable over that space; since any given space has a unique map to the terminal space, the functor induces a map in the linear category which assigns to each variable extensive quantity its total, which is a constant. For example, the quantity of smoke now in my room varies over the room, but in particular has a total. On the other hand a map from the terminal space to a given space is a point of that space; thus the functor assigns to such a point a linear map which to any constant weight of the given type assigns the Dirac measure of that weight which is supported on that point. For a more particular example of the covariant functoriality in which neither domain nor codomain of the inducing map reduces to the terminal space, consider the following definition of the term sojourn: the extensive quantity-type is time(-difference) and there are two spaces, one representing a time interval of, for example, July and the other for example, the continent of Europe. On the first space there is a particular extensive quantity of this type known as duration. A particular journey might be a map (in an appropriate distributive category) from the first space to the second, hence via the functor the journey acts on the duration to produce on the continent a variable extensive quantity known as the sojourn (in each given part of the continent) of my journey. As another example, if I project my room onto the floor, the quantity of smoke is transformed into the quantity of smoke over the floor. A further determination is suggested by the idea \"space of quantity\" which lies at the base of (not only cartesian coordinatizing but also) calculus of variations and functional analysis: the variable quantities (extensive or intensive) of a given type over a given space should themselves form a space (often infinite-\n\n20\n\nF. William Lawvere\n\ndimensional) which contains its own processes of \"becoming\" (continuous, differentiable, etc.) and is itself the domain of further variable quantities. This idea can be realized as follows: over a given distributive category of spaces, consider the linear category of all spaces equipped with given additions and all maps which preserve these; the forgetting functor from the latter to the former expresses in a general way that these quantity-types \"are\" spaces. But then in particular an extensive quantity-type from the distributive category to this linear category can be subjected to the further requirement that it be enriched (or strong) in the sense of enriched category theory, i.e. roughly that as a functor it be concordant with \"becoming\" (parameterization). By contrast an intensive quantity-type is a contravariant functor, taking coproducts to products, from a distributive category, but now a functor whose values have a multiplicative structure as well as an additive structure. Frequently the values of an intensive type are construed to be rigs, such as the ring of continuous or smooth functions or the lattice of propositional functions on the various spaces in the distributive category, with the funcloriality given by substitution; however, since we also need to consider vector- and tensor-valued \"functions\", it is more adequate to consider that a typical value of an intensive quantity-type is itself a linear category, with composition in the latter being the multiplicative structure and with each spatial map inducing via the type a linear functor (in the opposite direction) between the two \"petit\" categories of intensive quantities on the domain and codomain spaces of the map. From the latter point of view the rigs are just endomap objects of certain preferred objects in these intensive categories, and in some examples (such as the analytic, though not the differentiable, study of projective space), knowledge of the rigs may not suffice to determine the intensive categories. To exemplify the contravariant functoriality, the terminal map from a given space induces the \"inclusion\" of constant quantities of the given type as special \"variable\" intensive quantities on the space, while a given point of the space induces the evaluation at that point of any intensive quantity (caution: in general an intensive quantity may not be determined by the ensemble of its values at points); a particular journey of a month through a continent induces a transformation of any intensive quantity on the continent (such as the frequency with which a given language can be heard) into an intensive quantity varying over the month. Again by specializing to the linear objects in the given distributive category as possible map-objects for the intensive categories assigned to each space, the important \"space of quantity\" idea, as well as a further enrichment requirement on the types, can also be realized for intensive quantities.\n\nCategories of Space and of Quantity\n\n21\n\nMoreover, if the distributive category is actually \"cartesian-closed\" (so has a \"space of maps\" between any two spaces, satisfying the objective relations which were used since the first days of the calculus of variations and which in this century were subjectively codified as \"lambda-calculus\") then the further important idea of the possible representability of components of an intensive quantity-type comes into play. Namely, the represented intensive quantity-type is defined to have as objects always the linear spaces in the distributive category itself, but each given space is defined to have as the map-objects of the corresponding intensive category the space of all maps from the given space to the spaces of linear maps between given linear spaces, the latter being the \"representors\"; an intensive quantity type is called representable if it is equivalent to a full part of this represented one. For example, the usual ring of smooth functions is representable when the constant scalare form a smooth space, and the lattice of propositional functions is representable when truthvalues form a space (as they do in a topos). It should be pointed out that there is a second doctrine of extensive/intensive quantities which agrees with the above when only \"compact\" spaces are considered, but which in general permits only \"proper\" spatial maps to induce (co-and contra-variantly) maps of quantities. Since they admit \"totals\", the extensive quantities which I described above should perhaps be thought of as being restricted to have \"compact support\", while the intensive quantities are \"unrestricted\" and thus might be representable, both of these features being compatible with my requirement of functoriality on arbitrary spatial maps in the distributive category. By contrast, the second \"proper\" doctrine is useful when considering \"unrestricted\" extensive quantities (such as area on the whole plane) but must correspondingly impose \"compact support\" restrictions on the intensive quantities, making the latter non-representable. These remarks presuppose the relation between extensive and intensive quantities, to which I will now turn. The common spatial base of extensive and intensive quantities also supports the relation between the two, which is that the intensives act on the extensives. For example, a particular density function acts on a particular volume distribution to produce a resulting mass distribution. Thus it should be possible to \"multiply\" a given extensive quantity on a certain space by an intensive quantity (of appropriate type) on the same space to produce another extensive quantity on the same space. The definite integral of the intensive quantity \"with respect to\" the first extensive quantity is defined to be the total of this second resulting extensive quantity. This action (or \"multiplication\") of the contravariant on the covariant satisfies bilinearity and also satisfies, with respect to the multiplicative structure within the intensive quantities and along\n\n22\n\nF. William Lawvere\n\nany inducing spatial map, an extremely important strong homogeneity condition which so far has carried different names in different fields: in algebraic topology this homogeneity is called the \"projection formula\", in group representation theory it lies at the base of \"Frobenius reciprocity\", in quantum mechanics it is called \"covariance\" or the \"canonical commutation relation\", while in subjective logic it is often submerged into a side condition on variables for the validity of the rule of inference for existential quantification when applied to a conjunction. It is in terms of such \"action\" ( or \"multiplication\") of intensive quantities on extensive quantities that the role of the former as \"ratios\" of the latter must be understood. As in the study of rational functions and in the definition of derivative, algebra recognizes that multiplication is fundamental whereas \"ratio\" is an inverse process; while the simple prescription \"you can't divide by zero\" may suffice for constant quantities, its ramifications for variable quantities are fraught with particularity, as reflected in even the purely algebraic \"localization\" constructions. For example, a given mass or charge distribution may not admit a density, with respect to volume, and not only the existence but also the uniqueness of such ratios may require serious study in particular situations, even though the multiplication which they invert is \"everywhere\" well-defined; the famous Radon-Nikodym theorem gives conditions for this in a specific context. How can systems of extensive and intensive quantities, with action of the latter on the former, be realized on various distributive categories which mathematically arise? As mentioned above, the intensive quantities are often representable (indeed more often than commonly noticed, for example differential forms can be represented via the \"fractional exponentiation\" which exists in certain gros toposes). An important class of extensive quantities can be identified with the (smooth linear) functionals (with codomain a fixed linear space such as that of constant scalars) on the given intensive quantities, i.e. a distribution may sometimes be determined by the ensemble of all definite integrals (with respect to it) of all appropriate intensive quantities. This identification, supported in a particular context by the classical Riesz representation theorem (and in the homotopical context of section 2 below, by the universal coefficient theorem), contributed to the flourishing of functional analysis, but perhaps also distracted attention from the fact that extensive quantities are at least as basic as the intensive ones. At any rate, the fundamental projection formula/canonical commutation relation is automatic for those extensive quantities which can be identified as functionals on the intensive ones; here the action is defined in terms of the integral of the multiplication of intensive quantities.\n\nCategories of Space and of Quantity\n\n23\n\nThis automatic validity of the fundamental formula holds also for a certain \"opposite\" situation in which a concept of intensive quantity can be defined to consist of transformations on given extensive concepts. More precisely, recall that I suggested above a general definition of extensive quantity type on a given distributive category as an enriched additive covariant functor from the given distributive category to the linear spaces in it. Given two such functors, we can consider natural transformations from one to the other, which thus can tautologously \"multiply\" extensive quantities of the first type to yield extensive quantities of the second type. Such natural transformations, however, are constant intensive quantities (i.e. \"varying\" only over the terminal space) since they operate over the whole distributive category. But the idea of natural transformation also includes all variable intensive quantities over some given space (and between two extensive functors), if we only make the following modification. An extremely useful construction, first emphasized by Grothendieck around 1960 (although it occurs already in Eilenberg and Mac Lane's original paper), associates a new category to any given object in a given category by considering as new objects all the maps with codomain the given object, and as new maps all the commutative triangles between these; this construction, a special case of the ill-named \"comma category\", has manifold applications revolving around the idea that both a part (with \"multiplicity\") of the given space as well as a family of spaces (\"the fibers\") smoothly parameterized by the given space are themselves objects in a new category; borrowing from Grothendieck, we may for short call this category the \"gros\" category of the given space (the \"gros\" category of the terminal space reducing to the given distributive category). Often a distributive category is in fact locally distributive, in the sense that for each space in it the associated \"gros\" category is again distributive. (The \"petit\" category of a space is usually a certain full subcategory of its \"gros\" category). A map between two spaces obviously induces by composition a coproduct preserving functor from the \"gros\" category of the first to the \"gros\" category of the second; in particular, the \"gros\" category of a space thus has a forgetting functor to the original distributive category of spaces. Composing this forgetting functor with two given extensive types, an intensive quantity varying over the given space may then be defined to be any natural transformation between the resulting composite functors. Thus according to this point of view, in the intensive category associated to a space, not only are the maps identified with intensive quantities varying over the space, but the objects are (or arise from) the types of extensive quantity which the whole category of spaces supports. The most fundamental measure of a thing is the thing itself. If we replace \"thing\" by \"object\" (for example object in a category of spaces), then \"itself\n\n24\n\nF. William Lawvere\n\nmay be usefully identified with the Pythagoras-Steiner-Burnside abstraction process discussed earlier: that is, isomorphic objects are identified, but all other maps are temporarily neglected. This obviously depends on what category the object is in, and the maps still play an important role in constructing and comparing new categories upon which the same abstraction process can be performed, notably the \"gros\" or \"comma\" categories of given spaces (as discussed above) and various \"petit\", \"proper\", \"covering\", \"subobject\" etc. subcategories of these. Moreover, in any locally distributive category there is for each map a \"pullback\" functor between the associated pair of \"gros\" categories, right adjoint to the obvious composition/forgetting functor previously mentioned. Thus, given a class of objects closed under coproduct (for example the class of finite, or discrete, or compact objects, or of the objects of fixed dimension, or intersections of these classes, etc) one can define a corresponding extensive quantity-type by assigning to each space (the abstraction of) the part of the \"gros\" category of that space which consists of those maps whose domains are in the class; this is obviously covariantly functorial via the composition/forgetting procedure. Given two such classes of objects, an intensive quantity from the one to the other, varying over a given space, can be defined to be (the abstraction of) any object of the \"gros\" category of the space which is proper in the sense that pulling back by it takes extensives of the one class into extensives of the other. Both the contravariant functoriality of these intensives as well as (tautologously) their action on such extensives is given by pullback, and the projection formula/CCR results from simple general lemmas about composition and pullback valid in any category. This concrete doctrine of quantity is explicitly or implicitly used in many branches of geometry, and I suspect that its direct use in many applications would be easier than translating everything into numbers (I recall a restaurant in New York in which customers, cooks, waiters, and the cashier may speak different languages, yet rapid operation is achieved without any written orders nor bills by simply stacking used dishes according to shape). One of the unsolved problems of the foundations of mathematics is to explain how and where the usual smooth distributions and functions of analysis can be obtained in this concrete mode. As already the Grassmann brothers understood, the basic subject-matter of narrow-sense logic is quantities which are additively idempotent. The intensive aspect of this has been much studied, and is (at least fundamentally) concrete in the above sense, corresponding to parts without multiplicity (i.e. to subobjects); indeed one of the two basic axioms of topos theory is that subobjects are representable by (indicator maps to) the truth-value space. On the other hand the great variety of useful extensive logic has been little studied (at least\n\nCategories of Space and of Quantity\n\n25\n\nas logic). In practice logic is not really a starting-point but rather the study of supports and roots of non-idempotent quantity: for example, the inhabited part of the world is the part where population exists, yet population (unlike the indicator of the part) is a non-idempotent quantity; distributions have supports and a pair of functions determines the (\"root-\") space of their agreement as well as the (\"open\") subspace of their disagreement. While the Dedekind definition of a real intensive quantity as an ensemble of answers to yes-no questions has many uses, we should not let pragmatism blind us to the fact that a procedure for coming to know the quantity is by no means identical with the objectively operating quantity itself. The (still to be studied) extensive logic should be the codomain of an adequate general theory of the supports of extensive quantities, a theory accounting for certain rules of inference as reflections of the commutation relations for variable quantities; such relationships are studied in the branch of algebraic geometry known as intersection theory, but raising certain aspects of the latter to the level of philosophy should help to make them more approachable and also to suggest in what way they might be applied to other distributive categories. It may be that, to accord more accurately with historical philosophical terminology, all the above occurrences of the word \"quantity\" should be replaced by \"number\", with the former being reserved for use in conjunction with the \"affine\" categories whose study has recently been revived by Schanuel, Carboni, Faro, Thiébaud and others; Grassmann seems to insist that numbers are differences of quantities (as for example work is a difference of energies, and duration a difference of instants), and further understanding of affine categories may reveal them as an objective basis of the link between distributive and linear categories. There are moreover \"non-commutative affine objects\" known as \"symmetric spaces\" which include not only Lie groups, but also spheres, but whose intrinsic categorical property and role has been little explored. 2. Homotopy Negates yet Retains Spatiality The role of space as arena of \"becoming\" has as one consequence a quite specific form of the transformation of quantitative into qualitative; the seemingly endless elaboration of varied cohomology theories is not merely some expression of mathematicians' fanatical fascination for fashion, but flows from the necessity of that transformation. One of the main features which distinguish the general \"gros\" spatial categories from the particular \"petit\" ones is the presence of spaces which can act as internal parameterizers of \"becoming\". Formally, the essential properties of\n\n26\n\nF. William Lawvere\n\nsuch a parameterizer space are that it is connected and strictly bipointed. Connectedness means that the space is not the coproduct of smaller spaces; when the category has a subcategory of \"discrete\" spaces, the inclusion functor having a left adjoint \"components\" functor, then connectedness of a space means that its space of components is terminal. Strict bipointedness means that (at least) two points (maps from the terminal space) of the space can be distinguished, where \"distinguished\" is taken in the strong sense that the two points are disjoint as subobjects, or in other words their \"equalizer\" is initial. (These definitions are often usefully extended from objects to \"cylinders\", i.e. to maps (with not-necessarily-terminal codomains) with a pair of common \"sections\" (generalizing \"points\")). In order to maintain the rather heroic avoidance, which this paper has so far managed, of the traditional use of symbols to multiply the availability of pronouns, I will refer to the points of such a strictly bipointed connected space as \"instants\", without implying that that space is \"one-dimensional\" nor any further analysis of time. Note that, depending on the nature of the ambient \"gros\" distributive category, connectedness need not imply that the object is infinite; for the planning of activities and of calculations in the continuous material world, finite combinatorial models of the latter are necessary, and such models may in themselves constitute an appropriate category, the category of \"simplicial sets\" being a widely-used example. Now a specific process of \"becoming\" in a certain space will be (accompanied by) a specific map to that space from a connected strictly bipointed space, whereby in particular the point to which one distinguished instant is mapped \"becomes\" the point to which the other distinguished instant is mapped. In particular, one map between two given spaces can \"become\" a second such map, as is explained by the usual definition of \"homotopy\" between the two maps, or equivalently (in the Hurewicz spirit), using if necessary the technique of embedding in presheaf categories to construe any distributive category as (part of) a cartesian-closed one, by applying directly the above account of \"becoming\" to points in the appropriate map-space. Obviously a very important application (of such internalization to a spatial category of the notion of \"becoming\") is the detailed study of dynamical processes themselves, bringing to bear the rich mathematical content which the category may have. However, in this section I will concentrate on the qualitative structure which remains after all such connected processes of \"becoming\" are imagined completed, that is, after any two maps which can possibly become one another are regarded as identical. The traditional description of quantity as that which can be increased and decreased leads one to define a space as \"quantitative\" if it admits an action of a\n\nCategories of Space and of Quantity\n\n27\n\nconnected strictly bipointed object, wherein one of the two distinguished instants acts as the identity on the space, whereas the other acts as a constant; thus the whole space can be \"decreased to a point\". This is a much stronger requirement than connectedness of the space and is usually called contractibility. This use of \"quantitative\" is not unrelated to the use of \"quantity\" in section 1, since representing objects for intensive quantities are often contractible. With a \"gros\" spatial category it is usually possible to associate a new category called its homotopy category, in which homotopic maps become equal and contractible spaces all become isomorphic to the terminal space; in general two spaces which become isomorphic in the homotopy category are said to have the same homotopy type. For this association to exist the composition of homotopy-classes of maps must be well-defined, which in turn rests on an appropriate compatibility between connectedness and categorical product; in particular the product of two connected spaces should be connected. The latter is almost never true for \"petit\" distributive categories. In case the category is cartesian closed and has a components functor, the appropriate compatibility is assured if the components functor preserves products. To any such case Hurewicz's definition of the homotopy category, as the one whose map-spaces are the component spaces of the original map-spaces, can immediately be generalized, and indeed also extended to any category enriched in the given spatial category, such as pointed spaces, spaces with given dynamical actions, etc. yielding corresponding new qualitative categories which are enriched in the homotopy category. Using the product-preservation of the components functor and the fact that composition in a cartesian-closed category can be internally construed as itself a map whose domain is a product (of two map-spaces), it is easy to see that Hurewicz's definition supports a unique reasonable definition of composition of the maps in the homotopy category. Now the main point which I wish to make is that essentially the whole account of space vs. quantity and extensive vs. intensive quantity given in section 1 reproduces itself at the qualitative level of the homotopy category. The latter is itself again a distributive category, cartesian closed if the original spatial category was. Indeed more precisely, the homotopy-type functor connecting the two actually preserves products, coproducts, and the map-space construction. On the other hand the homotopy category is not locally distributive: the passage to the parametric homotopy category of the \"gros\" category of a given parameter space seems to involve a further qualitative leap, not as passive as the corresponding passage in the quantitative context. Although obtained by nullifying \"quantitative\" spaces, the homotopy category still admits extensive measurements of its objects, the most basic ones being the number of holes of given dimensions. The extensive quantity-types\n\n28\n\nF. William Lawverc\n\nhere are usually called homology theories. Dually, the intensive quantity-types are cohomology theories, enjoying the features of contravariance, multiplicativity (\"cup\" product), and action as \"ratios\" of homology quantities. By a celebrated theorem, cohomology is often representable on the homotopy category, by objects known for their discoverers as Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces. There is a strong tendency for basic homology and cohomology quantities to be (approximated by) linear functionals on each other. A new feature (probably distinguishing homotopy categories from the other distributive categories which do contain \"becoming\"-parameterizers and \"quantitative\" objects, although an axiomatic definition is unclear to me) is the appearance of homotopy groups, extensive quantity-types finer than homology and (co-) representable (by spheres). Note that the definition of \"point\" when applied in a homotopy category in fact means \"component\". 3. \"Unity and Identity of Opposites\" as a Specific Mathematical Structure; Philosophical Dimension Not only should considerations of the above sort provide a useful guide to the learning and application of mathematics, but also the investigation of a given spatial category can be partly guided by philosophical principles. One of these is described, in conjunction with a particular application, in my paper \"Display of graphics and their applications, as exemplified by 2-categories and the Hegelian Taco'\". Namely, within the system of subcategories of the category to be investigated, one can find a structure of ascending richness which closely parallels that of Hegel's Science of Logic, with each object to be investigated having its reflection and coreflection into each of the ascending levels. Here a level is formally defined as a functor from the given category (to a \"smaller\" one) which has both left and right adjoint sections; these sections are then the full inclusions of two subcategories which in themselves are \"identical\" (to the smaller category) but which as subcategories are \"opposite\" in the perfectly precise sense given by the adjointness, and the two composite idempotent functors resulting on the given category provide (via the adjunction maps) the particular reflection and coreflection in this level of any given space. In combinatorial topology such a level is exemplified by all spaces of dimension less than n, with the idempotent functors being called n-skeleton and n-coskeleton; in other cases the \"dimensions\" naming the levels may have a structure more (or less) rich than that of just natural numbers. Dimension \"minus infinity\" has the initial object and the terminal object as its two inclusion functors (in themselves, both are identical with the terminal category, but in the spatial\n\nCategories of Space and of Quantity\n\n29\n\ncategory they are opposite); it seems to me that there is good reason to identify the initial and terminal objects with Hegel's \"non-being\" and (pure) \"being\" respectively. While the relation of one level's being lower than another (and hence of one \"dimension's\" being less than or equal to another) can be defined in an obvious categorical way"
