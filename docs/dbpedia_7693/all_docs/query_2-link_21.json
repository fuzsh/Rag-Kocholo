        "text": "The article considers the question of synesthesia taking as a departing point the meaning of the synesthetic experience, both in a synesthete, in a philosopher who experiences drug induced synesthesia and some accounts about synesthesia and culture. It is possible then to pursue a confrontation between the trend towards specialisation of knowledge and senses which is characteristic of Modernity and a history of synesthesia in arts, which, even if negotiating with different aesthetic and semiothic circumstances seems to always follow the opposite direction, always claiming for lost unity. The need for a cultural theory of synesthesia is also suggested. Keywords: synesthesia, digital perception, art, culture, Modernity, meaning, experience.\n\nSynesthesia has received much attention in science, art and in particular in the overlapping fields of digital art and multimedia in the last decade (cf. Collopy 2000, Brougher et al. 2005, Ward 2008). Artists and scientists in these fields share a common interest in human perception. In the arts, synesthesia refers to a range of phenomena of simultaneous perception of two or more stimuli as one gestalt experience (van Campen 2007). In neuroscience, synesthesia is more strictly defined as “the elicitation of perceptual experiences in the absence of the normal sensory stimulation” (Ward & Mattingley 2006: 130). About one in twenty-three persons has a type of ‘neurological’ synesthesia (Simner et al. 2006). Over 50 types have been reported (Day 2008), and people differ in intensity of the experience (cf. Dixon et al. 2004). The most common type of synesthesia is colored weekdays, while the type of perceiving colored letters and numbers is most studied by scientists, and the type of co...\n\nSynesthetes are people who report having perceptual experiences that are very unusual, such as “seeing” sounds as colors or “smelling” colors as odors. It is commonly assumed these days that such synesthetic experiences must be instances of misperceptions. Against this widespread assumption, I will highlight that there is reason to think that at least some synesthetic experiences can be viewed as truly veridical perceptions, and not as illusions or hallucinations. On this view, which I will back up by conceptual arguments and empirical data, synesthesia does sometimes enable the individual to truly pick up on worldly features. In failing to take this possibility on board, the participants in this debate have thus unduly restricted the scope of dialectical options. Finally, the reassessment of synesthetic experiences that I defend in this paper will turn out to have important ramifications not just for synesthesia research, but also for perception theories more generally.\n\nEtymologically derived from a combination of the Greek syn, for together, and aisthêsis, for perception through the senses, the term synesthesia (also spelled synaesthesia) denotes a process of inter-sense analogy, whereby one sense modality experiences what usually belongs to one or more of the other senses. This paper explores the distinct approaches that Art, Science, and Philosophy have assumed towards the concept, and discusses how an awareness of synesthetic bodily-mental-sensory processes opens up new perspectives of research that may interrelate the arts with cognitive neuroscience, as well as transform other fields of contemporary knowledge."
