For this purpose, refer for example to “Erddrucktheorien” by Árpád Kézdi from 1962 or to part II of the series on excavations by Anton Weißenbach from 1975, which essentially includes earth pressure issues although in this case mainly concerned with its application for excavation walls. In the meantime, the topic has been treated repeatedly as part of works in the ﬁelds of soil mechanics and foundation engineering, see for example “Bodenmechanik” by Gerd Gudehus from 1981 or the contributions to the “Grundbau-Taschenbuch”. Despite the importance of earth pressure theories in structural engineering, the current view has not been written yet. Many analytical applications have proved useful for decades. In recent years, the Finite-Element Method has been added as a new tool, and in practice, the displacement dependency of earth pressure has to be considered in more detail. Essentially, this book has three major themes. Firstly, to make a set of working instructions available to civil and structural engineers in construction companies, engineering ﬁrms and design departments as well as students. This is supplemented with comments on the current earth pressure standard of 2017 and the collection of samples from 2018. Then current methods for determining earth pressure are presented in detail. However, a basic understanding of today’s common theories and rules is hardly conceivable without a thorough study of history. The ﬁrst empirical design rules were already known to the Romans; hints can be found in the publications by Vitruvius. Today’s theories began in France more than three centuries ago and are closely associated with French military engineers. The third major theme is therefore dedicated to historical development, complemented by the biographies of selected researchers who have made significant contributions to the subject of earth pressure. Without the support of assistants, it is hardly possible to complete a book. Jan Deutschmann has provided untiring, quick and competent support, as well as\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nMarcel Deckert, Ingmar Zehn and Annette Richter.

engineering. It is also one of the three pillars of structural engineering together with arch theory and beam theory. The ﬁrst written sources, dating back to Vitruvius, are more than 2000 years old and therefore much older than the well-known theories of Coulomb (1773/1776) or Rankine (1857). In the ﬁrst and sixth volume of his ten books, Vitruvius deals with the mode of action of earth pressure on retaining walls and proposes buttresses. Vauban, one of the greatest engineers in history, already published design tables for retaining walls with heights of up to 15 m in 1684, which cannot be bettered even today. The development of the earth pressure theory is described in detail in chapter 2 which is based on the extended edition of “The History of the Theory of Structures. Searching for Equilibrium” by Kurrer (2018). The present book can only include a limited selection of current design methods. The aim of the book is to provide a set of work instructions for foundation engineers and structural engineers in construction companies, engineering consultancies and in design departments, but also for students. In order to further theoretical understanding, the essential principles for determining earth pressure are initially presented in chapter 3. Chapters 4 to 12 contain the most important methods of determining active and passive earth pressure as well as at-rest earth pressure. In chapters 7 and 8, the spatial eﬀects of earth pressure are taken into account. One concern of this book is to give a short overview of non-everyday questions and to refer to further literature (see chapter 14). In recent years, the displacement dependency of earth pressure has increasingly come into view. This applies not only to passive but also to active cases (see chapter 15). The book oﬀers also instructions for practical application in chapter 16 and is supplemented by earth pressure tables for the most important basic cases. Many questions were submitted to the DIN Committee “calculation methods”, and a selection of these is discussed in the commentary to DIN 4085 in chapter 17. In the last section of this chapter, references are provided to the examples in the supplement to DIN 4085, which was published in December 2018. The history of earth pressure theory in chapter 2 includes a few selected short biographies of scientists and engineers working in the ﬁeld who have taken up and developed the subject over the centuries, see chapter 18. The book is supplemented by two appendices with terms, symbols and indices (Appendix A) and Earth Pressure, First Edition. Achim Hettler and Karl-Eugen Kurrer. © 2020 Ernst & Sohn Verlag GmbH & Co.

Even today, the archetypal forms are the basic ways of building (v. Halász, 1988, p. 257). Whereas digging reaches back into the depths of the animal-human transition, the teocalli of the Aztecs were magniﬁcent pyramids built by piling and tipping. In fact, teocalli means “covered by stones” (v. Halász, 1988, p. 257), the core of the pyramid consisting of a pile of earth. Building with earth – earthworks – is, even today, based on three elementary forms of activity: digging, piling and tipping. Moving great bodies of soil to form the embankments, cuttings and cuts required during the building of roads, railways and waterways has changed and still changes not only the relief of the natural landscape, but also the urban landscape (Guillerme, 1995). The evolution of geotechnical engineering up to 1700 has been summarised in an extensive congress paper by Jean Kérisel, who from 1951 to 1969 was honorary professor of soil mechanics at the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées in Paris (Kérisel, 1985). In contrast to that work, this chapter will try to trace the theory of earth pressure from its beginnings shortly before the turn of the 18th century right up to the present day from the perspective of the history of theory of structures. Besides original sources, the following historical studies have been consulted: (Corradi, 1995 & 2002), (Chrimes, 2008), (Feld, 1928 & 1948), (Golder, 1948 & 1953), (Guillerme, 1995, pp. 85-145), (Habib, 1991), (Herries & Orme, 1989), (Heyman, 1972), (Jáky, 1937/1938), (Kalle & Zentgraf, 1992), (Kérisel, 1953), (Kötter, 1893), (Llorente, 2015), (Marr, 2003), (Martony de Köszegh, 1828), (Mayniel, 1808), (Mehrtens, 1912, pp. 55-73), (Ohde, 1948-1952), (Peck, 1985), (Reissner, 1910), (Skempton, 1981 & 1985), Verdeyen (1959) and (Winkler, 1872). Around the middle of the 19th century, Alexandre Collin (1808-1890) started to shape the theory of earthworks through his theory of embankments made from cohesive soils backed up by experiments (Collin, 1846). Ten years later, Culmann published his article Ueber die Gleichgewichtsbedingungen von Erdmassen (on the equilibrium conditions of bodies of soil) (Culmann, 1856), which was followed in 1872 by his paper on earthworks (Culmann, 1872). In 1888 Earth Pressure, First Edition. Achim Hettler and Karl-Eugen Kurrer. © 2020 Ernst & Sohn Verlag GmbH & Co. KG. Published 2020 by Ernst & Sohn Verlag GmbH & Co. KG.\n\n4\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\nKarl von Ott, professor of soil mechanics at the German Technical University in Prague, divided his lectures into • • • •\n\nthe theory of earthworks (or embankments), the theory of retaining walls, the theory of the masonry arch, and elastic theory and its application to timber and iron structures paying particular attention to roofs and bridges.\n\nWhat he understood by earthworks was the creation of certain soil forms “known by the names of dams, ramparts, cuttings, cuts, etc., the creation of which requires working the material supplied by the natural soil” (v. Ott, 1888, p. 2). Laws governing the equilibrium of such bodies of earth (Fig. 2.1) were postulated in his book Theorie des Erdbaues oder der Böschungen (theory of earthworks or embankments) (v. Ott, 1888, p. 2). It was August von Kaven who provided a classical summary of the theory of earthworks in the middle of the classical phase of theory of structures (1875-1900) (v. Kaven, 1885). But the theory of earthworks did not gain new momentum (e.g. (Hultin, 1916), (Fellenius, 1927)) until the investigations into the collapse of the quayside at Gothenburg on 5 March 1916 (Petterson, 1916). Earth pressure theory backed up by experimentation started to assert itself as soil mechanics evolved in the 1920s, with Terzaghi pointing the way forward with his seminal work Erdbaumechanik auf bodenphysikalischer Grundlage (mechanics of soil in construction) (Terzaghi, 1925). Today, the theory of embankments and earth pressure theory are part of soil mechanics (Fig. 2.2), which in turn is a subdiscipline of geotechnical engineering. Earth pressure theory can look back on 300 years of history. The ﬁrst half of that was dominated by French engineering oﬃcers, a list of names stretching from Vauban to Bélidor to Coulomb to Poncelet, who were involved with the planning, design, construction and upkeep of fortiﬁcations. In the following sections, the thesis postulated is that the Corps du Génie Militaire of the early 18th century not only played a decisive role in the development of modern civil engineering, but Fig. 2.1 Investigating the stability of an embankment loaded through excavation; 𝜓 = angle of slip plane, 𝜌 = angle of internal friction (v. Ott, 1888, p. 20).\n\n2.1 Retaining walls for fortiﬁcations\n\nFig. 2.2 The illustration on this book cover shows a schematic view of the investigation of a slip circle in the subsoil behind a retaining wall (Türke, 1990).\n\nalso that the engineering oﬃcers of that corps created the ﬁrst genuine engineering science theory in the form of earth pressure theory, providing civil engineers with a scientiﬁc conception for their work. Not until the establishment phase of theory of structures (1850-1875) (Kurrer, 2018, pp. 20-21) would the supremacy of the engineering oﬃcer in the ﬁeld of earth pressure be overtaken by that of the railway engineer. So the building of fortiﬁcations, with earth pressure theory providing a scientiﬁc tool, marks the birth of modern civil engineering.\n\n2.1 Retaining walls for fortiﬁcations The building of fortiﬁcations in Europe from the early years of the modern era right up to the completion of the Industrial Revolution in the countries of continental Europe was based on earthworks, which together with masonry resulted in large-format structures that were to leave a mark on towns and cities. One example is Luxembourg, where building works between 1543 and 1867 turned it into one of the strongest fortresses in Europe (Fig. 2.3). One of those who worked on extending Luxembourg’s fortiﬁcations was Vauban (Fig. 2.4), who in 1678 had been appointed Commissary General of all French fortiﬁcations by Louis XIV and who was in charge of the conquest of the city in 1684. However, Luxembourg is only one small part in the output of\n\n5\n\n6\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\nFig. 2.3 Historical map of Luxembourg by First Lieutenant Cederstolpe showing the city’s fortiﬁcations, c. 1845 (Reinert & Bruns, 2013, p. 48).\n\nFig. 2.4 Sebastien le Prestre de Vauban (1633-1707); copy by Antoine Coysevox of the marble bust (since lost) produced by Pietro Marchetti by order of Napoleon I (Neumann, Hartwig, 1984, p. 379).\n\n2.1 Retaining walls for fortiﬁcations\n\nthis “Ingénieur de France”, as he was called during his lifetime. As is written in the Larousse universel of 1923: “Towards the end of his life, Vauban – who Saint-Simon (1760-1825) described as one of the most virtuous men of his century – published his Projet d’une dixme royale [project for a royal tithe] in which, driven by a genuine philanthropic feeling, he called for fair taxes, which resulted in him falling out of favour with Louis XIV” (cited after (Göggel, 2011, p. 136)). In just a few decades, Vauban built 33 new fortiﬁcations and rebuilt about 300; so far, 411 construction measures at 160 locations have been proved to be his work (Neumann, Hartwig, 1984, p. 381). Vauban’s fortiﬁcation and civil works involved about nine million cubic metres of masonry (Petzsch, 2011, p. 191). According to his own ﬁgures, Vauban used more than 3.7 million cubic metres of masonry for retaining walls supporting the ramparts with their bastions at the corners of the star-shaped fortiﬁcations and the intermediate masonry walls, the curtain walls, (see (Poncelet, 1844, p. 67)), which corresponds to 41% of the total amount of masonry built. As early as 1684, Vauban published design tables for retaining walls with heights of 3 m < H < 25 m (Kérisel, 1985, p. 55). Three years later, Vauban, in his role as newly appointed Commissary General of all French fortiﬁcations, sent his engineers in the Corps du Génie Militaire his Proﬁl général pour les murs de soutènement in which he presented his retaining wall proﬁles that were later adopted by engineering oﬀers such as Bélidor (1729), Poncelet (1840) and Wheeler (1870) (see (Feld, 1928, p. 64ﬀ.)). This “universal Vauban proﬁle” (Poncelet, 1844, p. 4) was investigated by Poncelet, who compared this “main principle of Vauban’s rules” (Poncelet, 1844, p. 68ﬀ.) with the results of his earth pressure theory. Fig. 2.5, which shows the retaining walls for the fortiﬁcations at Ypres, conveys an impression of the Vauban proﬁle, which Vauban drew in an entry in his diary for 1698 (see (Kérisel, 1985, p. 86)). The trapezoidal form of the retaining wall on the right of bastion 63 for the Ypres fortiﬁcations has the following dimensions: height H = 11.38 m, width at base b = 3.52 m, width at top\n\nFig. 2.5 Retaining wall with buttresses for the fortiﬁcations at Ypres designed by Vauban in 1699, after a drawing by A. de Caligny (Poncelet, 1844, plate IV, Fig. 35).\n\n7\n\n8\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\nk = 1.62 m, batter of wall on air side m = (3.52-1.62)/11.38 = 1:6, average depth of soil covering to top of masonry h′ = 0.5⋅(2.11+1.35) = 1.75 m. The retaining wall is stiﬀened by buttresses 16.90 m high every 4.87 m, which themselves have a trapezoidal cross-section with depth h = 3.25 m, width at base bu = 2.60 m and width at top bo = 1.30 m. The buttresses increase the stability enormously. In a 1953 essay on the history of soil mechanics in France, Kérisel mentions a paper by M. Chauvelot which was presented to the Paris-based Académie des Sciences by Gaspard Monge (1746-1818) and Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde (1735-1796) in 1783 and contains examples (with ﬁgures) for Vauban’s design principles. For a retaining wall with buttresses at a spacing of 5.75 m and a batter m = 1:5 on the air side, he gives the following formula for the width of the base of the retaining wall: 1 ⋅ H + 1.48 (2.1) 5 Of course, Vauban based his formula of 1684 on the units of length used at that time, the toise (1 T = 1.95 m) and the pied (1 p = 0.325 m), which, when converted to the metric system, results in the Vauban formula of eq. (2.1) (see (Kérisel, 1985, p. 55)). In eq. (2.1), H is the depth of the earth backﬁll and k Vauban,1:5 the width of the top of the retaining wall. Kérisel also published the table speciﬁed by Chauvelot (Kérisel, 1953, p. 153). Eq. (2.1) can be easily ﬁtted to the retaining wall shown in Fig. 2.5: bVauban,1∶5 = m ⋅ H + kVauban,1∶5 =\n\n1 ⋅ H + 1.625 6 which with H = 11.38 m results, according to eq. (2.2), in a base width of bVauban,1∶6 = m ⋅ H + kVauban,1∶6 =\n\n(2.2)\n\n1 ⋅ 11.38 + 1.625 = 1.90 + 1.625 = 3.52 m. 6 In the case of retaining walls with soil surcharge (see Fig. 2.6) and small buttresses, Vauban apparently proposed this formula: bVauban,1∶6 =\n\n1 ⋅ H + 1.625 (2.3) 5 (see (Feld, 1928, p. 64)); again, this equation (like equations 2.1 and 2.2) has been converted to metric. In Fig. 2.6, h′ = C-G stands for the averaged depth of soil surcharge, H = C-B the height of the retaining wall, or soil backﬁll, bVauban,surcharge = A-B the width at the base and A-C = 1.625 m the width at the top. According to Audoy, Vauban based his retaining wall proﬁles on a factor of safety against overturning 𝜈 K,Vauban = 3.8 and a factor of safety against sliding 𝜈 G,Vauban = 4.7 (see (Feld, 1928, p. 65)). However, estimating the stability of Vauban’s retaining wall (Fig. 2.5) according to the calculations in (Kurrer, 2018, pp. 55-58) and using the same soil mechanics parameters results in much lower factors of safety than those given by Audoy: at the base of the wall there is an overturning safety factor 𝜈 K = 2.3, which is > 𝜈 permiss = 1.5, and the sliding safety factor 𝜈 G is nearly 1.6, again > 𝜈 permiss = 1.5. If the buttresses are left out of the equation, the stability of the retaining wall against overturning is 𝜈 K = 1.2 and sliding 𝜈 G = 1.07, which are both just on the safe side. bVauban,surcharge =\n\n2.2 Earth pressure theory as an object of military engineering\n\nFig. 2.6 Designations for retaining walls with soil surcharge after Poncelet (Poncelet, 1844, plate I, Fig. 1).\n\nAccording to that, Vauban’s retaining walls with their trapezoidal proﬁle and buttresses cannot be further optimised structurally. Even Poncelet therefore assumed that Vauban’s dimensioning rules – e.g. eqs. (2.1) to (2.3) – handed down to us do not represent empirical rules, instead can be attributed to “an exact geometric theory” (Poncelet, 1844, p. 4). Therefore, the Vauban proﬁles provided the structural/constructional reference for more than 150 years. And it was against this that earth pressure theories had to measure their modelling quality and practicability.\n\n2.2 Earth pressure theory as an object of military engineering More than 2,000 years ago, Vitruvius – for many years responsible for the building of military engines in the armies of Caesar and Augustus – investigated the phenomenon of earth pressure and how to deal with it in structural and constructional terms. In chapter V, “The City Walls”, in Book I of his Ten Books on Architecture, Vitruvius writes about the walls between the towers, which require a “comb-like arrangement” of buttresses between them which are ﬁlled with earth (Fig. 2.7): “With this form of construction, the enormous burden of earth will be Fig. 2.7 Horizontal section through fortiﬁcations after Vitruvius (Vitruvius, 1981, Fig. 6).\n\nDitch Outer wall 1 2\n\n2\n\n1 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nInner wall 1 = Earth fill\n\n2 = Cross-wall\n\n2\n\n9\n\n10\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\ndistributed into small bodies, and will not lie with all its weight in one crushing mass so as to thrust out the substructures” (Vitruvius, 1981, p. 59). In chapter VIII “On Foundations and Substructures” in Book VI, Vitruvius describes earth pressure not only in qualitative terms, but also tells us how to calculate the earth pressure for the retaining walls of Fig. 2.7: “Particular pains, too, must be taken with substructures, for here an endless amount of harm is usually done by the earth used as ﬁlling. This [earth ﬁll] cannot always remain of the same weight that it usually has in summer, but in winter time it increases in weight and bulk by taking up a great deal of rain water, and then it bursts its enclosing walls and thrusts them out ... The following means must be taken to provide against such a defect. First, let the walls be given a thickness proportionate to the amount of ﬁlling” (Vitruvius, 1981, p. 297). Vitruvius then proposes rules for dimensioning the system of retaining walls and explains that “to meet the mass of earth, there should be saw-shaped constructions attached to the wall” and “with this arrangement, the teeth and diagonal structures will not allow the ﬁlling to thrust with all its force against the wall, but will check and distribute the pressure” (Vitruvius, 1981, p. 299). These quotes are the oldest known references to the nature and eﬀect of earth pressure. Like those involved with building had condensed the nature of masonry arch thrust into structural and constructional knowledge in the form of a structural theory in a lengthy historical process through their observations, own experiences during construction and many years of checking structures in use, so the knowledge of the phenomenon of earth pressure at the end of the 17th century culminated in Vauban’s design theory for retaining walls. The beginnings of the changeover from empiricism to theory took place in masonry arches (see section 4.3.1) as it did in earthworks under the auspices of the Académie Royale d’Architecture de Paris (Kurrer, 2018, p. 212). Whereas La Hire proposed that the règles de l’art for the masonry arch problem be based on classical mechanics, Pierre Bullet (1639-1716) was the ﬁrst (in 1691) to attempt to model physically and quantify earth pressure on retaining walls (Bullet, 1691, pp. 159-177). Both La Hire and Bullet were committed to the rationalism of René Descartes. It is therefore the classical rationalism of Descartes and Leibniz that formed their scientiﬁc theory and epistemological sounding board at the transition from the orientation phase (1575-1700) to the application phase (1700-1775) of theory of structures (Kurrer, 2018, pp. 15-16). The inductive structural theory ideas of Leonardo da Vinci and other engineers of the Renaissance was to be replaced by the deductive method (Polónyi, 1982), which to date shapes the way that this fundamental engineering science discipline sees itself. The diﬀerence between masonry arch theory and earth pressure theory in the application phase right up to the end of the constitution phase (1825-1850) of theory of structures (Kurrer, 2018, pp. 19-20) is that earth pressure theory is not the work of civil engineers, but essentially military engineers. 2.2.1\n\nIn the beginning there was the inclined plane\n\nThe ﬁrst earth pressure theories were based on the model of the inclined plane (Fig. 2.8), which Stevin had cleverly used as long as go as 1586 for his equilibrium\n\n2.2 Earth pressure theory as an object of military engineering\n\nFig. 2.8 Determining the earth pressure according to the fundamental model of the inclined plane.\n\nk\n\nX Terrain line\n\nH\n\nWall line\n\na\n\nSρ +\n\nR=μ.N\n\nG\n\nφ=ρ m\n\nn ine\n\nN\n\nel\n\nop\n\nSl\n\nT\n\nd b\n\nobservations (Kurrer, 2018, pp. 29-30). The starting point for these studies was the observation that when loose cohesionless materials are tipped out, they form a conical pile, the slant line of which forms a natural slope and the angle of the slope line with respect to the horizontal φ corresponds to the angle of internal friction 𝜌 of this soil type. If further material is tipped out on top of this, it rolls downwards and in this case a retaining wall must be built upwards from point d to resist the descending material. This resistance was interpreted as earth pressure. In the standard model of the ﬁrst earth pressure theories, the wedge of soil bounded by slope line d-n, wall line d-a and terrain line a-n was considered as a rigid body with weight G which slides without friction parallel with the slope line. The components of G acting perpendicular N and parallel T to the slope line can be determined from the similarity between triangle d-a-n and the triangle of forces (Fig. 2.8): x x N = ⇒N=G⋅ = G ⋅ cos φ (2.4) G dn dn H H T = ⇒T=G⋅ = G ⋅ sin φ (2.5) G dn dn The force T acting parallel with the slope according to eq. (2.5) functions as earth pressure E on the retaining wall. If, however, the slope line is aﬀected by friction, then the earth pressure is reduced to E = T − R.\n\n(2.6)\n\nIn his Mémoire de l’Académie Royale of 19 December 1699, which described the design of waterwheels, Guillaume Amontons (1663-1705) realised that the friction force R is proportional to the normal force N and independent of the contact area. He assumed a value 1/3 for the proportionality factor 𝜇 (Amontons, 1699/1718). The fundamental model of the inclined plane modiﬁed to include friction force R E = T − R = G ⋅ sin φ − μ ⋅ N = G ⋅ (sin φ − μ ⋅ cos φ)\n\n(2.7)\n\nfor earth pressure was already in use for ﬁnding dimensions for retaining walls in the ﬁrst half of the 18th century by way of diverse simpliﬁcations. These earth pressure theory approaches diﬀer in the ﬁrst place in the ﬁgures assumed for the slope angle φ = 𝜌, the magnitude of the friction force and the deﬁnition of the point of application of E.\n\n11\n\n12\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\nBullet\n\nBullet modelled the cohesionless soil material, e.g. sand, as a regular pile with small, spherical particles with a theoretical slope angle φ = 60∘ (Fig. 2.9). For reasons of safety, his further studies were based on a slope angle φ = 45∘ (Fig. 2.10). In the next step, Bullet determined the force at the inclined plane that prevents a particle of weight G′ from rolling downwards: √ 2 5 ′ (2.8) ⋅ G′ ≈ ⋅ G′ . E = 2 7 Of course, this relationship also applies to the entire earth pressure wedge with weight G (see Fig. 2.8): √ 2 5 5 (2.9) EBullet = ⋅ G ≈ ⋅ G = ⋅ 0.5 ⋅ γE ⋅ H2 = 0.35 ⋅ γE ⋅ H2 2 7 7 Eq. (2.9) can also be found from eq. (2.5) with φ = 𝜌 = 45∘ . As an example, Bullet now calculated the area of the earth pressure wedge with leg lengths x = 6 toisen as AG = 0.5⋅6⋅6 = 18 square toisen. As G is proportional to EBullet , then according to eq. (2.9), AE = (5/7)⋅18 = 13 square toisen is valid for the “area of earth pressure”. Where the earth and the masonry of the retaining wall have the same unit weight 𝛾 E = 𝛾 MW , Bullet can determine the wall’s dimensions from the area AE assumed by him to be equal to the cross-sectional area of the retaining wall AS . Consequently, the width of the base of the retaining wall can be calculated from 5 (2.10) bBullet = ⋅ H − k 7 where H is the height and k the width of the top of the retaining wall. Here, for H = 6 toisen (= 6⋅1.95 = 11.7 m) and k = 10/6 toisen (= 3.25 m), bBullet takes on a value of about 110/42 ≈ 16/6 = 2.66 toisen (= 5.20 m) (Fig. 2.11).\n\nφ = 60°\n\nFig. 2.9 Natural slope of small spherical grains of sand after Bullet (redrawn and modiﬁed after (Bullet, 1691, p. 171)).\n\nFig. 2.10 Earth pressure determination after Bullet (Bullet, 1691, p. 172).\n\n2.2 Earth pressure theory as an object of military engineering\n\nFig. 2.11 Retaining wall design according to Bullet (Bullet, 1691, p. 173).\n\nWhen determining the width of the base of a retaining wall, according to Emil Winkler (1835-1888), Bullet divided the “area of the earth pressure” AE by the height H (Winkler, 1872, p. 59): bBullet,Winkler =\n\n1 1 5 1 5 H2 5 ⋅ AE = ⋅ ⋅ AS = ⋅ ⋅ = ⋅ H ≈ 0.35 ⋅ H H H 7 H 7 2 14 (2.11)\n\nIf H = 6 toisen is entered into eq. (2.11), then, according to Winkler, Bullet would have obtained a value of 2.14 toisen for the width of the base. Feld, too, speciﬁes the same formula as Winkler (Feld, 1928, p. 65). From this it follows that both Winkler and Feld have either misunderstood these parts of Bullet’s work or their misunderstanding is down to having adopted secondary sources without criticism. Obtaining the dimensions of retaining walls using Bullet’s method owes more to geometry than it does to statics, because he is only interested in the magnitude of the vectors of the earth pressure with the weight of the retaining wall and does not consider their point of application or direction at all. Gautier\n\nHubert Gautier (1660-1737) worked with Vauban and was set to make his mark on French engineering in the early days of the Corps des Ingénieurs des Ponts et Chaussées, which was founded in 1716. Gautier became known for his monographs on roadbuilding (1693) and bridge-building (1716), which progressed to become the number one textbooks for modern civil engineering and remained so for a number of decades. He was an inspector of roads and bridges from 1713 to 1731 and therefore was also involved in solving earthworks problems such as those that occur when laying out routes for roads. We have Gautier to thank\n\n13\n\n14\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\nfor the ﬁrst ﬁgures regarding the most important soil parameters. He measured a unit weight of 18.1 kN/m3 and a slope angle of 31∘ for dry, clean sand; the corresponding values for customary, loosened earth ﬁll were, according to Gautier, 13.4 kN/m3 and 45∘ (Gautier, 1717, pp. 37-51). Although Gautier based his dimensions for retaining walls on geometric rules or rules of proportion, his measurement of these two soil parameters laid the foundation for the evolution of a theory of earth pressure. Couplet\n\nIn his ﬁrst Mémoire de l’Académie Royale on earth pressure, Couplet criticised Bullet’s assumptions (Couplet, 1726/1728): • The assumed slope angle of 60∘ is incorrect (see Fig. 2.9). • The pile of spherical particles is not two-dimensional (see Fig. 2.9), but three-dimensional (see Fig. 2.12). • The slope line d-n cannot be understood as an inclined plane down which the wedge of soil a-d-n slides (see Fig. 2.8). • The factor 5/7 in Bullet’s earth pressure equation (2.9) is incorrect because earth pressure E does not act horizontally. Couplet assumed a conﬁguration of frictionless spherical particles in the shape of a tetrahedron (Fig. 2.12), with every sphere making contact with three others and transferring to those three the compressive forces acting perpendicular to the areas of contact. From this, Couplet initially derived a ﬁctitious slope line L-K (Fig. 2.13). So, the sphere on the outside does not roll down C-B, but down L-K. Couplet showed further that his frictionless theory requires a constant horizontal pressure acting on the smooth wall line which is independent of the slope line angle and√proportional to 0.5⋅H 2 . Taking the elementary tetrahedron with side length 2⋅ 3 and triangle A-I-D (Fig. 2.12), Couplet found that √ the ratio of earth pressure E to the weight of the sliding wedge of soil G was 2: 8, i.e. the triangle\n\nFig. 2.12 Pile of spherical particles in the form of a tetrahedron after Couplet (Couplet, 1726/1728, plate 4, Figs. 10 & 11).\n\n2.2 Earth pressure theory as an object of military engineering\n\nFig. 2.13 Fictitious slope line after Couplet (Couplet, 1726/1728, plate 4, Fig. 7).\n\nof forces due to soil prism and earth pressure is similar to triangle A-I-D. From this we get the earth pressure γ (2.12) ECouplet,1726 = E ⋅ H2 = 0.125 ⋅ γE ⋅ H2 , 8 which Couplet applies in the upper third of the wall line. The hydrostatic earth pressure is Ehydrostatic = 0.5 ⋅ γE ⋅ H2\n\n(2.13)\n\nand would act in the lower third of the wall line. After Couplet has established moment equilibrium about point m for a retaining wall with a rectangular cross-section (b = k), he obtains the minimum base width using √ γE . (2.14) min bCouplet,1726 = H ⋅ 6 ⋅ γMW Couplet’s equation (2.14) results in the following ﬁgure for Bullet’s sample calculation (i.e. 𝛾 E = 𝛾 MW and H = 11.70 m): √ √ γE 1 min bCouplet,1726 = H ⋅ =H⋅ = 0.41 ⋅ H = 0.41 ⋅ 11.70 = 4.78m. 6 ⋅ γMW 6 (2.15) This value is about 8% less than the value bBullet = 5.20 m obtained with eq. (2.10). Further approaches\n\nIn the 18th century numerous authors adhered to the fundamental model of the frictionless inclined plane in order to determine earth pressure (see (Kötter, 1893, pp. 79-80)), and most of those were military engineers. The inﬂuential professor of mathematics at Göttingen, Abraham Gotthelf Kästner (1719-1800), was also a fan of this earth pressure theory (see (Woltmann, 1794, pp. 152-158)). Blaveau can be mentioned as another example of this type of theory. In his Mémoire de l’Académie Royale of 1767, he broke down the force acting parallel with the slope into vertical and horizontal components (Fig. 2.14) and interpreted the latter as the earth pressure (see Winkler 1872, pp. 60-61): EBlaveau = G ⋅ sin φ ⋅ cos φ = 0.5 ⋅ H ⋅ x ⋅ γE ⋅ sin φ ⋅ cos φ = 0.5 ⋅ H2 ⋅ γE ⋅ cos2 φ (2.16)\n\n15\n\n16\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\nFig. 2.14 Earth pressure calculation after Blaveau.\n\nThe following relationship is obtained for the special case of φ = 𝜌 = 45∘ : √ 2 (2.17) EBlaveau = ⋅ H2 ⋅ γE = 0.35 ⋅ γE ⋅ H2 . 4 This earth pressure formula agrees with that of Bullet (eq. 2.9). Nevertheless, there were considerable diﬀerences between these two approaches when it came to the point of application of the earth pressure. According to Blaveau, the line of action of the force acting parallel with the slope passes through the centre of gravity S of the earth pressure wedge and intersects the wall line at p such that the earth pressure also passes through p, and for the special case of eq. (2.16), line p-d takes on the value H/3. Based on that, with moment equilibrium about point m, a retaining wall with a rectangular cross-section (b = k) would have a minimum base width of √ 𝛾E min bBlaveau,a = H ⋅ (2.18) 4.29 ⋅ 𝛾MW The stabilising eﬀect of the vertical component V of the force acting parallel with the slope is ignored here. If we again use 𝛾 E = 𝛾 MW and H = 11.70 m, then eq. (2.18) results in √ √ 𝛾E 1 min bBlaveau,a = H ⋅ =H⋅ 4.29 ⋅ 𝛾MW 4.29 = 0.48 ⋅ H = 0.48 ⋅ 11.70 = 5.65 m. (2.19) If instead the stabilising eﬀect of V is considered, then using the above ﬁgures, the result is min bBlaveau,b = 0.25 ⋅ H = 0.25 ⋅ 11.70 = 2.88 m.\n\n(2.20)\n\nThe latter is only possible where the coeﬃcient of friction of the wall line 𝜇 = tan𝜌 = tanφ = tan45∘ = 1, because then, and only then, is the stabilising eﬀect of V fully valid. Therefore, the wall friction angle 𝛿 should be taken as zero. However, that would result in having to assume a minimum base width of 5.65 m – a value that is much higher than the ﬁgures calculated by Bullet and Couplet (5.20 m and 4.78 m respectively). So, in the end, Blaveau’s\n\n2.2 Earth pressure theory as an object of military engineering\n\nearth pressure calculation leads to uneconomic cross-sections for retaining walls. Much more serious, however, is the objection that Blaveau’s forces breakdown is arbitrary, because the force acting parallel with the slope line must mobilise the opposing friction force R (see Fig. 2.8), provided the slope line is identical with the slip plane. The question now was: By what amount R can the earth pressure according to eq. (2.6) or (2.7) been reduced? Couplet and Bélidor tried to answer this question by incorporating friction into the fundamental model of the inclined plane for determining earth pressure. Friction reduces earth pressure\n\nCouplet’s second Mémoire de l’Académie Royale on earth pressure included the friction between the soil material and the wall line (Couplet, 1727/1729): “As the facings [= retaining wall – the author] are made up of stones or bricks, lime and sand, which never produce smooth surfaces, it is thus necessary to investigate the magnitude of the pressure of the earth on these sandy and uneven surfaces, and to arrange the facings in such a way that they are able to withstand this pressure” (Couplet, 1795, p. 89). In terms of method, Couplet kept to his ﬁrst Mémoire on earth pressure. Using the tetrahedron-shaped pile of particles (see Fig. 2.12) and a particle conﬁguration in the shape of a semi-octahedron, Couplet derived the earth pressure acting obliquely downwards. He then obtained the minimum base width minbCouplet,1727 from moment equilibrium about point m (see Fig. 2.8), which led to a cubic equation. Couplet presented the results of his calculations for the inclinations of the slope line... • side face of tetrahedron: inclination of A-K (see Fig. 2.12), • edge of tetrahedron: inclination of A-D (see Fig. 2.12), and • side face of semi-octahedron (similar to height A-K of side surface ABC in Fig. 2.12) in three tables from which it is possible to obtain the minimum base width b for height H and top of wall width k (Couplet, 1795, pp. 124-126). Couplet’s design tables are based on a unit weight ratio 𝛾 E :𝛾 MW = 2:3. For example, table I with the inclination of the side face A-K as slope line for the minimum base width is based on the relationship min bCouplet,1727 = 0.11 ⋅ H (Couplet, 1795, p. 124). According to eq. (2.14), that would result in √ √ γE H 2 min bCouplet,1726 = H ⋅ =H⋅ = 6 ⋅ γMW 6⋅3 3\n\n(2.21)\n\n(2.22)\n\nfor the frictionless case. Responding to the low value of the minimum base width given by eq. (2.21), Jacob Feld wrote: “The reason for the extremely low value is that Couplet has actually assumed it to be just as easy to shear the wall in the direction of the plane of rupture as to overturn it. This is not acceptable, for the weakest shear section of a wall is horizontal. This is especially true of the walls of Couplet’s time, built with masonry or brick laid in horizontal layers” (Feld, 1928,\n\n17\n\n18\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\np. 67). Couplet’s earth pressure theory did not enjoy widespread use because of the small minimum base widths it gave, which were well below those of Vauban’s design theory. Couplet’s earth pressure theory based on the fundamental model of granular media would have only little inﬂuence on the formation of further theories and would only slowly take shape in programs based on the theory of granular media for earthworks within the scope of the discrete element method (DEM) (Cundall & Strack, 1979) at the start of the integration period of geotechnical engineering (1975 to date). What Couplet’s earth pressure theory did achieve was bring about the knowledge that “the pressure at the slope line is not perpendicular to the latter, that tangential resistance forces [= friction force R in direction of slope line – the author] also apply at the slope line” (Kötter, 1893, p. 82). In the end, the complicated construction of Couplet’s earth pressure theory hampered its use in practical engineering. The ﬁrst earth pressure theory for everyday engineering can be found in Bélidor’s La Science des Ingénieurs (1729). Like Bullet, Bélidor assumed a slope line inclined at φ = 45∘ . He divided the earth prism into a large number of thin slices parallel with the slope line (Fig. 2.15). In the case of frictionless slices and φ = 45∘ , the horizontal component of the earth pressure acting on wall line dE for the slice under consideration must be equal to the weight of this slice dG (Fig. 2.16). Bélidor now introduced friction into the equation.\n\nFig. 2.15 Stability investigation for a retaining wall after Bélidor (Bélidor, 1813, plate 2, Fig. 4).\n\n2.2 Earth pressure theory as an object of military engineering\n\nFig. 2.16 Generalisation of earth pressure determination after Bélidor.\n\nk\n\ndξ a\n\nn\n\nH\n\ndz\n\nIz\n\ndG\n\nφ\n\ndN\n\nz\n\ndE = e φ m\n\nd b\n\nHe stipulated that the friction on the slope line halves the earth pressure resulting from the frictionless inclined plane: dEBelidor = 0.5 ⋅ dE ́\n\n(2.23)\n\nThe earth pressure for an arbitrary slope angle φ is determined below.

The speciﬁc earth pressure according to eq. (2.27) is not dependent on the slope angle φ or a linear function via the ordinate z of the wall line between e(z = 0) = 𝛾 E ⋅H and e(z = H) = 0.

(2.14). However, this concordance is coincidental, because compared with Bélidor, Couplet only applies half the earth pressure according to eq. (2.12) at level z = (2/3)⋅H, whereas the earth pressure according to Bélidor acts on the wall line at z = (1/3)⋅H. Bélidor’s contribution to earth pressure theory is a methodology consisting of his slices method with which even practical cases such as polygonal terrain lines (see Fig. 2.15) can be analysed as well. Bélidor produced earth pressure tables for H = 3.25 to 32.50 m for use by practising engineers; in those tables the minimum base widths vary between minb(H = 3.25 m) = 0.37⋅H and minb(H = 32.50 m) = 0.355⋅H (Bélidor, 1813, p. 59). The slices method adopted from diﬀerential and integral calculus enables every ordinate of the speciﬁc earth pressure and its contribution to the active moment about point m to be determined and, in the end, the minimum base width to be quantiﬁed based on the equilibrium with the restoring moment. 2.2.2\n\nFrom inclined plane to wedge theory\n\nThe fundamental model of the inclined plane gives us the earth pressure that acts parallel with the slope line, i.e. totally independent of the properties of the wall line of the retaining wall. By modelling the earth prism, a-d-n as a wedge-shaped rigid body whose weight G acts without friction on the slope line as N and on the wall line as E (Fig. 2.17), we know not only the magnitude, but also the direction of the earth pressure E. The model of the frictionless wedge had already been used by La Hire in his masonry arch theory (see Fig. 4-19 in (Kurrer, 2018, p. 213)). For earth pressure, this model leads to the hydrostatic earth pressure E = Ehydrostatic according to eq. (2.13) or eq. (2.28), which is independent of the slope angle φ and is equal to the pressure exerted by a ﬂuid with the same unit weight as the soil. Von Clasen was just one of the many proponents of this theory in the 18th century (v. Clasen, 1781a). As in masonry arch theory, where the model of the frictionless wedge was soon superseded by the model of the wedge aﬀected by friction, this process also gave way to a more complex model in earth pressure theory as well. It was Reinhard Woltman (1757-1837), a waterways engineer based in northern Germany, who\n\n2.2 Earth pressure theory as an object of military engineering\n\nﬁrst assumed the model of the inclined plane with friction and discussed this as an alternative to the model of the wedge with friction. Volumes III and IV of his four-volume work Beyträge zur Hydraulischen Architectur (writings on hydraulic architecture) deal with quantifying earth pressure experimentally and theoretically. Of course, he noted that the friction force R reduces the force acting parallel with the slope T according to eq. (2.7) (Woltman, 1794, p. 165). Fig. 2.18 illustrates Woltman’s method I for determining earth pressure. After he has broken down the weight of the earth prism G in the direction (T) of the slip plane at an angle φ and orthogonal (N) to it, he employs eq. (2.7) to subtract the friction force R from the force acting parallel with the slope T and determines the horizontal component of this diﬀerential force as the earth pressure EW,I (φ) = (T − R) ⋅ cos φ = G ⋅ cos φ ⋅ (sin φ − μ ⋅ cos φ).\n\n(2.31)\n\nHe determines the unknown inclination of the slip plane φ from the condition that the earth pressure according to eq. (2.31) is a maximum dEW,I (φ) dφ\n\n=0\n\n(2.32)\n\nand substitutes φ = 𝜗 into eq. (2.31): EW,I (φ = ϑW,I ) = G ⋅ cos ϑW,I ⋅ (sin ϑW,I − μ ⋅ cos ϑW,I ).\n\n(2.33)\n\nUnfortunately, the necessary condition for the extreme value of eq. (2.32) leads to a trigonometric equation for calculating the angle of the slip plane 𝜗W,I , which has no closed-form solution. Writing about method I, Woltman notes that “this ﬁrst calculation only deals with the relationship of the forces taking into account their horizontal direction but not their whole magnitude or complete equilibrium” (Woltman, 1799, p. 299). Woltman’s method II overcomes this shortcoming, assumes that the equilibrium at the wedge with friction is taken into account (Fig. 2.19) and determines the earth pressure, which he calls “the conserving force in the horizontal direction ... for the case of equilibrium” (Woltman, 1799, p. 299). Applying equilibrium of forces at the as yet unknown slip plane T(φ) = TE (φ) + R(φ)\n\n(2.34)\n\nFig. 2.18 Determining earth pressure according to Woltman’s method I – the inclined plane with friction (see (Woltman, 1799, p. 298)).\n\nk\n\nx a\n\nn S\n\nH\n\n+\n\nG φ\n\nN T–R\n\nT V φ m\n\nd b\n\nR\n\nE\n\n21\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\nk\n\nx a\n\nn S G φ\n\nE φ\n\nN –NE T\n\nNE T E m\n\nFig. 2.19 Determining earth pressure according to Woltman’s method II – the wedge with friction (see (Woltman, 1799, p. 299)).\n\n–N\n\n+\n\nH\n\n22\n\nφ NE d\n\nφ\n\nE R TE\n\nb\n\nWoltman uses the relationships T(φ) = G ⋅ sin φ TE (φ) = E ⋅ cos φ R(φ) = [N(φ) + NE (φ)] ⋅ μ = [G ⋅ cos φ + E ⋅ sin φ] ⋅ μ\n\n(2.35)\n\nto obtain the earth pressure according to Coulomb (see (Coulomb, 1773/1776)) EW,II (φ) = EC (φ) = G ⋅\n\n(sin φ − μ ⋅ cos φ) .

(2.36): EW,II = EC = E = G ⋅\n\n(sin ϑ − μ ⋅ cos ϑ) (cos ϑ + μ ⋅ sin ϑ)\n\n(2.38)\n\nThe earth pressure E, the weight G of the wedge of soil with angle a-d-n = 90∘ – 𝜗, the forces T E and R acting at the slip plane and the normal forces –N E and –N acting orthogonal to the slip plane therefore form a system in equilibrium. However, this system of forces acting on wedge a-d-n only represents a special case of the wedge aﬀected by friction because the friction between the wedge of soil and the retaining wall was neglected by Coulomb and Woltman. Using the relationship μ = tan ρ\n\n(2.39)\n\nintroduced by Woltman for the relationship between coeﬃcient of friction 𝜇 and angle of internal friction 𝜌 (Woltman, 1794, p. 165), it is possible to prove that eqs. 2-14 (Kurrer, 2018, p. 53) and 2.38 agree for the special case of wall friction angle 𝛿 = 0∘ and vertical wall line 𝛼 = 0∘ . But here, Woltmann took the angle of internal friction 𝜌 to be identical with the slope angle of the soil material – an assumption that only applies to cohesionless soils such as dry sand and gravel, not to cohesive soils.\n\n2.2 Earth pressure theory as an object of military engineering\n\nAs can be seen from a comparison of eqs. (2.33) and (2.38), the following applies: EW,II = EC = E =\n\nEW,I (cos2 ϑ + μ ⋅ sin ϑ ⋅ cos ϑ)\n\n,\n\n(2.40)\n\ni.e. Woltman’s method II, or Coulomb’s method, always leads to larger earth pressure values, as the denominator of eq. (2.40) is (cos2 ϑ + μ ⋅ sin ϑ ⋅ cos ϑ) ≤ 1\n\n(2.41)\n\nand the values given by eqs. (2.33) and (2.38) are only identical for the special case of 𝜇 = tan𝜗. Woltman compared the two methods with earth pressure experiments and noted that “the results of the ﬁrst calculation [method I – the author] agree far better with the experiments than those of the second [method II – the author]” (Woltman, 1799, p. 301). Nevertheless, he recommended method II but wished to remain unbiased and left it to the mathematical sciences to determine which method should be preferred (see (Woltman, 1799, p. 302)). His reason – after much vacillation between methods I and II – for deciding to favour the latter was that “the ﬁrst type of calculation gives the pressure of the earth approximately 2/5 parts of the whole smaller than that of the second” (Woltman, 1799, p. 305). He appended critical remarks to this concerning the general reliability of tests. In these, Woltman refers to the inﬂuence of particle size and cohesion, neither of which were considered in the two methods. To conclude, Woltman shares a teleological principle that the mathematician C. L. Brünings had communicated to him in a letter which in turn relates to Euler’s treaties on the calculus of variations in elastic theory (Euler, 1744): “Experience teaches us that a certain amount of earth would slide down if the retaining wall did not hold it back. Further, all the sliding earth particles ... would reliably slide with the maximum velocity that their friction and cohesion allow, because the laws of nature always reach their goals by the shortest route. Therefore, the horizontal force that holds them back must also be a maximum” (Brünings, cited after (Woltman, 1799, p. 309)). Brünings’ reasoning implies that both Woltman’s method I and method II after Coulomb in the Woltman version are covered by his teleological principle. As the next section will show, Woltman’s formal application of the extreme value method of diﬀerential calculus is misleading in physical terms. Critical here is the physics on which the engineering science model of earth pressure determination is founded. The fundamental model of the wedge with friction proved its superiority at the turn of the 19th century and consigned the fundamental model of the inclined plane with friction to the historical stock of 18th-century earth pressure theories. 2.2.3\n\nCharles Augustin Coulomb\n\nCoulomb’s Mémoire on beam, earth pressure and masonry arch theories (Coulomb, 1773/1776) can be regarded as a bombshell in the initial phase of theory of structures (1775-1825) (Kurrer, 2018, pp. 17-18), with a far-reaching historico-logical eﬀect that can still be felt today in earth pressure calculations.\n\n23\n\n24\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\nHe wrote the Mémoire for his own use during his time spent as an engineer oﬃcer on the island of Martinique between 1764 and 1772: “This essay written several years ago was originally only intended for my own private use for works I had to carry out during my service” (Coulomb, 1779, p. 164). We can therefore assume that Coulomb had already formulated his beam, earth pressure and masonry arch theories by about 1770. His three-part Mémoire is divided into 18 sections preceded by a summarising introduction. The ﬁrst nine sections contain observations on the equilibrium of plane ﬁgures (Fig. 4 in Fig. 2.20) and friction, describing his own experiments to determine the tensile and bending strengths of stones (Fig. 1-3 in Fig. 2.20), exempliﬁed by the cantilever subjected to a point load at its end (Fig. 6 in Fig. 2.20) and the analysis of the strength of masonry piers with a quadratic cross-section (Fig. 5 in Fig. 2.20). In section IX, Coulomb rounds oﬀ the ﬁrst part of his Mémoire with his observations on the strength of masonry piers. The second part of his Mémoire begins with the continuation of section IX and thus represents, so to speak, a link between his strength analysis of masonry piers (Fig. 5 in Fig. 2.20) and earth pressure theory (Fig. 7 in Fig. 2.20). Section IX is crucial to understanding Coulomb’s approach to theory of structures. Whereas Coulomb develops his earth pressure theory in the second part, the third part of his Mémoire (sections XVI to XVIII) provides the solution to the masonry arch problem in the form of his voussoir rotation theory – already discussed in (Kurrer, 2018, pp. 222-223) in particular. The second part is not just the middle of his three-part Mémoire, it is also the heart of the content of the Mémoire because it is here, in earth pressure theory, that Coulomb manages to express his approach to theory of structures most clearly. Manifestations of adhesion\n\nUp until the beginning of the establishment phase of theory of structures (1850-1875) (Kurrer, 2018, pp. 20-21), strength of materials was based on ultimate load theory. All the failure phenomena of solid bodies were attributed to overcoming the constant force of attraction between two neighbouring particles, which was known as adhesion. Coulomb assumed that adhesion acts between two particles in a state of rest, that it is independent of external forces and exists until the molecular cohesion is disrupted, leading to failure of the body. Cohesion was the name he gave to the internal resistance acting perpendicular to the rupture surface; cohesion is identical with adhesion, proportional to the area of the rupture surface (Coulomb, 1773/1776, p. 348) and corresponds to the tensile strength. Coulomb carried out tests on stones and found that a body loaded parallel with the rupture surface deviates very little from the cohesion, which he equates to adhesion and, expressed in modern terms, corresponds to the shear strength. If, in addition, a compressive force acts on the body perpendicular to the hypothetical rupture surface, then according to Coulomb, the internal resistance is made up of the cohesion plus the frictional resistance. So, for both types of loading, adhesion is the internal resistance that has to be overcome in order to reach the failure state. Adhesion is therefore the sum of cohesion and friction. Coulomb’s assumption that the cohesion and the frictional resistance\n\n2.2 Earth pressure theory as an object of military engineering\n\nhave to be overcome simultaneously can be attributed to his observation that for certain types of stone, the compressive strength was about four times the tensile strength (Coulomb, 1773/1776, p. 355). Therefore, Coulomb had to add a further internal resistance to cohesion: friction. Failure behaviour of masonry piers\n\nCoulomb demonstrated the combination of cohesion and friction through his analysis of the failure of a masonry pier with a quadratic cross-section (Fig. 5\n\nFig. 2.20 Coulomb’s beam, earth pressure and masonry arch theories (Coulomb, 1773/1776, plate I).\n\n25\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\nFig. 2.21 Failure analysis of a masonry pier after Coulomb.\n\nP\n\nd\n\na φP\n\nNP TP\n\n90°–φP\n\nP\n\nXP\n\n26\n\nH 90°–φP n f\n\ne\n\nin Fig. 2.20). This failure analysis is crucial to understanding his earth pressure theory (see also (Freund, 1924, pp. 101-103) and (Gillmor, 1971, pp. 94-100)) – it is, so to speak, the prolegomenon of classical earth pressure theory. Coulomb assumed a concentrically loaded masonry pier with a quadratic cross-section and was looking for the inclination of the rupture surface d-n with the associated failure force P.

As Coulomb equated the tensile strength with the cohesion c, or shear strength 𝜏, it follows that the compressive failure load of the masonry pier was four times the tensile failure load. If friction is neglected, i.e. 𝜇 taken to be zero, then eq. (2.49) results in a plane of rupture angle 90∘ - φP = 45∘ and eq. (2.48) gives us a failure load P = 2⋅𝜏 fail ⋅H 2 ; Coulomb regarded this P value as too low. The plane of rupture angle according to eq. (2.49) does not depend on the cohesion c, or shear strength 𝜏 fail , of the masonry, “so from the theoretical viewpoint, precisely the uncertain part of the internal forces is solely crucial. In earth pressure theory, where the same result repeats later on, Coulomb draws attention to this. Here, though, the friction is, from the theoretical viewpoint, precisely the certain part of the internal forces, meaning that the result is less conspicuous within the scope of earth pressure theory” (Freund, 1924, p. 102). Albert Freund criticised Coulomb’s assumption of the cohesion and friction working together prior to failure, regarding it as inappropriate, because Coulomb ignored the diﬀerence between the tensile and compressive strengths of masonry units as an elementary physical fact and instead only took a statics/mathematical relationship as his basis. Freund concluded thus: “We now know what we should think of Coulomb’s premises regarding the theory of masonry piers, which at the same time are the premises of earth pressure theory” (Freund, 1924, p. 102). So, what is the connection between masonry pier theory and earth pressure theory? The transition to earth pressure theory\n\nFreund developed his hypothesis in four steps (Freund, 1924, pp. 102-103): 1. The starting point is Coulomb’s theory of structures model of the masonry pier according to Fig. 2.21. 2. Rotation of the masonry pier shown in Fig. 2.21 through 90∘ anticlockwise. 3. Taking account of the self-weight G of the downward-sliding masonry prism a-d-n. The masonry pier is represented by dotted lines in Fig. 2.22. Self-weight G acts perpendicular to P and is a function of angle φP . This theory of structures model of the masonry pier was now interpreted by Freund as a model of earth pressure (Fig. 2.22): Force P acting on earth wedge a-d-n tries to push\n\n27\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\nXP a\n\nn f 90°–φP\n\nP\n\nH\n\nG\n\nφP\n\ne\n\nd\n\nFig. 2.22 The third step in the transition from masonry pier theory to Coulomb’s earth pressure theory (redrawn after (Freund, 1924, Fig. 9)). x′′ x′ n′\n\na\n\nG′ G′′\n\nE = P′\n\nn′′\n\nFig. 2.23 The fourth step in the transition from masonry pier theory to Coulomb’s earth pressure theory (redrawn after (Freund, 1924, Fig. 10)).\n\nH\n\n28\n\nEp = P′′ φ′′ = ϑ′′ d φ′ = ϑ′\n\nsaid wedge upwards. So, force P acting on a-d-n is nothing more than the passive earth pressure EP . 4. The model shown in Fig. 2.23, which shows the active earth pressure E = P′ with the slip plane d′ -n′ at an angle φ′ = 𝜗′ and the passive earth pressure EP = P′′ with the inclined slip plane d-n′′ at an angle φ′′ = 𝜗′′ , completes the transition to Coulomb’s earth pressure theory. Fig. 2.23 shows that Coulomb distinguishes between two states of equilibrium. In the ﬁrst case earth wedge a-d-n′ slides downwards (active earth pressure E = P′ ); on the other hand, in the second case, force P is increased until it reaches the value P′′ and earth wedge a-d-n′′ moves upwards (passive earth pressure EP = P′′ ). In both cases, force P′ (or P′′ ) is in equilibrium with the self-weight of the earth wedge G′ (or G′′ ) and the resistance of the slip plane inclined at an angle 𝜗′ (or 𝜗′′ ), which Coulomb assembles from the cohesion force T c (eq. 2.43) and the frictional resistance R (eq. 2.45). Only the equilibrium conditions are diﬀerent. As in the case of active earth pressure the earth pressure wedge moves downwards, the sense of the frictional resistance is upwards from d to n′ . In the case\n\n2.2 Earth pressure theory as an object of military engineering\n\nof passive earth pressure, the earth wedge moves upwards, so the sense of the frictional resistance is downwards from n′′ to d. The lower P′ and upper P′′ limit values enclose a range within which all forces P acting horizontally on wall surface a-d must lie without disturbing the state of rest when cohesion and friction contribute simultaneously to maintaining the state of rest (see (Freund, 1924, p. 108)). The earth pressure at the state of rest, i.e. within P′ < P < P′′ , is called the earth pressure at rest Eo and, normally, cannot be determined: E < Eo < EP . Expressed mathematically, the passive earth pressure is the least upper bound, whereas the active earth pressure represents the greatest lower bound. According to Freund, Coulomb’s analysis of the masonry pier can be interpreted as the determination of the passive earth pressure P′′ = Ep , whereas his calculation of the active earth pressure P′ = E represents the innovation in his earth pressure theory (Freund, 1924, p. 103). Active earth pressure (see section 3.2)\n\nCoulomb begins the second part of section IX of his Mémoire by deriving the formula for active earth pressure for the case of an earth wedge with cohesion and friction acting at the slip plane d-n′ and a frictionless wall line d-a (Fig. 2.24). The designations in Fig. 2.24 are based on those of Fig. 2.23, but they do not match those used in Coulomb’s equations. The weight of the earth wedge G′ = G is broken down by Coulomb into a component in the direction of the slip plane d-n′ G⋅H |T| = √ (2.50) (H2 + x′2 ) and a component perpendicular to that G ⋅ x′ |N| = √ . (H2 + x′2 )\n\n(2.51)\n\nHe proceeds similarly with the active earth pressure P′ = E: E ⋅ x′ |TE | = √ (H2 + x′2 )\n\n(2.52)\n\nFig. 2.24 Determining the active earth pressure P′ = E after Coulomb.\n\nx′ x F a\n\nn′\n\nTE\n\nP′ = E\n\nT Tc + R\n\nφ = ϑ′ = ϑ d\n\nH\n\nN G′ = G NE\n\n29\n\n30\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\n|NE | = √\n\nE⋅H (H2 + x′2 )\n\n(2.53)\n\nD As the earth wedge moves downwards on slip plane d-n′ , so – according to Coulomb – an opposing friction force R and cohesion force T c are mobilised. He calculates the active earth pressure from the equilibrium of the forces in the direction of the slip plane (Coulomb, 1773/1776, p. 358) as follows: P′ = E = G ⋅\n\n(H − x′ ⋅ μ) (H2 + x′2 ) −c⋅ ′ . ′ (x + H ⋅ μ) (x + H ⋅ μ)\n\n(2.54)\n\nIn eq. (2.54), 𝜇 is the coeﬃcient of friction of the earth wedge on slip plane d-n′ (which Coulomb only refers to indirectly as quotient 1/n = 𝜇) and c is the cohesion, or shear strength 𝜏 E , of the soil material. Coulomb speciﬁes the equation E = (G + F) ⋅\n\n(H − x′ ⋅ μ) (H2 + x′2 ) − c ⋅ (x′ + H ⋅ μ) (x′ + H ⋅ μ)\n\n(2.55)\n\nfor the modiﬁed case with surcharge F (Coulomb, 1773/1776, p. 363). Taking the necessary condition for the extreme value of the earth pressure of an arbitrary earth wedge dE(x) =0 dx Coulomb is able to derive the equation √ x′ = H ⋅ [ (1 + μ2 ) − μ]\n\n(2.56)\n\n(Coulomb, 1773/1776, p. 360). He points out that the cohesion c has no inﬂuence on x′ (Coulomb, 1773/1776, p. 360). Prism of maximum pressure\n\nLater, Rebhann would point out that the earth pressure E obtained for the true (most unfavourable) slip plane inclined at an angle φ = 𝜗 is of course also valid for the other sectional planes at angles φ ≠ 𝜗 (Rebhann, 1870/1871, pp. 44-45). Purely theoretically, somewhat lower earth pressures would be obtained for these sectional planes, applying the full sliding resistance in each case, than would be the case for the actual slip plane (angle of inclination 𝜗). However, as the earth pressure cannot exhibit these diﬀerent values simultaneously, instead merely a single value E(𝜗), it follows that the sliding resistance at the other sectional planes (φ ≠ 𝜗) cannot be fully eﬀective. “The slip plane is, in the ﬁrst place, characterised by the fact that the resistance to sliding [= frictional resistance plus cohesion – the author] takes on a maximum value here. So, we get the ‘prism of maximum pressure’ as a subsidiary principle to Coulomb’s main principle” [Ohde, 1948-1952, p. 122]. This Coulomb main principle was introduced into the specialist literature in the German language by Martony de Köszegh, who called it the “Prisma des größten Druckes” (= prism of maximum pressure) (Martony de Köszegh, 1828, p. 10) – a mathematical mode of speaking that concealed the physical nature of earth pressure and which later created confusion and had to be clariﬁed by Kötter (Kötter, 1893, pp. 86-87).\n\n2.2 Earth pressure theory as an object of military engineering\n\nA current misinterpretation\n\nNorbert Giesler also geometrises the physical nature of earth pressure in his book, but rather idiosyncratically (Giesler, 2017, pp. 53-55), which in the end misleads him. Coulomb, with reference to Fig. 7 in Fig. 2.20, actually refers to the point of application and position of earth pressure E, denoting it A, as follows: “Si l’on suppose qu’un triangle CBa rectangle, solide & pesant, est soutenu sur la ligne Ba par une force A [= earth pressure E – the author] appliquée en F, perpendiculairement à la verticale CB” (Coulomb, 1773/1776, p. 357). So Coulomb allows the earth pressure E to be applied perpendicular to the wall line at point F. All the same, Coulomb very wisely does not use his deﬁnition to design retaining walls, as shown in section Design. Nevertheless, Giesler takes him by his word and establishes that in his comparative sample calculation using the prevailing theory, which, like masonry arch theory, assumes the middle-third rule (see (Kurrer, 2018, pp. 232-232)) – i.e. the point of application of E is taken to be H/3 measured from point d (see Fig. 2.24) –, the overturning moment turns out to be much smaller. This underdesign was Giesler’s reason for “working out a new way of calculating on the basis of classical earth pressure theory according to Coulomb” (Giesler, 2017, p. 40). Unfortunately, his new earth pressure theory lacks the physics foundation it claims to have. This begins with Giesler’s interpretation of the distribution of the speciﬁc earth pressure over the wall line as a “horizontal wedge of soil” (Giesler, 2017, p. 39). Giesler’s “horizontal wedge of soil” is a geometrical mirage that includes the basis of the physical earth pressure model of the prevailing theory in formal terms only, but in terms of physics misses its target. So Giesler’s new earth pressure theory joins the phalanx of unsuccessful approaches to ﬁnding the equilibrium between the prism of maximum pressure and the retaining wall. He forgets that the crucial point of Coulomb’s earth pressure theory is precisely that one limit state – which, in reality, does not have to occur – can be found mathematically from an inﬁnite number of possible states of equilibrium with the help of the extreme value calculation of diﬀerential calculus. This case, too, teaches us that studying the original sources is indispensable if we are to avoid one-sided interpretations. Earth pressure as a function of slip plane angle 𝝑\n\nIt is remarkable that Coulomb developed his earth pressure theory without trigonometric relationships. For example, eq. (2.56) with tan𝜗 = H/x′ is easily rewritten as eq. (2.49). Therefore, eq. (2.55) can also be expressed as a function of the slip plane angle 𝜗: E = (G + F) ⋅\n\n(sin ϑ − μ ⋅ cos ϑ) H −c⋅ (cos ϑ + μ ⋅ sin ϑ) sin ϑ ⋅ (cos ϑ + μ ⋅ sin ϑ)\n\n(2.57)\n\nFrom eq. (2.57) we can see that the cohesion of the body of soil reduces the active earth pressure and therefore Coulomb uses c = 0 for the backﬁll behind the retaining wall (Coulomb, 1773/1776, p. 364). If there is no surcharge F, then eq. (2.57) is rewritten in Woltmann’s notation for the active earth pressure after Coulomb for cohesionless soils, i.e. eq. (2.38).\n\n31\n\n32\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\nInﬂuence of wall friction\n\nFinally, Coulomb considers the friction between wall line d-a and the earth wedge and generalises eq. (2.54) as follows (Coulomb, 1773/1776, p. 364): ) (H − x′ ⋅ μ) ( (H2 + x′2 ) 1 ⋅ ′ −c⋅ ′ . (2.58) E= G−E⋅ v (x + H ⋅ μ) (x + H ⋅ μ) In eq. (2.58), 1/v is the coeﬃcient of friction between the retaining wall and the earth wedge 1/v = tan𝛿, where 𝛿 is the wall friction angle (see Fig. 2-41 in (Kurrer, 2018, p. 53)). This means that the earth pressure not only has a horizontal component, but a vertical one E⋅(1/v), too, acting at wall line d-a. In the next step, Coulomb solves eq. (2.58) for E and uses the extreme value condition to determine length x′ , which in turn can be written as a trigonometric expression of the slip plane angle. For the special case of c = 0 and 𝜇 = 1/v (coeﬃcient of friction earth-earth = wall-earth), Coulomb noted in his sample calculation that the minimum thickness of the retaining wall at the base was very much smaller “than those [thicknesses] that seem to have become established in practice” (Coulomb, 1779, p. 192), which is why he pleads for ignoring the wall friction angle, i.e. for assuming that the earth pressure is perpendicular to wall line d-a. A current generalisation\n\nAs in the past, the Coulomb earth pressure theory is used as the basis for calculating the active earth pressure. One example is the new edition of DIN 4085 “Subsoil – Calculation of earth pressure” published in 2017 (see chapter 17). DIN 4085 includes a formula for calculating the active earth pressure which generalises Coulomb’s earth pressure model for the case of • inclined wall and terrain lines, • vertical load, and • horizontal force. Of course, in this calculation the friction between the wall line and the body of soil and the cohesion along the slip plane are also taken into account. The horizontal force in DIN 4085 mentioned above represents the case of a horizontal ﬂow towards the wall (Hettler, 2017b, p. 465). Michael Goldscheider has published a seminal work on presenting hydrostatic pressures in the soil with ﬂowing groundwater and its application to earth pressure and ground failure calculations (Goldscheider, 2015), and the earth pressure formula of DIN 4085 is based on his proposals. Passive earth pressure (see section 3.3)\n\nFollowing on directly from the development of his formula for active earth pressure (eq. 2.54), Coulomb speciﬁes the passive earth pressure (Fig. 2.25) using P′′ = Ep = Gp ⋅\n\n(H + x′′ ⋅ μ) (H2 + x′′2 ) + c ⋅ (x′′ − H ⋅ μ) (x′′ − H ⋅ μ)\n\n(2.59)\n\nalbeit without deriving this formula (Coulomb, 1773/1776, p. 358). The retaining wall forces the earth wedge a-d-n′′ upwards in such a way that this mobilises a downward resistance force T c,p + Rp acting on slip plane d-n′′ .\n\n2.2 Earth pressure theory as an object of military engineering\n\nFig. 2.25 Determining the passive earth pressure P′′ = E p after Coulomb.\n\nx′′ x a\n\nn′′\n\nG′′ = Gp Np\n\nTc,p + Rp H\n\nP′′ = Ep NE,p\n\nTp TE,p\n\nφ = ϑ′′ = ϑp d\n\nIf the trigonometric relationship x′′ = H⋅cot𝜗p is substituted into eq. (2.59), then, following considerable transformation, we ﬁnally arrive at a formula for the passive earth pressure: Ep = Gp ⋅\n\n(sin ϑp + μ ⋅ cos ϑp ) (cos ϑp − μ ⋅ sin ϑp )\n\n+c⋅\n\nH . sin ϑp ⋅ (cos ϑp − μ ⋅ sin ϑp )\n\n(2.60)\n\nCoulomb did not pursue passive earth pressure any further, and this variable merely enabled him to limit the earth pressure at rest E < Eo < EP (Coulomb, 1773/1776, p. 358). Referring to Fig. 7 in Fig. 2.20, he noted: “It is therefore proved that in the case where cohesion and friction contribute to the state of rest, the limits of the force applied at F perpendicular to CB which does not set the triangle [= wedges of active or passive earth pressure – the author] in motion, lie between A [= value of active earth pressure E – the author] and A′ [= value of passive earth pressure Ep – the author]” (Coulomb, 1779, p. 182). Design\n\nBy substituting eq. (2.56) into eq. (2.54), Coulomb obtains the active earth pressure (Coulomb, 1773/1776, p. 360) E = γE ⋅ H2 ⋅ m(μ) − c ⋅ H ⋅ l(μ) with the parameters √ √ [ (1 + μ2 ) − μ] ⋅ {1 − μ ⋅ [ (1 + μ2 ) − μ]} m(μ) = √ 2 ⋅ (1 + μ2 ) and\n\n√ {1 + [ (1 + μ2 ) − μ]2 } l(μ) = . √ {μ + [ (1 + μ2 ) − μ]}\n\n(2.61)\n\n(2.62)\n\n(2.63)\n\nIn the next step, Coulomb considers the inﬁnitesimal element of the active earth pressure dE(z) dependent on the level z on the wall line (origin of coordinates at C) which acts on B-B′ (Fig. 7 in Fig. 2.20). If the height H is replaced by z in eq. (2.61) and the equation solved for z, then dE(z) = [γE ⋅ 2 ⋅ z ⋅ m(μ) − c ⋅ l(μ)] ⋅ dz.\n\n(2.64)\n\n33\n\n34\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\nThis inﬁnitesimal earth pressure dE(z) generates the moment dM = dE⋅(H-z) with respect to point E (Fig. 7 in Fig. 2.20) which integrated over level z results in the value z=H\n\nM=\n\n∫z=0\n\nH\n\n(H − z) ⋅ dE =\n\n∫0\n\n(H − z) ⋅ [γE ⋅ 2 ⋅ z ⋅ m(μ) − c ⋅ l(μ)] ⋅ dz\n\nH3 (2.65) − c ⋅ l(μ) ⋅ H2 3 (Coulomb, 1773/1776, p. 361). From moment equilibrium about E, it then follows that for a retaining wall of constant thickness (b = k) √ 2 ⋅ m(μ) c ⋅ l(μ) min bCoulomb = γE ⋅ ⋅ H2 − ⋅ H. (2.66) 3 ⋅ γMW γMW M = γE ⋅ m(μ) ⋅\n\nCoulomb speciﬁes eq. (2.66) for the special case of cohesionless soil (c = 0) only, with coeﬃcient of friction 𝜇 = 1 and 𝛾 E = 𝛾 MW : √ √ 2 ⋅ γE ⋅ 0.086 2 ⋅ m(μ) min bCoulomb = H ⋅ γE ⋅ =H⋅ 3 ⋅ γMW 3 ⋅ γMW √ γE min bCoulomb = 0.587 ⋅ H ⋅ = 0.24 ⋅ H (2.67) 6 ⋅ γMW (Coulomb, 1773/1776, p. 361). The minimum width of the base of the retaining wall according to Coulomb is therefore only 58.7% of that obtained by Bélidor using eq. (2.30). In the end, Coulomb recommends a width of 1 ⋅ H + 1.625, (2.68) 7 for trapezoidal retaining wall cross-sections with a batter of 1:6 on the air side, a width at the top k = 5⋅0.325 = 1.625 m, a height H = 11.38 m and factor of safety against overturning 𝜈 = 1.25. With H = 11.38 m, this results in b = 3.25 m – a value that lies a little below that given by the design rule of Vauban according to eq. (2.2). Coulomb explicitly highlights this good agreement with Vauban practice (Coulomb, 1773/1776, p. 362). b=\n\n2.2.4\n\nA magazine for engineering oﬃcers\n\nThe German translation of Coulomb’s beam, earth pressure and masonry arch theories by J. M. Geuß, professor of mathematics in Copenhagen, appeared in the ﬁfth volume of the Magazin für Ingenieur und Artilleristen (hereinafter referred to as Magazin) (Coulomb, 1779) three years after the theories were published in the Memoires of the Académie Royale des Sciences (Coulomb, 1773/1776). However, Geuß only translated the ﬁrst 28 pages of the 40-page Memoire (Coulomb, 1773/1776, pp. 343-370), omitting the last part on masonry arch theory (Coulomb, 1773/1776, pp. 370-382). The reason for this incomplete translation was that Andreas Böhm (1720-1790), as editor of the Magazin, was mainly interested in calculations for retaining walls because this was crucial to\n\n2.2 Earth pressure theory as an object of military engineering\n\nFig. 2.26 Title page of the ﬁrst volume of Böhm’s Magazin für Ingenieur und Artilleristen.\n\nthe everyday work of military engineers engaged on fortiﬁcations and at the same time reﬂected his understanding of his discipline. Andreas Böhm, professor of philosophy and mathematics in Gießen, published the ﬁrst volume of his Magazin (Fig. 2.26) in 1777; 12 volumes had been published by 1795. The second volume appeared in the founding year of the Magazin, the third and fourth volumes followed in 1778 and Böhm published the subsequent volumes each year between 1779 and 1783. However, it was not until 1787 and 1789 that the 10th and 11th volumes appeared to continue the series. The 12th and ﬁnal volume of Böhm’s Magazin was published by Johann Carl Friedrich Hauﬀ (1766-1846), professor of mathematics in Marburg, in 1795. Böhm’s Magazin was the ﬁrst German-language periodical in which the state of knowledge for engineering oﬃcers was compiled, edited and archived.\n\n35\n\n36\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\nBöhm named ﬁve reasons for founding the Magazin: • To make available again short, excellent articles from “engineering and artillery science”. • To present extracts from larger relevant works published many years ago and in limited numbers. • To present German translations of articles in foreign languages published by the academies. • To present handwritten manuscripts in printed form. • To publish original works. With these goals in mind, it was the editor’s “intention to promote the continuance of engineering and artillery science ... according to his ability” (Böhm, 1777, preliminary report). Recurring themes in Böhm’s Magazin were the determination of earth pressure and the design of retaining walls. Besides Coulomb’s earth pressure theory, the Magazin also contained a translation of Couplet’s work (Couplet, 1795) and other publications on this subject written by engineering oﬃcers and mathematics professors such as Kinsky (1778/Vol. III & 1795/Vol. XII), Ypey (1778/Vol. IV), Lorgna (1778/Vol. IV), Clasen (1779/Vol. V & 1781/Vol. VII), Heurlin (1778/Vol. IV) and Stahlswerd (1778/Vol. IV, 1779/Vol. V & 1781/Vol. VII). Almost all of the articles in that list lagged behind the state of knowledge of French engineering oﬃcers and were still in the tradition of the application phase of theory of structures (1700-1775) (Kurrer, 2018, p. 17). An exception was the treatise Vom Drucke der Erde auf Futtermauern (of the pressure of the earth on retaining walls) by Count Kinsky (Kinsky, 1795/Vol. XII). Kinsky based his article on the earth pressure theory of Bélidor (see Fig. 2.15), assumed, like him, a slope angle φ = 45∘ , used the fundamental elements of analysis in doing so and explained the theory of the outstanding French engineering oﬃcer by way of 11 tasks taken from everyday engineering. This was how this earth pressure theory entered the specialist German literature.\n\n2.3 Modiﬁcations to Coulomb earth pressure theory Theory of structures had been working through Coulomb’s earth pressure theory since the start of the 19th century. It retained its function as a reference theory for determining earth pressure into the innovation phase of theory of structures (1950-1975) (Kurrer, 2018, pp. 25-26). The state of this theory and its generalisation around the middle of this phase has been described by Árpád Kézdi (1919-1983) in his monograph (Kézdi, 1962, pp. 170-215). 2.3.1\n\nThe trigonometrisation of earth pressure theory\n\nThe ﬁrst person to modify Coulomb’s earth pressure theory for sloping wall lines was the civil engineer, mathematician and director of the École Nationale des Ponts et Chaussées, Gaspard de Prony (1755-1839) (Prony 1802). David Gilly\n\n2.3 Modiﬁcations to Coulomb earth pressure theory\n\n(1748-1808) and Johann Albert Eytelwein (1764-1848) followed him three years later (Gilly & Eytelwein, 1805, pp. 101-130). The problem with both studies is, however, that they assume the direction of the earth pressure to be horizontal, as for a frictionless, vertical wall line. Jean-Henri Mayniel (1760-1809) provided a consistent solution for the case of the frictionless but sloping wall line by taking the direction of the earth pressure to be perpendicular to the wall line (Mayniel, 1808, pp. 112-120). But in the case of wall lines aﬀected by friction, Mayniel made the mistake of transferring the method pursued by Coulomb for vertical wall lines to the more general case without the necessary modiﬁcations (Kötter, 1893, p. 92). Formal progress compared with Coulomb earth pressure theory took place upon the introduction of trigonometric functions, which eased the generalisation of the theory considerably. Woltman was at the start of this development (see section 2.2.2), which was continued by Prony and Mayniel and was brought to a relative conclusion by Jacques-Frédéric Français (1775-1833) at the transition from the initial phase (1775-1825) to the constitution phase (1825-1850) of theory of structures (Kurrer, 2018, pp. 17-20). Prony\n\nTogether with Adrien Marie Legendre (1752-1833), Lazare Carnot (1753-1823) and other mathematicians, Prony produced logarithmic and trigonometric tables within the scope of introducing the metric system between 1792 and 1801. The detailed calculations were carried out by about 80 assistants, who were organised according to the example of Adam Smith (1723-1790) with an extreme division of labour like a production line, for which Smith used the example of the production of dressmaking pins (Smith, 1776). For Prony it was therefore obvious to express the active earth pressure in the form of trigonometric relationships. In doing so, he discovered a relationship for the retaining wall with frictionless, vertical wall line and horizontal terrain line: The slip plane bisects the angle between the wall and slope lines (Fig. 2.27) to give the slip plane angle ρ (2.69) ϑ = 45∘ + 2 (Prony, 1802a, p. 7). This relationship is called Prony’s theorem in the following, which, incidentally, is also valid for cohesive soil material (c ≠ 0). If eq. (2.69) is substituted into the formula for the active earth pressure of cohesionless soil material (c = 0), eq. 2-14 (see in (Kurrer, 2018, p. 53)), then for the special case under consideration (wall friction angle 𝛿 = 0∘ and inclination of wall Fig. 2.27 Prony’s theorem.\n\ne\n\nne\n\ne li\n\np Slo ρ\n\nϑ = 45° +\n\nρ 2\n\nH\n\nlan Sli pp\n\nWall line\n\nTerrain line\n\n37\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\nline 𝛼 = 0∘ ) we get – following trigonometric transformations – the following simple relationship: ( ρ) .

The earth pressure E for cohesionless soil material is thus nothing more than the product of hydrostatic earth pressure according to eq. (2.13) and the earth pressure coeﬃcient 𝜆a . Similarly, it is possible to derive the formula ( ρ) 1 1 = ⋅ H2 ⋅ γE ⋅ λp (2.73) Ep = ⋅ H2 ⋅ γE ⋅ tan2 45∘ + 2 2 2 for passive earth pressure, where 𝜆p is the coeﬃcient of passive earth pressure (see eqs. 6.7 & 6.10 in section 6.2.1). Français would later modify Prony’s theorem for the wall line at an angle 𝛼 – again valid for cohesive soil material as well (c ≠ 0) (Français, 1820, p. 163) (Fig. 2.28): 1 ⋅ (ρ − α) 2\n\nϑ = 45∘ +\n\n(2.74)\n\nEq.

Coulomb, oﬃcier du génie et membre de l’Académie des Sciences, et d’après des expériences exécutées à Juliers, en novembre et décembre 1806, et en janvier 1807. Shortly after that, Mayniel sent his manuscript Traité Expérimental et Analytique de la Poussée des Terres contre les murs de revêtement to the same committee. Both works were approved by the Comité Central des Fortiﬁcations and were highly recommended to the Minister of War Jean Baptiste Bernadotte (1763-1844) in a report dated 27 February 1808. Mayniel’s work appeared in printed form in that same year (Fig. 2.29). Mayniel divided his work into four books. In the ﬁrst book (Mayniel, 1808, pp. 1-40) he discusses the earth pressure experiments of Gadroy (1746), d’Antony (1778), Gauthey (1784 & 1785) and Rondelet (1805), and also presents his own experiments that he had carried out in Alessandria (then within the French Empire, now Italy) in 1805 and in Juliers, France (now Jülich, Germany), in 1806/1807. Whereas his predecessors measured the magnitude of the earth pressure using small models, Mayniel determined the earth pressure with a much larger test apparatus that was later adopted by Carl Martony de Köszegh (see section Martony de Köszegh). His second book (Mayniel, 1808, pp. 41-128) is dedicated to a critical examination of the earth pressure theories of the 18th century. At the end of this book the author reviews Coulomb’s earth pressure theory and presents it in the form of trigonometric expressions. Thereupon, Mayniel compares Coulomb earth pressure theory with his own earth pressure experiments in Juliers in the third book (Mayniel, 1808, pp. 129-236). Finally, in the fourth book (Mayniel, 1808, pp. 237-312) he works through numerous examples from practical fortiﬁcation engineering applications. Sadly, Mayniel’s work on earth pressure was to go no further, as he died on 17 April 1809 during the second siege of Saragossa during the Peninsular War (1808-1813). Nonetheless, Mayniel’s contribution was not only the ﬁrst comprehensive historico-critical presentation of the earth pressure theories of the 18th century, but also the ﬁrst detailed examination of Coulomb earth pressure theory systematically backed up by experimentation. It was to be a grand overture to the evolution of earth pressure theories in the 19th century. Français, Audoy and Navier\n\nFrançais – or to give him his full title, Professeur d’art militaire et de fortiﬁcation à l’École Royale de l’Artillerie et du Génie de Metz – made signiﬁcant modiﬁcations to Coulomb earth pressure theory already added to by Prony and Mayniel. His ground-breaking contribution to earth pressure theory was published in the fourth volume of Mémorial de l’oﬃcier du Génie (Français, 1820), a series of papers founded in 1803 and published under the auspices of the Ministry of War by the Comité Central des Fortiﬁcations. That edition of the publication contains not only his modiﬁed version of Prony’s theorem (see Fig. 2.28), but also the case of the terrain line inclined at an angle 𝛽 with respect to the horizontal – a case that is important for the ramparts of fortiﬁcations, for instance.\n\n39\n\n40\n\n2 The history of earth pressure theory\n\nFig. 2.29 Title page of Mayniel’s Traité on earth pressure on retaining walls.\n\nHowever, Français’ approach “contains idiosyncrasies; for example, the slip plane is assumed as if for the case of ﬂat terrain [= horizontal terrain line 𝛽 = 0∘ – the author] with regard to the direction of the rear surface of the wall [= inclined wall line at angle 𝛼 ≠ 0∘ – the author]” (Kötter, 1893, p. 93). Later, the future Brigadier-General Jean-Victor Audoy supplied the correct solution for the case illustrated in Fig. 2.30. It is important to note here that the inclination of the terrain line 𝛽 is at least equal to or greater than the angle of the slope line 𝜌;\n\n2.3 Modiﬁcations to Coulomb earth pressure theory\n\nFig. 2.30 Determining the earth pressure for the earth surcharge case after Audoy (redrawn after (Audoy, 1832)).\n\nk\n\nn terrain line\n\nke\n\nk′\n\nH′\n\no Br\n\nH\n\nSlip\n\npla\n\nne\n\nβ\n\nϑ\n\nρ\n\nH 3\n\nE\n\nb\n\ntherefore, its stability must be ensured by way of fascines, planting or other measures. Audoy developed his modiﬁed earth pressure theory in a commentary to a work by Michaux which ﬁlled 26 pages (Audoy 1832)! Audoy had already tried to modify earth pressure theory in 1820, but with less success. He derived the earth pressure for the unit weight, friction and cohesion varying with the level y, but conﬁned himself to the case of a horizontal terrain line (Audoy, 1820). However, his generalisation had no practical value “because the law of variability with depth is not known exactly or is itself very variable” (Winkler, 1872, p. 70). Nevertheless, Lahmeyer does explore Audoy’s cumbersome modiﬁcation in the appendix to his translation of Poncelet’s earth pressure theory (Poncelet, 1844, pp. 233-242), but then continues Audoy’s observations for soil materials with constant unit weight, friction and cohesion using Français’ example taking cohesion into account. Français uses his elegant trigonometric formulation of earth pressure theory to determine cohesion c as well. Eq.

(2.76) E = ⋅ H2 ⋅ γE ⋅ tan2 45∘ − 2 2 2 Français takes an earth pressure E = 0 and therefore obtains the height H c at which a vertically separated body of earth remains stable without a retaining wall (Français, 1820, p. 165): ( ρ) 4⋅c (2.77) ⋅ cot 45∘ − Hc = γE 2 This equation for the critical height H c “can be used to determine the cohesion c for a type of soil and has indeed been used to do this” (Kötter, 1893, p. 93). For this reason, H c was determined experimentally such that the vertically separated body of soil was just in equilibrium and the cohesion c can be determined directly with eq. (2.77). Français also speciﬁes the correct formula for the general case of a freestanding body of soil at an angle 𝛼 ≠ 0∘ . Ferdinand Löwe would later prove, through his own series of experiments, that the method according to eq. (2.77) is inadequate for the majority of cases (Löwe, 1872, p. 5). Using the critical height H c , Français derived the point of application of the earth pressure, which lies a little below H/3. From that, he developed formulas for the minimum base width of retaining walls based on moment equilibrium.
