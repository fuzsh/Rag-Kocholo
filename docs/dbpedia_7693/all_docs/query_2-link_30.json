Curiosityabout how people, animals, things, images and empty space move leads to many adven-tures. This volume presents the best of them in the domain of everyday motion. Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.netCarefully observing everyday motion allows us to deduce six essential statements:everyday motion is continuous, conserved, relative, reversible, mirror-invariant â andlazy. Yes, nature is indeed lazy: in every motion, it minimizes change. This text exploreshow these six results are deduced and how they fit with all those observations that seemto contradict them.In the structure of modern physics, shown in Figure 1, the results on everyday motionform the major part of the starting point at the bottom. The present volume is the first ofa six-volume overview of physics. It resulted from a threefold aim I have pursued since1990: to present motion in a way that is simple, up to date and captivating.In order to be simple, the text focuses on concepts, while keeping mathematics to thenecessary minimum. Understanding the concepts of physics is given precedence overusing formulae in calculations. The whole text is within the reach of an undergraduate.In order to be up to date, the text is enriched by the many gems â both theoretical andempirical â that are scattered throughout the scientific literature.In order to be captivating, the text tries to startle the reader as much as possible. Read-ing a book on general physics should be like going to a magic show. We watch, we areastonished, we do not believe our eyes, we think, and finally we understand the trick.When we look at nature, we often have the same experience. Indeed, every page presentsat least one surprise or provocation for the reader to think about. Numerous interestingchallenges are proposed.The motto of the text, die Menschen stÃ¤rken, die Sachen klÃ¤ren, a famous statement byHartmut von Hentig on pedagogy, translates as: âTo fortify people, to clarify things.â Clar-ifying things â and adhering only to the truth â requires courage, as changing the habitsof thought produces fear, often hidden by anger. But by overcoming our fears we growin strength. And we experience intense and beautiful emotions. All great adventures inlife allow this, and exploring motion is one of them. Enjoy it.

Learning from a book, especially one about nature, should be efficientand enjoyable. The most inefficient and the most tedious learning method is to use amarker to underline text: it is a waste of time, provides false comfort and makes the textunreadable. Nobody marking text is learning efficiently or is enjoying it. In my experience as a student and teacher, one learning method never failed to trans-form unsuccessful pupils into successful ones: if you read a text for study, summarizeevery section you read, in your own words and images, aloud. If you are unable to doso, read the section again. Repeat this until you can clearly summarize what you read\n\nP:09\n\npreface 9 in your own words and images, aloud. You can do this alone or with friends, in a room Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.net or while walking. If you do this with everything you read, you will reduce your learning and reading time significantly, enjoy learning from good texts much more and hate bad texts much less. Masters of the method can use it even while listening to a lecture, in a low voice, thus avoiding to ever take notes. Advice for teachers A teacher likes pupils and likes to lead them into exploring the field he chose. His or her enthusiasm for the job is the key to job satisfaction. If you are a teacher, before the start of a lesson, picture, feel and tell yourself how you enjoy the topic of the lesson; then picture, feel and tell yourself how you will lead each of your pupils into enjoying that topic as much as you do. Do this exercise consciously, every time. You will minimize trouble in your class and maximize your teaching success. This book is not written with exams in mind; it is written to make teachers and stu- dents understand and enjoy physics, the science of motion.

The gentle wind moving the leaves aroundus helps to restore the calmness of the place. Nearby, the water in a small river followsits complicated way down the valley, reflecting on its surface the ever-changing shapesof the clouds.Motion is everywhere: friendly and threatening, terrible and beautiful. It is fundamen-tal to our human existence. We need motion for growing, for learning, for thinking andfor enjoying life. We use motion for walking through a forest, for listening to its noisesand for talking about all this. Like all animals, we rely on motion to get food and tosurvive dangers. Like all living beings, we need motion to reproduce, to breathe and todigest. Like all objects, motion keeps us warm.Motion is the most fundamental observation about nature at large. It turns out thateverything that happens in the world is some type of motion. There are no exceptions.Motion is such a basic part of our observations that even the origin of the word is lost inthe darkness of Indo-European linguistic history. The fascination of motion has alwaysmade it a favourite object of curiosity. By the fifth century bce in ancient Greece, itsRef. 1 study had been given a name: physics.Motion is also important to the human condition. What can we know? Where doesthe world come from? Who are we? Where do we come from? What will we do? Whatshould we do? What will the future bring? What is death? Where does life lead? All thesequestions are about motion. The study of motion provides answers that are both deepand surprising.Ref. 2 Motion is mysterious. Though found everywhere â in the stars, in the tides, in oureyelids â neither the ancient thinkers nor myriads of others in the 25 centuries since thenhave been able to shed light on the central mystery: what is motion? We shall discoverthat the standard reply, âmotion is the change of place in timeâ, is correct, but inadequate.Just recently a full answer has finally been found. This is the story of the way to find it.Motion is a part of human experience. If we imagine human experience as an island,then destiny, symbolized by the waves of the sea, carried us to its shore. Near the centre of* Zeno of Elea (c. 450 bce), one of the main exponents of the Eleatic school of philosophy.\n\nP:16\n\n16 1 why should we care abou t motion?

From its top we can see over the whole landscape and get an impression of the relationships between all human experiences, and in particular between the various examples of motion. This is a guide to the top of what I have called Motion Mountain (see Figure 2; a less artistic but more exact version is given in Figure 1). The hike is one of the most beautiful adventures of the human mind. The first question to ask is: Does motion exist? Ref. 3 â âDas RÃ¤tsel gibt es nicht. Wenn sich eine Frage Ã¼berhaupt stellen lÃ¤Ãt, so kann sie beantwortet Ref. 4 werden.*Challenge 2 s Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus, 6.5 Ref. 5 To sharpen the mind for the issue of motionâs existence, have a look at Figure 3 or Figure 4 and follow the instructions. In all cases the figures seem to rotate. You can experience similar effects if you walk over cobblestone pavement that is arranged in arched patterns or if you look at the numerous motion illusions collected by Kitaoka Akiyoshi at www. ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka. How can we make sure that real motion is different from these or other similar illusions? Many scholars simply argued that motion does not exist at all. Their arguments deeply influenced the investigation of motion over many centuries. For example, the Greek * âThe riddle does not exist. If a question can be put at all, it can also be answered.â\n\nP:17\n\n1 why should we care about motion? 17 F I G U R E 3 Illusions of motion: look at the ï¬gure on the left and slightly move the page, or look at the white dot at the centre of the ï¬gure on the right and move your head back and forward. Ref. 6 philosopher Parmenides (born c. 515 bce in Elea, a small town near Naples) argued Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.netChallenge 3 s that since nothing comes from nothing, change cannot exist. He underscored the per- manence of nature and thus consistently maintained that all change and thus all motion Ref. 7 is an illusion. Heraclitus (c. 540 to c. 480 bce) held the opposite view. He expressed it in his famous statement ÏÎ¬Î½ÏÎ± á¿¥Îµá¿ âpanta rheiâ or âeverything flowsâ.* He saw change as the essence of nature, in contrast to Parmenides. These two equally famous opinions induced many scholars to investigate in more detail whether in nature there are conserved quantities or whether creation is possible. We will uncover the answer later on; until then, you might ponder which option you prefer. Parmenidesâ collaborator Zeno of Elea (born c. 500 bce) argued so intensely against motion that some people still worry about it today. In one of his arguments he claims â in simple language â that it is impossible to slap somebody, since the hand first has to travel halfway to the face, then travel through half the distance that remains, then again so, and so on; the hand therefore should never reach the face. Zenoâs argument focuses on the relation between infinity and its opposite, finitude, in the description of motion. In modern quantum theory, a related issue is a subject of research up to this day. Zeno also stated that by looking at a moving object at a single instant of time, one cannot maintain that it moves. He argued that at a single instant of time, there is no difference between a moving and a resting body. He then deduced that if there is no difference at a single time, there cannot be a difference for longer times. Zeno therefore questioned whether motion can clearly be distinguished from its opposite, rest. Indeed, in the history of physics, thinkers switched back and forward between a positive and a negative answer. It was this very question that led Albert Einstein to the development of general relativity, one of the high points of our journey. In our adventure, we will explore all known differences between motion and rest. Eventually, we will dare to ask whether single instants of time do exist at all. Answering this question is essential for reaching the top of Motion Mountain. When we explore quantum theory, we will discover that motion is indeed â to a cer- tain extent â an illusion, as Parmenides claimed.

If any one of these conditions were not fulfilled, we would not observe motion; motion, then, would not exist! If that were not enough, note that none of the conditions requires human beings; they are equally valid for many animals and machines.

Ref. 10 If you ever find yourself talking about motion, whether to understand it more pre- cisely or more deeply, you are taking steps up Motion Mountain. The examples of Figure 6 make the point. An empty bucket hangs vertically. When you fill the bucket with a cer- tain amount of water, it does not hang vertically any more. (Why?) If you continue adding water, it starts to hang vertically again. How much water is necessary for this last tran- sition? The second illustration in Figure 6 is for the following puzzle. When you pull a thread from a reel in the way shown, the reel will move either forwards or backwards, depending on the angle at which you pull. What is the limiting angle between the two possibilities? High precision means going into fine details. Being attuned to details actually in- creases the pleasure of the adventure.* Figure 7 shows an example. The higher we get on Motion Mountain, the further we can see and the more our curiosity is rewarded. The views offered are breathtaking, especially from the very top. The path we will follow â one of the many possible routes â starts from the side of biology and directly enters the forest that lies at the foot of the mountain.Challenge 6 s * Distrust anybody who wants to talk you out of investigating details.

Intense curiosity drives us to go straight to the limits: understanding motion requires exploration of the largest distances, the highest velocities, the smallest particles, the strongest forces and the strangest concepts. Let us begin. What are the types of motion? â âEvery movement is born of a desire for change. Antiquity A good place to obtain a general overview on the types of motion is a large library (see Table 1). The domains in which motion, movements and moves play a role are indeed varied. Already the earliest researchers in ancient Greece â listed in Figure 5 â had the suspicion that all types of motion, as well as many other types of change, are related. Three categories of change are commonly recognized: 1. Transport. The only type of change we call motion in everyday life is material trans- port, such as a person walking, a leaf falling from a tree, or a musical instrument playing. Transport is the change of position or orientation of objects, fluids included. To a large extent, the behaviour of people also falls into this category. 2. Transformation. Another category of change groups observations such as the dissolu- tion of salt in water, the formation of ice by freezing, the rotting of wood, the cook- ing of food, the coagulation of blood, and the melting and alloying of metals. These changes of colour, brightness, hardness, temperature and other material properties\n\nP:21\n\n1 why should we care about motion? 21 TA B L E 1 Content of books about motion found in a public library.

Transformations are changes not visibly connected with trans- port. To this category, a few ancient thinkers added the emission and absorption of light. In the twentieth century, these two effects were proven to be special cases of transformations, as were the newly discovered appearance and disappearance of mat- ter, as observed in the Sun and in radioactivity. Mind change, such as change of mood, of health, of education and of character, is also (mostly) a type of transformation.Ref. 19 3. Growth. This last and especially important category of change, is observed for an- imals, plants, bacteria, crystals, mountains, planets, stars and even galaxies. In the nineteenth century, changes in the population of systems, biological evolution, and in the twentieth century, changes in the size of the universe, cosmic evolution, were added to this category. Traditionally, these phenomena were studied by separate sci- ences. Independently they all arrived at the conclusion that growth is a combination of transport and transformation. The difference is one of complexity and of time scale.\n\nP:22\n\n22 1 why should we care about motion?

Motion was equated to transport. The other two domains were neglected by physicists. Despite this restriction, the field of enquiry remains large, covering a large part of Experience Island. Early scholars differentiated types of trans- port by their origin. Movements such as those of the legs when walking were classified as volitional, because they are controlled by oneâs will, whereas movements of external objects, such as the fall of a snowflake, which cannot be influenced by will-power, were classified as passive. Young humans, especially young male humans, spend considerable time in learning elaborate volitional movements. An example is shown in Figure 10. The complete distinction between passive and volitional motion is made by children by the age of six, and this marks a central step in the development of every human to- wards a precise description of the environment.* From this distinction stems the histori- cal but now outdated definition of physics as the science of passive motion, or the motion of non-living things. The advent of machines forced scholars to rethink the distinction between volitional and passive motion. Like living beings, machines are self-moving and thus mimic voli- tional motion. However, careful observation shows that every part in a machine is moved by another, so their motion is in fact passive. Are living beings also machines? Are hu- man actions examples of passive motion as well? The accumulation of observations in the last 100 years made it clear that volitional movement** indeed has the same physical * Failure to pass this stage completely can result in a person having various strange beliefs, such as believing in the ability to influence roulette balls, as found in compulsive players, or in the ability to move other bod- ies by thought, as found in numerous otherwise healthy-looking people. An entertaining and informative account of all the deception and self-deception involved in creating and maintaining these beliefs is given by James R andi, The Faith Healers, Prometheus Books, 1989. A professional magician, he presents many similar topics in several of his other books. See also his www.randi.org website for more details. ** The word âmovementâ is rather modern; it was imported into English from the old French and became popular only at the end of the eighteenth century. It is never used by Shakespeare.\n\nP:23\n\n1 why should we care about motion? 23 F I G U R E 9 Transport, growth Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.net and transformation (Â© Philip Plisson).

(Of course, from the emotional view- point, the differences are important; for example, grace can only be ascribed to volitional movements.) A distinction between the two types of motion is thus unnecessary. Since passive and volitional motion have the same properties, through the study of motion of non-living objects we can learn something about the human condition. This is most evident when touching the topics of determinism, causality, probability, infinity, time, love and death, to name but a few of the themes we will encounter during our adventure. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries other classically held beliefs about mo- tion fell by the wayside. Extensive observations showed that all transformations and all growth phenomena, including behaviour change and evolution, are also examples of transport. In other words, over 2 000 years of studies have shown that the ancient classi-\n\nP:24\n\n24 1 why should we care about motion? fication of observations was useless: â³ All change is transport. And â³ Transport and motion are the same. In the middle of the twentieth century the study of motion culminated in the experimen- tal confirmation of an even more specific idea, previously articulated in ancient Greece: â³ Every type of change is due to the motion of particles.Challenge 7 s It takes time and work to reach this conclusion, which appears only when we relentlessly Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.net Ref. 21 pursue higher and higher precision in the description of nature. The first five parts of this adventure retrace the path to this result. (Do you agree with it?) The last decade of the twentieth century again completely changed the description of motion: the particle idea turns out to be wrong. This new result, reached through a combination of careful observation and deduction, will be explored in the last part of our adventure. But we still have some way to go before we reach that result, just below the summit of our journey. In summary, history has shown that classifying the various types of motion is not productive. Only by trying to achieve maximum precision can we hope to arrive at the fundamental properties of motion. Precision, not classification, is the path to follow. As Ernest Rutherford said jokingly: âAll science is either physics or stamp collecting.â In order to achieve precision in our description of motion, we need to select specific examples of motion and study them fully in detail. It is intuitively obvious that the most precise description is achievable for the simplest possible examples. In everyday life, this is the case for the motion of any non-living, solid and rigid body in our environment, such as a stone thrown through the air. Indeed, like all humans, we learned to throw ob- jects long before we learned to walk. Throwing is one of the first physical experiments we performed by ourselves. The importance of throwing is also seen from the terms de- rived from it: in Latin, words like subject or âthrown belowâ, object or âthrown in frontâ, and interjection or âthrown in betweenâ; in Greek, the act of throwing led to terms like symbol or âthrown togetherâ, problem or âthrown forwardâ, emblem or âthrown intoâ, and â last but not least â devil or âthrown throughâ. And indeed, during our early childhood, by throwing stones, toys and other objects until our parents feared for every piece of the household, we explored the perception and the properties of motion. We do the same here. â âDie Welt ist unabhÃ¤ngig von meinem Willen.* Ludwig Wittgenstein, Tractatus, 6.373 * âThe world is independent of my will.â\n\nP:25\n\n1 why should we care about motion? 25 F I G U R E 11 How do we distinguish a deer from its environment?

Beresford Parlett Human beings enjoy perceiving. Perception starts before birth, and we continue enjoying it for as long as we can. That is why television, even when devoid of content, is so success- ful. During our walk through the forest at the foot of Motion Mountain we cannot avoid perceiving. Perception is first of all the ability to distinguish. We use the basic mental act of distinguishing in almost every instant of life; for example, during childhood we first learned to distinguish familiar from unfamiliar observations. This is possible in combi- nation with another basic ability, namely the capacity to memorize experiences. Memory gives us the ability to experience, to talk and thus to explore nature. Perceiving, classify- ing and memorizing together form learning. Without any one of these three abilities, we could not study motion. Children rapidly learn to distinguish permanence from variability. They learn to rec- ognize human faces, even though a face never looks exactly the same each time it is seen. From recognition of faces, children extend recognition to all other observations. Recog- nition works pretty well in everyday life; it is nice to recognize friends, even at night, and even after many beers (not a challenge). The act of recognition thus always uses a form of generalization. When we observe, we always have some general idea in our mind. Let us specify the main ones. Sitting on the grass in a clearing of the forest at the foot of Motion Mountain, sur- rounded by the trees and the silence typical of such places, a feeling of calmness and tran- quillity envelops us. We are thinking about the essence of perception. Suddenly, some- thing moves in the bushes; immediately our eyes turn and our attention focuses. The nerve cells that detect motion are part of the most ancient part of our brain, shared with birds and reptiles: the brain stem. Then the cortex, or modern brain, takes over to ana- lyse the type of motion and to identify its origin. Watching the motion across our field of vision, we observe two invariant entities: the fixed landscape and the moving animal. After we recognize the animal as a deer, we relax again.\n\nP:26\n\n26 1 why should we care about motion? Ref. 23 How did we distinguish, in case of Figure 11, between landscape and deer? Perception Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.net involves several processes in the eye and in the brain. An essential part for these pro- Challenge 8 s cesses is motion, as is best deduced from the flip film shown in the lower left corners Challenge 9 s of these pages. Each image shows only a rectangle filled with a mathematically random pattern. But when the pages are scanned in rapid succession, you discern a shape â a Page 406 square â moving against a fixed background. At any given instant, the square cannotVol. VI, page 80 be distinguished from the background; there is no visible object at any given instant of time. Nevertheless it is easy to perceive its motion.* Perception experiments such as this one have been performed in many variations. For example, it was found that detecting a moving square against a random background is nothing special to humans; flies have the same ability, as do, in fact, all animals that have eyes. The flip film in the lower left corner, like many similar experiments, illustrates two cen- tral attributes of motion. First, motion is perceived only if an object can be distinguished from a background or environment. Many motion illusions focus on this point.** Second, motion is required to define both the object and the environment, and to distinguish them from each other. In fact, the concept of space is â among others â an abstraction of the idea of background. The background is extended; the moving entity is localized. Does this seem boring? It is not; just wait a second. We call a localized entity of investigation that can change or move a physical system â or simply a system. A system is a recognizable, thus permanent part of nature. Systems can be objects â also called âphysical bodiesâ â or radiation.. Therefore, images, which are made of radiation, are aspects of physical systems, but not themselves physical systems. These connections are summarized in Table 2. Now, are holes physical systems? In other words, we call the set of localized aspects that remain invariant or permanent during motion, such as size, shape, colour etc., taken together, a (physical) object or a (physical) body. We will tighten the definition shortly, to distinguish objects from images. We note that to specify permanent moving objects, we need to distinguish them from the environment. In other words, right from the start we experience motion as a relative process; it is perceived in relation and in opposition to the environment. The basic conceptual distinction between localized, isolable objects and the extended environment is not trivial or unimportant. First, it has the appearance of a circular def- inition. (Do you agree?) This issue will keep us busy later on. Second, we are so used to our ability of isolating local systems from the environment that we take it for granted. However, as we will see in the last part of our walk, this distinction turns out to be logi- cally and experimentally impossible!*** Our walk will lead us to discover the reason for this impossibility and its important consequences. Finally, apart from moving entities and the permanent background, we need to describe their relations, as summarized inRef. 11 * The human eye is rather good at detecting motion. For example, the eye can detect motion of a point of light even if the change of angle is smaller than that which can be distinguished in a fixed image. Details of this and similar topics for the other senses are the domain of perception research. ** The topic of motion perception is full of interesting aspects. An excellent introduction is chapter 6 of the beautiful text by Donald D. Hoffman, Visual Intelligence â How We Create What We See, W.W. Norton & Co., 1998. His collection of basic motion illusions can be experienced and explored on the associated www.cogsci.uci.edu/~ddhoff website. *** Contrary to what is often read in popular literature, the distinction is possible in quantum theory. It becomes impossible only when quantum theory is unified with general relativity.\n\nP:27\n\n1 why should we care about motion? 27TA B L E 2 Family tree of the basic physical concepts. motion the basic type of change parts/systems relations background permanent produce boundaries measurable bounded produce shapes unbounded have shapes extendedobjects radiation states interactions phase space space-time global local composed simpleimpenetrable penetrable dimension curvatureThe corresponding aspects: distance topology volume distancemass intensity instant source subspaces area Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.netsize colour position domain etc. etc.charge image momentum strengthspin appearance energy directionetc. etc. etc. etc. world â nature â universe â cosmos the collection of all parts, relations and backgrounds Table 2. â âWisdom is one thing: to understand the thought which steers all things through all things.Ref. 24 Heraclitus of EphesusDoes the world need states? âDas Feste, das Bestehende und der Gegenstand sind Eins.

In everydaylife we would say: the situation or configuration of the involved entities. The situationsomehow describes all those aspects that can differ from case to case. It is customary tocall the list of all variable aspects of a set of objects their (physical) state of motion, orsimply their state. How is the state characterized?* âThe fixed, the existent and the object are one. The object is the fixed, the existent; the configuration is thechanging, the variable.â\n\nP:28\n\n28 1 why should we care about motion? The configurations in the lower left corners differ first of all in time. Time is what makes opposites possible: a child is in a house and the same child is outside the house. Time describes and resolves this type of contradiction. But the state not only distin- guishes situations in time: the state contains all those aspects of a system (i.e., of a group of objects) that set it apart from all similar systems. Two similar objects can will differ, at each instant of time, in their â position, â velocity, â orientation, â angular velocity. These properties determine the state and pinpoint the individuality of a physical system among exact copies of itself. Equivalently, the state describes the relation of an object or a system with respect to its environment. Or, again equivalently: â³ The state describes all aspects of a system that depend on the observer.

Is the list of state properties just given complete? In addition, physical systems are described by their permanent, intrinsic properties. Some examples are â mass, â shape, â colour, â composition. Intrinsic properties do not depend on the observer and are independent of the state of the system. They are permanent â at least for a certain time interval. Intrinsic properties also allow to distinguish physical systems form each other. And again, we can ask: What is the full list of intrinsic properties in nature? And does the universe have intrinsic properties? The various aspects of objects and of their states are called observables. All these rough, preliminary definitions will be refined step by step in the following. Describing nature as a collection of permanent entities and changing states is the start- ing point of the study of motion. Every observation of motion requires the distinction of permanent, intrinsic properties â describing the objects that move â and changing states â describing the way the objects move. Without this distinction, there is no mo- tion. Without this distinction, there is not even a way to talk about motion. Using the terms just introduced, we can say â³ Motion is the change of state of permanent objects. The exact separation between those aspects belonging to the object, the intrinsic proper- ties, and those belonging to the state, the state properties, depends on the precision of observation. For example, the length of a piece of wood is not permanent; wood shrinks and bends with time, due to processes at the molecular level. To be precise, the length of a piece of wood is not an aspect of the object, but an aspect of its state. Precise observa- tions thus shift the distinction between the object and its state; the distinction itself does not disappear â at least not in the first five volumes of our adventure.\n\nP:29\n\n1 why should we care about motion? 29 In the end of the twentieth century, neuroscience discovered that the distinction be- Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.nettween changing states and permanent objects is not only made by scientists and engi-neers. Also nature makes the distinction. In fact, nature has hard-wired the distinctioninto the brain! Using the output signals from the visual cortex that processes what theeyes observe, the adjacent parts on the upper side of the human brain process the stateof the objects that are seen, such their distance and motion, whereas the adjacent partson the lower side of the human brain process intrinsic properties, such as shape, coloursand patterns. In summary, states are required for the description of motion. So are permanent, in-trinsic properties. In order to proceed and to achieve a complete description of motion,we thus need a complete description of their possible states and a complete descriptionof intrinsic properties of objects. The first approach that attempt this is called Galileanphysics; it starts by specifying our everyday environment and the motion in it as preciselyas possible.Galilean physics in six interesting statementsThe study of everyday motion, Galilean physics, is already worthwhile in itself: we willuncover many results that are in contrast with our usual experience. For example, if werecall our own past, we all have experienced how important, delightful or unwelcomesurprises can be. Nevertheless, the study of everyday motion shows that there are no sur-prises in nature. Motion, and thus the world, is predictable or deterministic. The main surprise of our exploration of motion is that there are no surprises in nature.Nature is predictable. In fact, we will uncover six aspects of the predictability of everydaymotion:1. Continuity. We know that eyes, cameras and measurement apparatus have a finite res- olution. All have a smallest distance they can observe. We know that clocks have a smallest time they can measure. Despite these limitations, in everyday life all move- ments, their states, as well as space and time themselves, are continuous.2. Conservation. We all observe that people, music and many other things in motion stop moving after a while. The study of motion yields the opposite result: motion never stops. In fact, three aspects of motion do not change, but are conserved: mo- mentum, angular momentum and energy (together with mass) are conserved, sepa- rately, in all examples of motion. No exception to these three types of conservation has ever been observed. In addition, we will discover that conservation implies that motion and its properties are the same at all places and all times: motion is universal.3. Relativity. We all know that motion differs from rest. Despite this experience, careful study shows that there is no intrinsic difference between the two. Motion and rest depend on the observer. Motion is relative. And so is rest. This is the first step towards understanding the theory of relativity.4. Reversibility. We all observe that many processes happen only in one direction. For example, spilled milk never returns into the container by itself. Despite such observa- tions, the study of motion will show us that all everyday motion is reversible. Physi- cists call this the invariance of everyday motion under motion reversal (or, sloppily, but incorrectly, under âtime reversalâ).\n\nP:30\n\n30 1 why should we care abou t motion?

Mirror invariance. Most of us find scissors difficult to handle with the left hand, have difficulties to write with the other hand, and have grown with a heart on the left side. Despite such observations, our exploration will show that everyday motion is mirror- invariant (or parity-invariant). Mirror processes are always possible in everyday life.6. Change minimization. We all are astonished by the many observations that the world offers: colours, shapes, sounds, growth, disasters, happiness, friendship, love. The vari- ation, beauty and complexity of nature is amazing. We will confirm that all observa- tions are due to motion. And despite the appearance of complexity, all motion is sim- ple. Our study will show that all observations can be summarized in a simple way: Nature is lazy. All motion happens in a way that minimizes change. Change can be measured, using a quantity called âactionâ, and nature keeps it to a minimum. Situa- tions â or states, as physicists like to say â evolve by minimizing change. Nature is lazy.These six aspects are essential in understanding motion in sport, in music, in animals, inmachines or among the stars. This first volume of our adventure will be an exploration ofsuch movements. In particular, we will confirm, against all appearences of the contrary,the mentioned six key properties in all cases of everyday motion.Curiosities and fun challenges about motion*In contrast to most animals, sedentary creatures, like plants or sea anemones, have nolegs and cannot move much; for their self-defence, they developed poisons. Examples ofsuch plants are the stinging nettle, the tobacco plant, digitalis, belladonna and poppy;poisons include caffeine, nicotine, and curare. Poisons such as these are at the basis ofmost medicines.

Predictability is reflected in six aspects of motion: continuity, con- servation, reversibility, mirror-invariance, relativity and minimization. Some of these as- pects are valid for all motion, and some are valid only for everyday motion. Which ones, and why? We explore this now. * NiccolÃ² Fontana Tartaglia (1499â1557), important Renaissance mathematician.\n\nP:34\n\nChapter 2 FROM MOTION MEASUREMENT TO CONTINUITYChallenge 34 s â âPhysic ist wahrlich das eigentliche Studium des Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.net Menschen.* Georg Christoph Lichtenberg The simplest description of motion is the one we all, like cats or monkeys, use hroughout our everyday life: only one thing can be at a given spot at a given time. his general description can be separated into three assumptions: matter is impen- etrable and moves, time is made of instants, and space is made of points. Without these three assumptions (do you agree with them?) it is not possible to define velocity in every- day life. This description of nature is called Galilean physics, or sometimes Newtonian physics. Galileo Galilei (1564â1642), Tuscan professor of mathematics, was a founder of mod- ern physics and is famous for advocating the importance of observations as checks of statements about nature. By requiring and performing these checks throughout his life, he was led to continuously increase the accuracy in the description of motion. For ex- ample, Galileo studied motion by measuring change of position with a self-constructed stopwatch. His approach changed the speculative description of ancient Greece into the experimental physics of Renaissance Italy.** The English alchemist, occultist, theologian, physicist and politician Isaac Newton (1643â1727) was one of the first to pursue with vigour the idea that different types of mo- tion have the same properties, and he made important steps in constructing the concepts necessary to demonstrate this idea.*** The explorations by Galileo and his predecessors provided the first clear statements on the properties of speed, space and time.Ref. 26 * âPhysics truly is the proper study of man.â Georg Christoph Lichtenberg (b. 1742 Ober-Ramstadt,Ref. 27 d. 1799 GÃ¶ttingen) was an important physicist and essayist. ** The best and most informative book on the life of Galileo and his times is by Pietro Redondi (see the section on page 311). Galileo was born in the year the pencil was invented. Before his time, it was impossible to do paper and pencil calculations. For the curious, the www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de website allows you to read an original manuscript by Galileo. *** Newton was born a year after Galileo died. Newtonâs other hobby, as master of the Mint, was to supervise personally the hanging of counterfeiters. About Newtonâs infatuation with alchemy, see the books by Dobbs. Among others, Newton believed himself to be chosen by god; he took his Latin name, Isaacus Neuutonus, and formed the anagram Jeova sanctus unus. About Newton and his importance for classical mechanics, see the text by Clifford Truesdell.\n\nP:35\n\n2 from motion measurement to continuity 35 F I G U R E 15 Galileo Galilei (1564â1642).

What is velocity? âThere is nothing else like it. âJochen Rindt* Velocity fascinates. To physicists, not only car races are interesting, but any moving entity is. Therefore they first measure as many examples as possible. A selection of measured speed values is given in Table 3. The units and prefixes used are explained in detail inPage 420 Appendix B. Some speed measurement devices are shown in Figure 16. Page 78 Everyday life teaches us a lot about motion: objects can overtake each other, and they can move in different directions. We also observe that velocities can be added or changed smoothly. The precise list of these properties, as given in Table 4, is summarized by math- ematicians in a special term; they say that velocities form a Euclidean vector space.** More details about this strange term will be given shortly. For now we just note that in describ- ing nature, mathematical concepts offer the most accurate vehicle. When velocity is assumed to be an Euclidean vector, it is called Galilean velocity. Ve- locity is a profound concept. For example, velocity does not need space and time mea- surements to be defined. Are you able to find a means of measuring velocities without * Jochen Rindt (1942â1970), famous Austrian Formula One racing car driver, speaking about speed. ** It is named after Euclid, or Eukleides, the great Greek mathematician who lived in Alexandria around 300 bce. Euclid wrote a monumental treatise of geometry, the Î£ÏÎ¿Î¹ÏÎµá¿Î± or Elements, which is one of the milestones of human thought. The text presents the whole knowledge on geometry of that time. For the first time, Euclid introduces two approaches that are now in common use: all statements are deduced from a small number of basic axioms and for every statement a proof is given. The book, still in print today, has been the reference geometry text for over 2000 years.

If you cannot do so, consider this: whenever we measure a quantity we assume that everybody is able to do so, and that everybody will get the sameChallenge 37 s result. In other words, we define measurement as a comparison with a standard. We thusChallenge 38 d implicitly assume that such a standard exists, i.e., that an example of a âperfectâ velocity can be found. Historically, the study of motion did not investigate this question first, be- cause for many centuries nobody could find such a standard velocity. You are thus in good company. Some researchers have specialized in the study of the lowest velocities found in nature: they are called geologists. Do not miss the opportunity to walk across a landscape while listening to one of them. How is velocity measured in everyday life? Animals and people estimate their velocity in two ways: by estimating the frequency of their own movements, such as their steps, or by using their eyes, ears, sense of touch or sense of vibration to deduce how their own position changes with respect to the environment. But several animals have additional capabilities: certain snakes can determine speeds with their infrared-sensing organs, oth- ers with their magnetic field sensing organs. Still other animals emit sounds that create echoes in order to measure speeds to high precision. The same range of solutions is used by technical devices. Table 5 gives an overview. Velocity is not always an easy subject. Physicists like to say, provokingly, that what can- not be measured does not exist. Can you measure your own velocity in empty interstellar space? Velocity is of interest to both engineers and evolution. In general, self-propelled sys- tems are faster the larger they are. As an example, Figure 17 shows how this applies to the cruise speed of flying things. In general, cruise speed scales with the sixth root of the weight, as shown by the trend line drawn in the graph. (Can you find out why?) By the way, similar allometric scaling relations hold for many other properties of moving systems, as we will see later on. Velocity is a profound subject for an additional reason: we will discover that all its seven properties of Table 4 are only approximate; none is actually correct. Improved ex- periments will uncover exceptions for every property of Galilean velocity. The failure of the last three properties of Table 4 will lead us to special and general relativity, the failure\n\nP:38\n\n38 2 from motion measurement to continuit y 1 101 102 103 104 wing load W/A [N/m2] Airbus 380 Boeing 747 Concorde DC10106 Boeing 727 Boeing 737 Fokker F-28 F-14 Fokker F-27 MIG 23105 F-16 Learjet 31 Beechcraft King Air Beechcraft Bonanza Beechcraft Baron Piper Warrior104 Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.net103 human-powered plane Schleicher ASW33B Schleicher ASK23 Ultralight Quicksilver B Skysurfer Pteranodon102 griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) wandering albatross (Diomedea exulans) white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus) white stork (Ciconia ciconia) graylag goose (Anser anser) black-backed gull (Larus marinus) cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo)10 herring gull (Larus argentatus) pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) wild duck (Anas platyrhynchos) peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus)weight W [N] carrion craw (Corvus corone) coot (Fulica atra) barn owl (Tyto alba) moorhen (Gallinula chloropus) black headed gull (Larus ridibundus) 1 common tern (Sterna hirundo) blackbird (Turdus merula) starling (Sturnus vulgaris) common swift (Apus Apus) ortolan bunting (Emberiza hortulana) sky lark (Alauda arvensis) house sparrow (Passer domesticus) barn swallow (Hirundo rustica) European Robin (Erithacus rubecula)10-1 house martin (Delichon urbica) great tit (Parus major) canary (Serinus canaria) winter wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) goldcrest (Regulus Regulus) hummingbird (Trochilidae) privet hawkmoth (Sphinx ligustri) stag betle (Lucanus cervus)blue underwing (Catocala fraxini) sawyer beetle (Prionus coriarius)10-2 yellow-striped dragonfly(S. flaveolum) cockchafer (Melolontha melolontha) eyed hawk-moth (S. ocellata) small stag beetle (Dorcus parallelopipedus) swallowtail (P. machaon) june bug (Amphimallon solstitialis) green dragonfly (Anax junius) garden bumble bee (Bombus hortorum) large white (P. brassicae) common wasp (Vespa vulgaris)10-3 ant lion (Myrmeleo formicarius) honey bee (Apis mellifera) small white (P. rapae) blowfly (Calliphora vicina) crane fly (Tipulidae) scorpionfly (Panorpidae) damsel fly house fly (Musca domestica)10-4 (Coenagrionidae) midge (Chironomidae) gnat (Culicidae) mosquito (Culicidae)10-5 23 fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) 50 70 100 200 1 5 7 10 20 30 cruise speed at sea level v [m/s]F I G U R E 17 How wing load and sea-level cruise speed scales with weight in ï¬ying objects, comparedwith the general trend line (after a graph Â© Henk Tennekes).\n\nP:39\n\n2 from motion measurement to continuity 39TA B L E 5 Speed measurement devices in biological and engineered systems.

Our eyes track the location of the stone from one point to the next. All observations have their place in a sequence, with some observations preceding them, some observations simultaneous to them, and still others succeeding them. We say that observations are perceived to happen at various instants and we call the sequence of all instants time. An observation that is considered the smallest part of a sequence, i.e., not itself a sequence, is called an event. Events are central to the definition of time; in particular, starting or stopping a stopwatch are events. (But do events really exist? Keep this question in the back of your head as we move on.) Sequential phenomena have an additional property known as stretch, extension or duration. Some measured values are given in Table 6.* Duration expresses the idea that sequences take time. We say that a sequence takes time to express that other sequences can take place in parallel with it. How exactly is the concept of time, including sequence and duration, deduced from observations? Many people have looked into this question: astronomers, physicists, watchmakers, psychologists and philosophers. All find: * A year is abbreviated a (Latin âannusâ).\n\nP:42\n\n42 2 from motion measurement to continuity â³ Time is deduced by comparing motions. Ref. 21 This is even the case for children and animals. Beginning at a very young age, they develop the concept of âtimeâ from the comparison of motions in their surroundings.

If they take a particular village clock on a European island they call it the universal time coordinate (UTC), once known as âGreenwich mean time.â*Astronomers use the movements of the stars and call the re- Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.net sult ephemeris time (or one of its successors). An observer who uses his personal watch calls the reading his proper time; it is often used in the theory of relativity. Not every movement is a good standard for time. In the year 2000, an Earth rotation did not take 86 400 seconds any more, as it did in the year 1900, but 86 400.002 seconds. Can you deduce in which year your birthday will have shifted by a whole day from the time predicted with 86 400 seconds? All methods for the definition of time are thus based on comparisons of motions. In order to make the concept as precise and as useful as possible, a standard reference motion is chosen, and with it a standard sequence and a standard duration is defined. The device that performs this task is called a clock. We can thus answer the question of the section title: â³ Time is what we read from a clock. Note that all definitions of time used in the various branches of physics are equivalent to this one; no âdeeperâ or more fundamental definition is possible.** Note that the word âmomentâ is indeed derived from the word âmovementâ. Language follows physics in this case. Astonishingly, the definition of time just given is final; it will never be changed, not even at the top of Motion Mountain. This is surprising at first sight, because many books have been written on the nature of time. Instead, they should investigate the nature of motion! But this is the aim of our walk anyhow. We are thus set to discover all the secrets of time as a side result of our adventure. Every clock reminds us that in order to understand time, we need to understand motion. Time is not only an aspect of observations, it is also a facet of personal experience. Even in our innermost private life, in our thoughts, feelings and dreams, we experience sequences and durations. Children learn to relate this internal experience of time with external observations, and to make use of the sequential property of events in their ac- tions. Studies of the origin of psychological time show that it coincides â apart from its lack of accuracy â with clock time.*** Every living human necessarily uses in his dailyChallenge 40 s * Official UTC is used to determine the phase of the power grid, phone and internet companiesâ bit streams Ref. 33 and the signal to the GPS system.

For example, the term âwhenâ exists in all human Challenge 42 s languages.Vol. III, page 271 Time is a concept necessary to distinguish between observations. In any sequence of observations, we observe that events succeed each other smoothly, apparently without end. In this context, âsmoothlyâ means that observations that are not too distant tend to be not too different. Yet between two instants, as close as we can observe them, there is always room for other events. Durations, or time intervals, measured by different people with different clocks agree in everyday life; moreover, all observers agree on the order of a sequence of events. Time is thus unique in everyday life. Time is necessary to distinguish between observations. For this reason, all observ- ing devices that distinguish between observations, from brains to dictaphones and video cameras, have internal clocks. In particular, all animal brains have internal clocks. These brain clocks allow their users to distinguish between present, recent and past data and observations. When Galileo studied motion in the seventeenth century, there were as yet no stop- watches. He thus had to build one himself, in order to measure times in the range be- tween a fraction and a few seconds. Can you imagine how he did it? If we formulate with precision all the properties of time that we experience in our daily life, as done in Table 7, we get a concept of time that is called Galilean time. All its properties can be expressed simultaneously by describing time with the help of real num- bers. In fact, real numbers have been constructed by mathematicians to have exactly the same properties as Galilean time, as explained in the chapter on the brain. In the case of Galilean time, every instant of time can be described by a real number, often abbreviated t. The duration of a sequence of events is then given by the difference between the time values of the final and the starting event. We will have quite some fun with Galilean time in this part of our adventure. However, hundreds of years of close scrutiny have shown that every single property of Galilean time listed in Table 7 is approximate, and none is strictly correct. This story is told in the rest of our adventure. of a few per cent.\n\nP:44\n\n44 2 from motion measurement to continuity light from the Sun time read off : sub-solar pointsub-solarpoin t 11h00 CEST close to Mekk a Sunâs orbit on May 15th sun's orbi t close to Mekka on May 15 th mirror reflects the sunlight winter-springdisplay screenwinter-spring display scree n time scale ring CESTF I G U R E 19 Different types of clocks: a high-tech sundial (size c. 30 cm), a naval pocket chronometer Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.net(size c. 6 cm), a caesium atomic clock (size c. 4 m), a group of cyanobacteria and the Galilean satellites ofJupiter (Â© Carlo Heller at www.heliosuhren.de, Anonymous, INMS, Wikimedia, NASA).\n\nP:45\n\n2 from motion measurement to continuity 45 Clocks Ref. 36 â âThe most valuable thing a man can spend is Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.net Ref. 37 time. Page 166 TheophrastusVol. V, page 43 A clock is a moving system whose position can be read. There are many types of clocks:Challenge 43 s stopwatches, twelve-hour clocks, sundials, lunar clocks, seasonal clocks, etc. A few are shown in Figure 19. Almost all clock types are also found in plants and animals, as shown in Table 8. Interestingly, there is a strict rule in the animal kingdom: large clocks go slow. How this happens is shown in Figure 20, another example of an allometric scaling âlawâ. Clock makers are experts in producing motion that is as regular as possible. We will discover some of their tricks below. We will also explore, later on, the fundamental limits for the precision of clocks. A clock is a moving system whose position can be read. Of course, a precise clock is a system moving as regularly as possible, with as little outside disturbance as possible. Is there a perfect clock in nature? Do clocks exist at all? We will continue to study these questions throughout this work and eventually reach a surprising conclusion. At this point, however, we state a simple intermediate result: since clocks do exist, somehow there is in nature an intrinsic, natural and ideal way to measure time. Can you see it?\n\nP:46\n\n46 2 from motion measurement to continuit yTA B L E 8 Examples of biological rhythms and clocks.Living being Oscillating system Period circadianSand hopper (Talitrus saltator) knows in which direction to flee from Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.netHuman (Homo sapiens) the position of the Sun or Moon 0.023 to 0.03 s gamma waves in the brain 0.08 to 0.13 sCommon fly (Musca domestica) alpha waves in the brain 0.3 to 1.5 sFruit fly (Drosophila heart beat 0.3 to 10 smelanogaster) delta waves in the brain 30 sMost insects (e.g. wasps, fruit blood circulation 1 to 2 ksflies) cellular circhoral rhythms 5.4 ksAlgae (Acetabularia) rapid-eye-movement sleep period 4 to 9 ksMoulds (e.g. Neurospora crassa) nasal cycle 11 ksMany flowering plants growth hormone cycle 90 ksTobacco plant suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), circadian hormone concentration, circadianArabidopsis temperature, etc.; leads to jet lag 2.4(4) MsTelegraph plant (Desmodium skin clock 3.2(3) Gsgyrans) monthly period 30 msForsythia europaea, F. suspensa, built-in aging 34 msF. viridissima, F. spectabilis wing beat wing beat for courting yearly winter approach detection (diapause) by circadian length of day measurement; triggers circadian metabolism changes annual Adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) concentration circadian conidia formation a few hours flower opening and closing 200 s flower opening clock; triggered by length of days, discovered in 1920 by 5.1 ks Garner and Allard circumnutation growth side leaf rotation Flower petal oscillation, discovered by Van Gooch in 2002\n\nP:47\n\n2 from motion measurement to continuity 47 +8 Maximum lifespan of wild birds +7 +6 Reproductive maturity Growth-time in birds +5 Gestation time (max 100 cycles per lifetime) +4Log10 of time/min +3 Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.net Metabolism of fat, 0.1% of body mass (max 1 000 000 cycles per lifetime) +2 Sleep cycle +1 Insulin clearance of body plasma volume (max 3 000 000 cycles per lifetime) 0 Circulation of blood volume (max 30 000 000 cycles per lifetime) -1 Respiratory cycles (max 200 000 000 cycles per lifetime) Gut contraction -2 (max 300 000 000 cycles per lifetime) -3 Cardiac cycle (max 1 000 000 000 cycles per lifetime) -4 0.001 Fast muscle contraction (max 120 000 000 000 cycles per lifetime) 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 Body mass/kgF I G U R E 20 How biological rhythms scale with size in mammals: all scale more or less with a quarterpower of the mass (after data from the EMBO and Enrique Morgado).\n\nP:48\n\n48 2 from motion measurement to continuity Why do clocks go clockwise?Challenge 44 s âWhat time is it at the North Pole now? â Most rotational motions in our society, such as athletic races, horse, bicycle or ice skat- ing races, turn anticlockwise.* Mathematicians call this the positive rotation sense. Ev- ery supermarket leads its guests anticlockwise through the hall. Why? Most people are right-handed, and the right hand has more freedom at the outside of a circle. Therefore thousands of years ago chariot races in stadia went anticlockwise. As a result, all stadium races still do so to this day, and that is why runners move anticlockwise. For the same rea- son, helical stairs in castles are built in such a way that defending right-handers, usually from above, have that hand on the outside. On the other hand, the clock imitates the shadow of sundials; obviously, this is true on the northern hemisphere only, and only for sundials on the ground, which were the most common ones. (The old trick to determine south by pointing the hour hand of Motion Mountain â The Adventure of Physics copyright Â© Christoph Schiller June 1990âDecember 2014 free pdf ï¬le available at www.motionmountain.net a horizontal watch to the Sun and halving the angle between it and the direction of 12 oâclock does not work on the southern hemisphere â but you can determine north in this way.) So every clock implicitly continues to state on which hemisphere it was invented. In addition, it also tells us that sundials on walls came in use"
