Biography

Gerd Schmalz is a Professor of Mathematics. His research interest is in CR geometry, which is an interdisciplinary field that uses methods from Several complex variables, Differential geometry, Lie group theory and Differential equations. Applications of recent results include General relativity. Gerd has previously worked at Karl-Weierstrass-Institute, Bonn University, University of California at San Diego, Max-Planck-Institute for Mathematics and since 2005 for UNE. He was the Leading Chief Investigator of an ARC grant on “Symmetries in Real and Complex Geometry”. His research network includes colleagues from Australia, Italy, South Korea, Czech Republic, Russia and New Zealand. He has published more than 50 research papers and has been regularly invited to deliver talks at international conferences.

Qualifications

MA (Diploma, Moscow State), PhD (Acad Sci (GDR), Berlin), Habilitation (Bonn University)

Teaching Areas

I have been teaching units at all levels in various fields of pure and applied mathematics at Bonn University, the University of California at San Diego, and at UNE. Currently I am teaching MTHS120, MTHS130 and PMTH339.

Primary Research Area/s

Mathematics; Complex Analysis; Geometry

Research Interests

My research focuses on Complex Analysis and Geometry with applications in mathematical physics. I enjoy collaboration with my students and colleagues from various countries. I have published more than 50 research articles, cited 233 times by 87 authors. I have received various grants and scholarships, including an ARC discovery grant with V. Ejov (Flinders), G. Cairns (LaTrobe), Y. Nikolayevsky (LaTrobe) and D. Alekseevsky (Russia) in 2013-2018 and scholarships at the Max-Planck-Institute Bonn.

Currently I am working on constructions of higher-dimensional space times related to Sasakian manifolds.
