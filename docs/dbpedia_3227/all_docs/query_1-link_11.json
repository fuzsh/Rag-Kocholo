        "text": "Underwater Hockey (UWH) is a safe, non-contact sport played between two teams of 10 players (6 in the water with 4 substitutes on the sidelines) at the bottom of a pool. Players try to maneuver a puck weighing approximately 1.3 kg (3 lbs) along the bottom of the pool into the opposing team’s goal using approximately 30 cm (12 inch) in length sticks.\n\nAs for gear, players use a mask, snorkel, fins, mouthguard, water polo cap, and protective glove. Players hold their breath and dive to the bottom of the pool (typically 1.8 – 2.6 m / 6 to 8 feet deep) in order to push, pass or steal the puck from opponents. UWH introduces a level of three dimensional play unseen in other sports because players have to breathe at the top of the water while the play is going on at the bottom of the pool. Strategies require careful coordination of timing in order to orchestrate successful offensive and defensive maneuvers with 2 or more players on the bottom while allowing some players to rest and recover oxygen on the surface.\n\nAn official game of UWH is 2 x 15 minute periods with a 3 minute half time. Games can go into overtime (2 x 5 minute periods with a 1 minute halftime) and if still no winner will go to sudden death – first goal wins. There are 4 official referees which officiate the game -1 Deck (or Chief Referee), and 3 in water referees.\n\nUWH is an exhilarating sport that gives you an incredible cardio workout and will leave you literally breathless at times! We have players from 8 years old to 75 years old and all shapes and sizes. The best way to learn and experience this sport is to find a local club and take the plunge. The sport is best viewed underwater and many local clubs have spare equipment for beginners that wish to come out and try the game."
