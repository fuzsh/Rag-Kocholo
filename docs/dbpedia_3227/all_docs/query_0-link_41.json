        "text": "The two activities in this title look absolutely unrelated, yet that’s what I do:\n\nIn the day time, I work in sales, at night, I play underwater hockey. I always found these two drastically different, however, at a team meeting this week with my marketing, delivery and data colleagues by my side on a project, I realized that the two, in fact, are very similar. Before sharing the similarity, I need to give you a bit of background of both my profession and my sport:\n\nI’ve been working as a sales manager for over seven years now. From a start-up SAAS company at a time when the company didn’t have any marketing or intelligence support to one of the world’s most renowned social platforms at which all the support are top notch, to now a media company that to make a content or event partnership successful, I not only need the help from marketing, data intelligence but also production.\n\nRegarding my sport, I’ve been playing underwater hockey for about two years. It is a sport where two teams play against each other with a small hockey stick in each players hand, and a puck to score with, all played underwater, mostly at the bottom of a pool, without oxygen tank. It's a mixed gender sport which requires the team to really work together and time it well to rotate players to surface to breathe, in order to make sure that there are always players down in the bottom.\n\nAs a hunter in nature, I chose to play forward position and in most cases a side forward, meaning left or right forward. I represented Hong Kong underwater hockey team to compete at the Underwater Hockey Asian Championships 2017, and most recently at China Cup 2018 in June. We grew, within three years, from only sending less than ten players to these tournaments, to sending twenty four players to the recent China Cup and ranked 5 out of 13 teams.\n\nIn underwater hockey, we play 6 vs 6 players, where the most common formation used is 3 forwards and 3 backs. Among the forwards, there are mid forward which is normally the fastest and the one who has most puck control in an attacking mode. The left and right forwards are not just wing men but they collaborate with and form a force by the side of the mid forward, and in most attacks, they are the ones that tackle through the defense wall and score goals.\n\nThe back also has left, middle and right positions. The mid back needs to be able to hold the breath the longest with a high technique requirement. The left and right backs are there not only to defend and to get the puck back, but most importantly to pass the puck to the forward to move the game from our zone to the opponent’s.\n\nIn my profession, we have the same formation like my sport, and coincidentally, I play the same role. For example, my brand director, or publisher in media terms, Atifa is the mid forward. She is the sharpest in expertise, to navigate and pace us into the direction we are heading; while the client facing sales role like mine is like a side forward, the one who tackles frontier objections, captures business opportunity and seals deals.\n\nWho supports a sales most directly in business development? Definitely marketing! A weak marketing support is like having an incapable side back who never manages to pass the puck to the forward. In this scenario, most sales found themselves in a situation that they not only need to ensure closing deals but also to always exert effort in educating the market. In underwater hockey, it’s like a side forward needs to go all the way from the back to try to get the puck over, by tackling his/her way through the opponent’s defense, and swim all the way to the end of the other side of the pool for the goal - how exhausting! Hence, this results in longer lead times, lower close rates, and burned out sales persons.\n\nThe scenario also applies to strong marketing but weak sales situations: it’s like a side back finally manages to get the puck and create some momentum, but the forward is seldom at the position to get the puck over nor push the puck into the goal; therefore, the marketing person or in other terms, the side back, always feels demotivated since no effort can be converted into a goal. Some marketing staff may even try to close a deal themselves, and that’s when we see a back scores a goal. As a forward, whenever my back scores, if it’s because the forward didn’t try hard enough, I always feel more ashamed than happy. Gladly, although this situation did happen in my sport (sorry!), it has never happened at my work yet (hopefully never will).\n\nLast but not least, the role of a mid back, it’s almost like a goal keeper and a pace maker in one. The quality this position performs immediately determines how much score you will lose and how much advantage you have, that’s definitely tech/data intelligence team in a company. Among most underwater hockey teams, the mid backs are the team captains, this reflects how important this role is. If a company is willing to invest in the resource and talent of this area, it will immediately put the company into a more favorable position amongst the competition. When a team has a strong mid back, the side backs will have confidence that when it comes to testing the mid back’s competence, or when a puck is in our restricted area, it will be saved and we will be fine; and for the forwards to have the faith that the tables will be turned, and we will be returned to an advantage position.\n\nIn lateral thinking, there are so many things in this world that are deeply inter-connected despite the fact that their appearance may look as if they were chalk and cheese. I’m glad to know that my daily job and my underwater life are similar in many ways. Often, I found myself applying my sports ideology in my career: never give up, try my best, do it with passion, and only go for the win. I’m also experimenting my sales skills into my sport: pace it well, study my opponent, always see a bigger picture and sometimes it’s better to push it back than only to push it forward.\n\nIn both arena, however, be it business or underwater, to form a winning team, we need good players in position in good formation, and any weak player will discount the effort of a team. That’s why a forward should always be mindful that once you have a fully functional team, a score is always a team’s score, same as a sales’ closing, its team effort.\n\nIf you want to give underwater hockey a try, it’s most probably that there are underwater hockey team(s) in your city already; to play it in Hong Kong, please check out our website https://www.facebook.com/HKUWHA/ or inMail me directly. We are always recruiting newbies.\n\nIf you are interested in working in Haymarket, check out the vacancy by click \"Career\" on the top right corner of our company website:\n\nSapphire :-)"
