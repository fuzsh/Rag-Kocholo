        "text": "THIS PROBLEM AFFECTS PLAYER RETENTION IN SEVERAL WAYS\n\n​​ROOKIES: Many players enjoy the advantages, and in many cases perceived power, of being higher up the skills/ability pyramid and while they will not smash through a complete rookie, after 3 to 4 months they believe they can stop ‘babying’ the rookie and will start to hit harder and add force to those tackles. We all have different perceptions of learning curves and I think the curve is much longer than we believe it is. To graduate from non-rookie status, it can take 2-3 years of club play, the investment in good quality necessary equipment, and participation in at least 3 travel tournaments.\n\nELITE PLAYERS: Many of our better players resist any change to the game that has the potential to remove their hard-earned advantages in the pool. It is difficult to explain to them that we must retain players in order to have enough in the pool to create A and B game nights. They don’t realize that practicing the removal of the puck at speed without force will improve their game. Over time, the game will become faster as more players swim and pass rather than stop and curl because they fear being crushed. There are also a few elite players who don’t give back to their sport; they are happily on the top of the heap and will only invest in things that improve their elite status on their own teams.\n\nVETERANS: In a sport where retention is vital to survival, it is important to care for every level of player. We lose players every year who no longer want to endure the physicality of the sport. It is one of the more disappointing aspects of a sport where we could all be playing until we are 90. Veterans don’t want to support the removal of contact from the sport because they don’t want to self identify as weak, or risk many of their teammates crying ‘unfair advantage.’\n\nWOMEN: In theory, underwater hockey levels the field between men and women and if the sport was truly non-contact, that would be an arguable statement. Unfortunately, the average underwater hockey scrimmage is rarely non-contact, which means women not only have to contend with a speed disadvantage, but also a physical size disparity. It does not matter how skilled or fast a woman is, they can be destroyed by an overly enthusiastic club player who uses their physical mass to offset the skill of the female player. The number of hardy women who are willing to endure this physical onslaught on a weekly basis are few. This is further compounded by the egos of the existing women who have strived and found success in our sport. Many women (and men alike) believe that not allowing players to use physical force to remove the puck from another player creates an unfair advantage for women, when the reality is, it would just remove contact from the game."
