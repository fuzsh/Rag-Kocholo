        "text": "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nLINDA HOLMES, HOST:\n\nThere is nothing better for the summer doldrums than a blast of Olympic glory. For a couple of weeks this summer, athletes are showing us how they flip, run, swim, climb, paddle and breakdance to prove they are the best in the world.\n\nSTEPHEN THOMPSON, HOST:\n\nSome get to watch live, some only on TV. But from Simone Biles to Noah Lyles, the Olympics will always bring some, well, smiles. I'm Stephen Thompson.\n\nHOLMES: And I'm Linda Holmes. I'm responsible for that rhyme.\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nHOLMES: And today, we're talking about the Paris Olympics on POP CULTURE HAPPY HOUR from NPR.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)\n\nHOLMES: We are delighted today that joining us is NPR sports correspondent Becky Sullivan from the great country of France. Hello. Welcome to the show, Becky.\n\nBECKY SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Hello. Thank you so much. And I have another Olympian to add to your rhyming, which is the gymnast Jordan Chiles...\n\nTHOMPSON: That's right.\n\nHOLMES: Jordan Chiles.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...Who is amazing. I love her.\n\nHOLMES: Rule of three...\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nHOLMES: ...I should have figured it out.\n\nSULLIVAN: (Laughter).\n\nHOLMES: All right, so the most important thing to get out of the way here at the top is that we cannot possibly cover every story - or even every great story - that comes out of the Olympics by nature. One of the joys of these two weeks is the sheer amount of stuff going on. So if we don't talk about your favorite sport or your favorite athlete, it's only because this is not a six-hour episode, and more's the pity.\n\nFurthermore, we are recording on Monday, August 5, just after the conclusion of the gymnastics competition and when track and field is really kicking off in earnest. So keep in mind that, as you listen to this, the thing you just saw hasn't even happened yet for us, if that makes sense.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHOLMES: I think the first thing to talk about is the gymnastics, both because it's been a huge story and because, Becky, you've been covering that for NPR.\n\nSULLIVAN: Sure have.\n\nHOLMES: It is an amazing assignment to me. On the women's side, obviously, Simone Biles is an enormous story. After pulling out of most of her events in Tokyo, she came back this year, won four medals, including leading the women's team to gold and gold medals for all-around and the vault. The whole team has had a huge meet. Becky, what has it been like at those events?\n\nSULLIVAN: It's been awesome. I mean, I'm a big sports fan, and I think it is hard to overstate how cool it is to see somebody who is, like, a historic great do their thing because there's a lot of other very talented gymnasts who are out there...\n\nHOLMES: Right.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...No doubt. But, like, you watch some just, like, pedestrian Olympians...\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nHOLMES: As if there is such a thing, right?\n\nSULLIVAN: ...These people are already Olympians - like, go out and do a floor routine or do a vault. And then you watch Simone Biles do it, and she just, like, gets higher in the air. She's able to turn her body more times. Like, I think I read somewhere that she gets 12 feet off the ground when she does a vault, and this is somebody who is 4-foot-8.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: So she's, like, going almost three times her height into the air to perform these, like, just absolutely crazy routines. And so watching that, for me, has been just such a treat, even though, like, kind of, on one hand - especially, this was true during the U.S. women's team all-around final - the, like, sort of suspense or tension that you kind of want in a competition isn't necessarily there because...\n\nHOLMES: Right. Right.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...The U.S. just, like, destroyed the competition.\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nHOLMES: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: The U.S., I think, won that by, like, 5.8 points. And, like, if you're not a gymnastics viewer, that's like winning a football game by, like, 50.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: It's, like, so crazy. Like, that's an insane margin of victory. So, like, this sort of competitive tension wasn't there. But watching her do her thing was just, like, marvelous. I just can't say that enough.\n\nTHOMPSON: Well, it's fascinating to watch something like gymnastics or diving or anything that is kind of based on judge's points. Each athlete is working off of a different scale.\n\nHOLMES: Right.\n\nTHOMPSON: So, like, degree of difficulty is, like, kind of like, what are the maximum number of points you can score doing this event?\n\nHOLMES: Totally.\n\nTHOMPSON: And Simone Biles is, like, working off of a different scale than virtually every other Olympian.\n\nSULLIVAN: Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: So even if she has, like, for her, a fairly, as you said, pedestrian...\n\nSULLIVAN: Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: She's, like, one of the most elite athletes in the world. It's like - I don't know - she took a step back. That was garbage...\n\nSULLIVAN: Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: ...You know? But she's, like, working off of - the deductions...\n\nSULLIVAN: Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: ...That they are taking are off of a number that is massively higher...\n\nSULLIVAN: Exactly.\n\nTHOMPSON: ...Than many of the other Olympians. And I agree with you - just the chance to see - you know, photo finishes are exciting. And we'll talk about track and field in a second.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: But it is - sometimes, a lot of my favorite Olympic memories, when I think about them, are of athletes that are just miles ahead of everyone else.\n\nSULLIVAN: Totally.\n\nTHOMPSON: I think of Shaun White and that snowboarding competition, or, like, some of these where, like, this person just somehow found a way to blow everyone away in a race that took 10 seconds.\n\nSULLIVAN: Exactly. So that's been amazing.\n\nHOLMES: Before we do swimming, I do want to talk about the men's gymnastics.\n\nSULLIVAN: Yes, please.\n\nHOLMES: At least in the United States, the women get more of the attention in gymnastics.\n\nSULLIVAN: So much more.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah, and the men's team won a bronze in the team competition. That's breaking a 16-year drought. And everybody got very, very excited about a couple of the individual gymnasts.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHOLMES: Frederick Richard is a TikTok star. But then there is Stephen Nedoroscik, known to so many as Pommel Horse Guy or, as I prefer, Pommel Horse Clark Kent.\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nHOLMES: He is a specialist who only does that one event. He came in...\n\nSULLIVAN: Yep.\n\nHOLMES: ...At the end of the team competition to, like, clinch that bronze. Becky, did you expect men's gymnastics to be the story that it has been?\n\nSULLIVAN: You know, I really fell in love with these guys at the U.S. Olympic trials, which was in June in Minneapolis. I went out there to just sort of, like, watch, take it all in, meet all these guys for the first time 'cause I just started, actually, in this job at the start of June. And so there's a lot of people who cover gymnastics, like, full time. That's their thing. But for me, this was my first opportunity to go out and actually get to meet them and see them in action.\n\nU.S. men's gymnastics, like you said - like, describing the difference in interest between men's and women's gymnastics in the United States is, like, crazy. I looked this up for a story. There are 15 - total - men's gymnastics programs at colleges and universities in the U.S - 15 - one, five. For women's, there are 87.\n\nTHOMPSON: Wow.\n\nSULLIVAN: And then, obviously, both of those numbers pale in comparison to, like, basketball or something like that. But there's just, like, not even opportunities for boys and young men who want to do this sport. And then when they're - like, they find themselves at competitions, and then there's, like, nobody in the crowds. And so all of them at the trials in Minneapolis, even though - the nights that the women would perform, the whole arena would be totally sold out. It was at the Target Center...\n\nHOLMES: Yep.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...In downtown Minneapolis. And then on the nights when the men would perform, there was still a good crowd, but, like, not every seat was full. So even when it's, like, this draw, like, this premiere Olympic event in the United States, like, the men's team can't fill the stadium.\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nSULLIVAN: But this team this year was so exciting. They were so jazzed. The men's team has basically been on this, like, multiyear trajectory to try to get back into contention at the Olympics. So, like you mentioned, they haven't won a team medal since 2008. The last time they even won an individual medal...\n\nTHOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...Before this Olympics was in 2016. You know, meanwhile, the women's team is winning, like, gold after gold after gold. Basically, what they realized is, like - as we sort of talked about earlier, Stephen, when you were talking about how Simone is just performing a level of difficulty way higher than her competitors, and that allows her to access these scores that are way higher - our men's teams weren't capable of performing at the same level as China or Japan or Russia - these, like, powerhouses in men's gymnastics.\n\nAnd so it has been, like, a yearslong process to develop the talent who could perform these harder routines. And, really, they have their eye on the 2028 Summer Olympics, which are going to be in Los Angeles. And so this was sort of like a, let's try and sort of see where we're at. Maybe if we're lucky, we can get bronze. And they did it. And I was just, like, so - you know, we sort of talked about how the competitive tension wasn't really there for the U.S. women's team. In the men's team all-around final, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time...\n\nTHOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...Because in these things, like, the other teams are so good. The margin for error is so little. The difference in, like, the point totals was, like, a point, you know, or less between first and second and third place. And so to fall off the high bar or to fall off the pommel horse - like, that can be the difference between bronze medal, and you're left off the podium entirely.\n\nTHOMPSON: Absolutely.\n\nSULLIVAN: And so it was just amazing. And so, yes, Linda, as you're talking about, Stephen Nedoroscik, last guy to go on the pommel horse. This is, like, out of...\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nSULLIVAN: There's six apparatuses in men's gymnastics. So out of 18 total routines, Stephen Nedoroscik was just one.\n\nTHOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: Right at the end. So, like, of course, the bronze medal was owed just as much, if not more to all of those other performances.\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nSULLIVAN: But he had to clinch this one at this very key moment. The whole arena's, like, holding their breath watching to see if he could do it.\n\nTHOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: It was incredible. I just loved it.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah. And, you know, I feel like part of that for me, at least, is that - listen, to say that anybody can relate to elite athletes is very silly if you're not any kind of athlete. But there is this weird quality where when you learn that somebody, like, has learned that they're not necessarily elite at all of the things in the same way that they would need to be at the Olympics, but they're incredibly good at this one particular thing, which seems to be kind of the trajectory that he took - and I'm not saying, like, he would be the best gymnast at all the things in many programs, I'm sure, right? But he really made it his thing, which is not...\n\nSULLIVAN: Totally.\n\nHOLMES: ...What we're used to with, like, somebody like Simone Biles. I'm going to be a specialist in this one thing, and you can go to the Olympics really just to do that one thing. And I think that there's something about somebody who says, hey, you know what? I'm not going to be the all-around champion. I'm going to be this guy. I'm going to be this guy who does this, and it'll be great. You know?\n\nTHOMPSON: And then I wind up completely transfixed by the pommel horse finals...\n\nSULLIVAN: Exactly.\n\nTHOMPSON: ...Which I did not necessarily expect going into this Olympics. And I'm sitting there like - I really appreciated NBC had a moment in their coverage of the pommel horse where they actually showed how kids learn how to do the pommel horse, where they essentially - they put their hands on this kind of table almost, and their feet are in a bucket that is hanging from a string. And they, like, use the bucket on the string to hold up their body to get accustomed to, like, holding the weight of their body with their hands. And, like, to me, first of all, more Olympic coverage needs to explain how the heck people learn how to do this stuff.\n\nHOLMES: Totally.\n\nSULLIVAN: Agree.\n\nTHOMPSON: But it was really interesting for me watching the gymnasts this year of, like, picking apart the different styles, the different kinds of athleticism that come into play between these athletic performers who I had never heard of three days earlier. And that's been really fun.\n\nHOLMES: I do want to talk about the swimming. Katie Ledecky has been an absolute beast this year, as she has been in three Olympics before this. This year, she won gold in the 1,500-meter freestyle and the 800-meter freestyle, plus silver in the 4x200-meter freestyle relay and bronze in the 400-meter freestyle. And when she is dominant - this is what we're talking about before. When she is dominant, she is so dominant. She gets so far ahead that everybody else is just smoked. I have to assume, Becky, that the atmosphere in the pool is very intense. And I base that on the fact that when I take water aerobics at my gym...\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nHOLMES: ...When people are hooting and hollering and yelling, it's very loud in there. And that, again, is water aerobics at my gym.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHOLMES: So I assume that in a pool setting where the Olympics are happening, that has got to be raucous.\n\nSULLIVAN: It was awesome. Yeah. I got to go out for a couple of nights at the start of the swimming calendar. And so the swimming is being held at what is normally a rugby stadium. It was, I think, the very first night of swimming, there had been this race, sort of, like, billed as the race of the century. That was the women's 400-meter freestyle, and it was a showdown between Katie Ledecky, this incredible Australian swimmer who's been around for a couple of Olympics named...\n\nTHOMPSON: Ariarne Titmus.\n\nSULLIVAN: Ariarne Titmus. She's amazing. And then the sort of newcomer to the current generational greats of women swimming is the Canadian Summer McIntosh. She's 17.\n\nTHOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: This Olympics was expected to be her crowning. And, in fact, it was. She has done amazing. And the crowd was like - I couldn't believe how deafening it was. And then we should also mention the French swimmer Leon Marchand, who has captured the nation's attention here in a way...\n\nHOLMES: Yes.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...That I can only...\n\nHOLMES: Yes.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...Describe - like, Michael Phelps would be the closest thing, but, like, it's truly one of the loudest things I've ever heard. I've been to some pretty amazing sporting events.\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nSULLIVAN: I have been to, like, a game seven of the World Series. This is fully right up there - was Marchand swimming this first night. This French crowd just losing their minds.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: And what was fun, actually, is that the race was an individual medley, meaning he swims each stroke. He'll swim...\n\nHOLMES: Right.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...Backstroke. He'll swim butterfly. But the crowd would roar just every time he popped his head up.\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter) So he'd hear it.\n\nSULLIVAN: So it was like roar, roar...\n\nHOLMES: It's very cool.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...Roar.\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nSULLIVAN: It is...\n\nHOLMES: It's very cool.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...Incredible.\n\nHOLMES: I have found watching the French crowds so much fun.\n\nSULLIVAN: So great.\n\nHOLMES: The other one where I've really noticed this a lot is in judo. They've had some very strong competition in judo, and the crowds are wild. Now, I cannot tell in judo who is winning until somebody...\n\nTHOMPSON: No.\n\nHOLMES: ...Says who just won because I don't understand the rules or what you have to do. But the crowds are so electric that I found myself sitting here watching this judo competition, where I was like, I have no idea what's going on. But being - just the presence of the crowd was enough that it made it, like, super, super fun. There's still a lot of track and field left to go. I think the big headline so far, at least for Team USA, is that Noah Lyles, who has been extremely confident about his prospects...\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nHOLMES: ...In the 100-meter dash, which - maybe that's how you do it, but you do always feel like, oh, I hope you're actually going to win (laughter) 'cause he's been really confident.\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nHOLMES: And when I watched that race, I 100% did not think he won that race.\n\nSULLIVAN: I literally texted our group chat and was like, did he even medal?\n\nTHOMPSON: I wasn't sure he'd medalled.\n\nHOLMES: That's what I thought 'cause he was, I think, last place for part of it, they said.\n\nSULLIVAN: For - yeah, he was last off the block, and he was eighth of eight for the first 40 meters of a 100-meter race.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: Wow.\n\nHOLMES: It's a lot.\n\nTHOMPSON: And he basically - he leaned in. He won by a nipple.\n\nHOLMES: (Laughter) I'm pretty sure the announcers immediately said it was - ultimately, it was the Jamaicans. And then all of a sudden, it came up, and I just thought...\n\nSULLIVAN: Yeah.\n\nHOLMES: ...Is that right? Did he win? And when they showed the tape back, it was like, I'll be darned. He won it in, like...\n\nTHOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nHOLMES: ...The last couple of steps.\n\nTHOMPSON: Because it also - it's, like, where your torso is when you cross the finish line. But how do you even define torso?\n\nHOLMES: Yeah. Listen, the lean is legit. That's how...\n\nTHOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nHOLMES: ...it's done. (Laughter) That's how it's done.\n\nSULLIVAN: It's incredible. I saw somebody online, like, did the math and basically estimated that he won by, like, an inch or two. Even the photo finish I found myself studying. Like...\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nSULLIVAN: ...You have this picture up...\n\nHOLMES: Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...Trying to pick it out.\n\nTHOMPSON: The funny thing about it to me - and it speaks to what you were sort of saying about Noah Lyles' confidence. There was an interview with him somewhat in the moment where it was very clear that he was - like, had this reaction of, like, oh, man, I lost. Wow, you know, good job. You know, better luck next time. And then it was like, oh, I won? I'm amazing.\n\nSULLIVAN: Yeah.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nTHOMPSON: You know?\n\nSULLIVAN: There is a sprinter personality, and it is this. Exactly.\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nHOLMES: For sure. For sure. Becky, do you get to see much else other than the stuff that you're most intensely covering? Do you...\n\nSULLIVAN: Yeah.\n\nHOLMES: ...Get to see anything else or no?\n\nSULLIVAN: I have been trying to at least, like, watch a little TV when I'm, like, back in my...\n\nHOLMES: Right.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...Hotel room working on a story. You can't just, like, flip from Peacock stream number one to Peacock stream number two. You have to, like, get on a subway train and take it to another line...\n\nTHOMPSON: Oh, yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...And then walk the last half mile to the stadium.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: It takes up a lot of time. And so, no, I watch way less when I'm here, I feel like, than I did when I was just...\n\nHOLMES: Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...Like, at home watching for fun.\n\nHOLMES: I mean, I think we sort of have it made from a variety of sports perspective because, after many, many years of the Olympic television coverage being really bad, they've actually sort of figured it out because they finally have figured out how to kind of - and this is if you have Peacock, right? If you only have the prime time coverage, I think it's still, like, not so great. But if you have Peacock, you can be that person who's like, you know what? I'm going to watch the entire event of something, whether it's super popular or not and whether it involves any Team USA athletes or not.\n\nSULLIVAN: Totally.\n\nHOLMES: And it doesn't have that same sense of really having everything super, super curated for you. But Stephen and I, I think, are both also fans of Gold Zone, which is this...\n\nTHOMPSON: Yes.\n\nHOLMES: ...Thing they came up with...\n\nSULLIVAN: Yes.\n\nHOLMES: ...Which is essentially imported directly from NFL RedZone...\n\nTHOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nHOLMES: ...Which is - if you've never seen it, that takes you on an NFL game day to, like, all the different games based on who's close to scoring. Pretty much. That's the short version.\n\nTHOMPSON: It's essentially real-time highlights.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah. Well - and it's trying to get you to what's the best game to watch right now. And so...\n\nTHOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nHOLMES: ...Gold Zone at the Olympics - it is kind of a natural fit because what they do is they skip around, and they try to show you, like, enough of something that you're getting the sense of it. But you're not going to see the whole thing. So if you want to see the whole thing, you still have to watch the whole thing, but they will show you many, many, many different competitions that are ending in people medaling, not only whether or not the sport is popular - like, yeah, OK, they'll show you the gymnastics stuff, but they will also show you medal events in skeet shooting...\n\nTHOMPSON: Canoe slalom.\n\nSULLIVAN: Yes.\n\nHOLMES: Oh, my gosh, can I tell you how much I love canoe slalom, Stephen?\n\nTHOMPSON: I love canoe slalom.\n\nHOLMES: I love canoe slalom. And have you seen the kayak cross where they drop them from the air and into the water?\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nSULLIVAN: It's the best.\n\nHOLMES: Anyway, it will give you, like, a sampling of those things. You know, there is some preference for, you know, when Team USA athletes are performing, but not like that much. For the most part, they're just going to whoever has the best thing. So it'll show you, like, field hockey games between Argentina and Germany. And you do start to really get a feel for, like, lots of different stuff going on, and it does give you a good sampling. Stephen, do you agree? You're a Gold Zone guy.\n\nTHOMPSON: Oh, absolutely. I mean, I'm a big NFL RedZone fan. I appreciate the fact that NFL Gold Zone sometimes does employ Scott Hanson, who is the host of NFL RedZone and who is so good at that job.\n\nHOLMES: Very good at whip-around.\n\nTHOMPSON: But also still knowing when and how to provide context, which is so, so important for a host to do.\n\nHOLMES: As we all know, that's also the producers that they have working with him.\n\nTHOMPSON: Oh, totally. Oh, man. I think about the prep documents that our producers make us. Imagine what an Olympics prep doc looks like for...\n\nHOLMES: For somebody doing whip-around coverage of like 30 sports.\n\nSULLIVAN: It's so crazy. Can I tell you guys...\n\nTHOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...Like, the scale is so bananas. There are more than 10,000 athletes participating in the Olympics. So, like, a prep doc, even like for an NFL game - like, in an NFL game, there's like maybe 50 total starters in any given game, four games at a time. You know, it's like hundreds. It's still a lot, but it's nothing on the Olympics.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: Right, yeah.\n\nHOLMES: Well, you know, they had over the weekend, they were showing on Gold Zone - they were showing this skeet shooting final. And there was a controversy about one of the competitors. This woman, said, hey, you know, the powder didn't explode from me shooting the thing, but I still hit it, right? It just didn't break the way it's supposed to and fling the powder a. So they decided, no, we're not going to give you that. We're going to make that a miss. A little while later on Gold Zone, they brought out on screen, they brought out with the hosts the research guy who is in charge of knowing all about skeet shooting, so that he could explain to you, this is how it's supposed to work. This is what the rules are supposed to be. And he took the position that in the thing, you can see that there's a chip that comes off of it. She was right.\n\nHe took the position. She was right. She should have gotten that point. But they brought, like the guy from research, and it made me so happy because how often does the guy from research actually get brought on like, no, you just come explain it. We're not going to just put you in the host's ear, you come explain it because you understand it the best.\n\nTHOMPSON: And like, I want to really give them a lot of credit for doing that because I think sometimes with hosts, especially your kind of general hosts - they're most obsessed with the things that the public is most obsessed with. And there can be a certain flippancy...\n\nSULLIVAN: Right.\n\nTHOMPSON: ...About some of these sports. Or like, this is weird. This is goofy. What's with the horse prancing stuff? What's the shooting? Why is that - like, there's a certain tendency, I think of a lot of commentators to be audience surrogates in sports that they don't care about, and to have GoldZone treat all those sports as important and bring in people who understand them and treat them with the respect that they deserve - these are Olympic athletes. I really, really appreciate that as a viewer.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah. And to admit when you're watching something that you don't know very much about, to just admit that that's what's happening and that you are being amazed by it in real time - that's what happened when they started showing the trampoline competition.\n\nTHOMPSON: Oh, God. Trampoline's too stressful for me.\n\nHOLMES: The trampolining to me is...\n\nTHOMPSON: Too stressful.\n\nHOLMES: ...Unbelievably terrifying. They're going like 30 feet in the air. It's bizarre.\n\nSULLIVAN: Crazy.\n\nHOLMES: I can't - it makes me so afraid that somebody is gonna put their leg right through the side of the trampoline and snap like a toothpick. It's the most scary thing. And Scott Hanson, who we talked about, was anchoring at the time that GoldZone went to trampolining. And he basically said, look, those of us who are in the studio, a lot of us have never watched this sport before, and I cannot believe what I am seeing. If you are a parent, does it not make you want to say, be careful?\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nHOLMES: You can't - but it's done in a respectful way because he's acknowledging, it's just that I don't watch it, as opposed to this sport isn't important or doesn't matter. It's more just look at me, the guy who doesn't know anything about this. And I think that's been a really useful thing. I don't know. I do want to ask you one other thing, Becky, before we go. Did you go to the opening ceremonies?\n\nSULLIVAN: I did go to the opening ceremony. It was really something. I personally loved it. There are always pockets of complainers. But I was - so where I was, I was on the bank of the Seine. And then just, like, watching these boats go by and the people who, you know, was sitting around me, and just the attendees, just like everybody cheering for every country that went by, every delegation. They did have TVs set up along the bank, and so you could watch the whole broadcast because frankly, otherwise, like...\n\nTHOMPSON: You're going to miss so much.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...In terms of what was happening in front of me - there was one dance performance...\n\nHOLMES: Right.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...That happened in front of me. I think they sort of tried to make sure that, like...\n\nHOLMES: You got something.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...No matter where you were sitting along the river, you have to see at least, like, one live...\n\nHOLMES: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: ...Element, you know?\n\nTHOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: I thought it was still so cool. I loved it.\n\nHOLMES: Yeah.\n\nSULLIVAN: Maybe that makes me a sucker, but...\n\nHOLMES: I loved it, too. I thought it was very cool. I think it's very cool to take an event like that that everybody thinks they know...\n\nSULLIVAN: Yeah.\n\nTHOMPSON: Yeah.\n\nHOLMES: ...What it looks like - and it's always, like, the parade of countries is one thing, and then everything else is something else. And I think interspersing everything together a little bit more - it made it feel a little more interesting and a little more lively. And, like, look, I get what you're saying about complainers, and I know there are some, but, like, to me, the fact that France was like, yes, we are going to have a salute to threesomes in the middle of the opening ceremony.\n\nTHOMPSON: (Laughter).\n\nHOLMES: I was like, yes, you are. Listen, they're having fun. It's Paris. What are you gonna do?\n\nSULLIVAN: Good for them.\n\nHOLMES: Well, yes, we want to know what you think about the Paris Olympics. Find us at facebook.com/pchh.
