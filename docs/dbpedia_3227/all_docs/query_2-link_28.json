        "text": "Two teams of five are hidden inside the pool at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, California this Sunday morning. There’s no submarine in the water, just a mini battle for a pool torpedo.\n\nThe athletes are stationed 13-feet underwater, practically best friends with the bottom of the pool. There’s a tiny goal on each end and an object, for which players wrestle and grab each other’s legs – all with the intention of securing a torpedo and scoring a goal.\n\nAs I hold my breath and splash underwater with my goggles on to catch the action, I can’t last more than 15 seconds before coming up for air. Most of the people I’m watching stay underwater as long as one minute.\n\nAt first glance, the sport leaves you thinking: \"What is going on here?\" But for the players, it’s just another day in the pool.\n\nThe Underwater Torpedo League is one of the hottest sports on social media, garnering millions of views on Instagram, and has evolved from an underground military game to one with Olympic potential. Workouts are grueling, involving deep end fitness, but they become addictive for athletes who can make it through.\n\nThe action is tough enough that it humbled former UCLA water polo champion and current Newport-Mesa (California) Guppies head coach Peter Belden.\n\n\"I looked at it and thought I'd be really good because I could see the similarities to some of the other sports,\" Belden said. \"But that first time you jump in, there's a lot you don't know. Or there's little tricks and tactics that the other guys were using on me and kicking my butt.\"\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the Underwater Torpedo League, from the rules to the origin story.\n\nWhat is the Underwater Torpedo League?\n\nThe Underwater Torpedo League is a sport founded in 2017 by Prime Hall and Don Tran, whom served in the military together and were former pool instructors at Camp Pendleton.\n\nPlayers on two teams fight over a torpedo with the objective being to move the 11-ounce rubber pool toy underwater and put it in the opposing team’s goal. Through hydrodynamics, torpedoes can glide through the water and travel up to 25 feet.\n\nThe game utilizes deep end fitness and breathing techniques.\n\n\"The game is, if you can imagine a water polo net, you shrink it down, put it down in the deep end of the pool,\" Tran said. \"And it's five on five. And the goal is to get the torpedo inside that goal.\"\n\nThere are two tournaments each year: one in spring and the other being the Aqua Bowl, the biggest of the year. The reigning champions are Belden's Guppies.\n\nIn the league’s upcoming tournament, there will be up to 13 total teams ranging from Las Vegas to Portland.\n\nWhat is the format for tournaments and games?\n\nEach tournament includes three to four games to determine seeding for the knockout stage, which is win or go home.\n\nTeams have as many as 12 people on their roster, but only five people from each team can play at a time. It’s a best-of-three format with the target score being five goals and games are played 12-to-15 feet deep.\n\nWhat are the rules of games?\n\nThe rules are simple, with two referees acting as in-water safety and enforcer.\n\nPlayers can only move the torpedo underwater – whether it’s passing to a teammate or handing it off. Players must stay underwater when holding the torpedo and can only come up for air once the torpedo is released. If you reach the surface of the water and are holding the torpedo, it is a penalty or turnover to the other team.\n\nThere are safety rules in each game, including the lockout rule and tapping rule. The lockout rule means no more than two players from each team can get into a scrap, which is the grappling matches underwater. This prevents the person from being pinned down. The tapping rule means you need to let go of someone when they tap.\n\nLike rugby (but unlike football), making contact with an opposing player is restricted to the one possessing the torpedo.\n\n\"You can't grab anybody unless they have the torpedo,\" Tran said. \"But you can, of course, create screens and push people off and stuff like that. But you can't limit forward or upward momentum for any of the athletes, like by holding up or grabbing it, unless they have the torpedo. They have it, they let go, you need to let go also.\"\n\nWhat's it like wrestling 15 feet underwater for control of a small torpedo?\n\nThere’s a certain art to someone yanking at your leg that deep underwater.\n\n\"That's probably (what) the (most fun) part is, because you have to tell yourself to lay low a little bit, not get too anxious,\" said Kurt Lichthardt, a member of the Newport-Mesa Guppies.\n\nBreath control is an important aspect of the game, but especially when deep underwater. That type of environment also establishes a distinct situation.\n\n\"It's conflicting emotions because you're trying to be aggressive, you're trying to grab that person, rip it,\" Belden said. \"But at the same time staying calm. You’ve got to be aggressively calm in a weird way. So, it's a unique balance.\"\n\nAre there any tactics involved?\n\nThe games are not just about tugging players. What originally was, as Tran put it, \"just guys wrestling and look like we don't know what's going on in the water,\" has evolved into something completely different.\n\nTran, who participated in the first tournament, doesn’t see himself succeeding if he jumped in a game.\n\n\"The tactics have completely changed, and the level of game play and the level of game IQ is what we call it for the athletes have completely changed,\" Tran said. \"I feel if I got in the water now, these guys would ball me up.\"\n\nThe Newport-Mesa team revolutionized tactics with its Aqua Bowl run last year, resulting in its first championship. Newport began to do line changes, like hockey, inserting five new players on offense and defense. Lichthardt said it was all about having fresh guys.\n\nAssistant coach Tim Burnham, who credits Belden with the idea, said the move was predicated on having fresh lungs in the pool, something that is especially important in Underwater Torpedo.\n\n\"In a sport like this, I don't care how good you are, if you're tired, you're not going to perform well. And that's why we train so hard and push ourselves,\" Belden said. \"When we have two different lines and we put the best guys on defense, the best guys on offense, it's tough to score on us and it's tough to stop us.\"\n\nWhat are the origins of the Underwater Torpedo League?\n\nTran explained that Underwater Torpedo was always an underground game that the military played together. The Marine Raiders even challenged the SEAL Team to a game when deployed in Guam. While Tran and Hall were instructors at Camp Pendleton, they put their own twist to the game.\n\n\"We put kettlebells down at the deep end of a 15-foot pool that we had. And then the goal was like, hey, get this torpedo and then hold onto the kettlebell for like three seconds,\" Tran said.\n\nWhen Tran and Hall were getting out of the military, they both expressed their desire to work with each other again and \"that was what we kind of put our heads together for that idea.\" They decided to bring Underwater Torpedo outside of the military.\n\nThere were two sessions in the beginning, one in San Clemente, California and the other in Oceanside, north and south of Camp Pendleton. There are now 17 different locations, but not all of them play Underwater Torpedo.\n\n\"We're just adapting it, making it a little bit safer, putting more rules and regulations on it, and then making it and to share it with the rest of the world right now,\" Tran said.\n\nIs Underwater Torpedo League an Olympic sport?\n\nNo, but that’s not stopping Tran, especially with the 2028 Olympic Games set to be held in Los Angeles. It’s his goal to have the Underwater Torpedo League debut then. He’s already talked to the Olympic committee about that possibility.\n\nAccording to Tran they need three continents to be playing Underwater Torpedo. North America is down, and the next target is Australia.\n\n\"Exploring that and then we got to figure out that third location that's coming up soon,\" Tran said. \"We got some years, five years exactly, to see where that's going to go.\""
