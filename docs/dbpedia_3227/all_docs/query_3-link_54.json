        "text": "The era of having a single-career is over.\n\nIt is predicted that Gen Z are likely to have three careers across their lifetime – one more than any previous generation – according to research by Resource Solutions. Though many expect to change careers at some point, for most it is not something they prepare for when they immediately enter the working world – in fact data from Zippia.com shows that the average age for a career change is actually 39 years old.\n\nYet, there is one profession whose initial career will likely not even span half of their working lives, let alone up until retirement. In fact, you’d be hard pushed to find anyone still competing in this field at the age of 67 – the official retirement age in the United States.\n\nProfessional athletes know from the start that their career is likely to be intense, precarious, and come to an earlier end than most others.\n\nWhile superstar gymnast Simone Biles has left the door open to compete in her fourth Olympic Games in Los Angeles, the 27-year old laughs as she comments, “But I am getting really old.”\n\nWith such short-lived careers, many sportspeople look to prepare for an alternative career post-retirement, even very early on in their sporting careers.\n\nSome will transition into roles as coaches, commentators, or analysts within their sport, but others pursue entirely new career paths, often returning to education to upskill, and bring their track record of dedication to a new field. There are plenty of parallels between the world of sport, and the world of business. And the skillsets sports professionals develop can be immensely beneficial for their subsequent career.\n\nFrom football to finance, boxing to banking or tennis to tech – there are plenty of athletes using a business management education to prepare for a post-sporting career.\n\nAs the exploits of competitors at the Paris Olympics 2024 enchant the world, here are some of the Olympians, preparing for a career transition by investing in their business knowledge.\n\nTaking the plunge into healthcare\n\nJulimar Avila’s journey to the Olympics began at just seven months old. Her mother wanted to learn how to swim, so she took Julimar with her to swimming classes and it was there that she discovered her love for the water.\n\nFast forward to the Tokyo Olympics held in 2021, and Julimar took her place on the starting line of the 200m women’s butterfly semi-finals race, at the age of 24.\n\nJulimar, who was born in the United States to Honduran parents, comes from a sporting family, which likely helped propel her to where she is today. “My dad – a soccer coach at the time but coach nonetheless – didn’t want me to miss out on practice when we visited Honduras over the summer,” she explains, ‘so I joined my local team and started competing in Honduras at the age of seven.”\n\nThe start of competitive swimming led Julimar to win her first gold medal for Honduras at an international competition in 2011. She later secured a swimming scholarship to study at Boston University, and made history as the first Honduran swimmer to reach an Olympic semi-final in Tokyo.\n\nThe journey has not been completely smooth sailing. “My journey wasn’t without its challenges,” says Julimar. ”I often put too much pressure on myself, and there were times when I felt frustrated that my times weren’t improving as quickly as I wanted. However, as time I went on, I let these challenges fuel my determination to succeed. These key moments and challenges have shaped me into the athlete I am today.”.\n\nIn preparation for the 2024 Olympics in Paris, Julimar had an intense schedule, including a 5:45am wake up, and multiple exercise and training sessions. If preparing for the Olympics wasn’t tough enough, Julimar has also been studying for a Masters in Health Management at Imperial College Business School, a decision she made to have a fulfilling future outside of the pool.\n\n“Pursuing a business degree offered several advantages. I saw that it would equip me with essential skills in management, finance, and marketing, all of which are valuable in various professional settings. Additionally, when looking specifically at the MSc at Imperial College Business School, I felt that it allowed me to combine my passion for healthcare with an understanding of business operations.”\n\nThough Julimar has not yet decided what her next career step will be, she encourages other athletes to pursue a business degree. “Leverage the skills you learn from doing sports, such as discipline, dedication, and time management, as these traits will help you understand how to tackle challenges, stay focused, and will help you achieve your business goals.”\n\nREAD JULIMAR’S FULL STORY HERE\n\nOpening the vault to business success\n\nThough the average age of Team USA gymnasts at the Olympics has increased from 16.5 in 1992 to 22.5 in 2024, their sporting career is shorter than most. In a sport that involves extreme physical demands on the body, and needs incredible strength and flexibility, the later stages of a gymnast’s career are likely the early stages of many others.\n\n“The biggest challenges have been injuries, and I’ve had a lot of them,” says Aline Freiss, a French Olympian who has competed in both Tokyo and Paris. “You have to take the time to take good care of yourself to get back to your best level without wasting too much time.”.\n\nWhile focused on the Olympics on home soil, Aline believes it is highly important for sports stars to prepare for their next career stage as early as possible. “I think I’m pretty much at the end of my sporting career,” she reflects. “And for athletes it is important to prepare for your career change and seek out courses dedicated to high-level athletes,”\n\nAline discovered gymnastics at a local club when she was just six years old, and six years later she qualified for the French national team. After competing in junior competitions, she shifted into the senior team, competing at the European Games, where she won a Bronze medal in the Vault, and the World Championships in order to qualify for the Olympics. “It was there that I performed the best in my career. It was a key moment for me to qualify for the Olympic Games.”\n\nWhilst Aline has been training for the Artistic Gymnastics event at Paris 2024, she has also been studying at France’s emlyon business school, on their Global BBA Sportifs de Haut Niveau programme – a business education programme dedicated to high-performing athletes.\n\nIn between training and recovery, Aline has been fitting in classes and online modules. “I think it’s important to have both education and sports. It allows me to achieve a balance and take a little pressure off myself from the sporting side. And it means I’m already preparing for my professional future.”\n\nFor other athletes looking to pursue a business education, Aline says that there are many skills that are applicable to both worlds. “Autonomy and rigour are the skills that sport taught me, and that I use the most in my studies.”\n\nREAD ALINE’S FULL STORY HERE\n\nFrom Sea to C-Suite\n\nAdrian Hoesch’s journey to the Olympic games has had to navigate rough waters. He began sailing when he was just 7 years old. “From the moment I set foot on a sailboat, I was hooked,” he says. Adrian made his international debut for Germany at the age of 14.\n\n“Representing Germany on the world stage was both exhilarating and nerve-wracking,” he recalls. “This experience taught me the importance of mental resilience and the need to stay focused under pressure.”\n\nHowever, at the age of 20, Adrian suffered a serious neck and back injury, which forced him to completely stop sailing for two years. “This was a major setback, requiring not only physical rehabilitation but also mental resilience to overcome the fear and frustration that came with such a serious injury.”\n\nDuring his time out of the boat, not knowing when – if ever – he would be back competing on the water, Adrian decided to focus on his undergraduate business degree in Germany, and then applied to study a Masters in International Business at Hult International Business School, in London and New York.\n\nIt was during his studies that Adrian regained his physical fitness and stepped back in a boat, and he made the decision to give his Olympic dream one last shot.\n\n“After graduation, I found a job that would allow me to train and travel,” Adrian says. In doing so, Adrian was able to train with his sailing partner for the Tokyo Olympic qualifications in 2019, representing American Samoa.\n\n“With travel restrictions during the pandemic, training became difficult, and I had to start focusing on a professional career again due to the uncertainty of when the Olympics would happen. I began working for a venture fund. Luckily, after the Olympic Games were confirmed, I reached an agreement that allowed me to start training again.”\n\nAdrian made it to the Tokyo 2021 Olympic games, competing in the Men’s Two Person sailing and securing a top 20 spot. His decision to study at Hult not only reigniting his sailing career, but also prepared him for his next move after becoming an Olympian. He is Co-Founder and Managing Director of EMSU GmbH – a retail digitalisation platform.\n\n“A career in sports can be unpredictable, and having a business degree provides a safety net and opens up numerous opportunities outside of athletics,” he affirms. “My advice to other athletes considering pursuing higher education or a career in business is to have a well-thought-out plan and find an area of interest that excites you.”\n\nREAD ADRIAN’S FULL STORY HERE\n\nNavigating new waters in business\n\nFor Alyce Wood, the biggest barrier to achieving sporting success was having the self-belief. “Growing up it felt like becoming an Olympian was a near impossible feat, and that someone like me wouldn’t be able to do it”, she modestly says.\n\nHowever, the Paris 2024 Games are the third Olympics for Alyce, competed for Australia in the Kayak events. But she feels her greatest achievement has been a return to the sport after having a child.\n\n“Being an athlete is incredibly time consuming and you have to be quite selfish at times, so I’m really proud of how I’ve been able to switch my focus and juggle both motherhood and elite sport. Whilst there’s been some really challenging days, I think being an athlete has made me a better mum, and being a mum has made me a better athlete.”.\n\nAfter the Olympics in Paris, Alyce will be shifting into a new role, as a Project Manager in the Construction industry. She will be using the skillsets she learned during her MBA, with a major in Public Policy, at Griffith University.\n\n“I’ve never been able to work in the business world full-time, as being an athlete and a mum demands so much time,” explains Alyce. “So I’m really looking forward to throwing myself into the business world and finding my ‘new normal’.”\n\nAlyce believes it is highly important for other high-level athletes to have a post-career plan for after their sports career. “When you’re an athlete it can feel like your career outside of sport is stagnant, so I’ve always seen it as important to continually challenge myself and upskill.”\n\nOne unique skillset in particular that Alyce believes athletes can utilise from their career in sport to their career in business is that of people management. “Whilst sport is all about winning medals, there are a myriad of complex relationships and situations that need to be managed on the way to the podium. Learning how to balance people with performance is an art, and a skill that I will be forever fine tuning.”\n\nREAD ALYCE’S FULL STORY HERE\n\nSticking to your career goals\n\nFor Sonja Zimmermann, having more than one focus has almost been in important in her career. After being inspired by the 2004 German gold-winning Olympic team, she took to playing hockey. Her dream of playing in the Olympics came true at Tokyo 2020, where she competed for the German hockey team, reaching the semi-finals.\n\nThe road to the Olympics however was not an easy one for Sonja. “At eight years old, I went to Mannheimer Hockey club in order to follow my dream, but commuting while going to school in another city was always a big challenge and sleep came short here and there.”\n\nHowever, the long days paid off for Sonja, who joined the national team for her first ever camp at 17 years old. Alongside training for her second Olympics in Paris, she has also pursued a Bachelors in Business Administration at Mannheim Business School, in preparation for a future career in business.\n\n“I aim to leverage the qualities acquired from my sports and business experiences to drive innovation and create positive change both within and outside an organization. I will start working in a big company very soon that is happy to support me in continuing my athletic career, for which I am grateful.”\n\nFor Sonja, there are many skills that can be applicable from a career in sports to studying a business education degree, such as stress resilience and discipline. “I would say that discipline, ambition, and team work are all highly applicable to my business studies. They help me to stay focused and motivated and also to collaborate effectively with peers.”\n\nFor other athletes looking to commit themselves to a business education degree, Sonja says it’s easy to be intimidated, but athletes should focus more on the long-term positive outcomes.\n\n“Pursuing higher education or a career in business alongside high-level sports can be challenging, but overcoming these challenges can lead to significant personal growth and development. It's about embracing the journey and using each experience to become a stronger and more resilient individual.”"
