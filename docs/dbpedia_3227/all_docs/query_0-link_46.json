        "text": "Watch it being played – it’s awesome!\n\nHere’s how to play\n\nUnderwater hockey is played in a 25m x 15m pool that is between 2 – 4 m deep.\n\nThe game consists of 10 to 15 minutes halves and a three minutes half time. Each team is allowed one 60 seconds time out per half. The game clock stops for any infringements in the last 2 minutes of the game.\n\nEach side has 12 players, 10 of who can play in any one game. During the game 6 players are in the pool with 4 interchange players on the side who can sub at any time.\n\nThe players wear large fins, a diving mask and snorkel and a thick glove made from latex to protect the hand from the pool bottom and the puck. The top players can flick the puck well over 3m and it comes off the bottom enough to go over another player.\n\nThe puck is made of lead and is coated with plastic, it weighs about 1.5 kg.\n\nThe teams start at each end of the pool with one hand on the wall. The puck is in the middle of the pool. When the referee sounds the buzzer both teams race to get possession of the puck. There is a goal tray at each end of the playing area; it is 3m long with a slope from the front into a shallow trough at the back wall. The puck must pass through the goal volume for a team to score the goal.\n\nThere are many team configurations but generally a team has 2 forwards; one center, one goalie and 2 wings. The idea is to keep possession of the puck and outwit your opponents by using skill, speed, manoeuvrability and breathe hold.\n\nThe rules of Underwater Hockey are fairly simple. Basically it is a non contact sport, a player cannot interfere with another player with their free hand. There is no off side rule however shepherding and obstruction is not allowed. The puck must not rest on the glove or be carried on top of the stick or stopped deliberately by anything other than the stick.\n\nAny infringement of the rules is judged by the 3 in water Referees who signal to the Chief referee who stands on the side of the pool to sound the buzzer to stop play. Depending on the seriousness of the foul the Referees can award a free puck giving a 3m advantage to the disadvantaged team or can eject players for 1or 2 minutes or for the reminder of the game. If a foul has stopped a certain goal with 3m of the goal then the Referees can award a penalty 2 on 1, or just award a penalty goal.\n\nUnderwater Hockey is a great sport for all ages, shapes and sizes. It is a sport that continues to grow and keeps it players interested. Each game is different, each player must overcome their opponent, moving in water, controlling the puck and the innate need to breathe. Teamwork, communication & anticipation are essential\n\nThe game is 3D, how you play is limited only by your imagination."
