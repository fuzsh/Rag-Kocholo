        "text": "Underwater Hockey Makes A Splash\n\nUnderwater hockey is a rapidly growing sport in Central Florida thanks to the vision of sports-enthusiast Dr. Lucky (“Doc Lucky”) Meisenheimer, a dermatologic surgeon and chief of the dermatology division at Orlando Regional Medical Center. Among many accomplishments, Doc Lucky is a critically acclaimed author of the award-winning science fiction novel “The Immune,” and serves on the Board of Directors for the YMCA Aquatic Center, not to mention that he holds the Guinness World Record for the largest yo-yo collection!\n\nDoc Lucky is also an avid competitive swimmer who holds a Masters World Record and national championship. Stemming from his love of the water, and after years of fun play with friends and family in his own pool, in 2010 Doc Lucky decided to start an underwater hockey team at the YMCA Aquatic Center in Orlando. Underwater hockey, formerly known as “Octopush,” is a team sport that was developed in 1954 by British scuba diver Alan Blake. The sport has gained popularity in several countries, including Canada, New Zealand, Australia, France, South Africa and, of course, the United States.\n\n“The sport was developed by scuba divers who were bored during the winter season. They wanted something active to do to stay in shape during the colder months. So, they came up with this idea of using a straight stick to push a heavy puck on the bottom of a pool,” describes Doc Lucky. “At the time, it was a pretty bloody sport because players would scrape their hands on the bottom surface.” Nowadays, underwater hockey players use a different style of stick and wear protective latex-covered gloves.\n\nNational and world underwater hockey competitions are held throughout the country and abroad. In April 2013, the YMCA underwater hockey team will host the Atlantic Coastal Championships at the YMCA Aquatic Center. “We’re looking to get more players involved now in anticipation of the championships. We’ll host sixteen teams, mostly from the United States, and possibly two teams from Columbia. It should be an exciting competition,” said Doc Lucky.\n\nUnderwater hockey is a co-ed sport that appeals to all age groups. “Our youngest player is twelve-years-old and our eldest is eighty-one! We currently have about forty club members. At any one practice, 10 to 20 people show up to play,” said Doc Lucky. There are two father-son combinations on the Central Florida underwater hockey team: Doc Lucky himself is joined by his three sons─Jake, John, and Maximus─and fellow teammate, Bud Brinker, also plays the game alongside two of his sons.\n\n“Underwater hockey is a sport that someone such as myself (a fifty-five-year-old) can actually enjoy with my teenagers, without the fear of suffering blown out knees, twisted ankles, broken bones, and other sports-related injuries,” said Doc Lucky. “Anyone who has a background in water sports, such as swimming, water polo, snorkeling, or scuba diving, would really enjoy underwater hockey.”\n\nTeammate Amy Jackson, a local mom and wife, plays underwater hockey weekly with her husband. She says, “Underwater hockey is a fun activity that we can play (as a couple) for about an hour, while we know our two-year-old daughter is close by and is being carefully watched in the Aquatic Center’s child-care facility.”\n\nHealth benefits:\n\nUnderwater hockey offers excellent aerobic and lung benefits. Like swimming, the sport is a total-body workout that engages every muscle in your body. “We usually play for 45 minutes and rarely hear anybody suggesting a longer game, since everyone ends up exhausted. It’s a fantastic workout,” said Doc Lucky.\n\nGame rules:\n\nUnderwater hockey games are forty-five minutes long and are played in eight feet of water with two goals (one on the bottom of each side of the pool). Each side of the pool requires a minimum of four players. “If we have more people, we use them as substitutes. In a typical game, we’ll have ten people playing on each side. Four people will always be subbed out, because players get tired quickly due to the breath holding,” shared Doc Lucky.\n\nEquipment:\n\nPlayers need a mask, snorkel, fins, wooden hockey stick, padded latex-covered gloves, and a puck. Each stick is about one-foot-long and has a slight curve to it. Loaner equipment is available at the YMCA Aquatic Center. Players are required to wear a water polo cap, mouth guard, and swimsuit. “The learning curve for this sport is simply getting into the water and trying to play for just about thirty seconds! From there, you can build onto your skills and stamina,” said Doc Lucky.\n\nPrice:\n\nThe YMCA Aquatic Center offers a free pass to first-time players. Each following practice session costs only $5.00 (a YMCA membership is not required). “We wanted to make this opportunity affordable for college students and everyone who is on a budget. Underwater hockey costs less than a movie ticket and is ten times the fun,” says Doc Lucky.\n\nLocation:\n\nExperience the excitement of the underwater hockey team at the YMCA Aquatic Center located at 8422 International Drive, Orlando, FL, 32819. Practices are held every Wednesday and Friday evenings at 7:00 pm. “Don’t worry about whether you are in great shape or need to practice. Just come out to get started,” proclaims Doc Lucky.\n\nFor more information on the YMCA underwater hockey team, visit: http://ycfunderwaterhockey.wordpress.com or call (407) 363-1911."
