        "text": "Schools use JV to train their rising stars. The next Tom Brady or Brett Favre of the team gets their start in JV. They move to varsity when they’ve proven themselves ready.\n\nIf you’ve lived and breathed football all your life, you’ve probably wondered about varsity vs. JV. Which team will I get to play on? What’s better for me? Will one team ensure I get recruited into a good school? Or does how I play matter more? What if I’m a varsity benchwarmer for a season? Will that make me look bad to recruiters? Or will they see that I’m so good I’m the only one who can replace other players?\n\nBelow we’ll go over JV vs. varsity and which could be best for you.\n\nWhat does JV mean in sports?\n\nJV stands for junior varsity. Some schools might call their JV teams freshmen/sophomore teams since freshmen and sophomores usually make up the JV rosters. Generally, JV team members show potential but could use a little extra training. There’s a JV captain who’s a JV player that has some extra responsibilities and regularly talks to coaches. JVs only play in varsity games if there aren’t enough varsity players due to injuries, poor grades, or disqualifications.\n\nSome schools have JV games to give their players some real-game experience. JV games are held either before the varsity or on their own night.\n\nThe qualifications to get on the JV team vary by state and high school. But the general rules are that you must have a decent GPA (no failed classes). You must continue to study, do well in class, and hit the gym. Not doing enough athletically or academically is a good way to lose your place on the team.\n\nWhat is varsity?\n\nSo, what is varsity? Varsity teams are usually made up of juniors and seniors. They are the players that win and lose games and take the team to glory. They get the most gameplay and have the skills to lead the team to victory.\n\nFreshmen and sophomores can be on the varsity team, but their skills and gameplay must be on point. Some freshmen and sophomore varsity players are benchwarmers. They sit on the sidelines during varsity games in case they’re needed.\n\nJV VS. VARSITY\n\nVarsity Sports FAQs\n\nConclusion"
