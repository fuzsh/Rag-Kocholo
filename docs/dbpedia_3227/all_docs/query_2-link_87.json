        "text": "Royal Caribbean's mammoth new Utopia of the Seas is loaded with dozens of dining and bar venues and top-deck attractions. Its daily schedule is filled with theme parties, crew-led activities, live music and shows.\n\nThe challenge for would-be cruisers is that they won't have a full week to experience them.\n\nThe 237,000-ton, 5,668-passenger Utopia of the Seas is the first new Royal Caribbean ship earmarked for short-cruise service from its beginning. Its itineraries span just three and four nights, but Utopia is way bigger and more amenity-packed than any other cruise ship sailing short itineraries in North America.\n\nWith such a short time on a big ship, how can you do it all? You can't.\n\nBut don't worry. This guide will help you prioritize your time on board. Whether you prefer to chill out or stay active, here's how to make the most of your short cruise on Utopia of the Seas based on your vacation style.\n\nFor more cruise guides, news and tips, sign up for TPG's cruise newsletter.\n\nBest for families\n\nDaytime activities\n\nThe list of family-friendly activities on board Utopia of the Seas is staggering. We recommend that families make the most of sunny days sailing to the Bahamas by prioritizing time on the ship's top deck and its many watery fun zones.\n\nFor the adventurers in your group, hit Perfect Storm, home to three exhilarating waterslides — two high-speed racer slides and a giant bowl slide that spins you around and then funnels you into the pool. Splashaway Bay is ideal for the little ones, with smaller waterslides, splash pads and a giant dump bucket. Those age 6 and up can test their surfing skills on the FlowRider (cruisers 12 and younger must be accompanied by an adult).\n\nRelated: The best Royal Caribbean cruise ship for every type of traveler\n\nWhen you need a break from the sun, check out the arcade on Deck 16. It's chock-full of video games, air hockey, basketball and other arcade standards.\n\nAlso indoors, the action-packed \"Effectors Homecoming Parade\" takes place along The Promenade. The Effectors are Royal Caribbean's homegrown superheroes who star in theatrical productions on other ships in the fleet. Leading the street party are heroes Captain Viz, Lume, Pixel and Reverb as they celebrate their defeat of archnemesis Crash and his sidekick Burn.\n\nFamilies also don't want to miss The Boardwalk. The neighborhood re-creates the carnival vibe of iconic beach boardwalks and is home to family-friendly attractions and eateries.\n\nTake a spin on the carousel, then grab a hot dog at The Dog House. Play arcade games and enjoy classic pub grub at Playmakers Sports Bar & Arcade, then satisfy your sweet tooth with a range of confections at Sugar Beach (both added fee venues). The Boardwalk is also the spot for special family events like the Steel Pan Family Jam and Family Fun Festival (check your Cruise Compass or Royal Caribbean mobile app for times).\n\nWhen family members feel like they need to do their own thing, Royal Caribbean's robust Adventure Ocean kids program offers engaging supervised activities and entertainment for kids ages 3 through 11. For teens, there's the Social 100 club and Social 100 The Patio, with game consoles, movies and karaoke.\n\nDinner options\n\nFlexible meal times and a variety of dishes for every palate make Windjammer Buffet (included in your fare) a sure bet for families. Added-fare Johnny Rockets is a crowd-pleaser with its mouth-watering burgers and hot dogs, french fries, onion rings, and epic milkshakes and malts. (Lunch or dinner here is $12.99 per person.)\n\nNighttime activities\n\nAfter dinner, head to Studio B for Utopia's incredible ice-skating show, \"Youtopia,\" featuring stellar choreography and colorful costumes. It's a fun but relaxing way to cap off the night, and it's engaging for audience members of all ages. Additionally, Spotlight Karaoke hosts family-friendly trivia competitions, family game shows and family karaoke in the evening.\n\nBest for relaxation\n\nDaytime activities\n\nFor some, cruise vacations are all about chilling out, and on that, Utopia of the Seas can certainly deliver.\n\nIf relaxing is top of mind for you, make the most of the ship's adults-only Solarium pool area. It's the ideal spot for those seeking a tranquil escape from a Lido Deck party atmosphere. On Deck 14 at the front of the ship, the Solarium spans two decks and is covered by a three-deck glass roof. Guests can soak in one of the cantilevered whirlpools that boast expansive ocean views or read a book in a cozy lounger.\n\nFeeling peckish? Just steps away from your lounger is the Solarium Bistro (complimentary), which offers healthy breakfast and lunch options (fresh fruit, soups and salads) in an airy setting.\n\nMake sure you carve out time for a treatment at the ship's Vitality Spa (added fee). Choose from more than 100 treatments, including a variety of massages (deep tissue, cleansing salt scrubs, seaweed wraps and others). Treat yourself to a facial and a manicure or pedicure (or both). You might also want to consider buying a day pass to the spa's thermal suite, which provides you access to heated ceramic beds, sauna and steam rooms, and refreshing rainforest showers.\n\nGreet or end each day on a calming note with a 30-minute early morning or evening stretch yoga class (added fee).\n\nOr try the cruise ship version of forest bathing and spend a portion of each day relaxing in nature with a stroll in Central Park. The Deck 8 neighborhood is lush with thousands of live plants and several trees cared for by the ship's resident gardener.\n\nDinner options\n\nThe spacious, beachy-style environment of Hooked Seafood offers the ultimate setting for a relaxing meal. Plus, it offers peaceful views overlooking the Solarium. Tuck into New England-style seafood, such as crabcakes, oysters, Maine lobster rolls, shrimp and daily fresh-catch dishes. (Dinner is $65 per person.)\n\nIf you prefer a more intimate dining experience, book a table at 150 Central Park. The atmosphere is elegant and moody, with dim lighting and a subdued color palette. Dishes include roasted pumpkin bisque, lobster thermidor, lamb Wellington and seared honey-glazed scallops. (Dinner is $64.99 per person.)\n\nToo relaxed to venture out? Order room service and savor a meal on your cabin balcony overlooking the ocean beyond. It's available 24/7 and incurs a $7.95 fee per person. An additional 18% gratuity will automatically be added to your check.\n\nRelated: Royal Caribbean food: The ultimate cruise guide to restaurants and dining on board\n\nNighttime activities\n\nIf your aim is to relax, you'll likely not gravitate to dance club parties with tons of people and thumping music. Luckily, Utopia of the Seas offers venues for those who prefer a quieter night. Check out live jazz in Central Park, or enjoy the low-key vibes of Giovanni's Italian Kitchen & Wine Bar as you sip a glass (or two) of vino. Not quite ready to call it a day, but need some downtime? Head to your cabin, slip into your jammies and watch a movie.\n\nBest for active cruisers\n\nDaytime activities\n\nUtopia of the Seas is replete with options for those who prefer \"doing\" to \"lounging,\" and there are certainly a few attractions you should bump to the top of your onboard to-do list.\n\nTackle the Ultimate Abyss, the ship's 259-foot-long slide — the longest dry slide at sea. It's 43 feet longer than its predecessor on Wonder of the Seas. On the way down, a flurry of LED lights and see-through windows amp up your experience as you descend. It's a quick ride, so you can hit this one more than once.\n\nFew cruises provide the opportunity to scale a rock-climbing wall for epic views from 40 feet above deck, so this one's a must. Make your way to Deck 7 to test your strength on the rock climbing wall, a Royal Caribbean signature attraction. There's no cost to climb, and reservations are not required.\n\nOther included-in-the-fare activities for adventure seekers include the zip line, where you can soar nine decks above The Boardwalk. You can also compete in the ship's Pickleball Challenge in the Sports Zone (Deck 15). Sign up at the sports desk by the Wipeout Bar on Deck 16.\n\nDinner options\n\nRefuel with fresh-made tacos and quesadillas with all the fixings at El Loco Fresh, near the Sports Zone. Reward your rock wall and zip line bravery with a celebratory margarita from its neighboring venue, Cantina Fresca.\n\nSpecialty dining at Izumi Hibachi & Sushi (in Central Park) is a solid choice for cruisers who crave a little action with dinner. Book the Hibachi side for a front-row seat to your dinner and all the hibachi shenanigans you desire ($64.99 per person).\n\nNighttime activities\n\nIf you enjoy watching the action as much as doing it, Royal Caribbean's signature AquaTheater show should be at the top of your list of evening diversions during your short Utopia of the Seas cruise. The jaw-dropping acrobatics, high-diving stunts and synchronized swimming routines will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nParties are a priority on Utopia of the Seas, and they should be a priority for you, too. The line even created a designated \"party squad\" to organize and host them so you can be confident the activity level will match your energy. You'll find everything from pool deck soirees and late-night celebrations along the Royal Promenade to themed parties like college-style Royal Kappa Chi (think beer pong and DJ mashups) and Silent Toga! — a silent-disco-meets-toga-party event.\n\nBest for entertainment lovers\n\nDaytime activities\n\nIf gambling, shows and dancing are your vibe, Utopia of the Seas offers several ways to stay entertained during your short time on board. Casino Royale (Deck 4) is home to 456 slot machines, 27 gaming tables and a poker room (for serious gamblers). Lessons are available if you need a little guidance. Well-seasoned players can sign up for a variety of tournaments, including slots and blackjack. A smaller, nonsmoking casino is also on Deck 4. It features 40 slot machines, a blackjack table and a poker table.\n\nBoleros, the Latin-style bar on Deck 5, hosts various dance lessons throughout the day. Learn to Zumba, salsa or line dance — skills that will come in handy later that evening.\n\nOr, get your groove on during the Plunge Day Pool Party on decks 15 and 16. Grab a drink at the Lime and Coconut and soak up lively music poolside — from DJ-led hits to live Caribbean music.\n\nDinner options\n\nRoyal Railway — Utopia Station was created for entertainment lovers, so you'll want to book this dinner posthaste. This immersive dining experience takes you on a time-traveling train trip during the course of your meal. After enjoying predinner cocktails on the station platform, you'll \"board\" the train for dinner and a Wild West-themed show. The cost is $74.99 per adult and $24.99 per child.\n\nIf you'd prefer to stick with included-in-the-fare dining, an early meal in the main dining room can provide you enough wiggle room in your schedule to add in a few more evening activities.\n\nNighttime activities\n\nEntertainment lovers take note: Royal Caribbean ships are known for some of the best entertainment at sea. In the main theater, the All In! Production is a must-see. The fantastic production utilizes technology through drones, lasers and digital displays to bring to life some of history's biggest musical venues like Studio 54 and Burning Man.\n\nTake in a comedy show at The Attic, which has a vibe reminiscent of New York City comedy clubs. Evening sets (9:30 p.m.) are for the 18-plus crowd.\n\nAfter the show, grab a rocking chair at the Mason Jar and listen to live country music or pop into the Pesky Parrot for a Caribbean-inspired cocktail and a chat with Brian, the resident parrot. If you're ready to move from watching the entertainment to being the entertainment, Spotlight Karaoke is for you. Belt out your best Celine Dion during the venue's adult karaoke (18-plus). Or, take your newly acquired dance skills to the Music Hall or Boleros for late-night boogying.\n\nBottom line\n\nShort three- and four-night sailings are a terribly brief amount of time to experience a giant ship like Utopia of the Seas. Instead of trying to do it all, focus on what interests you most. Whether you want to chill out, stay active, be entertained or spend time as a family, you can do it on Utopia of the Seas. And if you disembark with a nagging feeling of FOMO, you can always book another long-weekend sailing to try all the things you missed.\n\nPlanning a cruise? Start with these stories:"
