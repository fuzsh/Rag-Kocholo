This program is not available in Alaska and Rhode Island.\n\nFor eligible sports and age groups reported to K&K, covered operations consist of scheduled, sanctioned, and supervised practices, try-outs, clinics, games, playoffs, and tournaments in which an insured participates or hosts. When reported to K&K, coverage is also offered for registrations, meetings, concession stand operations, participation in parades, picnics, award banquets and ceremonies, and incidental fund-raising activities such as car washes, bake sales, and coin drops.\n\nSports organizations not eligible for this program or with more complex insurance requirements should visit our Large Amateur Teams, Leagues, and Associations page or our Professional Sports Teams and Leagues page.\n\nIf you are affiliated with one of the following organizations, we have a program designed specifically for you! Please call our Sports Division at 800-441-3994 for information on how to apply."
