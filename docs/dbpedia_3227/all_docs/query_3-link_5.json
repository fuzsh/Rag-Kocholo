        "text": "Underwater Hockey Club @ MIT MIT Underwater Hockey Club\n\nMIT Underwater Hockey is open to all MIT Athletic Card Members and their guests who pay the Zesiger day-pass fee ($15 or $8 with student ID). No experience or equipment is required (except a bathing suit). We have everything you will need to try out this awesome sport. Beginners are welcome at any practice.\n\nUnderwater Hockey is an exciting and addictive game played at the bottom of a pool with a short stick and a lead puck. This world wide sport was invented in England by a group of free-divers who wanted to stay in shape over the winter season. If you enjoy a great physical workout and other fun pool activities then Underwater Hockey is for you. For more information check out the Underwater Hockey Introduction. You can also listen to an excellent radio documentary by Molly Wetterschneider.\n\nThis piece on the MIT Underwater Hockey Team, produced for Professor Frank Shorr's broadcast sports journalism course at Boston University in Fall 2011, gives a good introduction to our group and the sport."
