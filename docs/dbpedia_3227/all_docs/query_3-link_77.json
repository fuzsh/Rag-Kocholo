        "text": "Octopush is underwater hockey and is a supreme aerobic game. It was invented in the early 1950s by sub-aqua divers in Southsea who got bored just swimming up and down pool lanes to get fit. The game is now played worldwide. Octopush is inclusive to all genders and levels of experience, and we welcome enquiries from those with a disability regarding the accessibility of Octopush.\n\nOur Club | Oxford University Octopush Club\n\nOctopush is a friendly, informal club made up of both experienced players and beginners and open to students and non-students alike.
