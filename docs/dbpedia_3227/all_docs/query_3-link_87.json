        "text": "Children and adults with disabilities in Thunder Bay now have an opportunity to participate in an accessible and adaptive version of Canada's national winter sport.\n\nVolt hockey is an inclusive version of ice hockey that's played on an indoor court using three-wheeled, electric carts with a plastic blade, like that of a hockey stick, attached to the front.\n\nThe carts are controlled by a single joystick, which can be moved to accommodate right- or left-handed players.\n\n\"With the little wheel on the back, it's able to spin really quickly, which would be how folks would pass or shoot,\" said Jessy Bogacki, Thunder Bay's program supervisor for adult fitness, wellness, and inclusion services said.\n\n\"It just takes a bit to get used to,\" he said. \"There's protection around the feet and the arms, so there's no helmet needed.\"\n\nThe playing surface uses low boards, and wide, low nets; the bottom of the carts is carpeted to protect the playing surface.\n\nSix of the carts were donated to the City of Thunder Bay by Toronto's Variety Village, Gobacki said. The plan is to start a league or club in the city, if a location can be found.\n\n\"We don't have a spot to actually currently start a league,\" he said. \"We're hoping a community centre, a church, a school could maybe offer us a spot where we can keep our six carts and play it.\"\n\n\"A location for our league is our is our biggest barrier right now, as the cars themselves are fairly low barrier.\"\n\nGobacki said volt hockey was developed in Denmark, and the game is big there.\n\n\"They have leagues, they have tournaments,\" he said. \"It's fairly new to Canada, started in Toronto at Variety Village.\"\n\n\"They are currently using some of their funding to donate carts to other municipalities,\" Gobacki said. \"I believe there's one in London or somewhere close to Toronto. I think Winnipeg has a little club starting there.\"\n\n\"We just need some people willing to come try it out, and if we get a few people then we can get it running.\"\n\nThe city is hosting some demonstration sessions this summer to give people a chance to try the sport out for themselves. One took place at the end of July, while the next is planned for Aug. 13, from 1:30-3:30 p.m., at the Fort William Gardens.\n\nWarren Vickruck of Options Northwest was at a recent July session with two people he works with that were interested in trying volt hockey out.\n\n\"They're having fun, they're really enjoying it,\" he said. \"I'm liking all the smiles that are on their face. I think it's great.\"\n\nVickruck said the sport will be a good thing for Thunder Bay.\n\n\"It gets them involved,\" he said. \"For somebody who doesn't have that athletic ability to go out and play hockey, on ice or even floor hockey, it may not be what they can do, but this is definitely what they can do, they just need a big, flat open surface.\"\n\n\"I'm really impressed, I really do hope it does take off.\""
