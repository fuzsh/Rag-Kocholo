        "text": "Before the first HBCU football game kicks off later this month, let's look at which players are the best of the best. I ranked the top three returning players at every position by using stats and on-field play from prior seasons.\n\nLet's take a look at the list.\n\nTop three players in HBCU football entering 2024, by position\n\nQB\n\n1. Myles Crawley | Grambling State\n\n2. Jace Wilson | Texas Southern\n\n3. Andrew Body | Alabama State\n\nMyles Crawley is the only sure thing at quarterback in HBCU football this fall. Yet, even with his big arm, he still lacks the luster the position has had in recent years. I gave the second spot to Jace Wilson at Texas Southern because he finished last season, while the third spot went to the person who had Wilson on the bench to start last year, Andrew Body. Body barely played last fall and still got the third spot. That shows how different the outlook for the quarterback position is in HBCU football this fall.\n\nFIRST LOOK: 2024 Preseason HBCU football power rankings\n\nRB\n\n1. Jarett Hunter | Howard\n\n2. Elijah Burris | Hampton\n\n3. Jordan Gant | Tennessee State\n\nJarett Hunter is the lead back in a loaded backfield at Howard. Still, everyone knows Hunter is the top dog there. At the other HU, Elijah Burris could end up being the best running back in the CAA if he gets the touches.\n\nThere were a lot of candidates for the final spot, but Freshman All-American Jordan Gant is coming off a 10-touchdown season and is primed for a bigger role.\n\n2024 HBCU football: Following the 2024 HBCU football season from start to finish\n\nWR\n\n1. Kasey Hawthorne | Howard\n\n2. Joaquin Davis | North Carolina Central\n\n3. Jacolby Hewitt | Alabama A&M\n\nWhen it comes to HBCU wide receivers, there's Kasey Hawthorne, and then there's everyone else. Hawthorne had 10 total touchdowns last fall — five rushing and five receiving. Following the Bison wideout, I chose Joaquin Davis — who caught six touchdowns last fall — and Jacolby Hewitt. I think Hewitt is the best-returning receiver in the SWAC after he caught 32 passes for 516 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nTE\n\n1. Keshawn Toney | South Carolina State\n\n2. Tavarious Griffin | Alcorn State\n\n3. Jaxson Davis | Mississippi Valley State\n\nThe tight end position hasn't been spectacular in HBCU football for a while now, but these three hope to add some flare in 2024. Keshawn Toney caught five touchdowns last year, Tavarious Griffin caught four and Freshman All-American Jaxson Davis caught three.\n\nGAMES TO WATCH: The 20 best nonconference games for the 2024 FCS season\n\nOL\n\n1. Nick Taiste | South Carolina State\n\n2. Ashton Grable | Florida A&M\n\n3. Darius Fox | Howard\n\nNick Taiste is an FCS All-American level guard, Ashton Grable leads a talented Florida A&M offensive line and Darius Fox was a part of a dominant left side for Howard's offense last fall.\n\nUPSET ALERT: 12 potential FCS-over-FBS upsets in 2024\n\nDefensive Line\n\n1. Ckelby Givens | Southern\n\n2. Jaden Taylor | North Carolina Central\n\n3. Jeremiah Williams | Jackson State\n\nCkelby Givens is the best interior defensive lineman in the country. Givens had 21 tackles for loss and seven sacks last fall. There's a drop off from Givens to North Carolina Central's Jaden Taylor, but expect Taylor to take on a bigger role this fall. Jeremiah Williams grabs the third spot here after a 45 tackle, 5.5 tackle for loss and a three-sack season.\n\nEdge\n\n1. Malachi Bailey | Alcorn State\n\n2. Elijah Williams | Morgan State\n\n3. Jacob Williams | Texas Southern\n\nMalachi Bailey is the better pure edge rusher here, but Elijah Williams is the more versatile rusher as Williams can kick inside and still wreak havoc. Jacob Williams is another edge rusher to watch. All three hope to continue the trend of HBCU edge rushers winning the Buck Buchanan Award. Three of the last four winners are from HBCUs.\n\nAWARDS: Ranking the top FCS preseason award contenders\n\nLB\n\n1. Erick Hunter | Morgan State\n\n2. Rico Dozier | Alabama State\n\n3. Aaron Smith | South Carolina State\n\nIf you're having a conversation on \"who is the best linebacker in the FCS,\" Erick Hunter's name will pop up for sure. Meanwhile, Rico Dozier should gain more national attention after transferring from Arkansas-Pine Bluff to Alabama State after he led the SWAC in tackles last year. Dozier should pick up where Colton Adams left off for the Hornets. Rounding out the linebacker core is Aaron Smith from South Carolina State, who's already on the radar of NFL scouts.\n\nDB\n\n1. Kenny Gallop Jr. | Howard\n\n2. Kendall Bohler | Florida A&M\n\n3. Karon Prunty | North Carolina A&T\n\nKenny Gallop Jr. is a top-three safety in the FCS entering the year while Kendall Bohler is a top-three corner in the FCS entering the year. Karon Prunty is one of the most slept-on players in HBCU football after he had a solid individual year on a struggling North Carolina A&T team last year.\n\nBIG TIME: 47 players to know for the 47th season of FCS football\n\nK/P\n\n1. Cameron Gillis | Florida A&M\n\n2. Matt Noll | Jackson State\n\n3. Juan Velarde | North Carolina Central\n\nCameron Gillis only missed one field goal that wasn't blocked last year and didn't miss a single extra-point try. That's elite. Matt Noll averaged 44.3 yards per punt and no matter if he was in the MEAC or SWAC he has performed at an All-Conference level. Closing the group is Juan Velarde, who averaged 41.3 yards per punt\n\nReturners\n\n1. Robert McMinn | Alabama State\n\n2. Keith Jenkins Jr. | Morgan State\n\n3. Dayron Johnson | Tennessee State\n\nRobert McMinn earned preseason All-American honors as a returner after taking back a kickoff and punt last year. Keith Jenkins Jr. also took back a kickoff last season. Dayron Johnson didn't return a kick for a score last fall, but he took a kickoff to the house back in 2021."
