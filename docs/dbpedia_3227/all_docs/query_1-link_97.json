Underwater hockey is a sport similar to hockey that is played underwater in a swimming pool. It was invented in 1954 in Great Britain to help train divers and is now played in over 40 countries. Teams consist of 6 players who use fins, masks, and small sticks to maneuver a 1.5 kg lead puck along the bottom of the pool towards the opponent's goal without using their hands or bodies to interfere with other players. The rules are designed to make it a non-contact sport, and games consist of two 15-minute halves.",
