Working on shutting it down,\" Musk, the world's richest man, wrote on the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\n4-min read\n\nNews·AFP News\n\nWest tells Iran to 'stand down' Israel attack threats\n\nThe United States and European allies called on Iran to \"stand down\" Monday, as fears mounted of an imminent attack on Israel that could spark an all-out war in the Middle East.Washington and the four European nations have also intensified their calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, regarding the conflict sparked by Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel as the root cause of the tensions in the Middle East.\n\n4-min read\n\nNews·AFP News\n\nTanzania opposition denounces arrests of its leaders in mass round-up\n\nTanzania's main opposition party demanded Monday the release of its top leaders who were detained in a mass roundup ahead of a banned youth day rally, a move condemned by rights activists as \"troubling\".They were among 469 party members, including leaders and youth members, arrested across the country, the party said in a statement, demanding their immediate and unconditional release.\n\n4-min read"
