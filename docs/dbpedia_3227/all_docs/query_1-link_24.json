Players use their hands and feet to shoot balls into the opposing team’s goal.\n\nThe object is to score more goals than your opponents by deflecting shots past the goaltender or trapping the ball in your net for a point-blank shot.\n\nWhen attacking, try moving across multiple lanes simultaneously so that you have an advantage on defense.
