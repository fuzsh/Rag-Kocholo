Most of it was spectacular — topped off with Celine Dion, preceded by the unusual sight of the “parade” of athletes on boats down the Seine and the side spectacles that were delightful. The flame-lighting ceremony was unusual. Bizarre, really, a hot-air balloon enhanced with fake flames?\n\nBut I found myself yelling at the television, pleading with the commentators to stop talking through everything. Commentary is one thing, as is explaining; thoughtless bright and perky chatter is another. And this is where American football comes into play. There seems to be a rule in four-down football that a couple of minutes of silence is verboten; it’s all chatter, all the time.\n\nI believe the CFL is infinitely more challenging and entertaining, but I am married to an NFL fan. Over many years I have listened while he and his elder daughter discuss various aspects of the game, while it is being played: he in Calgary, she in various parts of the United States and Canada. They would phone each other while watching the same game. No problem with that, but over top of their telephone talk, I find it impossible to stand the incessant chatter coming from the commentators. When I ask why they never shut up and let the spectators just watch the play and marvel at the athleticism of 350-pound behemoths, he merely replies that talking is their job.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFine, I respond and retreat to the kitchen, muttering that I don’t need some overpaid sportscaster telling me what I am looking at even as I am looking at it.\n\nAnd that is what ruined the opening of the Paris Games for me. Surely I’m not the only person who believes that some silence as an event is occurring would be golden. But maybe this is the coming fancy in Canada — an emulation of the attitude that the television watcher is too stupid to know what is going on and needs everything explained. (I understand and appreciate the commentary offered for the visually impaired, a necessary feature of modern television. But that feature must be turned on, it isn’t part and parcel of ordinary watching.)\n\nThose who argue for the merits of commentators believe they have done their research and know what is going on and what the vital statistics of various players are. I learned a valuable lesson from press boxes over the years: sports journalists and commentators are handed out lists of achievements and stats for the various players. I presume this is still the norm.\n\nTo give many of the best credit where it is due – to have pages of stats is not the key to being good at the job: it’s knowing how and when to quote them, to use the numbers to explain a play. But that should not mean talking through and over every play, which is what football commentary has become and it has leaked into other sports.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nI thought the hosts of the televised broadcast of the Olympic opening would know better: would know that too much talk is annoying to an audience. I thought there must be a logical reason, so I did what the modern person does: consult the Internet. To answer the burning question of what is the point of commentary when the viewer can see for herself, I quote one of the answers:\n\n“The purpose of using commentators on television is to provide additional insight, analysis and expert perspective beyond what the viewer can see on their own. Experienced commentators can offer: Specialized knowledge and expertise in the subject matter that enhances the viewer’s understanding. For example, former players or coaches providing insights into strategy and tactic; contextual information about the event, players/teams or broader significance that isn’t apparent from the live footage alone; real-time analysis and interpretation of developing events.”\n\nAll well and good, except it’s not the analysis that irritates, but the non-stop blather.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
