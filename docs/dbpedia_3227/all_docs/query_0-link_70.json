I wanted to do a fundraiser T-shirt to raise money to travel to California for the world championships in 1998. This shot with \"Real Underwater Hockey\" or something like that. \n\t\n\tI borrowed the field hockey gear from a workmate (who I had many great conversations about what \"real\" hockey actually was).  What I didn't really think about was just how totally and utterly buoyant this gear was!  Absolutely no hope of getting underwater in this gear!\n\t\n\tThe photo was taken by a good friend of mine, Garry Davidson, who sadly passed away last year.  Taken at the Glenorchy Pool near Hobart, Tasmania.  After a hard training session, we spent quite a bit of time getting the shot right - lighting was tricky, I was stuck to the surface, and we used good old slide film (so we basically had no idea whether it worked or not).\n\t\n\tI never used the image however - I used an action uwh image of a friend of mine and sold enough at the world championships to have a little bit of spending money.",
