        "text": "WHEREAS, prior to 1941, there had never been a Black/African American U. S. Military Pilot; and\n\nWHEREAS, the famed Tuskegee Airmen were change agents when this mode of history was changed after the U.S. Congress directed the Army Air Corps to form an all-Black combat unit; and\n\nWHEREAS, in the summer of 1941, a group of Black airmen began training pursuant to the advocacy of the NAACP at the Tuskegee Air Field, under the command of Captain Benjamin 0. Davis, Jr.; and\n\nWHEREAS, although the Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black/African American military aviators in the U. S. Armed Forces, they were rejected due to racially motivated ideology, and subjected to racial discrimination at ali levels; and\n\nWHEREAS, despite these major adversities, the Tuskegee Airmen trained and flew with accuracy, skill, distinction and honor, thereby contributing sustainably in securing America's peace and freedom during World War II; and\n\nWHEREAS, many prominent civil rights organizations, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) were primary advocates in addressing the blatant discriminatory practices lodged against the Tuskegee Airmen. However, this popular group of American pilots maintained their dignity and aviation precision as they displayed their commitment and dedication to a free America; and\n\nWHEREAS, the Alabama State Conference of NAACP, during its recently scheduled Quarterly Conference, duly recognized the Tuskegee Airmen, reflecting upon the \"Red Tails\"-Tuskegee Viewing on the campus of Tuskegee University. The movie \"Red Tails\" opened in theaters across the country on January 20, 2012 and presented Hollywood's version of the Famed Tuskegee Airmen.\n\nTHEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that in recognition of this \"Legacy of Success,\" the NAACP encourages its Units (Local, State, and Regional) to develop, plan, and implement an appropriate Program of Expression in Honor and Recognition of the Tuskegee Airmen; and\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that surviving Tuskegee Airmen in the local area and vicinity of a unit will be notified of such program recognition and formally invited to attend; and"
