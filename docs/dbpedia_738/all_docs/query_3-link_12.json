        "text": "Davis was born on December 18, 1912, in Washington, D.C. His father, Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., was the first African American to become a general in any branch of the U.S. military. The younger Davis grew up in Alabama and in Cleveland, Ohio. He was president of his high school class and studied at Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University) in Ohio and at the University of Chicago. Davis then entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, in 1932. He graduated, with honors, in 1936 and was the first African American to graduate from West Point in the 1900s.\n\nIn 1941 Davis was among the first group of African Americans admitted to the Army Air Corps and to pilot training. Two years later he organized and commanded the Tuskegee Airmen. By the end of the war Davis had flown 60 combat missions and had been promoted to colonel.\n\nDavis helped plan the desegregation of the air force in 1948. Until that time African Americans and whites did not serve in the same units. Davis then commanded a group of fighter pilots in the Korean War. In 1954 he was promoted to general. He earned his second and third general stars in 1959 and 1965, respectively. Davis retired from the air force in 1970 and then served in the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\nIn 1991 Davis published his autobiography, Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., American. He was awarded his fourth general’s star in 1998, making him a general of the highest order within the U.S. military. He was the first African American to be so honored in retirement. Davis died on July 4, 2002, in Washington, D.C."
