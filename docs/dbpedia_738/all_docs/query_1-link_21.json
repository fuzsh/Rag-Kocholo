        "text": "October 27, 1954: Following in his father’s military footsteps, Benjamin O. Davis Jr. became the first African-American general in the U.S. Air Force. In 1943, he organized and commanded the unit of all African-American pilots, the Tuskegee Airmen, flying 60 combat missions, receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service. Five years later, he helped plan the desegregation of the Air Force. During the Korean War, he commanded a fighter wing. In 1998, President Bill Clinton promoted him to full general in honor of his service. He died in 2002.\n\nOctober 27, 1924: Actress Ruby Dee was born in Cleveland. Starting in the 1940s, she acted on Broadway, in movies and on television. She and her late husband and fellow actor, Ossie Davis, were active in the civil rights movement and were friends with both Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Davis delivered the eulogy at Malcolm X’s funeral. In 2007, she became the second oldest woman to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the movie, American Gangster.\n\nOctober 28, 1798: Abolitionist Levi Coffin was born in North Carolina. His home in Newport, Ind., became known as the “Grand Central Station of the Underground Railroad.” The network of abolitionists and others helped thousands of slaves find freedom.\n\nOctober 28, 2009: President Barack Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. The legislation provided additional penalties for those who commit violence based on sexual orientation, race, religion, gender, national origin, disability or gender identity.\n\nOctober 29, 1869: Klansmen abducted and savagely beat Georgia legislator Abram Colby, leaving him for dead. Three years later, Colby, a former slave and member of the Georgia legislature, testified before a joint House and Senate committee investigating reports of Southern violence.\n\nOctober 29, 1947: The Presidential Committee on Civil Rights recommended the creation of a Civil Rights Division in the Department of Justice, a permanent national civil rights division, federal legislation to punish lynchings, secure voting rights and abolish segregation in interstate transportation.\n\nOctober 29, 1968: In an 8-0 decision in Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the immediate desegregation of 33 Mississippi school districts.\n\nOctober 30, 1954: The Department of Defense announced the armed forces had been fully desegregated — seven years after President Truman had instructed the Secretary of Defense to “take steps to have the remaining instances of discrimination in the armed services eliminated as rapidly as possible.”\n\nOctober 30, 1967: Martin Luther King Jr. and seven other clergymen were jailed for four days in Birmingham, Ala. They served sentences on contempt-of-court charges stemming from Easter 1963 demonstrations they had led against discrimination. Public Safety Commissioner Eugene “Bull” Connor had twice denied them a parade permit. Two years later, the law was declared unconstitutional.\n\nOctober 31, 1950: Earl Lloyd became the first of three African Americans (Chuck Cooper and Nat Clifton were the other two) to play in the National Basketball Association. Lloyd and Jim Tucker went on to become the first African Americans to play on a championship team in 1955 as the Syracuse Nationals (now the Philadelphia 76ers). After retiring as a player, Lloyd served as an assistant coach and scout.\n\nNovember 1, 1890: Mississippi adopted a new state constitution aimed at keeping African Americans from voting through poll taxes, literacy tests and other means. Many other states followed Mississippi’s lead.\n\nNovember 1, 1960: All interstate buses were required to display a certificate that read: “Seating aboard this vehicle is without regard to race, color, creed, or national origin, by order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.” That same day, SNCC workers Charles Sherrod and Cordell Reagon as well as nine Chatmon Youth Council members tested new ICC rules at Trailways bus station in Albany, Ga.\n\nNovember 2, 1875: The Mississippi Plan of 1875, which included violence against African Americans to keep them from voting, resulted in huge victories for white Democrats across the state. John R. Lynch, the last African-American congressman for Mississippi until the 1986 election of Mike Espy, wrote: “It was a well-known fact that in 1875 nearly every Democratic club in the State was converted into an armed military company.” A federal grand jury concluded: “Fraud, intimidation, and violence perpetrated at the last election is without a parallel in the annals of history.”\n\nNovember 2, 1954: Charles C. Diggs became Michigan’s first African-American Congressman when he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Diggs went on to help found the Congressional Black Caucus and acted as its first chairman.\n\nNovember 2, 1983: President Ronald Reagan signed a bill creating a federal holiday to honor Martin Luther King Jr. on the third Monday in January. Six million signed a petition in favor of the holiday."
