        "text": "Loading...\n\nTuskegee Airmen Definition: The Tuskegee Airmen is the popular name of the first all-black military pilot group who fought in World War Two. The group formed the 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces. In terms of group size, there were a total of 932 pilots who graduated from the program. Among these, 355 served in active duty during World War Two as fighter pilots.\n\nThe group distinguished itself even before the war ended.\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...\n\nOn January 6th, 1945, the 485th’s commanding officer, Colonel John P. “Jack” Tomhave wrote a letter of appreciation to Major E. D. Jones, Jr., commander of the Tuskegee Airmen’s 366th Air Service Squadron:\n\nDear Major Jones,\n\nOn behalf of the Officers and Enlisted Men of the 485th Bombardment Group, I want to personally thank you for the courtesy and assistance which you and the personnel of the 366th Air Service Squadron so splendidly offered to our crews which landed at your base on 29 December 1944. I fully realize what an inconvenience this forced landing must have made on your facilities, and the remarkable manner in which you people of the 15th Fighter Command rose to the situation is all the more commendable.\n\nThe very able assistance which your Service Squadron has given to the 332nd Fighter Group is well known, and now you have proven yourselves just as capable in servicing our heavy bombers.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n/s/ Jack P. Tomhave\n\nJack P. Tomhave,\n\nColonel, Air Corps,\n\nCommanding\n\nThis article is part of our collection historical resources on the Tuskegee Airmen.
