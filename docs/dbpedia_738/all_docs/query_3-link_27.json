        "text": "Military service is a tradition in some families, with sons following the paths of their fathers and sometimes grandfathers in choosing a military career.\n\nIt is a devotion to duty that leads many sons to follow in the footsteps of their elders to serve in the military, especially when that dedication results in multiple family members being recognized as outstanding servicemen, even in spite of prejudice and other challenges.\n\nSuch is the story of General Benjamin Davis, Sr. and his son General Benjamin Davis, Jr. who were the first and second African American servicemen to hold the star rank of General in the United States military.\n\nBenjamin O. Davis, Sr. – First African American General\n\nIn the early days of American military history, it was unheard of for African Americans to be recognized by the military through promotion to higher levels of command.\n\nLike many of the black Americans serving in the military with him, Benjamin Davis, Sr. entered the Army as only a temporary first lieutenant in 1898 during the Spanish-American war but then re-enlisted in military service as a private after his discharge in 1899.\n\nHe remained in the military for another two years, after which in 1901 he was commissioned a Second Lieutenant of the Cavalry, a promotion that began his long eventual path to military success.\n\nThroughout his lengthy military career, General Davis, Sr. remained devoted to America and its forces by serving in various roles including serving as a Second Lieutenant with the 10th Calvary Regiment, Troop F (Buffalo Soldiers) in the Philippines during the Philippine-American War.\n\nAs a side note, then-Colonel Davis, Sr. was one of the officers who participated in the pilgrimages of World War I Gold Star mothers and widows during the summer months from 1930 to 1933 to various burial places of beloved husbands and sons in Europe.\n\nDuring his career, his leadership skills were rewarded as he was promoted to First Lieutenant in 1905, Captain in 1915, temporary Major in 1917, Lieutenant Colonel in 1920, Colonel in 1930, and finally to Brigadier General in 1940.\n\nBenjamin O. Davis, Jr. Follows In His Father’s Path\n\nLike his father, Benjamin Davis, Jr. chose to make the military his lifelong career, beginning with his enrollment in West Point.\n\nAs the first black man to be accepted to the Academy since reconstruction and only the fourth black graduate, Davis, Jr. was basically shunned and isolated throughout his time there by cadets and staff alike.\n\nHe graduated 35th in his class of 276 Cadets and at that time in 1936 was one of only two commissioned black officers in the Army who weren’t chaplains, the other one being his father Colonel Benjamin Davis, Sr.\n\nDavis, Jr. had a goal to join the Army Air Corps and become a pilot; however, the Corps was unwilling to accept black men into flight training at that time.\n\nThat all changed when Davis, Sr. was elevated to Brigadier General in 1940, a promotion that positively affected the careers of countless black military members.\n\nPublic Law 18 Changes Everything\n\nIn 1939, President Roosevelt ordered that the Air Corps create a flying organization for colored service members to train those seeking that training.\n\nPreviously enlisted in the all-black 24th infantry when the Air Corps refused his application, Davis, Jr. ended up teaching military tactics at Tuskegee Institute, a mostly-black college.\n\nHis father had actually held this position, one that the military used to avoid promoting African Americans to higher Army positions.\n\nWhen Roosevelt’s order came about, Davis was able to enter cadet training for the Air Corps, after which he became the first Captain of what would become the famous Tuskegee Airmen.\n\nWhile rising through the ranks was no easier for Davis, Jr. than it had been for his father, he likewise persevered through an illustrious military career.\n\nWorld War II and the 99th Fighter Squadron\n\nDavis, Jr. was the first black Air Corps member to fly solo and was soon elevated to Lieutenant Colonel and then named Commander of the 99th Pursuit Squadron, the first all-black Air Corps squadron that was assembled and later assigned as the 99th Fighter Squadron during WWII, primarily serving as bomber escorts.\n\nThrough years of successfully leading the 99th Fighter Squadron and the 332nd Fighter Group on important combat missions, Col. Davis, Jr. became a respected leader in the Air Corps and was instrumental in the integration of the Air Corps into the United States Air Force.\n\nHe later served at the Pentagon, saw even more active duty in the Korean War, and was promoted to temporary Major General in 1959, then Brigadier General in 1960.\n\nAfter his retirement from active service in 1970, Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. was promoted by President Clinton in 1998 to U.S. Air Force General (Retired)."
