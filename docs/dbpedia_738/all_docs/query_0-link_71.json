Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., former professor of military science and tactics at Tuskegee University, commanded the Squadron. The team of aviators, including 42 officers and 287 enlisted personnel, departed April 2 for Camp Shanks, N.Y., en route to Casablanca, Morocco, North Africa. They arrived on April 24, 1943.\n\nThe Squadron moved from North Africa to Sicily, then to Foggia, Italy on Oct. 17, 1943. There the Airmen joined Col. Earl E. Bates, Jr., Commanding Officer of the 79th (White) Fighter Group who integrated the 99th Fighter Squadron. The Airmen remained with the 79th over Anzio in 1944.\n\nThe Airmen's success during World War II – not losing a single bomber to enemy fire in more than 200 combat missions – is a record unmatched by any other fighter group.\n\nTheir exemplary combat performance, including the destruction of 260 enemy aircraft, earned them more than 850 medals and persuaded then-U.S. President Harry S. Truman in 1948 to issue Executive Order 9981, desegregating the U.S. Military.\n\nOfficers of the 99th Fighter Squadron included:\n\nNAME RANK CLASS DUTIES HOMETOWN Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. Lt.
