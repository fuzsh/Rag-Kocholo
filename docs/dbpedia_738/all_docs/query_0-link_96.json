        "text": "Facts About the Tuskegee Airmen\n\nThe Tuskegee Airmen were dedicated and determined young men who volunteered to become America's first African-American military airmen\n\nAviation cadets were only accepted for training if they possessed the physical and mental qualifications - they then became pilots, bombardiers, or navigators\n\nThe U.S. Army Air Corps awarded Tuskegee University a contract to help train America's first Black military aviators - it had already invested in the development of an airfield, had a proven civilian pilot training program, and its graduates performed highest on flight aptitude exams\n\nMoton Field is named after Tuskegee University's second President, Dr. Robert R. Moton who served with distinction from 1915-1935 - The Airmen were deployed during the administration of president Dr. Frederick Douglas Patterson (1935-1953)\n\nThe African-American 332nd Fighter Group consisted of four fighter squadrons, the 99th, the 100th, the 301st, and the 302nd.\n\nAround 1,000 Black pilots were trained at Tuskegee from 1941-1946,\n\nThe Airmen succeeded in escorting bombers during WWII and had one of the lowest loss records of all the escort fighter groups - they were in high demand for their services by the allied bomber units - this is a record unmatched by any other fighter group\n\nBefore joining the 332nd Fighter Group, the 99th Squadron distinguished itself by being awarded two Presidential Unit Citations (June-July 1943 and May 1944) for outstanding tactical air support and aerial combat in the 12th Air Force in Italy\n\nThe 332nd Fighter group received the Presidential Unit Citation for the longest bomber escort mission to Berlin on March 24, 1945 - the Tuskegee Airmen (then known as the 'Red Tails') destroyed three German ME-262 jet fighters and damaged five additional jet fighters during this mission\n\nThe 332nd Fighter Group distinguished itself in June 1944 when two of its pilots flying P-47 Thunderbolts discovered a German destroyer in the harbor of Trieste, Italy\n\nThe bomber escort cover provided by the 332nd \"Red Tail\" fighters often stopped enemy fighter pilots from attacking bombers escorted by the 332nd Fighter Group\n\nC. Alfred \"Chief\" Anderson earned his pilot's license in 1929 and became the first African American to receive a commercial pilot's certificate in 1932 as well as make a transcontinental flight\n\nAnderson is well known as the pilot who convinced Eleanor Roosevelt to encourage her husband FDR to authorize military flight training at Tuskegee\n\nPresident Harry Truman enacted Executive Order No. 9981 which directed quality of treatment and opportunity in the United States Armed Forces ultimately leading to the end of racial segregation in the U.S. military forces\n\nIn 1998, the U.S. Congress authorized $29 million to develop the Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site with the University, Tuskegee Airmen Inc., and the National Park Service serving as partners in its development - a mere $3.6 million has been appropriated for the Site's implementation ever since\n\nThese facts are provided by Tuskegee Airmen Inc. and the Tuskegee University Office of Marketing and Communications .\n\nThe Tuskegee Airmen were credited by higher commands with Awards and decorations that include:\n\nOver 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses to 95 Airmen; Captain William A. Campbell was awarded two.\n\n14 Bronze Stars (Fourth highest military decoration)\n\n744 Air Medals\n\n1578 combat missions, 1267 for the Twelfth Air Force; 311 for the Fifteenth Air Force\n\n179 bomber escort missions, with a good record of protection, losing bombers on only seven missions and a total of only 27, compared to an average of 46 among other 15th Air Force P-51 groups\n\n112 enemy aircraft destroyed in the air, another 150 on the ground, and 148 damaged\n\n950 rail cars, trucks, and other motor vehicles destroyed (over 600 rail cars)"
