General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.

“When somebody asks, ‘Who were the Tuskegee Airmen?’ Just a bunch of good old red-blooded American boys who went out there and did their job and did it well without any expectation of recognition or fanfare. We just did it. Did what we had to do. And we’re proud of it.” – Donald Elder, Army Air Corps, World War II.

Benjamin Oliver Davis, Jr. was a commander of the World War II Tuskegee Airmen and the first African American brigadier general in the United States Air Force. Davis commanded the 99th Fighter Squadron and the 332nd Fighter Group, which escorted bombers on air combat missions over Europe. He flew 60 missions and was one of the first African American pilots to see combat. In July 1948, when President Truman signed Executive Order 9981, at the time, Colonel Davis helped draft the Air Force plan for implementing this order. The Air Force was the first of the services to integrate fully. Davis followed in his father’s footsteps in breaking racial barriers, as Benjamin O. Davis Sr. was the first African American general in the U.S. Army.
