Benjamin O. Davis Jr. was the commander of the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of African-American fighter and bomber pilots who served in World War II. He also became the first African-American general in the United States Air Force; his father, Benjamin O. Davis Sr., was the first African-American general in the US Army.

In 1941, the War Department was instructed to create an African-American flying unit. Pilots were trained at Tuskegee Army Air Field and so became known as the Tuskegee Airmen. Davis was a member of the first training class and soon was named commander of the 99th Pursuit Squadron, the first all African-American air unit. He also commanded the 332nd Fighter Group, which was known as the Red Tails due to the distinctive red markings on its planes.

Benjamin O. Davis Jr. flew sixty missions in P-39, Curtiss P-40, P-47, and P-51 Mustang fighters. He was decorated with the Silver Star for a strafing run into Austria and received the Distinguished Flying Cross for a bomber-escort mission to Munich. Davisâ€™ airmen flew more than 15,000 sorties, shot down 112 enemy planes, and destroyed or damaged 273 aircraft on the ground.

God bless!
