Benjamin O. Davis Jr. (1912-2002) was a pioneering military leader and civil rights activist. The son of the first African-American general in the U.S. Army, Davis Jr. entered the military in 1932 and rose through the ranks despite facing racism and discrimination.

During World War II, he commanded the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of African-American pilots who helped shatter stereotypes about black military capability.

After the war, Davis continued to break down barriers, becoming the first African-American general in the Air Force and working to promote integration.

AVI-8 is proud to be releasing the next chapter in our partnership with the Tuskegee Airmen Inc. The unique limited edition features a unique tribute to both the men and the machines flown by the heroes of Tuskegee. With proceeds going to support the important work of the TAI.

We have looked to create a complete timepiece filled with detail, art and character. Working with our watch designers, and famed artist Derrick Whitfield, we've looked to create a special collectable watch that stands as an always wearable reminder of the heroism of the Tuskegee Airmen.

Each of the four colorways is available in 310 or less uniquely numbered pieces for a total exclusive production run of only 1,195 pieces. Each colorway is detailed to reflect one of the 4 original squadrons (99th, 100th, 301st and 302nd) that together comprises the all-Black, 332nd Fighter Group.
