        "text": "On April 23, Academician Howard Y. Chang was elected Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and on April 27 was elected Member of the National Academy of Sciences. Both honors are in recognition of his contributions to research on noncoding RNAs, genomes, and regenerative medicine.\n\nDr. Chang is currently serving at Stanford University. His discoveries in long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) are considered significant breakthroughs following the discovery of the DNA sequence. Moreover, his pioneering methods of identifying key regulators in large-scale transcriptional programs have been successfully applied in developmental biology, cancer, and aging studies.\n\nDr. Chang was elected Member of the National Academy of Medicine in 2017, and has received numerous honors, including the NAS Award in Molecular Biology, and the Paul Marks Prize for Cancer Research awarded by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. His research was also selected as 1 of 25 Cell Landmark Papers published in 1974-2014. Apart from teaching in the U.S., Dr. Chang serves as Distinguished Chair Professor at the Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine at National Taiwan University. Dr. Chang was elected Academia Sinica Academician in 2016."
