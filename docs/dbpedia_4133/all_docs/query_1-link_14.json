        "text": "National Academy of Sciences announced on January 24, 2022, that Carrie Partch Ph.D., Professor of chemistry & biochemistry at UC-Santa Cruz, has received an Award in Molecular Biology, recognizing a “recent notable discovery in molecular biology by a young scientist who is a citizen of the US.”\n\nCarrie Partch Ph.D. is an alumna of Biochemistry and Biophysics and the Aziz Sancar lab.\n\nPartch’s transformative work has shed light on the protein-based signaling mechanisms and structural assemblies that give rise to circadian rhythms.\n\nPartch’s studies reveal protein dynamics and interactions at the core of molecular circadian timing mechanisms in both mammals and in cyanobacteria. Her unique approach to the field combining biochemistry, molecular biophysics, and structural biology has provided a deeper mechanistic understanding of how these clocks function at the molecular level.\n\nThe NAS Award in Molecular Biology is supported by Pfizer Inc. and recognizes a recent notable discovery by a young scientist who is a citizen of the United States. The award is presented with a medal and a $25,000 prize."
