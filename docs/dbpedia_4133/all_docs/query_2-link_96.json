        "text": "Eighty outstanding researchers, innovators and communicators from around the world have been elected as the newest Fellows of the Royal Society, the UK’s national academy of sciences and the oldest science academy in continuous existence.\n\nThey have been selected for their substantial contribution to the advancement of science, from the use of forensic techniques to identify victims of war crimes, to investigating processes in the Earth’s core, and mapping the world’s largest tropical peatlands in the Congo basin.\n\nSir Adrian Smith, President of the Royal Society said: “I am delighted to welcome our newest cohort of Fellows.\n\n“These individuals have pushed forward the boundaries of their respective fields and had a beneficial influence on the world beyond.\n\n“Among this year’s intake are individuals who were at the forefront of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and those working on global challenges, from TB to climate change. They are pioneering scientists and innovators from around the world who have confounded expectations and transformed our thinking.\n\n“This year’s intake have already achieved incredible things, and I have no doubt that they will continue to do so. I look forward to meeting them and following their contributions in future.”\n\nThis year sees 59 Fellows, 19 Foreign Members and two Honorary Fellows elected, reflecting changes introduced in 2023 which increased the maximum number who can be elected. This will help create a broader and more engaged Fellowship and support the Society’s mission of championing excellence in research and science for the benefit of humanity.\n\nThe Fellows and Foreign Members join the ranks of Stephen Hawking, Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, Lise Meitner, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Dorothy Hodgkin.\n\nStatistics about this year’s intake of Fellows:\n\n30% of this year’s intake of Fellows, Foreign Members and Honorary Fellows are women.\n\nNew Fellows have been elected from 20 UK institutions, including Manchester, Sussex, Exeter and Edinburgh.\n\nThey have been elected from countries including Japan, Finland, China and South Africa.\n\nThe full list of the newly elected Fellows and Foreign Members of the Royal Society is, in alphabetical order:\n\nNew Fellows\n\nProfessor Bashir M Al-Hashimi CBE FREng FRS\n\nVice President (Research & Innovation), King’s College London\n\nProfessor Judith Allen FMedSci FRS\n\nProfessor of Immunobiology, Faculty of Medicine, Biology and Health, University of Manchester\n\nProfessor Myles Allen CBE FRS\n\nProfessor of Geosystem Science, Environmental Change Institute, School of Geography and the Environment and Department of Physics, University of Oxford\n\nDame Sue Black, Baroness Black of Strome DBE FRS\n\nPresident, St John's College, Oxford\n\nProfessor Bradley Cairns FRS\n\nProfessor and Chair, Oncological Sciences, Spencer Eccles School of Medicine, University of Utah and Chief Academic Officer, Huntsman Cancer Institute, United States\n\nProfessor Keith Caldecott FMedSci FRS\n\nDeputy Director, Genome Damage and Stability Centre, University of Sussex\n\nProfessor Sir Ian Chapman FRS\n\nChief Executive Officer, United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority\n\nProfessor Bryan Charleston FRS\n\nDirector and CEO, Pirbright Institute\n\nProfessor Sourav Chatterjee FRS\n\nProfessor of Statistics, Department of Statistics, and Professor of Mathematics, Department of Mathematics, Stanford University, United States\n\nProfessor Cathie Clarke FRS\n\nProfessor of Theoretical Astrophysics, Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge\n\nProfessor Pieter Cullis OC FRS\n\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of British Columbia, Canada\n\nProfessor Andrew Davison FREng FRS\n\nProfessor of Robot Vision, Department of Computing, Imperial College London\n\nProfessor Michael Depledge CBE FRS\n\nEmeritus Professor of Environment and Human Health, European Centre for Environment and Human Health, University of Exeter Medical School\n\nProfessor W Ford Doolittle FRS\n\nProfessor Emeritus, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Canada\n\nProfessor Michael Dustin FRS\n\nKennedy Trust Professor of Molecular Immunology, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences and Director of Research, Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, University of Oxford\n\nProfessor Wendy Freedman FRS\n\nJohn and Marion Sullivan University Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Astronomy Department, University of Chicago, United States\n\nProfessor Huajian Gao FRS\n\nDistinguished University Professor, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore\n\nProfessor Julian William Gardner FREng FRS\n\nProfessor of Electronic Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Warwick\n\nDame Sarah Gilbert DBE FMedSci FRS\n\nSaid Professor of Vaccinology, Pandemic Sciences Institute, University of Oxford\n\nProfessor Andrey Golutvin FRS\n\nProfessor of Physics, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London\n\nProfessor Andrew Goodwin FRS\n\nProfessor of Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford\n\nProfessor Louise Heathwaite CBE FRS\n\nLancaster Environment Centre and Pro-Vice-Chancellor Research and Enterprise, Lancaster University\n\nProfessor Laura Heyderman FRS\n\nProfessor, Mesoscopic Systems, ETH Zurich -
