He has published some 300 scientific articles and books in fundamental physics, complex systems analysis, climate change research, sustainability science, and more. Schellnhuber is listed as a Highly Cited Researcher (Cross Field) by Clarivate.\n\nSince December 2023, Schellnhuber has been appointed as the twelfth Director General of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. Before this, Schellnhuber led the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) from 1992 to 2018 as their founding director and also served as research director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in Great Britain from 2001 to 2005.\n\nSince 2019, Schellnhuber has been focusing his scientific work and communication skills on the transformation of the built environment, with a specific emphasis on the climate restoration potential of regenerative architecture. In this context, he established Bauhaus Earth as a not-for-profit company and became a member of the High-Level Roundtable of the New European Bauhaus initiative.\n\nSchellnhuber is member of numerous learned societies, including the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, the German National Academy Leopoldina, the US National Academy of Sciences, the Academia Europaea, and the Academy of Athens. Throughout his career, Schellnhuber has received several notable awards, such as the German Environmental Prize (2007), the Volvo Environmental Prize (2011), the Blue Planet Prize (2017), and the Ratio et Spes Prize (2021). In 2022, Schellnhuber was also awarded the Honorary Edition of the German Sustainability Prize for his “enormous influence on science, politics, and business by developing and communicating sustainable solutions to the global environmental crisis”.\n\nSchellnhuber acted as a scientific advisor to a number of eminent public and religious leaders, including the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Commission Presidents José Manuel Barroso and Ursula von der Leyen, and Pope Francis. For 28 continuous years, he has served as a member and chair of the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) since its establishment in 1992. He contributed in various ways to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007.\n\nIn recognition of his achievements, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber received several prestigious honors, including being named a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II (2004). He was also awarded the Order of Merit of the State of Brandenburg (2008), the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2011) and the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon, of the Japanese Government (2020). In 2021, Schellnhuber received the Grand Cross of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany from President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and became Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur of the French Republic.\n\nAFFILIATION\n\nUniversity of Copenhagen, Denmark\n\nSUMMARY OF WINNING ENTRY\n\nDiscovering the role of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), paving the way to widely used treatments for diabetes and obesity and stimulating emerging applications for neurodegenerative diseases\n\nProfessor Jens Juul Holst is a pioneering scientist in the field of endocrinology and metabolism. Alongside Professor Joel Habener’s research team at Massachusetts General Hospital, Professor Jens Juul Holst’s team at the University of Copenhagen discovered the structure and role of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in regulating gastrointestinal motility and insulin levels. Stemming from the detection of GLP-1 in the intestines and pancreas of mammals in 1986, a year later, Professor Holst published breakthrough research on the discovery of a functional isoform of GLP-1, which is seven amino acids shorter in molecular structure, designated as proglucagon 78-107 or GLP-1 (7-36). The finding of the GLP-1 (7-36) isoform later led to the discovery of this peptide’s role in regulating insulin and glucose in humans, ushering in a new era of diabetes and obesity treatments based on GLP-1. Not only contributing to the determination of the biological rolse and drugs based on GLP-1, along with Prof. Carolyn Deacon và Daniel Joshua Drucker, Professor Holst also played a key role in discovering the dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 enzyme (DDP-4), which catalyzes the breakdown of GLP-1. From this discovery, a new line of drugs based on the mechanism of DDP-4 inhibition was developed, significantly improving the effectiveness of GLP-1 therapies by enhancing the drug’s lifespan in the body and increasing its stability and biological efficiency.\n\nSCALE OF IMPACT\n\nThese significant advancements related to the GLP-1 endocrine process have laid the foundation for powerful therapies for Type 2 diabetes, obesity and short bowel syndrome, impacting over 100 million people with type 2 diabetes, more than 1 billion individuals with obesity, and over 3 million with short bowel syndrome. In 2023, there were more than 20 million doses of GLP medication used globally. Additionally, the exploration of the physiological mechanism of GLPs has propelled the research and development of new treatments for cardiovascular diseases and many neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases, all of which being among the leading causes of death globally. In the case of Alzheimer’s disease, one of the most common neurodegenerative conditions, GLP-1 medication could slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease, offering new hope for over 55 million patients worldwide.\n\nMEANINGFUL CHANGE\n\nThe seminal work of Professor Daniel Johsua Drucker, Joel Francis Habener, Jens Juul Holst, and Svetlana Mojsov has brought breakthrough impacts to the fields of endocrinology, metabolism, and gastroenterology. The translation of their discoveries on GLP-1 and DDP-4 biology into clinical medical solutions has transformed treatment methods for various diseases, thereby contributing to building a healthier world. Their work is a testament to the transformative power of innovative scientific discovery and the potential of these discoveries in shaping treatment methods and healthcare solutions.\n\nAFFILIATION\n\nInternational Rice Research Institute, Philippines and University of California, Davis, USA\n\nSUMMARY OF WINNING ENTRY\n\nDiscovery and implementation of disease-resistant rice\n\nThe agricultural revolution was greatly propelled by the efforts of Professor Gurdev Singh Khush and Professor Xuan Vo-Tong in inventing and advancing disease-resistant rice varieties, contributing to the strengthening of global food security. Professor Khush pioneered in the development of many rice varieties, such as IR8, IR36, IR64…, which are resistant to numerous pests and diseases, have short mature time, and yield quality grains. The development of high-yielding rice varieties has revolutionized rice cultivation worldwide, enabling substantial increases in production while reducing costs and minimizing the reliance on harmful chemicals. Among these groundbreaking innovations, IR64, a variety developed by Professor Khush and researchers at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), stands out as a remarkable achievement. Its unique combination of intermediate amylose content, soft gel consistency, intermediate gelatinization temperature, translucency, and long slender grains has made it a highly sought-after variety, cultivated in almost all rice-producing countries. Beyond its standalone success, IR64 has also served as a parent strain for thousands of hybrid varieties, demonstrating its versatility and enduring impact on global food security.\n\nSCALE OF IMPACT\n\nBy the 1980s, the IR36 rice variety was globally adopted, cultivated on up to 11 million hectares. By 2000, the widespread dissemination of IR36 and other rice varieties significantly boosted rice yields with production increasing by 600 million tons.

Stemming from early calculations by Professor Mario Molina and Sherwood Rowland in 1974, the hypothesis about the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer garnered widespread scientific attention and underwent extensive research over the years. However, it wasn’t until 1986-1987 that this hypothesis was convincingly proved by Professor Solomon’s experiments in Antarctica, which gathered reliable evidence about a particularly large ozone hole caused by CFCs in this region. The experiments also confirmed her earlier hypothesis that the high density of stratospheric clouds in Antarctica created an electromagnetic attraction with CFCs. These experimental findings subsequently galvanized global efforts leading to the birth of the Montreal Protocol. This is one of the most successful international agreements in addressing global environmental issues, achieving worldwide consensus to phase out substances harmful to the ozone layer like CFCs. Furthermore, Solomon’s extensive explorations have also enriched our understanding of climate dynamics, focusing on atmospheric chemistry, climate feedback mechanisms, and human-induced changes to global temperatures. Her profound insights and influential leadership have sculpted scientific paradigms and international policies, contributing immensely to global environmental protection efforts.\n\nSCALE OF IMPACT\n\nIn 2016, Professor Solomon and her colleagues published results showing that the ozone hole had shrunk by more than 4 million square kilometers compared to its peak in 2000 and would fully recover in the coming decades. The implementation of the Montreal Protocol has also significantly reduced global greenhouse gas emissions. The most evident proof is that, between 1990-2010, the control measures of the Montreal Protocol has been estimated to help reduce emissions equivalent to 135 billion tons of CO2 – five times the annual target set by the Kyoto Protocol for the 2008-2012 period. Along with other climate change agreements, the Montreal Protocol has made a substantial contribution to the protection of the global climate system and is expected to prevent an additional 100-200 billion tons of CO2 emissions by 2050, potentially reducing the global temperature increase from 2-5°C to 0.5°C by 2100. In addition to environmental benefits, protecting the ozone layer also brings about significant health benefits. According to estimates from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, just within the its border, by 2100, the full implementation of the Montreal Protocol can prevent up to 443 million cases of skin cancer, reduce 2.3 million deaths from the disease, and prevent 63 million cataract cases.\n\nMEANINGFUL CHANGE\n\nProfessor Susan Solomon’s work had a transformative influence on atmospheric science and international environmental protocols. By proving and addressing urgent environmental issues, her work has brought about fundamental changes in the field of environmental protection and the reduction of climate change impacts. Moreover, the recovery of the ozone layer is fundamental for sustaining life on earth, making her contributions vital in the quest to preserve biodiversity and ecological balance.\n\nAFFILIATION\n\nKVI Holdings, Singapore\n\nSUMMARY OF WINNING ENTRY\n\nInvestigated electrochemical intercalation of graphite and the thermodynamics of the battery charging/discharging processes\n\nProfessor Rachid Yazami pioneered the exploration of reversible electrochemical intercalation of Lithium-ions into graphite, laying the foundation for the development of modern Lithium-ion batteries.
