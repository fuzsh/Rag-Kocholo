        "text": "The National Academies provide expert advice to the U.S. government on issues of science, health, and engineering and, today, comprise three private, nonprofit institutions: The National Academy of Sciences (NAS), National Academy of Engineering (NAE), and National Academy of Medicine (NAM). The NAS is the oldest of these, established by the U.S. Congress in 1863.\n\nMembership to the Academies is considered one of the highest honors bestowed to a U.S. scientist. Below is a list of the many IRP scientists, past and present, elected to the NAS. Click to view our list of NAM members and NAE members.\n\nCurrent IRP scientists elected to the NAS (year of election):\n\nThomas Kunkel (2024).
