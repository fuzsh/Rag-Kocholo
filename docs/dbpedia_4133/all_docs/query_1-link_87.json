        "text": "UF Faculty in the National Academy of Sciences:\n\nElection Year: 2022\n\nNAS Section: Biological Sciences\n\nResearch/Expertise: An Eminent Scholar in Biology and the Arthur R. Marshall, Jr., Chair in Ecological Studies, Holt is known for research in theoretical and conceptual ecology, as well as the intersection of ecology and evolutionary biology.\n\nLinda M. Bartoshuk\n\nElection Year: 2003\n\nNAS Section: Psychology\n\nResearch/Expertise: Bartoshuk is a leading psychologist who studies the genetic variation in taste perception, oral pain, and taste disorders. She has demonstrated that inhibitory processes underlie normal and abnormal tastes, and that individual human taste differences are based on an incomplete dominant gene. She has also shown that those who experience the most intense taste have an especially large number of fungiform papaillae on their tongue.\n\nKenneth Berns (Retired)\n\nElection Year: 1995\n\nNAS Section: Microbial Biology\n\nResearch/Expertise: molecular biology of adeno-associated virus, AAV as a vector for gene therapy Citation: Berns has pioneered research on the mechanism of viral replication. He has been a major contributor to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying replication of single-stranded viral DNA, the integration of viral DNA into the host-cell genome, and viral latency.\n\nRobert Cousins\n\nElection Year: 2000\n\nNAS Section: Animal, Nutritional, and Applied Microbial Sciences\n\nResearch/Expertise: nutritional biochemistry and genomics, Zinc metabolism, transport and function, Zinc metallobiochemistry\n\nCitation: Cousins is internationally recognized as a leading authority and investigator of zinc nutrition, metabolism, and function. He defined the hormonal and nutritional factors that regulate zinc metabolism at the cellular and molecular level and thereby significantly improved our understanding of the biological, nutritional, and clinical importance of this micronutrient.\n\nRoy Curtiss, III\n\nElection Year: 2001\n\nNAS Section: Animal, Nutritional, and Applied Microbial Sciences\n\nResearch/Expertise: I endeavor to understand the genetic and biochemical bases of pathogenicity of Salmonella typhimurium, S. typhi, S. paratyphi A, and Escherichia coli. Emphasis is on understanding the genetic control over persistence in and transmissibility from the ambient environment, attachment to and persistence on eukaryotic surfaces (colonization), invasion of and persistence and multiplication in tissues, and host specificity. Studies are in progress to understand how genes for virulence properties are regulated in response to ambient environmental stresses and to different compartments in the infected eukaryotic host. Other studies use attenuated Salmonella strains expressing virulence determinants (i.e., protective antigens) from other pathogens as vectors to home to the nasal-, bronchial- and gut-associated lymphoid tissues and induce mucosal, systemic, and cellular immunity to the pathogen whose virulence antigens are expressed by the recombinant vaccine strain. Research to improve these recombinant attenuated Salmonella antigen and DNA vaccine delivery vectors is in progress to either enhance Th1-dependent cellular immune responses or Th2-dependent humoral and mucosal immune responses. Vaccines are being designed with biological containment features to preclude their survival in nature. Various cell types, animals, and humans are used for the analysis of virulence, the immune response, and protective immunity.\n\nDavid Green (Retired)\n\nElection Year: 1978\n\nNAS Section: Psychology\n\nResearch/Expertise: psychoacoustics, detection theory\n\nArt Hebard\n\nElection Year: 2017\n\nNAS Section:\n\nLonnie Ingram\n\nElection Year: 2001\n\nNAS Section: Animal, Nutritional, and Applied Microbial Sciences\n\nCitation: Ingram is a world authority on genetically altering the metabolism of microbes so that they effectively convert plant materials into renewable fuels. His genetic engineering of bacteria to efficiently transform the waste materials of various crops into ethanol was a major achievement. The commercial use of Ingram's altered bacteria has become a model for emerging environmentally friendly bio-refineries that are reducing world dependence on petroleum.\n\nHarry J. Klee\n\nElection Year: 2012\n\nProfessor, Eminent Scholar, and Dickman Chair for Tomato Improvement, department of horticultural sciences and plant molecular and cellular biology program.\n\nMichael Moseley\n\nElection Year: 2000\n\nNAS Section: Anthropology\n\nResearch/Expertise: Andes, geoarchaeology, natural disaster\n\nCitation: Our current view of Andean civilization has been significantly shaped by Moseley's broad and wide-ranging research. From the origins of sedentary life to the origins of urbanism, from the effects of tectonic changes on human life to man's modifications of the ecosystem, Moseley has provided us with crucial insights.\n\nNeil Opdyke (Deceased)\n\nElection Year: 1996\n\nNAS Section: Geology\n\nCitation: Opdyke's pioneering studies of the Earth's ancient magnetic field confirmed the hypothesis of continental drift and provided insight into the timing of mammalian evolution and migration, and into the nature of paleoclimatic conditions. His study of geomagnetic reversals in deep sea cores led to the theory of plate tectonics.\n\nPedro A. Sanchez\n\nElection Year: 2012\n\nNAS Section: Human Environmental Sciences\n\nBurton H. Singer\n\nElection Year: 1994\n\nNAS Section: Social and Political Sciences\n\nCitation: Singer's work has altered the ways in which quantitative studies of economic, social, and epidemiological processes are carried out to determine causal mechanisms and associations. His recognition of methodological problems, especially regarding effects of population heterogeneity and selectivity, and recommendations for new approaches influence investigations of longitudinal and duration data\n\nDouglas Soltis\n\nElection Year: 2017\n\nNAS Section: Plant Biology\n\nPamela Soltis\n\nElection Year: 2016\n\nNAS Section: Plant Biology\n\nPhilip Teitelbaum (Retired)\n\nElection Year: 1974\n\nNAS Section: Psychology\n\nJohn Terborgh\n\nElection Year: 1989\n\nNAS Section: Environmental Sciences and Ecology\n\nJ. G. Thompson (Retired)\n\nElection Year: 1971\n\nNAS Section: Mathematics\n\nClifford M. Will\n\nElection year: 2007\n\nNAS Section: Physics\n\nCitation: Will invented experimental tests to confirm that general relativity is the correct classical theory of gravity. He is well-known for his computations of gravitational waveforms from coalescing neutron-star and black-hole binaries, which form the foundations of gravitational wave searches.\n\nElizabeth Wing (Retired)\n\nElection Year: 2006\n\nNAS Section: Environmental Archaeology\n\nElection Year: 1976\n\nNAS Section: Animal, Nutritional, and Applied Microbial Sciences"
