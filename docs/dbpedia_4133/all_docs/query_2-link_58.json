        "text": "The two graduate research awards administered through the Office of Research described below require nomination by the Graduate Coordinator.\n\nJames L. Carmon Scholarship\n\nThe James L. Carmon Scholarship is an academic year scholarship awarded to a graduate student whose dissertation/thesis research reflects state-of-the-art utilization of computer and/or networking technology in the sciences or creative arts. It is in memory of Dr. James L. Carmon, a UGA faculty member for 36 years, who helped advance computer research and development at the university.\n\nDepartments may nominate up to two candidates through their graduate coordinators.\n\nDeadline for nominations to be received by the Office of Research: Third Tuesday in September, which is September 17, 2024 for the 2024-2025 cycle.\n\nThe detailed guidelines can be found here.\n\nGraduate Coordinators should submit nominations through UGA’s InfoReady Portal via the James L. Carmon Scholarship – Nomination Form for Graduate Coordinators.\n\nRobert C. Anderson Memorial Award\n\nAs a memorial to Dr. Robert C. Anderson, former Vice President for Research and President of the University of Georgia Research Foundation, Inc., two awards to recent graduates of the University of Georgia Graduate School are made annually. Usually, although not necessarily, one award is made in the natural sciences and one in any other field. This award reflects an outstanding record of research accomplishment carried out as part of a candidate’s graduate studies and during the period immediately following receipt of the terminal degree.\n\nUniversity of Georgia graduate students who have received their terminal degree no more than two years prior to the award year are eligible for nomination. For example, anyone that has already graduated in 2023 or 2024 is eligible to be nominated in the November 2024 deadline.\n\nDeadline for nominations to be received by the Office of Research: November 1, 2024.\n\nThe detailed guidelines can be found here.\n\nNominations are made by the nominee’s major professor and graduate coordinator. Graduate Coordinators should submit nominations through UGA’s InfoReady Portal via the Robert C. Anderson Memorial Award – Nomination Form for Graduate Coordinators.\n\nPlease note that the submission forms are to be used by Graduate Coordinators (or a designated staff program assistant) to submit nominees for their department. Graduate Coordinators (or a designated staff program assistant) should click “Nominate Candidate” and log-in to InfoReady with their UGA MyID and password.\n\nCrystal Turner has been named one of UGA’s 2022 recipients of the Ed Wilker Memorial Egalitarian Award. The honor is awarded to staff and faculty members who encourage diversity and occupational excellence in their work. Turner joined UGA in June 2021as a grants accounting specialist in the Sponsored Projects Administration.\n\nI would rework this along the lines of “Turner joined UGA in [month and year] as a grants accounting specialist in Sponsored Projects Administration.”\n\n“It was really surprising when I got the email; it’s just an honor that people thought so highly of me to nominate me for something like this,” Turner said. “I feel like I still have a lot to learn in my role and as a part of UGA, but I view this as a steppingstone and sign that I’m heading in the right direction.”\n\nTurner views the award as a way to promote equality and service within the UGA community. It serves as an encouragement for people who might be at a difficult point in their career.\n\n“It shows people that everyone deserves equal chances, no matter their ethnicity or race or where they come from,” Turner said.\n\nTurner was recognized at the Black Faculty and Staff Organization Luncheon on Sept. 21."
