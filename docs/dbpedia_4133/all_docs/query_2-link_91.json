        "text": "Dr. Kathryn Sullivan is a distinguished scientist, astronaut, explorer and author of Handprints on Hubble: An Astronaut’s Story of Invention.\n\n“The scale, the immensity, and power of our planet and its systems are very impressive, no two ways about it. It’s extraordinary. At the same time, my perspectives have taught me that every one of the systems of our planet, the geological, the biological, the forest, the trees, the air, the water, the ocean — things we tend to think of as separate —are really, richly, pervasively interconnected,” said Dr. Kathryn Sullivan.\n\nDr. Sullivan began her career in oceanography, then joined NASA’s astronaut corps in 1978, where she became the first American woman to walk in space. During her 15 years with NASA, Dr. Sullivan flew on three space shuttle missions, including the mission that deployed the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990. Following her tenure at NASA, Dr. Sullivan held senior executive positions with Ohio’s Center of Science and Industry (COSI), Ohio State University’s Battelle Center for Science and Technology Policy, and Presidential appointments to the National Science Board and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). She currently serves on a number of corporate and non-profit boards and is a Senior Fellow with the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies, an independent non-profit public policy research institute in Virginia. In 2019, Sullivan published “Handprints on Hubble: An Astronaut’s Story of Invention,” in which she describes her work on the team that launched, rescued, repaired, and maintained the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n“We are thrilled to honor Dr. Sullivan for her work with NASA and NOAA. In addition to being an accomplished astronaut, Dr. Sullivan led NOAA with the focus on environmental research in order to better understand the changing environment here on Earth and beyond,” said Kumud Acharya, Ph.D., President of DRI. “While at NOAA, Dr. Sullivan shaped the notion of environmental intelligence, as she calls it, to create timely, accurate, and actionable environmental information to drive decisions about our changing climate.”\n\nThe Desert Research Institute (DRI) proudly announces the selection of Dr. Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences and chair of the National Research Council, as its 2017 DRI Nevada Medalist.\n\nEstablished in 1988 to acknowledge outstanding achievement in the fields of science and engineering, the DRI Nevada Medal is the highest scientific honor in the state. The 30th DRI Nevada Medal award will be presented by the DRI Foundation during events planned in Reno and Las Vegas in September, 2017.\n\nA distinguished geophysicist, Dr. McNutt’s research focuses on marine geophysics, where she has published more than 100 peer-reviewed scientific articles and helped develop a variety of remote sensing techniques to understand the origin of clusters of volcanoes in the middle of tectonic plates.. From 2013 to 2016, she served as editor-in-chief of the Science family of journals, prior to which she served as director of the U.S. Geological Survey from 2009 to 2013, during which time USGS responded to a number of major disasters, including the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\n\n“I am grateful for the recognition of the Nevada Medal not just for all that it means to me personally, but also because it validates the concept that one can forego one’s own personal research career and still have impact through leadership and service to science and the nation,” said Dr. McNutt.\n\nAs the first female president of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), an independent organization conceived by President Abraham Lincoln and chartered by Congress with providing independent, objective advice to the nation on matters related to science and technology, McNutt serves on the forefront of science education and communication to the highest levels in US government.\n\nBefore joining the USGS in 2009, McNutt served as president and chief executive officer of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), in Moss Landing, California. During her time at MBARI, the institution became a leader in developing biological and chemical sensors for remote ocean deployment, installed the first deep-sea cabled observatory in U.S. waters, and advanced the integration of artificial intelligence into autonomous underwater vehicles for complex undersea missions.\n\nHer previous honors include membership in the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She holds honorary doctoral degrees from the Colorado College, the University of Minnesota, Monmouth University, and the Colorado School of Mines. In 1988, she was awarded the American Geophysical Union’s Macelwane Medal for research accomplishments by a young scientist, and she received the Maurice Ewing Medal in 2007 for her contributions to deep-sea exploration.\n\n“Dr. McNutt is a true inspiration,” said DRI Acting President, Dr. Robert Gagosian. “She represents the extraordinary achievements that can be accomplished and the significant impact one can have on science and the public’s perception of how to solve our most difficult problems and the greatest challenges facing our planet and all of humankind. She is an exceptional mentor and has shaped the careers of so many people with her desire to instill in people her love for science.”\n\nThe 30th annual DRI Nevada Medal events are scheduled for Monday, September 25th, 2017 at the Peppermill Resort Spa Casino in Reno; and Wednesday, September 27th, 2017 at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.\n\nOver the last 29 years, the DRI Foundation has honored individuals in science and engineering whose prominent research contributions have ranged from mapping the human genome and explaining protein folding to discovering hydrothermal vents from the ocean floor off the Galapagos and advancing our knowledge of archaeological discoveries across the globe.\n\nRecent recipients of the DRI Nevada Medal include Duke University professor and unmanned systems expert Dr. Missy Cummings; NASA astrobiologist and Mars Science Laboratory mission member Dr. Chris McKay; and National Geographic Explorer and the University of California, San Diego research scientist Dr. Albert Yu-Min Lin. A full list of all 29 award recipients is available online at www.dri.edu/nvmedal.\n\nThe DRI Nevada Medal award includes an eight-ounce minted medallion of .999 pure Nevada silver and $20,000 lecture honorarium.\n\nView the Nevada Medal Event recording: https://youtu.be/-Bc85FOGnb4\n\nAs the director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab at Duke University, Dr. Mary “Missy” Cummings, Ph.D., leads a pioneering team of researchers and engineers focused on the complex interactions of human interaction with unmanned aerial systems (UAS), commonly known as drones; and the social and ethical implications of such new technologies that have the potential to dramatically impact both industry and humanity.\n\n“I am deeply honored to receive this award which is a reflection not just on my efforts but on all my students and fellow researchers who struggled in the trenches for years to move unmanned aerial vehicles, aka UAVs or drones into the mainstream,” said Dr. Cummings. “It was exactly 10 years ago that an editor of a prestigious journal told me that UAV research was of little utility since they would never gain widespread acceptance. So this award represents an important milestone for both me and the larger UAV community.”\n\nDr. Cummings spent eleven years (1988–1999) as a naval officer and military pilot, earning the rank of lieutenant, and was one of the Navy's first female fighter pilots, flying an F/A-18 Hornet. Following a successful career in the military, she directed her passion for technology to academia and became a strong public advocate for the promotion of the responsible use of drone technology and related policies for both the military and the growing commercial and civilian industries.\n\nShe is currently an associate professor in the Duke University Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, the Duke Institute of Brain Sciences, and the Duke Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. She is also an affiliate professor with the University of Washington’s Aeronautics and Astronautics Department. She received her B.S. in Mathematics from the US Naval Academy in 1988, her M.S. in Space Systems Engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School in 1994, and her Ph.D. in Systems Engineering from the University of Virginia in 2004.\n\n“Innovation demands increased responsibility and public understanding,” said Dr. Stephen Wells, DRI President, “This is especially true in the case of autonomous systems and unmanned aerial systems. We are excited to honor Dr. Missy Cummings for her exceptional role as a champion of women in science and the military; and her work in advancing these new technologies and advocating for cutting-edge scientific research and responsible policy that will impact humanity for years to come.”\n\nDr. Cummings is the second engineer and fourth female research scientist and to receive the DRI Nevada Medal.\n\nView the Nevada Medal Event recording: https://youtu.be/h-s1QCIvli8\n\nDr. Christopher McKay, an astrobiologist and planetary scientist with the Space Science Division of NASA Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley, has spent more than 30 years advancing human understanding of the evolution of the solar system and the origin of life on Earth.\n\nAstrobiology includes studying life in extreme environments to better understand how to search for life on other planets, like Mars. McKay’s scientific contributions in planning for future Mars missions includes research in Mars-like environments on Earth, traveling to the Antarctic dry valleys, the Canadian Arctic, Siberia, and the Atacama Desert in Chile. He was a co-investigator on the Huygens probe to Saturn’s moon Titan in 2005, the Mars Phoenix lander mission in 2008, and the current Mars Science Laboratory mission.\n\n“We are very excited to have Dr. McKay continue this wonderful tradition of bringing dynamic scientists to Nevada who have made a profound impact on our planet,” said Dr. Stephen Wells, DRI President. “Dr. McKay is one of NASA’s foremost experts on the search for life in Earth’s most extreme environments, and beyond.”\n\n“DRI is also very honored by the continued generous support for this important event by Switch SUPERNAP,” said Dr. Stephen Wells, DRI President.\n\nMcKay, an astrobiologist and planetary scientist with the Space Science Division of NASA Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley, has spent more than 30 years advancing human understanding of the evolution of the solar system and the origin of life on Earth.\n\nAstrobiology includes studying life in extreme environments to better understand how to search for life on other planets, like Mars. McKay’s scientific contributions in planning for future Mars missions includes research in Mars-like environments on Earth, traveling to the Antarctic dry valleys, the Canadian Arctic, Siberia, and the Atacama Desert in Chile. He was a co-investigator on the Huygens probe to Saturn’s moon Titan in 2005, the Mars Phoenix lander mission in 2008, and the current Mars Science Laboratory mission.\n\n“It is my privilege and honor to be named as the 28th DRI Nevada Medalist”, McKay said. “The search for life continues to lead us in directions no one thought possible. Collaboration with scientists around the globe and here in Nevada are bringing us closer to the fundamental question we face as a society: Is there life beyond Earth?”\n\nMcKay has collaborated on several DRI projects in the extreme environments of desert and polar regions, including DRI’s notable mission to Lake Vida, in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of East Antarctica in 2010. Led by DRI’s Dr. Alison Murray and Dr. Christian Fritsen, the Lake Vida team discovered a viable community of bacteria surviving beneath nearly 20 meters of ice in a dark, salty, subfreezing environment. McKay’s research with DRI’s Dr. Henry Sun on cyanobacteria that eke out a living under the surface of granite and sandstone rocks in the Mojave Desert and Antarctica highlight the unique conditions under which life occurs for some of the Earth’s oldest microorganisms.\n\nView the Nevada Medal Event: https://youtu.be/HWNx9V2L2uA\n\nDr. McKay speaks with Sandy Miller Elementary School: https://youtu.be/Dwy0V6IIJYo\n\nDr. Lin, whose Chinese name (Yu-Min) roughly translates to “Citizen of the Universe”, is a research scientist at the UC San Diego division of the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2) and an Emerging Explorer of the National Geographic Society in the field of technology-enabled exploration.\n\nAs the creator and Principal Investigator of the Valley of the Khans Project, an international multidisciplinary effort to locate the tomb of Genghis Kahn, Dr. Lin has lead multiple technology driven expeditions deep into the most remote parts of the world and developed innovative platforms for satellite, aerial and subsurface remote sensing in exploration.\n\nHis team’s pioneering work to create new methods for massive data analysis through innovative crowdsourcing techniques earned him the 2011 USGIS Academic Achievement award and was featured in a one-hour National Geographic Documentary film, “the Forbidden Tomb of Genghis Khan”, also in 2011.\n\n“To me, the Nevada Medal comes with the heavy responsibility of honoring the spirit of human curiosity… the desire to seek the unknown, stand at its bank, and venture in,” said Lin, who holds a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering.\n\n“Today the frontiers of exploration exist in science, driven by a need to expand our knowledge of the world around us, and defined by how we utilize that knowledge. I am humbled and incredibly honored to be a small part of that.”\n\n“Albert is a pioneer in a new era of digital exploration and science education through public engagement,” said DRI President, Dr. Stephen Wells. “His work has motivated participation from thousands of people in real-time, on-the-ground scientific discovery in ways we never imagined. I’m also very excited that we are honoring a material scientist and engineer this year.”\n\nDr. Lin is the youngest research scientist and the first materials scientist and engineer to receive the DRI Nevada Medal.\n\nVideo Presentation from the Nevada Medal Event\n\nMedia Coverage:\n\nVideo Coverage\n\nPhoto Gallery --Las Vegas Dinner |Reno Dinner |Visit with Sandy Miller Elementary School\n\nVideo chats with Dr. Lin and Nevada students\n\nMeet Dr. Lin and see how he interacts with Nevada students via video chat.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMovA_ekUDM&feature=share&list=UUGLCwZnQiiCXR0NkjeeqmFw\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgfWTQ2bSpU&list=UUGLCwZnQiiCXR0NkjeeqmFw&feature=share&index=1\n\nThe 2013 DRI Nevada Medal proudly honors Dr. Nina V. Fedoroff for her outstanding achievements in the field of life sciences and biotechnology. Her research on the molecular biology of plants has helped develop modern techniques used to study and modify plants, and she has now undertaken to pioneer solutions to some of the world’s most difficult agricultural challenges.\n\nIn the late 1970s when DNA sequencing technology was first developed, Dr. Fedoroff sequenced one of the first large complex organism genes ever to be sequenced. Her early involvement in the field of plant molecular biology and plant genetic modification led her to become one of the leading spokespersons for the use of modern molecular techniques in crop plant improvement. From 2007 to 2010, Fedoroff served as the Science and Technology Adviser to the Secretary of State, first under Secretary Rice and more recently under Secretary Clinton.\n\nFedoroff is a Distinguished Professor of Biosciences and Director of the Center for Desert Agriculture at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia, where she is establishing an experimental program in crop and aquaculture biology and technology for arid climates. She is also an Evan Pugh Professor at Penn State University and a member of the External Faculty and Science Advisory Board of the Santa Fe Institute, Santa Fe, NM. She has served on the National Science Foundation’s National Science Board, as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and is currently serving as the Chair of the AAAS Board of Directors.\n\nMedia Coverage\n\nVideo Presentation from the Nevada Medal Event\n\nSteven Squyres, Ph. D. has shown the world what discoveries are possible in outer space with his passionate interest in and exploration of Mars and space. Best known for his research on the history and distribution of water on Mars, Squyres acted as the scientific Principal Investigator for the Mars Exploration Rover Project (MERS). He has also extensively studied the possible existence and habitability of a liquid water ocean on Europa. His research and discoveries encourage us to explore outside of what is already known, and to look to space for the future of science and technology.\n\nSquyres has been enthusiastic about the exploration of Mars since he was an undergraduate student at Cornell University. “What I really wanted, when you got right down to it, was martian dirt on my own boots. And if I couldn’t have that, I wanted the next best thing,” Squyres said in the prologue of his book, Roving Mars: Spirit, Opportunity, and the Exploration of the Red Planet, which has also been adapted to film by Disney.\n\nIn addition to his studies of Mars, Squyres has also been involved in several planetary spaceflight missions with NASA, including the Voyager Mission to Jupiter and Saturn, the Magellan Mission to Venus, the Cassini Mission to Saturn and the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous Mission. He is the Goldwin Smith Professor of Astronomy at Cornell University, where he received his Ph.D. in planetary science. He has won various respected awards including the 2004 Carl Sagan Memorial Award and the 2009 Carl Sagan Medal for Excellence in Communication in Planetary Science. He has also been recognized by “ABC News,” “The Colbert Report” and Wired magazine, in addition to publishing work in various esteemed scientific publications such as “Science” and “Journal of Geophysical Research.”\n\n“I grew up wanting to be Captain Nemo from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.”\n\nBest known for his 1985 discovery of the TITANIC, Dr. Robert Ballard has succeeded in tracking down numerous other significant shipwrecks, including the German battleship BISMARCK, the lost fleet of Guadalcanal, the U.S. aircraft carrier YORKTOWN (sunk in the World War II Battle of Midway), and John F. Kennedy’s boat, PT-109.\n\nWhile those discoveries have captured the imagination of the public, Dr. Ballard believes his most important discoveries were of hydrothermal vents and “black smokers” in the Galapagos Rift and East Pacific Rise in 1977 and 1979 along with their exotic life forms living off the energy of the Earth through a process now called chemosynthesis.\n\nIn addition to being a National Geographic Society Explorer-In-Residence and a commissioner on the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, Dr. Ballard is the founder and president of the Institute for Exploration (IFE) in Mystic, CT.\n\nBallard was born June 30, 1942, in Wichita, KS but moved to California at a very young age and grew up exploring the shore in San Diego. Dr. Ballard has a Ph.D. in marine geology and geophysics from the University of Rhode Island. He spent 30 years at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, where he helped develop telecommunications technology to create “tele-presence” for his JASON Project and Immersion Learning, which allows hundreds of thousands of schoolchildren to accompany him from afar on undersea explorations around the globe each year. In 2001, he returned to the Graduate School of Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island where he is presently a tenured Professor of Oceanography and Director of the Center for Ocean Exploration and Archaeological Oceanography.\n\nDr. Ballard has 21 honorary degrees and six military awards. He was also a Commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve, serving in the Navy from 1967 to 1997. He received the National Geographic Society’s prestigious Hubbard Medal in 1996 for “extraordinary accomplishments in coaxing secrets from the world’s oceans and engaging students in the wonder of science.” Dr. Ballard has published numerous books, scientific papers, and a dozen articles in National Geographic magazine. Dr. Ballard also has been featured in several National Geographic television programs, including the record-breaking “Secrets of the TITANIC.”\n\nHis discoveries also include sunken remains of ships along ancient trade routes in the Mediterranean Sea; two ancient Phoenician ships off Israel, the oldest shipwrecks ever found in deep water; and four 1,500-year-old wooden ships, one almost perfectly preserved in the Black Sea. Dr. Ballard’s Black Sea project seeks evidence of a great flood that may have struck the region thousands of years ago.\n\nHis 1997 best-selling book, Lost Liners, tells the story of the great transatlantic liners through memorable wrecks he has visited. Dr. Ballard was also a special advisor on Steven Spielberg’s futuristic Sea Quest, DSV television show.\n\nAn explorer, discoverer and historian, Dr. Ballard’s fascinating journeys can teach us a great deal about our past, and they have encouraged others to take tremendous strides in the survey of the undiscovered mysteries of the deep sea.\n\n(2010 Recipient)\n\nAudio Interview with Dr. Robert Ballard: Deep Sea Explorer\n\nSource: 04/22/10 KNPR's State of Nevada\n\nRobert Ballard's life so far reads like a movie script: Navy commander starts exploring the ocean, discovers the Titanic, finds a nuclear sub on a top secret mission for the Navy, is one of the first humans to see deep-sea vents. Oh, and he loves to teach kids about the ocean, too. Oceanographer Robert Ballard joins us to talk about a life of submarines, underwater robots, and where his next big adventure lies.\n\nProfessor of the Earth and Planetary Sciences department of the University of California, Berkeley\n\nAlvarez is a geologist who considers himself an Earth historian, and is fascinated by the challenge of reading the history of our planet recorded in rocks.\n\nIn 1980, he was working with colleagues, including his father, physicist Luis Alvarez, on an expedition in Italy. There, he accidentally discovered a band of sedimentary rock that contained unusually high levels of a rare element, iridium. Chemical dating techniques put the rock at around 65 million years old. Coincidentally -- or not, that is around the time the dinosaurs died out. Alvarez hypothesized that the iridium, which was in a very even, widespread distribution (not just in Italy), was the result of a giant asteroid that hit Earth, sending smoke, dust, and iridium into the atmosphere. That smokescreen blocked the sun, lowering the earth's temperature, killing plants (but not seeds or roots), and eventually many species of animals, including dinosaurs. The plant-eaters died out first, followed by the meat-eaters who would have eaten them. Smaller mammals and birds could survive the cold, desolate period because of their fur, feathers, and ability to eat seeds, roots, and decaying vegetation. The pollution eventually settled to the ground, forming a thin layer of iridium.\n\nIn addition to his interest in extinction events and impacts, Alvarez has contributed to the understanding of Mediterranean tectonics, Roman geology and archeology, and the establishment of magnetostratigraphic correlations.\n\n(2006 Recipient)"
