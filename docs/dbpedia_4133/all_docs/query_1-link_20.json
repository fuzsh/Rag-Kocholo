        "text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Jan. 27, 2005) — The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has recognized the work of Whitehead Member and MIT Professor of Biology David Bartel by presenting him the NAS Award in Molecular Biology. Each year a medal and a prize of $25,000 goes to a young scientist for a recent notable discovery in molecular biology. Bartel was chosen “for his discoveries on the repertoire of catalytic RNA and the analysis of micro RNA genes and their targets.” The award is supported by Pfizer Inc. and has been presented since 1962.\n\nBartel joins the ranks of other past and present Members of Whitehead Institute who have received this honor. They include founding Director David Baltimore (1974), Gerald Fink (1981), Robert Weinberg (1984), and former Member Peter Kim (1993).\n\nThis year’s awards will be presented on May 2 at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., during the Academy's 142nd annual meeting."
