        "text": "TAMEST Edith and Peter O’Donnell Awards\n\nThe Edith and Peter O’Donnell Awards were established in 2006. They are named in honor of Edith and Peter O’Donnell, who were among Texas’ most devoted advocates for excellence in scientific advancement and STEM education. The awards recognize rising star Texas researchers who are addressing the essential role that science and technology play in society and whose work meets the highest standards of exemplary professional performance, creativity and resourcefulness.\n\nThe O’Donnell Awards acknowledge outstanding achievements by Texas-based researchers in five categories: medicine, engineering, biological sciences, physical sciences and technology innovation.\n\nEach award includes a $25,000 honorarium and an invitation to present at TAMEST’s Annual Conference each year. Since 2006, 16 O’Donnell Awards recipients have been elected to one of the National Academies and four have been elected to multiple academies.\n\nThanks to a $1.15 million gift from the O’Donnell Foundation in 2022, the O’Donnell Awards have expanded to include an additional science award. The awards now recognize recipients in the categories of Medicine, Engineering, Biological Sciences, Physical Sciences and Technology Innovation.\n\nNominations for the 2025 O’Donnell Awards closed on April 30, 2024. If you have any questions, please contact Stephanie Shaw at stephanie.shaw@austin.utexas.edu or (512) 232-8495.\n\n2024 O’Donnell Awards Recipients\n\nOpening a new field of study to understand the way brain cells communicate. Discovering the magic of taking a pristine picture through fog, smoke and driving rain. Bringing to light how we deal with the molecules that we put into the environment. Understanding a whole new approach to treating COVID-19. Developing new methods for making robots more usable by humans across time delays in space.\n\nThese are the breakthroughs by Texas’ rising stars in research being honored with the 2024 Edith and Peter O’Donnell Awards by TAMEST.
