Blackburn, Biochemistry, Nobel Prize, ageing process, animation, Telomerase, Australia, women in science\n\nSHE THOUGHT IT\n\nA specialist in telomeres (structures found at the end of chromosomes), working together with Carol W. Greider, Elizabeth Blackburn discovered the enzyme telomerase, which produces telomere DNA, which is crucial to the successful replication of chromosomes in cell division. This introduced a new field in the research of cancer and aging1.\n\nSHORT BIOGRAPHY\n\nThe second of seven children, Elizabeth Blackburn was born in Hobart, Australia in 1948. She obtained her BSc (1970) and her MSc (1972) degrees in Biochemistry from the University of Melbourne and moved to England, where she earned her PhD from the University of Cambridge in 1975, analysing DNA sequences at two-time Nobel laureate, Fred Sanger’s laboratory. She started postdoctoral work on cellular biology at Joe Gall’s laboratory at Yale in 1975 on an Anna Fuller Fellowship2. The same year, Blackburn married professor of biochemistry and biophysics, John W. Sedat. The couple moved to San Francisco, California in 1977. Blackburn became associate professor at the Department of Molecular Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. Among her doctoral students was Carol W. Greider, with whom Blackburn co-discovered telomerase2. In December 1986, her son Benjamin David was born. In 1990, she transferred her laboratory to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at UCSF. In 1993, Blackburn became the first woman to hold the position of Department Chair until 19992. She remained a professor at the Departments of Biochemistry and Biophysics and Microbiology and Immunology at UCSF.\n\nBlackburn has been a member of numerous editorial boards of eminent scientific journals, such as Cell and Science, as well as president or member of more than ten scientific societies3. She is a founding member of the Rosalind Franklin Society, which promotes women’s contributions to science. A non-resident fellow of the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences since 2001, she was named its President in November 2015 and took on the position in January 2016.3\n\nBlackburn said biology, mathematics and chemistry teachers Nan Hughes, Len Stuttard, and Jenny Phipps particularly encouraged her2. During her university research, her principal mentors in directing a lab team and exemplary scientists were Frank Hird (Melbourne, Australia), Fred Sanger (Cambridge, England) and Joseph Gall (Yale, USA)2.\n\nHer female role model in science is Barbara McClintock, who also reminded Blackburn that she should listen to her intuition when doing research2.\n\nIn 2001, under President George W. Bush, Blackburn joined the new U.S. Federal Commission, the President’s Council on Bioethics. Having publicly opposed some of the council’s recommendations on stem cell research and on therapeutic cloning, the Bush administration decided to dismiss her from the Council after two years. This decision got a considerable amount of attention from the press and Blackburn has also received many letters of support4.\n\nSCIENTIFIC COLLABORATION AND RECOGNITION\n\nBlackburn identified telomerase with her graduate student at the time, Carol W. Greider. Telomerase adds DNA to the ends of chromosomes, thus protecting them and dictating how often the cell will divide. A decrease in telomerase results in aging, cancer, diabetes and other diseases1. Blackburn continues to research telomerase in order to better understand the processes of aging and cancer5.\n\nSHE SAID IT\n\nIt never occurred to me that as a woman I wouldn’t have gone into science. I’m sure that’s just the example of having a mother who was doing some kind of career.\n\n“Scientist of the year notable: Elizabeth Blackburn”, (2007) interviewed by Linda Marsa , Discovery Magazine, <http://discovermagazine.com/2007/dec/blackburn> (last accessed 13 Jun. 2016).\n\nI understand family and career balance…and I think it can be over the years that the balance can be achieved, but not every single day necessarily. It is essential to prioritize things…\n\n“Blackburn gets personal, reflects on the path leading up to Nobel Prize” (2009), UCSF, <https://www.ucsf.edu/about/2009-nobel-prize-medicine/blackburn-gets-personal-reflects-path-leading-nobel-prize> (last accessed 7 Jun. 2016).\n\nPRIZES, ACHIEVEMENTS, HONOURS\n\n1988: Eli Lilly Research Award for Microbiology and Immunology\n\n1990: National Academy of Science Award in Molecular Biology “for her discovery of the nature of DNA at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and the enzyme that is necessary to complete chromosomal replication”6\n\n1991: Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\n\n1991: Honorary Doctorate of Science from Yale University\n\n1992: Elected Fellow of the Royal Society\n\n1993: Member of the National Academy of Sciences\n\n1997: Member of the American Society for Cell Biology (ASCB)\n\n1998: Canada Gairdner Foundation International Award, with Carol W.
