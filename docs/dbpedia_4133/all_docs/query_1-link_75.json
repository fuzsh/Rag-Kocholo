        "text": "Congratulations to the following Annual Reviews contributing authors for receiving these National Academy of Sciences awards:\n\nBarbara Dosher, of the University of California, Irvine, won the Atkinson Prize in Psychological and Cognitive Sciences “for her groundbreaking work on human memory, attention, and learning.” She wrote for the 2017 Annual Review of Vision Science.\n\nShe shared the prize with Richard Shiffrin, of Indiana University, who was recognized “for pioneering contributions to the investigation of memory and attention.” He wrote for the 1992 Annual Review of Psychology.\n\nGünter Wagner, of Yale University, won the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal “for his book Homology, Genes, and Evolutionary Innovation, which makes fundamental contributions to our understanding of the evolution of complex organisms.” He wrote for the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics in 1989 and 1991.\n\nMark E. Hay, of the Georgia Institute of Technology, won the Gilbert Morgan Smith Medal “for his research into algal science, with implications for the world’s imperiled coral reefs.” He wrote for the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics in 1988 and 2004, and the Annual Review of Marine Science in 2009.\n\nJames P. Allison, of the University of Texas MD Anderson Center, won the Jessie Stevenson Kovalenko Medal “for important discoveries related to the body’s immune response to tumors.” He wrote for the Annual Review of Immunology in 1987, 1991, and 2001, and the Annual Review of Medicine in 2014.\n\nHoward Y. Chang, of Stanford University, won the NAS Award in Molecular Biology “for the discovery of long noncoding RNAs and the invention of genomic technologies.” He wrote for the Annual Review of Biochemistry in 2009 and 2012.\n\nRodolphe Barrangou, of North Carolina State University, won the NAS Prize in Food and Agriculture Sciences “for the discovery of the genetic mechanisms and proteins driving CRISPR-Cas systems.” He wrote for the Annual Review of Food Science in 2012, 2016, and 2017, and the Annual Review of Genetics in 2017.\n\nMarlene R. Cohen, of the University of Pittsburgh, won the Troland Research Award “for her pioneering studies of how neurons in the brain process visual information.” She wrote for the Annual Review of Neuroscience in 2012 and 2018.\n\nEtel Solingen, of the University of California, Irvine, won the William and Katherine Estes Award “for pathbreaking work on nuclear proliferation and reducing the risks of nuclear war.” She wrote for the Annual Review of Political Science in 2010.\n\nThe 2016 Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics was awarded to Kip S. Thorne, of the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), and Rainer Weiss, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They lead the LIGO Project with CalTech’s Ronald W.P. Drever, also a recipient of the prize, and they share this honor with the other 1012 who were part of this research. Together they were the first to detect the gravitational waves predicted by Albert Einstein.\n\nFind Dr. Thorne’s article in the 1972 Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics:\n\nGravitational Wave Astronomy\n\nFind Dr. Weiss’ article in the 1980 Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics:\n\nMeasurements of the Cosmic Background Radiation\n\nFive Breakthrough Prizes in Life Sciences were awarded in 2017, to the following laureates:\n\n• Stephen Elledge, of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, “for elucidating how eukaryotic cells sense and respond to damage in their DNA and providing insights into the development and treatment of cancer.”\n\nDr. Elledge is scheduled to write an article for the 2017 Annual Review of Cancer Biology.\n\n• Harry F. Noller, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, “for discovering the centrality of RNA in forming the active centers of the ribosome, the fundamental machinery of protein synthesis in all cells, thereby connecting modern biology to the origin of life and also explaining how many natural antibiotics disrupt protein synthesis.”\n\nFind Dr. Noller’s articles in the Annual Review of Biochemistry:\n\nStructure of Ribosomal RNA (1984)\n\nRibosomal RNA and Translation (1991)\n\nRibosomes and Translation (1997)\n\n• Roeland Nusse, of Stanford University and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, “for pioneering research on the Wnt pathway, one of the crucial intercellular signaling systems in development, cancer and stem cell biology.”\n\nFind Dr. Nusse’s articles in the Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology:\n\nMechanisms of Wnt Signaling in Development (1998)\n\nThe Wnt Signaling Pathway in Development and Disease (2004)\n\n• Yoshinori Ohsumi, of the Tokyo Institute of Technology, “for elucidating autophagy, the recycling system that cells use to generate nutrients from their own inessential or damaged components.” This comes two months after Dr. Ohsumi won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\n\nFind Dr. Ohsumi’s articles in the Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology:\n\nVacuolar Import of Proteins and Organelles from the Cytoplasm (1999)\n\nThe Role of Atg Proteins in Autophagosome Formation (2011)\n\n• Huda Y. Zoghbi, of the Baylor College of Medicine, Texas Children’s Hospital, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, “for discoveries of the genetic causes and biochemical mechanisms of spinocerebellar ataxia and Rett syndrome, findings that have provided insight into the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and neurological diseases.”\n\nFind Dr. Zoghby’s articles in the Annual Review of Neuroscience, the Annual Review of Physiology, and the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics:\n\nGlutamine Repeats and Neurodegeneration (2000)\n\nInsights from Mouse Models in the Molecular Basis of Neurodegeneration (2000)\n\nTrinucleotide Repeats: Mechanisms and Pathophysiology (2000)\n\nTrinucleotide Repeat Disorders (2007)"
