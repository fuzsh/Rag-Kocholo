The award is presented with a medal and a $25,000 prize.\n\nMost Recent Recipient\n\nShu-ou Shan, California Institute of Technology, received the 2024 NAS Award in Molecular Biology.\n\nShan’s pioneering research has elucidated how newly synthesized proteins are transported to cell membranes, advancing our understanding of molecular mechanisms in complex biological pathways.\n\nRead more about Shan's work»\n\nAward History\n\nThe NAS Award in Molecular Biology was first awarded in 1962 to Marshall Nirenberg for his studies of the molecular mechanisms for the biosynthesis of protein. In 1959 Nirenberg began to study the steps that relate DNA, RNA and protein. These investigations led to the demonstration with H. Matthaei that messenger RNA is required for protein synthesis and that synthetic messenger RNA preparations can be used to decipher various aspects of the genetic code (from Nirenberg’s Nobel biography). Nirenberg went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Robert W. Holley and H. Gobind Khorana in 1968 for \"for their interpretation of the genetic code and its function in protein synthesis.\" Previous recipients of the NAS Award in Molecular Biology continue to achieve outstanding advancements in their fields. 10 recipients have been honored with a National Medal of Science, 19 recipients have received a Lasker Award, and 15 recipients have received a Nobel Prize in Medicine (Nirenberg 1968; Holley 1968; Temin 1975; Baltimore 1975; Nathans 1978; Blobel 1999; Sharp 1993; Horvitz 2002; Blackburn 2009; Szostak 2009; Südhof 2013; Fire 2006; Mello 2006), and in Chemistry (Gilbert 1980; Cech 1989).\n\nRecipients:\n\nShu-ou Shan (2024)\n\nFor creatively combining biochemical, biophysical and structural studies to make pioneering discoveries that reveal how protein targeting and disaggregation machineries achieve fidelity by coupling multiple discrete conformational changes.\n\nRead more about Shan's work»\n\nJason S.
