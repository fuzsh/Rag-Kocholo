        "text": "Dr. Rodolphe Barrangou, the Todd R . Klaenhammer Distinguished Scholar in Probiotics Research and associate professor in the NC State Department of Food, Bioprocessing and Nutrition Sciences, will receive the 2017 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Award in Molecular Biology.\n\nBeginning with their landmark paper in 2007, Barrangou and his collaborators’ discovery that bacteria have adaptive immune systems has catalyzed the manipulation of the CRISPR-Cas9 pathway for genome engineering."
