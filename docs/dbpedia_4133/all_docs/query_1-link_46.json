Eligible applicants are exceptional mid-career professionals who have also earned an advanced degree - either a masters or doctoral degree. Successful applicants will bring a depth of expertise and knowledge about health, health equity, and the drivers of health to the policymaking process; and will offer an informed perspective on important and complex challenges facing policymakers. The fellowship is comprised of two unique experiences: an immersive orientation period and a hands-on placement working as a senior advisor to an elected or appointed federal government official. Please share widely with your networks; applications are open until November 5th. Learn more and apply here: https://lnkd.in/gFh_DT5Z #healthpolicy #healthpolicyfellows #healthcareleadership"
