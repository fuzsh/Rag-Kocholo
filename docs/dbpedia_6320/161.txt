The undeniable success of ‘Gen V’ has encouraged Amazon Studios to continue expanding the universe of ‘The Boys’, one of its most popular series, and thus, according to a report from Variety, a new spin-off: ‘The Boys: Mexico’. Set in the North American country, the new series will also feature some of the most popular names from the Latin American scene.

Within this report, it is mentioned that one of the producers is Diego Luna, known for movies like ‘Elysium’ or especially ‘Rogue One: A Star Wars Story’, which in turn gave birth to ‘Andor’, the series also starring Luna. Another of those involved is Gael García Bernal, who has participated in other productions such as ‘Werewolf by Night’, ‘Old’, the film by M. Night Shyamalan, or ‘Amores perros’, among many others. Although both will take on the role of producers, according to Deadline it is more than likely that they will also take on the role of two of its protagonists.

Apparently, no details are known at this time about a script that will be written by Gareth Dunneth Alcocer, who also wrote the script for ‘Blue Beetle’, which just recently arrived at HBO Max. Casting will begin soon, while those chosen to participate in the series will soon be summoned to Mexico, where the series will be filmed.
