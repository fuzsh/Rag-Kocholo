        "text": "Tim Thomerson rates highly as one of the best, most prolific, versatile and dependable character actors to ever grace both the big and small screens alike with pleasing regularity since the mid 70s. Although often cast as laconic rough 'n' tumble macho guys, Thomerson has proved on many occasions that he can essay comic roles and more substantial dramatic parts with equal skill and conviction. He was born on April 8th, 1946 in Coronado, California and was raised in Hawaii and San Diego. He did a stint in the National Guard prior to getting a job as a prop man and set builder at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego. Character actor Anthony Zerbe advised Thomerson to get lessons from legendary acting teacher Stella Adler in New York; and he duly studied with Adler for four years.\n\nHe began his show business career as a stand-up comedian; he performed at the clubs The Bitter End, Bud Friedman's Improvisation and Catch A Rising Star in New York and at the Comedy Store and the Improv in Los Angeles. He eventually even had a guest spot on \"The Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson. His film debut was with a funny small role in the hilarious \"Car Wash.\" He achieved his greatest enduring cult popularity with his delightfully deadpan portrayal of rugged police detective Jack Deth in the terrific \"Trancers\" and its strictly so-so sequels. Other memorable parts include eccentric police detective Jerry Moriarty in the fine \"Fade to Black,\" weary factory worker Ray in \"Take This Job and Shove It,\" a highway patrolman in Clint Eastwood's poignant and underrated \"Honkytonk Man,\" burnt-out Vietnam vet helicopter pilot Charts in the exciting \"Uncommon Valor,\" grimy mercenary Rhodes in the cheesy \"Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn,\" the crazed John Reynolds in \"Volunteers,\" demented cult leader Lester in \"Cherry 2000,\" the tough-as-nails the Sarge in the enjoyably quirky \"Zone Troopers;\" lovely and touching as the gentle Loy in the outstanding \"Near Dark,\" diminutive, but fearless alien lawman Brick Bardo in the funky \"Dollman,\" and a scruffy motorcyclist in Terry Gilliam's unjustly maligned \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.\" Tim has appeared in a large number of films for low-budget independent director Albert Pyon and acted alongside real-life best buddy Brion James in numerous pictures (the two first met while both serving in the National Guard Reserves). On television Thomerson played the half-man, half-woman Gene-Jean on the uproarious, but sadly short-lived sci-fi parody program \"Quark.\" Thomerson also had recurring roles on the TV shows \"Sirens\" and \"Land's End\" and has made guest appearances on countless TV shows.\n\nA marvelous character actor with intense eyes, a sly grin and somewhat grizzled appearance, Golden Globe-winner Fred Ward had nearly 90 appearances under his belt in many tremendous films and television programs. He first became interested in acting after serving three years in the US Air Force and studied at New York's Herbert Berghof Studio. Ward then went to Europe, where he dubbed many Italian movies, and first appeared on-screen in two films by Roberto Rossellini. He then returned to the United States, and got his first decent role alongside Clint Eastwood in the nail-biting prison film Flucht von Alcatraz (1979). Ward's looks often saw him cast as law enforcement or military characters, and he put in noteworthy performances in Die letzten Amerikaner (1981), Die verwegenen Sieben (1983), as astronaut Gus Grissom in Der Stoff aus dem die Helden sind (1983) and scored the lead in the interesting spy/martial arts movie Remo - Unbewaffnet Und Gefaehrlich (1985), which unfortunately was not as successful as had been the mega-selling series of Remo Williams books.\n\nHowever, during \"Remo\", Ward demonstrated a great knack for comedic timing and satirical performance, and this ability was used to great effect in several films, including playing Kevin Bacon's fellow giant-worm-fighting handyman in the light-hearted sci-fi hit Tremors - Im Land der Raketenw√ºrmer (1990), as \"Walter Stuckel\" in Robert Altman's The Player (1992), as TV anchorman \"Chip Daley\" in Tim Robbins' razor-sharp political satire Bob Roberts (1992) and as a vicious, but incompetent, gangster menacing Leslie Nielsen in Die nackte Kanone 33 1/3 (1994).\n\nWard's abilities as both a supporting player and truly versatile character actor ensured that he would be in steady demand, and he continued to turn up in a wide variety of roles utilizing his skills. Keep an eye out for Fred Ward in the action-filled The Chaos Factor (2000), as David Spade's dad in Joe Dreck (2001), in the tongue-in-cheek Mr. Undercover (2001) and in the Reese Witherspoon romantic tale Sweet Home Alabama - Liebe auf Umwegen (2002). His last three films were more action-oriented, Armored (2009), [link=tt1622547, and 2 Guns (2013), and he subsequently mostly retired from acting until his death in 2022.\n\nIn 1979 with his Detroit friends, Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert, Bruce Campbell raised $350,000 for a low-budget film, Tanz der Teufel (1981), in which he starred and co-executive produced. Completed piecemeal over four years, the film first gained notoriety in England where it became the best-selling video of 1983, beating out Shining (1980). After its appearance at Cannes, where Stephen King dubbed it \"the most ferociously original horror film of the year\", New Line Cinema stepped forward to release \"Evil Dead\" in the U.S.\n\nAfter co-producing Die Killer-Akademie (1985), a cross-genre comedy written by Sam Raimi, Ethan and Joel Coen, Campbell moved to Los Angeles and quickly gained a foothold producing or starring in genre films such as the Maniac Cop (1988) series, Lunatics - Duell der Alptr√§ume (1991), Moontrap - Gefangen in Raum und Zeit (1988), and Brain Slasher (1991), a post-apocalyptic \"Jeremiah Johnson\", during which he met his wife-to-be, filmmaker, Ida Gearon.\n\nCampbell then rejoined his Detroit colleagues to star and co-produce the second and third films in the Evil Dead trilogy (Tanz der Teufel 2 - Jetzt wird noch mehr getanzt (1987) & Armee der Finsternis (1992)), completing 12 years of work on the cult favorite.\n\nThis rough-and-tumble background was a plus as Campbell made his foray into television, first starring in the highly touted Fox series Die Abenteuer des Brisco County jr. (1993), then as a recurring guest-star on the hit show Superman: Die Abenteuer von Lois & Clark (1993).\n\nWith these under his belt, Campbell easily made the transition to director, helming numerous episodes and recurring as the King of Thieves in the #1 syndicated Hercules: The Legendary Journeys (1995), and its follow-up phenomenon, Xena: Die Kriegerprinzessin (1995).\n\nBruce has since expanded his range on television, appearing in anything from Disney's update of Ein toller K√§fer kehrt zur√ºck (1997), to decidedly dramatic turns on the acclaimed series Homicide (1993) and Akte X: Die unheimlichen F√§lle des FBI (1993). At the invitation of ABC, Campbell ventured into the world of sitcoms with a recurring role on ABC's Emmy-nominated Ellen (1994), participating in one of the three touted \"out\" episodes.\n\nBut Campbell didn't abandon his film roots. During that time, he had featured roles in the blockbuster Congo - Wo der Mensch zur bedrohten Art wird (1995), John Carpenter's Flucht aus L.A. (1996), and the award-winning independent crime drama, Running Time (1997). He followed these up with roles in Paramount's romantic comedy, Scheiden ist s√º√ü - Serving Sara (2002), Jim Carrey's The Majestic (2001), and all three of Sam Raimi's blockbuster Spider-Man movies.\n\nAfter a return to episodic television in the swashbuckling series, Jack of All Trades (2000), Campbell took the title role in MGM's cult sleeper Bubba Ho-Tep (2002). His directorial debut, Man with the Screaming Brain (2005) premiered on the Sci Fi Channel, and Dark Horse Comics published the comic adaptation.\n\nCampbell then directed and starred as himself in My Name Is Bruce (2007), a spoof of his B-movie career, then re-teamed with Disney for their fun-filled hit, Sky High - Diese Highschool hebt ab! (2005).\n\nCampbell has since made the leap into other forms of entertainment, and is enjoying his role as an author with back-to-back New York Times bestsellers: a memoir entitled \"If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor\", and his first novel, \"Make Love the Bruce Campbell Way\".\n\nIn the multi-media industry, Bruce has enjoyed voicing characters for Disney's animated TV series Tarzan (2001) and the Warner Brothers feature Lucas, der Ameisenschreck (2006). He also portrayed the character of \"Mayor Shelbourne\" in the animated hit film, Wolkig mit Aussicht auf Fleischb√§llchen (2009). Recently, Campbell voiced the role of \"Rod Torque Redline\" in Cars 2 (2011), the sequel to the smash Disney animated feature and for the immensely popular game, \"Call of Duty\".\n\nIn 2013, Bruce co-produced the hit remake of Evil Dead (2013), joined his filmmaking pal Sam Raimi on Die fantastische Welt von Oz (2013), and completed an impressive seven-year run on the spy show, Burn Notice (2007) (2007-2013), USA's #1 show on cable.\n\nMore than two decades after the release of Armee der Finsternis (1992), Bruce returned to his most iconic role for Ash vs Evil Dead (2015), a highly-anticipated series premiering on the Starz network on Halloween 2015.\n\nAn intense, versatile actor as adept at playing clean-cut FBI agents as he is psychotic motorcycle-gang leaders, who can go from portraying soulless, murderous vampires to burned-out, world-weary homicide detectives, Lance Henriksen has starred in a variety of films that have allowed him to stretch his talents just about as far as an actor could possibly hope. He played \"Awful Knoffel\" in the TNT original movie Evel Knievel (2004), directed by John Badham and executive produced by Mel Gibson. Henriksen portrayed \"Awful Knoffel\" in this project based on the life of the famed daredevil, played by George Eads. Henriksen starred for three seasons (1996-1999) on Millennium: F√ºrchte deinen N√§chsten wie dich selbst (1996), Fox-TV's critically acclaimed series created by Chris Carter (Akte X: Die unheimlichen F√§lle des FBI (1993)). His performance as Frank Black, a retired FBI agent who has the ability to get inside the minds of killers, landed him three consecutive Golden Globe nominations for \"Best Performance by a Lead Actor in a Drama Series\" and a People's Choice Award nomination for \"Favorite New TV Male Star\".\n\nHenriksen was born in New York City. His mother, Margueritte, was a waitress, dance instructor, and model. His father, James Marin Henriksen, who was from T√∏nsberg, Norway, was a boxer and merchant sailor. Henriksen studied at the Actors Studio and began his career off-Broadway in Eugene O'Neill's \"Three Plays of the Sea.\" One of his first film appearances was as an FBI agent in Sidney Lumet's Hundstage (1975), followed by parts in Lumet's Network (1976) and Prince of the City - Die Herren der Stadt (1981). He then appeared in Steven Spielberg's Die unheimliche Begegnung der 3. Art (1977) with Richard Dreyfuss and Fran√ßois Truffaut, Damien - Omen II (1978) and in Philip Kaufman's Der Stoff aus dem die Helden sind (1983), in which he played Mercury astronaut Capt. Wally Schirra.\n\nJames Cameron cast Henriksen in his first directorial effort, Fliegende Killer - Piranha II (1982), then used him again in Terminator (1984) and as the android Bishop in the sci-fi classic Aliens: Die R√ºckkehr (1986). Sam Raimi cast Henriksen as an outrageously garbed gunfighter in his quirky western Schneller als der Tod (1995). Henriksen has also appeared in what has developed into a cult classic: Kathryn Bigelow's Near Dark - Die Nacht hat ihren Preis (1987), in which he plays the head of a clan of murderous redneck vampires. He was nominated for a Golden Satellite Award for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln in the TNT original film The Day Lincoln Was Shot (1998).\n\nIn addition to his abilities as an actor, Henriksen is an accomplished painter and potter. His talent as a ceramist has enabled him to create some of the most unusual ceramic artworks available on the art market today. He resides in Southern California with his wife Jane and their five-year-old daughter Sage.\n\nMusician, Actor, Producer, Screenwriter, Activist - Referred to as \"The Hardest Working Man in Horror,\" Reggie Bannister is known world wide for his starring role as the intrepid ice cream vendor-turned hero in the action-horror series, Phantasm I-IV.

He has also appeared in many films for director John Carpenter: he's very engaging as the jolly Dr. Paul Leahy in John Carpenter's Die F√ºrsten der Dunkelheit (1987) and was terrific as underground guerrilla army leader Gilbert in John Carpenter's Sie leben (1988).\n\nOther notable roles include a sinister government agent in Dreamscape: H√∂llische Tr√§ume (1984), rugged Maj.

Atkins initially became an avid horror film fan in his childhood days; Howard Hawks' immortal classic Das Ding aus einer anderen Welt (1951) made an especially strong impression on him as a kid. Tom attended Duquesne University in Pittsburgh and was a member of the Gamma Phi Fraternity. Atkins made his film debut as a rookie police officer in the Frank Sinatra private eye-outing Der Detektiv (1968); it was the first of many police officer roles he has played throughout the years. Tom appeared in two films for director John Carpenter: he is very likable as Nick Castle in the spooky ghost film The Fog: Nebel des Grauens (1980) and solid as Rehme in the fantastic futuristic sci-fi/action cult film Die Klapperschlange (1981). Atkins had a nice small role as a disapproving and overbearing father in the wrap-around segments of the immensely enjoyable fright feature anthology Die unheimlich verr√ºckte Geisterstunde (1982). He made for a touchingly flawed hero as Dr. Daniel Challis in the unjustly maligned Halloween 3 - Die Nacht der Entscheidung (1982).\n\nTom gave a smack dead-on-the-money terrific performance as weary, cynical and suicidal Detective Ray Cameron in the delightful Die Nacht der Creeps (1986) (this movie is Tom's personal favorite among all the horror films he has acted in). He was once again excellent as the similarly burnt-out Lt. Frank McCrae in the fine Maniac Cop (1988) and impressive as the guilt-ridden heroin smuggler Michael Hunsaker in the exciting blockbuster Lethal Weapon - Zwei stahlharte Profis (1987). Atkins had a recurring part as Lt. Alex Diehl on the television series Detektiv Rockford - Anruf gen√ºgt (1974); he reprised this character in several spin-off made-for-TV movies. Among the television series Tom has done guest spots on are Oz - H√∂lle hinter Gittern (1997), Xena: Die Kriegerprinzessin (1995), Walker, Texas Ranger (1993), Der Equalizer (1985), Spenser (1985), Ein Colt f√ºr alle F√§lle (1981), Lou Grant (1977), Baretta (1975) and M*A*S*H (1972).

He was of English, Irish, and Italian descent. Forster first became interested in acting while attending Rochester's Madison High School, where he performed as a song-and-dance man in musical revues. After graduating in 1959, Forster attended Heidelberg College, Alfred University and the University of Rochester on football scholarships and continued to perform in student theatrical revues.\n\nAfter earning a BA in Psychology from Rochester in 1963, Forster took an apprenticeship at an East Rochester theater where he performed in such plays as \"West Side Story\". He moved to New York City in 1965, where his first big break came when he landed the lead in the two-character play \"Mrs. Dally Has a Lover\", opposite Arlene Francis. However, after the play ran its course work was hard to find in the theater. Forster returned to Rochester, where he worked as a substitute teacher and construction worker until an agent from 20th Century-Fox offered him a five-picture deal. His movie debut was a small part in the drama Spiegelbild im goldenen Auge (1967), which starred Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando. Forster went on to appear in small and minor roles alongside some top Hollywood actors in films like Der gro√üe Schweiger (1968) and Medium Cool (1969), and a large part in Alexandria - Treibhaus der S√ºnde (1969). Although he continued to act in feature films, he took the part of a hard-boiled detective in the short-lived TV series Los Angeles 1937 (1971).\n\nForster also appeared in notable parts in Das schwarze Loch (1979), Avalanche (1978) and as the lead in the cult horror flick Der Horror-Alligator (1980), and played the part of a factory worker-turned-vigilante in the thriller Streetfighters (1982). Forster also took the lead as a taxi driver in The Hard Way (1985) by director Norbert Meisel. A series of action flicks followed, the most notable being Delta Force (1986), starring Chuck Norris. By the late 1980s Forster's acting career had begun to slide, and he was getting less and less work; if there was any, he would be cast in small parts playing villains. Forster then began to work as a motivational speaker and an acting coach in Hollywood film schools.\n\nHowever, in the mid-1990s, his career was resurrected by writer-director Quentin Tarantino, a big fan of Forster's early work, who offered him an audition for a part in his latest movie. After a seven-hour audition, Tarantino cast Forster as the tough but sympathetic bail bondsman Max Cherry in Jackie Brown (1997), which netted him an Academy Award nomination and a measure of recognition, both nationwide and within his own profession, landing him more high-profile roles in such films as Rage - Irrsinnige Gewalt (1999), Gus Van Sant's Psycho (1998)--a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film--and Supernova (2000). Forster continued to act in many big-budget Hollywood productions for the next two decades.\n\nForster died on October 11, 2019, in Los Angeles, California, aged 78.

Brown III was born in 1959 in Urbana, Ohio, to Joyce Helen (Eldridge), a concert pianist, conductor, and composer, and Clarence J. \"Bud\" Brown, Jr., who helped manage the Brown Publishing Company, the family-owned newspaper started by Clancy's grandfather, Clarence J. Brown. Clancy's father and grandfather were also Republican congressmen from the same Ohio district, and Clancy spent much of his youth in close proximity to Washington, D.C. He plied his dramatic talents in the Chicago theatre scene before moving onto feature film with a sinister debut performance bullying Sean Penn inside a youth reformatory in Bad Boys - Klein und gef√§hrlich (1983). He portrayed Viktor the Monster in the unusual spin on the classic Frankenstein story in Die Braut (1985), before scoring one of his best roles to date as the evil Kurgan hunting fellow immortals Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery across four centuries of time in Highlander: Es kann nur einen geben (1986).\n\nBrown played a corrupt American soldier in the Walter Hill-directed hyper-violent action film Ausgel√∂scht (1987), another deranged killer in M√∂rderischer Vorsprung (1988) and a brutal prison guard, who eventually somewhat \"befriends\" wrongfully convicted banker Tim Robbins, in the moving Die Verurteilten (1994). His superb vocal talents were in demand, and he contributed voices to animated series, including Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm (1995), Street Sharks (1994), Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles (1994) and Superman (1996). Brown then landed two more plum roles, one as a \"tough-as-nails\" drill sergeant in the science fiction thriller Starship Troopers (1997), and the other alongside Robin Williams in the Disney comedy Flubber (1997).\n\nThe video gaming industry took notice of Clancy's vocal abilities, too, and he has contributed voices to several top selling video games, including Crash Bandicoot: Der Zorn des Cortex (2001), Lands of Lore III (1999), Star Wars: Bounty Hunter (2002) and Crash Nitro Kart (2003).

A popular and friendly personality, Clancy Brown continues to remain busy both through his vocal and acting talents in Hollywood.\n\nBlond, blue-eyed, tall and handsome Dutch actor Rutger Hauer enjoyed an international reputation for playing everything from romantic leads to action heroes to sinister villains. Hauer was born in Breukelen, a Dutch town and former municipality in the province of Utrecht.\n\nHe was the son of Teunke Hauer (n√©e Mellema) and Arend Hauer, actors who operated an acting school. As his parents were often touring, he and his three sisters were raised by a nanny. A bit of a rebel during his childhood, he chafed at the rules and rigors of school and was often getting into mischief. His grandfather had been the captain of a schooner and at age fifteen, Hauer ran away to work on a freighter for a year. Like his great-grandfather, Hauer was color-blind, which prevented him from furthering his career as a sailor.\n\nUpon his return he attended night school and started working in the construction industry. When he again bombed at school, his parents enrolled him in drama classes. An amateur poet, he spent most of his time writing poetry and hanging out in Amsterdam coffee houses instead of studying. He was expelled for poor attendance and afterward spent a brief period in the Dutch navy.\n\nDeciding he didn't like military life, Hauer honed his acting skills trying to convince his superiors he was mentally unfit and was sent to a special home for psych patients. It was an unpleasant place, but Hauer remained there until he had convinced his ranking officers that the military really did not need him.\n\nMichael Ironside has made a strong and indelible impression with his often incredibly intense and explosive portrayals of fearsome villains throughout the years. He was born as Frederick Reginald Ironside on February 12, 1950 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Ironside was a successful arm wrestler in his teenage years. His initial ambition was to be a writer. At age fifteen, Michael wrote a play called \"The Shelter\" that won first prize in a Canada-wide university contest; He used the prize money to mount a production of this play. Ironside attended the Ontario College of Art, took acting lessons from Janine Manatis, and studied for three years at the Canadian National Film Board. Ironside worked in construction as a roofer prior to embarking on an acting career.\n\nIronside first began acting in movies in the late 1970s. He received plenty of recognition with his frightening turn as deadly and powerful psychic Darryl Revok in David Cronenberg's Scanners - Ihre Gedanken k√∂nnen t√∂ten (1981). He was likewise very chilling as vicious misogynistic psychopath Colt Hawker in the underrated Das Horror-Hospital (1982). Other memorable film roles include weary Detective Roersch in the sadly forgotten thriller Gehetzt (1983), the crazed Overdog in the immensely enjoyable Spacehunter - J√§ger im All (1983), the hard-nosed Jester in the blockbuster smash Top Gun (1986), ramrod Major Paul Hackett in Ausgel√∂scht (1987), loner Vietnam veteran \"Ben\" in Die Unbarmherzigen (1987), the ferocious Lem Johnson in Watchers - gnadenlos gejagt (1988), and lethal immortal General Katana in Highlander II - Die R√ºckkehr (1991).\n\nMoreover, Ironside has appeared in two highly entertaining science fiction features for Paul Verhoeven: At his savage best as the evil Richter in Total Recall - Die totale Erinnerung (1990) and typically excellent as the rugged Lieutenant Jean Rasczak in Starship Troopers (1997). Ironside showed a more tender and thoughtful side with his lovely and touching performance as a hardened convict who befriends a disabled man in the poignant indie drama gem Raw Deal (1991); he also co-wrote the script and served as an executive producer for this beautiful sleeper. Michael was terrific as tough mercenary Ham Tyler on the epic miniseries V: Die au√üerirdischen Besucher kommen zur√ºck (1984), its follow up V: Die au√üerirdischen Besucher kommen (1984), and subsequent short-lived spin-off series.\n\nIronside also had a recurring role on the television series SeaQuest (1993).

More recently, Ironside garnered a slew of plaudits and a Gemini Award nomination for his outstanding portrayal of shrewd biker gang leader Bob Durelle in the acclaimed Canadian miniseries The Last Chapter II: The War Continues (2003).\n\nIn addition to his substantial film and television work, Ironside has also lent his distinctive deep voice to TV commercials and video games."
