Cannon (Tommy Cannon) and PC Ball (Bobby Ball) run the police station in the quiet town of Little Botham.

When they try to steal a painting from a local rich businessman (Roy Kinnear), they accidently stumble across a gang of real art thieves who have just stolen Â£1 million worth of paintings. It is up to the two bungling cops to stop them escaping with their haul.",
