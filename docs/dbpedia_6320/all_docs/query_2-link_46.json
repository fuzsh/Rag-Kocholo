        "text": "Before it became a critically acclaimed superhero television series from steaming giant Prime Video, The Boys was a comic book series written by Garth Ennis and co-created, designed, and illustrated by Darick Robertson. Whether you’re a longtime fan or a recent initiate, you can experience the graphic novels in an all-new medium by listening to full-cast audio adaptations with an inventive soundscape. But before you jump headfirst into the gritty world of The Boys, here's the lowdown on absolutely everything you need to know.\n\nThe Boys was originally published in 2006—DC Comics's Wildstorm imprint released six issues of the comic before canceling the series. In February 2007, it was picked up by Dynamite Entertainment, which resumed publication of the series in May of that year. The Boys continued with Dynamite through 2014; in total, 72 issues were published.\n\nWarning: Though we've avoided some big reveals and minute details, the following explainer contains major plot spoilers for The Boys graphic novels and the television adaptation of the same name.\n\nWhat is The Boys about?\n\nThe Boys is set in 2006 through 2008 in a world where superheroes are absolutely everywhere—and not all they're cracked up to be in movies and comic books. These real-life superheroes are corrupted by their celebrity status and as a result, often put people and the planet in danger. The Boys are a CIA team who monitor superheroes. Oh, and if the superheroes get out of line? They have to be taken out. The team is comprised of leader Billy Butcher, Mother's Milk, the Female, and the Frenchman.\n\nThe very beginning of The Boys comic series sees a new addition to the team. \"Wee\" Hughie Campbell joins The Boys after his girlfriend is killed by The Seven, a team of superheroes, and The Boys' biggest rival. The comics also follow the story of Annie \"Starlight\" January, a young superhero who joins The Seven. Annie and Hughie start a relationship with each other, although they keep their true identities a secret.\n\nThe Boys is known for its ultra-violence and cynical outlook on the world, but the series explores many significant and often poignant themes. The story examines the nature of power and how fame and remarkable ability can corrupt. The Boys takes a hard look at the myth of the American dream and the pitfalls of capitalism. With the disillusionment many have felt in recent years, now seems like the perfect time to listen to The Boys in audio and reflect on the significance of this story.\n\nWhat happens in the The Boys audiobooks?\n\nThe Boys audiobooks are divided into six volumes, each featuring a stellar full-cast recording. The talented performers include Dave Coyne, Eric Messner, KenYatta Rogers, Matthew Bassett, Chris Genebach, Laura C. Harris, Scott McCormick, Christopher Walker, Richard Rohan, Amanda Forstrom, Evan Casey, Kimberley Gilbert, Jonathan Watkins, Matthew Pauli, Dawn Ursula, Nick DePinto, Frank Britton, Jonathon Church, Scott Bruffey, Steve Wannall, Henry Kramer, Jonathan Feuer, Terence Aselford, Lawrence Redmond, Chris Stinson, Andy Brownstein, Ken Jackson, Bradley Smith, Elaine Yuko Qualter, Andrew Quilpa, Colleen Delany, Michael Glenn, Sasha Olinick, Karen Novak, and Nanette Savard. On the production side, GraphicAudio and Dynamite Comics present all the action and adventure of the comics through this dynamic cast, immersive sound effects, and cinematic music.\n\nHere's a quick rundown of what you can expect from each volume of The Boys in audio.\n\nThis volume includes the first 14 issues of The Boys. The first six issues in the series see Hughie introduced to this CIA-backed team of very dangerous people dedicated to monitoring and controlling those with superpowers. When superheroes get out of hand, The Boys come in to take care of business. After Hughie gets to know the team's members, the next half of this volume focuses on dark avenger Tek-Knight and his ex-partner, SwingWing. The duo is in big trouble: one has lost control of his overactive sex drive and the other might be a murderer. But first, it’s up to Hughie and Butcher to figure out which hero is which. Next, The Boys travel to Russia to confront an out-of-control corporate super-conspiracy.\n\nVolume 2 of The Boys, made up of the next 16 issues, sets a lot in motion for our main characters. Frenchie and the Female are up to no good with the Mafia; Mother's Milk reconnects with his mom; Annie January reaches out to God himself; and Butcher gets involved in another tryst with CIA Director Rayner. Hughie, wanting to learn everything about The Boys, turns to the Legend for answers. Of course, those answers come with a price—Hughie has to take a walk with the dead. Meanwhile, Silver Kincaid, one of the original G-Men, has recently died by suicide. Where will that loss leave G-Force, G-Coast, G-Style, G-Wiz, the G-Brits, and the G-Nomads?\n\nVolume 3 sees the world's mightiest heroes teaming up for an annual event like no other. But this year, the stakes are higher than ever. Payback, a super team of unimaginable power, is coming for The Boys. (Apparently, you can only eliminate superheroes for so long before people start getting agitated.) Will the team be able to win against Soldier Boy, Mind-Droid, Swatto, the Crimson Countess, and Stormfront?\n\nIn Volume 4, Hughie meets a group of teenage adventurers called SUPERDUPER. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to Hughie, Butcher has finally learned his secret. And at BELIEVE, a superhero evangelist festival, Hughie's relationship with Annie January reaches its conclusion. This volume also features a special side story in which Hughie returns home.\n\nAll the pieces are falling into place in the fifth volume of The Boys. With the long-dreaded superhuman conflict on the horizon, there are still plenty of secrets still to be uncovered. This volume includes the team's first encounter with The Seven, a fateful meeting that left a long-lingering impact. Meanwhile, Colonel Greg Mallory, the original leader of The Boys, takes Hughie on a journey through 60 years of their past operations. Then, a shadowy force sets events in motion that will push everyone—good guys and bad guys alike—over the edge.\n\nAfter a long build up, the Homelander finally sets an army of superheroes against the US military. Now Billy Butcher and The Boys must do what they've been trained for: take out each and every last superhero. As the battle rages on, Mother's Milk discovers a horrible secret at Vought-American, and Wee Hughie uncovers the shocking truth behind the Butcher's plans.\n\nWho are the main characters of The Boys?\n\nThe Boys features a large cast of significant characters. Here are some of the most important characters in the series and how they factor into the story.\n\nA-Train is a member of The Seven whose power is super-speed. He is the superhero who accidentally kills Hughie's girlfriend in the first issue. A-Train is impulsive and juvenile. He's known for his recklessness, his frequent use of drugs, and his extreme violence.\n\nBilly Butcher is the current leader of The Boys. Butcher was recruited by the team's founder, Greg Mallory, and he originally served as the second-in-command. Depending on what the situation calls for, Butcher can be terribly threatening or incredibly charming. He is large in stature and prone to violence. While many characters in the story drink heavily or are addicted to drugs, Butcher prefers to remain sober to avoid unnecessarily reckless behavior.\n\nBlack Noir is a member of The Seven who is often shown in shadow, the darkness obscuring his face. His power is super-strength. It is later revealed that Black Noir is actually a clone of the Homelander, created as a contingency plan in case the leader of The Seven becomes a liability.\n\nFrenchie: The Frenchman, a.k.a. \"Frenchie,\" is one of the original Boys. Like many characters in this comic series, Frenchie is prone to violent outbursts, especially when his home country of France or his native people are attacked. Frenchie serves as the muscles of the team alongside The Female, and the two share a very close friendship.\n\nColonel Greg Mallory is the founder of the CIA black ops team later dubbed \"The Boys\" by Billy Butcher. Mallory is a WWII veteran who made it his life-long mission to stop Vought-American from incorporating superheroes into the United States Military. Later in the comics, it's Mallory who reveals the backstory of The Boys to their newest member, Hughie.\n\nThe Homelander is the leader of The Seven. He's a patriotic superhero created by Vought-American to become the world's most powerful superhuman. He spent most of his youth chained to a hydrogen bomb so that he would not escape. Yet, despite their mistreatment of him, The Homelander remains loyal to VA because they finance The Seven's hedonistic lifestyle. As the series continues, however, his character becomes more rebellious.\n\nHughie Campbell, often called \"Wee Hughie,\" is the main character of the comic series and the newest member of The Boys. Hughie first experiences superheroes and their reckless power when his girlfriend Robin is killed by A-Train. While many characters in this series are incredibly violent and willing to do whatever it takes to meet their goals, Hughie is more hesitant, bound by a moral code that sometimes makes it difficult for him to harm others. Hughie is a genuinely decent person who is willing to risk his life to protect others. (Fun fact: In the comics, Hughie was intentionally drawn to resemble amiable actor Simon Pegg.)\n\nJames Stillwell represents Vought-American and often sits in on The Seven's meetings. Stillwell puts profit and success above all else and doesn't care who he hurts in the process. In contrast to The Seven's rowdy behavior and violent moods, Stillwell remains calm and calculated at all times.\n\nJessica Bradley is a senior officer with Vought-American. She has a close relationship with Stillwell, with the two confessing they feel safe and relaxed around one another. Unlike Stillwell, Bradley feels for the superheroes' victims and worries about the especially violent behavior of The Homelander and Black Noir.\n\nMother's Milk is the only member of The Boys, aside from Greg Mallory, who is an American citizen by birth. He received the nickname \"Mother's Milk\" because he's the most pure-hearted member of the team. Of all the members of the group, Mother's Milk is the only one who remains in touch with Greg Mallory after his retirement. Mother's Milk also has a close friendship with Hughie.\n\nQueen Maeve is a long-time member of The Seven whose superpowers include super-strength, flight, and invulnerability. Queen Maeve was deeply affected by the events of September 11th—it's implied that the trauma and her team's poor handling of the attacks leads her to alcoholism. She loathes The Homelander and the rest of The Seven, which is why she eventually helps The Boys plant surveillance cameras in The Seven's headquarters.\n\nStarlight is the newest member of The Seven. As a former member of the Young Americans superhero organization and a conservative Christian, Starlight is shocked to discover just how corrupt her new team is. Under her secret identity Annie January, she starts a romantic relationship with Hughie, although neither knows the other's true identity.\n\nStormfront is the most powerful member of the super-team known as Payback. His name is a reference to a Neo Nazi website of the same name. Stormfront was exposed to a very powerful and unique version of Compound V as a member of the Hitler Youth. Rather than destroying him for his connection to Nazi Germany, Vought-American uses his genetic material in the creation of The Homelander and Black Noir. Stormfront is unapologetically racist and a staunch supporter of Nazism.\n\nThe Deep is a member of The Seven whose superpowers are super-strength, flight, and durability. The Deep lives in a diving suit, claiming that he has to leave his helmet on due to an Atlantean curse. Of all the members of The Seven, The Deep is the most mature and level-headed.\n\nThe Female, also known as \"The Female of the Species,\" is the only woman in The Boys—and their most brutal member. She also suffers from select mutism. The Female has a close friendship with Frenchie.\n\nVictor Neuman is the neoconservative vice president of the United States. It's highly likely that he and his family are all directly connected to Vought-American.\n\nHow does The Boys television adaptation differ from the graphic novel?\n\nThe Boys has also been adapted into a critically acclaimed television series developed by Eric Kripke for Prime Video. The series stars Karl Urban as William \"Billy\" Butcher, Jack Quaid as Hugh \"Hughie\" Campbell Jr., Antony Starr as Homelander, Erin Moriarty as Starlight, Dominique McElligott as Queen Maeve, Jessie T. Usher as A-Train, Laz Alonso as Mother's Milk, Chace Crawford as The Deep, Tomer Capon as Frenchie, Karen Fukuhara as The Female, Nathan Mitchell as Black Noir, Elisabeth Shue as Madelyn Stillwell, Colby Minifie as Ashley Barrett, and Aya Cash as Stormfront. Additionally, Simon Pegg, who was the visual inspiration for Hughie, plays Hughie's father in the series.\n\nIn adapting the comics for streaming, there were quite a few changes made—some large and some small. Despite its differences, the television show has received appreciation from longtime fans of the source material. Among the most notable changes in the series:\n\nThere have been some big changes to the protagonist Hughie.\n\nIn the comics, the character is Scottish. In the TV series, Hughie is American. In the comics, Hughie is obsessed with conspiracy theories. Instead, in the TV series, he loves music and superheroes.\n\nThere's a whole lot of gender-swapping in the television adaptation of The Boys.\n\nThe character Stormfront is a woman in the TV show. Additionally, Victor Neuman has been changed to Victoria Neuman; Greg Mallory is Grace Mallory; and James Stillwell has been changed to Madelyn Stillwell.\n\nRather than being outspokenly bigoted and racist, Stormfront is a closeted Nazi in the TV series.\n\nIn the show, she uses social media to develop her following and get her message out to the public.\n\nButcher’s wife suffers a different fate in the comics.\n\nButcher's wife is sexually assaulted by Homelander in both the comics and the TV series, but in the comics, she is killed by Homelander's super-powered fetus growing inside of her. In the TV series, she goes into hiding after learning she is carrying his child.\n\nSo, what can we expect from The Boys season 3?\n\nThe Boys returned to Prime Video late on Thursday, June 2nd, with three no-holds-barred episodes that got fans talking—and waiting in rapt anticipation for the next episode drop. While we don’t want to spoil too much for you, let’s leave it at: Brace yourself. It’s a heck of a season opener.\n\nThis season, we can also look forward to new characters. Joining the cast are Jensen Ackles as Soldier Boy, Laurie Holden as Crimson Countess, Sean Patrick Flanery as Gunpowder, Miles Gaston Villanueva as Supersonic, and Nick Wechsler as Blue Hawk. To get a better idea of the bold storytelling (and brutality) in store, check out the trailer released for the third season.\n\nWarning: The following trailer contains depictions of graphic violence and adult themes not suitable for all viewers."
