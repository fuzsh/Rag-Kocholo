        "text": "This story originally ran March 12 and has been updated several times with news on The Boy and the Heron’s home releases.\n\nPrepare for parakeet poo, because this year’s Best Animated Feature is heading to streaming. The Boy and the Heron, the box-office-smashing anime film directed by Hayao Miyazaki, will follow its Studio Ghibli forebears to stream on Max in the United States on September 6. The Japanese movie may already be available on physical media and digital platforms via GKIDS, but it’s a latecomer when it comes to the major awards-season films available to stream. The acclaimed director’s film is partly autobiographical, informed by his and his family’s experiences witnessing the horrors of World War II.\n\nThe move to Max — which was announced March 12, two days after it won the Oscar — was expected. All the other Studio Ghibli films, which are distributed in the U.S. by indie shop GKIDS, have called it their streaming home since the app’s launch as HBO Max in 2020. In the years since, they’ve remained on the service despite parent company Warner Bros. Discovery’s merger, the relaunch into Max, and the ensuing content purges the company brought to its flagship streamer. News of The Boy and the Heron’s streaming status came as part of a multiyear extension of WBD and GKIDS’s licensing agreement, so all of the Ghibli films should remain on the service for the foreseeable future."
