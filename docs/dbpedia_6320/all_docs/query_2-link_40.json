        "text": "Movies that open in less than 1,500 screens are not automatically polled or reported on social media or on the CinemaScore website. If a film opens in less than 1,500 screens, CinemaScore either doesn't poll the film at all or may be contracted privately (by the filmâ€™s studio or producers) to conduct a survey. These private CinemaScore surveys use exactly the same methodology as public surveys, the only difference being that results are proprietary to the studio or producers. CinemaScore does not report private survey results unless the contracting party wishes to have CinemaScore disclose the scores to the public."
