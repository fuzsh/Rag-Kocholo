        "text": "It finally happened. A whole freaking century of existence. People like Pat Powers, P. L. Travers, Ben Shapiro, and Bob Chapek tried to destroy it. Commercial failures like The Black Cauldron, Strange World, Home on the Range, and Treasure Planet caused them to stumble. We’ve seen them try to sell us terrible things like the second incarnation of Journey into Imagination, a Maui body suit, Mickey Mouse gas masks, and movies with premium access fees on Disney+. They’ve stayed abreast amid multiple controversies, like cast member pay, copyright law, working with China for the Mulan remake, and the accusations of being an anti-semite. And yet through it all, they’ve committed to making art (which is always up for debate), and they remain in business thanks to their unerring ability to touch our hearts. Disney has been happy to flash that magical three-digit number everywhere to impress its clientele, but arguably its true moment to celebrate was a short that premiered on ABC on October 15th, then on Disney+ the following day. That short was Once Upon a Studio.\n\nThe short starts with Mickey and Minnie Mouse hopping out of a framed photo and plan a group photo to celebrate the anniversary. Soon, 543 characters from various shorts and movies hop to life and gather outside the Roy O. Disney Animation Building.\n\nIt’s a great short. There’s a lot it does right. I’d hesitate to say it does anything wrong, but I do have some notes. But let’s talk about the good stuff.\n\nRobin Williams. In its number one selling point in their marketing hype, Disney shared with the public that a never-before-used archival recording of Robin Williams he did for Aladdin would be unearthed exclusively for this short. To the average Joe, this was incredible news. Robin passed in 2014, nine years ago, and our hearts have ached ever since. The Genie was one of his most career-defining roles, and no matter how hard others tried, no one could pull it off as well as he did. But there’s more to it than that. Jeffrey Katzenberg and Disney proper went out of their way to screw over the comedian during production, as the man had terms and conditions they didn’t feel like abiding by. The man recorded hours upon hours of gags and skits and jokes that didn’t get used in the final film, and when he died, it was revealed that Robin had one last “screw you” for the company: absolutely none of those recordings could be used without permission from his estate for 25 years after his death, in 2039. So clearly, they got the stamp of approval from Williams’ family and legal team, and we got to hear an original Robin joke from him.\n\nBut it gets better. Genie shares screen time with Olaf from Frozen. Olaf’s actor, Josh Gad, tweeted about the sensitivity of the situation, adding that he got into voice acting thanks to Robin. The man got to share screen time with his idol and said if he had any concern that this was not done above board, and with reverence, he would not have participated.\n\nBut it goes even deeper. Seconds before the Genie explodes onto the screen, the most surprising cameo (to me) was seeing Robin the lost boy. I’ve talked at length about this before, but as a recap: Robin Williams appeared alongside Walter Cronkite in a 1989 short film called Back to Neverland that played only at Disney-MGM Studios’ Magic of Disney Animation attraction through 2004. In that short, Robin tells Walter he loves Peter Pan, and thus, the legendary news anchor walks him through the process, making him a lost boy facing Captain Hook. The short was so influential that Williams’ vacation clothes – a loud, yellow Hawaiian shirt and a Goofy hat – were made an Easter egg in Aladdin‘s finale. And to see Robin, the lost boy, make a brief appearance, particularly alongside the Genie and one of Robin’s biggest fans was a hell of a treat.\n\nThe commitment to the original artistry. The loss of 2D animation has remained a difficult pain for many Disney fans. Aside from the smattering of animated projects like the three Goofy shorts from 2020, we haven’t seen a hand-drawn animated movie since 2011’s Winnie the Pooh. Once again, the animation team showed what they do best and made these characters look as good as they’ve ever been. From what I can see, Disney brought back various animators who were the original supervising animators of their respective characters like Will Finn (Iago and Cogsworth), Eric Goldberg (The Genie), James Baxter (Belle), Ruben Aquino (Ursula), Nik Ranieri (Hades, Kuzco, and Lumiere), Tony Bancroft (Pumbaa), and Alex Kuperschmidt (Stitch). Almost none of the characters looked off-model or even carelessly scrawled.\n\nIt’s worth drawing attention to how well the CGI characters like Antonio Madrigal, Sisu the dragon, Moana, Flash the Sloth, and Fix-it Felix interacted with their hand-drawn co-stars, but for me, one slightly imperceptible detail got me hella stoked. During the trailer released a month prior, I gawked at Colonel Hathi and Winnifred (‘Cause Jungle Book fans gotta stan) when I saw a flickering line down the front of Winnifred’s trunk. An animation error? Yes and no. To streamline the animation process, Disney developed the Xerox process, which allowed animators’ drawings to be copied straight to the animation cels. This meant they were charged with erasing as much of their construction lines as they could, but this left characters from 101 Dalmatians in 1961 to Oliver & Company in 1988 with a very scratchy texture and flickering lines. In the short proper, I saw this on Merlin, too. Really think about that level of dedication when it would have been SO MUCH EASIER to make all the 2D characters look like they were drawn the same. Particularly for an effect most people can’t identify or even see.\n\nThe voice cast. I’m always kind of mystified at how Disney regards their voice casts. On one hand, they do everything within their power to get back OG actors to reprise roles, whether it’s the latest Kingdom Hearts game, the newest ride at California Adventure, or latest spinoff in the franchise. And this short was no exception. It wasn’t just Robin Williams. I fully expected Bill Farmer (Goofy and Pluto), Josh Gad (Olaf), Jim Cummings (Winnie the Pooh), James Woods (Hades), Jodi Benson (Ariel), Scott Adsit (Baymax), Anika Noni-Rose (Tiana), Scott Weinger (Aladdin) and Auli’i Cravalho (Moana). I didn’t expect but am not at all surprised hearing the vast array of archival recordings I fully recognized from their original source material, such as Eric Blore (Mr. Toad), Jeremy Irons (Scar), Pat Carroll (Ursula), My Hero Sterling Holloway (Winnie the Pooh, Kaa, Cheshire Cat), Dwayne Johnson (Maui), David Spade (Kuzco), Bobby Driscoll (Peter Pan) Verna Felton (Flora), Billy Joel (Dodger) Barbara Luddy (Merriweather), and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Jim Hawkins).\n\nStill, many of their replacements were pretty good. Alan Tudyk’s King Candy made him perfect as the Mad Hatter. I’ve heard Bob Joles as Bagheera in The Jungle Book 2, and I think he did decent as Cogsworth. I miss Ed Gilbert, and while Jim Cummings wouldn’t have been my first choice as Baloo, I wasn’t able to tell right away. No one can replace Gilbert Gottfried, yet that was Piotr Mixhael as Iago. But the biggest surprises were the actors they DID bring aboard and the ones they chose to leave silent. For example, Nathan Lane has a ton of stage and screen credits, to the point where Timon from The Lion King is barely a blip on his resumé, but he calls Olaf “Frosty”. On the flip side, Ernie Sabella (Pumbaa) was not present, despite he’s front and center most every Lion King appearance, and his biggest screen credit is (Arguably) the naked guy on the subway in that one episode of Seinfeld. Corey Burton has voiced Captain Hook reliably since the eighties, and yet he’s silent here. Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Ginnifer Goodwin, and Jason Bateman are all busy actors, but they still took time out of their schedules to drop by for Anna, Elsa, Judy Hopps, and Nick Wilde. It was cool hearing Richard White again as Gaston. Little Ravi Cabot-Conyers reappeared as little Antonio Madrigal. I was shocked Tom Hulce returned as Quasinodo. Daisy Duck hardly had any screen time, much less with her official performer, Tress Macnielle. Regardless, what we did get was a treat for the ears.\n\nThe cameos I didn’t expect. Here’s what I’ve learned from what I call “Ain’t Disney Great” projects: with a catalog as vast and popular as Disney’s, whenever they want to put together a montage or group shot of a wide array of Disney animated characters, it’s expected they limit characters by most popular and little further. Mulan fans will rarely see more beyond Mulan and Mushu. 101 Dalmatians are almost wholly represented by Cruella DeVil, Pongo and Perdita. As a Jungle Book fan, I’m lucky I get King Louie, as most of the time, it’s just Baloo and Mowgli. If you love Emperor’s New Groove, Atlantis, The Rescuers, or Chicken Little, you’re just about guaranteed to be out of luck. But the stops were most certainly pulled out, drawing from literally all 62 animated features from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to November’s Wish. Not even including Mickey and pals, there were a surprising number of cameos from projects I didn’t even think they would acknowledge. I already mentioned Robin the lost boy. Johnny Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet? Cool. Art and Dot from 2021’s Us Again? Surprising. Susie the Little Blue Coupe? Startling. Lambert the Sheepish Lion? Nuts! And it didn’t stop there! The Reluctant Dragon! Pedro the Mail Plane! John Henry! Katrina van Tassel and Brom Bones! George from Paperman! Gopher from Winnie the Pooh! Nessie! John, Duke, Susie, and Joe from Fantasia 2000‘s Rhapsody in Blue sequence! Small One! Paul from Inner Workings! Wayne and Lanny from Prep and Landing! Slue Foot Sue! So many of these characters are hard to identify, even if you’re a hard-core Disnerd like me. And yet, here they are!\n\nOne set of characters I want to bring up is the cast of Tarzan. Tarzan, Terk, Tantor, Jane, Kala, Kerchack, and Clayton all appear in the final cast photo. Tarzan is still under copyright by the Edgar Rice Burroughs estate. Thus, Disney refuses to do anything with them to avoid paying royalties. It would have been a pretty glaring oversight to not include them, sure, but it was super nice to see them once again.\n\nThat moment with Walt. The moment that certainly got everyone directly in the feels was right after Rapunzel conked Kaa on the head with her skillet. Mickey catches sight of a large photo of Walt Disney, and he looks on with heartfelt appreciation. What I liked about this moment most was how simple and quiet it was.\n\nIt would have been so damn easy to drop in an AI Walt spouting one of his oft-capitalized catchphrases, shaking hand with Mickey, but luckily, it was reeled in to just a momentary calm moment amid the insanity of the chaos. It was pretty reverent and respectful that way. Kudos.\n\nNow that we took care of all the cool stuff, I want to share my notes. Nothing bad, of course. Just bear with me, if you please.\n\nThe cameos that didn’t happen.\n\nBefore I start this entry, let me start by addressing two things. One, as I addressed in my Kingdom Hearts list, I understand I have an issue with never being satisfied with my Disney crossovers. Whether it’s House of Mouse, Disney Heroes: Battle Mode, or Once Upon a Time, after the thrill of seeing a huge Disney crossover, it wears off pretty quickly as I start to pick apart who was there and who wasn’t. I totally get that’s a flaw on my part and mine alone; this is just me warning you, dear reader. Second, I’m not going to be so pedantic as to say something like “Well, for Meet The Robinsons, they had Carl the Robot, Lewis, Wilbur, Bowler Hat Guy, and Lucille Krunklehorn…but where’s Francine? Uncle Art? Goob? Lefty the Octopus? ZERO OUT OF TEN!!” Of course not. That’d be pathetic. So as a rule, I allowed entries from projects that simply weren’t represented.\n\nRoger Rabbit\n\nThis was arguably the number one character I’ve heard people ask about. And given we saw animated characters from live-action/animated hybrid movies, to see the titular character from the gold standard of crossovers himself was surprising. That is, until you dig a little deeper.\n\nYou might have noticed no characters from literally any subsidiary of the company were involved. Despite the anniversary was for the company as a whole, they stuck to purely to Walt Disney Animation Studios. That means no Muppets, no Lucasfilm, no Marvel, and no Pixar. Who Framed Roger Rabbit was animated at Elstree Studios in LA, and later London, neither of which are WDAS. To top it off, the movie was a coproduction between Disney and Amblin Entertainment, and even then, under Touchstone Pictures. Even today, neither studio can seem to agree on who owns the rights. But it seems it’s already enough that old Roger wasn’t drawn anywhere near WDAS, thus excluding him entirely.\n\nGiselle\n\n2007’s Enchanted was also not animated by WDAS, but unlike Roger, it was released directly under the Walt Disney Pictures banner. Also, you might have noticed Giselle was never promoted to official Disney princess. This is because if you recall in the movie, Amy Adam’s doesn’t just play Giselle, she is Giselle: her animated self had to look like her. Because of this, if Disney wanted to make merchandise or further projects with her, they’d need to secure legal rights to Amy Adam’s face, which would be expensive and likely not worth it.\n\nJulius the Cat\n\nI knew they were going to do whatever they could to celebrate the antiquity of the studio, but I worried they weren’t going to go all the way back. As you might’ve guessed, the anniversary goes all the way back to 1923. Mickey didn’t star in Steamboat Willie until five years later. Oswald appeared in the short, but he only goes back to 1927. The oldest still-working Disney character is Pegleg Pete, who first popped in a 1925 Alice comedy. How could they fill in that 2-year gap? Well, the Alice Comedies may have starred a live-action girl, but she had a sidekick in most of them: a spunky cat named Julius who actually goes as far back as the old Laugh-O-Grams shorts back in Kansas City in 1922. It would have been great to solidly mark the full centennial, but even I couldn’t expect his showing up rationally. He’s the sidekick, not the star. He looks more like Felix the Cat. He’s too nondescript. Literally a whole gag segment would be devoted to just identifying who he is, since even the most seasoned Disney stans wouldn’t have been able to tell at first blush.\n\nMilton\n\nCharacters like John Henry, Lambert, Susie the Little Blue Coupe, Paul, Dot and Art, Nessie and George were all one-shot characters. But Milton appeared in three cartoons alongside Mickey’s pal Pluto. A relatively uninteresting character, Milton was a cat who provided some conflict as a sort of mischievous adult alley cat. Unlike Figaro, a kitten, the fights between them wouldn’t be ridiculously one-sided. Like I said, he only lasted three shorts (Plutopia, Cold Turkey, and Puss Café), but his impact has been pretty minimal. Still, it’s three times more than Lambert or Susie.\n\nOrtensia\n\nThis one is arguably my biggest nitpick. With Mickey and Minnie, Donald and Daisy, all the princes and princesses, it just seemed like a jerk move to add Oswald, but not his girlfriend.\n\nProfessor Owl\n\nThis one is the one I acknowledge with the most sincerity. Sure, Professor Owl only cropped up in just two shorts: Adventures in Music: Melody and the Oscar-winning Toot, Whistle, Plunk, and Boom, both in 1953. But he gained greater fame about 35 years later as one of the hosts in the wraparound segments on the Disney Sing-Along Songs videos. He got famous enough to even appear in the intro of House of Mouse in 2001, and not even in a subtle way, either.\n\nThe Br’ers.\n\nIf I had a nickel for every time I mentioned anything Song of the South related on this blog… Yeah, I’m doing it again. I’m completely aware Disney is trying HARD to wipe their hands clean of these guys, but it’s no use: you can shut down the rides, delete the songs, and fail to include them on the company’s biggest crossover ever. But at the end of the day, the movie exists, and it was a milestone in the early decades of the company’s history. To keep ignoring them and cramming them into the crawlspace under the stairs is not a viable long-term solution.\n\nThe jokes I would’ve written.\n\nI love writing fan fiction. I love writing a story and planning out how each character would react in a given situation based on what I understand about them. Because I love my Disney crossovers, the very idea of penning a special like this would have involved me disappearing for a whole weekend and coming back with 40 tomes of notes, jokes, suggestions, scribbles, pitches, on how to make a funny, dramatic, compelling saga involving characters from all 62+ films. But I get it: I’m certain the writers were similarly passionate, and probably a lot of stuff got cut simply for time or wanted greater focus on visuals rather than dialogue. And yet, I can’t help but expound upon the types of jokes I saw or come up with new ones. At the risk of being super insulting to the writers…\n\n1. There was that great scene where Rapunzel conks Kaa on the head when he hypnotizes Clarabelle. I’m not sure who suggested her, but because she’s a cow, why not see the aftermath? Rapunzel chuckles, swinging the skillet with gusto, only to find Calarabelle is gone. Where is she? Well, Alameda Slim from Home on the Range – who can hypnotize cows and only cows with a hypnotic yodel – is prancing down the hall, singing “Yodel-Adle-Eedle-Idle-oo”, with Calarabelle giddily dancing behind. Rapunzel huffs, chuckles, grips her pan tight, and follows.\n\n2. We saw Luisa from Encanto hoisting the Home on the Range cows, Cyril Proudbottom, Rutt and Tuke, and Small One on her shoulders in one shot. I can picture Tigger encouraging Eeyore to keep up, with the donkey sluggishly mumbling that he’s coming. Suddenly, he’s flung high up and onto Luisa’s shoulders. Luisa chuckles, telling Tigger that one day, there’ll be a donkey she won’t have to carry. Just then, Little Burrito – the flying donkey from The Three Caballeros – glides by, and they both laugh.\n\n3. After swiping Scrooge McDuck/Ebenezer Scrooge’s moneybags, Robin Hood and Little John stroll down the hall when LJ asks, “Hey Rob, ever get Deja vu?” After they pass by, Baloo asks his mancub buddy, “Hey Lil” Britches, ever get Deja vu?”\n\n4. After Wreck-it Ralph stumbles out the building, he narrowly avoids getting hit by several crumbling bricks. He looks up and sees Willie (Mickey and the Beanstalk), Gustav (The Brave Little Tailor), and Paul Bunyan are bored and waiting impatiently, with drumming fingers causing structural damage. Ralph, of course, shouts, “Hey! You’re gonna wreck it!”\n\n5. We saw Mr. Toad giddily taking Aladdin’s magic carpet for a whirl. Suppose he crashes carpet, and looks up to find…Vanellope von Schweetz’ car, the Lickety Split. Toad is enraptured with longing. Cut to Vanellope and Oliver & Company‘s Dodger enjoying some hot dogs from the cafeteria, skipping back to the car, only to find J. Thaddeus Toad has…eaten most of it.\n\n6. As Robin the lost boy flies along, he breezes by Captain Hook, upsetting his hat. He and Mr. Smee are strolling down the hallway when Smee anxiously reminds his boss that Mickey wants EVERYONE there. Hook casually assures his underling that he has officially gotten over his fear of “that infernal crocodile.” Louis from Princess and the Frog almost bumps into them, pleasantly greeting, “Hey, y’all!” This, of course, causes the pirate to wail in abject terror.\n\n7. Belle and the Beast share a tender moment in the hall when Rutt and Tuke, the moose from Brother Bear, wander by. Rutt asks if she’s the mermaid. Tuke answers, “Beauty, eh.” Rutt responds, “Beauty. So she’s the sleepy one, right?”\n\n8. Taran from The Black Cauldron boasts to prince Phillip and Hercules about his heroic deeds with his sword while Eilonwy looks on, rolling her eyes. A wild swing of his sword gets it caught in the door. Taran can’t budge it free, but Wart from Sword in the Stone jostles it free easily and politely hands it back. As Taran sheepishly chuckles, the other three laugh good-naturedly.\n\n9. The sprite from Fantasia 2000 and Isabela Madrigal are working together to grow some greenery and beautify the surrounding area for the photo. As Minnie drops by and compliments their work, she warns them to go easy on the vines. As Isabela asks why, Tarzan swings by, doing his trademark yell, and scatters the flowers everywhere. Upset at first, the girls laugh heartily instead.\n\nMake no mistake: I know these things are work. Writers and animators et al should be paid what they’re worth. I’m just some punk online armchair animating for something that was already pretty damn awesome to begin with. So I’m not just some whiny troll, just a fan with an ADHD-riddled brain that won’t quit his hyperfocused fandom of choice.\n\nWhat were the stakes, exactly?\n\nConflict makes for the best entertainment, as a conflict begs the question “How can this be solved,” whether it’s a problem or a genuine battle. The whole purpose of this short was not really to tell a story, but to showcase 543 animated characters. I’ve always been of the mindset that a story need only be as good as a vehicle to let characters be characters, and I still stand by that. But the only real conflict comes in late when Goofy accidentally breaks the camera, and everyone starts to leave as though there’s no options left anymore. With all the characters with various skills and powers in virtually every capacity, it seems kind of silly that characters, even ones as pessimistic as Grumpy and Eeyore, would just give up right away.\n\nSince they were doing this after hours, maybe they could have tried to keep things down to avoid being seen. Maybe the villains could’ve hijacked the plan to make it a villains photo shoot, thinking they were going to be left out of it, only for Mickey to remind them that this is for everyone. I dunno, that was just two ideas that I came up with off the top of my head. A broken camera wasn’t a terrible plot point, but I thought they could have made it a touch more engaging with a little something extra. That’s all.\n\nFor Burny.\n\nThe last thing I want to touch upon is this short was dedicated to Burny Mattinson. Martinson was the elderly gentlemen who bemused about if the walls at the studio could talk before he and the intern leave for the day. More importantly, Burny worked at the studio for 7 straight decades, from 1953, all the way until his death earlier this year, in February of 2023. It’s a powerful reminder of the legacy that this short represented.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis was a great short and I was very happy to see so much representation of so many Disney characters, even if it wasn’t as much as I imagined it could be. But once again, I get it. That’s my hang-up and mine alone. This short was a great way of commemorating a century of Disney, and judging from the general public’s reaction to Disney in 2023, was by far the best yet.\n\nCongrats, Walt. You done good."
