        "text": "Vought Studios, formerly known as Vought-American Pictures, is a film production company and a subsidiary of Vought International. It produces films, TV shows, and streaming series based around the Vought Cinematic Universe, a shared universe of all Vought heroes.\n\nHistory[]\n\nVought-American Pictures was founded in 1952. During its early years, propaganda films like The Curse of Fu Manchu starring Bombsight were released to advertise their supes' careers and spread pro-American and anti-communist themes.\n\nFrom the 1960s to 1980s, many films were released starring members of Payback, such as Soldier Boy and Crimson Countess. Years later, the production company would rebrand as Vought Studios.\n\nSince the late 1990s, the studio prioritized producing films starring members of The Seven, as well as other supes who fill specific demographic niches.\n\nWhile some film franchises were not originally produced by Vought Studios, Vought ultimately owns the streaming and distribution rights. Examples include 1951's The Soldier Boy Story, released the year before Vought-American Pictures was established, and Terminal Beauty 3, which was produced by other production companies.\n\nLayout[]\n\nThe Vought Studios production facility in New York is the largest studio on the East Coast, featuring a massive backlot with prebuilt sets including an Antarctic science station, a Tibetan monastery, a Moon landscape, and the largest water tank in the United States for filming ocean scenes. Public tours are available daily, from 10 AM to 4 PM.\n\nProduced Content[]\n\nVought Cinematic Universe[]\n\nThe Vought Cinematic Universe (VCU) is a media franchise and shared universe centered around a series of pseudo-biographical superhero films, TV shows, and streaming series produced by Vought Studios. These cinematic productions are based on the superheroes owned by Vought, most notably including the members of The Seven. Additionally, Vought Studios' entire library is available on Vought+.\n\nFilm and TV Franchises[]\n\nSoldier Boy[]\n\nThe Soldier Boy Story (1951)\n\nGhosts of Hanoi (1982)\n\nBombsight[]\n\nThe Curse of Fu Manchu (1953)\n\nCrimson Countess[]\n\nCrimson (1967)\n\nBlack Noir[]\n\nThis Means Noir (1979)\n\nBlack Noir: Insurrection (2019)\n\nBlack Noir 3: Back to Hanoi (unreleased)\n\nPayback\n\nPayback\n\nRed Thunder (1983)\n\nWhiskey Sunrise (1984)\n\nRed Thunder 2 (1988)\n\nRed Thunder 3\n\nPolarity[]\n\nPolarity Static Heat\n\nPolarity Static Heat 2\n\nPolarity Static Heat 3\n\nArea 51 (1990s)\n\nArea 52\n\nArea 53\n\nArea 51: Reborn\n\nMesmer[]\n\nThe Mesmerizer (1993-1996; TV Series)\n\nLamplighter[]\n\nY2KAOS (1999)\n\nLight & Shadow: Journey Into Night (2015)\n\nHomelander[]\n\nHomelander: Origins\n\nHomelander: Rise of a Hero\n\nHomelander: Darkest Day\n\nHomelander: Brightest Night (2020; 18-part miniseries)\n\nHomelander: Land of the Free, Home of the Saved (unreleased)\n\nHomelander vs. Soldier Boy: Annihilation (unreleased)\n\nHomelander: Justice Served (unreleased)\n\nTranslucent[]\n\nTranslucent: Invisible Force\n\nTranslucent: Invisible Force 2 (2018)\n\nThe Deep[]\n\nThe Deep: Rising Tide (2007)\n\nNot Without My Dolphin (2022)\n\nThe Deep and the Seven Seas (unreleased)\n\nThe Deep: Lifeguard Summer (unreleased)\n\nThe Deep: Gods & Dolphins (unreleased)\n\nThe Deep: Secrets of Atlantis (unreleased)\n\nQueen Maeve[]\n\nSeveral unnamed films (1990s & 2000s)\n\nQueen Maeve: Her Majesty (Summer 2007)\n\nTeenage Kix[]\n\nTeenage Kix: Home for Kwanzaa (2008)\n\nTeenage Kix: Home for Kwanzaa 2 (unreleased)\n\nTeenage Kix: Ditch Day (unreleased)\n\nTeenage Kix: Sex-Ed (unreleased)\n\nA-Train[]\n\nRapid Transit\n\nTraining A-Train (cancelled)\n\nA-Train: Off the Tracks (unreleased)\n\nA-Train: Into the Multiverse (unreleased)\n\nPopclaw[]\n\nTerminal Beauty\n\nTerminal Beauty 2\n\nTerminal Beauty 3\n\nG-Men[]\n\nG-Men: World War (2019)\n\nG2: G-Men (unreleased)\n\nG3: G-Men (unreleased)\n\nG-Men: Days Past from the Future (unreleased)\n\nStarlight[]\n\nCitizen Starlight (2019; reality series)\n\nWrangler[]\n\nBorder Wall: Last Line of Defense (2019)\n\nWrangler: The Angel on the Border (2021)\n\nMigrant Mayhem!
