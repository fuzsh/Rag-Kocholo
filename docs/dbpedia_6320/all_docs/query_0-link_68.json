        "text": "The production of Jurassic World 4 is heading to Malta for its next phase following over a month of filming in Thailand! Thailand filming included all of the film’s stars and cast in the many lush jungle and gorgeous waterfall, river, and water-filled locations that the country offered. Behind the scenes images and possible leaks tease more about the film, and trademark filings have possibly revealed a title, all as the production shifts to a major new location in Malta – but not in the Jurassic ways you might think.\n\nJurassic World 4 begins the next stage of its production in Malta primarily in order to film extensively in large water tanks equipped with massive blue wall attachments, likely to simulate larger bodies of water or complete immersion. Water elements have been discussed as playing a major factor in the production and plot of this film. Water finds a way, after all. However, in addition to Malta Film Studios’ water tanks and stages, the production will also make use of Malta’s stunning coastline and open ocean locations.\n\nJurassic World 4 is shaping up to be visually beautiful, and the nature of production in Malta seems to confirm water settings and ideas are going to play a significant role in this film. The cast are beginning to be spotted on location in Malta as well.\n\nTo recap production so far and look at the schedule ahead:\n\nFilming began in Thailand on or around June 13th, and wrapped around July 16th\n\nFilming in Malta began in some capacity on July 16th and is estimated to be roughly six weeks in length – with some casting calls indicating the need for body doubles required from July 22nd through August 14th, and others stating the production runs July to September.\n\nUpon completion of filming in Malta, production will move to Sky Studios Elstree in the UK for at least a month of filming on stages and also with LED Volume technology.\n\nJurassic World 4 will wrap in the UK, where the production’s main base is located, on October 18th, but it’s uncertain what the full extent of UK filming will be.\n\nFurther adding to the current intrigue around this film during its production are trademark and website filings by Amblin and NBCUniversal for “Jurassic World Rebirth.” Will the title of Jurassic World 4 be Jurassic World: Rebirth?\n\nAll indications point to production moving along relatively smoothly and on-time. No film is ever completely perfect, but something feels like it is going right this time for Jurassic. David Koepp, Gareth Edwards, Scarlett Johansson – all top-tier talent. As production wraps for her in Thailand and makes its way to Malta, Scarlett Johansson has not shied away from sharing her enthusiasm and passion for the production in recent interviews on the press tour for her new film Fly Me To The Moon (and let me play among the dinosaurs).\n\nMassive thanks to ReelNews, Keeping Up With Scarlett, and Jonathan Bailey Daily for their images and reporting! Be sure to follow them and Jurassic Outpost for the latest on Jurassic World 4.\n\nThe upcoming video game Jurassic Park: Survival is in active development, and this week IGN got an exclusive look at the game and unveiled some brand new concept art and in-game screenshots! Their exclusive reveal also included new information about the game plus some hints at the plot, characters, dinosaurs and a whole lot more.\n\nA summary of the new information shared by IGN:\n\nJurassic Park: Survival will unfortunately not be released in 2024\n\nBrand new locations will feature that weren’t seen in the original movie\n\nMaya Joshi won’t be the only character in this game\n\nThere is a chance that non-movie dinosaurs will feature\n\nJurassic Park is Universal’s “most requested game”\n\nWith many a tease leading up to Summer Game Fest, Jurassic Park: Survival was expected to make an appearance – with most of us assuming a new trailer would play during the Xbox portion of the event. Unfortunately, it wasn’t meant to be, but thanks to an IGN exclusive on the anniversary of Jurassic Park’s release, we have a new behind-the-scenes look at the game.\n\nIncluded within the update was concept art that shows us new areas of the island that we might be able to explore. Also included were some new in-game screenshots – a first for this title. It’s i mportant to mention that concept art doesn’t confirm it will appear in the game, but it’s a pretty good sign that it might.\n\nThe first piece of concept art shows us an InGen building marked A1, a sort-of bunker and the Communications tower on Isla Nublar. A Jurassic Park staff jeep is parked outside, the doors wide open. A beautiful rainy night captures the island we know so perfectly, this must be the night of the storm…\n\nYou might recognize this building as the one from Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom! It’s the radio tower bunker that was first featured in that movie. The structure itself – built on Kualoa Ranch in Oahu – was part of the original Jurassic Park, but repurposed by Jurassic World staff to track the islands’ dinosaurs.\n\nWhat we are now seeing is that same – or what we assume is the same – dilapidated radio tower, but back in its prime at Jurassic Park in 1993. This is pretty damn cool and for fans of Fallen Kingdom, an awesome way to connect the two movies.\n\nNext up is an even cooler piece that will resonate with most fans: Maya Joshi rushing down the river in a yellow dinghy being pursued by two raptors.\n\nA scene originally planned for the first movie and similar to moments in the first novel featuring Dr. Grant, Tim, and Lex navigating down the river while being pursued by a T. rex. The scene never made it to production but Jurassic Park: Survival represents the perfect opportunity to bring it to life. Just the thought of having to navigate a boat of some kind down this river while being pursued by the escaped dinosaurs of Jurassic Park is very exciting.\n\nIGN also shared a few in-game screenshots from the Alpha stage of development.\n\nWe see the tropical jungle of Nublar and a stealthily approaching T. rex, three Velociraptors stalking in the night, seemingly as a pack, and then something different – the theatre. The rotating theatre from Jurassic Park in which multiple John Hammonds and Mr. DNA explain InGen’s miracle of dinosaur cloning.\n\nWe knew as much but now we see it, in-game: We will be able to walk through the Visitors Center’s many buildings and attractions. This is a fantastic aspect of this game, and is something fans have wanted since the movie was released!\n\nThese updates didn’t make everyone happy – the anticipation for a new trailer was real, but this establishes something important. The game might not be as far along as we all thought, and that is okay. More time for the game to be the best it can be is a good thing.\n\nBut the game still looks promising, and is still promising to deliver all of the things that Jurassic fans have wanted for a long time, as IGN details in their article.\n\nWhile there is a lot to unpack, the information they’ve shared is all positive and it’s hard not to remain excited. We wish they could have confirmed whether or not the game will be open world, but either way it sounds like survival will be the key, as the name implies. Here’s hoping Alien: Isolation is an inspiration for them.\n\nSaber has a lot to live up to with how long for this type of Jurassic Park game to come to fruition, and they surely understand that. That being said, let’s not push and let’s not force them in any way to rush because this game deserves the time to develop correctly. Wherever they are in the development phase right now, the first trailer holds a lot of promises for what Survival is going to be. It makes sense that the development is still going to take a while. The game will not be out in 2024, that much we know. It’s more than likely now going to be late 2025 or sometime in 2026.\n\nBut we’ll have plenty of new Jurassic to consume between now and then!\n\nThis tease from IGN was awesome, and as much as it feels like a bit of a response to the lack of appearance at Game Fest, it’s exciting just to hear and see more about the game! It’s in development, it’s on track, and it’s looking great!\n\nSort of brings to mind the kind of updates we got for… Jurassic Park: Survival… back in the day…\n\nHow excited are you to play this video game and what did you think about this update? Let us know in the comments, and stay tuned for more news!\n\nToday, a piece of film history has been unearthed. ‘Jurassic Park’ may be over 30 years old, but we are still discovering pieces of its past.\n\nMark Bushey, a prop collector who specializes in horror film artifacts, came across an amazing find from eBay.\n\n“[It is an] S-Test — Publicity Stills for Jurassic Park, dated March 02, 1993. Unlike 35mm trailers, this is not a trailer and there is no audio track anywhere on the film and the images appear horizontal, rather than vertical like traditional trailers.”\n\nWhile on the surface this strange find looks like it is merely stills from the film that we have all seen before, there is one image that stands out from the rest. I will say in advance to please NOT share the following images without giving credit to Mark Bushey. He has given us permission to use them for this article. And just to clarify, he does not have the scene itself, only the still image via the reel amongst the other still images:\n\nThe still image is from a scene/shot that was cut from ‘Jurassic Park,’ a fun moment during the arrival of the park’s guests on the island. Grant mistakes a Brachiosaurus leg for a tree trunk, which then suddenly moves. Following that we get the full reveal of the majestic animal, as shown in the final film. This brief moment was storyboarded and depicted in David Koepp’s script, but it was unknown if it was shot or had completed ILM VFX. Now, we now know both were true.\n\nIn my opinion, I can actually see why this shot was cut. While ILM’s Brachiosaurus looks amazing for its time, the dinosaur’s leg doesn’t quite match the trees as well as it was depicted in John Bell‘s storyboards (as seen above, thanks to Astrid Vega). It is possible that Spielberg later cut this moment since it’s not as effective as originally envisioned, but something he wouldn’t have known for sure until the final shot was realized.\n\nGiven that these stills were dated March of 1993, months before its June release, there is a wonder if a slightly longer cut of the film did exist at one point that included these completed moments. For years, some fans have touted seeing a longer cut (specifically in the UK by people like Jamie Arnold) during the beginning of its theatrical run. Stills of other cut scenes have been found over the years, but so far the only footage we have ever seen of one is in the film’s trailer: Ellie Sattler grabbing a leaf on their way to the Brachiosaurus. But this new Brachiosaur leg image is the first time we have seen a deleted moment that had completed VFX.\n\nWhile Mark is ecstatic with his incredibly rare find, he is willing to consider parting with it for the right price. If interested, contact him through his Facebook page.\n\n(Special thanks to Jiří Alpharaptor Schön for pointing out this amazing find!)\n\nWill we ever see an extended cut of ‘Jurassic Park?’ Will other stills of deleted scenes, or footage, find their way online in the meantime? What do you think of this newly-discovered Brachiosaur leg shot? Let us know in the comments below, and stay tuned to Jurassic Outpost for the latest news about the past and future!"
