        "text": "Amna Nawaz:\n\nOut of the depths of the Depression comes an improbable story of how nine working-class boys from the American West showed the meaning of true grit at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.\n\nThat true story was a number one New York Times bestseller and now a film of the same name, \"The Boys in the Boat,\" out on Christmas Day.\n\nStephanie Sy met up with author Daniel James Brown and director George Clooney recently in Los Angeles.\n\nIt's part of our arts and culture series, Canada.\n\nStephanie Sy:\n\nPutting the University of Washington on the map. They then rode for Olympic gold under the gaze of Hitler and the world as it was slowly reckoning with the rise of fascism, no small feat for the nine Americans or for the storytellers.\n\nDirector George Clooney explained the daunting challenge of taking on the screen version of the massively popular book. 2013's \"Boys in the Boat\" has remained on The New York Times paperback nonfiction bestseller list for 144 weeks.\n\nGeorge Clooney, Director:\n\nWhat I have the advantage of is that he's done all the work, right? He's done all the research. He's done all the hard work. He's put the story together.\n\nAnd so my only real danger is messing up his really good work. When we finished the film and showed it to Dan, my first — I walked over and I said, now, you know we didn't put everything in the movie.\n\n(Laughter)\n\nGeorge Clooney:\n\nBut our job was to make sure that we tried to capture his vision and his — the heart of his story.\n\nDaniel James Brown, Author, \"The Boys in the Boat\": And that was also what I wanted. George had me come down last August and gave me a screening, and I was really nervous. I didn't know what to expect at all.\n\nAnd about three-quarters of the way through the movie, I found myself sniffling. And by the end of the movie, I was all teared up. And it just — it really touched me.\n\nGeorge Clooney:\n\nAnd so, when it came back around, we decided we'd try and take a shot at it. These are not easy films to get made anymore, because you can't make them cheap, right? They're not a super cheap film, because there's so much technology. The rowing, you have to build the boats. You have to train the young men.\n\nBut it's not — they're not designed to be a big hit. These don't open like a Marvel film.\n\nGeorge Clooney:\n\nI like what this says about us. We remind ourselves when you see this that we're really good when we work together, and that we actually kind of root for one another even. And all those sound — that loud noise we hear, it's kind of on the fringes more so. It gets amplified a lot, but it's on the fringes more.\n\nDaniel James Brown:\n\nOne of the first things I learned was how much these guys just loved each other through the rest of their lives.\n\nI was writing this book 60, 70 years after the fact, and the last few of them, as they died one by one, they grieved deeply, because they had this enormous bond amongst themselves.\n\nDaniel James Brown:\n\nYes. Joe was abandoned by his parents. He brought himself up, so he learned that he had to do everything by himself and for himself and in his own way. He had to make this sort of transformation from sort of rugged individualism to cooperation.\n\nAnd that's part of what the movie and the book are about, is this arc from being an alienated, angry, dissatisfied individual to becoming part of something bigger than himself.\n\nDaniel James Brown:\n\nI was very aware, even 10 years ago, that there were dark forces on the rise in America, I would say. And that's gotten worse as the intervening 10 years have passed.\n\nSo I think the book was timely when I wrote it. I think it's more timely now.\n\nGeorge Clooney:\n\nThey had to be like — and they were. They didn't like him and they thought he was an autocrat and they thought he was dangerous. But they didn't know enough. And we had to be very careful not to make him — to make everyone else that aware of who he was at that moment in history.\n\nGeorge Clooney:\n\nI'm enjoying the journey, and I'm figuring things out. And I like working in different worlds, and I like succeeding at it.\n\nI'm optimistic because I do believe in the human spirit. And my parents always raised me with the idea that the better angels are going to win out."
