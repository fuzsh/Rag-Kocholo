        "text": "Category: Film/TV reviews\n\nToo Old To Die Young (2019)\n\nAfter his friend and fellow cop is murdered in an act of revenge, Detective Martin Jones is drawn into a dark world of cartel heirs, Yakuza mobsters and other unsavory characters while attempting to avoid a similar fate as his partner.\n\nOut on patrol one night, LA County Sheriff’s officer Martin Jones sees his partner, Larry, get murdered in front of him by an unknown assassin. Martin, no stranger to corruption and crime himself, recovers Larry’s cell phone from the scene — Larry was taking a selfie for his mistress at the time of the killing and the assassin is visible in the background. Martin’s associate Damian, a local gang leader, claims that the assassin was Jesús Rojas, the heir to a powerful cartel boss whose mother Martin had killed previously. In exchange for his silence on the matter, Damian pressures Martin into hunting down and killing another guilty man.\n\nMartin is by no means a good guy — he’s been dating his current girlfriend, Janey, since she was 16 and also has to avoid Janey’s creepy father, a wealthy businessman with a strange sniffing vocal tic (either Tourettes or years of drug abuse, we aren’t told). But after Larry’s death, Martin becomes fatalistic and seems to suffer an existential crisis, despite being promoted to the LASD homicide division.\n\nAfter the death of Larry, Jesús escapes to Mexico until things blow over. We meet the mysterious Yaritza, who serves as nurse to the head of the cartel, the terminally ill Don Ricardo. Following Don Ricardo’s death, his son Miguel, a violent, sadistic wild card, attempts to seize power before being forced to strike peace with Jesús.\n\nMeanwhile, more characters join the scene. Diana De Young is a social worker and victims’ advocate who also shows a fascination for healing and tarot cards. Together with Viggo Larsen—a former FBI agent who is also terminally ill and on dialysis—she identifies the worst of the worst who’ve escaped through the cracks of the justice system. After one of Viggo’s hits goes awry, Martin is put on the case, and after finding Viggo, doesn’t apprehend him. Instead, knowing his days might be numbered, Martin decides to join up with Viggo as a fellow vigilante after they find out they have plenty in common.\n\nSoon enough, they’re tracking down pedophiles and pornographers, which takes them from the run-down parts of LA to the mean streets of Albuquerque. Martin soon warms to Viggo’s philosophy; he insists that the world is decaying. Therefore, in a dying civilization, human beings will need to return to their animalistic instincts, both in order to survive themselves and to protect the innocent.\n\nBut after he’s asked by Damian to murder a Korean man who owes him $8,000, Martin refuses, thinking it’s not worth it. Martin asks Damian instead to give him only the worst of the worst to hunt down and kill.\n\nWith Damian and Viggo as his unlikely mentors, Martin attempts to adjust to his new life and shield it from Janey, but it’s not easy. Meanwhile Jesús, still hell-bent on revenge for his mother, has now fallen in love with Yaritza and married her. All of these storylines collide in an explosive conclusion.\n\nIn a world of cinema and TV featuring countless tentpole franchises, bloated superhero films and ham-fisted social commentaries, Nicolas Winding Refn stands out.\n\nThe Danish filmmaker has entertained, divided and perplexed audiences worldwide with his filmography, which runs the gamut of genre and content, but nonetheless has distinctive qualities. Part of this is due to Refn himself—he’s colorblind and all of his projects are deliberately constrasting in colors, resulting in gorgeous neons and dark shadows alternately lighting up the screen. Similarly, the electronic-tinged music in Too Old To Die Young is alternately doom-inducing and euphoric, depending on the scene, and is composed by Refn’s frequent collaborator, Cliff Martinez.\n\nIf you know any of Refn’s previous work, you’re likely familiar with his two films with Ryan Gosling, Drive and Only God Forgives, respectively. Refn also directed 2008’s Bronson, which featured an excellent performance by a then-unknown Tom Hardy and allegedly cost a mere $700,000 to make. In 2016, Refn made The Neon Demon, which I reviewed on my blog here.\n\nIt’s safe to say his style is both deliberate and unique, with dark themes intertwining with tragic redemption arcs and emotionally-engaging characters. Some critics and audiences have lauded Refn as an auteur director and one of the most innovative filmmakers today. Others decry him as a pretentious douchebag who favors style over substance.\n\nToo Old To Die Young can, to some extent, be seen as Refn trying to outdo himself. I can honestly say that this is one of the most ambitious and sprawling shows I’ve ever seen, spanning multiple locations and settings while being in both English and Spanish. Refn creates his own unique world and then draws you into it. In Kubrickian style, everyone takes their time with the dialogue and rarely interject or interrupt each other.\n\nWhen asked about why he suddenly shifted from independent film to TV & streaming series, Refn was matter-of-fact: “There will always be cinemas,” the filmmaker said. “But they will be a stop along the way, because the battleground for entertainment will be fought on the internet.”\n\nI first saw the series during the initial COVID lockdowns in 2020 and wasn’t quite sure what to think of it. But I’ve rewatched and re-examined a lot of Refn’s other work and appreciate it much more in hindsight. So therefore when Refn was back with another miniseries—Netflix’s Copenhagen Cowboy—back in January, I thought it would behoove me to rewatch Too Old To Die Young. And since then, I can’t stop thinking about it.\n\nRefn said in interviews that he approached it as a 13-hour movie being shot. Although 10 episodes long, Too Old To Die Young runs the gamut in runtime; the series finale is only 35 minutes, while most episodes are between 75-90 minutes. And if you can believe it, it was only written by three people: Refn himself, co-creator Ed Brubaker and screenwriter Halley Gross.\n\nRefn found an unlikely kindred spirit in Brubaker, who had mainly done graphic novels before.\n\n“I came up with this idea about doing a show in L.A. about death and religion, and I kind of mentally went back to my origin, to when I started making films,” Refn confessed in an interview.\n\n“I made something called the Pusher Trilogy: three Danish films, back in Copenhagen, about people in a criminal environment. And it was kind of a serialized, long format concept that were done as feature films. Then I came up with the title: Too Old to Die Young. I didn’t invent the title, but the title was like a riddle that fit really well with the show; it had an enigmatic sensibility. That was the foundation. I wanted it to take place in L.A., and obviously, it was going to have all of my fetishes and indulgences.”\n\n“I love working with other people. I find it enormously pleasurable. So I called Ed, who I had hired to work on a film that I was producing, and said, ‘Look, I have this idea. Do you want to join me on this…whatever this is going to be?’\n\n“We like each other’s work and I thought that his talent, especially for short narrative, was very interesting to bring in. Directing is essentially accumulating a love and a team, and then you work individually with the people who have specific talents. And so, I thought of Ed, who is a natural-born storyteller. But he’s used to a shorter format, which I find very interesting— graphic novels—so he’s taking his talent and fusing it into this larger landscape that I wanted to do.”\n\nAlthough some actors might be scared away by something so weird and abstract, Miles Teller, who played lead character Martin, loved it.\n\n“Nic said it would be seven months long, we’d be shooting in chronological order and that this is a 15-hour long movie that has an odyssey for my character. It’s so nice. I haven’t done anything chronological since theater. There’s something really special about doing that—you are in the moment with your character and you can shift things as you go along.”\n\nJena Malone, who worked with Refn on The Neon Demon, said that the Danish director gave her plenty of creative freedom when it came to fleshing out the enigmatic character of Diana:\n\n“It’s a very classic narrative genre of the underbelly of crime in Los Angeles, something that a lot of people make stories about,” Malone told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n“I think this one’s a little bit different because it’s not just Los Angeles, but the full palette of the California coast, including Mexico, and the activities that are happening. The underbelly, but also what’s coming from the top down. The enforcers, the rules, the politicians, but also people who are trying to navigate that and change things and make their own way.”\n\n“There’s just a trust level. I really respect Nic as an artist, and I feel free to give lots of options because I always know that he has the finest-tuned, whittling visional insight of what the story needs to be…Every element he invited me into the process, and so I was able to collaborate a character from the ground up with a beautiful team, but I’ve never had so much freedom and trust from a director.”\n\nCristina Rodlo, who plays Yaritza, was relatively unknown outside of Latin America and had frequently been told she didn’t look “Latina enough” for typical Mexican roles in U.S. productions. She found working with Refn to be rewarding and challenging as well.\n\n“The thing about Nic was that we would go to the table readings before each episode and he would say, ‘What do you think we should change?’ It would be hard for us, as you would never know what you are going to do next. His mind goes so fast! You would have to go in and shock him.\n\n“This role was something I have never played before, for sure. She’s a very smart woman but also a spiritual woman. She’s a very strange character who was hard to play; everything is internal, and she doesn’t talk much. It’s hard for the audience to understand what is really going on in her mind. Is she good? Is she evil? You don’t really know. She does a lot of things that make little sense which made it such a hard part for me to play. Ultimately, I kept asking, ‘What does she really want?’ The reasons for what she was doing were bigger than what I could understand. Then when it came to the end of filming, I understood her much better.”\n\nNow let’s get to the elephants in the room: the violence and the pacing.\n\nRefn has explicitly said in the past, “I have a fetish for violence.” (Eat your heart out, Mel Gibson.)\n\nCertainly Refn has found creative ways to dispatch hideously corrupt bad guys in his previous work. And make no mistake, there is some serious violence in this show which might turn people away—although it’s mostly revolting villains who the audience will be more than happy to see bite the dust.\n\nRefn approached similar avenging angel type characters in Only God Forgives, among others. The production design and costumes are immaculate in Too Old To Die Young, as well, and therein lies the point: everything is perfectly maintained and beautiful on the surface, from the hair and makeup to the props onscreen. But, much like in real life, evil and violence lurk underneath the surface, both in terms of the characters and the environments in which evil deeds are done.\n\nThe pacing of the series will definitely divide viewers. The first two episodes are best viewed as a prequel, setting the tone before things really start to get going in episodes three and four. With that said, persevering with this show definitely reaps rewards.\n\nOver the course of the series, three characters—Viggo, Diana and Jesús—all have monologues about how the world’s end could be imminent and that society is going to unravel in the very near future. Diana paints this in sociopolitical terms, fearing the rise of fascism, selfishness and violence. Viggo is concerned about environmental degradation and the moral erosion that will inevitably come when society collapses, arguing that a kill or be killed approach will become important out of necessity. And Jesús approaches it in Biblical terms, arguing that Armageddon will soon come and commanding his brutal underlings to “turn the city into a theme park of pain.”\n\nAgain, some of these themes intertwine with the themes in Refn’s previous work. I’m sure anyone familiar with Ryan Gosling’s stoic, largely silent performance in Drive will find similar echoes in Teller’s portrayal of Martin. Martin rarely speaks, using his body language and an appropriate use of spitting to create an unemotional, cold approach to his work, either as a cop or as a vigilante. But much like the Driver in Drive and Julian in Only God Forgives, Martin is emotionally tortured, knows he has enemies, and simply wants to exorcise his demons. So therefore Martin hunts down pedophiles and pornographers in order to purge his guilt from dating his girlfriend when she was 16 and 17. He wants to pay back his moral debts after being guilty of bribery and extortion in his past as a corrupt cop, but ultimately, he still might suffer the same fate as everyone who he dispatches.\n\nRefn described the character of Viggo as “a very frightening character, but he’s on some kind of spiritual quest of cleansing the Earth of evil.”\n\nSimilarly, it’s implied that the character of Jesús is heavily affected by his mother, who was both a dominant figure in the cartel and possibly an instigator of both physical and sexual abuse—much like Julian in Only God Forgives, who is heavily implied to have been a victim of incest in the past.\n\nAnd also, Only God Forgives presented the character of Chang as being an ominous supernatural force, much like the mysterious Yaritza. In episode 2 of Too Old To Die Young, Don Ricardo, before his death, claims that Yaritza was simply a runaway found out in the desert. As breathtakingly gorgeous as Rodlo is, between her creepy stares and her possible connection to the mystical High Priestess of Death, it’s hard not to get an unsettling effect from her when she’s onscreen.\n\nIt’s not unrealistic, therefore, that Refn, a secular Jewish man, would view these characters as being influenced by Old Testament levels of justice—which, all too often, is the only form of justice in Too Old To Die Young. So while the show may appear overly dark and nihilistic and give the impression that Refn has bitten off far more than he can chew, there’s still a consistent philosophy in the show, even if it frequently dabbles in morally grey areas.\n\nWith that said, this dark, neo-noir thriller isn’t entirely dour and despairing. There’s actually a surprising amount of levity and satire, largely due to Martin’s cop buddies, who are alternately toxic and hilariously over-the-top in their attitudes and perspectives.\n\nToo Old To Die Young premiered on Amazon Prime on June 14, 2019 and received polarizing reviews in line with Refn’s previous work. Later on, while promoting his new Netflix show Copenhagen Cowboy in January 2023, Refn revealed that Amazon despised Too Old To Die Young, refused to promote it and slashed his marketing budget in retaliation.\n\n“It is so addictive for people who are willing to wait and get involved,” Rodlo said in an interview with Glamour UK magazine. “It’s very hard and disturbing. But if you are willing to fall for it, you will go crazy for it.”\n\nTo this day, you won’t find this show at all unless you search for it on Amazon, which is a damn shame. Yes, it’s hard to watch at times. Yes, it’s weird and deliberately paced. But Too Old To Die Young is the very definition of a hidden gem.\n\nGRADE: A\n\nDirected by Nicolas Winding Refn\n\nCreated by Nicolas Winding Refn & Ed Brubaker\n\nWritten by Nicolas Winding Refn, Ed Brubaker & Halley Wegryn Gross\n\nProduced by Lene Børglum, Rachel Dik and Alex Gayner\n\nExecutive Producers — Nicolas Winding Refn, Ed Brubaker, Joe Lewis and Jeffrey Stott\n\nDirectors of Photography — Darius Khondji & Diego Garcia\n\nMusic by Cliff Martinez\n\nEditors — Annie Eifrig & Matthew Newman\n\nProduction Designer — Tom Foden\n\nCostume Designer — Jennifer Johnson\n\nStarring Miles Teller, Augusto Aguilera, Cristina Rodlo, Jena Malone, John Hawkes, Nell Tiger Free, Billy Baldwin, Babs Olusanmokun, Hart Bochner, Gino Vento, Celestino Cornielle, Joanna Cassidy, Manuel Uriza, Chris Coppola, Callie Hernandez, Carlotta Montanari, Emiliano Diez, Roberto Aguire, Roger Lim, James Urbaniak, Brad Hunt, Lance Gross\n\nEPISODES/RUNTIMES\n\nThe Devil (written by Refn & Brubaker) – 1 hour, 33 minutes\n\nThe Lovers (written by Refn & Brubaker) – 1 hour, 36 minutes\n\nThe Hermit (written by Refn & Brubaker) – 1 hour, 16 minutes\n\nThe Tower (written by Refn & Brubaker) – 1 hour, 3 minutes\n\nThe Fool (written by Refn & Brubaker) – 1 hour, 15 minutes\n\nThe High Priestess (written by Refn & Brubaker) – 1 hour, 31 minutes\n\nThe Magician (written by Refn & Brubaker) – 1 hour, 10 minutes\n\nThe Hanged Man (written by Refn & Brubaker) – 1 hour, 28 minutes\n\nThe Empress (written by Refn, Brubaker & Gross) – 1 hour, 9 minutes\n\nThe World (written by Refn, Brubaker & Gross) – 30 minutes\n\nTRIVIA\n\nFilmed from November 2017 to August 2018 in both Los Angeles and Albuquerque. Like all of Refn’s work, everything was shot in chronological order.\n\nMiles Teller was recommended to Nicolas Winding Refn by actress Elle Fanning, who was Refn’s leading lady in The Neon Demon. “I’d never worked with Miles before,” Refn admitted. “But Elle Fanning spoke very highly of him, and I was looking for a younger lead, and Miles was just turning 30 at that time. We met. He was really the first real actor that I sat down with to discuss it who was at that level and all throughout our discussion I kept thinking, ‘Oh my god, he looks like Elvis.’ So, my mind was like, ‘If I can make a story about America starring Elvis Presley…I mean, how much more red, white and blue can you get?'”\n\nRefn rejected a typical release; Instead of premiering the pilot episode, he chose to premiere episodes 4 & 5 back-to-back at the Cannes Film Festival as a feature film in May 2019, a month before the series premiered on Amazon Prime. It was submitted to Cannes under the working title North of Hollywood, West of Hell.\n\nThe first TV and/or streaming project created by Refn. “The difference between streaming and traditional theatrical is that streaming is an energy flow around us that runs 24 hours a day,” Refn said in response to a question as to why he moved to TV. “Streaming is like an ocean of possibilities. The idea that I could make something that had no control was so interesting.”\n\nRefn and cinematographer Darius Khondji originally considered shooting the project entirely on an iPhone, but gave up due to issues with resolution and aspect ratio. It was eventually shot in 4K resolution.\n\nNo character appears in every episode.\n\nRefn’s second collaboration with Jena Malone (after The Neon Demon) and his fourth with composer Cliff Martinez (Drive, Only God Forgives and The Neon Demon).\n\nAccording to internet fan theories, the subplot involving tarot cards might actually reveal a way to watch the series in non-linear format (i.e. out of order). Every episode is named after a trump card in a deck of tarot. Arguably, the meaning of each card loosely relates to the narrative of that volume, not just the specific character. It’s possible that watching the series in the order of the Tarot card numbers (5, 7, 6, 9, 2, 3, 8, 1, 4, 10) will engage those who may be turned off the slow pacing of the series. (Side note: I don’t endorse tarot cards and personally believe they’re based on pseudoscience, but this is nonetheless a fascinating theory.)\n\nHunt for the Wilderpeople (2016)\n\nThrough a series of massive misunderstandings, a gruff, blue-collar New Zealander and his foster son become the unlikely targets of a manhunt.\n\nTroubled pre-teen Ricky Baker has had a pretty tough time. Abandoned by his mother, the young Māori kid has since gotten into trouble several times and is facing an uncertain future in the New Zealand child welfare system.\n\nHis foster parents, or as he calls them “Aunt and Uncle”, pluck him from the mean streets of the city and take him in to their remote farm in the rural North Island. Despite Ricky’s cynical, withdrawn behavior, Aunt Bella has real compassion for his situation, but her husband, the tough, blue-collar Hector (aka Uncle Hec), isn’t so keen on the new addition to the family. Bella soon bonds with Ricky by offering to take him hunting and buying him a dog, who the hip-hop-loving Ricky names Tupac.\n\nHowever, when Bella dies suddenly, Ricky is informed by child services that they’ll be taking him back, so he runs away with Tupac — but not before clumsily faking his own suicide by burning down a barn. This draws the attention of the cops, who believe that it’s a case of arson, and Uncle Hec, who’s run off to find Ricky and Tupac, is assumed to have abducted Ricky.\n\nHec quickly finds Ricky and Tupac with his own dog, Zag, but they quickly run into trouble when a trio of bumbling hikers incorrectly assume that Hec is molesting Ricky. Hec and Ricky escape with the authorities still hot on their trail, not knowing that, apart from an ankle injury to Hec, the duo is alive and well. However, it’s not until they reconcile with their pasts that they truly form a bond. And with the help of some unlikely allies, they just might (literally) get out of the woods and make a new home.\n\nThis charming adventure-comedy has lots of things going for it. For one, it’s directed by Taika Waititi. His films are typically sublime in terms of blending drama and humor. In the case of Boy and Jojo Rabbit, Waititi used inexperienced child actors and gave them a script full of heart and humor while still making subtle statements about poverty, innocence, racism, family and the human condition. Waititi is typically profound when he’s not trying to be profound, and his films are genuinely funny to boot. This film also marked one of the first times Waititi got mainstream attention (of course, the 46-year-old has now directed two MCU movies), and the first time Waititi had directed an adaptation.\n\nWhile this film does bear Waititi’s unique style of filmmaking, it’s mostly based on a book called Wild Pork and Watercress by the late Kiwi author Barry Crump (1935-1996), whose novels were frequently set in the New Zealand bush. It’s a classic adventure tale that tackles serious subjects — like the high poverty rates that have long been an issue in the rural parts of the country — but it does so with an entertaining story with lots of twists and turns.\n\nThe heart of the story was what attracted Waititi to the script.\n\n“My focus is usually on the story — not so much on, like, style or cool shots, even though I do a lot of cool shots in my films,” Waititi said in an interview when the film was released. “I feel like my strength is in tone and in story, and, like, the emotional tonality in my films.”\n\nWaititi was first made aware of Wild Pork and Watercress shortly after he got an Oscar nomination for Best Narrative Short Film for his 2005 film Two Cars, One Night.\n\n“That’s when I read the book for the first time. It’s pretty famous in New Zealand; a lot of people read it when they’re young, but I hadn’t heard of it,” Waititi admitted.\n\n“But I thought it was very cool, so I wrote a draft of it, and after a couple of drafts, I decided I wanted to go and make my own films, so I made three features — then I came back to this material a few years later.”\n\nWaititi cast Julian Dennison, a Māori kid from Wellington, in the role of Ricky after being impressed with the young actor’s work on a commercial that he directed.\n\n“He’s really talented, and I decided that one day, I was going to work with him on something,” Waititi said. “And then when this project came about, he was my first choice.”\n\nWaititi was also super excited to work with legendary actor Sam Neill, who plays Uncle Hec in the film. Best known to international audiences for his role as Dr. Grant in the Jurassic Park franchise, Neill was born in Northern Ireland and raised in Christchurch, New Zealand, where he has been one of the country’s most recognizable actors for the past three decades.\n\nDespite his worldwide box office success, Neill frequently pops up in Australian and New Zealand cinema and TV shows, and he immediately said yes to Waititi’s script.\n\n“Growing up, I’d seen him in so many things, and I’ve always loved his work. We actually both have been trying to work together for a little while, we just hadn’t had the opportunity. So when this came about, I sent the script to him and straightaway, he was like, ‘Yep, I’m in.’ This was the easiest casting I’ve ever had to deal with on a film!”\n\nWaititi reunited with several other collaborators on the project, including Rhys Darby (What We Do in the Shadows, Flight of the Conchords) and Rachel House, one of New Zealand’s most decorated acting coaches and character actors.\n\nFilming lasted five weeks and the film had only a $4.5 million NZD budget ($2.5 million USD), typical of Waititi’s New Zealand-based indie fare. Hunt for the Wilderpeople was mostly shot in the Waitakere Ranges west of Auckland, as well as the Central Plateau of the North Island.\n\nUpon its release, Hunt for the Wilderpeople broke box office records in New Zealand (grossing $12 million) and went on to gross over $23 million USD worldwide. It also grossed over $10 million in Australia and received significant acclaim from both audiences and critics at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThe success of Hunt for the Wilderpeople led to Waititi getting courted by the big-time Hollywood players for later films like Thor: Ragnarok and Jojo Rabbit. In hindsight, Wilderpeople could be seen as the film that catapulted the goofy director into the mainstream.\n\nBut truth be told, Waititi doesn’t see much difference between his projects.\n\n“I’ve got a work ethic, and I know what I want. I think that even though Thor is a bigger film — like, the scale is bigger — the intention is the same, and that’s just to tell a good story.”\n\nGrade: B+\n\nDirected by Taika Waititi\n\nProduced by Taika Waititi, Carthew Neal, Matt Noonan and Leanne Saunders\n\nWritten by Taika Waititi\n\nBased on the book Wild Park and Watercress by Barry Crump\n\nStarring Julian Dennison, Sam Neill, Rime Te Wiata, Rachel House, Oscar Kightley, Rhys Darby, Tioreore Ngatai-Melbourne, Mike Minogue\n\nDirector of Photography — Lachlan Milne\n\nMusic by Lukasz Buda, Samuel Scott & Conrod Wedde\n\nEditors — Tom Eagles, Yana Gorskaya & Luke Haigh\n\nRated PG-13 for thematic elements including violent content, and for some language.\n\nTRIVIA\n\nWaititi’s second collaboration with Julian Dennison and his third with Rachel House. Mike Minogue, who played a police officer in What We Do in the Shadows, also appeared in Wilderpeople as a hunter.\n\nThe second time that Waititi has broken a New Zealand box office record. In 2010, Boy grossed $6.2 million USD, making it the highest-grossing Kiwi film ever at the time. Hunt for the Wilderpeople went on to gross over $12 million. When Waititi found out that he had dethroned himself as the country’s box office king, he quipped “It’s the happiest and saddest moment of my life.” (For the record, Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings trilogy was considered an international co-production of the US and NZ and therefore didn’t count in the box office figures).\n\nWaititi makes a cameo in the film as a minister.\n\nCo-editors Tom Eagles and Yana Gorskaya also worked on What We Do in the Shadows.\n\nAll of the newscasters and reporters in the film play are real-life New Zealand media figures playing themselves.\n\nWaititi’s fourth film to premiere at Sundance, following Eagle vs Shark, Boy, and What We Do in the Shadows.\n\nAlthough Sam Neill’s character is revealed to be illiterate, Neill himself ironically has a degree in English lit from Victoria University of Wellington.\n\nThe Toyota Hilux truck (or “ute” in New Zealand slang) is nicknamed Crumpy for the author of the source book, Barry Crump. An identical Toyota truck was driven by Crump during several long-running commercials in New Zealand.\n\nWaititi later helped Dennison land a role in Deadpool 2 thanks to his friendship with that film’s star, Ryan Reynolds.\n\nHustle (2022)\n\nA jaded NBA scout rediscovers his passion after stumbling upon an unknown potential superstar.\n\nStanley Sugarman has been a scout for the Philadelphia 76ers for a long time — maybe too long. His life is a constant string of flights, scouting reports and jetlag as he travels around the world looking for the NBA’s next international sensation. He regrets not being able to spend more time with his ever-patient wife Teresa and teenage daughter Alex, who has an interest in sports videography.\n\nWhen Sixers owner Rex Merrick, Stanley’s mentor, notices that he’s burning out, he offers to make him an assistant coach instead so he can spend more time with family. But when Merrick passes away suddenly, he leaves the franchise in the hands of his scheming son Vince, who’s never liked Stanley and promptly sends him back on the road.\n\nSugarman vents to his old teammate, Leon, who encourages his old pal to leave the franchise altogether and use his charisma as a sales agent. Several months later, we find Stanley on the road again in Spain. After a meeting with a potential prospect falls through, he wanders over to a streetball game nearby, where he discovers an athletic beast named Bo Cruz. While raw, Cruz plays with a physical swagger and has great footwork for a big man, showing finesse with the basketball in his hands. Stanley, mesmerized, attempts to speak with Bo after the game, despite the language barrier. He earns Bo’s trust after proving his NBA credentials.\n\nStanley talks to Bo’s mother, who reveals that at age 15, he was set to go to America and had a clear path to the NCAA and then the pros. But when Bo became a dad shortly thereafter, he had to put his dreams on hold. Now, he works construction during the day and hustles as a streetballer by night.\n\nDespite resistance from Vince and the rest of the Sixers’ front office, Stanley arranges to bring Bo to the States and give him a real chance at qualifying for the NBA Draft Combine. Stanley finally feels invigorated again, but Bo finds the increase in competition a real challenge. But in due time, with Stanley as his loyal mentor, Bo might actually have a chance to defeat the odds and prove he belongs in the NBA.\n\nThis film is a unique twist on a familiar inspirational sports theme, and it also features yet another excellent performance from Adam Sandler.\n\nI’ve made no secret of how, when given a really great script and when working with a skilled director, Sandler can actually give an extremely effective performance, and with Hustle, the 55-year-old comedy veteran is proving that his career-best turn in 2019’s Uncut Gems was no fluke.\n\nSandler can act, and the key to his success here is his chemistry with real-life NBA player Juancho Hernángomez, who plays Bo Cruz. He really inhabits Bo’s blue-collar, rough-and-tumble mentality, in addition to having the obvious athletic chops.\n\nSandler, a longtime basketball fanatic, used his connections in the NBA — and his friendship with co-producer LeBron James — to bring aboard real-life talent, like the Minnesota Timberwolves’ Anthony Edwards, who plays Bo’s rival in the draft combine, Kermit Wilts. Trae Young, Kyle Lowry, Seth Curry, Luka Doncic, Doc Rivers and Brad Stevens make cameos as themselves, among others.\n\nFrom a filmmaking perspective, director Jeremiah Zagar and cinematographer Zak Mulligan developed some innovative techniques for shooting the various basketball scenes.\n\n“When you watch a basketball movie, usually, a lot of them are with actors and so the way they shoot with the ball is from the outside in,” Zagar said. “You line four or five cameras around the court. You set up for a closeup and a wide. You shoot it like you shoot the NBA, which has a lot of cool different angles.”\n\nThese sequences were first shot using what Zagar called “Stanley Vision” — seeing the game’s action from the coach’s perspective and shooting on a long-zoom lens. The next day, they would shoot scenes from Bo’s perspective with a wide lens in close-up.\n\n“Then the editors would cut those two elements together and we’d have a game,” Zagar said. “We’d look at it to see what the missing pieces were within the language of the game that we could execute. I knew it was going to be bad. The Stanley vision would look like sh-t because it was only one element and they hadn’t gotten used to it. What was good about doing it this way was that we’d do the whole game so the choreographers would get used to what the whole game was like.”\n\nCo-star Queen Latifah, who plays the wife of Sandler’s character, was impressed.\n\n“I think they are used to being on camera. I think it’s just kind of transferring the mindset from handling the basketball to being on camera and pretending to do what they normally do.”\n\nZagar was taken aback when Sandler approached him to direct. After all, Zagar’s previous two features couldn’t have been more different from Hustle. Zagar’s 2018 feature film debut, We the Animals, was an experimental, coming-of-age LGBTQ film, a la Moonlight.\n\nZagar originally said no, as he had a couple other scripts he was working on at the time, but Sandler anticipated that. Zagar, if anything, was impressed that Sandler approached him at all.\n\n“He’s a very understated guy when you first meet him,” Zagar said of his initial call with Sandler. “He said that I probably wouldn’t want to do this script, but that I should take a look. So I read it and I was like, ‘He’s right, it’s not for me.’”\n\nAfter rejecting a few other scripts in the meantime, Zagar found out that he had an unanticipated ally: Sandler’s friend, Netflix co-CEO and chief of content Ted Sarandos. Thanks to Sandler’s exclusive content deal with the streaming platform, Sarandos knew he was looking for an up-and-coming director. Sandler watched We the Animals and thought Zagar had some potential. And as fate would have it, both Sandler and Zagar had the same agent, Simon Faber from William Morris Endeavor (WME).\n\n“It’s still shocking to me that Sandler saw We the Animals,” Zagar confessed in an interview with IndieWire. He soon began reconsidering Sandler’s offer.\n\n“He wanted me to do my thing — and the truth is that I can only do my thing,” Zagar continued. “I was very honest with him about that. There was this opportunity to shoot basketball in a way that I thought could be really cinematic. The script kept brewing in me. There were things about it that were very much me.”\n\nAnd now onto what could be called the Sandler renaissance.\n\nDon’t laugh. Or better yet, do laugh. I’m sure he won’t mind.\n\nWhen asked why he chose the script for Hustle, Sandler admitted that “it had a lot of deep scenes that connected with me.”\n\n“I’m playing a guy who’s just been working hard his whole life and not getting exactly what his goal was, being overlooked and people at work are getting in his way,” Sandler told Entertainment Weekly. “A lot of people have dealt with this in their life. I knew this movie was a different feel for me, but it’s kind of a combination of stuff I’ve done in the past, and a newer version of who I am.”\n\n“But I loved just talking to the NBA guys. I got to meet a lot of coaches, and talk a lot of hoops. I know hoops, but I don’t know it like these guys. They know every historic moment and everything that’s going on. And now when I watch the games, I have literally like 15 teams I can pull for, because we all became friends!”\n\n“There’s a particular phenomenon that tends to accompany Adam Sandler movies these days — more specifically, a certain reaction that can come from his haters in addition to well-meaning audiences alike,” says journalist Andy Meek for BGR.com. “It manifests itself in the form of feeling genuine surprise that a particular Sandler film — the newest being Netflix’s basketball movie Hustle — isn’t terrible. On the contrary, Hustle is, in fact, quite good.”\n\nTo be fair, there’s certain categories of Adam Sandler movies. Some are inexcusably cringy and awful, relying on dumb slapstick and lazy stereotypes to be funny. But do I personally love kicking up my feet and watching 50 First Dates, Anger Management and The Longest Yard as a guilty pleasure movie? You bet I do. Put it this way: many of Sandler’s movies don’t have much of a brain, but they do have a heart.\n\nIn addition to his riveting performance in Uncut Gems, Sandler received brilliant reviews in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love, in which he plays a timid, socially awkward entrepreneur who falls in love with his sister’s co-worker. In 2007’s Reign Over Me, Sandler also got significant acclaim for his turn as a widower dentist who lost his wife and daughter on 9/11 and is given unexpected encouragement by his long-lost college buddy, played by Don Cheadle.\n\nIt’s safe to say that when Sandler is really trying, he can give a really powerful and convincing performance. And I’ve personally known people in the film industry who’ve worked on Sandler’s films, and they say that he is a high-quality guy who takes care of his people and makes sure his sets are family-friendly and welcoming. He’s certainly a hard guy to dislike, even if his style of humor certainly isn’t everyone’s cup of tea.\n\n“Sandler has consistently proven how well he can tackle dramatic roles. And, while most argue this is proof he should ditch the lowbrow comedy and refocus his efforts, I think this success is often because of – not in spite of – his sillier comedic work,” wrote Meg Watson, a film reviewer for the Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n“Sandler built his brand as the loveable misfit with slapstick hits like Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, and his dramatic characters are often a muted and more complex version of that archetype he knows so well. They’re kind-hearted schmos, often family men, who’ve been wrung dry by illness or tragedy (sometimes of their own making).\n\nIn a more ‘serious’ actor’s hands, those performances could easily be overwrought. But with Sandler, always still armed with an offhand joke or outlandish outburst, it’s unpretentious – and in recent years it’s only gotten better.”\n\n“Good acting isn’t about being the most actorly. Really, it’s the exact opposite,” Watson said. “It’s about capturing something honest and lively and relatable – and Sandler does that better than most.”\n\nGrade: A-\n\nDirected by Jeremiah Zagar\n\nProduced by Adam Sandler, Allen Covert, Zack Roth, Joe Roth, Jeff Kirschenbaum, LeBron James, Joseph Vecsey, Maverick Carter\n\nWritten by Taylor Materne and WIll Fetters\n\nStarring Adam Sandler, Juancho Hernángomez, Queen Latifah, Robert Duvall, Anthony Edwards, Ben Foster, Kenny Smith, Jordan Hull, María Botto, Ainhoa Pillet\n\nFeaturing cameos from Luka Doncic, Doc Rivers, Shaquille O’Neal, Charles Barkley, Tobias Harris, Trae Young, Jordan Clarkson, Aaron Gordon, Kyle Lowry, Seth Curry, Tyrese Maxey, Khris Middleton, Matisse Thybulle, Aaron McKie, Allen Iverson, Dan Patrick, Mark Cuban, Dirk Nowitzki, Brad Stevens, José Calderón, Leandro Barbosa, Maurice Cheeks, Sergio Scariolo and Álex Abrines\n\nMusic by Dan Deacon\n\nDirector of Photography — Zak Mulligan\n\nEditors — Tom Costain, Keiko Deguchi and Brian Robinson\n\nRated R for language.\n\nTRIVIA\n\nSandler’s character, Stanley, might be inspired by Holger Geschwinder, the German basketball coach whose unorthodox, mad-scientist methods helped make Dirk Nowitzki a 14-time All-Star and an NBA Hall of Famer. Nowitzki makes a cameo in the film on a FaceTime video call that Stanley makes in order to prove his NBA credentials to Bo and his family when he meets them.\n\nZagar and Mulligan experimented with using a TARO, which mounted cameras to remote-controlled cars that could weave around the players as they moved across the court. They also attached a camera rig to the players so they could play the game with the camera as their direct opponent! “It was so weird for them at first,” Zagar said. “But once we had buy-in and they understood what we were doing, they were really amenable to it.”\n\nThe editors would send new cuts of each basketball drill or game to Zagar every day for his approval as well as Sandler’s.\n\nIn the film, Stanley wears a “Federal Donuts” t-shirt, referencing a real chain in Philadelphia that also has a prominent location at the Wells Fargo Center, where the Sixers play.\n\nAlthough they play on-screen rivals in the film, Juancho Hernángomez and Anthony Edwards were teammates on the Timberwolves in the 2020-21 NBA season.\n\nThe hill used in Bo’s training montages is an homage to the Manayunk Wall, an infamous and grueling uphill climb for the Philadelphia International championship bike race.\n\nBo first appears in the film at exactly the 22-minute mark, and he later wears the #22 jersey in the film.\n\nKing vs. Kubrick – How Two Respective Legends Clashed Over “The Shining”\n\nWARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD\n\nAlthough it received polarizing reviews upon its original release in 1980, The Shining is now widely considered to be one of the first epic horror films, alongside other classics like The Omen, The Exorcist, The Hills Have Eyes and Carrie. Stanley Kubrick’s film has been referenced, parodied and re-appraised on pretty much every level, and it’s hard to find someone who hasn’t seen it.\n\nAt the same time, Stephen King’s original novel, published in 1977, was also one of his most acclaimed works. Well before he was a household name, King was dealing with significant turmoil in his life and was afraid for both himself and his family, incorporating some of his deepest fears into the novel. Only the third book he ever wrote, King’s macabre masterpiece catapulted him into the mainstream and helped establish his legacy as America’s most important horror writer.\n\nBut when Kubrick’s film came out, King hated it. Or maybe he didn’t. Or maybe he just hated Kubrick, who was known for rubbing some people the wrong way. Either way, when discussing The Shining today, it’s very easy to get caught up in the debate over the novel vs. the film. Now, of course, this is nothing new. There are still Tolkien purists who despise Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings film adaptations, and some of Tolkien’s surviving relatives took issue with them. But this conflict was magnified simply by the sheer fact that King and Kubrick were both men with strong personalities and were never destined to really be long-term collaborators — or even lifelong friends.\n\nSo without further ado, let’s dive into why The Shining is so different from page to screen — and why King and Kubrick clashed over it.\n\nPart 1: Background & Inspiration\n\nAfter the successes of his first two books, Carrie and Salem’s Lot, King temporarily relocated to Boulder, Colorado from his home state of Maine, with his wife and kids in tow. King’s mother had recently passed away, and he had also been hoping to gain inspiration by living in a different part of America.\n\nThe roots of what became The Shining were born when King and his family were staying in the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, right outside Boulder. Arriving right before Halloween, the Kings were the only guests in the entire hotel, which was about to shut down for the winter. While the idea of a creepy haunted hotel wasn’t exactly a new horror trope, King couldn’t keep shaking the eerie feeling that he got from the Stanley Hotel. Long interested in psychic powers, premonitions and ghosts as horror themes, King began to wonder about how locations could be legitimately evil if they had similarly evil pasts. Allegedly, when he arrived at the Stanley, he noticed a small group of nuns leaving, and began to wonder how it would look as a hotel with a spiritually dark past, as if God was leaving the building alongside the nuns.\n\nAt the time, King was also suffering from alcoholism. Both the pressures of being a newly successful writer and relocating across the country with a young family had taken a toll on King, and he began to have nightmares about hurting his kids. The book’s title was inspired by a John Lennon song which contained the lyrics, “We all shine on, like the sun and the moon and the stars.” While King’s publisher and editor advised him against writing another horror novel after two other successful ones, King said he’d be flattered to be typecast as a horror writer.\n\nStanley Kubrick came at The Shining from a very different angle. Kubrick, in his late 40s at the time, had already become well-known as one of the world’s most daring and ambitious filmmakers. A perfectionist who never made the same film twice, Kubrick was fortunate to have a rare combination of full artistic freedom and flexibility thanks to his deal with Warner Bros. A native New Yorker who had relocated to the UK in the 60s to make films like Lolita and Dr. Strangelove, Kubrick almost always adapted existing books and novels into films, as he had done with legendary films like A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Paths of Glory.\n\nWith that said, by the late 70s, some thought that Kubrick’s career was in decline. His most recent project, 1975’s Barry Lyndon, flopped at the US box office despite critical acclaim and several Oscar nods. When Kubrick read King’s novel, he was immediately taken by it and thought it would be the ideal project to be both a critical and commercial success. When asked why he liked the material, Kubrick responded, “There’s something inherently wrong with the human personality. There’s an evil side to it. One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious. We can see the dark side without having to confront it directly.”\n\nPart 2: Book Versus Film\n\nWhile book and film differ significantly, the basic plots are the same. The Torrances — husband Jack, wife Wendy and son Danny — relocate from Vermont to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado after Jack takes a job as the winter season caretaker at the historic Overlook Hotel. Jack’s turbulent past at the hands of an abusive alcoholic father has continued to affect him to the present, but he genuinely loves his family and wants to prove himself, both as an aspiring writer and as the caretaker. The hotel manager, Stuart Ullman, tells Jack about the Overlook’s dark past, from its construction on a Native American burial ground to the relatively recent murder-suicide of Delbert Grady, a former caretaker who went mad, murdering his wife and daughters with an axe before shooting himself. It’s clear that the Overlook has a mind of its own, and its insidious influence begins to take hold of Jack as the long winter sets in.\n\nMeanwhile, young Danny is identified by the Overlook chef, Dick Hallorann, as possessing the titular “shining” — a telepathic ability that Hallorann shares. Danny, who’s developed a bond with Hallorann over a short time frame, asks if the Overlook itself is evil. Hallorann says no, but clarifies that the horrific events of the past have given the Overlook a shine of its own. He also strictly warns Danny never to enter a specific room, #237.\n\nJack continues to descend into cabin fever mode; he falls off the wagon, starts fighting with Wendy, and devolves into his most toxic and violent self. He begins to have premonitions about his relationship with the hotel while also developing a unique bond with it. Is it supernatural? Or simply the effects of alcohol and isolation? Either way, the sinister forces that are beginning to take ahold of Jack will soon rip his family apart and leave no one unscathed, leading to a terrifying climax.\n\nPart 3: An Intense Production\n\nKubrick and King clashed almost immediately over the direction of the script, which was written by Kubrick and co-writer Diane Johnson. Kubrick had long desired to work with Jack Nicholson, who had won an Academy Award for his performance in 1975’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and was well on his way to becoming a living legend. However, Nicholson’s leering performance as a mental patient in that film had caused him to become somewhat typecast in “crazy” roles. Therefore, King believed that casting Nicholson would immediately make him a walking spoiler. King, for his part, wanted a more everyman type of actor who could convincingly play a family man who tragically succumbs to his demons, fulfilling his own vision of The Shining as a domestic tragedy and a social commentary on alcoholism wrapped inside of a horror shell. King recommended Robert De Niro, Jon Voight or Martin Sheen, but was vetoed every time.\n\nSimilarly, for the role of Wendy, Kubrick cast Shelley Duvall early on, but disagreed with King on how to handle the character. The film’s version of Wendy is much more passive and timid than the book’s version, and Kubrick notoriously put Duvall through hell in filming due to his demanding and perfectionist nature. King felt that Wendy wasn’t the strong female character he had in mind, and that Kubrick intended to simply highlight Jack’s toxic behavior, as opposed to the overwhelming situation that Wendy finds herself in at the mercy of her husband.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t all bad vibes. While King said that Kubrick was far too pragmatic, humanistic and rationalistic to fully embrace the supernatural elements of the script, the two men had several productive phone calls about the subject (Kubrick, as an American expat in England, was famous for his marathon trans-Atlantic calls with colleagues). Kubrick opined that, as a ghost story, The Shining is automatically an optimistic story because “anything that suggests there’s an afterlife is inherently an optimistic story.”\n\nKing, a former Methodist who now identifies as a Deist, agreed. “The concept of a ghost presupposes life after death. That’s a cheerful concept, isn’t it?”\n\nThe production of The Shining was beset with problems on every level imaginable. A fire destroyed part of the set at London’s Elstree Studios. Due to primitive visual effects, Kubrick had to nix part of the novel’s climax, which includes animal-shaped hedge mazes coming to life and terrorizing Danny and Wendy. Kubrick enlisted the help of American camera operator Garrett Brown, who had recently invented the Steadicam, to help shoot the long, fluid tracking shots of Danny Torrance riding his tricycle around the hotel’s massive corridors — although, contrary to popular belief, The Shining was not the first film to use the Steadicam.\n\nKubrick demanded dozens and dozens of takes, as he did on most of his films. Nicholson didn’t mind it, as he liked to be able to dive into the minutiae of the decisions that his character would make. However, Duvall was used to working with directors who shot films at a much faster pace, and given the high stress of the role she was playing, she really struggled with the lengthy takes.\n\nLater in his career, Kubrick defended his meticulous methods and denied that he shot infinitely high numbers of takes. The director claimed that he shot so many scenes simply because lots of actors weren’t prepared and didn’t know their lines. “If I shot 20 takes for every single scene, I’d never finish a film,” he quipped.\n\nBarry Nelson, who played the hotel manager Stuart Ullman, once had to say his opening line, “Hello, Jack,” 32 times before Kubrick was satisfied. “I had never done that many takes, and I don’t think anybody else had,” he later said. “But Kubrick was a genius with the camera, so it wasn’t all about whether the actor was pleasing him or not.”\n\nIn retrospect, Duvall said that, despite the enormous stress, she instinctively knew that there was a method to Kubrick’s madness and that she could never have achieved such a performance on her own — while also stressing that she wouldn’t be lining up around the block to work with Kubrick again! In the fascinating behind-the-scenes documentary The Making of The Shining, Kubrick is seen losing his temper with Duvall frequently while also trying to wrangle a small crew working over a massive space. Kubrick also chose the rare step of filming in chronological order, which proved challenging, as all of the sets needed to be constructed at once, interfering with other productions that were also using Elstree Studios.\n\nWhile he may have been short with Duvall, Kubrick took an almost-fatherly approach with Danny Lloyd, who played Danny Torrance. Lloyd, who retired from acting as a young man, later recalled that Kubrick was very sensitive towards the more mature themes of the film and presented them in a way that would be age-appropriate. Years later, Lloyd would admit that, as a kid, he had thought The Shining was a drama, not a horror film, thanks to Kubrick’s decency and protective nature.\n\n“Stanley had a really good way of speaking to me,” said Lloyd. “When they did tell me why I was screaming or why I was scared, they were delicate about it. He put it on a level that a kid could understand, and he didn’t bark orders.”\n\nPart 4: Other Key Plot Differences\n\nAs I alluded to previously, where King felt Kubrick went wrong was deliberately blurring the supernatural issue. The film is more ambiguous in terms of answering the what and why of Jack’s torment and descent into insanity. When you watch The Shining, you’re not automatically sure what’s causing said evil.\n\n“Kubrick fudges the supernatural issue for much of the film, deliberately misdirecting the audience towards a psychological explanation for the manifestations of evil,” said writer David Hughes in his book The Complete Kubrick. “This causes the viewer to wonder whether they’re inside the Overlook itself or merely inside Jack’s mind.”\n\nKubrick makes very clever use of mirrors and other visual tricks to keep the audience on edge and coming back for rewatches. As for me, I’ve probably seen the film at least five times, and I still have some unanswered questions.\n\nBack in pre-production, Kubrick had thrown out the original script, written by King himself. Kubrick felt like it was too didactic and literal to be a good horror story on its own, so he changed some elements with Diane Johnson to fit his vision. King wasn’t happy, of course, which is why he’s made the distinction ever since: Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining versus his own.\n\n“It was the first time that I had read to the end a novel that was sent to me with a view to a possible film adaptation,” Kubrick said. “I was absorbed in its reading and it seemed to me that its plot, ideas and structure were much more imaginative than usual in the horror genre; I thought that a great movie could come from there.”\n\nAccording to Kubrick’s executive producer/brother-in-law Jan Harlan, Kubrick explicitly wanted to alter plot details when he bought the rights to the novel. Let’s go over a few differences:\n\nThe infamous Room 237 from the film is actually Room 217 in the novel. This was done thanks to the insistence of the management at the Timberline Lodge in Oregon, where exterior hotel scenes were shot for the film. The hotel worried that no one would stay in Room 217, so they requested Kubrick to change it to Room 237, which doesn’t exist at the Timberline. Ironically, nowadays, Room 217 is the most requested room by far!\n\nStuart Ullman is described as a “prick” by Jack Torrance in the novel’s first chapter; however, in the film, he’s seen as friendly and charming.\n\nThe novel goes into much more detail about Jack’s abusive father, his alcoholism, and his struggles in his professional life. The film also prolongs Jack’s issues with writer’s block.\n\nThe novel also implies that some of the hotel’s malevolence might stem from being built on an ancient Native American burial ground. In the film, this is only mentioned briefly in passing by Ullman, although the hotel’s design incorporates Native American motifs and there are interpretations of the film that have made it a parable about the bloodier parts of American history.\n\nJack is shown to be much more well-intentioned in the novel than in the film, genuinely wanting to turn over a new leaf and stay sober. In both the novel and film, his interaction with a ghostly bartender and Grady (the ill-fated former caretaker) are pivotal to his descent into murder and insanity.\n\nJack kills Hallorann in the film, but only wounds him in the novel.\n\nThe ghost interaction where the young woman attempts to seduce Jack is very similar in both the book and film.\n\nDanny has a powerful interaction with his father towards the end of the novel, where he denounces the monster he sees in front of him as a creature created by the hotel. This prompts Jack to momentarily stop attacking his son and allow him to escape before the hotel possesses him completely. Danny, Wendy and Hallorann flee in a snowmobile while a defective boiler in the hotel’s basement explodes, killing Jack and destroying the hotel completely. In the film, this doesn’t happen: Jack gets lost in the hedge maze while chasing Danny with an ax. Danny then escapes with Wendy while Jack freezes to death.\n\nThe family tension is more prevalent throughout King’s novel, while Kubrick reveals the dysfunction much more gradually.\n\nIn the film, Danny has a much closer relationship with Wendy than with Jack; this adds to Jack’s growing sense of paranoia that his family is conspiring against him, which the hotel ghosts use to their advantage, stroking Jack’s ego while provoking him to rage and violence.\n\nThe film’s epilogue shows a famous black-and-white photo of Jack celebrating with partygoers at the hotel’s ballroom in a previous life, as the photo is dated 1921. The novel shows Danny and Wendy recovering from their horrific ordeal as Hallorann returns to the familiar mentor role for Danny.\n\nPart 5: Reception & King’s Response\n\nThe Shining premiered on May 23, 1980 in the US and October 2, 1980 in the UK. Like many of Kubrick’s other films, it drew polarizing reviews at first, but has since been reappraised and re-acclaimed as a modern-day classic.\n\nAnthony Burgess, writer of A Clockwork Orange, famously had a very mixed response to Kubrick’s adaptation of his work, and his involvement with the film’s screenplay was minimal. King was no exception. King referred to Kubrick’s film as “an interesting failure” and “like this big, flashy car with no engine in it.”\n\nAgain, while King felt that Kubrick’s film was beautifully shot and contained some memorable moments, he accused the director of not understanding the horror genre. King also claimed that it was the only adaptation of his work that he could remember hating. He believed that Kubrick’s worldview and personality couldn’t allow him to suspend his disbelief and make a full-fledged ghost story.\n\n“Parts of the film are chilling, charged with a relentlessly claustrophobic terror, but others fall flat. Not that religion has to be involved in horror, but a visceral skeptic such as Kubrick just couldn’t grasp the sheer inhuman evil of The Overlook Hotel,” King claimed.\n\n“So he looked, instead, for evil in the characters and made the film into a domestic tragedy with only vaguely supernatural overtones…that’s why, for all its virtuoso effects, it never gets you by the throat and hangs on the way real horror should.”\n\nKing thought that Kubrick had misinterpreted the themes, specifically viewing Jack’s demons being the sole cause of his actions, as opposed to the insidious influence of a haunted hotel. He also criticized Shelley Duvall’s performance: “She’s basically just there to scream and be stupid, and that’s not the woman that I wrote about,” he huffed.\n\nIn a 1983 interview with Playboy, King doubled down.\n\n“I had admired Kubrick for a long time and had great expectations for the project, but I was deeply disappointed in the end result. Parts of the film are chilling, charged with a relentlessly claustrophobic terror, but others fell flat. Jack Nicholson, although a fine actor, was all wrong for the part. The book is about Jack’s gradual descent into madness through the malign influence of the Overlook; if the guy is nuts to begin with, the entire tragedy of his downfall is wasted.”\n\nThe end result of Kubrick’s The Shining was what prompted King to be heavily involved in the production of any of his literary adaptations heading forward. In 1997, he got the chance to collaborate on a TV miniseries version of The Shining. Directed by Mick Garris, who also directed a TV adaptation of King’s The Stand, the miniseries was fairly well-received — and importantly, had King’s seal of approval. Exterior shots of the Overlook were also filmed at the Stanley Hotel in Colorado, which inspired the novel to begin with.\n\n“I had things to say about the Stanley Kubrick version of The Shining when the film was made,” King said in a 1998 interview. “And years later, I had a chance to re-adapt it for ABC as a miniseries. The question was whether or not Warner Brothers, who produced the movie and held the sequel rights, would allow us to do that. Warner Brothers went to Mr. Kubrick and asked if it would be alright, and he said yes as long as I didn’t say anything else one way or the other about the film version. But I did want to remake it, so draw your own conclusions.”\n\nAfter Kubrick’s sudden death in 1999, King has mostly taken the high road since then. “I’m not able to talk about The Shining,” King told Entertainment Weekly. “I made a deal with Stanley Kubrick that I wouldn’t, and Stan’s dead, so I’m not going to go there.”\n\n“King is, essentially, a novelist of morality. The decisions his characters make – whether it’s to confront a pack of vampires or to break 10 years of sobriety – are what matter to him,” said BBC journalist Laura Miller in a 2013 retrospective. “But in Kubrick’s The Shining, the characters are largely in the grip of forces beyond their control. It’s a film in which domestic violence occurs, while King’s novel is about domestic violence as a choice certain men make when they refuse to abandon a delusional, defensive entitlement. As King sees it, Kubrick treats his characters like insects because the director doesn’t really consider them capable of shaping their own fates. Everything they do is subordinate to an overweening, irresistible force, which is Kubrick’s highly developed aesthetic; they are its slaves. In King’s The Shining, the monster is Jack. In Kubrick’s, the monster is Kubrick.”\n\nWhen it came to the sequel novel Doctor Sleep, it was a different animal. The novel was published in 2013 and adapted for the screen in 2019 and follows Danny Torrance as an adult, haunted by substance abuse just like his dad and trying to maintain his sanity. In the afterword of the novel, King wrote the following:\n\n“Of course there was Stanley Kubrick’s movie, which many seem to remember – for reasons I have never quite understood – as one of the scariest films they have ever seen. If you have seen the movie but not read the novel, you should note that Doctor Sleep follows the latter which is, in my opinion, the True History of the Torrance Family.”\n\nDoctor Sleep director Mike Flanagan also spoke of the challenges that he faced trying to satisfy fans of both King’s The Shining and Kubrick’s version. While not as consistently terrifying as its film predecessor, Doctor Sleep is a very solid film and Ewan McGregor does a terrific job as Danny. King gave it a thumbs-up as well; he even went so far as to say that everything he disliked about Kubrick’s film was redeemed by the film version of Doctor Sleep.\n\n“The Shining is so ubiquitous and has burned itself into the collective imagination of people who love cinema in a way that so few movies have,” Flanagan admitted. “There’s no other language to tell that story in. If you say ‘Overlook Hotel,’ I see something. It lives right up in my brain because of Stanley Kubrick. You can’t pretend that isn’t the case.”\n\nIt’s safe to say that — at the risk of using an over-used term — that both Kubrick and King were alpha male personalities. I don’t really think there’s an alternate universe where they both would’ve been best friends and Kubrick would’ve made a film that satisfied both parties. With that said, I do appreciate both men’s visions and they’ve offered two memorable versions of the same story. And that’s rare.\n\nThe history of Hollywood is littered with angry writers who are pissed off at the Stanley Kubricks of the world, but at the end of the day, there’s a reason films and novels are treated so differently — because they ARE inherently different. You can’t please everybody, and when it comes to supernatural horror films, sometimes ambiguity can be your friend, and other times it can’t. I’m interested to hear what my readers think about this though. Let me know in the comments below!\n\nThe Tomorrow War (2021)\n\nIn the year 2051, a former soldier and military research scientist is drafted into a future war with aliens that threatens the planet.\n\nDan Forester is an Iraq War veteran who once aspired to transition from hardcore combat duty to the world of the lab geek, but he never quite gets the promotion he craves and struggles to re-adapt to suburban life with his wife Emmy and precocious daughter Muri.\n\nSuddenly, Dan’s world is turned upside-down when soldiers from the year 2051 arrive to warn humanity of a coming alien invasion that will decimate the planet. Panicked governments introduce universal conscription as the horrific Whitespikes destroy life as we know it. Civilians are drafted by the millions before being teleported to a week-long deployment in 2051 — by which time, the creatures have wreaked havoc on every continent and Earth’s population is only 500,000. Casualties are appallingly high and many survivors are forced to serve more than one tour.\n\nAfter initially trying to dodge the draft, Dan has no other choice. He must lead a tag team of new soldiers to extract valuable research in order to hatch a plan to destroy the Whitespikes. In the process, he’s forced to confront his own demons from his past and make peace with his (now-grown) daughter Muri, who’s now a high-ranking colonel.\n\nThis sci-fi action flick was originally supposed to premiere theatrically last Christmas. COVID-19 prevented that from happening — so Amazon picked up distribution rights and released it this past week over the July 4th weekend. I saw it myself and it certainly has its share of highlights.\n\nChris Pratt is excellent in the role of Dan Forester, a man with unrealized goals and lots of emotional baggage who, against his will, is plunged into an inferno of conflict. The Tomorrow War is another chance for Pratt to be taken seriously as an action star, and he mostly gets the job done. This is more of a serious and grounded role for Pratt to take, although there’s still plenty of opportunities for him to have witty one-liners and be the charismatic guy that audiences loved in Parks & Recreation, Jurassic World and Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\n“Even as he’s fashioned himself over the years into a wisecracking, low-rent Harrison Ford type, as an actor, Pratt tends to give off a more earnest and relatable dim-bulb vibe,” admitted Vulture‘s Bilge Eberi in a review of the film.\n\n“These aren’t bad things; quite the contrary, I think they’re secretly at the heart of Pratt’s everyman appeal. And they work to his advantage in The Tomorrow War, even though he’s technically playing someone who is supposed to be extremely smart, possibly even brilliant.”\n\nPratt’s performance does anchor the film and gives us an easily relatable protagonist. There’s also a cliched, albeit sincere father-daughter relationship between Pratt and Strahovski’s characters. The Australian actress, best known for a diverse array of TV roles like Dexter or The Handmaid’s Tale, gives another solid performance and her character helps give the film more emotional gravitas.\n\nNow on to the negatives. The film’s premise will either be embraced or rejected by audiences, depending on who they are. Sure, all sci-fi films carry an implication that you have to suspend your disbelief in order to get absorbed into the story. Put it this way: Star Wars should be riveting enough so that you aren’t concerning yourself over the logistics of how a lightsaber is made, you know?\n\nBut the universe that The Tomorrow War introduces us to is a wildly ambitious futuristic dystopia. The film does a good balance of not overloading the audience with exposition or over-explaining the plot to us, but also not making the plot too convoluted. Then again, The Tomorrow War does have its fair share of conveniences and plot holes that might get annoying for discerning viewers. All I’m saying is that it would’ve been far worse if, say, M Night Shyamalan or the Wachowskis got their hands on it…\n\nThe movie is very well-acted, the visual effects are top-notch, and I was very happy to see that any shaky-cam action sequences were thankfully left at the door. As for the direction, it’s perfectly competent. Chris McKay directed The Tomorrow War, and it’s his first live-action feature; he previously worked as an assistant animation director for The LEGO Movie, which also starred Pratt, and also helmed a few episodes of Robot Chicken.\n\nMcKay has a keen eye for detail, but you can kind of tell that he’s a newcomer to live-action films. Some of the early action sequences feel much more like video games or interactive VR apps than a summer blockbuster, and then there are some parts of the third act that were just a little too silly. The story doesn’t grasp its full potential, but I do have to give kudos to McKay for making such an ambitious first live-action feature. I just felt like the whole film bit off a bit more than it can chew.\n\nUltimately, The Tomorrow War has some flashy action scenes and fun, 90s-esque alien invasion drama, but it doesn’t quite knock it out of the park due to a labored storyline. But if you just want an energetic popcorn flick with Chris Pratt fighting aliens, you could certainly do worse. It’s not a home run, but it could be a nice base hit.\n\nGrade: C+\n\nDirected by Chris McKay\n\nProduced by Jules Daley, David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, David S.

And it’s definitely not every day that one of the main subjects of said documentary becomes an worldwide action star and one of the biggest box office draws in the world.\n\nBut that’s exactly what happened with Pumping Iron, the bodybuilding doco that made Arnold Schwarzenegger a household name and cemented his appeal as a charismatic crossover icon between fitness sports and action movies.\n\nThe film primarily looks at the similarities, differences, and common competitiveness between Schwarzenegger and his biggest rival, Lou Ferrigno, who later had a film career of his own. There’s also smaller subplots in the film surrounding Mike Katz, a former New York Jets player who turned to bodybuilding, and Franco Columbu, an Italian bodybuilder and close friend of Schwarzenegger’s who later won the Mr Olympia titles in 1976 and 1981.\n\nThe directing/cinematography team of George Butler and Robert Fiore decided to look at bodybuilding from a newcomer’s perspective. Initially they had wanted to follow actor Bud Cort as he began his journey to gain muscle and train like the bodybuilders did. Cort, who was lifting at the famous Gold’s Gym in Venice, California, had become friends with Schwarzenegger, and after meeting the two men, Butler and Fiore shot some scenes. With Cort’s permission, they later decided to take the project in a different direction, instead focusing on Schwarzenegger and the other men attempting to take home the goods at the 1975 Mr Universe and Mr Olympia competitions. Pumping Iron was specifically shot within the 100 days leading up to the two events.\n\nSchwarzenegger recalled in his memoir that bodybuilding had struggled to gain mainstream acceptance in the 1970s. Relatively new to America at the time, Schwarzenegger had become a wunderkind in bodybuilding thanks to his surprising victory at the Mr Universe contest in 1967 when he was only 20. Inspired by other Hollywood strongmen like Steve Reeves and Reg Park, Schwarzenegger also had his eye on becoming a movie star — which, of course, is exactly what happened, and his status was greatly helped by Pumping Iron.\n\nHowever, the low-budget doco soon ran into serious trouble after filming for the Mr Olympia contest was completed. Butler and Fiore’s brainchild languished in development hell after the duo ran out of money. Thankfully, within the two years — from filming in 1975 to the movie’s premiere in 1977 — Schwarzenegger had appeared in a 1976 film called Stay Hungry alongside Sally Field and Jeff Bridges. The character of Joe Santo was specifically developed with Schwarzenegger in mind and was also a Mr Olympia trainee. Although Stay Hungry flopped at the box office, Arnold ended up winning the Golden Globe for Best Acting Debut in a Motion Picture, even though it technically wasn’t his first film.\n\nThanks to their star’s newfound fame, Butler and Fiore thought that they might finally have the clout and money to finish Pumping Iron and give it a proper release. The bodybuilders in the film contributed funds and the group collectively planned an ambitious exhibit at New York’s Whitney Museum of American Art. The exhibit actually featured all the athletes in the film appearing on rotating platforms and striking poses just as they would in a competition. Then art critics would analyze the athletes and their poses, which allowed the Pumping Iron team to demonstrate the same philosophy presented in the film: that bodybuilders are simply modern extensions of Greco-Roman statues, with similar muscle sizes and proportions.\n\nThe event was a smashing success, both in terms of raising more than enough money to finish editing the film and in recognizing Schwarzenegger as an actor with crossover appeal. In his memoir Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story, the “Austrian Oak” described his thought process when the Whitney Museum staged the event:\n\n“We weren’t sure whether this idea was stupid or really brilliant. The Whitney Museum, which was known for unconventional stuff, leaped at the opportunity. This was the first time anyone had a serious public discussion about bodybuilding. George was hoping for a few hundred people, but despite a snowstorm that night, more than 2,500 showed up and the line stretched around the block. Probably two-thirds of the crowd had never even seen a bodybuilder before…All of a sudden, bodybuilding was hip. We’d made it out of the sports world and the carnival world and into international pop culture.\n\nThe whole thing was mainly a publicity stunt, of course. But I thought that talking about the body as sculpture made sense. Art fascinated me, and if the comparison to sculpture attracted outsiders and helped them understand, then great! Anything was better than the stereotype of bodybuilders as stupid, gay, narcissistic, muscle-bound freaks.”\n\nObviously even for a documentary, you need drama and tension. And Pumping Iron delivers that in spades; i.e. it isn’t just Bodybuilding 101 for newcomers. The main rivalry in the piece comes from the main contest itself: Schwarzenegger as the favorite, and Ferrigno as the underdog. By 1975, Schwarzenegger had already won multiple Mr Olympia and Mr Universe titles and was arguably the best bodybuilder on earth. In fact, it was originally difficult for Butler and Fiore to convince Arnold to do the film, as he wanted to permanently retire from bodybuilding in order to focus on acting full-time. Ferrigno, meanwhile, was a mountain of a man — a 6’8″ New Yorker whose police lieutenant father helped him train — and he was determined to beat Schwarzenegger and take the crown for himself.\n\nThe smaller scale rivalry between Mike Katz and Ken Waller was also a key component to Pumping Iron‘s dramatic heft. While Schwarzenegger and Ferrigno competed for the professional Mr Olympia title, Waller and Katz were fighting for the amateur Mr Universe title.\n\n“What we did,” Butler later said in an interview with film website Den of Geek, “is we went for an audience outside of the sport — and we defined bodybuilding to a world who knew nothing about bodybuilding.”\n\nIn the same article, writer Ryan Lambie explained the broader context of Pumping Iron‘s appeal and legacy, 40-plus years after it was released:\n\n“Pumping Iron arrived as a fitness craze began to take hold in America. A year earlier in 1976, Rocky had made Sylvester Stallone a star, establishing his character as a humble, blue-collar southpaw who, through grit and determination, honed himself into a boxer with a shot at championship glory. Just as Rocky was a rags-to-riches tale, Pumping Iron had its own, similar spin on the American Dream: here was Arnold Schwarzenegger, a migrant from Europe, who through sheer force of will, had transformed himself into an Adonis.“\n\nButler was raised in Jamaica, where bodybuilding had a solid following. In an interview with Iron Age magazine, he reflected on the humble beginnings of the sport in America:\n\n“What you’ve got to understand is that back in the early 70’s, bodybuilding was the least glamorous sport in the world,” Butler admitted.\n\n“Look at it this way: Arnold Schwarzenegger arrived in America in 1968, and when we met him in 1972, the Mr. Olympia contest was held in a tiny little auditorium in Brooklyn and the prize money was something like $1000. Only Arnold and Franco were making it as professional bodybuilders. Everyone else had another job.”\n\nShot on a tiny $1 million budget, Pumping Iron did a lot more than just launch Schwarzenegger’s career or help make bodybuilding more mainstream. Ferrigno landed the role of Bruce Banner/The Hulk largely due to his physical prowess, and he enjoys a film career to this day as well. Female bodybuilders also took center stage in Butler’s later documentary Pumping Iron II: The Women, which was released in 1985.\n\nRaw Iron, a making-of type of sequel, was made 25 years later by filmmaking brothers Scott and Dave McVeigh, interviewing all the major players in a “where are they now?” type of retrospective. Butler’s producing partner, Jerome Gray, also teamed up for a 2013 doco called Generation Iron, which examined the impact that pro bodybuilding has to this day. It’s safe to say that Pumping Iron‘s legacy is alive and well.\n\nGrade: B+\n\nDirected by George Butler and Robert Fiore\n\nProduced by George Butler and Jerome Gary\n\nBased on the book by Charles Gaines and George Butler\n\nStarring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lou Ferrigno, Mike Katz, Ken Waller, Franco Colombu, Ed Corney, Frank Zane\n\nDirector of Photography – Robert Fiore\n\nMusic by Michael Small\n\nEditors – Geof Bartz and Larry Silk\n\nRated PG\n\nTRIVIA\n\nSome events in the documentary were fictionalized or modified, including the now-infamous claim that Arnold Schwarzenegger didn’t attend his father’s funeral due to bodybuilding commitments. In reality, Schwarzenegger had a very complicated/strained relationship with his father, but the reasoning used in the film was intentionally done in order to show how dedicated bodybuilders had to be.\n\nSimilarly, the conflict between Mike Katz and Ken Waller in the film, in which Waller steals one of Katz’s t-shirts, was intended to be a playful prank and was merely dramatized to raise the stakes in the film. Despite their bodybuilding rivalry, Waller and Katz were very respectful of each other; Waller later admitted that he regretted participating in the scene, as audiences didn’t know it was supposed to be a prank and even booed him at later competitions.\n\nThe original plot of the movie, as mentioned above, was going to feature actor Bud Cort training with Schwarzenegger at Gold’s Gym in order to gain muscle for a new role — thereby showing both Cort and the audience valuable techniques that bodybuilders use in real life. George Butler decided to switch gears and make the doco that became Pumping Iron, but Cort left the project on good terms and was even willing to donate the remainder of his salary. The footage of Cort and Schwarzenegger was left on the cutting room floor, but was later restored as part of the 25th anniversary re-release in 2002.\n\nMore than 100 hours of footage was shot.\n\nAlthough he’s only featured briefly in the film, Franco Columbu was a lifelong friend of Schwarzenegger’s; they had trained and competed together in Europe and immigrated to the US at around the same time. Columbu, the son of a Sardinian sheep farmer, later won two Mr Olympia titles, appeared in several Schwarzenegger films and later became a licensed chiropractor. He tragically drowned after suffering a heart attack while swimming in his native Italy in August 2019.\n\nFirst Reformed (2017)\n\nA New York minister must deal with dwindling church attendance, emotionally-disturbed parishioners and health problems — all while also facing a crisis of faith.\n\nErnst Toller is a Presbyterian minister at the historic First Reformed Church in Snowbridge, New York. Once a famous stop on the Underground Railroad, the church is now a shell of its former self. Typically boasting less than 20 attendees at Sunday services, the church mostly serves as a tourist attraction, and Toller is preparing for a bittersweet 250th church anniversary in the coming months.\n\nThings aren’t much better in Toller’s personal life, either. Formerly a military chaplain, Toller lost his son, Joseph, in the Iraq War — and his wife subsequently divorced him because he had encouraged Joseph to enlist in the first place. Toller also struggles with alcohol and some unrelated health problems. He pours over the writings of Thomas Merton and GK Chesterton, hoping to get out of his spiritual funk. He has a friendly relationship with Pastor Joel Jeffers, who runs Abundant Life, a megachurch up the road in Albany that is part of the same denomination and helps prop up the financially-struggling First Reformed. However, since Jeffers’s church is thriving and Toller’s isn’t, Toller feels self-conscious around him.\n\nToller is approached by Mary, a pregnant parishioner who is very worried about her non-Christian husband, Michael. Michael, a radical environmentalist, is attempting to pressure his wife into an abortion because he’s convinced that it would be irresponsible to bring children into a world that will soon be ruined by climate change. Toller attempts to counsel both of them, but an explosive discovery will soon change everyone’s lives and give Toller a chance to exorcise his inner demons.\n\nThis film is brilliant. I didn’t get a chance to see it when it came out, but I knew and trusted the opinions of people who had seen it and decided to rent it on Amazon Prime. Paul Schrader has created a tour-de-force film that is both uncompromising and thought-provoking.\n\nFor those who aren’t familiar, Schrader is one of the most decorated screenwriters in modern film — he wrote both Raging Bull and Taxi Driver for Martin Scorsese and has directed acclaimed dramas such as Affliction, American Gigolo and Light Sleeper. “It doesn’t really matter what I do; the first line of my obituary will be ‘the writer of Taxi Driver,” Schrader quipped in an interview with America magazine.\n\nSchrader grew up in a very strict Christian Reformed household in Michigan where movies weren’t allowed at all; he saw his first movie at age 17. He majored in philosophy and minored in theology before attending grad school for screenwriting at UCLA. Now 74, Schrader has had quite a career, but much like his buddy Scorsese, his religious background still looms large on screen (Scorsese, who considered entering the priesthood as a young man, once quipped, “All I’ve had my whole life are movies and religion.”).\n\nFirst Reformed takes an uncompromising yet delicate look at many controversial (and relevant) topics, such as climate change, abortion and the relevance of faith and the church in everyday life. Some of the most interesting parts of the film are when Toller talks with his minister counterpart, Jeffers. Jeffers is clearly focused on church growth and presenting an impressive spectacle on Sunday mornings, which clashes with Toller’s somber, quiet services. We see Toller’s compassion firsthand in his interactions with Mary and Michael.\n\nMichael is a true radical, clashing with cops at protests and believing that the entire planet is doomed. But he’s portrayed in a true three-dimensional fashion and has such a tortured conscience that it’s hard not to understand him, even if his actions are extreme. Put simply: the script fleshes out what could be a tin-foil hat nutcase and makes him shockingly sympathetic. Meanwhile, Toller begins asking himself tough questions that challenge both himself and his faith.\n\nSchrader’s writing deliberately parallels his greatest script: Taxi Driver. As Schrader himself puts it, both films are “man in a room” stories about characters that battle “a sickness of the soul.” Schrader wrote the script for Taxi Driver when he was a near-suicidal alcoholic, but now admits that he’s in a much better emotional state. Either way, both films have some surprising similarities.\n\nLikewise, the inclusion of Christian philosophers like Chesterton and Merton was intentional, too.\n\n“Merton is the Trappist monk for smart Christians, just like T.S. Eliot and C. S. Lewis are writers for smart Christians,” says Schrader. “Hopefully he’ll be made a saint someday. His home base was in Kentucky at The Abbey of Gethsemani. Ethan did two sabbaticals there and knows Merton more than I do.”\n\nSpeaking of which, the real anchor for First Reformed is Ethan Hawke as Toller. I’ve long considered Hawke a criminally underrated actor (Training Day, his first Oscar nomination, is one of my favorite films, and seeing a young Hawke go toe-to-toe with Denzel Washington never gets old.). Hawke frequently picks interesting scripts, and this is no exception. He displays such humanity in a normally stoic character and his presence lifts the film significantly.\n\nHawke was raised Episcopalian and his mother was a Sunday school teacher. He said that his own beliefs had some similarities to the film’s themes of both faith and environmental issues.\n\n“The wonderful thing about my exposure to the religious community was that my mother and father had very different opinions about things and it created not one rigid attitude in my brain,” Hawke said in a phone interview with Canada’s National Post.\n\n“I would consider myself a transcendentalist, if I had to put a label on it,” Hawke continued. “I really love Emerson and Thoreau and these people who are rooted in the Christian orientation that is seen through the prism of being a part of nature. That’s been my great love and joy.”\n\nHawke said he enjoyed portraying a religious figure that was both complex and emotionally deep.\n\n“I guess it’s kind of a philosophy about blurring the line between character and performer to such an extent that there is no line, that there is no ‘performance,’ that you’re inhabiting and living in an imaginary space but that while you’re there you’re really doing it,” Hawke said.\n\nSchrader made daring choices with his supporting cast, too: Pastor Jeffers is played by Cedric the Entertainer in a rare dramatic role (he’s credited as Cedric Kyles). Amanda Seyfried, an actress typically known for breezy comedies, is stellar in her portrayal of Mary.\n\nThis film has a lot of twists and turns and is a startling and bold choice for Schrader. He laughs about the genesis of it now.\n\nThe seeds of First Reformed were sown in 2015, when Schrader was presenting an award to Polish filmmaker Pawel Pawlikowski at the New York Film Critics Circle. The two men had had spiritual conversations before and had discussed how to portray them in a fresh way onscreen.\n\nWalking home after the awards ceremony, Schrader admitted, “I said to myself, ‘You know, it’s time — time to write that script that you promised you would never write. It’s time to do a spiritual film.”\n\nSchrader shot First Reformed on a tiny budget ($3.5 million) in only 20 days. Many directors might find that restricting, but Schrader is a glass-half-full kind of guy.\n\n“One of the nice things about making films today is the new technology,” he explained. “When I began in movies, this one would have been 45 days, and 45 days is no longer a responsible financial investment. You don’t even want to try because you know people will lose money and you’ll hurt your career.” He adds, “I can go to an investor and say, ‘Look, at this price point, with this cast, this is about investment’ — and I wouldn’t be lying. I can actually believe that now. If I’d said it ten years ago, I would have been lying.”\n\nHe also believes that the film gave him some catharsis from a religious, movie-free childhood.\n\n“I don’t know to what degree I’ve ever left the church,” Schrader admitted. “Obviously, when I was in Los Angeles, I wasn’t going to church. When I had kids, we went to the Episcopalian church. Then the kids grew up, and I dropped out again. But then, about three years ago, I switched to Presbyterian, and that’s where I go now.”\n\nSchrader was taken aback by the overwhelmingly positive reception that First Reformed got when it premiered at the Venice International Film Festival in 2017. He’s confident that people will continue to appreciate his film in the years to come.\n\n“It has a very nice shelf life. People come back to it. It stays in the mind. It’s not like a movie you see and then a week later you don’t remember whether you saw it or not.”\n\nGrade: A+\n\nWritten and directed by Paul Schrader\n\nProduced by David Hinojosa, Frank Murray and Christine Vachon\n\nDirector of Photography — Alexander Dynan\n\nMusic by Brian Williams\n\nEditor — Benjamin Rodriguez Jr.\n\nStarring Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric Kyles, Philip Ettinger, Victoria Hill and Michael Gaston\n\nRated R for some disturbing violent images.\n\nTRIVIA\n\nSchrader was heavily influenced by several films when writing the script, including French director Robert Bresson’s Diary of a Country Priest (1951) and Ingmar Bergman’s Winter Light (1963). To Schrader’s amusement, he said he didn’t really notice the Taxi Driver similarities until he was watching the film in editing.\n\nSchrader’s relationship with Pawlikowski also influenced his decision to shoot First Reformed in a 4:3 aspect ratio. Schrader remarked that the framing of the film evoked a claustrophobic feeling that he really liked.\n\nAmanda Seyfried actually was pregnant during filming. Schrader had found out when she expressed interest in the project and decided to write it into the script.\n\nThis is Cedric the Entertainer’s first film under his birth name, Cedric Kyles.\n\nSchrader received his first-ever Academy Award nomination for First Reformed’s screenplay.\n\nThe location of First Reformed is actually the Zion Episcopal Church in Douglaston, Queens. Other filming was done in and around Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nErnst Toller shares a name with the early 20th century German playwright, a left-wing provocateur who wrote Expressionist theatre works and later fled to the US when the Nazis took over.\n\nThe only film of 2017 to receive a Best Original Screenplay nomination, but not a Best Picture nomination.\n\nThe books on Toller’s desk consist of the Bible, Heretics by GK Chesteron, Thomas Merton: a Life in Letters and The Cloud of Unknowing, a Medieval collection of Catholic mystic writings.\n\nWalking Out (2017)\n\nA teenager and his estranged father encounter unexpected danger during a moose hunt in rural Montana.\n\nEvery year, 16-year-old David flies from his mother’s home in Texas to spend part of his school break with his estranged father Cal in the Montana wilderness. But this year, things are different: Cal wants David to have a true coming-of-age moment: by hunting and killing his first moose.\n\nCal is masculine and old-school. He lives (mostly) off the grid in a small cabin and rebukes his son for being addicted to his smartphone. He explains why it’s so important to be self-reliant and mentally tough, especially when hunting game. He teaches David to shoot his rifle responsibly and to anticipate sudden weather changes. Through flashbacks, we see Cal’s own adolescent experiences with his late father and see why he values the things that he does. While he resents his dad’s rules at first, David is a quick learner and begins to develop a closer relationship with him as they begin their multi-day journey to track the moose. But when disaster strikes, David must draw upon all of his skills to ensure that they both get home in one piece.\n\nThis simple, suspenseful adventure film premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival and received critical acclaim. I myself was first introduced to it by watching it on Amazon Prime. I’ve long been a fan of Matt Bomer, who portrays Cal, and I thought this was a unique role for him to take. Bomer, 43, is probably best known for playing morally dubious characters like the slick con artist Neil Caffrey in the TV show White Collar or as rogue agent Bryce Larkin on NBC’s spy comedy Chuck. But in this role, Bomer shines as the rugged outdoorsman — and might have given his best performance yet.\n\nBased on a short story by David Quammen, the script was adapted and directed by the Smith brothers, Alex and Andrew, who are known for their on-location shooting.\n\n“The landscape is the character, and we don’t want the setting to ever feel as if it were generic,” said Alex. “For us, it’s really crucial, especially when you are dealing with a piece of literature that is set in Montana, to shoot it in Montana.”\n\n“I think that one of the keys to shooting in Montana is that you need to be in the right space at the right moment,” said Andrew. “You need to be flexible and anticipate what’s going to happen.”\n\nThe brothers, who grew up in the working-class suburbs of Missoula, have represented Big Sky country in several of their previous films, including The Slaughter Rule, a 2002 indie film which revolved around the complicated relationship between a high school football player and his troubled coach (played by Ryan Gosling and David Morse, respectively). That film also got a good amount of acclaim at Sundance, but I didn’t particularly love it. Walking Out improves upon some of the Smith brothers’ earlier work, namely in terms of cinematography and acting. In addition to Bomer, Josh Wiggins does a terrific job as David, and veteran character actor Bill Pullman pops up in flashbacks as Cal’s father.\n\n“I grew up in a house full of outdoorsmen and that type of male bonding exhibited in the film,” Bomer said in an interview with GoldDerby.com. “That type of outdoorsmanship and male bonding through quiet and unspoken connection — where you’re not really sure how to connect — was something I understood from my childhood.”\n\nBomer also heaped praise on his co-star, Wiggins.\n\n“Josh is a superstar. He has this great thing that you can’t really teach. He’s so intuitive, and he has a great lack of self-awareness and a lack of vanity that you need. But it’s hard to find in younger actors.”\n\nBomer appreciated the unique opportunities he received on the film, even though they included sharing the screen with only one other actor for the vast majority of filming — not to mention freezing temperatures.\n\n“This was not the type of set where we were going to be coddled in any way,” Bomer admitted. “There were no trailers. You stood in the snow between takes and got ready for the next scene, and I wouldn’t have had it any other way, to be honest with you.”\n\n“We like those stories of people who struggle, and a good story to use is one where someone struggles really hard and overcomes that struggle in some capacity,” added Alex Smith.\n\nWalking Out is not without its flaws, mind you. The first 40 minutes or so are very slow-paced and can be a tough slog to get through, even if the film’s ultra-suspenseful second act makes it worth it. Also, if you’re looking for especially nuanced storytelling or interesting subplots and supporting characters, look elsewhere. But if you want a raw, intense survival drama with some outstanding acting, you could certainly do worse. I think the Smith brothers have a unique voice to continue to tell interesting and original stories in the future.\n\nGrade: B-\n\nWritten for the screen and directed by Alex and Andrew Smith\n\nBased on the short story by David Quammen\n\nProduced by Brunson Green and Laura Ivey\n\nDirector of Photography — Todd McMullen\n\nMusic by Ernst Reijseger\n\nEditor — Michael Taylor\n\nStarring Matt Bomer, Josh Wiggins, Bill Pullman and Lily Gladstone\n\nRated PG-13 for bloody injury images, some thematic elements and brief strong language.\n\nTRIVIA\n\nThe Smith brothers were not originally supposed to direct. Producer Rodrigo Garcia brought the short story by David Quammen to the Smiths in order for them to adapt the screenplay, with Garcia directing it himself. Later on, he stepped aside and the brothers took over.\n\nChristian Bale was originally considered for the role of Cal. He declined the script because he had recently become a dad and didn’t want to be away shooting on location for multiple months.\n\nThe Smiths had originally read Quammen’s short story in high school and had been trying to adapt it for years.\n\nMost of the film was shot in and around Paradise Valley and Bozeman, Montana.\n\nThe Smith brothers decided to cast Josh Wiggins as David after being impressed with his performance in the 2014 domestic drama Hellion.\n\nIn the film, David spends most of the year with his mother at their home in Texas. In reality, both Bomer and Wiggins were raised in Houston. Their respective suburbs were a mere 10 minutes from each other.\n\nBecause the cast was so small, the Smiths didn’t even hold auditions. They interviewed various actors over Skype instead. Bomer and Wiggins had not even met each other until the first day of filming.\n\nAll three of the Smith brothers films have been set and filmed in Montana, after The Slaughter Rule, Winter in the Blood, and now Walking Out.\n\nThe Lighthouse (2019)\n\nTwo lighthouse keepers attempt to keep their sanity while living on a tiny, isolated New England island.\n\nOff the coast of New England in the 1890s, Ephraim Winslow, a former logger, takes a contract job for a month as a lighthouse keeper or “wickie” alongside veteran sailor Thomas"
