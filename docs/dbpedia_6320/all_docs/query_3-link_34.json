        "text": "While The Boys has taken a decidedly less satirical turn toward the rise of fascism and the impending fall of American Democracy in its current season (Ha ha! So fun and funny!), it primarily started as a somewhat lighter critique of Marvel’s excess and greed. And how better to bring the show full circle and parody the bloat of the real Vought Corporation than bloating your own series right at the very end?\n\nThat’s Laz Alonso’s (a.k.a. Mother’s Milk) idea, at least. “I’ve been unsuccessfully pitching that we end the show with a feature film to Eric [Kripke],” Alonso said at a recent live taping of the Happy Sad Confused podcast, alongside a few of his fellow cast mates. “Like, make the last episode of season five a cliffhanger and announce the film that we’ve been filming since the beginning of the series, pretty much,” he continued. “But he [Kripke] always somehow gets out of that one.”\n\nAt the very least, releasing a full cut of the in-universe feature Dawn Of The Seven could be a fun tie-in to add to the current pile of Boys spinoffs. Whether this is the specific “film we’ve been filming” is unclear, but Alonso clearly has ideas. It would be a “feature film” released in theaters, he clarified, before asking “What do you guys think?” to raucous cheers from the audience.\n\nThose same Hometeamers should at least be happy to know that Kripke has had the last season (announced in June) planned for a while, surprise film or not. During the panel, Ashley actor Colby Minifie confirmed that “we knew [that the show was ending] for a while,” before Antony Starr (Homelander) elaborated that Kripke “started the show saying that it was always in his head to go five seasons.”\n\n“I think everyone wants to go out on a strong note, and I think there’s nothing worse—and I’ve been involved in a show that did this, it was fucking horrible—you do that last season and it’s shit. And you get remembered very poorly and you have to kind of wear that,” Starr continued. “I like to think that we will go out on a really strong note and I think we all deserve that.”\n\nThat being said, don’t count the movie out quite yet. While the form might not have a great track record thus far (cough, cough, Community), Kripke always seems to have a trick or two up his sleeve. “Should we get everybody to @ Eric Kripke on Twitter?” Alonso suggested, to a fresh round of cheers. You know what they say: Twitter, do your thing.\n\nYou can watch the full Happy Sad Confused conversation below:"
