        "text": "George Clooney’s newest film, The Boys in the Boat, is finally here. Based on Daniel James Brown’s bestselling book of the same name, The Boys in the Boat follows a competitive rowing team that sails to victory amid The Great Depression. When it debuted in 2013, the book received glowing reviews from and The Guardian, along with a warm reception from readers. Years later, MGM Studios acquired The Boys in the Boat's film rights, and Clooney eventually joined the project. Now, we can finally see the story come to life.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with The Boys in the Boat, here's the film's logline: \"During the height of the Great Depression, members of the rowing team at the University of Washington get thrust into the spotlight as they compete for gold at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.\" The Boys in the Boat stars Callum Turner, Joel Edgerton, Jack Mulhern, Hadley Robinson, Thomas Elms, and Luke Slattery.\n\nNow, with The Boys in the Boat in theaters, you might be curious about the real-life sports moment behind the film. Here's everything we know about the events that inspired The Boys in the Boat.\n\nIs The Boys in the Boat Based on a True Story?\n\nThe Boys in the Boat is based on the University of Washington's rowing team, which competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. At home, America was in the throes of the Great Depression, and members of the team—many of whom came from lower-class families—competed because they couldn't afford their college fees. Little did they know, their athletic careers would be televised in the first-ever broadcast of the Olympics—and they'd take home the gold medal, edging out Italy and Germany.\n\nIn an interview with Screen Rant, Clooney spoke about The Boys in the Boat's true story. “That’s what made this story so special,” he said. “It’s the Depression, and these guys have no money. And Washington State was a very poor area. Everybody was poor, but they were really poverty properly poor, lumberjacks mostly. So they did it to eat, and they did it to get in school and try to get an education and get ahead. And they ended up being the Beatles.”\n\nWhat Happened During the 1936 Olympics?\n\nThe 1936 Olympics took place in Berlin, and Germany spread propaganda throughout the event. Led by the Hitler regime, Germany presented the image of a strong and unified country, while it hid its cruelties to Jews and minorities from the rest of the world. At the time, Germany had begun to operate the Dachau facility, which would become their longest-running concentration camp. Ahead of the games, Hitler cleared signs of antisemitism from Berlin—removing Nazi posters and publications from the city so visitors wouldn’t know what was happening.\n\nWhen other countries arrived to compete in the Olympics, they saw Germany as a peaceful nation. Despite the attempted cover-up, many activists were aware of the Nazi regime and boycotted the event. Some leaders even pointed to the fact that Germany broke Olympic rules banning discrimination based on race and religion, among other concerns—but they were unsuccessful. Germany invaded Poland just three years later, sparking the start of World War II.\n\nThe Boys in the Boat follows the University of Washington rowing team, which won a gold medal at the 1939 Olympics.\n\nWho is Joe Rantz?\n\nJoe Rantz is the main subject of both The Boys in the Boat film and book. In an interview with TIME, Brown explained how he met the Olympian. Years ago, Brown hosted a homeowner’s association meeting. Afterward, one of his neighbors asked if he’d like to meet his father, who was a fan of his books. Brown accepted the invitation and was introduced to Rantz.\n\nAfter hearing about his life, Brown asked Rantz if he could write a book about him, but Rantz declined and said he should write about the boat instead. “I didn’t know what he meant at first,” Brown told TIME. “And I realized he meant the guys who had rowed with him. It was very important to him that the book not be about one individual, but what they had all done together.”\n\nThough Rantz’s teammates are also featured in the movie, his life story is what anchors the film. Rantz was born in 1914 in Spokane, Washington. His mother died when he was a toddler and his dad eventually remarried. Unfortunately, Rantz and his stepmother had a fraught relationship. One day, he came home from school and his entire family had packed up their belongings and left—forcing Rantz to fend for himself.\n\nYears later, Rantz was accepted into the University of Washington and joined the rowing team, eventually becoming an Olympic athlete.\n\nWhat Happened to the University of Washington Rowing Team After the Olympics?\n\nAfter winning the gold medal, Rantz and his teammates returned home to America. In 1939, Rantz graduated with a degree in chemical engineering and married his girlfriend, Joyce. Later on, he accepted a job at Boeing and worked there until his retirement.\n\nAs for his teammates? Thankfully, they were spared from fighting in World War II. “Most of them did not wind up fighting during the war,” Brown told TIME. “They were a little older than the usual draftees at that point. The ones with engineering degrees were put to work designing and building aircraft for the war effort.”\n\nIf you already saw The Boys in the Boat and want to relive the story, you can pick up Brown's book below."
