        "text": "The techniques on display in The Boys in the Boat are so obvious, redundant even, that we become aware of the manipulation, and thus lose investment.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Jul 19, 2024\n\nI have no doubt the real Joe Nantz and his coach and teammates were fine, complex human beings who certainly deserve to be more than mannequin-esque characters in a film that indulges every sports-movie trope.\n\nFull Review | May 28, 2024\n\nAlthough the characters sometimes lack the necessary charisma to successfully advance the plot, it is important to highlight that the boat racing scenes are masterfully filmed. [Full review in Spanish]\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 6/10 | Apr 2, 2024\n\nRowers with their rather basic conflicts, but functional to a story that seeks easy empathy... [Full review in Spanish]\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Mar 28, 2024\n\nAn emotionally frugal sports drama so elemental it strides into a creative coma, George Clooney overdoses on old fashioned aspirations.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Mar 12, 2024\n\nThe Boys in the Boat offers modest excitement during the competitive sports scenes but falls short in other aspects, running out of steam well before its conclusion. Viewers are left craving more than just a trivial account of the facts.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Feb 23, 2024\n\nClooney has given us a reminder of all the reasons people once went to the cinema and suggests those preferences have been repressed but not abandoned.\n\nFull Review | Feb 18, 2024\n\nBased on Daniel James Brown's non-fiction best-seller, it's a rousing underdog sports saga set during the great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 7/10 | Feb 7, 2024\n\n[The Boys in the Boat] assures us that the triumph of the soul is working together, not apart. It is a simple sentiment to be sure, but watching Clooney’s beautifully constructed period piece it is pretty much all I could think about.\n\nFull Review | Jan 31, 2024\n\nThe Boys In The Boat is beautiful to look at but lacks the serious depth that it needed to become a classic film.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Jan 29, 2024\n\n\"Fine\" is all well and good when you're making a by the numbers sports movie. The story of this team, however, deserved more, and what Clooney serves up is a portentous slobs vs. snobs with the patina of cinematic legitimacy.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1.5/5 | Jan 25, 2024\n\nI enjoyed the film as I have always delighted in learning about different topics, and now I have an understanding of the sport of rowing and a genuine appreciation for how this event happened--great performances as well.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Jan 20, 2024\n\nIt's a serviceable sports drama, George Clooney as director plays it safe. It's nothing you haven't seen before, but it is extremely watchable.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Jan 18, 2024\n\nIt’s the kind of Disney movie that not even Disney makes any more — an ode to dimpled, decent, self-deprecating American manliness of the kind Clooney personifies on screen with a knowing twinkle, only minus the twinkle.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Jan 17, 2024\n\nThere is an elegance, a grace, that Clooney strives for in The Boys In The Boat, and although the film is mostly a misfire, the director’s still able to create moments of tension. If only he could sustain it elsewhere.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/5 | Jan 15, 2024"
