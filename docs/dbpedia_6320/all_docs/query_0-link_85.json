        "text": "Although not, strictly speaking, all 'Sixties' television programmes, the great 'swashbuckling' action adventure series produced during the Fifties and into the early Sixties enjoyed many repeat transmissions during the early and mid-Sixties and were certainly vital viewing for me and still remain as some of my strongest and dearest memories of childhood television. So popular and enduring were the characters and stories that they are still periodically being shown on various channels and stand up well even against today's high-tec productions. With the passage of time it is fascinating to see the early screen activities of actors who went on to become household names and big screen stars.\n\nStrangely, the swashbuckler genre was not initiated by British television companies but rather as a result of American film studios attempting to win back or attract dwindling cinema audiences lost to the new medium of television. Many of the classic epics, lavish biblical and historical films had been produced in Britain, partly as a result of American movie companies earnings being frozen by the government of the time, and mainly British cast and crew were used to produce such cinema classics as Ivanhoe, Knights of The Round Table and The Master of Ballantrae.\n\nOther British swashbuckling films of the Fifties included The Son of Robin Hood, The Black Knight and Rob Roy: The Highland Rogue, with American offerings such as The Story of Robin Hood and his Merrie Men and, of course, Treasure Island, which was made in Australia. The success of the Walt Disney film, with Robert Newton starring as Long John Silver, soon had calls for further adventures featuring the peg-legged pirate. Newton was duly signed up, starring in another film, followed by television's The Adventures of Long John Silver. No-one since seems to have portrayed the character with quite the same panache.\n\nThe Sixties waded in with films including Kidnapped, Sword of Sherwood Forest, The Treasure of Monte Cristo, The Pirates of Blood River, The Spanish Sword, The Scarlet Blade, Siege of the Saxons, The Long Ships, A Challenge for Robin Hood, The Viking Queen and Alfred the Great. Among my personal favourites are the American made The Vikings, The Black Shield of Falworth, The War Lord, El Cid and Ben Hur (my dad was an 'extra' in this film - just saying!) However, I digress! Let's stick to TV series here.\n\nDanzigers' New Elstree Studios - click image for more info at CinemaRetro By the time production of Richard the Lionheart had started, in April of 1961, the Danzigers' Elstree Studios were starting to decline (click image for Elstree Studio information). The final episode of Lionheart was completed in December 1961, as well as another swashbuckler - 'The Spanish Sword' - which used many sets, props, costumes and cast members from the Lionheart series. Despite the likely closure of the studio the Danzigers produced scripts for what would have been their first colour series, the Arabian Nights 'Adventures of Ali Baba', but the project was abandoned when Associated Rediffusion withdrew financial support.\n\nThese were, of course, ITV-transmitted series. The BBC also had its own crop of period 'swashbucklers' but these tended to be more dramatic productions based on 'classic' works, made in the form of (usually six or more) serialised parts and usually transmitted live. These included 'Treasure Island' and 'The Black Arrow' (1951), the aforementioned 'Robin Hood' starring Patrick Troughton (1953), 'Clementina' and 'The Three Musketeers' (1954), 'The Black Tulip' (1956), 'Redgauntlet' (1959), 'The Splendid Spur' (1960), 'Rob Roy' (1961), 'The Count of Monte Cristo' (1964) 'Further Adventures of The Musketeers (1967) and various productions of R.L. Stevenson's classic 'Kidnapped'. On the demise of regular transmission of these shows the genre did not really resurface until ITV produced 'Arthur of The Britons' in 1972. In addition there were some American syndicated series that appeared in some British television regions such as that produced by Kirk Douglas's company, Bryna Productions - 'Tales of The Vikings' - 39x30 minute episodes that were a spin-off from the cinema film. The Buccaneers\n\nA British series set in the port of Nassau in New Providence about 1720. Dan Tempest is a privateer, an ex-pirate who received a pardon from the king after his New Providence stronghold was taken over by the army of The Crown. He and the newly-appointed governor, Lt. Edward Beamish, form a sometimes strained alliance to fight the Spanish privateers raiding in the Caribbean. Robert Shaw was reportedly unavailable for the first few episodes, so filming went ahead without him and he is listed as 'with' rather than 'starring' in a number of the title sequences. The series initially seems to be about Woodes Rogers as he takes the position of Governor to the island of Nassau in the Bahamas. The island is in a chaotic state but Rogers' offer of pardons 'tames' most of the pirate activity. Dan Tempest doesn't really feature until the third episode when Shaw arrives, too late to accept the pardon, and is arrested for piracy.\n\nHe is given a chance to redeem himself by taking a trade ship to Jamaica. During the voyage he encounters Blackbeard, defeating him and winning his pardon, although he continues to really consider himself a pirate. The actual pirate history and nautical activity of the series are well researched and there is a high level of historical accuracy.\n\n39 x 30 minute black and white mono sound episodes were filmed at Nettlefold studios, Walton-on-Thames, and Twickenham film studios, with location work also being carried out at St.Mawes castle (the New Providence fort) and Falmouth in Cornwall where a real schooner (seen as Tempest's ship, 'The Sultana') was based. This ship was also used in the 1950 'Treasure Island' film and the 1956 production of 'Moby Dick'. A section of the ship was accurately reproduced in the studio for close-up scenes.\n\nThe 1956 series was produced by Hannah Weinstein and Sidney Cole for Sapphire Films Limited and ITC entertainment, being networked by CBS in America and seen on ATV and other regional ITV companies at various times. Robert Shaw 'reprised' the role in cinema in 1976 for 'Swashbuckler'.\n\nSeries music was provided by Albert Ems, Edwin Astley (who composed the theme music) and Kenneth V. Jones.

The series is set in 12th Century England, during the reign of King Richard. Robin of Locksley, a nobleman, is forced to become an outlaw, taking occupation in Sherwood Forest and leading a band of men to right the wrongs committed by the rich and powerful against the poor and defenceless. Hood's arch-enemy in the series is the Sheriff of Nottingham who constantly schemes to capture the outlaw by any means possible.\n\nLady Marian Fitzwalter (Maid Marian), a young noblewoman who becomes Robin Hood's lover, keeps him informed of the Sheriff of Nottingham's whereabouts and intentions. The show starred Richard Greene as the legendary outlaw in his constant battle to stay one step ahead of his arch-enemy, played by Alan Wheatley. While some of the episodes dramatise the traditional, well-known Robin Hood tales, most of the episodes were completely new original dramas created by the show's writers and producers.\n\nThe show was commissioned by Lew Grade in 1954 and produced by Hannah Weinstein of Sapphire Films Limited with an initial budget of £10,000 per episode. Weinstein hired many blacklisted American writers to write episodes for the series, including Ring Lardner Jr., Waldo Salt, Robert Lees, and Adrian Scott. Howard Koch, also blacklisted, served for a while as the script editor. These writers were credited under pseudonyms, to avoid attracting the attention of studio executives.\n\nThe series premiered in the UK, via ATV London, on Sunday 25th September with the USA premiere via CBS on the following day. ATV Midlands began showing the series on Friday 17th February 1956 with other regions screening at a later date as they came on-air for the first time in the UK. The episodes had noticeable fade-outs where US commercials were intended to slot in (the series was sponsored in the USA by Johnson & Johnson baby products, Band-Aid and Wildroot hair products).\n\nThe series was broadcast in France as 'Aventures dans la Foret de Sherwood' in 1965 on ORTF.

The series was produced by National Telefilm Associates for ITC, the executive producer being Ralph Smart, who wrote a number of stories for the series and also produced the 'Danger Man' series. In the United States the 39 episodes, made in 3 series, aired on the syndicated NTA Film Network in 1958-1959. The show was subsequently sold throughout the world, even behind the Iron Curtain.\n\nThe series recounts the adventures of a 14th-century Swiss folk hero who wielded a crossbow and encouraged the population of the old Swiss Confederacy to revolt against the occupying forces of Albert of Habsburg. It is loosely based on Johann Von Schiller's tale about William Tell, an Alpine hero from the Swiss settlement of Berglan, who fought at the side of the oppressed people of Altdorf against the occupying Austrians in the early 14th century.\n\nThe first episode sees Tell being challenged by the evil Landburgher Gessler (the hated Austrian local overlord) to display his crossbow marksmanship by shooting an apple off the head of his own son, Walter. Tell accomplishes this feat, but has a second arrow tucked away for Gessler in case his attempt failed. On discovering this fact, Gessler attempts to arrest Tell, who flees to the mountains with son Walter and wife, Hedda.\n\nThe actual splitting of the apple on the head of Tell's son was achieved by trick photography, as revealed by Conrad Phillips: \"We used a very fine taut wire through the apple and lined it up with the shot of the bolt speeding towards him. If we had tried it for real, I think we would have got through a lot of boys . . .\"\n\nStudio scenes were shot at the National Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England with outdoor scenes filmed around the mountains and lakes of Snowdonia in Wales. The film base and make-up facilities were at a small farm in Cwm-Y-Glo , beside the Llyn Padarn lake which can be seen in many shots (as well as cars on the A4086 road on the opposite shore of the lake). Although all three Richard the Lionheart\n\nA British television series of 39x30-minute episodes, directed by Ernest Morris and produced by Danziger Productions Limited for ITV which ran during 1962 and 1963. The title role was played by Irish actor Dermot Walsh and the theme song 'Richard the Lionheart' was written by Bill LeSage.\n\nThe producers claimed that the series was based on fact as far as possible, although little was known of Richard's personal life, leading to the comment \" we have taken some liberties here and there \" by associate producer Brian Taylor in a TV Times article heralding the start of the series. Set in medieval Britain in the 12th century, the series begins with the death of King Henry II and endorses the traditional view of Richard the Lionheart as a hero, with his brother Prince John (superbly played by Trader Faulkner) as the villain.\n\nHistorically, Richard was King of England from 1189 and also ruled as Duke of Normandy, Aquitaine and Gascony, Lord of Cyprus, Count of Poitiers, Anjou, Maine, and Nantes, and was overlord of Brittany at various times during the same period. He was known as Richard Cur de Lion or Richard the Lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior. By the age of 16 he had command of his own army, putting down rebellions in Poitou against his father. He was a central Christian commander during the Third Crusade, scoring considerable victories against the Muslim leader Saladin, although he did not succeed in retaking Jerusalem.\n\nHe was born in England, where he spent his childhood before becoming king, but lived most of his adult life in the southwest of France. Following his accession, he spent very little time, perhaps as little as six months, in England. Most of his life as king was spent on Crusade, in captivity, or actively defending his lands in France. Rather than regarding his kingdom as a responsibility requiring his presence as ruler, he has been perceived as preferring to use it merely as a source of revenue to support his armies. Nevertheless, he was affectionately seen as a pious hero by most of his subjects.

During his absence and imprisonment in Austria, power had been usurped by his younger brother, Prince John, who was bent on stripping the people of their rights and lands. The champion who attempted to thwart John and his allies, right these wrongs, securing justice and help for those in need was the heroic son of a Saxon nobleman knight Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, himself just returned from the Crusades, along with his father-and-son companions Gurth and Bart whom he had freed from servitude.\n\nSwashbuckling adventures were a mainstay of British television programming in the mid-50s. In December 1956 Columbia Pictures contracted Roger Moore to play the title role in a co-production between Columbia subsidiary Screen Gems and British producer Sydney Box (Productions) that was intended for transmission in both the UK and America and the UK. The executive producer was Peter Rogers, who began producing the Carry On films shortly afterwards. The opening and closing themes were written by Edwin Astley, who also wrote the series music in conjunction with Louis Levy and Albert Elms.\n\nFilming started in February 1957, mainly at the ABC Studios at Elstree, Borehamwood and on location around Buckinghamshire in England, but with some filming also taking place in California when the schedule to get the pilot to ABC (who didn't purchase the show) forced the first episode and the opening/closing sequences be filmed at the Columbia Ranch outside Los Angeles.\n\nAlthough the budget was far greater than that of the Robin Hood third series running at the time, only the pilot episode was filmed in colour (shown in black and white). Moore was keen on carrying out much of the stunt work himself, which resulted in injuries that included three cracked ribs from a fight scene and being knocked unconscious when a battleaxe hit his head armour."
