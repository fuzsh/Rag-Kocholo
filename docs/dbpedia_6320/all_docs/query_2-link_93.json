He has quietly spent forty years exploring caves around the world, steadily building his unique skill set as he defied limits, pushed boundaries, and discovered parts of the earth that had never been seen before. Along the way, he and his dive partners became the ones to call for the most challenging cave rescue and recovery missions. In 2018, he found himself on the world’s stage when he and John discovered the Wild Boars alive, trapped inside Thailand’s flooded Tham Luang cave. Rick needed to rely on all the experiences and friendships he’d gathered along the way as he carefully planned and then successfully executed one of the most noteworthy rescue missions on record.\n\nJohn Volanthen\n\nIT CONSULTANT AND CAVE DIVER\n\nJohn Volanthen is a world record-holding British caver and cave diver who has been involved in cave exploration over the last two decades. John began caving with the scouts at the age of 14 and has been at the forefront of cave exploration since combining disciplines of both caving and diving. Where suitable equipment was not available, John has innovated, designed and built breathing and mapping systems to safely explore new ground.\n\nJohn has been involved in a number of cave rescue incidents throughout the world including the Tham Luang Thailand cave rescue for which he was named one of TIME magazine’s “Heroes of the Year.” He lives in Bristol (UK) and runs ultra marathons in his 'spare' time.\n\nJason Mallinson QGM\n\nROPE ACCESS SUPERVISOR AND CAVE DIVER\n\nJason Mallinson is an exploration cave diver with more than 30 years’ experience in underwater caves throughout the world. He learned his trade-craft in the cold murky sumps of North Yorkshire, England in the early 1990s, where side-mount solo cave diving was the norm. From these solid foundations he quickly progressed to more technical cave diving, often requiring dive times of 20 hours or more. This culminated in his leadership of the international dive team to achieve World Record Dive penetration distances in 2010, 2011 and 2013 in Spain.\n\nSearch and Rescue, along with Body Recovery dives are an inevitable extension to cave diving at this experience level. Jason has taken part in numerous body recoveries across Europe, and was also one of the two divers who successfully recovered six people trapped in a flooded cave in Mexico in 2004. This could be described as a practice run for Thailand 14 years later.\n\nHaving been unable to depart with the advance search party to Thailand in 2018, Jason arrived on site once the boys had been found. His experience and sound judgement were required if the boys were ever going to get out of the cave alive.\n\nDr. Richard \"Harry\" Harris\n\nCAVE DIVER\n\nDr. Richard “Harry” Harris SC OAM (Cave Diver) has worked in anaesthesia, diving and aeromedical retrieval medicine in Adelaide, South Australia.\n\nHis passion for cave diving goes back to the 1980’s and has taken him to the corners of the globe in search of new adventures.\n\nHarry and his colleagues have explored caves to 245m depth, and shipwrecks to over 150m, in dives lasting over 16 hours. He is an enthusiastic UW photographer and videographer who is now also building a career in documentary films.\n\nHarry has a professional and voluntary interest in search and rescue operations, establishing the first sump rescue training course in Australasia. By building relationships with emergency services locally he has been preparing for such an event. The 2018 Thailand cave rescue was an opportunity to put this training to work.\n\nIn 2018 he received the Star of Courage, Australia’s second highest civilian award for bravery, and the Medal of the Order of Australia for his role in the Thailand cave rescue.\n\nHarry is the 2019 Australian of the Year for South Australia and the joint 2019 Australian of the Year with his dive partner Craig Challen.\n\nCaptain Mitch Torrel\n\nU.S. AIR FORCE SPECIAL TACTICS OFFICER\n\nCaptain Mitch Torrel ​​is a U.S. Air Force Special Tactics Officer assigned to the 24th Special Operations Wing under Air Force Special Operations Command. In this role Captain Torrel is tasked with leading the Air Force’s special operations ground force in executing global access, precision strike, and personnel recovery operations.

The Tham Luang Cave Rescue was a resounding success, saving the lives of all 13 trapped individuals. In 2019 he was named the Special Tactics of the Year for Air Force Special Operations Command.\n\nPrior to entering into special operations, Captain Torrel was recruited to play Division-1 Hockey at the United States Air Force Academy.
