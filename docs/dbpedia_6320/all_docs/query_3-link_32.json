        "text": "“\n\nI do not see color. I only see crime.\n\n―Blue Hawk to the public.[src]\n\n”\n\nBlue Hawk is a supporting antagonist in Season Three of the Amazon series The Boys. He is a racially biased cop-themed superhero.\n\nThe Boys Series[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\n“\n\nYou and me both trained with Coach Brink at school. We were taught to dominate totally.\n\n―Blue Hawk to A-Train[src]\n\n”\n\nHis early life is unknown; however, it can be assumed that much like the rest of the supes working for Vought International, he was injected with Compound V as a child which in turn, granted him super strength and stamina. It was also revealed during his conversation with A-Train that he attended Godolkin University, a prestigious school for future supes.\n\nHero Career[]\n\nHe would eventually become a fully-fledged superhero, fighting crime under the mantle \"Blue Hawk” and cultivating the image of a superhuman cop who patrolled the streets and exacted justice. Despite this, however, he was actually a bigot and blamed African-Americans for the ongoing crime wave in the United States. Due to these beliefs, he often targeted black criminals and civilians, killing or severely injuring many of them. As a result, he garnered notoriety and infamy due to his actions despite them being covered up by Vought International.\n\nSeven on 7 with Cameron Coleman[]\n\nDuring the December airing of Seven on 7, it was reported that Our Sheet CEO Mickey Londale had announced that Blue Hawk would be the spokesman for Londale's Four Freedom product brand.\n\nCameron Coleman announced Blue Hawk's new reality show, Red, White & Blue Justice, which is available at Vought+.\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nA-Train asks Blue Hawk to apologize to the black community after being told that he killed a black man walking home from work. The man had been suspected of mugging a white woman, and Blue Hawk responded by curb stomping him so hard that it cracked the pavement. He agrees to make a public speech, assuming that it's what Vought wants.\n\nA-Train brings Blue Hawk to a local community center to apologize. He reads a prepared statement in a rushed and bored manner - indicating he didn't believe a word of what he was saying. He also claims not to be racist because he \"doesn’t see color, only sees crime.” He finishes the unenthusiastic reading of his statement by offering to donate $10,000 to the community center.\n\nUnappeased, the crowd confront him about killing an unarmed black man and start screaming at Blue Hawk, who insists that he was defending himself. The community states that he doesn't have a right to use that excuse since he has superpowers, and questions why he only patrols in black neighborhoods. A-Train suggests that Blue Hawk should leave, but he stays to insist that “All Lives Matter” and \"Supe Lives Matter.”\n\nWhen the community begins to shout “Black Lives Matter,” and begins to converge on him, Blue Hawk becomes enraged and starts throwing people around, including Nathan Franklin, resulting in crippling and permanent injuries. In response to this, A-Train grabs Blue Hawk and yells at him to stop. The next day, while on TV, Blue Hawk proudly recounts how he has stood up to Antifa and a few bad apples in his career.\n\nAt the 70th anniversary of Herogasm, Blue Hawk is confronted by A-Train immediately after Soldier Boy unleashed his powers, resulting in several deaths and massive property damage, effectively terminating the event. Determined to avenge his crippled brother, A-Train grabs Blue Hawk by the ankle and begins to drag him along the road at super-speed for several miles, killing him in the process. Blue Hawk's death did not come without consequences, however, as using his powers again caused A-Train to suffer from severe heart failure. A-train's life was saved however, when Blue Hawk's heart was transplanted into A-Train's chest.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nBlue Hawk is like most Supes, being irresponsible and hedonistic. He is also very patriotic and has a short temper, reacting violently with very little provocation.\n\nWhile he claims to not be racist and appears to respect A-Train, Blue Hawk still shows obvious bigotry towards Black people who were not grateful towards him.\n\nDespite his whole gig of being a cop, he doesn't take his job seriously and can be quite lazy, as shown during Herogasm, Annie tells him to evacuate everyone due to Soldier Boy being on his way to take his revenge on the TNT Twins. With him declining, even saying that Homelander told everyone to not worry about Soldier Boy as an excuse. He only takes action after seeing Soldier Boy unleash his radioactive beam at Herogasm.\n\nPowers and Abilities[]\n\nPowers[]\n\n“\n\nBrother lived a few houses up the street. Three kids. He was just walking home from work. Blue Hawk curb-stomped him so hard, it cracked the pavement.\n\n”\n\nSuperhuman Strength: Blue Hawk possesses strength enhanced by Compound V, which is sufficient to punch or throw a fully grown man across a room. He was strong enough to curb-stomp a man with enough force to crack the pavement below.[1] He gravely injured Nathan Franklin, causing severe damage to the thoracic and lumbar regions of his spine, including lacerations to vertebrae T6, T7, T8 and T9; the damage was so severe that Nathan will never walk again.[2]\n\nSuperhuman Durability: Blue Hawk possesses above average human durability as his body is able to handle his own superhuman strength. He was also durable enough to survive the devastating blast that destroyed the 70th annual Herogasm event. He was later able to withstand A-Train choking him and still talk. While A-Train was dragging him through an asphalt road at super speeds, Blue Hawk could be heard screaming throughout a good portion of the whole ordeal, meaning that he managed to withstand the extreme force for a short period of time.[3]\n\n“\n\nIt seemed like you two were on your way to a healing place, which is why you're gonna love this. Blue Hawk will live on because we gave you his heart. A super-abled heart. No more heart disease. You're gonna get to run again.\n\n”\n\nSuperhuman Stamina: According to Ashley Barrett, Blue Hawk's heart is more powerful than that of a regular human, and thus a post-mortem transplant on A-Train allowed him to run as fast as he used to.[4] Blue Hawk could perform superhuman feats without getting tired.\n\nSuperhuman Hearing: Blue Hawk possesses superhuman hearing, allowing him to hear better than humans. Like all Supes, he can hear higher frequencies that humans cannot.[5]\n\nAbilities[]\n\nSkilled Combatant: Blue Hawk was trained by Coach Brink at Godolkin University.[2]\n\nWeaknesses[]\n\nBiological[]\n\nBrute Force/Limited Durability: Despite being more durable than humans, Blue Hawk can still be stunned, knocked unconscious, and killed by extreme force. A-Train kills him by dragging his body along an asphalt road at super speeds for several miles.\n\nHigh Frequencies: Due to being a Supe, Blue Hawk is susceptible to high frequencies. When a high frequency is playing, it can induce immense pain and temporarily neutralize him.\n\nPsychological[]\n\n“\n\nI go where the crime is, and the crime just happens to be in black neighborhoods. That-That's not my fault.\n\n―Blue Hawk[src]\n\n”\n\nShort Temper: Blue Hawk is someone who is very easy to provoke. It only took a few African-Americans criticizing his behavior for him to snap and violently assault them.\n\nBigotry: Though he claims not to be a racist, his bias towards the Black community combined with his short-temper, ultimately caused his downfall when he accidentally crippled A-Train's brother.\n\nEquipment[]\n\nSuper Suit: Like most Supes, Blue Hawk has his own superhero uniform. Its design is similar to that of police uniforms to reinforce Blue Hawk's image as a \"super cop.”\n\nPolice Baton: Blue Hawk carries a police baton as his primary weapon. It is strong enough to withstand his superhuman strength.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nBlue Hawk may be an \"aged up\" version of comic character Five-Oh. Both have a police-like vigilante shtick and hatred for black people, and Blue Hawk is said to have studied at Godolkin University, while Five-Oh is a member of the G-Men in the present. This is comparable to the show's version of Popclaw (a member of the Teenage Kix in the comics and a former member in the show) and Drummer Boy (an adult supe called Supersonic, formerly a teen called Drummer Boy).\n\n[]\n\nBlue Hawk's name may be a play on Blue Falcon, an obscene military slang term for someone who screws over his squadmates.\n\nBlue Hawk may be a parody of Blackhawk, a military-themed superhero from DC Comics.\n\nBlue Hawk may be an analogy for police brutality and vigilante attacks on Black people for wrongly assumed crimes.\n\nHis invocation of \"Supe Lives Matter\" is a reference to the pro-cop counter phrase \"Blue Lives Matter\".\n\nHis uniform resembles riot control gear used by law enforcement against protesters. His nightstick baton and traffic cop helmet reinforces this parallel.\n\nHe constantly invokes \"Self-Defense' to justify his racist murders, which is an argument many perpetrators of police brutality and racially motivated violence use.\n\nHis murders are covered up by Vought despite being comically obvious as racist to the viewers, similar to how some real life racist or despicable murders are covered up by police forces, the media, or powerful organizations such as the government or business, all in which Vought controls in-universe.\n\nHis supe name \"Blue Hawk\" evokes tough-on-crime policies and zero-tolerance practices, since \"Blue\" is also American slang for the police and the term \"Hawk\" is often used to describe someone who is hyper-vigilant and more than willing to use force and violence to achieve their goals, e.g. \"War Hawk\".\n\nBlue Hawk's murder of a black man walking home from work may be an analogy to the death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager who was shot by George Zimmerman February of 2012. Both Zimmerman and Blue Hawk insist they were defending themselves, though there has been considerable doubt raised about these assertions, based upon their behaviors following these incidents, ultimately facing zero legal consequences.\n\nThe way in which A-Train killed Blue Hawk has some resemblance to the death of James Byrd Jr, a black man who was murdered by three white men on June 7, 1998 in Jasper, Texas. Two of his murderers were avowed white supremacists.\n\nHis death may also be a reference to Kabal's \"Road Rash\" fatality in Mortal Kombat 11.\n\nWhilst it may be a coincidence, the manner of death also relates to the title of the 2018 Cop/Crime Drama Dragged Across Concrete. The film centers around two old-fashioned police officers who are suspended after committing police brutality on a Latino man."
