        "text": "Our 2024 summer movie preview features the biggest blockbusters to put on your watchlist this summer, including three filmed in Massachusetts.\n\nSummer doesn’t start for another month, but the movie world operates on a different calendar. To Hollywood, summer runs from May to August, which means that our 2024 summer movie preview doesn’t include a couple of the season’s already-released blockbusters, like Ryan Gosling’s “The Fall Guy” and the latest “Planet of the Apes” sequel.\n\nAfter the seismic cultural moment of Barbenheimer last year, it’s hard to say whether the 2024 summer movie season will live up to its predecessor. Analysts were disappointed by the tepid box office receipts for “The Fall Guy,” which, for the record, is quite an enjoyable film. But “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes” beat expectations in its opening weekend, and there are still plenty of buzzworthy films that will compete for moviegoers’ attention.\n\nBelow, you’ll find info about 24 of the biggest summer movie releases, including two animated movies starring Steve Carell, a new Boston-filmed crime drama from Matt Damon and Casey Affleck, and — for the first time in a while — only one Marvel movie.\n\nHere are 24 must-see movies coming to theaters or streaming services from now through the end of August.\n\n(Movie release dates are theatrical unless otherwise noted.)\n\n“IF” (May 17)\n\nStarring: Cailey Fleming, Ryan Reynolds, John Krasinski, Fiona Shaw, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Louis Gossett Jr., Steve Carell\n\nNewton native John Krasinski enlisted his old pal from “The Office” for this animated tale about a girl who discovers she can see everyone’s imaginary friends. Carell plays Blue, one of the imaginary friends, as does Phoebe Waller-Bridge (“Fleabag”). “IF” has left some reviewers divided, and has been labeled a big swing for Krasinski that doesn’t hew to the traditional kiddie movie formula. “IF” lands in theaters May 17.\n\nWatch the trailer for “IF”\n\n“Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” (May 24)\n\nStarring: Anya Taylor-Joy, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Burke, Alyla Browne.\n\n“Mad Max: Fury Road” wasn’t just the best action movie of the last 15 years, it was one of the best movies of the decade, full stop. Suffice to say that director George Miller has a lot to live up to with this prequel starring Anya Taylor-Joy (“The Queen’s Gambit”) as Furiosa, the hardened commander played by Charlize Theron in “Fury Road.” Kidnapped from the Green Place of Many Mothers, a young Furiosa is snatched up by the warlord Dementus (Chris Hemsworth, “Thor”) and his savage biker gang. During their pillaging and plundering across the Wasteland, they encounter the Citadel, and begin to do battle with its commander, Immortan Joe. “As the two tyrants fight for dominance, Furiosa soon finds herself in a nonstop battle to make her way home. “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga” rides into theaters May 24.\n\nWatch the trailer for “Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga”\n\n“Hit Man” (May 24 in theaters, June 7 on Netflix)\n\nStarring: Glenn Powell, Adria Arjona\n\nLoosely based on a true story, director Richard Linklater’s neo-noir stars Glen Powell (“Top Gun: Maverick”) as Gary Johnson, a buttoned-up professor who discovers he has a strange talent for portraying a fake hit man — a talent Gary puts to use moonlighting for the New Orleans Police Department. When he meets an alluring woman (Adria Arjona, “Andor”) while in his hit man persona, the fun and games take a deadly turn. Part comedy, part thriller, “Hit Man” shoots into theaters May 24 before landing on Netflix on June 7.\n\nWatch the trailer for “Hit Man”\n\n“Inside Out 2” (June 14)\n\nStarring: Amy Poehler, Maya Hawke, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Tony Hale, Liza Lapira, Ayo Edebiri, Paul Walter Hauser\n\nAlmost a decade after “Inside Out,” Pixar is back with a whole new cast of emotions. Burlington native Amy Poehler (“Saturday Night Live”) is back as Joy, the de facto lead Emotion inside the head of Riley. But whereas last film was about the dawning of complex emotions, Riley is a full-blown teenager in “Inside Out 2,” which means new Emotions like Envy (Dorchester native Ayo Edebiri, “The Bear”), Anxiety (Maya Hawke, “Stranger Things”), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser, “Black Bird”) have joined the party. “Inside Out” lands in theaters June 14.\n\nWatch the trailer for “Inside Out 2”\n\n“Bad Boys: Ride or Die” (June 14)\n\nStarring: Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, Vanessa Hudgens, Tiffany Haddish, Joe Pantoliano\n\nYou may not have realized it, but “Bad Boys For Life” was the top-grossing movie at the pandemic-stunted U.S. box office in 2020. That was enough to greenlight this fourth installment, which reunites everyone’s favorite Miami PD detectives Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence). When Mike and Marcus attempt to investigate corruption in the department, they are set up as fall guys, and must prove their innocence while on the run. are now on the run after attempting to expose corruption in the department. Luckily they’ve got help from friends in Advanced Miami Metro Operations (AMMO) played by Vanessa Hudgens (“High School Musical”) and Alexander Ludwig (“Vikings”). “Bad Boys: Ride or Die” rolls into theaters June 14.\n\nWatch the trailer for “Bad Boys: Ride or Die”\n\n“Janet Planet” (June 21)\n\nStarring: Juliane Nicholson, Zoe Ziegler\n\nPulitzer Prize-winning playwright Annie Baker filmed her big-screen directorial debut in Western Massachusetts last year, where this coming-of-age title is set. Introverted 11-year-old Lacy (Zoe Ziegler) spends the summer of 1991 daydreaming and hanging out with her mom, Janet (Julianne Nicholson, “Dream Scenario”). When Janet begins to enter and exit a series of relationships, Lacy goes through the painful process of seeing her mother as a fully-formed human being, warts and all. Following a warm local premiere at IFF Boston earlier this month, “Janet Planet” strolls into theaters June 21.\n\nWatch the trailer for “Janet Planet”\n\n“The Bikeriders” (June 21)\n\nStarring: Austin Butler, Jodie Comer, Tom Hardy, Michael Shannon, Mike Faist\n\nInspired by photojournalist Danny Lyon’s 1968 book, “The Bikeriders” captures 10 years of tumult in America, when the culture and people were changing, regardless of what group or class they belonged to. After a chance encounter at a local bar, Kathy (Jodie Comer, “Killing Eve”) falls for Benny (Austin Butler, “Elvis”), a fresh-faced member of motorcycle club The Vandals. As the ’60s roll on and the Vandals become more deeply enmeshed in a cycle of violence and danger, Benny must choose between Kathy and his club, led by the magnetic Johnny (Tom Hardy, “Inception”). “The Bikeriders” cruises into theaters June 21.\n\nWatch the trailer for “The Bikeriders”\n\n“Kinds of Kindness” (June 21)\n\nStarring: Emma Stone, Jesse Plemons, Willem Dafoe, Margaret Qualley, Hong Chau, Joe Alwyn\n\nFor his first film since the Oscar-winning “Poor Things,” director Yorgos Lanthimos has brought back three actors from that film in Emma Stone, Willem Dafoe, and Margaret Qualley. Described as a “triptych fable,” “Kinds of Kindness” follows three connected stories: “a man without choice who tries to take control of his own life; a policeman who is alarmed that his wife who was missing-at-sea has returned and seems a different person; and a woman determined to find a specific someone with a special ability, who is destined to become a prodigious spiritual leader.” Also featuring Jesse Plemons (“Breaking Bad”) and Hong Chau (“The Whale”), “Kinds of Kindness” hits theaters June 21.\n\nWatch the trailer for “Kinds of Kindness”\n\n“A Quiet Place: Day One” (June 28)\n\nStarring: Lupita Nyong’o, Joseph Quinn, Alex Wolff, Djimon Hounsou\n\nThe more films there are in the “Quiet Place” universe, the less we see of John Krasinski. The first one starred the Newton native as patriarch Lee Abbott, the second one was directed by him (and featured him a brief cameo), and the third one is only produced by him. Gone too is the Abbott family, with the focus of the story now on Sam (Lupita Nyong’o, “Black Panther”), a woman in New York City who must fight to survive in the early days post-invasion of the sound-sensitive aliens. The lone holdover from earlier in the series is Djimon Hounsou (“Guardians of the Galaxy”), who has gone from being an unnamed man in “A Quiet Place Part II” to a man with a name — Henri. Since this is a prequel, we can’t rule out a cameo from Krasinski or wife Emily Blunt just yet. “A Quiet Place: Day One” sneaks into theaters June 28.\n\nWatch the trailer for “A Quiet Place: Day One”\n\n“Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” (July 3 on Netflix)\n\nStarring: Eddie Murphy, Taylour Paige, Judge Reinhold, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, John Ashton\n\nForty years after Eddie Murphy first hit the streets as Detective Axel Foley in “Beverly Hills Cop,” the actor is back on the beat in Southern California. After the life of his daughter (Taylour Paige, “Zola”) is threatened, she and Axel team up with a new partner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt, “Inception”) as well as old friends Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton) to solve the mystery. “Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F” will head straight to Netflix, making its streaming debut July 3.\n\nWatch the trailer for “Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F”\n\n“Despicable Me 4” (July 3)\n\nStarring: Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Will Ferrell, Sofia Vergara, Stephen Colbert, Miranda Cosgrove, Chloe Fineman, Steve Coogan\n\nOther than “Deadpool & Wolverine,” the movie most likely to break a billion dollars at the worldwide box office this summer is probably this sixth installment in what’s known as the “Despicable Me” franchise but would more accurately be called the Minionverse. Beloved supervillain turned Anti-Villain agent Gru (Steve Carell) — already a family man thanks to Lucy (Kristen Wiig) and their three adopted girls — welcome a new baby, Gru Jr., to the family. Gru Jr. is quite a handful, as is new villain Maxime Le Mal (Will Ferrell), who forces Gru and co. on the run. Also featuring Sofia Vergara (“Modern Family”), Stephen Colbert (“The Late Show with Stephen Colbert”) and Chloe Fineman (“Saturday Night Live”), “Despicable Me 4” bounces into theaters July 3.\n\nWatch the trailer for “Despicable Me 4”\n\n“Longlegs” (July 12)\n\nStarring: Maika Monroe, Nicolas Cage, Alicia Witt, Blair Underwood\n\nMid-major studio Neon has been building selective hype for its horror movie “Longlegs,” releasing purposely vague trailers that only hint at the horror contained within. The film focuses on rookie FBI agent Lee Harker (Maika Monroe, “It Follows”) assigned to solve the case of a serial killer (Nicolas Cage) with a seeming connection to the occult. After Harker unwittingly discovers a personal link to the killer, she must move fast to prevent a tragedy that could hit close to home. Co-starring Worcester native Alicia Witt (“Cybill”) and Blair Underwood (“L.A. Law”), “Longlegs” crawls into theaters July 12.\n\n“Twisters” (July 19)\n\nStarring: Daisy Edgar-Jones, Glen Powell, Anthony Ramos, Maura Tierney, Brandon Perea, Daryl McCormack, Sasha Lane, Kiernan Shipka\n\nNearly 30 years after the original, “Twisters” joins present-day stormchasers as they try to predict — and maybe even tame? — deadly tornadoes. Like the 1996 film starring Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt, “Twisters” features rival groups of stormchasers, with Daisy Edgar-Jones (“Where the Crawdads Sing”) and Glen Powell (“Top Gun: Maverick”) representing the primary head-butters. Also featuring Anthony Ramos (“In the Heights”), Maura Tierney (“The Affair”), and Kiernan Shipka (“Mad Men,”) “Twisters” blows into theaters July 19.\n\n“Deadpool and Wolverine” (July 26)\n\nStarring: Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, Emma Corrin, Rob Delaney, Matthew Macfadyen\n\nThere’s only one Marvel movie coming to theaters this summer, so Disney is making sure to puts its best foot forward by adding Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to the mix in the third installment of its popular “Deadpool” franchise. The snarkiest, most sarcastic member of the X-Men is recovering from injuries when he is paired with another loudmouth in Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) by The Time Variance Authority (TVA), a “bureaucratic organization that exists outside of time and space.” Together, the wisecracking duo team up to defeat a common enemy that hasn’t been revealed but has the potential to “change the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU),” according to a studio synopsis. Co-starring Emma Corrin (“The Crown”), Marblehead native Rob Delaney (“Catastrophe”) and Matthew Macfadyen (“Succession”), “Deadpool & Wolverine” slashes into theaters July 26.\n\nWatch the trailer for “Deadpool & Wolverine”\n\n“The Instigators” (August 2 in theaters, August 9 on Apple TV+)\n\nStarring: Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Hong Chau, Paul Walter Hauser, Michael Stuhlbarg, Ving Rhames, Alfred Molina, Ron Perlman, Jack Harlow\n\nChildhood pals Matt Damon and Casey Affleck returned to their old stomping grounds for this Apple Studios crime drama, which was filmed in the Boston area in 2023. Desperate father Rory (Damon) and ex-con Cobby (Affleck) reluctantly team up to rob a corrupt politician. When the heist goes sideways, the pair go on the run with the help of Rory’s therapist (Hong Chau, “The Whale”), dodging ill-tempered crime bosses and crooked bureaucrats. Co-starring Michael Stuhlbarg, Paul Walter Hauser (“Black Bird”), Ving Rhames (“Mission: Impossible”), Alfred Molina (“Spider-Man 2”), “The Instigators” drives into theaters August 2 for a limited run before landing on Apple TV+ August 9.\n\n“Trap” (August 9)\n\nStarring: Josh Hartnett, Alison Pill, Hayley Mills\n\nWatching the trailer for “Trap,” the newest movie from twist maestro M. Night Shyamalan (“The Sixth Sense”), it feels like the big reveal has been broadcast loud and clear. Josh Hartnett plays a father who takes his daughter to a concert for her favorite singer, Lady Raven. But it turns out that the concert is an elaborate sting to catch a serial killer called The Butcher, who is (gasp!) Hartnett. Rest assured there will be more twists on this intriguing premise, which stars Shyamalan’s daughter, Saleka, as the R&B singer. “Trap” lands in theaters August 9.\n\n“Borderlands” (August 9)\n\nStarring: Cate Blanchett, Kevin Hart, Jamie Lee Curtis, Jack Black, Ariana Greenblatt, Florian Munteanu\n\nAfter decades of incredibly poor movie adaptations of popular video games, TV shows like “Fallout” and “The Last of Us” have shown that it’s possible to tell a compelling story that originated in a video game — at least in episodic form, anyway. The jury is out on this adaptation of the “Borderlands” video game series directed by Newton native Eli Roth (“Hostel”), which wrapped nearly three years ago and then sat on the shelf. Cate Blanchett (“TAR”) plays bounty hunter Lilith, who returns to her home planet Pandora in search of a powerful despot’s daughter. To finish the job, she teams up with miscreants played by Kevin Hart, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ariana Greenblatt (“Barbie”), Florian Munteanu (“Creed III”), and a robot voiced by Jack Black. Borderlands lands in theaters August 9.\n\nWatch the trailer for “Borderlands”\n\n“It Ends with Us” (August 9)\n\nStarring: Blake Lively, Justin Baldoni, Jenny Slate, Hasan Minhaj\n\nGiven that her romance with husband Ryan Reynolds bloomed in Boston, it’s fitting that Blake Lively (“Gossip Girl”) stars in this Boston-set romance based on Colleen Hoover’s novel of the same name. Lily (Lively) settles in Boston hoping to leave a traumatic childhood and abusive father behind. There, shee meets Ryle (Baldoni), a charming neurosurgeon who harbors a dark side. When her childhood crush Atlas (Brandon Sklenar, “1923”) resurfaces, Lily “realizes she must learn to rely on her own strength to make an impossible choice for her future,” according to a studio synopsis. Co-starring comedian Hasan Minhaj and Milton native Jenny Slate (“Parks & Recreation”), “It Ends with Us” hits theaters August 9.\n\nWatch the trailer for “It Ends with Us”\n\n“The Union” (August 16 on Netflix)\n\nStarring: Mark Wahlberg, Halle Berry, Mike Colter, Jackie Earle Haley, J.K. Simmons\n\nMark Wahlberg is combining two of his favorite types of roles into one in Netflix’s upcoming film “The Union.” Wahlberg plays Mike (Mark Wahlberg), a “down-to-earth construction worker” who is thrown into “the world of super spies and secret agents” when his higschool girlfriend Roxanne (Halle Berry, “X-Men”) recruits him for a secret U.S. intelligence mission. Co-starring Jackie Earle Haley (“Watchmen”) and J.K. Simmons (“Whiplash”), “The Union” begins streaming on Netflix August 16.\n\n“Alien: Romulus” (August 16)\n\nStarring: Cailee Spaeny, David Johnsson, Archie Renaux, Isabela Merced\n\nFor the seventh film in the “Alien” franchise, director Fede Álvarez (“Evil Dead”) is taking the series back to its roots with a young, unheralded cast. Set between the events of 1979’s “Alien” and 1986’s “Aliens,” “Alien: Romulus” joins a team of space colonizers scavenging an abandoned space station. If you’ve seen an “Alien” movie, you can probable guess what they find next. Co-starring Cailee Spaeny (“Priscilla”), David Johnsson (“Industry”), Archie Renaux (“Shadow and Bone”), and Isabela Merced (“Instant Family”), “Alien: Romulus” lands in theaters August 16.\n\nWatch the trailer for “Alien: Romulus”\n\n“Blink Twice” (August 23)\n\nStarring: Naomi Ackie, Channing Tatum, Christian Slater, Simon Rex, Adria Arjona, Kyle MacLachlan, Geena Davis, Alia Shawkat\n\nIn what feels like a twist on the recent “Knives Out” sequel, a cocktail waitress (Naomi Acke) has a chance encounters with tech billionaire Slater King (Channing Tatum), who invites her to his private island for a dream vacation. But something is amiss, and as the days begin to blend together, Frida begins to question her sanity.

There are now three generations of Deetz women: Delia (Catherine O’Hara, “Home Alone”), daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder, “Stranger Things”), and granddaughter/newcomer Astrid (Jenna Ortega, “Wednesday”) gather at the family home for a funeral. When Astrid ventures up to the attic, she unwittingly opens a portal to the Afterlife, heralding the mischevious demon’s return. Also featuring Justin Theroux (“The Leftovers”), Monica Bellucci (“The Matrix Reloaded”) and Willem Dafoe (“Poor Things”), “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice” will be summoned to theaters Sept. 6."
