        "text": "Peter Berg is a veteran of showcasing high school football onscreen, but Friday Night Lights could never have prepared him for his new docuseries, Boys in Blue.\n\nOver his 25 years as a filmmaker, Berg has done a little bit of everything, from blowing up battleships in Battleship to helping launch the big-screen career of Dwayne Johnson. And still, he’s best known for two things: adapting his cousin Buzz Bissinger’s popular nonfiction book Friday Night Lights into a well-received movie and then a beloved TV series, and turning real-life tragedies into Mark Wahlberg films (Lone Survivor, Deepwater Horizon, and Patriots Day). For his new Showtime docuseries, Berg combined the football storytelling he’s become known for with nonfiction subject matter.\n\nSet in North Minneapolis in the wake of George Floyd’s murder at the hands of police officer Derek Chauvin, Boys in Blue follows the North Community High School football team during the 2021–22 season. The debut episode introduces the mostly Black student-athletes and the men mentoring and coaching them, revealing in the final moments that the coaches are members of the Minneapolis Police Department. Over four installments, Berg explores North’s pursuit of a championship, all while the team searches for common ground and deals with the ongoing violence and civil unrest in their community. In the final episode, the theme of violence and the danger in existing as a Black person becomes even less abstract, in the most devastating way possible.\n\n“We can help shine a different light on some of these issues—cops, urban cities, sports, family, economic levels of society—and create an opportunity for people to maybe have a slightly more empathetic vision,” Berg tells Vanity Fair. “We’re certainly not creating a piece of ‘copaganda,’ which is a phrase I get a lot. We’re not saying cops are good. We’re not saying cops are bad, either. We’re saying, ‘Look at the man, look at the woman, and make a decision based upon that.’ You see in Boys in Blue what community policing really is, and it’s pretty hard to not say, ‘Well, yeah, that’s something we should do.’ Cops should know and live in the communities that they’re policing—it changes everything. Everything.”\n\nAhead of Boys in Blue’s premiere, we went deep with Berg on facing unexpected tragedy during filming, feeling extra responsibility to this project and its subjects, and opting out of light content in favor of “going back into the fire.”\n\nVanity Fair: Let’s start with the origin story of Boys in Blue. How did you come to this team and this project?\n\nPeter Berg: I went to Macalester College in Saint Paul, so the Twin Cities have always held a special place in my heart. When George Floyd happened, I was horrified, and sort of extra confused, because such a vicious act of violence didn’t line up with the Twin Cities that I remembered. I was very impacted by that experience, and I wanted to have some creative response to the Floyd killing. I’ve done work with law enforcement in the past; I had people who I knew that were in law enforcement asking me to participate, to be a voice that, perhaps, presented a different side of law enforcement. There was so much vitriol and animosity towards law enforcement, across all lines, which I was cognizant of and felt some of was deserved.\n\nI read an article in The New York Times about a high school football program, Minneapolis North High School, which is the community where George Floyd was killed. This very good high school football team that consistently played for the state championship was coached by Minneapolis police officers, Black and white, some of whom worked with Derek Chauvin. And the article presented this community, living in the middle of ground zero of this issue, that was just trying to survive. And it was clearly a positive relationship between these kids and these coaches, this community and these coaches/cops; something special seemed to be happening there. So that article prompted me to get on a plane, fly out there, meet the team, meet the coaches, and meet the families.\n\nYou went on a three-film run where you were retelling these heavy, true stories on the big screen. This being a docuseries with real people, not actors, how did the approach or experience change?\n\nHave you seen all four episodes yet?\n\nNo, I got the first two.\n\nSo you don’t know what happens in the fourth episode, do you?\n\nI don’t.\n\nI’ll tell you, because it’s not a secret. So yes, I’ve done films that involve people dying: Lone Survivor, Patriots Day, Deepwater Horizon. In all three of those films, there’s definitely a huge responsibility to acknowledge the fact that these people have families, friends, children, and they are going to see these, and so we have a responsibility to be accurate in how we present them. Having dealt with real-life death in film, I was cognizant that we were going into a real world where this was not a joke for these folks—this is their lives. And we had to be extra mindful and respectful of that. Two days after we stopped shooting, and a week after the state championship, Deshaun Hill—you know, the quarterback?\n\nYeah, it was hard not to be drawn to him.\n\nHe was walking out of school, bumped into a kid. The kid pulls out his gun, shot him in the head, and murdered him.\n\nJesus.\n\nThat happened while we were filming. Our star was murdered. And it was, without question, the heaviest and most intense thing that I’ve ever experienced as a filmmaker. It was mind-boggling, it was gut-wrenching, and it really happened. In the fourth episode, we filmed him out on a date with his girlfriend, 30 hours before he was murdered. The first episode opens with Deshaun and his family, and his mother talking about all she wants is for him to get out alive so he can get to college, and how much fear she has that he’s going to get attacked leaving school and going to the bus. And that’s exactly what happened to him. It’s not something that I am qualified to contextualize. I can’t say what it means, other than people are suffering in this country. The threat is real. Violence is a very real thing and a reality for so many communities. And that hit us like a freight train when Deshaun Hill got killed.\n\nSo to answer your question, yes, this has become a bigger responsibility and something I feel more personally passionate about, telling this story. You read and think, Mm, well, that’s horrible, but I guess it has no impact upon me. It is happening. Killings like the Deshaun Hill killing are happening every day in this country. We don’t hear about them, we don’t want to think about them, but they’re absolutely real. And we found that out big time while we were living with this community.\n\nAs a filmmaker, as a human, when you hear that news, what’s the instant reaction in regard to how to proceed? I have to imagine there was a balance of, “We have to continue to document this,” with, “Do we need to give these people and this tragedy some space?”\n\nThe thought process was that this is part of the story. We set out to experience eight months in this community’s life, and Deshaun Hill was killed within that period of time. And it is confusing, painful, and nonsensical. This was a kid that was an honor roll student, didn’t do any drugs, didn’t run around with gangs, had zero criminal connection, and was literally just leaving school and bumped into the wrong guy and was murdered. I don’t know how to make sense of that; it is what it is and it hurts. And we felt the only course of action was to tell that story. All throughout the season, we were part of people talking about the violence in the community, the fear that violence is going to hit them, their issues with policing, and, at the end, we felt it firsthand.\n\nAll we could really do as filmmakers was finish telling the story, show the film to the family and the community, talk to them about it, gauge their reaction to it, make sure that we feel like we’re doing everything we can to not cross a line. And we got, very strongly, the support of that family and the coaches: “Yes, we want Deshaun Hill to be honored and remembered in this way. And yes, this is what it’s like for us every single day living in this community.”\n\nThroughout this endeavor, how conscious did you have to be that you are a white man entering this predominantly Black community and telling the stories of young Black men? In your mind, did you feel like you needed to start by earning the trust of those you were showcasing?\n\nI feel that I have to earn the trust of anyone that I make a film about. I’ve made a lot of documentaries, and I’m finishing up a documentary I made on Rihanna for the last six years. I’ve made documentaries about football players and military service members, and I’ve made a lot of films about real people: straight, gay, Black, white, Asian, Hispanic—I’ve cast a pretty broad net. Yes, I am a white filmmaker, and this is primarily a Black community, and I went in with the same curiosity and sensitivity and respect that I will go into any community with. When I set out to tell a story, I do absolutely everything I can to come honest and straight and unbiased and say, “Look, this is who I am, this is what I look like. I’m interested in trying to learn about your community and to capture it. If you don’t want me, I understand. If you do, I will give you everything that I have.”\n\nWhat was it like to be on the streets of Minneapolis, where George Floyd was brutally murdered, and talking to both these coaches and police officers, some of whom worked with Derek Chauvin, and to these kids, who openly admit their fear and dislike of the police? In those conversations, was there anything that you really carried with you or were surprised by?\n\nI often find that whenever you go deep, deep into any community, whether it’s a football team, church, used-car dealership, military platoon, and you think that you know something—Well, it’s going to be like this—it never is. It’s always so much more complex and nuanced. And yes, there wasn’t a soul that I met that didn’t think that Derek Chauvin was a barbaric savage who deserved everything he got—if not more—and that what happened was fucking awful. After you move off of that, it’s very hard to categorize in terms of the stereotypes.\n\nOne of the things we captured was Proposition 2, which was, straight up, shut the Minneapolis Police Department down, and it went to a massive vote. And what became very apparent was the Minneapolis North community, which is primarily a Black community, were completely against the idea of defunding the police. They wanted more police, good police, community-oriented police. And what we found were some of the wealthier white suburbs outside of Minneapolis, who thought they were doing the right thing, were saying, “Yeah, abolish the police,” and that was interesting. There’s a town hall meeting where this all comes to a head and you see members of the Minneapolis North community saying, “Don’t tell us what’s best for us, let us tell you what’s best for us. If you think you’re doing us a favor because you have guilt over the fact that you’re rich and white, you might not be doing us a favor.” I wouldn’t have necessarily thought that would happen that way. And the vote failed and the police force wasn’t defunded. But we love to draw conclusions; nothing was what you might imagine it would be if what you do is watch sound bites on MSNBC, Fox, CNN. People are much more complicated and much, much more intelligent than we give them credit for.\n\nThanks to Friday Night Lights, the show and the movie, you’ve become pretty tied to high school football in pop culture. Were you always interested in returning to this world?\n\nNot really. It started for me when I read my cousin Buzz Bissinger’s book Friday Night Lights, and I just thought it was a great book, and then he started pressuring me to make the film. And once I went down to Texas, doing my research to write the screenplay, I quickly realized that high school sports are this incredibly unique inflection point where there’s still so much innocence and genuine love of the game, with pretty sophisticated athletic skill, that’s all wrapped up in family, community, church, school, love, death—it’s all there. To me, it’s this endlessly fascinating energy source that just propels so many compelling stories. And when I read that article about this high school football program coached by Minneapolis cops in the community where George Floyd died, I couldn’t turn my back on that one. But, for now, today, I’m done with high school football. [Laughs] Check in with me in a month.\n\nWe last talked back in 2018, just ahead of Mile 22’s release, and you mentioned how that film—and subsequently Spenser Confidential—came out of your need to take a break from the heaviness of working on the likes of Lone Survivor and Patriots Day. Is that still something you try to weigh in what you pursue? Like, knowing that you’re interested in telling these real stories, but also acknowledging that you need some lighter fun every now and then?\n\nThe last thing I did, which comes out in a couple months, is a six-part show on Richard Sackler, called Painkiller, and it’s real. I’m getting ready to do a new series called American Primeval that’s about the Mormon War in 1857, that’s real. At the end of the day, as much fun as I had making Spenser Confidential and Mile 22, I feel like I’m going to stick with shows that are more grounded in something real. And I did need a break from the gravitas of those three films, Lone Survivor, Patriots Day, and Deepwater Horizon. I’ve had my break, and I’m going back into the fire.\n\nAnd look, when I started filming that football program, I expected to find some emotion and to really touch the human experience—I never expected for Deshaun Hill to be murdered. Not in my wildest, wildest dreams could I ever imagine anything that horrific happening. And I don’t know, for me, the silver lining is that we were there to capture this man’s life.\n\nBoth Painkiller and American Primeval star Taylor Kitsch, whom you previously worked with on Friday Night Lights, Battleship, and Lone Survivor. I’ve enjoyed watching the evolution of his career over the last few years, with unexpected turns in things like True Detective and Waco. It seems like he’s finding the groove of who he is as an actor. What’s it been like forming this close creative partnership with him, and why has he become someone whom you’re now building projects around?\n\nHe’s terrific, and he really cares. I’ve known him forever, since Friday Night Lights, and, like Mark Wahlberg, if I’m comfortable with someone, I tend to stay for a while, for a variety of reasons. I like to go to work knowing that I understand someone’s brain a bit. I think that Kitsch is a really sophisticated actor who came out of the barrel real fast, got some big breaks and things that didn’t work out. And I was part of that with Battleship, which I’m still proud of, but I recognize it didn’t quite move his career forward. And he hit a few speed bumps but really stayed true to himself and has worked on his craft. And I think, starting with the David Koresh story [Waco], really let everyone know that he is more than just a pretty face; he really cares. And the level of work that he’s been doing the last several years, including what he does in Painkiller, is extraordinary. So he’s going to be the anchor of American Primeval, and he’s playing a savage, barbaric man, and I think he’s going to be wonderful.\n\nDo we have to worry about Wahlberg getting jealous?\n\nI mean, I don’t think so. You have to ask him. Mark and I have an open relationship. [Laughs]\n\nSpeaking of your A-list collaborators, what is the update on your Rihanna documentary?\n\nWhen Rihanna called and asked me if I wanted to make a documentary on her, I was like, “Are you kidding? You want me? I do movies about soldiers and oil rigs and football players.” I’ve worked with her and I’m friends with her, and she’s like, \"No, I want you,” and goes, “I don’t know when it will end.” So we’ve had a few starts and stops. It’s done, it could come out tomorrow, but she keeps having big milestones, like a child, now the Super Bowl, a new tour. But it’s fun because it’s like we just keep revisiting it, and to be able to actually tell this story of not just her life, but to be filming her in real time over the last seven years and watch someone grow and mature, and the entire launch of so many of her businesses have all happened while we were there; she’s become a mother while we were there. It’s kind of cool to have something that exists in more of a long chunk of time; I think it makes for a more interesting piece of art. So we’ll see when it comes out.\n\nYou’ve already done so many different things in your career, but is there a Holy Grail project? Or do you not think in those terms?\n\nI never know; I start putting my eye on something. I think Buzz Bissinger has just surpassed Friday Night Lights and has this crown jewel book, The Mosquito Bowl, that has football in it, but it’s about an incredibly complex, violent, heroic time in American history around the Battle of Guadalcanal with the Marine Corps. It’s something I’ve had my eye on for a while.\n\nIt worked out pretty well the last time you adapted one of Buzz’s books! Thanks for having such a thoughtful conversation with me about the show, which I’m now very nervous and anxious to finish, considering where it’s headed.\n\nTrust me, watch. It will knock you over. When I got the call [that] Deshaun Hill was killed, I literally couldn’t talk for a good two minutes. I said, “I’ll call you back,” and hung up. And then the producer called and said, “What are we going to do? What does this mean?” I said, “I don’t know, but we keep going. We will continue to do our best to tell this story.” And I think that’s so true whenever a young person dies: Other than turning to God and religion, how do you make sense of it? It’s really hard."
