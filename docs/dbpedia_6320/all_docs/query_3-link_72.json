        "text": "Since 2018, Netflix has been home to the adaptation of Jenny Han’s To All the Boys trilogy. On February 12, the third movie, To All the Boys: Always and Forever, premiered, signaling the end of Lara Jean's story. That’s it. There aren’t any other books. It’s time for college, late nights, coffee addictions, and more chaotic dating!\n\n“I think we’ve watched Lara Jean and myself grow up through these movies and I'm proud of the way that we end with her,” actress Lana Condor told Entertainment Tonight last year. “I’m hopeful for her future. I see a bright future for her, and I know that she’s gonna go off and occupy her space and do the things that she loves. Particularly in the third movie, you see a lot of personal growth from Lara Jean.”\n\nShe went on: “It’s not about, oh, is she gonna pick a guy and all the love triangles…which are great. But I think we also need to focus on who she is as a young woman and what she’s gonna do with her future. She's going off to college and everything, so it does feel like a proper ending.”\n\nNoah Centineo as Peter Kavinsky and Lana Condor as Lara Jean Covey in To All the Boys: Always and Forever\n\nIt does seem like things really are ending for our favorite high-school/Gen Z heroine. But… If the people want a fourth To All the Boys movie, will they get a fourth To All the Boys movie?\n\nRight now, the answer is no.\n\nRemember, this is a trilogy. Three books means only three movies. In an interview with Book Riot in 2018, Han confirmed that Lara Jean’s story (at least on the page) is likely over.\n\n“ It’s a trilogy,” she said. “I think this is where I leave Lara Jean. In my mind, these characters are still out there doing their thing, but I’m no longer there to watch it happen. I don’t think it’s the end of her story. I just think it's the end of me being there for it.”\n\nJanel Parrish as Margot, Anna Cathcart as Kitty Covey, and Lana Condor as Lara Jean Covey in To All the Boys: Always and Forever.\n\nBut we could get a spinoff.\n\nAbout Kitty! Deadline reported in March that Netflix is developing a television spinoff of the To All the Boys movies centered on Lara Jean’s younger sister, Kitty (Anna Cathcart). “I hear the untitled half-hour romantic comedy series project, now in early development, would follow Kitty, the youngest of the Covey sisters, on her quest to find true love,” the report states. Han is even co-writing the pilot.\n\nAnd Condor is completely on board. “I think it would totally make sense,” she told Entertainment Tonight. “I think Kitty is... truly just a scene stealer.”\n\nCondor and Noah Centineo joked about making another movie.\n\nIn an interview with ELLE.com, the To All the Boys stars joked about meeting Lara Jean and Peter down the road—like, 20 years down the road. “Noah and I have talked about this,” Condor explained. “I have this vision [that] Peter just breaks. He has a full mental, physical breakdown. He is like, truly, who am I?”\n\nAnd Jenny Han has also given us (a small) reason to hope.\n\nLast year, Centineo told Variety he'd make a fourth movie if Han wrote the book. When Variety posted the story to Twitter, Jenny Han responded with a thinking emoji in a now-deleted tweet. When Condor saw Han’s tweet, she clearly got excited. “Slow claps all around,” she wrote.\n\nBut the fact that Han deleted her tweet doesn’t bode well for a fourth book or movie. Would she have kept the tweet if she really was working on Lara Jean, part four?\n\nHan, like Condor, seems to have come to terms with the fact that this is really the end for her beloved high-school lovebirds. She told Entertainment Tonight that the movie felt like a “completion,” adding, “I think it’s got all the beauty and pain of growing up and all those milestones we get to see happen in the third movie.”\n\nSo, there you have it. Han seems ready to move on from Lara Jean, though the heroine will always be out there, creating romance in a world that so desperately needs it."
