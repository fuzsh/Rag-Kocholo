        "text": "Before diving into \"XO, Kitty,\" which is now streaming on Netflix, here's everything that you need to know in advance, from where we left off after \"To All the Boys: Always and Forever\" to the rest of the show's cast.\n\nThe show takes place after the third 'To All the Boys' movie, and focuses on Lara Jean's younger sister Kitty\n\nIn \"To All the Boys: Always and Forever,\" adapted from the third and final book in Jenny Han's trilogy, Lara Jean makes the difficult decision to attend NYU — on the complete opposite side of the country from her boyfriend Peter Kavinsky, who will attend Stanford. Despite temporarily breaking up, the pair decide to stay together — and work through the long distance.\n\nMore important to the story of \"XO, Kitty,\" Lara Jean's younger sister enters a long-distance relationship of her own. At the beginning of the film during a trip to Seoul, Kitty meets a young man, Dae, who quickly becomes her boyfriend.\n\nAnna Cathcart reprises her role from the films, which she told Netflix's Tudum that she auditioned for at age 14.\n\n\"It feels very surreal that this is kind of my story now,\" Cathcart said in a Netflix featurette.\n\n'XO, Kitty' takes place primarily in Seoul, South Korea\n\nNow in her junior year of high school — the same grade Lara Jean was in when she got together with Peter — Kitty is ready to reconnect with Dae after being long-distance, as well as learn more about her late mother. That leads her to the Korean International School of Seoul (KISS), where her mother was a student, and where Dae conveniently also attends. And according to Netflix's Tudum, it's been four years since they first connected.\n\nWhile Kitty doesn't speak fluent Korean, other characters in the show do, Teen Vogue reported — making the series a mix of both Korean- and English-language.\n\nIn the trailer for the show, Kitty travels to Seoul to attend KISS, where she learns that her boyfriend Dae is apparently dating another girl — his classmate, Yuri. Kitty, however, insists that her desire to attend the school isn't \"all about a boy.\" She wants her \"own adventure\" too.\n\nThe cast includes some K-drama stars and newcomers\n\nMinyeong Choi plays Dae, Kitty's long-distance boyfriend, and has recently appeared in Netflix K-dramas like \"Twenty Five Twenty One\" and \"Itaewon Class.\" Gia Kim plays Yuri, the daughter of the KISS principal, in her first major role.\n\nSang Heon Lee plays Min ho, Dae's school friend with an eye for luxury and skincare, and will soon appear in the adaptation of \"Gran Turismo.\" Anthony Keyvan plays Q, another one of Dae's friends who becomes Kitty's confidante at KISS, and is best known for \"Love, Victor.\"\n\nThe show also stars Yunjin Kim, who is best known to American audiences as Sun-Hwa Kwon in \"Lost,\" as Yuri's mother.\n\nWhile 'XO, Kitty' wasn't part of Han's original book trilogy, she was a coshowrunner on the series\n\nHan, who wrote all three novels in the \"To All the Boys\" trilogy, and Sascha Rothchild are the showrunners of \"XO, Kitty.\" They told Netflix's Tudum that while \"XO, Kitty\" takes place in the \"To All the Boys\" world, it's also its own distinct story.\n\nRothchild told Tudum that Kitty's actions as a younger child – i.e., going through her sister's belongings and mailing her unsent love letters — carry over to how she approaches her own life in \"XO, Kitty.\" Han said that it was fun to \"explore\" her character in this new medium.\n\n\"She's so not in her head,\" Han said. \"She will say the first thing that comes to mind. Kitty is definitely a living-out-loud kind of a character.\"\n\nThe first season premieres Thursday on Netflix"
