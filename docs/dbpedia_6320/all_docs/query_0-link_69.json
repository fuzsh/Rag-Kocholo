        "text": "Professional translator Alice Campos (Florinda Bolkan), who has been providing real-time translation for an academic conference on astronautics, is haunted by a disturbing dream – a garbled memory of a cheesy old 1950s sci-fi movie she saw in her youth but didn’t catch the end of, Footprints On the Moon, in which the mysterious Professor Blackmann (Klaus Kinski) arranges for astronauts to be abandoned unconscious on the surface of the Moon, in order to observe their reactions when they wake up to see the lunar module flying away without them. Alice wakes up Thursday morning and belatedly discovers that she can’t remember anything since Monday afternoon, when she was called in unexpectedly to fill in someone else’s translation shift at the conference.\n\nA ripped-up, blank postcard she finds among her possessions advertises the Hotel Garma, on the island of Garma; with her being suspended on her job pending a disciplinary decision, due to her employers not buying the amnesia line, Alice has ample time to investigate. She has no recollection of being on Garma before – but plenty of people recognise her, not as Alice but as “Nicole”. Has Alice/Nicole been the victim of some sort of psychological fugue state? If so, what prompted it? And either way, what happened during her bout of missing time? To discover that, she’ll need to retrace her steps, pick up her trail, and follow her Footprints…\n\nFootprints – AKA Footprints On the Moon, AKA Primal Impulse, AKA Le Orme, is one of the few giallos directed by Luigi Bazzoni, and would be his last theatrical release. Co-written by Bazzoni and Mario Fenelli, it is an (apparently quite loose) adaptation of Las Huellas, a novel by Fenelli. It’s recently enjoyed a rerelease on Blu-Ray via Shameless, which offers it in two versions – the US cut and an an “Integral Cut” restoring the full running time, albeit with some scenes only in Italian with English subtitles because an English dub for them either no longer exists or was never made. Emerging in 1975, Footprints is a product of the classier, artier side of the genre; one would be tempted to draw comparisons with Dario Argento, particularly when it came to the use of colour, except actually I’d say the Argento this reminds me most of is not any of his 1970s gialli but Tenebrae – it has a similarly cold, isolated aesthetic to it, which perhaps is meant to achieve a similar effect in terms of underlining the alienation of the main character.\n\nNot, I hasten to add, that Footprints is remotely as violent or gruesome as Tenebrae – in fact, there’s vastly less in the way of direct violence here than is typical for the genre, and it’s also vastly less horny than the vast majority of its peers. The Shameless Blu-Ray has a 12 certificate, which is astonishingly low for a giallo. It isn’t without thrills – matters escalate to murder eventually, but it takes a good while to get there – but it’s much more interested in the “slowly deepening mystery” side of the genre than it is the cheaper thrills. This feels like the right call for the subject matter. There’s a melancholic air over the entire thing – a sort of aching sadness, where regular bouts of eroticism would seem incongruous.\n\nThe production was shot in a few weeks in 1974, split between Rome and Turkey, which perhaps helps give the sense of the fictional island of Garma as being a sort of no-place, with architectural flourishes that are here reminiscent of one culture, there reminiscent of another – we can think of it not as Rome, not Istanbul, not even Byzantium, but a fragment of long-lost Trebizond, a place where things can be lost and forgotten. If Alice is a citizen of the world – hailing from Portugal, working in Italy, translating a swathe of other languages – then Nicole must then be a citizen of Garma, a personality created during her jaunt that was only exposed on that island.\n\nAlice’s investigation, then, is as much about inferring a psychological profile of Nicole as it is retracing her steps. Nicoletta Elmi has a striking role as Paola, a child who recognises Alice/Nicole and seems to want to be friendly, but her parents strongly disapprove of Nicole/Alice and try to keep Paola away from her. In some moments, it seems like Paola was hurt by Nicole somehow; in others, Alice’s insistent demands for answers seem to put her on the verge of hurting Paola – again? There’s been plenty of movies in which protagonists become aware of an inner, deeper darkness to themselves, but a lot of the time that dark side is actually just kind of fun and sexy; here Alice’s other side seems to be genuinely dangerous, which heightens the horror of her predicament.\n\n(Elmi had a bit of a gala year in 1975 – as well as being an enigmatic kid here, she had a role in Deep Red as an enigmatic kid there.)\n\nThe visuals on the new Blu-Ray are a great improvement over the last version of Footprints I saw, really teasing out aspects that prior versions glossed over a little. There’s some day-for-night scenes shot with a heavy blue tint which gives them this striking look; other shots are overwhelmed with whites and greys (like Alice lounging in her cream-coloured clothes on her pale couch in her blank apartment), bringing to mind the monochromatic wasteland of the Moon (which itself prefigures the dusty otherworld in Fulci’s The Beyond). Something which is also emphasised is how the Professor Blackmann segments from Alice’s visions are shot in stark black and white with lots of artifacts, like the film-within-a-film is some tired-out B-movie – an aspect which is easier to perceive with the visual improvements to the rest of the movie.\n\nObviously, with a concept like this the resolution requires a deep dive into Alice/Nicole’s psychological state, which is where a lot of movies of this vintage end up fumbling things, but in this instance I can buy it. The depressing speech at the astronautics convention, alluding to a projected mass biosphere die-off on Earth due to pollution, weaves in a climate anxiety theme early on, and between this and the commented-on dissatisfaction that Alice has in her job it is believable that some sort of psychological episode could have been triggered by all that. It’s equally believable that, once the fugue kicked off, Alice/Nicole would seek refuge in a place and with a person she has little to no conscious memory of, but offers a side of life she has neglected, and which perhaps she feels this deep-seated need to explore.\n\nThe final twist reveals that the thing that Alice/Nicole has to fear most is the ailment which sparks off these episodes in her in the first place – an illness which, as severe mental illness often does, separates and alienates her from others. In its plot centred on psychological fugue, it’s a sort of ancestor of Lost Highway; in its emphasis on melancholic investigation in picturesque surroundings, it reminds me a lot of Don’t Look Now, but whilst in that the final twist hinges on a case of mistaken identity on the protagonist’s part, here it reveals hitherto-unacknowledged aspects of the lead character’s identity. In establishing that the answers are to be found within instead of in the exterior world, Footprints manages to be both a compelling giallo and a fascinating anti-giallo.\n\nOne thing which is notable about the “video nasty” moral panic of the 1980s is the way it was somewhat classist in what it chose to target. Arthouse movies by and large got by scot free, but lowbrow B-movies got hammered, and sure, extreme content tends to be the purview of B-movies, but then again Last House On the Left was directly inspired by Ingmar Bergman’s The Virgin Spring but only one of those got on the infamous Department of Public Prosecutions list.\n\nWhat with the moral panic coinciding with the heyday of the slasher movie, a swathe of slasher and slasher-adjacent films ended up either on the DPP list or otherwise associated with the “video nasty” concept due to gaining ostentatious levels of BBFC approval. Here’s three of them which somehow ended up on my to-watch pile at some point.\n\nMother’s Day\n\nWe open our story at a meeting of EGO – a cultish self-help group run by the buzzword-spouting Ernie (Bobby Collins) – the name stands for Ernie’s Growth Opportunity. Two youths who dress like an extremely square person’s idea of what the Manson Family looked like end up getting a lift from a sweet old lady (Beatrice Pons). The hippies obviously planning on killing and robbing her – but before they can enact her plan, she leads them into the clutches of her ultraviolent sons, Ike (Gary Pollard) and Addley (Michael McCleery), who decapitate the dude, beat down the young lady, then watch as their mother garottes the girl whilst they snigger in the background like Beavis and Butthead.\n\nWe jump to 1980. The Rat Pack, a trio of former college dormmates, have retained their friendships even though they all graduated and went their separate ways 10 years ago and have lived very different lives since. Trina (Tiana Pierce) has become a dyed in the wool yuppie, throwing bawdy booze and cocaine-fuelled pool parties, Jackie (Deborah Luce) has become an untidy New York slacker haunting the periphery of the art world, whilst Abbey (Nancy Hendrickson) has made lots of personal sacrifices in order to care for her sick mother.\n\nEach year, the Rat Pack take it in turns to arrange “mystery weekends” for the gang to all enjoy together. Jackie, it turns out, has arranged the reunion this year – a camping trip in the New Jersey Pine Barrens (or the “Deep Barons”, as a local roadsign has it). Unfortunately, that’s where that creepy murder family from the pre-credits sequence live! When the Rat Pack are kidnapped by the family, the women are going to need to pull out all of their ingenuity to survive… but who or what is Queenie, the one individual that Mother seems to he scared of?\n\nContinue reading “Slashing With the Nasties” →\n\nI’ve previously reviewed the early gialli of Dario Argento here, (as well as his 1985 oddity Phenomena); I capped off the former review with Deep Red, the movie which kicked off what’s generally considered to be Argento’s creative peak. I may as well cover the rest of that – or at least, where I map out his creative peak to be, since opinions vary on whereabouts he lost his mojo.\n\nThe movies I’m going to cover here – Suspiria, Inferno, Tenebrae, and Opera – are perhaps the creative works which most directly contributed to Argento getting multiple entries on the “video nasty” lists compiled by the UK’s Department of Public Prosecutions; Deep Red got on there, but as a release from a bit before the moral panic it would have probably been overlooked if these movies hadn’t come out right at the peak of the controversy.\n\nSpecifically, Suspiria ended up as a so-called “section 3” video nasty – an entry on a supplemental list of films which the Department of Public Prosecutions would not regard as worth prosecuting over, but regarded as liable for confiscation. (This was a distinction it shared with Deep Red.) Inferno hit “section 2” – films liable to be confiscated too, and formerly on section 1, but which dropped out of that when they were the subject of unsuccessful prosecutions in court. Tenebrae was Argento’s “high score” on the video nasty chart, making it to section 1 – films which the DPP would prosecute over, and which weren’t relegated to section 2 due to an unsuccessful prosecution. By comparison, Opera didn’t make the list – perhaps having come out just after the moral panic had peaked and the appetite for adding films to the list had waned. We’re going to be hitting up progressively harder stuff here, with increasing levels of violence and explorations of misogyny on the part of perpetrators as we go.\n\nThis is also the era when Argento was cultivating various padawans (or should that be Sith apprentices?) to try and cultivate the next generation of Italian horror, with Lamberto Bava and/or Michele Soavi closely associated with several of these productions. Bava, as we have seen, would pander to the worst tendencies stalking the Italian film industry of the era, whilst Soavi served his time in a range of productions from the highbrow to the schlocky before coming into his own as a director and creating some of the last truly top-flight horror movies to come from the Italian arthouse-horror tradition that Argento was the lead proponent of.\n\nIn other words, these are the movies which not only forged the future of the field (brief though it was), but which Argento’s earlier movies were building to. Along with Deep Red, this is where Argento’s vision took its purest form.\n\nSuspiria\n\nAmerican student Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) arrives in the middle of a hideous rainstorm at the Tanz Academie (dance school) in Freiburg, Germany, where she’ll be honing her craft at ballet. As her taxi arrives at the school, she sees a student – Pat (Eva Axén) – exit the front door, yell something which cannot be overheard over the driving rain, and run off into the downpour. The receptionist at the school is either unable or unwilling to understand that Suzy has an invitation to come study, so she has no choice other than to take the cab back into town to stay somewhere overnight. As the taxi returns to Freiburg, Suzy glimpses Pat rushing through the forest onfoot.\n\nPat makes it into town and finds sanctuary with a friend, declaring her intent to leave town in the morning and never return to the school again. Pat won’t survive to do that, however – going into her friend’s bathroom to clean up, she catches a glimpse of something in the darkness outside, and then someone bursts in through the window. What follows is a vicious, over-the-top, almost ritualistic killing, which leaves Pat gruesomely slain and leaves her friend as collateral damage – killed by falling debris when Pat’s body comes crashing through a skylight. So far, so giallo – and given that Dario Argento’s 1977 masterpiece Suspiria came after a string of some four gialli, audiences at the time would have likely expected another story in the same vein as Deep Red.\n\nBut the Tanz Academie is more than just a mere co-educational dance school. Though she initially tries to stay off-campus in the flat of one of her classmates, events conspire to prompt Suzy to live on-campus in the school itself, after she has a funny turn during practice – a turn which seems to have been brought on by a strange encounter with a staff member with a mirror in the hallway. Strange breezes and sounds rattle the structure of the building. The place is decorated in strange, vivid colours according to some esoteric plan. A crate of food apparently spontaneously spoils, prompting a plague of maggots throughout the female students’ quarters. And the director of the academy is never seen.\n\nThe trail of bodies continues to pile up, and bit by bit Suzy is drawn to the centre of the school’s mysteries – one of which is the unseen director, notable for her strange, sonorous breath, which Suzy overheard during the practice room sleepover when the director slept with a curtain separating her from the rest of the students. Yet is it remotely possible that the director may be none other than the original founder of the academy – the mysterious Helena Markos, who established the place in 1895? And if that is so, and she is still alive 80 years later, is there truth to the rumour that Markos was a witch?\n\nContinue reading “Sighs and Darkness: Argento’s Infernal, Operatic Peak” →\n\nLast time we dipped into the deep bench of work left behind by micro-budget director extraordinaire Michael J. Murphy, we went on a quick tour of his surviving work from the 1970s (and some fragments hailing from even earlier), much of which would have been simply impossible to find prior to Powerhouse releasing Magic, Myth & Mutilation, a comprehensive full-career retrospective.\n\nNow let’s plunge deeper into that boxed set and tackle Murphy’s work from the early 1980s. Here, we’re starting to enter the realm of projects which more than a tiny few might have actually seen before, because at least one production from this era got picked up in the home video boom and got more exposure than any of Murphy’s other early works…\n\nThe Cell\n\nIn medieval times, a condemned man (Russell Hall) is imprisoned, accused of being a serial killer – though he insists on his innocence, naturally. On the night before his execution, his jailer (Michael J. Murphy) lets a prostitute (Carol Aston) into his cell, the local tradition permitting a final conjugal visit. The prisoner is not interested in her services, so they talk, and she becomes convinced that he is innocent. Moved by his story, she is determined to help him – but the jailer won’t let her out of the cell until the morning…\n\nThis is a short film that was actually constructed as one. The 1970s movies I covered last time mostly have runtimes of 50-odd minutes – Secrets being an exception at 88 minutes – though it is perhaps tricky to tell how long those were meant to last; the movies this time around, aside from this one, also have runtimes in that under-an-hour range, but we can be more confident that they are in more or less complete forms.\n\nThis one, by comparison, comes in at a lean 14 minutes, and benefits from it – it’s basically a small character-driven piece, elevated by how well Murphy and the gang are able to realise its atmosphere through low-budget costume and set design. It’s got the same sort of “medieval costume by way of LARP gear” aesthetic which Tristan and Iseult had and which put me in mind of Hawk the Slayer when I watched that, and perhaps the passage of time meant current tastes started to align with the style of Murphy’s historicals and fantasies.\n\nIndeed, it’s with The Cell that Murphy started to actually get some recognition outside of his immediate social circle – it got a four-star award from Movie Maker magazine, a UK periodical aimed at the amateur filmmaking hobby, a pastime which Murphy was likely one of the most advanced practitioners of.\n\nMurphy himself appears more prominently on-camera than we’ve seen him before, and his performance is a bit hokier – though as the jailer it’s not a central role, and he does manage to get across an air of sleaziness. There’s a bit where he tells the prostitute that if she has trouble with the prisoner, she can call him in and he’d finish the job, and it’s genuinely unclear whether he means he’d fuck her or the prisoner, so if you’re looking for LGBT+ readings of his work, there you go.\n\nOf course, one of the reasons Murphy was able to produce these results was because of his coterie of regulars. Carol Aston was a regular of his late 1970s works, of course, and Caroline MacDowell, another frequent collaborator of the era, has a minor role here. The Cell also commences a run of appearances from Russell Hall, who would move on after Invitation To Hell. The short hinges on the interaction between Hall and Aston, and whilst their performances often veer more into amateur dramatics territory than the type of performance we’re used to seeing in movies, there’s something to it which elevates it to being more than the sum of its parts. Perhaps that’s why Murphy’s next movie put the chemistry between Aston and Hall at centre stage.\n\nContinue reading “The Murphiad, Part 2: 1980-1982” →\n\nOne of the most obscure directors working in British genre cinema was the Portsmouth-based veteran Michael J. Murphy. A film buff from a young age, his first productions essentially consisted of him and some of his school buddies having a bit of a lark, but even then involved more elaborate productions than you might expect of teenagers in the mid-1960s playing about with a camera. From the beginning, he seems to have had a knack for seeking out and recruiting like-minded collaborators; many of his cast and crew would come back to help out with multiple projects over the years, and the impression one gets in people’s recollections is of a genuinely beloved figure who created this found family around himself based on a shared love of the movies and a willingness to commit to the bit.\n\nTowards the end of his school days, his headmaster would make an effort to get him a placement with Elstree Studios so he could pursue a career in film, but Murphy would spend his subsequent years well outside of the mainstream British film industry. His early works would get extremely limited local showings – essentially seen only by friends and family, and via a few venues willing to give his material a chance – but come the 1980s the home video boom would change everything. Distributors were keen for any material they could put out there, and Murphy was only too happy to oblige – yielding some of the strangest straight-to-video movies of the era.\n\nMurphy would keep chugging along putting out movies for decades, and died shortly after the release of his 2015 film The Return of Alan Strange, and it’s a measure of the affection his film-making friends had for him that they’ve gone to significant lengths to ensure his legacy is preserved. Murlyn, the production company he ran alongside Phil Lyndon, a regular leading actor in his later productions, has gone to lengths to ensure that his movies are available – as well as making a range of his work available on Tubi, they’ve teamed up with Powerhouse and the Indicator blu-ray imprint to put out Magic, Myth & Mutilation: The Micro-Budget Cinema of Michael J. Murphy, which contains pretty much his entire canon in one box.\n\nPerhaps the rise of YouTube and amateur filmmaking on there has made this set especially timely. Just as Murphy was ahead of his time in terms of putting out cheap genre movies before the home video market was really there to take advantage of his output, he was also arguably a forerunner of anyone who’s ever grabbed a camera and made a zero-budget story for YouTube like the Marble Hornets guys and their peers. The US had a more substantial micro-budget cinema scene back in the day – as witnessed by releases like Vinegar Syndrome’s Home Grown Horrors and Arrow’s American Horror Project volumes 1 and 2 – but Murphy was charting a somewhat lonelier course in Britain, in part because we didn’t really have the sort of grindhouse cinemas that the US had, and his work as such verges on outsider art, perhaps disqualified only from that status only because of the number of collaborators he managed to sweep along with him.\n\nFor this first article going through the box, I’m going to take in the material from the 1970s included therein – all of which has needed a certain amount of reconstruction on the part of Powerhouse. The accompanying booklet is refreshingly blunt about the frustrations of the restoration process; as it turns out, Murphy was absolutely terrible when it came to archiving his stuff, and for budget reasons would often edit the source material directly rather than making copies. When it comes to his 1960s material, basically all that exists are a few snippets here and there; the 1970s movies can be presented in versions which more or less get across the idea of the stories in question, but are not as complete as they could be, since the original 16mm stock is incomplete and bits of the soundtrack have had to be reclaimed from various sources – or are outright lost.\n\nSome bits are taken from camcorder recordings made by Murphy in the 1980s, when he screened the films at home for the appreciation of family and friends, because these are simply the only sources for the bits in question; it says a lot both for Murphy’s knack with a camera and the skill of Powerhouse’s restorers that these bits are viable for use at all, but even so the occasional nose-dives in quality are quite evident.\n\nFrom the early 1980s onwards, Murphy’s material is available in much more complete forms – because the home video boom gave him an outlet to actually release the things to more than very limited-circulation screenings, so where all else failed those old tapes could be utilised to fill any gaps. But for this leg of the journey, we are in for a rocky path indeed, and none more rocky than the very first step on our trip through the Murphy dimension…\n\nContinue reading “The Murphiad, Part 1: 1970-1979” →\n\nInspiration, homage, and the widespread borrowing of ideas is part of how any artistic medium works, cinema included. Culture is a conversation, conversation often requires responding to something someone else said. Kurosawa made Yojimbo as a Samurai-inspired riff on Dashiell Hammett’s Red Harvest; Sergio Leone then made A Fistful of Dollars as a Western-flavoured riff on Yojimbo. That’s just how the game works.\n\nThat said, the Italian film industry has sometimes been, shall we say, unusually flagrant about borrowing from others. It got especially blatant in the 1980s; Bruno Mattei would release a film entitled Terminator 2 (and, even more cheekily, renamed as Aliens 2 in some markets before it eventually settled on the less ripoff-y name Shocking Dark), there’d be an Alien 2 (and Contamination, which borrowed a bunch of ideas from Alien but executed them in a sloppy way), the distributors of The Last Shark got sued because it was just a straight ripoff of Jaws, there’s the La Casa series of films passed off as Evil Dead sequels, and then there’s the absolute legion of zombie films that have been spuriously presented as being sequels to Dawn of the Dead.\n\nHowever, before the 1980s the Italian film industry seems to have been in a genuinely healthier place. For this article, I’m going to take a look at a couple of Italian horror releases which take clear inspirations from other movies or movie series – but at the same time, also bring something distinctive and new to the table.\n\nLady Frankenstein\n\nBaron Frankenstein (Joseph Cotten) and his research partner, Dr. Charles Marshall (Paul Muller), are on the verge of the culmination of their life’s work: restoring life to a cobbled-together corpse (Riccardo Pizzuti). How fortunate that this wonderful event should coincide with the return home of the Baron’s daughter, Tania (Rosalba Neri), after her successful qualification as a surgeon! Alas, the creature predictably runs wild and goes on a murder rampage.\n\nIntent on conserving her father’s reputation, Tania refuses to allow Marshall to notify the police. Instead, she comes up with her own plan: make her own creature, strong enough to battle the original prototype! And it had occurred to her that her ideal man would combine the intellectual wit and obvious infatuation for her of Dr. Marshall with the youth and physicality of Thomas (Marino Masé), the castle’s manservant who has fairly significant intellectual disabilities. Alas, busybody lawman Captain Harris (Mickey Hargitay) just won’t leave well enough alone…\n\nLady Frankenstein, directed by Mel Welles, is a 1971 Frankenstein-themed horror movie which is part of a long tradition of riffing on Frankenstein, but seems specifically to be imitating the Hammer Studios Frankenstein series in its approach. Specifically, it mashes up the overall aesthetic of the Hammer Frankenstein series with the more explicit sensibilities of 1970s Italian B-movies. Really, this largely amounts to saying the quiet part loud; classic Hammer wasn’t afraid to be a bit titillating from time to time, but within fairly careful limits; The Horror of Frankenstein was their attempt to do a “Frankenstein, only the scientist is a hottie who fucks” movie, and it seems positively tame next to Lady Frankenstein. Not for nothing did one of the taglines read “Only the Monster She Made Could Satisfy Her Strange Desires!” – if you saw that and bought a ticket, you’d have gotten more or less what you paid for.\n\nContinue reading “A Classier Standard of Plagiarism” →\n\nWhilst Mario Bava is generally held to have invented the giallo subgenre, many would argue that it was Dario Argento that perfected it. With four productions in the first half of the 1970s, he would make his debut as director, craft a triptych that honed his skills (this being the “Animal Trilogy” due to the critter-themed titles), and then produce perhaps the greatest giallo ever. Let’s take a look in the menagerie…\n\nThe Bird With the Crystal Plumage\n\nSam Dalmas (Tony Musante) is an American writer holidaying in Rome with Julia (Suzy Kendall), his girlfriend. The city is troubled by a series of killings of young women – and then Sam is troubled when he witnesses a brutal attack on a woman in an art gallery. Trapped between two reinforced-glass security doors, Sam can only watch helplessly as the victim bleeds on the floor. She turns out to be Monica Ranieri (Eva Renzi), wife of gallery owner Alberto (Umberto Raho), and thanks to Sam’s quick-thinking attempt to alert a passer-by the police and medics arrive in time to save her life.\n\nSam is warned not to leave Rome – mostly because he’s the only useful witness the police have been able to find so far when it comes to this suspected serial killer, but also because the police can’t 100% rule out the possibility that he did the killing, got caught between the security doors, and pretended to be an innocent witness to throw off suspicion. Sam’s not thrilled and would rather put the matter behind him – but perhaps the killer has other plans; an assailant attacks him in the fog as he’s walking back to the holiday apartment, in an attack which would have been fatal were it not from a shouted warning by a bystander, and even when he gets back to Julia and is able to take his mind off things a little he can’t help but play over the traumatic scenes he witnessed in his mind.\n\nSam decides that the best way to get his passport and peace of mind back – not to mention save his neck – is to help the lead detective, Inspector Morosini (Enrico Marina Salerno) crack the case; Morosini and the police are sufficiently overwhelmed by potential leads that Morosini gives Sam’s investigations his unofficial blessing. After all, Sam’s sleuthing has clearly hit a nerve – for Julia is soon targeted – and Morosini starts receiving calls from the murderer declaring their intent to commit further outrages. Can Sam and Morosini stop the murderer before Sam or Julia become the next victim?\n\nBy far the most memorable sequence in The Bird With the Crystal Plumage comes early on – that art gallery attack I mentioned earlier. Sam’s panic as he is trapped between the doors, his desperation as he first tries to get in to help her and then seek help from outside, before his dejected helplessness as he watches her bleeding out and is entirely unable to help, is Musante’s best moment in the film. Argento clearly realised he was onto something with this sequence, because it shapes much of the rest of the story: a major plot point is the idea that Sam saw something during that moment which he hasn’t yet fully understood, and there’s also the factor that the traumatic incident keeps replaying itself in the back of his mind, and between those we get snippets of that scene replayed to us over and over across the film.\n\nContinue reading “Three Animals, One Pigment, Many Deaths” →"
