        "text": "A quote from Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight has stuck with me since I watched it back in early 2017, where young Chiron and Juan are relaxing on a shore after an intense swimming exercise. Juan shares a story of his childhood in Cuba, of how he would just run around in the moonlight with no shoes on, just like Chiron. Juan then mentions an old lady who stopped him once and said, “In moonlight, black boys look blue, you blue.” Then Juan follows this up by stating that from now on he shall refer to Chiron as “blue”. This scene introduces us to Juan as an older brother to Chiron, the one who mentors him and gives him guidance that stays with Chiron for a very long time, of how he should decide for himself who he’s going to be and let nobody else make that decision for him. A scene with so much gravity that it stands out from the rest of the movie. Jenkins uses a dreamlike imagery and a sense of realism in equal quantities to make a memory of Juan’s transcend beyond just the script and straight into the viewer’s minds. This acts as a beautiful way to depict who the real Chiron is. The use of the colour blue is to signify how different Chiron is from others and foreshadows how later in his life, beneath all his muscles and heavy-bass music he is still Chiron, the kid who looks blue in moonlight (with the colour blue being a subversion of the expectation of “Black Masculinity” from a young black kid, as blue is more of sombre and calm colour, exactly like Chiron). Especially when in a really intimate scene Chiron reveals to his only friend (and lover) Kevin how the breeze hits Chiron and makes him cry everytime he sits himself down on the beach, a mere cool breeze that brings tears in his eyes (another metaphor used to depict Chiron as a bit of a wildcard in a world dominated with the expectation of being “manly”). Moonlight is a beautiful expression of the need to be yourself instead of building layers of deception to convince others to like you.\n\nThis movie came at an incredibly crucial time in my life as well, a time when I was coming of age and had to decide what I really wanted to be in life. I remained transfixed as the end credits rolled by, I felt as if the movie were trying to whisper something in my ears, a message that I was not able to comprehend in its entirety but a message that certainly evoked an inescapable feeling inside of me. Jenkins does this by creating more of a person in Chiron than just a mere character, we follow him throughout all the significant moments of his life to finally create a portrait of him, which is in all its sense true to Chiron. Moonlight follows Chiron as a child, as a young man and as a full-grown adult in three distinct chapters titled aptly to reflect on who Chiron is at that moment in his life. Jenkins utilizes realistic dialogue which is truer to each character and completely makes sense in the world that Jenkins has created around Chiron. The exploration of themes of masculinity and expectations that the society has of us are also conveyed in the movie, with the characters Kevin and Juan. The script evokes an immense feeling of catharsis in the audience when it wraps up, as we along with Chiron we end a journey of heartache and a thousand natural shocks, but more importantly a journey of self-actualization.\n\nThe very last shot of the movie is a reference to what Juan said about how ‘Black boys look blue in the moonlight’. The scene reflects a theme which is present throughout the movie, that of expectation of masculinity. This marks the end of his journey which is also shown in Nicolas Britell’s score when during this scene, with a sense of finality being reflected in the score. In this scene, we see Chiron staring back at something as the moonlight makes him look blue, which is a metaphor of him finally realizing what his place is, finally letting go of his insecurities of him trying hard to be something he is not. The scene follows the scene of Chiron meeting his old High School friend Kevin. Behind his muscles and his shiny silver teeth, this is where we see a vulnerable Chiron. Jenkins uses the colour blue to signify the ending of a beautiful journey of individuation for Chiron. The scene involves the camera tracking towards Chiron as it starts from a long shot and ends in a mid-shot when Chiron is seen looking back at some entity. This camera movement symbolises the journey the viewers and Chiron have gone through in the movie. A journey inwards. The sound design consists of the sound of waves hitting the shore, a reminder of how close Chiron has come to his ‘natural’ being and how he realised finally, who he is. The blue tint/filter is added in post and the scene was shot in a higher FPS than usual in order to make the audience feel the finality and the significance of this scene.\n\nMoonlight stands as a testament to what good writing and an even better execution of that script can do to its audience as it certainly did to me. A movie that completely floored me and inspired me to pursue Filmmaking as a career.A movie that reminded me why I love movies, why I want to go out there and tell a story to the world, why I obsessively go through the catalogue of upcoming movies expecting an amazing movie, why I always prefer to go to the movies alone so that I can get the best out of it for myself. This movie serves as a testament to what cinema is and what it can achieve, as Andrei Tarkovsky; the great Russian filmmaker describes it “A mosaic made in time.”\n\nAman"
