        "text": "5 More Random Films from the American Film Institute’s 2007 List of the 100 Greatest American Films and Their Comic Connections\n\n1. Citizen Kane (#1)\n\nReleased in 1941, Orson Welles’ classic film Citizen Kane has attracted a lot of fans over the years. William Randolph Hearst wasn’t one of them.\n\nWelles was only 24 when he arrived in Hollywood, but he had already made a name for himself on the New York theater scene and in radio (particularly with his radio adaptation of The War of the Worlds in 1938). After scoring a lucrative contract with the struggling RKO studio, he was searching for an idea for his first film when his friend, writer Herman Mankiewicz, suggested a script based on the life of Hearst.\n\nHearst was a businessman best known for creating the nation’s largest media company, Hearst Communications. He was also one of the biggest proponents of yellow journalism, using scandal, fear-mongering and populism to sell newspapers. Massively wealthy, he owned eight homes — including Hearst Castle, built on a 240,000-acre ranch in San Simeon, CA — and tried his hand at politics, representing New York’s 11th District in Congress before unsuccessfully running for president, governor of New York and mayor of New York City.\n\nAfter watching a preview screening of the unfinished film, gossip columnist Hedda Hopper wasted no time passing along the news to Hearst about what Welles was up to. While Welles and Mankiewicz insisted Charles Foster Kane was a composite character inspired by different sources, Hearst and his allies saw nothing but a feature-length swipe at him — the most egregious one being the portrayal of Kane’s second wife, a young alcoholic singer who had a lot in common with Hearst’s own mistress, the showgirl-turned-actress Marion Davies.\n\n(According to an essay written for the New York Review of Books by Gore Vidal, “Rosebud” was also Hearst’s pet name for Davies’ lady parts, though no one really knows what inspired Mankiewicz to use that word in his script.)\n\nJust days after the screening, Hearst ordered all his publications not to run advertisements for the film. His newspapers also went after Welles personally, accusing him of Communist sympathies. And just in case Hollywood didn’t get the message, he threatened war against them, too, stirring up public sentiment against the film industry by publicly condemning the number of “immigrants” and “refugees” working in Hollywood instead of Americans (the attacks being a not-too-subtle reference to the many Jewish members of the Hollywood establishment).\n\nHollywood’s major players — already resentful of the youthful Welles and his open contempt for how they did business — played ball. MGM’s Louis B. Mayer even offered to pay RKO $842,000 if the studio agreed to destroy the negative and all prints of Citizen Kane. RKO refused and then threatened to sue some of the nation’s biggest theater chains after they refused to distribute the film. Eventually, the chains relented and permitted a few showings of the film, which barely broke even thanks to their efforts.\n\nThe following year, at the 14th Academy Awards, Citizen Kane won only one of the nine awards it was up for, a shared Best Screenplay Oscar for Mankiewicz and Welles, who had to sit in the audience and hear the boos every time their film’s name was mentioned. After its theatrical run, it was almost forgotten until its revival on television in the 1950s, after RKO became one of the first studios to sell its library to television studios. (The fact that Hearst died in 1951 and wasn’t around anymore to threaten anyone who showed it didn’t hurt, either.)\n\nLater in his life, Welles described a chance encounter he had with Hearst in an elevator at San Francisco’s Fairmont Hotel on the night Citizen Kane opened in that city. Hearst and Welles’s father knew each other, so Welles introduced himself and invited Hearst to the opening. Hearst did not respond. “As he was getting off at his floor, I said, ‘Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.’ No reply,” recalled Welles. “And Kane would have, you know. That was his style.”\n\nLike I said, it took a while for most film critics and fans to discover Citizen Kane. But when they did, it didn’t take them long to declare it a masterpiece. Regularly appearing in polls and surveys as one of the best (if not the best) American films ever made, Citizen Kane has entered that strange territory in our culture where the number of people who recognize its name as a great film outnumber the people who have actually seen it. It’s become a bit of a running gag that Citizen Kane is the first choice of people who want to sound smart when asked to name their favorite film and they know that their honest answer won’t cut it.\n\nWhether the film is truly the best of all time is a personal opinion. But anyone who finds themselves defending the film’s No. 1 status on the AFI Top 100 list has a few powerful reasons in their corner.\n\nFor starters, there’s the innovative storytelling. Most films up to that point employed a direct and chronological way of telling a story, but Citizen Kane opens with the main character’s death, uses a newsreel feature to tell the whole story of his life, then bounces between different narrators as a reporter tries to solve the mystery of Kane’s final word. By the end of the film, the central mystery (“What does ‘Rosebud’ refer to?”) is revealed, but the audience still doesn’t know what it ultimately means. It was a conclusion that left the audiences with more questions than answers, in a film that trusted them to ponder it themselves.\n\nThen there was the cinematography itself. Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland borrowed from the best, using film editing techniques pioneered by D.W. Griffith, German Expressionists and other early film masters to create a film where every shot purposely adds to the story — and create some unforgettable images in the process. As Roger Ebert once wrote while praising the film: “The movie is filled with bravura visual moments: the towers of Xanadu; candidate Kane addressing a political rally; the doorway of his mistress dissolving into a front-page photo in a rival newspaper; the camera swooping down through a skylight toward the pathetic Susan in a nightclub; the many Kanes reflected through parallel mirrors; the boy playing in the snow in the background as his parents determine his future; the great shot as the camera rises straight up from Susan’s opera debut to a stagehand holding his nose, and the subsequent shot of Kane, his face hidden in shadow, defiantly applauding in the silent hall.”\n\nThen there’s Kane himself, a man who had everything and nothing at the same time… a man with a quick wit and keen insights into what his readers wanted to read, but still struggled to communicate his own needs to others… a man who chose his mistress over his marriage and his political career for reasons we’re never told… a man who filled his cavernous mansion with priceless objects he couldn’t be bothered to unpack from their crates… a man who entertained millions but ultimately died alone. If the story of Charles Foster Kane’s life isn’t still relevant in our wealth- and status-obsessed age, then I don’t know what is.\n\nSpeaking of wealth and status. As I said, Citizen Kane’s reputation as an early innovator in cinema has made it a favorite of filmmakers and other creative types eager to play with the possibilities of their chosen media — or just give a shout-out to an easily recognized classic.\n\nIn “Citizen Wayne” (The Batman Chronicles #21, 2000), Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos recast the film with familiar Gotham faces. Bruce Foster Wayne, “America’s Kubla Khan,” has just died and a reporter by the name of Kent is assigned the task of figuring out what his last word, “Rosebud,” meant. Kent visits Selina Kyle at her nightclub, Mr. Grayson at his office, an elderly James Gordon at the rest home, and even Wayne’s faithful butler who promises to tell Kent all about Rosebud. Hint: it ain’t no sleigh.\n\n2. The Last Picture Show (#95)\n\nThe small-town movie theater that plays the titular “last picture show” in Peter Bogdanovich’s 1971 film is named the Royal. By sheer coincidence, the movie house in the small mining town where I grew up was also called the Royal.\n\nHere’s another coincidence: The theater in that Texas town closes for good on a cold night in November 1952, around the time that television was taking over as the dominant entertainment medium in American culture. The theater where I grew up closed its doors in 2007, the same year that Netflix — a business that built its fortune on delivering rental DVDs through the mail — introduced its video on demand service.\n\n(I wasn’t in my hometown for the final screening at the Royal, but I’m told the last picture shown there was Nicole Kidman’s The Golden Compass. Not the best film to go out on, maybe, but at least the theater didn’t hang on for one more week to run that year’s Alvin and the Chipmunks.)\n\nWatching The Last Picture Show brought out a lot of emotions about where I was raised, all of which I can safely file under “it’s complicated,” and I think anyone who grew up in a small town can relate to what the film depicts about life in Anarene, Texas.\n\nOn the one hand, this dusty dot on the map is all that graduating seniors Sonny (Timothy Bottoms), Duane (Jeff Bridges) and Jacy (Cybill Shepherd, in her film debut) really know. Living in a town with only a dying movie house and dingy pool hall for entertainment forms a huge part of their identity, just as it does for the older folks in town who can’t stop griping to Duane and Sonny about how bad the high school football team is doing this year. But on the other hand, there’s always a lingering sense of regret, of the roads not taken by the people who live there — a feeling that’s punctuated by the Hank Williams songs that are always playing on the radio, or one of the inane TV game shows (broadcasting from New York City, a more magical place that is decidedly Not There) playing in the background to remind these people just how far away they are from everything else.\n\nUnimaginative souls (particularly those working in the political fields) tend to paint small towns as wholesome places full of simple, hard-working folks who can rightly lay claim to being the nation’s source of “real” Americans or Canadians or whichever country we’re talking about. It’s a picture that’s not just a rude dismissal of the millions of people who live in urban areas, it’s also an insult to the people living in those small towns — people who lead rich and complicated lives full of pain and regret just like anyone else.\n\nSpeaking of pain and regret, let’s talk sex. There’s a lot of it in this film, but it’s never the erotic kind. Shepherd’s striptease at a pool party with other naked bodies in full view got a lot of attention at the time (the film was banned in Phoenix for violating a state obscenity statute, a ruling that was later overturned by a federal court), but it’s striking how none of the sex in the film looks, well, fun — like it’s just another way for the people in this town to escape their reality, or something you do because everyone else expects you to do it even if you don’t know why you’re doing it yourself.\n\nPlot-wise, there isn’t much to talk about in the film; there’s no bet between friends to lose their virginity before the end of the school year, no big rivalry between the snobs and the poor kids in town that ends in a food fight, and the school’s glee club doesn’t put on a big show to save the town’s movie house.\n\nInstead, we get a picture of what life is like for most small-town folk (or anyone, really) — a series of events that happen with no real rhyme or reason, punctuated by the older generation trying in vain to impart some wisdom on the younger generation to help them avoid repeating the mistakes they made. Sonny begins an affair with a lonely housewife (Cloris Leachman, who won an Oscar for her role), Duane and Jacy break up after he can’t sexually close the deal in a motel room, and Sonny and Jacy later elope in Oklahoma only for Jacy’s parents to call the police and have the marriage annulled (Jacy leaves a note telling her parents what they’re doing as part of her plan to get caught and generate some drama).\n\nWhy do these people do what they do? Why does anyone? You get the feeling that if they knew why they did the things they do, the people in this town would make better decisions with their lives. But that’s not in the cards, because if they all started making better decisions based on an honest assessment of their desires and motives then there wouldn’t be much of a town left for anyone to talk about.\n\nNear the end of the film, right before Duane is shipped off to Korea, he and Sonny are among the meager audience that turns out for the last picture show in town, a showing of Howard Hawks’ Red River, a 1948 John Wayne film set in Texas during the days of the Old West.\n\nIt’s an interesting choice, and not just because Ben Johnson, who won an Oscar for his performance in The Last Picture Show as “Sam the Lion,” co-starred with Wayne in several films (and appeared in Red River himself as an uncredited stuntman). Films like Red River perpetuate the mythology of the American West as a place full of upstanding and self-reliant folks who tamed a continent and built a society from scratch with little more than grit and determination.\n\nIt’s a captivating story, and one that’s true as far it goes… but it’s also a story that glorifies the past and brushes our ancestors with the same simplistic brush that’s used too often on the people living in small towns today.\n\nIt’s also a story that raises some uncomfortable questions for us living in the present. It’s great that the people who came before us had a purpose in their lives, but what about those of us who are living here today? What are we supposed to do with the freedoms and comforts we have because of the work that was done before we showed up? How are supposed to live our lives in a way that’s meaningful? Don’t ask anyone in Anarene, because they don’t know. They barely know why they do anything at all. “Never you mind, honey. Never you mind…”\n\nBased on the characters from Archie Comics, the TV show Riverdale debuted on The CW in 2017 to positive reviews; its sixth season is set to premiere on November 16 of this year.\n\nI am not a regular watcher of the show, but I’ve seen enough of it to know there are a lot of ways the CW teen drama differs from The Last Picture Show. But there are a few similarities, too.\n\nFor starters, both the show and the film center around the lives of a group of teenagers living in a small town that’s full of secrets. There’s an illicit affair between a younger man and an older woman (Sonny and Ruth in Last Picture Show, Archie and Miss Grundy in Riverdale). Jacy would have a lot in common with Cheryl Blossom, a wealthy and manipulative girl who’s also into sexual experimentation. And while the adults in both towns are present in their childrens’ lives, they’re also shown to have their own personal issues that often make it hard for them to be upstanding role models for their kids.\n\n“The Last Picture Show” is the title given to the fourth episode in Riverdale’s first season. Along with ongoing plot threads involving a murder investigation and Betty and Veronica investigating Miss Grundy’s affairs, we learn that Riverdale’s drive-in theater is about to close down, something that Jughead — who works there as a projectionist — calls “one more nail in the coffin that is Riverdale.”\n\nDespite his efforts to keep it open (for reasons we learn go beyond his desire for continued employment), the property is sold to an anonymous buyer and it falls to Jughead to decide which film gets the honor of being the last one shown at the drive-in. In a nice nod to fans of the show who might have wanted to see some sparks between Jughead and Betty, he goes with her suggestion: James Dean’s Rebel Without a Cause. Is it realistic that teenagers in 2017 would name-check Audrey Hepburn and movies from the 1950s? Probably not. But I don’t think the creators of Riverdale were ever going for a documentary vibe.\n\n3. The Godfather (#2)\n\n“I believe in America.” Those are the first four words heard in 1972’s The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppla’s adaptation of Mario Puzo’s 1969 novel about a fictional New York crime family.\n\nThe words are spoken by Amerigo Bonasera, an undertaker who comes to Don Vito Corleone during his daughter’s wedding to request a favor. (It’s tradition that no Sicilian man can refuse a favor on the day of his daughter’s wedding.) Bonasera tells the Don his story; how he owes his fortune to America, how he raised his daughter to be an American, and how we went to the police “like a good American” when she was brutally attacked by two men. Failing to get what he considered justice from the system he once revered, he comes to Corleone asking him to kill the men, offering to pay anything he asks.\n\nThe Godfather (played to perfection by an Oscar-winning Marlon Brando) strokes his cat and considers his words. “What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully?” he says. “If you’d come to me in friendship, then the scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by chance an honest man like yourself should make enemies, then they would become my enemies.” He lifts his finger. “And then they would fear you.” Bonasera asks: “Be my friend?” he asks. Corleone shrugs. “Godfather?” Bonasera bows and kisses the Godfather’s ring. Favor granted. (But don’t worry, Don Corleone doesn’t intend to kill the men, because that wouldn’t be justice. “Give this to Clemenza. I want reliable people, people who aren’t going to get carried away. I mean, we’re not murderers. Despite what this undertaker says.”)\n\nOn its own, this opening scene is perfection, a master class in screenwriting, acting, cinematography, lighting work, set design, you name it. But when you place it within the context of the larger three-hour film, the scene becomes an almost transcendent opening aria, neatly distilling some of the major tensions in the film into just over six minutes of screen time — Old Country vs. New World, family vs. society, outsiders vs. insiders, vengeance vs. justice.\n\nItalians have had a long history with America (“America” itself derived from the name of Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci) and Italian emigrants to the country have been among the loudest supporters of the American experiment — but that enthusiasm has not always been reciprocal. Much like other cultural and ethnic groups that have come to America in search of a new life, the Italian-American community has known its share of discrimination, typically at the hands of those who arrived earlier and often feared what the growing presence of Italians and other newcomers represented.\n\nSo what’s an emigrant to do? You can choose the path Bonasera takes: shed your ties to your home country, commit yourself to upholding American institutions, raise your children to see themselves as Americans first. Or you can be more like Don Corleone: a man who has adapted to his American life, yes, but also one who carries on the traditions, values and power structures of the old country with those members of his community who feel the same way.\n\nNeither of these choices is right or wrong. The terms under which someone assimilates into a larger culture isn’t something that should be dictated by the dominant culture; each new arrival has to decide how to do it for themselves. Part of the American promise is that no one has the right to tell anyone else they’re more or less “American” than they are, or that people have to continually prove their level of loyalty to America. Corleone choosing to retain some of the old traditions isn’t a sign that he’s anti-American, far from it — he also accepts America (especially the money-making parts of it), but on his own terms. Just like Bonasera, we find out he has dreams of his children having a better life than him — which to him means his children becoming more American, more accepted than he was — dreams of Michael being a senator or governor, or one of the “pezzonovante” of this new world.\n\nBut what if his children don’t share that dream of being included? Or worse, what if they see that dream denied them by those who won’t let them see themselves as American?\n\nAside from Don Corleone, the other major figure in this film is his son, Michael, played by Al Pacino. Right from the start, he’s positioned as an outsider within the family, as someone who is aware of his father’s world but not actively a part of it. During the wedding scene, his Army uniform (an obvious symbol of his willingness to defend American values and institutions) stands in sharp contrast to all the other suits in the crowd, and he sits apart from everyone else at a small table for two with his girlfriend, a young woman from the decidedly non-Italian suburbs of New Hampshire. He tells her a story about how violent his father can be while making offers that can’t be refused, but ends his tale by assuring her, “That’s my family, Kay, that’s not me.”\n\nSo if that’s where Michael begins the film, how do we get from there to the part where he assumes control of his family’s criminal empire? The greed and violence of Corleone’s mob rivals play a role in his transformation, sure, but I believe the die is cast when the crooked police captain — the one in bed with Corleone’s rivals — calls Michael an anti-Italian slur and breaks his jaw when Michael is trying to protect his recuperating father.\n\nThat right there is the point of no return. Up until then, you could argue Michael was protecting his father out of a sense of duty to his family, as anyone would. But when a crooked cop — a man representing one of the institutions that failed Bonasera and so many others like him — reminds him that he’ll always be seen as an “other” by the people who retain power in his country… that’s the moment when Michael decides that if he won’t ever be seen as anything but one of “those people” by the people in charge, then he’ll find his power and identity within a community that will accept him for who he is.\n\n(A nice touch? The swelling caused by the blow causes Michael to resemble and sound like his bulldog-cheeked father — a telling bit of foreshadowing. It was also a nice bit of method acting on Pacino’s part, as he really did have his jaw wired shut for the first part of the shoot.)\n\nAnd that’s a real loss for America, because as it turns out the same qualities that made Michael successfully detach from the family and their business — something his siblings never mastered — will go a long way in making him a formidable force within the organized crime syndicate that preys on America.\n\nThose qualities? Intelligence, observation, willingness to listen to advice (like when his father offers him tips on how to identify a traitor in his midst), the ability to compartmentalize his life — but disengagement above all else. Of all his siblings, Michael has a sense of emotional detachment and objectivity honed by years of not wanting or asking for the approval of his family or his community as he looked for his own path in the world.\n\nOf course — spoiler for the sequel! — the real tragedy of Michael’s story arc is that those same qualities that take him to the top of his family business will later feed into his growing paranoia and contribute to the break-up of the family he once worked so hard to protect.\n\nThat’s the personal tragedy in the Godfather saga. The larger one, though? How America creates its own enemies by denying the dream of inclusion to the people who arrive on its shores and work the hardest to achieve it. An America where everyone is truly equal and its institutions work to help the people who need it the most instead of pushing them down — now that’s an offer that no one can refuse.\n\nIt’s almost impossible to quantify the impact The Godfather has had on our culture. Not only is it regularly cited as one of the greatest films in American cinema, it has been copied, parodied and referenced so many times that its influence goes far beyond inspiring other mob-themed films and TV shows like Goodfellas and The Sopranos.\n\nIn comics, for instance, the immense popularity of the film in the early ’70s led to a resurgence of pop-culture interest in the Mafia and organized crime, which in turn led to an explosion of paperback novels and comic books starring tough guys like the Executioner and the Punisher fighting their one-man wars against the Mob.\n\nPuzo’s success as a novelist and screenwriter directly led to him being tapped to write the original screenplay for the 1978 Superman film, which would end up influencing the story for both Superman and Superman II. (In his earlier days as a writer, Puzo wrote for Martin Goodman’s men’s magazines to pay his rent while finishing his signature novel, but there’s no evidence any of his work appeared in the comic division of Goodman’s company.)\n\nFor me, though, I don’t think of Superman when I think about The Godfather, I think of Batman instead — and not just because he’s the hero more likely to run around chasing mobsters. In 1996’s Batman: The Long Halloween, Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale start their masterful 13-issue saga with a scene very similar to the opening scene in The Godfather. “I believe in Gotham City,” we see Bruce Wayne say on the first page, draped in shadow like Bonasera at the start of the film. The difference, of course, is that Wayne doesn’t come to Carmine Falcone’s home as a supplicant. He’s there to make it clear he has no intention of using his seat on the board of the Gotham City Bank to help Falcone’s business interests. “I only came here tonight out of respect for my parents who… knew… your family,” he says to the man with more than a passing resemblance to Brando’s character.\n\nFollowing that tense meeting in an underlit study, we see the wedding taking place outside, a lively event featuring many from Gotham’s high society (much like the Corleone affair at the start of the film) and a crusading district attorney by the name of Harvey Dent in the parking lot taking down the license plate numbers of the people in attendance (again, just like the FBI men in the film). There’s even an appearance by Alberto Falcone, “the good son” of the family who will feature prominently in the story as it unfolds.\n\n4. The Godfather: Part II (#32)\n\n“So what happens next?” Sequels are as old as the art of storytelling itself; just ask Thag the Hunter who had to come up with a new story on the fly after the rest of the tribe demanded one just as thrilling as the one he had told the night before about stalking saber-toothed tigers. (He learned his lesson that night; always save some excitement for the next chapter.)\n\nMario Puzo’s novel, parts of which were used in the screenplay for The Godfather: Part II, certainly had enough material for two films. When Francis Ford Coppola was filming the first Godfather, nobody knew at the time how massive a hit it would become; even so, Puzo started writing up a script for a sequel in December 1971, before The Godfather was even released.\n\nThe idea, as Coppola later put it, was to “juxtapose the ascension of the family under Vito Corleone with the decline of the family under his son Michael… I had always wanted to write a screenplay that told the story of a father and a son at the same age. They were both in their thirties and I would integrate the two stories… In order not to merely make Godfather I over again, I gave Godfather II this double structure by extending the story in both the past and in the present.”\n\nHe accomplished this by shuttling back and forth between two stories. The first begins several years after the final moments of Godfather, following Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) as he moves his operations to Nevada and runs into challenges to his plans to become a legitimate businessman; an attempt on his life at his home doesn’t make it any easier for him to get out of the family business. The second story takes us back in time to follow young Vito Corleone (played in adulthood by Robert DeNiro) as he travels from Sicily to America and makes the choices that would take him to the highest levels of organized crime.\n\nThe film did very well at the box office — though not as well as the first Godfather — and the critics were more divided the second time around, with many agreeing with one who said Part II felt “stitched together from leftover parts.” Even Gene Siskel, who said it was “as exciting as the original,” couldn’t help kicking it a bit for not being The Godfather: “The Godfather: Part II may be the second-best gangster movie ever made. But it’s not the same. Sequels can never be the same. It’s like being forced to go to a funeral the second time — the tears just don’t flow as easily.”\n\nOne place where Part II comes out on top is at the trophy case, boasting six Oscars — including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay — to the original film’s three (both were tied for 11 nominations apiece). To this date, The Godfather: Part II is the only sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. (While it’s true 2003’s The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King also won Best Picture and you could argue that film was also a sequel, I tend to think of it less as a sequel — i.e., a new story that builds on the world created in a previous, fully contained story — than as the third part of a continuous story running through a planned-from-the-start trilogy. Reasonable minds can disagree.)\n\nWhen you think about it, it’s fitting that a story about a son trying (and not entirely succeeding) to live up to the example set by his father would be the subject of one of the most celebrated sequels of all time. Whether we’re talking about a person or a film project, it’s hard being the sequel to something else because there’s a lot of pressure on you to do as well as or exceed the example set by your predecessor.\n\nThink about it. Vito builds himself up from nothing, becomes successful, establishes his family as one worthy of respect. And at the end of his long and successful life (give or take a mob hit), he is able to pass on his wealth and power to his son. Michael has everything he needs to be successful in his own right, and yet throughout the course of Part II we witness a man who loses just about everything that ought to matter to him. This happens for a few reasons, but I suspect a big one is his underlying resentment about being cast as the “sequel” in his father’s story.\n\nWhat do I mean? At the end of Part II, we look back in time for one last time — only this time it’s not Vito’s story we’re visiting, it’s an earlier chapter in Michael’s. It’s Christmas 1941, America is going to war, and Michael has just told his siblings at the dinner table that he’s enlisting in the Marines. Sonny is furious, Fredo is supportive, and Tom is incredulous — not because only a “sap” puts himself at risk for people he doesn’t know (like Sonny says), but because his going off to war doesn’t fit with what Vito wanted. “You don’t understand, your father has plans for you,” Tom says. “Many times, he and I have talked about your future.” “You’ve talked to my father about my future?” Michael says flatly. “My… future.”\n\nThat’s the central tragedy of Michael’s life: he may be good at being ruthless, he may be good at being a godfather, but he will always be haunted by the fact this is a life that was chosen for him. His father — who knew what it was like to come from nothing — only wanted the best for him, to see Michael become the American success story that he never could. But in working so hard to secure that future for Michael, he forgot to ask Michael if that was the future he wanted for himself.\n\nAnd so Michael spends much of Part II consumed by anger and lashing out — not just at everyone who betrays him or who he thinks is betraying him, but at his father for taking away his choice… and at himself for knowing on some level he will never live up to the example set by his father no matter how hard he tries. Fredo may have broken his heart, but Michael’s soul — that was damaged long ago.\n\nBeing put in charge of a sequel can have its benefits — Paramount gave Coppola complete control over production for Part II, and he used that freedom to create a world much larger than the one seen in the first film — but it can also have its drawbacks, too.\n\nThe biggest one is the pressure that’s put on you to top what you did the last time, to walk that thin line between re-creating the first film and giving audiences more of what they want to see while also giving them something new that allows the sequel to stand on its own merits.\n\nIn late 2014, while taking some time off from preparing for his highly anticipated sequel Avengers: Age of Ultron to attend the French premiere of his adaptation of Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing, director Joss Whedon discussed the challenges of making a movie that doesn’t rely on the viewer having seen The Avengers or any of the other Marvel movies. While talking to French reporters, he cited The Godfather: Part II as his “guiding star” in telling the story for the second Avengers film:\n\n“The events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier will definitely affect the world of Avengers 2. But at the end of the day, I have to make my movie assuming that people will only have seen the first one, or possibly not even seen the first one. I can’t assume that everybody went to see Thor: The Dark World, Captain America, and Iron Man 3 in between. I have to go from one movie to the next and be true to what’s happened [in the previous movies], but not be slavish to it.\n\n“The model I’m always trying to build from, or my guiding star, is The Godfather: Part II where a ton has happened in between and it’s a very different movie [from Part I], but you don’t need any information. It’s there in the film about what’s happened since, what’s different, and why is this a different film; why is it a different kind of structure, and why is it darker. It’s all there, you’re in the vernacular of the first movie and you’re just ready to pick up in this new place, and hopefully that’s what will happen with my movie. Obviously, I’m talking about one of the greatest films ever made… I hope mine will be good, but that is my guiding star.”\n\nHmm, now that you mention it I never noticed before that both movies have similar endings with the whole “a younger brother causes the death of an older brother because the older brother is too troublesome to be allowed to live” thing…\n\n5. Ben-Hur (#100)\n\nWilliam Wyler’s Biblical epic rounds out the AFI’s Top 100 list at #100, and we’ll get to that film in a minute. Right now, I’m more interested in talking about the films that didn’t make the cut.\n\nAfter watching all 100 of the AFI’s Top 100 films, this is probably a weird thing to admit, but… I don’t like lists. No, that’s not true — most lists are fine. Grocery lists, checklists, bucket lists, it’s all good. It’s best-of lists that bug me.\n\nIn the introduction to his book The Great Movies II, film critic Roger Ebert wrote that he didn’t put all the greatest films in his first book and saved “the second team” for his follow-up volume. “I do not believe in rankings and lists and refuse all invitations to reveal my ‘ten all-time favorite musicals,’ etc., on the grounds that such lists are meaningless and might well change between Tuesday and Thursday,” he wrote.\n\n(He made two exceptions to this rule: his annual list of the year’s best films — “because it is graven in stone that movie critics must do so” — and his once-a-decade involvement in the Sight & Sound poll of the world’s directors and critics.)\n\nI’m with him on this. To me, the idea that any art form as diverse as film can be distilled down to a canonical list of the “greatest films of all time” is just silly. Highest-grossing? Most awarded? Most expensive? Most influential? These are criteria that we can quantify in some way. But “greatest films of all time”…? How do you even begin deciding which films go on that list?\n\nWhile I was making my way through all 100 films on the AFI list, I kept wondering how the people who compiled the list could whittle their picks down to just 100, and what their thought processes were when they picked one film over another to include in the list. Why Ben-Hur instead of The Ten Commandments? Why The Searchers over Stagecoach? Why Tootsie and not Back to the Future? Psycho but not Halloween? King Kong but not Frankenstein? Titanic but not Jurassic Park? And how can anyone make the argument that, say, Chinatown (#21) is slightly greater than Some Like It Hot (#22) but not quite as great as Sunset Boulevard (#16), which itself falls just short of the greatness that is apparently found in 2001: A Space Odyssey (#15)?\n\nIn the end, I decided the rankings didn’t matter — which is why I watched the films mostly in random order — and I made peace with the fact that any list like this one is going to be compiled by human beings with their own preferences, biases and perspectives on what metrics to use when deciding how to measure a film’s greatness.\n\nDoes that mean the list is useless and I’ve wasted my time watching all the films on it? Not really. Because even if this isn’t a definitive “greatest films of all time” list, I feel like I still learned a lot about the history of film, and maybe learned a little bit about the filmmakers, scholars and critics who helped put together this list.\n\nSo without further ado, here’s what watching all 100 films has taught me about how to increase your odds of getting your own film on the next “greatest films” list put out by the AFI:\n\n(1) DRAMA, DRAMA, DRAMA. THEN ADD MORE DRAMA. Films that can be filed under “Drama” form a clear majority on the list; if you include the films that span across different genres (like the musical drama West Side Story, or films with both comedic and dramatic elements like Forrest Gump), then dramas take up just over half the list. This reflects the filmmaking community’s bias towards films with weighty themes (like In the Heat of the Night) or ones that use tragic historical events (like Schindler’s List) when telling a story. Nothing against comedies; dramas are just seen as having more prestige when it comes to awards time.\n\n(2) TELL A STORY ABOUT A FASCINATING REAL-LIFE FIGURE. Raging Bull, Bonnie and Clyde, Lawrence of Arabia, Yankee Doodle Dandy, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid — it doesn’t matter if your story is true to life or not, list-making juries eat up this kind of biopic stuff for the same reasons they love their dramas.\n\n(3) COMEDY IS FINE, BUT NONE OF THAT NEW-FANGLED GROSS-OUT STUFF. The list can’t get enough of early comedies like The General, It Happened One Night or all four of Charlie Chaplin’s films to make the list, but things get a little less funny as you go down through the years. The last 20 years of the century, representing about 20% of all the films on the list, only includes one flat-out comedy (Tootsie), though you could argue films like Toy Story and Pulp Fiction have their funny moments, too. Maybe it’s because comedy is harder to sell as “quality cinema” than drama, or maybe the people voting on these things just don’t find a lot of more modern films funny. In either case, if you’re entering a comedy in the competition, either go really dark (like Dr. Strangelove or Network) or have Woody Allen kvetch about life for two hours (Annie Hall).\n\n(4) FIND OUT WHEN THE LIST MAKERS STARTED OUT IN THEIR CAREERS, THEN TIME TRAVEL BACK TO THAT POINT. For the most part, the people behind the AFI list do a good job of spreading out their film choices so that there aren’t, say, 40 films from the ’40s. With the exception of the first three decades of the 20th century, each decade is represented fairly equally on the list, with one exception: the 1970s, with 20 films released between 1971-1980 on the list compared to the ’60s (15) and the ’80s (eight).\n\nThere’s a good argument to be made that the larger number of ’70s films is because that’s when most of the “New Hollywood” movement took place, a time when a new generation of young filmmakers (like Coppola, Scorsese, Forman, Cimino, Lucas) influenced by European and Japanese masters came along to experiment with the art form. On the other hand, it’s also easy to see how contemporaries and proteges of those directors — i.e., a lot of the people in senior positions in Hollywood today — would be more inclined to choose pictures by those filmmakers than earlier or later works.\n\n(5) CHANGE YOUR FIRST NAME TO “JOHN.” With five films to speak of, Steven Spielberg is the director with the most films on the list, followed by Alfred Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, and Stanley Kubrick at four apiece. But to really increase your odds of getting on the list? Change your name to John. John Ford, John Avildsen, John Huston, John Lasseter, John Schlesinger, Jonathan Demme — they’re all in there. There are also four Georges, four Roberts, four Williams/Billys, three Franks/Francises and three Michaels. Of course, the fact that there are zero female directors (and Spike Lee the only non-white one) might have something to do with the abundance of masculine names on the list.\n\nTo their credit, the AFI acknowledges on its website that “since its inception, American film has marginalized the diversity of voices that make our nation and its stories strong – and these lists reflect that intolerable truth.” Which I think is their way of saying that the AFI “greatest films” list for the 21st century will look very different from this one. And I for one can’t wait to see what that list will look like when it… wait, I have to make it through the next 79 years to see it? Dang it. Well, here’s hoping The Emoji Movie can pull a Citizen Kane and find a future audience that will recognize it for the groundbreaking film that it is. (It’s Sir Patrick Stewart! As a piece of poo! Comedy genius, I tell ya!)\n\nClocking in at three hours and 32 minutes, William Wyler’s epic film — an adaptation of Lew Wallace’s 1880 novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ — was filmed on location in Italy on a budget of $15 million, a record at the time. The famous chariot race scene alone took three weeks to shoot and used about 15,000 extras.\n\nBen-Hur would go on to win 11 Academy Awards, sweeping 11 of the 12 categories in which it was nominated, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (for Charlton Heston). Its box office was $147 million in its initial release, making it the highest-grossing film of 1959 and the second-highest-grossing film of all time up to that point, behind only Gone with the Wind.\n\nFun fact: Ben-Hur’s 11 Academy awards has never been bested by any other film, though Titanic (1997) and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) both tied with it. (That said, you could make the argument Ben-Hur’s wins count more, since there were fewer categories for films to be nominated in at the time.)\n\nNaturally, a movie this big deserved a big-time comic book to promote it, and in those days they didn’t come much bigger than Dell, purveyor of periodicals adapting many of the biggest films and TV shows of the day. Officially titled Four Color Comics #1052, this 1959 comic adaptation features a painted cover by Sam Savitt (an equine artist who did many Western covers for Dell) and interior art by Russ Manning, later of Magnus: Robot Fighter fame.\n\n(Annnnd…. cut.)"
