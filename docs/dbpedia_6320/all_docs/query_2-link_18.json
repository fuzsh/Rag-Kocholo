        "text": "For the Dynamite version of Vought, see Vought-American/Comics.\n\n“\n\nThat is our job, our honor. We are Vought. We make heroes super.\n\n”\n\n“\n\nToday's heroes. Tomorrow's future.\n\n―Vought's official slogan[1]\n\n”\n\nVought International, formerly known as Vought-American, is an American multi-billion[2] dollar superhero entertainment conglomerate, currently led by Homelander. The company is famous for founding The Seven and managing the global population of licensed Supes, as well as several other businesses industries including but not limited to TV networks, sports drink companies, music apps and fast-food chains. They are the overarching antagonists of the TV series and it's spin-offs, being an extremely corrupt corporation with aims for world domination.\n\nHistory[]\n\n“\n\nA world without crime, with liberty and justice for all, that's within our reach, thanks to the 200+ superheroes in the Vought family. We see a bright future ahead, where there is a Vought hero in every town.\n\n”\n\nFoundation[]\n\nVought American was founded after WW2 by Frederick Vought, a Nazi scientist whom Adolf Hitler himself appointed as the chief physician at the Dachau concentration camp in 1939 where he would perform unethical experimentation on human test subjects in order to develop Compound V to enhance human beings into what are now known as \"Supes\". Vought eventually created the first dose of Compound V and had his first successful superhero, his own wife, Klara Risinger, however, despite his success, Vought would never use Compound V to help the Nazi Party, since he realized that their defeat was certain. He soon defected from Nazi Germany and the Allied forces smuggled him and his wife to the US, where he would give his newly developed serum to military soldiers to increase their odds against the Nazis (with Soldier Boy being the most notable example).[4] This prompted President Franklin Roosevelt to pardon him in 1944 and allow him to continue his research on Compound V, a decision that would eventually end with Vought founding is own corporation to further the development of supes as an advanced race of living weapons.\n\nAfter Vought[]\n\nAt some point after Frederick's death, Stan Edgar would take over as CEO and continue the company's unethical practices. Compound V, by this point, is shrouded from the public, who are led to believe that supes are chosen by God. In reality, the serum was shipped across the US to hospitals by Samaritan's Embrace under the guise of medical supplies.\n\nVought's goal has always been to capitalize on supes, cutting deals with independent cities and states for protection; Madelyn Stillwell tried to offer Nubian Prince at a price of $300 million a year to the Mayor of Baltimore, however the deal was tanked by Homelander.[3] Another of the company's objectives was to get superheroes integrated into the military as private soldiers so that they can significantly increase their revenue through government contracts, despite the reality that supes are generally incompetent and lacking in discipline.\n\nDue to her good work, it was Edgar's wish that Stillwell replace him as CEO of Vought. However, things begin going awry after Homelander arranges for the creation of Supe Terrorists to create enemies only Vought had the means to combat, which results in Compound V being exposed to military personnel and the higher-ups during raids on terrorist compounds, resulting in major scrutiny towards Vought and Compound V being evaluated by the FDA.[5] In addition to this, Homelander, due to his growing mental instability, kills Stillwell upon learning that she had deceived him, putting Edgar's plan to retire on hold. After Compound V is exposed to the public, Vought places blame on Stillwell, using her as a scapegoat, but the exposure nonetheless causes Vought's stock to plummet down drastically.\n\nWith the growing popularity of Stormfront, Vought incites the public to possible Supe terrorist attacks, which leads to paranoia and xenophobia tainting the culture at large. Through fear-mongering, Vought manages to gain the necessary support to send Compound V supplements to law enforcement all across the country, however, before the first shipments of V can be sent out, Stormfront has her past as a Nazi exposed and leads to further distrust in Vought. After Stormfront is defeated by The Boys, Vought uses the exposed Stormfront as a scapegoat by saying she was the one who framed Starlight as a traitor, and Mr. Edgar announces that the shipments of Compound V have been permanently halted.\n\nAfter Edgar[]\n\nDespite Edgar's best efforts, his past crimes that he covered up were eventually made public by Victoria Neuman after she was blackmailed by Homelander, and Edgar was arrested as a consequence. With him ousted as CEO, Homelander took over the company for himself, while having Ashley Barrett as a figurehead CEO.\n\nUnder Homelander, the company would become more aggressive in their methods and their end goal would change from being merely financial to creating a Supe dictatorship for ideological reasons. To realize his plans, Homelander attempted to use Vice President-elect Victoria Neuman as a mole in the U.S. government with the end goal of killing the elected president and have Victoria become a puppet president through which he could rule over the entire nation as a dictator. While Neuman would end up abandoning the plan and getting herself killed by Billy Butcher, Vought still managed to achieve their goal by framing the elected president for her death, having him ousted from his position and replaced with a pro-Vought puppet president, whom then declared martial law and deputized Homelander, effectively making him the supreme commander-in-chief of the country, and Vought's extra-legal private army of superheroes, working alongside Vought's already existing separate corporate branch of private military contractor and company security forces, effectively transforming them into a government-sanctioned private secret paramilitary police force and with the full support and backing of federal military and police forces with all resources and armed forces/law enforcement personnel including military special forces units at their disposal operating as part of a joint task-force under Homelander's personal authority.[6]\n\nPrior to Homelander's takeover of the country, he and the Seven decided to purge Vought of any untrustworthy employees, especially those with any dirt on them, to prevent their plans from being ruined by potential traitors. To save herself, Ashley injected herself with Compound V before presumably running away for good, effectively making Homelander and Sage the official leaders of the company.\n\nCompany Culture[]\n\nVought International, in its conduct as a multinational corporation, is highly corrupt, extremely ruthless and willing to do anything if it means pleasing their stockbrokers. Their merciless quest to maintain their vast wealth and power often comes at the cost of the innocent lives they have ruined.\n\nThe vast majority of notable Vought employees have been shown to be personally corrupted, egocentric, amoral and nefarious individuals, among the known few people who aren't meekly cowered into submission by a culture of fear and intimidation. While at first glance, the company seems to care about being progressive and inclusive, it is nothing more than a thinly veiled façade. In reality, almost all of the individuals that hold positions of power within the company are either apathetic narcissists or abusive psychopaths.\n\nDespite the company’s corporate “wokeness” that it constantly proclaims in its marketing and products, Vought has serious racial equity and representation issues that it has never bothered to solve, alongside a long history of racism that appears to be persistent to this day (all the more concerning considering the company’s past ties to the Nazi party and its founding by a Nazi scientist). This is shown when it is revealed that 92% of their supes are Caucasian, whereas only 6% are African American and the last 2% are divided between Asians and Latinos, (this even despite Vought's past CEO Stan Edgar being of African ethnicity, he cared little to use his position advance the cause of racial equality for other people like himself, only interested in advancing and maintaining his own personal status).[7]\n\nIn addition to deeply ingrained, historical racial bias and ethnically hegemonic makeup of its collective, assorted lineup of supes, Vought also has notable problems with its unconscious, implied gender bias among its general attitudes towards its female employees, (even with multiple women like Ashley Barrett and Madelyn Stillwell, holding positions of leadership, as both have been shown to be more than willing to undermine and sabotaging other colleagues regardless of gender in order to further advance their own careers and personal interests), and treatment of female superheroines. Even while the company does not seem to have an overt and/or explicit glass ceiling barriers or obstacles that prevents ordinary human employees from attaining positions of power, this doesn't seem to extend to female superheroes, since according to Starlight, there was never a superhero team lead by a woman before she was appointed as the co-leader of The Seven.\n\nVought has been shown to have a culture of silence and denialism as well, where any criminal evidence their actions or rumors of wrongdoing by the superheroes they own is quickly covered up and quietly swept under the rug by any means necessary, whether it be: bribing victims to prevent them from speaking out,[3][7] scrubbing video footage off the internet[8] or even cleaning up crime scenes before the authorities show up and killing the witnesses of such crimes.[9] This culture also extends to the internal social structure of the company, with many employees (especially the higher-ups) having a decidedly indifferent and blasé attitude towards internal corruption, as seen when Stillwell apparently knew about The Deep's history of sexual misconduct, but decided not to do anything about it until Starlight publicly spoke out against him.\n\nEven though superheroes are expected to uphold the law and maintain public order, almost all of them are morally bankrupt and completely disinterested in helping anyone other than themselves. They are often more concerned about their public image and reputation, as such things have a huge effect on the acting roles and brand deals that are available to them. They are even willing to go as far as massacring an entire population if it advanced their corporate agenda like for example when they sent Black Noir on a mission in Indonesia to take out the protesting residents of a fishing village opposed to them expanding their company's interests into their regional area.\n\nThe only times Vought seems to care about corruption is when it becomes public knowledge and ends up affecting their stock value. However, the company will often try to find a scapegoat to avoid bad PR and escape the consequences of its actions, as seen when Stan Edgar blamed Kenji Miyashiro for Stormfront's massacre of a predominantly black residential building during a press conference about the incident.[10]\n\nMembers[]\n\nLeaders[]\n\nCurrent[]\n\nFormer[]\n\nDeceased[]\n\nStaff[]\n\nCurrent[]\n\nSeth Reed (Public Relations Writer)\n\nBarbara Findley (Project Director, Scientist)\n\nFormer[]\n\nStan Edgar (President/CEO; Ousted)\n\nThe Legend (Senior Vice President of Hero Management; Forced to Retired)\n\nBarbara (Head of Crime Analytics; Forced to Resign)\n\nSameer Shah (Head Researcher of R&D, Scientist; Fired)\n\nGecko (Research & Development Assistant; Fired)\n\nAshley Barrett (Previously demoted to lower-ranking position: Nominal CEO/Figurehead, Former Senior Vice President of Hero Management, Former Director of Talent Relations; Current whereabouts unknown)\n\nDeceased[]\n\nFrederick Vought † (Founder and Original CEO)\n\nMadelyn Stillwell † (Senior Vice President of Hero Management)\n\nBecca Butcher † (Senior Director of Digital Marketing; Declared Dead)\n\nMartin † (Deputy Project Director, Scientist)\n\nJonah Vogelbaum † (Chief Strategy Officer, Scientist; Retired)\n\nFrank † (Research Scientist)\n\nAnika † (Crime & Security Analyst)\n\nEvan Lambert † (Public Relations Writer)\n\nDoug Friedman † (Lawyer, Assistant)\n\nAlso Ashley † (Development Executive)\n\nBill Marsh † (Board of Directors Member)\n\nPat Willis † (Board of Directors Member)\n\nMaureen Nohrenberg † (Board of Directors Member)\n\nSuperhero Teams[]\n\nThe Seven\n\nHomelander (Chairman/President, Leader of the 7)\n\nThe Deep (Current Member, Former Head of Crime Analytics)\n\nFirecracker (Current Member)\n\nBlack Noir II (Current Member)\n\nSister Sage (Former De-Facto CEO, Former Member; Fired/Possibly Reinstated)\n\nStarlight (Former Co-Leader; Resigned)\n\nA-Train (Former Member; Quit)\n\nMister Marathon (Former Member; Retired)\n\nQueen Maeve (Former Member; Presumed Dead)\n\nLamplighter † (Former Member; Demoted)\n\nStormfront † (Former Member; Removed)\n\nSupersonic †\n\nBlack Noir †\n\nTranslucent †\n\nTeenage Kix\n\nA-Train (Former Member; Quit to join the 7)\n\nMesmer † (Former Member)\n\nPopclaw † (Former Member)\n\nSister Sage (Former Member; Later joined the 7)\n\nBig Game\n\nG-Men\n\nThe Devine\n\nGroundhawk (Retired)\n\nPayback (Disbanded)\n\nSoldier Boy (Former Leader)\n\nBlack Noir † (Former Member; Later joined the 7)\n\nCrimson Countess † (Former Member)\n\nGunpowder † (Former Sidekick for Soldier Boy)\n\nSwatto † (Former Member)\n\nMindstorm † (Former Member)\n\nTNT Twins † (Former Member)\n\nDepartments[]\n\nCrime Analytics Department: A subdivision dedicated to the analysis of crime statistics and the tracking and surveillance of specific individuals (especially superheros who have gone missing).[11] After The Deep was named as the new head, he fired everyone who had tweets that were critical of Homelander, leaving Anika as the only remaining staff. Later on, the Deep is removed from this position by Sage and Anika is killed by Homelander which, in turn, rendered this particular department of the company completely inactive.\n\nCrisis Management Team: A team whose job is to execute appropriate crisis response procedures whenever the company is under threat. They usually have to deal with the crimes and controversies caused by the irresponsible and careless behavior of the company's “heroes”.\n\nDigital Marketing Department: A division dedicated to dealing with the company's presence in an online environment. One of their duties is creating social media's accounts and profiles for the many superheroes of Vought.\n\nHero Management Department: A department dedicated to managing the many superheroes present in the company.

Creating a work environment that fosters professional growth, loyalty and collaboration is also their job.\n\nVought Special Services: A secret division of Vought International that specializes in cleaning up the messes left behind by supes, in other words, it's their job to get rid of incriminating evidence that is left behind everytime one of the company's heroes commits a crime.[9]\n\nSubsidiaries and Products[]\n\nEntertainment[]\n\nVought's primary source of revenue. By using their \"heroes\" as part of the advertisement, Vought has expanded their influence across every single form of entertainment, including movies, comics, video games, music and TV shows. Much of this media typically depicts a highly sanitized version of the company’s supes; presenting them as courageous, selfless, noble, and more in line with conventional, pop culture expectations of a superhero, rather than the depressing reality of most Vought-owned supes being either hedonistic celebrities or cold-blooded sociopaths. Stan Edgar had a desire to remove the company out of the entertainment business, since he believed that supes were never meant to be \"heroes\" and that they should be a \"serious company\".[9] However, Edgar’s plan was stopped by Homelander and Victoria after they scapegoated him for Vought’s criminal activities, resulting in him being let go from the company.\n\nComics and Magazines[]\n\nV-PLE: A weekly magazine that specializes in celebrity news.\n\nVought Comics: Responsible for the production and publication of superhero comics.\n\nVought Sports: A sports magazine known for its annual Super Swimsuit Spectacular issue.

However, despite the source of their success coming from the blue serum, the company started to neglect their original purpose overtime and put their focus on the entertainment industry instead. Under Homelander, Vought has ceased to produce Compound V and all remaining vials have been stored in his apartment.[13]\n\nCompound V: An alchemical super serum.

After the most recent, divisive presidential election and the constitutional coup that took place in its aftermath, Vought International has effectively seized power and taken full control of the U.S. government and their private army of deputized superheroes have been fully authorized after a national declaration of martial law to supress any dissent with complete impunity and take care of any subversive elements like Starlighters deemed to represent a major threat to national security by any means necessary.\n\nFormer Associates[]\n\nLiquid Death: A canned-water company. The Deep has done two commercials for the company, one where he advertises the product as an eco-friendly replacement for plastic water bottles (since aluminum cans are more recyclable and are less likely to end up in the oceans) and another one where he states that Liquid Death's canned-water is a preferable alternative to soda as it contains less sugar.\n\nEnemies[]\n\nVought has acquired enemies and rivals over time, among them:\n\nShining Light Liberation Army: A Philippines-based far-left terrorist organization that started committing attacks against the infrastructure and personnel of both Vought and the US government after the company's superheroes were given congressional approval to operate overseas as private contractors serving in the military and took part in killing of members and supporters of recognized terrorist groups, even going as far as the wholesale slaughtering of their entire families/innocent home villages in response to the group's actions, that had been supplied with Compound V by Homelander and A-Train. Their New York City clandestine activities/operations would later be shut down after its terrorist cell was effectively wiped out by The Boys members; Kimiko and Hughie.\n\nBremer and Bremmer Law Firm (B&B Law Firm): A law firm that has a history of filing lawsuits against Vought International on behalf of it's victims.\n\nFederal Bureau of Superhuman Affairs (FBSA): A government agency dedicated to dealing with supes who have committed crimes. However, there mission and purpose were undermined by the fact that it's director, Victoria Neuman, was secretly a double agent and adopted daughter of Vought's CEO Stan Edgar.\n\nRussia: After the involvement of American superheroes in the Cold War, anti-supe sentiment became very strong in Russia. Unlike the Americans, most Russians see supes in a negative way to the point that graffiti depicting supes as monsters is quite common in the country. Due to Russian hatred of superheroes, Vought products are also considered contraband, however the Russian media is still allowed to talk about superhero related topics. Besides that, the Russian military is also secretly studying Compound V, most likely so that they can gain an advantage over the USA in case of another war.\n\nCIA: America's premier foreign intelligence service, they had begun and undertook a dedicated effort to covertly weaken, reduce and/or otherwise eliminate Vought's influence on U.S politics through sabotage and other means like attempted assassination after it was revealed and brought to their attention that the V.P candidate was the head-popping Supe secretly working for Homelander.\n\nThe Boys: A team of vigilantes under the CIA with the mission of bringing down Vought International and The Seven.\n\nWalt Disney Company: A multi-billion-dollar mass media and entertainment corporation and one of the few remaining rivals that threatens Vought's position as the most powerful company in America.\n\nStarlighters: An anti-Vought/Homelander countermovement consisting of Starlight's progressive fans. Both before and after taking over America, Homelander began a personal crusade turned government-sponsored crackdown against the Starlighters, declaring them an existential threat to the whole nation.\n\nAntifa: A decentralized, anti-fascist political movement of different, loosely affiliated left-wing groups collectively opposed to various forms of discrimination, oppression and authoritarianism. Prior to taking over the country, Homelander tried to use Ryan to create a propaganda PSA to convince children to report their families, teachers and friends to the corporate-controlled authorities if they were supposedly a part of Antifa, as part of his efforts to get rid of any opposition to his rule.[15]\n\nFormer Enemies[]\n\nChemical Liberation Front: An eco-terrorist group who took a bunch of Cruz Chemical employees' hostage in an effort to stop the chemical plant from polluting their neighborhood with deadly substances. After the death of all the hostage takers that were present in the chemical plant, at the hands of Homelander, the group presumably does not exist anymore.[16]\n\nSoviet Union: During the Cold War, Vought's Payback and the CIA-backed Contras took part in a joint-covert mission codenamed: Operation Charly in Nicaragua. The mission ended in failure when the Soviet Spetsnaz and their Sandinistra allies raided the Contra's camp and massacred most of its inhabitants before capturing Soldier Boy who had been incapacitated by his fellow teammates after striking a deal with Stan Edgar to get rid of him. Vought also participated in America's propaganda efforts against the Soviets, producing multiple anti-communist films and even participating in congressional hearings during the Red Scare, with Soldier Boy testifying before the House Un-American Activities Committee against numerous purported communists within the US government.\n\nNazi Germany: Despite Frederick Vought originating from the country, Vought-American's first superheroes would (allegedly) fight against the German Wehrmacht in the last stages of World War II.\n\nWalter Milk & Associates: After Soldier Boy accidentally killed Marvin's grandfather, his father would spend years of his life fighting Vought to get proper justice. He believed that no one was above the law, and he would try to use his knowledge as a lawyer to defeat Vought at the court of law. However, he failed at achieving his goal and died at 55.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThere are a number of differences between the series version of Vought and its comic counterpart.\n\nThe comic version of Vought was known as Vought-American, whereas the show version is known as Vought International. As a nod to the comics, its revealed in flashbacks that the company was originally called Vought-American; the name was changed at some point between 1984 and the present, likely after the Cold War ended.\n\nIn the comics Vought was an incompetent arms company that hastily rebranded as a superhero company after recruiting Jonah Vogelbaum. The series version was founded by Nazi scientist-turned-businessman Fredrick Vought and was a 'superhero company' from the start.\n\nThe series' version is far more sinister then in the comics. While they were already highly amoral in the comics, covering up heroes' vicious actions and willing to kill those who step out of line, the series version was created as a secret Nazi conspiracy to build an 'army of Supermen' to take over the world; and have also been secretly practicing human experimentation for decades. Vought is even willing to experiment on children, as Homelander's origins reveal.\n\nThe company in the comics existed during World War II, during which time they manufactured aircrafts (similar to the real-world Vought corporation). In the TV series, they are not founded until after the war.\n\nA real company called Vought existed between the 1920s and the 1960s and was responsible for manufacturing many famous military planes. In the original The Boys comic series by Garth Ennis, one of the planes built by the fictional Vought company is called the F7U; this was also the name of a plane built by the real Vought company.\n\n[]\n\nVought International has many similarities with Veidt Enterprises from the original Watchmen miniseries, as both are international corporate conglomerates with a monopolistic hold on consumer products and mass media. They also coexist within superhero universes where they profit off the names and likenesses of supes through merchandising and entertainment in order to fund large-scale conspiracies (the deadly 11/2 Psychic Shockwave in Manhattan secretly conducted by Adrian Veidt from Watchmen and the true origins of superheroes and the coverup of the numerous crimes and atrocities committed by them on behalf of Vought International)."
