        "text": "Here we come to the end of the story of Michael J. Murphy, micro-budget filmmaker extraordinaire who started out knocking out amateur productions for personal gratification in the 1970s, broke into the home video market, navigated the shady world of distribution, and had reached a peak by the late 1980s and early 1990s. The years running up to 1999 were a little patchier, in part because of a perhaps misguided decision to shoot the Tristan and Iseult legend for a third time, but there was every reason to expect that he’d continue into the 2000s working on much the same basis as he had previously.\n\nIt was not to be. Disaster struck in 2001, when the master material from Skare disappeared after being popped in the post to get developed. Cutting corners wherever he could, as was his instinct, Murphy had just put it in the ordinary post without tracking, a blunder which changed the entire course of his career. Having lost some £10,000 on the venture – a sum it would take him much of the next decade to make good – and sorely disappointed the cast and crew on that production, Murphy was deeply embarrassed and hurt by this setback, and it would not be until 2004 that he’d find his way to recovering his mojo…\n\nRoxi\n\nRoxi (Mary-Anne Barlow) is the much younger new wife of business tycoon Charles Logan (Jeff Lovelock); she spends her days in a beautiful Greek tourist town, operating a bar named for her, whilst Charles jets around the world. Charles has a son by his previous marriage, Sean (Ross Maxwell), who’s not much younger than Roxi. Sean and Roxi have never met – he’d been a little estranged from his father, having been raised by his mother (June Blake) and then traumatised when she died five years ago in what the police wrote up as a burglary gone wrong. Now, however, all that is about to change, with Roxi expecting Sean to accompany Charles the next time he comes to Greece. However, when the day comes Sean is all on his own, saying that Charles no-showed at the airport.\n\nSean suggests that Charles is just being selfish and letting his business plans take priority over his family yet again; Roxi theorises that Charles ghosted them on purpose so Roxi and Sean can get to know each other without him around. Well, maybe that’s wishful thinking on her part. She certainly isn’t sad to see Sean swanning about the house shirtless – and is more than keen to get hands-on about applying some sunscreen to him, and getting him to return the favour.\n\nHowever, there’s something just a bit off about Sean. It’s perhaps no surprise that in unguarded moments he is bothered by flashes of his mother’s gruesome fate… but his mood swings certainly suggest he’s not processed that well. And why does he have these vivid intrusive thoughts or dreams centred around harming Roxi? Why, for that matter, does Sean deliberately pretending to be much drunker than he is when they go out drinking? Where is Charles? The answers to these questions may be a matter of life and death for Roxi…\n\nContinue reading “The Murphiad, Part 6: 2004-2015” →\n\nTime to go back to the coalface and keep working through Magic, Myth & Mutilation, Powerhouse/Indicator’s expansive blu-ray boxed set of the complete (extant) works of Michael J. Murphy. To recap where we’ve been so far – we’ve taken in Murphy’s often-fragmentary early work, saw him break his way into home video distribution, watched him navigate difficulties with distributors, and seen him enter perhaps his creative peak. Is that going to continue, or will we witness it derailing at some point during the 1990s? Let’s pick up our trusty 16mm cameras and find out…\n\nSecond Sight\n\nRaymond Heller (Patrick Olliver) is a dreamweaver and visionary in the vein of Garth Marenghi – in other words, a horror writer for the trashy paperback market. He’s been successful enough to set himself up in a plush house in the countryside with his significantly younger new wife Victoria (Amy Raasch). His life isn’t perfect, but its tensions are minor in the grand scheme of things – an accidental moment where Victoria got trapped in the cupboard under the stairs and had a claustrophobia-induced panic attack, a tense argument with his editor Madeline (Caroline MacDowell) over the movie rights to his books, a bit of writer’s block with his next project, no big deal.\n\nWell, maybe, maybe not. Victoria is certainly quite flirty with Nick (James Reynard), the manor house’s groundskeeper, whilst also being jealous of Nick’s close friendship with Tanith (Jude Flanagan), a local occultist and medium who he befriended when researching some of his more supernaturally-inclined novels. Then Sean (David Charles) arrives. Introducing himself to Ray as an old college pal of Victoria’s who decided to visit when he came to England on a business trip, Victoria’s marriage to a minor celebrity making it possible for Sean to track her down; in fact, he’s Victoria’s abusive ex-husband, who she came to England to get away from, a facet of her past which Victoria has never felt able to tell Ray about.\n\nOver dinner with Victoria and Sean, Ray explains how his finances are more constrained than authors of a similar level of popularity because of his refusal to sign away those film rights – but he’d be happy for Victoria, on inheriting the rights to his literary estate, to sign them over once he’s dead in order to support herself in her widowhood, prompting a brash discussion of how the situation could in and of itself be an apt setup for a murder mystery and how one might get away with it. After dinner, Sean tries to strongarm Victoria into being his accomplice in murdering Ray; when she refuses, they get into a fight, and she ends up stabbing him to death with a sharp pair of scissors.\n\nWith a sozzled Ray dead to the world, Victoria turns to Nick to clean everything up – but their shared secret intensifies the growing intimacy between them, and soon they are having an affair which threatens to destroy everything. Have they gotten away with it? Perhaps, perhaps not – Ray, for one thing, discovers a stray bit of blood caught in the hinge of the scissors that Victoria overlooked in cleanup, and Victoria is disturbed when Tanith claims to have perceived hints of a chain of tragic events occurring in the village. Is Tanith merely picking up unconsciously on Victoria and Nick’s guilt? Or does she have the gift of… Second Sight?\n\nContinue reading “The Murphiad, Part 5: 1991-1999” →\n\nYes, I’m still working my way through Powerhouse/Indicator’s epic blu-ray boxed set of the complete extant works of Michael J. Murphy, micro-budget multi-genre auteur director. The story so far: after spending the 1960s and 1970s honing his craft, Murphy broke into the home video market and began churning out material for it, though sharp practice on the part of distributors meant that he did not quite get the cut of the take he deserved (and the take was, admittedly, fairly modest).\n\nThings seem to have picked up around the time he made 1987’s Death Run, however. Jeanne Griffin – an old friend of his who’d appeared in his 1960s schoolboy effort Atlantis: City of Sin and played the role of Mary in 1981’s Death In the Family – was credited as a producer on that, and on a swathe of his following films; one wonders if she came into a bit of money at some point, or had perhaps developed business connections in her day job which would help with self-publishing the material or otherwise was able to help out, because we’re about to get into a period when Murphy started to gather something approximating success. Death Run itself did not get a particularly widespread release, but Murphy’s next movie would prove to be his biggest commercial success yet… Well, for micro-budget values of “big”.\n\nAvalon\n\nThe realms of sword and sorcery are being terrorised by the forces of Avalon – the island of magic ruled over by the cruel Morgana (Debbi Stevens). Over on the mainland, the heroic Owen (Stephen Harris) seeks word of King Arthur’s fate; in the process he encounters a druid gathering, whose high priest (Jon Morgan) intends to sacrifice the fair Clotilde (Abigail Blackmore) to gain magical protection from Morgana’s terrors – and then hack the hands off the young thief Kieran (Rob Bartlett) as punishment for trying to steal precious Druidic artifacts.\n\nOwen springs into action to save Clotilde and Kieran, and afterwards discovers that Clotilde has her own reasons for seeking Avalon – for her lover Edwin (Craig Hiller) has been spirited away there. At first, Kieran has no intention of following them to such an ill-rumoured place – but then they encounter Merlin (Patrick Olliver), who regales them with stories of the fabulous treasures to be found on Avalon, at which point Kieran changes his tune.\n\nIt is no easy feat to get to Avalon – but Merlin’s magic allows him, Owen, Clotilde, and Kieran to all swim to the enchanted isle. There Merlin parts ways with them on another errand with the Lady of the Lake (Caroline MacDowell), though promising that they shall have his aid when it counts. So the trio must face enchanted forests, cursed creatures, zombie soldiers, and all the other perils and wonders of… Avalon.\n\nContinue reading “The Murphiad, Part 4: 1988-1991” →\n\nThe story so far: after serving a long apprenticeship, Michael J. Murphy (and his found family of actors and crew) would find himself on the cusp of success, albeit success of a fairly modest sort. His Invitation To Hell – released first as a double bill with The Last Night, then standalone – gained some traction in the home video market, and suddenly people were paying attention. Death In the Family also got a limited release. Suddenly, it seemed like his work might actually commercially viable. Would Murphy succumb to the demands of the market and start churning out more conventional productions, with more professional production values, in response to this?\n\nHell, no.\n\nQuälen (AKA The Hereafter)\n\nNeville Harmer (Stephen Longhurst) and his partner Vicky (Caroline MacDowell) find their romance obstructed by Neville’s cantankerous, demanding father Alfred (Al Greer). Being disabled, Alfred requires Neville to act as his carer – even though a wealthy chap like Alfred could surely afford a professional caregiver. It’s all made more aggravating by the fact that Alfred refuses to leave his sprawling estate – indeed, for 30 years he’s not trod outside its bounds.\n\nOne day, after Alfred and Neville have an argument, the brakes on Alfred’s wheelchair fail, causing him to fall into the lake on the estate and drown. Everyone assumes it was an accident – indeed, all the eyewitnesses saw that Neville was well away from the chair when the brake failed, so there can be no question of him causing it. When the will is read, it turns out that Alfred left the whole estate to Neville, with the proviso that he can’t sell it and must live there for at least 11 months out of the year.\n\nThe Harwell estates is a sprawling country mansion complete with its own ghostly stories and legends, with surrounding lands and outbuildings, including a sawmill which brings a healthy income and some resident workers, like Patrick (Colin Efford) and Dorothy (Wendy Young), the Harmer company secretary who lives on a cottage on the estate. Having more people to hand is little help, however, when Neville starts to think the ghosts of the estate are stirring. Who knows, perhaps Vicky’s friend Sylvia (Yvette Gunter), a medium, might be able to sort everything out with a séance…\n\nContinue reading “The Murphiad, Part 3: 1983-1987” →\n\nLast time we dipped into the deep bench of work left behind by micro-budget director extraordinaire Michael J. Murphy, we went on a quick tour of his surviving work from the 1970s (and some fragments hailing from even earlier), much of which would have been simply impossible to find prior to Powerhouse releasing Magic, Myth & Mutilation, a comprehensive full-career retrospective.\n\nNow let’s plunge deeper into that boxed set and tackle Murphy’s work from the early 1980s. Here, we’re starting to enter the realm of projects which more than a tiny few might have actually seen before, because at least one production from this era got picked up in the home video boom and got more exposure than any of Murphy’s other early works…\n\nThe Cell\n\nIn medieval times, a condemned man (Russell Hall) is imprisoned, accused of being a serial killer – though he insists on his innocence, naturally. On the night before his execution, his jailer (Michael J. Murphy) lets a prostitute (Carol Aston) into his cell, the local tradition permitting a final conjugal visit. The prisoner is not interested in her services, so they talk, and she becomes convinced that he is innocent. Moved by his story, she is determined to help him – but the jailer won’t let her out of the cell until the morning…\n\nThis is a short film that was actually constructed as one. The 1970s movies I covered last time mostly have runtimes of 50-odd minutes – Secrets being an exception at 88 minutes – though it is perhaps tricky to tell how long those were meant to last; the movies this time around, aside from this one, also have runtimes in that under-an-hour range, but we can be more confident that they are in more or less complete forms.\n\nThis one, by comparison, comes in at a lean 14 minutes, and benefits from it – it’s basically a small character-driven piece, elevated by how well Murphy and the gang are able to realise its atmosphere through low-budget costume and set design. It’s got the same sort of “medieval costume by way of LARP gear” aesthetic which Tristan and Iseult had and which put me in mind of Hawk the Slayer when I watched that, and perhaps the passage of time meant current tastes started to align with the style of Murphy’s historicals and fantasies.\n\nIndeed, it’s with The Cell that Murphy started to actually get some recognition outside of his immediate social circle – it got a four-star award from Movie Maker magazine, a UK periodical aimed at the amateur filmmaking hobby, a pastime which Murphy was likely one of the most advanced practitioners of.\n\nMurphy himself appears more prominently on-camera than we’ve seen him before, and his performance is a bit hokier – though as the jailer it’s not a central role, and he does manage to get across an air of sleaziness. There’s a bit where he tells the prostitute that if she has trouble with the prisoner, she can call him in and he’d finish the job, and it’s genuinely unclear whether he means he’d fuck her or the prisoner, so if you’re looking for LGBT+ readings of his work, there you go.\n\nOf course, one of the reasons Murphy was able to produce these results was because of his coterie of regulars. Carol Aston was a regular of his late 1970s works, of course, and Caroline MacDowell, another frequent collaborator of the era, has a minor role here. The Cell also commences a run of appearances from Russell Hall, who would move on after Invitation To Hell. The short hinges on the interaction between Hall and Aston, and whilst their performances often veer more into amateur dramatics territory than the type of performance we’re used to seeing in movies, there’s something to it which elevates it to being more than the sum of its parts. Perhaps that’s why Murphy’s next movie put the chemistry between Aston and Hall at centre stage.\n\nContinue reading “The Murphiad, Part 2: 1980-1982” →\n\nOne of the most obscure directors working in British genre cinema was the Portsmouth-based veteran Michael J. Murphy. A film buff from a young age, his first productions essentially consisted of him and some of his school buddies having a bit of a lark, but even then involved more elaborate productions than you might expect of teenagers in the mid-1960s playing about with a camera. From the beginning, he seems to have had a knack for seeking out and recruiting like-minded collaborators; many of his cast and crew would come back to help out with multiple projects over the years, and the impression one gets in people’s recollections is of a genuinely beloved figure who created this found family around himself based on a shared love of the movies and a willingness to commit to the bit.\n\nTowards the end of his school days, his headmaster would make an effort to get him a placement with Elstree Studios so he could pursue a career in film, but Murphy would spend his subsequent years well outside of the mainstream British film industry. His early works would get extremely limited local showings – essentially seen only by friends and family, and via a few venues willing to give his material a chance – but come the 1980s the home video boom would change everything. Distributors were keen for any material they could put out there, and Murphy was only too happy to oblige – yielding some of the strangest straight-to-video movies of the era.\n\nMurphy would keep chugging along putting out movies for decades, and died shortly after the release of his 2015 film The Return of Alan Strange, and it’s a measure of the affection his film-making friends had for him that they’ve gone to significant lengths to ensure his legacy is preserved. Murlyn, the production company he ran alongside Phil Lyndon, a regular leading actor in his later productions, has gone to lengths to ensure that his movies are available – as well as making a range of his work available on Tubi, they’ve teamed up with Powerhouse and the Indicator blu-ray imprint to put out Magic, Myth & Mutilation: The Micro-Budget Cinema of Michael J. Murphy, which contains pretty much his entire canon in one box.\n\nPerhaps the rise of YouTube and amateur filmmaking on there has made this set especially timely. Just as Murphy was ahead of his time in terms of putting out cheap genre movies before the home video market was really there to take advantage of his output, he was also arguably a forerunner of anyone who’s ever grabbed a camera and made a zero-budget story for YouTube like the Marble Hornets guys and their peers. The US had a more substantial micro-budget cinema scene back in the day – as witnessed by releases like Vinegar Syndrome’s Home Grown Horrors and Arrow’s American Horror Project volumes 1 and 2 – but Murphy was charting a somewhat lonelier course in Britain, in part because we didn’t really have the sort of grindhouse cinemas that the US had, and his work as such verges on outsider art, perhaps disqualified only from that status only because of the number of collaborators he managed to sweep along with him.\n\nFor this first article going through the box, I’m going to take in the material from the 1970s included therein – all of which has needed a certain amount of reconstruction on the part of Powerhouse. The accompanying booklet is refreshingly blunt about the frustrations of the restoration process; as it turns out, Murphy was absolutely terrible when it came to archiving his stuff, and for budget reasons would often edit the source material directly rather than making copies. When it comes to his 1960s material, basically all that exists are a few snippets here and there; the 1970s movies can be presented in versions which more or less get across the idea of the stories in question, but are not as complete as they could be, since the original 16mm stock is incomplete and bits of the soundtrack have had to be reclaimed from various sources – or are outright lost.\n\nSome bits are taken from camcorder recordings made by Murphy in the 1980s, when he screened the films at home for the appreciation of family and friends, because these are simply the only sources for the bits in question; it says a lot both for Murphy’s knack with a camera and the skill of Powerhouse’s restorers that these bits are viable for use at all, but even so the occasional nose-dives in quality are quite evident.\n\nFrom the early 1980s onwards, Murphy’s material is available in much more complete forms – because the home video boom gave him an outlet to actually release the things to more than very limited-circulation screenings, so where all else failed those old tapes could be utilised to fill any gaps. But for this leg of the journey, we are in for a rocky path indeed, and none more rocky than the very first step on our trip through the Murphy dimension…\n\nContinue reading “The Murphiad, Part 1: 1970-1979” →"
