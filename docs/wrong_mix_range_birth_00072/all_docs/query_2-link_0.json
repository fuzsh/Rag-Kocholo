        "text": "American writer\n\nThis article is about the author. For the tennis player, see Cara Black.\n\nCara Black (born November 14, 1951)[1] is an American mystery writer. She is best known for the twenty-one novel mystery series featuring Aimée Leduc a female Paris-based private investigator,[2] as well as the thrillers Three Hours in Paris, a national bestseller, and Night Flight to Paris. Black is included in the Great Women Mystery Writers by Elizabeth Lindsay 2nd edition.[3] Her first novel Murder in the Marais was nominated for an Anthony Award for best first novel[4] and the third novel in the series, Murder in the Sentier, was Anthony-nominated for Best Novel.[3] Her books have been translated into German, Norwegian, Japanese, French, Spanish, Italian, and Hebrew.[citation needed]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nBlack was born in Chicago, Illinois on November 14, 1951. She was educated at Cañada College in California, Sophia University in Yotsuya, Tokyo in Japan, and finished her schooling at San Francisco State University where she earned a bachelor's and master's degrees in education.\n\nShe did not base her detective Aimée Leduc on a real person:\n\nI knew I couldn’t write as a French woman, I can’t even tie my scarf the right way,\" she says, \"but I grew up in a Francophile family; my father loved good food and wine, I attended a Catholic school with French nuns and I lived in Europe when I was younger. I interviewed three female detectives in Paris who ran their own detective agency and took qualities from each. It was important to me that Aimée be a young, contemporary woman like the Parisian women I know, have a strong fashion sense and be fierce in her pursuit of justice. The justice that eludes people sometimes in daily life. And that she know much more about computers than I do.[5]\n\nShe did not intend to write a series.\n\nI'd like to say I had a master plan but the series with Aimée Leduc has just evolved. \"In Murder in the Marais, my first book, I just wanted to tell the story of my friend's mother, a young Jewish girl who hid in the Marais during the German Occupation of Paris in WWII. My friend's mother was 14 years old and came home from school one day to find her family gone. She stayed in the apartment, went to school, hoping they would return. A year later, in 1944 at Liberation, she searched for them at the train stations, at the Hotel Lutetia on the Left Bank where the Red Cross had a terminus center for returning deportees and she found they’d gone to Auschwitz. My friend told me this story one day in the Marais and it touched me. Years later when I returned to Paris in the mid-1990s the story came back to me and I wanted to explore these issues of the past, lingering anti-Semitism and how war still touched every generation.[5]\n\nShe has worked as a preschool teacher and as director of a preschool.[1] Black lives in San Francisco with her husband, Jun Ishimuro, a bookseller. They have a son.[3][6]\n\nAwards\n\n[edit]\n\nAwards for Black's writing[7] Year Title Award Result Ref. 2000 Murder in the Marais Anthony Award for Best First Novel Finalist Macavity Award for Best First Novel Finalist [8] 2003 Murder in the Sentier Anthony Award for Best Novel Finalist 2014 Murder Below Montparnasse Left Coast Crime Calamari Award Finalist\n\nWorks\n\n[edit]\n\nAimée Leduc Series\n\n[edit]\n\nMurder in the Marais (1998), ISBN 1-56947-212-2.[9]\n\nMurder in Belleville (2000), ISBN 1-56947-279-3.[10]\n\nMurder in the Sentier (2002), ISBN 1-56947-331-5.[11]\n\nMurder in the Bastille (2003), ISBN 1-56947-364-1.[12]\n\nMurder in Clichy (2004), ISBN 1-56947-411-7.[13]\n\nMurder in Montmartre (2005), ISBN 1-56947-445-1.[14]\n\nMurder on the Ile Saint-Louis (2007), ISBN 1-56947-475-3.[15]\n\nMurder in the Rue de Paradis (2008), ISBN 1-56947-542-3.[16]\n\nMurder in the Latin Quarter (2009), ISBN 1-56947-541-5.[17]\n\nMurder in the Palais Royal (2010), ISBN 978-1-56947-883-7.[18]\n\nMurder in Passy (2011), ISBN 1-56947-882-1.[19]\n\nMurder at the Lanterne Rouge (2011), ISBN 978-1-61695-061-3.[20]\n\nMurder below Montparnasse (2013), ISBN 978-1-61695-215-0.[21]\n\nMurder in Pigalle (2014), ISBN 978-1-48296-837-8.[22]\n\nMurder on the Champ de Mars (2015), ISBN 978-1-61695-286-0.[23]\n\nMurder on the Quai (2016), ISBN 978-1-61695-678-3.[24]\n\nMurder in Saint-Germain (2017), ISBN 978-1-61695-770-4.[25]\n\nMurder on the Left Bank (2018), ISBN 978-1-61695-927-2.[26]\n\nMurder in Bel-Air (2019), ISBN 978-1-61695-930-2.[27]\n\nMurder at the Porte de Versailles (2022), ISBN 978-1-64129-043-2.[28]\n\nMurder at La Villette (2024), ISBN 978-1-64129-447-8.[29]\n\nOther Novels\n\n[edit]\n\nThree Hours in Paris (2020), ISBN 978-1-64129-041-8.[30]\n\nNight Flight to Paris (2023), ISBN 978-1-64129-355-6.[31]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
