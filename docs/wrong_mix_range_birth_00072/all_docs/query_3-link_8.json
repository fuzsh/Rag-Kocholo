        "text": "While based in San Francisco, mystery author Cara Black probably knows a lot more about certain aspects of Paris than most of us living here.\n\nHer national bestselling series featuring a half-French/half-American female detective has seen Black visiting Paris‚Äô sewers and morgue, talking to private eyes and river police, and constantly contemplating juicy new crimes for her ‚ÄúAim√©e Leduc investigations.‚Äù\n\nSince her first novel, 1999‚Äôs Murder in the Marais, Black has published a new book nearly every year, setting each one in a different Paris arrondissement.\n\nOn the occasion of the eleventh book, Murder in Passy, coming out next week\n\n(March 1), Black took time to answer some questions about her popular series.\n\nLucky for her fans, she still has nine arrondissements to go!\n\nParis is one of the most romanticized cities in the world; the beautiful City of Light. In your novels, however, it is the darker side of Paris that plays a starring role. Can you talk about why you chose Paris as the setting for your crime series? (And why the city keeps inspiring murder!)\n\nParis is layered with history, as you well know living there, yet it‚Äôs not a museum, but a living vibrant city with a traditional society still in place and a recent past of World War II, the Algerian conflict, colonialism in Indochina and all with a very French flavor. The intrigues since the time of the Kings and Royalty, the Revolution haven‚Äôt changed that much to present-day scandals which are more contemporary and relevant than we think. Love, money, revenge are eternal and what better place than in Paris?\n\nYou know the first murder mystery credit goes to Edgar Allen Poe ‚Äì an American ‚Äì for his Murder on the Rue Morgue set in Paris. There‚Äôs something elusive in Paris, a past that I feel can just about be grabbed if I scratch the surface enough and feel how it resonates today.\n\nYour female detective is half-French, half-American. How has giving Aim√©e this sort of outsider/insider perspective influenced how you‚Äôre able to tell the stories?\n\nDefinitely, as you know I‚Äôm not French and can‚Äôt even tie my scarf the right way. But as an outsider/insider Aim√©e exemplifies that character known as the ‚Äòlone detective‚Äô in crime fiction ‚Äì think Sam Spade, Phillip Marlowe, even Miss Marple ‚Äì that busybody trumping the police in crime in an English village ‚Äì but as a private detective one has an expertise, investigates yet is apart and views things from the outside that others miss.\n\nParis itself is like a living, breathing character in your books. I know you make regular trips to the city to dig deep for hidden, intriguing gems that will allow you to create such rich ambiance. Can you talk about the role research plays in writing your novels? You call your Aim√©e Leduc series ‚Äúinvestigations‚Äù; it‚Äôs almost as if you tackle your research this way, too.\n\nResearch is the BEST part of my job. It means I must go to Paris as I tell my husband üôÇ I‚Äôm lucky because I use frequent flyer miles, my friend lets me sleep on her Montmartre apartment couch in return for a little babysitting (she‚Äôs Parisienne has two children and a demanding job and I‚Äôve known her forever). This way I can research in the archives, in the caf√©s, interview police and private detectives and scout out real locations, from the sewers to the morgue. I keep notes, take photos, trace routes on maps where characters would really go, record conversations and noises in the cobbled streets and soak up as much atmosphere I can.\n\nMy books are set in the mid 90‚Äôs before Google came into being in 1998. Aim√©e still uses dial up, people pay in Francs but they had cell phones. I collected Paris phone books from that time (a whole suitcase full) so I get the streets, the shops and the details right. Newspapers from that time give me what‚Äôs on sale, world events and traffic jams in Paris. I‚Äôve spoken with the river police on the Seine about ‚Äòfloaters‚Äô ‚Äì those bodies recovered in the Seine ‚Äì and procedures. My computer security detective Aim√©e and her partner Ren√©, who‚Äôs a dwarf and computer hacker extraordinaire, are cutting edge in technology.\n\nTo me a gripping story is about the characters, how crime impacts them; the victim‚Äôs world and forensics and technology are tools. Every computer hacker I‚Äôve had the chance to talk with has said that technology is only as good as the user ‚Äì social engineering (chatting someone up, flirting, outwitting them) can get you a password, or beyond a computer‚Äôs firewall much faster than anything else. No system or laboratory is immune from the human element.\n\nHow did you go from never having written a novel before to publishing a new one nearly every year? Do the parameters of crime fiction in some way help with discipline? I find more and more that constraints can actually fuel creativity.\n\nWhen I wrote my first book, Murder in the Marais, I had no idea it would get published much less that I‚Äôd write a series. There was no master plan, the editor just asked me where Aim√©e‚Äôs next investigation would take place in Paris ‚Äì what district would she go to next. Dumbfounded I said ‚Äòwhat?‚Äô ‚ÄòYou are planning a series, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äô she asked. ‚ÄòOf course,‚Äô I lied. But I ran to the computer and grabbed my maps. It all just happened and I‚Äôm so grateful.\n\nCrime fiction does provide a framework, a structure to tell a story and provides discipline, you‚Äôre right. Aim√©e‚Äôs character arc grows, I hope, with each book. She‚Äôs on a journey in her investigation and there‚Äôs a personal journey too ‚Äì her missing mother, her father‚Äôs mysterious death in the bomb explosion in Place Vendome, her trouble with this attraction to bad boys‚Ä¶To me the vehicle is the crime genre and the most interesting part are the characters.\n\nIt seems you must be something of a sleuth to devise such intricate plots and gain access to otherwise private details. How have you been able to befriend everyone from police officers to private investigators ‚Äì and get them to spill their secrets?\n\nOver the years I‚Äôve built up contacts: PI‚Äôs, a Ministry official, lawyers, caf√© owners, branches in the Police who will talk to me‚Ä¶usually over a bottle of wine in the bistro. Amazing how the wine loosens their tongues!\n\nOften I‚Äôll run an idea, a plot line by them and ask ‚Äòcould this happen, what would you do, what‚Äôs procedure‚Äôs involved, in this case why was it handled this way, etc.‚Äô A retired Brigade Criminelle inspector who was in charge of the Princess Diana investigation spent hours with me. I was so touched and finally asked him ‚Äòwhy are you spending all this time with me?‚Äô ‚ÄòI want you to get it right,‚Äô he said.\n\nYou appear most drawn to ‚Äì as am I! ‚Äì the less touristy areas of Paris, and particularly on the Right Bank. As you‚Äôre on a roll with writing one novel per arrondissement, however, you will soon be tackling the Left Bank (though you have already written Murder in the Latin Quarter). Are you looking forward to trying to find the seedier side of some of the tonier Paris neighborhoods? How do you come up with the crimes you set in each neighborhood?\n\nI love to go window shopping ‚Äòwith‚Äô Aim√©e, hang out at the flea markets and think what vintage couture she‚Äôd find, what case she‚Äôd be working on, what bad boy she might be attracted to. It‚Äôs an evolving process to find out where she‚Äôll be in her life. To me she‚Äôs a contemporary young Parisienne who has office rent to pay, a business to run, a dog to walk on the quai lining the Seine and trouble with men. Yet, writing a series is a challenge, one I‚Äôm lucky to have, and I strive to keep it fresh for myself and the reader. To show a different slice of Paris, one off the beaten track unexplored by tourists.\n\nI find crime by lots of different sources: incidents in the newspaper, a story from a Brigade Criminelle inspector I interviewed, a curious story a friend tells me, the owner of the caf√© I frequent who confided once about his brother-in-law‚Äôs brush with the law etc. Every book comes from a kernel of truth, a real event.\n\nIs there anything in your background that tipped you off that you could think like a private eye? Or does Aim√©e simply allow you to be the superwoman you always wanted to be? üôÇ\n\nWell, I have difficulty running in heels over cobblestones, am deathly afraid of heights and so I let Aim√©e do all the difficult work üôÇ\n\nWhat is 1) the most challenging and 2) the most rewarding part of the writing process for you?\n\nI‚Äôm an eavesdropper, bad habit, but invaluable in my line of work. I think writers do that all the time.\n\nA line of dialogue or a mannerism for me can put a character onto the page. The challenge is to keep the character speaking more dialogue, being memorable and intrinsic to the plot and storyline. That‚Äôs true for me in every book. Especially in crime fiction and mysteries, as you probably know, everything happens for a reason, every detail could be a clue, a red herring, a false lead or a key to a sub plot and a suspect.\n\nThe most rewarding? Finishing a draft!\n\nAny advice for aspiring authors?\n\nWrite the story you are passionate to tell.\n\nThanks, Cara!\n\nYou can find out more about Cara Black by visiting her website.\n\nMurder in Passy comes out next week on March 1.\n\n‚ÄúAim√©e goes to the chic 16th arrondissement when murder strikes close to her godfather Morbier. He‚Äôs a suspect and to vindicate him her investigation leads to police corruption, radial Basques and a kidnapped Spanish princess.‚Äù\n\nTake a stroll with Cara in Paris as she points out different sites that play a role in her crime series:"
