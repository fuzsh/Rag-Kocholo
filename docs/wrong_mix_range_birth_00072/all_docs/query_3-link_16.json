        "text": "That sense of place permeated that story, the sounds, smells and textures of the street, the feeling of ghosts in the building, the layer of a new society over this past were part of the story and shaped Cara's future storytelling. The story also invoked questions of how past crimes affect the world we live in today.\n\nShe learned more about this neighborhood as she wrote her book, and developed a method of capturing place: not only does she research, she tapes street sounds - from the click of high heels to a snatch of conversation, sits in sidewalk cafes taking notes on her surroundings, talks with the flics (police) and other experts, and goes to Paris flea markets to buy things her characters might touch or have in a pocket or purse.\n\nShe now teaches writing workshops as well as writing a book a year (I can hardly wait to see which arrondissement we'll get to explore next March!). Her NYTimes and USAToday bestselling books have been on the bestseller list of nearly every major newspaper in the country, and are picks of lists like Indie Next, BookSense, and the Washington Post Best Books of the year. She is featured in Great Women Mystery Writers by Elizabeth Lindsay (2nd ed.), and has been nominated for Anthony, McCavity and shortlisted for the Northern California Independent Bookseller best novel awards."
