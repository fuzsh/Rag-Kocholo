        "meta_description": "Tephra Institute of Contemporary Art (Tephra ICA) is a non-profit, non-collecting institution committed to promoting innovative contemporary art and thinking. The word “tephra” – matter ejected from geothermal eruptions that lands upon, nourishes, and changes the surrounding environment - emphasizes the institution’s belief in the combustibility of creativity and the generation of ideas and growth that the arts can provide. \r\n\r\nWe are devoted to celebrating artists and value the power of art to broaden perspectives, start difficult conversations, and consider alternative ideas. We work with artists, galleries, institutions, universities, thought leaders, and collectors globally. We rely on a variety of funding sources for programming, including memberships, sponsorships, grants, donations, and other fundraising efforts.\r\n\r\nFormally known as Greater Reston Arts Center (GRACE), the idea of Tephra ICA emerged as the institution’s programs, audience, and impact continued to evolve. We proudly reside in Reston, Virginia, whose founder, Robert E. Simon, insisted that it should be a place welcoming to all people and that it prioritize the arts as essential to a well-rounded life.",

        "text": "Experience the visuals, sound, and emotion in a large-scale video installation by Ebony G. Patterson. Shown slowly in reverse, Patterson’s film portrays a trilogy of three men, each on a separate screen, dressing themselves while tears quietly roll down their cheeks. Like the triptych paintings often found on the altar pieces at the front of churches built during the Renaissance, these figures occupy a chapel-like space where viewers can sit and contemplate their presence.\n\nThe voice of a young boy reading the poem If We Must Die, by Jamaican-born Harlem Renaissance poet Claude McKay, frames the scene. McKay wrote his poem, published in 1919, following weeks of race riots dubbed the Red Summer, in which hundreds of African Americans were killed during attacks on Black communities in several cities across America. One hundred years later, Patterson reiterates McKay’s words as a soundtrack to her visually arresting work, exposing the continued vulnerability of Black bodies in our present society.\n\nExhibition organized by the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nBiography\n\nEbony G. Patterson's multilayered practice in painting, sculpture, installation, performance, and video uses beauty as a tool to address global social and political injustices.\n\nPatterson (b.1981, Kingston, Jamaica) received an MFA degree in Printmaking and Drawing from the Sam Fox School of Design & Visual Arts at Washington University St. Louis (2006) and a BFA in painting from Edna Manley College of Visual and Performing Arts in Kingston, Jamaica (2004). Patterson has taught at the University of Virginia; Edna Manley College School of Visual and Performing Arts; the University of Kentucky and was the Bill and Stephanie Sick Distinguished Visiting Professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Her major survey exhibition ...while the dew is still on the roses... opened at Pérez Art Museum Miami in 2018; then toured to Speed Art Museum, Louisville, KY (2019); and the Nasher Museum at Duke University, NC (2020).

Patterson will present a major site-specific exhibition of sculptural and horticultural installations at the New York Botanical Gardens opening Spring 2023 titled …things come to thrive…in the shedding…in the molding…. In fall of 2023 Patterson’s work was included in A Two Way Mirror: Double Consciousness in Contemporary Glass by Black Artists, Museum of Glass, Tacoma, WA.
