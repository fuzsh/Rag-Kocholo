        "text": "City in Ontario, Canada\n\nThis article is about the city in Ontario, Canada. For other uses, see Brampton (disambiguation).\n\nCity in Ontario, Canada\n\nBrampton is a city in the Canadian province of Ontario. It is part of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and is a lower-tier municipality within the Peel Region. The city has a population of 656,480 as of the 2021 Census, making it the ninth most populous municipality in Canada and the third most populous city in the Greater Golden Horseshoe urban area, behind Toronto and Mississauga.\n\nNamed after the town of Brampton in Cumberland, England, Brampton was incorporated as a village in 1853 and as a town in 1873, and became a city in 1974.[4]\n\nThe city was once known as \"The Flower Town of Canada\", a title referring to its abundance of greenhouses and strong floriculture industry in the 1860s.[5][6] It maintains the term \"Flower City\" as its slogan.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: History of Brampton\n\nBefore the arrival of British settlers, the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation held 648,000 acres (262,000 ha) of land north of the head of the Lake Purchase lands and extending to the unceded territory of the Chippewa of Lakes Huron and Simcoe.[7] European settlers began to arrive in the area in the 1600s. In October 1818, the chief of the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation signed Treaty 19, also known as the Ajetance Purchase,[8] surrendering the area to the British Crown.[4][7][9][10]\n\nPrior to the 1830s, most business in Chinguacousy Township took place at Martin Salisbury's tavern. One mile from the corner of Hurontario Street and the 5th Sideroad (now Main and Queen Streets in the centre of Brampton), William Buffy's tavern was the only significant building. At the time, the intersection was referred to as \"Buffy's Corners\". By 1834, John Elliott laid out the area in lots for sale, calling it \"Brampton\", which was soon adopted by others.[11]\n\nIn 1853, a small agricultural fair was set up by the newly initiated County Agricultural Society of the County of Peel and was held at the corner of Main and Queen streets.[citation needed] Grains, produce, roots, and dairy products were up for sale. Horses and cattle, along with other lesser livestock, were also sold at the market. This agricultural fair eventually became the modern Brampton Fall Fair.\n\nIn that same year, Brampton was incorporated as a village.[11] In 1866, the town became the county seat and the location of the Peel County Courthouse which was built in 1865â€“66; a three-storey County jail was added at the rear in 1867.\n\nEdward Dale, an immigrant from Dorking, England, established a flower nursery in Brampton[12] shortly after his arrival in 1863.[13] Dale's Nursery became the town's largest[12] and most prominent employer, developed a flower grading system,[13] and established a global export market for its products.[12] The company chimney was a town landmark,[13] until Brampton Town Council allowed it to be torn down in 1977.[13] At its height, the company had 140 greenhouses,[14] and was the largest cut flower business in North America,[15] producing 20 million blooms and introducing numerous rose and orchid varietals and species to the market.[15] It also spurred the development of other nurseries in the town. Forty-eight hothouse flower nurseries once did business in the town.[13][15]\n\nIn January 1867, Peel County separated from the County of York, a union which had existed since 1851.[16] By 1869, Brampton had a population of 1,800.[17] It was incorporated as a town in 1873.[11]\n\nA federal grant had enabled the village to found its first public library in 1887, which included 360 volumes from the Mechanic's Institute (established in 1858).[citation needed] In 1907, the library received a grant from the Carnegie Foundation, set up by United States steel magnate and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, to build a new, expanded library; it serves several purposes, featuring the Brampton Library. The Carnegie libraries were built on the basis of communities coming up with matching funds and guaranteeing maintenance.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1902, Sir William J. Gage (owner of Gage Publishing, a publishing house specializing in school textbooks) purchased a 3.25-acre (1.32 ha) portion of the gardens and lawns of the Alder Lea estate (now called Alderlea) that had been built on Main Street by Kenneth Chisolm in 1867 to 1870. (Chisholm, a merchant and founding father of Brampton, had been the Town reeve, then warden of Peel County, then MPP for Brampton and eventually, Registrar of Peel County.)[18] Gage donated 1.7 acres (0.69 ha) of the property to the town, with a specific condition that it be made into a park. Citizens donated $1,054 and the town used the funds to purchase extra land to ensure a larger park.[19][20]\n\nA group of regional farmers in Brampton had trouble getting insurance from city-based companies. After several meetings in Clairville Hall, they decided to found the County of Peel Farmers Mutual Fire Insurance Company.[citation needed] In 1955, when the company moved to its third and current location, 103 Queen Street West, it took the new name of Peel Mutual Insurance Company. It reigns as the longest-running company in modern Brampton. Harmsworth Decorating Centre was established in 1890, as Harmsworth and Son, operated out of the family's house on Queen Street West.[citation needed] The current location was purchased on September 1, 1904, after a fire destroyed their original store. Purchased for $1,400, the 24 Main Street South location is the longest-operating retail business in what is now Brampton.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1974, the two townships of Chinguacousy and Toronto Gore were incorporated into Brampton. The small pine added to the centre of the shield on the Brampton city flag represents Chinguacousy, honouring the Chippewa chief Shinguacose, \"The Small Pine.\" After this merger, outlying communities such as Bramalea, Heart Lake and Professor's Lake, Snelgrove, Tullamore, and Marysfield, were incorporated into the City, and in some instances further developed.\n\nIn 1963, the town established The Flower Festival of Brampton, based on the Rose Festival of Portland, Oregon, in the United States. It began to market itself as the Flower Town of Canada.[13]\n\nIn a revival of this theme, on June 24, 2002, the City Council established the \"Flower City Strategy\",[21][22] to promote a connection to its flower-growing heritage.[23] The intention was to inspire design projects and community landscaping to beautify the city, adopt a sustainable environmental approach, and to protect its natural and cultural heritage.[23] The Rose Theatre was named in keeping with this vision and is to serve as a cultural institution in the city.[13] In addition, the city participates in the national Communities in Bloom competition as part of that strategy.\n\nThe Old Shoe Factory, located on 57 Mill Street North, once housed the Hewetson Shoe Company. It was listed as a historical property under the Ontario Heritage Act in 2008. Today it is occupied by various small businesses. The lobby and hallways retain details from 1907. Walls are decorated with pictures and artifacts of local Brampton history and old shoemaking equipment.[24]\n\nA self-guided historical walking tour of downtown Brampton called \"A Walk Through Time\"[25] is available at Brampton City Hall and online at no cost.\n\nDevelopment of Bramalea\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Bramalea, Ontario\n\nPlanned as an innovative \"new town\", Bramalea was developed in the 1960s immediately east of the Town of Brampton in Chinguacousy Township. It was Canada's first satellite community developed by one of the country's largest real estate developers, Bramalea Limited.[26] The name \"Bramalea\" was created by the farmer William Sheard, who combined \"BRAM\" from Brampton, \"MAL\" from Malton (then a neighbouring town which is now part of the city of Mississauga), and \"LEA\", an Old English word meaning meadow or grassland. He sold the land to Brampton Leasing (the former name of the developer) and built one of Bramalea's first houses on Dixie Road.[citation needed]\n\nThe community was developed according to its detailed master plan, which included provisions for a parkland trail system and a \"downtown\" to include essential services and a shopping centre.[citation needed] The downtown's centrepiece was the Civic Centre, built in 1972 to include the city hall and library. Directly across Team Canada Drive, a shopping centre named Bramalea City Centre was built. These developments were connected by a long tunnel, planned to provide protection from winter weather. The tunnel has long since been closed due to safety issues.[citation needed]\n\nRegion of Peel\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1974, the Ontario provincial government decided to update Peel County's structure. It amalgamated several towns and villages into the new City of Mississauga. In addition, it created the present City of Brampton from the town and the greater portion of the Townships of Chinguacousy and Toronto Gore, and the northern extremity of Mississauga south of Steeles Avenue,[27] including Bramalea and the other communities such as Churchville, Claireville, Ebenezer, Victoria, Springbrook, Coleraine, and Huttonville. While only Huttonville and Churchville still exist as identifiable communities, other names like Claireville are re-emerging as names of new developments.[citation needed]\n\nThe province converted Peel County into the Regional Municipality of Peel. Brampton retained its role as the administrative centre of Peel Region, which it already had as county seat. The regional council chamber, the Peel Regional Police force, the public health department, and the region's only major museum, the Peel Art Gallery, Museum and Archives, are all located in Brampton.[citation needed]\n\nThis change had its critics among those with a strong sense of local identities. Bramptonians feared urban sprawl would dissolve their town's personality. Bramalea residents took pride in the built-from-scratch and organised structure that had come with their new satellite city and did not want to give it up. Others in Bramalea accept they are part of Brampton, and they make up a \"tri-city\" area: the original Brampton, Heart Lake, Bramalea.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1972, Chinguacousy built a new civic centre in Bramalea. Two years later, when Brampton and Chinguacousy merged, the new city's council was moved from its modest downtown Brampton locale to the Bramalea building. The library systems of Brampton and Chinguacousy were merged, resulting in a system of four locations.[citation needed]\n\nSome have questioned the future of Peel Region as encompassing all of Brampton, Mississauga, and Caledon. The Mississauga council, led by Mayor Hazel McCallion, voted to become a single-tier municipality and asked the provincial government to be separated from Peel Region. They argued the city has outgrown the need for a regional layer of government, and that Mississauga is being held back by supporting Brampton and Caledon with its municipal taxes.[citation needed]\n\nDevelopment as a city\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early 1980s, Cineplex Odeon closed the Capitol Theatre in Brampton. The City bought the facility in 1981 under the leadership of councillor Diane Sutter. It adapted the former vaudeville venue and movie house as a performing arts theatre, to be used also as a live music venue. It was renamed the Heritage Theatre. Renovations and maintenance were expensive.[citation needed] In 1983, Toronto consultants Woods Gordon reported to the City that, rather than continue \"pouring money\" into the Heritage, they should construct a new 750-seat facility with up-to-date features.[citation needed] This recommendation was adopted, and the city designated the 2005â€“06 season as the Heritage Theatre's \"grand finale\" season. The city funded construction of the new Rose Theatre, which opened in September 2006.[citation needed]\n\nCarabram was founded in 1982, the result of volunteers from different ethnic communities wanting to organize a festival celebrating diversity and cross-cultural friendship. The name was loosely related to Toronto's Caravan Festival of Cultures. Carabram's first event featured Italian, Scots, Ukrainian, and West Indian pavilions. By 2003, the fair had 18 pavilions attracting 45,000 visitors.[citation needed]\n\nBrampton has grown to become one of the most diverse cities in Canada. In 1996, the city was 13% South Asian and 8.2% black.[28] By 2016, the South Asian community grew significantly to represent 44.3% of the city's population, while the black population grew to 14%.[29] Responding to a growing multi-cultural population, the Peel Board of Education introduced evening English as a Second Language (ESL) classes at high schools. Originally taught by volunteers, the classes eventually were scheduled as daytime courses taught by paid instructors. In the 1980s, the public and Catholic board expanded its language programs, offering night classes in 23 languages. These were introduced due to requests by parents, who wanted their children to learn their ancestral languages and heritage.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Mayor Ken Whillans gained approval and funding for the construction of a new city hall in Brampton's downtown. The facility was designed by local architects and built on the site of a former bus terminal.[30] Whillians did not get to see the opening of the new hall in June 1991 because of his death in August 1990.[31][32] Its completion brought the municipal government back to downtown Brampton. The facility expanded in 2014 with the addition of a nine-storey tower at 41 George Street and is connected to the original building by a glass walkway called Heritage Way.[33]\n\nIn 1991, development of another new town, Springdale, began. In 1999, development started to appear as far north as the city's border with Caledon along Mayfield Road. The Region designated this border as the line of demarcation for urban development until 2021, although development already began spilling north of Mayfield in the late 2010s.[citation needed] Part of the boundary between Brampton and Vaughan is also nearly completely urbanized.[citation needed]\n\nChanges continue to reflect the growth of the city. In 1992 the City purchased the Brampton Fairgrounds, to be used for other development. The Agricultural Society relocated in 1997 outside the boundaries of the city to Heart Lake and Old School roads.[citation needed]\n\nBrampton's 2003 Sesquicentennial celebrations boosted community spirit, reviving the tradition of a summer parade (with 100 floats), and creating other initiatives.[citation needed] To commemorate the town's history, the city under Mayor Fennell reintroduced floral projects to the community. These have included more plantings around town, the revival in 2005 of the city Parade, and participation in the Canada Communities in Bloom project.[citation needed]\n\nCityscape\n\n[edit]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nBrampton has a total land area of 265 square kilometres (102 sq mi).
