        "text": "Sharpshooter Kate Rees returns to the City of Lights for a longer but no less harrowing mission than she had in Three Hours in Paris (2020).\n\nAfter losing her husband and daughter in a German airstrike, Kate wants nothing more than to avenge her family’s death on every Nazi within range. The skills with a rifle she developed growing up in rural Oregon paired with the ease of disguising her as a housewife or nurse make her a favorite sniper of the War Department’s Alfred Stepney. Before sending her back to Paris with the task of taking out Kurt Lange, Gen. Rommel’s right-hand man, Stepney reminds her to trust no one. But that warning places serious constraints on Black’s mission as a storyteller. As characters flash by—Dieter von Holz, the RAF pilot who ferries Kate to Paris; German double agent Jaro; Polish freedom fighter Odile; her liaison in Paris, Richards, who escorts her to British HQ in Cairo; her Cairo guide, Sasha; and shrewd belly dancer Nadira—Kate doesn’t really connect with anyone. If no one can be trusted, readers have no one to root for. Black packs lots of action and rich local color into her tale of danger. But without characters to invest in, readers may be left with what amounts to an album of travel photos: exotic and colorful but with nothing to harness the heart.\n\nStrictly for action/adventure fans.\n\nA young woman’s experience as a nurse in Vietnam casts a deep shadow over her life.\n\nWhen we learn that the farewell party in the opening scene is for Frances “Frankie” McGrath’s older brother—“a golden boy, a wild child who could make the hardest heart soften”—who is leaving to serve in Vietnam in 1966, we feel pretty certain that poor Finley McGrath is marked for death. Still, it’s a surprise when the fateful doorbell rings less than 20 pages later. His death inspires his sister to enlist as an Army nurse, and this turn of events is just the beginning of a roller coaster of a plot that’s impressive and engrossing if at times a bit formulaic. Hannah renders the experiences of the young women who served in Vietnam in all-encompassing detail. The first half of the book, set in gore-drenched hospital wards, mildewed dorm rooms, and boozy officers’ clubs, is an exciting read, tracking the transformation of virginal, uptight Frankie into a crack surgical nurse and woman of the world. Her tensely platonic romance with a married surgeon ends when his broken, unbreathing body is airlifted out by helicopter; she throws her pent-up passion into a wild affair with a soldier who happens to be her dead brother’s best friend. In the second part of the book, after the war, Frankie seems to experience every possible bad break. A drawback of the story is that none of the secondary characters in her life are fully three-dimensional: Her dismissive, chauvinistic father and tight-lipped, pill-popping mother, her fellow nurses, and her various love interests are more plot devices than people. You’ll wish you could have gone to Vegas and placed a bet on the ending—while it’s against all the odds, you’ll see it coming from a mile away.\n\nA dramatic, vividly detailed reconstruction of a little-known aspect of the Vietnam War.\n\nAre we not men? We are—well, ask Bigfoot, as Brooks does in this delightful yarn, following on his bestseller World War Z(2006).\n\nA zombie apocalypse is one thing. A volcanic eruption is quite another, for, as the journalist who does a framing voice-over narration for Brooks’ latest puts it, when Mount Rainier popped its cork, “it was the psychological aspect, the hyperbole-fueled hysteria that had ended up killing the most people.” Maybe, but the sasquatches whom the volcano displaced contributed to the statistics, too, if only out of self-defense. Brooks places the epicenter of the Bigfoot war in a high-tech hideaway populated by the kind of people you might find in a Jurassic Park franchise: the schmo who doesn’t know how to do much of anything but tries anyway, the well-intentioned bleeding heart, the know-it-all intellectual who turns out to know the wrong things, the immigrant with a tough backstory and an instinct for survival. Indeed, the novel does double duty as a survival manual, packed full of good advice—for instance, try not to get wounded, for “injury turns you from a giver to a taker. Taking up our resources, our time to care for you.” Brooks presents a case for making room for Bigfoot in the world while peppering his narrative with timely social criticism about bad behavior on the human side of the conflict: The explosion of Rainier might have been better forecast had the president not slashed the budget of the U.S. Geological Survey, leading to “immediate suspension of the National Volcano Early Warning System,” and there’s always someone around looking to monetize the natural disaster and the sasquatch-y onslaught that follows. Brooks is a pro at building suspense even if it plays out in some rather spectacularly yucky episodes, one involving a short spear that takes its name from “the sucking sound of pulling it out of the dead man’s heart and lungs.” Grossness aside, it puts you right there on the scene.\n\nA tasty, if not always tasteful, tale of supernatural mayhem that fans of King and Crichton alike will enjoy."
