Founded in 1994 by master choreographer Dwight Rhoden and the legendary Desmond Richardson, Complexions' foremost innovation is to remove boundaries, not reinforce them. The company blends methods, styles, and cultures from across the globe, and the result is a continually evolving form of dance that reflects the movement of our world — and all its cultures — as an interrelated whole.\n\nComplexions' artistic directors and company members teach master classes around the world to dancers of all levels, bringing the company's inventive vision of human movement to five continents, over 20 countries, and over 20 million television viewers.

Today, Complexions Contemporary Ballet represents one of the most recognized and respected performing arts brands in the world. It is poised to continue its mission of bringing unity to the world, one dance at a time.\n\nCOMPLEXIONS CONTEMPORARY BALLET STAFF\n\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nEverick Brown, Dwight Rhoden, Desmond Richardson, Carl Nelson, Sarah Picot, Felicia Swoope\n\nNATIONAL ADVISORY BOARD\n\nDebbie Allen, Angela Bassett, Elizabeth Roxas Dobrish, Susan Jaffe, Carmen de Lavallade, Lisa Niemi Swayze, Courtney B.
