        "meta_description": "Abstract. Land cover in sub-polar and alpine regions of northern and eastern\nEurope have already begun changing due to natural and anthropogenic changes\nsuch as afforestation. This will impact the regional climate and hydrology\nupon which societies in these regions are highly reliant. This study aims to\nidentify the impacts of afforestation/reforestation (hereafter\nafforestation) on snow and the snow-albedo effect and highlight potential\nimprovements for future model development. The study uses an ensemble of\nnine regional climate models for two different idealised experiments\ncovering a 30-year period; one experiment replaces most land cover in Europe\nwith forest, while the other experiment replaces all forested areas with\ngrass. The ensemble consists of nine regional climate models composed of\ndifferent combinations of five regional atmospheric models and six land\nsurface models. Results show that afforestation reduces the snow-albedo\nsensitivity index and enhances snowmelt. While the direction of change is\nrobustly modelled, there is still uncertainty in the magnitude of change.\nThe greatest differences between models emerge in the snowmelt season. One\nregional climate model uses different land surface models which shows\nconsistent changes between the three simulations during the accumulation\nperiod but differs in the snowmelt season. Together these results point to\nthe need for further model development in representing both grassâsnow and\nforestâsnow interactions during the snowmelt season. Pathways to\naccomplishing this include (1)Â a more sophisticated representation of forest\nstructure, (2)Â kilometre-scale simulations, and (3)Â more observational studies\non vegetationâsnow interactions in northern Europe.",

Samantaray, Priscilla A. Mooney, and Carla A. Vivacqua\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 3321–3339, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3321-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-3321-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAny interpretation of climate model data requires a comprehensive evaluation of the model performance. Numerous error metrics exist for this purpose, and each focuses on a specific aspect of the relationship between reference and model data. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation demands the use of multiple error metrics. However, this can lead to confusion. We propose a clustering technique to reduce the number of error metrics needed and a composite error metric to simplify the interpretation.\n\nStorylines of Summer Arctic climate change constrained by Barents-Kara Sea and Arctic tropospheric warming for climate risks assessment\n\nXavier Levine, Ryan Williams, Gareth Marshall, Andrew Orr, Lise Seland Graff, DÃ¶rthe Handorf, Alexey Karpechko, Raphael KÃ¶hler, RenÃ© Wijngaard, Nadine Johnston, Hanna Lee, Lars Nieradzik, and Priscilla Mooney\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2741,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2741, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhile the most recent climate projections agree that the Arctic is warming, there remains differences in how much and in other climate variables such as precipitation. This presents a challenge for stakeholders who need to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies. We tackle this problem by using the storyline approach to generate four plausible and actionable realisations of end-of-century climate change for the Arctic, spanning its most likely range of variability.\n\nLandâatmosphere interactions in sub-polar and alpine climates in the CORDEX flagship pilot study Land Use and Climate Across Scales (LUCAS) modelsÂ â PartÂ 1: Evaluation of the snow-albedo effect\n\nAnne Sophie Daloz, Clemens Schwingshackl, Priscilla Mooney, Susanna Strada, Diana Rechid, Edouard L.

Together with climate change, rising temperatures are already altering snow in many ways. In this context, it is crucial to better understand the ability of climate models to represent snow and snow processes. This work focuses on Europe and shows that the melting season in spring still represents a challenge for climate models and that more work is needed to accurately simulate snow–atmosphere interactions.\n\nComparing rain-on-snow representation across different observational methods and a regional climate model\n\nHannah Ming Siu Vickers, Priscilla Mooney, Eirik Malnes, and Hanna Lee\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2022-57,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2022-57, 2022\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRain-on-snow (ROS) events are becoming more frequent as a result of a warming climate, and can have significant impacts on nature and society. Accurate representation of ROS events is need to identify where impacts are greatest both now and in the future. We compare rain-on-snow climatologies from a climate model, ground and satellite radar observations and show how different methods can lead to contrasting conclusions and interpretation of the results should take into account their limitations.\n\nAfforestation impact on soil temperature in regional climate model simulations over Europe\n\nGiannis Sofiadis, Eleni Katragkou, Edouard L.

In our study, we examine the differences in soil temperature and moisture between grounds covered either by forests or grass. The main conclusion emerged is that forest-covered grounds are cooler but drier than open lands in summer. Therefore, afforestation disrupts the seasonal cycle of soil temperature, which in turn could trigger changes in crucial chemical processes such as soil carbon sequestration.\n\nModelling a tropical-like cyclone in the Mediterranean Sea under present and warmer climate\n\nShunya Koseki, Priscilla A. Mooney, William Cabos, Miguel Ãngel Gaertner, Alba de la Vara, and Juan Jesus GonzÃ¡lez-AlemÃ¡n\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 53–71, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-53-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-53-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigated one case of a tropical-like cyclone over the Mediterranean Sea under present and future climate conditions with a regional climate model. A pseudo global warming (PGW) technique is employed to simulate the cyclone under future climate, and our simulation showed that the cyclone is moderately strengthened by warmer climate. Other PGW simulations where only ocean and atmosphere are warmed reveal the interesting results that both have counteracting effects on the cyclone.\n\nInfluences of Lake Malawi on the spatial and diurnal variability of local precipitation\n\nShunya Koseki and Priscilla A. Mooney\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2795–2812, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2795-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2795-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study revealed that Lake Malawi plays an important role for local precipitation in terms of spatial distribution and diurnal cycle in boreal summer (November to March). The diurnal cycle is detected by harmonics analysis and empirical orthogonal function analysis. An idealized simulation of WRF without Lake Malawi clearly showed that Lake Malawi is a source of local precipitation.\n\nMulti-model assessment of climatologies in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere using the IAGOS data\n\nYann Cohen, Didier Hauglustaine, Nicolas Bellouin, Marianne Tronstad Lund, Sigrun Matthes, Agnieszka Skowron, Robin Thor, Ulrich Bundke, Andreas Petzold, Susanne Rohs, ValÃ©rie Thouret, Andreas Zahn, and Helmut Ziereis\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2208,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2208, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe chemical composition of the atmosphere near the tropopause is a key parameter for evaluating the climate impact of subsonic aviation pollutants. This study uses in-situ data on board passenger aircraft to assess the ability of 5 chemistry-climate models to reproduce (bi-)decadal climatologies in ozone, carbon monoxide, water vapour, and reactive nitrogen in this region. The models reproduce well the very distinct ozone seasonality in the upper troposphere and in the lower stratosphere.\n\nWeak surface temperature effects of recent reductions in shipping SO2 emissions, with quantification confounded by internal variability\n\nDuncan Watson-Parris, Laura J.

These aerosols previously had a cooling effect, which the regulations might reduce, revealing more greenhouse gas warming. Here we find that while there is regional warming, the global 2020–2040 temperature rise is only +0.03°C. This small change is difficult to distinguish from natural climate variability, indicating the regulations have had a limited effect on observed warming to date.\n\nRobust handling of extremes in quantile mapping – \"Murder your darlings\"\n\nPeter Berg, Thomas Bosshard, Denica Bozhinova, Lars BÃ¤rring, Joakim LÃ¶w, Carolina Nilsson, Gustav Strandberg, Johan SÃ¶dling, Johan Thuresson, Renate Wilcke, and Wei Yang\n\nGeosci.

The end result is highly dependent on the method used, and we show that one needs to exclude data in the calibration range to activate the extrapolation functionality also in that time period, else there will be discontinuities in the timeseries.\n\nBergen metrics: composite error metrics for assessing performance of climate models using EURO-CORDEX simulations\n\nAlok K.

Climate models often feature a spatial resolution which is too coarse to investigate snow depth. Here, we analyse high-resolution simulations and identify added value compared to a coarser-resolution state-of-the-art product. Also, daily snow depth extremes are well reproduced by two models.\n\nConnection of Surface Snowfall Bias to Cloud Phase Bias – Satellite Observations, ERA5, and CMIP6\n\nFranziska Hellmuth, Tim Carlsen, Anne Sophie Daloz, Robert Oscar David, and Trude Storelvmo\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-754,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-754, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis article compares the occurrence of supercooled liquid-containing clouds (sLCCs) and their link to surface snowfall in CloudSat-CALIPSO, ERA5, and CMIP6 models. Significant discrepancies were found, with ERA5 and CMIP6 consistently overestimating sLCC and snowfall frequency. This bias is likely due to cloud microphysics parameterization. This conclusion has implications for accurately representing cloud phase and snowfall in future climate projections.\n\nCICERO Simple Climate Model (CICERO-SCM v1.1.1) – an improved simple climate model with a parameter calibration tool\n\nMarit Sandstad, Borgar Aamaas, Ane Nordlie Johansen, Marianne Tronstad Lund, Glen Peters, BjÃ¸rn Hallvard Samset, Benjamin M. Sanderson, and Ragnhild Bieltvedt Skeie\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-196,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-196, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe CICERO-SCM has existed as a FORTRAN model since 1999 and consists of a part that calculates radiative forcing and concentrations from emissions, and an upwelling diffusion energy balance model of the ocean that calculates temperature change. In this paper we describe an updated version ported to python and publicly available at https://github.com/ciceroOslo/ciceroscm (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10548720). This version contains functionality for parallel runs and automatic calibration.\n\nThe effect of forest cover changes on the regional climate conditions in Europe during the period 1986â2015\n\nMarcus Breil, Vanessa K. M. Schneider, and Joaquim G. Pinto\n\nBiogeosciences, 21, 811–824, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-811-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-811-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe general impact of afforestation on the regional climate conditions in Europe during the period 1986–2015 is investigated. For this purpose, a regional climate model simulation is performed, in which afforestation during this period is considered, and results are compared to a simulation in which this is not the case. Results show that afforestation had discernible impacts on the climate change signal in Europe, which may have mitigated the local warming trend, especially in summer in Europe.\n\nObservationally constrained analysis of sulfur cycle in the marine atmosphere with NASA ATom measurements and AeroCom model simulations\n\nHuisheng Bian, Mian Chin, Peter R. Colarco, Eric C. Apel, Donald R. Blake, Karl Froyd, Rebecca S. Hornbrook, Jose Jimenez, Pedro Campuzano Jost, Michael Lawler, Mingxu Liu, Marianne Tronstad Lund, Hitoshi Matsui, Benjamin A. Nault, Joyce E. Penner, Andrew W. Rollins, Gregory Schill, Ragnhild B. Skeie, Hailong Wang, Lu Xu, Kai Zhang, and Jialei Zhu\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 24, 1717–1741, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1717-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-1717-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work studies sulfur in the remote troposphere at global and seasonal scales using aircraft measurements and multi-model simulations. The goal is to understand the sulfur cycle over remote oceans, spread of model simulations, and observation–model discrepancies. Such an understanding and comparison with real observations are crucial to narrow down the uncertainties in model sulfur simulations and improve understanding of the sulfur cycle in atmospheric air quality, climate, and ecosystems.\n\nHigh-resolution projections of ambient heat for major European cities using different heat metrics\n\nClemens Schwingshackl, Anne Sophie Daloz, Carley Iles, Kristin Aunan, and Jana Sillmann\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 331–354, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-331-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-331-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAmbient heat in European cities will substantially increase under global warming, as projected by three heat metrics calculated from high-resolution climate model simulations. While the heat metrics consistently project high levels of ambient heat for several cities, in other cities the projected heat levels vary considerably across the three heat metrics. Using complementary heat metrics for projections of ambient heat is thus important for assessments of future risks from heat stress.\n\nHigh-resolution downscaling of CMIP6 Earth system and global climate models using deep learning for Iberia\n\nPedro M. M. Soares, Frederico Johannsen, Daniela C. A. Lima, Gil Lemos, VirgÃ­lio A. Bento, and Angelina Bushenkova\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 229–259, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-229-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-229-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study uses deep learning (DL) to downscale global climate models for the Iberian Peninsula. Four DL architectures were evaluated and trained using historical climate data and then used to downscale future projections from the global models. These show agreement with the original models and reveal a warming of 2 ºC to 6 ºC, along with decreasing precipitation in western Iberia after 2040. This approach offers key regional climate change information for adaptation strategies in the region.\n\nModeling and evaluating the effects of irrigation on landâatmosphere interaction in southwestern Europe with the regional climate model REMO2020âiMOVE using a newly developed parameterization\n\nChristina Asmus, Peter Hoffmann, Joni-Pekka PietikÃ¤inen, JÃ¼rgen BÃ¶hner, and Diana Rechid\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 7311–7337, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-7311-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-7311-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIrrigation modifies the land surface and soil conditions. The effects can be quantified using numerical climate models. Our study introduces a new irrigation parameterization, which simulates the effects of irrigation on land, atmosphere, and vegetation. We applied the parameterization and evaluated the results in terms of their physical consistency. We found an improvement in the model results in the 2 m temperature representation in comparison with observational data for our study.\n\nStorylines of Summer Arctic climate change constrained by Barents-Kara Sea and Arctic tropospheric warming for climate risks assessment\n\nXavier Levine, Ryan Williams, Gareth Marshall, Andrew Orr, Lise Seland Graff, DÃ¶rthe Handorf, Alexey Karpechko, Raphael KÃ¶hler, RenÃ© Wijngaard, Nadine Johnston, Hanna Lee, Lars Nieradzik, and Priscilla Mooney\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2741,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2741, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhile the most recent climate projections agree that the Arctic is warming, there remains differences in how much and in other climate variables such as precipitation. This presents a challenge for stakeholders who need to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies. We tackle this problem by using the storyline approach to generate four plausible and actionable realisations of end-of-century climate change for the Arctic, spanning its most likely range of variability.\n\nExtrapolation is not enough: Impacts of extreme land-use change on wind profiles and wind energy according to regional climate models\n\nJan Wohland, Peter Hoffmann, Daniela C. A. Lima, Marcus Breil, Olivier Asselin, and Diana Rechid\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2533,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2533, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluate how winds change when humans grow or cut down forests. Our analysis draws from climate model simulations with extreme scenarios where Europe is either fully forested or covered with grass. We find that the effect of land-use change on wind energy is very important: wind energy potentials are twice as high above grass as compared to forest in some locations. Our results imply that wind profile changes should be better incorporated in climate change assessments for wind energy.\n\nAssessment of isoprene and near-surface ozone sensitivities to water stress over the Euro-Mediterranean region\n\nSusanna Strada, Andrea Pozzer, Graziano Giuliani, Erika Coppola, Fabien Solmon, Xiaoyan Jiang, Alex Guenther, Efstratios Bourtsoukidis, Dominique SerÃ§a, Jonathan Williams, and Filippo Giorgi\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 13301–13327, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13301-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-13301-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWater deficit modifies emissions of isoprene, an aromatic compound released by plants that influences the production of an air pollutant such as ozone. Numerical modelling shows that, during the warmest and driest summers, isoprene decreases between −20 and −60 % over the Euro-Mediterranean region, while near-surface ozone only diminishes by a few percent. Decreases in isoprene emissions not only happen under dry conditions, but also could occur after prolonged or repeated water deficits.\n\nDevelopment and comprehensive analysis of spatially resolved technological high resolution (0.1°×0.1°) Emission Inventory of Particulate Matter for India: A step Towards Air Quality Mitigation\n\nSaroj Kumar Sahu, Poonam Mangaraj, Gufran Beig, Marianne T.

Data Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2023-310,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2023-310, 2023\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nElevated emission of particulate matter is not limited to urban areas, led to poor air quality across the country. Emission Inventory is the first line of defensive tools for air quality management and understanding and identification of the source of pollutants. The present work is an attempt to develop a high-resolution (~10 km) national inventory of particulate pollutants in India for 2020 using IPCC methodology. The developed dataset is vital piece of information for mitigation strategies.\n\nHigh-resolution land use and land cover dataset for regional climate modelling: historical and future changes in Europe\n\nPeter Hoffmann, Vanessa Reinhart, Diana Rechid, Nathalie de Noblet-DucoudrÃ©, Edouard L. Davin, Christina Asmus, Benjamin Bechtel, JÃ¼rgen BÃ¶hner, Eleni Katragkou, and Sebastiaan Luyssaert\n\nEarth Syst. Sci.

Historical and projected future land use change information from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) dataset is translated into annual plant functional type changes from 1950 to 2015 and 2016 to 2100, respectively, by employing a newly developed land use translator.\n\nThe Regional Aerosol Model Intercomparison Project (RAMIP)\n\nLaura J.

Persad, Steven T. Rumbold, Toshihiko Takemura, Kostas Tsigaridis, Sabine Undorf, and Daniel M. Westervelt\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 4451–4479, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-4451-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-4451-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChanges in anthropogenic aerosol emissions have strongly contributed to global and regional climate change. However, the size of these regional impacts and the way they arise are still uncertain. With large changes in aerosol emissions a possibility over the next few decades, it is important to better quantify the potential role of aerosol in future regional climate change. The Regional Aerosol Model Intercomparison Project will deliver experiments designed to facilitate this.\n\nDid the Bronze Age deforestation of Europe affect its climate? A regional climate model study using pollen-based land cover reconstructions\n\nGustav Strandberg, Jie Chen, Ralph Fyfe, Erik KjellstrÃ¶m, Johan LindstrÃ¶m, Anneli Poska, Qiong Zhang, and Marie-JosÃ© Gaillard\n\nClim. Past, 19, 1507–1530, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-1507-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-19-1507-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe impact of land use and land cover change (LULCC) on the climate around 2500 years ago is studied using reconstructions and models. The results suggest that LULCC impacted the climate in parts of Europe. Reconstructed LULCC shows up to 1.5 Â°C higher temperature in parts of Europe in some seasons. This relatively strong response implies that anthropogenic LULCC that had occurred by the late prehistoric period may have already affected the European climate by 2500 years ago.\n\nImpacts and damages of the European multi-year drought and heat event 2018–2022 on forests, a review\n\nFlorian Knutzen, Paul Averbeck, Caterina Barrasso, Laurens M.

This is a research approach that transcends subject and country borders.\n\nThe potential of an increased deciduous forest fraction to mitigate the effects of heat extremes in Europe\n\nMarcus Breil, Annabell Weber, and Joaquim G. Pinto\n\nBiogeosciences, 20, 2237–2250, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2237-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-2237-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA promising strategy for mitigating burdens of heat extremes in Europe is to replace dark coniferous forests with brighter deciduous forests. The consequence of this would be reduced absorption of solar radiation, which should reduce the intensities of heat periods. In this study, we show that deciduous forests have a certain cooling effect on heat period intensities in Europe. However, the magnitude of the temperature reduction is quite small.\n\nImplications of differences between recent anthropogenic aerosol emission inventories for diagnosed AOD and radiative forcing from 1990 to 2019\n\nMarianne Tronstad Lund, Gunnar Myhre, Ragnhild Bieltvedt Skeie, BjÃ¸rn Hallvard Samset, and Zbigniew Klimont\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 6647–6662, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6647-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6647-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we show that differences, in magnitude and trend, between recent global anthropogenic emission inventories have a notable influence on simulated regional abundances of anthropogenic aerosol over the 1990–2019 period. This, in turn, affects estimates of radiative forcing. Our findings form a basis for comparing existing and upcoming studies on anthropogenic aerosols using different emission inventories.\n\nThe biogeophysical effects of idealized land cover and land management changes in Earth system models\n\nSteven J. De Hertog, Felix Havermann, Inne Vanderkelen, Suqi Guo, Fei Luo, Iris Manola, Dim Coumou, Edouard L. Davin, Gregory Duveiller, Quentin Lejeune, Julia Pongratz, Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, Sonia I.

We investigate the climate effects of cropland expansion, afforestation, irrigation and wood harvesting using three Earth system models. Results show that these have important implications for surface temperature where the land cover and/or management change occur and in remote areas. Idealized afforestation causes global warming, which might offset the cooling effect from enhanced carbon uptake.\n\nThe extremely hot and dry 2018 summer in central and northern Europe from a multi-faceted weather and climate perspective\n\nEfi Rousi, Andreas H.

A combination of favorable large-scale conditions and locally dry soils were related with the intensity and persistence of the events. We also showed that such extremes have become more likely due to anthropogenic climate change and might occur almost every year under +2 °C of global warming.\n\nThe impact of lateral boundary forcing in the CORDEX-Africa ensemble over southern Africa\n\nMaria Chara Karypidou, Stefan Pieter Sobolowski, Lorenzo Sangelantoni, Grigory Nikulin, and Eleni Katragkou\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 1887–1908, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1887-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-1887-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSouthern Africa is listed among the climate change hotspots; hence, accurate climate change information is vital for the optimal preparedness of local communities. In this work we assess the degree to which regional climate models (RCMs) are influenced by the global climate models (GCMs) from which they receive their lateral boundary forcing. We find that although GCMs exert a strong impact on RCMs, RCMs are still able to display substantial improvement relative to the driving GCMs.\n\nThe response of the regional longwave radiation balance and climate system in Europe to an idealized afforestation experiment\n\nMarcus Breil, Felix Krawczyk, and Joaquim G. Pinto\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 243–253, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-243-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-243-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide evidence that biogeophysical effects of afforestation can counteract the favorable biogeochemical climate effect of reduced CO2 concentrations. By changing the land surface characteristics, afforestation reduces vegetation surface temperatures, resulting in a reduced outgoing longwave radiation in summer, although CO2 concentrations are reduced. Since forests additionally absorb a lot of solar radiation due to their dark surfaces, afforestation has a total warming effect.\n\nVortex streets to the lee of Madeira in a kilometre-resolution regional climate model\n\nQinggang Gao, Christian Zeman, Jesus Vergara-Temprado, Daniela C. A. Lima, Peter Molnar, and Christoph SchÃ¤r\n\nWeather Clim.

The algorithm enabled us to obtain a climatology of vortex shedding from Madeira Island for a 10-year simulation period. This first objective climatological analysis of vortex streets shows consistency with observed atmospheric conditions. The analysis shows a pronounced annual cycle with an increasing vortex shedding rate from April to August and a sudden decrease in September.\n\nThe biogeophysical effects of idealized land cover and land management changes in Earth system models\n\nSteven J.

Here, we apply machine learning (ML) models in order to estimate the influence of various environmental and demographic risk factors. The resulting ML models can accurately reproduce observed annual variability in MI and inter-annual trends. The models allow quantification of the importance of individual factors and can be used to project future risk.\n\nAssessment of the Paris urban heat island in ERA5 and offline SURFEX-TEB (v8.1) simulations using the METEOSAT land surface temperature product\n\nMiguel Nogueira, Alexandra Hurduc, Sofia Ermida, Daniela C.

They were compared with observations (satellite and in situ). The SURFEX-TEB runs showed the best performance in representing the UHI, reducing its bias significantly. We demonstrate the ability of the SURFEX-TEB framework to simulate urban climate, which is crucial for studying climate change in cities.\n\nLandâatmosphere interactions in sub-polar and alpine climates in the CORDEX flagship pilot study Land Use and Climate Across Scales (LUCAS) modelsÂ â PartÂ 1: Evaluation of the snow-albedo effect\n\nAnne Sophie Daloz, Clemens Schwingshackl, Priscilla Mooney, Susanna Strada, Diana Rechid, Edouard L.

Together with climate change, rising temperatures are already altering snow in many ways. In this context, it is crucial to better understand the ability of climate models to represent snow and snow processes. This work focuses on Europe and shows that the melting season in spring still represents a challenge for climate models and that more work is needed to accurately simulate snow–atmosphere interactions.\n\nHow to develop new digital knowledge transfer products for communicating strategies and new ways towards a carbon-neutral Germany\n\nSwantje Preuschmann, Tanja Blome, Knut GÃ¶rl, Fiona KÃ¶hnke, Bettina Steuri, Juliane El Zohbi, Diana Rechid, Martin Schultz, Jianing Sun, and Daniela Jacob\n\nAdv.

As such products are still unstandardised, the authors explored challenges and approaches for product developments. The authors report what they see as useful principles for developing digital knowledge transfer products, by describing the experience of developing the Net-Zero-2050 Web-Atlas and the \"Bodenkohlenstoff-App\".\n\nInvited perspectives: A research agenda towards disaster risk management pathways in multi-(hazard-)risk assessment\n\nPhilip J.

In the international research and policy community it is recognised that risk management could benefit from a more systemic approach. In this perspective paper, we argue for an approach that addresses multi-hazard, multi-risk management through the lens of sustainability challenges that cut across sectors, regions, and hazards.\n\nPrecipitation over southern Africa: is there consensus among global climate models (GCMs), regional climate models (RCMs) and observational data?\n\nMaria Chara Karypidou, Eleni Katragkou, and Stefan Pieter Sobolowski\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 3387–3404, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3387-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3387-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe region of southern Africa (SAF) is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and is projected to experience severe precipitation shortages in the coming decades. Reliable climatic information is therefore necessary for the optimal adaptation of local communities. In this work we show that regional climate models are reliable tools for the simulation of precipitation over southern Africa. However, there is still a great need for the expansion and maintenance of observational data.\n\nHigh-resolution land use and land cover dataset for regional climate modelling: a plant functional type map for Europe 2015\n\nVanessa Reinhart, Peter Hoffmann, Diana Rechid, JÃ¼rgen BÃ¶hner, and Benjamin Bechtel\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 14, 1735–1794, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-1735-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-1735-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe LANDMATE plant functional type (PFT) land cover dataset for Europe 2015 (Version 1.0) is a gridded, high-resolution dataset for use in regional climate models. LANDMATE PFT is prepared using the expertise of regional climate modellers all over Europe and is easily adjustable to fit into different climate model families. We provide comprehensive spatial quality information for LANDMATE PFT, which can be used to reduce uncertainty in regional climate model simulations.\n\nComparing rain-on-snow representation across different observational methods and a regional climate model\n\nHannah Ming Siu Vickers, Priscilla Mooney, Eirik Malnes, and Hanna Lee\n\nThe Cryosphere Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2022-57,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2022-57, 2022\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRain-on-snow (ROS) events are becoming more frequent as a result of a warming climate, and can have significant impacts on nature and society. Accurate representation of ROS events is need to identify where impacts are greatest both now and in the future. We compare rain-on-snow climatologies from a climate model, ground and satellite radar observations and show how different methods can lead to contrasting conclusions and interpretation of the results should take into account their limitations.\n\nAdded value of EURO-CORDEX high-resolution downscaling over the Iberian Peninsula revisited â Part 1: Precipitation\n\nJoÃ£o AntÃ³nio Martins Careto, Pedro Miguel Matos Soares, Rita Margarida Cardoso, Sixto Herrera, and JosÃ© Manuel GutiÃ©rrez\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 2635–2652, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2635-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2635-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work focuses on the added value of high-resolution models relative to their forcing simulations, with a recent observational gridded dataset as a reference, covering the entire Iberian Peninsula. The availability of such datasets with a spatial resolution close to that of regional climate models encouraged this study. For precipitation, most models reveal added value. The gains are even more evident for precipitation extremes, particularly at a more local scale.\n\nAdded value of EURO-CORDEX high-resolution downscaling over the Iberian Peninsula revisited â Part 2: Max and min temperature\n\nJoÃ£o AntÃ³nio Martins Careto, Pedro Miguel Matos Soares, Rita Margarida Cardoso, Sixto Herrera, and JosÃ© Manuel GutiÃ©rrez\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 2653–2671, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2653-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2653-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work focuses on the added value of high-resolution models relative to their forcing simulations, with an observational gridded dataset as a reference covering the Iberian Peninsula. The availability of such datasets with a spatial resolution close to that of regional models encouraged this study. For the max and min temperature, although most models reveal added value, some display losses. At more local scales, coastal sites display important gains, contrasting with the interior.\n\nImpacts of a revised surface roughness parameterization in the Community Land Model 5.1\n\nRonny Meier, Edouard L. Davin, Gordon B. Bonan, David M. Lawrence, Xiaolong Hu, Gregory Duveiller, Catherine Prigent, and Sonia I. Seneviratne\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 2365–2393, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2365-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2365-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe revise the roughness of the land surface in the CESM climate model. Guided by observational data, we increase the surface roughness of forests and decrease that of bare soil, snow, ice, and crops. These modifications alter simulated temperatures and wind speeds at and above the land surface considerably, in particular over desert regions. The revised model represents the diurnal variability of the land surface temperature better compared to satellite observations over most regions.\n\nAgricultural management effects on mean and extreme temperature trends\n\nAine M. Gormley-Gallagher, Sebastian Sterl, Annette L. Hirsch, Sonia I. Seneviratne, Edouard L. Davin, and Wim Thiery\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 419–438, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-419-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-419-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur results show that agricultural management can impact the local climate and highlight the need to evaluate land management in climate models. We use regression analysis on climate simulations and observations to assess irrigation and conservation agriculture impacts on warming trends. This allowed us to distinguish between the effects of land management and large-scale climate forcings such as rising CO2 concentrations and thus gain insight into the impacts under different climate regimes.\n\nAfforestation impact on soil temperature in regional climate model simulations over Europe\n\nGiannis Sofiadis, Eleni Katragkou, Edouard L. Davin, Diana Rechid, Nathalie de Noblet-Ducoudre, Marcus Breil, Rita M. Cardoso, Peter Hoffmann, Lisa Jach, Ronny Meier, Priscilla A. Mooney, Pedro M. M. Soares, Susanna Strada, Merja H. TÃ¶lle, and Kirsten Warrach Sagi\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 595–616, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-595-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-595-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAfforestation is currently promoted as a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy. In our study, we examine the differences in soil temperature and moisture between grounds covered either by forests or grass. The main conclusion emerged is that forest-covered grounds are cooler but drier than open lands in summer. Therefore, afforestation disrupts the seasonal cycle of soil temperature, which in turn could trigger changes in crucial chemical processes such as soil carbon sequestration.\n\nModeling reservoir surface temperatures for regional and global climate models: a multi-model study on the inflow and level variation effects\n\nManuel C. Almeida, Yurii Shevchuk, Georgiy Kirillin, Pedro M. M. Soares, Rita M. Cardoso, JosÃ© P. Matos, Ricardo M. Rebelo, AntÃ³nio C. Rodrigues, and Pedro S. Coelho\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 173–197, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-173-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-173-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we have evaluated the importance of the input of energy conveyed by river inflows into lakes and reservoirs when modeling surface water energy fluxes. Our results suggest that there is a strong correlation between water residence time and the surface water temperature prediction error and that the combined use of process-based physical models and machine-learning models will considerably improve the modeling of air–lake heat and moisture fluxes.\n\nImproving the stomatal resistance, photosynthesis and two big leaf algorithms for grass in the regional climate model COSMO-CLM\n\nEvgenii Churiulin, Vladimir Kopeikin, Markus Ãbel, JÃ¼rgen Helmert, Jean-Maria Bettems, and Merja Helena TÃ¶lle\n\nBiogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2021-294,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2021-294, 2021\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur research is an important step towards a more realistic representation of vegetation in regional climate models. We have implemented in COSMO-CLM the new algorithms for stomatal resistance, leaf photosynthesis and two-big leaf. We applied the modern phenology algorithms of CLM model and fully adapted them for COSMO-CLM. The personal software was created for validation COSMO-CLM results. The research also brought out many tensions, which we are going to update in our next developments.\n\nAerosol absorption in global models from AeroCom phase III\n\nMaria Sand, BjÃ¸rn H. Samset, Gunnar Myhre, Jonas GliÃ, Susanne E. Bauer, Huisheng Bian, Mian Chin, Ramiro Checa-Garcia, Paul Ginoux, Zak Kipling, Alf KirkevÃ¥g, Harri Kokkola, Philippe Le Sager, Marianne T.

Tsyro, and Duncan Watson-Parris\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 15929–15947, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15929-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15929-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAbsorption of shortwave radiation by aerosols can modify precipitation and clouds but is poorly constrained in models. A total of 15 different aerosol models from AeroCom phase III have reported total aerosol absorption, and for the first time, 11 of these models have reported in a consistent experiment the contributions to absorption from black carbon, dust, and organic aerosol. Here, we document the model diversity in aerosol absorption.\n\nCompeting effects of aerosol reductions and circulation changes for future improvements in Beijing haze\n\nLiang Guo, Laura J. Wilcox, Massimo Bollasina, Steven T. Turnock, Marianne T. Lund, and Lixia Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 15299–15308, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15299-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-15299-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSevere haze remains serious over Beijing despite emissions decreasing since 2008. Future haze changes in four scenarios are studied. The pattern conducive to haze weather increases with the atmospheric warming caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases. However, the actual haze intensity, measured by either PM2.5 or optical depth, decreases with aerosol emissions. We show that only using the weather pattern index to predict the future change of Beijing haze is insufficient.\n\nCOSMO-CLM regional climate simulations in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) framework: a review\n\nSilje Lund SÃ¸rland, Roman Brogli, Praveen Kumar Pothapakula, Emmanuele Russo, Jonas Van de Walle, Bodo Ahrens, Ivonne Anders, Edoardo Bucchignani, Edouard L.

M. van Lipzig, Seung-Ki Min, Hans-JÃ¼rgen Panitz, Burkhardt Rockel, Christoph SchÃ¤r, Christian Steger, and Wim Thiery\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 5125–5154, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5125-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5125-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe review the contribution from the CLM-Community to regional climate projections following the CORDEX framework over Europe, South Asia, East Asia, Australasia, and Africa. How the model configuration, horizontal and vertical resolutions, and choice of driving data influence the model results for the five domains is assessed, with the purpose of aiding the planning and design of regional climate simulations in the future.\n\nApplying an isotope-enabled regional climate model over the Greenland ice sheet: effect of spatial resolution on model bias\n\nMarcus Breil, Emanuel Christner, Alexandre Cauquoin, Martin Werner, Melanie Karremann, and Gerd SchÃ¤dler\n\nClim. Past, 17, 1685–1699, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1685-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1685-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFor the first time an isotope-enabled regional climate simulation for Greenland is performed for the mid-Holocene. Simulation results are compared with observed isotope ratios in ice cores. Compared to global climate simulations, a regional downscaling improves the agreement with measured isotope concentrations. Thus, an isotope-enabled regional climate simulation constitutes a useful supplement to reconstruct regional paleo-climate conditions during the mid-Holocene in Greenland.\n\nHigh-resolution land-use land-cover change data for regional climate modelling applications over Europe – Part 2: Historical and future changes\n\nPeter Hoffmann, Vanessa Reinhart, Diana Rechid, Nathalie de Noblet-DucoudrÃ©, Edouard L. Davin, Christina Asmus, Benjamin Bechtel, JÃ¼rgen BÃ¶hner, Eleni Katragkou, and Sebastiaan Luyssaert\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2021-252,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2021-252, 2021\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper introduces the new high-resolution land-use land-cover change dataset LUCAS LUC historical and future land use and land cover change dataset (Version 1.0), tailored for use in regional climate models. Historical and projected future land use change information from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) dataset is translated into annual plant functional type changes from 1950 to 2015 and 2016 to 2100, respectively, by employing a newly developed land use translator.\n\nCO2-equivalence metrics for surface albedo change based on the radiative forcing concept: a critical review\n\nRyan M. Bright and Marianne T. Lund\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 9887–9907, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-9887-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-9887-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHumans affect the reflective properties (albedo) of Earth's surface and the amount of solar energy that it absorbs, in turn affecting climate. In recent years, a variety of climate metrics have been applied to characterize albedo perturbations in terms of their CO2-equivalent effects, despite the lack of scientific consensus surrounding the methods behind them. We review these metrics, evaluate their (de)merits, provide guidance for future application, and suggest avenues for future research.\n\nResponses of Arctic black carbon and surface temperature to multi-region emission reductions: a Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution Phase 2 (HTAP2) ensemble modeling study\n\nNa Zhao, Xinyi Dong, Kan Huang, Joshua S. Fu, Marianne Tronstad Lund, Kengo Sudo, Daven Henze, Tom Kucsera, Yun Fat Lam, Mian Chin, and Simone Tilmes\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 8637–8654, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-8637-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-8637-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBlack carbon acts as a strong climate forcer, especially in vulnerable pristine regions such as the Arctic. This work utilizes ensemble modeling results from the task force Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution Phase 2 to investigate the responses of Arctic black carbon and surface temperature to various source emission reductions. East Asia contributed the most to Arctic black carbon. The response of Arctic temperature to black carbon was substantially more sensitive than the global average.\n\nIdentification of droughts and heatwaves in Germany with regional climate networks\n\nGerd SchÃ¤dler and Marcus Breil\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 28, 231–245, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-28-231-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-28-231-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used regional climate networks (RCNs) to identify past heatwaves and droughts in Germany. RCNs provide information for whole areas and can provide many details of extreme events. The RCNs were constructed on the grid of the E-OBS data set. Time series correlation was used to construct the networks. Network metrics were compared to standard extreme indices and differed considerably between normal and extreme years. The results show that RCNs can identify severe and moderate extremes.\n\nWeather extremes over Europe under 1.5 and 2.0 Â°C global warming from HAPPI regional climate ensemble simulations\n\nKevin Sieck, Christine Nam, Laurens M. Bouwer, Diana Rechid, and Daniela Jacob\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 457–468, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-457-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-457-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents new estimates of future extreme weather in Europe, including extreme heat, extreme rainfall and meteorological drought. These new estimates were achieved by repeating model calculations many times, thereby reducing uncertainties of these rare events at low levels of global warming at 1.5 and 2 °C above pre-industrial temperature levels. These results are important, as they help to assess which weather extremes could increase at moderate warming levels and where.\n\nThe importance of horizontal model resolution on simulated precipitation in Europe â from global to regional models\n\nGustav Strandberg and Petter Lind\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 2, 181–204, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-2-181-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-2-181-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPrecipitation is a key climate variable with a large impact on society but also difficult to simulate as it depends largely on temporal and spatial scales. We look here at the effect of model resolution on precipitation in Europe, from coarse-scale global model to small-scale regional models. Higher resolution improves simulated precipitation generally, but individual models may over- or underestimate precipitation even at higher resolution.\n\nWhat determines the sign of the evapotranspiration response to afforestation in European summer?\n\nMarcus Breil, Edouard L. Davin, and Diana Rechid\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 1499–1510, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-1499-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-1499-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe physical processes behind varying evapotranspiration rates in forests and grasslands in Europe are investigated in a regional model study with idealized afforestation scenarios. The results show that the evapotranspiration response to afforestation depends on the interplay of two counteracting factors: the transpiration facilitating characteristics of a forest and the reduced saturation deficits of forests caused by an increased surface roughness and associated lower surface temperatures.\n\nModelling a tropical-like cyclone in the Mediterranean Sea under present and warmer climate\n\nShunya Koseki, Priscilla A. Mooney, William Cabos, Miguel Ãngel Gaertner, Alba de la Vara, and Juan Jesus GonzÃ¡lez-AlemÃ¡n\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 53–71, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-53-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-53-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigated one case of a tropical-like cyclone over the Mediterranean Sea under present and future climate conditions with a regional climate model. A pseudo global warming (PGW) technique is employed to simulate the cyclone under future climate, and our simulation showed that the cyclone is moderately strengthened by warmer climate. Other PGW simulations where only ocean and atmosphere are warmed reveal the interesting results that both have counteracting effects on the cyclone.\n\nAeroCom phase III multi-model evaluation of the aerosol life cycle and optical properties using ground- and space-based remote sensing as well as surface in situ observations\n\nJonas GliÃ, Augustin Mortier, Michael Schulz, Elisabeth Andrews, Yves Balkanski, Susanne E.

Considerable diversity is found in the simulated aerosol species emissions and lifetimes, also resulting in a large diversity in the simulated aerosol mass, composition, and optical properties. A comparison with observations suggests that, on average, current models underestimate the direct effect of aerosol on the atmosphere radiation budget.\n\nBiases in the albedo sensitivity to deforestation in CMIP5 models and their impacts on the associated historical radiative forcing\n\nQuentin Lejeune, Edouard L. Davin, GrÃ©gory Duveiller, Bas Crezee, Ronny Meier, Alessandro Cescatti, and Sonia I. Seneviratne\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 1209–1232, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-1209-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-1209-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTrees are darker than crops or grasses; hence, they absorb more solar radiation. Therefore, land cover changes modify the fraction of solar radiation reflected by the land surface (its albedo), with consequences for the climate. We apply a new statistical method to simulations conducted with 15 recent climate models and find that albedo variations due to land cover changes since 1860 have led to a decrease in the net amount of energy entering the atmosphere by −0.09 W m2 on average.\n\nA complex aerosol transport event over Europe during the 2017 Storm Ophelia in CAMS forecast systems: analysis and evaluation\n\nDimitris Akritidis, Eleni Katragkou, Aristeidis K. Georgoulias, Prodromos Zanis, Stergios Kartsios, Johannes Flemming, Antje Inness, John Douros, and Henk Eskes\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 20, 13557–13578, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-13557-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-20-13557-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe assess the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global and regional forecasts performance during a complex aerosol transport event over Europe induced by the passage of Storm Ophelia in mid-October 2017. Comparison with satellite observations reveals a satisfactory performance of CAMS global forecast assisted by data assimilation, while comparison with ground-based measurements indicates that the CAMS regional system over-performs compared to the global one in terms of air quality.\n\nA continued role of short-lived climate forcers under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\n\nMarianne T. Lund, Borgar Aamaas, Camilla W. Stjern, Zbigniew Klimont, Terje K. Berntsen, and BjÃ¸rn H. Samset\n\nEarth Syst.

Here we quantify the near- and long-term global temperature impacts of emissions of individual SLCFs and CO2 from 7 economic sectors in 13 regions in order to provide the detailed knowledge needed to design efficient mitigation strategies at the sectoral and regional levels.\n\nAccelerated increases in global and Asian summer monsoon precipitation from future aerosol reductions\n\nLaura J. Wilcox, Zhen Liu, BjÃ¸rn H. Samset, Ed Hawkins, Marianne T. Lund, Kalle Nordling, Sabine Undorf, Massimo Bollasina, Annica M. L. Ekman, Srinath Krishnan, Joonas Merikanto, and Andrew G.

Rapid reductions between the present and the 2050s lead to enhanced increases in global and Asian summer monsoon precipitation relative to scenarios with continued increases in aerosol. Relative magnitude and spatial distribution of aerosol changes are particularly important for South Asian summer monsoon precipitation changes, affecting the sign of the trend in the coming decades.\n\nHow much snow falls in the world's mountains? A first look at mountain snowfall estimates in A-train observations and reanalyses\n\nAnne Sophie Daloz, Marian Mateling, Tristan L'Ecuyer, Mark Kulie, Norm B. Wood, Mikael Durand, Melissa Wrzesien, Camilla W. Stjern, and Ashok P. Dimri\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 3195–3207, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3195-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3195-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe total of snow that falls globally is a critical factor governing freshwater availability. To better understand how this resource is impacted by climate change, we need to know how reliable the current observational datasets for snow are. Here, we compare five datasets looking at the snow falling over the mountains versus the other continents. We show that there is a large consensus when looking at fractional contributions but strong dissimilarities when comparing magnitudes.\n\nA global modelâmeasurement evaluation of particle light scattering coefficients at elevated relative humidity\n\nMarÃ­a A.

Our results show the importance of the parameterization of hygroscopicity and model chemistry as drivers of some of the observed diversity amongst model estimates. The definition of dry conditions and the phenomena taking place in this relative humidity range also impact the model evaluation.\n\nEarth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) v2.0 â an extended set of large-scale diagnostics for quasi-operational and comprehensive evaluation of Earth system models in CMIP\n\nVeronika Eyring, Lisa Bock, Axel Lauer, Mattia Righi, Manuel Schlund, Bouwe Andela, Enrico Arnone, Omar Bellprat, BjÃ¶rn BrÃ¶tz, Louis-Philippe Caron, Nuno Carvalhais, Irene Cionni, Nicola Cortesi, Bas Crezee, Edouard L.

Results show that aerosols can have a considerable impact on many aspects of the climate. Aerosols reduce solar radiation and temperature at the surface. Precipitation is not particularly affected in any specific direction. The cloudiness amount change is small. Also, changes in wind pattern are seen.\n\nBehind the scenes of an interdisciplinary effort: conception, design and production of a flyer on climate change for the citizens of Hamburg\n\nBettina Steuri, Tanja Blome, Katharina BÃ¼low, Juliane El Zohbi, Peter Hoffmann, Juliane Petersen, Susanne Pfeifer, Diana Rechid, and Daniela Jacob\n\nAdv.

Therefore, a flyer was created that is understandable to non-climate scientists, visually attractive and generates interest. In this article, the authors provide insights into their teamwork, the underlying guiding principles as well as lessons learned that are of great value for future projects.\n\nBiogeophysical impacts of forestation in Europe: first results from the LUCAS (Land Use and Climate Across Scales) regional climate model intercomparison\n\nEdouard L.

In this work the capabilities of the new dataset to reproduce the mean and extreme regimes of precipitation and temperature are assessed and compared with the E-OBS dataset (including the ensemble version for observational uncertainty assessment).\n\nAnthropogenic aerosol forcing under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways\n\nMarianne T. Lund, Gunnar Myhre, and BjÃ¸rn H. Samset\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 13827–13839, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-13827-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-19-13827-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric aerosols play an integral role in shaping local and global climate by modifying the energy balance, clouds and precipitation. They are also a leading cause of premature mortality in many areas. New scenarios provide projections of emissions until 2100 given strong, medium or weak air pollution control stringency. We quantify the consequent regional and global aerosol loading and radiative forcing, showing a large spread at the end of the century and regional differences in trends.\n\nMapping the suitability of groundwater-dependent vegetation in a semi-arid Mediterranean area\n\nInÃªs Gomes Marques, JoÃ£o Nascimento, Rita M. Cardoso, Filipe MiguÃ©ns, Maria Teresa Condesso de Melo, Pedro M. M. Soares, CÃ©lia M. Gouveia, and Cathy Kurz Besson\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

They are of great importance due to their high socioeconomic value; however, a decrease in water availability has put this system in danger. In this paper we build a model that explains this system's tree-species distribution in southern Portugal from environmental variables. This could help predict their future distribution under changing climatic conditions.\n\nInfluences of Lake Malawi on the spatial and diurnal variability of local precipitation\n\nShunya Koseki and Priscilla A. Mooney\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2795–2812, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2795-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-2795-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study revealed that Lake Malawi plays an important role for local precipitation in terms of spatial distribution and diurnal cycle in boreal summer (November to March). The diurnal cycle is detected by harmonics analysis and empirical orthogonal function analysis. An idealized simulation of WRF without Lake Malawi clearly showed that Lake Malawi is a source of local precipitation.\n\nReviews and syntheses: influences of landscape structure and land uses on local to regional climate and air quality\n\nRaia Silvia Massad, Juliette LathiÃ¨re, Susanna Strada, Mathieu Perrin, Erwan Personne, Marc StÃ©fanon, Patrick Stella, Sophie Szopa, and Nathalie de Noblet-DucoudrÃ©\n\nBiogeosciences, 16, 2369–2408, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-2369-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-16-2369-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHuman activities strongly interfere in the land–atmosphere interactions through changes in land use and land cover changes and land management. The objectives of this review are to synthesize the existing experimental and modelling works that investigate physical, chemical, and biogeochemical interactions between land surface and the atmosphere. Greater consideration of atmospheric chemistry, through land–atmosphere interactions, as a decision parameter for land management is essential.\n\nCORDEX-WRF v1.3: development of a module for the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to support the CORDEX community\n\nLluÃ­s Fita, Jan Polcher, Theodore M. Giannaros, Torge Lorenz, Josipa Milovac, Giannis Sofiadis, Eleni Katragkou, and Sophie Bastin\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 1029–1066, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-1029-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-1029-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRegional climate experiments coordinated throughout CORDEX aim to study and provide high-quality climate data over a given region. The data are used in climate change mitigation and adaptation policy studies and by stakeholders. CORDEX requires a list of variables, most of which are not provided by atmospheric models. Aiming to help the community and to maximize the use of CORDEX exercises, we create a new module for WRF models to directly produce them by adding generic and additional ones.\n\nConcentrations and radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols from 1750 to 2014 simulated with the OsloÂ CTM3 and CEDS emission inventory\n\nMarianne Tronstad Lund, Gunnar Myhre, Amund SÃ¸vde Haslerud, Ragnhild Bieltvedt Skeie, Jan Griesfeller, Stephen Matthew Platt, Rajesh Kumar, Cathrine Lund Myhre, and Michael Schulz\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 4909–4931, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-4909-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-4909-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric aerosols play a key role in the climate system, but their exact impact on the energy balance remains uncertain. Accurate representation of the geographical distribution and properties of aerosols in global models is key to reduce this uncertainty. Here we use a new emission inventory and a range of observations to carefully validate a state-of-the-art model and present an updated estimate of the net direct effect of anthropogenic aerosols since the preindustrial era.\n\nA deep stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone transport event over Europe simulated in CAMS global and regional forecast systems: analysis and evaluation\n\nDimitris Akritidis, Eleni Katragkou, Prodromos Zanis, Ioannis Pytharoulis, Dimitris Melas, Johannes Flemming, Antje Inness, Hannah Clark, Matthieu Plu, and Henk Eskes\n\nAtmos.

Phys., 18, 13655–13672, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-13655-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-13655-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFocusing on Europe, this HTAP 2 study computes ozone in several global models when reducing anthropogenic emissions by 20 % in different world regions. The differences in model results are explored by use of a novel stepwise approach combining a tracer, CO and ozone. For ozone the contributions from the rest of the world are larger than from Europe, with the largest contributions from North America and eastern Asia. Contributions do, however, depend on the choice of ozone metric.\n\nEvaluating and improving the Community Land Model's sensitivity to land cover\n\nRonny Meier, Edouard L. Davin, Quentin Lejeune, Mathias Hauser, Yan Li, Brecht Martens, Natalie M. Schultz, Shannon Sterling, and Wim Thiery\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 4731–4757, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-4731-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-4731-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDeforestation not only releases carbon dioxide to the atmosphere but also affects local climatic conditions by altering energy fluxes at the land surface and thereby the local temperature. Here, we evaluate the local impact of deforestation in a widely used land surface model. We find that the model reproduces the daytime warming effect of deforestation well. On the other hand, the warmer temperatures observed during night in forests are not present in this model.\n\nHTAP2 multi-model estimates of premature human mortality due to intercontinental transport of air pollution and emission sectors\n\nCiao-Kai Liang, J.

Here we quantify the effects of intercontinental PM2.5 and ozone transport on human health using a new multi-model ensemble, evaluating the health effects of emissions from six world regions and three emission source sectors. Emissions from one region have significant health impacts outside of that source region; similarly, foreign emissions contribute significantly to air-pollution-related deaths in several world regions.\n\nThe impact of future emission policies on tropospheric ozone using a parameterised approach\n\nSteven T. Turnock, Oliver Wild, Frank J. Dentener, Yanko Davila, Louisa K. Emmons, Johannes Flemming, Gerd A. Folberth, Daven K. Henze, Jan E. Jonson, Terry J. Keating, Sudo Kengo, Meiyun Lin, Marianne Lund, Simone Tilmes, and Fiona M. O'Connor\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Future emissions scenarios based on currently implemented legislation are shown to worsen surface ozone air quality and enhance near-term climate warming, with changes in methane becoming increasingly important in the future.\n\nEuropean climate change at global mean temperature increases of 1.5 and 2â¯Â°C above pre-industrial conditions as simulated by the EURO-CORDEX regional climate models\n\nErik KjellstrÃ¶m, Grigory Nikulin, Gustav Strandberg, Ole BÃ¸ssing Christensen, Daniela Jacob, Klaus Keuler, Geert Lenderink, Erik van Meijgaard, Christoph SchÃ¤r, Samuel Somot, Silje Lund SÃ¸rland, Claas Teichmann, and Robert Vautard\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 9, 459–478, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-459-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-459-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBased on high-resolution regional climate models we investigate European climate change at 1.5 and 2 Â°C of global warming compared to pre-industrial levels. Considerable near-surface warming exceeding that of the global mean is found for most of Europe, already at the lower 1.5 Â°C of warming level. Changes in precipitation and near-surface wind speed are identified. The 1.5 Â°C of warming level shows significantly less change compared to the 2 Â°C level, indicating the importance of mitigation.\n\nFuture inhibition of ecosystem productivity by increasing wildfire pollution over boreal North America\n\nXu Yue, Susanna Strada, Nadine Unger, and Aihui Wang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 13699–13719, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-13699-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-13699-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change will significantly increase wildfire emissions in boreal North America by the midcentury, leading to increased surface ozone and atmospheric aerosols. These air pollutants can affect vegetation photosynthesis through stomatal uptake (for ozone) and radiative and climatic perturbations (for aerosols). Using a carbon–chemistry–climate model, we estimate trivial ozone vegetation damages but significant aerosol-induced reduction in ecosystem productivity by the 2050s.\n\nInvestigation of global particulate nitrate from the AeroCom phaseÂ III experiment\n\nHuisheng Bian, Mian Chin, Didier A.

This paper investigates atmospheric nitrate using multiple global models and measurements. The study is part of the AeroCom phase III activity. The study is the first attempt to look at global atmospheric nitrate simulation at physical and chemical process levels.\n\nEmission metrics for quantifying regional climate impacts of aviation\n\nMarianne T.

M. Pugh, Stephen Sitch, Elke Stehfest, and Peter H. Verburg\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 369–386, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-369-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-369-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLand-use change is still overly simplistically implemented in global ecosystem and climate models. We identify and discuss three major challenges at the interface of land-use and climate modeling and propose ways for how to improve land-use representation in climate models. We conclude that land-use data-provider and user communities need to engage in the joint development and evaluation of enhanced land-use datasets to improve the quantification of land use–climate interactions and feedback.\n\nSensitivity of black carbon concentrations and climate impact to aging and scavenging in OsloCTM2âM7\n\nMarianne T. Lund, Terje K. Berntsen, and BjÃ¸rn H. Samset\n\nAtmos. Chem.

Our results provide an increased understanding of the processes contributing to uncertainties in the BC abundance and climate impact and underline the importance of more observations and experimental data further constrain models.\n\nThe COSMO-CLM 4.8 regional climate model coupled to regional ocean, land surface and global earth system models using OASIS3-MCT: description and performance\n\nAndreas Will, Naveed Akhtar, Jennifer Brauch, Marcus Breil, Edouard Davin, Ha T. M. Ho-Hagemann, Eric Maisonnave, Markus ThÃ¼rkow, and Stefan Weiher\n\nGeosci.

The COSMO CLM regional climate model is two-way coupled via OASIS3-MCT to the land surface, regional ocean for the Mediterranean Sea, North and Baltic seas and an earth system model. The direct coupling costs of communication and horizontal interpolation are shown to be negligible even for a frequent exchange of 450 2-D fields. A procedure of finding an optimum processor configuration is presented and successfully applied to all couplings.\n\nMulti-model simulations of aerosol and ozone radiative forcing due to anthropogenic emission changes during the periodÂ 1990–2015\n\nGunnar Myhre, Wenche Aas, Ribu Cherian, William Collins, Greg Faluvegi, Mark Flanner, Piers Forster, Ãivind Hodnebrog, Zbigniew Klimont, Marianne T.

Here, we show the resulting changes to aerosol and ozone abundances and their radiative forcing using recently updated emission data for the period 1990–2015, as simulated by seven global atmospheric composition models. The global mean radiative forcing is more strongly positive than reported in IPCC AR5.\n\nThe CAMS interim Reanalysis of Carbon Monoxide, Ozone and Aerosol for 2003â2015\n\nJohannes Flemming, Angela Benedetti, Antje Inness, Richard J. Engelen, Luke Jones, Vincent Huijnen, Samuel Remy, Mark Parrington, Martin Suttie, Alessio Bozzo, Vincent-Henri Peuch, Dimitris Akritidis, and Eleni Katragkou\n\nAtmos. Chem.

The generated global data set (CAMS interim reanalysis) covers the period 2003–2015 at a resolution of about 110 km. The CAMS interim reanalysis can be used to study global air pollution and climate forcing of aerosol and stratospheric ozone. It has been produced by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (http://atmosphere. copernicus.eu).\n\nImpact of dust size parameterizations on aerosol burden and radiative forcing in RegCM4\n\nAthanasios Tsikerdekis, Prodromos Zanis, Allison L. Steiner, Fabien Solmon, Vassilis Amiridis, Eleni Marinou, Eleni Katragkou, Theodoros Karacostas, and Gilles Foret\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We use a new dust size discretization that improves the physical representation of dust in a regional climate model. This study is among the first studies evaluating the vertical profile of simulated dust with a pure dust product. The new dust size discretization increases dust optical depth by 10 % over the desert and Mediterranean. Consequently, the dust SW and LW radiative forcing is enhanced by 10 %.\n\nGlobal and regional radiative forcing from 20â¯% reductions in BC, OC and SO4 â an HTAP2 multi-model study\n\nCamilla Weum Stjern, BjÃ¸rn Hallvard Samset, Gunnar Myhre, Huisheng Bian, Mian Chin, Yanko Davila, Frank Dentener, Louisa Emmons, Johannes Flemming, Amund SÃ¸vde Haslerud, Daven Henze, Jan Eiof Jonson, Tom Kucsera, Marianne Tronstad Lund, Michael Schulz, Kengo Sudo, Toshihiko Takemura, and Simone Tilmes\n\nAtmos.

Here we first present results from the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution Phase 2 exercise, where many models performed the same set of coordinated emission-reduction experiments. We find that mitigations have considerable extra-regional effects, and show that this is particularly true for black carbon emissions, as long-range transport elevates aerosols to higher levels where their radiative influence is stronger.\n\nThe Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP) contribution to CMIP6: rationale and experimental design\n\nDavid M. Lawrence, George C. Hurtt, Almut Arneth, Victor Brovkin, Kate V. Calvin, Andrew D. Jones, Chris D. Jones, Peter J. Lawrence, Nathalie de Noblet-DucoudrÃ©, Julia Pongratz, Sonia I. Seneviratne, and Elena Shevliakova\n\nGeosci.

In the future, land-use activities are likely to expand and intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. The goal of LUMIP is to take the next steps in land-use change science, and enable, coordinate, and ultimately address the most important land-use science questions in more depth and sophistication than possible in a multi-model context to date.\n\nMulti-model evaluation of short-lived pollutant distributions over east Asia during summer 2008\n\nB.

Phys., 16, 10765–10792, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-10765-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-16-10765-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper evaluates the ability of six global models and one regional model in reproducing short-lived pollutants (defined here as ozone and its precursors, aerosols and black carbon) concentrations over Asia using satellite, ground-based and airborne observations. Key findings are that models homogeneously reproduce the trace gas observations although nitrous oxides are underestimated, whereas the aerosol distributions are heterogeneously reproduced, implicating important uncertainties.\n\nESMValTool (v1.0) â a community diagnostic and performance metrics tool for routine evaluation of Earth system models in CMIP\n\nVeronika Eyring, Mattia Righi, Axel Lauer, Martin Evaldsson, Sabrina Wenzel, Colin Jones, Alessandro Anav, Oliver Andrews, Irene Cionni, Edouard L.

Davin, Safa Motesharrei, Ning Zeng, Shuangcheng Li, and Eugenia Kalnay\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 7, 167–181, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-167-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-7-167-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe impact of deforestation is to warm the tropics and cool the extratropics, and the magnitude of the impact depends on the spatial extent and the degree of forest loss. That also means location matters for the impact of deforestation on temperature because such an impact is largely determined by the climate condition of that region. For example, under dry and wet conditions, deforestation can have quite different climate impacts.\n\nORCHIDEE-CROP (v0), a new process-based agro-land surface model: model description and evaluation over Europe\n\nX. Wu, N. Vuichard, P. Ciais, N. Viovy, N. de Noblet-DucoudrÃ©, X. Wang, V. Magliulo, M. Wattenbach, L. Vitale, P. Di Tommasi, E. J. Moors, W. Jans, J. Elbers, E. Ceschia, T. Tallec, C. Bernhofer, T. GrÃ¼nwald, C. Moureaux, T. Manise, A. Ligne, P. Cellier, B. Loubet, E. Larmanou, and D. Ripoche\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 9, 857–873, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-857-2016,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-9-857-2016, 2016\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe response of crops to changing climate and atmospheric CO2 could have large effects on food production, terrestrial carbon, water, energy fluxes and the climate feedbacks. We developed a new process-oriented terrestrial biogeochemical model named ORCHIDEE-CROP (v0), which integrates a generic crop phenology and harvest module into the land surface model ORCHIDEE. Our model has good ability to capture the spatial gradients of crop phenology, carbon and energy-related variables across Europe.\n\nImpact of future land-cover changes on HNO3 and O3 surface dry deposition\n\nT. Verbeke, J. LathiÃ¨re, S. Szopa, and N. de Noblet-DucoudrÃ©\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 15, 13555–13568, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-13555-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-13555-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDry deposition is a key component of surface-atmosphere exchange of compounds, acting as a sink for several chemical species and strongly driven by meteorological factors, chemical properties of the trace gas considered and land surface properties. The objective of our study is to investigate the impact of vegetation distribution change, which is still not very well quantified, on the dry deposition of key atmospheric species: ozone and nitric acid vapor.\n\nOn the ability of RegCM4 regional climate model to simulate surface solar radiation patterns over Europe: an assessment using satellite-based observations\n\nG. Alexandri, A. K. Georgoulias, P. Zanis, E. Katragkou, A. Tsikerdekis, K. Kourtidis, and C. Meleti\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 15, 13195–13216, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-13195-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-13195-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIt is shown here that RegCM4 regional climate model adequately simulates surface solar radiation (SSR) over Europe but significantly over/underestimates several parameters that determine the transmission of solar radiation in the atmosphere. The agreement between RegCM4 and satellite-based SSR observations is actually a result of the conflicting effect of these parameters. We suggest that there should be a reassessment of the way these parameters are represented within this and other models.\n\nValidation of reactive gases and aerosols in the MACC global analysis and forecast system\n\nH.
