        "text": "My husband and I participated in the May 18-June 5, 2024 Pilgrimage. We highly recommend 206 Tours Company. We originally had booked a Holy Land Tour which was cancelled due to the Hamas Terrorism and resultant war. 206 Tours offered a full refund/credit/rebooking of our pilgrimage. We chose to rebook on the Fatima, Spain, Lourdes & Shrines of Italy Tour.\n\nThe booking process, pre-trip and tour information was complete and easy to follow. The company was very responsive and prompt in addressing all of our questions. All of the items (luggage tags, lanyards, travel information, etc.) necessary for our pilgrimage arrived a few weeks before travel.\n\nThe professionalism, knowledge, courtesy & helpfulness of the Tour Company, Guides, and Drivers were exceptional. The hotels were proximal to the pilgrimage sites which allowed us optimal time spent at the sites. Each hotel was comfortable, modern and had courteous staff. The Motor Coach was comfortable and clean. The meals provided were reflective of the cuisine of each country.\n\nWe want to especially acknowledge Vanessa, our Tour Guide in Portugal, Spain & France. She was exceptional in her knowledge of each country. She was readily available for any questions and needs. Every day we were in the Bus she made it clear as to when the next “Rest” stop would be with clean and free restrooms! This was very much appreciated. Her faith was evident throughout the tour. It was sad having to say good-bye to her when we departed for the second leg of our Pilgrimage in Italy. When I recall this part of our journey Vanessa is interwoven in each aspect. We would love to have her as a future guide!\n\nFrederica was our Guide in Italy. She also was an exceptional guide and representative for 206 Tours. She was knowledgeable and accessible. My husband became ill during this part of the trip. Frederica helped us navigate Pharmacies and seeing a Physician. She was patient, kind and extremely helpful during this “unexpected” experience in a foreign country. She expertly juggled our needs with the needs of the Tour. Our gratitude and appreciation are woven into our “Italy Experience”.\n\nKudos to:\n\nPedro– our Driver in Portugal, Spain & Lourdes. He always had a smile and kept our Bus spotless, inside and out (clean windows!!).\n\nAmos– our Driver in Italy. He excelled with navigation of some very narrow & twisting roads. He always had a smile.\n\nOur City Tour Guides were awesome and very informative.\n\nWe carry a deep appreciation for our Priests. Fr. Ed Lamp was with us in Fatima, Spain & Lourdes. He was very personable. He made it a point to spend time and visit with each person on the pilgrimage. His insights regarding our faith was deeply valued. Fr. Dawid Kwiatkowski was our Priest in Italy. He, too, shared his deep faith with us daily. Especially during our time on the Bus. Having a Priest on the Pilgrimage and celebrating the Mass daily defined our experience.\n\nAnother important and lasting “gift” from this Pilgrimage was the time spent with the other Pilgrims. Sharing our faith with others who deeply love the Catholic Faith was a wonderful and lasting reward from our Tour. We highly recommend 206 Tours to others. We definitely would travel with 206 Tours again.\n\n-Mary & Tony Madrid\n\nDear Cara,\n\nI want to send a big Thank You to you and 206 Tours for a wonderful and blessed Italy pilgrimage with Chris Stefanick. When I signed up, I did not know what to expect, yet the pilgrimage was more than I could have ever imagined! I certainly did not expect to make lasting friendships in such a short period of time with fellow pilgrims.\n\nThe tour guides, Ana and Vanessa, took very good care of all of us pilgrims. I had the blessing to be under Ana’s care for the entire 14 days. She was very knowledgeable and willing to answer any questions that we had. She continually called us Family which is what was formed in these 2 weeks. What impressed me the most is her attention to all of our needs. For instance, on our last day in Rome we had our walking tour of Rome and by the end I could feel myself getting dehydrated. She helped me and 2 others find a cab so we could get back to the hotel. The following day, she kept checking in on me to make sure I had recovered. Later in the tour, we were at a wine tasting, and when I waved off the pasta as I was not hungry (because I had Gelato earlier) she immediately checked to make sure I was okay. Even at the Venice airport as we were departing to return home, though her job was complete, she still kept her eyes on the group of us that traveled with her. I felt so loved by her.\n\nAntonio, our bus driver, was amazing. He made our rides so smooth. I wish I could speak more Italian so to converse with him, but he took care of his passengers.\n\nOverall, the tour was wonderful. The downside was that there was so much to do, but little time to really sit and pray in any one place. Some people said they would turn down the whisper and sit and pray, but i was always afraid I would get left behind if I did that. On the original schedule on the website, it had one day that we would have free time in Rome, however that did not happen. It was that day I had hoped to visit a few other saints in Rome, but I was able to let that go in the end. Rome was a go, go, go type of feeling.\n\nI was also impressed with the meals. Crazy how y’all were able to find restaurants to take on 63 pilgrims. I appreciated not having to worry about meals. Having the 3 meals as part of the tour, was one of the factors that helped me to decide to sign up. We all learned early on to ask how many courses were included in the lunch and dinners so to pace ourselves on eating. Between the food and the concierge service everywhere we went, I felt spoiled.\n\nThank you especially for the beautiful stop at the villa between Sienna and Florence. To have an afternoon/evening to just rest and bond before the extended tour began was perfect!\n\nLastly, the local guides used in each city was appreciated. Had I tried to visit these places on my own, I would have missed out on so much. They were very knowledgeable and friendly. They kept a good pace where those who may have been slower like myself at times were still able to keep up.\n\nThis was my first 206 Tours pilgrimage and I am sure this will not be my last. I will highly recommend you to everyone I know. I hope to save up money as best I can to join in with another Chris Stefanick tour. Chris was very genuine as he took the time to speak and get to know each person on the tour with him. If he does do another Italy tour, it would be good to have a plan for where he can do some talks. We didn’t get to hear him as much as hoped, as he shared with me that he had hoped to speak in the chapels after Mass, but we were usually ushered out pretty quickly. I do know this was his first Italy tour, so these things could not be foreseen.\n\nI think this covers everything. If you have any questions let me know. I will be happy to share more if needed. Thank you again for all that you did for me. The only thing I had to do was pay, pack and show up. Nothing can beat that.\n\nGod bless you and the work that you do.\n\nPeace and Blessings,\n\nSr. Alison Weber, SC\n\nDear Series Departures Team,\n\nI had the most amazing time with the tour. Thank you for organizing such a wonderful tour. The sites were more beautiful than I could have imagined.\n\nFather Chris was such a blessing. His masses and sermons were so moving and spiritual especially his sermon at Corinth for the married couples. Father Novak was also wonderful. Sharing the tour with the blue group (the other 206 tour) was also lovely. They were our extended 206 family.\n\nMaria our tour guide took such good care of us. Maria was so well organized, and she told us what we needed to know at that time. She did not overwhelm us with too much info. We were also blessed with Nena the blue group tour guide. Again, it was so nice to see our fellow blue 206 pilgrims at the sites/hotels/cruise ship, at meal times, and at mass.\n\nThe hotels were nice, staff was friendly, and the rooms were comfortable. Some feedback on the cruise ship. There was no shampoo or hair conditioner in the cabin. The shower gel and liquid hand soap were the only toiletries provided. This was a small inconvenience but something I need to mention. I thought it was odd for the hotels to have the toiletries and not the cruise ship. I have been on cruise ships before where they had ample of toiletries for the guests,\n\nI had a connecting flight from Athens to Thessaloniki. After going through customs at Athens, I needed to collect my luggage and recheck it for the flight to Thessaloniki. This should be mentioned in the “know before you go” section for travelers with connecting flights with nonpartner airline carriers.\n\nFor visiting St. Stephen monastery at Meteora, we females needed to wear a shawl on top of our long pants to enter the church. We were astonished that our long pants were not suffice in covering our knees. Fortunate for us, one of our female pilgrims had several shawls that she loaned to us.\n\nThank you again for organizing such a wonderful tour. I had the most amazing experience and met such lovely people on this tour.\n\nGod bless you and the work you do for us pilgrims,\n\nRita\n\nDear 206 Tours / Cara,\n\nI am answering your request for a review of our recent trip to Greece and Medugorje with 206 Tours. I had a wonderful time on the trip and feel like we had the best of the best when it came to our Tour Guides. Throughout Greece, Chrysanthi was our Guide. Her knowledge of the history of Greece and Greek culture was amazing. And, her archaeology knowledge was invaluable in learning about the ancient ruins. She was so friendly and went out of her way to meet each of us and to help us to all meet each other. She even organized bus games to keep us laughing. Our group included different age groups and differing levels of mobility but she kept that in mind at all times leading us to elevators, ramps, and even rest breaks, when they were needed. She is the reason we all bonded as friends and had such a memorable time. You truly have a gem in her as a Guide.\n\nSlavenka was our Medugorje Guide. She was so perfect for our group. She knew so much about the beginnings of Medugorje and even though I had been there before, I learned many things. She is the only guide I have ever had on a Catholic Pilgrimage that actually prayed with us and that meant so much to me. It was obvious she wanted us to not only understand the place, but also the message of Medugorje. She is a true jewel in the 206 crown and you are blessed to have her.\n\nOur drivers (sorry, I have no names) were all exceptional. I absolutely felt totally safe at all times with them driving.\n\nAs for the trip in general, I only wish we had been able to see less ruins in Greece (after 7 days they all look the same) and maybe explore an Olive Grove, or see where/how olive oil is processed, maybe even explore some more of the Greek Orthodox shrines (monasteries, convents, cathedrals). More shopping time in the religious icon shops in Greece would be a good addition too. The Celestial Cruise around the Greek Isles was beautiful and so much fun. It was such a different experience from the land tour of Greece, I actually felt like I went on three separate vacations.\n\nMany thanks to 206 Tours and to all those that put our trip together. We actually asked for adjoining rooms in hotels so friends could be closer together and you even made that happen. I was very impressed with your tour service and all the employees associated with you.\n\nGod Bless….until my next trip,\n\nMarian Byrd\n\nI would like to give my impression of 206 Tours, recently my husband and I went on the Shrines of Italy Pilgrimage with 206 Tours, led by Father Jack Ho and tour guide Federica. Curtis and I were not new to pilgrimages, and we knew having traveled with 206 Tours previously, that it was going to be great given the fact that the year before we went to Greece and walked the Steps of Paul in July, which was also wonderful and included the Greek Island Cruise. I am not sure that I had specific expectations of this experience to the Shines of Italy, however I will tell you that this pilgrimage exceeded any possible expectations that my husband and I could have possibly had, it was just amazing, and the glory of God was evident in simply every moment of this pilgrimage, every single minute. I will say that Father Jack Ho was one incredible Shepard/Priest, religious leader of this pilgrimage. He led us every step of the way in prayer, holy mass, we had time to discuss the experiences as a group and really felt held and united in the holy spirit as we traveled together with people from all over the USA. He brought music, song books helped us to get involved in serving at the masses, allowed us to step up and lead decades of the Rosary on the bus, it was so awesome. Federica, our Tour Guide was equally amazing, she was so incredibly kind, you almost felt like she was family watching out for you. Everything she did was a labor of love for our group, she would get up at 3 AM to help everyone get to the airport on time, she checked every bag to make sure it got on the bus from place to place and even bought the group cookies and foods that were important to the specific places we visited. Added to that she added little details in about her own life and the significance that the sites had for her and her family. Everything on the pilgrimage was lovely, the hotels were clean and outstanding, the food delicious and huge amounts, the transportation was wonderful and the bus so comfortable, the local guides were amazing, the private masses in the holiest of places almost made you feel like you were in heaven, we even had time to have a bit of a party at a local vineyard one day and ate a very special lunch at a wine tasting. I felt held by the holy spirit the entire time and so didn’t my husband Curtis. We are so grateful to God for this ministry of 206 Tours. We would never travel with another group given how the attention to detail in this pilgrimage really made it a life changing experience. My advice to you out there who have not been on a pilgrimage is to be sure to go with 206 Tours, take the Shrines of Italy, you will be so happy, it’s the pilgrimage of all pilgrimages, perhaps you have already made a pilgrimage, I tell you our pilgrimage to Medjugorje prepared us for this pilgrimage to Italy, that is how I feel, I highly recommend this pilgrimage, 5 stars plus to 206 Tours and Father Jack Ho! Thank you Everyone! Just one last tip, starting walking go to the gym work out you walk a lot everyday and you deserve to be in good shape to make a trip like this, I am so glad I was fit for the pilgrimage.\n\n-Gianna and Curtis Johnston\n\nHello – I am writing in regard to my recent tour of Krakow and Rome. The entire tour was a wonderful experience and I appreciate all of the efforts of your team in organizing the tour.\n\nThis was my first trip to Krakow and the experience overall was very moving and inspirational. Our tour guide, Sabina, was so helpful, thoughtful, and generous with her time and attention to our tour group. She ensured that the group’s needs were taken care of at all points during the tour. Also, I very much appreciated the change in the tour schedule that allowed our group to visit the Divine Mercy Shrine and the St. John Paul II Shrine on Divine Mercy Sunday. Our group had a meaningful afternoon with the tours of both shrines, the opportunity to have confession, reciting the Divine Mercy Chaplet with all in attendance, and the private Mass in the Divine Mercy Shrine. We were so blessed to have these opportunities. The hotel that we stayed at was in a perfect location and the staff was very thoughtful in helping with any needs. The meals were overall great, although I would suggest that the schedule be reviewed to see if there could be a little more time provided for lunch or perhaps box lunches for the very packed days.\n\nRome was magical as always. Cristina was a terrific tour guide — very thoughtful and helpful in taking care of our group, and a terrific sense of humor, which made our days brighter. The local guide was amazing as well. She was so informative and a very happy demeanor. I appreciated the help with the trip to Monte Cassino, the transfer from there back to Rome, and the extra days in Rome. The hotel and the food were great as always.\n\nI appreciate all of the good work with the travel arrangements – no issues with getting to the tour, travel within Europe, and returning home.\n\nThis is my sixth tour with 206 Tours and I just want to say “thank you” for all that you do to organize these tours and support pilgrims throughout their journeys. When I travel with your tour group, I know that all of the arrangements will be taken care of so that I can relax and enjoy the experience.\n\nThank you,\n\nJacquelyne\n\nGood Morning 206 Tours,\n\nI want to thank you for an incredible pilgrimage to Medjugorje in April. I had a very special and holy time. This was my second trip to Medjugorje, both scheduled through your agency. Both trips were amazing and each a little different, which made it all the more special.\n\nI would like to thank Chris for working so hard to get me a direct flight from St. Louis to Frankfurt. I really can’t handle the Chicago airport anymore, and Chris went out of his way to keep me out of that airport. I am grateful. My trip started off with a wonderful young man named Andrew, escorting us from the Split airport into Medjugorje. He was so kind, professional and knowledgeable. I could have listened to his stories all day! I am amazed at all the languages your guides speak. They are so talented and intelligent.\n\nI stayed at Hotel Grace, which was wonderful. My guide, Ivana, was so beautiful, kind and professional but the thing I loved most about her was her obvious love for The Blessed Mother and our Catholic Faith. It’s very special to be around someone who lives her faith so beautifully. I’m sure many pilgrims look to her as a role model for how we should be living our faith. I found myself wanting to soak up as much time with her as possible! I probably drove her crazy with all the questions I asked, but I wanted to learn as much as I could from her. I will always treasure the time I spent with her, and I’m grateful for her patience she had with me and all the pilgrims in our group. I’m sure at times we could be very challenging,but she never stopped being a total professional. I’m also sure The Blessed Mother is proud of her and the work she does to spread the messages to everyone who travels to her village.\n\nBecause of Ivana, our group had the wonderful opportunity to be present for an apparition with Marija. That was probably the most special moment of my life and I will always remember that day.\n\nI will quickly mention all the drivers, servers and everyone involved in making my trip so perfect. I don’t know their names, but am grateful to all of them. I hope to go back to Medjugorje again someday, and I will be calling 206 tours to organize my trip.\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\nSuzanne Burkett Boes\n\nDear 206 Tours,\n\nThank you so much for allowing me to provide positive feedback on our recent Medjugorje Pilgrimage with Father Dawson and Father Miles through 206 Tours. Most importantly, everything was so spiritual and amazing! We are looking forward to another pilgrimage back there or to the Vatican or Holy Land with 206 Tours.\n\n206 Tours did an excellent job from our first email encounter all the way to this final feedback email. The communications from Cara, the gift 206 shoulder bag and the help with our travel arrangements on our way there due to weather delays, etc showed that 206 Tours really valued our business. With the group of 47 of us making the pilgrimage, the red/blue 206 shoulder bags were so helpful in identifying our fellow passengers through the busy airports and ensuring that we did not leave anyone behind.\n\nThe flights, transportation to/from the airports and through the Security Checkpoints in each Country went well with no complaints. Our wonderful Tour Guide (Dragan Zovko) was so knowledgeable and always seemed to be one step ahead of us in all our daily activities to ensure minimal disruptions and maximum exposure to our daily schedules. He was well versed on everything and his personality was perfect for this group of Pilgrims from Louisiana. He quickly bonded with all of us and was so enjoyable to be around. I do want to also make note that his strong Catholic faith really added to our overall spiritual experience of this trip.\n\nThe Hotel Grace was excellent and I am glad we stayed there. The Hotel Grace Staff were professional and welcoming to us and ensured that our stay with them was topnotch. The daily breakfasts and dinners were delicious and we left the table full each morning and night. The wine selection was excellent too! The Hotel Grace accommodations were very good. From our rooms to the daily room service, food, drinks, etc, there were no complaints and when we make a return trip, I know where I want to stay. Hotel Grace was next to St. James Church and the Chapel, which made it so easy to walk to whenever I wanted. Even the distance from Apparition Hill from the Hotel was an easy walk.\n\n206 Tours also did an excellent job with ensuring we had bus service to take us around to other areas that we wanted to experience such as Cross Mountain, Divine Chaplet Chapel, and Dubrovnik. I felt complete safety in the hands of our bus driver.\n\nOverall, a most wonderful pilgrimage and thanks to 206 Tours for everything you have done to make it such a memorable experience. I have recommended 206 Tours to some friends of mine who are looking to book a pilgrimage soon (I gave them Cara’s email).\n\nThank you again and may God continue to bless 206 Tours.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nJason and Nancy Amato\n\nDear Jason,\n\nWe arrived home in Australia and it took some time to readjust to southern hemisphere time. However, we were very happy to have joined the tour and will promote 206 Tours with our friends. We weren’t quite sure what to expect when our original tour (100) was cancelled and we found ourselves with a different tour group – but our email communication was always effective due to 206 getting back to us promptly and organising everything for our change of tour. When our backpacks arrived, we felt secure in the knowledge that everything would go to plan. We read all the information that was sent to us and it equipped us very well.\n\nEvery transfer that was arranged (beyond that of the tour schedule) to accommodate our needs went precisely as planned. At no stage were we left wondering what was happening. When we arrived in Italy, 2 days ahead of the rest of the group and saw the person holding to 206 sign, we were very relieved and our confidence in our plans with 206 was validated.\n\nThe days on the tour were unforgettable. We were with a wonderful group of Americans and will remain in touch with many of them. Our tour guide, Alessandro, was knowledgable and efficient. He was very professional. Our bus driver, Caludio, was and expert at negotiating the Italian way of driving and kept us safe at all times. Safety protocols were followed very well. Each day was mapped out for us the previous evening, so that the next day was clear. Every day was jam -packed, but the presence of expert guides for the days meant that we had access to wonderful information, excellent seats and no waiting in queues.\n\nFor us, the journey into the roots of our faith was significant. Daily Mass and spiritual experiences will stay with us for some time and have had a profound impact on our Catholic identity and its meaning for us in the world both within our small sphere of influence and more broadly.\n\nWe are very grateful to have been made aware of 206 by our priest and may choose to travel with you again in future. We learned both the advantages and disadvantages of being part of a group tour (something we had not done before) and the advantages far outweighed the disadvantages.\n\nThank you for your efficient communication, organisation and overall coordination of our experience in Italy.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nMartina Millard and Gavin Butcher\n\nDear Olivia:\n\nThank you for your welcome! Our experience was amazing and beyond what I could ever have imagined. I am so grateful for your company that organizes these tours as there is no doubt you are leading pilgrims to our Lord.\n\nOur Spiritual Leader, Father Kirby, was wonderful and welcoming. Our tour guide, Cristina, went above and beyond to make our trip the best possible.\n\nThe most memorable part of my trip would have to be the nightly lit processions with so many other Christians singing praises to Mary and all in different languages.\n\nI can’t think of anything that was too difficult. Maybe our connecting flight back home where we only had 40 minutes to get to our next flight and we had customs to get thru, but we did make it. The stewardess was very accommodating in that they let us move up front once everyone was seated.\n\nI was surprised by how much we were able to pack in in such a short time. My main purpose was to go to Lourdes, so experiencing Fatima and all the other amazing places just added to the experience. I was so inspired by the people who have gone before us that have built these beautiful Basilicas and left us the legacy that they have.\n\nMy only suggestion would be that you do not need $50 in ones as most of the candles in the churches required Euro coins. I came home with almost all of my ones and fives and they were bulky.\n\nI received blessings beyond measure on this trip. To be able to bring home Holy Water from Lourdes and place all the intentions that people sent me with to both the apparitions, meant so much and has meant so much to the people that I have shared with. I can’t thank you enough. God bless you all and your work!\n\nPeace be with you,\n\nMichelle Schick\n\nDear Milanka,\n\nI write to thank you and your organization for an incredible Holy Land Luxury tour. My husband and I are telling everyone we know to take this pilgrimage. It touched us on so many levels and far exceeded the high expectations we had. From start to finish, we were impressed and delighted. Let me highlight a few areas:\n\nUpon receiving our flight information, it became obvious that it made more sense to just fly directly out of Newark versus leaving from Philadelphia and taking chances on connecting flights. Chris Wright resolved this for me during a simple, eight-minute phone call. A live person answered the phone, listened to my concern and resolved it! I am very grateful and surprised by this uncommon customer service. I was the one who elected to originally fly out of Phila, not knowing a direct flight was available in Newark by easily driving 30 minutes further.\n\nHaving guides meet weary travelers at the airport and then return them to the airport to guide them through the unfamiliar steps was very much appreciated.\n\nThe pilgrimage itself exceeded our expectations! Every stop pulled back a veil. Attending Mass in our Lord’s tomb was the most emotional spiritual experience. Renewing our wedding vows at Cana touched me deeply. I could go and on about how powerful the packed pilgrimage was.\n\nOur tour guide George (Yorgos Chermantas) was fabulous. He has a gift of being able to relate to a group of various ages and backgrounds and blend a group of strangers into a family by mid-week. He is extremely articulate, knowledgeable and responsible. George took the pilgrimage to another level with his charismatic gifts. He assisted fellow travelers all week with whatever issue arose (heat, missing luggage, travel advice, where can I buy this? Delayed flights…) with a genuine kindness. You have an excellent tour guide in George. It was a privilege to be on his tour. I would be remiss in not complementing our driver who was excellent and kept us safe the entire week. Between George and our driver, I felt completely safe on our tour and that had been my main concern prior to the trip. I cannot understate the gratitude I feel for both our tour guide and driver.\n\nFinally, kudos to the Hotel Inbal! Hopefully we will make this pilgrimage again and we will insist on the Hotel Inbal. The food was fantastic! So fresh, so delicious and so much variety. I would get to breakfast the moment it opened so I could enjoy it until we had to get on the shuttle. I miss the breakfast and dinner buffet tremendously.\n\nThank you, Milanka, for all the extra effort your company puts into its pilgrimages. Your company is definitely five stars to us. We hope to enjoy many more pilgrimages with 206 and only regret not starting sooner.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKelly and John Hullihan\n\nDear 206 Tours staff,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to comment on my recent pilgrimage along the Camino de Santiago with 206 Tours. I must say, it exceeded my wildest expectations in every possible way.\n\nFirst and foremost, I would like to express my deep gratitude to our Spiritual Director, Father Ivan Dawson.\n\nHis wisdom, guidance, and unwavering faith truly enriched our journey.\n\nFather Dawson’s profound insights and compassionate presence made our pilgrimage an unforgettable spiritual experience.\n\nHis devotion to our group and his ability to foster a sense of community among us was truly remarkable.\n\nI would also like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to our outstanding guide, Jorge.\n\nHis extensive knowledge of the Camino, its history, and its spiritual significance added a layer of depth to our journey.\n\nJorge’s infectious enthusiasm and genuine care for each and every one of us made our trek all the more memorable.\n\nHis leadership and constant support were invaluable, ensuring that we remained on the right path, both literally and figuratively.\n\nAs we embarked on this pilgrimage, I had certain expectations regarding the accommodations and meals. To my delight, both aspects exceeded all expectations.\n\nThe accommodations arranged by 206 Tours were of exceptional quality, providing us with comfortable and welcoming spaces to rest and rejuvenate after each day’s walk.\n\nThe thoughtfulness and attention to detail were evident, making us feel truly cared for throughout our journey.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the food! I must confess, the culinary experiences along the Camino were nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nFrom hearty regional dishes to delightful local delicacies, every meal was a feast for the senses. The flavors, the freshness, and the presentation were simply outstanding.\n\nI indulged in each bite, savoring the remarkable gastronomic treasures the Camino had to offer.\n\nIn fact, despite our daily walking of 75 miles, I must admit that I gained a few pounds. But it was all worth it!\n\nMy pilgrimage along the Camino de Santiago with 206 Tours was an extraordinary experience that surpassed all expectations.\n\nThe combination of Father Ivan Dawson’s spiritual guidance, Jorge’s exceptional leadership, the comfortable accommodations, and the outstanding culinary delights made this journey a truly transformative one.\n\nThe memories that were created and the lessons I learned will continue to inspire and guide me on my spiritual path.\n\nIn conclusion, I have taken 5 pilgrimages in the past, none were with 206 Tours. None of my previous pilgrimages equaled the quality of the tour with 206 Tours.\n\n206 tours stands head and shoulders above the rest.\n\nBuen Camino\n\nDear Judith and Natasha,\n\nOur Pilgrimage DID exceed our expectations! Our sweet group never had a twisted ankle, got sick, were late, had a delayed flight, or any problem at all…except it rained EVERYDAY.\n\nI believe everyone experienced the peace in Medjugorje and the huge bronze statue of the Risen Christ was weeping; they all took a turn to gather a drop or two of His right side while weeping. The healing Mass with Father Ed Murphy at the previous church of Father Jozo touched all of us. SO many categories to complement you on that it seems only right to detail and number them:\n\n1. Ivan is just a gem, always clear about our daily schedule, and a very knowledgeable historian, It didn’t rain all day our first day in Medjugorje so we got to climb Apparition Mountain…and several went back again, even in the rain. Our day in Dubrovnik was our only sunny day and it was a perfect day trip, with our own Mass with Father James in St. Blaise Church and the exquisite small altar. That local city guide covered a lot of ground in an hour or so and was excellent. We had a total of about 3+ hours which was just about right for the Mass, guided tour, and free time.\n\n2. Sabinia is absolutely delightful, also always welcoming with a huge warm smile…despite all the rain! I think we were all dazzled by Poland and the years of Christianity with a Catholic church on almost every corner. It’s impossible to rate these two guides because they each are not doing their job for the money…they love their country and the group they are in charge of…”shepherding” if you wish…for a very short period and they give 100% with very long days in a “brief sprint of time”. All the local guides at each site did a great job with all the detail, each unique in their presentation…especially loved the little nun at St Faustina’s chapel and the older monk at the Jasna Gora Monastery.\n\n3. What was in the daily Poland itinerary was incredible. As a small group, we thought it was paced very well and never seemed rushed. I was particularly amazed at each and every time we had a scheduled private Mass for Father James, the altar was ready…with candles lite, wine and water on the altar, etc. Father could vest up and be ready in minutes to celebrate Mass. That’s years of your organizational skills on display, Natasha!\n\n4. Our one sunny day in Dubrovnik was a highlight…everyone in the group seemed delighted to visit this historic walled-in city on the Adriatic. The choice of the day fit perfectly into our Medjugorje schedule…not at the beginning and not the last day. You kindly included my friend to join me that day without cost, Kathy Lauwers, who is a dear friend and was in Medjugorje that week with her husband…they have adopted a young boy in the Children’s Village and come frequently to see him.\n\n5. Rosa “held court” at the very inviting Sulic Pansion! Our rooms were so clean and well done, our corner table for 9 was always delightful with those platters of great homemade food. Great location, charming hostess, and every effort to make us welcome was extended. The huge coffee machine for lattes, etc. was appreciated by the group. I left a very large room tip just for my cleaning gal and she was in tears.\n\n6. The Warsaw “splurge” of the Mamaison was elegant and being very tight on time, a perfect location to start our “old town” tour right there! The supper was as beautifully done as were the rooms. The last hotel, Radisson Blu, was a 3-night stay and dazzled us with a written menu each night of gourmet suppers. Wine and water being included each and every night was mentioned by several as “how nice it was to come down for supper and have no extra expense”. Several told me that they had never had the quality of the food on this trip, compared to other world tours they had been on.\n\n7. We were all impressed with both the Luthansa and the Austria Airlines. Bathrooms were clean from the start of the flight to the finish.\n\n8. Now that we are all home, glowing reports keep coming. I see 5, sometimes 6, out of our 9 at daily Mass with Father James…the nice part about having our own parish group…the good rapport will be there forever.\n\nIn conclusion, so many thanks for walking me through all the beginning steps of our venture. The “stamp of approval” comes from all of us for the exceptional planning and performance by 206 Tours. When you say the guide will be there at the airport, the guide IS there! I’m already thinking of next May ’24 parish pilgrimage…\n\nIn Christ and Mary,\n\nPat V.\n\nIt is with great pleasure for me to provide feedback on how the pilgrimage experience has changed my life and outlook on things. First, I want to thank all parties involved with making this the most awesome experience of my life. From the beginning till the end, it was truly First Class all the way. I originally booked this tour in 2019 but due to the COVID restrictions had to postpone it numerous times, but I am glad I waited, it was remarkable. Once I began the actual journey it was flawless, from the pick up at the airport in Tel-Aviv to the return to the airport, everything ran like clockwork. Our guide Josef Kurt was extraordinary, his knowledge of the history of each place and his ability to make the Bible come alive and make sense by tying all of the Old Testament to the New Testament, shed a whole new light on my understanding and experience. My scripture reading will never be the same now that my mind has been opened. It was like Jesus explaining the scriptures to the travelers on the road to Emmaus.\n\nI was so impressed with everything, I would rate it a 5 Star experience, the hotels and food were way beyond my expectations. First Class all the way. I actually kept a journal of everything and prepared a presentation to align with my pictures which is a 3-hour session. I presented it to my church in Florida and it was extremely well received. This accounts for my delay in responding sooner, it took a great deal of time to put all of the pieces of the trip together to align with the journal.\n\nTo share some of my feelings about the trip I am including an excerpt from my journal reflections:\n\n“This trip has forever changed my life. I look at the Bible, Rosary, Stations of the Cross, and Mass and they have a whole new meaning for me since I actually walked where Jesus walked. It is now my time to preach the Fifth Gospel. The Fifth Gospel is the sharing of this pilgrimage and the experiences I had while in the Holy Land. It is the experience of walking where Jesus walked and contemplating the events that occurred at the sites that we visited. It is the sharing of this experience, not unlike what the first disciples did after the resurrection; and continuing to preach the gospels through the way we live to the ends of the earth. “\n\nI would highly recommend this pilgrimage to anyone and would love to share my experience further if needed. Thanks for a wonderful, life-changing experience and I look forward to the next pilgrimage I take with 206 Tours, Inc.\n\nKean Knerr\n\nIt is so hard to process and describe the incredible experience, both spiritually and emotionally, on this pilgrimage.\n\nOur Tour Guide, Yosef Kurk and our Spiritual Director, Fr. Joel were both outstanding,.\n\nYosef was a walking encyclopedia with his knowledge of the History of the Holy Land and presented it in a very informative and sequential manner. His knowledge of the Bible goes with out saying. Plus, he had a tremendous personality complete with patience for those of us who had “overload” with all the information he imparted.\n\nMany of our friends and family have inquired about our trip and as my husband has said numerous times. “No adjectives could adequately described our journey.” Our reply every day was a blessing and brought us closer to God. Mass was celebrated by Fr. Joel, at the Main Altars in the Churches we visited. Especially moving was our private Mass in the Holy Sepulcher Church with the Franciscans, their choir and Fr. Joel participating the the Mass. It was a High Mass at 7:30am scheduled after our 4:30am Via Dolorosa walk. Fr. Joel involved us in the Mass, as members of our group were asked to plan the songs and he assigned readings. How special for my husband to do a reading in the Church of the Transfiguration and hold the chalice for Fr. Joel during communion. Another member of our group was given a reading during the Mass in the Holy Sepulcher. So moving and thoughtful for him to have us partake in these wonderful experiences.\n\nIt’s a wonder how anyone would doubt their faith after seeing, walking the path that Jesus walked, which was brought to life by the guidance of Yosef and Fr. Joel. The whole pilgrimage brought full circle the beauty of Israel, the peacefulness of the sites we saw and the Agony Jesus experienced so we could “live”.\n\n206 Tours was first class in all aspects from arranging out Flights to the First Class Hotels and also the incredible meals. We were told by other travel agents, not to miss having dinner at the top of the Notre Dame Center in Jerusalem . How fortunate was our tour to stay there and enjoy the exquisite meals 3 days. The hotel was so conveniently located right across from the New Gate into Old Jerusalem .\n\nThis pilgrimage changed our lives. We brought home with us a greater understanding of our faith and a peaceful heart. Thank you for making that happen.\n\nSusan\n\nDear Liz & Natasha,\n\nI was very blest to be on this past Pilgrimage, March 25 – April4, 2023. It was a most wonderful experience.\n\nFr. Michael was an outstanding Spiritual Director. His Masses and homilies were quite amazing, so reverent. His great love for the Eucharist touched us all and strengthened us.\n\nPenny did a fantastic job in working so well with Fr. Michael and Mary, our Guide. It was great that we could celebrate her birthday on our final night. In her most loving way, she made sure that each one of us was doing well, always looking out for our wellbeing.\n\nMary our Guide: I can’t say enough about Mary. I wish the tour was a semester course taught by Mary. She is so extremely knowledgeable of the Holy Land, has such a wonderful demeanor, and totally unflappable. She even had to handle her son being hurt at school. She watched over us when other groups were around, making sure we were together and kept our place in line as a group. Even when she had to search out someone who was late getting back to the bus, she was always smiling and never got upset. She kept us all peaceful and calm. Her knowledge of every place we went to was quite outstanding. She never paused in sharing about a site, being totally capable of sharing the full picture. She often spoke of the words of a site and their etymology and meaning from or in Hebrew and/or Aramaic. I can’t imagine a better Guide.\n\nIt was a very blessed experience for me. What 206 provided materially was a big help, from the books, guide to the Holy Land, back pack, etc..\n\nThank you so very much,\n\nand God bless your work.\n\nTom Scheuring\n\nHi Alexandra,\n\nWe wanted to take a moment to express our thanks and gratitude for an amazing pilgrimage to the Holy Land. You were wonderful to work with and made our trip planning so easy. Thank you for being attentive to our special requests and travel concerns. All of our connections and accommodations were great. I know there is so much more you did behind the scenes and we are grateful for all that you did.\n\nFr. Dawid Kwiatkowski was a great inspiration to us as we felt a deeper connection to Jesus and the Holy Land through his teachings and especially his daily gospels. We are very thankful that Fr. Dawid was our spiritual director on this pilgrimage. He kept us focused and mindful of the reason we were on this journey. Thanks to Fr. Dawid our hearts are bursting with love for Jesus and the Catholic faith and all its teachings.\n\nWords cannot express the gratitude we have for our guide, Sami Backleh. Sami is a wealth of information when it comes to his country, the Holy Land, the Bible, walking with Jesus, and all the cultures surrounding this area. Sami was always kind, cheerful, attentive, understanding, patient, joyful, and professional. He was a magician when it came to getting our group to the right place at the right time. He seemed to be loved by fellow guides and students we’d run into along the way. They would tell us how wonderful he was and what a great teacher and how lucky we were to have him. We couldn’t agree more. Sami truly made this pilgrimage amazing! We feel so blessed to have had him as our guide through the Holy Land. He is the best and we would highly recommend Sami Backleh for any of your tours.\n\nThank you again for everything.\n\nGod Bless,\n\nMary Beth and Tom Wilson\n\nHi Danielle,\n\nFirst of all, we’d like to thank you for the help you provided us as we prepared for this adventure. You were prompt in getting back to us and all the communication was much appreciated. Kudos to you!\n\nWe want to let you know how very much we loved this pilgrimage! It was the most beautiful experience and a journey that we will always treasure. We did come home exhausted, but that probably means the pilgrimage was a success. We are finally feeling more rested and wanted to send a quick critique, (not in any particular order).\n\nThe guides and drivers were amazing, knowledgeable, respectful and sensitive to our needs. We were a large group, but they managed everything so efficiently. We wish we could have absorbed it better; it was truly so much to take in.\n\nIt felt like there were many thoughtful touches throughout the pilgrimage; specifically: there were special prayers at the various sites–and this may have been because of our spiritual guides–but it was wonderful to renew our baptismal promises at the Jordan River, to pray the Our Father in the prison cave, to renew our vows, complete with veils and roses at Cana. The early time for the Way of the Cross was appreciated as well as the Holy Hour at the Church at Gethsemane and the High Mass at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Sailing on the Sea of Galilee and having the crew raise the American flag and singing the National Anthem also meant a lot to us.\n\nWe loved the backpacks and all the extras too–the rosary and booklets etc.\n\nPacking so much into the pilgrimage days was great and left us wanting more and also to learn more history now that we are home. We always felt safe, probably due to our capable guides and drivers.\n\nThe food was amazing and it was much appreciated to have the lunches arranged. We all felt we were eating too much, but looking back we felt it was needed nutrition for all the steps we took! Interestingly, we did not gain weight either.\n\nThe hotels were very nice and staff helpful.\n\nThank you for all your attention to detail and for making this a once in a lifetime experience.\n\nWe will be forever grateful!!\n\nGod Bless you,\n\nJim & Mary\n\nThank you 206 for organizing this pilgrimage.\n\nMary Theresa and I enjoyed every moment and every single site.\n\nRami is an exceptional tour guide with a contagious deep Faith and conviction. We were in awe of his historic knowledge of the events that happened at every holy site and we appreciated his explanation of customs and traditions at the time of Jesus which enabled us to understand more fully the context and background of life in the days of Christ. We loved how well prepared he was every single day, informing us of what to expect, what to watch for, what to do and what not to do. He was spot on 100% all the time. 206 tours is lucky to have Rami. Mousse, our bus driver was simply amazing, caring making sure we were comfortable and hydrated everyday. He was kind, respectful and always lending a helping hand literally and May God bless him for maneuvering this big bus around those narrow windy roads. We were so blessed to have our beloved Pastor with us who guided us in prayer at the beginning of each day, and celebrated daily Masses in the most beautiful churches extracting the most beautiful meaningful lessons in his homilies bringing us closer to Jesus. Deacon John this humble faithful servant was also a blessing to all, he always had a listening ear and a lending hand to Father Mark and to each of us pilgrims. I personally enjoyed talking to the locals in my native tongue and was touched by their warmth kindness and resilience. This was a pilgrimage of a life time. I certainly have a new and deep appreciation of the mission of tours like this to help and uphold the presence of these Holy grounds for generations to come. I feel a deep sense of connectedness to my Lord and Savior and to the Land in which he grew up, lived and died to save me and all who want to be saved. Thank you and God bless you! Thank you for the goodie bag and for the pilgrim certificate.\n\nNajat\n\nHello Danielle,\n\nI just wanted to thank you for all that you did to ensure our large group of pilgrims (93) had a wonderful trip to the Holy Land. It was fantastic! I’m trying to burn through the jet lag but couldn’t let too much time go by without thanking you for the trip planning that took place prior to us departing. I’m an organizer and planner by nature and KNOW it was a HUGE job to put it all together, especially for such a big group, and I truly appreciate your efforts. I usually do all of the trip planning for our household so it was great to just sign up, pay up and get on the plane without much effort on my part.\n\nI also wanted to say that our guides, Yorgos a.k.a. George, and Sa’id, were FANTASTIC! Their Biblical, historical, cultural and regional knowledge were exceptional. As I told many of my traveling companions, it was like drinking through a fire hose each day for me. I also told them that those two guys know more about what’s going on in the world than the collective “brain trust” at the US State Dept.! They were extremely patient with us; with such a large group it was often times like herding cats. I know they had long days and sometimes short nights to get us to all of our destinations and they deserve a bonus for guiding us so well. The drivers were great too! I wouldn’t want to be driving that long bus on those small, windy roads and switchbacks but they navigated it all with ease.\n\nMy husband and I traveled with a friend group of eight. (We were on the green bus with Yorgos). We all were impressed with the hotel accommodations and food. I especially liked the different restaurants located in the towns we were traveling in just to get a good feel for the culture in Israel. All of the food was good too. I don’t even want to know how much weight I gained along the way!\n\nI don’t want to come off of this honeymoon high from my pilgrimage there as my faith was deepened and I feel closer to Christ than ever before, for which I was hoping. A truly beautiful experience that will be forever seared in my memory along with the numerous photos and notes I took along the way. Now I’m trusting in the Lord to answer my pilgrimage intention.\n\nThanks again for all you do and for 206 Tours. I’ve been spreading the word about your company so others can have a similar, wonderful experience.\n\nCori and Dan\n\nHi Danielle,\n\nThanks for the invitation to review my pilgrimage to the Holy Land and Rome. Did it exceed my expectations? Where do I begin?\n\nI cannot possibly remember all of the wonderful, happy, blessed moments that occurred on this, my first pilgrimage. I am so glad I booked it through 206 Tours!\n\nWhen I booked as a solo traveler who had never been overseas, I was a little nervous. So many worries!\n\nAlmost from the moment I collected my baggage and entered the arrivals hall at Ben Gurion airport, my worries disappeared. There was Habib, our guide, waiting for me and the others who had taken the same flight. We were bused to the hotel, and a short time later we met the rest of our group and Father Andrew at our first Mass together. With each shared meal, with each expedition from one holy site to the next, with each Mass that we celebrated as group, our bond of friendship became stronger. By the end of our time in the Holy Land, I felt like a kid leaving summer camp – leaving her new wonderful friends behind and hoping to see them again next summer.\n\nOur Holy Land guide, Habib, is excellent. He could not have been more gracious, accommodating, and fun. What I learned from him and the holy sites we visited, I could not have learned through years of studying the Bible at home here in the U.S. If I had to grade Habib, I’d give him an A+++. We visited so many churches and other sites, it could have seemed like a big blur of sightseeing activity, but the trip was so well planned it didn’t seem like that at all. Habib’s lessons about each site were meaningful, well taught, and insightful. I cannot say emphatically enough how great it was to have the “Whisper” devices so that I didn’t miss a word. I love that we had prayerful moments and scripture readings at each of the churches. It was so meaningful to have Mass celebrated each day by Father Andrew. Having each liturgy so thoroughly match the location where we celebrated Mass was very, very special. I really felt as if I were growing closer to Our Lord Jesus day by day. A few of the activities that stand out most in my memory include: a) Singing the Ave Maria in the wonderfully rich acoustics at St. Anne’s b) Sitting behind the altar during Mass at the Church of the Transfiguration c) Gathering around and touching the rock of agony during Mass at the Church at Gethsemane d) visiting the Holy Sepulcher and having Mass inside the tomb and e) praying the Stations of the Cross on the Via De La Rosa. Two additional special highlights occurred at our Notre Dame hotel. Father David gave us a tour and explanation of the Shroud of Turin exhibit. That was very moving. We also had the great privilege of meeting the artist, Daniel Cariola, and being some of the first pilgrims to see his AMAZING, awe inspiring Pentacost project in progress.\n\nThe hotels at which we stayed were beautiful. My room at each was clean, comfortable, and restful. The lobby at each hotel was beautiful, welcoming, and comfortable. We were spoiled in so many ways, but mostly by the food! The buffets were splendid — more choices and more delicious food than imaginable. The bread was astonishingly great. Nowhere in America will you find bread as hearty, fresh and flavorful as the bread we had every morning and every evening at our hotels. The rooftop restaurant at the Notre Dame hotel was my favorite. We were spoiled by wonderful abundant meals and wine. And, we were spoiled by terrific wait staffs at each hotel. Even our lunches – out in local neighborhood restaurants throughout Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and elsewhere — were delicious, and the service was exemplary. Mufeed was our driver. He got us safely and so skillfully to all the sites we visited! He could not have been more pleasant and gracious. It was always good to come back to the bus to be greeted by his smile. The last day of our trip, Habib and Mufeed picked us up in the middle of the night to get us to the airport. That’s dedication. Everything about The Holy Land tour with 206 Tours absolutely exceeded my expectations!\n\nAbout a dozen of us continued on to Rome with 206. Rome was spectacular. Hotel accommodations were very nice. Staff was very kind. Food was great! Wait staff was excellent. Our days were jam packed. It was great to explore four major basilicas and churches, the Vatican Museum, and the Pope. It was nice to have a little free time in the afternoon to shop, explore and experience some of the tastes of Italy. Mmm gelato! The art at the Vatican Museum and St. Peter’s Basilica is incomparably, stunningly, beautiful. Every square inch of St Peter’s is dedicated to beauty. So splendid, it is indescribable. St John Lateran, St Mary Major, and St Paul Beyond The Walls are gorgeous, too. Climbing the Holy Stairs is an experience I won’t forget. Our 206 guide, Federica, was delightful, so kind, so friendly, and so helpful. Titiana, our official Roman guide, was very knowledgeable, patient, and kind. I learned a lot from her. Father Piotr is a wonderful priest and spiritual director — so intelligent, so learned, yet so easy to talk with. I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Rome. However, it all went by too fast!\n\nInitially, when I booked my pilgrimage, I’d asked for Tour 118, The Holy Land, Rome, and The Shrines of Italy. Due to lack of enough pilgrims having chosen the same, the third leg of the journey, The Shrines, was cancelled. At the time, I was offered the choice to do only the Holy Land and Rome on the originally chosen dates, or to choose a later date for the triple tour. I am so very glad I chose the first option! I met the most wonderful fellow pilgrims, whom I now call friends. Whenever I think of them, I smile. This whole experience has made me so happy, so full, and yet so yearning to learn more about our Catholic faith and to daily take one step closer to Jesus, closer to that elusive goal of holiness. I’m so glad I threw a coin (a sheckel) into Trevi Fountain! I was back home only one day when, just before Sunday Mass, I saw a flyer in the vestibule at my home parish. Our own pastor, Father Bing, is planning on taking a group of parishioners on a pilgrimage to The Shrines of Italy with 206 Tours. Italy, here I come again!\n\nCarol Mazikowski\n\nGood Morning Liz and Natasha\n\nI have not words to express my gratitude for such an amazing time that the group and I experienced these past days. Everything was perfect, on time, with great quality, friendly and love. The hotels were fantastic. Our Tour Guide, Habibi an extraordinary and knowledgeable person. The food very tasty. Our driver. gentle and nice. Well, everything was perfect even the weather.\n\nFor this reason I know that more parishioners will be interested to do it next year. I will not be able to do it but I am copy Fr. Ruben, who is my Parochial Vicar, because I wish that he can have this unforgettable time in the Land of the Lord.\n\nMy group found this text from the Museum and I want for you to enjoy it in thanksgiving for your services and especially for the deep care that you and your company showed to us in this pilgrimage.\n\nThe Thanksgiving Scroll\n\n1QHA 9-12\n\nI am dust and ashes what can I plan if you do not wish it\n\nWhat can I devise without your will\n\nHow can I be strong if you do not make me stand\n\nHow can I be learned if you do not mold me\n\nWhat can I say if you do not open my mouth\n\nHow can I answer if you do not give me insight\n\nSee, you are the prince of God’s in the king of the glorious ones\n\nLord of every spirit\n\nRuler of every preacher\n\nApart from you nothing happens and nothing is known without your will\n\nThere is no one besides you\n\nFREDY\n\nGood Morning Liz and Natasha\n\nI have not words to express my gratitude for such an amazing time that the group and I experienced these past days.

Jhon\n\nHi Milanka,\n\nI just wanted to let you know that the Pilgrimage last week was phenomenal! My husband and I brought our three adult children, ages 22, 19, & 17. We all had an AMAZING week. This was the second trip for me and my husband. We had a great experience in 2019 with a different tour group, however, this trip with 206 was even BETTER!\n\nHere are some things we liked better…\n\n1. Sophie Hotel in Tiberias was great! We loved that it was a little smaller than Olive Tree. (Olive Tree was good, but it is big, crowded, and loud. Not a deal breaker, but just not as quaint as Sophie.)\n\n2. We appreciated that all the meals, including lunch, were included. Pete especially liked the wine with dinner.\n\n3. The entire trip in the Holy Land went so smoothly. We were so impressed with that. As far as I could tell, not one single thing went wrong.\n\n4. Habib, our tour guide, was off the charts amazing! He was everything you would want in a tour guide. It was super great that he is Catholic, so he was able to teach us about Catholic things. In addition, he is well versed in the Bible. He made connections from a variety of Bible passages and locations. He was good at keeping the group engaged by asking questions and answering questions. In addition, we had one pilgrim who was older and a little unstable. Habib was always checking on him and many times helping him up and down stairs, etc. He was always on time, friendly, organized, etc. I seriously cannot think of one single complaint about him.\n\nThank you so much for all the work you and your team put into making this an amazing trip! From now on, 206 will be the only tour group I use and recommend!\n\nKristine Bruce"
