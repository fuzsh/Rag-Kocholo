        "text": "In contrast to the typically more primitive, although charming, style of his fellow artists in this pueblo, Avelino’s pieces are extremely fine and have more contemporary lines. Inspired by cartoons, his work is also noted for its playful quality, e.g., animal musicians (toucans, roosters, goats to name a few) singing with their microphones. He also creates irreverent angels with one wing up and the other down. Avelino did not grow up in an artisanal family but rather taught himself to carve at the age of 30, encouraged by his cousin to paint. He uses acrylic paints with very fine brush strokes, in contrast to the other artists in his village who use aniline paints.\n\nGabino’s elaborate carving style stands apart the predominately rustic products one finds in the pueblo of La Unión. He creates finely-detailed carvings, such as his Virgin of Guadalupe, replete with a bouquet of delicately-colored flowers. It is Gabino’s intention to surprise his visitors with the expansiveness of his imagination. For instance, he carves a classic black and white cow; however, on its belly is the Virgin, below which is a table whose legs double as teats for the calf that accompanies its mother. By wedging cactus fiber into crevices in a carved donkey’s mouth, he suggests it is chewing alfafa. Gabino does all the highly detailed carving of his pieces, while his wife does the majority of the painting. It is uncommon to find pieces available for sale since he works predominantly on commissions.\n\nArtistically sensitive even as a young boy, Obed began his path as an artist at 6 by taking a variety of courses at the Culture House of his pueblo of Miahuatlán. He had good teachers who guided him through a variety of artistic expressions. Over time he leaned towards painting, while mastering multiple techniques; he also became very skillful working with wood and acquired expertise in carving miniatures and larger pieces. Obed finds his inspiration in everyday situations. He acknowledges the art that emerges from traditional trades. His piece is a testimony to hope that trades threatened with extinction will nevertheless survive.\n\nPueblo of Miahuatlán de Porfirio Díaz\n\n(two hours outside of Oaxaca City)\n\nRiva Palacio #301\n\nvick_sculptor@hotmail.com\n\n(From US) Cell: 011-52-951-183-0150\n\n(In Oaxaca) Cell: 951-183-0150\n\nVictor, two-time winner in woodcarving in FOFA’s young artists’ contests, began carving in his early 20s in a pueblo two hours from Oaxaca City not known for its woodcarving. He was inspired by reading books by anthropologist Carlos Castañeda, whose work in shamanism led him to espouse sophisticated ideas that included an alternative reality endowed with energy. This piece, carved from an ancient tree, expresses the joy Victor experiences in nature, referencing the fact that after death we end up inside and part of the earth. Victor has incorporated many symbols, such as a virgin who carries a ball in her hands, which he says represents nature’s gifts for humanity: the sun, the air, the soil, the food.\n\nUlises draws on ancient Zapotec themes in this complex carving. The front features a fighter wearing the headdress of a jaguar, bearing the water serpent deity. The back portrays an eagle warrior whose head becomes a raised human fist. On the eagle’s back a woman emerges from an agave plant, symbolizing the harvest. We see a “Danzante” (dancer) figure from the ruins of Monte Albán, and the familiar geometric “glifos” (glyphs). Ulises is committed to recapturing this heritage: “These symbols are my ancestors’ ancient language. They can speak to us if we choose to listen. This rich past is our strength.”\n\nDavid is the son of a carpenter, so wood has always been part of his life. However, he is the only one in his family who has become a wood carving artist. In his magnificent carved serpent David uses animals to express the inspiration of his ancestors, people rooted in traditions. The jaguar reflects the strength of his people, the bat chaotic times (the pandemic), and the eagle’s claw refers to force. The serpent itself symbolizes the constant motion of the world and of water. When held upright, the flow of tiny stones inside the serpent sounds like flowing water.\n\nÁlvaro, who participated in his first FOFA/MEAPO contest in 2018, turned a challenging trunk of Montezuma cypress into a two-piece figure: a grandfather and a basket. He believes the strength of his people is found in older people, like this old man in the typical posture of a grandfather in the countryside. The grandfather is carrying a heavy basket that represents the village, filled with food he has produced. The basket has cracks, because the town has disagreements created by such things as the controversy around mining companies and politics in Miahuatlán."
