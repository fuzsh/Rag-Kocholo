They were selected by Heath, who will serve as MLS head coach in the showcase event against Mexico’s Liga MX. Heath selected 12 of the 26 players on the roster.\n\n“It’s a huge accomplishment for me personally,” said St. Clair, a fourth-year player making his first All-Star Game appearance. “For the club as well to be hosting it and have a couple of players involved. … And congrats to Rey as well.”\n\nReynoso, who earned an All-Star Game nod a year ago, has a team-high seven goals and five assists this season. He is one of only three MLS players with that level of production this season, along with Nashville’s Hany Mukhtar (10 goals, five assists) and Philadelphia’s Daniel Gazdag (seven goals, five assists).\n\nSt. Clair, who stepped into the starting role in the third game of this season, ranks second in MLS in expected goals minus goals allowed (plus-5.5). St. Clair has 63 total saves, one of only five goalkeepers in the league with at least 60 saves this season.\n\n“They are both worthy of the accolade because, certainly Dayne, since he has come into the team has been outstanding,” Heath said. “Everybody knows my feelings on Rey. He is starting to put some end product to the game that we know he’s got.”\n\nHeath said Loons midfielder Robin Lod “deserved an opportunity, but that wasn’t to be. Overall, as you can see with the squad, there is a lot of quality there and a lot of quality that hasn’t made it as well.”\n\nLod could be considered as an injury replacement for selected players withdrawing over the next month.\n\nUnited attacker Darwin Quintero and defender Francisco Calvo made the All-Star Game together in 2018, fullback Romain Metanire went in 2019.\n\nReynoso did not play in last year’s game in Los Angeles due to a handful of slight injuries. The Argentine is the club’s first two-time all-star.\n\nBENITEZ SIGNS\n\nUnited announced Tuesday the signing of right back Alan Benitez to a contract through the 2024 season and a club option for 2025. Benitez was going to be out of contract with Paraguayan club Cerro Porteno at the end of the season, which helps lessen transfer costs for the Loons.\n\nBenitez, 28, has played for the Paraguyan national team and for three different clubs in Paraguay’s Primera Division since 2017. He has four goals and five assists across those six seasons.\n\nThe Loons have sought more attacking threats from their right back this season as Metanire has played just 22 minutes due to nagging hamstring injuries. D.J. Taylor has become the primary right back as the season progressed.\n\n“He’s very very good in an opponent’s half, very forward thinking,” Heath said of Benitez. “… A big part of our attacking play is getting our outside backs further up the pitch, and he’s certainly got really good quality in the final third.”\n\nHeath said the Loons consulted with striker Luis Amarilla, a teammate on the Paraguyan national team, and Amarilla “spoke glowingly about him as a professional.” MNUFC reps also traveled to South America to watch Benitez play live.\n\nBRIEFLY\n\nMinnesota (8-8-2) puts its three-game winning streak on the line against Sporting Kansas City (5-11-4) at 7 p.m. Wednesday. It will air on ESPN, with their top broadcast group, Jon Champion and Taylor Twellman, on the call. … Benitez trained Monday and Tuesday, but will not be available to play Wednesday due to immigration paperwork that has not cleared. Benitez will occupy an international spot on the Loons roster. … Joseph Rosales has overcome his illness last week and was not on the club’s availability report Tuesday. Kervin Arriaga had swelling in his ankle injury subside, but he has not trained this week. … MNUFC2 brought in attacking midfielder Sagir Arce, 20, on a loan from Mazatlan FC on Saturday. The Kansas City, Missouri-born player had two assists in 323 Liga MX minutes in 2021-22 and six goals for its Under-20 side. He played 15 minutes in a 2-1 loss to St. Louis City 2 on Sunday. The Loons hold a purchase option on Arce, a source said. … Loons social media manager Mike Shields, who has been with the club for six years, has taken a position with the Men In Blazers soccer production.\n\nOriginally Published: July 12, 2022 at 11:00 a.m."
