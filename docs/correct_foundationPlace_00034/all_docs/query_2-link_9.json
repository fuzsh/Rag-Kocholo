        "text": "CHAP. I. The beginning of the War with Granada; King Albohacen surprizes Zahara; Alhama taken from the Infidels, and in vain besieged by them again.\n\nWE will begin this Book with the famous War of Granada, which was begun and carried on by King Ferdinand and Queen Elizabeth, for the space of ten Years, and in which happened many things very remarkable, and bloudy Battels were fought. The end of it was fortunate to Spain, and delightful to all Christendom, since it put a period to the Monarchy of the Moors, which had conti∣nued in this Nation above 700 Years, to our great Shame and Reproach The Kingdom of Granada lies between Murcia and Andaluzia, is about 700 Miles in compass, and extends far∣ther in length than breadth. From Ronda to Huesca it is counted 60 Leagues in length, and from Cambil to Almun̄ecar only 25 in breadth. It is bounded on the East with the Kingdom of Murcia, on the South with the Mediterranean Sea, on the West and North with Andaluzia. The Country is pleasant, and as fruitful as any in Spain, the very Mountains being full of Springs, and consequently always green. This occasions the Weather to be temperate both in Summer and Winter, especially in the City of Granada, the Metropolis of the Kingdom, one of the noblest and largest of all Spain, from which all that Province takes Name, and the City it self had it of a Cave which reaches to a Village called Alfahor, where it is reported the Natives formerly studied Art Magick. Gar in Arabick signifies a Cave, and certain Sol∣diers who came over with Tarif to the Conquest in Spain, being Natives of the City Nata in Syria, after that unhappy War was ended, fixed their abode in that Place. Of Gar and Nata was framed the Name Granada, as some Learned Men will have it. Other Etymologies of this Name are to be found, but it is needless to spend time in discussing that point. It is certain, that when this War began, there were in that Kingdom 14 Cities and 97 Towns. The principal Cities next to the Capital were Almeria, Malaga, and Guadix, called by Pliny Acci. They are all three Bishopricks, and well Peopled. The Division of Spain under so many several Monarchs, and the continual Supplies sent out of Africk, maintained this King∣dom of the Moors so many Ages. As soon as the Holy Inquisition was established, and the Authority of the Magistrates restored to its Vigour, Spain gathered Strength to extirpate the Dominion of the Moors: Besides the former Animosities betwixt the Two Nations of Moors and Christians on account of Religion, and Wrongs sustained in an Oppression of so many Years, the Infidels now added a new Motive for declaring War. Which was, That on the 27th of December, 1481. King Albohacen having Intelligence the Town of Zahara was unpro∣vided, he surprized it, that Place having been in the hands of the Christians ever since Prince Ferdinand, Grandfather to King Ferdinand, took it from the Moors. It was taken in a dark stormy Night, all the Townsmen that made resistance being put to the Sword, and the rest carried away Slaves to Granada. This Town the Moors fortified. K. Ferdinand and Q. Elizabeth, who were at Me∣dina del Campo, derstanding what had hapned, sent Orders to the Commanders on the Frontiers, and the Cities, to prepare for War, and be upon their Guard. The Moors excused themselves, pleading it was customary during a Truce to make Incursions on both sides, and even to take Towns, provided above 3 Days were not spent in the Attack, and they did not for∣mally encamp before them. Under this same Pretence, the Infidels, at the beginning of the following Year, 1482. attacked Castellar and Olbera, but could not carry them. These Wrongs moved the Christians to seek Revenge. A good Body gathered at Sevil with all Necessaries. Whilst they consulted on which side to make an Incursion, advice was given them that the Town of Alhama was ill Garisoned, and might easily be surprized. James Merlo, Deputy of Sevil, and the Marquess of Cadiz, with 2500 Horse, and 4000 Foot, marched 3 Days, and came to a Valley encompassed with high Hills. There they informed the Soldiers, who were much fatigued, that Alhama was but half a League from them, and encouraged them to undergo the small Labour that remained chearfully, putting them in mind of the rich Booty that Place would afford. 300 chosen Men advanced, and came late at night to the Walls. Perceiving no noise in the Castle, they applied their Scaling-Ladders, and mounted the Wall. The first that got up was John de Ortega, then another John born at Toledo, and the third Martin Galindo, all three resolute Soldiers. They killed the Sentinels, who were asleep, and some others; then opening the Gate, all the others rushed in. The Townsmen speedily cast up Works to secure themselves against the Castle, and were attacked at break of day by our Men;\n\nbut without success. Sancho de Avila, Governor of Carmona, and Martin de Rojas of Arcos, be∣bing too forward, were both killed in the Castle-Gate. Any delay was dangerous, because Granada was but 8 Leagues off. Some were for demolishing the Castle, and retiring: The Bolder sort were against quitting the Enterprize upon any account. This Advice prevailed, and the Town was assaulted on all sides. Some from without scaled the Walls; thither the Moors bent their whole Force, which gave those in the Castle an opportunity of entring the Town on that side. A resolute Fight was maintained in the Streets. The Christians were the better Soldiers, but the Infidels more numerous; yet both Parties stood their ground till night, when such as remained of the Enemy retired to a Mosque, where many were killed, and the rest made Slaves. Thus the loss of Zahara was doubly repaid. This was the beginning of that tedious and bloody War. Alhama was taken on the last Day of February. The taking of this Place struck a Terror into the Moors, and caused the Christians to stand upon their Guard. The Moors finding the Christians gained footing so near Granada, feared the approach∣ing Downfal of that Kingdom: Besides, they were afflicted at some Apparitions seen in the Air, and because an old Fortune-teller, as soon as the Infidels took Zahara, is said to have cried out, The Ruine of that Town (God grant what I say prove false) will fall upon our Heads! My Mind gives me the End of our Dominion in Spain draws near. This caused the King to raise Men throughout his Kingdom, and to march towards Alhama with 3000 Horse, and about 50000 Foot. So great an Army was terrible to our Men, who could not quit the Place without much Dishonour. They sent Messengers to all Parts to hasten Relief, and mean while ceased not Day or Night to repair the Walls and add new Works. The Safety of the Town consist∣ed in that the Enemy for haste brought no Cannon, or other Engines for Battery. There∣fore all their Assaults proved unsuccessful, for our Men bravely made good the Walls. The sharpest Dispute was at the River which runs near the Town, in which there being no Foun∣tains nor Cisterns, the Besieged were obliged to go out for Water: The Moors laboured to turn the River another way, which (tho' with much loss) they performed, cutting a new Channel. D. Alonso de Aguilar marched from Cordova with 1000 Horse and 3000 Foot to the Relief of the Besieged; but all Passes being secured by the Enemy, was forced to return without effect∣ing any thing. All the Hopes that remained was in the Duke of Medina Sidonia, and that not much, because of his ancient Enmity with the Marquess of Cadiz; to which was added, that he resented that Expedition had been undertaken without consulting him. The Love of his Country prevailed with his Generous Spirit above private Animosities, and the Publick Danger reconciled those Opposites. Having resolved to relieve the Besieged, he took the Royal Standard out of Sevil, and joined with other Noblemen, particularly D. Roderick Giron, Master of Calatrava, and D. James Pacheco, Marquess of Villena. They gathered about 5000 Horse and 40000 Foot. King Ferdinand the very Day he received the News of the taking of Al∣hama, and the Danger our Men were in, set forward with speed from Medina del Campo, leaving Orders for the Queen to follow him. He sent Orders to the Noblemen not to enter the Moorish Territories before he came, because it was requisite to carry a greater force. The great want of Water the Besieged endured made all delay dangerous; therefore the Lords notwithstanding that Order marched. The Moors expected not their coming, but raised the Siege, and departed. Then the Besieged marched out to meet those that came to their Re∣lief, and joyfully embraced one another. The Marquess of Cadiz embraced the Duke of Medina Sidonia; they saluted one another courteously, and so ended the Hatred which had been betwixt those two Families for many Years. This Joy was very near being converted into Sorrow, by a Dispute arising among the Soldiers. Those that came to relieve the Be∣sieged, pretended to have share in the Plunder of the Town, and from Words they had come to Blows, but that the Duke pacified his Men with fair Speeches, and promises of leading them to greater Plunder. A fresh Garrison was put into the Town, and the Army marched back. Immediately the Moors returned to the Siege, and several Parties went out to plunder the neighbouring Country. The Infidels observing the highest part of Alhama being difficult of access, was slenderly guarded, scaled it before break of day on the 20th of April. Our Men taking the Alarm, charged the Enemy with such Fury, that several of them were killed, and the rest to save themselves leaped over the Walls. Two Citizens of Sevil signalized them∣selves in this Action, the one called Peter Pineda, the other Alonso Ponce.\n\ngreat account, it was resolved to besiege Loxa, a very strong City not far from Alhama. Ezija was the Place appointed for the Army to Rendezvous; about 5000 Horse and 8000 Foot gathered there: A small Number for so great an Undertaking. After the Moors were gone, the King marched with part of these Forces to Alhama, on the 29th of April. He put a new Garrison into the Place, and left D. Luis Portocarrero, Lord of Palma, a great Soldier, to Command there. Then having wasted the Plain of Granada without sustaining any loss, he returned to Cordova to make the necessary Preparations for War. Besides, the Queen was near her time, and he was willing to be present at her lying in. On the 29th of July she was delivered of two Children; the one that lived was called Mary, the other was dead. Hence the People took occasion to frame Omens of the Success of the War according to every Man's Fancy. But what most troubled them was to see those who carried the Standards to Church to be Blessed look extraordinarily melancholy. Others laughed at all these Observations as at vain and accidental things. The day following the King went away to Ezija, all Persons of any Note striving to have part in that Undertaking. According as had been resolved they marched to Loxa, where they encamped and entrenched themselves near the Suburbs among Olive Gardens, on that side where the River Xenil is so straightned by high Banks, that it is not sordable. The Ground was streight, and not proper for the Horse, and the Citizens be∣ing Masters of the Bridge, it was hard to pass the River. Near this place is a Hill called Al∣bohacen, which being commodious to hinder the Enemy from sallying, and to command the City, the Master of Calatrava, and Marquesses of Villena and Cadiz, were ordered to possess themselves of it. Within the City were about 3000 Horse, Commanded by Alatar a Brave Captain. They made several Sallies, particularly upon a Saturday, being encouraged by some Recruits they had received, and the Hopes that the King of Granada was marching to relieve them, they attacked our Post upon the Hill, sallying in two Bodies. Our Guards being sur∣prized, fled. Those that encamped next them, came to their Relief, but without any Order, or leaving a Guard in the Camp. The other Body of Moors laying hold of this Opportunity, easily made themselves Masters of our Works, which greatly discouraged those that were en∣gaged. However, they ran to defend their Camp, and behaved themselves with great Bra∣very. The Enemy pressed them in Front and Rear, which was the cause our Men were de∣feated. The Master of Calatrava was killed, with many others; the rest saved themselves by flight. King Ferdinand discouraged by this Misfortune, and perceiving that what his Brother the Duke de Villahermosa had said was true, to wit, That the Army was encamped in a dis∣adventageous Post; as also understanding the Enemy's Army marched towards him, the next day marched away as far as the Lovers Rock, called Pen̄a de los Enamorados, which was seven Leagues distant from Loxa. He retired in good Order, the Marquess of Cadiz facing the Enemy, who continually charged the Rear, but were so bravely received they fled to the City. This was the end of that ill laid Design. The Moors encouraged by this Success, re∣turned to the Siege of Alhama. King Ferdinand, on the 14th of August, in Person relieved the Besieged, laid in Provision for 9 Months, and gave the Lieutenancy of that Place to D. Luis Osorio, who tho' Elect Bishop of Jaen, was a brave and experienced Soldier. Be∣sides, the King plundered and burnt all the Plain of Granada. 600 Moors came out of the City to skirmish, but the Earl of Cabra, and Chief Commendary of Calatrava, killed many of them, and forced the rest back into the Town. These were great Losses to the Moors; but the greatest Mischief was Discord among themselves; for a great number of the Citizens of Granada taking Arms, drove their King Albohaçen out of the City: They accused him of Tyranny, and of beginning that bloody War. In his Place they set up his own Son Mahomet Boabdil, commonly called the Little King; others call him Haley Muley Alcadurbil. Malaga, Baça, and some other Cities, continued Loyal to King Albohaçen. Thus that Nation was di∣vided betwixt Two Factions, which did them no less harm than the Enemies abroad. It is remarkable, that amidst these Confusions neither Party asked Aid of the Christians; but in the heat of the Civil War, made Incursions into their Territories, and took the Town of Can̄ete on the Frontiers of that Kingdom.\n\nOther Affairs for some time diverted the King and Queen from the War with the Moores, and they returned to the Kingdom of Toledo. The Command of the Frontiers about Ezija was given to D. Peter Manrique, Earl of Trevin̄o, and lately created Duke of Najara. D. A∣lonso de Cardenas, Master of Santiago was to Command about Jaen. The Government of Sevil was given to D. John de Silva Earl of Cifuentes. All things thus settled, the King and Queen came to Madrid about the beginning of Winter. There the Cortes assembled to regu∣late the Association set on Foot some Years before as has been said, that they might not abuse the Power they had. Supplies were also demanded for the Expences of the War, and they offered to furnish 16000 Beasts for Carriage. Pope Sixtus commanded the Clergy to contribute 100000 Ducats for once. He also granted the Croisade to such as served at their own Cost, or at least contributed a certain small Sum of Money. This was again granted 3 Years after, and has continued ever since, being Yearly Collected, which brings a great Sum of Money into the Kings Coffers. Besides all this, much Money was borrowed of Bankers and other private Persons. The Aragonians would not receive D. Raimund Folch Earl of Cardona for their Viceroy, and pleaded it was a breach of their Priviledges to put a Stranger over them. After some debate the King condescended, and constituted his Son\n\nAlonso de Aragon, Archbishop of Zaragoça Viceroy. The designs of the Portugueses and Na∣varrois did not a little perplex King Ferdinand. The King of Portugal proposed to Marry his Neece the Princess Joanna Daughter to King Henry, to Francis Phebus King of Navarre, who was not yet dead. Navarre favoured France. To prevent danger Ambassadors were sent to both. Those who went to Navarre, which was after the death of that King, had orders to propose a Match betwixt Queen Catherine who had Inherited that Crown, and Prince John King Ferdinand's Son. They had also instructions to endeavour to gain all the Men in Power, particularly the Faction of the Biamonteses, that was possessed of Pamplona, and most of the Kingdom, the Queen having little left her but the Name, tho' she had ap∣pointed a Viceroy, who was Monsieur de Abene, a Frenchman, well versed in Affairs of that nature. Magdalen the Queen's Mother seemed pleased at the Match, and said there could be nothing on her side to obstruct so advantageous a proposal. In Galicia the Con∣stable and Earl of Benavente with their followers were in Arms. Each of them strove to seize the Castles of the Bishops, to be in a better Condition to oppose his Adversary. King Ferdinand to prevent mischief, Ordered Ferdinand de Acun̄a Governor of that Country to seize those Places. The Governor besieging the Castle of Lugo, D. Peter Ossorio Earl of Lemos came with Forces to the Assistance of his Brother who was Bishop of that City. This produced a new War, which obliged King Ferdinand to set out from Madrid on the 11th of February 1413, and hasten into Galicia. By the way he received advice that the Earl of Lemos was dead. He appointed his Grandson Roderick, his Heir, tho' a Bastard of his Son Alonso. The Grandfather obtained a dispensation of the Pope to make him Legitimate, and put him into possession of his Estate before his death. This produced a new debate, for Joanna Daughter to the Earl deceased, and Wife to D. Luis the Earl of Benavente's Son, claimed that Earldom. Upon this account both Parties were in Arms. King Ferdinand Com∣manded them to stand to the determination of the Law, threatning to fall upon him that should refuse, yet he favoured the Grandson of the deceased, who was in possession. Whilst he was busie in Galicia, the Moores near Malaga made a great slaughter of our Men, which was the greatest loss we sustained during that War. Peter Enriquez Lieutenant of Andaluzia having with the Assistance of the Earl of Cadiz recovered his Town of Can̄ete and Fortified it, was desirous to be revenged upon the Moores. D. Alonso de Aguilar and the Master of Santiago had also resolved to make an Incursion into the Moorish Territories. The Earl of Cifuentes had attempted to recover Zahara, but failed. All these Commanders agreed to make an Inroad into the Territory of Malaga in three Bodies. That Country is rich by reason of the Silken manufactures, and therefore they hoped to make a considerable Booty. Near Malaga there are certain uncouth Mountains called Axarquia, over those Mountains they Marched, plunder∣ed and burnt all the Country, and some Parties of Horse advanced even in sight of Malaga. This provoked the Citizens, and the People of the Mountains assembled and secured all the Passes. Our Men sought to retire, but could not. There were two Ways, the longest by the Sea, which was plainest, but dangerous, because of the Castle of Malaga, and several Creeks that cross it. The other through which they came was shorter, but very difficult by reason of the Woods and Mountains. Two Mountains particularly close up a deep Vally, through the middle of which runs a River that parts them. Our Men entred this Valley in a Con∣sternation, encumbred with the Booty, when on the one side the Moores attacked them, and on the other they saw the Pass secured by another Party, which added much to their Fear. They were Tyred with Marching two days, Faint for want of Food, and could neither go backwards nor forwards. Many were killed with Arrows and Musket Shot, the Moores being very good Marksmen. Night coming on, the Terror increased with the darkness and the continual shouts of the Enemy. Then the Master of Santiago cryed out, How long shall we suffer our selves Fellow-Soldiers to be Slaughtered like sheep? Our Swords and our Valour must open the Way, or at least let us endeavour to Sell our Lives dear, and not die unrevenged. Having spoke thus, they began to ascend the Hill, and with much difficulty reached to the Top. There the Fight was bloody, and the Slaughter on our side great, ma∣ny Persons of Note were killed. The Marquess of Cadiz found Guides, who led him off through by-ways. The Earl of Cifuentes his Squadron which brought up the Rear sustained most loss, he and his Brother Peter de Silva were taken and carried to Granada. Of 2700 Horse, 800 were killed, and among them 3 Brothers of the Marquess of Cadiz, James, Lope and Bertran, besides others of his Relations. Near twice as many were taken, and of them 400 of the best Gentry in Spain. Some few with the Master of Santiago escaped over the desert part of the Mountain, and got to Antequera. Others as chance led them, made their way to other Places. This Misfortune hapned upon the 21th of March, being the Feast of St. Benedict, usually a day of Joy in Spain, but now converted into Sorrow. Abohardil Brother to King Albohacen, and Governor of Malaga, who Commanded the Moores, gained great Reputation by this extraordinary Success.\n\nCHAP. III. The Moores defeated, and Boabdil their King taken, and afterwards released; The Af∣faires of Navarre; Pope Sixtus dies, Innocent the Eighth succeeds him; Marquess del Gasto, and Pescara, from whom Descended.\n\nTHE Sorrow conceived by The Christians for their loss, was soon allayed, by a greater Defeat they gave the Moores. Albohazen and Boabdil the Two Moorish Kings did one another all the harm they could, yet at the same time both endeavoured to gain the Affecti∣on of their People, destroying the Christians. To this purpose Boabdil having gathered a good Body entred the Territory of Ecija, designing to surprize Lucena a Town more large and rich, than strong. Alatar his Father in Law, who from a mean Condition, rose by his Valour to that Honour, gave this Advice. James Fernandez de Cordova who was Lord of that Town, and some others thereabouts, understanding the design of the Moores, gave advice of the danger he was in to his Unckle, the Earl of Cabra. But few Horse remained in those parts, by reason of the late slaughter, and the Inhabitants of Lucena were in a Consternation because their Walls were not Strong to make resistance. The Moores came before the Town on the 21th of April. The Governour coveyed the Townsmen into the upper Town, and gave the guard of the lower, to 200 Horse and 800 Foot he had got together. They de∣fended it so bravely that the Enemy dispairing of Success, and in a rage for some Men they lost in the Attack, vented their Fury upon the Olive Gardens. Besides, Hamet Abencerrage wasted the Lands of Mon̄tilla with 300 Horse. He was samiliarly acquainted with James de Cordova, the Family of the Abencerrages having resided at Cordova, when they were Banished out of Granada. Upon account of this acquaintance, he had an interview with James de Cor∣dova designing to circumvent him. His fraud was disappointed by another policy. The Governor seemed inclinable to surrender the Town, and by that means gained time till the Count de Cabra could come to his Relief. Upon the news of his approach, the Enemy raised the Siege, and began to March off with the Booty which was very great. The besieged Sallyed and Charged their Rear to keep them in Play till the Earl of Cabra came up. It will scarce be believed, that tho' the Moores were Ten times the number of the Christians, they did not stand the first shock. A League and a half from Lucena, and in the Way to Loxa, is a pleasant Brook, which then with the Summer Rains was swelled. The Enemies Foot having passed this. Brook, began to fly, only taking care to drive the Booty. Their Horse tho' in a Consternation made a stand, the King himself, striving to encourage them. All proved ineffectual, for the Christians advancing, they were Charged in Flank by D. Alonso de Aguilar, who came from Antequera with 40 Horse, and some few Foot. The Enemy suddenly gave way and fled. The King alighted off from a white Horse, and endeavoured to hide himself among the Trees and Bushes on the Banks of the River. Three Foot Soldi∣ers found him, and he discovered himself for fear of being killed. He was secured and sent to Lucena. In the pursuit which lasted till Night, above 1000 Horse were killed, and among them Alatar being 90 Years of Age, about 4000 Foot were either slain or taken. All the Booty was recovered. Having received the news of this Victory, Queen Elizabeth went a∣way to the Borders of Navarre, to hasten the Marriage betwixt her Son and that Queen. And King Ferdinand hasted to Andaluzia to prosecute the War. Being come to Cordova, it was resolved to raise greater Forces, because after the taking of Boabdil, the Moores were again united under Albohacen, and he had recovered Granada, notwithstanding many of the Citi∣zens hated him for his Cruelty and Avarice. King Ferdinand at the head of 6000 Horse, and 40000 Foot destroyed the Suburbs of Yiora, and having taken Tajara by Assault, utterly de∣stroyed it. Thence he Marched, and Encamping on the plain of Granada, sent out Parties, who burnt and destroyed all about them. King Albohacen having no confidence in the Citi∣zens, durst not venture out of the City, and onely some small Parties came out to endeavour to pick up Staglers. That King sent to offer the Earl of Cifuentes and Nine more of the principal Prisoners he had taken for his Son Boabdil. He also proposed Conditions of Peace but such as were haughty and violent. King Ferdinand answered, he was not come to receive, but to give Laws, and would not hear of any Peace till they laid down their Arms. The Marquess of Cadiz and others, ceased not to perswade the King to release Boab∣dil, because it was a mean to keep the Enemy divided, which would redound to our ad∣vantage. King Ferdinand having wasted the Country and lest a good Garrison in Albama under the Command of Ynigo Lopez de Mendoca Earl of Tendilla, returned to Cordova. Thi∣ther the Moorish King was brought Prisoner from the Castle of Porcuna. Being come before the King he offered to kiss his Hand, but King Ferdinand Embraced and Entertained him courteously. After some time they concluded a League upon these Conditions. That Bo∣abdil should give his Eldest Son and 12 other Sons of the principal Moores as Hostages, that he would always continue faithful to King Ferdinand. That he should pay the yearly Tribute of 12000 Ducats and come to the Cortes when Summoned. That in Five years time he should Release 400 Christian Slaves. Upon these terms he was dismissed. King Ferdinand having Garrisoned all Towns thereabouts, and given the Government of Ezija, and general\n\nCommand of those Frontiers to D. Luis Fernandez Portocarrero, set out towards the Queen. At the same time 1500 Moorish Horse and 4000 Foot under the Command of Bexir Gover∣nor of Malaga broke into the Territory of Utrera, but were overthrown by Portocarrero and the Marquess of Cadiz near Guadalete. In memory of this good Service, it was granted to the Marquesses of Cadiz for ever, that they should have the Suit of Cloaths the King of Spain wore upon every Feast of the Nativity of our Blessed Lady, which is in September. Within the same Month the Marquess recovered Zahara by surprize. King Ferdinand and Queen Elizabeth went to Vitoria, tho' with small hopes that the Marriage designed would take effect. The Lady Magdalen pleaded the Queen her Daughter was Marriageable, and the Prince but a Child. At Vitoria the Earl of Cabra and James Fernandez de Cordova were received with extraordinary Honour, the Cardinal of Toledo with all the Nobility by the King's Order, going out of Town to meet them. A Pension of 100000 Maravedies was given to the Earl of Cabra for his Life, and to his paternal Coat of Arms was added a Kings Head Crowned, within an Orle of 7 Colours, betokening that number taken from the Enemy in their Retreat from Lucena. The Winter Floods carryed away a great part of the Wall of Alhama, and the Garrison was for abandoning the Place, but the Earl of Tendilla caused a Cloth painted in such man∣ner that the defect could not be perceived, to be spread along that part. By this project they gained time to repair the Damage before the Enemy understood the Cheat. For want of Money to pay the Garrison, he gave them Pastboard Tickets with his name on the one Side, and the value they were to go for on the other, promising to make them good as soon as the danger was over. On the 15th of November, the Pope gave a Cardinal's Cap to D. John de Melguerite Bishop of Girona. He wrote a brief History of the Kings of Spain, called Paralipomena, but enjoyed that Dignity only a few Months. His Body lies at Rome in the Church of our Lady de Populo.\n\nThe troubles in Navarre did not cease, and the old Factions grew strong through the ge∣neral Contempt of the Government. To add to all former Misfortunes, a new War broke out. John Viscount Narbonne Unckle to Queen Catherine, pretended to have Right to that Kingdom before his Nephews, and alledged that a Woman could not Inherit the Crown. The truth is, he had no Right, and therefore by force of Arms brought all the Earldom of Faux into Subjection. To put an end to these troubles, it was thought convenient to hasten the Queen's Marriage. The Lady Magdalen her Mother was for Marrying of her in France. The People pleaded she ought not to Marry without advice of the Cortes, and thereupon the Inhabitants of Tudela protested, if she were disposed of otherwise, they would deliver up the Town to King Ferdinand. He at the beginning of the Year 1484 held the Cortes of Aragon at Taraçona, where nothing remarkable was done, only at first the Catalonians plead∣ed they ought not to be summoned out of their own Province, yet at last they submitted. Mean while, Catherine Queen of Navarre was married to John d' Albret, Lord of Perigeux, Limoges, Dreux and many other Places. This Match produced new troubles in Navarre, King Ferdinand designing to make his advantage of those Confusions, stayed there himself, and sent his Queen to provide for the War in Andaluzia. Alboha••en kept up his Authority, and his Son Boahdil had much ado to maintain the Title of King in the City Almeria, that People hating him as a Friend to the Christians, their Preachers employed by his Father never oeasing to rail at him. About 10000 Men from Sevil and Cordova in April wasted all the Lands of Malaga. No relief came to the Moores out of Africk, either because that People was ingaged in other Wars, or because our Fleet Commanding the Sea, gave them no op∣portunity to stir. All our Force being on that side, the Genoeses under the Command of Jordieto Doria ravaged all the coasts of Catalonia, and Valencia. A Fleet was therefore rigged upon that Coast, to Curb the Insolency of those Pyrates. Some troubles in Ecclesiastical Af∣fairs required the presence of King Ferdinand to settle them. Luis Despuch Master of Montesa dying, the Knights chose D. Philip Boyl in his Place, but King Ferdinand pleading that by vir∣tue of a Bull granted him by the Pope, no Master of a Military Order could be Elected without his Consent, the new Elect was Deposed; and Charles late Duke of Viana chosen in his stead. Also Pope Sixtus gave the Archbishoprick of Sevil to Cardinal Roderick Borgia, but the King opposed him, and it was given to James de Mendoça then Bishop of Palencia. Thus the Kings of Spain began to claim the Right of nominating their Bishops. The Nea∣politans and Venetians were now at War about Hercules Duke of Ferrara, whom the former Protected because he was Married to their King's Daughter. On the 12th of August died Pope Sixtus. His Successor was Cardinal John Baptista Cibo, who took the Name of Inno∣cent the 8th. At the same time died In̄igo Davalos, Son to the Constable Ruy Lopez Dava∣los. He was in high favour with the Kings of Naples, and left several Children of whom some Princes in Italy are descended, and particularly the famous Ferdinand, Marquess of Pescara, who filled not only Italy, but all the World with the same of his Exploits. Inigo Davalo was Father to D. Alonso, Marquess del Gasto, who was also renowned for his Valour, and his Cousin dying without Children, he Inherited his Estate, which he left to his Heirs, upon Condition one of them should be called Marquess de Pescara, and the next Marquess del Gasto alternatively, as is practised till this day.\n\nCHAP. IV. Alora and other Places taken from the Moores; Albohardil usurps the Crown of Gra∣nada, and defeats the Earl of Cabra; The Rebellion in Naples; Birth of the Princess Catherine of Castile, afterwards Wife to Henry VIII. King of England.\n\nIN Andaluzia our Forces never ceas'd to harass the Enemies Country. At Cordoua a Coun∣cil was held to agree about undertaking some Enterprize, and tho the Master of Santiago was of another Opinion, the Marquess of Cadiz his Advice prevailed, which was to attack Alora, a Town almost in the mid-way between Antequera and Malaga. It is stronger by Nature than any addition of Art. The Army was ready to march when King Ferdinand came and approved of the Enterprize. The better to amuze the Enemy, he gave out he was going to put new Forces into Alhama, but being come to Antequera turned short, and set down before Alora unexpected. Our Cannon soon beat down part of the Walls, which so terrified the Moores, that they surrendred on the 21th of June, upon Condition to carry their Goods with them. We lost not one Man in this Siege. Several other Places were at∣tacked, and at one called Caçarabonela, where there was a Skirmish with a Body of the Enemy, D. Gutierre de Sotomayor, Earl of Benalcaçar, being too eager, was killed in the prime of his Age. After this 300 Knights of Calatrava were put into Alhama, under the Command of Garzi Lopez de Padilla, chosen Master of that Order, in the place of Roderick Tellez Giron, de∣ceased. The King marched on, and incamped in sight of Granada. His Army consisted of 6000 Horse, and scarce 10000 Foot. In the City there were reported to be 70000 Comba∣tants, a number scarce to be believed. However King Ferdinand ravaged all that place, and having spent 50 days in this Expedition, returned with his Army entire, and loaded with Plunder to the Christian Territories. The Command of Alora he gave to Luis Fernandez Por∣tocarrero. D. Alvaro de Mendoça, Earl of Castro, was made Admiral, that he being a Man of singular Conduct, might hinder any Succours from passing out of Africk. After the heat of the Summer was over the Christians again took the Field. They battered a Castle near Ma∣laga called Septenil, which the Besieged, terrified with the Cannon, surrendred, being payed for the Provisions they left behind them. Thence our Army marched towards Ronda, a strong and almost inaccessible City, being seated betwixt craggy Mountains, the greatest part of it encompassed by a River, the rest covered with Rocks. The Inhabitants of this place were Resolute and Warlike, and well provided with all Necessaries for their Defence. Our Forces being come in sight of the Walls, destroyed all the Orchards and Olive-Trees there∣abouts, but Money growing short to pay the Soldiers, they made but a short stay there. The Army being put into Winter-quarters, the King and Queen went away to Sevil, and came to that City upon the 2d of October. In the month of January, 1485, the King took the Field, thinking to surprize the City Loxa, but desisted by reason of the Rains and bad Wea∣ther, as also because a Soldier of Note, called John de Ortega, said, that design was impracti∣cable. The Nobility came in daily with their Troops, so that in a little time the Army amount∣ed to 9000 Horse, and 20000 Foot. With this Force it was decreed to prosecute the War. At the same time the Citizens of Almeria, as if their King Boabdil were the Cause of all their Misfortunes, assaulted his Palace, killed his Brother, and secured his Mother, who had been the chief Incendiary betwixt the Father and Son. King Boabdil himself being then out of the Town, as soon as he received the News of that Misfortune, fled with a few Followers to Cor∣doua. The Inhabitants of Ronda, whose numbers were much decreased, were in a great Con∣sternation. A Moore called Joseph Xerife, gave notice of it to the Marquess of Cadiz, and it was decreed to undertake that Enterprize. First they attacked a Town called Cohine near Alora, which they took by Assault, and razed because it was too large to be defended. Ano∣ther Town called Cartama, of which all the Valley takes Name, was also taken. The Master of Santiago was made Governor of it at his own Request. This done they marched to Ma∣laga, where Albohardil, the Moorish King's Brother, resided, in whose Valour the Moores chiefly confided, for the Reputation he gained in the Slaughter of the Christians on the Moun∣tains of Malaga. Little was done there, and the Army returned the way it came to Ronda. The Forces were divided into 5 parts, that they might encompass the Town on all sides. The King with the greatest Body encamped before the Castle. All the Avenues were secured that no Succours might get into the Town, which was then much weakned, a great number of the Inhabitants being abroad upon Parties to plunder in Andalusia. For these Reasons, and because the Christians advanced their Works with great Industry, the Besieged surrendred upon Articles the 23d of May. Among the other Conditions it was agreed, that some of the Principal Inhabitants should have Revenues assigned them at Sevil, out of the Estates of Gonçalo Picon, and others condemned by the Inquisition. A good Garrison was put into that City. Several other Towns along the Mountain surrendred, the chief whereof were Caçarabonela, and Marbella, which lies near the Sea. The Moores were in a great Consternation, and had little help in their Kings, the one being fled, the other ancient, sickly, and almost blind. This moved them to choose for their King Muley Albohardil, who resided at Malaga, and was a Man of great Courage and Conduct. He immediately accepted of the Crown they offered\n\nhim, went away to Granada; and entred that City in Triumphant manner, being proud that he had killed 90 Christians by the way, who lay very secure upon Sierra Nevada. The Ci∣tizens with great Acclamations proclaimed him King. Albohazen at the beginning of this Mutiny went away to Almun̄ecar, where his Treasure lay. There his cruel Brother caused him to be Murdered, only to secure himself in the Throne he had usurped.\n\nKing Ferdinand, tho many were of Opinion the Soldiers who were harassed with the late Expeditions ought to rest, commanded the Army to Rendezvous at Alcala Real, because that Town was upon the Frontiers, and went himself thither from Cordcua upon the first of Sep∣tember, notwithstanding the Heat was excessive, that part of the Country being naturally hotter than the rest of Spain. The Earl of Cabra desiring to signalize himself, begged he might first enter the Moorish Territories, as he did with 700 Horse and 3000 Foot. He was ordered to take with him Martin Alonso de Montemayor, and to sit down before Moclin, a strong Town near Granada, the King promising to back them with the whole Army. The Earl marched day and night to surprize the new King Albohardil, who he understood was quartered near that place with 1500 Horse, and a greater number of Foot. This Design being dis∣covered to the Moore, he removed to a Hill, and at break of day fell upon the Christians in certain Defiles with such fury, that the best Soldiers were killed, and most of the Foot. The Earl lost his Brother Gonçalo, and he with a few Horse fled towards the way where he ex∣pected to meet Garzi Lopez de Padilla, Master of Calatrava, who followed those that had ad∣vanced before. This Loss so troubled King Ferdinand, that he retired for some time. On the Frontier near Jaen, are two Towns and Castles called Cambil, and Albahar. The River Frio runs betwixt them, and tho small, is difficult to be waded, because of its high Banks. Both these Places were besieged, Albahar is beyond the River, and near it is a Hill that commands it, on which the King, tho with much labour, caused the Cannon to be planted. This so terrified the Moores, that they surrendred both Towns and Castles on the 23d of September, being the very day on which they were lost 120 years before. After this the King put the Army into Winter Quarters, and went himself with the Queen to Alcala de Henares. Dur∣ing this Expedition died D. Alonso de Aragon, Duke de Villahermosa, the King's Brother, a brave Commander. His Body was deposited at Baeça, and thence translated to Poplete, the burial-place of his Ancestors. Of him are descended the Dukes of Villahermosa, and Earls of Ribagorça. In Toledo the Inquisition severely punished those who renouncing the Christian Faith became Jews. A great number of those People who were reconciled, and implored Mercy, was pardoned. They are now called De la Gracia, that is, the People of Grace. The Nobility of Naples had now raised a Bloody War against their King Ferdinand, upon the usual Pretences. Pope Innocent favoured them, but it was rather in Words than Effect, for he was ancient, and otherwise employed. The chief of the Conspirators were the Princes of Sa∣lerno, Basigniano, and Altamura, as also the Marquess del Gasto. It was reported that Frederick, the King's Son, under-hand supported the Rebels, but this could never be proved. The Wicked Life of Alonso, Duke of Calabria, the King's Eldest Son, was one great Motive of this Revolt. The King resolved to reduce the Rebels rather by Policy than Force, and there∣fore gave his General Pardon to all the Mutiniers. King Ferdinand of Spain also sent the Earl of Tendilla his Ambassador, to ingage to those Noblemen for their safety, provided they laid down their Arms. But the King of Naples, as soon as the Storm was over, made no account of those Promises, and at several times, as occasion served, seized the Heads of the Rebellion, and put them all to death. King Ferdinand of Castile ceased not to protest against those Proceed∣ings, but he of Naples ceased not to proceed in cutting off his Enemies, which proved fatal to him at last, as we shall see in its place. Let us turn back. On the 16th of December Queen Elizabeth at Aloala de Henares, was delivered of a Daughter, called Catherine, well known in the World as Wife to two Brothers, Sons to the King of England, and for her great Sufferings caused by the inordinate Lust and infidelity of her Husband, which also drew great Calamities upon the whole English Nation. Their Sins and Rebellion drew Judgments upon them. Richard III. having murdered his Two Nephews, Edward and Richard, the rightful Heirs of the Crown, usurped the Kingdom. He Govern'd like a Tyrant, and ended accordingly. Henry Earl of Richmond, who had been a Prisoner in Britany, having obtained his Liberty, overthrew the Tyrant in Battle, and killed him. By that means he secured the Crown to himself. This Henry had a Son called Henry like himself, who was the Eighth of that Name King of England, and famous for his Incontinency, for putting away Catherine his Wife, and for disowning the Supremacy of the Pope, besides many other Crimes which have left an in∣delible stain upon his Name.\n\nCHAP. V. The Tumults in Aragon, and Catalonia; Several Towns taken from the Moores; A Sedition in Galicia; King Albohardil attacks the Castle call'd Albaizin in Granada, and is repulsed; Azamor on the Coast of Africk delivered to the Portugueses.\n\nSOme small Tumults hapned in Aragon, but those in Catalonia were more dangerous, yet the Prudence of King Ferdinand overcame them all. The City Zaragoça is seated in a Plain on the Banks of the River Ebro, and is in Beauty, Riches, and number of Inhabitants, almost equal to the best in Spain. This Place has often Mutinied in defence of its Priviledges, as it hapned at this time. John de Burgos, the King's Alguazil, gave some ill Language to Peter Cerdan, the Chief of the Aldermen, and Head of their Counsel. Others coming in apprehended the Alguazil, Tried, Condemned, and Hanged him, which was a great Affront to the King. He was then upon the point of entring upon the Kingdom of Granada with his Army, and therefore sent Orders to John Hernandez de Heredia, supream Governor of that Kingdom, to punish all that had a Hand in that Affair with the utmost rigor, and at the same time told the Deputies sent by the City, that no harm should be done; for he was ex∣pert in Dissembling. The Head of the Aldermen could not be apprehended, because the Chief Justice of Aragon protected him, but Martin Pertusa, who was the next, and had been very active in the Business of the Alguazil, was suddenly Executed, the King's Letters being carried before him upon a Spear to awe the People, who were ready to Rescue him. This struck a Terror into the others, and so the Sedition was appeased. Soon after another Tu∣mult hapned upon account of a more Hainous Crime than the last. Peter Arbuc was Inquisi∣tor in that City, and punished Offenders according to their Crimes. Certain wicked Mur∣derers, under colour of standing up for their Liberties, attempted to Murder him in his Bed, but not being able to force the Iron Bars of his Window, they Stabbed him in the Church before the High Altar, as he was at Mattins, on the 14th of September. He died not till the night following, which time he spent in Singing Praises to Almighty God. His Body was buried in the same place where they Murdered him, and soon after a Lamp was hung over his Grave, an Honour never allowed to any but Canonized Saints Charles V. the Emperor, obtained of Pope Paul III. that his Feast might be Celebrated on the 15th of September, as is duely now observed. All his Murderers died unfortunately within a year. After this, for the safety of the Inquisitors, they were lodged in the Castle called Del Aljaferia. This in Aragon. In Catalonia, and particularly the Territory of Ampurias, those Vassals who are vulgarly called Pageses, were oppressed by their Landlords, and Treated like Slaves. Those Lords obliged them to pay the heavy Impositions laid on them by the Moores, pleading Prescription to justifie this Proceeding. The Histories of Catalonia do not mention what Impositions these were, they only say they were very heavy, and that none was exempt from them but such as Ran∣somed themselves like Slaves. This moved the People often to take up Arms to deliver them∣selves from that Tyranny, but the Efforts of the Multitude for the most part are weak. They had recourse to their Kings for Redress, and several of them ordered those Impositions to be moderated, yet the Nobility would not part with any thing of what had been left them by their Ancestors. King Ferdinand at last, with his usual. Success, and good Conduct, put an end to all those Debates. From Alcala de Henarez the King and Queen went to Segovia, and thence to Medina del Campo. By the way they visited D. Garzia de Toledo, created by the King Duke of Alva, who now lived retired by reason of his great Age, having left his Son Frede∣rick to serve in his place. This the King did not only to Honour him, but to Reconcile him to the Constable Peter Fernandez de Velasco, to whom with D. Alonso de Fonseca, Archbishop of Sevil, he intended to leave the Government of Castile, whilst he prosecuted the War in Granada. In order to it he went to Guadalupe, where on the 28th of April he decided the Affair of the Pageses, ordaining, that in lieu of the old Imposition every one of those Vassals should pay to his Lord 70 Sueldos, or Shillings of Barcelona yearly, which tho a heavy Burden, was joyfully accepted by those People, and the more for that they were allowed to buy it off at 20 years purchase. Thus after long Disputes that part of Spain was pacified. In Portugal all was quiet since the death of those Nobles we have spoken of, and the King laboured to make his Kingdom renowned. Azamor, a City in Mauritania Tingitana on the Ocean, ha∣ving formerly been Tributary to the King of Portugal, now took an Oath of Fidelity to him, and in acknowledgment of subjection obliged it self to give yearly 10000 Alosas, which is a sort of Fish that abounds there. It was a greater Honour to that Nation and its Princes, that they had not only formerly maintained their Liberty, and Erected a Kingdom to which they had no good Title, but did now subdue remote Cities and Provinces to their great glory and advantage.\n\nThe Kingdom of the Moores decayed apace: Civil Discord consumed them no less than the Enemy abroad. In the City of Granada, Boabdil being called in by his Party, possessed him∣self of a Castle called Albaycin, and the Citizens sought and killed one another in the Streets. Yet they joined to oppose the Christians, and the danger being over to War among them∣selves again. An Alsaqui, which is in the Nature of a Priest, esteemed a Holy Man, went\n\nabout the Streets proclaiming their Madness, and threatning speedy ruin unless they grew wiser in time. His Words moved the People, and therefore through his Mediation, and of others of his Profession, the Two Kings came to an Agreement upon these Terms. That the Uncle should still keep Granada, Almeria, and Malaga; all the rest should belong to his Nephew Boabdil, who, I guess, resided in the Albaycin before-mentioned, tho our Historians do not mention it. Their chief design was, that Boabdil should have all those Places which they imagined the Christians would first attack, because he was in League with King Ferdinand. The Christians were not ignorant of their Policy, therefore having assembled their Forces they resolved to attempt Loxa. Boabdil advanced with 500 Horse to stop the passage of our Men, who were to march through uncouth and difficult ways. Nevertheless they came to the Suburbs of the City, where they had a Skirmish with the Moores whom they forced back into the Walls. The Army was divided into 3 parts, the better to compass the Town, and the Bridge that led to it broken down. But the Christians built two others, to secure the Commu∣nication for themselves. A breach being made by the Cannon, and all things in readiness to assault it, the City surrendred the 9th day of the Siege, capitulating for liberty to depart with as much of their Goods as they could carry. Boabdil coming to the Camp, fell down on his Knees, protesting it was against his Will he had broke his Faith, and that he was forced to it. His Excuses were allowed, and he pardoned, because it was convenient to wink at his Faults, to keep up the Division that was among the Moores. King Ferdinand fortified the City, and gave the Command of it to Alvaro de Luna, Lord of Fuentiduen̄a, and Grandson to the Constable D. Alvaro de Luna. This done he marched to reduce other Places. Some few made resistance, but in vain, the most surrendred. Among others Illora was taken on the 28th of June, and after it Ban̄os, Zagra, and Moclin. Some of these Places were very strong, and might have held out long, being near Granada, whence they could be relieved. The Com∣mand of Illora was given to Gonçalo Fernandez de Cordova, afterwards the famous General in Italy. The Citizens of Granada used to call Illora the Right Eye, and Moclin the Buckler of that City, for which reason they began to despair of maintaining themselves, besides that the Christians destroyed all the Country about them. Nevertheless Albohardil sent part of his Horse to the Bridge called De los Pinos, a Place well known for the Slaughter of our Men made there formerly. These were to hinder the Christians passing the River Xenil. He him∣self stayed in the City to prevent Disorders. The Moores could not hinder the Christians pas∣sing the River, but charged the Left Squadron that passed, which was commanded by D. In̄igo de Mendoça Duke del Infant ado. Our Men were hard put to it, being beset by 1000 Horse and 10000 Foot, but the other Forces coming to their Rescue the Moores retired. Still our Men pursued close upon their Rear, and the Fight was renewed in the Olive Gardens of the City. D. John de Aragon, Earl of Ribagorça, signalized himself in this Ingagement, and had his Horse killed under him. King Ferdinand, the Summer being near spent, Garrisoned the Towns he had taken, and left D. Frederick, Son to the Duke of Alva, to Command on the Frontiers, by that means ending the Competition betwixt the Nobility of Andaluzia about that Post. At this time Galicia was in an uproar, because the Earl of Lemos had possessed himself of Pon∣ferrada, a very strong Town, and turned out the King's Garrison. The Earl upon his sub∣mission was pardoned, only that Town with some others were taken from him, and annexed to the Crown. The King and Queen having performed their Devotions at Santiago, returned to Salamanca, at the beginning of the year 1487. Here they resolved to erect a new supream Court in Galicia, to curb that Mutinous People. Frederick, Son to the Duke of Alva, was ambitious of signalizing himself. A great number of Christian Captives that were kept in the Dungeons of Malaga gave intelligence, that if the Christians attempted the Town, they would break Prison, and let them into the Town. Six hundred Horse sent by him to this pur∣pose were disappointed, because the Rivers were swelled and impassable. In the City Gra∣nada the Animosities ran as high as ever betwixt the Two Moorish Kings, insomuch that Albo∣hardil having brought Forces from Guadix and Baça, attacked the Castle of Albaicin and en∣tred it. Boabdil coming on with his Guard, soon repulsed his Enemy. They fought despe∣rately in the place before the great Mosque, and many were killed on both sides. King Ferdi∣nand came from Salamanca to Cordova on the 2d of March. Thence, understanding the dan∣ger that King his Confederate was in, he sent him Succours under the Command of Ferdinand Alvarez de Gadea, Commander of Colomera. With this Supply he gained much upon his Ad∣versary, to the great destruction of the Citizens, who like Mad men ran to their Ruin, siding with the Two Kings.\n\nCHAP. VI. King Ferdinand takes Malaga and other Places from the Moores; Albohardil King of Granada having been defeated by the Christians, is expell'd by his Subjects, and Boab∣dil proclaimed King; Mighty Discoveries made by the Portugueses in the East.\n\nIT was debated at Cordova how to carry on the War. Some were for besieging Baça, o∣thers Gu••dix. The King resolved to attempt Malaga, because it lay opportunely for the Moores to receive Succours out of Africk, the passage there being but short. He set out of Cordova on the 7th of April, without communicating his Design to any Body. His Army consisted of 12000 Horse and 40000 Foot. Being come upon the Moorish Territories he dis∣covered his Design, and encouraged his Men to undertake that great and glorious Work, assuring them it would be the Ruin of the Infidels Dominion in Spain. The King's Will being known, all the Soldiers readily promised to undergo any labour or danger, shewing their rea∣diness to follow wheresoever he would lead. In their March the Army attacked Velez, a Town near Malaga. The Garrison sallying, fell upon the Troops of Galicia, which, tho couragious enough, not being well Disciplined, were worsted, till other Forces coming up, the Enemy were drove within the Walls. The Suburbs being taken, the Artillery was planted to batter the Town. All the Country about rose to succour the Besieged, but to no purpose. Albohardil understanding the Design of the Christians, resolved to relieve that City, on which his whole Kingdom depended. To this purpose he sent before Reduan Venegas, Governor of Granada, a brave Soldier, with some Foot, and 300 Horse, promising to follow them very speedily. Reduan designed to surprize our Guards, and nail the Cannon. His Design failed. The Moorish King came, and incamped on a Ground difficult of access near the Town. In his Army were 20000 Horse, and a like number of Foot. Tho weaker than the Christians he thought the advantage of Ground might secure him; it availed him not, for the Christians charged him, forced his Works, and plundered his Baggage. Their Consternation was such that all fled, and what was worst, the poor King being overthrown and forsaken, the People of Granada at his return shut the Gates against him. This done, they all unanimously pro∣claimed his Competitor Boabdil. No hopes of Relief being left, Velez was surrendred on the 27th of April, upon Condition the Inhabitants might depart whither they pleased, carrying their Goods with them. Immediately upon the surrender of Velez, another Town near it called Bentome opened its Gates, and received a Garrison. The Government of this Town was given to Peter Navarro, who being by Birth a Mean Person, and but a Private Sailer, became a most famous Captain. The People of Malaga despairing that they should be able to hold out long, Abenconnixa their Governor, with the assistance of John de Robles, who had been long a Slave in Malaga, came to the Army to Treat of a Surrender. Certain Soldiers of Barbary who were in Garrison there, having notice of this Design, fearing left they should be delivered up to the Enemy, and in a rage because they had not been consulted in that Affair, possessed themselves of the Castle that commands the City, called Alcaçava, turned out the Garrison that was in it, and killed a Brother of Abenconnixa. Then placing Guards on the Walls, and shutting the Gates, they put any of the Townsmen to death that were suspected of holding Correspondence with the Christians. The thoughts of a Surrender fail∣ing, the King caused heavy Cannon to be brought from Antequera, and incamped on the 15th of May before Malaga. The City is seated on a Plain, but on a rising Ground are two Castles, the lowest called Alcaçava, the highest Gebalfaro. It is small in compass, but beau∣tiful, and well Peopled. It is also a Seaport Town, and towards the Land is encompassed with Mountains, on which are many Orchards and Country-Houses. Between the two Castles runs a Line of Communication. The Country is pleasant and fruitful, and was then rich by reason of the Trade of Africk, and the East. In the King's Army was most of the Nobility of Andaluzia and Castile, and many Aragonians. It was resolved to draw a Trench round the City, to terminate at the Sea on both sides, and to keep a Force on the Hill on which the lesser Fort stands. The Marquess of Cadiz commanded on the Hill. The Queen came to the Siege, and with her the Cardinal of Spain, and Bishop of Avila. Many Skirmishes hapned before the Trenches were finished, in one of which John de Ortega, who had done great Service this War, was killed. On the 29th of May 3000 Moores sallied, and attacked the Marquess of Cadiz his Quarters, killing the Out-guards, and entring his Works. The Marquess nothing daunted, having drawn up his Men, charged the Enemy. Many were killed on both sides, and the Marquess wounded, but at last the Infidels were obliged to re∣tire. Some in the Town believing themselves lost, resolved to kill the King. Among these, one who was accounted a Holy Man, to compass his Design; suffered himself to be taken. He desired to be carried before the King, who at that time, as God ordered it, was taking his rest, therefore the Queen commanded him to be carried before the Marquess of Moya. The Moor, by the Riches he saw in the Tent, guess'd it to be the King's, and drawing a Cimiter, which through oversight had not been taken from him, made at D. Alvaro de Portugall, who was accidentally talking with the Lady Marchioness. He bowing his Body, escaped the Blow, and the Moore was killed by those that came in to rescue D. Alvaro. Thus through God's\n\nMercy that danger was diverted. The Army was increased by the arrival of the Duke of Medina Sidonia. Maximilian Duke of Austria, who was afterwards Emperor, sent two Ships from Flanders laden with all manner of Warlike Stores, under the Command of D. Ladron de Guevara. The number of the Besieged also increased, for that some got into the City through the Works next the Sea. Hunger pinched, and yet the Barbary Soldiers would hear of no Capitulation. The Citizens were for surrendring. One of them called Dordux, a Man of great Note, went out to Capitulate. The King said, there were no Conditions to be al∣lowed, but they must surrender upon Discretion. This was in publick, but under-hand he promised Dordux, that if he managed that Business well, he and all his Kindred should not only be set free, but well Rewarded. The Moore undertook to do it, and accordingly admitted the Christians into the Castle, and set up their Colours on the highest Tower. This terrified both the Citizens and Barbary Soldiers, yet at the same time they hoped the Capitulation made by Dordux would extend to them all. For this reason they packed up their Goods to depart, but they were deceived, for their Goods and Liberty were taken from them. The same hapned to the Soldiers who drew out near the Sea to march away. All the Africans, with their Com∣mander Zegri, were made Prisoners. Many Christians who had fled to the Moores were put to death. The Jews who after being Baptized, had relapsed, were burnt. All the other Jews and Moores, who were Natives of the City, were allowed to Ransom themselves at an easie rate. This Noble City was taken on the 18th of August, for which there was General Rejoycing and Thanksgiving throughout all Spain. It appeared, that in the time of the Goths it had been a Bishoprick, and therefore the Pope granted his Bull to restore that Dignity. The general Joy for this Success was somewhat abated by the News that Bajazet, the Great Turk, provided a mighty Fleet to invade Sicily, by that means to divert the Spaniards from the Conquest of Granada.\n\nWhilst the Moores were running to ruin, the Portugueses sending out Fleets every year, o∣pened themselves a way to the Eastern Countreys. A mighty Undertaking, first commenced, as has been said, by Prince Henry, who first caused the Coast of Africk, along the Ocean, to be discovered. This Work was continued several years after without intermission. But the Profit in those Discoveries not answering the Trouble and Cost, they designed to pass on∣ward to the rich Provinces of India, to bring home to their Country the Riches of those Parts, which Heaven had so largely bestowed upon those People, as all sorts of Spice, Precious Stones, Pearls, Gold, Silver, Ivory, and many other Things which the insatiable Pride of Man rather than Necessity has caused to be highly valued. Things strange and at that great distance are never truly represented, but highly magnified. It was reported there were Woods of great tall Trees, of Cinnamon, Cassiafistula, and Cloves, great store of Pepper and Gin∣ger, Beasts of extraordinary Shapes, and Men of strange Customs and Countenances. The Wiser sort thought it a great Madness for a Kingdom so small, and of so little strength as Portugal, to seek out those Nations, seated in respect to them, in the utmost bounds of the Earth, and parted from them by such a vast Ocean. But all Difficulties yielded to Avarice and Ambition. To this purpose the King of Portugal some years since sent Bartholomew Diaz, an able Pilot, to the Cape of Good Hope, which is the utmost point of Africk to the South, and beyond the Equinoctial. He passed that Cape, and came to a River which he called Del Infante. With Bartholomew Diaz went F. Antony of the Order of S. Francis, who was an Active and Bold Man. He having viewed a great part of Africk and Assia, travelling from that place came at last to Hierusalem. Lastly, he returning by Land, and Bartholomew Diaz by Sea, gave an Account to the King of what they had discovered. This encouraged the Portu∣gueses to proceed in so great an Undertaking. For the better carrying on of their Design, they chose two Men of Courage and Experience, and that were great Masters of the Ara∣bick Language, to proceed in this Discovery, one of them was Peter Covillam, and the other Alonso de Payva. To save the vast Charge of a Fleet they were sent by Land to discover the inferior Parts of Africk and Asia, each of them taking one of those Parts of the World for his Province. With these Instructions they set out of Lisbon on the 15th of May, took Naples and Rome in their way, thence passed to Hierusalem, then to Alexandria, and so to Grand Caire, the principal City of Egypt. Here they parted, Peter Cavillam for Ormuz, an Island at the mouth of the Persian Gulph, and thence to Calicut. Alonso de Payva undertook to exa∣mine the Inland of Ethiopia, where he died. For this Reason, and because he received Letters from the King, ordering him not to return till he had surveyed all those Provinces, Peter Co∣villam went into Ethiopia. Alexander, Nau, and David, successively Emperors of Ethiopia, and vulgarly called Prester John, took an Affection to Covillam, and therefore would not suf∣fer him to return home, but gave him a Wife and Land to live upon. Since he could not re∣turn, he thence sent an Account to the King in Writing of all he had seen. He said Calicut was the Richest and most famous Place of Trade in all the East, the Inhabitants of a Sallow Complexion, not Warlike, and Extravagant in their manner of living: That they went Naked from the Waste upwards, wore much Gold and Silk, their Arms loaded with Pearls, a Cimiter hanging from their Shoulders. That one Woman Married several Husbands, for which reason no body Knowing the Father, the Nephews, being Sons of Sisters, Inherited. That in Ethiopia were many large Provinces of Blacks, that they all profess Christianity, but much corrupted with Jewish and Heretical Customs. That they were all subject to one power∣ful\n\nCHAP. VII. Tumults in Aragon, the Cities Associate there; The War with the Moores renewed, and several Places taken from them, which they with the same facility recover; Maximi∣lian King of the Romans aimes to Marry the Princess Elizabeth of Castile\n\nAFter the taking of Malaga, when King Ferdinand thought to have gone on in his Con∣quest, the troubles in Aragon oblged him to go thither, to put a stop to the Murders and Robberies committed there. At Valencia D. Philip de Aragon Master of the Order of Montesa killed John de Valterra, a noble Youth and his Rival, for both Courted the Lady Ellenor Marchioness of Cotron, and Daughter of Anthony Centellas, which occasioned great Tumults in that City. To obviate these harms, King Ferdinand set out from Cordova, and arrived at Zaragoça on the 19th of November. The manner of choosing Magistrates in that City was altered. The Council and Commons used before to have the Election of them, and now because that produced Disputes and Mutinies, they desired for the Future the No∣mination of them should be in the King. Besides the Towns associated after the manner of Castile, each engaging to contribute to the Maintenance of 150 Horse, who were to Travel about, and punish all Malefactors. It was Ordained that the King should have the choosing of the Captain of this Association, or Brotherhood, out of 3 Citizens of Zaragoça, named by the Council of that City. Laws were also Enacted to prevent their abusing the Power given them. This was concluded at the beginning of the Year 1488. At the same time came Leonard Tocco a Grecian, and of the Family of the Grecian Emperors (whom the Turks had drove out of his Dominions, and obliged to fly into Italy) Ambassador from the King of Naples, to conclude the Match before proposed betwixt the Grandson of that King, and the Princess Elizabeth, Daughter to King Ferdinand. This Affair took not Effect, because the King designed to Marry his Daughter to the King of France, or else to the Prince of Portugal, hoping that would be a secure Band of friendship with either of those Nations. Instead of her, he offered his other Daughter the Princess Mary. From Zaragoça the King and Queen went to Valencia, thither came to them Alan Father to John d' Albret, King of Navarre. He came to ask Succour against the King of France who had Conquered part of that Kingdom, and the Navarrois themselves who were in Rebellion, particularly the Biamonteses were posses∣sed of great part of Navarre, and kept the King out; notwithstanding, but three Years be∣fore all things had been agreed, and the Earl of Lerin with his whole Family and followers had been restored to their Possessions, and others given them that they might rest contented. It was also proposed that the King should Protect Francis Duke of Britany, whose Daughter Ann, many Princes sought to have to Wife, because he had no Heir Male. Charles the 8th, King of France made War on him on this account. Monsieur d' Albret and the Duke of Orleans favoured that Duke. Maximilian then King of the Romans was assaulted by the People of Bruges in Flanders, and kept Prisoner. All these things troubled the King because Maximi∣lian was a friend to Spain, and d' Albret who gave the Intelligence, his Confederate. In fine a League was concluded betwixt the King and Alan, against all Princes, except the King of France, whom it was not convenient for Alan or his Son to disoblige, because their Domi∣nions were either in his Power, or at least lay exposed to him, yet all this was Counterfeit, for the real design was to make use of the Forces of Spain against France. It was agreed a∣mong other things, that a Fleet should be fittedout on the Coast of Biscay, and Men raised to be sent to Britany, under the Command of Michael John de Gralla a Catalonian. All this Affair was Concluded and Signed on the 21th of March.\n\nThe Cortes of Valencia were opened in that City, and broke up at Origuela, to settle that Country, which done, King Ferdinand made hast through the Kingdom of Murcia, that bor∣ders on the Moorish Territories. Great preparations were made for carrying on the War, and subduing that Country where Albohardil with much difficulty supported the Title of a King, tho' still stronger than his Nephew, as being possessed of Guadix Almeria, and Baça, with all the Mountain Country of Granada, which was as far as the Sea, whence he gathered a greater Revenue because the Mountain was untouched, besides the great advantage made of the silken Manufacture which is the best of all Spain. The Natives hated Boabdil, looking upon him as a Coward and Friend to the Christians, and Albohardil had gained Reputation by taking a great Booty about Alcalà Real. John de Benavides who Commanded there, soon revenged this Loss, burning all the Territory of Almeria. The Warlike preparations were not carried on with that Vigour the King could have wished, because Andalvzia had suffered this Year and the last by the Plague. The King Ordered the Rendezvouz to be at Murcia, where he was resolving to Attack Vera, a Town upon the Sea-coast. No resistance was made, but it surrendred on the 10th of June. Muxacra, Velez el Blanco and Velez el Rubio\n\nwith several other Towns and Castles that were not well Fortified did the same. The King was desirous to lay Siege to Almeria, a City in that Neighbourhood. An impregnable Castle called Taberna stood in the way, and the old Moorish King came in Person with 1000 Horse, and 20000 Foot to put a Garrison into it, resolving to lie in the Woods and cut off our Parties, and avoid coming to a Battle, because his Men were raw and undisciplined. The Enemy refusing to Fight, our Forces had the more liberty to wast the Country. Most harm was done about Almeria and Baça, which is a fruitful Country because watered. The Chan∣nels that convey the Water were the occasion that many of our Men were cut off, and a∣mong them D. Philip de Aragon Master of the Order of Montesa, a forward and brave Youth. King Ferdinand, his Forces being weak, and he called away upon other Affairs, having Gar∣risoned the Frontiers, went away towards Castile. No sooner was he gone, but the Moorish King recovered all the Towns had been taken from him. Mean while the Inhabitants of Guasin a very strong Town near Ronda conspiring, put all the Garrison to the Sword. It was not long before they received the reward of that Action, for the neighbouring Moores to shew they had no hand in that Slaughter, and fearing least they should suffer for it, assembled and laid Siege to Guasin. The Marquess of Cadiz and Earl of Cifuentes came with Forces from Sevil to their Assistance, and having taken the Town, in Revenge either put all the Inhabi∣tants to the Sword, or sold them as Slaves. King Ferdinand came to Valladolid upon the 6th of September. There an opportunity was offered him of recovering the City Placencia, which the late Kings had Alienated, and given to the Family of Zun̄iga. D. Alvaro de Zuniga dy∣ing, a Grandson of his, whose Father was dead before, Inherited his Estate. James de Zu∣niga Unckle to the Heir pretended he had a better Right, as being Son to the deceased. The Kindred was divided between both. Thus the Family of the Caravajales seized the City, but could not make themselves Masters of the Castle which was well defended by the Garrison. King Ferdinand coming to appease that Sedition, seized all, D. Alvaro the new Duke sur∣rendring, and contenting himself with the Town of Bejar and its Dependancies in lieu of that City. This struck a Terror into all the Nobility, fearing they should be forced to re∣store to the King now grown strong, all they had extorted from his Predecessors in times of Consusion. New Tumults broke out in Aragon, upon account that the Nobility were for breaking off the Association not long since formed betwixt the Cities, as a thing that Curb∣ed them. They never gave over till some Years after; at the Cortes held at Barcelona, they obtained the Association should be dissolved for Ten Years. John de Fonseca and Alvaro Ar∣ronio were sent Ambassadors to Flanders, to procure the Liberty of Maximilian King of the Romans, imprisoned by the People of Bruges. They managed their business so well that he was Released and Reconciled to his Subjects. His first Wife the Lady Mary, to whom be∣longed the Dominion of Flanders being dead, he aspired to Marry the Princess Elizabeth of Castile. Her Father and Mother did not consent, because she was promised in Portugal, yet they offered one of that Princess's Sisters for Philip his Son and Heir. Frederick the Emperor, his Grandfather upon this design of Marrying him in Spain gave him the Title of Archduke of Austria, whereas before they were only called Dukes. The Fleet the Lord d' Albret was sitting out on the Coast of Biscay, contributed much towards the obtaining the Liberty of Maximilian, the People of Bruges being jealous it was designed against them. The Fleet Sailed to Britany, where the Duke of Orleans and his Confederates were overthrown by the King, the Duke and John Gralla who Commanded the Spaniards were made Prisoners, as shall be said hereafter.\n\nAll this tended towards subduing of the Kingdom of Naples, which some of the Banished Nobility offered to King Ferdinand, and others to the King of France, as the more Powerful and an Enemy to the House of Aragon. At the beginning of the Year 1489, 1000 Horse and 2000 Foot were sent into Britany to succour the Lady Ann, who succeeded her Father in that Dukedom. D. Peter Sarmiento Earl of Salinas Commanded that Body. The War against the Moores of Granada was of more Moment, and greater advantages were expected from it, therefore the King and Queen set out from Medina del Campo towards Andaluzia upon the 27th of March. The Rendezvous was at Jaen, where upon a Muster the King found 12000 Horse, and 50000 Foot, all the choice Men in the Kingdom. A good Body came from Biscay. Baça was resolved upon to begin the Campaigne with. By the Way, that no E∣nemy might be left behind, they took Cajor a small, but strong Town. This done Baça was Invested. This City is Seated on the Side of a Hill, down which, and along the plain below it, runs a small River, on all other sides it is encompassed with other rising Grounds. It was well Garrisoned and furnished with all Necessaries for 15 Months. The Scituation did not allow any Engines to be brought up to the Walls. About 1000 Horse, and 2000 Foot sallied out of the City and did us some harm, our Men being intangled betwixt the Chan∣nels of Water, but others coming to their Relief, the Enemy was repulsed with considerable loss. Several other Skirmishes happened, our Men destroying all the Orchards about the City. Our Men could not deal with the Enemy upon equal Terms, but they overpowred them in number. Thus the Siege was prolonged, and King Ferdinand was dubious whether he had not best raise the Siege, especially because he lost many of his Men by Sickness and other accidents. The Marquess of Cadiz then made a Duke, advised to raise the Siege However the King resolved to continue it, and the more to Curb the Besieged caused a Trench to be drawn quite round the Walls, with Nine Forts at convenient distances, all strongly Guarded, to prevent being surprized by the Enemy Sallying. All the Army was conveniently Posted about the Place, and the Duke of Cadiz with 4000 Horse had charge of the Artillery. Thus no relief could enter the City, but they had plenty of Provisions. In the Camp there was great scarcity of Bread and Money, and yet fresh Troops came in daily. About October came the Dukes of Najara and Alva, in Mourning for their Fa∣ther lately deceased. The Admiral also came, and the Marquis de Astorga. Soon after arrived the Queen, with the Princess Elizabeth, the Cardinal of Toledo and other Prelates. The Queens coming, as I believe altered the resolution of the Besieged, believing now the Siege was fixed. Hazen the Governor having consulted his King, who was at Guadix, tho' he might have held out much longer, surrendred the City, when least the Christians expected it. On the 4th of December the Capitulation was Signed, and the day following the King and Queen entred the City in triumphant manner. James de Mendoza, Lieute∣nant of Caçorla, and Brother to the Cardinal of Spain was made Governor. This struck such a Terror into the Moores that many Towns surrendred, gave Hostages, and furnish∣ed Corn and all other necessaries. Among these the chiefest were Taverna and Seron. What is more wonderful, the Cities Guadix and Almeria, either of which might have en∣dured a long Siege, submitted of their own accord. King Albohardil himself consented to it, and came out of Almeria to meet King Ferdinand in the Camp, by whom he was splen∣didly entertained. Besides, Two strong Castles upon the Sea Coast were taken, the one called Almun̄ecar, in which the Treasures of the Moorish Kings used to be kept. The other was Solobren̄a, where the Brothers and Sons of the Kings used to be kept in the nature or Prisoners. Francis Ramirez General of the Artillery, who had behaved himself bravely up∣on several occasions, was appointed Governor of that Castle. After performing such great Actions, a Review of the Army was taken on the last day of December preceding the Year 1490, and it appeared by the Muster Rolls 20000 Men were lost, 3000 of them killed by the Moores, the rest consumed by Sickness. Many of the meaner sort were frozen to death.\n\nKing Ferdinand let slip no Opportunity of pulling down the tottering Kingdom of the Moors. Gutierre de Cardenas, Chief Commendary of Leon, who did great Service during this War, concluded the Treaty with the unfortunate Moorish King. By Virtue of this Capitula∣tion, he had the Town of Fandaraa on the Mountains of Granada, with all its Dependencies, amounting to the Yearly Value of 10000 Ducats, allowed him for his Maintenance. A small Recompence for a Kingdom, but good enough for him who began his Reign with the Murder of his Brother. The new conquered Moors were allowed to keep their Lands and Possessions, but not to live within Cities, lest they should have the Power of Fortifying themselves, and Rebelling, for which cause they were all disarmed. These Conditions were proclaimed at Guadix. This done, the King and Queen went away to Ecija, and thence to Sevil. All Places by the way received them, as if they had dropped from Heaven. Foreign Princes, moved by the Fame of these great Actions, sent to Congratulate with them, and seek their Friendship. The King of Portugal, in Prosecution of what had been before Treated, desired to Marry his Son Alonso to the Princess Elizabeth, as a sure Bond of Friendship between the two Crowns. He sent Ambassadors to this purpose, and the Match was agreed upon at Se∣vil on the 18th of April. There was great Rejoicing on this account in both Kingdoms, but less in Portugal, because the following Month the Princess Joanna, Sister to that King, died at\n\nAveiro unmarried. Neither was the Joy of Castile lasting, tho' the Princess from Constantina set out for Portugal upon the 11th of November. A great number of Nobility bore her Com∣pany, and she was delivered up on the Banks of the River Caya, which runs between Badajoz and Elvas. The Chief of the Portugueses that came to receive her, was Duke Emanuel, who afterwards married that Princess, and inherited the Crown. The King of Portugal and his Son came to Estremez, and, the more to honour the Bride, seated her between them, the King being on the left hand. There they were married on the 24th of November by the Archbishop of Braga, Primate of all Portugal. The Rejoicing continued for half a year at Ebora and Santarem, whither the Prince and Princess went. All this Joy was turned into Sor∣row by an unthought-of Accident. The King going out to take the Air on the Banks of the River Tagus, Prince Alonso, who was with him, had a mind to run a Race with John de Mene∣ses. In the Course, the Horse stumbled, and falling, so bruised the Prince, that he soon died It is needless to represent the greatness of his Parents and Wife's Grief. His Body was buried with the usual Pomp among his Ancestors. The Princess Elizabeth, no sooner a Wife than a Widow, returned to Castile in a Mourning Litter. Grief cast the King of Portugal into a lin∣gring Disease, of which he died 4 years after. He founded the Royal Hospital at Lisbon, and laid the first Stone of it. He left no Issue Male lawfully begotten; only D. George, whom he had by the Lady Ann de Mendoça, and whom, tho' but a Child, he left Master of Avis and Santiago in Portugal. After his Death, a new Line of Kings began. Emanuel, Cousin German to the deceased King, and Son to Ferdinand Duke of Viseo, inherited the Crown. John III. was Son to this King, and Prince John his Grandson, who dying young, inherited not the Crown: Therefore King Sebastian, Son to the Prince, succeeded. He being killed by the Moors in Africk, left the Kingdom of Portugal, first to Cardinal Henry his Great Uncle, and after him to Philip II. King of Castile, who was also Nephew to the Cardinal, and Grandson to King Emanuel, by his Mother Elizabeth the Empress. Let us leave this, and return to the War of Granada.\n\nKing Ferdinand earnestly desired to put an end to the War with the Moors, which was so well advanced. Besides the Strength of the City Granada, and that it was abundantly furnished with all Necessaries, another greater Difficulty perplexed the King, which was, That his Word was engaged to King Boabdil, that neither he nor his should be prejudiced by him. An Op∣portunity offered it self of subduing that City without breach of Faith. The Citizens, without regarding the Danger that threatned them from abroad, besieged their King in the Castle of Albaycin, and pressed him so hard, that scarce any hope was left of saving himself. The fu∣rious Multitude threatned, never to desist till they had his Life. It was not reasonable to for∣sake that unhappy Prince, when he begged Relief. At the same time the Soldan of Egypt threatned, That if King Ferdinand did not give over persecuting the Moors, he would put to Death all the Christians in Egypt and Syria. F. Anthony Millan, Guardian of the Franciscan Convent at Jerusalem, sent by the Soldan with this Message, by the way visited the King of Naples, and coming thence into Spain, delivered his Embassy, bringing also a Letter from the King of Naples, who was supposed to be a greater Friend to the Moors, than became a Chri∣stian Prince. He advised King Ferdinand, since the Moors had done him no Wrong, not to oppress them only upon account of Religion, which might occasion greater Harms. King Fer∣dinand was no way discouraged at the Threats of the Soldan, nor approved of the King of Naples his Advice. Yet after the War was ended, he sent Peter Martyr, his Ambassador, to the Soldan to appease him. He also, before he enter'd upon the War again, sent his Reasons for so doing to the King of Naples. The Guardian, both in regard of his Character as Am∣bassador, and the Opinion of his Sanctity, was nobly Treated, and dismissed with rich Pre∣sents. King Ferdinand offered the Citizens of Granada, if they would submit, they should be treated in the same manner as the others that had done so before. This moved both the Fa∣ctions in that City to join, in order to oppose the Common Enemy; for the Moorish King was convinced, that King Ferdinand, tho' he pretended to be his Friend, would never desist till he was Master of that City. The Alfaquies and others, held in the Opinion of Sanctity, ceased not to advise, that either for obtaining Peace, or supporting the War, it was requisite they should be united. Thus the Moors were brought to agree among themselves. King Ferdinand, leaving the Queen at Moclin, wasted all the Plain of Granada, destroying all the Corn, to the great Grief of the Infidels, who feared lest they should be reduced by Famine. Prince John bore his Father Company in this Expedition, being newly Knighted by him. They returned to Cordova with the Booty. The Command of the Frontiers was given to the Marquess de Vil∣lena, in Requital for a Brother he lost in the War, and that his own right Arm was lame of a Wound he received rescuing one of his Men, Scarce were the Christians departed, when King Boabdil took the Castle Alhendin, where we had a Garrison, and razed it. The King revenged this in September, when he spent 15 days in destroying all the latter Corn on which the Moors hoped to feed the following year. The Moors at Guadix mutinied, and thought to have destroyed the Garrison in the Castle, but failed, and the Marquis de Villena coming with a good Body of Horse and Foot, turned them out of the City, which prevented any Disorders for the future. K. Ferdinand at the end of the year again ravaged all the Territory of Granada. Boabdil besieged Salobreria, which Francis Ramirez defended with much Bravery. The Moors believing King Ferdinand would relieve the Place, raised the Siege, and returned to Granada.\n\nCHAP. IX. The War with the Moors now effectually renewed; The Description of the City Granada; King Ferdinand lays Siege to it, and builds a Town for his Army to Quarter in during the Siege, to shew his Resolution not to depart without being Master of that City.\n\nTHE King and Queen spent the Winter at Sevil, and in the Spring renewed the War. The Queen stayed behind at Alcala Reall with her Children, to furnish all things necessary, and soon after to follow and take part of the Honour and Danger of that Enterprize. All the Nobility came in Person, and the Cities sent Troops upon their own cost, with which and the other Forces King Ferdinand in three days appeared in sight of Granada, upon Saturday the 23d of April, 1491. He encamped at Guetar, a Village a League and a half from Granada: Thence he sent the Marquess de Villena with 3000 Horse to scour the neighbouring Moun∣tains, promising to follow him with the whole Army to relieve him, in case the Mountain-Moors, who are bold and daring, should fall upon him, or those of the City offer to cut off his Retreat. Accordingly he advanced to Padul, and repulsed the Moors of the City, who thought to fall upon the Marquess's Rear. By this means the Marquess was left at liberty to execute his Orders, burnt 9 Villages of the Infidels, and returned to the King loaded with Plunder. This beginning was looked upon as a good Omen of future success. They advan∣ced together to ravage the remoter Parts of the Mountain, which they did successfully, plunder∣ing and burning 15 other Villages. Besides, they defeated a Body of Moorish Horse and Foot, who had secured the Passes against our Army. The Booty was very considerable, that Country being very rich, because untouched till that time, being naturally strong and well guarded, as was requisite, the City being supplied there with Provisions. All this being per∣formed without any loss or bloodshed, the Army returned to its first Quarters; there they fortified themselves for the present. They mustered 10000 Horse and 40000 Foot, the very Flower of the Spanish Soldiery, being all Men of tried Valour, and expert Soldiers. In the City was also a great number of Horse and Foot, and all of them good Soldiers, being the Remains of all the late Wars. The multitude of Citizens was not of any moment, they being a sort of People always lavish of their Tongues, but Cowards when they came to Action. The City of Granada, by reason of its Situation, Largness, Forts, Walls, and Bul∣warks, seemed impregnable. On the West-side of it is a large Plain, about 15 Leagues in compass, pleasant and fruitful as well of its own Nature, as by reason of the Blood that had been there shed for many Years, which made it fat: Besides, that 36 Springs running down from the Mountains do render it more beautiful and rich than can easily be imagined. On the East of it is the Mountain Elvira, where formerly stood the City Iliberis, as appears by the Name Elvira. The snowy Mountain called Sierra Nevada lies on the South-side of it, and runs down as far as the Mediterranean Sea: The sides of it are not steep or craggy, and are there∣fore cultivated and well peopled. The City it self is seated partly upon the Plain, and partly upon two Hills; betwixt them runs the River Darro, which as soon as out of the City, mixes with, and loses its Name in the River Xenil, that runs quite a cross the Plain in length. The Walls are very strong, there being upon them 1030 Towers at distances, very beautiful for their Number and good Structure. Formerly it had 7 Gates, now 12. It cannot well be en∣closed all round, because of its great extent, and the unevenness of the Ground. Towards the Plain where the access is easiest, it is fortified with Towers and Bulwarks: In that part stands the Cathedral, then a Moorish Mosque nothing curious, now beautiful. It is held in great Veneration by all the neighbouring People, and famous not so much for its Riches as the Number and Piety of Clergy belonging to it. Near this Church is the great Market∣place called Bavarambla, 200 Foot in breadth, and three times as long. The Buildings about it stand in a streight Line; the Shops and Streets about it beautiful. Of two Castles that belong to the City, the chiefest lies betwixt the East and West, encompassed with a Wall of its own, and standing above the other Buildings. It is called Alhambra, that is Red, of the colour of the Earth about it, and is so big it looks like a City. In it is the Royal Palace and Monastery of S Francis, the burial place of the Marquess de Yn̄igo de Mendoça, the first Go∣vernour of it. King Mahomet Mir laid the Foundation of this Castle; other Kings conti∣nued the Work, and it was finished by King Joseph Bulhagix, as appears by the Arabick In∣scription over the Gate on a Marble Stone, signifying the Work was finished by that King, in the Year of the Moorish Account 747, which according to us is 1346. This same King built the Castle of Albaizin, opposite to this Castle. The expence of this Work was so great, that because 'twas thought his Revenue could not bear it, the People gave out he had found the Philosopher's Stone. Betwixt these two Castles, that is, Alhambra and Albaizin, lies the City. The Suburb called Churra, and the Street Dę los Gomeles, is on the side of Alhambra. On the\n\nother side the Street Elvira, and the Ascent of Zenete most ill contrived, the Streets narrow and crooked, because the Moors were nothing curious in their Houses. Without the City is the Royal Hospital and Monastery of S. Hierome, the sumptuous Burial-place of Gonçalo Fernandez, called the Great Captain. It is reported the City contained 60000 Houses, a number scarce credible. What is most to be admired is what we find the Ambassadors of King Jayme II. of Aragon assured Pope Clement V. at the Council of Vienna, viz. that of 200000 Souls then li∣ving in Granada, scarce 500 were Children and Grandchildren of Moors. In particular they said there were 50000 Renegado's, and 30000 Christian Slaves. At present it is certain there are in that City 23 Parishes and Chapels of Ease. It is hard to tell the number of Inhabitants, and generally People stretch in those cases. It is also certain, that in the time of the Moorish Kings, the Revenue of that Kingdom was 700000 Ducats, a great Sum for those times, but credible because of the heavy Taxes. All Men paid the 7th part of what they were worth. If any Moor died without Children, the King was his Heir: If he left Heirs, the King had as good a share as any of them. This was the Posture of Granada at this time. It was believed the Siege would be tedious, therefore the Queen came to the Camp with her Children, be∣cause King Ferdinand resolved not to desist till he was Master of the City. To this purpose he caused the Country continually to be wasted, and in the place where he encamped, caused a strong Town to be built, which to this day is called Santa Fé. This Work was finished in a very short time. The Quarters, Streets, and Places within the Walls were distributed with great Order. Mean while the Parties that went out to Plunder, skirmished often with the Moors that came out of the Town. In one of these Rencounters our Men pressed so far, that they took some Cannon from the Infidels, and made many Prisoners, and forced the rest into the City. Another time they ventured near to the Walls, and possessed themselves of two Towers where the Enemy kept Garrisons. On the 10th of June at night a Fire broke out in the King's Tent, which caused a great Consternation. Most of the Men lay in Bar∣racks or Huts, and the Boughs being dry, there was danger they should all take fire. A Candle accidentally left by the Queen, set fire to the King's Quarters, and that to the next. The King fearing it might be a Contrivance of the Enemy, came out naked with his Sword and Buckler. The Marquess of Cadiz with a Party of Horse stood all night upon their Guard, in the way the Moors must of necessity come, if they designed to attack the Army The Fright was greater than the Danger or Loss; so the next day they continued to ravage the Country, and some Troops were sent to the Mountain. Nothing was left to the Besieged tho' they, animated by Despair, defended themselves resolutely. These Misfortunes obliged them to offer a Treaty. Bulcazin Muley, Governour of the City, came to the Camp to ca∣pitulate. The King appointed Gonçalo Fernandez de Cordova, afterwards called the Great Cap∣tain, and his Secretary Ferdinand de Zafra, to treat with him. After some days debating, at length they concluded on the following Articles, to which they swore on the 25th of Novem∣ber: That the Moors within 60 Days deliver up to the King the two Castles, the Towers, and Gates of the City: That they do Homage to King Ferdinand, and take the Oath of Allegi∣ance to him: That they set at liberty all Christian Slaves without Ransom: That till these Articles be performed, they deliver up 500 Sons of the Principal Inhabitants, as Hostages: That they be left possessed of their Lands, Arms, and Horses, only delivering up the Ar∣tillery: That they keep their Mosques, and have the free Exercise of their Religion: That they be Governed according to their own Laws, and to this purpose Persons of their own Nation shall be appointed, by whose Advice the King's Officers shall administer Justice to them: That part of the usual Taxes be abated during the term of three Years, and shall never after be greater than they used to pay to their own Kings: That such as will go over into Africk may sell their Goods, and shall be furnished with Ships for their Passage in any Port they shall chuse: That Boabdil's Son, and the other Hostages delivered by him, be re∣stored, since the City being surrendered, there is no more occasion for Hostages. Accor∣dingly they were brought from the Castle of Moclin to be delivered up.\n\nof their Senses. The cause of their Discontent, or what they aimed at, was unknown, and therefore the Remedy harder to be found. Boabdil, called the Little King, fearing they would offer Violence to him, kept close within the Alhambra. The Multitude are furious at first, but soon cool, chiefly they who had no Head, and were consequently weak, and knew not their own Minds Therefore the next day the King went to the Albaizin, where the People were well affected towards him: There he assembled such as he thought fit, with whom he expo∣stulated the Madness of the Mutiniers, shewing how absolute Necessity and not Affection had obliged him to Capitulate with the Enemy, when no other way was left to save the City from perishing by Sword and Famine. His Words made them calm, and the People were pacified. Many times Seditions are as easily suppressed as raised. What became of the Moor who caused the Mutiny is not known; it may be imagined he fled. King Boabdil warned by the Danger past; and fearing that before the expiration of the Days agreed upon for delivering up the City, new Troubles and Tumults might arise, he immediately sent a Letter to King Ferdinand, with a Present of two choice Horses, a Cymiter, and some Furniture. He adver∣tised him of what had hapned in the City, and how the People had Mutinied, therefore in∣viting him to come and take possession speedily, lest Delay might produce some Alteration. In short, he told him since God had so ordained it, he would the next day deliver up the Al∣hambra and Kingdom to him as Conqueror.\n\nThis Letter was brought to the Camp upon New-Year's Day: It is easie to imagin how great Satisfaction it gave to King Ferdinand. He ordered all things to be in a readiness the Day following for his Entrance, and that Day is still kept a Festival at Granada, in Memory of the Taking of that City. Having laid aside the Mourning he wore for his Son-in-Law Prince Alonso of Portugal, and put on his Royal Robes, he set out towards the Castle with his Army, in the same Order as if going to engage the Enemy. After him followed the Queen and her Children, then the Nobility clad in Cloth of Gold and rich Silks. When the King came in this pompous manner near to the Alhambra, Boabdil the Little King came out to meet him with 50 Horse. He offered to alight and kiss the Victor's Hand, but King Ferdinand would not permit it. Then fixing his Eyes upon the Ground with a sorrowful Countenance, he said, We are your Slaves, Invincible King; we deliver up this City and Kingdom to you, not doubting you will use us with Clemency and Moderation. This done, he put into his hands the Keys of the Castle; King Ferdinand gave them to the Queen, she to the Prince her Son, and he to D. In̄igo de Mendoça, Earl of Tendilla, whom the King appointed Governor of that City, and Captain General of that Kingdom. D. Peter de Granada was made head Alguazil of the City, and D. Alonso his Son Admiral of that Sea. The King entred the City with a good Party of Horse. A great Number of Noblemen and Prelates followed; among them the Chief were the Prelates of Toledo and Sevil, t"
