        "text": "The American Academy in Rome announced today the winners of the 2024–25 Rome Prize. These highly competitive fellowships support advanced independent work and research in the arts and humanities. This year, the Rome Prize—the gift of “time and space to think and work”—was awarded to thirty-one American artists and scholars, who will each receive a stipend, workspace, and room and board for five to ten months at the Academy’s eleven-acre campus in Rome, starting this September.\n\nThe Rome Prize winners will be presented in person during the Janet & Arthur Ross Rome Prize Ceremony and Concert, taking place this evening at Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall in New York. The program, comprising a selection of innovative works by Rome Prize Fellows in musical composition and an arrangement of George Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue, will be performed by the International Contemporary Ensemble under the artistic direction of George E. Lewis (2010 Resident).\n\n“The Rome Prize is one of the most storied fellowship programs in the United States,” said AAR President Peter N. Miller. “Over a thousand people compete for the chance to live and work in Rome, inspired by the city and one another. The Rome Prize winners represent a bridge between the United States and Italy, but also between a present of potential and a future of achievement.”\n\nRome Prize winners are selected annually by juries of distinguished artists and scholars through a national competition. This year’s competition received 1,106 applications—a record high—from applicants in 46 states, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico. The acceptance rate was 2.9 percent. This group of Rome Prize winners has approximately 39 percent who identify as persons of color. Thirteen percent were born outside the United States. The incoming class ranges from 26 to 70 years old, with an average age of 42.\n\nIn addition to the Rome Prize winners, the Academy announced three Italian Fellowships, through which Italian artists and scholars live and work in the Academy community, pursuing their own projects in a collaborative, interdisciplinary environment with their American counterparts. Also named was the recipient of the Terra Foundation Affiliated Fellowship for a Chicago-Based Visual Artist.\n\nA complete list of the 2024–25 Rome Prize winners and Italian Fellows is below.
