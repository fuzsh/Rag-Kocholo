(Book 2)\n\nWherein Guzman de Alfarache, treateth of that which befell him in Italie, till he returned into Spaine. (Book 2)\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nGuzman de Alfarache, leaues Siena, and goes for Florence. He meets with Saya∣vedra, whom he takes into his seruice. And before he comes to Florence, he re∣counts vnto him on the way, many admirable things concerning that 〈◊〉〈◊〉. And when he was arriued there, he shewes him all, that was worth the seeing.\n\nPHOCION (a famous Philosopher in his time) was so poore, that though he tooke a great deale of paines, he could hardly get wherewith∣all to hold life and soule together. Whereupon, as oft as any in the presence of Dionysius the Ty∣rant, and his mortall enemie, made mention ei∣ther of himselfe, or of the manner and course of his life, he made a scoffe and a iest both at it, and him, flouting at his pouertie, and deriding his miserie, thinking with himselfe, that he could not doe him any greater disgrace, nor in∣iure him more, then to mocke at the meannesse of his fortunes. As if he would haue inferred thereupon, that if he had beene a man of that great learning, as the world held him to be, he might therewith haue gained bread to put in his mouth, and not needed to liue in that want, as now he did.\n\ndescription Page 86\n\nWhen this came to the Philosophers eare, he was not only not grieued thereat, but laughing at this his follie, he answered him, that reported this vnto him; It is true sir, that Dionysius sayes of me, in terming me poore, for I am truly so; but, I must tell you withall, that he is much poorer, then my selfe, and hath a great deale more reason to be asham'd of himselfe, if he shall but consider his owne wretched estate and condition. For though I lacke mo∣ney, I want not friends: I abound in the more, and faile in the lesse. But as for him, though he be rich in money, he is poore of friends. For I know not any one that he hath. This Philosopher could not satisfie himselfe better, nor with a righter or fuller blow hit out his eyes, then by stiling him, hominem sine ami∣cis; A man, that had not so much as one friend in the world, that he could truly say, was his friend. And albeit, it oftentimes so falleth out, that they are purchased with money, and that this is a principall meanes to winne and wedge them vnto vs, yet this Tyrant had neuer yet the wit either to get or keepe them. And it is no wonder, that he should, of all other, want them. For he, that sayes friend, sayes (in that one word) Goodnesse, and Vertue; compre∣hending in that all the good, that speech, or thought, can reach vnto. Who∣soeuer therefore shall desire to conserue friendship, and to continue in his friends loue, and that the bond of amitie be not broken betweene them, must haue a care, that his workes correspond with his words. But Dionysius, being tyrannie it selfe, and of too ill a digestion to keepe friendship long, and his con∣uersation being worse then his concoction; and for that friends are not so much gotten out of the greatnesse of our fortune, as our vertue; wanting that, he wanted them.\n\nFor mine owne part, euer since I had the vse of reason, and knew what dis∣cretion was, I made it my chiefest studie, to get me friends, though at neuer so deare a rate, thinking no cost too much, to purchase so great a treasure. They seeming vnto me (as indeed they are) our greatest helps and comfort, as well in prosperous, as a duerse fortune. Who doth enioy the content of contents, but he that hath true friends? What doth so much lengthen and preserue our peace, our life, our honour, and our wealth, as to see our friends to ioy with vs in our prosperitie? And in aduersitie, from whom, but from them, can we finde any refuge, kindnesse, comfort, helpe, and a fellow-feeling of our miseries, as if they were their owne? A wise man, ought to want all whatsoeuer goods, ra∣ther then good friends. For they are better then our neerest kinsmen, or our owne naturall brothers.\n\nOf the qualities, and conditions of friendship, many haue spoken much (and one day, God willing, we shall say something thereof:) but in my opi∣nion, where friendship is professed, there must be all true and plaine dealing, and such a faire and euen cariage, that it neither leane to alteration, nor giue any offence, nor cause any trouble, nor to aduenture (through our rasn and inconsiderate actions) the loosing of a friend. Two friends ought so to loue one another, as each of them doth seuerally loue himselfe. For that I, and my friend, are as it were all one. And as you see, how quick-siluer dealeth with gold, how close it adheres vnto it, how it workes it selfe into the very entrailes and bowels of it, and being two diuers mettals, are so incorporated, that they become but one masse or lumpe, nothing in the world being able to sunder and diuide them but the pure fire of the furnace, wherein the quick-siluer is consu∣med: So a true friend, who is now become another mans selfe, and by an in∣termixture of their hearts and mindes made as it were one selfe-same thing, no∣thing ought, nor can indeed dissolue this vnion, but death, which is the Chry∣soll, wherein we must at last be all melted one after another.\n\nMan ought to make the same choise of their friends, as they doe of good bookes. For their happinesse consists not neither in the greatnesse of their number, nor the curiousnesse of their binding, but rather to haue a few, and\n\ndescription Page 87\n\nthose good and approued Authors. For oftentimes, it so falleth out, that many friends are rather a hinderance, then a helpe to true friendship: For he is a friend to none, that is a friend to all. Nor are we to choose a friend for our en∣tertainment only, and merrily to spend the time withall, but to make choise of such a one, as may benefit both our soule, and our bodie: one that without re∣spect of humane interest, will aduise him to obserue the diuine precepts. Not only to represent them vnto him, but to speake to the purpose, to admonish him to the obseruation of them, and to instruct him in the true knowledge of them. And if he be called a true friend, who meerely out of friendship, tells his friend the naked truth without masking or disguising it, not as to a third per∣son, but as to one, that is properly his owne, and as freely as if he should treat of any thing belonging to himselfe, or that he himselfe would desire, his friend should say the same to him, on the same occasion, of which sort of friends, that carry that sinceritie and plainenesse with them, few are now a dayes to be found, in whom a man may haue that assured confidence, and entire satisfaction.\n\nThen questionlesse (and that with very good reason) a good booke is a good friend; nay I dare boldly say, there cannot be a better. For from thence, we may draw that vtile & necessarium, that good and necessarie counsell, which we stand in need of, without incurring the shame, of that vaine and idle hu∣mour, which is too common now a dayes, to be rather content to continue still in ignorance, then by asking the question, to seeme to doubt of any thing. But to bookes, we may boldly put the question, and neuer need to be afraid, that they will bewray our ignorance: And besides, we shall receiue this satisfaction from them, that they will faithfully, without flatterie, deliuer vs their opinion. And this one aduantage (and it is a notable one) bookes haue of friends: That our friends, dare not alwayes tell vs what they thinke, and know; for feare of particular interest, or out of tendernesse to offend (as we shall by and by briefly tell you) their friends. So soft a hand hath Loue, when it comes to touch, where it loues. Whereas on the contrary, the counsell that is giuen thee in bookes, is downe-right and plaine, and stands before thee starke-naked, as be∣stript of all manner of vice. And therefore (these things considered) it hath euer beene held one of the hardest and difficultest things in the world, to finde out a true and faithfull friend.\n\nOf which sort, many are spoken of in ancient stories, and we finde a great number of them recorded of olde, and painted forth vnto vs in your feigned fables; but that there either now are, or haue beene such heretofore as are there decyphered vnto vs, I doubt it very much, at least I am fully perswaded, they were very rare and few. One only friend haue I found to be true, and is of the same nature and condition, as we are. And this friend of ours, is the best, the bountifullest, the truest, and the faithfullest of all other; for this is neuer wanting to it's friend, but continues firme and constant for euer, nor is at any time weary of giuing: And this good friend of ours, (that I may not hold you any longer in suspence) is the Earth.\n\nThis affords vs pretious stones, gold, siluer, and diuers other mettals, where∣of we stand in need, and so earnestly thirst after. It bringeth forth grasse, and all sorts of herbes, wherewith are not only fed our flocks of sheepe, our cattell, and other beasts for the vse and seruice of man, but those medicinable simples, which conserue our health, free vs from diseases, and if we fall into sicknesse, set vs vpright againe, preseruing this life of ours, in a sound and perfect state of health. It yeeldeth vs all sorts of fruits, that are either sauourie to the taste, or nourishable to the bodie. It giues vs wooll, and flax, and by consequence, all kinde of wouen stuffes, wherewith we cloath, and adorne, this naked flesh of ours. It opens its owne veines of its owne accord, whilest from its f•…•…ll brests, sprout forth those sweet and delicate waters, which we drinke; those brookes\n\ndescription Page 88\n\nand riuers, which get the fields with childe, and make them fruitfull, and not only that, but doth facilitate commerce, and make an easie way for trafficke, bringing the strangest and remotest parts of the world to shake hands, and to communicate their commodities one with another, and to liue in a league of loue and friendship together. Nay more, it is so good, and so sweet a friend, that it suffereth, and willingly consenteth to all that we will our selues. Be shee well or ill vsed by vs, all is one to her, so as we be pleased. Shee is like a sheepe, from whom you shall heare no other language, but Omnia bene: All is well. Leade her forth to feed, or bring her to the waters to drinke; shut, and penne her vp, or let her loose; take her lambkin from her, her milke, her wooll, nay her very life, to all shee alwayes answers bien: all is well. And all that bien, or good that we haue on earth, the Earth giues it vs. And for an vpshot of all, when we are now dead, and lye stinking aboue ground, when there is neither wife, father, sonne, kinsman, nor friend, that will abide and endure our compa∣nie any longer, but doe all of them vtterly forsake vs, and flie from vs; then, euen then, doth not shee refuse vs, but huggs vs, and makes much of vs, and opening her owne wombe, takes vs in vnto her, where we quietly lye, as it were in deposito, till shee render afterwards a faithfull account of what shee hath receiued, and deliuers vs vp to a new and eternall life. And amongst many her other excellencies, one of the worthiest things in her, and deseruing most com∣mendation, is; That shee doing so much for vs, as shee doth, and that so con∣tinually and without ceasing, being so generous, and so franke-hearted, that shee is neuer tyred out, neuer growes weary, yet doth shee not looke for any requitall, shee neither askes, nor expects any returne of kindnesse, nor doth shee talke and tell of it, nortwit thee in the teeth with it; which some kinde of friends, more vsually, then commendably, doe.\n\nAmongst so many friends, as I had, and did daily conuerse withall, I found very few, who had not an eye to the north-starre of their owne proper interest, and shap't their course by the Compasse of their owne priuate ends; hauing only a desire to deceiue, not hauing any respect at all to the friendship they pro∣fest, being devoide of all loue, truth, and shame: I was of an easie and tractable nature, my condition was facile and •…•…pt to be mis-led, their tongue was all ho∣nie, but their heart was very gall it selfe: whose bitternesse, I had too often tasted to my cost.\n\nConsidering therefore the falshood that now adayes is vsed in friendship, and mens craftie and subtle cariage, we are not so much to wonder that we are; as, that we are not deceiued. For I finde them, as liberall in promising, as nig∣gardly in performing; as facile in their words, as difficile in their deeds. There are now no more Pilades, nor Orestes; they are dead and gone; and with them, almost the remembrance, that there were euer any such kinde of men. I only speake this for my Pompeyos sake; whom I therfore condemne the more, for that I lou'd him more then any other, and tooke him to be my especiall friend. For, most of my friends, I gained by my words, but this man, I presum'd I had pur∣chast by my deeds. When I was in my prosperitie, I had many friends, all men did desire my loue, made much of me, feasted me, and did offer their seruice vnto me: But my moneys failing, they also failed; so that their friendship, and my money had an end at once.\n\nAnd as there is no misfortune, that toucheth vs so neere, as to call to minde the happy estate, wherein heretofore we did liue; so there is not any sorrow, that equals that, of being forsaken by those friends, whose loue and friendship we did euer desire to conserue. That little wealth that I had, was stolne from me, which was my vndoing. I continued some dayes (though but a few) in my friends house, how beit he thought them too many; in which short time, he fell off from me by degrees, by a little and a little vnwedging himselfe from me, and vnloosing those knots, which had knit vs in friendship together;\n\ndescription Page 89\n\nfinding at last, that I had but a slipperie eele in my hand, who when I thought I had surest hold of him, slipt when he saw his time from me, leauing my hand empty. He was a Cordouese, in the freenesse of his offers; and would say vnto me after that we had dined; Sir, is there any thing else, that you would be pleased to command? If there be, I pray Sir make as bold of any thing this house affords, as if it were your owne. But these were but generall words, and matter of complement; for he went not vpon certainties, nor promised me any thing, that I might trust vnto, but did rather seeme to proffer this his kind∣nesse doubtfully and fearefully, lest I might chance to take him at his word. And that little curtesie, which he shewed me, was not so much out of any hearty good will, that he had to doe it, as for feare lest I should seeke to recouer my lost goods of him, by course ofLaw.\n\nI read his thoughts in his lookes: And as mine were alwayes noble, so on the contrary, his were base and vile. And as oft as he spake of my losse, if he vsed any complement with me, it was all dissimulation, and counterset stuffe. Well, whatsoeuer it were, either better or worse, I was much offended at it, and thought that he did me therein a great deale of wrong, and did seriously risent this his double dealing, and these faire but false showes of his loue. But he, on the other side, did as earnestly persist in the pursuit of his simulations, as if he had meant nothing lesse, then to play vpon me, and abuse me; or as if they had some ground of truth with them: And because I stoutly stood to it, and bore out this businesse as well as I could, that he might not perceiue any de∣iectednesse in me, he tooke heart thereupon, and made sleight of it, as a matter of little, or no importance. For the losse was mine, and not his; and there∣fore he made the lesse reckoning of it.\n\nWherefore, that I might not giue him farther trouble, perceiuing how much perplexed he was, and how willing to be rid of me, I resolued with my selfe to free him of that feare, and to goe for Florence. I imparted this my pur∣pose vnto him, telling him, that I much desired to see that Citie, for the great commendation, that I had heard of it, and those famous sights that were there to be seene. And because this my determination suted with his desire, he tooke hold on this occasion, relating vnto me many memorable things, worthy my sight, wherewith my will was the more inflamed, and the desire which I had to see it, much increased. But he did not doe this so much, to commend it vnto me, or out of any good desire, that he had, that I should see it, but only that he might see me no more in his house; and for that he is an vnwelcome guest, that is a mans guest against his will. After that I had thus broken my minde vnto him, he began to blow the winde afresh of his kinde vsage of me, that he might oblige me thereby to get me the sooner out of his house, and to depart from thence peaceably and quietly; for he was not a little afraid of me. He then signified vnto me, how sorry he was that I would needs be gone; but vsed no intreaties, nor any the least resistance, to haue me to stay. He deman∣ded of me, when I was minded to begin my iourney, but neuer asked, what I wanted; which he might haue done out of good manners, though he had no meaning to pleasure me. Which proffer, had he made it me, it should not haue beene performed by him so much out of complement and ceremonie, as that he might thereby learne, how long, or how little a while I meant to stay with him, not knowing as yet the houre, when I me•…•…nt to be gone. It is an easie thing, to see; more easie, to speake; but it is a hard thing to fore-see. For all that see, doe not know; and all that speake, doe not doe. And for that he now saw, that he should haue no farther need of me, for that I like a foole, told him ere I was aware, that I was not minded to returne any more to Rome, he began to cast with himselfe, What good can this cocks-combe doe me now? or of what vse and profit will this foole be vnto me hereafter? And so from that time forward, he vsed me accordingly, which was no worse, then\n\ndescription Page 90\n\nmine owne indiscretion deserued. Then did I learne to my cost, how a man may come to know a generous and noble minde; which is seene in nothing more then in a thankfull acknowledgment of benefits already receiued.\n\nIn this alteration of fortune, there were set before mine eyes a thousand dangers, that I neuer dream't of. But because I had as yet so much spirit left me, as was able to put me forward, I was not vtterly dismaid, nor quite dishartned. I studied to forget that, which I could not helpe; making my meanes, the thinking on my iourney. And because noueltie, and things of a strange na∣ture, doe draw the mindes of men after them, out of the desire that they haue to know them, I made all the haste I could to get me gone from Siena, as well out of this respect, as also that I might leaue Pompeyo well pleased therewith; who, I knew, would neuer thinke himselfe well at ease, till he were well eased of me. For albeit men commonly say to their guests; I pray fall to your meat, and be merry, for I assure you, you are heartily welcome; yet whether you be merry, or not merry, welcome, or not welcome, they thinke you are bound vnto them for a meales meat, and put euery morsell to account, that goes downe thy threat.\n\nThis hoggishnesse of his, this his vnciuill cariage, this dissembled care of his, and this his great feare that he had, that I would continue longer with him, did much trouble me. Well, I tooke my leaue of him; and because I was still the same man, as I was wont to be, as also in regard of that loue and friend∣ship, which I truly bore vnto him, at the time of this our departure each from other, I did so grieue thereat, that I was not able to speake a word, no not so much as to bid him, farewell; yet could not this my inward sorrow, draw so much as one teare into his eyes, or to make any the least show of griefe. And so all alone, I set forward on my iourney, but more then well accompanied with a world of melancholy thoughts, nor slightly attended by a multitude of cares, wherewith I was so ouer-laden, that my horse was ready to sinke vnder me, as vnable to beare so great a burthen. And therefore I rode plotting and deuising with my selfe, how I might make them lighter, and so case both my selfe and my horse of them.\n\nI had not gone thus musing many miles, but it was my hap to light on Saya∣vedra, who had left Siena to cumply with his banishment. Whom I no sooner saw, but my kinde heart began to melt, and I could not chuse but take com∣passion of him, and withall I must needs salute him; placing my eyes, not vpon the hurt, which he had done me, but on the harme, from which he once had freed me. Esteeming more of that kindnesse I then receiued from him, then of all that, that he had rob'd me of. And he is a bad pay-master, and doth ill deserue a curtesie, who doth not with aduantage requite a receiued kindnesse. Besides; Liberalitie, supposeth a generous and noble spirit, and is of that high esteeme, for that it is originally descended from heauen, that it is alwayes found in those mindes, that are destinated thereunto. I could not for my life refraine from speaking louingly vnto him, nor he abstaine from receiuing me with teares, which guttring downe his cheekes, dropt downe vpon my feet, as he bowed him-selfe to kisse my stirrop, whereof he taking fast hold, fell downe on his knees, crauing pardon for this his error, humbly and earnestly beseeching me, that I would be pleased to forgiue him; rendring me likewise thanks, that during the time of his imprisonment, I neuer offred to accuse him; excusing himselfe also, that he had not, as soone as he was set at libertie, come to visit me, laying the fault thereof, in his lacke of boldnesse, and the largenesse of his offence. Yet, for to make satisfaction and payment of this his debt, he would become my slaue, and doe me faithfull seruice all the dayes of his life; I, who euer knew him to be a man, that had both a strong braine, and a nimble wit, which d•…•… him rather hurt, then good, because he did not well imploy them; yet, for that these did adapt him, and make him fit for any imployment what∣soeuer,\n\ndescription Page 91\n\nI was the more willing to accept of his offer. And so taking him into my seruice, we ioggd on along by little and little like a couple of good fel∣lowes, talking of diuers things on the way.\n\nAnd albeit I was not ignorant, that he was a notorious theefe, and a notable cunning rogue, yet I held it the lesser inconuenience of the two, to haue a knaue, then a foole, to my man. For foolishnesse did neuer yet but walke hand in hand with wickednesse. And both of them being ioyned together, are suffi∣cient to vndoe not only a priuate house, but a whole Common-wealth. For the simple, or foolish man, cannot keepe counsell, nor knowes when and where to hold his peace; nor the wicked and malitious man, to iudge of things a•…•…ght; and if either of them, vttereth what he thinketh, (for commonly their tongue blabbeth, what their heart conceiueth) scandals, and troubles are already en∣tred within the doores of our house, and like impudent rogues, sticke not to presse into our priuatest roomes, to see what they can get from thence. I thought with my selfe, if I would haue any one to serue me, (good seruants being so few, and so hard to be got) that this would be lesse b•…•…d then any other, because by those his cunning tricks, that he had plaid with me already, he made me the more warie of him, and taught me (•…•…s if I had beene some La∣cedemonian) to throw my beard ouer my shoulder: that is, to haue an eye vnto him, and to be the more circumspect and warie of him, and to take the better heed, looking still behinde me, as those doe that haue enemies, turning their head one while this way, another while that, that they may not be set vpon vn-awares. And therefore knowing him so well as I did, I thought it as good, if not better, to entertaine a knaue that I knew, as a knaue, that I knew not. For I knew well enough, that I must looke narrowly to his water, and watch him at euery turne, wherein I meant not to be negligent: Whereas, in taking of another, that should seeme to beare the face of an honest man, and make show of being faithfull and trustie vnto me, I might haply grow carelesse out of the confidence that I haue in him, and by this my credulitie be coozened of all that I had, and afterwards be left to looke after moone-shine in the water.\n\nAs well in this respect, as also for that I had not much now to lose, nor was my condition or qualitie such, that I should stand so nicely vpon these points, I admitted him into my seruice. He askt me (as soone as I had entertained him) which way I meant to take? I told him, I was for Florence, led thither out of a desire that I had to satisfie my longing, by seeing that Citie, whereof I had heard •…•…o much. Whereunto my seruant replied, and said; Sir, whatsoeuer you haue heard thereof, I make no question, when you come there, but your selfe will confesse, report hath beene too short with you. For I assure you, there are so many admirable things therein to be seene, that they cannot suffi∣ciently be commended. For the naked relations of things, that are curious and good indeed, neuer fill the vacuitie and emptinesse of our desires. I haue liued there some time, yet all the while as I remained there, as if I had beene but come that very day to towne, wheresoeuer I went, new things were still offered to my view: and I would neuer with my good will haue left that Towne, if my friends had not forced me from thence.\n\nI began to aske him some questions, touching the foundation of that Citie, and whence it had its first beginning? Sir (said he) seeing we haue day enough before vs, and that we may talke and walke faire and softly, and that the rela∣tion, which I am to make you is but short; I shall, for the better satisfying of vour desire, acquaint you, and that truly, with all those curiosities, that did then offer them-selues vnto my knowledge.\n\nThen did he forth with begin to discourse of those ciuill warres, which were occasioned by Catiline, betweene those of Fiesole, and Florence; the o•…•…er∣throwes, which one while those of the Romane faction receiued, another while their enemie, Bela Totile. How in the time of Pope Leo the third, the Emperor\n\ndescription Page 92\n\nCharles the Great, sent a great Armie against the Fiesolani, leauing Florence re∣edified in the hands of the Florentines, till that Pope Clement the seuenth, and the Emperor Charles the fifth recouered the same, for to restore it to its ancient possession, from which the house of the Medics had beene put out. Which suc∣ceeded in the yeere of our Lord, 1529. Euer since which time, the Florentines haue alwaies been gouerned by one sole Prince; which, though it seemed some∣what harsh vnto them at the first, yet now they see their error, and finde now at length how much more quietly they liue vnder the protection of their owne Prince, and with how much more safetie, both of their liues and goods. It is said, that the first Prince, that euer they had, was Alessandro de Medici; who, for his sweetnesse of nature, his magnanimitie, and valour, though violently he lost that principalitie in the very flower of his youth, yet might he justly be termed Alessandro. After him, succeeded, that wise, and worthy Cosimo, great Duke of Tuscanie, whose memoriall, for his heroicall actions, and great ver∣tues, as also for his courteous behauiour, his religion, and good gouernment, shall liue eternally in the mindes of the liuing. This Prince was succeeded by Francesco, who, for that he died without issue, the Crowne came to that fa∣mous Ferdinando his brother, the liuely image, and true picture of his father Cosimo, being as well heire to his Vertues, as his Estate. Who gouerned so wor∣thily, and so wisely, that I doe not know any other, with whom I may equall him, for the loue that his subiects bare him.\n\nIf th•…•… relation, he then made me, had beene a little longer, he must of force haue deferr'd it till the next day; but it seemed, that he had measured it out iust with the time: for we were come as neere night, as we were to our Inne•…•… whereinto we went to lodge. And hauing there well rested and refresht our selues, we got vp betimes in the morning, and that we might the sooner get into Florence, we did set the best foot before, and made a little more haste, then otherwise we would haue done. But when we came within sight of it, I was so ouer-ioyed, that I am not able to expresse it, so faire and so beautifull did it a farre of present it selfe vnto me. For though I could not take a full view of it, yet from the one end to the other, and from almost the bottome to the top, I might reasonably well discerne it; and a more pleasing sight, did mine eyes neuer see. I did examine the pleasantnesse of its situation, I beheld the beauty of many great and goodly buildings, the inexpugnable strength of its stately walls, the maiestie, and firmnesse of its high, and well formed Towers. In a word, the whole pile thereof, seemed such vnto me, that I stood amazed at it, and could not (me thought) too much admire it. I would not willingly, haue mou'd out of the place where I stood, nor haue drawne neerer to the Towne, but haue kept my selfe at that very distance; as well, for that mine eye was wonderfull well pleased therewith, as also for that I would not wrong that de∣light, which I now receiued, when I should draw neerer thereunto; if perad∣uenture (as it vsually falleth out with most things) it should lessen it selfe, and fall short of that goodly prospect, which I did here enjoy.\n\nBut, when I did consider with my selfe, that all this glorious show, was, but as it were the outward case of it, my iudgement did then begin to instruct me, that the iewels therein contained, must needs be richer, and faire more glori∣ous, as indeed they were. For, when I was entred thereinto, and saw the spa∣tiousnesse of the streets, how streight and leuell they were, how plaine and smooth, paued all with cleane hewen stones of goodly faire marble, and their houses built with beautifull stones, so costly, so curious, so nearly polished, so artificially wrought, and with such a deale of skill and cunning, in the archi∣tecture thereof, I was so confounded, that I could not tell what to thinke of it. For I could not imagine with my selfe, that any other Citie in the world, could haue compar'd with Rome for beauty: But hauing well viewd this, for its bignesse, it goes farre beyond it. For those buildings that are in Rome, the\n\ndescription Page 93\n\nbest of them are gone to ruine, and few of them left standing; and those that are now remaining, are but meere shadowes, and the very ruines and fragments of those, that were so famous in former times. But Florence, is the flower of the world, all is therein so flourishing, so costly, and so well set forth, that I said vn∣to Sayavedra; Certainly, if the inhabitants of this Citie be as curious in the tricking of their women, as they are in the adorning, and beautifying of their houses, they are vndoubtedly the happiest men in the world. I was so strucken with admiration, that I was desirous to haue dwelt a long time in contempla∣ting and beholding euery particular peece of building; but because night was now growing on, and that the day would not befriend vs any longer, I was faine to retire my selfe to my lodging. And we were not slacke in hastning to our Inne, whither when we were come, we were so neatly and so daintily en∣tertained, that I cannot so much indeare it, as it truly deserueth. Such plenty of prouision, such cleanlinesse in their lodging-chambers, such sweetnesse in their linnen, such diligent attendance, such affable language, and such good vsage, did I neuer meet withall else-where in all my life. I was so taken there∣with, that it made me almost to forget that which I most desired. I slept so soundly that night (thankes to the good bed, that was vnder me) that it see∣med vnto me scarce halfe an houre, since my first lying downe.\n\nWhen the morning was come, (though with a heart full of sorrow, for that was then my Mount Tabor) I call'd to Sayauedra, to giue me my clothes; and for that he was so well acquainted with that Citie, I will'd him to make him∣selfe ready to goe along with me, that he might show me all, whatsoeuer was of any note, and held (as curiosities) to be worth the seeing. And that first of all he should bring me to the chiefe Church, where hauing heard diuine ser∣uice, and recommended our selues vnto God, all things would prosper after∣wards the better with vs. Thither he led me, and hauing ended our deuotion, I stood like one amaz'd in beholding that most famous Temple and fabricke del Zimborio, which they there call Cupula, which in my opinion, may be better termed Copula, for that it seemed not only to my selfe, but as many as beheld it, that therein was copulated, and ioyned as it were together, all that curious Architecture, which the writings of the best and skilfullest professors, in that profession, either theoricke, or practicke, haue published to the world, so admirable a peece of workmanship, such a deale of greatnesse, strength, and cu∣riositie, (without any wrong or iniurie to any other fabricke of Europe) may iustly challenge the name of the eighth wonder of the world. Let him consider with himselfe, who hath any knowledge in Architecture, it being foure hun∣dred and twenty handfuls high, besides the spire that is on the top of it, what diameter, this Cupula will require; and by this he may come to guesse, what manner of thing it is.\n\nFrom thence I went to the Annunciata, a Church so called, to see the image, that was painted there vpon the wall, which might more properly be termed Heauen; so admirable a peece of worke, is that picture of the Incar∣nation of the Sonne of God: Insomuch that it is held there for certaine, that it was drawne by one, that was no lesse excellent in his Art, then holy in his life. For, when he had made an end of that which there you see painted, and that there remained no more to be done, but to finish and make vp the face of our blessed Lady the Virgin; being wonderfull timerous and fearefull, much misdoubting and musing with himselfe, whether or no, he should be able to giue it its true life, and to fit it euery way in its age, in truenesse of its colour, its complexion, in its honest and sober countenance, and in the demure and modest posture of its eyes, in this confusion of his, and these his distracted thoughts, not deui∣sing with himselfe, what he were best to doe, he laid himselfe downe a while to sleepe, and awaking anon after, and minding to betake him to his pensill, and to put his hand (by the helpe of God) to the peece of worke, he found it\n\ndescription Page 94\n\nmade to his hand. And therefore, it needs not our farther commendation, for it being to be presupposed, that it was there miraculously wrought either by Gods owne hand, or some one of his Angels, it can be said to be no lesse, then an Angelicall picture. And for this cause, the rest of that peece being conside∣red, which the Painter made, we may easily conceiue, what kinde of spirit he had, who could finde so much fauour, as to haue the hands of heauen (as if for the time, they had beene bound prentises to his Trade) to helpe him to grinde and mixe his colours, and to make an end of his worke for him.\n\nSo many miracles doth it daily worke, such a concourse of people doth con∣tinually flocke thither out of deuotion, and so great are the almes, that are there distributed & giuen to the poore, that I did much wonder, that all the beggars were not wondrous rich; which put me in minde of that poore man, who (as I was told, and you haue heard) made in this Citie, that his famous last Will and Testament, wherein he bequeathed his Asses pack-saddle to the Great Duke; That seeming now vnto me but a little small summe, in comparison of that, which such a one as he, might very well haue gained in that place. And for that it is a knowne truth, Que el hijo de la gata, ratones mata: That the sonne of a Cat, will kill his Rat. Or (as our English Prouerbe hath it) Cat will to his kinde; a thousand, and a thousand times, did I bethinke my selfe of many things that I had done in my younger dayes, and did now as it were plainely perceiue; that if, as I went to Rome, it had beene my good hap to haue lighted in this Citie, what with my roguish tricks, my counterfeit scurffs, leprosies, and fore legs, I might haue come to be a mayorazgo amongst them, and to haue pur∣chased some great Lordship.\n\nI did likewise obserue, that few of these rogues, were curious, and cunning, or that they were their crafts-masters; but were, for the most part, fooles, meere block-heads, and had little or no wit at all, in comparison of those in my time. And when I did perceiue, what poore counterfeits they were, and how sillily they did order their affaires, it was sport alone to me. I tooke a great deale of pleasure in looking on them, and I did secretly wish to my selfe, that I might haue had the opportunitie, to reforme a thousand imperfections, which I pre∣sently saw in them. Who did euer see, that an honest poore beggar, that was a good proficient in his trade, nay, say he were neuer so meanely bred to it, would when he had most, (vnlesse he were a very cocks-combe) haue more then six, or seuen Maranedis, or some such like trifle, and not about, in his hat? nor to haue such a summe of money lie open to the peoples eye, that they may thereby be taught to tell him; you need no more, you haue as much there al∣ready, as will very well serue to supply your wants for this day, and to put bread enough in your belly; and therefore, that he should get him gone, and giue way to other poore folkes, that had more need, then he had? When was it euer knowne, that there was euer seene any beggar, of that poore vnderstan∣ding, though he were but a new beginner, that would beg, hauing a loafe of bread vnder his arme? or to stand, as I saw another, with a tooth-pick in his care? Which I no sooner saw, but I said to my selfe: O thou poore silly theefe, thou traitor to thy profession; Art thou such an Asse, as to let euery man know, that thou hast eaten so much, that there are some remnants yet left be∣hinde in thy teeth? I saw not one amongst them all, that could play his game handsomely, nay scarce know how to set his men in their right place, nor to take their due time for the hitting of a blot; I saw no order, no decorum amongst them; they had no skill in this kinde of musicke; many of them could say their Gammoothe, (and that too they had learned by rote) but knew not how to proue a note; others there were, that had a little paltry skill in plaine-song, but would bawle it out so scuruily and so vntuneably, that no care was able to endure it: And none of all this dunghill crew, that like Chaunti∣cleere, could chaunt it out lustily, descant and diuide at pleasure, and so to\n\ndescription Page 95\n\nrelish and melt their notes, as to make their hearts to melt that heare them, and to moue them to compassion of them.\n\nThere did I spie a young man, one of my old acquaintance, who was now a pretty well-growne man; this was the only beggar (I meane compared with the rest) that knew any thing amongst them. And would to God (thought I) that I might be so happy, as to come once to set my hands, where he had set his heart. For questionlesse, he could not chuse but be rich. He was the sonne of such parents, as were able to leaue him much. His father was a notable cun∣ning rogue, and could his craft wonderfull well. And this his sonne, was euery way like vnto him. He was leane visag'd, lanke bellied, spindle-shank'd, and so alike suted in all the rest, that a man might truly say of him; That, t'was fathers n'owne sonne. But because euery thing hath its time appointed, and takes it course when it comes, and for that the Iustice did not there permit, the ha∣uing of an Academie, for the trayning vp of these fresh men, what through want of exercise, and not trying of conclusions, and putting them in practise, they may now throw away their caps, whilest themselues with their breviaticke Art, may lie wallowing in the durt. I knew him, but he did not know me: He might well say vnto me, Tal•…•…e veo, que no te conosco: The world is so changed with thee, that I doe not know thee. O, what a terrible conflict had I with my selfe, what a shrewd temptation, to goe and speake to him: but I durst not. I said to Sayavedra; Seest thou that poore fellow? That rogue is able to make me rich. He then said vnto me; Why doth he then goe a begging? I told him; When men haue once begun to open their mouthes to craue an almes, and haue shut their eyes to all shame, and bound their hands from all labour, and that their feet are benum'd, and wax stiffe from taking any paines, or care to liue in a lawfull course, their disease is beyond all cure, and there is no remedie to redresse this euill.\n\nThe experience whereof I saw in a poore young wench in my time, who comming to Rome poore and sicke, fell a begging for Gods sake. And when shee was well recouer'd of her health, and as strong of her bodie, as any bull, shee still continued her trade of begging. They, whose almes shee craued, told her, it was shame for her to beg, shee was young, and lustie, and was able to serue, and worke for her liuing. Shee answered; that shee was often troubled with a cruell paine and griping of the heart, which when the fitt tooke her, caused her to fall downe to the ground in a swound, beating her feet and her hands against the earth, renting and tearing all that shee could lay hand on, and kick∣ing and spurning at those that came neere her. In this sort, did shee cozen the world a long time, and spent many yeeres in this lewd fashion, till at last one of her owne Countrymen being askt, whether he knew her father, and her mother? Answered, He did; And that they were both dead, and had left her a great deale of wealth. Whereunto (as lawfull Inheretrix) shee laid claime. Whose estate was now such, and so great, that many principall men became Sutors vnto her, and sought to haue her to wife, and some of them exceeding rich (for there is no yron so foule, that it will not be guilded; gold hides and couers all, be it neuer so rustie) shee was penny-white (as we say) and so was married in the end to one of an honest condition, and well to liue, and an hand∣some man withall. But this wife of his, seeing shee was now depriued of her wonted libertie of begging, grew within a little while after desperately sicke, daily withering and wasting away, the Physitians not being able to search into the nature of her disease. And thus shee continued for a good while, till shee be∣came her owne physitian, and cured her selfe, by playing the hypocrite, making solemne profession, that meerely out of humilitie, shee would goe a begging, and eat not any thing, but what should be giuen her of almes, wherewith shee would sustaine this sinfull carkasse of hers. And to this end, would she go vp and downe her house amongst her seruants, first to one, and then to another, crauing\n\ndescription Page 96\n\nand begging some thing of them. And because all did giue her almes, and none denie her, that did not fully please her, but did much trouble her; where∣fore, oftentimes, shee would steale vp into a priuate roome that shee had, and there shut her selfe in, where shee had some pictures of certaine great persons, that were fairely hung vp in frames, and euen of these (to satisfie this her ill habit, and to keepe her selfe in vre) would shee likewise demand an almes.\n\nSayavedra, maruelled much at it; Who brought me from thence, to the outward Court belonging to the Palace; in the midst whereof I might see a braue Prince, mounted vpon a beautifull horse of brasse, so curiously cut to the life, and so well proportioned in euery part, that they both seemed to haue life and motion. My apprehension, could not discerne, and therefore durst not pre∣sume to iudge, which of the two were better, either this, or that at Rome; yet inclined in the end with that short vnderstanding of mine, to giue the praise to that which was there present; not for that it was present, but because it did de∣serue it. I askt of Sayavedra, whose statua that was? He told me, it was the great Dukes, Cosimo de Medici. Of whom I went discoursing vnto you vpon the way. And here, great Ferdinando, his sonne, (who lately was, but is not now aliue) caused it to be set vp to perpetuall memorie. I would needs know out of curiositie, of what height it might be, and not being able to reach thereunto to take the measure of it, I was informed, that from the very bottome to the top, was about some fiftie handfuls high, little more, or lesse. Round about the said place, were many other delicate peeces cast in brasse, and some, of substantiall, yet very fine marble, so artificially wrought, that they did driue the beholders into great admiration; leauing euen the best iudgements in suspense, and stag∣gering those wits most, that were most acute; excepting only such, as had some inckling afore-hand, what manner of things they were.\n\nAfterwards, we visited the Temple of S. Iohn Baptist, as being most worthy our particular remembrance; for I may truly say of it, that there is scarse the like in the world for all in all. Which glorious fabricke, I then learned, was founded in the time of Octauianus Augustus the Emperor, and consecrated to Mars. There did I entertaine my selfe in obseruing its antiquitie, and foun∣dation, wherein I tooke much content; and the more, for that it is reported of it, and receiued by tradition, as also grounded vpon reason, (in regard of its foundation) That it is to last and continue, to the finall consummation and end of the world. Which we may the rather be induced to beleeue, for that neither length of time, nor those continuall warres, accompanied with so many calamities, haue as yet had the power either to deface, or destroy it. All the Citie besides being left desolate and laid leuell with the ground, only this Temple remaining still vntoucht. The bodie of it, consists of eight angles, all spatious, strong, and maruellous beautifull to behold; especially those its three great doores, which are shut vp with six halfe doores, all of brasse, cast in curious molds, and all of one entire peece, wrought with Histories of embossed worke, so daintily handled, so finely raised, and so proportionably equall in euery point, as may well be presumed from the Artizans of that Citie, who beare away the bell from all the rest, in that kinde, that are in the world.\n\nThis Temple hath likewise another greatnesse belonging vnto it, which is this; That there being in Florence one and forty Parish Churches, two and twenty Monasteries of Fryars, forty and seuen Nunneries, foure Colledges or Houses for those that are willing to retire themselues from the world, eight and twenty Hospitals, and two bearing the name of IESVS; yet there is no baptisme vsed in any of these, saue only in that of S. Iohn, and in that Church, are all the children of this Citie baptized, from the meanest amongst the com∣mons, to the principall Gentlemen, and the great Dukes owne children. For that time, that we stayed there, we visited all the Churches-one after another, which were of that admirable workmanship, and set forth with such singular\n\ndescription Page 97\n\nand rare curiosities, that it is not possible to relate no not the least part thereof, in regard of the muchnesse of them, (the number of them being so infinite,) nor is the vnderstanding capable of apprehending them, much lesse our out∣ward eye. For he that should goe about to make a memoriall of so great a Ma∣china, and such a masse of things, whose admirable parts are so numberlesse, and euery one of them accompanied with sundry peeces of such singular Art, and exquisite workemanship, besides so many excellent pictures, some in tables, and some ingrauen in brasse, and other mettals, had need to make thereof a huge great Volume, and to seeke out some other Chronicler, that shall be bet∣ter able then my selfe, to present these things to the eyes of the Reader, and to giue them their due commendation.\n\nThe great Duke, hath a Palace in the Citie, which is called Il Palaggio de Piti; whose excellencies, greatnesses, and curiosities, as well in gardens, as fountaines, mounts, groues, sports for hunting, and goodly roomes, may (with∣out indearing) be truly said to be a princely and royall seat; and such a one, as may compare with any other whatsoeuer in all Europe.\n\nI would not omit to know and see the circuit of this Citie, which contai∣neth in it such store of wealth. And I found it to be much about fiue mile com∣passe: it hath ten great Gates, and one and fifty Towers. The Citie is seated all within the walls, and hath no suburbs adioyning thereunto. Through the midst of it passeth the famous riuer of Arnus, vpon which stand foure most stately bridges, all pau'd with stone, and very strongly built, being large and spatious withall. And all these things, being thus done in perfection; the like perfe∣ction is also to be found in their gouernment, their behauiour, and in the gene∣rall fashion, and cariage of that people. And therefore iustly, and with a great deale •…•…son, is this Citie called Florencia, as being flos florum, the flower of flowers, and as it were the only nose-gay of all Italie. Wherein all things, as in a curious garden, doe flourish ioyntly together, but more particularly these especiall and singular good things; As the liberall Arts, horsemanship, all kinde of learning, militarie discipline, true dealing, faire proceeding, sweet be∣hauiour, plainenesse and sinceritie in their actions, and aboue all I must recom∣mend vnto thee, their loue and kindnesse towards strangers. Shee like a true mother, imbraces them in her bosome, huggs them, makes much of them, and fauours them more, then shee doth her owne children; to whom, in respect of them, shee may be termed a mother in law.\n\nThe time, that I stayed there, I came to know the Causes by their Effects: to wit, by knowing the nature and condition of the inhabitants, and the poli∣ticke lawes, by which they were gouerned, and their due obseruation of them, not erring a tittle from them. There they apply themselues truly to know and esteeme euery mans merits, rewarding them with iust and due honours; to the end that all may be incouraged to vertue. And let not Princes thinke it a small glory vnto them, for they ought to acknowledge it for one of the greatest, that can be giuen them, when it is truly said of them, that their noble and renowned actions, doe iumpe and concurre with those of their subiects.\n\nI likewise knew that to be true, which Sayavedra had told me about the fa∣ctions in Court, and the crossing and thwarting one another. I saw somewhat of that, which did exceed in other places, as Enuie, and Flatterie, whereof no Princes Court is free, which alwayes raigne there most, where is desire of s•…•…our, but more especially, when they labour to increase it, and to keepe themselues in grace with their Soueraigne. Which oftentimes turne to the great hurt of both the one and the other. They are fine and witty re∣lators of other mens actions, and subtle Mathematicians, for to delineate and measure out that which other men can doe, and sometime that, which others cannot. But let these things rest, without farther entring into them. For hauing painted forth vnto you, in so great a perfection,\n\ndescription Page 98\n\nthis illustrious and noble Citie, it is not fit that I should blemish it with so foule a blot, and dash as it were with a cole, that faire commendation, that I haue giuen it.\n\nCHAP. II.\n\nGuzman de Alfarache goes to Bologna in pursuit of Alexandro, who had stolne his trunkes from him; Whither, when he was come, going about to imprison Alexan∣dro, himselfe was clapt vp.\n\nIN Florence, I did eat out that horse, which my Lord Em∣bassador had bestowed on me at my departure, and made me one mor•…•…g a breakfast of his shooes. I say; To the end I might •…•…ell him the better, I caused him to be new shod, giuing order to Sayavedra to make money of the old ones; whereof we made our breakfast. If this here∣tike, Necessitie, had not kickt me out of Towne, and thrust me out by head and shoulders, I should neuer while I liu'd, of mine owne ac∣cord, haue gone from thence. And this thou maist as certainly beleeue of me, as of any one Article of thy Creed. For I had now well taken salt, and was throughly seasoned, and had sounded that Citie to the very bottome, yet I know not, how my minde might haue altered, and what I should haue done hereafter. For in conclusion, todo lo nueuo, aplaze: See what is newest, that we still like best. This rule, holding more especially in such as I was, who had spiritum ambulatorium, a wandring humour of mine owne, and was a great lo∣uer of nouelties. But then I was of that opinion, for those many reasons I had on my side. For it was my hap to come thither, when they were full of their sports and pastimes; and other young fellowes of the same yeeres with my selfe, led me to these their delightfull pleasures along with them from house to house, from feast to feast, and from bridall to bridall.\n\nIn one house you might finde them dancing; in another, playing vpon in∣struments; in a third, singing; and in a fourth, making merry with their friends. All was delight, and more and more delight still; one sets vp his rest at Primera, another vyes his game at Tic-Tack: some at one game, some at ano∣ther. In a word, in all places of the Citie wheresoeuer we came, we met with nothing, but laudable exercises, and honest recreations. There might a man see many young gallants, pompous in apparell, and richly clad, and many faire Ladies, and hansome Gentlewomen, who wanted no setting forth for curious and costly dressings, with whom these young blouds did dance. Whose tyres on their heads were so daintily adorned, their gownes on their backs so richly imbroydered, and their Chapine•…•… •…•…o their feet, so plated with siluer, and beset with pretious stones, that they did rauish both the eyes, and the soules of as many as did looke vpon them. I leaue it therefore to thee to consider, what kinde of dressings those were, that had so much power to moue the beholders. See how I haue seasoned this dish, that I may not disgrace the goodnesse of the meat. Tell me; hath it not a good rellish? is it not pleasing to thy palate? Though I goe not into a Tauerne to drinke, yet I take delight to talke of it, and to looke vpon it, and to peepe in at the doore as I passe by, and sometimes slip in, to make my selfe merry. No man is wise on horsebacke; much lesse, in the vnbridled yeeres of his youth. In a word, I was young. And as old age is cold, and dry, so on the contrary, youth, is hot, and moyst. Youth, hath strength, and old age, wisdome. Thus are these gifts diuided, and yet euery one hath that which is fit, and necessarie for him. And though for the most part, we see that all old men turne to be young, if not (as we say) become children againe; yet\n\ndescription Page 99\n\nit were a wonder, to see young men grow old. And I say againe, it were as great a wonder, to see a young man in yeares, to be an old man in discretion, as to see a Peare tree, to beare fruits in the heart of winter. But I speake this in Spanish, that some of other Countries, whom I know, may not finde fault with me. And I would haue all men take notice, that I alwayes speake according to the vse and fashion of mine owne Country: for I doe not know after what manner others dance in theirs.\n\nBut that I may returne to my former discourse; it grieued me very much to leaue Florence, (yet did it much concerne me to be gone) flying as it were from my selfe, not knowing to what end, nor whither to goe; nor yet knew I, why I should stay any longer there, vnlesse it were to spend that poore little store of money, that I had yet left me, and that chaine, which the Lord Embassador my master, gaue me at my farewell as a token of his loue, and to thinke vpon him, as oft as I chanc'd to cast mine eyes vpon 〈◊〉〈◊〉 And I must truly confesse vnto you, that he was neuer out of my minde, •…•…ensoeuer I did thinke vpon that houre, wherein I must ere long be forced to•…•…rne it into money. And as it was giuen me with a great deale of loue, so did it exceedingly grieue me that I must shortly part so vnkindly with it. I would, if I could, haue kept it rather then my life, and neuer haue parted from it; but there are some such occasions, wherein parents may impawne their owne children. Patience, (quoth I to my selfe) I will doe the best I can; and more, I can not. And therefore (my ma∣sters) I pray pardon me; for he, that hath no other meanes to helpe him-selfe, and is constrained thereunto out of meere necessitie, is driuen many times to commit many a greater error, and that shall proue farre more preiudiciall and hartfull. I had a great wrestling and strugling with my selfe; and my thoughts had a cruell sharpe warre with themselues, as well touching this, as other the like businesses. I considered with my selfe, what would now become of me, and what course I were best to take, for to supply and releeue my wants. God helpe me; How heauy is the heart, when the purse is light! And therefore we say; A heauy purse, makes a light heart. What little comfort doe we take in the world? And how faint and feeble, are the pleasures of this life to him, whose purse strings are too weake? And more particularly, to one that is in a strange Country, and that hath put on a resolution with him-selfe to forget his lewd courses, and not to liue, as he had done, by tricks and by shifts; yet not know∣ing how to gaine a penny, and wanting the meanes, how to come by money; hauing no neere acquaintance with any, to presume of such kindnesse from them, being farre from my friends, and farther from any the least intention or purpose to cheat or cozen any man. For, if I would haue runne that course, and set my minde vnto it, I needed not to haue taken such a deale of care and trou∣ble in the businesse. For I had my 〈◊〉〈◊〉 about me; and a hand, that was able to finde me worke all the yeare long; I could not want, (if I listed my selfe) to picke out a liuing where-soeuer I should come. For (thanks be to God for it) what I had once learned, it was mine owne for euer: I neuer lost it, if I once had it. Only, I might at first be a little to seeke, for want of vse, but the tooles of my trade were neuer out of my hand, but alwayes carried them with me, whither-soeuer I went. I departed from Rome with a full purpose to become an honest man; and fall backe, fall edge, come good, or come bad, all welcome, as it pleas'd God; for I had a great minde to continue these my good desires, and t•…•…remaine firme in this so honest a resolution. But seeing, that Hell is full of these, what good could my holy deliberations doe me, if I did not put them in execution? For f•…•… without workes, is but a dead faith.\n\nNow, I had gotten me a man to waite vpon me; Where by the way, I pray let me aske you, what a good direction this was, to addresse me to a Master? What a Letter of recommendation to bee receiued into seruice? I had beene now accustomed to command; how would you then, that I should submit my\n\ndescription Page 100\n\nselfe to obey? I verily thought with my selfe (as perhaps many moe doe, for I doe not thinke that I am the onely man of that minde in the world) that I should haue beene an honest man, if answerable to that glorious show that I made, and the height whereat I liu'd, I had had wherewithall to spend accor∣dingly, and that I had not wanted meanes to vphold this great spirit of mine, but had had money enough to maintaine and inlarge my generous disposition. But the summes (I feare me) which must haue seru'd to supply my wants, must miraculously by some holy Saint or other, be subministred vnto mee: for no other hand could doe it. And certainly, I know not how it then fell out, that I was so honest, as I was; I verily beleeue, that this also was a Miracle, conside∣ring the condition of that present time, and mine owne euill inclination. I was young, left to liue at mine own liberty, suffered to do what I list, and rather ac∣customed to seeke occasions, to doe then to shunne ill; and I could hardly by the helpe of my good desires, eith•…•… •…•…ose, or lay aside my bad conditions.\n\nSuch a Lady, or such a Gentlewoman saith (which is their ordinary kind of language) I would faine be a good woman, I desire to lead an honest life, as no woman more, if that necessity did not force me to doe that, which I doe. In∣deed Madame, by your leaue, your Ladyship lyes. For, that you doe ill, it is onely, because you are willing to doe ill. O what a poore excuse is this? I con∣fesse that I offend thus and thus, but it is against my will; for I am not of my selfe giuen to such, or such a sinne, nor haue any inclination thereunto in the world. In good faith it is otherwise, for I reade it in your eyes. And they con∣senting vnto sinne, who can be said to be the cause thereof, but your selues? For if you would but turne your eyes from your windowes, and throw them on your distaffe, or your cushionet, certainly necessity would not constraine you to ill. Womens hands are not of that length, nor so quicke and so nimble, that they should sodainly reach so farre, as to finde you food, apparell, and house-rent: yet are they long enough, to put themselues forth to seruice; and they that set you a worke, will bestow house-roome on you, and put meate in your mouthes, and money in your purse. But I expect you should say vnto me; Thou, that art a man, giu'st me this counsaile; Thou art loath to serue thy selfe, and yet thou wouldst haue me to serue, that am a woman? Indeed, thou hast hit the nayle on the head; And this is that, which I say; That your Mi∣strisse-ship, and I, and this, or that other woman (bee shee what shee will) are all of vs vnwilling to doe our selues good. We will put to no helping hand of our owne, but would, that what we stand in need of, should be put into our mouthes, and that it should miraculously be ministred vnto vs.\n\nTwenty yeares of age, is a terrible beast: O how headstrong, and how wild it is. There is no battaile so bloody, no skirmish so hot, and so hard to come off cleare, as that warre, which wee wage with our youth. For if it goe about to make its retreat from Vice, it hath many fierce enemies that sharply set vpon it, neuer ceasing to assaile it, galling it here, & wounding it there, which wil hardly bee repell'd, more hardly ouercome, by reason of those many occasions of ad∣uantage which offer them-selues; it being besides a thing proper vnto youth, to stumble, if not to fall, at euery step: Youth hath not (beleeue me) any strength in its legs, much lesse know they well how to goe. It is an vntamed beaste, it is full of fury, and voyd of patience; and if it entertaine any good mo∣tion, a hundred ill thoughts disband the same by and by, and put it to route; not giuing it so much leysure as to set foote to ground, nor to put it in the •…•…∣rop, not to seate him-selfe sure in the Saddle. Euery one cannot get vp to it; and few that can bridle this beaste. It will not be so soone ouer-mastered, as some doe thinke, nor be easily brought to goe that way as a man would haue it. I was euer, like the Hog, vp to the very eyes, nousling my selfe in the mud of vice and wickednesse, (for albeit I did not alwayes practise ill, yet I neuer lost the sight of it) and I was loath to kick and fling against it, lest by my too\n\ndescription Page 101\n\nmuch stirring, I might loosen my lading, and cause it to fall to the ground; if not spraine, and hurt my selfe.\n\nA Bullocke, or young Steere, when he is to bee tamed, they first halter his legges, throwing him downe on the ground, then they fall a shooing of him, after that, they binde a rope or a cord to one of his hornes, which they suffer him to traile after him for some fewe daies; and when they are minded to bring his necke to the yoake, they yoake him with an old Oxe, that hath beene long vsed to the plough, and so by little and little disposing him thereunto, they teach him by these degrees to beginne to draw handsomely, and in the end to be as perfect as the best of them.\n\nThat young man therefore, that hath a desire to be old, let him leaue to fol∣low my steps, and let him striue to subdue his passions; let him prepare, and dispose himselfe to labour, and in dispight of his owne will, let him strongly struggle and wrastle with his idle and foolish desires, and throw them flat on their backes to the ground, that they may neuer rise vp any more to make resi∣stance against him: And when he hath thus gotten them downe vnder him, let him binde them fast with that double twisted cord of Patience, and Humi∣lity; and let him traile after him, for some certaine daies, these his strange and dangerous appetites, spending his time in vertuous exercises, and many shall not passe ouer his head, before hee be brought to bow his necke to that holy yoake of repentance; and by yoaking him-selfe with good company, hee shall quickly be inured to the plough, wherewith he shall breake vp the earth of his euill inclinations; But let no man thinke, that hee shall bee able to doe this at the first dash; and that once trying what he can doe, shall be sufficient to make him grow perfect. Some (I know) will not sticke to tell me; I would doe this, and I would doe that, my will is to it, but &c. Let him speake this to such ano∣ther as himselfe, and to one that is of the like quality and condition, as he is. For I know well enough already, that he is not willing to doe this, nor to doe that; For they, that are willing indeed, vse other more effectuall meanes. And nothing is hard to them, that will set them-selues hard to it. Peraduenture such a one thinkes, or expects, that God should open the heauens, and miracu∣lously strike him to the ground, as he did Saint Paul; But let him not looke to haue the like course to be taken with him; lest he be accounted a foole for his labour.\n\nGod threw him to the ground, and humbled him sufficiently, when he af∣flicted him with sicknes, when he laid troubles vpon him, and when he suffered him to be toucht in his good name; if either then, or now, thou wouldst accept of grace, while it is offered thee, thou shalt be sure to finde it. But thou wast neuer willing to entertaine these good motions, much lesse to humble thy selfe with Saint Paul, and to city out with him; Domine, quid vis, vt faciam? Lord, what wilt thou, that I doe? What is thy diuine will and pleasure? Thou wilt not like Paul be for God, and yet thou look'st that God should be for thee. And if he dealt thus with Saint Paul, it was because God knew the earnest desire that he had to know and search out the Truth: and that it was his zeale to the Law that did thus ouersway him; the current whereof being turn'd another way, he would be as feruent for the Gospell. And you can instance but in a few that haue beene saued by a bare intention, without any good worke. These •…•…o are to concurre in one, intention and action; I say, if we haue any time left vnto vs for action, or wherein we may doe any good worke. And then shall a •…•…me intention of amendment of life, and a hearty sorrow for our sins past, be accounted a good worke, when the night of death shall sodainly ouertake vs, and shut vs vp in darknesse. But hauing day enough to worke and labour in the Lords Uineyard, both these ought to goe together, I meane intention and action. For neither the spade alone, nor the hand alone, can digge, and dresse the ground; but hand, and spade, must both worke together.\n\ndescription Page 102\n\nBut who hath put me into this theame? Was not I in Florence euen now to my great content? Thither doe I returne againe. I assure thee, that the more I walked vp and downe that Citie, the more desirous I was to plant there my Pillars, and not to seeke for a Plus vltrà. For it was euen as I would haue wisht it to be, all very beautifull and delightsome. And if therein resided either flat∣tery or enuie, I tooke no great heed thereof, but let it runne to others account, for I was none of those, that were comprehended in that Decree. I had no∣thing to doe (like Iudas) with the almes of the poore; nor could any preiudice thereby come vnto me, being that I pretended nothing in Court. And if they would any way haue holpen me, I had no need to vse them. Or had I stood in need of them, I would not haue made any vse of them; they euermore seeming vnto me the greatest meanes of mischiefe, that euer came yet within my know∣ledge. For one onely flatterer is sufficient alone of him-selfe to ouerthrow a Commonwealth, if not a whole Kingdome. Happy is that King, and fortu∣nate that Prince, whose Subiects serue him for loue, and who out of his wise∣dome leaues now and then an eare open to the peoples complaints, as also their aduice; for onely by this meanes shall he come to know truthes, whereby hee may redresse those things, that are amisse, and keepe off flatterers from abusing his eares.\n\nThere would I haue liu'd all the daies of my life, and haue past away the time, like a Duke, had I had wherewithall. But I was in a manner blowne vp, and all my money was almost spent. I need not to confirme this vnto you with an oath, for you may very well (if you will) beleeue me on my bare word. The Riuer now began to grow drie, and my store to faile me; for, Del monton que sacau, y no ponen, presto lo descomponen. Pull from your heap, and put nothing to it; you, or your heape (if not both) may rue it. So that my moneys still going out, and none comming in, if I should haue staid any longer there, I should quickly haue runne my-selfe out at the heeles, and it would haue beene a great disreputation for me, to haue come in a horsebacke, and to goe out a foote. I thought it good counsell to vphold mine honor, and to depart from thence, both to my credit, and content, before that being forced thereunto by neces∣sity, I should come to discouer my wants, and be bound to stay still there, for lacke of meanes to be gone. I acquainted Sayavedra with this my purpose, and plainly opened my minde vnto him; For by this time, I knew well enough, that he was likely to be my onely helpe at a pinch, my strong forte, and the onely trench whereunto I might with safety retire, and that I could not haue met with such another companion in all the world for my purpose. I went pre∣paring him by a little and a little, working and disposing him by degrees, that he might not afterwards thinke that he had seene strange visions, and vaine apparitions, and that whatsoeuer should hereafter befall me, might not seeme new vnto him, or accounted as a nouelty.\n\nWhen I had thus moulded him, he said vnto me; Sir, There is one remedy, that offers it selfe vnto me now on the sodaine, neither chargeable, nor hard, but very easie to be effected, and that may make much for your profit. Seeing there is no remedy, but wee must be gone, it is not much materiall which gate we goe out at; for at any one of the ten, we may trauaile out on our ten toes, to goe abroad, and see the world. Let vs (if you will be rul'd by me) take the way, that leads to Bologna; for besides, that it is neere at hand, and that we shall there see that famous Vniuersity, wee may chance likewise to haue the good lucke to meere with Alexandro Bentivoglio, that Master of mine, who went away with the most part of your goods. For if we hap to find him there, (as I verily beleeue we shall,) It will be an easie matter for you to recouer your owne. For, vpon that information which was made of the theft in Siena, it is not to be doubted, that though you get not what you lost againe, yet he or his father will at least be content to giue you good satisfaction.\n\ndescription Page 103\n\nI tooke this to be no bad counsell, but was very well pleased therewith, not thinking on any other thing then the force of Law, and the iustnesse of my cause; and let iustice deale neuer so indirectly with me, I could not conceiue the least cause of doubt, in regard of the cleare notice I could make of the theft, which would, if not all, yet haue allotted me the greater part of my goods: per∣swading my selfe, that this party, who was principall in this theft, knowing him-selfe guilty therof, would haue come vnto me vpon his knees, desiring my pardon, and that he would voluntarily haue offered to make me amends for the wrong he had done me, and to come vpon any termes to agreement with me; as well for that his parents, and kindred in that Citie, were persons of principall note; as also, for that notwithstanding all the meanes they were able to make to bolster out the matter, yet would they neuer permit, that so foule a fact should come to publike hearing, and be iudicially tryde, nor that they, and their house, should be blotted and blurr'd with so foule a staine, and dishonour, as this could not chuse but proue, if it should once come to be ripped vp.\n\nWill you heare a strange kinde of humour in me? you shall then know it by this. It is not long since you heard me say, what a delicate and delightsome place Florence was, and what a deale of pleasure I tooke therein. And now vpon the sudden, I was growne out of loue with it, the very name of it was growne so hatefull vnto me, that it was ready out of a loathing that I had taken to it, to turne vp my stomach. It began now (me thought) to stinke, I could not endure the sent of it; euery thing seemed so foule and so filthy to my sight, that I did now long to be gone, and till then, euery day was to me a thousand. You may see (my masters) what wonders want of money can worke! You will in a moment hate those things, which you lou'd most, when you lacke wherewith∣all to maintaine both your selues, and them. Now my minde gaue me, that there was not such another Citie in the world, as Bologna; wherein I should no sooner set my foot, but I should recouer my stolne wares, and haue wherewith∣all to spend, and to keepe company with your young Students, lads of the right stampe, merry greekes, much of mine owne size and marke, with whom I might play three or foure venewes, when I were so disposed, without any great disaduantage of weapon. And the dice might haply haue giuen me so lucky a chance, and haue hit so right, that I might haue had the good fortune to haue followed my studies: for that learning, which my Lord Cardinall bestowed vpon me, I had not as yet forgot it, but was very ready and perfect in all that had beene taught me. And questionlesse, with that little learning, that I then had, I might very well haue proceeded Master, and made a shift to liue by that profession, if that kinde of course had beene fitting for me, or that my selfe had beene willing to apply my minde hereunto.\n\nBut stay a while Guzman, be not thou too hastie: Wilt thou offer to traile a gowne after thee, being so weake that thou canst scarce hale a halter at thy heeles? Hold thy hand, this is not a taske for thee to vndertake. There is no talking of commencing Doctor, till the bowe of preferment be drawne home by the strong arme of angels. What canst thou hope for then, who art so poore, that thou art scarce able to wagg the string.\n\nI was now fully resolued to begin my iourney, and to make all the haste I could. And so in an instant I put this my intention in execution. Away goes Sayavedra, and I together, making directly for Bologna. And because I had fly∣ing thoughts in my head, I was willing to put wings to my horse: making such good speed, that we came thither that night; but slept very little, for we spent the most part of it in plotting and casting about how we should beare our selues in this businesse; and whilest we were discoursing to and fro, what were best to be done; Sayavedra (hauing looked well as it should seeme on his owne cards) sayes vnto me: Sir, I hold it not so fit, that I should be seene herein at all, espe∣cially now at this my first flight, but rather to lye close awhile, till we may see,\n\ndescription Page 104\n\nwhere it will be best to giue the wound; and when wee shall come to know, where the game lies, and that there is any hope of doing good, then let vs let flie, and strike it dead. For if Alexandro be in the towne, and should know that I am here, (which he cannot choose, if I stir abroad, being so well knowne as I am,) he will question me, wherefore I am come hither, and with whom? And that knowne, he will absent him-selfe forthwith from the Citie, and so we shall be defeated of our purpose. Or if he chance but to suspect, that I had a finger in this businesse, and that I was the cause of this iourney, and his shame, there is no way but one with me, he will surely kill me; so that neither of these two will aduantage vs any thing, nor is fitting for vs to be aduentured on. Be∣sides, if this web must come to be wouen in the Loome of Iustice, I must bee the master-thred to be wrought vpon, there is no auoyding of it: And there∣fore you haue no reason to suffer me (considering that I can stand you in no stead, if I be taken and clapt by the heeles) to receiue any farther harme, then what I haue already endured. The best course then to be taken, I conceiue to be this; That to morrow morning you make inquirie after him, and by one meanes or other (with the best secresie you can) seeke first to know him, and to take particular notice of his person; That done, wee will consult thereof afresh, and gouerne our selues therein, according as occasion and time shall serue.\n\nI did not like amisse of this, me thought it was good wholesome counsell. Well; as he had aduised me I set my selfe to worke, I walkt vp and downe the Towne, and after the treading of some few steps, not being troubled (as fortune would haue it) to tyre out my legs in the search of him, it was my good hap to haue him pointed out vnto me with the finger, telling me; Loe, that's the man. Which direction I needed not, for the cloathes on his backe did speake what he was, and without others teaching, could tell me, This is Alexandro. He was standing amongst other young men at the Church doore; nor doe I beleeue, that his deuotion was such, as to goe in and out to heare Masse, but I was rather of opinion, that hee stood there registring those that went in, offering great scandall, but showing small respect, to that sacred place. It is a foule shame, that this is so commonly vsed as it is in most parts of the Christian world. I know what I speake; Would to God I knew as well how to reforme this abuse. Are there not store of streets, and other publike places in the towne, for to make loue in, which wee scandall too much already with our lewd steps, wanton lookes, dishonest signes, and tokens, and perhaps other things of a worse con∣dition, to intimate our loose and lustfull affections, but that wee must wrong Gods holy Temple with this our vnciuill and beastly behauiour.\n\nBut let vs proceed in our former argument, that wee may not leape from a Masse, into a Sermon. It seemed vnto me, that hee stood not there with any great deuotion, for he talkt apace with his hand, and now and then he would breake out in a loud laughter. He had at that time a doublet of mine on his backe of cloath of siluer, and a ierkin drest with Amber, and other rich per∣fumes, cut and slasht cleane through, and lined with the same cloath of siluer, sutable to the doublet, and richly laid with lace after the Seuillian fashion, and eight buttons of gold wrought vpon Amber, to make it sit the closer to the collar, all which a Gentleman of Naples presented mee withall, for a certaine dispatch that I had procured for him, by soliciting his businesse with my Lord Embassador.\n\nWhen I came to know mine owne, and saw another man weare it before my face, I could haue found in my heart to haue stab'd him, and to haue pre∣sently stript him of it, so did it grieue and vexe the very soule of me, that such deare pledges as these of my friends loue vnto me, should thus fore against my will, be in another mans possession. My blood rose against him, and I was of∣ten tempted to haue gone and stab'd him, but I held my hand, and said with\n\ndescription Page 105\n\nmy selfe; No Guzman, no; This must not be so; Better it were, that this thy thiefe, should be conuerted, and liue. For if thou let him liue, he may chance to pay thee; but if thou kill him, thou art sure to pay for him. And of the two, it is better to take, then to giue. And safer it is for thee, that others should be indebted to thee, then thou indebted to others. And it will bee more for thy ease, and more easily compast, to get in a debt, then to pay a debt. Make not thy selfe the defendant, if thou maist be the plaintiffe. Goe on faire and soft∣ly, be not so hasty, for there is no body that runs after vs. And if there be any order or Law in gaming, and if the dice runne true, if the cards bee not packt, but are well shuffled and cut, and that there be faire play, vnlesse the diuell be in it, or my lucke exceeding bad, all the world cannot winne the game from me. For I haue cards enough in mine owne hand to carry it. We are sure the bird cannot now get from vs; which is that which importeth vs most. Let vs not feare the Chase, but hunt liuely, for the Buls are safe enough; they cannot escape vs. He is taken in the manner, the theft found about him, hee cannot possibly deny it. I sweare I will put him to his necke-verse, and see how well or ill he will come off, and make him to confesse vpon the Racke, who put him into those fine cloathes, or in what Fayre or Market he bought them.\n\nHauing consulted thus with my selfe, I got me home to my lodging, ac∣quainting Sayavedra with what I had seene. Hee had prouided me my dinner ready for me, and had set it downe on the table, as soone as he saw I was come; And when we had din'd, we pitcht the hay wherewith we were to catch this Cony. We discoursed one while of this course, another while of that, many designes we had, many meanes propounded to come by our owne; but Saya∣vedra (poore man) did stagger at them, and was loath to giue way vnto them: He repented him now of the counsell hee had giuen me, fearing therein his own danger. But we concluded in the end, that of all other meanes, Peace (if we could draw him to some reasonable composition) were the best. For it is better to haue one bird in the hand, then two in the bush. And a bad Accord, is better then a good Plea: Lesse harme euer comming of agreeing, then suing. So that at last, we grew to this conclusion, that I, by a third person, should vse some meanes, to haue his father talkt withall, making him acquainted with the businesse, and the whole manner how it was carried, giuing him a large ac∣count of euery particular thing, remitting my selfe to his good will and plea∣sure, how he in his owne discretion should thinke meet I deseru'd to be dealt withall, and that he would not enforce mee (considering my faire manner of proceeding with him) to recouer mine owne by rigour of Law, being there was Euidentia facti; besides many other pregnant proofes to be produced, that these goods were mine. And so I did, as we had deuised; hauing made choice of a discreet person, who should secretly and with fitting language, deliuer thus much vnto him. But because Power is commonly accompanied with Pride, and Pride is still attended with Tyranny, he was so farre from compounding the businesse, that he made little reckoning of it, taking it ill at his hands that trea∣ted with him about it, wishing him that hee should speake no more of it, dee∣ming it as an affront done vnto his honour, and a meere defamation. He feigned him-selfe to be greatly wronged, though he knew well enough that I was he, that was iniur'd; and without giuing vs either good hopes, or good words, he dispatcht my messenger.\n\nWhen I receiu'd this answer, I hatched a thousand euill imaginations in my heart. But because I would not returne euill for euill, I resolued to talke with some one Lawyer or other of that Vniuersity, that should be recommended vn∣to me for the nimblenesse of his wit, and soundnesse of iudgement; to whom I opening my case (fearing the successe thereof, for that my aduersaries father was so powerfull) might craue his opinion, and that hee would assist me with his best aduice and counsell, for the better prosecuting of his businesse. Hee\n\ndescription Page 106\n\nplainly told me; Sir, it is well enough knowne in this Towne, what manner of man Alexandro is, as also his lewd and idle courses, which in some other place, would be a sufficient information against him. Besides, there is so much truth in that, which you vrge against him, that it is manifestly apparant to as many as know him, or shall heare you. You haue right on your side, a iust and a good cause, and therefore I would aduise you to frame an information against him, and to desire iustice. All Bologna, hath taken notice already of this theft of his; for, as soone as he came hither with it, it was presently knowne, that these clothes were none of his owne; as well, because he caused them to be altred, and fitted to his owne bodie; as also, for that he carried hence with him no lambes to sell, nor any other kinde of merchandize, whereby he should make so rich a returne. Besides, another companion of his, in whom he put much trust, stole a good part of these goods from him, that he might likewise gaine thereby a part of his Pardons, & Indulgences. You see now, what course you must be faine to take, what lyes in me to releeue you, you may be assured of the best furtherance and the best counsell that I can giue you, for the coun∣tenancing of this your cause.\n\nWhereupon, I being very desirous, that a bill should be exhibited against him, he presently (according to my information) drew one out, which I forth∣with presented to the Auditore del Torrone, who is there the Iudge in all Cau∣ses Criminall. But, be it as it may be, whether it were immediatly from the Iudge him-selfe, or from the Notarie, I know not which, nor from whence, nor how it came to passe, but sure I am, that this businesse of mine was instantly ouer all the Towne, and particular notice was giuen thereof vnto Alexandro's father. And for that he was a man of authoritie in that Towne, and carried a great hand there amongst them, he hyes him in all haste to the Iudge, and there accusing me for this my bold attempt, and inconsiderate rashnesse, (as it pleased him to terme it) he formed a complaint against me, that I had defa∣med, and dishonoured his house, and that therefore he was of purpose come vnto him to desire his lawfull fauour, and that he would be pleased to doe him iustice, to the end that I might be seuerely punished for this my presumption. I know not how, but the matter was so carried betweene them, that it had beene better for me, to haue held my peace. He was a powerfull man in that Citie, and the Iudge (it seemed) was very willing to pleasure him. I began now to feare, that occasions of quarrell would be pickt against me; mole-hils made mountaines; and this my losse, turne to my greater losse; making my vn∣doing, an occasion of my farther vndoing. For Loue, Interest, and Hatred, are euer maine enemies to the Truth. And in many places, As a man is befriended, so his Cause is ended. But he that hath both money and friends, is sure to worke out his ends. Money is of no great thicknesse, yet it dulls the double edg'd sword of iustice, if it but once offer to touch it. Gold, is a heauy mettall; and that makes the ballance of Iustice so light. I did spit as it were against heauen, the driuell whereof fell vpon my owne face; I shot my arrowes vp in∣to the ayre, and they returned backe againe vpon mine owne bosome; the in∣nocent paying for the nocent; and the iust, for the vniust.\n\nMuch money, does much harme; But much more, the euill intention of an euill man. And therefore where an ill-minded man, and a great masse of money meet together and shake hands, there is much need of helpe from heauen, to free an innocent soule out of their cruell clawes. Good Lord deli∣uer vs from out their clutches, for they are more griping and tyrannous, then those of Tygers, or of Lyons. Their will is a law; what-soeuer they desire, that they doe; right (when they lift) shall be wrong; and wrong, right: And no man must controll them for it; nor dare to say, blacke is their eye; lest he chance to lose both his owne, for prying too neere into the secrets of these earthly gods. O that there were men of that goodnesse and courage, that would\n\ndescription Page 107\n\nnot sticke to tell them, and plainly giue them to vnderstand; that the money, they thus vnlawfully take, shall last with them but a while; but the fire, where∣with they shall be tormented for it, shall continue for euer.\n\nThe Iudge did limit me a prefixed time for my proofes, but so short, that it was not possible for me to make my information according to that scantling. In this you may see the iniustice that he did me. Who did euer till now know a Iudge restraine the Plaintiffe of lawfull time to make his proofes, as he did me, especially when I did alleage for my selfe, that the information was to come from Siena, where the theft was committed, whence I was to procure it, for otherwise I could not haue it. But to alleage this, or not alleage it, all was one. I must be content, will I, nill I, to sit downe with this losse. There was no fence for it. And to this purpose, before I passe any farther, I will tell you what hap∣ned in a little Village of Andaluzia.\n\nThere was a certaine sessing to be set in a ratable proportion, vpon the Towne-dwellers, and borderers there-about, for some publike peece of worke, that was to goe in hand; and the Collectors that were appointed to gather the money, had put into their rolle (to contribute thereunto) a Gentleman of as ancient a house, as any in those parts; who taking himselfe therein to be great∣ly wronged, made his complaint against the collectors. But for all that, they did not strike his name out of the rolle. Now, when the time was come for the levying of these moneyes, they went vnto this Gentleman to demand so much of him, as he was rated at in their note; He refused to pay it. Whereupon they distrained on his goods, and paid themselues. The Gentleman being much offended with this their proceeding, goes forthwith to his Lawyer, asks his counsell, who (in conclusion) drawes me a petition for him, grounded vpon all both Law, and Reason, wherein he layes open his ancient Gentry, and the noblenesse of his House, and that in regard thereof he was priuiledged from all manner of sessings, and such other the like payments, and that therefore he did humbly petition the Court, that they would be pleased to giue present order, that what the Collectors had forcibly taken from him, might againe be restored, and be deliuered backe vnto him, as in all equitie it ought. When this petition was by them deliuered vnto the Alcalde, hauing read it, and heard what they could say for themselues, he called to the Register, and said vnto him; Mark well, what I shal say vnto you, & see you set it down in the very same words, as I shall deliuer it vnto you. This Petitioner (then said he) as he is a Gentleman, I will by no meanes debarre him of his priuilege, God forbid I should denie him his iust request; but as he is a poore man, his House growne now to decay, and himselfe (as you see) in want, I hold it very fit, that he pay as others doe.\n\nThat I had iustice on my side, no man doubted it; it was so publike a thing, that all the world tooke notice of it. But I was poore and needy, and therefore it was fit I should pay for all, and there was no reason (in that respect) that they should doe mee iustice. I presently smelt a rat; I saw this was a bad signe, and was shrewdly afraid, that all my labour would be lost. But I could not for all this perswade my selfe, nor could it sincke into my head, that I should be that man, or whom it is said by way of prouerbe; Paçiente, y apaleado: That I must goe away with the wrong, and the blowes too. First be made cuckold, and af∣terwards knockt for my prating. Well; such was my hard fortune, that being not able to bring in my proofes in so short a time, it so fell out with me, that my Bill of Complaints, was throwne out of the Court, and held as a thing of no validitie or force in Law, and that of the aduerse part, tooke place against me; declaring there in Court, that I by this my petition, had shamed an infamous L•…•…bell against his sonne, by meanes whereof his House, and h•…•… honour was much defamed; adding and interferting, in maiorem cautelam, I know not what a world of words, and what strange and intricate termes. That I did sp•…•…te, in∣dubitatè,\n\ndescription Page 108\n\n&c. That I did it wittingly and willingly, impudently and malitiously, aggrauating the matter against me with all the odious termes they could de∣uise, that if I should set them downe one by one, they would take vp a whole sheet of paper. Alleaging farther against me, that forasmuch as his sonne, was a quiet, honest, and peaceable Gentleman, and of a good both report, and life, I did deserue I know not what exemplarie punishment, hanging, burning, and drowning, all was too little, that I knew not what to make of it, nor what a Gods name, they would doe with me. Which things, w•…•…n they were read vnto me, I said to my selfe; These men may haue healthy bodies, but I am sure they haue sicke soules; They may haue good purses, but I finde (to my cost) they haue bad consciences. I was carelesse, (as one that was confident of a good cause) I neuer shrunke aside, and as I was afterwards going about my bu∣sinesse, that my sute might not fall, for want of following, I was taken vp in the midst of the street by an Arrest, and presently carried away to prison, without any other information against me, saue only the putting vp of my petition, and acknowledging it to be mine.\n\nThere is no sword, that hath so keene and sharpe an edge, as Calumnie, and false Accusation: and then cuts deepest, when it is in the hand of a tyrannous Iudge; whose force and power is such, that it is able to ouerthrow, and lay le∣uell with the ground, the best grounded Iustice that is, though it haue neuer so sure, neuer so strong a foundation. Which it doth then most, and most ea∣sily, when a poore mans cause comes in his way, who suspects (poore harme∣lesse soule) nothing lesse, then to receiue hurt from him, to whom he flyes for helpe. My businesse was plaine, no tricks, no giggs in it, I did only set downe the naked truth, but they made it I know not how, by their quillets and deui∣ces, knotty and vneuen, though there was not a man, neither within, nor without the Towne, that did not know, all was true, that I had deliuered; and all this did plainly appeare to the Iudge to be so, and that I had sufficient information.\n\nAll this is very good; yet for all this (goodman Guzman) giue me leaue to tell you, that you are a goose-cap. Thou art poore, thou wantest fauour, and friends; and therefore art neither to be heard, nor beleeu'd. These are not Cases, that are to be brought before the Tribunals of men; but when thou hast occasion to haue thy cause try de, goe get thee to God, petition him, where the truth shall appeare face to face, without any need of the fauour of thy friend, nor an Aduocate to plead thy cause, nor a Register to record it, nor a Iudge to wrest it. But here they made a sport of Iustice, and like Iuglers plaid legger∣demaine with me. They punisht me, as an vnmannerly man of my tongue, a lyar, and a lewd companion. I had spent my moneyes, lost my goods, put in prison, gyves clapt on my legs, treated with euill language, vpbraiding mee with many foule and vnciuill reproches, vnworthy my person, without suffe∣ring me to open my mouth in mine owne defence. And when I would haue answered their obiections, and giuen them satisfaction by writing, when they saw how the world went with me, my Proctor forsooke me, my Solicitor would not come at me, my Aduocate refused to plead for me, so that I only now remained in the power of the publike Notarie. The only comfort that I had, was the generall voice of my wrong, comforting me, that that terrible and fearefull day, would one day come, that the powerfull shall for all his power, be condemned to Hell, and that there, your potentes, potenter punientur, your mighty men shall be mightily punished; for that they are accursed of God for peruerting of Iustice. And that which he shall leaue behinde him, shall not continue to the third heyre, though he tye his land neuer so fast, nor make ne∣uer so strong a conueyance, that it shall not goe from the house: For he cannot (though h•…•… would neuer so faine) tye the inclinations of those that are to suc∣ceed him; nor is there any preuention, that he can vse, of that force as the least\n\ndescription Page 109\n\nhaire of his head, to make any resistance against Gods diuine will and pleasure. And it is to be beleeued as an article of thy faith, that their lands and estates must be spent and consumed, for that they are the grindings of the face of the poore, vngodly gaine, the bloud of the innocent, gotten in rage, and maintai∣ned with lyes.\n\nBut thou wilt say vnto me; Trust them with so much more, till that day come, and you shall see whether they will make any bones of either taking the one, or thinking on the other. Where-unto I answer, that how sleight a reckoning soeuer thou mak'st of it, and that it seemes so long a day to thee, that it will neuer come, I doe not know what these kinde of men may thinke of it; but I know very well, that it will come, and that quickly, and sooner perhaps then thou art aware. And then it shall seeme so short vnto thee, that thou wilt say; I am but newly come forth with my feet from out my bed, and the night is already come, and I must shut vp my eyes in darknesse.\n\nBut perhaps, thou wilt reply vnto me; I pray how cam'st thou by so many good suits of clothes, so much money, and other things of value? Thou didst not get them by the spade, nor the plough, thou didst not digge, nor delue for them. What didst thou make in that street, vpon that occasion and accident you wot of, when you seru'd your Master the French Embassador? Is this (quoth I) the rod, you seeke to beat me withall? Thou art caught in thine owne-trap; thine owne words doe condemne thee. For thou would'st liken these goods of mine, to those that are gotten by lewd women, whereas thou doest not, but oughtest to vnderstand, that their gaine is lawfull, though the act be vnlawfull; and thou art in conscience bound to recompence her, if thou hast had thy desire of her, and didst make vse of her for thine owne interest. Besides, the case is not alike. For it is publikely knowne to all the world; that though a corrupt Iudge commit neuer so many mischiefes, neuer so vniustly put men to death, neuer so wrongfully rob a man of his goods, and vndoe him by his partiall and corrupt dealing, thou shalt haue little or no remedie against him, nor canst thou take that from him, which he hath stolne from others. For thou art not his competent Iudge, nor of that power as to adiudge against his will that to others, which he hath taken from them. For though it be true, that he is culpable therein towards others; thou shalt be sure to be found cul∣pable towards him. And howsoeuer he scape, thou shalt be sure to smart for it. Beleeue me, I tell thee what is "
