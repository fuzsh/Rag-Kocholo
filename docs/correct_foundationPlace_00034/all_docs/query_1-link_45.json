These bases are extensively chemically modified to create new letters in the alphabet that change the meaning of the message. These changes can impact the fate and function of mRNAs in cells. The full collection of RNA modifications in cellular mRNAs represents a previously unappreciated layer of gene regulation on top of what is hard-wired in our genome. The Martinez lab studies how these chemical modifications are added very early when mRNAs are “born,” and how they impact how mRNAs are processed and interpreted in cells. RNA modifications have an important role in health and disease: many RNA modifying enzymes have been associated with a wide range of human diseases, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders, and cancer. Our goal is to connect molecular functions of RNA modifications to normal and disease traits using innovative high-throughput sequencing methods, RNA biochemistry, and model systems.\n\nAssistant Professor, Dental Medicine and Oral Health Sciences\n\nB.Sc., McGill University\n\nPh.D., McGill University\n\nFibromyalgia is a chronic, whole-body pain disorder. Despite having a clinical diagnosis for decades, the underlying causes remain poorly understood. During a postdoctoral fellowship, Dr. Krock and colleagues found that IgG antibodies from fibromyalgia patients cause mice to develop signs of pain, but antibodies from pain-free people do not. The fibromyalgia antibodies bind to satellite glia cells, which surround pain-sensing neurons, and the levels of these antibodies are higher in fibromyalgia patients with more pain. These results suggest a subset of fibromyalgia pain could be mediated by autoantibodies—that is, antibodies attacking parts of our own body. However, why these autoantibodies develop remains unclear. The Krock lab at McGill University is investigating how fibromyalgia autoantibodies develop. One possibility is that altered gut bacteria stimulate an antibody-generating immune response, and if these antibodies recognize molecules similar enough to molecules found on satellite glia, then an autoantibody response could occur.\n\nMilton E. Cassel Scholar\n\nAssistant Professor, Cell Biology\n\nB.Sc., University College London\n\nDr. rer. nat., Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich\n\nLucas Farnung has been designated the Milton E. Cassel Scholar for the 2023 class of Rita Allen Foundation Scholars. This special award honors the memory of a longtime President of the Rita Allen Foundation who passed away in 2004.\n\nEach human cell takes on an extraordinary feat, as it compacts its two-meter-long genome into a nucleus that is merely a few microns in size. Yet, our genetic material must remain accessible, ready to be read by the cell’s molecular machinery. To mitigate this conflict, the genomic DNA is spooled like yarn around specialized proteins called histones. Together, histones and the DNA form a structure called chromatin, akin to delicate beads on a string. The Farnung lab studies how a cellular machine called RNA polymerase II navigates through chromatin and generates blueprints of the DNA in a process called transcription. We use a combination of biophysical methods, machine learning, and structural biology approaches. Elucidating transcription through chromatin is important to understand how cells develop, morph into diverse types—like heart or liver cells—and react to the environment. With many cancers linked to dysregulated chromatin transcription, a deeper grasp of this process is vital for novel cancer therapy development.\n\nAssistant Professor, Gene Expression Laboratory\n\nA.B., Princeton University\n\nPh.D., University of California San Diego\n\nM.D., University of California San Diego\n\nThe Dixon lab is interested in how the spatial organization of genomes affects the acquisition and impact of mutations in cancer. Our genomes are 3 billion base pairs in length and must be compacted into the nucleus of every cell in our body. How our genomes are organized in cells has a major impact on diverse processes, from the expression of genes to the replication of DNA as cells divide. In cancer, our genomes are bombarded with mutations, some of which break and shuffle the genomes creating a mosaic of how these genomes appear in healthy cells. When our genomes are shuffled in cancer cells, this often can place cancer-causing genes in novel environments with altered spatial organization, which can lead to aberrant gene activation that drives the growth of cancer cells. We are interested in understanding where and when such altered gene regulation events occur and understanding what critical factors facilitate altered gene activation in cancer genomes.\n\nAssistant Professor; Psychiatry, Neuroscience, Anesthesiology, and Pain Management\n\nB.S., Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology\n\nM.S., Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology\n\nPh.D., Harvard University\n\nIn conjunction with Margaret and William R. Hearst III\n\nEach day we experience myriad somatosensory stimuli—hugs from loved ones, warm showers, a mosquito bite, and sore muscles after a workout. These tactile, thermal, itch, and nociceptive signals are detected by sensory neurons innervating the skin, propagated into the spinal cord, and transmitted to the brain via ascending somatosensory pathways. Primary sensory neurons that innervate the skin and detect a wide range of somatosensory stimuli have been identified and well-characterized. In contrast, very little is known about how peripheral signals are integrated and processed within the spinal cord and how these signals are conveyed to the brain to generate somatosensory perception and behavioral responses. The Choi lab aims to determine the developmental logic, functional organization, and dysfunction of ascending somatosensory circuitry. Our lab explores these exciting areas using new mouse genetic tools in conjunction with advanced molecular, anatomical, physiological, and behavioral approaches.\n\nAssistant Professor; Department of Biological Sciences\n\nPh.D., European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Germany\n\nM.S., University of Pisa and Scuola Normale Superiore, Italy\n\nThe stunning complexity of our brain is the result of a long journey, that started when squishy and brainless aggregates of cells—the first animals—appeared on Earth over 700 million years ago. Understanding how our brain evolved can shed light on fundamental principles underlying its organization and function. The Tosches lab investigates the evolution of the cerebral cortex, the part of our brain associated with advanced cognition. Focusing on neuron types as units of evolutionary change, we discovered that the mammalian cerebral cortex has a unique neuronal repertoire without clear counterparts in other vertebrates. Our future goal is to understand how changes of developmental programs and gene regulation contributed to the emergence of these new types of neurons in mammals.\n\nAssistant Professor; Biology; Structural Biology\n\nPh.D., University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine\n\nM.A., University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nB.S., University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nViruses are inextricably linked to the host cells that they infect. Thus, investigating viral-host interactions is essential to understanding the mechanisms of viral entry, replication, pathogenesis, and the host’s ability to respond to viral pathogens. The Barnes lab excels in leveraging interdisciplinary approaches to address fundamental principles of viral-host interactions for therapeutic benefit. We combine biophysical and structural methods with in vivo approaches to understand how enveloped viruses infect host cells and elicit immune responses. In particular, our research translates knowledge of the structural correlates of antibody-mediated neutralization into the development of highly effective immunotherapies. Additionally, we seek to identify conserved epitopes on viral glycoproteins that are recognized by neutralizing antibodies to facilitate structure-based immunogen design for candidate vaccines against coronaviruses and HIV-1. By combining structural information and improved biochemical methods to mask distracting epitopes, we believe pan-neutralizing vaccines that protect against emerging and re-emerging viral threats are attainable.\n\nRobert J. and Nancy D. Carney Assistant Professor of Neuroscience\n\nPh.D., University of Alberta\n\nB.S., German University of Cairo\n\nBrain circuits are dynamic networks of neurons that process information in the form of electrical and chemical signals to form memories and behaviors. To investigate how brain circuits instantiate fundamental computations underlying behaviors, we need to map their wiring diagrams coupled with functional analysis at cellular resolution to correlate neuron activity with behavior. However, the electrical and chemical signals are not directly visible since there is no natural contrast mechanism that allows us “to see” those signals. The Abdelfattah lab is developing novel classes of molecular tools for large-scale functional analysis and manipulation of brain circuits. In the lab, we repurpose proteins found in nature and engineer them to illuminate brain communication. We hope to use our new molecular tools to unravel the functional basis and causes of neural disorders at a level of detail that has not been accessible to date and empower us to develop novel treatments.\n\nMilton E. Cassel Scholar\n\nAssistant Professor; Department of Molecular Biology & Biochemistry\n\nPh.D., Harvard University\n\nB.S., Haverford College\n\nKevin Monahan has been designated the Milton E. Cassel Scholar for the 2022 class of Rita Allen Foundation Scholars. This special award honors the memory of a longtime President of the Rita Allen Foundation who passed away in 2004.\n\nIn order to fit the long DNA molecules that encode our genome into a tiny nucleus, our cells fold the DNA into complex 3-dimensional structures. This folding does more than save space; it also affects how genes are turned on and off. Intriguingly, different types of cells in the nervous system exhibit distinct 3D nuclear structures. However, the functional significance and regulation of these 3D nuclear structures remains poorly understood. The Monahan lab studies the protein machinery that controls the 3D positioning of genes within the nucleus and how the formation of 3D nuclear structures regulates gene expression. For example, we recently discovered that olfactory sensory neurons, which detect chemical odorants in the air, use the 3D positioning of odorant receptor genes in the nucleus to control the specific type of odorant receptor that they will express. Using molecular, genetic, and genomic approaches, we are investigating protein complexes that regulate 3D nuclear structures in olfactory neurons and in defined populations of neurons within the central nervous system.\n\nAssistant Professor, Physiological Sciences\n\nB.S., University of Wisconsin – La Crosse\n\nPh.D., University of Iowa\n\nIn conjunction with Margaret and Will Hearst\n\nChronic pain affects millions of people in the United States, and its socioeconomic burden is currently unprecedentedly high due to the opioid crisis. Almost everyone has either experienced chronic pain or had a family member affected by it. For these reasons, the Mickle lab is passionate about pain research and discovering new therapeutic options for chronic pain patients. Our lab uses a “cell to model organism” strategy to pursue the goal of understanding and delineating the causes of bladder pain dysfunction. We have multiple avenues of research that support this end goal: 1) Pursuing the development of neuromodulation strategies to alleviate bladder dysfunction following spinal cord injury, 2) Evaluating the role of urothelial cells, the cells that line the bladder, in bladder pain and dysfunction, and 3) Developing implantable biosensor and neuromodulatory technology to study bladder disorders and pain.\n\nAssistant Professor, Plastic Surgery; Cell biology, neurobiology, and anatomy\n\nPh.D., Rice University\n\nM.D., Baylor College of Medicine\n\nIn conjunction with Margaret and William R. Hearst III\n\nA truly new way to approach a problem surgically is rare and that is what has made targeted muscle reinnervation so fascinating. The unexpected observation that TMR could prevent and reduce residual limb and phantom limb pain in amputees has already impacted the lives of hundreds of patients. The Hoben laboratory has taken TMR from the bedside back to the bench to better elucidate how surgically rearranging nerves affects pain pathways. These changes in nerve connections alter neurons, the fundamental cells of the nervous system. Characterizing the changes in these cells may help identify critical components of residual and phantom limb pain that can be targeted for pain relief. Ultimately, we hope that by better understanding the foundation of TMR pain relief we will be able to apply TMR principles to amputees with chronic pain and other forms of nerve injuries.\n\nAssistant Professor; Biochemistry, Biophysics, Chemical Biology, and Structural Biology\n\nB.S., Stanford University\n\nPh.D., University of California, Berkeley\n\nIn order to fit into our cells, the human genome is packaged by proteins that protect it from breaks and cancer-causing mutations. These proteins also help cells maintain cell identity by suppressing expression of genes that belong to other cell types. The Risca lab is studying one such protein, called macroH2A, which has been shown to suppress several types of cancer. I recently developed a cutting-edge method for mapping the folding of DNA within cells. We are using this method in combination with biochemical studies of DNA wrapped around purified proteins to study the structural mechanisms that macroH2A uses to regulate gene expression. MacroH2A also interacts with PARP1, a major cancer drug target involved in DNA repair and regulation of transcription, and we hope that these insights will inform future innovations in targeted therapy.\n\nAssistant Professor, Materials Science and Engineering\n\nB.S., Peking University\n\nPh.D., Stanford University\n\nResearch from the Hong lab aims to study how the brain changes at the level of single neurons over time as well as the circuits encompassing these neurons. The brain is a dynamically changing structure. The time-dependent evolution of neural circuits during brain development—learning and memory, and aging—occurs over many years and in many different brain regions. However, this evolution involves physiological changes that must be quantified at the millisecond and micrometer scales of individual neurons. A substantial challenge in understanding the dynamically changing brain arises from the spatiotemporal mismatch between the neural activity of interest and the available tools to study it. Therefore, we aim to fill the knowledge gap by developing novel bioelectronic and biophotonic tools to study the long-term evolution of neural circuits during neurodegeneration. The knowledge obtained therein will offer therapeutic strategies for devastating diseases such as Alzheimer’s, thereby improving life quality for the families affected and society as a whole.\n\nAssistant Professor, Laboratory Medicine and Immunobiology\n\nB.S., Yale University\n\nPh.D., Stanford University School of Medicine\n\nM.D., Stanford University School of Medicine\n\nOur first line of defense against harmful infections is known as innate immunity—an inborn system of protective mechanisms that guards against harmful viruses or bacteria, even when the body has never encountered the infection before. Many individuals infected with dangerous viruses such as influenza or coronavirus can recover quickly with only mild symptoms, even without immunity from prior exposure or vaccination, because of these defenses. The Foxman lab studies the biology of innate immune responses in tissues that are not traditionally considered part of the immune system, such as the cells that form the lining of the nasal passages and lung airways. Understanding how innate immunity is regulated in these tissues could help answer unsolved questions in infectious diseases—why the same viral infection can be asymptomatic in one person, but lead to a serious illness in another; or, on a larger scale, why certain viruses spread through families or communities at certain times but not others.\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nB.A., Smith College\n\nPh.D., Yale University\n\nThe brain is one of the most exquisitely complex networks in the known universe, and its precise connectivity is established through a convergence of genetic and environmental influences (i.e., nature and nurture, respectively). While many of the genetic factors that drive early stages of embryonic brain development are known, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how the environment—in the form of sensory experiences—shapes neural circuits in the developing brain. We unexpectedly discovered that sensory experiences engage microglia, a unique class of brain-resident immune cells, to promote the refinement of synaptic connections between neurons early in postnatal life. Based upon this finding, the Cheadle lab combines functional, structural, and genomics approaches to systematically disentangle the mechanisms microglia and neurons use to interact with one another to facilitate postnatal brain development, and to understand how impairments in microglial function contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nAssistant Professor, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics\n\nB.S., Duke University\n\nPh.D., Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nJoshua Modell has been designated the Milton E. Cassel Scholar for the 2021 class of Rita Allen Foundation Scholars. This special award honors the memory of a longtime President of the Rita Allen Foundation who passed away in 2004.\n\nCRISPR technologies have led to revolutionary new modes of genetic inquiry in the basic sciences, and they are in development as therapeutics for many genetic diseases. Less is known about how CRISPR systems function in nature, where they provide bacteria with adaptive immunity against viruses and plasmids. The Modell Lab seeks to understand how these systems interact with the biology of their bacterial hosts and viral targets, and how their activity is regulated to provide strong immunity against viruses while preventing autoimmunity.\n\nMitchell J. and Margo K. Blutt Presidential Assistant Professor, Biology\n\nB.S., North Carolina A&T University\n\nPh.D., University of Pennsylvania\n\nIn conjunction with Open Philanthropy\n\nMy research focuses on a long-standing question—how does the nervous system encode a soft gentle caress versus a harsh painful stimulation? To accomplish this, the Abdus-Saboor Lab uses neurobiology, computational biology, and mathematics to objectively measure pain—a sensory experience that is inherently subjective. Traditionally, researchers have applied sensory stimuli to the rodent paw and tried to infer the animal’s pain state based on the singular readout of whether the animal moved its paw or not. The problem is, animals will lift their paw to both innocuous and noxious stimuli; and with that sole measurement parameter, there is a high likelihood of incorrectly assigning the animal’s sensory experience. An innovation in our work is to use videography to take thousands of images per second to measure sub-second pain behaviors, and couple this with statistical modeling and machine learning to develop rodent “pain scales.”\n\nAssistant Professor, Immunobiology\n\nB.S., University of California, Berkeley\n\nPh.D., Harvard University\n\nAn essential function of the immune system is to distinguish between its own and foreign molecules in order to destroy pathogens while preventing destruction of healthy cells. The Chen Lab investigates how the immune system correctly identifies pathogens when the same signals are found in both host cells and pathogens. Circular RNAs (circRNAs)—single-stranded RNAs where the ends are joined together—are encoded by eukaryotes and viruses. We study the essential features of viral and host circRNAs that are required in the regulation and recognition of self- versus non-self, the proteins involved in this process, and the ensuing cellular signaling. We strive to apply our understanding to engineer circRNAs as a novel strategy for immunotherapy that exploits the uniquely promising characteristics of circRNAs.\n\nAssistant Professor, Physiology\n\nPh.D., Lille University School of Medicine, France\n\nThe Laumet Lab is interested in understanding why pain becomes chronic and how can we stop it. While it is obvious that neurons convey pain signaling throughout the body, neurons do not work in isolation and are constantly communicating with and getting influenced by other cells. We are particularly interested in the contribution of non-neuronal cells to chronic pain. We think that impaired communication between “pain-sensing” neurons and their surrounding cells may result in chronic pain. For example, we have discovered that anti-inflammatory molecules secreted by cells from the immune system prevent pain-sensing neurons from becoming persistently activated—this constant activity is the cellular basis of chronic pain. We hope that a better understanding of neuron/non-neuronal cell communication will lead to the development of new and better analgesics.\n\nAssistant Professor, Department of Symptom Research\n\nB.S., The University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, United Kingdom\n\nPh.D., The University of Manchester, United Kingdom\n\nWork in the Shepherd Lab focuses on how injury, inflammation, and cancer interact with the nervous system to cause pain. We are particularly interested in how chronic illnesses disrupt the immune system, thereby increasing pain risk. Macrophages, a type of immune cell, are important contributors to pain. Macrophages infiltrate damaged tissue to clear debris and infection. Ordinarily, this process eventually resolves, promoting healing. We hypothesize that chronic pain often stems from macrophages failing to make this transition from a “damage response” to a “pro-repair” state. In such cases, macrophages continually sustain inflammation, causing nearby nerves to remain hyper-excitable and drive chronic pain. Our knowledge of these mechanisms is surprisingly limited, a problem that is set to become more widespread as chronic illnesses and cancer survivorship improve. We hope that improving our understanding of these “neuro-immune” interactions will identify novel therapeutic targets and facilitate the development of safe and effective analgesics.\n\nAssistant Professor, Biology and Biological Engineering\n\nB.S., Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nM.D., University of California, Los Angeles\n\nPh.D., California Institute of Technology\n\nViruses are in constant conversation with the cells they infect, and the information exchanged can be used by the host or the virus to guide their respective behaviors. For example, viruses may decide to become dormant after infection, while host cells may choose to activate an immune response. The Van Valen Lab listens in on this conversation to understand how viruses and their hosts represent information about their internal state and their environment, and how this information is accessed to make decisions. To do so, we combine ideas from cell biology and physics with recent advances in imaging, machine learning, and genomics to make novel measurements of host–virus interactions. Active projects include imaging the interaction between host immune and metabolic signaling networks during infection, measuring host–virus interactions in a model system of viral latency, and developing novel deep-learning approaches to single-cell analysis of biological imaging data.\n\nAssistant Professor, Molecular and Cellular Biology\n\nB.S., The University of Oklahoma\n\nPh.D., Baylor College of Medicine\n\nAmanda Whipple has been designated the Milton E. Cassel Scholar for the 2020 class of Rita Allen Foundation Scholars. This special award honors the memory of a longtime President of the Rita Allen Foundation who passed away in 2004.\n\nOur DNA represents the full library of genetic information each of us inherits from our parents. We inherit two copies of each gene—one from our mother and one from our father. Typically, the two copies are treated equally in the cell. However, the Whipple Lab studies a unique class of “imprinted genes,” in which only one parental copy is active (“expressed”) while the other is inactive (“silenced”). Many imprinted genes are expressed in the brain and are associated with diverse neurological disorders. Yet, the reasons for imprinted expression and the effects of imprinted gene activity in the brain remain largely unknown. We use molecular and bio-computational approaches to understand: (1) why genes evolved imprinted expression in the brain, (2) how imprinted genes function in neurons, and (3) how dysregulation of imprinted genes contributes to neurological diseases.\n\nAssistant Professor, Evolutionary Genetics and Genomics\n\nB.S., Inner Mongolia University, China\n\nPh.D., Chinese Academy of Sciences\n\nEach living species and every phylogenetic clade has a unique set of genes and phenotypes. Understanding how novel genes originate and subsequently evolve is crucial to explaining the genetic basis of novel phenotypes and ultimately the diversity of life. However, because the relationship between genes and phenotypes is complex and multidimensional, how and what type of genetic innovations contribute to novel organismal phenotypes remains largely unknown. Research in the Zhao Laboratory aims to understand the origination and evolution of molecular innovations as well as how they contribute to phenotypic innovation and adaptation. One of the focuses in the lab is to use de novo genes, which are genes that have originated from non-genic sequences of genomes, as a unique paradigm to tackle these questions. In the long-term, the Zhao lab aims to decipher the principles of gene origination and its underlying positive or negative impact on population dynamics and human health.\n\nAssistant Professor, Anesthesiology, Perioperative, and Pain Medicine\n\nB.Sc., McGill University\n\nM.D./Ph.D., Dartmouth College\n\nIn conjunction with the Open Philanthropy Project\n\nThe mission of the Tawfik Lab is to do the best clinically informed basic science research to advance our understanding of the neuroimmune contribution to chronic pain in a thoughtful manner, with our patients always in mind. We are particularly interested in understanding the unique underpinnings of various types of chronic pain and how central nervous system glial cells (astrocytes and microglia) contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain. Microglia are particularly interesting to us, as the macrophages of the central nervous system with known roles in synaptic pruning and neuroinflammation. Funding from the Open Philanthropy Project will allow us to dive more deeply into the contribution of spinal cord microglia using transgenic manipulations and microglial transcriptome analyses in a mouse model of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), a disease that affects the limbs after minor fracture, or surgery. We expect that our findings in this model will also extend to other forms of chronic pain and allow for the development of more specific glial-targeted therapeutics.\n\nAssistant Professor, Symptom Research\n\nB.S., University of Adelaide\n\nPh.D., University of Adelaide\n\nIn conjunction with the Open Philanthropy Project\n\nPain that becomes chronic and outlasts the period of healing is a major medical challenge. The Grace Lab investigates the neuroimmune interactions that drive chronic pain. After injury to sensory nerves, glial cells, such as microglia and astrocytes, are activated throughout the central nervous system. These activated glia secrete neurotransmitters and cytokines that increase the excitability of neurons in pain pathways. We are focused on the open question of how spinal cord astrocytes are persistently activated in such remote regions. This line of research is also being expanded to determine how activated glia in the brain also contribute to common comorbidities of chronic pain, including depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairments. The ultimate goal of this work is to find new ways to treat chronic pain.\n\nAssistant Professor, Anesthesiology\n\nB.S., University of Toronto Scarborough\n\nPh.D., University of Toronto\n\nOur research focuses on synaptic plasticity and neuromodulation within defined neural circuits in the ventral basal ganglia, a collection of brain structures involved in reward learning and selection of flexible behavior. Specifically, we ask how chronic pain, addictive drugs, or genetic mutations alter the function of these neural circuits, and how circuit dysfunction contributes to symptoms of chronic pain, substance use, and mood disorders. Our ultimate goal is to leverage insight from circuit studies to develop novel neuromodulation for these disorders, including deep brain stimulation and focused ultrasound. By first determining how neuronal and circuit adaptations drive specific behavioral symptoms of disease, we can establish a strategy for targeted circuit manipulation in a disease state. We then rationally design neuromodulation paradigms and validate them in model systems to provide novel strategies to treat symptoms at the interface of chronic pain, mood, and substance use disorders.\n\nAssistant Professor, Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology\n\nB.S., University of Michigan\n\nPh.D., University of California, San Francisco\n\nJosie Clowney has been designated the Milton E. Cassel Scholar for the 2019 class of Rita Allen Foundation Scholars. This special award honors the memory of a longtime President of the Rita Allen Foundation who passed away in 2004.\n\nOur bodies make direct contact with environment-derived molecules including volatiles, dietary nutrients, and microbial components. The evolutionary problem of detecting and responding to extraordinarily diverse exogenous compounds has been solved similarly in chemosensory, digestive, and immune systems, by the evolution of large families of cell surface and secreted proteins whose members each have limited binding affinities. The Clowney lab studies how these large gene families evolved; how they are coordinately regulated across cells; and, in the chemosensory system, how signals flowing through chemosensory receptors can be meaningfully interpreted to allow suitable behavioral responses. We are particularly interested in understanding the distinct biological mechanisms that allow reflexive responses to evolutionarily predicted stimuli versus flexible responses to arbitrary or evolutionarily unpredicted stimuli.\n\nAssistant Professor, Neurobiology\n\nB.S., University of the Sciences in Philadelphia\n\nPh.D., University of California, Berkeley\n\nOur perception of the world around us is heavily shaped by factors such as prior experience, expectations, attentional focus, and drugs—both therapeutic and recreational. Yet, how context influences sensory information processing in the brain is largely a mystery. The Banghart Lab aims to understand how the brain controls the perception of pain. Toward this goal, the lab studies the neural mechanisms that support both pharmacological analgesia (e.g. opioid painkillers), as well as “top-down” pain modulation, wherein pain suppression is driven purely by cognitive processes (e.g. placebo analgesia). By revealing the similarities and differences between the neural circuits and neurochemical signals that underlie these forms of pain modulation, this work may one day contribute to the development of new therapies.\n\nResearch Associate, Boston Children’s Hospital\n\nAssistant Professor of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School\n\nB.S., Environmental Science and Engineering, Tsinghua University\n\nM.S., Environmental Engineering, Duke University\n\nPh.D., Environmental Engineering and Microbiology, Northwestern University\n\nProject: How do signals from resident bacteria keep the intestines healthy?\n\nMotivated by a desire to advance strategies for environmental protection, Dingding An began her undergraduate education in environmental engineering at Tsinghua University in Beijing. She took many courses in chemistry and physics, but was increasingly drawn to biology. An’s research experience at Duke University helped her make this transition—she chose a laboratory that focused on the remediation of pollution by microbial processes, and discovered she had a keen interest in working with bacteria.\n\nIn her doctoral research, An explored how multiple species of bacteria grow, survive and compete in communities called biofilms, which are known for posing problems in food production and medicine. During the course of her Ph.D., she followed her mentor, Matthew Parsek, from Northwestern University to the University of Iowa, and finally to the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. This exposure to diverse biological research environments inspired An to pursue research on host-microbe interactions.\n\nAs a postdoctoral fellow in Dennis Kasper’s lab at Harvard Medical School, she began using mouse models to examine microbes that function not as pathogens, but as partners. She studied how bacteria living in the intestine modulate the immune system and protect the host from inflammatory bowel disease. An found that this protection is conferred in part by unique yet abundant bacterial molecules called sphingolipids. Now, An and her team are seeking a fuller understanding of sphingolipids in intestinal health. Their research will address why these bacterial signals seem to be important early in life, and how sphingolipids affect the production of mucus, which forms a critical barrier between bacterial cells and the host’s intestinal cells. “Eventually, I think we could identify specific sphingolipids produced by bacteria and use them as therapeutics to specifically help patients when they have a mucus production problem,” she says.\n\nKyle Baumbauer (Award in Pain Recipient) earned a B.S. in psychology and a B.A. in sociology from the University of Central Florida. He holds an M.A. and Ph.D. in experimental psychology from Kent State University, where he studied molecular mechanisms that allow neurons in the spinal cord to mediate learning and adaptation to the environment. This research contributed to an emerging view of the spinal cord not merely as a channel for signals traveling to and from the brain, but as a dynamic group of nerves with important effects on behavior. Baumbauer continued this area of research while a postdoctoral fellow at Texas A&M University, and explored how painful stimulation impacts spinal cord function to understand how the presence of pain affects the recovery of function after spinal cord injury. Baumbauer then did a second fellowship at the University of Pittsburgh, where he began examining the impact of injury and inflammation on peripheral sensory neuron function.\n\nIn 2014 Baumbauer joined the faculty at the University of Connecticut School of Nursing, where his research focuses on unraveling the relationship between alterations in gene expression and sensory neuron function, and how these processes contribute to chronic pain following spinal cord injury. Through these investigations, Baumbauer and his team aim to make advances that aid in the treatment of pathological pain. In addition to the Rita Allen Foundation Baumbauer’s research is supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. He is also a recipient of a Mary Lawrence Research Development Award from the UConn School of Nursing and has been honored as a Sigma Theta Tau Friend of Nursing.\n\nRichard Daneman has been designated the Milton E. Cassel Scholar for the 2017 class of Rita Allen Foundation Scholars. This special award honors the memory of a long-time President of the Rita Allen Foundation who passed away in 2004.\n\nAssistant Professor of Neuroscience and Pharmacology\n\nB.Sc., Biochemistry, McGill University\n\nPh.D., Developmental Biology, Stanford University\n\nProject: How does the blood–brain barrier influence the activities of neurons in the brain?\n\nRichard Daneman grew up in an academic family. His parents, a cognitive psychologist and a pediatric endocrinologist, sometimes enlisted him and his brother to serve as research subjects. From an early age, Daneman says, he was attracted to the “amazing adventure” of science: “I loved asking a question that had no answer and trying to work out different ways that you could solve a problem.” As an undergraduate, he got involved in projects to develop new laboratory techniques—to measure fine-scale pH changes within cells, and to analyze gene expression patterns in fruit flies.\n\nDaneman conducted graduate work at Stanford University with Ben Barres, a neurobiologist known for research on glial cells, which make up a large proportion of cells in the nervous system but are vastly understudied. The Barres lab was an ideal setting for Daneman to pursue another overlooked aspect of the nervous system: the blood–brain barrier. He led studies to identify molecular signals that give blood vessels in the central nervous system their unique properties—unlike the “leaky” blood vessels in other tissues, they restrict the movement of toxins, pathogens and immune cells.\n\nDaneman continued to focus on the blood–brain barrier during a fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco, and is now pursuing multiple questions related to the barrier’s development and its breakdown in conditions of injury or disease. He recently discovered physiological processes within the brain’s blood vessels that could influence the function of neurons. The Rita Allen Foundation award will allow Daneman and his team to examine the role of the blood–brain barrier in brain functioning. “We think of blood vessels as these tubes that run through the brain,” he says. “But the idea that they have these dynamic physiological properties that can fine-tune and manipulate the [neural] circuits—we know nothing about that.”\n\nArkady Khoutorsky (Award in Pain Recipient) earned a B.Sc. in biology and an M.Sc. in neurobiology, as well as D.V.M. and Ph.D. degrees, from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. During a postdoctoral fellowship at McGill University, Khoutorsky investigated how regulation of protein synthesis controls neuronal plasticity in the brain and in the pain pathway. He joined McGill’s Alan Edwards Centre for Research on Pain in 2016. In addition to the Rita Allen Foundation, Khoutorsky’s work is supported by the Canada Foundation for Innovation, and by a NARSAD Young Investigator Grant and a Louise and Alan Edwards Foundation Grant in Chronic Pain Research.\n\nKhoutorsky’s lab is examining how neuronal circuits in the spinal cord are remodeled to promote sensitivity to pain. He is interested in the extracellular matrix, a network of proteins that surrounds neurons. In the brain, this matrix appears to restrict the ability of neurons to form the new structures necessary for learning and memory. Enzymes that degrade the matrix are activated in some chronic pain conditions. Khoutorsky and his team are investigating how such degradation impacts spinal cord neurons that normally inhibit pain signals. They aim to determine how changes in the extracellular matrix might enable the neurons to become “hyperexcitable” and inappropriately propagate pain.\n\nAssistant Professor of Neurobiology\n\nB. Pharm., Philipps-University, Marburg, Germany\n\nM.Sc., Neuroscience, Martin-Luther-University, Halle, Germany\n\nPh.D., Neuroscience, Philipps-University, School of Medicine, Marburg, Germany\n\nProject: How can chronic stress change neural circuits and lead to depression?\n\nStephan Lammel has a longstanding interest in medicine, and began training as a pharmacist with the intention of taking over his family’s business. During his pharmacy residency, he grew frustrated with the limitations and side effects of currently available medications—particularly for neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia. Then he met a researcher, Jochen Roeper, who was studying how dopamine neurons degenerate in Parkinson’s disease.\n\nLammel was excited by the opportunity to explore the underlying neurobiology of the dopamine system, and to make discoveries that could guide more effective therapeutic approaches. He joined Roeper’s lab as a master’s student, and later pursued a Ph.D. His work helped to reveal diversity in the properties of dopamine-containing neurons. As a postdoctoral scholar in Robert Malenka’s lab at Stanford University, Lammel continued investigating dopamine neurons, including neural circuits involved in reward and motivation.\n\nWith support from the Rita Allen Foundation, Lammel and his team will apply new technologies to examine the mechanisms by which chronic stress can lead to depression. Better knowledge of these mechanisms is crucial to treating depression, he says, as today’s outdated therapies are effective for less than half of patients, and have many undesirable side effects. Lammel’s research group will follow changes in neural activity in freely moving animals over time, using methods such as optogenetics and in vivo calcium imaging to visualize changes in activity among specific populations of neurons. “If we understand the circuits in which these neurons are embedded, we can manipulate them in a more specific way and try to reverse some of the pathological changes in these circuits”, he explains. “Ultimately, we hope these manipulations can also reverse some of the symptoms of depression.”\n\nAssistant Professor of Neuroscience and Psychiatry, Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute\n\nA.B., Psychology and Biology, Harvard College\n\nPh.D., Neuroscience, The Rockefeller University\n\nM.D., Weill Cornell Medicine\n\nProject: What are the molecular mechanisms of working memory?\n\nAs an undergraduate, Conor Liston became fascinated by the science of learning and memory, and by larger questions of how the brain gives rise to consciousness. “One of the things that attracted me to neuroscience was the potential for discoveries that would transform the way we think about ourselves as people, and also could potentially transform the way we think about diagnosing and treating disorders of the brain,” he says.\n\nListon’s desire to improve the understanding and treatment of mental illness led him to pursue an M.D.-Ph.D. During his psychiatry residency at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, he also conducted postdoctoral research with Wen-Biao Gan at New York University, investigating how stress hormones affect neural connections critical for learning. This research fueled his interest in new technologies for visualizing and experimentally manipulating activity in the living brain, and led him to a fellowship at Stanford University. There, Liston worked in the laboratory of Karl Deisseroth, known as a pioneer of optogenetics—a technique for controlling and monitoring neurons using specific wavelengths of light. Liston used optogenetics and other new imaging methods to explore the neural circuitry of fear responses and reward-seeking behaviors.\n\nNow, Liston, an assistant professor of neuroscience in the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute, treats psychiatric patients in the clinic, and leads a research program on the neuroscience of learning, memory, stress and depression. Support from the Rita Allen Foundation will allow Liston and his team to investigate the basis of working memory—the type of memory that operates when we remember and call a phone number, but forget it a few hours later. Working memory “is both stable and robust enough to not be interfered with by irrelevant information in our environment, but also labile enough to be easily deleted and replaced with new information,” Liston explains. “That’s an interesting paradox: How does our brain register memories that have these two competing qualities?” He plans to examine how different subtypes of neurons interact to achieve this balance—and how it can be disrupted in conditions such as depression.\n\nAssistant Professor of Biochemistry\n\nB.S., Biopsychology and Cognitive Sciences, University of Michigan\n\nPh.D., Neuroscience, Northwestern University\n\nProject: How does a modification of RNA influence the brain’s development and activity?\n\nAs a child, Kate Meyer had ambitions of becoming a surgeon, and entered college on a premedical track. A course on abnormal psychology fueled her fascination with the brain’s complexity, and she switched her focus to neuroscience. She helped with a research project on the neural basis of taste, which involved “scoring rat behaviors for hours on end, and loving it,” she recalls. “I was super excited to do literally anything” in the laboratory, Meyer adds.\n\nShe sought further training in neuroscience as a Ph.D. student in Jill Morris’ lab at Northwestern University, where she investigated the expression pattern of a gene implicated in schizophrenia and assessed its role in the developing brain. During a postdoctoral fellowship with Samie Jaffrey at Weill Cornell Medical College, Meyer delved into the biology of RNA. She led a comprehensive analysis of an RNA modification called m6A—the methylation of adenosine residues, a chemical marker that can influence whether an RNA molecule is translated into protein. Using next-generation sequencing, Meyer and her colleagues showed that the modification is widespread among thousands of genes in mammals, and that its prevalence increases in the brain during development.\n\nIn her own laboratory at Duke, Meyer and her team are exploring how the m6A modification affects when and where genes are expressed—with special attention to how this regulation shapes the growth, connections and activities of neurons. Her goal, she says, is “to understand, all the way from the molecular level to the behavioral level, what happens if we manipulate this pathway that controls methylation. What are the consequences for things like learning and memory, or neurological disease?”\n\nSteve Davidson (Award in Pain Recipient) earned a B.S. in psychology from the University of New Orleans and a Ph.D. in neuroscience from the University of Minnesota. He was a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Anesthesiology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis from 2009 to 2014, and in 2015 he joined the faculty of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. In 2010, Davidson received a Future Leader in Pain Research award from the American Pain Society.\n\nPain has long been recognized as a multidimensional experience. Yet research has focused almost exclusively on the sensory dimension, leaving the emotional and motivational components poorly understood and undertreated. The Davidson lab seeks to elucidate and control a neural circuit responsible for regulating the capacity for pain tolerance, an aspect of pain behavior dependent on emotional and motivational pain processing that occurs in the brain. Davidson’s research tests the main hypothesis that effective pain control can be achieved by manipulating neural activity in a thalamo-limbic pathway to enhance pain tolerance. His laboratory has developed a novel operant behavioral model in which rodents may obtain a reward by engaging with (tolerating) a noxious thermal stimulus. Using this approach, analgesics with efficacy for improving the affective measure of pain tolerance vs. reflexive withdrawal may be determined. To determine whether thalamo-limbic projection neurons control pain, virally infected posterior thalamic neurons containing optically gated ion channels will allow direct control of activity through an implanted light source while animals are tested for changes to pain tolerance and reflexive behaviors. Finally, the Davidson lab will test the hypothesis that chronic pain alters synaptic plasticity in the thalamo-limbic circuit. This will include examination of posterior thalamic projection neurons for altered excitability and synaptic plasticity at the posterior thalamus-insula synapse in rodent models of neuropathic and inflammatory chronic pain.\n\nCamila dos Santos completed undergraduate, master’s and doctoral studies at the University of Campinas in Brazil. She was a postdoctoral fellow at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, as well as a postdoctoral fellow and research investigator at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory with Gregory Hannon, a 2000 Rita Allen Foundation Scholar and a member of the Foundation’s Scientific Advisory Committee. She became an assistant professor at CSHL in 2015. In addition to the Rita Allen Foundation award, dos Santos has received a Glen Cove Cares Research Award, a Pershing Square Foundation Scholar Award and a research award from the Manhasset Women’s Coalition Against Breast Cancer.\n\nThe dos Santos laboratory aims to uncover the molecular basis of pregnancy-induced breast cancer protection. In humans, a full-term pregnancy before the age of 25 is known to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer by more than one-third. In rodents, pregnancy can decrease the frequency of carcinogen-induced mammary tumors by more than 60 percent. A recent study by dos Santos and colleagues has shown that transitions through pregnancy lead to massive and stable reorganization of DNA methylation in mammary epithelial cells. Now they propose to further characterize this phenomenon by mapping genome-wide enhancer activity in this system. They will test the hypothesis that the parous (post-pregnancy) epigenome modulates the effects of breast cancer oncogenes on epithelial cell oncogenesis. In addition, they will investigate pharmacological strategies that mimic these effects, which may provide a path toward strategies for breast cancer prevention.\n\nMonica Dus (Milton E. Cassel Scholar) earned a B.S. in biology from the University of Redlands in Redlands, California, and a Ph.D. in the Watson School of Biological Sciences at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where she worked with Gregory Hannon, a 2000 Rita Allen Foundation Scholar and a member of the Foundation’s Scientific Advisory Committee. After a postdoctoral fellowship in Greg Suh’s lab at the New York University School of Medicine, she became an assistant professor at the University of Michigan in 2015. In addition to being a Rita Allen Foundation Scholar, Dus has received a Pathways to Independence K99/R00 Award from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, a NARSAD Young Investigator Grant from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation and a Klingenstein-Simons Fellowship Award in the Neurosciences.\n\nOne of the oldest debates in biology is that of nature versus nurture. Are our behaviors dictated by genes or by the environment? In the last decade it has become clear that neuroepigenetic processes play a key role in adult brain function by merging environmental information with ongoing brain processes to direct behavioral states. Disruption in these processes is linked to both normal and abnormal behaviors, such memory and addiction. However, the underlying mechanisms remain mysterious. In particular, we have no knowledge about the genetic loci of integration between the environment and behavior, or the identity of the neural pathways that control them in specific neural circuits. This presents a major roadblock to unlocking the molecular interface between brain and environment and the role it plays in brain function. To understand how the environment shapes and reprograms brain and behavior, the Dus lab exploits: 1) a simple behavior, eating, which is dependent on an experimentally controllable environment, diet; and 2) the fruit fly brain, which is orders of magnitude smaller than vertebrate brains, but shows conserved neurochemistry.\n\nKatherine Hanlon (Award in Pain Recipient) earned a B.S. in biochemistry and molecular biophysics and a Ph.D. in pharmacology from the University of Arizona, where she worked with Todd Vanderah. She went on to complete a postdoctoral fellowship in tumor immunology at the Mount Sinai Medical Center with Joshua Brody and Peter Heeger. In addition to her work in the lab, Hanlon currently teaches Biochemistry and Principles of Pharmacology in the School of Pharmacy at Presbyterian College and directs the College’s Office of Research. Her primary research interests include macrophage-neuron communication in pain processing and the role of tumor-associated macrophages in cancer development. She also studies the mechanisms of dysregulation of cannabinoid receptor signaling in tumor and immune cells in metastatic disease.\n\nStudies in the Hanlon lab are carried out using multiple in vitro and in vivo models, including leukocytes and neurons isolated from dorsal root ganglia, leukocytes and tumor cells isolated from murine mammary tumors, leukocytes harvested from post-surgical peritoneal adhesions, and human blood monocyte primary cultures. With the support of the Rita Allen Foundation and the American Pain Society, the lab is able to explore the communication that occurs between sensory neurons and macrophages (innate immune cells that are critical in injury response) in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Macrophages in the DRG are a unique population of cells that bear some resemblance to brain microglia, but are functionally distinct and exhibit specific phenotype differences. In response to peripheral injury, DRG macrophages respond to activity in the ascending pain pathways and may alter pain perception. By evaluating the phenotype and function of this unique population, Hanlon hopes to isolate novel and exploitable mechanisms that may be used to develop non-opioid therapeutics for the treatment of persistent pain.\n\nAlex Kentsis received undergraduate and master’s degrees from the University of Chicago, where he conducted research in the laboratory of Tobin Sosnick. He earned a Ph.D. from New York University, where he worked with Katherine Borden, and an M.D. from Mount Sinai School of Medicine, where his advisor was Roman Osman. He completed research and clinical fellowships at Boston Children’s Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, where he later became an attending physician, as well as an instructor at Harvard Medical School. He joined the faculties of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Weill Cornell Medical College in 2013. In addition to being a Rita Allen Foundation Scholar, Kentsis has received a Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Clinical Investigator Award, an American Society for Clinical Investigation Physician-Scientist Award, an American Society of Hematology Scholar Award and a Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award for Medical Scientists.\n\nGenome sequencing efforts have revealed a surprising dearth of gene mutations in many human cancers, suggesting that alternative oncogenic mechanisms must be investigated to identify targets for improved therapy. Approximately half of the human genome originates from mobile DNA elements, or transposons, but their contributions to human disease and physiology remain almost completely unexplored. Kentsis aims to investigate mechanisms of tumorigenesis by a novel human DNA transposase in embryonal tumors, lethal childhood cancers that are refractory to intensive chemotherapy. Successful completion of proposed studies promises to transform our ability to identify the drivers of human cancer, thus leading to improved targeted therapies for these refractory pediatric tumors. This work will also establish powerful tools for the investigation of DNA transposition and genomic plasticity, with transformative applications in wide areas of human biology.\n\nRELATED STORY: Foundation Scholars Earn NIH Awards for High-Risk, High-Reward Research\n\nBo Li earned her B.S. in biological sciences from Beijing University and her Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology at Harvard Medical School, where she worked with Christopher T. Walsh. She has received a a Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research Fellowship and a National Institutes of Health Pathway to Independence Award.\n\nLi’s lab identifies bioactive small molecules produced by bacteria—she and her colleagues explore the chemistry of their production and study the roles they play in the biology of bacteria and human hosts. Bacteria craft these gene-encoded molecules from primary metabolites using complex chemical transformations; the structures and activities of these small molecules have been optimized through millions of years of evolution and enable these molecules to mediate extensive microbe-microbe and microbe-host interactions. Li’s multidisciplinary research program uses bacterial genomics and metabolomics as enabling technologies to identify novel bacterial small molecules. First, her team is identifying small molecules from soil bacteria as novel antibiotics to combat multidrug-resistant pathogens; second, they are identifying metabolites produced by the human gut microbiota to unravel the chemical and molecular mechanisms of bacterial symbiosis and pathogenesis. Her work involves understanding fundamental biosynthetic mechanisms and extends to exploiting bacterial small molecules to improve human health and prevent disease.\n\nKatharina Schlacher obtained her B.S. in microbiology at the Karl-Franzens University in Graz, Austria. For graduate studies, in 2003 she joined the lab of Myron Goodman at the University of Southern California, where she earned her Ph.D. While there, she discovered an unprecedented transactivation mechanism for mutagenic E. coli DNA polymerase V by proteobacter recombinase RecA, recognized by the USC College Doctoral Research Prize. In 2007, as a Damon Runyon Postdoctoral Fellow, Schlacher joined Maria Jasin at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and Hong Wu at the University of California, Los Angeles, to focus on her passion for mechanisms at the replication fork. She discovered a novel genomic instability and tumor suppressor mechanism at the DNA replication fork distinct from DNA repair. Specifically, Fanconi anemia proteins BRCA1/2 protect stalled DNA replication forks from degradation by MRE11. This replication fork protection discovery was recognized with the Parvin Foundation Award for academic excellence, the UCLA/Molecular Biology Institute Research Excellence Award and the MSKCC Postdoctoral Research Award. Schlacher received a National Cancer Institute K22 award and joined the faculty at MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2014.\n\nSchlacher’s research focuses on developing an in-depth molecular and biological understanding of how replication fork protection suppresses cancer and disease to obtain biological insights suitable to develop disease prevention and treatment strategies.\n\nMinoree Kohwi’s interest in brain development started as an undergraduate in Mark Konishi’s lab at the California Institute of Technology. She earned a Ph.D. in Arturo Alvarez-Buylla’s lab at the University of California, San Francisco. As a postdoc in Chris Doe’s lab at the University of Oregon, she discovered that the 3-D organization of the neural progenitor genome changes during development, determining which genes can be activated, and thus, which cell types can be generated. Now at Columbia, Kohwi is excited to embark on a journey into nuclear architecture and stem cell competence to ask fundamental questions about the origin of neural diversity during brain development.\n\nThe brain’s complexity is apparent from the incredible diversity of its neural cell types. To form the functional circuitry governing our cognitive and motor functions, neural progenitors must make each cell type at the right place, time and abundance. In both insects and mammals, stem/progenitor cells typically produce different cell types in a stereotyped order, and over the course of development they lose the ability to make the earlier-born cell types. Such “loss of competence” is a prominent feature of neural progenitors, although the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Using Drosophila, Kohwi and her colleagues discovered that neural progenitors undergo a developmentally timed reorganization of their genome that physically relocates genes within the 3-D nuclear space and affects the genes’ ability to turn on or off. They found that such gene repositioning in neural progenitors is highly regulated, and determines the progenitors’ potential to make specific cell types at each developmental stage. They aim to examine how neural progenitor nuclear architecture is regulated developmentally and how this regulation contributes to neural diversity. These results will provide new insights into brain development, neural developmental disorders and brain repair.\n\nYevgenia Kozorovitskiy earned B.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Princeton University, where she worked with Elizabeth Gould to study social experience-induced structural plasticity in the adult rodent and primate brain. She conducted postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Bernardo Sabatini at Harvard Medical School, where she investigated neural activity and neuromodulation in developmental wiring of basal ganglia circuits. She joined the faculty of Northwestern University in 2014. In addition to being a Rita Allen Foundation Scholar, Kozorovitskiy is the recipient of a Public Voices Fellowship and a Cornew Innovation Award from Northwestern University, a Sloan Research Fellowship and a Searle Scholar Award.\n\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a tremendous mental health burden, with a lifetime incidence of more than 15 percent. A great promise for MDD treatment, especially for resistant and suicidal patients, lies in rapidly acting antidepressants. Yet the neurobiological plasticity mechanisms underlying rapid antidepressant effects remain poorly understood. Kozorovitskiy’s research group takes a multipronged approach to studying synapses and neural circuits implicated in depression and affect. First, they are evaluating whether rapidly acting antidepressant drugs and their functionally relevant metabolites directly facilitate the production of new synapses on genetically targeted neurons. Preliminary data indicate that the effects of rapidly acting antidepressants on synapses occur on a slower time scale and have a broader reach than expected, transcending the neural circuits typically implicated in depression. Second, interrogating neuromodulatory circuits implicated in regulation of affective state, they have discovered and characterized an important new direct interaction between dopamine, an amine important for reward-based learning, and oxytocin, a neuropeptide relevant to social affect, bonding and reproduction. Third, to facilitate the imaging of diffraction-limited nanoscale architecture of synapses, they have collaborated to develop a new imaging method that combines the strengths of two-photon excitation with structured illumination.\n\nJulie Law received a B.S. in biochemistry and biophysics from Oregon State University, where she conducted research in the laboratory of Walter Ream. She earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where she worked with Barbara Sollner-Webb. Following a postdoctoral fellowship with Steven Jacobsen at the University of California, Los Angeles, Law joined the faculty of the Salk Institute in 2012. In addition to being a Rita Allen Foundation Scholar, she is a recipient of a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award from the National Institutes of Health and an L&L Nippert Charitable Foundation grant. In 2015 she was named a Hearst Foundation Development Chair at Salk.\n\nUnderstanding how cells maintain genome stability is a fundamental biological question of relevance to reproductive health; numerous human diseases, including cancer; and crop yields. While it is known that modifications to chromatin (either in the form of nucleosome remodeling or the addition of chemical modifications to DNA and/or histones) play critical roles in maintaining genome stability, how they accomplish this feat remains unclear. Since mutations affecting chromatin structure in mammals are often lethal, answering such mechanistic questions requires a comparable, but more robust system, such as the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana. Indeed, the best characterized connection between chromatin and genome stability is a phenomenon first characterized in plants, wherein DNA methylation prevents the perilous movement of transposons within the genome by silencing their expression. The Law lab has described a family of Arabidopsis chromatin remodeling factors, CLSY1-4, that affect small RNA biogenesis, DNA methylation-mediated transposon silencing and DNA repair—revealing new links between several pathways critical for genome stability. Given the dual roles of the CLSY proteins, they propose to utilize these factors to dissect the connections between chromatin and genome stability. Such studies will shed light not only how DNA damage is normally repaired, but also on how chromatin-based defects cause genome instability.\n\nRELATED STORY: Rita Allen Foundation Scholar Examines Zika Virus Infection of Brain Cells\n\nJohn Schoggins (Milton E. Cassel Scholar) earned his B.S. in chemistry from the University of Rochester and his Ph.D. in molecular biology from the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences. He was a postdoctoral fellow in virology/infectious disease at The Rockefeller University, and has been on the faculty at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas since 2012. In addition to being a Rita Allen Foundation Milton E. Cassel Scholar, he has been named a Nancy Cain and Jeffrey A. Marcus Scholar in Medical Research, in Honor of Dr. Bill S. Vowell, at UT Southwestern Medical Center and a Clayton Foundation Scholar. He has also received the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award from the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the NIH New Innovator Award, and both the Sidney and Joan Pestka Award for Excellence in Interferon Research and the Seymour and Vivian Milstein Young Investigator Award from the International Cytokine and Interferon Society.\n\nInterferons are among the first lines of defense against viral infection. The interferon-induced antiviral state is established by the transcription of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes, many of which have direct antiviral effector functions. Previous screening efforts in Schoggins’ lab identified interferon alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6) as an inhibitor of yellow fever virus and dengue virus infection. His group has shown that IFI6 is inhibitory toward multiple flaviviruses, in some cases reducing viral titers 1,000-fold. Strikingly, this antiviral effect is highly specific, since the closely related hepatitis C virus is not inhibited. CRISPR-mediated deletion of IFI6 results in a strong attenuation of interferon sensitivity, suggesting that IFI6 plays a major role in the antiviral response during flavivirus infections. Using a variety of molecular virological and cell biological approaches, Schoggins’ team has shown that the mechanism of IFI6 action is inhibition of viral genome replication, but not earlier steps in the viral life cycle. They are currently addressing a potential role for flavivirus NS1 protein as a target of IFI6 action. In preliminary studies, ectopic expression of NS1 was able to rescue viral infection from the inhibitory effects of IFI6. These findings uncover a novel interferon-stimulated gene that potently and selectively inhibits replication of several important disease-causing flaviviruses.\n\nRobert Sorge (Award in Pain Recipient) earned his Honors B.Sc. in psychology from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, his M.A. in experimental psychology from Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, and his Ph.D. in psychology from Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec. He was a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University before joining the faculty at The University of Alabama at Birmingham in 2012. In addition to being named a Rita Allen Foundation Pain Scholar, he has received a Young Investigator Award from the Sex, Gender and Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain. He also has received postdoctoral fellowships from the Alan Edwards Center for Research on Pain at McGill and from the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.\n\nObesity in America is reaching epidemic proportions, with more than one-third of the population classified as obese, and even more as overweight. In addition to the increased risk for metabolic syndromes and cardiovascular disease, obesity is also comorbid with chronic pain for a significant number of patients. It is known that adipose tissue and components of the American diet can contribute to a chronic proinflammatory state that may predispose individuals to significant negative health effects. Sorge and his collaborators believe that this state is the result of heightened activity of the immune system. Their previous work has shown that consumption of a Western diet results in changes in acute sensitivity to stimuli, increased systemic inflammation and prolonged recovery from injury. These effects are believed to be the result of chronic immune cell activation in the peripheral and central nervous system. Current work is underway to investigate the temporal profile of immune cell activation following differential exposure to the American diet in rodents. Through examination of the immune-related impact of diet, it may be possible to formulate treatments that will reduce the negative effects of the American diet with respect to pain and other related inflammatory conditions.\n\nJeremy Wilusz received his Ph.D. from the Watson School of Biological Sciences at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and performed postdoctoral studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His research addresses the mechanisms by which noncoding RNAs are generated, regulated and function. Wilusz has been the recipient of the RNA Society/Scaringe Young Scientist Award, the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Postdoctoral Fellowship and the National Institutes of Health Pathway to Independence Award.\n\nIt was long assumed that eukaryotic precursor mRNAs (pre-mRNAs) are almost always spliced to generate a linear mRNA that is then translated to produce a protein. However, recent deep sequencing studies have revealed thousands of protein-coding genes that are non-canonically spliced to produce circular RNAs with covalently linked ends. Some RNA circles are expressed at much higher levels than their associated linear mRNAs, suggesting that the main function of some genes may be to produce circular noncoding RNAs, not proteins. Wilusz’s research aims to reveal (i) how the choice between linear versus circular RNA production is made, (ii) how circular RNAs function and (iii) how misregulation of circular RNAs contributes to human cancer. As part of these efforts, his team has shown that circular RNA biogenesis is often initiated when complementary sequences from two different introns base-pair to one another. This brings the splice sites from the intervening exon(s) into close proximity to facilitate the backsplicing event that generates the circular RNA.They have used this knowledge to make plasmids that efficiently circularize exons in vivo, allowing them to begin to identify novel roles for circular RNAs in normal and cancer cells.\n\nYi Ye (Award in Pain Recipient) holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience from the University of Wyoming, a master’s degree in clinical research from New York University and an M.B.A. from NYU’s Stern School of Business. She was a research fellow in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery in the College of Dentistry at the University of California, San Francisco, and joined the Bluestone Center as an associate research scientist in 2010. She has been in her current position since 2015. She has received a Travel Award and a Young Investigator Award from the International Association for the Study of Pain, and was awarded both a National Institutes of Health-NYU-Clinical and Translational Science Institute Scholarship and an NYU Whitehead Fellowship in 2015.\n\nYe’s research aims to understand the neurobiological basis of cancer pain, with additional focus on carcinogenesis and tumor progression in head and neck cancer. The ultimate goal of her research is to develop novel therapies that can be used for both cancer and pain treatment by targeting shared mechanisms. In progression toward this goal, she directs a translational research program that uses multiple approaches including in vitro cell culture, animal models and human studies.\n\nLei Ding completed his undergraduate studies at Peking University, and earned a Ph.D. at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where he worked with Min Han. He was a postdoctoral fellow in Sean Morrison’s laboratory at the University of Michigan and The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. He joined the faculty of Columbia University in 2013.\n\nA lifelong supply of blood and immune cells depends on self-renewing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). How HSCs self-renew is a fundamental question with broad implications for understanding development, regeneration, cancer and aging of the blood system. HSC self-renewal is regulated by cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms. The Ding laboratory is interested in these mechanisms, particularly extrinsic mechanisms that regulate blood-forming HSC self-renewal and maintenance. Prior work has identified bone marrow perivascular mesenchymal stromal cells as a critical component of the niche.\n\nDing’s group is studying the extrinsic regulation of HSCs in three distinct, yet closely related, areas: 1) regulation of bone marrow perivascular mesenchymal stromal cells; 2) the cellular component of the fetal liver HSC niche; and 3) the contribution of the niche to the pathogenesis of hematological diseases. They are in the process of characterizing several candidate factors that may regulate the fate of bone marrow perivascular stromal cells. They are also elucidating the roles of several candidate niche cell types in fetal livers. In addition, their data suggest that bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells are critical contributors to a hematopoietic malignancy, myelofibrosis, providing a cellular target to better treat the disease. HSC-based bone marrow transplantation is widely used in clinics to treat hematological diseases. Ding and his team hope to apply their knowledge to better harness the power of HSCs.\n\nMolly Hammell (Milton E. Cassel Scholar) holds a B.S. in physics from the College of William and Mary and a Ph.D. in physics and astronomy from Dartmouth College. The Hammell lab specializes in developing novel computational algorithms for the analysis and integration of high-throughput genomics datasets and applying these to questions of human disease. Hammell has a broad background in small RNA biology and gene regulatory network analysis, transposon biology and genomics, as well as extensive experience in the statistical analysis of next-generation sequencing data. As a postdoctoral fellow working with Victor Ambros at Dartmouth Medical School and the University of Massachusetts Medical School, she developed new algorithms to identify the targets and pathways regulated by microRNAs in animals and to profile the dynamics of small RNA activity across development. Her lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory has expanded on these efforts to map the role of both microRNAs and transposon-targeting piRNAs and siRNAs in animals. This includes efforts to establish the molecular mechanisms by which transposons are controlled in somatic tissues. This also includes a major project to profile the genomes and transcriptomes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patient samples in order to understand the extent to which transposons contribute to neurodegenerative disease in patients.\n\nOur genomes are filled with viral-like sequences called transposons, many of which are capable of creating new copies of themselves that can reintegrate elsewhere in the genome, altering the function of nearby genes. While most transposon sequences are now-defunct remnants of ancient genomic parasites, a small fraction of these are still capable of activating themselves, creating genomic instability and crippling cellular function. The Hammell lab and others have discovered a link between the activity of these transposon sequences and neurodegenerative diseases related to misfunction of the RNA binding protein TDP-43 (ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration). However, much remains unknown about how transposons are controlled in somatic tissues such as the brain, and the extent to which their activity contributes to neurodegenerative disease. Hammell’s group is working to elucidate the connections between transposon activity and TDP-43 related diseases.\n\nGregory Scherrer (Award in Pain Recipient) earned his Ph.D. in cellular and molecular biology from the University of Strasbourg, France. He completed postdoctoral training at the University of California, San Francisco, and at Columbia University. He joined the faculty at the Stanford University School of Medicine in 2012. In addition to a Rita Allen Foundation Scholar award, he has received an International Association for the Study of Pain Postdoctoral Fellowship, National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Drug Abuse K99R00 Pathway to Independence and R01 Awards, a Department of Defense Neurosensory Research Award, and an International Narcotics Research Conference Young Investigator Award, and most recently was named a New York Stem Cell Foundation – Robertson Neuroscience Investigator.\n\nThe members of the Scherrer Laboratory investigate how the nervous system generates the sensory and affective dimensions of pain experience and opioid analgesia to discover novel analgesic therapies. They aim to identify the pathological changes that occur within neural circuits when chronic pain develops, at the neural network, cellular and molecular levels. One of their approaches is to gain understanding of how our endogenous opioid system modulates pain thresholds. Opioid receptors mediate the effects of opioid painkillers, such as morphine. By determining how opioids generate analgesia and detrimental side effects (e.g., tolerance, addiction, respiratory depression), Scherrer and his team hope to develop more efficient and safer analgesics for the treatment of chronic pain. These studies will also identify novel approaches to counteract opioid side effects and battle the current opioid epidemic. To reach these goals, Scherrer’s research combines a variety of experimental approaches, including molecular and cellular biology, neuroanatomy, electrophysiology, opto- and pharmacogenetics, in vivo calcium imaging and behavior.\n\nLin Tian holds a B.S. in neuroscience from the University of Science and Technology of\n\nChina and a Ph.D. in biochemistry, molecular and cell biology from Northwestern University. She completed postdoctoral training at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Janelia Farm Research Campus, where she developed a toolbox of ultrasensitive neural activity sensors that have been widely utilized. Her current work is a combination of neural activity sensor development and applications. Tian has received the National Institutes of Health Director’s New Innovator Award, Human Frontier Science Program Young Investigator Grant, Hartwell Foundation Individual Biomedical Research Award and NIH BRAIN Initiative grants.\n\nThe altered dynamics of synaptic transmission have been implicated in a number of human neurological and psychiatric diseases, including Parkinson’s, schizophrenia and addiction. However, how complex patterns of neural activity at multiple synapses interact to drive changes in circuit connectivity remains poorly defined. To address this question, we must determine the spatiotemporal relationships of different types of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators with synaptic resolution in a defined circuitry. Recent breakthroughs in modern microscopy and protein-based fluorescence sensors hold great promise to access synaptic transmission with needed molecular and cell type specificity and spatiotemporal resolutions. Tian and her collaborators have generated a sensor for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and demonstrated its utility for detection of fast signaling events in worm, fish, fly and mouse. To further expand the kinds of neural activity that can be measured with genetically encoded indicators, they applied the established sensor design and optimization platform to the development of a set of specific, targetable and sensitive sensors for direct measurement of neurotransmitters, including gamma-aminobutyric acid and the biogenic amines. Application of these imaging tools will enable neuroscientists to obtain a dynamic and comprehensive view of synaptic transmission in action to decipher the codes for transferring information across neural circuitry and systems.\n\nRELATED STORY: Rita Allen Foundation Scholars Reveal Biological Forces That Underlie Responses to Change\n\nTuan Trang (Award in Pain Recipient) began his research career as an undergraduate at Queen’s University studying the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. He also completed a Ph.D. in pharmacology and toxicology there, researching the spinal mechanisms of opioid analgesia with the goal of developing new pharmacological strategies for improving pain therapy. He pursued postdoctoral training as a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Salter at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. He has received a CIHR New Investigator Award, and young investigator awards from the Canadian Association for Neuroscience and Canadian Society for Pharmacology and Therapeutics. His research has been supported by grants from, in addition to the Rita Allen Foundation, the CIHR, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, a Vi Riddell Pain Grant from the University of Calgary and the Canada Foundation for Innovation.\n\nOpioids are among the most powerful and widely prescribed drugs for treating pain. However, a major problem in terminating opioid pain therapy is the debilitating withdrawal syndrome that can plague chronic opioid users. The mechanisms involved in opioid withdrawal are poorly understood, and the limited clinical strategies for treating withdrawal are ineffective. Trang and his collaborators have identified the pannexin-1 (Panx1) channel as a novel therapeutic target for treating morphine withdrawal. They discovered that morphine treatment induces synaptic plasticity in spinal lamina I/II neurons, which manifests as long-term synaptic facilitation upon naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal. This synaptic facilitation is critically gated by activation of Panx1 channels expressed on microglia. Pharmacologically blocking Panx1, or genetically ablating this channel specifically from microglia, blocked spinal synaptic facilitation and alleviated the behavioral sequelae of morphine withdrawal. Their findings together reveal a novel mechanism by which microglia signal through Panx1 to produce the cellular and behavioral corollary of withdrawal. Thus, targeting Panx1 represents a potential novel therapeutic approach for treating the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Trang and his team are moving these discoveries into the clinic by building on the utility of probenecid as a unique and practical therapy for the management of opioid withdrawal. In a pilot clinical trial, they will test whether probenecid alleviates opioid withdrawal in patients undergoing opioid tapering, a systematic and gradual approach intended to reduce or discontinue opioid use.\n\nMichael Boyce obtained his B.A. in biochemistry from Harvard College and his Ph.D. in cell biology from Harvard Medical School in the laboratory of Ying Yuan. He performed postdoctoral research in chemical biology and glycobiology at the University of California, Berkeley, with Carolyn Bertozzi, and has been an Assistant Professor of Biochemistry at the Duke University School of Medicine since 2012. Boyce has received fellowships or career awards from the Albert J. Ryan Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the Life Sciences Research Foundation/Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Whitehead Scholars Program, the Sydney Kimmel Foundation for Cancer Research and the Mizutani Foundation for Glycoscience, in addition to his 2013 Rita Allen Foundation Scholar award. Boyce is also active in promoting diversity and inclusion in the biosciences and serves on the national Minorities Affairs Committee of the American Society for Cell Biology.\n\nThe long-term goal of the Boyce lab is to understand the role of protein glycosylation in mammalian cell signaling and physiology. Protein glycosylation is the most abundant post-translational modification in nature and, as a sugar-based modification it lies at the nexus of cell signaling and cell metabolism. However, because glycosylation is a dynamic, non-templated and chemically complex process, it can be difficult to study with conventional biological techniques alone. The lab uses a range of biochemical, cell, chemical and structural biology methods to dissect the role of protein glycosylation in mammalian cells. Current work focuses on two specific aspects of glycosylation: first, understanding how dynamic signaling by O-linked b-N-acetylglucosamine on intracellular proteins senses and regulates cell physiology; and second, investigating the cell- and systems-level regulation of nucleotide-sugar metabolites in health and disease.\n\nSophie Dumont (Milton E. Cassel Scholar) received her B.A. in physics from Princeton University, and Ph.D. in biophysics from the University of California, Berkeley, where she probed the mechanics of individual biomolecules with Carlos Bustamante. She was a junior fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows and a postdoc at Harvard Medical School, where she worked on the mechanics of cell division with Tim Mitchison. She has been an assistant professor at UCSF since 2012, and her group focuses on the self-organization and emergent mechanics that drive robust chromosome segregation. In addition to being a Rita Allen Foundation Scholar, she is a Searle Scholar, a Sloan Research Fellow, and a National Institutes of Health New Innovator and National Science Foundation CAREER award recipient.\n\nLife is a chemical as well as a mechanical process. At the nanometer scale, mechanoenzymes interconvert force and chemical potential. At the micrometer scale, cells spatially organize their constituents, change shape and move. At the millimeter scale, organisms develop and also move. How are mechanical and chemical processes integrated over molecular, cellular and tissue-length scales?\n\nThe Dumont lab aims to understand how cells coordinate mechanical and chemical activities to equally distribute their genetic material when they divide. During cell division, each daughter cell must inherit exactly one copy of each chromosome. Errors can lead to cell death or cancer in somatic cells, and developmental disorders in the germ line. How do cells generate, detect and respond to mechanical force to robustly and accurately segregate their chromosomes? How do the spindle’s nanometer-scale constituents work together to generate micrometer-scale movements?\n\nTo address these questions, the Dumont lab uses an interdisciplinary approach to uncover how molecules, mechanics and cellular function relate to each other.\n\nElena Gracheva received an M.S. in biochemistry from Moscow State University and a Ph.D. in neuroscience from the University of Illinois at Chicago, where she worked with Janet Richmond. She conducted postdoctoral research at the University of California, San Francisco, in the laboratory of David Julius. She joined the faculty of the Yale University School of Medicine in 2012. In addition to being a Rita Allen Foundation Scholar, Gracheva has received a Yale Scholar Award in Neuroscience, an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation research fellowship and a Beckman Foundation Young Investigator award.\n\nThe main goal of Gracheva’s lab is to understand the molecular basis of temperature sensitivity under normal, adaptive and pathological conditions. Her early work concerned acute temperature perception in infrared-sensing animals. She and her colleagues discovered two receptors that are responsible for this function, as well as structural elements within ion channels that dictate activation by temperature and chemicals. Her research group is using non-standard animal models—hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrels and Syrian hamsters—to delineate molecular and cellular aspects of somatosensitivity, with a focus on temperature tolerance. They are investigating the contribution of different ion channels to cold tolerance of mammalian hibernators using a multidisciplinary approach, which includes electrophysiology, molecular biology, imaging, behavioral paradigms, genomics, transcriptomics and bioinformatics. Recently, Gracheva’s group discovered a molecular mechanism that supports nerve tissue function during hibernation.\n\nWilliam Greenleaf received an A.B. in physics from Harvard University, and received a Gates Fellowship to study computer science for one year at Trinity College in Cambridge, England. After this experience abroad, he returned to Stanford to carry out his Ph.D. in applied physics in the laboratory of Steven Block, where he investigated, at the single-molecule level, the chemo-mechanics of RNA polymerase and the folding of RNA transcripts. He conducted postdoctoral work in the laboratory of Xiaoliang Sunney Xie at Harvard University, where he was awarded a Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Fellowship, and developed new fluorescence-based high-throughput sequencing methodologies. Since moving to Stanford in 2011, he has been named a Baxter Foundation Scholar, as well as a Rita Allen Foundation Scholar. In addition to his position in the Department of Genetics, Greenleaf holds a courtesy appointment in Stanford’s Department Applied Physics. He is a member of Bio-X, the Biophysics Program, the Biomedical Informatics Program and the Cancer Center. He is also a participating member in a number of large genomic consortia (CEGS, GGR).\n\nHigh-throughput sequencing techniques are revolutionizing biology and promise to have a significant impact on the future of medicine. Greenleaf’s research interests focus on leveraging high-throughput methods to understand “the physical genome” by developing methods to probe both 1) the relationship between DNA sequence and the structure and function of molecules encoded by the genome; as well as 2) the physical compaction and folding of the genome itself, and how this topology influences biological state. 1) His research group is interested in understanding the biophysical basis and evolutionary consequences of sequence-function relationships in biological molecules and their interactions. Toward this goal, they develop ultra-high-throughput methods to quantitatively assay sequence-space in bulk and single-molecule experiments. 2) They also seek to understand the hierarchical folding of genomic DNA into regulated structures, the most basic and important of which is the nucleosome. With this objective in mind, they have developed methods that assay open chromatin, nucleosome positions and transcription factor binding genome-wide in small populations of cells undergoing dynamic processes such as differentiation or stochastic state switching.\n\nRELATED STORY: Rita Allen Foundation Scholars Advance Understanding of Nervous Systems in Health and Disease\n\nRebecca Seal (Award in Pain Recipient) earned her B.S. in chemistry and psychology from the University of Oregon and her Ph.D. in neuroscience from Oregon Health and Science University. Her graduate studies with Susan Amara focused on the structure and function of plasma membrane glutamate transporters. As a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, San Francisco, she studied the vesicular glutamate transporter 3 in hearing and pain with Robert Edwards. She has received a NARSAD Young Investigator Grant from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation, an Innovation Award from the American Diabetes Association, a Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science Fellowship and a Whitehall Foundation Research Award.\n\nSeal’s laboratory focuses on defining the neural circuitry underlying a wide range of nervous system functions in health and disease, including persistent pain, motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and audition. A major impediment to identifying new pain treatments is incomplete understanding of the neural networks and mechanisms that underlie the pain. Her team’s work, using multiple approaches ranging from cellular and molecular to physiological and behavioral, centers on elucidating the neural circuits and mechanisms that underlie a particular form of persistent pain in which touch becomes painful in the setting of injury, termed mechanical allodynia. The spinal cord dorsal horn is a major site for the integration of somatosensory information and is vital for the induction and maintenance of this form of pain. Their work thus far suggests that the pain is encoded by distinct microcircuits in the dorsal horn, depending on the nature of the injury. This concept not only has important implications for understanding at a basic level how the nervous system encodes mechanical allodynia, but also highlights the need to consider etiology in the design and implementation of therapeutic strategies.\n\nRELATED STORY: Rita Allen Foundation Scholars Reveal Biological Forces That Underlie Responses to Change\n\nReza Sharif-Naeini (Award in Pain Recipient) earned his Ph.D. in physiology from McGill University in 2007, and returned there to joined the faculty in 2012. In the interim, he was a postdoctoral fellow at Institut Pharmacologie Moleculare et Cellulaire in Nice, France, and in the Department of Anatomy at the University of California, San Francisco. He has received fellowships from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the International Association for the Study of Pain and the Human Frontier Science Program. He has also received the CIHR Brain Star Award for excellence in research and the Peter and Patricia Gruber International Research Award in Neuroscience from the Society for Neuroscience.\n\nChronic neuropathic pain (NeP) is a debilitating disease that follows nerve injury and persists long after the initial injury has subsided. Despite the plethora of medications and treatment modalities, NeP remains a disease with unmet medical needs that significantly decreases patients’ quality of life. Spontaneous pain and mechanical allodynia, two hallmarks of NeP, are due in part to a spinal cord dysfunction characterized by a decrease in inhibitory neurotransmission (or inhibitory tone). Our understanding of how these inhibitory mechanisms function in health and disease remains, however, limited. This indicates a need for novel and innovative experimental approaches to gain a better understanding of inhibitory circuits in the dorsal horn and how changes in these circuits can precipitate NeP symptoms. Sharif-Naeini’s group is interested in understanding the function of these inhibitory pathways using transgenic mouse lines combined with opto/pharmacogenetic approaches.\n\nRELATED STORIES: Rita Allen Foundation Scholar Harnesses Sound Waves to Activate Brain Cells, Rita Allen Foundation Scholars Reveal Biological Forces That Underlie Responses to Change\n\nSreekanth Chalasani obtained a B.S. degree and an advanced diploma in computer science from Osmania University in Hyderabad, India. He then did research at the National Center for Biological Sciences in Bangalore, India, before coming to the U.S. in 1997. Chalasani obtained a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, where he worked with Jonathan Raper, and did postdoctoral research in Cornelia Bargmann’s laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco, and The Rockefeller University. He started his laboratory at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in 2010. In addition to the Rita Allen Foundation award, Chalasani has received awards including a Blavatnik Award for Young Scientists, a Basil O’Connor Starter Award from the March of Dimes, and a W.M. Keck Foundation Award.\n\nChalasani’s research addresses how the brain responds to changes in its surrounding environment. Neural circuits within the brain extract relevant information from the environment and regulate behaviors on timescales ranging from seconds to hours. A complete understanding of this process requires an ability to identify, record and manipulate all the participating neurons. It is difficult to obtain this level of access in a complex vertebrate brain. Chalasani’s group is using the nematode C. elegans, with its small, well-defined nervous systems, to decode the cellular and molecular mechanisms transforming environmental changes into behaviors. They have shown that C. elegans can evaluate the size of a patch of bacteria (its food) and uses that information to modify a behavior that lasts many minutes. In particular, they have identified sensory neurons that encode the size of a food patch by detecting large, but not small, changes in food. Moreover, they show that information about patch size is stored in the level of dopamine in the circuit, which acts to modify downstream sensory and interneurons. Also, they find that the rate of acquiring information is controlled by the amount of CREB protein in key interneurons in the circuit.\n\nChristopher Hammell (Milton E. Cassel Scholar) attended the University of Georgia, where he received a B.S. degree in biochemistry. He then moved to Dartmouth Medical School, where he studied the mechanisms by which mRNA molecules are exported from the nucleus. After receiving his Ph.D., he began work with Victor Ambros at the University of Massachusetts, investigating how animals regulate the activity of microRNAs during development. He discovered a family of proteins, the TRIM-NHL family, that physically associate with and modulate the activity of the microRNA-induced silencing complex.\n\nHammell then began his independent research program at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where he switched his focus toward understanding how the temporal precision of developmental events is established. His current work centers on determining the regulatory architectures that ensure that developmental genes are turned on and off at the correct times.\n\nMichael Jankowski (Award in Pain Recipient) earned an M.S. in neuroscience and a Ph.D. in neurobiology from the University of Pittsburgh, where he also conducted postdoctoral research. He joined the faculty of the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center in 2011.
