        "text": "The Foundation Games were approved by the WIAA Executive Board as an option in lieu of budget cuts to foundation-related items such as District Insurance, grants to Affiliate organizations (WSSAAA, WSCA, WOA, etc.), Just Play Fair Sportsmanship Program, LEAP Committee, Hall of Fame, etc.\n\nThe Foundation Games allow for one (1) additional game, beyond the season limitations, in the sports of; basketball, volleyball, soccer, baseball and softball. Each sport has a specific “rights” fee tied to the additional game. The rights fee grants the school permission to schedule this additional game. Rights fees are based on sport and school classification. Schools are required to sign up any time during a sport’s approved season for the right to play this additional game and rights fees will be paid at year’s end. Schools will be responsible for their own expenses and will be able to retain all revenues generated from ticket sales (etc) for these games. Initially, games will be limited to varsity teams only and all games will need to be played during the sports regular season dates, with potential for future expansion to other sports/levels."
