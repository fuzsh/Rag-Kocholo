        "meta_description": "The foundation's work is currently focused on public education and youth development. In the area of public education, interest is primarily in parent and community organizing and training around school reform issues. Similarly, in the area of youth development, proposals which focus on training young people to become community or peer organizers around concrete social issues are favored. Funding is targeted at community-based and grassroots organizations.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<div class=\"row-fluid\">\r\n<div class=\"span12\">\r\n<p id=\"areas-of-interest\"> The grantmaker has identified the following area(s) of interest: </p>\r\n<div>\r\n<h5>Public Education</h5>\r\n<p> Under this area, the foundation will support parent and community organizing initiatives that foster equity and improved student achievement. The foundation will work in partnership with community-based and grassroots organizations in the following cities and regions: Los Angeles, CA; Miami, FL; Mississippi Delta, MS; and New York, NY. </p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h5>Youth Organizing</h5>\r\n<p> The foundation seeks to contribute to the development of young people as leaders for social change so that they can help create policies, social systems, and public institutions that are supportive, responsible, and accountable to youth and their communities. The foundation will primarily support existing youth organizing groups that: 1) are poised to expand the scope, scale and impact of their organizing on concrete issues that affect young people's development, in particular youth of color and lower income youth and their communities, and that have a well-developed plan to increase the number and leadership capacity of the young people involved in their work as well as to build a larger, stronger, leadership and membership base; and 2) whose work can inform that of other organizations in the field and that demonstrates the effectiveness of youth organizing as a strategy for youth leadership development and social change. See foundation web site for additional information. </p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",
