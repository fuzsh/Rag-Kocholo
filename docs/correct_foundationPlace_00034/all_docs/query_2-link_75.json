        "text": "A common misconception about the Spanish conquest of America is that it was a lightning-bolt enterprise that quickly converted the region’s inhabitants to Christianity and to the Spanish way of life. But in fact the conquest was uneven, and the Spanish needed to use local leaders to control the large masses of indigenous peoples who ever so slowly and inconsistently moved toward adopting a Mediterranean-style cultural and religious ideal. Based on his archival research in Mexico, James Lockhart concludes that «many basic features of pre-Conquest culture survived indefinitely» (1999, p. 98). The same could be argued for Tahuantinsuyo, the Andean region that had been conquered by the Incas. Even a century after what could be called the Forty Years War (1532-1572) in which the Spanish eventually defeated the Inca royal house, legislation promulgated in Lima suggests that colonial officials were still looking for ways to siphon off political power from hereditary elites known as curacas by mandating democratic elections for non-hereditary alcaldes thereby undercutting transmissible power among the nobles (Ballesteros, 1685)\n\nThis article provides comparative texts and contexts between Brazil and Canada in the Atlantic world, not simply an Inter-American comparison, but a trans-Atlantic and global typology. It focuses on the translation of empire through translation, particularly of part of Jacques Cartier’s narratives about Canada by John Florio in 1580 and of Jean de Léry’s account of the voyage to Brazil in Samuel Purchas’ collection in 1625. English travel or encounter literature is in the service of contact, exploration, encounter and possible possession and settlement. The Spanish, through Columbus, and the Portuguese as well as the French are part of this comparative literature and these cultural texts, which are intertextual and translational, among themselves and with English culture and literature. The encounter between the Indigenous peoples and Europeans in the New World, in Brazil and Canada is central to changing the literature and cultures of the Americas, Europe, Africa, and of the world ...\n\nThis paper explores the ideological transformations which have been carried out in producing Tears of the Indies, one of the first English translations of Brevísima relación de la destrucción de las Indias by the Dominican Bartolomé de las Casas, a tract which he addressed to the future King Philip II, and in which he denounced the actions of the conquistadors in the New World. The translator, John Phillips, appropriated the text to create an anti-Spanish narrative with a view to promoting English nationalism as well as encouraging the construction of an English empire in the Americas. The article examines the changes to the title, the replacement of the original preface by one addressed to Oliver Cromwell and the translation strategies adopted, which were intended to portray the Spaniards as a nation of Catholic butchers. Evidence is also provided of the long-lasting influence of this version, which, five centuries later, continues to be used in Anglophone schools and academia (particularly in the United States), in spite of its serious flaws and the existence of more recent and accurate retranslations. 49 free e-prints available from the publisher here: http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/gqyC7A8Bf8WVDhs2v9Uj/full"
