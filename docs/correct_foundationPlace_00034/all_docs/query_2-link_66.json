This interest has been fuelled by a number of simultaneous developments on both sides of the Atlantic, such as the “coming of age” of the discipline of the history of science in Spain’s academic circles,1 the publication in North America of a number of pioneering books in the fields of colonial and transatlantic studies,2 the engagement with certain philosophers of science like Bruno Latour and Michel Serres by literary and cultural critics, and the relentless work of a select number of Golden Age scholars on the presence of scientific inquiry in Cervantes and his contemporaries.3 Even two emerging areas of interest – so-called animal studies and cognitive studies – have, in some aspects, offered useful tools to understand the fraught relationship of the early modern mind with its surroundings.4 As a result, a new generation of siglodeoristas – some of them gathered in this volume – has managed to explore original and exciting questions that would be difficult to conceptualize without the coalescence of the developments outlined above. The initial results, which reveal a more nuanced and permeable cultural and social scenario in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spain, offer reasons for optimism, as new connections are established between the giants of the era and certain disciplines like mathematics, mechanics, and astronomy. Literary creation, in fact, proved to be more sensitive than we thought to some of the achievements of the Scientific Revolution, as I have indicated recently,5 and as María M. Portuondo argues in the closing essay of this volume. If the literary field worked as a testing ground for the reception of the new, it is also true that it did so with uneven results. Of all the\n\n4\n\nEnrique García Santo-Tomás\n\ngenres that captured the epistemological challenges in the Spain of the Baroque, theatre was the one that most thoroughly covered its complex scenario and the paths that led to it. As many scholars have pointed out, there was not a contemporary phenomenon or a historical event that resisted being staged, as Lope de Vega, Tirso de Molina, Calderón de la Barca, and his peers proved time and again. Tragedies and comedies – and everything in between – enjoyed a short life in the playhouses because the demand was always high, and the wits of the time had to come up with new themes and formulas to satisfy the appetite of the vulgo. Theatre, in fact, was not only the most versatile and flexible medium, but also the most “scientific,” and the one that most clearly benefitted from the technical innovations of the era.6 This explains the rationale behind this book: Science on Stage in Early Modern Spain explores the relationship between technical innovations in stagecraft such as optics, sound effects, and mechanics, and theatrical events that incorporated scientific content into their dramatic plot lines. Featuring eleven essays by scholars in the fields of literary and cultural studies and the history of science, it focuses on the early modern period in Spain (roughly, between 1500 and 1700) through the birth and development of its playhouses and coliseums alongside the extraordinary success of its major writers. Because of the complexity of the period and the different phases that can be identified within it, and also due to the marked particularities of the playwrights and the spaces analysed, each contributor has focused on his or her field of expertise and on a very select number of texts. The questions they address are different but complementary, and seek to offer a detailed portrayal of the most relevant technical and scientific endeavours of the time. Their essays combine the theoretical and the historical, the representation of a scientific phenomenon in a particular text or author, but also the idea of performance and performativity in cultural artefacts that may not necessarily be labelled as “theatre,” as Seth Kimmel and Matthew G. Ancell explore in their essays.7 Understanding science in a very broad sense, the book thus tackles topics and areas as diverse as chemistry, optics, astronomy, geometry, mechanics, and mathematics, and remains sensitive to the different pace at which these disciplines evolved locally. The main body of essays is preceded by an introductory chapter by Ryan Szpiech that traces the different paths that led to the issues at stake and culminates with a coda by María M. Portuondo that reflects on the state of the discipline while proposing new debates and explorations. All chapters strive for a balance between critical analysis and popularized\n\nIntroduction: Great Theatres of the World\n\n5\n\nintroduction of factual knowledge, as they seek to spark the interest of experts and novices alike.\n\n• A few words on the historical context may help us situate the issues at stake. As David Goodman (159) has written, the geographical position of the Iberian Peninsula explains why the history of Spain and Portugal has in some respects been so different from the rest of Europe. With the Muslim conquest of 711, Arabic cultural influences were more pronounced than anywhere else in Europe, and were still perceptible in the development of science in the early modern period – some of the centres of learning in al-Andalus, such as those in Córdoba, were at the forefront in Europe in fields like mathematics and geometry. Location also determined why Portugal and Spain were the first European countries to undertake those voyages of discovery that led to the acquisition of new knowledge, as their expeditions provided a solid foundation for the development of new technological achievements in subsequent decades. The economic significance of the Spanish treasure fleet and the exploitation of untapped sources from the New World opened new epistemological horizons in the maritime and metallurgical fields. The transition from feudalism to nascent forms of capitalism, along with the incorporation of Spanish territories into trade routes between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, allowed for a number of technological changes that manifested in different forms of innovation. In agriculture, practices such as livestock farming and food production, inventions like water wheels, and novel techniques of irrigation were introduced or perfected by the Muslim population. As Ricardo Padrón and others have demonstrated, seafaring technology inspired new cartographic and astronomical studies coming from commercial and financial institutions in Castile and Aragon. At the same time, a number of financial repercussions resulting from overseas expansion such as inflation, reduced incentives for productive investment, and social and ideological conservatism led to the growth of an academic discipline of economics in Spain. In some cases, trade practices were linked to the Jewish and converted Christian minorities, many of whom were at the forefront of literary innovation as well. During the sixteenth century, universities proliferated in the Iberian Peninsula (Esteban Piñeiro, “Las academias”; García Tapia). Víctor Navarro Brotons and William Eamon have written “one of the most important intellectual developments of late medieval scholasticism,\n\n6\n\nEnrique García Santo-Tomás\n\nsuch as nominalism, took root in Spain somewhat later than in northern Europe, and coexisted with the humanist movement without any major conflicts. Yet the supposed grip of scholasticism on Iberian science did not, by any means, preclude the study and teaching of the new cosmology” (32). Vestiges of the Black Legend have perpetuated the stereotype of sixteenth-century Spain as a fanatical enemy of progress and innovation, but it was the Inquisition in Rome, not Spain, that prosecuted Galileo, while as early as 1561 Copernicus was allowed to be taught ad vota audientium in Spain’s leading university, Salamanca.8 Some of the most important scientific developments were, indeed, sponsored by the monarchy, and took place in connection with imperial projects, including overseas territorial expansion, the consolidation of rule over newly occupied territories, and the strengthening of a vernacular language able to compete in academic prestige with, Latin, hitherto, the official language.9 Much of this activity took place in newly founded institutions such as the Casa de Contratación in Seville and the Academia de Matemáticas in Madrid.10 A noteworthy example of Spanish scientific ambitions at the time was in 1598, when Philip III launched an open competition for a method of determining longitude at sea.11 As I have written recently, Galileo Galilei himself made an attempt at the attractive prize, as emblematic of a greater concern over what was going on in Madrid’s scientific and artistic circles. It is well known, for instance, that he tried for many years to move there to collaborate with the leading playwrights by sharing his scientific background when it came to stage design and perspectival knowledge.12 He sent a sample of his telescope to Philip IV in the early 1620s with the goal of settling in Madrid and working freely, far from the pressures of Rome. Unfortunately, when it arrived the king received a shattered lens, perhaps reflecting the fate of this ambitious enterprise: shattered dreams for an innovator who paid dearly for his tenacity. But Spain had enjoyed a robust tradition of glassmakers for over a hundred years, and Galileo’s work, in particular his masterpiece The Sidereal Messenger (1610), was read and circulated not only through the teachings and (partial) translation by scientists at the Royal Academia de Matemáticas, but also through unofficial channels in which optics and astronomy mingled with astrology and the maligned practice of the pronóstico, or almanac. Without ever setting foot in Castile, Galileo became the epitome of the scientist-virtuoso in Spain, as the country witnessed a remarkable growth in the number of amateur stargazers as well as local savants who sometimes fashioned themselves as learned visionaries. Spanish satire took advantage of this folie du voir\n\nIntroduction: Great Theatres of the World\n\n7\n\nlike no other genre of the time. Popularized in Spain through the work of the satirist Traiano Boccalini, the motif of the occhiali politici, or political lenses, became one of the most important narrative devices in early modern Spanish fiction. In these satires, mostly taking place in Madrid, the anteojos de larga vista (far-sighted eyeglasses) became a central element as the eye was given the ability to perceive the true reality beyond deceptive appearances. But this capacity revealed two parallel concerns: the adoption of spectacles as a mark of social distinction by a society suffering from the same moral blindness these texts denounced; and the increasing tensions between astronomy and religion, stemming from the use of lenses as star-gazing tools. Framing these anxieties in the contemporary polemics regarding the divulgation of Galileo’s Copernican theses, I illustrated in The Refracted Muse how a simple corrective instrument triggered a fierce debate situated at the very centre of Spain’s uneven modernity. In this fraught transition from a Ptolemaic to a Copernican view of the cosmos in early modern Spanish literature, literary testimonies on this particular problem tackled the issue in fascinating ways. The question, therefore, is not so much how fiction captured the workings of the telescope, but rather how these shifts between freedom and constraint facilitated the consolidation of an entire genre as well as the invention of new lexical tropes in which the major writers of the time, from Miguel de Cervantes to Baltasar Gracián, got involved. Astronomy was, in any case, just one of the many fields of inquiry in early modern Spain. Philip IV was fascinated with pharmacological alchemy, and it is believed that he experimented sub rosa. References to magic, to precious stones, and to the curative uses of new “substances” coming from abroad, such as tobacco and chocolate, abound in early modern Spanish literature, as the official and the clandestine competed for control of scientific discourse. Medicine, for its part, was not free of controversy: the Royal Protomedicato, for example, was pivotal in administering power to royally sanctioned surgeons, who frequently clashed with local physicians and midwives for control of the birthing room. The seventeenth century also witnessed an increasing fascination with anatomy, reflected in the recurring presence of severed and dissected bodies in genres like comedy and the short story – a perfect fit to the Baroque taste for the morbid and the bizarre. At the same time, events like the expulsion of the Jews in 1492, the expulsion of the moriscos (Christian converts from Islam and their descendants) in 1609, and the persecution of religious dissidents increased suspicion and self-censorship. This was a limitation, in any case, very different from\n\n8\n\nEnrique García Santo-Tomás\n\nthe backwardness that has been traditionally – and unfairly – assigned to early modern Iberia. The thesis among historians that Spain experienced a decline of scientific activity in the seventeenth century because of general economic, social, and political decline has been challenged in recent years. The abundance and richness of scientific and technical inquiry belies a portrait that has now begun to be called into question. But one should not feel triumphalist either: as Goodman and others remind us, one should wonder if all of this seemingly pragmatically scientific and technical activity might have caused Iberia’s relative isolation from speculative thinking.\n\n• Although Spain has long had an illustrious tradition of scholarship on its major authors and salient masterpieces, a vernacular line of work on the development of science in early modern Castile and Aragón – comprising its four main centres of Seville, Valencia, Madrid, and Barcelona – has only begun to develop with the advent of democracy in the late 1970s and the diminishing influence of the Church in civil society. Scholars working in institutions like the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (Spanish National Research Council) have turned what used to be a bleak scenario of minor works into a rich and kaleidoscopic field that has completely changed our view of early modern science in Spain: from a society that was thought to be backward and isolated from its European neighbours to one that, starting with the collecting appetite of its own monarchs, was able to evade the yoke of the Inquisition while still importing foreign ideas, books, and scientific instruments. It has only been in the last twenty years or so that a clear picture of this activity has emerged, thanks to the sustained collaborative effort of scholars in Europe and North America, and with an increasing number of academic conferences that have ironically revealed the scarcity of useful printed materials on the discipline such as monographs, journals, and anthologies – a scarcity that this volume wants modestly to remedy. A different story has been that of Iberia’s cultural scene, which flourished in the early years of the sixteenth century in what is still considered its Golden Age. This was the time of poets such as Garcilaso de la Vega (1501–36) and Luis de Góngora (1561–1627), novelists such as Miguel de Cervantes (1547–1616) and Francisco de Quevedo (1580–1645), playwrights such as Lope de Vega (1562–1635) and Calderón de la Barca (1600–81), painters such as Diego Velázquez (1599–1666) and Bartolomé Murillo (1617–82), philosophers such as Luis Vives (1493–1540) and Baltasar Gracián (1601–58), theologians such as Luis de León (1527–91)\n\nIntroduction: Great Theatres of the World\n\n9\n\nand Teresa de Jesús (1515–82), economic historians such as Juan de Mariana (1536–1624), political theorists such as Pedro de Valencia (1555–1620), polymaths such as Juan de Espina (1563–1645) and Vincencio Juan de Lastanosa (1607–81), astronomers such as the Copernican Diego de Zúñiga (1536–97), and inventors such as the spectacle maker Joan Roget (1550–ca. 1617–24) and the engineer-mathematician Juanelo Turriano (1500–85), just to name a few. Some of them, as was the case of Lope de Vega, studied with the leading scientists of the time, and possessed a strong scientific background that manifested itself in many aspects of their work.13 It comes as no surprise that recent scholarship has revealed a twofold phenomenon visible in their fictional work: on the one hand, a great amount of information on current scientific achievements in Spain and its territories (Portugal was annexed to the Crown from 1580 to 1640); on the other hand, a surprising familiarity with pivotal advances in issues like stage design, hydraulics, sound, and perspective when staging a play. Poets like Lope de Vega and Calderón were, after all, “men of theatre,” writers who were fully involved in many technical aspects of the fiesta teatral when it came to staging their highly successful comedies and tragedies. In this regard, Science on Stage in Early Modern Spain comes at a time when a new generation of scholars has managed to spark a fruitful conversation that did not exist a decade ago, capturing three distinct phenomena: what has been recently called, in Stephen Gaukroger’s book The Emergence of a Scientific Culture, the “emergence of a scientific culture” in Spain; the rise of the playhouse as a technical achievement that allowed for the staging of “science plots”; and the presence of a generation of scholars with the theoretical tools and empirical evidence to speak about these issues. Science on Stage in Early Modern Spain is the first book published in any language to address these phenomena, doing so at a time when scholars coming from cultural studies and history of science are becoming more and more interested in the performance of knowledge, and specifically a knowledge shared through the most popular, versatile, and generous medium of the time. What I label here as “science plays” constitute the most important manifestation not only of how technical knowledge was embedded into the texts, but also of how theatre in itself could deploy scientific knowledge through the empirical use of new findings in optics, mechanics, acoustics, hydraulics, and other important discoveries.\n\n• This book is divided into three main sections: “Technologies of Knowledge,” “Stages of Science,” and “Performing Numbers.” The first one,\n\n10\n\nEnrique García Santo-Tomás\n\n“Technologies of Knowledge,” is made up of three essays that explore the intellectual and physical conditions that facilitated the production of these “science plots.” It begins with Ryan Szpiech’s overview essay, “From Mesopotamia to Madrid: The Legacy of Ancient and Medieval Science in Early Modern Spain,” in which he traces how the growth of science in early modern Europe relied on a long precedent of scientific exploration in the ancient and medieval worlds. The scientific advances of ancient Greece, from Euclidian geometry to Ptolemaic astronomy to Aristotelian natural sciences, were preserved in the Byzantine world of the Eastern Mediterranean after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. This learning was then transmitted to the flourishing culture of medieval Baghdad, which blended ancient Greek wisdom and learning with knowledge received from Persian, Sanskrit, and ancient Mesopotamian cultures. Scholars in Baghdad amassed this syncretistic wealth in Arabic translations that were spread across the Islamic world, from India to Iberia. In his essay, Szpiech shows how a number of these texts came to be translated into Latin and Castilian in Castile in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries as Christian armies conquered the lands of Islamic al-Andalus, appropriating the riches of medieval Islamic learning for Christian culture. Many advances of early modern European science – from the Copernican heliocentric model to Newton’s optical theories – built in some way on this history of transmission from antiquity via Baghdad and Toledo. At the same time, as early modern theatre came to engage directly – both technically and thematically – with the burgeoning scientific culture of the day, this history of transmission was often distorted or partly obscured. In surveying the outlines of this transmission history, this chapter establishes the background of scientific knowledge that came to play a pronounced role in early modern Spanish cultural expression while calling into question the terms in which the history of modern science is written. It highlights the particular elements of the medieval transmission of scientific knowledge in the Iberian Peninsula – the translation movement of twelfth-century Toledo and the ambitious projects of thirteenth-century king Alfonso X, “the Learned” – that came to resonate forcefully in early modern theatre, from optics to anatomy to alchemy and beyond. As commercial theatre in Spain grew from the 1560s onwards as a business and a cultural enterprise, so too, argues Alejandro GarcíaReidy, did the technology available to professional actors and actresses with the creation of new theatres, stage machinery, and props. GarcíaReidy’s essay, “The Technological Environment of the Early Modern\n\nIntroduction: Great Theatres of the World\n\n11\n\nSpanish Stage,” focuses on the intersection of early modern science, technology, and performance that helped shape Spanish theatre as a space of innovation and allowed playwrights to explore new modes of representation. García-Reidy pays particular attention to the scientific and technological developments (in architecture, carpentry, geometry, etc.) behind and within the main spaces of performance. He focuses on the public playhouse, but also on the rooms of the royal palaces, on the Coliseo del Buen Retiro, and on the carts used for sacramental plays. He shows how the physical properties and technical capacities of these stages determined the different ways in which early modern Spanish playwrights and performers could think and embody their texts, and how audiences came in contact with theatrical technology. Early modern Spanish theatre was performed not in the round but on a grid. Its rigidly structured verticality – prominent in every reconstruction of Madrid’s commercial theatres – made it a drama of the y-axis. This orientation was emphasized by the popular taste for hagiographic dramas that traced narratives of heavenward ascent. The stage, however, was not alone in its gridded fascinations. Nearly all of the significant achievements of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries in Spain – from the grate-shaped Escorial, to Madrid’s Plaza Mayor, to most of the significant retables – were laid out as a series of rectangles. During the seventeenth century, especially, Spain engaged in a striking variety of projects to rationalize personal and public space, ranging from fencing to gardening and fortification. Early modern Spanish drama organized the affinities among these projects by demonstrating that their geometric designs were conceptually related. In his essay “Gridded Fascinations: Early Modern Drama’s Geometric Synthesis,” John Slater argues that this consolidation of differing forms of applied geometry was a new theorization of what unity of space might mean. The second part of the book, “Stages of Science,” comprises three essays. In “Curing the Malady of Lovesickness: Medicine and Physicians in Early Spanish Theatre,” Julio Vélez-Sainz argues that the discourses of lovesickness in the later Middle Ages (represented primarily by Bernard of Gordon’s Lily of Medicine) and in the early modern period in works such as Juan Huarte de San Juan’s Examen de ingenios intermingle with that of medical practice. He analyses a representative number of plays by Juan del Encina, Lucas Fernández, and Bartolomé de Torres Naharro to show the variety of uses of medical knowledge on the stage and the dialogues between the discourses of science and the arts in the Renaissance. Juan del Encina’s Égloga de Plácida y Victoriano explores the\n\n12\n\nEnrique García Santo-Tomás\n\nsuffering of the lovers through the binomial cobdicia (greed) and cupiditia (inordinate passion), thus interrelating semantically the spheres of capital earning and love. The cures for this malady stem from later medieval medical knowledge as understood at court. Lucas Fernández’s Farsa o cuasicomedia de la doncella, el pastor y el soldado examines a wide range of responses to the disease of love that make the characters feel enslaved. The soldier character, the first of its kind in the Spanish tradition, deploys a number of courtly techniques to remedy both maiden and shepherd. Finally, Bartolomé de Torres Naharro’s Comedia Aquilana presents a triad of physicians on stage (Galieno, Polidario, Esculapio), all reminiscent of actual historical figures, to cure Aquilano’s suffering. Each of them embodies a style of medicine that is presented as a means to prevent the development of disease in the protagonist. Through a careful examination of these texts, Vélez-Sainz’s essay measures the sophisticated ways in which the Renaissance practitioners of theatre constructed modes of curing lovesickness stemming from the classical and medieval scientific and artistic traditions. If melancholy was frequently deemed a form of intoxication, early modern times coincided with an epoch marked by an increase in the amount of information available to the public about toxicological matters. Toxicology is a fairly modern scientific field, and yet knowledge of toxic substances and how to use them dates back to antiquity. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, discussions about poison(ing) permeated not only medical-botanical treatises, books on poisons, and journalistic letters, but also other discourses, including political, historical, legal, and theological, meant for different audiences and with disparate purposes. This surge of poison reveals that there was more at play than a mere pull to categorize toxic substances or to spread sensational news. Poison is present in scientific books dealing with nature, where the wordless bodies of herbs, minerals, and animals “speak” their toxicity; in books of secrets, where arcane recipes are publicized; and in herbal dispensaries and apothecary shops, as well as in streets and households. Not surprisingly, it permeates literature, whether as a metaphor for anything psychosomatically harmful or as an all too real murderous weapon. In addition, poison could serve to remind readers of the frequency of harmful elements in the natural world, to underscore the unbridled human capacity to sin, to warn of the earthly and eternal punishments awaiting those who knowingly forsake proper civil and Christian behaviour, or even to instil ideas about groups considered harmful to Spain or to the res publica. Early modern medical writings\n\nIntroduction: Great Theatres of the World\n\n13\n\nsuch as doctor Andrés Laguna’s Pedacio Dioscorides Anazarbeo, Acerca de la materia medicinal y de los venenos mortíferos (1555), a translation of Dioscorides’s De materia medica garnished with Laguna’s own observations, illustrations, comments, anecdotes, and detailed descriptions of different poisons and antidotes, made readily available to laymen information previously reserved to medical practitioners. It is known, for instance, that Miguel de Cervantes owned a copy of Laguna’s Dioscorides and, according to many scholars, he made good use of it to describe the varied concoctions used by his characters with manifold intentions, including the tósigo (poison) ingested by Isabel in his exemplary novel La española inglesa. Annals such as Jerónimo de Barrionuevo’s Avisos, which gather miscellaneous news about Madrid, report only a trifling eleven cases of poisoning between the years 1654 and 1658, and yet the theme of criminal poisoning and, in general, of the use of intoxicating substances, proliferated in Spanish comedia. Thus, theatre-goers could experience vicariously the power of poisonous preparations in plays such as Canon Tárrega’s La Duquesa constante and La enemiga favorable, Salustrio del Poyo’s La próspera fortuna de Ruy López de Ávalos, and many others. Given that poison was long associated with the sphere of magic, astrology, and divination, poisoners could be connected to astrologers, medical professionals, and women healers oftentimes described as witches. As Lourdes Albuixech argues in “Poison(ing) and Spanish Comedia,” the roles played by toxicatio, and how rudimentary forensics are articulated in early modern Spanish dramatic discourse, have not yet received much critical attention. Her study intends to fill this void. The relation of science and technology to political agency resulted in the development of areas like metallurgy, artillery, and fortifications. Spain’s campaigns against Breda and other Dutch cities raised questions about the technology of artillery and siegeworks and the impact of attrition on civilian populations in besieged cities. The fortification of cities and the means of assaulting such defensive works demanded technologies and techniques often deemed at odds with the traditional ethos of martial heroism. Sieges were also subject to longstanding ethical questions about extending the tactics of war to non-combatants. Stephen Rupp tackles these issues in his essay “The Soul under Siege: Strategy and Neostoicism in Calderón de la Barca’s El sitio de Bredá.” In this 1632 play, Calderón celebrates the taking by Hapsburg forces of the Protestant city of Breda in the Lowlands, a victory secured through siege tactics of bombardment and blockade. In the context of early modern attitudes towards the uses of armed force, argues Rupp, siege\n\n14\n\nEnrique García Santo-Tomás\n\nwarfare presents challenges as a heroic subject. Calderón’s response to these questions centres on the figure of Ambrogio Spinola, commander of the Spanish forces in Flanders and of the assault on Breda. Spinola is presented as exercising command through two sets of skills: technical expertise in the placement and vulnerability of fortifications and mental discipline in the face of the unpredictable dangers and contingencies of warfare. Each of these aspects of Spinola is developed over the course of the play. Through his generalship, Spinola shows a detailed knowledge of the technology and tactics of early modern warfare. He discusses the deployment of fireships to blockade the river Mark with a military engineer, and offers a long description of the defensive works that surround the city of Breda, in a passage that recalls the tradition in Renaissance visual art of engravings of notable battles and sieges. Spinola also displays qualities of fortitude and equanimity that are central to his victory. He attends to despatches and logistical matters when his position is under attack, and his detachment allows him to accept the strategic logic that justifies taking an enemy city by starving its citizens. Spinola’s praise of his Spanish troops recasts the terms in which heroism is defined, stressing restraint and fortitude as the highest of military virtues. Calderón presents knowledge of fortification and Neostoic equanimity as complementary technologies of command. Spinola’s ingenio embraces both the skills of military engineering and control of the self under conditions of siege. The third section of the book is titled “Performing Numbers.” In “Figures of Arithmetic: Numeracy, Calculation, and Accounting in the Comedia,” Elvira Vilches identifies points of contact between religious theatre such as Calderón de la Barca’s La nave del mercader, el mayor mercado del mundo, and the practical knowledge that the arts of commerce exemplify as the precursor of natural knowledge and the rise of science. Vilches suggests that the ubiquitous presence of numeracy, arithmetic, and bookkeeping practices across literary and cultural fields follow the popularity of technical commercial textbooks. She then argues that religious plays illustrate complementary habits of thought associated with mercantile culture. In this genre, profit, loss, debt, reckoning, and accounting assess secular and devotional matters. Plays integrate these terms in the confrontation between passions and interests, while appropriating the technologies of trade to articulate the rationality of penance, redemption, and grace. The performance of ordinary practices – from calculating profit and loss, banking, and managing debt to recording transactions in books of account – transforms the familiar into the\n\nIntroduction: Great Theatres of the World\n\n15\n\nspiritual. The active interchange and the skills needed to grapple with an expanding monetary economy indicate the cognitive spryness and quantitative sophistication that early modern Spaniards had to develop to sell, purchase, invest, lend, and borrow. While pure or abstract mathematics remained the realm of the elites, these genres show that the use of numbers required inventiveness, cunning, and quick problem solving to pursue wealth and attain salvation. Self-propelled machines known as automatons have a distinguished history stretching from the hydraulic contraptions adorning temples in the ancient world to the bronze talking head owned by the medieval scholastic Roger Bacon, but it was the late sixteenth century’s printed encyclopedias or “theatres” of machines that first consolidated this mechanical tradition as a portable tool for stage and chapel designers, preachers, poets, and philosophers alike. In his essay “Automatons and the Early Modern Drama of Skepticism,” Seth Kimmel writes that this early modern story of automatons reveals baroque artifice as more than a sign of political cynicism or theological skepticism. As Cervantes, Descartes, Hobbes, and others both within and beyond the Iberian Peninsula employed the science of deception to allegorical as well as mechanical ends, they dramatized rather than obscured their new narrative technologies of belief and argumentation. It is difficult to imagine early modern Spanish theatre without the influence of the visual arts, especially considering the numerous connections between playwrights like Calderón de la Barca and painters like Diego Velázquez, born just months apart. In “Daedalean Epistemology: Staging the Labyrinth of Knowledge in Velázquez’s Las Hilanderas and Calderón de la Barca’s Los tres mayores prodigios,” Matthew G. Ancell argues that embedded within Las Hilanderas are several layers of representation that collapse any certainty about where each one begins and ends. Framing one plane of a represented reality within another, the painting produces a labyrinth of both optical configurations and mythological narratives. At the deepest level perspectivally lies the Ovidian myth of the Rape of Europa, which, in following the narrative thread, leads us into the myth of the minotaur and the labyrinth. Ancell examines how the drama of imitation in the fable of Arachne represented in the painting takes us to even deeper questions about the possibilities of knowledge, as implied by the figure of the labyrinth and the minotaur. This phenomenon shares some of the technical questions that concerned Calderón de la Barca in Los tres mayores prodigios (1636): just as the tradition of trompe l’oeil enacts the problem\n\n16\n\nEnrique García Santo-Tomás\n\nof mimesis, the optical puzzle in Velázquez’s work stages – quite literally, as the scene is of a drama and proscenium stage – the problem of perspectiva naturalis or natural vision and therefore puts into doubt empirical knowledge. Over the last decade or so historians have brought new approaches to the study of science and medicine in early modern Spain. As María M. Portuondo argues in the closing chapter of the book, “Looking Behind the Curtain: Clues of Early Modern Spanish Science,” the field has been revisiting old questions and posing new ones with the aim of situating “whatever was happening in Spain and its world” within the larger narrative of the history of science. At the same time, the notion of a unitary grand narrative in science has been questioned by perspectives brought into the field from cultural and social history, as well as methodologies borrowed from the social sciences. This invigorated field of study has broken away from its traditional roots in intellectual history and now employs a remarkable flexibility and creativity in studying “science” in all registers of the human experience. After recapitulating the recent developments in the field written for an audience of nonspecialists in the history of science, this chapter then reflects on what cultural studies, particularly literary ones, can contribute to the field. Portuondo’s piece concludes with some reflections of how the essays in this volume illustrate the potential of exploring the nexus of cultural studies and the history of science in early modern Spain.\n\n• Science on Stage in Early Modern Spain seeks to engage with scholars working in the domains of literary history and cultural studies, performance studies, women’s studies, and urban studies. It touches on topics like censorship, the Spanish Inquisition, the Black Legend, and the influence of Eastern traditions in Spain, not to mention that of the scientific revolution. Because of the circulation of ideas inherent in any form of scientific breakthrough, some essays will also be of pivotal interest to those working on the diplomatic and intellectual relations between Italy and Spain. Since most of the best collaborative work on optics and sound in the Spanish coliseums under the reign of Philip IV (1621–65) resulted from the arrival in Madrid of figures like Cosimo Lotti and Baccio del Bianco, I expect some of the chapters of this volume to be very useful to college professors as well, especially when addressing the transition from open-air corrales to coliseums. Finally, Ryan Szpiech\n\nIntroduction: Great Theatres of the World\n\n17\n\nand María M. Portuondo’s chapters on the history and current state of the discipline will, I hope, inspire colleagues in all these fields to engage more fully with issues that remain under-studied, like the presence of mathematics in the cultural manifestations of the era.14 In its general scope, as well as in the particulars of its different case studies, Science on Stage in Early Modern Spain aims to be a useful tool for English-speaking undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, and scholars. This book examines the complexities of the Baroque cosmos as it was represented onstage, laying bare some of its inner mechanisms. Moving Calderón’s “great theatre of the world” from the theological to the scientific, we see that these theatres of the empirical world are productions of a different kind, but that they are nevertheless performances in which the role of illusion still reigns supreme. I would like to thank the superb editorial team at the University of Toronto Press, especially Suzanne Rancourt, whose support throughout the process has been invaluable. I am also grateful to the anonymous readers for their thoughtful comments and suggestions.\n\nNOTES 1 For a general approach, see López Piñero’s pioneering studies.

The misunderstanding comes about when Estefanía’s slave Isabel, a “cautiva de la frontera” (captive from the frontier, i.e., of Muslim background) (l. 593; Kennedy, Lope 112), disguises herself as her mistress and receives Castro’s rival Fortunio (Fortune), who sleeps with her believing she is Estefanía. Castro, hearing rumours of betrayal, pursues the disguised Isabel, who takes refuge by hiding under Estefanía’s bed, where her mistress is asleep with Castro’s baby. Castro bursts into the bedroom and, in a fit of blind rage, kills his wife before she ever learns of the rumours of her infamy, after which Isabel emerges and confesses her deception. This complex plot involves disguise, mistaken identity, and “passing” – numerous scenes depict Christians disguised as Muslims and vice versa – and dramatizes a palpable anxiety, expressed in terms of seduction and sexual honour, over the easy confusion of the foreign with the domestic, Muslim with Christian. Significantly, the main story of false identities and misplaced jealousies takes place against the backdrop of the imminent Almohad invasion of the peninsula (1147), with part of the plot unfolding in Morocco, where Castro and Fortunio meet for a duel. In a scene just after Isabel speaks of her captive origins and confesses her secret love for Fortunio, an astrologer named “Albumasar” secretly predicts the future conquest of the Almoravids in al-Andalus by the lowly “Abdelmón,” a figure representing ʿAbd\n\n26\n\nRyan Szpiech\n\nal-Muʾmin al-Kūmī (d. 1163), the first caliph to succeed the Almohad founder, Ibn Tumart. Albumasar introduces himself by referring to his fame as a well-known astrologer in both North Africa and Iberia: ¿Sabes que astrólogo soy, no sólo en Fez y Marruecos conozido, donde estoy; mas que a España, con los ecos de mi fama, nombre doy? Did you know that I am an astrologer, not only well known here in Fez and Morocco, but also giving fame to Spain with the echoes of my name?\n\nAbdelmón replies: Sé que si alguno ha nac̦ ido Que sepa esa inc̦ ierta c̦ ienc̦ ia, Tú solo en el mundo has sido, Porque la antigua esperiencia Has puesto en eterno oluido. Sé que de esferas, planetas, Cielos y otros movimientos, Sabes las causas secretas, Y que nuestros nacimientos Por su ascendiente interpretas.\n\n(ll. 690–704; Kennedy, Lope 116–17)\n\nI know that if anyone has been born who knows that uncertain science, you alone in the world are he, because you have cast ancient knowledge into oblivion. I know that you know the secret causes of the spheres, planets, heavens, and other movements, and that you interpret our births by their ascendant.\n\nIn studying this episode, Frederick de Armas points out that Lope followed an earlier version of this story told by thirteenth-century King Alfonso X in his History of Spain (Estoria de España) (De Armas, “El rey” 123), in which Albumasar’s name is Abentumet. “Se leuanto en los alaraues un moro que dizien Abentumet, et era un sabio en la astronomia, que es el saber de las estrellas, et era muy sabio en las naturas otrossi” (There arose among the Arabs a moor called Abentumet, who was an expert in astronomy, the knowledge of the stars, and who\n\nFrom Mesopotamia to Madrid\n\n27\n\nwas an expert in natural sciences also) (Alfonso, Primera 2:658). Alfonso himself indicates, moreover, that his own source was “el arçobispo don Rodrigo que lo dize en la su estoria” (the Archbishop Rodrigo, who tells it in his history), i.e., the history of Spain On the Things of Spain (De rebus hispaniae) by thirteenth-century archbishop of Toledo Rodrigo Jiménez de Rada (d. 1247), who told this story in almost identical terms in Latin, describing the Muslim astronomer as “homo in astronomia et naturalibus ualde doctus” (a man very learned in astronomy and natural [sciences]) (De rebus, 7.10, 231).2 It is not a surprise to find Lope’s source in Alfonso’s Estoria, not only because of the Estoria’s wide distribution in manuscript and print and in the revised version of Florián Ocampo (Los cinco primeros libros de la coronica general, 1553), but also because it served as a source used by Lope’s acquaintance, Jesuit Juan de Mariana, who also tells a nearly identical story in his own Historiae de rebus hispaniae (1592) (507). The value of tracing this history goes beyond that of simply identifying Lope’s sources; it intimates a larger story of the reception – in turns enthusiastic and agonistic – of ancient and medieval science in early modern Iberia. While the name Abentumet is a calque of Ibn Tumart, Albumasar, as De Armas notes, is the Latinate name of Abū Maʿshar al-Balkhī (d. 886 CE), a scholar from Balkh in Khorasan (present-day northern Iran and Afghanistan). He became one of the most renowned astronomers in the Abbasid court of Baghdad in the ninth century, its moment of greatest splendour. Just as the Moorish captive Isabel found her way into the arms of Fortunio by taking on the guise of her Christian mistress Estefanía, so Arabic texts like Abū Maʿshar’s found their way into Christian hands by taking on new guises through translation into Latin and Romance. The fact that writers from Jiménez de Rada to Lope depict this astrologer figure (Abentumet/Albumasar) as “learned” (doctus/sabio) underscores the reputation that Muslim intellectuals had throughout the Middle Ages and well into the seventeenth century as paragons of astronomical and scientific learning. Although Albumasar’s appearance as a character in twelfth-century Morocco is anachronistic, the fact that he is cast as an internationally renowned expert (“no sólo en Fez y Marruecos conozido … mas que a España, con los ecos de mi fama, nombre doy”) attests to his enduring relevance as a symbol of scientific investigation even nine centuries after his death and thousands of kilometers from his home. Albumasar actually appeared in at least two other plays by Lope de Vega (“El primer rey de Castilla” and, granting his authorship, “La difunta pleiteada”) as well as in numerous\n\n28\n\nRyan Szpiech\n\nother contemporary plays, including the 1615 English work “Albumazar” by Thomas Tomkis (Halsted, “The Attitude” 217). “Albumasar” appears with regularity in the abundant astrological publications of the sixteenth century, more than any authors other than Ptolemy and Aristotle, and his name even came to be listed in the Inquisition’s list of forbidden books and authors (Lanuza-Navarro, “La astrología” 307–8). The enduring popularity of the figure of Abū al-Maʿshar, from the work of Jiménez de Rada and Alfonso in the thirteenth century to Mariana in the sixteenth and Lope and others in the seventeenth is a testament to the Arabic role in the growth of scientific knowledge in Iberia. As Albumasar tells Abdelmón, “Rey de África serás, / A España con gente irás” (You will be king of Africa; you will go to Spain with men) (ll. 745–6; Kennedy, Lope 118). Yet the logic of literary flourishes such as Lope’s transformation of Ibn Tumart into Abū al-Maʿshar evokes an even longer historical chain of transmission and influence, one that stretches back even before Abū al-Maʿshar to the Greek, Egyptian, and Babylonian traditions on which his science was based. Using Lope’s scene as a starting point, this chapter will limn the approximate contours of that chain by giving a broad overview of the history of science and technology from its beginnings alongside the birth of writing in ancient Mesopotamia to its growth in the ancient Mediterranean, and from there to its flourishing in the medieval Islamicate world and its transmission into the world of Latin Christendom through the translations and institutions of medieval Iberia. This brief (and necessarily schematic) overview will emphasize the point – not an original one but one that is often forgotten or overlooked, and thus deserving of repetition – that the growth of science in early modern Europe relied on a long precedent of scientific exploration in the ancient and medieval worlds, a reliance in which Spain played a preponderant role. The dynamic dramatization of science and technology on Spain’s Golden Age stage is a logical culmination of the unique history of engagement with ancient science in medieval Iberia. Science in Sumer? Tracing the history of scientific thought requires an initial decision about what “science” (> Lat. scientia, “knowledge”) is and how it may be distinguished from other forms of knowledge of and engagement with the world. I will define science as the abstract notion of a communal attempt to organize and theoretically systematize knowledge of\n\nFrom Mesopotamia to Madrid\n\n29\n\nthe physical world, involving a shared methodology or technique, an advance in technological knowledge and use, and some kind of testing that includes the control of variables and the repetition of results. On this broad basis, one might note that all of these factors accompanied the birth of agriculture, and it might therefore conceivably be proposed that some form of proto-scientific thinking – a first step towards thinking systematically about the physical world of cause and effect – roughly corresponded to the Neolithic Revolution that marked the transition from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a settled society in the hilly flanks of the Fertile Crescent, approximately 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. From this perspective, one might also say that the earliest foundations of scientific inquiry – although obviously far different from modern ideas of science – preceded written language itself, which is first attested in the pictographic and cuneiform tablets of the second half of the fourth millennium BCE in Sumer (Mesopotamia) and shortly after in Egyptian hieroglyphics. Later parallel (and independent) developments in China, India, and Mesoamerica might also qualify as evidence of this early mode of thought that necessarily accompanied human settlement. To be sure, not all would agree that such developments qualify as steps towards scientia, and many in the history of science impugn the attempt to characterize certain knowledge as “science” – even in a loose way – before the concept in its modern usage came into being in the eighteenth century. Historian David Wootan, for example, asserts categorically that “Modern science was invented between 1572, when Tycho Brahe saw a nova, or new star, and 1704, when Newton published his Opticks” (Invention, 1). Although he concedes that “there were systems of knowledge we call ‘sciences’ before 1572,” he follows Karl Popper’s model in defining true scientific knowledge as that which, even if correct, is always potentially “falsifiable” and never fully verifiable (Popper, Logic 20). Science must be, by definition, anti-metaphysical – empirical and logical and not mythical or dogmatic. From this perspective, any use of the term “science” to characterize empirical knowledge before the Enlightenment is illegitimate because such knowledge, it is reasoned, was not sought purely for itself but instead served another purpose (such as predicting the future, understanding the gods, etc.). For Wootan, moreover, “true science” must be “prepared to question every long-established certainty … in light of new evidence” (Invention 1–2). Yet as Thomas Kuhn poignantly argued over fifty years ago, “in science … novelty emerges only with difficulty, manifested by resistance, against a background provided by expectation … Normal science\n\n30\n\nRyan Szpiech\n\n(is) a pursuit not directed to novelties and tending at first to suppress them” (The Structure 64). While the assumptions of pre-modern learning about the physical world were the result of a world view fundamentally at odds with our own – astronomy necessarily went hand in hand with astrology, chemistry with alchemy, mechanics with magic – that incommensurability does not in itself disqualify such learning as unscientific, even though it does not meet modern standards. As Kuhn notes, science can only function by rejecting all that falls outside of its operational paradigm (103), including earlier knowledge now disproved or rejected, yet that rejection does not in itself constitute a defining proof of what science actually is. Scientists rely on the contextual and partly arbitrary bias of their operational paradigm in order to function, and thus science must advance through the revolutions that accompany “paradigm shifts” and not simply grow with the incremental accretion of knowledge. Yet to summarize the history of science as a narrative of birth, growth, and transmission – whether one begins in the year 10,000 BCE or 1572 CE – is necessarily to construct an artificial teleology, what Herbert Butterfield calls a “Whig interpretation of history,” which he defines as “a scheme of general history which is bound to converge beautifully upon the present” (The Whig 11). Such a diachronic history of science – whether told as accretion or revolution – is factitious and flawed by design, for the many communities that have contributed to scientific knowledge in the past do not pertain to any single tradition and do not present a single chain of causation and accumulation of knowledge. As Bruno Latour insists, we must distinguish between individual sciences and the notion of “science” itself, which he defines as “the politicization of the sciences through epistemology” (Politics 10). Nevertheless, despite its flaws and its implicit Eurocentrism, such a history of “science” writ large, understood as an artificial composite of individual sciences all relying on a common epistemology and metaphysic, can, with caveats, also be heuristically useful as an approach towards a richer and more nuanced contextualization of early modern learning. Taking such perspectives into account, it is clear that any treatment of the history of science, especially one that traces transmission of knowledge over time, must navigate between the Scylla of “Whig history” and the Charybdis of paradigm bias by resisting the impulse to equate all influence with progress and by provisionally including in the definition of science all systematic and empirical engagement with the world, regardless of the religious or cultural assumptions about the nature of existence held by its practitioners.\n\nFrom Mesopotamia to Madrid\n\n31\n\nAlthough the Neolithic Revolution may be an absurdly early point to begin the story of science, I have proposed it only as a way to exemplify the point that foundational narratives are cultural fictions, not empirical facts, whose points of beginning are held to be appropriate only within a certain operational paradigm. If the invention of agriculture is not a sufficient watershed in the birth of scientific thinking as defined by a modern perspective, the invention of writing (first in Sumer, and subsequently – and independently – in Egypt, China, and Mesoamerica) may well be, because it offered a technology of information storage that cognitive scientist Merlin Donald has called the first “externalization of symbolic memory” (Origins 363). Although seemingly first employed in Mesopotamia for explicitly bureaucratic and administrative (rather than aesthetic or religious) functions (Cooper, “Babylonian” 72), it was a precondition for the growth of Babylonian mathematics and celestial observations. Its decisive influence is analogous to the eventual impact that the mechanization of writing (after Gutenberg’s metallurgical advances in the casting of moveable metal type for the printing press, ca. 1440) had upon the dissemination of astronomic observations and the resulting theories, and the growth of science more generally, in the sixteenth century, or to the impact of electronic computing on research since World War II.3 Throughout the history of science, advances in technology have proceeded in tandem with advances in knowledge. Many of the Sumerian advances in technology were mechanical – the use of the wheel, the stone arch, irrigation, and the plow, etc. – and certainly many of these relied not simply on methodology but also on writing and numeric calculation. The Sumerians developed the ability to compute place value in a base 60 number system, from which derived the division of hours into sixty minutes, of minutes into sixty seconds, of circles into 360 degrees, of years into approximately 360 days, etc. This advanced mathematical notation, which was inherited by the Akkadians (who ruled Mesopotamia from the second half of the third millennium) and Babylonians (in the first half of the second millennium) facilitated complex geometric and algebraic calculations including a rudimentary version of the Pythagorean Theorem and the accurate sexagesimal representation of the square root of two, accurate to six decimal digits (van der Waerden, “Mathematics” 667–71). The notion of place value allowed the later introduction of a placeholder for zero (although it was not used for mathematical calculation). Such knowledge formed the base of Mesopotamian architectural advances\n\n32\n\nRyan Szpiech\n\n(such as ziggurats and domed ceilings) and more importantly supported an advanced culture of astronomical observation and data recording. Between 1200 and 1000 BCE, Babylonian astronomers, making use of earlier knowledge and observations, compiled the first known star catalogues. These included not only names of scores of stars and recordings of their movements, but also constellation names that would be used in later astrological theories. Some of these (the scorpion, the lion, the bull, etc.) would be used in Greece in the fourth century BCE, forming the basis of some familiar astrological names (Scorpio, Leo, Taurus, etc.). The Babylonians recorded thousands of omens both celestial (e.g., future eclipses) and astrological (e.g., future misfortunes and disasters) based on astronomical data recorded over centuries (Rochberg, The Heavenly 4–5). At the same time, the exploration of the physical world in ancient Babylonia was roughly contemporary with a parallel tradition of astronomy and applied engineering in Egypt. Unlike the base 60 system of the Babylonians, the Egyptians employed a more familiar decimal system, although without a place-value logic and, like the Greeks after them, without the use of a zero, even as a placeholder. While arithmetic calculations used a cumbersome system of doubling and addition, basic geometrical principles were approximated, including a rough estimate of the value of pi (different from but approximately equal to that used in Babylonia), basic Pythagorean triples for laying out right triangles, and a set of number pairs whose ratios approximate the Golden Ratio (in which the ratio of two of these numbers is equal to that of their sum to the larger number), already in use in the design of the Great Pyramid of Giza in the twenty-fifth century BCE. These geometrical advances were, like those of the Babylonians, principally for astronomical/astrological purposes, charting the stars and measuring the calendars in order to regulate agriculture in the Nile valley. When Lope’s Albumasar predicts the future kingship of Abdelmón, he is, in a way, carrying on an astrological tradition stretching back millennia, all the way to the astronomical and astrological traditions of ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt. Growth in Greece Despite such beginnings, it is customary to identify the “true” origins of modern science in Greece, when pre-Socratic philosophers of the sixth and fifth centuries BCE first began systematically to pose questions about the natural world in purely physical terms. Thales of Miletus\n\nFrom Mesopotamia to Madrid\n\n33\n\n(d. 546 BCE, western Anatolia) is considered to be the founder of Greek geometry, having noted that the angles of the base of an isosceles triangle are equal, and that the ratios of line segments created by crossing two intersecting lines and two parallel lines are exactly proportional. He also postulated a unity of physical matter as based on one substance, water, and his ideas directly influenced Aristotle’s theories of matter and the nature of the universe (Graham, The Texts 17–18; Longrigg, “Thales” 297). Although we know very little about Pythagoras (d. 496 BCE, on nearby Samos) and his followers, numerous ideas (such as the Pythagorean theorem or a cosmology of perfectly spherical orbits of the sun, moon, and five planets around a central fire) are associated with the Pythagoreans, mostly without textual evidence (Graham, The Texts 905–6; Von Fritz, “Pythagoras” 224). Other postulates can be more certainly associated with contemporary pre-Socratics, such as Heraclitus (d. 475 BCE), positing the universe as flux guided by unchanging laws (Graham, The Texts, 135), Empedocles (d. 430 BCE), theorizing four elements to the universe, earth, air, fire, and water (326–7), and Democritus (d. 370 BCE) and his teacher Leucippus, posing an atomic theory of the universe as made up of tiny, indivisible pieces that formed the building blocks of all matter (516).4 The reflection on the cosmos in physical terms as a world ordered by constants and physical laws similarly guided the medical ideas of Hippocrates (fl. second half of the fifth century BCE) and the natural philosophy of Theophrastus (d. 287 BCE). Undoubtedly the most scientifically influential insights were the cosmological, biological, and metaphysical theories developed by Aristotle in his vast oeuvre. One fundamental aspect in which he is often distinguished from his teacher Plato is in the epistemological value he concedes to analytical reasoning on the basis of perceptible things. Whereas Plato (Republic 479e) argues that, “those who view many beautiful things but do not see the beautiful itself … have opinions about all things, but know nothing of the things they opine” (Collected 719–20), Aristotle (Metaphysics 13.1080a) rejects the independent existence of “forms” in themselves. “It might be thought impossible that substance and that whose substance it is should exist apart; how, therefore, could the Ideas, being substances of things, exist apart?” (Complete 1:1707). Although his logical method was more aimed at metaphysical questions – beyond sensory perception – than at empirical observations, in subsequent centuries it came to provide, when coupled with his rejection of the independent existence of forms, a foundation for deductive analysis of facts gained through empirical observation.\n\n34\n\nRyan Szpiech\n\nWhile it is misleading to see Aristotle as an exclusively “empirical” thinker (Owen, “Aristotle” 252), there is no question that Aristotle’s rejection of forms as independently knowable and his assertion (Metaphysics 1.992a) that “philosophy seeks the cause of perceptible things” (Aristotle, The Complete 2:1568) came to have profound implications for the study of the physical world in later centuries. Apart from the definitive influence of his Organon (the six works on logic) on later philosophy, his influence on later scientific thought stemmed from his defence of the logical organization of knowledge, as well as his theory of the four causes (material, formal, efficient, and final), and more generally his organization of “sciences” (epistēmai) into categories. His taxonomies of knowledge are reflected in the different foci of his works. His Physics, Meteorology, and On the Heavens were all influential on later investigations in astronomy. His books on animals, on movement and respiration, and on birth, death, and change (such as On Generation and Perishing) were foundational for the later development of life sciences. Above all, his exposition on deductive reasoning in the Posterior Analytics was determinative for the establishment of a logical method of investigation.5 His works were the subject of commentaries both in antiquity and, in translation, throughout the Middle Ages. Yet for all of the originality of presocratic and Classical Greek scientific thought, it is important to view it in the wider context of the ancient world. This implies, on the one hand, recognizing the many parallel discoveries in the East, both India and China, whose interaction with Greek science is uncertain (and is still being debated), and on the other, considering the notable parallels between Babylonian mathematics and astronomy and those that developed in Egypt and Greece.6 While it is not impossible that some of the Presocratics in western Anatolia came into contact with Egyptian or even Babylonian ideas – Herodotus (Histories 2.109, in The Persian 399) and Aristotle (Metaphysics 1.981b, in The Complete 1:1553) themselves claim as much – the period when such a transfer of knowledge is most probable is in the Hellenistic period (i.e., from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE until the death of Cleopatra upon Roman conquest of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt in 30 BCE), or in the Roman period that followed. It was in these centuries that Alexandria became a preeminent intellectual centre, boasting a vast library of sources from diverse regions of Eurasia and supporting research in many areas.\n\nFrom Mesopotamia to Madrid\n\n35\n\nThe dynamic culture of Hellenistic Alexandria supported the work of a few key thinkers who, together with Aristotle, would prove to be the most influential over the subsequent two millennia. Euclid of Alexandria (d. 265 BCE) developed the geometrical ideas of the Pythagoreans by extending the Aristotelian methodology of deduction in measurement and calculation. His Elements would become the most influential book in mathematics until the Enlightenment. Hellenistic mathematicians such as Archimedes of Syracuse (d. 212 BCE), although perhaps best known for developing numerous mechanical innovations (such as the hydraulic screw and water clock), made important advances in the measurement of the volume and area of irregular shapes and objects, including the use of “infinitesimals” to calculate area along a curve, thus anticipating methods of integral calculus formalized by Newton and Leibniz (Clagett, “Archimedes” 229). Greek scientific thought was partly preserved by the Romans, and various Latin works of the Roman period that were read and copied in the Latin Middle Ages drew from Greek scientific texts. Lucretius (d. ca. 94 BCE) built on Democratus and Empedocles to develop his own theory of “atoms.” Pliny the Elder (d. 79 CE) drew heavily from Aristotle and Theophrastus in writing his natural history. Greek sources provided a basis for Roman advances in technology and mechanics, from metallurgy and mining to hydraulics and engineering to agriculture and cartography. Yet it was the Greek intellectuals in the Western Roman Empire that produced the scientific writing destined to be the most canonical in subsequent centuries. Dioscorides (d. 70 CE), a physician from Cilicia in Asia Minor, travelled around the eastern Mediterranean and elsewhere gathering samples and information to produce his De materia medica, a pharmacological guide to plants and medicines. Copied and translated extensively, it circulated in Greek, Latin, and Arabic and remained a standard reference book for fifteen centuries (Riddle, “Dioscorides” 121). The writings of the Greek physician Galen (d. ca. 200 CE), who moved from western Anatolia to Alexandria to Italy, were profoundly influential in medicine well into the early modern period. Galen further advanced anatomical knowledge through the dissection of animals (but not humans). He made reference to earlier Greek anatomists such as Herophilus (d. ca. 260 BCE) and Erasistratus (d. ca. 240 BCE), who were among the only figures to dissect and vivisect the human body before the late Middle Ages – using criminals condemned to death as subjects. Galen also developed the teachings of Hippocrates to propose physiological theories concerning the nervous system, the\n\n36\n\nRyan Szpiech\n\ncirculatory system, and the theory of four bodily humors (blood, yellow bile, black bile, phlegm), which formed the basis of medieval medical theory (Kudlien, “Galen” 231–3). Galen’s long legacy was matched only by his contemporary Ptolemy (d. ca. 170 CE), who became a definitive source for all medieval and early modern astronomy. Working in Roman Alexandria, Ptolemy wrote studies on cartography, music, optics, astronomy, and astrology. His greatest influence came in the Mathēmatikē Syntaxis (better known by its Arabic-derived title Almagest, a transliteration of the Greek for “the greatest”), the first and only comprehensive treaty on astronomy from the ancient Greek world. Based on the cosmology of Aristotle and Hipparchus (d. 120 BCE), the likely inventor of the astrolabe, Ptolemy’s Almagest systematized a model of the universe that would be definitive throughout the Middle Ages. Ptolemy described the orbit of the planets, sun, and moon around the earth, drawing directly in some cases from Babylonian observations (Aaboe, Episodes 62–5). Besides including a star catalogue and a description of the movement and properties of each celestial body, including the fixed stars, it introduced the quadrant (for celestial measurement determined by estimating altitude and angle) and extended and formalized the theory of epicycles (small circles made by the planets and stars centred on the path of their larger orbit) in order to explain the problem of apparent retrograde motion observed from earth. The geocentric model proposed by Ptolemy remained the dominant model until Copernicus replaced it with a heliocentric model in the sixteenth century CE (Toomer, “Ptolemy” 202). When Abdelmón tells Albumasar “la antigua esperiencia/ has puesto en eterno oluido,” he is referring to the long legacy of ancient Greek science, a legacy preserved and extended in the medieval Islamicate world. Brilliance in Baghdad In 391 CE, Coptic Pope Theophilus of Alexandria clamped down on all pagan temples in his city, including the famous temple of Serapis (the Serapheum), and at some point around this time or a few decades after, the remaining centres of study were largely abandoned. When, less than two decades later in 410, Rome itself fell to the Visigoths, scientific learning was interrupted, although not entirely wiped out. Commentaries on earlier works survive from the fifth century, although less remains from the sixth and seventh centuries. In Latin Europe, education in the seven liberal arts, which in the early Middle Ages took\n\nFrom Mesopotamia to Madrid\n\n37\n\nplace almost exclusively in monasteries, was divided into the Trivium (grammar, rhetoric, dialectic) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music), and thus a rudimentary attention was given to scientific subjects, although increasingly without the support of key Greek texts. While there is some material from places, such as Ravenna, attesting to an ongoing critical engagement with some ancient authorities on medicine and philosophy, the extent of learning in many places was greatly diminished by the late sixth century. Although some practical texts such as Hippocrates and Galen’s Method of Healing or copies of Dioscorides did continue to circulate, “the resources for the maintenance of an active intellectual tradition of medicine were also diminishing” (Nutton, “Medicine” 84). Most critically lacking was the majority of the Aristotelian corpus, and much other speculative Greek scientific thought was also absent, or at least not widely available. What was transmitted included Boethius’s translation of Porphyry’s (d. ca. 305 CE) commentary on Aristotle’s Categories known as the Isagoge, and Isidore of Seville’s (d. 636) Etymologies, which seems to have drawn most of its information from Roman writers and encyclopedists only distantly informed by Aristotle and other Greek scientific texts (Pliny, Varro, Solinus, Boethius) (Isidore, Etymologies 11–17). Isidore’s capacious work was critically important for the preservation of ancient Latin sources, but his eclectic summaries did not provide enough sound information or theoretical reflection to support systematic exploration of the physical world (Sharpe, “Isidore” 28). Yet the rise and spread of Islam in the seventh century led to the preservation and renewal of that ancient tradition, expanding the intellectual legacy of the ancient Greek world to an unprecedented degree. Although translation between Greek and Arabic for bureaucratic or diplomatic purposes was not uncommon in the first century of Islam, the Umayyad Caliphate (662–750) was not distinguished for its patronage of scientific learning and seems to have produced few translations of Greek scientific material (Gutas, Greek 23–4; Morrison, “Islamic” 116). However, the founding of Baghdad in 762 as a new capital after the Abbasid overthrow of the Umayyads in 750 set the scene for a proliferation of translating activity and intellectual exploration. This was in part due to the geographical location of the newly founded capital, which was strategically chosen to symbolize the union of the Arab caliphate with the political tradition of the Sasanian Persian empire. The second Abbasid Caliph al Manṣūr (d. 775) adopted the core values of Sasanian political ideology, which represented itself as the intellectual heir of all\n\n38\n\nRyan Szpiech\n\nthe other civilizations that had gathered learning from all corners into its borders, by patronizing translation and supporting the development of astrology and astronomy, mainly for political prognostications (Gutas, Greek 34–35; Ragep, “Islamic” 35). Among the first translations were pre-Islamic Zoroastrian astrological texts. This core focus on astrology naturally led to a robust interest in astronomical research in the subsequent century. In the wake of this founding ideology, a string of Abbasid caliphs in the ninth century, especially Harūn al-Rashīd (d. 809), al-Maʾmūn (d. 833), and their successors, officially patronized an intensive translation effort designed to gather into Arabic versions all learning of value. An important factor determining translation activity was the availability of texts, and caliphs sought copies to expand their libraries, which seem to have housed, at least under later caliphs, works of a very wide variety, from Greek classics of every sort acquired from Byzantium, to texts of Sanskrit, Paḥlavi (Middle Persian), Syriac, Coptic, and even possibly Ethiopian and Ḥimyaric (Yemenite) origin (Gutas, Greek 57–9). Many translators came from Nestorian and Syrian Christian backgrounds, and also included Muslims, Zoroastrian Persians, Sabians (Ḥarranian star worshippers), and Jews. Yaḥyā ibn al-Bātrīq (early ninth century) made some of the first Arabic translations of Hippocrates and Galen, as well as Ptolemy’s Tetrabiblos (on astronomy) and Aristotelian books on zoology (Goodman, “The Translation” 480–1). Among the most famous and influential translators was the Nestorian Christian Ḥunayn ibn Isḥāq (d. 873), who worked as chief court physician in the caliphate of al-Mutawakkil, writing original works of medicine and natural philosophy and translating into Arabic scores of works of astronomy, medicine, mathematics, magic, and philosophy from Pahlavi, Greek, and Syriac versions (Goodman, “The Translation” 487–8). His translations included, among many others, works of Euclid, Ptolemy, Hippocrates, and above all, Galen. The latter was translated into Arabic on the basis of Syriac versions formerly made from Greek originals in the sixth century by the Monophysite Christian priest and physician Sergius of Rēshʿaynā (d. 536) (Iskander, “Hunayn” 235). Ḥunayn’s use of Syriac material prepared by earlier Christians points to the important role of Christian activity in the Sinai peninsula and the Levant in late antiquity in providing a precedent for the later Arabic translation movement in Baghdad, although as Gutas points out, “before the “ʿAbbāsids, relatively few secular Greek works had been translated into Syriac … the bulk of the Greek scientific and\n\nFrom Mesopotamia to Madrid\n\n39\n\nphilosophical works were translated into Syriac as part of the ʿAbbāsid translation movement during the ninth century” (Greek Thought 22). In this context, Ḥunayn’s medical texts were influential in the development of medicine in the Islamicate world, making Galen’s vast oeuvre available in Arabic and influencing later polymath physicians such as the alchemist al-Rāzī (d. 925), Aristotelian philosopher Ibn Sīnā (d. 1037), and medical historian Ibn Abī Uṣaybiʿa (d. 1270). His disciples also continued to produce translations after him, including, in stages, virtually the entire Aristotelian corpus as well as Aristotle’s later commentators including Prophyry and Alexander of Aphrodisias (fl. ca. 200 CE). Another notable translator in Baghdad was the pagan intellectual Thābit ibn Qurrah (d. 901), who revised Ibn Isḥāq’s translations of Euclid and Ptolemy and disseminated teachings of Pythagoras and Archimedes. Over the course of a century and a half, in a process of knowledge transfer whose scale had no comparison in prior human history and remains unique today, scores of scholars translated and composed thousands of works on all known subjects of learning. Baghdad thus became a uniquely advanced centre of scientific knowledge, one that not only amassed learning from elsewhere, but that critiqued Greek sources and advanced scientific thought in unique ways (Saliba, Islamic 25). The translations included work from all known scientific branches, but most attention was paid to mathematics/geometry, medicine, and, because of its political ramifications, astronomy/astrology. The initial approach followed the tradition received from Indian astronomy via Sanskrit sources and Persian translations, and one of the earliest translations/adaptations of this sort were the Sanskrit astronomical tables Siddhānta (Sindhind) by Ibn Ḥabīb al-Fazārī (d. 806). Following this tradition, scholars prepared similar astronomical handbooks (azyāj, sing. zīj) that included tables of star data, and most famous among these was the original work Zīj al-Sindhind of al-Khwārizmī (d. after 847) (Toomer, “al-Khwārizmī” 360). He wrote numerous works of astronomy and mathematics, and was especially distinguished for introducing mathematical notation and “Hindu numerals,” the partial basis for modern “Arabic” numeral notation today. This system of Indian reckoning and observation cultivated by al-Khwārizmī and applied by Abū Maʿshar and others coexisted in Baghdad with the Greek tradition. This was reflected above all in works by al-Battānī (d. 929), whose tables helped disseminate Ptolemy’s geocentric model of the solar system. Further east, in Isfahan, the rival Buyid empire also patronized astronomical investigation,\n\n40\n\nRyan Szpiech\n\nproducing work such as the Book of Fixed Stars (Kitāb ṣuwar al-kawākib) of ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Ṣūfī (d. 986), which drew from Eastern traditions and also expanded the Ptolemaic charting of the stars with more careful measurements. The intense research in Greek astronomy and various branches of the Aristotelian corpus supported advances in technology as well as theory. Astronomers in Baghdad and beyond thus made critical improvements of Greek astronomical tools, principal among which was the Ptolemaic astrolabe. Al-Farghānī, working in the ninth-century Caliphate of Baghdad, describes the first construction of an astrolabe in Islamic lands a century before (Morrison, “Islamic” 116). Also developed were the sundial and the Ptolemaic quadrant, used for measuring the inclined position of celestial bodies and deriving information based on these calculations, such as calendric data and latitudinal position. The transfer of such technology in the form of the circulation of scientific instruments exemplifies in concrete terms how ancient Greek scientific learning was appropriated and developed by Muslim scientists, from whom it was later passed to Latin Christendom (Rodríguez-Arribas et al., Astrolabes). Throughout the Islamicate world, astronomical learning was also regularly used for prognostication. Even a century before al-Ṣūfī, Abū Maʿshar – also Persian – worked in the Baghdad caliphate where he not only compiled his own zīj tables, but also wrote extensively on the application of that Hindu-Persian astronomical tradition, combined with Aristotelian cosmology, for astrological interpretations and predictions (Pingree, “Abū” 236). Later polymaths such as Ibn Sīnā and the astronomer al-Bīrūnī (d. ca. 1048) were highly critical of astrology (Morrison, “Islamic” 126), debating aspects of Aristotle’s theories (without discarding his categories) and tackling not only astronomical questions such as the weight of celestial bodies, but also metaphysical questions such as the possibility of a void or the eternity of the universe (Dallal, “Early Islam” 124). Despite these later criticisms, Abū Maʿshar’s fame as an astrologer spread widely, especially in Latin translation, making his name known “not only in Fez and Marrakech” and other centres of the Islamicate world, “but also in Spain,” reaching all the way to Lope de Vega in the seventeenth century. The translation activity continued in Baghdad for well over a century, but by the second half of the tenth century, its activities waned. In competition with both the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad and the Fatimid Caliphate in Cairo, the young caliphate of Cordoba sought to promote learning and science by expanding libraries and patronizing\n\nFrom Mesopotamia to Madrid\n\n41\n\nthe copying and study of numerous works of Greek and Arabic science. In the middle of the century, Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII sent the Greek-speaking monk Nicholas to Córdoba at the request of the first caliph ʿAbd al-Raḥmān III (d. 961), along with a Greek copy of Dioscorides’s De materia medica. Nicholas collaborated with the caliph’s Jewish vizier Ḥasday ibn Shaprūṭ (d. 975) and the local scholar Ibn Juljul (d. ca. 994), who produced a new updated translation into Arabic (Vernet, “Ibn Juljul” 187). The greatest expansion took place under the rule of the next caliph, Al-Ḥakam II (d. 976), who not only made important expansions to the Great Mosque of Cordoba, still standing today, and the completed construction of the palatial city of Medinat al-Zaḥra, now in ruins, but also assembled a vast library of materials gathered from across the Islamicate world. As it was destroyed after the fall of the caliphate in 1031, no certain evidence of its size is known, but chroniclers of the period have claimed it contained some 400,000 volumes. Although modern historians, based on reports of an author-title catalogue list of some forty-four volumes, estimate that the number probably did not exceed 40,000 (Sánchez-Moliní Sáez, “Las bibliotecas” 87–9), the library was undoubtedly immense for the period. It certainly contained, along with numerous private libraries of the caliphate, many of the most important works translated in Baghdad in the previous century. Medicine in al-Andalus reached an advanced degree of sophistication, and a number of figures from the caliphate and subsequent reigns of the Almoravids and Almohads are recognized as some of the most important physicians of the medieval Muslim world. Al-Zahrāwī (d. 1013) was the leading surgeon in the caliphate (Hamarneh, “Al-Zahrāwī” 584). His compendious encyclopedia of surgical practice, which bears the droll title The Book the Arrangements of Medical Knowledge for One who is Unable to Compile One for Himself (or for short, Kitāb al-Taṣrīf, Book of Arrangements), became a standard reference text for centuries. Other Andalusī scholars continued to contribute to an advanced medical culture in Iberia into the thirteenth century. These included Ibn Zuhr (d. 1162) of Seville – a pioneer in medical experimentation with animals who claims in his Book of the Facilitation of Therapeutics and Diet (Kitāb al-Taysīr fī al-Mudāwāh wa-l-Tadbīr) that he demonstrated the safety of a tracheotomy by performing one on a goat (Catahier, “Ear” 523) – the Muslim Aristotelian philosopher Ibn Rushd (d. 1195) – who wrote commentaries on Galen, Ibn Sīnā, and Aristotle’s Physics and Metaphysics – and the Jewish Aristotelian Moses Maimonides (d. 1204). All of these later physicians seem indebted to Al-Zahrāwī’s approach to surgery.\n\n42\n\nRyan Szpiech\n\nThe greatest scientific scholar under al-Ḥakam II’s caliphate was the mathematician and astronomer Maslama al-Majrīṭī (d. 1007), who not only improved on the existing translation of Ptolemy’s Almagest, but also translated and updated the zīj of al-Khwārizmī and translated Ptolemy’s Planispherium (Pingree, “The Indian,” 246; Vernet, “Al-Majrītī,” 39). He also introduced to al-Andalus the voluminous encyclopedia of scientific, philosophical, and religious knowledge known as the Epistles of the Brethern of Purity (Rasāʾil Ikhwān al-Ṣafā), compiled in Iraq in the previous century and drawing heavily on Greek sources and theories. Al-Majrīṭī was one of the most pivotal figures in the transfer of the scientific learning in Baghdad to the caliphate of Córdoba (Samsó, La ciencia 84–93). When Lope’s Abdelmón tells Albumasar, “si alguno ha nac̦ ido/ que sepa esa inc̦ ierta c̦ ienc̦ ia, / tú solo en el mundo has sido,” he underscores the unique role of the medieval Islamicate world as the heir and keeper of the wealth of Greek science. Translation in Toledo When Lope’s Albumasar predicts the future kingship of Abdelmón, he is speaking about ʿAbd al-Muʾmin’s rise as leader of the Almohads in the middle of the twelfth century.
