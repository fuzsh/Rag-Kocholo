        "text": "WISE stands for the Workshop on Information, Selection, and Evolution. The core objective of WISE is to bring together some of the world’s most thoughtful and influential thinkers from a range of backgrounds to listen, learn, and share ideas related to lawful, universal processes by which order arises in the cosmos.\n\nWISE, which will take place October 23-25, 2024, at the Carnegie Institution’s beautiful Washington D.C. campus, will bring together 80 leading thinkers in topics related to the intertwined topics of evolution, emergence, selection, function, information, energy/entropy, statistical mechanics, and the arrow(s) of time. We want to create a forum for constructive and respectful interaction and advocacy for the wide range of creative theories and concepts that are now in play—models with many overlaps and echoes, as well as original ideas. The time is ripe to bring the wider community together to discuss shared interests and to form new interdisciplinary collaborations and working groups.\n\nThe WISE workshop will be held at the Carnegie Science Earth and Planets Laboratory, located in Northwest Washington, D.C., just west of Rock Creek Park.\n\nThe workshop will primarily be held in the Greenewalt Building (#3 on the map below).\n\nAddress:\n\nGreenewalt Building\n\nEarth & Planets Laboratory\n\nCarnegie Science\n\n5241 Broad Branch Road, NW\n\nWashington, DC 20015\n\nAmple parking is available on and around campus. A shuttle (Moran Transportation) will run from the hotel to the workshop each day.\n\nFor those who wish to walk, the 1.3-mile route is on sidewalks and mostly along residential streets.\n\nAmple parking is available on and around campus.\n\nA shuttle (Moran Transportation) will run from the hotel to the workshop each day.\n\nFor those who wish to walk, the 1.3-mile route is on sidewalks and mostly along residential streets.\n\nMore About Campus arrow_forward\n\nReagan National Airport (DCA) is approximately nine miles and 30 minutes from EPL and the workshop hotel; Dulles International Airport (IAD) is approximately 25 miles and 40 minutes; and Baltimore-Washington International (BWI) is approximately 36 miles and 50 minutes away during non-peak travel times. Travel times by vehicle depend on traffic conditions.\n\nTaxi/Uber is the quickest in low traffic (note that “rush hour” can extend from 7-9 AM and 3-7 PM on weekdays) but the most expensive method ($50-$120/trip depending on which airport and traffic conditions). Airport group shuttle options have become limited with the expansion of Metro in the region.\n\nMetro is the most economical airport ground transportation ($4 DCA, $6 IAD). It is slower than vehicle travel during low traffic periods but can be quicker during rush hour. The DCA airport is directly serviced by Metro’s Yellow and Blue Lines and IAD airport is directly serviced by the Silver Line which opened in November 2022. Travelers from both airports need to transfer to the Red Line (towards Shady Grove) at Metro Center to reach the Friendship Heights Metro Station. Estimated travel time to/from DCA is 45 minutes each way and to/from IAD is 75 minutes each way. Schedules, fares, and additional trip planning information can be found at the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's website.\n\nEPL is approximately 1.5 miles from three Metro stations on the Red Line: Van Ness-UDC (at the intersection of Connecticut Ave. and Van Ness), Tenleytown-AU (at the intersection of Wisconsin Ave. and Albemarle), and Friendship Heights (at the intersection of Wisconsin Ave. and Western Ave.).\n\nThe format of the workshop will mirror that of the Carnegie Institution’s 2008 Deep-Carbon Workshop—an event that led to numerous collaborations and new funding opportunities exceeding $100 million.\n\nIn a departure from tradition, diverse early-career speakers will give most of the plenary talks, while more established experts will present large-format posters where every participant can spend focused time learning and interacting. Significant time will be devoted to small topical breakout sessions and informal interaction opportunities. By the third day, some breakouts will focus on topics that emerge from the workshop in real-time.\n\nWe expect that by the end of the workshop each of us will understand other ideas in much greater depth, and that we will have identified key questions for future collaborative research.\n\nThe workshop hotel, Embassy Suites by Hilton Washington DC Chevy Chase Pavilion, is connected to the Friendship Heights Metro Station on the Red Line via an interior entrance through the Chevy Chase Pavilion. Arriving by Metro: exit the Friendship Heights platform towards Western Ave and then exit the Metro Station towards Chevy Chase Pavilion (see picture to right) where the hotel is located. Take either the elevator or escalator to Level 2 in the mall (under renovation) to reach the hotel lobby which is one level above street level.\n\nAddress:\n\nEmbassy Suites by Hilton Washington DC Chevy Chase Pavilion\n\n4300 Military Rd NW, Washington, DC 20015, Chevy Chase, MD 20815\n\n(tel: 202.362.9300).\n\nRoom rates and local taxes will be direct billed to EPL/Carnegie. Travelers are responsible for other charges (which may be eligible for reimbursement).\n\nCheck in is after 3 pm and check out is by 11am. Your room rate includes a made-to-order breakfast from 6:30 – 9:30 am on weekdays. The hotel offers 2 complimentary drink tickets/day for a reception from 5:30 – 7 pm each evening at Willie’s Bar.\n\nYes! On the mornings of the workshop at 8:15 AM, a shuttle (Moran Transportation) will transport participants staying at the hotel to EPL on the Broad Branch Road Campus. (Remember to have breakfast first at the hotel!).\n\nDaily pick up will be outside the Military Road exit from the hotel where a small pullout is available for the shuttle to park. The shuttle will also be available at other times as indicated on the workshop agenda. Otherwise, travelers should be prepared to walk/Uber/taxi/Metro as needed. These ground transportation expenses are eligible for reimbursement. Local participants with cars may also be able to provide transportation.\n\nMore details on the shuttle timing and event agenda to come."
