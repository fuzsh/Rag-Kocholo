        "text": "An Interview with BC Alum Roneel Naidu\n\nRoneel is a Radiologic Technologist at Overlake Medical Center & Clinics. He earned his AA in Radiologic Technology at Bellevue College.\n\nPrior to enrolling in courses at BC, what was your educational background and/or profession?\n\nPrior to enrolling at Bellevue College, I was a high school student at Oliver M. Hazen High School. During my senior year, when I turned 18, I worked at a Red Robin to save up money for school and also volunteered in the emergency room at Overlake Medical Center to help get my foot in the door in the medical field.\n\nWhat prompted you to come to BC and choose the coursework you pursued?\n\nI heard Bellevue College had an exceptional Radiologic Technology program while volunteering at Overlake, where I stumbled upon some technologists who told me that Bellevue College’s programs were top-notch and that getting into the program was going to be difficult but well worth it. So, from that, I determined that I had to do well in my prerequisites to get into the program.\n\nHow has your experience at BC enriched your personal/professional life?\n\nMy experience at Bellevue College was impactful. Being so young and getting into a professional program made me grow up fast. It made me realize if you truly want something nobody is going to hand it to you, you yourself have to go out and get it. My experience was eye-opening, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything else – it helped me grow up.\n\nDuring your time at BC, did you participate in extracurricular activities on campus?\n\nI’m still presently finishing some classes at Bellevue College, and I have plans to finish my BAS program. But, during the Radiologic Technology program, I was the President of the Collimator Club. We hosted fundraisers, hosted a picnic celebration and held a graduation party for the technologists’ graduation ceremony.\n\nWhen not in the classroom, was there a spot on campus you enjoyed going to? If so, what made that space enjoyable?\n\nBesides being in the classroom, I enjoyed two spots – in the cafeteria there would always be something new, from people playing video games to someone playing the piano that is set up. It’s always something new, which is why I always enjoy going there to grab a bite to eat. Another great spot I enjoyed was the couches and chairs in the T Building; it was a great place to sit and relax for a bit or to get some last-minute reviewing/studying in.\n\nDo you have a most memorable professor or course?\n\nDuring prerequisites for the Radiologic Technology program, I had to take Anatomy & Physiology 241 & 242. I took these classes with Professor Dennis Gorsuch. There were only about eight people in my class. Dennis was the best professor I’ve ever seen. He took his time with the students, and, no matter what, he was always available for questions. I also became his TA in Anatomy & Physiology 241.\n\nHow do you use your experiences at BC to make an impact in our community today?\n\nI use my experiences at Bellevue College to impact our community in a positive way. I’ve learned that no matter what the situation is to not get stressed out and get frustrated because if I do that, things will only get worse. Having learned those skills helps me in the field of Radiology because it is a stressful environment sometimes, but we work swiftly and calmly to get the task done and completed to the best of our abilities. We are proud to provide our best work.\n\nWhat kind of impacts would you like donors to know they have when they support opportunities at BC?\n\nI have to say thank you to the donors. I’m sure they hear “thank you” a lot, but truly, you help give students the opportunity to receive an education. That is quite remarkable to me. By helping me through a scholarship, you helped my parents see me achieve the goal of becoming a Radiologic Technologist. My parents came to the US from Fiji with very little. Donors have aided me in earning my degree. I continue to work hard to achieve more, and I continue to strive for success.\n\nWhat value do you see BC, as a whole organization, has to our region?\n\nI see that Bellevue College has a great community. Everyone seems to know everyone. It’s becoming a larger campus and while people seem to be busy, you can always get a smile or hello from someone walking to their class. Bellevue College has a great atmosphere and campus vibe, and that’s hard to find within different schools.\n\nHow do you give back to your community?\n\nI like to give back to my community. I donate some of my earnings to a Hindu temple my parents have been going to, since I’m able to afford more things now.\n\nWhy is it important to give back to your community?\n\nWhile volunteering I notice I feel so uplifted. It feels great to help the greater community. A simple act of kindness can go a long way in someone’s eyes – helping an elderly man to his car, or helping patients with their bags. The joy I get is something I won’t forget, and they won’t forget either. I’m big on karma, so do well to others and believe things will be good to you.\n\nGive a BC student a future like Roneel’s today!\n\nMore Student Stories"
