        "text": "Larry graduated from Arthur Hill High School, Class of 1961 and Central Michigan University in 1965 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology. In 1969, he graduated from Kirksville College of Osteopathy and Surgery. Larry served a one-year internship at Saginaw Osteopathic Hospital and a three-year residency in Ophthalmology in Florida. Larry returned to Saginaw in 1973 and began his practice of 40 years. In 1995, he opened Andersen Eye Associates and in 2006 he opened the Andersen Surgery Center.\n\nHe was a past President and Fellow of the American College of Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology. He was a member of Saginaw County Osteopathic Association and practiced on the staff of Saginaw Osteopathic, Saginaw General, St. Maryâ€™s and Covenant HealthCare Hospitals.\n\nIn 1998, he created Saginaw Area Foundation for Eye Care, which provides eye exams, glasses, and necessary surgical procedures, for the underinsured. It was a great passion of his life to provide access to quality eye care for those who could not otherwise afford it. Throughout his life, Larry was an avid hunter and fisherman, traveling to Africa, Mexico, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Alaska, British Columbia, Quebec, Newfoundland, and the Western United States in pursuit of his hobby."
