        "text": "Maggi Peyton Gallery\n\nHosted by the Manhattan Borough President’s Office and President Gale Brewer\n\nOctober 4th to December 6th, 2021\n\n1 Centre St. South Entrance, 19th Floor\n\nNew York, NY 10007\n\n(347) 239-9086\n\nWelcome Back is a group exhibition featuring over thirty artists’ responses to the unprecedented COVID-19 Pandemic. Curated by Jean Sonderand for Maggi Peyton Gallery, and hosted by the Manhattan Borough President’s Office, the exhibition is an opportunity for artists and residents to come together and consider the variety of public and private experiences we have faced over the last two years. Welcome Back is a celebration of our resiliency as a city and culture, and an invitation for New Yorkers to consider how we will grow and adapt as we recover over the years to come.\n\nEach artist in this exhibition had a unique response to the pandemic, but certain themes jump out as we look at the collection as a whole. Some ticked away the time reading the daily updates in the news, with headlines and crosswords marking the uncertain trajectory of an unfolding, global crisis. PPE, consisting of masks, gloves, and medical ephemera, littered our lives and our streets, accumulating physically as well as symbolically. With the world cut off, the familiar shape of our homes was radically transformed. Our bedrooms and offices became safe havens in which entire lives were carried out, while a view out of a window became a portal to an unfamiliar world of vacant streets. Meanwhile, our obsession with sanitation led others to re-investigate the meaning of touch and contact, especially when physical closeness could spell a death sentence for those we cherished. Scarcity, uncertainty, and boredom drove us nearly mad, but the same forces inspired many to re-envision our lives, our communities, and our aspirations.\n\nWelcome Back is a reflection of how our sensibilities have changed and adapted to this ‘new normal’, and an invitation to embrace these experiences as they guide the trajectory of our recovery, in New York and beyond.\n\nThis exhibition is generously supported by City Artists Corps Grant made to the curator, Jean Sonderand.

Senstad was raised in Singapore and Norway, today she lives and works between New York and Oslo. Having studied video art at the University of California at Berkeley and earned her BFA Honors in Photography from the Parsons School of Design, she went on to study film at the New School for Social Research in New York. Notable exhibitions include Radical Light (2021) at Seinajöki Kunsthall, Finland and Radical Light (2020) at Kai Art Center in Estonia, a monumental light environment accompanied by acclaimed composer JG Thirlwell’s sound composition, Music for Plutocracy at S12 Gallery, Norway (2021), How We Live Together, Yi Gallery, New York (2020), Seen Unseen (2018) at He Xiangning Art Museum in Shenzhen, China with an immersive light sculpture and color environment ELEMENTS II (2018); light art survey Through The Spectrum at Athr Gallery alongside James Turrell, Robert Irwin, Carlos Cruz Diez and Leo Villareal with ELEMENTS I (2018); the 55th (2013) and 56th (2015) Venice Biennales and Bruges Art and Architecture Triennale (2015). Her video work has been shown worldwide at Centre Pompidou, Haus Der Kultur Der Welt, Beirut Art Center, The Canadian Museum of Nature, Museum of Modern Art Ukraine, Dallas Aurora, Eva Peron Museum, Oslo Screen Festival and K4 Gallery.\n\nStatement\n\nMy exhibition How We Live Together at Yi Gallery in Brooklyn, set to open in March 2020 was effected by the pandemic in numerous ways. First the gallery was closed so we carefully opened it in August 2020, and secondly, the whole exhibition concept changed from a societal theory based installation, to a humanistic and critical response to what we as New Yorkers were going through in the spring and summer of 2020. I developed the text piece, with the same title as the exhibition title, How We Live Together, in 2018 , a long time prior to the pandemic, based on the philosophical theories of Roland Barthes on ideorrythmic living formats in relation to societal structures and ideas of utopia, which in Barthes 1977 world, lies in tolerance of the fellow citizen – yet transformed the concept of isolated living formats, to responding to the crisis. The exhibition included 4 works: the wall text piece in a brass covered corporate signate asesthetic “ How We Live Together” , a neon wall work, “Ascension/Descension Graph” as a response to Cuomo's daily briefings on the numbers of hospitalized and deceased from Covid televised as a corporate graph, “Circle of Babel” plexiglass cultures seeking to unify pour separateness, and a short film in collaboration with acclaimed actor Bill Sage, famous from Amercian Psycho, Law & Order and much more, who performed a remote reading of a selection from Barthes book, and footage from our lives during the pandemic as a way to creatively process the isolation. The 10 minute short film can be viewed on request as it is password protected and has been screened with Streaming Museum in NY and Yi Gallery in 2020. There are 4 films in total in the How We Live Together short film series I created with Bill Sage.\n\nThe sculpture series Tower of Babel, was built during the early stages of the pandemic, while I also investigated historic art works of human and societal erosion. Mythology and iconic symbolism seemed to reflect our condition and the story of god, or a larger consciousness punishing the human race for its wickedness by separating us from our families and loved ones. The sculpture installation The Circle of Babel suggests a unifying togetherness of separated parts.\n\nCV\n\nSOLO EXHIBITIONS:\n\n2021\n\nKunsthalle Seinäjoki, Finland, Radical Light – Elements VI, June 16 – Sept 4, with a sound environment composed by JG Thirlwell.

For 25 years, she served the City as a firefighter and fire officer, rising to the rank of Captain. A PBS documentary about her career “Taking the Heat” can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6l56ShNMAE&t=63s She continues to mentor girls and young women both in firefighting and other non-traditional work and is also a volunteer tour guide on the 9-11 Memorial.\n\nOn retiring from the FDNY in 2006, knowing nothing about drawing or printmaking, Brenda decided to study printmaking at the Art Students League, where she quickly fell in love with stone lithography. Part of the WNET documentary about the League, Berkman has always been eager to collaborate with other League artists. She created a collaborative art project commemorating the tenth anniversary of 9/11 involving 12 other artists connected to the League. After an exhibition at Westbeth, that group of works was then collected and exhibited by the League. For the 15th anniversary of 9/11 in 2016, Berkman created “Thirty-six Views of One World Trade Center,” to document the rebuilding of lower Manhattan after 9-11. Drawing and printing hundreds of stone lithograph prints of 36 iconic views of the new One World Trade Center over the course of three years (averaging a print per month!), Berkman’s series was collected by the 9/11 Memorial and Museum and is currently the subject of a solo exhibition at St. Olaf College on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of 9/11. A news story about her artist talk can be found at https://kstp.com/minnesota-news/september-11-2001-exhibit-at-saint-olaf-college-altered-skyline-brenda-berkman/6240618/ Her book about Thirty-six Views was published in September.\n\nA short video about the Thirty-six Views project is at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7Bp7LXlf2M&feature=youtu.be\n\nBerkman is the featured artist for the 2021 White House Fellows conference this October.\n\nBerkman serves on the Board of Directors of Monumental Women (MW), dedicated to honoring women and people of color in public spaces. On the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment on August 26, 2020, she coordinated the unveiling of MW’s Women’s Rights Pioneers Monument (WRPM) in the midst of the pandemic, the first statue of real women in the 167-year history of Central Park. The unveiling ceremony can be watched at https://monumentalwomen.org/ and more information is at https://monumentalwomen.org/the-unveiling/ She also coordinated MW’s Talking Statues project for the WRPM, an app featuring the voices of Meryl Streep, Jane Alexander and Viola Davis (English), and Rita Moreno, America Ferrara and Zoe Saldana (Spanish). Monumental Women’s projects include a “toolkit” to help more communities honor women in public spaces and a 5-borough Women’s Rights History Trail.\n\nStatement\n\nIn March 2020 when the Covid pandemic shut down art studios all over New York City, stone lithograph printmakers like me did not have options to continue our printmaking – we had no access to the litho stones, presses and other equipment we need. Even when vaccination was possible and studios started to reopen with limitations, I still had health concerns about mass transit, infection rates, etc. that made me hesitant to fully embrace resuming artmaking. For one of my first images after returning to the studio, I drew a small stone to resemble a cave, with nooks and openings that reminded me of how I felt being separated from most family and friends. Two little eyes peering out of the “cave” express the hesitancy I still feel about resuming normal activities. The surrounding green vegetation is inviting and symbolic of hope and renewal.\n\nCV\n\nCollaborative art project I organized commemorating the tenth anniversary of 9-11\n\nhttp://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/145297/artists-bring-9-11-inspired-works-to-west-village?ap=1&MP4 (2011)\n\nThirty-six Views exhibit at DC 37 gallery (2016)\n\n\"From Lawyer to Firefighter to Artist\" exhibit at the Charles P.

Since 2000 she has lived and worked in Jackson Heights, Queens. Her paintings, drawings and mixed media pieces have been exhibited at the Queens Museum, Langston Hughes Cultural Center, Resobox Gallery, NYC; The Buckman Center, Memphis, TN; as well as site-specific watercolor installations for the Mid-Manhattan Library, NYC. Grace In Dwelling, her companion book to the art of the same title, was published by Ragged Sky Press on the occasion of this piece exhibited at the Queens Museum. Shaping the Container, her art/movement piece was supported by a Queens Council for the Arts 2018 New Works Grant. She is a recipient of a 2021 NYC City Artist Corps Grant.\n\nStatement\n\nConcentration is disciplined, requiring practice.\n\nI am a visual artist, primarily. I paint and draw. My studio practice languished with the pandemic’s escalation here in NYC where I live and work, so the necessary concentration came hard. Making the piece, “Flip Book, March 2020,” was the means to move through my inertia and give my thoughts and hands a place of focus.\n\nMost mornings early in the pandemic my husband and I took long walks to Flushing Meadows - Corona Park in our home borough of Queens. We plotted a route skirting contact with people, arriving at the park consoled to be in such open space. Quite possibly, the landscape in FM-CP was the largest, unoccupied panorama in NYC during that spring. The Unisphere, commissioned for the 1964-65 World’s Fair, became a fixture of my study. Designed by Gilmore D. Clarke, the steel monument represents the world’s continents and major mountain ranges in relief and is encircled by three rings that represent the orbits of early satellites. As my perception of the monument changed with light and weather conditions, I was unfailingly fascinated. I drew this motif as a landmark in Flip Book’s composition, next painting an over-sized microscopic coronavirus overhead a draped torso (me). Beneath this vellum layer is a second paper layer with a painted shadowy figure encircled by text and continuous calendar numbers.\n\nThe text reads:\n\nDecember November Octo\n\nOctobet October No ember\n\nDee rember Janu Can uary\n\nFeb February March March\n\nMarch Fevery January\n\nJune May April Apart May B\n\nMaybe Maybe Jump July A\n\nAugust September See\n\nSee Ember Ag\n\nA Gust July Why\n\nJump June May A\n\nMaypole May Pop Hop\n\nHop Hop Jump\n\nSkip\n\nFlip Book\n\nThe circle of our walks to the Unisphere intersected the orbit of changing information transmitting the world’s pandemic condition. The studio became a satellite in these rings – a space to process and make something of my finite movement.\n\nAlthough my studio is only one flight down from my home floor in my building, I still take a big breath, open the door, and hurry down the stairs.\n\nCV\n\nSOLO SHOWS:\n\nShaping the Container, Art-Movement/Queens Arts Fund New Works Grant, NYC (2018)\n\nScrolling Confluence, Art in the Corner Room, Mid-Manhattan Library, NYC (2016)\n\nScrolling Confluence: Supernova, Art Wall on Third, Mid-Manhattan Library, NYC (2016)\n\nLove Letter (to Light), Levy Gallery, The Buckman Center, Memphis, TN (2014)\n\nDirt, rock and far views, Langston Hughes Library and Community Center, NYC (2014)\n\nNot so fast, Resobox Gallery, NYC (2012)\n\nResidency, APEX ART C.P., NYC (1999)\n\nTurn your back, it’s gone, Memphis Center for Contemporary Art, Memphis, TN (1989)\n\nNew Pictures, Grae Gallery, St. Louis, MO (1988)\n\nStitch, Memphis College of Art, Memphis, TN (1986)\n\nOrganic Configurations, Olney Central College, Olney, IL (1980)\n\nGROUP SHOWS:\n\nAll Things Paper, Raiches Taller 222 Art Gallery, Tucson, AZ (2021)\n\nDrawings in the Time of Renewal, LIC-A, NYC (2021)\n\nAqua Sagrada, Raíces Taller 222 Art Gallery, Tucson, AZ (2021)\n\nFAME, Ivy League Gallery, Minneapolis, MN (2021)\n\nColor Blind, Cultural Alliance of Western Connecticut, Danbury, CT (2021)\n\nMujeres, Mujeres, Mujeres Artists 2021, Raices Taller 222 Art Gallery, Tucson, AZ (2021)\n\nOverThinker, Tyme Lapse Studio Gallery, London, UK (2021)\n\nArtists Responding To Gallery, London, UK (2021)\n\nRoche Faces of a Community, Southern Arizona Arts & Culture Alliance, AZ (2021)\n\n2021, FLATFILE GALLERY, NYC, (2021)\n\nProcess -> Project: What Comes Out of Our Sketchbooks, Jamaica Center for the Arts & Learning, NYC, (2021)\n\nSmall Works, Clarksville Gallery, West Nyack, NY, (2021-2020)\n\nRegalitos, Raices Taller 222 Gallery, Tucson, AZ, (2021-2020)\n\nWhat Matters Most, The Artist Essentials, (2020)\n\nCorazones Unidos, Raices Taller 222 Gallery, Tucson, AZ, (2020)\n\nPride In Bloom, PFLAG Rockland, Rockland County, NY, (2020)\n\nUSPS Art Project, Ely Center of Contemporary Art, New Haven, CT, (2020)\n\nThe USPS Art Project, Pelham Art Center, NYC, (2020)\n\nNew York State of Mind, Inside Small Art Exhibition, NYC, (2020)\n\nDrawings In A Time of Social Distancing, LIC-A, NYC, (2020)\n\nArt Like Air and Water: Mobile Zine & Artist Book Library, Southeast Queens Artist Alliance, NYC (2019)\n\nDiary of a Radio Junkie, Guest Artist, Frosch and Portmann, NYC (2019)\n\nFirst Radio Headlines Heard of the Day, Guest Artist, Esther Massry Gallery, Albany, NY (2019)\n\nOFF THE WALL, The Plaxall Gallery, NYC (2019)\n\nFall Forward, The Factory, NYC (2018)\n\nI Dream in Blue and Green, The Factory, NYC (2018)\n\nResistance, Jersey City Theater Center, Jersey City, NJ (2018)\n\nDisillusionment – Perspectives Beyond, Taller Boricua Gallery, NYC (2018)\n\nQueens Art Intervention: Dwelling, commissioned intervention/piece, Queens Museum, NYC (2017-18)\n\nFall Salon Show 2017, The Plaxall Gallery, NYC (2017)\n\nThe Art of the Garden, The Lazarus Gallery, New Rochelle, NY (2017)\n\nPop-Up, Queens Arts Council, NYC (2017)\n\nI catch the pattern, Langston Hughes Library and Community Center, NYC (2015)\n\nI catch the pattern, LIC ARTS OPEN 5, NYC (2015)\n\nSummer Show, Guild Hall, East Hampton, NY (2015)\n\nWinter, Hamptons Art Hub, East Hampton, NY (2015)\n\nLocal Color, Jamaica Center for the Arts & Learning, NYC (2014)\n\nRoots/Drawing Connections, MSKCC In-Fusion Center, NYC, 12-month loan (2013)\n\nBridging the Gap, LaGuardia Community College, NYC (2013)\n\nBridging the Gap, Flushing Town Hall, NYC (2013)\n\nVirtual Delight, Melissa Wolf Fine Arts, NYC (2013)\n\nSQUARE, Space Womb Gallery, NYC (2013)\n\nNatural Elements, Memorial Sloan-Kettering, NYC, 18-month loan (2013-14)\n\nBIG QUEENS DRAWING SHOW, Jamaica Center for the Arts & Learning, NYC (2012)\n\nBacklash, Soho 20 Chelsea Gallery, NYC (2012)\n\nBloom Time, Space Realty Group, NYC (2012)\n\nWomen in Art/Film 2012, Queens Museum of Art, NYC (2012)\n\nWords Become Air, Space Realty Group, NYC (2012)\n\nA Sense of Place, Space Realty Group, NYC (2011)\n\nARTSPoetica, A-Lab Forum, Crossing Gallery, NYC (2011)\n\nSquare Exhibition, Space Womb Gallery, NYC (2010)\n\nBABEL, Space 37, NYC (2010)\n\nOncology on Canvas International, Union Station, Washington D.C.

She received her education in New York City public schools, earned her degree at Queens College and received further art education at the Arts Students League.\n\nGlasser’s family history is deeply entrenched in the history of the City. Her father’s family worked in a building trade, and her mother’s in the garment and entertainment industries. Her personal generational connection to the City and its growth gives her a layered, archaeological view of it that is reflected in her work. Recently, she has worked on a commission for the production of permanent artwork onto architectural glass for a building in Queens, and created a monumental installation for a group exhibit at FIT inspired by these influences. Her work has been shown in numerous solo and group shows nationally and internationally, and is held in private, corporate and municipal collections.\n\nGlasser works from her studio in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn.\n\nStatement\n\nWhile wandering my neighborhood during the pandemic, I sadly took note of the emptiness. I passed the location of a restaurant where for decades my family had celebrated happy occasions; it was like a gut-punch to see that it had closed. My head swimming with memories, I peered inside and beyond the darkness I saw only ghostly furnishings. Wanting to hold onto something that I knew was already out of reach, I stood up against the window and took some photos through the glass – not expecting much. The photos, however, unexpectedly captured reflections of translucent layered images that appeared to be floating into the ether. I knew that when I got back into the studio I would somehow paint these images. The Party’s Over is a series of paintings inspired by this and the many closings of familiar and beloved spots in NYC neighborhoods as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Fiesta Flags, playful ubiquities in Mexican restaurants, are depicted as lost objects, shadows and reflections, emblematic of the disappearances and losses we have experienced. On the bright side, over the month we have seen the streets of New York come alive, and we can even see Fiesta Flags beckoning again.\n\nCV\n\nSELECTED EXHIBITIONS:\n\n2021\n\nCAUSALITY, Atlantic Gallery, (pending Nov.), curated by Kim Power\n\nWELCOME BACK, Maggi Peyton Gallery, New York, NY\n\nWOMEN CELEBRATE WOMEN, El Barrio Art Space, New York, NY\n\nROOTED, Greenly Art Space, Signal Hill, CA\n\nMADE IN NEW YORK, Schweinfurth Art Center, Auburn, NY, juror, Sharon Loudon\n\nCONNECTIONS V, Atlantic Gallery, New York, NY\n\nREFRESH!, Organized by Odetta Digital in collaboration with the SHIM Art Network on Artsy\n\nPAGE TURNER, Organized by Odetta Digital in collaboration with the SHIM Art Network on Artsy\n\nUSPS ART PROJECT, A multi-venue traveling exhibit, Greenly Art Space, CA\n\n2020\n\nSEA CHANGE, Organized by Odetta Digital in collaboration with the SHIM Art Network on Artsy\n\nPANDEMIC PROOF, Organized by Odetta Digital in collaboration with the SHIM Art Network on Artsy\n\nESSENTIAL WORKS, Organized by Odetta Digital in collaboration with the SHIM Art Network on Artsy\n\nUSPS ART PROJECT, a multiple venue traveling exhibit, Pelham Art Center, Pelham, NY; Ely Center for Contemporary Art, New Haven, CT; Sunset Studios, Dallas, TX; Art Gym, Denver, Denver, CO; inLiquid, Philadelphia PA\n\n2019\n\nPICTURING SPACE, FIT Pomerantz Center Lobby, NYC (installation)\n\nALLEYWAY ARCHAEOLOGY: SLOW SPACES BETWIXT AND BETWEEN, An exhibition of art and artifacts in conjunction with the Department of Anthropology, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York (installation; collaboration)\n\n2018\n\nALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MYSELF, Cigar Factory, LIC, NY\n\nMADE IN NEW YORK, Avelon’ARTS, Lavelanet, France\n\n2017\n\nSPACES, Long Island City, NY\n\nADAPTATIONS 2, Goodhue House Lobby Gallery, NY (solo)\n\nCAUTIOUS OPTIMISM, Fitton Center for Creative Arts, Hamilton, OH (installation)\n\n2016\n\nWHEN LANGUAGE MEETS ART, The Louise Hopkins Underwood Center for the Arts, Lubbock, TX\n\nA DIFFERENT VISION, Plymouth Center for the Arts, Plymouth, MA\n\nARTIST III EXHIBITION, Miller Gallery, Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, NY\n\nPAINTING AND SEEING, Univ. of NC, Wilmington, NC\n\n2014-15\n\nHOME, Theresa A.

The works produced take the form of two and three dimensional wall works, installations, and tabletop cityscapes, made from video, video stills, and diverse materials. A long time New Yorker, Elizabeth Riley graduated from Barnard College and received an MFA from Hunter College. The artist recently completed a proposal, as a finalist, for a Percent for Art commission for a public school in New York City. April 2021, her two-dimensional wall work was presented in a 2-person show at Spantzo Gallery on New York City’s Lower East Side. She was a resident at the Millay Colony, November 2020, and has participated in 14 artist residencies, in the US and aboard. “Ribbons Become Space,” a solo show of her work, featuring an installation including six live video elements, was presented at SL Gallery, in Manhattan, 2019. In 2018 her video, “The Life of a City,” was screened as part of the BRIC Garage Door Video Series, at BRIC Arts-Media House in Brooklyn. Also in 2018 the artist curated \"Trill Matrix\" for The Clemente Center on the Lower East Side, a show of seven dynamic women artists. In December, 2017, Elizabeth Riley’s wall sculpture was on display in Excessive Frugality at Odetta Gallery in Brooklyn. In April, 2017, the site-specific participatory installation, “City Remix,” appeared in the exhibition, Reconstruct, at LIU in Brooklyn, and in June, 2017, the 20 x 20 ft installation, “Paper Dragons, Brooklyn,” which functions as a walk-in, physical video, appeared in Bigger, Bolder, Better at 470 Vanderbilt Ave, Brooklyn, sponsored by Chashama. In 2016 the multipart tabletop cityscape, “Video City,” appeared in the show LAND AIR PLACE at Project Artspace in Manhattan.\n\nStatement\n\n“Sheltering-in,” in order to focus on artwork, is something artists do in the best of times. Being asked to do this for the sake of personal and community safety for this artist wasn’t a stretch. While witnessing the news and sights and sounds of the pandemic saddened and opened my heart, my private acts as an artist gave me comfort and even joy. My lifelong struggle, even before the pandemic, has been between feeling locked down due to my cultural experience growing up female, and a strong drive to “open up.” Being in “lock down” for external, legitimate reasons, provided a sense of relief, while I was further freed to “open up” in the pursuit of, and exploration of my art practice.\n\nMy work addresses questions concerning the complex and changing world we inhabit and our “mixed reality,” living between physical and digital/virtual contexts; are we our everyday, familiar, material past, or our digital future, and is this apparent “mixed reality” of the moment to be embraced or resisted. Is the digital present the bells and whistles of an unchanged and familiar humanity, or does it define us and the future? This project is embodied in two and three dimensional wall works, installations, and tabletop cityscapes, made using video, inkjet-printed video stills, and diverse materials.\n\nMy primary working materials, video and video stills, are from the same source but utilized in immaterial and material forms. Video is light and motion, while the video stills are a material expression of the live videos. These video stills have been exported from my short videos, imported into a page layout program and often arranged and printed out as lengths of consecutive video stills. I fold and roll these to make shapes I then build sculptures with.\n\nRecently, during the 2020-2021 pandemic, I’ve been collaging two dimensional wall works from torn and shaped video stills. This current body of work began in 2019 as large 3-D wall works which referenced multiple qualities of “light”: the light of the “soul” that combine the internal and external; light that’s both here and not as a new thought originates; radiant and funky city light; the light that animates video and makes it real to our eyes; and light captured and made material in video stills, and in these current works symbolically present as orange and yellow, pigment printed on paper.\n\nIn the development of my art my drive has been in looking through the video media shapes and structures I’ve made, toward forming an embodiment of the present and the future. This embodiment is based in personal experience and the sensation body, and also in a determination to reach beyond the self, and beyond the personal moment. A propelling motive in my work history and process has been in reaching beyond the limited roles provided for women and enforced by the social standards which I encountered as a young woman and young artist. Another major influence on my art has been the raw and nurturing influence of the urban environment that’s been my home as an adult, and speaks to me continually about the future, and our direction as a society.\n\nCV\n\n2021\n\nElizabeth Riley, Mohamed Khalil – GALANTE, Spantzo Gallery, New York NY\n\nFriends of Dorothy, Spantzo Gallery, New York NY\n\nEmbody, Ely Center for Contemporary Art, New

Significant to her practice are the many residencies and grants she has been awarded; City Artist Corps Grant, artAmari (Crete), Cill Rialaig (Ireland), Mano Y Mente (New Mexico), and the prestigious Marie Walsh Sharpe Studio Program, to name a few. From a humorously scathing Wall Street Journal review to positive words from New York Time’s Roberta Smith, Booth has a rich bibliography that spans print and digital genres. She maintains a Brooklyn studio through the ChaShaMa Space-To-Create Program.\n\nStatement\n\nDuring the NYC Pause, I decided a way to help alleviate my isolation and stress was to create a Covid-Diary, documenting my experience during this unique time. As someone who enjoys doing crossword puzzles, I made it part of the project to do a puzzle each day and then use parts or all of it in a spontaneous collage drawing. I noted a diary entry about my day on one edge and the top news headlines I saw on my Apple and Google newsfeeds on another. These drawings represent days 3, 23, 44, 68, and 211 of the shutdown. All together I did 366 crossword puzzle collages. The project gave me a focus during those empty, silent days and posed a challenge to my creative process. And yes, I still enjoy doing crossword puzzles!\n\nCV\n\nAWARDS\n\n2011-2021 Studio Residency, Chashama, Brooklyn Army Terminal, Brooklyn NY\n\n2021 City Artist Corps Grant, NYC Department of Cultural Affairs, NY,NY\n\n2014 Artist in Residence, artAmari, Crete, Greece\n\n2013 Artist in Residence, Cill Rialaig, County Kerry, Ireland\n\n2007 Artist in Residence, Mano Y Mente, Tularosa, New Mexico\n\n2005 Finalist: Aljira Emerge Program, Newark, NJ\n\n2003 Winner-Concorso Per Artisti, Comune di Roma, Italy\n\n2003 Ucross Foundation, Alternate-Artist Residency, Ucross, Wyoming\n\n2002 Fellow, “Food for Thought” Emerging Artists, Sumei Multidisciplinary Arts Center, Newark NJ\n\n1999 Resident, Fundacion Valparaiso, Almeria, Spain\n\n1998 Full Fellow, Vermont Studio Center, Johnson, VT\n\n1997 Recipient, Marie Walsh Sharpe Foundation-Studio Program\n\nSELECT SOLO EXHIBITIONS\n\n2016 Through the Dark (Darkly), Sheen Center for Thought and Culture NY, NY\n\n2015 The Raw and the Cooked, Honey Badger Motel, Brooklyn, NY\n\n2011 The Universe Goes Looking For An Answer, chashama Gallery 461, NY, NY\n\n2010 Die Suche des Universums nach einer Antwort, Feral Kunst Galerie, Aigen, Austria\n\n2009 Speechless, Art on Armitage Gallery, Chicago, IL\n\nthinking about water, Figment NYC, Governor's Island, NY\n\nBooth at Solomon's Porch, Culture Caravan, Brooklyn, NY\n\n2007 To the Nth Power, The SkinNY, NY, NY\n\n2003 del dicho al hecho, Art for Change Carlito’s Gallery, E.

Photography allows me to interact with people I would otherwise not be able to engage with. My camera act as a bridge to connect with people photograph.\n\nMy choice of subject comes from my interest in ideas about human realty and intuition. I enjoy finding photographs that capture sincere moments. I photograph people in their natural environment because I want to preserve the moment. I use a Sony a7 full frame mirrorless camera. The a7 uses a 24.3 megapixel CMOS sensor with a low-pass filter and on-chip phase detection.\n\nOriginally, I started taking photos because I was interested in exploring human rights and identity. I am a self-taught photojournalist based in New York City and Dominican Republic. Since my days as a high school student I was very concerned with the issues that affected the Dominican diaspora in New York City. Being a photography enthusiast allowed me to see these issues from a different lens. Photography afforded me the opportunity to approach different people within the community including the community leaders of the time to confront these different issues. Using the camera as my tool, to voice these issues and facilitated my interaction and approach towards people. It wasn’t until my college years that I became aware of the important role women play in our community. As ironic as it sounds, me being a woman in a patriarchal society it is very hard to understand this. From that moment on, my work was mainly focused on the different activities that women were performing in our community in their daily lives, in the arts, in school, in the political arena, education, etc. My work as a photographer has consisted in exposing the inequalities I see everywhere I go.\n\nWhen people see my work, I’d like them to feel that moment of shared emotion and experience. Photography is a source of some of my utmost pleasure.\n\nStatement\n\nMonday March 16, 2020 marked the beginning of the COVID-19 global pandemic in New York City. On this day, the world came to a standstill and life as it was known stopped. Millions of establishments closed their doors, some forever, while online businesses flourished and became the new normal.\n\nThe virus spread rapidly and some of the immediate measures were: social distancing, isolation, curfews and lockdowns. This led to vast underemployment/unemployment, widespread of hunger, and an upsurge in homelessness just to mention some of the immediate impact of the pandemic.\n\nWe all have been affected by the pandemic, However, the impact is felt differently depending on our status as individuals and as members of society.\n\nI, for example, was overwhelmed working from home but had to adjust. I was forced to learn many new computer applications, to better support my students with their online learning. Nonetheless, I was lucky that I didn’t get exposed to the virus while keeping a tiny part of society “functioning.”\n\nDuring the first 100 days of the pandemic, I illustrated a photographic diary of everyday life at Inwood, NYC. I exposed the dreadful and unfortunate situations that my community faced during those dark days of uncertainty.\n\nI, also, became more aware of the importance of self-care and mindfulness.\n\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic that masked people, unmasked the world nations sanitary system\n\nCV\n\nEXHIBITIONS\n\nphotography-in-berlin -PAN-DIARY\n\nThe Children's Art Carnival and Centro Civico Cultural Dominicano -Resilience\n\nnomaanyc-in/out-Light/Dark\n\nnomaanyc-Healing and Community: Connecting with Inner Strengths\n\nnomaanyc-Women in the Heights: Creating for the Future\n\nBetween Ambiguous Loss and Tenuous Hope, No. 1, 9\"x12\", 2021, China marker, acrylic, ink and graphite on watercolor paper\n\nBetween Ambiguous Loss and Tenuous Hope, No. 2, 9\"x12\", 2021, China marker, acrylic, ink and graphite on watercolor paper\n\nBetween Ambiguous Loss and Tenuous Hope, No. 3, 9\"x12\", 2021, China marker, acrylic, ink and graphite on watercolor paper\n\nBetween Ambiguous Loss and Tenuous Hope, No. 4, 9\"x12\", 2021, China marker, acrylic, ink and graphite on watercolor paper\n\nBetween Ambiguous Loss and Tenuous Hope, No. 5, 9\"x12\", 2021, China marker, acrylic, ink and graphite on watercolor paper\n\nBio\n\nI’m a New York based artist in Manhattan, focusing on drawing and painting. Besides attending RISD and receiving a BFA with honors from Pratt Institute in drawing, I have a master’s degree in Counseling Psychology from Goddard College and extensive postgraduate training in Narrative Therapy in both Chicago and Cambridge, MA.\n\nWhile not a direct influence on my art, the underlying philosophy of innovative language, power and narrative energizes and strengthens my creative practice.\n\nStatement\n\nMy art has focused continuously on a personal vision with a very strong sense of linear evolution. I work in ongoing series of drawing / paintings derived from the same imaginary or landscape-like source and explore the inherent, expressive meanings in that image by returning to the original drawing structure in each new work, searching for meaning content in the nuances found and elaborated in each new piece.\n\nThis is a particularly contemporary concern relating to the work of artists like Vija Celmins or Jim Dine, but extending back through artists like Morandi, Picasso and Monet.\n\nWhat has always fascinated me is the nature of psychic energies––the sixth sense we all possess to varying degrees that allows us to be receptive to the subtle energies and signals in our surroundings and inner landscape. It is this tension between positive and negative energies that are not separate from nature but are forces of invisible phenomena that can be felt, not seen.\n\nMy work is intuitive and direct, using unforgiving materials that resist erasure. This demands that my love of detail doesn’t overwhelm the negative space and allows subtractive techniques to create light and energy to then become the subject.\n\n\"Between Ambiguous Loss and Tenuous Hope\" explores an otherworldly space of highly charged energy. Using China marker, acrylic, ink and graphite on watercolor paper, this series of drawing / paintings was created in the summer of 2021 during the Covid-19 Pandemic in New York. Like many residents, I was sequestered and isolated in my apartment.\n\nWhat unconsciously emerged in these intense, kinetic works were glimpses of bird imagery, in light or slightly shaded negative space. In the unnatural silence of a great city without its usual street noise, the sounds of songbirds became a prominent daily occurrence. As losses escalated, this reminder of the natural world prevailing gave hope, however tenuous. Where birds might ominously appear as omens of doom, they also offer the possibility of escape.\n\nThe intention to avert negative forces is the basis of my ritual in creating art that carries psychic energy against the darkness beyond our control. In describing my work, the Lexington Herald-Leader wrote, “Its power lies in its ability to invite and unnerve simultaneously.”\n\n\"Between Ambiguous Loss and Tenuous Hope\" is my response of resilience to the Pandemic and invites the viewer to respond with intuitive strength and imagination.\n\nCV\n\nDIGITAL SELECTIONS\n\n2020-2021 School of Visual Arts, New York, NY\n\nContinuing-Education Website (Contemporary Drawing Studio: The Drawing Habit)\n\nSOLO & FEATURE EXHIBITIONS\n\n2010 North Central Missouri College, Trenton, MO\n\nThe Doris Rider Gallery\n\n2002 University of Rio Grande, Rio Grande, OH\n\nThe Esther Allen Greer Museum\n\n1999-2001 The John E.

It also includes documentation of 2 major artistic events - Generator: Pestilence Part 1 and In The Realm of Anansi from Assisi that I was working on both as covid emerged and continued thru the summer of 2020. That the theme of Generator is specifically about how diseases affect culture having survived the worst part of the 1980's AIDS crisis, it is uncanny and unsettling too that covid affects the entire world in an altered echo of that same uncertain time. As a collaborative team with Jack Waters , we are known for our experimental cross disciplinary multimedia works that encompass experimental, non narrative, documentary and personal history strategies. We bring a broad based knowledge and technical skills to practices of socio-political and cultural engagement responsive to issues of ethnic, sexual /gender identity, AIDS activism and archival histories using the mediums of photography, film/video, installation and performance to engage and develop ideas that seek to value the process of creation as one of the most highly regarded part of the experience rather than the end result of a final “product”.\n\nCV\n\nEDUCATION\n\nDeerfield Academy 1972-74\n\nSkidmore College - 1975-76\n\nSchool of American Ballet, Merce Cunningham School, Manhattan School Of Dance 1979-85.\n\nEMPLOYMENT\n\nInterdisciplinary Artist/Performer - 1980-2016\n\nCo-Founder/ Director- Le Petit Versailles Garden 1996-2013\n\nPublisher of PLOT Zine - 2006/2007/2019\n\nExecutive Director - Allied Productions Inc.. 1987-2010\n\nCo-Director - ABC NO RIO 1983-90.\n\nTechnical Director - Danspace Project 1989-98\n\nLighting Design- 1970-2021\n\nEXHIBITIONS\n\nIn The Realm Of Anansi from Assisi, 2020 Le Petit Versailles\n\nGenerator: Pestilence Part 1,La MaMa Downstairs Theater, 2020\n\nVarious online web galleries with Visual AIDS 2005-2021.\n\nSecrets of the Great Pyramid: The Pyramid Cocktail Lounge\n\nas Cultural Laboratory.
