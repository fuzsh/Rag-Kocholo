Bakhuashvili himself.\n\n​\n\nSilvia Nogales Barrios and Hernando Nogales have been an artistic duo since 2017, when they coincided as soloists at the Piantón International Music Festival. From that moment on, they decided to combine their brilliant individual careers into a joint project in which they explore unusual combinations of saxophone and guitar, such as tenor saxophone and guitar, or baritone saxophone and guitar.\n\nAttracted by the peculiarity of this formation, they carried out research work, rescuing pieces never before performed for this instrumental combination. Despite their short career as a duo, they have attracted the attention of various composers, who have trusted them for the premiere of their works, some dedicated especially to Nogales & Hernando. They have premiered works and versions at a national and international level by composers such as Sánchez-Verdú, José Galeote, Mateo Soto, Erik Marchelie and Alan Hovhaness.

The idea underlying this novel project is the union between performer and creator, with the aim of promoting experimentation, research and the study of new techniques in the use of the saxophone to expand repertoires in the classical-contemporary field of the 21st century. The composers who have collaborated in the creation of music for this project are of international and national renown, among them Luigi Morleo, Serban Nichifor, Sergio Blardony, Mario Carro, A.L. Guillén, Bartosz Smoragiewicz, Manuel Comesaña, Mateo Soto and Mario Gosálvez (Queen Sofía Composition Prize).\n\nIn addition to the two albums released in February 2017 and September 2018 under the title \"HARIA Project\", works by prominent composers who have been references in the Spanish repertoire and influential in the concert programs of many national and international saxophonists are included. such as Jesús Villa-Rojo, Karen Tanaka, François Rossé, Jacob ter Veldhuis, Eneko Vadillo, Fuminori, Thierry Allà, Fuminori Tanada, Jean-Claude Risset and Christian Lauba.\n\n​\n\nIn 2019, he participated in the unreleased recording of the ballet \"Sueño del Viajero\" by the renowned composer José Nieto, winner of six Goya Awards.\n\nAs a soloist, his phonographic records encompass notable works of contemporary music for his instrument, such as Luciano Berio's Sequenza IXb for alto saxophone, Ryota Ishikawa's Rhapsody on Japanese Folk Songs and Bloomin Ireland, Christian Lauba's Blue Balafon and Clouds, Any Blackbird by Manuel Comesaña, and the historical Mysterious Morning III by Fuminori Tanada. He also has the EP Asahi, which includes his own works dedicated to the victims of the Hiroshima nuclear disaster in 1945.\n\n​\n\nFurthermore, as a result of his humanistic and personal concerns, he has donated more than twenty recordings to Wikimedia Commons of works in the Public Domain by composers such as Debussy, Ravel, Telemann, Albinoni, Albéniz, among others.\n\nIn 2021, he made the first complete recording of the work of French composer and saxophonist Guy Lacour, \"28 Etudes sur les Modes à Transpositions Limitées d'Olivier Messiaen\". Also in 2022, he performed an arrangement for soprano saxophone of the 12 Fantasies for solo flute by Georg Philipp Telemann, reflected in a recorded album. In 2023, he released a new album for solo saxophone and electronics featuring groundbreaking works by Jenni Watson and Alastair Penman titled \"How do you feel?\"\n\n​\n\nDavid Hernando is the creator of the project, \"Tango para un Loco.\" This project is specifically designed for solo saxophone and covers various Argentine musical genres, from tango to folklore with jazz and classical music influences. Hernando Vitores seeks to find a balance between the popular essence and the tango repertoire adapted or written especially for the saxophone. In this new album, his obsession with exploring new sounds and trends when approaching Argentine popular music stands out, connecting tradition with new horizons through the use of three of the four saxophones of the family (soprano, alto, and baritone), along with the beautiful Melody saxophone; a peculiar instrument tuned in C from the 20th century in which Hernando is specialized and immersed in researching it.\n\n​\n\nThe music that is part of this project includes arrangements and compositions written specifically for this format, taken from his solo repertoire, as well as original pieces by authors as relevant as: Astor Piazzolla, Fernando Muslera, Aníbal Troilo, Ángel Villoldo, Vicente Greco, Ariel Ramírez, Virgilio Expósito, Pedro Laurenz, Rafael Rossi, Lucio Demare, Tránsito Cocomarola, Carlos Gardel, Luis Chiurco, Ariel Petrocelli, Benicio Díaz, Julián Díaz, Juan de Dios Filiberto and Bernardo Monk.
