        "text": "Trauma-Responsive, Whole-Person Teaching & Learning\n\nIn August 2020, the Hazen Union School leadership decided that Individual and Collective Health and Wellbeing and Effective Communication would be the two key learning themes and transferable skills every student would focus on during the upcoming school year. Despite our best efforts, we are as far from reaching this goal now as we were when we started. The unprecedented challenges of this past year certainly played an important part, but they also highlighted just how far away we were at the start. Because the system is so stressed, only students who are in danger of failing classes, are truant, or are exhibiting behavior issues raise red flags. The ones who quietly do their work are not on anybody’s radar and are assumed to be doing fine. Yet, when asked, many articulate extremely high levels of anxiety, depression, sense of isolation, and terrifyingly low self-esteem. Every day, caring adults go above and beyond to support our students while emphasizing the need to prioritize health and wellbeing. Yet, all of us – faculty, staff, administrators, and students – are burnt out. It is not a matter of not wanting the best for each other. It is a matter of being stuck in a system that resembles an assembly line factory perpetuating ill-health rather than a place where students and teachers thrive.\n\nIn order to address this issue, I started Dare To Be Me (DTBM) amidst the utter chaos and uncertainty of the COVID pandemic. Its primary goals were to 1) reach students who otherwise might fall through the cracks of the system, 2) foster an “I can” attitude to counter the all too prevalent sense of learned helplessness, 3) practice healthy ways of being that can contribute to a life-long pursuit of holistic wellbeing, 4) provide embodied and in-depth learning experiences by getting outside, breathing fresh air, and engaging our hearts, senses, bodies, and minds.\n\nAs a Rowland Fellow, I will have the crucial time and space to thoroughly evaluate what worked and what did not work during this first year of DTBM and to strengthen its foundational pillars. I hope to synthesize deep connection to the natural world, contemplative and mindfulness practice, identity exploration, and adventure and movement into a program that is thoroughly trauma-responsive. In order to achieve this, I must immerse myself in these modalities, connect with other visionary educators, and learn from schools which offer classes similar to what I am trying to create. Meanwhile, I will remain directly involved with our school by mentoring a colleague who will teach at least one section of DTBM and by piloting a program for teachers and administrators. Hazen Union’s five year plan envisions incorporating Social-Emotional Learning, mindfulness, and trauma-responsive teaching in all classrooms, while the supervisory union’s five year federal Project AWARE grant aims to advance wellness and resilience in education. The fellowship will allow me to collaborate with our school and district leadership as they pursue goals and initiatives that directly align with the mission of DTBM.\n\nUltimately, I believe that DTBM can become a catalyst for the paradigm shift our community desperately needs: a shift towards being versus doing, towards a respectful and caring relationship with the natural world, towards attunement as the foundation for communication, and towards a school culture of holistic wellbeing."
