        "text": "Rome Community Foundation approves $170K in grants to local organizations\n\nThe Rome Community Foundation has awarded $170,130 in grant money to area non-profit and charitable organizations, foundation president David C. Grow announced today.\n\nThe funding, which was approved in Sept. and Dec. 2014 by the foundation's board of directors, is one of the largest allocations made by the foundation since its inception in 1999. Board members meet four times a year to review requests made by community groups for projects that benefit Rome-area residents.\n\nGrants totaling $138,380 were derived from the foundation's Stevens-Kingsley Fund, while $28,600 was approved from the General Endowment Fund. The foundation also released another $3,150 from various donor-advised funds.\n\nGrow said that financial contributions made to the foundation by individuals are routinely placed into a General Endowment Fund for investment purposes, the income from which is earmarked for specific grant requests from local organizations. Each grant is subject to approval by the board of directors.\n\nHe said donors can request that their contributions be given to a specific organization or for a specific purpose, such as educational, cultural, recreational, or health-related.\n\nGrow thanked area residents for making contributions in 2014 to the Rome Community Foundation, saying he hopes individuals will continue to offer financial support when possible. \"There is no question that all donations, whether large or small, make a big difference,\" he added.\n\nHe also praised the foundation's board of directors for their time and dedication in attending meetings, reviewing project applications, and approving grant monies. Noting that directors serve in a volunteer capacity, Grow said they provide an \"invaluable public service with the best interests of the community in mind.\"\n\nThrough its grant program, the Rome Community Foundation is committed to supporting local organizations that offer programs and services to Rome-area residents. Additionally, the foundation ensures that donations made by individuals are professionally managed and administered, and that monies are directed to worthy projects and services in the community.\n\nNew Hockey Jerseys for Kids\n\nThe Rome Youth Hockey Association is purchasing new team jerseys for the more than 200 players who participate in the Rome Grizzlies youth ice hockey program, made possible in part from financial assistance provided by the Rome Community Foundation, as well as from an anonymous donor whose gift was given in honor of the Bartell Family for its longstanding tradition of supporting youth hockey in Rome.\n\nThe Rome Grizzlies program is designed to support the skating and development skills of youth between the ages of four and 18 years who are involved in the sport of ice hockey. The Rome Grizzlies practice and play their home games at the Kennedy Arena in Rome.\n\nThe Rome Community Foundation approved a grant of $12,000 last December for the purchase of the jerseys, while the anonymous donor provided significant additional funding. With the remaining money for this initial purchase that was raised by the hockey association, jerseys for players between four and 12 years of age already have been obtained; next year hockey shirts will be purchased for players between 13 and 18 years of age.\n\nThe mission of the Rome Youth Hockey Association is to provide young people with the opportunity to learn and enjoy the sport of ice hockey, as well as to help players improve their skills through effective practice sessions and competitive games.\n\nRome Colts Pop Warner Football\n\nAs the Rome Colts Pop Warner Football Organization prepares for its 2014 fall season, group president Michael K. East and the Rome Colts Board of Directors are thanking the Rome community for its financial support to purchase a new scoreboard, with a special nod to the Rome Community Foundation and the Bobby Page Foundation.\n\nAccording to East, the Rome Colts last year received a $4,500 grant from the Rome Community Foundation's Stevens-Kingsley Fund, as well as a $1,000 donation from the Bobby Page Foundation, to help cover the $9,000 cost to purchase and install a new scoreboard at the Kevin M. Simons Pop Warner Football Complex on Bell Road.\n\nHe said the Rome Colts staff raised an additional $2,000 for the new scoreboard, while the balance was covered through fundraising activities of the Rome Colts membership. The old scoreboard displayed an illegible score and was beyond repair, he added.\n\n\"We are grateful to the Rome Community Foundation, the Bobby Page Foundation, and all the local residents for their active support in helping to finance this project,\" East noted. \"Without their help, we would not have been able to purchase a modern, efficient scoreboard to serve the needs of players and fans.\"\n\nIn preparation for the Rome Colts fall football season, East said a meeting for parents was held July 21 and equipment was handed out July 22-24 for both football and cheerleading participants. Practice sessions will start Aug. 1, while the season's games begin Aug. 31 during the Labor Day weekend.\n\nEast said this is the second year that the community, through Facebook and the Colts web site, voted on several proposed slogans for the upcoming season's tee shirts. The winning slogan — \"Go hard, or go home!\" — will appear on the back of Colts tee shirts that will be available for sale at the July 21 parent meeting and throughout the 2014 football season.\n\nThe Pop Warner football organization serves between 180 and 200 area youth ranging in age from five to 13. The organization's mission is to teach young participants the ideals of good sportsmanship, loyalty, and honesty, which eventually help them to become responsible adults.\n\nFor further information, visit www.RomeColts.org.\n\nRobert H. Olney\n\nRobert H. Olney, a charter member of The Rome Community Foundation, passed away on Sunday, April 27, 2014 after a short illness. In 1999, he, along with other persons who believe in Rome and its future, committed to the formation of a foundation which would accept donations from the public and offer money grants to charitable organizations in Rome and towns that touch the boundaries of Rome. Over the years, Bob was an active participant in Foundation activities, working with organizations like the Rome Art and Community Center, Rescue Mission of Rome, Salvation Army and many churches in the review of grant requests received by the Foundation. For a number of years he chaired the Publicity Committee of the Foundation so that the citizens of Rome would be able to share in the positive efforts of the many charitable organizations serving Rome that were assisted by the Foundation.\n\nIn addition to Foundation activities, Bob was a director and trustee of the Rome Art and Community Center from its inception, an active participant in the leadership of Zion Episcopal Church, an active skier, golfer, boater and traveler searching out distant parts of the world and sharing those adventures with others. He set the bar high for others to follow his example, giving his time, talents and resources for the betterment of his city, his faith and his family.\n\nThe Directors of The Rome Community Foundation share the loss felt by his family and friends, but know that he gave a full lifetime helping others, with caring and tireless humility and passion for the work God gave him to do.\n\n—David C. Grow, President\n\nThe Rome Community Foundation awards $116,000 in grants to local organzations\n\nMore than $116,000 has been approved for grants to area non-profit and charitable organizations by the Rome Community Foundation, foundation president David C. Grow announced on January 20, 2014.\n\nThe funding, which was approved last month by the foundation's board of directors, is the largest allocation made by the foundation during the 2013 calendar year. Board members meet four times a year to review requests made by community groups for projects that benefit Rome-area residents.\n\nThe $116,365 in grant money allocated in December was derived from the foundation's Stevens-Kingsley Fund and the General Endowment Fund. The foundation also released another $100 from the Fred Normand Fund in accordance with the donor's wishes.\n\nGrow said that financial contributions made to the foundation by individuals are routinely placed into a general endowment fund for investment purposes, the income from which is earmarked for specific grant requests from local organizations. Each grant is subject to approval by the board of directors.\n\nHe said donors can request that their contributions be given to a specific organization or for a specific purpose, such as educational, cultural, recreational, or health-related.\n\nGrow thanked area residents for making contributions in 2013 to the Rome Community Foundation, saying he hopes individuals will continue to offer financial support when possible. \"There is no question that all donations, whether large or small, make a big difference,\" he added.\n\nHe also praised the foundation's 25-member board of directors for their time and dedication in attending meetings, reviewing project applications, and approving grant monies. Noting that directors serve in a volunteer capacity, Grow said they provide an \"invaluable public service with the best interests of the community in mind.\"\n\nThrough its grant program, the Rome Community Foundation is committed to supporting local organizations that offer programs and services to Rome-area residents. Additionally, the foundation ensures that donations made by individuals are professionally managed and administered, and that monies are directed to worthy projects and services in the community.\n\nRome for the Holidays\n\nA $4,600 grant from the Rome Community Foundation to the Rome for the Holidays Committee will help brighten the upcoming holiday season, according to David C. Grow, foundation president.\n\nGrow said the grant money will help the Rome for the Holidays Committee refurbish the holiday lights on 100 decorations — including shooting stars, snowflakes, and wreaths — that will adorn power poles in the downtown Rome area. He said the donation will be earmarked for the cleaning of decorations, as well as for the replacement of existing bulbs with energy-efficient LED lights.\n\nMindy Silipo, chairperson of the Rome for the Holidays Committee, said the grant will enable volunteers to move forward with the refurbishment project in time for the 2013 holiday period. \"We are grateful to the Rome Community Foundation's board of directors for their financial support, which will enhance the aesthetics of Rome's business district,\" she said.\n\nSilipo explained that exposure to the winter elements has led to broken light bulbs, rust, and severe chipping on the decorations. As a result, they have not been on display for the past three holiday seasons, she said.\n\nUnder the auspices of the Rome Clean and Green non-profit organization, the Rome for the Holidays Committee is comprised of volunteers working to raise funds to restore and enhance the holiday street pole decorations that line city streets.\n\nIn addition to the foundation's financial support, other sources of volunteer help include the city of Rome, which is donating labor costs associated with the rehabilitation and installation of holiday lights; the Rome Area Chamber of Commerce; the Underground Café, a group of teenage students who perform community service; and the Kids Oneida Program, a private youth organization that partners with Oneida County to provide volunteer assistance.\n\nRome Mayor Joseph R. Fusco, Jr., noted, \"Local residents will once again be able to enjoy the many festive decorations that will light up the downtown district this holiday season.\"\n\nHe added he is pleased the city is able to underwrite the cost of lighting the decorations, an expense he says will be significantly reduced as a result of switching the outdated bulbs to LED lights. He also praised employees of the city's Department of Parks and Recreation for their \"hard work and efforts\" in maintaining and installing the decorations.\n\nFusco noted that individuals interested in volunteering their time to help refurbish the decorations can contact his office for further details.\n\nThe Rome for the Holidays Committee is seeking approximately $1,500 more in donations in order to successfully refurbish all of the street pole decorations for the 2013 holiday season.\n\nAnyone interested in contributing to the decoration refurbishment project can make a check payable to Rome for the Holidays, c/o Rome Clean and Green, 415 N. Madison St., Rome, NY 13440. If interested in earmarking your donation for the former Trinkaus Manor holiday decorations that are displayed in the city's parks on N. James St., you can note it on your check.\n\nThe Rome Community Foundation provides financial assistance to non-profit organizations and institutions for specific projects that benefit the Rome area. Organizations with capital improvement needs may be eligible for financial support from the Foundation.

Grow announced today.\n\nThe funding, which was approved last month by the foundation's board of directors, represents one of the largest allocations ever made since the foundation was created in 1999. Board members meet four times a year to review requests made by community groups for projects that benefit Rome-area residents.\n\nThe $130,657 in grant money allocated in December was derived from the foundation's Stevens-Kingsley Fund and the General Endowment Fund. The foundation also released another $2,200 from the Elizabeth McKinstry Fund in accordance with the donor's wishes.\n\n\"Modest donations from individuals to the Rome Community Foundation definitely improve our ability to provide financial assistance to as many local organizations as possible,\" Grow noted. \"Although we have endowment and donor-assisted funds from which we allocate grant monies, we also rely on one-time memorial donations, contributions made in honor of family or friends, and individual bequests.\"\n\nDavid Engelbert, vice president of the Rome Community Foundation, explained that financial contributions made to the foundation by individuals are routinely placed into a general endowment fund for investment purposes, the income from which is earmarked for specific grant requests from local organizations. Each grant is subject to approval by the board of directors.\n\nHe said donors can request that their contributions be earmarked for a specific organization or for a specific purpose, such as educational, cultural, recreational, or health-related.\n\n\"The more individual donations we receive from the general public, the better we are able to serve the needs of our area's service and charitable organizations, which in turn benefits the entire community,\" Engelbert noted.\n\nGrow thanked area residents for their donations to the Rome Community Foundation, saying he hopes individuals will continue to offer financial support when possible. \"There is no question that small donations make a big difference,\" he said.\n\nHe also praised the foundation's 25-member board of directors for their time and dedication in attending meetings, reviewing project applications, and approving grant monies. Noting that directors serve in a volunteer capacity, Grow said they provide an \"invaluable public service with the best interests of the community in mind.\"\n\nThrough its grant program, the Rome Community Foundation is committed to supporting local organizations that offer programs and services to Rome-area residents. Additionally, the foundation ensures that donations made by individuals are professionally managed and administered, and that monies are directed to worthy projects and services in the community.\n\nSt. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in Lee Center\n\nThe Rome Community Foundation has made a $4200 grant to St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in Lee Center to construct a new storage building on its property. The church is a host of the Food Bank of Central New York which serves the local area. To provide fresh produce to food bank patrons, the church maintains a large vegetable garden. The new building will store gardening equipment and items necessary for the Food Bank garden. The space will also have room for lawn equipment, a snow blower, storage of seasonal decorations, and space to care for equipment. The building replaces two deteriorating structures that are beyond repair.\n\nVolunteers have built the new 20 foot by 20 foot storage building. Dennis Gardner was the designer. Helping him build the structure were Paul Mullin, Darwin Piersall, Richard Lemieux, Ken Metz, Peter LaMonica, and Ken Puchalski. Maintenance of the church grounds and taking care of the vegetable garden are also done by volunteers.\n\nThe grant was made possible from income generated in the General Fund of the Rome Community Foundation which is the only public foundation exclusively serving the needs of persons in the Rome area.

Box 609, Rome, NY 13442-0609.\n\nMVCC and Rome partners launch Rome Futures Academy\n\nLeaders of the City of Rome, the Rome Community Foundation, Rome City School District, and Mohawk Valley Community College today announced the launch of the new Rome Futures Academy summer program, an initiative to help incoming ninth-graders prepare for success in Rome schools on their way to college readiness.\n\nThe Rome Futures Academy is free for participating students, whose skills may have been sufficient to pass middle school but will not meet the requirements of high school, and will give priority to serving students from low-income families. Participating students will attend a four-week summer camp in the mornings, Mondays -Thursdays, July 16 - Aug. 9, at MVCC's Rome campus. Students can choose from two career tracks, health care or information technology, with a special focus on career development and literacy. The hands-on program features fun projects, activities, and field trips that will help students explore their chosen career track.\n\nIn making the announcement, Grow praised Bartell for his effective community leadership, noting he is a valuable addition to the foundation's board. \"Doug's impressive record of community service demonstrates how committed he is to enhancing the quality of life for our citizens, which is precisely the goal of the Rome Community Foundation.\"\n\n\"The partnerships that support this program will provide students with a meaningful experience that makes learning relevant and fun by showcasing career opportunities here in the Mohawk Valley,\" says Randall J. VanWagoner, Ph.D., president of Mohawk Valley Community College.\n\nThe Rome Futures Academy is designed to help participating students build self-esteem and self-confidence; improve reading, writing, and communications skills; develop problem-solving and critical thinking abilities; enhance their computer learning; find out about jobs and learn more about specific career paths; understand the link between school and future employment; learn more about education, training, employment, and life choices; and work as a team with peers and share responsibilities. Transportation is provided. Students should check with their guidance counselors to see if they are eligible.\n\nThe project builds upon Rome's long-standing connections with MVCC as the college's top dual credit partner and the school district that produces more MVCC Presidential Scholars than any other school district in Oneida County.\n\n\"The MVCC Rome Futures Academy is a shining example of how schools and community colleges can partner to ensure high school students graduate ready for college or careers,\" says Rome City School District Superintendent Jeffrey P. Simons.\n\n\"The Rome Futures Academy is another outstanding program geared toward providing students with some academic help in literacy, goal-setting, and emergent thinking regarding possible future careers in health care and information technology,\" says Richard E. Quest, Ed.D, dean of MVCC's Rome campus. \"Providing students with an opportunity to explore careers that are available, lucrative, and local is the foundation of creating a knowledgeable, contributing citizenry that fits with the mission and vision of Mohawk Valley Community College and its educational and business community partners.\"\n\nThe Academy is an alliance among MVCC, the Rome schools and other partners. It is made possible by a significant grant from the Rome Community Foundation. The investment in Rome-area students is part of MVCC's $7 million Challenge and Opportunity major gifts campaign.\n\n\"The Rome Community Foundation is very pleased to provide financial support for the implementation of MVCC's Rome Futures Academy,\" says David C. Grow, president of the Rome Community Foundation. \"We applaud Mohawk Valley Community College for developing this innovative plan, which not only seeks to address the literacy needs of Rome area youth, but also will help them develop career interests, particularly in the fields of healthcare and information technology.\"\n\nFor more information about the Rome Futures Academy or to register, contact MVCC at 315-792-5300 or visit Rome Futures Academy.\n\nBartell to serve on the board of directors of the Rome Community Foundation\n\nDouglas W. Bartell, vice president of the Oneida Savings Bank, has been elected to serve on the board of directors of the Rome Community Foundation, foundation president David C. Grow today announced.\n\nBartell joins 24 other board members who meet periodically to review requests for financial assistance from charitable and non-profit organizations that seek funding for specific projects to benefit the Rome area.\n\nIn making the announcement, Grow praised Bartell for his effective community leadership, noting he is a valuable addition to the foundation's board. \"Doug's impressive record of community service demonstrates how committed he is to enhancing the quality of life for our citizens, which is precisely the goal of the Rome Community Foundation.\"\n\nBartell currently serves as chairman of the Griffiss Utility Service Corporation, treasurer of the Griffiss Park Landowners Association, and a board member of the Griffiss Local Development Corporation.\n\nAdditionally, he is president of the Jervis Public Library, a trustee of the Herbert T. Dyett Foundation, a board member of the Teugega Country Club, and an active member of the Rome Community Theater and the Lake Delta Yacht Club.\n\nHe previously served as board chairman of the Rome Area Chamber of Commerce and as a vice president of Mohawk Valley EDGE.\n\n\"I look forward to serving on the board of directors of the Rome Community Foundation, which has played such an important role in providing financial help to many of Rome's service organizations since its creation in 1999,\" Bartell said.\n\nAmong the institutions and organizations that have received financial assistance from the Rome Community Foundation are the Rome Art and Community Center, Humane Society of Rome, Capitol Theatre, Hospice and Palliative Care, Inc., Jervis Public Library, Rome Sports Hall of Fame, Rome Cemetery Association, Rome Historical Society, Habitat for Humanity, Rome Baseball Association, United Cerebral Palsy, and Rome Main Street Alliance.\n\nRome Baseball Association Hits Home Run with New Scoreboard\n\nThanks to an $8,000 grant from the Rome Community Foundation, a new scoreboard has been erected on Legacy Field, the Rome Baseball Association's fourth baseball diamond that is expected to be operational later this summer.\n\nJeff DeLutis, chairman of the Rome Baseball Association, said the newly constructed field will enable the non-profit organization to serve more youth in the target age group of 13-18 years old. He said the installation of the scoreboard is part of an overall major construction plan that included land preparation, new field fencing, dugouts, a press box, a warning track, and eventual spectator seating.\n\nThe new diamond is located on a 20.5-acre parcel of land near the Chestnut Street entrance to Griffiss Business and Technology Park.\n\n\"We are very grateful for the continuing support of the Rome Community Foundation, whose financial help enables us to maintain a reputation as one of the top baseball facilities in New York state,\" DeLutis noted.\n\nDeLutis estimates that Legacy Field will be able to add as many as 50 games to the association's roster each year, as well as host significantly more out-of-state teams from such places as New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Canada. He said the new field also will be used for team practice sessions on days when games are not scheduled.\n\nDavid C. Grow, president of the Rome Community Foundation, said the grant from the foundation's Stevens-Kingsley Fund recognizes the baseball association for its dedication and commitment to residents of the Rome area.\n\n\"The Rome Baseball Association provides a very valuable service to our community by offering high-quality baseball facilities that are enjoyed by youth and adult teams alike,\" Grow said.\n\nAnyone interested in checking the 2012 schedule of games of the Rome Baseball Association, or in obtaining more information, can visit its web site at www.delutisfield.org\n\nThe Rome Community Foundation provides financial assistance to non-profit organizations and institutions for specific projects that benefit the Rome community. It also accepts individual donations, memorial contributions, and bequests from a variety of sources.

The $6,591 grant will provide Lucy's House with a new heating and central air unit, which will greatly increase energy efficiency and reduce facility gas and electric costs.\n\n\"We want to express our deep gratitude to the Rome Community Foundation for their support,\" said YWCA Mohawk Valley Executive Director Natalie Brown. \"This funding directly impacts women and children in western Oneida County who are victims of domestic violence. With the Foundation's help, we are providing a safe, stable, comfortable environment for these individuals as they strive to heal and improve their lives. Thank you to the Foundation for continuing to help us change lives.\"\n\nLucy's House is a 6-bed residential dwelling that offers a safe haven to women and children fleeing domestic violence. Residents are allowed to stay for up to 90 days as they seek a safe living alternative and work through related issues. The program is licensed by and adheres to New York State Office of Children and Family Services standards. It is the only domestic violence facility in the Rome area and is one of two operated by the YWCA in Oneida County. Since opening in 2001, Lucy's House has served more than 500 individuals.\n\nIn Oneida County, domestic violence, like all communities, is a serious problem. Locally in 2011, Rome City Police responded to 1,651 domestic incidents, 276 Family Offense Orders of Protection were processed in Rome Family Court, and Oneida County Child Protective Services received 4,437 domestic violence-related child abuse reports, 1,560 of which were in Rome. The YWCA provided 133 individuals with domestic violence residential services and the agency's transitional housing program for homeless victims of domestic violence provided services to 54 individuals. The YWCA's 24-hour hotline answered 1,594 domestic violence-related calls.\n\nIn addition to its domestic violence crisis services in Oneida County, the YWCA also provides sexual violence crisis services in Oneida and Herkimer counties. Those services include a 24-hour confidential hotline, victim advocacy and accompaniment throughout all medical and legal procedures, individual and group counseling, information and support, and referrals to outside services.\n\nIf you or someone you know is in need of assistance, call the YWCA's hotlines: 797-7740 in Oneida County or 866-4120 in Herkimer County.\n\nReach Out and Read\n\nA literacy program that encourages parents to read to their young children and helps prepare toddlers for school is receiving financial assistance from the Rome Community Foundation for the purchase of books.\n\nReach Out and Read, a national non-profit organization that promotes early literacy and school readiness, works with pediatric primary care providers to prescribe books and encourage families to read together. The early-reading effort extends to all 50 states, including areas with moderate- to lower-income households.\n\nLocally, the program is partnered with Rome Pediatric and Adolescent Medical Associates, whose doctors and other medical staff confer with children and their parents at each well-child medical checkup about the importance of reading at an early age.\n\nThe Rome Community Foundation grant will allow doctors from the Rome practice to continue distributing a free age-appropriate book to every child, regardless of family income level, beginning with the six-month checkup and continuing through age five.\n\nLinnea P. Linderman, M.D., a pediatrician with Rome Pediatric and Adolescent Medical Associates, said the Reach Out and Read program builds upon the special relationship between doctors and the parents of young children. She noted that physicians are often the only source of trusted professional advice that parents receive in the first five years of their children's lives — long before they come in contact with the education system.\n\n\"Studies have shown that parents who receive books for their children and literacy counseling from their doctors are more likely to read to their young children on a regular basis,\" Dr. Linderman noted. \"In addition, children served by Reach Out and Read enter kindergarten with a six-month developmental edge, and have larger vocabularies and stronger language skills.\"\n\nRome Pediatric and Adolescent Medical Associates joined the Reach Out and Read program in 2006, serving more than 1,300 children between the ages of six months and five years. Nationwide, Reach Out and Read's volunteer doctors and nurse practitioners will have provided over six million new books to nearly four million children at healthcare locations throughout the country by the end of 2011.\n\nFor further information about Reach Out and Read and its literacy efforts, visit the program's web site at www.reachoutandread.org.\n\nThe Rome Baseball Association\n\nThe Rome Baseball Association has completed installation of a sprinkler system for its Little League baseball field, thanks in large measure to a $5,000 grant from the Rome Community Foundation's Stevens-Kingsley Fund.\n\nJeff DeLutis, chairman of the non-profit baseball association, said the grant money, combined with private donations, enabled the association to complete the project ahead of schedule. He said the new system will make it easier for the association to maintain a healthy grass playing area, and will enable it to water the infield dirt surface prior to and in between games.\n\nThe Little League field — known as \"Freedom Field\" — is one of three baseball diamonds operated by the association. The fields are located on a 20.5-acre parcel of land near the Chestnut St. entrance to Griffiss Business and Technology Park.\n\n\"Ever since the Rome Baseball Association was established in 1997, our mission has been to offer high-quality baseball facilities that can be enjoyed by youth and adult league teams alike,\" DeLutis said. \"Today, we are proud of our three premiere fields that continually serve thousands of players young and old, loyal fans, and the community-at-large.\"\n\n\"We are especially grateful to the Rome Community Foundation and to our individual supporters whose financial help makes possible the new sprinkler system for Freedom Field,\" he added.\n\nAccording to DeLutis, without the sprinkler system, the infield and outfield grass and dirt playing surfaces would become scorched and rough, especially during hot summer days.\n\n\"The new automatic sprinklers at Freedom Field will enhance the quality of the field and make it easier and safer for players to play on,\" he noted.\n\nHe said the Rome Baseball Association oversees hundreds of games each season played by local Little Leagues, high school teams, Babe Ruth teams, and collegiate-level teams. It also has hosted district and regional Little League tournaments, and has been the site of the American Legion county and state district finals.\n\n\"The impressive quality of our fields has earned us a reputation as one of the top baseball facilities in the state,\" DeLutis said. \"I invite community residents to attend our games, cheer the players, and have an enjoyable time participating in one of America's favorite pastimes.\"\n\nAnyone interested in obtaining further information about the Rome Baseball Association can visit its web site at www.delutisfield.org.\n\nThe Rome Cemetery\n\nThe Rome Cemetery — one of the city's historic and cultural treasures — has gotten a bit of financial help from several area organizations to help preserve the sprawling 140-acre site located on Jervis Ave. in the northwest section of Rome.\n\nThe Rome Cemetery Association, which oversees operation of the non-profit cemetery, received sufficient funding to purchase a new one-ton pickup truck that is vital to the upkeep of the property, including grounds maintenance, burial preparation, and snow removal.\n\nThe Rome Community Foundation; the Hazen B. Hinman, Sr., Foundation; the Rome Savings Bank Foundation; and the Sears Family Foundation of Rome, New York, awarded grant monies to enable the cemetery association to replace its 22-year-old truck, long in need of repairs that were too costly to make.\n\nRome Cemetery Association President R. Joseph Jalbert said the funding came at a critical time for the cemetery. \"We are extremely grateful for the generous financial assistance offered by these community groups,\" he noted. \"Their contributions mean we will be better equipped to maintain the grounds of the cemetery and preserve its rich cultural heritage.\"\n\nJalbert said the association recently purchased, and is now using, a new 2011 vehicle from Lee GMC in Boonville. He said Lee GMC allowed the association to buy the truck at cost.\n\nAccording to Rome Cemetery Office Manager Malinda Abraham, local as well as out-of-area visitors regularly stroll through the cemetery to enjoy the beautiful grounds in a quiet setting and to see the variety of monuments that reflect the names of the city's earliest families.\n\n\"Visitors are especially impressed by the Kingsley Memorial Chapel, the Parker F. Scripture Memorial Carillon, and the gravesites of other famous Romans,\" Abraham said.\n\nAmong the noted individuals buried in the non-denominational cemetery are Jesse Williams, founder of the country's first cheese factory; Francis Bellamy, author of the Pledge of Allegiance; Medal of Honor recipients Wilson Smith and Oscar Burkard; and Henrietta Bowen, a former slave born in the state of Maryland who died a free woman in Rome in 1860.\n\nBy the mid-1800s, Rome's first burial ground — located in the area now known as Fort Stanwix Park — was inadequate for the needs of the community. Consequently, the Rome Cemetery Association was established in 1851 to find a new, larger site; two years later the Jervis Ave. location was selected.\n\nAnyone interested in further information about the Rome Cemetery, including details on self-guided tours, can call the cemetery's office at 336-6210.\n\nZion Episcopal Church\n\nThe Rome Community Foundation has made a special grant to Zion Episcopal Church for $5000 to assist the church in making temporary repairs to the Bell Tower. This grant is from the Foundation's Stevens-Kingsley Fund, and is being paid from income generated from investments of the fund's assets.\n\nThere has been concern in recent years that the Bell Tower has been leaning toward the church building. The structural engineering firm of Klepper, Hahn, and Hyatt in Syracuse was hired to conduct a condition assessment of the tower and determine if the lean was a concern. Fortunately, they felt that the lean was not an issue, but did find other major problems. There was water seepage in the Bell Tower, loose stonework, and the mortar between the stones throughout the church building and social hall must be repaired. The cost would be well over a half a million dollars. Money will have to be raised to do some or all of the work that is needed to preserve this architectural and historic treasure.\n\nSince that amount of money was not available, it was recommended that temporary repairs to the Bell Tower be made before the winter. With the Rome Community Foundation grant and some church funds, the Lupini Construction Company of New York Mills, who specialize in masonry restoration, was hired. The temporary repairs involve removing the angled capstones that are unstable and putting a rubber membrane over all angled capstones in addition to the flat area under the bells proper."
