        "text": "Actresses\n\nDiane Hall Keaton (born January 5, 1946) is an American actress and filmmaker. Known for her idiosyncratic personality and dressing style, Keaton has received an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and the AFI Life Achievement Award. She began her career on stage and made her screen debut as an extra in Lovers and Other Strangers (1970), with Richard S. Castellano, Gig Young, Cloris Leachman, Anne Jackson, Bea Arthur, Bonnie Bedelia, Michael Brandon, Harry Guardino, Anne Meara, Bob Dishy, and Marian Hailey.\n\nShe rose to prominence with her first major film role as Kay Adams-Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola‘s The Godfather (1972), with Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Castellano, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, and Richard Conte. She would reprise the role in its sequels The Godfather Part II (1974), and The Godfather Part III (1990), with Sofia Coppola, Andy García, Joe Mantegna, and Eli Wallach.\n\nThe films that most shaped her career were those with director and co-star Woody Allen, beginning with Herbert Ross‘s Play It Again, Sam (1972). Her next two films with Allen, the futurist science fiction comedy Sleeper (1973) and the period piece Love and Death (1975), established her as a comic actor. Her fourth, the romantic comedy Annie Hall (1977), with Tony Roberts and Christopher Walken; won her the Academy Award for Best Actress. To avoid being typecast as her Annie Hall persona, Keaton became an accomplished dramatic performer, starring in Richard Brook‘s Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977), with Tuesday Weld, William Atherton, Richard Kiley, and Richard Gere; and Interiors (1978), with Kristin Griffith, Mary Beth Hurt, Richard Jordan, E.G. Marshall, Geraldine Page, Maureen Stapleton, and Sam Waterston.\n\nShe would receive three more Academy Award nominations for Reds (1981), with Warren Beatty (who also directed), Jack Nicholson, Edward Herrmann, Jerzy Kosiński, Paul Sorvino, Maureen Stapleton, Gene Hackman, Ramon Bieri, Nicolas Coster, and M.
