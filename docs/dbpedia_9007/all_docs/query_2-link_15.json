        "text": "Early Woody Allen mockumentary short I watched to compare to later mockumentary Zelig. Very jokey and political. A few moments made me laugh — e.g. a congressional inquiry about the Boy Scouts to parody the hunt for Communists, and a garbled monologue about “winning war or winning peace.” Many of the references are too timely to resonate today. I did enjoy the early Diane Keaton sighting, though.\n\nIs It Good?\n\nNearly Good (4/8)\n\nNote: This capsule review was originally published elsewhere. If I watch this movie again, I might expand this to a full-length review."
