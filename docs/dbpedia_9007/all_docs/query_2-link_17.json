        "text": "No extras, no stereo, no 5.1 .... but yes, an obvious perfect fit as a \"bonus\" with \"Take The Money and Run\". I assume there is a good back story about why it never aired. I'm going to \"capture\" it from YouTube lest it disappear for another 43 years!\n\nAn AP story about the discovery of a tape of the film in 1997 fills in a few blanks:\n\nhttp://news.google.com/newspapers?n...uZHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=i-wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6163,2247254\n\n\"The movie was scheduled to air in February 1972, as Nixon was preparing for what would be a landslide re-election. But it was pulled before it ever hit the screen... James Day, who was president of WNET at the time 'Wallinger' was made, told The New York Times that the Public Broadcasting System's managers didn't want to air a film that might anger the government.\"\n\nThanks for the link - very interesting stuff. So airing the film on PBS was \"in the hands\" of Woody Allen 17 years ago? I take it that Woody wasn't interested.\n\nI really enjoyed the film, and can happily say I've now seen every film that Woody directed ... and we've got a new one coming in two weeks!\n\nYeah - saw that a couple of days ago. Must have been filmed during Bananas. Nearly same cast - Conrad Bain, Louise Lasser, Guy who runs into court screaming but realizes he's in the wrong courtroom after confession, the Priest hocking cigarettes... lots of familiar faces from that film. Both copywritten 1971.\n\nWonder why it never aired? Woody was popular by then.\n\nAnyway, what a treat to see Woody and Diane Keaton's first pairing! A funny 1/2 hour - terrific. Would make a great bonus on a Bananas DVD but good luck getting Woody to be part of it.\n\nJeff"
