Now Woody Allen steps out from behind the camera and out of character for a new three-and-a-half hour documentary – part of the PBS \"American Masters\" series.\n\nFilmmaker Robert Weide – most recently known for his work on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" – says he was just a little boy when his fascination with Allen began. Weide was granted unlimited access for a year and half to create this two-part feature.\n\n\"Woody Allen was always the big 'get' for me,\" says Weide who himself has been recognized with wins at the Emmy and Golden Globe Awards, and an Oscar nomination.\n\n\"American Masters – Woody Allen: A Documentary\" begins in the beginning. Woody's childhood in Brooklyn, then chronicling his work in television and his prolific filmography, from \"Take the Money and Run,\" \"Bananas,\" \"Sleepers;\" to \"Annie Hall,\" \"Manhattan,\" \"Zelig,\" \"Purple Rose of Cairo;\" this year's commercial and critical hit, \"Midnight in Paris;\" and many in between.\n\nAllen is seen in the editing room, at home and retracing steps from his boyhood. Interviews with actors and collaborators include Diane Keaton, John Cusack, Martin Landau, Chris Rock, Marshall Brickman, Mickey Rose, Doug McGrath, his sister and producer partner, Letty Aronson, and so many more.\n\nThe two-part documentary premieres this Sunday, November 20 from 9-11 p.m. (PT/ET) and Monday, November 21 from 9-10:30 p.m. (PT/ET) on PBS as part of the 25th anniversary of the \"American Masters\" series.\n\nGuest:"
