        "text": "The first time Paul Feig saw a Woody Allen movie, he wasn’t looking for advice or inspiration to help him in a career as a comedy director. Instead, the 9-year-old Feig was simply going along with an older cousin who’d asked if he wanted to attend a double feature—which began with a thriller called W that scared him to death, then shifted gears to Allen’s Take the Money and Run. “It came on and it was like a religious experience,” remembers the director of Bridesmaids (2011), The Heat (2013), and the creator of the cult TV series Freaks and Geeks.\n\nFeig considers the 1969 film Allen’s first as a director (He had made What’s Up, Tiger Lily? in 1966 by redubbing a Japanese spy picture.) A phony documentary about a hapless criminal named Virgil Starkwell, played by Allen, Take the Money and Run launched a directing career for the comic then better known as a standup comedian and playwright. It stunned the young Feig, a comedy buff whose exposure to the genre had consisted mostly of Warner Bros. cartoons and sitcoms like The Brady Bunch and Gilligan’s Island.\n\n“I had never seen comedy like that,” Feig says as he prepares to watch the film in his Burbank office. “It was subversive and smart, and yet so silly at the same time. I wanted to be an actor at that point in my life, and when I realized that Allen wrote and directed and starred in this film, that really kind of set the course for what I thought my life was going to be.”\n\nThe key, he said, was Allen’s balance of realism and absurdity. “As a director, you can put characters into absurd situations and even have them act absurdly without jumping the fence from having a base in human reality,” he says. “You have to create characters that we believe would do whatever extreme or absurd actions the story needs them to do, and you have to give them a specific set of rules they live by. And then you can take them into all sorts of craziness, as long as they are behaving according to those rules.”\n\nThe film starts with the portentous voice of a narrator, establishing the faux documentary format: “On December 1, 1935, Mrs. William Starkwell, the wife of a New Jersey handyman, gives birth to her first and only child.”"
