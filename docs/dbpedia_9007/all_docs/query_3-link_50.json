        "text": "I have a short and somewhat idiosyncratic list of favorite entertainers: among writers it’s P.G. Wodehouse; among musicians it’s Frank Zappa; and among filmmakers it’s Woody Allen.\n\nA common thread among these three — and there are several — is productivity. Wodehouse published something like 100 novels before dying in his mid-90s. Zappa released more than 60 albums prior to his 1993 death at age 52. And Allen has been knocking off a movie a year since the first term of the Nixon administration as writer, director and, often though seldom of late, starring actor. All embody good, old-fashioned hard work, and lots of it. That’s admirable.\n\nAllen’s output comes in for a rare close look this month with the broadcast of an “American Masters” documentary on PBS. It’s a timely tribute, coming as it does on the heels of what has been the durable filmmaker’s most successful movie: this summer’s “Midnight in Paris.”\n\nThat’s “most successful” in terms of ticket sales; “Midnight in Paris” isn’t Allen’s best movie, though it joins “Match Point” and “Vicky Christina Barcelona” as latter-career high points. But it has grossed more than $55 million domestically — a fortune in the world of Woody Allen films (more than “Match Point” and “Vicky Christina Barcelona” combined).\n\nThe figures show what an exception the filmmaker has become. Once so mainstream he was featured in a syndicated daily comic strip (“Inside Woody Allen”), Allen is now primarily an art house auteur, cranking out a movie a year thanks to a strategy that includes staying under budget, meeting deadlines and reaping profits in Europe, where his movies remain consistently popular.\n\nIn the United States, you could add up the total box office of every movie Allen has made going back to 1998 –– 14 of them, generating about $165 million –– and still not have the sales that “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2” totaled on its opening weekend ($169 million).\n\nStill, while the bottom line may not always reflect it, there is a lot of quality in that quantity. A chat site recently asked for favorite Woody Allen movies. Seventeen different titles were offered. That says as much about durability as variety. After the half-dozen “early, funny ones,” Allen — for all his predictable touchstones — became a singularly unpredictable writer/director: dramas, fantasies, period pieces, musicals, faux-documentaries, even a German expressionist film; all have appeared under the words, “Written and directed by Woody Allen” (in the characteristic Windsor font, of course).\n\nHe has used long one-camera takes to rival Hitchcock and hand-held quick-cut techniques; whatever complements the story. He is not afraid to mix magic, flashbacks, dreams or other surreal elements into his films. He has made a half dozen movies in black and white.\n\nFor a filmmaker who has become synonymous with the topics he explores (neuroses, the difficulty of relationships and death), he is remarkably versatile in his storytelling. And successful. He has been nominated 14 times for the Academy Award for best original screenplay and won for “Annie Hall” and “Hannah and Her Sisters.” He also has six best director nominations (he won for “Annie Hall”) and one for best actor (yup, “Annie Hall” again).\n\nHe could at least slow down a bit, what with turning 76 next month and the fact that he augments his movie-making with live performances with his jazz band, occasional pieces in the New Yorker and theater (he’s got a one-act on Broadway now).\n\nSo while the productivity continues, now is as good a time as any for a summing up. After all, Allen’s parents lived to be 96 and 100. He may be at this movie-making thing for a while yet.\n\nMessenger managing editor Kevin Frisch’s column, Funny Thing ..., appears each Sunday in the Daily Messenger in New York.
