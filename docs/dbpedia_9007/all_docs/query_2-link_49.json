He is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent — which is obvious from Konigsberg, but less so from his official stage name.\n\nHe was born in 1935 in New York City, where most of his movies are set. He even named one of his great films Manhattan.\n\nHis childhood wasn't particularly happy, and so he began writing dark-tinged humor — and was already selling the occasional joke by his mid-teens.\n\nAt seventeen, he entered NYU and the City College, but was quickly expelled. He started to write scripts to shows like The Tonight Show, appeared in Candid Camera segments like when he had temp secretaries dictating a love letter, and doing Stand Up Comedy exaggerating his own traits. He's never stopped, though the medium, and eventually the Author Avatar, has varied. Among other traits, his character is nearly always a Sickly Neurotic Geek, and full of Jewish Complaining.\n\nHe started directing movies in 1965. Since then, he has directed 41 movies that range from Screwball Comedy to Drama. He was nominated for an Academy Award twenty-one times, including a record fourteen nominations for Best Screenplay. He has won four Academy Awards — three for Best Screenplay (Annie Hall; Hannah and Her Sisters and Midnight in Paris) and one for Best Director (Annie Hall). His Annie Hall famously beat Star Wars for the Best Picture Oscar. Allen himself is not really interested in awards; he showed up at the Oscars ceremony only once in 2002, when he encouraged producers to continue filming their movies in New York after 9/11.\n\nMost of his comedies have a certain amount of drama, varying with his mood over time. Most of his dramas have a certain amount of comedy, but the comedy is more diluted in them.\n\nThe soundtracks of his movies tend to be jazz music and old (as in 1920s-1930s) standards, no matter when or where the film is set. He did write a musical once, Everyone Says I Love You, but the songs are all lifted directly from that era.\n\nHe's undergone psychoanalysis for 30 YEARS. Exactly what good it's doing, no one knows, but his experience with psychiatrists has made its way into numerous works.\n\nHe's also notorious for being a heavy womanizer. He has been involved with Diane Keaton, Louise Lasser, Harlene Rosen, Stacey Nelka, Mia Farrow — and Soon-Yi Previn, Mia's adopted daughter (and thus Woody's former quasi-step daughter). Naturally, almost every single plotline of his scripts is about sex, adultery and relationships, among other interesting things.\n\nHe also plays the clarinet and has written humorous essays and short stories. (There's one about Count Dracula who finds what looks like a perfect lunch — only to find out he woke up during a solar eclipse. And the apartment is Danish modern with no shades.)\n\nWhile his work in the 70s and 80s are all almost universally loved by fans his films of the 90s and (especially) the 00s are divisive amongst critics and audiences with Match Point, Vicky Cristina Barcelona and (most recently) Midnight in Paris receiving high praise while other pictures- namely Curse of the Jade Scorpion and Hollywood Ending- being not well thought of by most. It should be noted, however, that even the most critically derided films of his filmography still tend to have a few fans here and there.\n\nA somewhat abridged list of movies is presented here:[]\n\nWhat's New Pussycat? (1965) - Woody Allen's first movie (although it was directed by Clive Donner). Peter O'Toole tries to be faithful to his fiancee, but he's a Chick Magnet. Peter Sellers is his psychoanalyst, who is stalking one of his patient's stalkers in a motel in France. Allen plays O'Toole's friend who has a crush on the fiancee. The film originally going to star Warren Beatty, but when Woody was hired to rewrite it, he kept building up a bit part for himself and shrinking Beatty's role so blatantly that the star quit.\n\nWhats Up Tiger Lily? (1966) - A secret agent is sent to Sim Sim Salabim to find a lost egg salad recipe. Gag Dubbed from a Japanese movie.\n\nCasino Royale 1967 - Not written or directed by Woody Allen, but he plays Jimmy Bond, James Bond's \"disappointing\" nephew, who is the head of SMERSH and plans to kill all men over 4' 6\" tall, so that he gets all the girls.\n\nTake the Money and Run (1969) - A Mockumentary focusing on an incompetent, petty thief. Co-written by Woody Allen. His debut as a full-fledged director.\n\nMen of Crisis: The Harvey Wallinger Story (1971) - A short Mockumentary satirizing Richard Nixon's politics. Made for PBS, but they were afraid of losing their government support, so it was never aired.\n\nBananas (1971) - To impress a girl, Woody Allen learns to be a revolutionary in a Banana Republic.

It focuses on the difficult relationship between a comedian and the ditzy Annie Hall. In the end, they split up. Winner of four Academy Awards: Best Picture (for which it beat Star Wars), Best Director (Allen), and Best Screenplay (Allen), Best Actress (Diane Keaton). (Allen was also nominated for Best Actor.)\n\nInteriors (1978) - Three sisters find their lives spinning out of control after their parents' divorce. Woody Allen's first Tear Jerker.\n\nManhattan (1979) - Woody Allen in an intricate Love Dodecahedron with a seventeen-year-old girl, Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep. Probably his second most beloved movie, after Annie Hall. Allen considered the film such an abject disaster that he told the studio he'd make another for free if they didn't release it.\n\nStardust Memories (1980) - While attending a retrospect of his work, a filmmaker (guess who) recalls his life and his loves: the inspirations for his films. Also the one that gave critics and fans the phrases \"the early, funny ones\" and \"the later, serious ones\".\n\nA Midsummer Nights Sex Comedy (1982) - At the dawn of the 20th century, a philosopher, a womanizing doctor and their fiancées spend a weekend in the house of a Mad Scientist and his wife. Everyone ends up sneaking off behind everyone else's backs.\n\nZelig (1983) - A Mockumentary: In The Great Depression, a man named Leonard Zelig involuntarily assumes the traits of the people surrounding him. He uses this ability to blend in with famous historical people and events and bed women.\n\nBroadway Danny Rose (1984) - A talent agent attempts to reconcile a lounge singer with his mistress, Tina Vitale.

Based on his 1966 play, this TV adaptation was directed by Allen, who was dissatisfied with the earlier 1969 film adaptation.\n\nMighty Aphrodite (1995) - An Affectionate Parody of Greek tragedies set in New York.

Set in Rome, it stars Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, Alec Baldwin, Penelope Cruz and Allen himself, in his first acting role since Scoop.\n\nTropes common to his work include:[]\n\nBig Applesauce: One of his trademarks as nearly all Woody Allen films made in the 20th century take place in New York.\n\nAverted lately with every film (other than Whatever Works) since Melinda and Melinda being shot in Europe.\n\nBrooklyn Rage: Averted. He may be from Brooklyn but rage is about the last thing You could imagine him expressing.\n\nBittersweet Ending: A number of his films end this way including Annie Hall and Broadway Danny Rose. The Purple Rose of Cairo is a subversion; the last minute of the movie heavily implies that the main character will have a better life from that moment on... with Fred Astaire.\n\nCerebus Syndrome: Sort of, while he continued to make mostly comedies while dabbling in drama here and there, there was a point in time that fans wanted him to make more films like his \"older, funnier\" films.\n\nCreator Backlash: Allen hates most of his films and finds audiences' attachment to Annie Hall and Manhattan irrational and perplexing.\n\nHe has however said that he does have a fondness for Zelig, Stardust Memories, Match Point and The Purple Rose of Cairo.\n\nAlso famously agreed with the backlash against Curse of the Jade Scorpion.\n\nDarker and Edgier: Crimes And Misdemeanors, Match Point and most of his other dramas tend to embody pretty bleak worldviews.\n\nDeconstructing Harry is an example of one of his comedies that's a bit edgier than his other work being one of the only Allen films were the characters curse with any frequency.\n\nA Date with Rosie Palms: All of his comedies have a masturbation joke. Always pro-masturbation, always delivered by Allen's character.\n\nDeadpan Snarker\n\nDid Not Get the Girl: Annie Hall, Play It Again Sam, Anything Else and Crimes and Misdemeanors all play this trope pretty straight.\n\nDirected by Cast Member\n\nDowner Ending: The Purple Rose of Cairo, Match Point, Crimes and Misdemeanors and Cassandra's Dream.\n\nGame Show Appearance: During the late 1960s Allen appeared on many Game Shows, most notably as a Guest Panielist on many episodes of What's My Line, and trying his best to get a bassett hound to \"sing\" on I've Got a Secret.\n\nHis film All You Wanted To Know About Sex (But Was Afraid To Ask) featured a parody called What's My Perversion?.\n\nGood Adultery, Bad Adultery\n\nThe Gump: Zelig is the former trope namer.\n\nKavorka Man\n\nLemony Narrator\n\nLetterbox: Allen famously insisted on Manhattan being presented this way on television and home video in the '80s, making him one of the first directors to do so.\n\nMoney, Dear Boy: Averted hard. Most of his films have really small budgets and his salary is relatively small. Also averted by big name stars that take pay cuts solely to work with him (allegedly the set fee for famous actors in his movies is five-thousand dollars per day of filming).\n\nNervous Wreck: His standard character.\n\nOld Shame: Granted he dislikes many of his own films but he's particularly ashamed of Curse of the Jade Scorpion having singled it out as one of his worst films.\n\nRecycled in Space: Stardust Memories is Fellini's 8 1/2 but with Allen in place of Fellini and somewhat funnier.\n\nDeconstructing Harry is Wild Strawberries as a comedy.\n\nMatch Point is Crimes And Misdemeanors with all the comedy taken out of it.\n\nScenery Porn: Manhattan and Midnight in Paris both start with montages showing off the cities they take place in.\n\nShout-Out: Woody LOVES the films of Ingmar Bergman.\n\nOnly written by Allen, but Play It Again Sam ends up being one long reference to Casablanca.\n\nSmall Name, Big Ego: Many of his characters.\n\nTom Hanks Syndrome: Leveled at Woody Allen by fans and critics. Lampshaded in Stardust Memories."
