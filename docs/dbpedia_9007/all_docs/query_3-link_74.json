        "text": "I would not swear to it, but it seems likely that the first time I heard Sigmund Freud’s name, when I was around 11, was in a monologue in “Annie Hall,” when Alvy Singer cites Freud’s “Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious” as the source of a joke often attributed to Groucho Marx (a name that was only a bit more familiar). The reference is a meta-joke and a declaration of influences. Marx and Freud! What would the 20th century have been without them? Or without the synthesis articulated by Alvy Singer’s creator, Woody Allen.\n\nThe name-check sets up a later scene in which Alvy and Annie — played, of course, by Mr. Allen and Diane Keaton — are shown, via split screen, in contrasting therapy sessions. Like good Freudians, they call it “analysis,” and Alvy’s is of a notably orthodox variety. While Annie sits in a brightly lit space in an Eames-ish chair, an abstract painting on the wall, Alvy lies on a couch in a somber room with heavy drapes and dark wood paneling. His doctor is stern and silver-haired. They are talking about sex, and about the fact that Alvy is paying for his girlfriend’s treatment.\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that Mr. Allen helped inject certain Freudian notions into the pop-cultural vernacular, and gave a particular cachet to the notoriously tricky concept of neurosis. Or to put it another way: The anxious, self-conscious, perpetually dissatisfied persona Mr. Allen projected in his films of the ’70s presented neurosis not as a mental disorder but as a style. His alter egos were not case studies; they were role models.\n\nIn several of his writings, Freud associates neurosis with ambivalence, a word that, to him, signifies the simultaneous presence of two antithetical, equally strong emotions. Love and hate. Sympathy and hostility. Admiration and revulsion. This is not only a personal or private matter. Societies can be ambivalent, too. In “Totem and Taboo,” Freud describes how in certain tribes a revered elder can also be remembered as an evil demon. Perhaps you see where I am going with this.\n\nThe culture right now is in a state of acute ambivalence about Woody Allen, which is to say that, as in so many other matters, the public conversation is defined by conflict, polarization and the exclusion of the middle ground. Love and hate occupy opposing camps, and reconciliation of their claims seems impossible, at least when those claims involve the allegations that Mr. Allen molested his daughter Dylan Farrow when she was a young child. He adamantly denies the accusations, and his most passionate defenders insist that to doubt it is to be a latter-day McCarthyite, a witch hunter.\n\nBut relitigating the abuse charges is a way of avoiding the real work, which is the endless, not always pleasant task of interpreting Mr. Allen’s work. The movies and what they have meant to so many of us will not just vanish. The ambivalence needs to be acknowledged and analyzed, which is why I’ve spent much of the past few weeks rewatching movies that I used to count among my favorites.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
