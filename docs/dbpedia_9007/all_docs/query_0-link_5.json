        "text": "\"Generally, I try and wait to see what the Russians do first.\"\n\nEnjoyable satiric doodle lays the technical groundwork for Allen's more ambitious Zelig while offering a solid hit-to-miss gag ratio. Feels like Allen's most open attempt at a Mad Magazine-style parody, but then the Jewish sarcasm runs deep in both anyway so it's a nice fit. Mostly I'm just happy to be able to finally see this. The Internet is a magical place sometimes.\n\nVery funny.\n\n“I want you to get an injunction against the Times. Yes, it’s a New York Jewish communist left-wing homosexual newspaper. And that’s just the sports section.”\n\nUnparalleled footage of Tricky Dick and his dicky crew looking an absolute dumbass.\n\n“We decided to bomb Laos because, uh, a very strategic reason. We were not happy with the way it was spelled.”\n\nMore scathing mockumentaries of those who deserve em please.\n\nWoody Allen Ranking\n\nI'm not really sure what to say about this. It's just a 25-minute political satire special that I assume was one of Allen's earliest forays into writing. It's pretty hilarious most of the time, though some of it seems a bit dated now, especially since I know nothing about 70s politics.\n\n\"His mother, the former Anna Cheswick is a former newspaperwoman who has an affair with Mussolini until she discovers he is Italian\"\n\nAllen's first try at a mockumentary is a TV-special that was made for PBS but never aired because it was seen to be too critical of the Nixon administration. There's a lot of great material in here because Nixon is easily the funniest president (not by his own volition). It’s also available on YouTube in full so that’s pretty cool\n\nEm not sure what to say about this. It was fine I guess, but it was a parody of the 60s politics and honestly I don't know that much about that things, so I didn't really laugh with this. There were some really Allen scenes and those were nice. Other than that I was really bored. If it was 10 minutes shorter or maybe 15 it would be much better. I don't know...\n\nVery funny early short by Woody Allen in a proto-Zelig mode where he inserts himself into history as Nixon’s right hand man. It’s so nice to see a parody of the Republican Party from a time when such things were still possible.\n\nWoody Allen"
