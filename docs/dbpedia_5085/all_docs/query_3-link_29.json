        "text": "Trevor Belmont | Feedback\n\nWe're interested in what you think about the new Survivor Trevor Belmont's Perks. Your feedback can be as detailed or brief as you'd like! New Survivor - Trevor Belmont New Perk: Eyes of Belmont When a generator is completed, the aura of the Killer is revealed to you for 1/2/3 seconds. Any time the Killer's aura is shown…\n\nThe Dark Lord | Feedback\n\nWe'd like to hear your thoughts on the new Killer, The Dark Lord, and his Perks. Your feedback can be as detailed or brief as you'd like. New Killer - The Dark Lord Killer Power His dark power allows him to exact revenge on humans, taking many forms to terrorize and slaughter them. The Dark Lord has access to three Forms…\n\nKiller Updates | Feedback\n\nWe'd like to know what you think about the updates for The Dredge, The Nemesis, and The Doctor being tested in this PTB. Your feedback can be as detailed as you'd like, but please make sure to include which Killer you're talking about! Killer Updates The Doctor - Basekit Static Blast's cooldown is now dynamic: If…\n\nPerk Updates | Feedback\n\nWe want to hear your thoughts on the Perks being updated in this PTB. A list of all Perk changes can be found below. Your feedback can be as long and detailed as you'd like, but please be sure to mention which Perk you're referring to when leaving feedback! Survivor Perk Updates Blast Mine Activates after completing a…\n\nIt's High Time Chests Get A Buff\n\nIf you guys are gonna keep adding item and chest perks, why haven't chests been buffed? These past two chapters seem like the perfect opportunity to buff chests, as we have gotta quite a number of chest related perks in the past few months, and the upcoming Castlevania chapter makes that most apparent. Human Greed and…\n\nDont go to live w 70 sec hook stage.\n\nThis change affects more than just camping (that would be fine if this is the only case) but it do make survivors be way more safier with saves. Also w 70 secs for some reason survivors can attempt to escape the hook 4 times, I dont know if its a bug or not Still this change cant go live because it can affect on how well…\n\nCan you guys stop touching maps?\n\nAll this change on Midwitch are just bad honestly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR9iWrkT-Rw\n\nDracula's portrait could use some better lighting.\n\nAside from the obvious stuff such as Dracula's shapeshifting forms needing to be buffed, add-ons needing to either be buffed or just reworked to not be completely useless or just having some of the add-ons (like the Sunglasses add-on) made basekit, there is something else that could use some improvements, which is…\n\nDredge Changes Are Too Powerful\n\nI don't give two craps what Dredge mains have to say, he's too strong - he was already too strong before these buffs, but the buffs make it worse.\n\nCastlevania Perk Changes\n\nHello everyone! While the PTB for Castlevania looks promising, the perks aren't that good. They range from decent to bad or just unhealthy. I decided to try to change that. If you have any ideas or adjustments, let me know. Exultation Stunning the killer with a pallet: • Increases your item's rarity to the next tier •…\n\nPTB Feedback\n\nI have already given my feedback on killers and perks in the respective pinned threads, but I also wanted to share my thoughts on the other changes: Removing prestige from pre game lobby is a good change. It prevents lobby shopping and the people who so desperately need to show off their worthless number can still do so in…\n\nTrevor Belmont perk tweaks\n\nExhultion: Any stun activates it, keep the upgraded rarity endgame if you survive/white ward Eyes of belmont: increase aura reading time from 3 to 5 and additional aura reading from 2 to 4 so perk synergy is actually worth it with alert etc. Moment of glory needs a reduced activation time 30 or 40 seconds is really good,…\n\nGive Nemesis more Zombies\n\nYour Mods said the reason why you couldnt add more Zombies was because Unreal engine 4 couldnt handle more Ai Zombies however we have since upgraded too UE5 and 2v8 is also functionable. There is NO excuse that Nemesis shouldnt have at least 4 Zombies now\n\nWhen Dracula is playing on Coldwind & Ormond maps, should the maps be in night time?\n\nIt feels wrong imo, that the maps are in daylight considering it's Dracula. In \"reality\" his power would pretty much get disabled if it was in daylight. So this is a question about lore accuracy and so on. But also just in general, it feels weird flying around as a bat and running as wolf in daytime.\n\nI love how Dracula is portrayed in DbD, but..\n\nAfter a bit of thinking, could it have been a tiny bit more faithful? I'm not saying he should have a lot of spells like in the games, as they need to make the character work inside of DbD's limits, but i think the absolute best Castlevania's Dracula would have been maybe the Bat form as transformation and giving him more…\n\nNecessary Dracula QOL Idea\n\nDracula's hellfire has been frustratingly inconsistent. When you can correctly gauge when the power is going to hit over an obstacle, its quite strong. But, that of course hinges on correctly gauging the power. Sometimes, very often in fact, you cannot accurately gauge whether the power is going to hit over an obstacle and…\n\nDracula Movespeed Discussion\n\nHey, I've seen a lot of videos and posts detailing a severe unrest with the current state of the wolf form for Dracula. Whereas vampire form has a strong antiloop ability reminiscent of other 'anti-loop' killers that pull a power that strikes over windows, the bat form has a surprisingly valuable teleport that can…\n\n70 second hook stages should not go through\n\nKill rates are fairly stable, I don't know why this change would go through to compensate for the gens taking longer when that was already compensated with every gen blocking/slowing/regressing perk being significantly weaker. Not to mention the extra 10 seconds on hook is not just going to effect camping killers, but…\n\n[The Dark Lord] Give Bat Form the \"footsteps location\" feature Xenomorph has in tunnels\n\nIt seems like a sort of echo-location, it would have been perfect for Bat Form to make use of.\n\n10 Extra Seconds On Hook Needs To Be Reverted\n\nIf we take a look at what was done (purely hook related) No more hook grabs, allowing solo hook saves if the killer is camping Anti Face-Camp so the killer can't just sit in front of you and has to at least proxy instead And now 10 extra seconds on hook per each hook state The issue with this last one is that it is just……\n\nFeature that should of been added to The Dark Lord\n\nDear Behavior, Since bats have really good hearing that is also way beyond humans hearing, I feel like it would be more realistic for the killer \"The Dark Lord\" if the survivors foot steps and breathing was louder while in bat form. Since the bat form is like spirit but the survivors can see the bat, I feel like it would…\n\nHiding Prestiges!!\n\nHi, dear devs the whole point of people asking for prestiges to be hidden is when either killers focus(tunnel) the highest prestige in the lobby, or killers dodging high prestige lobbies. over the years i've made a lot of friends just because when i see somebody with certain high prestige character. example: P94 James or…\n\nConsider Increasing Minimum Chest Count\n\nWith this latest PTB and the Lara Croft PTB before it, I've been thinking increasingly more that the amount of chests in a trial just isn't enough for the kinds of perks that are now interacting with them - on both sides, with Human Greed now being affected positively by more chests in the trial. The survivor role has ways…\n\nWhat is that UI change......\n\nPut it back!!!!! I hate it!\n\nDracula's castle should be visible on Midwich\n\nFirst of all I love the inclusion of the castle on original maps, when playing as or against Dracula. A full map would have been the best option, but this is a very acceptable alternative. Now, the castle does not spawn on any licensed maps and for good reason. But I was wondering, why can't Midwich be an exception? Both…\n\nPlease stop this trend of Killers with weaker versions of other Killer's powers\n\nI know with so many Killers constantly being added it's going to be hard to think of new powers for them all, but this trend with Vecna and now Dracula... it's cool that they have multiple abilities but the trade-off is that they're all so weak and cumbersome that it feels like a hindrance to play them rather than just…\n\nDracula is the most lacklister Killer in recent memory.\n\nFirst of all, this is the translated text. Regarding the newly implemented Dark Lord, I have to say that they've done better. There are no new maps, only a small castle that appears on existing maps, and you can't even see him on indoor maps. As for abilities, they're just a mishmash of existing Killers, so there's nothing…\n\nDracula Blood point categories\n\ndracula for some reason can only Gain Deviousness from Transforming and Teleporting surely this must be a bug? unlike the other killers who actually can use their ability get deviousness points dracula however does not and instead only has scoring category of Brutality over all his forms except his bat form that is super…\n\nMy feelings about the Dredge\n\nHey, i'm a main Dredge, after somes test, For me, the adjustements are correct and fine for the QoL of this killer, but there is still one thing i'm not agree, and it's the CD of its M2. One of the worst malus of the Dredge was its CD, it was 12 sec, and 12 sec was too much. It was one of the reason of why some ppl doesnt…\n\nDance With Me should be 5 seconds and hide pools of blood.\n\nI’m glad they changed the cooldown to 20 seconds, but 3 seconds is quite hard to get value from unless you pair it with Lithe, I feel like the perk can be a lot more useful it the duration is increased to 5 seconds of no scratch marks while also hiding your pools of blood, I think it won’t be too strong since it will still…\n\nMovement speed of the dark lord's wolf form\n\nIt seems slower than 4.6 m/s. Is the wolf form's normal Is the movement speed 4.4 m/s?\n\nWolf Speed\n\nThe power description says you're faster in wolf form but it feels very sluggish. Is that part of the power bugged and if it is can we get confirmation on what your speed in wolf form in supposed to be?\n\nDracula Feels Quite Uninspired\n\nCastlevania is such a cool IP, and so it's a damn shame that we don't get one of the most important part of the games— that being the actual castle— outside of seeing it in the background, and the killer that comes w/ it is just… super derivative. It doesn't feel like the design team really had much vision on how they…\n\nCan we remove the sun from the Coldwind maps while Dracula is in play?\n\nTitle really. I want to say I believe this chapter is beyond a slam dunk, its near perfection as a castlevania license. However, while this is not major in any way, it is an odd oversight that the cold wind maps still have the Sun in view while Dracula is in them. Dracula is well, a vampire its a bit of an oversight imo. I…\n\nCastlevania PTB General Feedback\n\nThis post details everything from Castlevania PTB, including the chapter itself, but all the general changes as well. Castlevania Trevor: Trevor looks good! Lets break down his perks Exaltation: Absolutely an interesting perk and a new take on item perks, as well as rewarding for chase Eyes of Belmont: This one will…\n\nSave the best for DRAC\n\nSo in this Otz video provided its shown that Save the best for last does not lose tokens when using Hellfire and Wolf form attack and pounce\n\nReassurance should be nerfed to 20 seoconds to account for base kit 10 seconds\n\nNow with the base kit 10 extra seconds, I think having reassurance on top of what was just added will in turn be way way to strong.\n\n[The Dark Lord] Feels like Wolf & Bat Form should have had their own Mori's\n\nWolf easily jumping on their neck and ripping into them. For Bats maybe a swarm engulfing the survivor and leaving nothing but bones. (like the Lich mori) Probably too late to consider now I suppose but it felt like there was suppose to be something else for these forms…they feel lacking.\n\nTrevor Belmont is hot af ...\n\n… and probably this is going to be the first ever chapter where im going to only buy the survivor, i dont even know his perks ive only played dracula against bots so far, but that guy is right on top of the handsome list next to jake. With that being said, here the obligatory phrase: \"Shirtless Trevor when?\"\n\nSteamdeck/linux Case\n\nDear BHVR, i play DBD since 2018 on console, and switched to PC on 2019, got myself a steamdeck a year ago, and switch to linux on my main PC half a year ago, DBD was working great both on my PC, and on my deck, but now, with the recent EAC update, only the steamdeck works, you guys can make it to work on linux , why not…\n\n[The Dark Lord] Transforming feels/seems pointless\n\nVampire Form: You move at normal speed and have access to a skillshot that can travel over windows, pallets and small-medium obstacles, a great all around ability. Wolf Form: You can see blood easier and can do pounce attacks that can destroy pallets with terrible recovery speed. It is said that you move faster but to be…\n\nWolf Form and Bat Form roles are reversed\n\nWolf Form: The obvious chaser thats supposed to be fast and agile but in PTB WF is Slow and clunky with scent orbs doing nothing to increase speed with an extremely short duration. Watching a Wolf barely keeping up with a survivor is truly a sad sight Bat Form: The stealth option thats supposed to sneak up on Survivors and…\n\nMidwich Clutter\n\nThere has to be a better solution than what was done here because it just looks cluttered and awful. While the changes are okay I guess balance-wise it just looks like a random asset was put in the middle of the hallways. It would've made more sense to have it be more like the certain hallways where the lockers kind of…\n\nThe dark lord meme addon that makes you permanently a wolf\n\nI dont see what makes this killer anymore unique from other killers that already exist other than wolf form.\n\nHow will Exultation work with Toolboxes?\n\nThe Perk says that anytime you stun the Killer with a pallet, your held Item will upgrade by one Tier. So will a yellow Toolbox become a Mechanic or a Commodius or is it random? Also, will a green Toolbox become an Alex or an Engineers Toolbox?\n\nNemesis buffs are a good first step\n\nAs the title says, these buffs are a good first step in the right direction, but there's still more needing to be addressed such as the zombies. His zombies are still HEAVILY RNG-dependent and are commonly found being useless in areas of the map where there's no survivors nor gens. What I think should probably be done is…\n\nCan we sell our items and offersingdwe don't use instead of the cap\n\nI'm not sure if the cap is as a whole or survivor and killer but we will eventually hit cap not using the brown offerings and add ons so I'm thinking we should be able to sell them for half of what they are worth.\n\nDear devs - rework Dracula please\n\nDisclaimer, I have not played the test server but watched the videos of those that do test. Okay, so Dracula could have been amazing, but these powers seem real lackluster. The bats are kinda cool but its basically Spirit remapped. I have some ideas and so I hope this is read at least - Dracula - What the legend tells us:…\n\n[The Dark Lord] Please dont put those \"Veins\" on his Prestige Weapon\n\nI saw some leaked images on twitter/X and it showed that his Prestige Face has glowing red eyes which is cool but it also showed that his Prestige Weapon is a bloody hand with those weird/ugly veins that wrap around. On someone like The Nemesis it makes sense to have those veins and stuff but on Dracula/The Dark Lord I…\n\nItem add-ons icons too small\n\nWhat's the deal with making every UI element tiny all of a sudden? The player HUD text was just fixed in this exact same update but now the item addons have also shrunk. Why? What is the purpose of this other than to be an accessibility nightmare. New UI Old UI\n\nSome ideas I got for Dracula\n\nSo to start I personally didn't play the ptb but I watched other people play and show off so interesting facts. And from that plus some things I would like to see I have a few ideas to add to the killer and overall make him nicer when fully released. So really I only got one target and that's wolf form. It seems like bat…\n\nDracula is fun, but it needs a tweak\n\nPower Vampire Form: Amazing in the chase and the Hellfire is rewarding at closing down strong loops or lading a hit in unsafe areas, but still balanced enough that a patient survivor can dodge it. Still, I'll buff the range of Hellfire a bit and decrease the penalty of holding the power in chase. Wolf Form: Turning left or…\n\nExultation Discussion\n\nNew Perk: Exultation Stunning the Killer with a pallet upgrades your held item rarity to the next tier, then recharges 25% of the item's maximum charges. Rarity is not kept at the end of the trial.This perk has a 40/35/30-second cooldown. \"Rarity is not kept at the end of the trial\" \"it has a cooldown of 30 secounds\" \"it…"
