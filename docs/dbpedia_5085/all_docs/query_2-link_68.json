WHY.\n\nDuxxy3\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n22,605\n\nUSA\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#9\n\nSome of that is shot for shot of Silent Hill 2.\n\nIf that's the case, then we have an early version of the movie:\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#10\n\nI don't think this looks particularly great or anything, but it sure looks better than that Bloober remake\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nBlackbird\n\nUnshakable Resolve - Prophet of Truth\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n6,068\n\nBrazil\n\nkyle mechlachlan\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n12,747\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#12\n\nI liked the first film, and I didn't expect theyd get the director back for this thing. I'm not like... enthusiastic or optimistic but they're at least doing something. Which is more than I expected from Konami\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#13\n\nIt just me of does that look kind of a grungy Alan Wake wondering the streets of Silent Hill?\n\nYeah the main guy doesn't look like James to me. Having said that, what Gans said in yesterday's piece on the Transmission did sound good, like he obviously likes and appreciates Silent Hill (The first movie is pretty good to be honest), having said that, this is uhh... Maybe not that great\n\nSuede\n\nGotham's Finest\n\nOct 28, 2017\n\n13,128\n\nScotland\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#14\n\nI actually kind of like the first movie. This one is looking rough, can't lie.\n\nNecromorph\n\nOct 30, 2017\n\n2,553\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#15\n\nNot a fan of Christophe Gans, he put so many random ideas on the first film and the rest of his filmography is pretty mid. I hope the movie doesn't look like a fan film like the trailer.\n\nAstral\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n30,002\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#16\n\nThe story alone of SH2 gives a movie like this the potential to be really damn good…if it has the right people working on it.\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#17\n\nWhere is the fog, the smoke and ether, the peeling paint?\n\nPucePikmin\n\nApr 26, 2018\n\n4,095\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#18\n\nI thought the first Silent Hill flick by Gans was quite solid (I think reviewers were just knee-jerk negative about any video game movies back then). If they stick fairly faithfully to the SH2 plot, this might not be bad.\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#19\n\nIt's really strange to me that they'd remake the game and make a film out of it at the same time. People will inevitably compare them and one will eventually be regarded as the worst reimagining of SH2.\n\nAs much as people seem to hate Bloober, I can't imagine this film being better received.\n\nI hate judging it by a trailer that seems to be showing very incomplete post-production, but this is what they decided to release and it just looks rough to my eyes.\n\nJroc\n\nJun 9, 2018\n\n6,491\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#20\n\nThe first Silent Hill movie looked really nice, so I'm willing to give Gans the benefit of the doubt on the visuals front. The teaser looks like it hasn't had much post-production work in certain shots.\n\nStory-wise I'm expecting this to be a weird bastardized version of Silent Hill 2 similar to how the original Silent Hill movie was a weird bastardized version of Silent Hill 1.\n\nAt this point I don't really care if the movie is shit since Revelation 3D already placed the bar in hell. I'm ready to enter the sick twisted world of Jacob Crane.\n\nChackan\n\nOct 31, 2017\n\n5,218\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#21\n\nLike I said on SH2 Remake thread: this looks horrible\n\nLooks to be on the same level of the last Silent Hill 2 movie...the one with John Snow, and that movie was simply put a BAD movie, let alone a bad SH movie.\n\nBishop89\n\nWhat Are Ya' Selling?\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n36,858\n\nMelbourne, Australia\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#22\n\nOutside of some shoddy effects, the original film looked really good at times.\n\nI need to see another trailer for this one lol\n\nAuthenticM\n\nSon Altesse Sérénissime\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n31,940\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#23\n\nis he going for the Al Bundy look\n\nlike what's going on here\n\nBradbatross\n\nMar 17, 2018\n\n15,148\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#24\n\nIs that a fan film? What is that supposed to be? Whatever it is it looks awful.\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#25\n\n18 years since the first Silent Hill film. Crazy. Remember nerding out about everything on the IGN boards during production. Apparently the eternally burning fires under the abandoned town of Centralia was a real life inspiration. I thought the first film was quite solid, re-using the game soundtrack worked wonders, and having the same director return so many years later shows that Konami and many fans are of similar understanding.\n\nKensation\n\nThe Enlightened \"this guy are sick\"\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n7,251\n\nSPRidley\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n8,409\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#27\n\nis he going for the Al Bundy look\n\nlike what's going on here\n\nWhy does this look like a literal PSX game background?\n\nRyougaSaotome\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n4,926\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#28\n\nGiving Gans the benefit of the doubt visually because his films are beautiful to look at, and I'm a HUGE defender of that first SIlent Hill film.\n\nRisitas\n\nMay 13, 2022\n\n1,180\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#29\n\nMaybe Konami forgetting about SH wasn't a bad thing\n\nJigglesBunny\n\nProphet of Truth\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n32,449\n\nChicago\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#31\n\nI can't believe this looks like a better adaptation of Silent Hill 2 than the actual Silent Hill 2 remake. The actors, meh, but the environments, the movement of the creatures, everything is on point there.\n\nYup, still where I'm at with this.\n\nLike I said on SH2 Remake thread: this looks horrible\n\nLooks to be on the same level of the last Silent Hill 2 movie...the one with John Snow, and that movie was simply put a BAD movie, let alone a bad SH movie.\n\nYou're misremembering. Revelations was a bad Silent Hill 3 adaptation, not a bad Silent Hill 2 adaptation.\n\nThis is the first bad Silent Hill 2 adaptation (unless Bloober's remake releases first.)\n\nSpinky\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n5,151\n\nLondon\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#32\n\n...Gans seems to be a genuine fan and I appreciate that I guess.\n\nBut this is wholly unnecessary and is not going to be good. Might look nice, though.\n\nStrafer\n\nThe Flagpole is Wider\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n29,822\n\nSweden\n\nChackan\n\nOct 31, 2017\n\n5,218\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#34\n\nYup, still where I'm at with this.\n\nYou're misremembering. Revelations was a bad Silent Hill 3 adaptation, not a bad Silent Hill 2 adaptation.\n\nThis is the first bad Silent Hill 2 adaptation (unless Bloober's remake releases first.)\n\nYes, but it was Silent Hill The Movie 2 lol\n\ndskzero\n\nOct 30, 2019\n\n3,531\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#36\n\nis he going for the Al Bundy look\n\nlike what's going on here\n\nI... can't see what you mean here lol\n\nAs for the film, it looks like a fan effort, the wig on the girl is super funny, not sure what is going on there.\n\nWil Grieve\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n6,697\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#37\n\nI actually kind of like the first movie. This one is looking rough, can't lie.\n\nI think the first one is fucking great, actually.\n\nYeah, it's different from the games but so what, it's a solid mystery thriller flick minus some dodgy CG.\n\nIt's nice that it's getting a sequel after all this time, since it absolutely has never ever received a sequel before\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#38\n\nShould have been an animated film about cooking with Pyramid Head\n\ndskzero\n\nOct 30, 2019\n\n3,531\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#39\n\nI think the first one is fucking great, actually.\n\nYeah, it's different from the games but so what, it's a solid mystery thriller flick minus some dodgy CG.\n\nIt's nice that it's getting a sequel after all this time, since it absolutely has never ever received a sequel before\n\nThe original Silent Hill is genuinely a nice movie. Not the greatest thing, but it respected the source material while doing their own thing.\n\nKDC720\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n3,562\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#40\n\nSome of the shots looked very flat to me, fan filmish. I do like James looking a bit more grungy and disheveled though, and Maria looking more artificial for lack of a better word.\n\nThat first movie was decent by the standards of early 2000's videogame adaptations but the bar was in the fucking sewer back then. It needs to better than mid.\n\nHoping Gans brought his A game for this, I think he at least understood the franchise better than a lot of other folks who took a crack at it even if he still got some things wrong in that first movie.\n\nIDreamOfHime\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n15,195\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#41\n\nBring back Ned Stark and Jon Snow!\n\nLooks alright, but i feel SH would be better as an anthology Tv show than movie adaptations.\n\nPocky4Th3Win\n\nOct 31, 2017\n\n4,348\n\nMinnesota\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#42\n\nBleh should have stuck to original stories and not trying to adapt the game. Now we got a remake and a movie telling the same story and are going to be constantly compared.\n\nKapten\n\nNov 1, 2017\n\n1,472\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#43\n\nIs that some cult-woman instead of Laura on the wall?\n\nAlso, Wonder what's up with the random bearded dude.\n\ndreamfall\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n6,308\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#44\n\nGod damn - pulled up to Silent Hill in the mustang! Rough as hell!\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#45\n\nStrange, why wasn't this trailer shown during yesterday's Silent Hill Transmission event?\n\nWonder if this could be good since Akira Yamaoka is involved with this movie.\n\nKeym\n\nOct 26, 2017\n\n9,416\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#46\n\nLooks terrible, which is sad after the kinda-ok first movie.\n\nSchrodingerC\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n5,983\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#48\n\nYep that looks like the same vision that spawned the first silent hill movie.\n\nEh.\n\nKinthey\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n23,356\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n#49\n\nThere's certainly something... not cinematic about it. Surprised it's from the same director but I guess the budget is far lower\n\nHad to laugh though considering the confusion about Maria's outfit in the remake while the movie seems to update it without issues"
