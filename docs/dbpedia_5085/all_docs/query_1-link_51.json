        "text": "Parts of Kenilworth Avenue North will be closed for two days this month for a new film that stars Nina Dobrev, Michael Madsen and Crispin Glover.\n\nLucky Day will shoot in the area from Britannia to Barton streets on Oct. 16 and 17.\n\nThe team behind the Silent Hill and Resident Evil franchises — Samuel Hadida and Don Carmody — will produce the movie. Roger Avary is directing.\n\nThe movie follows Red (Luke Bracey of Point Break and Hacksaw Ridge), a safe cracker recently released from prison. Dobrov plays his wife.\n\nGlover plays an \"utterly psychopathic contract killer who is on the hunt to avenge the death of his brother\" who Red killed on a job gone wrong.\n\nFilming on Kenilworth will happen from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. each day. The southbound lanes will reopen from 4 to 6 p.m. for evening rush hour, but the northbound lanes will stay closed.\n\nThe city will post a detour route and police will be on scene.\n\nAs for HSR, the #41 Mohawk bus will detour by turning east on Cannon, then north on Strathearne, then west on Barton to rejoin the northbound Kenilworth lanes.\n\nThe southbound route will turn east on Barton, south on Strathearne, and west on Cannon before rejoining Kenilworth."
