        "text": "Silent Hill: Revelation 3D, the sequel to the series' inceptive 2006 film adaptation, began 'lensing' in Toronto today, and with the film's long-awaited commencement come the first casting details and a production shot. The press release announces Adelaide Clemens (X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Vampire) and Kit Harington (HBO's Game of Thrones) as the film's headliners, and Michael J. Bassett, who most recently called the shots on 2009's Solomon Kane, as its director.\n\nAbove: The firstshot of Adelaide Clemens as Heather Mason, the protagonist of Silent Hill 3\n\nThe film's producers, Samuel Hadida and Don Carmody, most recently produced Resident Evil: Afterlife, and have previously collaborated on Resident Evil: Apocalypse and the original Silent Hill film.\n\n\"Adelaide is breaking out of the indie world with commercial features such as X-Men and the upcoming Mad Max: Fury Road. She and Kit are emerging young talent, and their chemistry and dynamics make them a brilliant addition to the Silent Hill team,\" said Carmody in the statement.\n\nThe press release also offers a brief synopsis of the film:\n\n\"For years, Heather Mason (Clemens) and her father have been on the run, always one step ahead of dangerous forces that she doesnâ€™t fully understand. Now on the eve of her 18th birthday, plagued by terrifying nightmares and the disappearance of her father, Heather discovers she's not who she thinks she is. The revelation leads her deeper into a demonic world that threatens to trap her in Silent Hill forever.\"\n\nDid you like the first Silent Hill movie? Do you like Adelaide Clemens as Heather Mason? She certainly has the look down, no?\n\nMar 7, 2011"
