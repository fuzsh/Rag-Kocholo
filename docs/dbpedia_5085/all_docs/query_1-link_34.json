        "text": "On Monday, principal photography began on Silent Hill, the film adaptation of the popular horror action game franchise from Konami. Directed by Christopher Gans, who helmed the cult-favorite French horror movie Brotherhood of the Wolf, the film is being shot in Toronto, and it stars Australian actress Radha Mitchell (Pitch Black, High Art).\n\nWhile Mitchell's involvement was already known, today Variety revealed the rest of the Silent Hill cast. Most notable among the additions is Sean Bean (Ronin, Fellowship of the Ring). Bean will play the husband of Rose (Mitchell), a woman who begins a distraught search after her daughter mysteriously disappears."
