        "text": "We are deep into spooky season, people! So you might as well get even more in the mood with some delightfully scary movies, right? Luckily for us, we can do that by watching some horror movies filmed in Toronto and the rest of Ontario.\n\nAlthough these flicks may not have been set in the GTA, they’ve used our city and the surrounding areas to make some famously frightening features.\n\nHere are 10 famous horror movies filmed in and around Toronto.\n\nRecent Posts:\n\nDairy Queen Canada just dropped its fall blizzard menu & there are three new treats to try\n\nThis map shows you where to see Ontario’s magical autumn views\n\nCarrie (2013)\n\nAh yes, a remake of a classic. The 2013 remake of Carrie was shot in and around Toronto so if you’re thinking that a building on the street looks similar to the movie you’re probably looking at a filming location. If you want to get up close and personal you can check out Carrie’s house in Mississauga.\n\nWhere: 215 Islington Ave, Etobicoke.\n\nSilent Hill (2006)\n\nThis classic early 2000s horror flick was actually adapted from a video game but still stands to this day as a great way to get in the spooky mood. The movie revolves around an abandoned town (and the spooky stuff in it) and was actually filmed right here in Ontario. Brantford was used in the town of Silent Hill while Sewell’s Road Bridge was used as the police checkpoint.\n\nWhere: Sewell’s Road Bridge – 1107 Sewells Rd, Scarborough.\n\nDawn of the Dead (2004)\n\nWho doesn’t love a good old zombie flick? Dawn of the Dead is a favorite for many folks and was shot around Toronto. The main shooting location was the Thornhill Square Mall which has since been demolished following the release of the film. But hey, we can still pretend that the undead is wandering the city.\n\nWhere: Royal Orchard Blvd, Markham\n\nVideodrome (1983)\n\nHorror, gore, thrill, what doesn’t Videodrome have? This 1980s David Cronenberg classic hits all the spots and also happened to be filmed all around Toronto. That said, it’s quite a hallucinogenic flick, so Toronto doesn’t quite pop off the screen in noticeable ways. Also, you might feel a little hesitant to watch TV after watching this one, folks.\n\nWhere: 125 Bathurst St\n\nSaw Movies\n\nSaw certainly isn’t for everyone as gore is not an easy thing to watch. But folks who love this series probably know that the entirety of it, except for the first movie, were all filmed in Toronto. Hopefully, you can sleep tonight because the idea of Jigsaw inviting you to play a game certainly doesn’t sound pleasant.\n\nWhere: Multiple locations.\n\nCrimson Peak (2015)\n\nThis is one of the few films on this list that isn’t set during modern times. Rather a Crimson peak is set in the late 1800s and early 1900s and revolves around a murderous family and spooky estate. If you’re into period pieces this might just be a good one for you to check out. Plus it was shot in Toronto, using stages and plenty of locations on Queen Street South.\n\nWhere: Queen Street\n\nAmerican Psycho\n\nDefinitely less American than you think, this classic slasher flick was actually filmed in Toronto with only a few scenes being shot in New York. If you watch closely you’ll see shots of the Toronto-Dominion Bank Tower, the Omni King Edward Hotel, and more. So you might as well call this one Canadian Psycho.\n\nWhere: All over the city.\n\nBride of Chucky\n\nWas this the film that made you afraid of dolls? It certainly had a grip on movie watchers in the late 90s and early 2000s. Little did they know that Chucky and his murderous bride were actually running all over Toronto doing what murderous dolls do best. Next time you watch keep your eyes peeled for the West Gas Purifying House and the Distillery District.\n\nResident Evil: Apocalypse (2004)\n\nYet another film franchise loosely based on a video game series. Resident Evil is all about a character surviving a zombie apocalypse. The main city in the flick is known as Racoon City and it was filmed in Toronto. So be sure to look around all those corners next time you’re out and about, you never know where a zombie might be lurking.\n\nWhere: 100 Queen St W\n\nBlack Christmas (1974)\n\nThe horror movie to rule all horror movies… Black Christmas is widely regarded as the first slasher film. It inspired all sorts of films after it like Halloween and Friday the 13th. And it was filmed right here in Toronto with Community Centre 55 used as a police station.\n\nWhere: 97 Main St\n\nLooks like you have plenty of flicks to watch in the coming weeks. We hope that you enjoy these horror movies made in Toronto and be sure to let us know which is your favourite. Happy spooky season folks!"
