Click here\n\nAside from the cost and the gloom and the pain and the nausea, one of the reasons that 3D hasn't taken off as well as anyone expected is because nobody has really put the technology to such good use as Avatar. But, finally, it looks like 3D might have found its saviour. 3D will be saved by a ropey horror sequel to a six-year-old videogame adaptation that nobody really liked in the first place. And Silent Hill Revelation 3D is that ropey sequel. Thank God.\n\nLet's not pretend that you can remember what happened in the first Silent Hill movie, because you either didn't see it or you did your best to expunge the entire thing from your memory as soon as it finished. Let's just sit through the brand new Silent Hill Revelation 3D trailer and marvel at all the amazing ways that the industry-saving stereoscopic technology has been deployed ...\n\nRight away we get to see the value of filming Silent Hill Revelation in digital 3D. Sure, we've all seen hokey scenes where characters sit bolt upright as they awake from a nightmare, but never one with such crystal-clear depth of field that we can almost smell last night's dinner on the character's breath. Bravo, Silent Hill Revelation.\n\nSimilarly, how many times can we say that we've seen Sean Bean's face in three glorious dimensions? Unless we've met him, we can't. Silent Hill Revelation fixes this instantly, and it's all the better for it.\n\nAnd, wow, this is just like being in a real school corridor. Before, extras playing students in rubbishy horror films have only been able to retrospectively cringe at their terrible adolescent haircuts in two dimensions. But when the extras playing students in Silent Hill Revelation look back at their time onscreen here, they'll be able to lament their horrible decision-making skills with precision clarity.\n\nBest of all, though, is this. How many times have we sat through boring 2D movie scenes depicting writing on a perfectly flat wall, and prayed that one day someone would go to the colossal expense of filming some writing on a wall using the latest 3D technology? Too many times, that's how many times. Again, we have Silent Hill Revelation 3D to thank for putting this right. It feels like that completely flat wall, and the writing that's entirely flat against it, are leaping right out of the screen at us. Surely this is the exact legacy that James Cameron intended when he made Avatar.\n\nStill, don't forget that Silent Hill Revelation is a horror movie at heart, so this is where 3D will really come into play. For example, in stupid 2D, this scorpion made of shop dummies would probably look quite silly. But not now. Not now.\n\nAnd 3D allows us to see this scene where Malcolm McDowell is dressed up as a sort of horrific BDSM old lady better than ever before. We can almost feel his professional disappointment, such is the picture quality on show here.\n\nTell me this isn't the most realistic-looking image of a man dressed as a triangle waving a stick at some hands. You can't, can you? Praise be to Silent Hill Revelation!"
