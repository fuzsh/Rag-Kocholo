        "text": "“In my restless dreams, I see that town. Silent Hill.”\n\nThe “Silent Hill” franchise is one of the most iconic series in all of gaming, with its titular town in Maine serving as the nightmarish background of some horrifying and occasionally depressing games.\n\nIt’s impossible to talk about horror games without mentioning “Resident Evil” or “Silent Hill.” However, while both franchises suffered a decline in quality over time, the former has been on a hot streak since its 2017 return to form: “Resident Evil 7: Biohazard.” Meanwhile, “Silent Hill” was seemingly abandoned … until now.\n\nWhile I’m not the biggest fan of the franchise, I have been desperate for a new entry for a long time, especially after the infamous cancellation of “Silent Hills,” a new entry in the franchise that would have been directed by gaming legend Hideo Kojima (“Metal Gear Solid”) and Oscar-winning filmmaker Guillermo del Toro (“The Shape of Water”). Aside from the short 2014 game “P.T.,” we never actually got to play this full game, as Kojima parted ways with Konami after creative disagreements, resulting in the game’s ultimate cancellation.\n\nAlmost a decade after all the dust settled, Konami announced a relaunch of the “Silent Hill” franchise in October 2022, and I have some pretty mixed feelings overall. This relaunch has already gotten off to a bad start, with the interactive series “Silent Hill: Ascension” being torn apart by audiences and the game “Silent Hill: The Short Message” being an overall mess of a game. I laud the latter for trying to tackle themes of bullying, suicide and the problem with social media, as some moments in the story were genuinely effective. But the outdated graphics, repetitive gameplay and terrible writing make the game feel half-baked, as if the developers were more focused on the message than on making an actual video game."
