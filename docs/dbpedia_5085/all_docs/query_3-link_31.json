        "text": "Supermassive’s hit video game Until Dawn is headed to the big screen with a horror movie adaptation from director David F. Sandberg (Lights Out, Annabelle Creation, Shazam), and The Hollywood Reporter brings us the latest casting news this week. For starters, Peter Stormare (Clown, John Wick 2) will be reprising his role from the Until Dawn video game!\n\nTHR notes, “Insiders say that in a callback to the game, Stormare is reprising his role of therapist Dr. Hill.” Additionally, Maia Mitchell and Belmont Cameli have signed on.\n\nElla Rubin (The Idea of You), Michael Cimino (“Never Have I Ever”), Ji-young Yoo (“Expats”) and Odessa A’zion (Hulu’s Hellraiser) will star in the upcoming horror film.\n\nBlair Butler (The Invitation) wrote the original draft, and Gary Dauberman (Salem’s Lot) is now working on the script. The film is said to be “an R-rated love letter to the horror genre.”\n\nUntil Dawn centers around a group of eight teenagers who decide to vacation for a night in a cabin on the fictional Blackwood Mountain, exactly one year after the disappearance of two girls, the twin sisters of a member of their group. Shortly after arriving, the gang find themselves under attack by a psychopath, and must attempt to survive until sunrise.\n\nThroughout the adventure, players alternate between all eight characters, making critical decisions as the story advances which drastically affects the game’s outcome, leading to hundreds of different scenarios.\n\nThe Until Dawn movie is being made by Screen Gems and PlayStation Productions.\n\nProducers include Dauberman, Sandberg and Lotta Losten, as well as Roy Lee of Vertigo Entertainment, and PlayStation Productions’ Asad Qizilbash and Carter Swan.\n\nThe success of Until Dawn led Supermassive Games to create The Dark Pictures Anthology, an anthology series of horror video games with a similar interactive approach.\n\nSupermassive was also behind the slasher video game The Quarry.\n\nThe Alien franchise returns to theaters for the first time in seven years with Alien: Romulus, which is one of six brand new horror movies available in theaters and at home this week.\n\nHere’s all the new horror releasing August 12 – August 18, 2024!\n\nFor daily reminders about new horror releases, be sure to follow @HorrorCalendar.\n\nWhen the dead are back, what do we do with them? The filmmaking group RKSS (Turbo Kid, Summer of ’84) offers a fresh take on the undead in the SCREAMBOX Original horror-comedy We Are Zombies, now streaming on VOD and SCREAMBOX.\n\nIn a city infested with the living-impaired — also known as non-cannibal zombies — three slackers after easy money must fight small-time crooks and an evil megacorporation to save their kidnapped grandma. Watch the official We Are Zombies trailer below.\n\nRKSS — the Canadian filmmaking collective composed of François Simard, Anouk Whissell, and Yoann-Karl Whissell — wrote and directed the horror-comedy, based on the comic book series The Zombies That Ate the World.\n\nAlexandre Nachi (1991), Derek Johns (The Boys), Megan Peta Hill (Riverdale), Vincent Leclerc (The Revenant), Benz Antoine (Death Race), and Carlo Mestroni (Assassin’s Creed II) star.\n\nWe Are Zombies delivered laughs and bloodshed at Fantasia International Film Festival, Sitges Film Festival, and Fantastic Fest, drawing comparisons to such crowd-pleasers as Shaun of the Dead, Zombieland, and Warm Bodies.\n\n“It is finally time we unleash We Are Zombies!” exclaims RKSS. “We are thrilled, as horror fans and genre filmmakers, to be partnering up with the good folks at Bloody Disgusting and their streaming platform SCREAMBOX o bring it to your screens.”\n\nAfter being released in theaters last month, Well Go USA’s werewolf movie The Beast Within starring Kit Harington (“Game of Thrones”) is now available on VOD outlets at home.\n\nIn the werewolf movie, “After a series of strange events leads her to question her family’s isolated life on a fortified compound deep in the English wilds, 10-year-old Willow follows her parents on one of their secret late-night treks to the heart of the ancient forest.\n\n“But upon witnessing her father undergo a terrible transformation, she too becomes ensnared by the dark ancestral secret they’ve tried so desperately to conceal.”\n\nAshleigh Cummings, James Cosmo, Caoilinn Springall, Miriam Arabella Maslin, and Adam Basil also star in The Beast Within, the narrative debut of filmmaker Alexander J. Farrell.\n\nNEON has been having a killer year here in 2024 and they’re back with Mothers’ Instinct, a Hitchcockian thriller that was released on VOD outlets at home on Tuesday, August 13.\n\nThe psychological thriller stars Academy Award winners Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway.\n\nMothers’ Instinct is based on the novel Derrière la Haine by Barbara Abel, and it’s also a remake of director Olivier Masset-Depasse’s same-titled French-language film from 2018.\n\nFrom director Benoît Delhomme, the new film is set in the early ’60s…\n\n“Best friends and neighbors Alice (Chastain) and Celine (Hathaway) live an idyllic traditional lifestyle with manicured lawns, successful husbands, and sons of the same age. But life’s perfect harmony is suddenly shattered after a tragic accident.\n\n“Guilt, suspicion, and paranoia combine to unravel their sisterly bond, and a psychological battle of wills begins as the maternal instinct reveals its darker side.”\n\nWriter Sarah Conradt (50 States of Fright) penned the adaptation.\n\nThe big new release for the week is of course 20th Century Studios’ Alien: Romulus, which is opening exclusively in theaters nationwide beginning Thursday, August 15.\n\nFrom director Fede Alvarez (Evil Dead, Don’t Breathe), the film will be available in IMAX®, Dolby Cinema, 4DX, ScreenX, and formats everywhere. Watch the final trailer below.\n\nIn Romulus, “While scavenging the deep ends of a derelict space station, a group of young space colonizers come face to face with the most terrifying life form in the universe.”\n\nCailee Spaeny (The Craft: Legacy, Pacific Rim Uprising) leads the cast alongside Isabela Merced, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Spike Fearn and Aileen Wu.\n\nFede Alvarez co-wrote the script with Rodo Sayagues (Evil Dead). Ridley Scott is on board as producer for the film, the first movie in the franchise to be released by Disney.\n\nAlien: Romulus is based on characters created by Dan O’Bannon and Ronald Shusett.\n\nDevon Sawa (“Chucky,” Final Destination, Idle Hands) gets feral in the wilderness in Consumed, the latest horror movie by The Butcher Brothers (The Hamiltons, The Violent Kind).\n\nConsumed releases in theaters and On Demand Friday, August 16.\n\nIn the film, “Trapped between a madman (Devon Sawa) seeking revenge and a skin-stealing monster, a married couple must find the strength to fight and make it out of the woods alive.”\n\nCourtney Halverson (Unfriended, St. Agatha) and Mark Famiglietti (Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines) costar as “Jay and Beth, a married couple taking a celebratory camping trip a year after Beth’s cancer remission, who find themselves trapped between a wild madman (Sawa) and a skin stealing monster.”\n\nThe Butcher Brothers, aka director Mitchell Altieri and producer Phil Flores, direct from a script by David Calbert. Jeffrey Allard, one of the producers behind 2003’s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre reboot, produced the upcoming horror movie.\n\nNetflix paid a reported $65 million for the rights to The Deliverance in a hot bidding war, and they’re bringing the film to select theaters on August 16 ahead of the Netflix debut.\n\nLook for The Deliverance on Netflix beginning August 30.\n\nOmar Epps, Demi Singleton, Miss Lawrence and Anthony B. Jenkins star in The Deliverance, which is being described as an “exorcism thriller.” Andra Day, Glenn Close, Mo’Nique, Aunjanue Ellis, Caleb McLaughlin and Tasha Smith also star.\n\nIn the film, “Ebony Jackson, a struggling single mother fighting her personal demons, moves her family into a new home for a fresh start. But when strange occurrences inside the home raise the suspicions of Child Protective Services and threaten to tear the family apart, Ebony soon finds herself locked in a battle for her life and the souls of her children.”\n\nNetflix’s The Deliverance is based on a true story, and in addition to directing Lee Daniels also wrote the script with David Coggeshall, Elijah Bynum and Thomas Westfall."
