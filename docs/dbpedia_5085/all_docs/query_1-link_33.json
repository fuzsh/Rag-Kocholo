        "text": "Today IGN FilmForce brings you Part Two of our coverage from the Silent Hill set in Toronto last summer. In Part One, we discussed the frightening \"Dark Nurse\" scene and interviewed the cast members.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the Silent Hill storyline, the story follows a mother, Rose (Radha Mitchell) as she searches for her lost daughter Sharon (Jonelle Ferland) in the mysterious town of Silent Hill. As Sharon follows what appears to be her daughter, she is drawn into a strange alternate world of foggy darkness filled with a varied assortment of strange beings that have been overtaken by a living darkness that transforms everything it contacts. During her search, Rose is joined by a police officer named Cybil (Laurie Holden). As Rose continues to explore the strange town, she begins to learn just how deep this mystery goes.\n\nIn between takes on the Nurse sequence, IGN FilmForce and other journalists had the chance for a very extensive interview with director Christophe Gans (Brotherhood of the Wolf). Video game faithful will be happy to learn that the director is a big-time gamer and a huge fan of the Silent Hill franchise. Will Gans be the savior to finally get the video game to movie translation right?\n\n\"I played the first one five years ago,\" says Gans. \"So we spent five years talking about this film. What [took] so long was to reach the people at Konami [and convince them] that we'd make something very true to the game. The team of Silent Hill is a team of three or four guys and they are very, very conscious of what they've achieved and they didn't want anybody to screw up their work…\"\n\nCheck out an exclusive image from Silent Hill...\n\nGans says the film draws influence from all three Silent Hill games. \"I'm going to be very precise. It is a [combination] of Silent Hill 1 with some elements from the third one, which is a straight sequel to the first one, and with the look of the second one, which is my favorite. But I think that, it's not like trying to put three games in one film. We did not try to do that. We really tried to adapt the first one, but there were so many great elements in the second and third one, that we didn't resist… Also, because, if for example, you read the strategy guide of the third one, you see that it actually is trying to explain what happened in the first one. And that's a very interesting process, because the first game looked like a very spontaneous creation. But after, we tried to make something with it, tried to create a mythology, and that's what we are trying to do with the film - be absolutely true to that mythology…\"\n\n\"Something that will surprise the people who love the game is that now the story, which is in the background [of the games] is now the foreground… So it's not going to be only somebody walking during one hour and a half… It's impossible. We had to bring that story in the foreground. The story in the film is exactly like the game. Somebody alone in the street, in the town, in the darkness… I hone that to the game, you know, to make this [true] to the gaming experiences. But if not, yeah, we talk about the mythology. The people of Silent Hill start, the original creatures, start to define with the third one. They start to explain what happened.\"\n\nThe four worlds from the game will make their way truthfully to the big screen. \"It's not only an idea in the game, it's an idea of gaming… I think that people enjoy the game because intellectually, it's very refreshing and very challenging… Action and levels and structure and architecture… Silent Hill is one of the most challenging in that realm because you can be in a world and suddenly you're in [another] world. We tried to play with that a lot. Sometimes we have four different versions of the same set… When you try to transcribe the vision of a video game on screen, it's not only trying to transcribe the story or the atmosphere, but also the pleasure to play…\"\n\n\"To me, I have not seen any movie for the moment adapted from the game which actually gives me that feeling…\"\n\n\"Sometimes a movie which is not adapted from a game gives me the feeling of a game. Like, for example, Starship Troopers. [That] gave me the feeling of a game, to be inside a game… But most of the time, the movies adapting the games are just taking the title…\"\n\n\"I'm very respectful. I think it's an art form and I think that I am very ably trying to not only produce Silent Hill the game, but the experience which was my experience in Silent Hill. That's what I'm trying to achieve. It's not easy, but I think that, at the worst the movie will be extremely respectful.\" (Laughs)\n\nFor the dark look of the film, Gans admits to drawing on directors such as David Lynch, David Cronenberg, Michael Mann and others as well as the game itself. \"I was seeing Collateral, the movie by Michael Mann, and I found that there were some amazing moments… [We wanted to] transcribe the darkness on screen and how to achieve the same feeling that we have in the game, where actually a character can be lit by just a Zippo [lighter], nothing else around. So we [did] some tests and we found that it was very interesting to work in night vision because we have a very, very clean element and then after we can work and crash into the darkness as much as we can just to give the feeling that we are exactly in the game…\"\n\n\"For the moment, I can tell you, one part of the film is shot with a crane - simply to produce the isometric point of view… And, I also did that in Brotherhood of the Wolf in some sequences. Here it's extensive… You are going to see a crane movement flying over everything. It was kind of fun to work like that... We even built sets which actually are movable, just to have amazing crane movements which reproduce exactly some of the crane movement that you saw in the game. We went very far on that…\"\n\nThe game itself makes the occasional movie references, but Gans tried to steer clear of overt references in order to keep the film original in its own way. \"Of course, I'm a video game buff and when I played through the game the first time, I saw the reference to Jacob's Ladder, a movie by Adrian Lyne… In Jacob's Ladder, it's basically two sequences - the sequence in the metro in the beginning of the film and the sequence in the hospital, where actually you see the premise of Silent Hill… I think that as a great creation Silent Hill has achieved a completely original world. So basically, I was not afraid to adapt Silent Hill… I don't think that you will find any element from [Jacob's Ladder in this film]… I think that Silent Hill is such a beautiful creation, but it exists by itself and without any obvious reference…\"\n\nThe trick of making a great video game film is to arrive at an end result that is appealing to non-gamers as well. \"That's a great challenge and it's why, when we started to write the film, we are basically three directors - Roger Avery, who is a great screenwriter and also a director, Nicholas Boukhrief, he's a great director in France and also a big video game player, and myself… We were three guys, three directors, three games trying to figure out how to make a movie which can satisfy the game fan, because we belong to them and we don't want to F**k up Silent Hill… And at the same time, how to make a movie that somebody who's not familiar with the game can actually watch. As a great game, Silent Hill has a story inside it. Of course that story is much of the time in the background of the game because you have to play, but if you are careful and if you play again and again through the first one… The second one, especially the third one… Suddenly you realize that there is a huge story behind the game and that's what we try to enstore into the film.\"\n\nIn the scene we watched on set, lead actress Radha Mitchell, who plays Rose, had to navigate through a room of mostly motionless dark nurses in complete blackness. \"That's interesting, to actually create a sequence of suspense with monsters not moving… We are all seeing a lot of movies from Hollywood and we know the [trend] today is to have a lot of movement and fast cuts and everything. I think it's interesting sometimes to just make the opposite. I like this idea that this is a suspense scene among people who are not moving…\"\n\nThe casting of Silent Hill has been met with overwhelming approval from fans and layman alike. Instead of going for obvious big-name choices, Gans and his crew looked for lesser known, talented cast that fit the parts individually. \"It's a matter of feeling. We know that, if you played Silent Hill, each character has a very special quality and they are both twisted and sophisticated. And we tried to keep that in mind when we did the casting on this film… Not trying necessarily for big names, but interesting actors which actually have the raw talent… Like Alice Krige or Deborah Kara Unger… They are not like the usual names, but at the same time you know that they are going to bring something special to the film. The film was entirely financed just on the title. So why resist the temptation to have great casting?\"\n\nThe feel Gans is going for is more of a thriller than an outright gore fest. Although there will be some blood, it will not be a blood-fest per se. \"I think that Silent Hill is not something gory. It's more disturbing… It's constantly disturbing… We tried to keep that disturbing quality…\"\n\nGans focus is instead on creating the tension and overall mood that will lead to scares. \"It's difficult to say now, because I am right in the process. It's difficult for me to say it will be absolutely as scary as the game. I hope it's going to be as scary… I'm doing everything for that. At the same, it difficult because we know that the game is not only great imagery, it's also the sound. The sound is amazing in the game. And the music…\"\n\nFans will be happy to hear that the music of the Silent Hill movie is composed by Akira Yamaoka, who also composed the music for the games. \"It's a masterpiece. It's a beautiful soundtrack… We are editing the film at the same time as we are shooting and I love to use as temp music the original Silent Hill 2 and 3 soundtrack. Immediately, we can see if we've really achieved something close to the game. The music is one of the essences of the game.\"\n\nVery few expenses have been spared in translating Silent Hill to the silver screen. Renowned Production Designer Carol Spier was brought aboard to create the sets from the ground up. \"She's a genius and I love her work... Especially her work with David Cronenberg. I think she's the right person and I was very happy to bring her to this project, because for a production designer, it is like a dream project - we have so many sets to build… Sometimes there is one movement, and you have three locations… We have to do that, because Silent Hill doesn't exist, especially with three or four dimensions…\"\n\n\"In the film, there is 108 locations or set pieces… So basically, it is a movie of 110 minutes I think… Basically, you will have a [around] one set per minute simply because, normally, a horror film is confined to a room or a house, but we have never seen a horror film with a complete town like that. So it was a new challenge in terms of production design especially… [The look is] very close [to the game]. My word on the film was follow the game… We follow very closely… I'm a gamer and I'm a very, very strong fan and I really want to see the game on screen. I would be so sad if it was not the game…\"\n\nIf Brotherhood of the Wolf is any indication, Silent Hill should provide a visual assault on the senses. Gans says that his favorite scene involves a view into Heaven. \"In the film, I have to transcribe Hell and Purgatory. The darkness is Hell and of course the foggy dimension is Purgatory. At one moment, I have to shoot something which looked like Heaven. I think it's my favorite sequence in the film…\""
