        "text": "Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom's protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.\n\nHBO has greenlit the production with filming resuming in Northern Ireland in late June, 2010. India, 1818\n\nSharpe is still in India, taking up where Sharpe's Challenge left off. Sharpe and Harper are on their way to Calcutta, from where they are to sail to England when they are summoned by the British Governor, Viscount Sedgefield. Sharpe is unwittingly tricked into escorting the spirted and willful Marie Angelique Bonnet to meet her betrothed at a company outpost. Along the way they come upon an East India Company baggage train, also making its way to Calcutta. The party - which includes among its number a heavily pregnant woman and a teenage British ensign in charge of a prisoner escort detail - travels warily through enemy territory. Fearing Chitu, the legendary bandit leader who controls the area keeps them on the lookout for a trouble. When a raid happens, the Company officers in charge prove inadequate to its defence and Sharpe has to take over and lead the party 300 miles through enemy territory. He has to train up the ill-assorted group into proper soldiers and finds himself defending helpless villagers against the corrupt and ruthless Colonel Dragomirov, the local Company commander in the area. A dark and tragic epic thriller about the battle for survival. Revenge, jealousy and courage are played out against the harsh beauty of the desolate Arctic tundra. SAIVA, a woman living under a curse, and ANJA, her adopted daughter, live in a remote land far from civilization where she believes they will be safe. Saiva is the sole survivor of an indigenous tribe of reindeer herders slaughtered by a troop of marauding soldiers. After the massacre, Saiva leads the men to their death on a glacier avenging Ivar, the only man she ever loved.\n\nThey struggle to survive, living off the scarce prey they can kill. One day a figure appears on the horizon and collapses. Despite her fears and doubts Saiva takes him in and nurses him back from the brink of death. Loki the fugitive, recovers and settles in with the two women as the snow arrives and the long winter nights close in. Saiva and Anja compete for his attention. As the passion between Loki and Anja deepens, they tell Saiva the heartbreaking news that they intend to leave her to start a new life together. She is devastated. As the sea begins to freeze over, Loki and Anja prepare for the long journey South to Loki's village. Saiva retreats into a tense silence. At the moment the lovers are about to leave, she acts with terrifying and horrific consequences.\n\nFar North filmed in Svalbard during September 2006 and moved to the FilmCampen in Melselv in October 2006. Co-stars are Michelle Yeoh and Michelle Krusiec. Filming continued until November 2006. Sean finished filming his Norwegian scenes during the week of September 25-30, 2006 and was scheduled to rejoin the company when they continued filming in a studio in Twickenham, November 5-19, 2006. Reportedly Sean finished his London scenes on November 14, 2006. Betrayed by their government and let down by the law, a renegade gang set out to right the wrongs of the world in Nick Love's Outlaw. Under the charge of war-veteran Danny Bryant (Sean Bean) and assisted by Lewis (Bob Hoskins), a disheartened cop, this assortment of dejected individuals form a modern-day outlaw posse to avenge the criminal underworld and enforce their own brand of justice. Gaining notoriety in their quest, the group, once disregarded by all, become public icons. It's only when their celebrity exceeds their success that the Outlaw legacy is destroyed.\n\nA provocative, contemporary thriller, Outlaw explores the roots of people's shattered lives and reveals what happens when victims of crime seek revenge by taking the law into their own hands. It's about people that are sick of being treated like they don't exist. Ghosts in the system. Failed by the government and left to defend for themselves by a redundant police force. Stripped of their voice and pushed to the back of the queue. Nick Love based the screenplay on newspaper stories and anecdotes he'd been told from people all over the country. The narrative is fictional, but many of the incidents portrayed are based on fact. Sean filmed Outlaw May 7 - June 14, 2006 in the UK. From filmmaker Michael Bay's Platinum Dunes production company (producers of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Amityville Horror) comes 'The Hitcher,' an update of the 1986 film of the same name. Dave Meyers makes his feature directorial debut on the new thriller, which tracks the terrifying trajectory of Grace Andrews (Sophia Bush) and Jim Halsey (Zachary Knighton), a collegiate couple who are tormented by the mysterious hitchhiker John Ryder, a.k.a. The Hitcher (Sean Bean).\n\nThe young couple hit the road in a 1970 Oldsmobile 442, en route to spring break. But their pleasure trip soon turns into a waking nightmare. The initial encounters with Ryder are increasingly off-putting for Grace and Jim, and they bravely fight back when he ambushes them. But they are truly blindsided when he implicates them in a horrific slaying and continues to shadow them. The open road becomes a suspenseful, action-packed battleground of blood and metal as, in trying to elude not only Ryder but also New Mexico State Police Lieutenant Esteridge's (Neal McDonough) officers, Grace and Jim must fight for their lives and face their fears head-on.\n\nProduction began June 12, 2006 in Austin (TX) and Santa Fe (NM) on July 17, with a filming schedule of 44 days and a scheduled wrap date of August 10, 2006. Sean was in the US filming after June 17, 2006. Sean also took part in three days of reshoots scheduled for the week of November 20, 2006. Two years after Wellington crushes Napoleon at Waterloo, dispatches from India tell of a local Maharaja, Khande Rao, who is threatening British interests there. Wellington sends Sharpe to investigate what turns out to be his most dangerous mission to date. The last scout sent - Sharpe's best friend, Sgt Harper - has gone missing. His latest report suggests that the real power behind the Maharaja is one William Dodd (a malcontent East India Company officer-turned-rogue) and that the Maharaja has gathered into his impregnable fortress Napoleon's French veterans who trouble Wellington the most: their experience, tactics and discipline could help fashion the Indians into something more than \"just a perennial bloody nuisance\".\n\nAs usual, Wellington has not painted the full picture. For once in India, Sharpe discovers the situation is already far graver than he was led to believe; and things only get worse when the daughter of General Burroughs, the commander of His Britannic Majesty's forces in the region, is kidnapped and held in the Maharajah's fort by his villainous henchman, General Dodd (Toby Stephens) and the scheming yet beautiful Madhuvanthi (Padma Lakshmi). The British were planning to storm the Maharajah's fort by blowing up one of the outer walls, but the Maharajah now vows to execute the General's daughter if any such attack is carried out. Worse still, it turns out that General Burroughs has gone down with a fever and that Sharpe's gutless nemesis, General Simmerson, is now in overall charge of the army.\n\nSharpe, now reunited with Harper, devises a plan. The two friends will disguise themselves as deserters and become part of the Maharajah's motley crew. Once inside the fort they will rescue the General's daughter and get word to him of her safety - together with details of which side of the fort they should attack. General Simmerson reluctantly agrees. However once inside the fort things don't quite go as Sharpe has planned...\n\nEpic in scale, this Sharpe was filmed on location in the sumptuous fort and palace locations of Jaipur/Jodphur in Rajasthan India. The locations are replete with all that exotic India has to offer plus stunning, nail-biting fight sequences featuring thousands of extras. Unable to accept the doctor's diagnosis that her daughter should be permanently institutionalized for psychiatric care due to her increasing psychosis and nightmares involving a place called Silent Hill, Rose flees with her child, heading for the abandoned town in search of answers and ignoring the protests of her husband (Sean Bean). On they way there, they are in a car crash that leaves Rose unconscious. Awakening to discover that Sharon is missing, Rose sets out to find her daughter and learns that Silent Hill is inhabited by a horde of eerie creatures and a living darkness that threatens everything that comes into contact with it.\n\nIt's soon clear this place is unlike anywhere she's ever been. It's smothered by fog, inhabited by a variety of strange beings and periodically overcome by a living Darkness that literally transforms everything it touches. As Rose searches for her little girl, she begins to learn the history of the strange town and realizes that her daughter is just a pawn in a larger game.\n\nSilent Hill began filming on Monday 25 April in Brantford, with Sean commuting from the set of North Country, which was in production until the end of April. Federal Prosecutor John Robson lives in Sherman Oaks with his young family. He is driven, brilliant and intuitive. Robson is fiercely certain that there is a link between all the crime factions in L.A., and that there is one overlord whose capture will topple them all. Despite losing support from the FBI, despite the nagging doubt of his assistant prosecutor, Diana Palos, and despite the mounting pressure from his wife to spend more time with their family, Robson won't back down from his conviction and set the wheels in motion, not for the first time, to try to get to the top via one of the middlemen, Lucas Reynosa. Before he can close the deal with Reynosa, however, Robson is brutally beaten, shot in the head, thrown into the river and left for dead - but manages to reach a phone for help and winds up in a hospital, where, after being in a coma for three months and learning that his family has been killed, he emerges, a new man with an old agenda: Eddie Prey\n\nEddie Prey is a hard criminal, an asshole, an animal, determined, through cunning and brutality, to rise through the L.A. crime hierarchy for his own purposes - which happen to be those of John Robson.\n\nSean was in Los Angeles in the second week of March 2006 to film Faceless; he was there until early April. The hour-long pilot comes from 20th Century Fox TV and Flame TV. Flying at 40,000 feet in a cavernous, state-of-the-art 474 aircraft, Kyle Pratt faces every mother's worst nightmare when her six-year-old daughter, Julia, vanishes without a trace mid-flight from Berlin to New York. Already emotionally devastated by the unexpected death of her husband, Kyle desperately struggles to prove her sanity to the disbelieving flight crew and passengers while facing the very real possibility that she may be losing her mind.\n\nAt first sympathetic, Captain Rich is placed in an increasingly difficult situation as Kyle becomes increasingly distraught and her actions place the passengers at risk. While neither Captain Rich nor Air Marshal Gene Carson want to doubt the bereaved widow, all evidence indicates that her daughter was never on board and her irrationality stems from grief and denial over the untimely deaths of her daughter and husband, resulting in paranoia and doubt among the passengers and crew of the plane. Finding herself desperately alone, Kyle can only rely on her own wits to solve the mystery and save her daughter.\n\nShooting began September 20, 2004 in Los Angeles, and included locations in Berlin. Sean completed filming November 26, 2004. When Josey Aimes (Academy Award winner CHARLIZE THERON) returns to her hometown in Northern Minnesota after a failed marriage, she needs a good job. A single mother with two children to support, she turns to the predominant source of employment in the region - the iron mines. The mines provide a livelihood that has sustained a community for generations. The work is hard but the pay is good and friendships that form on the job extend into everyday life, bonding families and neighborhoods with a common thread. It's an industry long dominated by men, in a place unaccustomed to change.\n\nEncouraged by her old friend Glory (Academy Award winner FRANCES McDORMAND), one of the few female miners in town, Josey joins the ranks of those laboring to blast ore from rock in the gaping quarries. She is prepared for the back-breaking and often dangerous work, but coping with the harassment she and the other female miners encounter from their male coworkers proves far more challenging. Times are tough. The last thing the miners want is women competing for scarce jobs - women who, in their estimation, have no business driving trucks and hauling rock anyway. If these newcomers want to work the mines they'll have to do it on the terms set by the veteran workforce and it won't be easy. Take it or leave it. When Josey speaks out against the treatment she and her fellow workers face she is met with resistance - not only from those in power but from a community that doesn't want to hear the truth, her disapproving parents and many of her own colleagues who fear she is only making things worse. In time, even her friendship with Glory will be tested, her already difficult connection with her father, a lifelong miner, will be pushed to its limit and elements of her personal life exposed to scrutiny. The fallout from Josey's battle to make a better future for herself and her children will affect every aspect of her life, including her relationship with her young daughter and her sensitive teenage son, who must first cope with the embarrassment of his mother's sudden notoriety and then face harsh details of her past she was hoping he would never have to know.\n\nThrough these struggles Josey will find the courage to stand up for what she believes in - even if that means standing alone. Inspired by a true story, North Country follows Josey's journey on a road that will take her farther than she ever imagined, ultimately inspiring countless others, and leading to the nation's first-ever class action lawsuit for sexual harassment.\n\nPrincipal photography for exterior work began February 14, 2005 in Northern Minnesota, concluding in Las Vegas, April 29, 2005. In a departure from his British roots, Sean adopts a Minnesota accent for this film. In the futuristic action thriller, Lincoln Six-Echo (McGregor) is a resident of a seemingly utopian but contained facility in the mid-21st century. Like all of the inhabitants of this carefully controlled environment, Lincoln hopes to be chosen to go to the \"The Island\"-reportedly the last uncontaminated spot on the planet. But Lincoln soon discovers that everything about his existence is a lie. He and all of the other inhabitants of the facility are actually human clones whose only purpose is to provide \"spare parts\" for their original human counterparts.\n\nRealizing it is only a matter of time before he is \"harvested,\" Lincoln makes a daring escape with a beautiful fellow resident named Jordan Two-Delta (Johansson). Relentlessly pursued by the forces of the sinister institute that once housed them, Lincoln and Jordan engage in a race for their lives to literally meet their makers.\n\nRounding out the main cast of The Island are Djimon Hounsou as the head of the security team sent to hunt down Lincoln and Jordan; Steve Buscemi as a man who befriends Lincoln despite working for the institute; and Oscar nominee Michael Clarke Duncan as another resident who is unaware of his fate when he is selected to go to \"The Island.\"\n\nProduction started on October 25, 2004 in Los Angeles, with locations in Los Angeles, Nevada, and Detroit. Sean began filming in early January 2005 in Los Angeles and finished in early February 2005. Based on the novel \"Sheep,\" by Simon Maginn, in a last-ditch attempt to pull her family back together, New Yorker ADELLE travels with young daughter SARAH to Wales - to see Sarah's father JAMES and try and patch their lives back together in the surroundings of an old cliff-top farmhouse. But Adelle's worst nightmares are realized when, days into the trip, Sarah is tragically swept out to sea, pulled into the dark depths despite Adelle's desperate attempts to save her. While James leads the search for Sarah's body, a guilt-ridden Adelle is haunted by visions and traces of her daughter - its almost as if Sarah is trapped somewhere in the house itself.\n\nLearning of an ancient local legend of a place called THE DARK - an ethereal land of the dead that is a distorted mirror image of the real world - Adelle becomes convinced that Sarah is trying to communicate to her from THE DARK. When she finds a strange, scared little girl in Sarah's bed, Adelle is sure this girl, EBRILL, is the key to getting her daughter back. For the legend dictates that the dead can be returned from THE DARK if a sacrifice is made - one of the living for one of the dead. And if this girl is who she says she is, she died over 60 years before. Unfortunately, all James can see in his wife is a woman on the very edge of sanity - to him, the girl Ebrill is a runaway, nothing more. However, when local farmer LEWYN recognizes Ebrill from his childhood 60 years before, Adelle knows her suspicions are true. She makes the ultimate leap of faith - throwing herself into the ocean, and into THE DARK itself, to get her daughter back.\n\nRehearsals began June 14, 2004 for one week, with principal photography beginning June 21, for 10 weeks, at London's Ealing Studios, on location in the Isle of Man at Eary Cushlin, Ballahowlin, and White Beach, and in North Devon at Hartland Quay. Principal photography finished on Sunday, August 8, 2004. The film premiered at film festivals in 2005 and went to wide release ih 2006. The brilliant Benjamin Franklin Gates has been a third generation treasure hunter. All his life, Gates has been searching for a treasure no one believed existed: amassed through the ages, moved across continents, to become the greatest treasure the world has ever known. Hidden by America's Founding Fathers, they left clues to the Treasure's location right before everyones' eyes - from the nation's birthplace, to its capitol, to clues buried within the symbols on the dollar bill.\n\nGates' life-long journey leads him to the last place anyone thought to look: a map hidden on the back of the Declaration of Independence. But what he thought was the final clue is only the beginning. Gates realizes in order to protect the world's greatest treasure, he must now do the unthinkable: steal the most revered, best guarded document in American history before it falls into the wrong hands.\n\nIn a race against time, Gates must elude the authorities, stay one step ahead of his ruthless adversary, Ian Howe, decipher the remaining clues and unlock the 2000 year-old mystery behind America's greatest national treasure.\n\nNational Treasure filmed in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Los Angeles, New York, and Utah from 21 September 2003 until February 2004. Washington filming took place Sept 21 - Oct 2, 2003. Philadelphia filming took place October 3 - 17, 2003.\n\nThe production moved to Los Angeles on October 18, 2003 and broke briefly for Christmas roundabout December 20. Filming picked up again in early January 2004. The cast and crew moved to Utah during the last week of January 2004. Filming officially wrapped in mid-February 2004.\n\nSean returned to New York for two days of reshoots in June 2004 (June 3/4 - exterior shots at the Intrepid, and June 5 - exteriors at Trinity Church on Wall St.) Sean also filmed one extra scene the weekend of September 11th in Berkshire, England. Throughout time, men have waged war. Some for power, some for glory, some for honor - and some for love. In ancient Greece, the passion of two of history's most legendary lovers, Paris, Prince of Troy and Helen, Queen of Sparta, ignites a war that will devastate a civilization. When Paris steals Helen away from her husband, King Menelaus, it is an insult that cannot be suffered. Familial pride dictates that an affront to Menelaus is an affront to his brother Agamemnon, powerful King of the Myceneans, who soon unites all the massive tribes of Greece to steal Helen back from Troy in defense of his brother's honor.\n\nIn truth, Agamemnon needs control of Troy to ensure the supremacy of his already vast empire. The walled city, under the leadership of King Priam and defended by mighty Prince Hector, is a citadel that no army has been able to breach. One man alone stands as the key to victory or defeat over Troy - Achilles..\n\nArrogant, rebellious and seemingly invincible, Achilles has no allegiance to anyone or anything, save his own glory. It is his insatiable hunger for eternal renown that leads him to attack the gates of Troy under Agamemnon's banner - but it will be love that ultimately decides his fate. Two worlds will go to war for honor and power. Thousands will fall in pursuit of glory. And for love, a nation will burn to the ground.\n\nBringing the glory of Homer's Iliad to life, Troy charts the bloody path of the Trojan war, which encompasses a 10-year conflict, numerous bloody battles and of course that famously large wooden horse with a surprise inside.\n\nSean plays Odysseus, the son of Laertes and ruler of the island kingdom of Ithaca. He was one of the most prominent Greek leaders in the Trojan War and was the hero of Homer's Odyssey. He was often calledn The Trickster, known for his cleverness and cunning, and for his eloquence as a speaker. He was also the originator of the Trojan horse, the strategem by which the Greeks were finally able to take the city of Troy itself. The two cubs, Suki and Linus, are young lions on the cusp of adulthood who, along with their mother Macheeba, are finding their way in the world. Soon the tranquility of the pride is cruelly disturbed by an attack from a group of lions recently moved in to the land across the river.\n\nPride follows Suki and Linus through adventure after adventure, ultimately uncovering them as two youngsters dealing with hopes, fears, love and pain, and coming to grips with the realities of adult life. Shot on location in South Africa and England, this two-hour A&E Original film utilizes a revolutionary cinematic device known as a boulder-cam to capture the wild beasts from only inches away. Pride combines cutting-edge computer images with actual habituated lions, all to depict the very human traits of real lions in a close community.\n\nPride was shot in lush African savannah in 2003. Sean provided the voice of Dark in three sessions recorded in 2003. The Lord of the Rings collectively re-tells the story of Frodo Baggins, who battles against the Dark Lord, Sauron to save Middle-earth from the grip of evil. In the films, Frodo and The Fellowship embark on a desperate journey to rid the earth of the source of Sauron's greatest strength, the One Ring, a ring of such power that it cannot be destroyed. His extraordinary adventures across the treacherous landscape of Middle-earth reveal how the power of friendship and courage can hold the forces of darkness at bay.\n\nSet in a mythic pre-history, The Lord of the Rings tells the saga of a desperate battle against encroaching evil - a perilous quest to save humanity which falls upon the shoulders of a young hobbit, Frodo Baggins, who has inherited a seemingly innocent magic ring from his elderly cousin Bilbo.\n\nHowever Frodo soon learns that the ring's original maker, the Dark Lord Sauron, is desperately seeking it - for it is a ring of great evil which will enable Sauron to enslave the people of this land known as Middle Earth. A hurriedly assembled fellowship of wizard, elf, dwarf and men accompany Frodo and his friends on a harrowing mission across Middle Earth in an attempt to destroy the ring by casting it into the volcanic fires in the Crack of Doom. Against them rages the monstrous power of Sauron, whose sinister emissaries ruthlessly pursue Frodo and his companions, while the omnipotent power of the ring attempts to corrupt the fellowship from within.\n\nBy shooting all three films consecutively during one massive production and post-production schedule, New Line Cinema made history. Never before had such a monumental undertaking been contemplated or executed. The commitment of time, resources and manpower were unheard of as all three films and more than 1,000 effects shots were being produced concurrently with the same director and core cast. Helmer Peter Jackson, whose visionary style of filmmaking and emotional acuity won accolades for his Heavenly Creatures and The Frighteners, brought his deep love for the source material to the project. Sean spent nearly a year on location in New Zealand playing Boromir for the first film as well as later return trips for extra scenes for the second and third films. A two-part drama starring Ray Winstone as the 16th-century monarch Henry VIII, chronicling his 38-year reign and epic descent from handsome playboy to embittered invalid through a series of unsuccessful marriages, political intrigues, religious upheavals and the failure to produce a male heir.\n\nWhen the Plantagenet claimant to the throne of England, the Duke of Buckingham, leads a revolt against the king, Henry's retribution is so merciless that his own wife, Catherine of Aragon, can barely recognise the man she married. But relations between the royal couple deteriorate further when he sets eyes on the strikingly beautiful Anne Boleyn. Determined to have her as his mistress, he forbids her imminent marriage to Henry Percy, but the ambitious Anne is not about to accept life as a mere courtesan.\n\nMerely a day after Anne Boleyn`s execution, Henry weds Jane Seymour, against a backdrop of violent countrywide rebellion resulting from the torture and slaughter wreaked by Henry`s soldiers during the dissolution of the Catholic monasteries. Henry is forced to face a growing army of dissenters led by his former lieutenant Robert Aske. Worse is to come when Jane dies giving birth to his desperately awaited son and heir, Edward, propelling Henry into deep depression and weight gain. A disastrous, unconsumated marriage to Anne of Cleves follows, but it is not long before the 15-year-old beauty Catherine Howard is hovering in the wings...\n\nSean's role was a cameo appearance as Robert Aske. The role involved several days' filming from March 31-April 4, 2003. John Person is a 30-something struggling actor living alone and facing eviction from his one room apartment in Hollywood. Behind on his rent and heavily in debt, he goes against his better judgment - and that of his pretty neighbor Grace - and accepts an unsolicited offer from his strange neighbor Neely to courier a blue suitcase up to the desert truck stop town of Baker, California.\n\nThere, in the middle of nowhere, at a seedy motel in the shadow of The World's Largest Thermometer, he'll simply deliver the locked suitcase to a trucker called Cowboy and be paid twenty-seven thousand dollars in cold, hard cash. Seems like easy money. But then John is given a loaded gun and told he must defend the blue suitcase with his life.\n\nOn arrival in Baker, John discovers he's already missed the mysterious Cowboy. Soon he's reluctantly mixed up with young local vixen Ruthie, her mother Stella, Ruthie's hotheaded, jealous boyfriend Randy and paranoid, alien-obsessed locals. When Special Agent Banks arrives to question him about the murder and decapitation of Neely and hundreds of people recently gone missing, John realizes that he might be mixed up in something much more dangerous and bizarre than he ever imagined. Later that dark night, Cowboy makes a violent return to Baker and John finds himself caught somewhere between the surreal, the supernatural and the just plain weird. As the final showdown begins, John is faced with a choice that could change his life forever. Has this whole town gone mad? Or are the loony locals, who John dismissed as crazy, the only sane things about this strange parallel universe called The Big Empty?\n\nThe Big Empty was filmed on location in Baker, California in January and February 2002. Sean, who plays Cowboy, filmed his scenes between 25 January and mid-February 2002. Tom and Thomas are twins who were abandoned soon after they were born. Before the infants were discovered by authorities, one of them was stolen by a mentally-impaired woman. The child was later rescued from the woman and sent to a foundling home. The other infant was adopted by professional artist Paul Sheppard and his wife. Paul's wife died, leaving him to raise Thomas alone. So...they don't know each other. Or do they? It so happens that Tom has an imaginary friend - Thomas - with whom he talks and plays in his imagination. Thomas has an imaginary friend as well. He has called him Tom.\n\nTo celebrate his ninth birthday, Thomas visits the impressive mirror maze in the Science Museum. Meanwhile, Tom has taken refuge inside the museum. There, the boys come face to face with each other for the first time. They want to stay together forever...but there is one complication: Tom is being hunted as a runaway. Tom discovered that the children's home where he was staying was being used by child traders when he witnessed the illegal activities. He goes into hiding at Thomas's flat, just after Thomas has solemnly promised his adoptive father never to mention this imaginary friend again. Tom takes Thomas's place at school - and at home - on a regular basis. This causes confusion, because Thomas is a well-mannered, careful, polite boy...whereas Tom is not afraid of anyone - or anything - and has never been taught to watch his tongue. But then, the child traders mistake Thomas for Tom - A thrilling denouement follows...and only then does everyone realize that Tom and Thomas are not imaginary friends at all...but real twins.\n\nPrincipal photography was from December 2000 until 20 July 2001 at locations in and around Amsterdam and London. Preeminent New York psychiatrist Dr. Nathan Conrad has a successful Upper West Side practice, a beautiful wife and a charming daughter. Making his way home to begin a tranquil Thanksgiving holiday, Conrad is summoned by a colleague to examine a young woman. Elisabeth Burrows presents a history of unexplained violence and a miasma of failed treatments and misdiagnoses. In short, Elisabeth is the kind of case Nathan used to live for before he went \"uptown.\" Now, he is Elisabeth's last chance before she is shipped off to a purgatory of state institutionalization.\n\nNathan's skills and intuition make headway into Elisabeth's case, and his curiosity is further aroused by her mysterious first words to him: \"You want what they want, don't you? I'll never tell any of you.\" Little does Nathan suspect that Elisabeth and her cryptic message are tied to a danger that has closed in on him and his family. Nathan's daughter has been kidnapped by ruthless thieves, and to save her, he somehow must unlock a six-digit number locked away in Elisabeth's troubled mind. There is no discussion, no negotiation. With his daughter's captors watching his every move, Nathan is trapped in a nightmare even he could never have envisioned. And as Nathan is reminded constantly by his tormentors: if he wants to see his daughter alive, he dare not say a single word.\n\nPrincipal photography began in New York on 08 December 2000 and continued until December 20th. Further filming took place in Toronto and New York from 05 January until 31 March 2001. A new generation of East End villains have moved up and out of the inner cities - bringing with them a new breed of crime and a much harder, more ruthless attitude into the heart of Essex. Inspired by a real-life incident, Essex Boys is a dark and violent look at British gangsters, a work of fiction looking at all aspects of organised crime - not just drugs.\n\nThe story is told by a naive small-time crook who is employed by a vicious gangster and becomes blinded by the glamour of organised crime while he is seduced into a dangerous underworld. Lured into the glamorous world of clubs, bars and protection rackets, what at first seems glamorous and exciting soon reveals itself as frightening and heartless - but by then it's too late and Billy Reynolds is in too deep. As he becomes sickened by the violence and seedy underworld, his efforts to get out of the whole scene lead down an unexpected road, engineered by the smartest gangster of them all: Lisa, the wife of \"geezer\" Jason Locke.\n\nFilming of Essex Boys began February 28, 1999 and finished on April 26, 1999. A number of local areas in Essex were incorporated into the shooting schedule, including Brightlingsea, Canvey Island, Epping Forest, the Lakeside Shopping Centre in Brentwood and the Bar Central in Southend. Convicted of the shocking and gruesome slaughter of his wife and young daughter, Neil Byrne jumps off a speeding train and escapes into the night, leaving behind only his guards and a paperback novel, Patagonia, whose margins are full of inscrutable shorthand markings.\n\nAs Byrne is forced undercover, taking on former acquaintances of a ruthless organised crime syndicate and evading capture by their mobs, the police and sinister government agencies, we begin to learn more details of his crime, and the significance of the missing paperback. Protested innocence seems an irrelevance as unseen masters use Byrne and his pursuers as expendable pawns in a chilling battle to protect deeper, darker secrets....\n\nThis fugitive tale, which follows a haunted man through his past and present, is about the love of family, the thrills of a forbidden affair and the violence and intrigue of a world beyond the law.\n\nThe action takes place in Manchester and London where our hero has to take on the forces of Organised Crime and of the corrupt Secret Security Service and must avoid capture by the Police before he can discover those guilty of murder and theft and so prove his innocence.\n\nFilming began on June 14, 1999 for 8 weeks in London and Manchester. This is the true story of the most highly decorated British patrol since the Boer war: an eight man SAS team inserted behind Iraqi lines during the Gulf War in January 1991. Their mission was to take out the scud missiles which Saddam Hussein was using to terrorize his enemies, as well as to sever strategic communication lines between Baghdad and North West Iraq. This top secret mission was called \"Bravo Two Zero\".\n\nOf the eight who went out, only five returned. Dropped into \"scud alley\" carrying 210-pound packs, McNab and his men soon found themselves surrounded by Saddam's army. Their radios didn't work; the weather was brutally cold. And they had been spotted. The story of Bravo Two Zero includes the no-holds-barred detail of McNab's capture by the Iraqis, and the harrowing torture they inflicted on him.\n\nPrincipal photography on the $6.5 million project began August 12, 1997 in South Africa's Northern Cape province. Filming continued on location for four weeks in and around the desert near the small town of Uppington, for three weeks in the country's commercial capital of Johannesburg; and for a week in London's Twickenham Studios in early October. The Nun's Priest tells the story of a rooster, hen and fox - Chaunticleer, Lady Pertelote, and Daun Russel, respectively. Chaunticleer and Pertelote discuss whether or not the rooster should fear his dreams. Chaunticleer recounts a dream he had involving a beast that looked and acted like a fox. Pertelote tells him that dreams have no meaning, and that he should take a laxative.\n\nChaunticleer presses on, telling several stories that seem to affect Pertelote. Thinking that perhaps he was too harsh, Chaunticleer compliments Pertelote on her appearance, telling her, \"Woman is man's sole joy and bliss.\"\n\nThe Nun's Priest then moves to Daun Russel, the fox. Following a butterfly, Chaunticleer notices the fox. Before the rooster has a chance to run, the fox begins to flatter Chaunticleer, telling him that he only wants to hear him sing. Displaying vanity at its strongest, the rooster breaks into song, at which time Daun Russel grabs Chaunticleer by the neck and begins to run. With the entire farm - people and animals, alike - chasing after them, the rooster suggests to the fox that he turn around and laugh at those in pursuit. Once the fox turns around and opens his mouth, Chaunticleer scrambles up a tree to safety. Though Daun Russel tries again to appeal to Chaunticleer's vanity, it doesn't work the second time around.\n\nProduced in Cardiff, London & Moscow by Christmas Films, Beryl Productions aka Pizazz & Right Angle for S4C in association with NNC Wales and Home Box Office. Ronin, Japanese for \"masterless samurai\", deals with a group of former intelligence agents who have lost their way in the post-Cold War environment. They're hired by an unknown person to perform a job as a private contractor of sorts, only to realize that at the end of the operation they are to be killed because they know too much. Ronin is really a character piece that revolves around the history of each member of the team, examining their morality (or lack thereof) and how they reconcile what they did for the American, British and French governments, especially in the face of their current situation.\n\nIt all begins with a meeting in a warehouse in Paris, arranged by Deidre, an ex-Irish terrorist who has recruited five hired men to locate a mysterious briefcase. \"It's something I want that others are holding on to,\" she says. Each member of the team has a speciality: Spence, the arms expert; Larry, the driver; Gregor, the electronics ace; the enigmatic Sam, and all of them are framed around Vincent, ex-agent of French Information.\n\nThere are epic chases on the high ground around Nice, bloody gun fights at the arena at Arles, and traps along the banks of the Seine in this game of cat and mouse. A number of scenes were also filmed in the studios at Epinay.\n\nRonin was filmed during four month shoot beginning in November 1997 in France. A covert-operations team is kept up the government's sleeve to infiltrate high-risk situations whenever needed. They are recruited to steal a deadly virus from a band of terrorists. Led by Commander Bill McNeil, the team confronts the thieves in a daring act of air piracy, rappelling down a cable fired at and magnetically attached to the terrorists' jet from their stealth plane. After an intense mid-air standoff the team retrieves the bottled disease. But when two members of the group turn up murdered, McNeil starts to think that their own government is knocking them off to keep the virus a secret.\n\nOverwhelmed with suspicion, he and the remaining team steal the virus back and become the desperate quarry of a group of mysterious mercenaries who might be more familiar to them than they suspect. An intense cat and mouse game envelops the two remaining agents who now don't know who to trust or what to believe.\n\nThis third feature film from Toronto director Julian Grant was intended from the beginning to be a rip-off of Mission: Impossible crossed with The Rock and is packed with gunfights, stunts, chemically-frozen human beings whose limbs snap off during taught action sequences and some really terrible acting by Steve Guttenberg, the actor for whom this film was supposed to be his doorway into the action-hero genre.\n\nFilmed in and around Toronto, Canada in the summer of 1997, Maria Giese's directorial debut follows the struggle of Jimmy Muir, a 25-year-old, working class lad who dreams of becoming a football star.\n\nJimmy is a hard-drinking brewery worker in the city of Sheffield, with an arrogant lack of respect for authority. His entire life revolves around football (Sheffield United) and while he shows the potential, he has never had the courage or discipline to make anything of it.\n\nJimmy's fortunes take a turn for the better after he is spotted by football manager Ken Jackson, while he's playing for his local pub team.\n\nAfter playing brilliantly for Jackson, Jimmy is offered a trial at Sheffield United. However the evening before the trial he bows to the pressure of his class and gets drunk; he wakes up feeling rough and blows his chances with SUFC.\n\nFaced with failure, a critical father and a dismal job, Jimmy soon becomes suicidal as his problems compound: his brother dies in a mining accident, he loses his job at the brewery and his pregnant girlfriend Annie ends their relationship. Jimmy is forced to consider his future and his choices, and to discover once and for all whether he has the self discipline to succeed.\n\nWhen Saturday Comes was shot on location in Sheffield and Rotherham from 15 January until 17 February 1995. Final game sequences were shot during a live match at Bramall Lane before a live attending crowd. Times have changed. The Iron Curtain has fallen, giving way to a new world order, and the power plays of political agendas have been replaced by ruthless plots for profit. The war has changed...but the warriors remain the same.\n\n9 years after infiltrating a chemical weapons facility in Russia, where friend and fellow M:I-6 agent Alec Trevelyan 006 was killed by corrupt Russian military officer General Ourumov. Seductive British secret agent James Bond 007 is assigned by his new boss, a female 'M' to recover \"GoldenEye\" the access key to a top secret space weapon orbiting the Earth which fires a electromagnetic pulse which shuts down all electronic equipment. The \"GoldenEye\" has been stolen from the Severnya space research station by General Ourumov and the lethal and deadly Xenia Onatopp and slaughtered everyone at Servernya. Helped by Russian computer programmer Natalya Siminova, who was the sole survivor of the Servernya massacre and witnessed Ourumov and Xenia steal the \"GoldenEye\", Bond learns Ourumov and Xenia are working for Alec Trevelyan, now a renegade M:I-6, and 006 plans on using GoldenEye to wipe out London. 007 and Natalya set out to Cuba where Bond faces Trevelyan in a thrilling showdown as 007 sets out to save London from destruction. Jacob and Rachel are two young lovers willing to go through anything to be together. After tricking his older brother Esau out of his birthright, Jacob leaves home in fear of his life. Upon seeing Rachel's beauty for the first time, he forgets his past and only dreams of his future with her.\n\nPenniless and unemployed, Jacob offers Rachel's father the only thing he can give for her hand in marriage - manual labor for seven years. But Uncle Laban is a treacherous and selfish man, and on what should be the happiest night of Jacob's life, he orchestrates the ultimate deceit. Rachel must watch as Jacob is forced to start a family with another. Jacob must work for his conniving uncle for close to two decades to win the love of his life.\n\nThis film is one of a series of Bible stories made by the U.S. based Turner Network Television (TNT), shot on location with input from religious leaders and historians from around the world. In this blockbuster, six hour, $40 million sequel to Gone With the Wind, Scarlett is spurned by family and society, but wants only to regain the love of her husband Rhett. However, the charming hero rejects her again and again.\n\nIn one dramatic sequence, Rhett saves Scarlett from drowning, only to be drawn passionately into her arms, but in the morning the handsome hero is gone. Scarlett retreats in anguish, carrying Rhett's child, to her family home in Ireland. She finds love with a ruthless English Earl and a warm welcome thousands of miles from Southern society.\n\nLater, Rhett arrives in Ireland with his new wife and Scarlett, heartbroken once again, retreats to London with the Earl of Fenton. It seems that the two greatest lovers in cinema history are doomed to be apart.\n\nThe shooting schedule began in the UK on 09 January 1994; continued in the state of South Carolina in the US from the end of March until late April; and finished in Ireland, where the cameras rolled from mid-May until 23 June 1994. A Woman's Guide to Adultery tells the story of four women, each of whom is involved in an adulterous affair while trying at the same time to break free of the deceit, lies and misery their relationships invariably foster.\n\nThe plot focuses on Rose, who disapproves of extra-marital affairs on the grounds that any woman who sleeps with another woman's husband is committing a crime against her gender; Jo, a politician who is having an affair with a Labour MP; advertising executive Helen, who is married to Michael but is secretly bedding her boss; and Jennifer, a university art professor who becomes involved with one of her students.\n\nWhen Rose signs up for a photography course taught by married lecturer Paul, she finds herself beginning a relationship which goes against all of her better principles.\n\nBased on the novel by Carol Clewlow, A Woman's Guide to Adultery was shot on location in Paris, and in Bristol, England from 27 May to 17 July 1993. When Chief Inspector Morse goes to prison - not permanently, but to solve the killing of a convicted real-estate swindler - he discovers that it's not any easier to trap a murderer when the suspects are already locked up.\n\nThe dead man, Lawrence Cryer, was one of an \"unholy\" trio of real-estate entrepreneurs who stole millions of pounds from their investors. They were convicted and sent to serve out two-year terms at Farnleigh, an experimental low-security prison, where the inmates are known as \"guests\". Morse is sure that a large amount of money from the swindle is hidden away, and Cryer's two remaining partners-in-crime - the cynical Alex Bailey and the born-again Christian Brian Thornton immediately come under suspicion.\n\nIn their investigation, Morse and Detective Sergeant Lewis enter the world of the prison, where they soon discover that everything is not as \"progressive\" as it seems. While Morse must tread carefully with the prison's warden, Mrs. Stevens, whose reputation is on the line, Lewis must keep his eye on an ambitious young police cadet who is trying to crack his first big case. And where does Charlie Bennett, a man who claims he was mistakenly sent to prison for his wife's murder, fit in?\n\nAbsolute Conviction was filmed in August 1991 and is the fourth episode of Series 6 of Inspector Morse. In 1983, a ruthless South London gang thought they had hit the jackpot when, after pouring petrol over guards in a Brinks-Mat warehouse at Heathrow Airport, and threatening to set them alight if they didn't open the safe, they discovered - not the #1 million in cash they were expecting - but three tons of bullion destined for the Far East.\n\nBritain's biggest-ever robbery - the bullion was worth #26 million - led eventually to betrayal, death and misery, and the imprisonment of a dozen people in a series of trials spread over the best part of a decade. London Weekend Television had to wait until no more trials were pending before they could screen the drama in 1992.\n\nThe gang leader, Micky McAvoy, is currently serving 25 years in prison. In spite of McAvoy's belief that his friends would never betray him, the vast bulk of the gold was quickly melted down and was never recovered. About #18 million of the proceeds were traced to various bank accounts.\n\nFilming took place from 23 March until 23 April, 1992 in the East End of London, in Kent and in Spain where, in time-honoured tradition, some of the villains were believed to have fled. The production was shot on a budget of less than #500,000. British author Samuel Richardson went all out when he wrote Clarissa in the mid-18th century. At more than one million words, it's the longest novel in English literature.\n\nClarissa is the story of a virtuous, virginal heiress who runs away from her nasty family. Her family have aspirations to move into the aristocracy and want her to marry the repellent Mr Soames as part of their plan. Clarissa manages to escape from them with the help of the handsome Lovelace, whose intentions towards her prove to be less than entirely honourable. But it is the steadfast virtue of Miss Harlowe that turns the tables on Lovelace as he discovers some ugly truths about himself and searches for redemption at the hands of his best friend.\n\nWith a budget of over #3 million, filming on Clarissa began 29 Apr 1991 and continued for 16 weeks until 19 July 1991. Locations included several large country houses (one in the north of England, another near Stratford, and a third in Hampstead). Some exteriors were shot outside The Inns of Court in London but much of the filming was done at London's Ealing Studios, where a three-storey Georgian house was specially constructed for the series. This Irish drama, with black-clad figures moving across the Ulster landscape, is set in the war torn country between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland where involvement in the IRA is ripping families apart. The lives of two sisters are suddenly thrown into turmoil when they find their own ways to cope after their husbands leave on a dangerous mission.\n\nMargaret is pregnant and left with two grown children - her son David, who is being pulled in two directions by his parents fighting, and her daughter, Morna, who resents her mother's anger forward her father and her mother's relationship with McQuire, her father's enemy. Meanwhile, Margaret's sister, Helen, begins a romantic relationship with a stranger.\n\nSean Bean plays Smith, the British soldier who begins the affair with Helen. In his hotel room, Smith takes a telephone call, then leaves to kill a man who works with his lover's husband. The widow of this man turns out to be Margaret - Helen's sister. At the funeral Margaret asks Helen if her time spent with Smith was 'worth it'. She responds 'Yes, every bit of it'.\n\nIn a memorable scene in bed, Smith and his lover have the following exchange: Woman: \"Who are you?' Smith: \"Who do I look like?\" Woman: \"You look like Lawrence of Arabia without the camel.\" Smith: \"That's me.\" The film ends with a surprising turn of events. The inspiration for this drama came from the Greek dramatist Aeschylos' trilogy, the 'Orestia', which tells the story of Agamemnon's return from the Trojan War and his subsequent murder by his wife, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus, which is avenged by Agamemnon's son, Orestes.\n\nFilming began on 19 November 1990 at Howth, near Dublin, and continued for three weeks. This drama was awarded Best Television Drama at the 1991 Banff Television Festival and Best Made for Television Drama at the Chicago Film Festival. Laura Simms is in her early thirties. Her ex-boyfriend Michael, whom she still sees, is charming, unreliable and unfaithful. Over Laura's birthday dinner, he tells her he is getting married. This upsets Laura and she runs to the Ladies' Room; while she's away, Michael scrawls their waitress's telephone number on the bill, which Laura sees on her return. She reacts angrily and rushes out of the restaurant, eventually losing her way in a dark alley. She is followed by a stranger, who saw what happened and paid the bill. He offers to call her a taxi.\n\nTell Me That You Love Me reworks the classic women's magazine romance into a deliberately light drama with menacing undertones. The opening sequences contain romantic cliches: candle-lit dinners, beautiful clothes, an irresponsible yet irresistable ex-boyfriend, and a strong, silent lover.\n\nBut here is where conventional romances end. In this case, Tell Me That You Love Me becomes a thriller. The heroine discovers that her dream lover is a violent and obsessive man who punches a drunk in a restaurant, believing a pass was made at Laura; who leaves a string of messages on her answerphone and inundating her with twelve dozen roses after they've quarreled and becomes insanely jealous of Michael. In the end, the consequences of this relationship are both menacing, and tragic.\n\nTell Me That You Love Me was filmed 08 October to 04 November 1990. Steve teaches history at the school which he previously attended as a pupil (\"five years as a kid, eight years as a teacher\"), and devotes his spare time to the Sealed Knot Society, dressed in 17th century uniform and wielding a pikestaff. His commanding officer is also his head of department. The action starts on the field of Naseby, on one of those mornings when \"I want to die in an early skirmish\".\n\nSteve is a school teacher who still lives at home, cannot make life decisions, but is NOT so geeky that he doesn't fancy a girl, can put up a fight, and proves that indeed there is a real man in there. He drinks with his friend Pud and on the surface, the two appear to be codependent. He tolerates the excessive attention he gets from his mother, transports his pike on the roofrack of his unreliable car and eventually, he plucks up enough courage to make a date with Sharon only to have his mate, Pud, tag along. He sees his pupils as future cannon fodder, like himself.\n\nWith wry humour, the play explores his dreams of escape and occasional rebellious outbursts against the footsoldier's lot. When Sharon points out his inability to take control of his life and lack of courage to change anything, Steve realizes what he stands to lose and what kind of life he is doomed to live out and declares his manhood.\n\nMy Kingdom for a Horse was filmed in September 1988. Ireland, 1939, memories of the great potato famine (1845-49) still persist, as do the country's feudal farming practices. After years of backbreaking toil, tenant Bull McCabe has transformed the field from three acres of rocky wasteland into a lush green pasture. But when the widow landlady decides to put the property up for auction without considering his work, an outraged McCabe is determined to buy it at all costs.\n\nUnfortunately, there is another interested party, an American, whose plans for the field include paving it over to provide access to the limestone-rich hills beyond. Further complicating Bull's troubles are his slow-witted son Tadgh, who to his father's dismay shows no inclination towards making anything of a life for himself; and McCabe's wife Maggie, to whom Bull has not spoken a single word since the suicide death of their other son twenty years earlier.\n\nWhen Tadgh falls in love with a rough gypsy girl, Bull is outraged. The gypsies are a displaced people who don't care about the land - and to Bull, the land - and his field - means stability, ownership and family tradition. Bull's constant companion, the simple minded Bird O'Donnell tries to warn him of the consequences of his obsession with both the field and his quest to make a man out of Tadgh, but his advice goes unheeded, with ultimately tragic consequences.\n\nWith a budget of #5 million, filming on The Field began on 02 October 1989 and lasted for eight weeks. Windprints is the story of a young South African trying to come to terms with his role in a society going through tremendous social and political changes.\n\nAnton van Heerden, a news cameraman working at the forefront of the political upheaval in Johannesburg during the early 1980's, is sent to film a manhunt in Namibia where he is forced to confront his attitude to his work and his Afrikaner roots, with violent consequences.\n\nAnton is known as a highly skilled cameraman, capable of getting sensational news footage. Like many cameramen, he uses the camera to keep an objective distance between himself and the events he records. A colleague, Thozamile, however, accuses him of recklessness and urges him to get more personally involved in the events he films. As his camera work is seen across the world he has a responsibility to ensure it reflects the events accurately rather than relying on sensation for effect.\n\nAnton is given the opportunity to consider Thozamile's challenge when he is sent to Namibia by his bureau chief to work with veteran news journalist, Charles Rutherford. To his people, Nhadiep's ability to defy the authorities has come to symbolize a spirit of defiance against the settlers in Namibia, despite his violence towards his own people.\n\nAnton is gradually in by the mysteries surrounding the enigmatic Nhadiep and soon finds himself aggressively urging the pragmatic and skeptical Charles to get to the 'heart of the story', with dramatic consequences for all.\n\nSet against the stark Namibian landscape, Windprints is in many ways a parable, a window onto the complex world of a society that is struggling to contain the rapid and inevitable changes that are taking place. It is told from the point of view of a young liberal Afrikaner who, though bewildered by the problems that beset his country, learns to fight for what he believes. War Requiem, portrayed without dialogue from the principal players to the accompaniment of Benjamin Britten's masterwork, the 1961 oratorio War Requiem, is a parade of images - brutal, exquisite, erotic, and painterly. Derek Jarman presents a hallucinatory vision of war, drawing on the life and verse of WWI poet Wilfred Owen, who was killed on a French battlefield two weeks before the Armistice. Owen's preoccupations include the Christ-like martyrdom of soldiers, the interplay of sexuality and death, the pity and horror evoked by the mutilation of young bodies.\n\nPrimarily seen as an anti-war film of surpassing power, War Requiem has also been interpreted as a metaphorical treatment of the devastation of youth by AIDS. The soundtrack recording of Britten's music is by the London Symphony Orchestra with soloists including Peter Pears and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. Laurence Olivier's cameo in this film was his last screen appearance.\n\nFilming began on 17 October 1988 and lasted for 18 days. War Requiem had its world premiere on 06 January 1989 and its European debut at The Berlin Film Festival. It was broadcast on BBC2 at Easter, 1989. Etched in blood, passion and tragedy, The Fifteen Streets is an intensely moving Victorian-era drama, based on the best-selling novel by Catherine Cookson, one of England's most celebrated and beloved authors.\n\nJohn O'Brien is a dock worker who fights against the suffering around him with his heart, unlike the members of his rowdy, brawling family - which includes his wayward and mean-spirited brother Dominic.\n\nAfter a chance meeting with his sister's beautiful teacher, Mary Llewellyn, romance blossoms for John. But this appears doomed because of the very nature of the classes of society which separate them. The arrival of a family of spiritual healers, or \"spooks\", complicates matters, as does the surprise pregnancy of Nancy, a local girl who accuses John of being the father. No one, however, is prepared for the eventual tragedy which will affect the lives of everyone in the street.\n\nFilmed on location in Newcastle and Heaton. Other locations included the Beamish Museum in Co Durham and the Marsden Grotto in South Shields. Filming began 22 March 1989 and lasted for six weeks. Set in 1919 at a huge, decaying hotel on the Wicklow coast, the Majestic is symbolic of the doomed splendour and folly of British rule in Ireland, and the focus throughout is on its flawed and fading inhabitants, rather than on the forces of independence. A grand hotel fallen into decay, two women with secrets and a dangerous political situation about to boil over - these intriguing elements all combine in this gripping drama.\n\nIn 1919, Major Brendan Archer arrives in Ireland to reunite with his fiancie, Angela Spencer. Unfortunately, the family home, The Majestic Hotel, is a decaying shadow of its former self, as is Angela. Puzzled by the changes, Archer's attentions are soon drawn to her lively friend, Sarah Devlin, a passionate Irish nationalist. They fall in love, but the Major soon discovers some disturbing aspects about their relationship which threaten to explode into violence, destruction and murder.\n\nIn a departure from the traditional voice-over, the characters speak directly to the camera, while the novel's \"documentary\" narrative - the \"troubles\" going on all over the world - is played out by some deaf and short-sighted elderly ladies who spend their days reading stories from the newspapers to one another. Partly based on the known facts about the painter's life, the film follows Caravaggio's childhood on the streets of Rome, where he sold his paintings, to his sponsorship by the wealthy Cardinal Del Monte. His models were usually prostitutes and low-life street people, including Ranuccio, a streetwise gambler with whom he becomes infatuated when he hires him as one of his models. His constant companion was a deaf-mute boy he'd bought as a child who fled with him from Rome after Caravaggio killed Ranuccio and fled to Naples where he died a pauper.\n\nHis inauspicious demise was an indirect result of the drama brought about by Ranuccio's prostitute girlfriend Lena when she announces she is pregnant. There is some question as to the identity of the father, since Caravaggio has also fallen in love with her. Lena is later found dead, having drowned in the river, and Ranuccio is arrested and charged with her murder. Caravaggio believes Ranuccio innocent and engineers his release, only to find his model now admits to the killing. Enraged, Caravaggio slits Ranuccio's throat.\n\nIt is a film filled with eccentricities, some involving the use of deliberate anachronisms. Caravaggio is credited with inventing chiaroscuro, a style of theatrical lighting employing artfully placed shadows, and this technique is carried over into the actual design of the film, where is used in the live recreation of Caravaggio's paintings.\n\nFilmed, on a shoestring budget of $715,000 from the British Film Institute, in abandoned warehouses along the Thames River in the Isle of Dogs in London. Production began on 02 September 1985 and ended six weeks later. The Practice was a British tv medical drama series which aired 1985-1986. Produced by Granada Television, it was inspired by the Australian series A Country Practice. The stories revolved around the staff and patients of a northern health centre.\n\nIn \"I Can Handle It\", things are going missing from Dr. Golding's home: valuable china figures, a table lighter, #20 in cash.... His wife Gillian suspects their teenage daughter Heather. As the Goldings tackle the marital problems which have separated them, they face a new danger threatening their already disrupted home life. Heather is helping to finance her new boyfriend Mick Forrester's drug habit. And she wants to join in: \"I'm not an addictive personality,\" she says. \"I can handle it.\"\n\nAngie and Terry Donlan are risking eviction from their slum flat because of a protest rent strike. But when their young son Wayne is taken ill into hospital, they stand to lose more than their home. \"You know what will happen, don't you?\" says Terry. \"They'll take the kid away and we won't see him again.\"\n\nThe Health Centre's new abrasive junior partner Chris Clark is winning few friends among his colleagues. \"Did we make a mistake taking him on?\" asks Dr. Vincent. But Dr. Vincent finds out who her own friends are when a surprise visitor drops in on her 40th birthday party.\n\nIn \"The Tragedy of Heroin\", Heather's relationship with Forrester leads to a domestic confrontation with her mother, Gillian, and father, senior partner Dr. Lawrence Golding. It is only when Heather meets heroin addict Carla - \"the saddest person I've ever seen\" - that she realises the dangers of addiction and Mick's own hard-hearted ruthlessness. \"She must have more different chemicals in her than ICI,\" says Mick. But when tragedy strikes Carla it is Heather who responds - and faces the threat of discovery by the Police.\n\nAngie and Terry Donlan are evicted from their slum flat. And when Health Visitor Carol Stansfield helps to smuggle their sick son into hospital without Terry's knowledge his anger explodes into violence.\n\nSean appeared in two episodes of The Practice: \"I Can Handle It,\" on June 13 and \"The Tragedy of Heroin,\" on June 20, 1986. The two episodes were filmed at Granada's Manchester studios in August 1985. Cornwall, 1914. A well-dressed man gets off a bus. He reaches a mining village and enters the inn. The landlady, mother of an only daughter, is clearly attracted to him. But when the light falls on his face, and she sees him better, her attitude suddenly changes. Tensely she waits for closing time and hurries everyone out. But the stranger refuses to budge.\n\nThe woman's anger turns to fury when the man tells her he's her husband, returned from America after 16 years. She denies him and has him tied up and forcibly thrown out. From her window, the daughter watches this man, who could be her father, free himself from his ropes and walk away.\n\nLater that night, the man comes back for a second time. In South Yorkshire in 1978, Joey is uncomplicated extrovert. He wants money, sex and freedom (not necessarily in that order) and is doing well on all three fronts. Spansky is a bookish lad who has left school for a job as a groundsman at an ancient monument. By studying form and placing surreptitious bets, he has maintained a winning streak that has laid a nice fat bankroll under his pillow. Reluctantly, he agrees to go into a betting partnership with his old mate, Joey.\n\nPunters is an intricate and fascinating portrait of a gambler -- not showing an old failure who cannot stop backing horses -- but a young success who does stop (much to the fury of his uncomprehending friend). The Epilogue finds Joey as a family man amiably enjoying his wife's earnings and Spansky as an earnest university maths student.\n\nSean can be spotted in a scene that takes place in a disco. He has several lines. Filmed in Doncaster, production began on 05 February 1984 and ended on 01 March 1984. The Bill is a British drama series centered around a Metropolitan Police Station in London, England.
