        "text": "Although it’s not the first thing you’d think of when you’d think of my home-country of Canada, [I tend to think “snow”] we actually make a lot of horror films! The best part is that many of them are recognizable by a larger set audience – even if you didn’t know they were made in Canada! We have had some of the best films the horror genre has had to offer, and that’s why I feel like I want to talk about Canadian horror. Specifically, five of my favorite horror films made here in the White North. Be sure to stick around, cause you never know if you’ll be surprised at some of these Canadian gems! Not surprisingly, many of the films on this list were filmed either entirely, or in part, in Toronto, Ontario.\n\nSPLICE :\n\nSplice was a weird, albeit exciting film about two young scientists who are told by their employers to quit their research on splicing together DNA. Although they swear that they’ve stopped the work, they secretly continue their work, but this time with human DNA. Filmed mainly in Toronto, Ontario; Splice also was filmed – in part – in Hamilton: just outside of Toronto.\n\nSILENT HILL :\n\nbased on the video game of the same name, Silent Hill didn’t get the attention it deserved; since a lot of gamers found the story to be incorrect, or just terribly adapted. As a fan of the games myself, I actually found the movie refreshing – giving the sleepy town of Silent Hill a new spin. Like Splice, this movie was mainly filmed in Toronto, Ontario; but also had scenes shot in Winnipeg, Manitoba!\n\nTUCKER & DALE VS EVIL :\n\narguably my favorite horror-comedy in a long time, Tucker & Dale VS Evil is a film everyone that enjoys the horror genre should see at least once. It’s funny, it’s vicious, and it’s got heart. I won’t explain what happens in the film, because it’s best going in blind – let’s just say I was told about the film, I watched it on Netflix, and then promptly ordered it..like immediately after seeing it. The film was shot entirely in Alberta.\n\nVIDEODROME :\n\none of my more favorite films on this list ever since I bought a shirt from Fright-Rags with the same image above printed on it. [order that shirt here!] Videodrome is probably the weirdest thing you’ll see on tape/dvd/bluray. It’s a film you have to watch more than once to “feel” like you understand it – even if you don’t. It follows a sleazy TV programmer who begins to see his life and the future of media spin out of control when he acquires a new kind of programming for his station.. It was filmed in various sections of Toronto, Ontario\n\nAMERICAN MARY :\n\nI’ve talked about it before, I’ll mention it again, Mary Mason [above] is extremely hot.. like, ridiculously. The Soska twins definitely grab my attention every time they cast Katharine Isabelle in one of their films, her acting is just as good as her looks. American Mary is no different: It’s gory, it’s entertaining, it’s even a little sad by the end of the film. Totally recommended. Unlike many of the other choices on this list, this film wasn’t filmed in Toronto, but rather Vancouver, British Colombia!\n\nObviously, there are a dozen and one other Canadian films out there, I just decided to mention my favorite five. Hopefully this list showed you that there are actually well known movies that were made in the Great White North, especially big named movies such as Splice or even Videodrome! Because there’s so many more Canadian horrors, I may just have to a part two to this list. But only if there’s enough demand for it. What Canadian Horror film is your favorite? Tucker & Dale? maybe even Silent Hill – or, is it not mentioned on this list? Let me know in a comment, below!
