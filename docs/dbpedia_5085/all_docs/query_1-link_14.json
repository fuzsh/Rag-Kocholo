        "text": "40 minutes is pretty lengthy. Ideally we're gonna get a trailer for everything.\n\nHave zero faith in Gans to make a good Silent Hill movie, couldn't care less about his interpretation of SH2.\n\nGonna give SH2 Remake a chance but I'm also not going to nice to it just for the sake of it, SH2 is an important game to me so if I don't like what they do with it, I won't force myself to be kind. Will give it a fair shake but that's all I can offer.\n\nTownfall and F are projects I'm way more interested in though. Townfall is just a big blank spot, we know nothing about it. F is... well, NeoBards don't fill me with confidence based on Resistance and ReVerse but Ryukishi07 writing a Silent Hill game is still such a wild series of events I can't wait to see what it's like.\n\nGonna give SH2 Remake a chance but I'm also not going to nice to it just for the sake of it, SH2 is an important game to me so if I don't like what they do with it, I won't force myself to be kind.

Hopefully we get more on those.\n\nFYI this is the same person that got permed here for harassing staff, unless its someone else on X that happens to have the exact same name they did here (and constantly posted about SH).\n\nIt actually might not be them since this tweet isn't sixteen paragraphs of them insulting people, asserting themselves as the definitive Silent Hill 2 expert, and threatening Bloober for defiling their sacred text.\n\nIt actually might not be them since this tweet isn't sixteen paragraphs of them insulting people, asserting themselves as the definitive Silent Hill 2 expert, and threatening Bloober for defiling their sacred text.\n\nOh it's them alright. Was curious after seeing this posted so did a pretty basic search and it was fairly easy to confirm. Probably for the best we just move on, though.\n\nNot terribly surprised the Silent Hill wiki tends to end up helmed by the most batshit people imaginable.\n\nTo get back to the topic though, the week of Oct 7th-11th feels like a pretty good bet for release date for SH2R. I'm placing my chips on that. No later than the week of the 21st but I feel good about placing it early in October.\n\nSurprised at the heft of this transmission, too, 42 minutes is a pretty healthy runtime so I imagine we're at least getting a trailer for the movie as well (0 confidence in Gans pulling it off but we'll see).\n\nMy hopes are really hinged on Silent Hill f just because it's so radically different than anything that came before - if that turns out okay then at least there's some room for upward mobility in regards to Konami's treatment of the franchise.\n\nI want a port of the first game to modern consoles, that's my biggest wish. Otherwise, you're going to have a lot of potential players hesitant to play the remake of 2 if they can't access 1.\n\nYou think? Considering both games aren't connected at all.\n\nUnlike other entries in the series.\n\nSH2 is regarded as the best of the series so it makes sense to remake this one first.\n\nAfter that they can get on with 1 and 3.\n\nWhile I'm no huge fan of The Medium (or any other Bloober works in particular), I've never felt all that negative about SH2 Remake, after all not even RE2 or RE4 remake really \"replaced\" the originals despite their quality, so the same applies here I feel. As long as it's relatively competent from a presentation perspective and has 80% of the same story beats it should be mostly fine. Something like an 82 on Metacritic, maybe or between Resident Evil 3 Remake and Silent Hill 3, just to spitball.\n\nWhile I'm no huge fan of The Medium (or any other Bloober works in particular), I've never felt all that negative about SH2 Remake, after all not even RE2 or RE4 remake really \"replaced\" the originals despite their quality, so the same applies here I feel.

So whether you personally think it or not, their remakes do effectively replace those games.\n\nThey gave James a Leon haircut and made him look like a different person. I think they just saw the RE2 remake and just said that's good enough.\n\nIt's so weird how they can't seem to get close to what James looks like.\n\nIf they were to announce a Silent Hill Master Collection here I would be all aboard the hype train.\n\nSame.\n\nI've never felt all that negative about SH2 Remake, after all not even RE2 or RE4 remake really \"replaced\" the originals despite their quality, so the same applies here I feel.\n\nBut it quite literally is replacing the original Silent Hill 2 (and Resident Evil 2 for that matter) given that the OG releases aren't available on any modern platforms.\n\nThe original SH2, much like the original RE2, isn't available at all on modern platforms or PC.

So whether you personally think it or not, their remakes do effectively replace those games.\n\nThat is fair in a sense, though to be totally honest even the original PS1 version of RE2 isn't the highest-quality version of \"Original RE2\" either, it would need to be something like the Dreamcast or Japanese PC version or something like that (just off the top of my head). In my ideal world you'd have proper HD versions of both ready to go too, which they ironically are semi-doing with the MGS Master Collection alongside MGS3 Delta.\n\nBut it quite literally is replacing the original Silent Hill 2 (and Resident Evil 2 for that matter) given that the OG releases aren't available on any modern platforms.\n\nRight, I meant more conceptually, I concede. Though this is true for a lot of games (remake or not), not least of which RE1-3, Code Veronica, the Dino Crisis series, the Parasite Eve series, etc.\n\nThat is fair in a sense, though to be totally honest even the original PS1 version of RE2 isn't the highest-quality version of \"Original RE2\" either, it would need to be something like the Dreamcast or Japanese PC version or something like that (just off the top of my head).

If there is no way to access that original game then literally, conceptually and metaphorically a new game is a replacement until a point in time when that is no longer the case. The rest is just kind of irrelevant to what is being talked about"
