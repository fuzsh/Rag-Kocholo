We covered the project back at AFM. Filming is due to get underway soon.\n\nAlso getting funding are Jesse V. Johnson’s actioner Chief Of Station, starring Aaron Eckhart and Olga Kurylenko, and currently in post-production; Liam O’Donnell’s Skyline Radial, the fourth installment of the Skyline franchise which Foresight Unlimited is selling; and Rob Edwards’ animated film Sneaks whose cast includes Laurence Fishburne, NBA star Chris Paul, Anthony Mackie, Martin Lawrence, Chloe Bailey and rapper Quavo.\n\nLA and London-based Ashland Hill, which specialises in debt, gap and bridge financing, is aiming to back at 25 films per year. The company is headed up by Managing Partners Joe Simpson, Simon Williams and Jonathan Bross.\n\nCredits to date include The Crow, 3 Days in Malay, The Flood, Neil Marshall’s Duchess, Philip Noyce’s Fast Charlie with Pierce Brosnan, 57 Seconds with Josh Hutcherson and Morgan Freeman, and shark thriller, Deep Fear.\n\nThe company, which has been filling out its ranks in recent months, has also hired Andy Wang as Vice President, Investments.

He started his career with stints at Protagonist Pictures, Voltage Pictures, and UTA.\n\nSimon Williams commented: “We’re thrilled with the progress we’ve made during our first year and look forward to further growth during 2023. I am particularly delighted to be working with Andy Wang again. He is a proven deal-closer and further illustrates the high caliber of executives we’re adding to our ranks.”"
