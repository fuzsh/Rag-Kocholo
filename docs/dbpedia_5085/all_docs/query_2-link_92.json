        "text": "“Welcome to Silent Hill”\n\nI can remember running. Running with all the energy my nine year old legs could muster.\n\n“You can go for an hour,” mum had said, “and then come straight back!”\n\nMy friend Graham had invited me over to his to play a new game on his PlayStation. He said it looked “so cool” and that I had to come over and play it immediately. He lived just around the corner so I was able to get there in less than five minutes. I didn’t have a PlayStation myself – I had a handheld Sega Megadrive that was handed down to me from my big brother, so any chance I could get to play the magnificent PlayStation was a treat…\n\nGraham was weird. He would get his dad to record old zombie films that played on BBC 2 at four o’clock in the morning, then he’d watch them on a loop and imagine what it would be like to have his neck ripped off by a zombie flesh-eater. I remember one sleepover he turned off all the lights and made me watch a delightful old movie called “Redneck Zombies“. The film dealt with a bunch of hillbillies who drank toxic waste and became mutant flesh-eaters. It was a classic, but it was that night I realised Graham was a freak.\n\nAfter politely saying hello to Graham’s parents and declining the offer of a blackcurrant squash, I zoomed upstairs to his room so we could get playing this new game. He hadn’t even taken it out of the wrapper yet and it still had the price sticker on it. It was called “Silent Hill“. Graham quickly put the disk into the machine and grabbed his controller. We were frantic. I excitedly picked up the second controller and waited.\n\n“Oh… it’s just a one player Philip! You’ll just have to watch me play!” Graham said, taking the second controller from my hand. I remember feeling a little disappointed but I didn’t mind. I wasn’t really good at playing the PlayStation anyway, and I’d heard the game was kind of scary so I let Graham start up whilst I sat and watched.\n\nThe game began. You played as a father who’s daughter runs away to a town called Silent Hill. You follow her and have to find her in the fog-shrouded town while being followed by creepy creatures in the darkness. It was intense. I remember getting completely drawn into the game and loving every minute of watching Graham fighting off all the monsters and running around the misty town.\n\nGraham’s mum knocked on the door. “Philip, your mum’s been on the phone. Apparently you were supposed to be home an hour ago…”\n\n_________________________________\n\nThat was 1999. A whole thirteen years ago and yet that fictional town full of mysteries and puzzles still excites me and gives me that same feeling of being a nine year old running through the neighbourhood to play that creepy game on Graham’s PlayStation. In 2006 a film version of the game was made by Christophe Gans – and it is this film that has become my all time favourite movie… ever!\n\n“The Silent Hill Logo”\n\nI never actually got to see the film at the cinema, for one reason or another, I can’t remember… So I had to wait for the DVD release. On the 6th September 2006 I ordered the DVD from Amazon. It arrived two days later and then on Saturday the 9th September I sat down and watched the film for the first time. I remember distinctly my parents going out to some garden centre or whatever and I stole the opportunity of having the house to myself to put on this DVD.\n\nThere was no doubt in my mind I would enjoy the film. I had to. I had read all about it, learnt all the trivia and watched the trailer a dozen times. Within the first five minutes I was completely immersed in the world of Silent Hill once again. I was nine years old again and sitting watching Graham play the PlayStation. The same feelings and the same emotions ran through me as I watched this amazing movie. I couldn’t believe how well the film had captured the same creepy atmosphere of the game, and brought to it a whole new level of awesomeness. Halfway through the film my parents came home, and my dad happened to walk in just at the most gory part of the film (Click for a VERY GRAPHIC clip of the scene). He immediately asked what the hell I was watching, scrunched up his face and left the room. It was then that I realised I was no better than Graham watching his grindhouse zombie films on recorded VHS tapes. I was a freak too.\n\nTo me the film is amazing on two levels, firstly as a film adaptation of a game and secondly as a standalone movie. As an adaptation of the game I am with everyone when I say it is one of the best. Ultimate fanboys of the Silent Hill games will beg to differ, and could write books on how inaccurate the film is, however to the casual (and sane) viewer it is a worthier game adaptation than, say the “Resident Evil” films or “Doom“. There are a few changes to the scenario:-\n\nIn the game you play as Harry Mason, looking for your daughter Cheryl. In the film however the main character is Rose Da Silva looking for her daughter Sharon.\n\nThere is an inclusion of a subplot of Rose’s husband looking for her in the “real world” Silent Hill.\n\nThey have changed the character of Dahlia Gillespie from a villain to a protagonist.\n\nThey have added a new cult to the movie that has nothing to do with the cult in the games.\n\nSharon looking terrified at something…\n\nBut asides from all that the movie follows the game’s storyline perfectly, even using many of the same camera angles as used in the game. (This video, albeit very dark, shows you the close similarities between the game’s opening cutscene and the film’s cinematography).The film also uses the same soundtrack to the games – a brilliant collection of eerie sounds and otherworldly tracks created by musician Akira Yamaoka. By doing this it allows fans of the games to have some semblance of connection to the games – it gives us that much needed familiarity we need to connect the game to the film and allow us to appreciate the music all over again. It was the “Silent Hill” soundtrack that bonded me to my close friend Kenny, who not only had the music to the first game, he had the soundtracks to all six games in the series!\n\n“Rose Entering Silent Hill”\n\nAs a standalone film I am unfortunately among the minority when I say it is brilliant. Critics hated the film, saying it was visually impressive, yes, but was plagued with “inane dialogue, a muddled plot and an overlong runtime”. To the casual viewer all these things are accurate. To the guy who’s wanting a Saturday night horror film worthy of “Nightmare on Elm Street” or “Friday the 13th” then “Silent Hill” will not please him. To the couple who want a cheap slasher film to put on while they’re making out on the sofa – then this film will not please them. Because, you see, this film requires concentration and I imagine either some small knowledge or a lot of knowledge of the original game series. This isn’t a “Texas Chainsaw Massacre” that you can throw in the DVD player and have on in the background while you spend your night on the internet, tuning in every now and then and managing to keep up with the plot – oh no.\n\nI say this to everyone who asks me what the appeal of the film is, and why it is my all time favourite film – it’s all in the atmosphere. If I ever become a filmmaker the one thing I would strive to achieve in my films would be to create atmosphere. As soon as Rose enters Silent Hill, quietly dabbing that piece of falling ash off her cheek, there is a slightly chilling, slightly creepy and altogether unique tone created by the film.\n\nThe look and feel of the film relies heavily on the foggy\n\nand ash-shrouded sets and set decoration.\n\nI have watched the film countless times (ok I have actually counted, but it would be hugely embarrassing that) and still the film manages to keep me excited, immerse me in a creepy world, tell an interesting story and recapture that same feeling I had in my stomach those thirteen years ago as I sat cross legged on Graham’s bedroom floor watching him play the PlayStation. As a way of recapturing my nostalgic childhood memories this film serves as a perfect anecdote. As a way of appreciating a film for it’s astounding cinematography and set design – this film ticks all the boxes. Speaking of set design – for the film they created twenty five main sets (all built from scratch inside huge studios). However the film shows you these sets during four different stages. Take for instance the School set. It is shown in the film as it was in 1970. It is then shown in the film as it is now in the ‘real world’. It is then shown how it is in the ‘fog realm’, and then finally it is shown how it is in the ‘otherworld’. Therefore rather than just building twenty five sets, the creators in actual fact had to create one-hundred different sets.\n\nDuring my first viewing of this film on that Saturday afternoon at home I remember watching one particular shot and rewinding the DVD to play it over and over again. The shot is an aerial view of a chase between a police officer on a motorbike and Rose in her jeep. The camera is high in the sky (probably mounted on a helicopter, or perhaps created entirely by computer) and shows the entire skyline of Silent Hill and the surrounding area. This one shot astounded me so much that it made me realise why I loved films. To be able to make the audience feel as if they are floating over the action taking place and observing this grand spectacle from a bird’s eye view made me realise that filmmaking is a way of teaching the world new ways to dream.\n\nAn unimaginable announcement was made two years ago. The creators of the first “Silent Hill” movie were adapting a sequel and in the early stages of developing a new film. Since then I have followed each and every step of the making of “Silent Hill: Revelation 3D” – the much anticipated and, for critics, hugely unnecessary and unexpected follow up to the first film. The plot is an adaptation of the third game in the series. This means it is a direct sequel to the goings-on in the first game (the first film) and will follow many of the same characters. Rose is back, but in a much smaller role. Her husband is back and low-and-behold he is “Harry Mason” now, the main character from the first game. And the daughter Sharon is back (played by a different actress and going under a pseudonym). So far all that’s been released of the actual film are three official movie stills and a two and half minute long trailer. However from what I see it looks like the most important part of the first film (the mood and atmosphere) is recreated and reinforced in the second film. I eagerly await to see if it lives up to the expectations in my mind and manages to bring back all that childhood nostalgia."
