        "text": "One of my favorite video game series is Silent Hill. The games are works of horror that delve into deep, disturbing psychological issues of the characters. They are also games that, for some reason, tend to be developed by film buffs.\n\nSession 9 is one of the films generally cited as an inspiration for Silent Hill. In fact, Silent Hill 3 even features an area staged after the film’s iconic wheelchair shot (look at the poster image above).\n\nI watched Session 9 for the first time some time ago, and I keep meaning to watch it again. But I’m hesitant. The film is extremely unnerving, and the last time I watched it, it left me shaken and nervous. It took me a while, but I think I finally understand why.\n\nFirst, I should explain a bit about what the movie is actually about. Session 9 follows a team of contractors who have been hired to remove asbestos from an old abandoned mental institution. Each character is going through some sort of personal drama in their own lives, and one keeps sneaking away from the group to listen to some old tapes he found. The tapes record nine therapy sessions with a young woman suffering from multiple personality disorder.\n\nIn most horror films, we’d probably start seeing people get attacked by ghosts or something about half an hour in. But Session 9 doesn’t do that. It focuses on each character, on the problems in their lives, on their reactions to discovering hints of the asylum’s dark past. When something violent does finally happen, late into the film, it occurs off camera, and the audience sees only the aftermath.\n\nIt’s not until the very end that some action actually occurs on screen, and terrible things finally start happening. The rest of the film is nothing but build up.\n\nI assume most of you reading are aware of the basic structure of a plot.\n\nFirst is the Exposition, or Introduction, which sets the scene and establishes context. Then there’s the Rising Action, the slow build-up of tension as more details appear. It culminates in a Climax, which releases the tension quickly and often violently. Afterward, there is the Falling Action, as things calm down, and finally the Resolution, as the story concludes.\n\nHere’s the thing: that model isn’t just applicable to plot. It also works for Scares.\n\nPicture this scene from pretty much any horror film. The protagonist is alone in her house: Exposition. She hears a noise, goes to investigate. As she does so, the camera looms around and the music becomes tense and menacing: Rising Action. She hears an even louder noise and jumps in terror as the music swells: Climax. Oh, but it turns out it was just her cat, and she (and the audience) sighs in relief: Falling Action. Chuckling to herself, our protagonist leaves: Resolution.\n\nMost horror films are composed of multiple scares, occurring all throughout the runtime. Session 9 is built around one scare. Nearly the entire movie is that scare’s Rising Action, and by the time you do finally reach the Climax, so much tension has been built that it’s impossible to relieve it all.\n\nThat is what makes Session 9 such an effective film. That’s what makes the film stick with you after you’ve seen it. In most horror films, what remains of the tension is relieved before the end credits, but in Session 9, that tension is going to stick with you for a while, slowly draining away, leaving you a nervous wreck in the meantime."
