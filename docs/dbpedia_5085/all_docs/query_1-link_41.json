        "text": "The film industry in Ontario has made significant contributions to the world of horror cinema. While it’s widely recognised for its contributions to the world of drama, romance, and comedy, Ontario’s sinister side, as portrayed in some horror classics, remains less explored.\n\nThis article delves deep into the terrifying movie sets of Ontario, highlighting how this province has given life to many horror stories on the big screen.\n\nBlack Christmas (1974)\n\nOntario is not just about serenity and scenic beauty. Sometimes, it’s about dark tales that freeze the spine, as with this slasher classic.\n\nThe University’s Dark Past\n\nBlack Christmas, often hailed as one of the first-ever slasher films, was primarily shot at the University of Toronto. The university’s Gothic architecture provided an eerie backdrop, juxtaposing the seasonal joy of Christmas with an impending sense of doom. The old buildings with their shadowed corners gave the movie its uncanny, foreboding atmosphere.\n\nResident Evil: Apocalypse (2004)\n\nOntario’s urban landscape became the perfect setting for a zombie apocalypse, transforming its bustling centers into terrifying terrains.\n\nToronto’s Zombie Outbreak\n\nThis sequel transformed the bustling streets of Toronto into the zombie-infested Raccoon City. Iconic landmarks like City Hall took on a post-apocalyptic guise, showcasing the city’s versatility and capacity to induce terror, especially during the nighttime sequences.\n\nBride of Chucky (1998)\n\nOntario’s remote locales and old structures gave the perfect backdrop for chilling stories, especially one involving a deadly doll.\n\nA Motel’s Nightmare\n\nThough the film itself spans various locations, a significant portion was filmed in Ontario. One of the more notable spots is the Ainsley House, a remote motel that amplified the creepy ambiance necessary for this doll-centric horror movie.\n\nAmerican Psycho (2000)\n\nOntario’s corporate skyscrapers served as a chilling playground for a deranged mind in this unsettling tale.\n\nCorporate Horror in Ontario’s Heart\n\nWhile set in New York, many of the sleek, urban scenes from American Psycho were filmed in Toronto. The juxtaposition of the city’s modern, polished financial district with Patrick Bateman’s heinous crimes added an unnerving quality to the narrative.\n\nCrimson Peak (2015)\n\nGothic romance and horror melded perfectly in Ontario’s crafted settings, echoing both beauty and terror.\n\nThe Gothic Mansion’s Secrets\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s gothic romance-horror was notably filmed at Pinewood Toronto Studios. The production created a three-story Victorian mansion within the studio, complete with working elevators and detailed rooms. This crafted setting exuded both beauty and horror, making the mansion itself a central character in the film.\n\nSaw Movies\n\nOntario’s old industrial locations became synonymous with fear, dread, and the macabre in this iconic series.\n\nThe Abandoned Warehouse of Fear\n\nVarious installations of this iconic horror series have scenes shot in Ontario. Old warehouses and industrial locations in Toronto provided the perfect gritty and grim atmosphere. These settings played a crucial role in conveying the raw horror and despair of Jigsaw’s traps.\n\nAs you can see, Ontario’s shadowy corners have lent themselves to countless horror movies that have left an indelible mark on the genre. From unsettling forests to abandoned structures, these locations have set the stage for some of the most chilling scenes in horror cinema.\n\nMany of those scenes continue their influence today. Play slots at BetMGM Ontario and you will find Wicked Tales: Dark Red, where a grown up Little Red Riding Hood meets with vampires or Dracula, which is based on the original 1931 film.\n\nVideodrome (1983)\n\nOntario’s urban landscapes morphed into a technological nightmare, questioning reality in this Cronenberg classic.\n\nToronto’s Technological Horrors\n\nDavid Cronenberg’s Videodrome, a tale of technology-driven hallucinations, used Toronto as its backdrop. Locations like the ‘Cathode Ray Mission’ were haunting renditions of real spots, blurring the lines between fiction and reality in the cityscape.\n\nDawn of the Dead (2004)\n\nOntario’s familiar malls turned into frightening battlegrounds, redefining shopping experiences in a horrifying way.\n\nOntario’s Mall of the Undead\n\nThough set in Wisconsin, this zombie flick used Ontario’s Thornhill Square Shopping Center for its primary location. The mall, familiar and mundane, became a terrifying battleground against hordes of the undead, showcasing the transformative power of horror cinema.\n\nSilent Hill (2006)\n\nOntario’s sleepy towns and old streets became the mysterious and fog-filled town of Silent Hill, echoing with whispers of the unknown.\n\nThe Fog-Blanketed Ghost Town\n\nOntario’s Brantford and Hamilton were transformed into the foggy, deserted town of Silent Hill. The film took advantage of these cities’ old structures and streets, creating a palpable sense of abandonment and lurking danger.\n\nCarrie (2013)\n\nOntario’s school settings became the stage for a reimagined tale of horror, trauma, and supernatural powers."
