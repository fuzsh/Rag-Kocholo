Sponsored by Cinema Department & Harpur College Dean's Speakers Series.\n\nSpring 2024\n\nTuesday March 12: Rajee Samarasinghe\n\nThursday March 14: Christopher Harris\n\nTuesday March 26: Sheri Wills\n\nThursday April 4: Luther Price 35mm Slides, presented by Tara Nelson\n\nTuesday March 12: Rajee Samarasinghe\n\nRajee Samarasinghe was born and raised amidst the decades-long civil war in Sri Lanka. He later left for the United States where he is now based. He received his BFA from the University of California San Diego and his MFA from the California Institute of the Arts. Much of his work examines sociopolitical conditions in Sri Lanka through the scope of deconstructing ethnographic practices and the colonial gaze in contemporary media. His practice was born out of a desire to understand the circumstances around his childhood and often navigates the terrain of memory, migration, and impermanence.\n\nSamarasinghe is currently working on his debut feature film, Your Touch Makes Others Invisible, which explores post-civil war Sri Lanka—the project has received support from the Sundance Institute's Documentary Film Program, Berlinale Talents' Doc Station, Field of Vision, and True/False Film Festival’s PRISM program. He was also named one of Filmmaker Magazine’s 25 New Faces of Independent Film in 2020 and was awarded a MacDowell Fellowship in 2023. He's had solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA - Modern Mondays), the Berwick Film & Media Arts Festival, and the Los Angeles Filmforum (2220 Arts) among others.\n\nSamarasinghe’s films have been exhibited at venues internationally including the Tiger Short Competition at the International Film Festival Rotterdam, New Directors/New Films by MoMA and Film at Lincoln Center, MoMA’s Doc Fortnight, BFI London Film Festival, FIDMarseille, Festival du nouveau cinéma, Internationale Kurzfilmtage Oberhausen, Slamdance, SFFILM Festival, Melbourne International Film Festival, Vancouver International Film Festival, Guanajuato International Film Festival, BlackStar, CROSSROADS at SFMOMA, Media City, Prismatic Ground etc. He’s received the Tíos Award for Best International Film at the Ann Arbor Film Festival, the Film House Award for Visionary Filmmaking at the Athens International Film + Video Festival, and an Honorable Mention Award at the Thomas Edison Film Festival among others.\n\nThursday March 14: Christopher Harris\n\nChristopher Harris makes films and video installations that read African American\n\nhistoriography through the poetics and aesthetics of experimental cinema. His work\n\nemploys manually and photo-chemically altered appropriated moving images, staged\n\nre-enactments of archival artifacts and interrogations of documentary conventions. His current project is a series of optically printed 16mm experimental films in conversation with canonical works of African American literature.\n\nThe screening program includes:\n\nstill/here (60 min, 2000)\n\nDreams Under Confinement (2.5 min, 2020)\n\nHarris has shown his work at prestigious film festivals and art venues, including his soloscreenings/exhibitions at the Belo Horizonte International Short Film Festival in Brazil,the Images Festival in Toronto, Encontro de Cinema Negro in Rio de Janeiro, Arsenal-Institute in Berlin, the Essay Film Festival in London, the True/False Film Fest in MO,the Brakhage Center Symposium in CO, and the Gene Siskel Film Center in IL, and theWexner Center for the Arts in OH.

She explores the material, psychological, and philosophical potentials of cinema to reveal small moments that often go unseen and pull forward the emotional content of abstract imagery.\n\nShe has had one-person shows at venues including the Director’s Lounge in Berlin, the Robert Beck Memorial Cinema in NYC, and the Ann Arbor Film Festival. Her films have been screened internationally, such as at the Museum of Modern Art in NY, the Edinburgh International Film Festival, Cinémas Différents in Paris, the International Film Festival in Rotterdam, the London Film Festival, San Francisco Cinematheque, Fisura in Mexico City, the Abattoirs Museum in Toulouse, France, and Microscope Gallery in NYC. Her films are distributed by Light Cone in Paris.\n\nHer collaborations include live video projects with music composed by Jan Jirásek, Charles Norman Mason, Bright Sheng, and Ofer Ben-Amots and video performances with music ensembles, including the NYC choral group, Khorikos, the Providence String Quartet, Luna Nova New Music Ensemble, and Ensemble QAT in Montreal, at venues including Roulette in Brooklyn, the Firehouse Space in Brooklyn, and the Czech Center in NYC.\n\nShe has participated recently at residencies including the Narva Art Residency in Estonia, At Home Gallery in Slovakia, and the Studios at MASS MoCA.\n\nSheri Wills is an American Council on Education Fellow and a Professor at the Rhode Island School of Design, where in 2019 she was honored with the Frazier Award for Teaching Excellence.\n\nSheri Wills is a 2023 Guggenheim Fellow.\n\nWork to be screened will include:\n\nWhat does light remember?

At Visual Studies Workshop, Tara oversees the cataloging, preservation and interpretation of the VSW collections. She is the lead programmer for the VSW Salon, and the Managing Editor of VSW Press. Recent publications from VSW Press's Film Art Book (FAB) imprint include: Bouquets 11-20: Notebooks by Rose Lowder (2018); Measuring Time by Ephraim Asili (2020); Feral Domestic by Dani and Sheilah ReStack (2022).\n\nLuther Price (January 26, 1962 – June 13, 2020) was a prolific artist whose work explored the deepest, darkest corners of the human experience. Working in film, performance, sculpture, photography and mixed media, his haunting images were often composed from found elements, thickly layered with ink, paint, glue, tape and bodily fluids. Price's films are sculptural compositions in which images of eviscerated bodies, raw meat, hardcore gay porn, and laughing clowns occupy the same psychic space as quiet scenes of street corners, blue skies and empty clotheslines. Born in Marlborough, Massachusetts, Price attended the Massachusetts College of Art in the early 1980's, where he studied sculpture and performance before turning to Super 8 film after being shot in Nicaragua in 1985. With the support of Super 8 filmmaker Saul Levine, his teacher at MassArt, Price pushed the boundaries of the \"home movie\" medium, stepping into each role of the fractured family to conjure complicated apparitions on the scratched surface of the film. His practice evolved to include found footage and \"handmade film\" techniques, incorporating ink, dirt, spit, splices and the process of decay into the production. Price's work with 16mm found footage is some of the most sophisticated in the tradition, with more than 80 original titles created in the course of his career. In the last decade of his life, Price created breathtaking collages on 35mm slides, combining the techniques he had mastered in his film works to culminate in single frame compositions.\n\nFall 2023\n\nNOVEMBER 9 (THU.)\n\nJoshua Gen Solondz\n\nIn-theater presentation at Lecture Hall 6\n\nPROGRAM includes: AGAINST LANDSCAPE (2013, 4 min), it's not a prison if you never try the door (2013, 7 min), LUNA E SANTUR (2016, 10 min), (tourism studies) (2019, 7 min), NE CORRIDOR (2022, 6.5 min), WE DON'T TALK LIKE WE USED TO (2023, 36 min)\n\nJoshua Gen Solondz is an artist working in moving image, sound, and performance.

A graduate of Binghamton University’s Cinema Department, Bode studied with Larry Gottheim, Nicholas Ray, Ken Jacobs and Peter Kubelka, and later with Woody and Steina Vasulka, Paul Sharits, Tony Conrad and Hollis Frampton at SUNY Buffalo’s Media Study Program. Bode worked at the Experimental TelevisionCenter (ETC), which his lifelong mentor and friend Ralph Hocking established in Binghamton in 1969. At the ETC, Bode made his seminal early works while assisting and collaborating with the video artist and engineer David Jones, whose “Jones Frame Buffer” became a signature processor within Bode’s oeuvre. His work has been widely exhibited nationally and internationally at venues including MoMA, Anthology Film Archives, the Whitney Biennial, the European Media Art Festival (Germany), Impakt Film and Video Art Festival (the Netherlands), Viper Festival (Switzerland), among many others. A key figure of the Owego and Alfred schools of video arts, Bode headed the Video Arts Program at the School of Art and Design, NYSCC at Alfred University, where he co-founded the Institute for Electronic Arts (IEA). Bode is Professor of Art, Emeritus at Alfred University, Alfred, NY.\n\nKATHY HIGH is a graduate of the master’s program at SUNY Buffalo’s Center for Media Studies, where her mentors were the pioneering film/video artists Steina Vasulka and Tony Conrad. Her co-edited book The Emergence of Video Processing Tools: Television Becoming Unglued, with Sherry Miller Hocking of the Experimental Television Center, and Mona Jimenez of the Moving Image Preservation Program at New York University, was published 2014 by Intellect Books (UK), a subsidiary of Chicago University Press. The book presents stories of the development of early video tools and systems designed and built by artists and technologists during the late 1960s and 70s, and how that history of collaborations among inventors, designers and artists has affected contemporary tool-makers. Today, High is an interdisciplinary artist who collaborates with scientists, technologists and activists. She is Professor of Arts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Troy, NY, and is director of the BioArt and Technology Laboratory in RPI’s Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies where she is also an affiliate faculty member.

Her work puts a subversive spin on the traditional mythology of women in film and the psychology of sexuality and violence. Exploring the dark side of female subjectivity, her “feminist fairy tales” focus on friendships, age, and the natural world. She has shown internationally in festivals, museums and alternative spaces, and is represented incollections including the Museum of Modern Art in NYC, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Centre Georges Pompidou Musee National d'Art Moderne, Paris, France. She has received numerous film festival awards, and grants from the Guggenheim Foundation, American Film Institute, National Endowment for the Arts, and the Mary L. Nohl Foundation.

The films elaborate a response to the fiction of our world, the construction of images and sounds, the repeating cycles of life and nature. The profoundness of Gottheim's act is to elaborate a body of work outside of fashion and within a search for an authentic language of cinematic discourse.\" – John Hanhardt, Whitney Museum of American Art\n\nIn-person presentation (3/28)\n\nPROGRAM: Natural Selection (16mm, color, sound, 35 min., 1983) / Knot/not (video, color, sound, 22 min., 2019) / Entanglement (video, color, sound, 27 min., 2022). TRT 84 min.\n\nHere is a recording of Larry Gottheim's introduction and a Q&A after the screening at the event.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4t4yBcutydw\n\nOnline presentation (3/30) 7:30 pm\n\nZoom link: https://binghamton.zoom.us/j/91462774627\n\nPROGRAM: Harmonica (16mm, color, sound, 10 min., 1971) / Four Shadows (16mm, color, sound, 64 min., 1978) / The Red Thread (16mm, color, sound, 17 min., 1987)\n\nTRT 91 min.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/S2FUPzNDbIU\n\n(This program will be available until Thursday, 4/06)\n\nLARRY GOTTHEIM is a key figure in the history and development of American avant-garde cinema through the 1970s and 1980s. From his late-1960s series of sublime films to the dense sound/image constructs of the mid-1970s and after, his cinema is the cinema of presence, of observation, and of deep conscious engagement. While addressing genres of landscape, diary and assemblage filmmaking, Gottheim's work properly stands alone in its intensive investigations of the paradoxes between direct, sensual experience in collision with complex structures of repetition, anticipation and memory. Gottheim founded the Department of Cinema at Binghamton University and taught there until 1998. In the 1990's Gottheim has also served for a brief time as director of the Filmmaker's Co-op in New York. Gottheim's films are in the collections of museums and archives throughout the world, and a program of his restored early films premiered at the 2005 New York Film Festival.\n\nCo-sponsored by the Cinema Department and Harpur College Dean’s Speakers Series\n\nINFO: 607 777 4998\n\nwww.binghamton.edu/cinema/events/visiting-artists.html\n\nwww.facebook.com/CinemaBinghamtonU/\n\nFall 2022\n\nSEPTEMBER 20 (TUE.)\n\nKen Jacobs: From Here to Eternalism\n\nOnline presentation\n\nIn the first part of this two-day program, we are thrilled to present recent digital “3-D Eternalism” works by the legendary avant-garde artist Ken Jacobs, cofounder of Binghamton University’s Cinema Department. The program also includes some older works Jacobs has selected for the occasion. He will join us on Zoom on Thursday, September 22, for a talk moderated by Vincent Grenier, to reflect on his uncompromising exploration of cinematic art.\n\nPROGRAM: From Introduction to Orson Welles’s Falstaff: Chimes at Midnight (digital video, 4:30 min. 2022) / Things to Come (digital video, 35 min., 2019) / Capitalism: Child Labor (digital video, 14 min., 2006) / Perfect Film (16mm, 22 min., 1985) TRT 76 min.\n\nDistinguished Professor Emeritus, KEN JACOBS, was born in Brooklyn, NY, in 1933. He studied painting with one of the prime creators of Abstract Expressionism, Hans Hofmann, in the mid-fifties. It was then that he also began filmmaking (Star Spangled to Death). His personal star rose, to just about knee high, with the sixties’ advent of Underground Film. In 1967, with the involvement of his wife Florence and many others aspiring to a democratic – rather than demagogic – cinema, he created The Millennium Film Workshop in New York City. A non-profit filmmaker’s co-operative open to all, it made available film equipment, workspace, screenings and classes at little or no cost. Later he found himself teaching large classes of painfully docile students at St. John’s University in Jamaica, Queens.\n\nIn 1969, after a week’s guest seminar at Harpur College (now, Binghamton University), students petitioned the Administration to hire Ken Jacobs. Despite his lack of a high school diploma, the Administration – during that special period of anguish and possibility – decided that, as a teacher, he was “a natural.” Together with Larry Gottheim he organized the SUNY system’s first Department of Cinema, teaching thoughtful consideration of every kind of film but specializing in avant-garde cinema appreciation and production. (Department graduates are world-recognized as having an exceptional presence in this field.) His own early studies under Hofmann would increasingly figure in his film work, making for an Abstract Expressionist cinema, clearly evident in his avant-garde classic Tom, Tom, the Piper’s Son (1969) and increasingly so in his subsequent devising of the unique Nervous System series of live film-projection performances.\n\nThe Museum of The Moving Image in Astoria, Queens, hosted a full retrospective of his work in 1989, and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) held a partial retrospective in 1996, as did the American House in Paris in 1994 and the Arsenal Theater in Berlin in 1986 (during his 6-month stay as guest-recipient of Berlin’s DAAD award). He has also performed in Japan, at the Louvre in Paris, the Getty Center in Los Angeles, etc. Honors include the Maya Deren Award of the American Film Institute, the Guggenheim Award and a special Rockefeller Foundation grant. A 1999 interview with Ken Jacobs can be seen online as part of UC Berkeley’s series Conversations with History.\n\nSEPTEMBER 22 (THU.)\n\nKen Jacobs: In Conversation with Vincent Grenier\n\nOnline presentation\n\nFollowing the online screening on Tuesday, September 20, Ken Jacobs discusses his work with Vincent Grenier, artist and Professor Emeritus of Cinema, Binghamton University. Several excerpts of Jacobs’s work will also be shown, such as Flo Rounds a Corner (1999), Little Stabs at Happiness (1958-60), video documentation of Nervous Magic Lantern performances, and more.\n\nKEN JACOBS (See biography above)\n\nVINCENT GRENIER is a native of Quebec City, Canada. He has lived lrgely in the US, mostly New York City and upstate New York. In spite of this, he was a frequent contributor to the Montreal art scene of the ’70s and ’80s and the San Francisco bay areas where he received an MFA at the San Francisco Art Institute in the early ’70s. Grenier's experimental films have been shown in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan and China at showcases such as the Cineprobe at MoMA, Anthology Film Archives, Pacific Film Archive, the Collective for Living Cinema, Cinéma Parallèle in Montréal, Centre George Pompidou in Paris and MoCA Shanghai, among many others. His films and videos have earned him nine production grants from the Canada Council for the Arts between 1974 and 1992, and in New York State, from CAPS (1979), NYFA (1995), ETC (1992 & 1994) and NYSCA (2007). He is a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship (2010) and the Stan Brakhage Vision Award (2019).\n\nHe has made over two dozen films and, since the mid 90's, nearly as many videos. Many of his videos have been shown regularly at key experimental film festivals such as Views from the Avant-Garde of the New York Film Festival, the International Film Festival Rotterdam, Onion City Film Festival in Chicago and Media City Film Festival in Windsor, Ontario. Grenier's films and videos have been the subjects of retrospectives, more recently at the Denver Film Festival, the Cinémathèque québécoise, REDCAT, LA Film Forum, CalArts, Media City Film Festival and Images Festival's Canadian Images Spotlight. Seven of his films & videos were included in the Whitney Museum’s American Century 1970-2000 film programs.\n\nHis video Watercolor (2013) received first prizes in the experimental category at Black Maria Film Festival and Athens Film Festival. Les Chaises (2008) won a Jury’s Choice Award at Black Maria Film Festival and an Honorable Mention at Media City Film Festival. Tabula Rasa (2004) was screened in the program “Best Avant Garde Films & Videos of the Decade” at Lincoln Center’s Walter Reade Theater and won a second prize at Media City Film Festival. Here (2002) was awarded Gold for Best Experimental Film at the New York Expo of Short Film and Video. Color Study (2000) earned a second prize at the Black Maria Film Festival. Feet (1994) won a second prize at the Black Maria Festival and was shown in the WNET series Reel NY. His film Out in the Garden (1991) received the Best Documentary Award at Ann Arbor Film Festival and the Best Experimental Documentary Award at the Atlanta Film/Video Festival. It was also shown on WNET and at London Film Festival. Interieur Interiors (1978) was a second prize winner at the San Francisco Art Institute Film Festival, and World in Focus (1976) was a second prize winner at Ann Arbor Film Festival. Grenier’s films are included in the collections of the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO) in Toronto and many other institutions in Canada and the US.\n\nOCTOBER 6 (THU.)\n\nLori Felker: Recent Shorts 2016 – 2021\n\nIn-person presentation\n\nPROGRAM: Look Down & Find It (made with Julian Day, 13 min., 2021) / Memoria Data (12 min., 2018) / I Can’t (5 min., 2020) / Not You (10:41 min., 2020) / Discontinuity (15:33 min., 2016) / Spontaneous (13:53 min., 2020) TRT 70 min.\n\nLORI FELKER is a filmmaker, teacher, programmer, and performer.

Nominoë’s live projection performances have been presented in venues worldwide including the Pompidou Centre, the Serralvès Foundation in Porto, the International Film Festival Rotterdam, among others.\n\nNOVEMBER 22 (TUE.)\n\nIn Memoriam Jim Jennings\n\nJim Jennings passed away in May this year after a prolonged illness. Often considered the filmmakers’ filmmaker, Jennings made exquisite, often silent and black-and-white, 16mm films admired by many avant-garde masters and discerning critics.

A scripted drama of characters attempting to work towards political consensus – based partly on Asili’s own experiences in a Black liberationist group – weaves with a documentary recollection of the Philadelphia liberation group MOVE, the victim of a notorious police bombing in 1985. Ceaselessly finding commonalities between politics, humor and philosophy, with Black authors and radicals at its edges, The Inheritance is a remarkable film about the world as we know it. – Grasshopper Film\n\nEphraim Asili is a filmmaker, DJ, and Traveler whose work focuses on the African diaspora as a cultural force. His films have screened in festivals and venues all over the world, including the New York Film Festival; Toronto International Film Festival; Ann Arbor Film Festival; San Francisco International Film Festival; Milano Film Festival; International Film Festival Rotterdam; MoMA PS1; LAMOCA; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and the Whitney Museum of American Art. As a DJ, Asili can be heard on his radio program In the Cut on WGXC, or live at his monthly dance party Botanica. Asili currently resides in Hudson, NY, and is a professor in the Film and Electronic Arts Department at Bard College.\n\nwww.binghamton.edu/cinema/events/visiting-artists.html\n\nwww.facebook.com/CinemaBinghamtonU/\n\nContact: Melissa (Missy) Miller - Secretary\n\nEmail: mjmiller@binghamton.edu\n\nPhone: 607-777- 4998\n\nPast Visiting Artists/Speaker Series Events"
