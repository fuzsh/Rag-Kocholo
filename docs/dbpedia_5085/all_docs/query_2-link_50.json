        "text": "Konami’s Silent Hill game franchise is still going strong, with Silent Hill Downpour and Silent Hill HD Collections the most recent releases. The game series now officially has a film franchise, as well, thanks to the release of Open Road Films’ Silent Hill: Revelation 3D. The first film opened number one at the box office and made over $100 million worldwide back in 2006. The sequel is based on the Silent Hill 3 game.\n\nActors Radha Mitchell (Rose Da Silva) and Sean Bean (Christoper Da Silva) reprise their roles from the original film. New to the cast are Adelaide Clemens (Heather/Alessa), Kit Harington (Vincent), Carrie-Anne Moss (Claudia Wolf) and Malcolm Mcdowell (Leonard). New director Michael J. Bassett (Solomon Kane, Strike Back) is adding a third dimension to the terror this time around. The director and Clemens talk about the new video game adaptation in this exclusive interview below. Check out the additional video interviews from the red carpet premiere on this page as well.\n\nWhat’s a favorite video game memory from your gaming days?\n\nBassett: The single best gaming experience for me I played the first Unreal, the first person shooter. There’s a moment when the Skaarj warrior appears for the first time and I went, “Games can be like movies. I can get that kind of visceral experience. It’s true. It’s true.”\n\nWhat games did you play?\n\nBassett: I was a PC gamer rather than a console gamer. Alone in the Dark scared the crap out of me. But when it was just still like pixels moving around, The 7th Guest, The 11th Hour, those were good. Now more recently I think Heavy Rain is a really, really good game. I like God of War. I’d like to make that movie actually. If anyone’s watching, could I make God of War, please? I’m playing Silent Hill Downpour at the moment because I have no time. I’ve been away shooting. So I finally got the new Silent Hill game as well.\n\nHow did you work with the game developers on this film?\n\nBassett: We didn’t develop it with them, but what we did is when we first decided to make this movie, we talked with Konami and the games guys. We said we’re going to take your world and develop it and make something of it. I went to the Czech Republic, where they did the new game, to meet them and talk with them explain my idea about the film. We all figured it was the same world we were creating. So they said great and we went off and did our thing. They did their game. I did my movie.\n\nWhere does this fit into the whole mythology on the gaming side?\n\nBassett: This is a sequel to the movie, but it’s also an adaptation of game 3. We skip over game 2 and go to game 3 and we continue Health Mason and Sharon Da Silva’s story. We find out who she is and where she came from. She becomes a really feisty young heroine and we throw her into the action and have her kick some ass.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the strong female protagonists video games bring to Hollywood?\n\nClemens: As an actress it’s so exciting to see that. I think this is the most physical role I’ve ever played and you have to be so aware. What’s really amazing about how we shot the film is that a lot of the shots were constructed, so as an actor I felt like I was a gamer and you make a decision about where you’re going. You have to have that thought process that a lot of people have when they’re sitting at their game console. The physical challenge was the most exciting.\n\nBassett: Sorry for that. Run again. Fall over again. Run again.\n\nClemens: Just do it again! Yeah. And really getting in touch with my physical side.\n\nBassett: Yeah. Put the costume on, put a gun in her hand, and there’s a monster. Go kick his ass.\n\nWhat are some of the most twisted monsters you had to face off with in this movie?\n\nClemens: Red Pyramid was amazing. Claudia Wolf and I had the most incredible sequences. In this one we also had a mannequin monster.\n\nBassett: Oh, yeah the mannequin monster is pretty cool. I like the brain monster myself.\n\nClemens: Oh, my gosh.\n\nBassett: Yeah. The guy with like his skull opened up and all the skin and the brains exposed. Oh, that’s good stuff. That’s good stuff.\n\nClemens: You know that was just disgusting.\n\nBassett: There are lots of monsters. Go see the movie!"
