        "text": "I did not expect to watch a surreal-horror movie so well categorized coming from Russia. Maybe this could sound not polite and for this I apologize because this movie is incredibly well done.\n\nThe plot is about a very isolated town in the countryside where peoples are dyeing for a mysterious disease. Two sisters fight against this morbo that comes back in their lives after it harvested their mother. With the help of a mysterious priest they discover that the only way to fight this disease is entering in their own nightmares…literally.\n\nThe rhythm is slow, with long silences and static scenes. The photography is amazing and the town itself is like a creature full of hidden secrets. If the plot could remember the movie the Cell, the atmosphere is far more dark and disturbing.\n\nThe nightmarish sequences are intriguing and creepy, but somehow they lack for consistence and are too short. The movie is long and very diluited, for this reason I would appreciate more focus and effort inside the nightmares and their Silent Hillinian inhabitants.\n\nThe ending is a good twist and very intriguing. The scene painted in the end is more interesting then all the movie… But sadly it is just the end. I would like more history and background starting and not concluding in this ending scene.\n\nAnyway if you are looking for a dark and twisted movie, complicate and slow, but with a powerful surreal and creepy atmosphere, you could give to this dark Russian tale a try."
