        "text": "Silent Hill\n\nMovie Production Stills\n\nIn 2005, a few scenes for the action/horror movie were filmed at Alma College, which by that time had been almost completely gutted. We think these shots were taken inside the college -- see if you recognize the locations.\n\nOn the main staircase.\n\nCould be the front hall beside the drawing room, looking west.\n\nLooks like a bedroom door in Ivory Tower.\n\nProbably a bedroom hallway."
