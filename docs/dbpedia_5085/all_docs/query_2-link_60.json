        "text": "Somehow we missed this news from a few days back, but I wanted to write about it anyway. THR confirmed that screenwriter Roger Avary and producer Samuel Hadida of Davis Films would both be returning for the next Silent Hill sequel. I'm not sure if this is good news or bad. They trades are trying to play it off as good news, but will Avary actually write a script that doesn't suck this time? Or do they just need a better director than Christophe Gans to make sure it doesn't become another forgettable video game adaptation? Davis Films aims to shoot the movie next year after finishing Resident Evil 4, which they're now prepping.\n\nAvary last wrote Beowulf and won an Oscar for Pulp Fiction. The original, based on the Konami video game, centered on a woman who travels to a desolate town to seek help for her daughter only to find supernatural occurrences taking place there. That Silent Hill movie, which hit theaters in April of 2006, only grossed $47 million on a reported budget of $50 million, meaning it was pretty much a failure, considering its 30% on Rotten Tomatoes as well. We heard that a sequel was coming back in '06, but this is the first time they've taken any steps towards actually making it. But will Pyramid Head be back - that's what I want to know!"
