There’s an almost non-stop stream of laughter ringing through the halls. Kids are running around their classroom room pretending to be animals, falling on the ground, and getting up laughing. Trying out different characters and scenes and coming up with creative new ideas. The vibe in the room is one of pure fun. But, there’s more than just a good time going on, the kids are learning invaluable skills like how to take turns speaking in a group setting, how to collaborate with others, and most importantly, how to think on their feet!\n\nLearning Through Play\n\nOne of my favorite things about improv class is that it encourages children to learn through playing. Improv is a fun and engaging activity that inspires kids to be creative, spontaneous, and silly. Through theatre games and exercises, children can explore their imagination and, along the way, learn important life skills like communication and teamwork. Children may not even realize that they are learning while they are playing!\n\nBuilding Confidence\n\nImprov requires participants to think on their feet and be fearless in exploring new ideas. As kids become more comfortable with improvising, they will also become more confident in their ability to take risks and communicate their ideas clearly while still having an open mind. Improv class also teaches kids that their voice and ideas are worth sharing. Because they are learning to “Yes, and..” each other’s offers, shy kids are given room to come out of their shells, open up, and have a great time!\n\nDeveloping Positive Social Skills\n\nImprov, unlike stand-up comedy, is a social activity. It requires a group effort to create. Because of this, children learn to develop healthy social skills. They learn to actively listen to their peers and respond in a way that is supportive and collaborative. We’ve all seen it, sometimes someone at work likes to take over a project without regard for anyone else. On the flip-side there are people who are too shy or insecure to present their opinions/ideas to anyone but their diary. There’s a saying in improv: “Bring a brick, not a skyscraper.” This attitude encourages kids to bring their imagination to the group without completely taking over. It teaches them to contribute and communicate in a healthy way.\n\nCreative Problem Solving\n\nImprov exercises often require children to think “outside the box” and come up with creative solutions to problems. As children learn and practice the games in class, they will intuitively become more adept at solving problems in innovative ways.\n\nAdaptability and Teamwork\n\nImprov requires participants to be flexible and respond to surprises and changes in the moment. Kids learn to be adaptable in the face of unexpected situations, which will help them to navigate life’s challenges more effectively. Additionally, improvising characters and scenes requires teamwork and collaboration, which helps children learn to be respectful of others’ ideas and to work together towards a common goal.\n\nImprov is FUN!\n\nLet’s be honest, the world can be a confusing and scary place. Improv teaches us to be brave and how to have fun doing it! In improv class, kids get to play, explore, and be silly in an encouraging and supportive environment. Improv classes can be an excellent way for children to blow off steam, build new friendships, and find joy in being creative.\n\nGive your kid the gift of improv. Yes, and… sign me up in Chicago or Toronto!\n\nThe Second City is thrilled to announce the recipients of the 2023 SNL Scholarship. In partnership with Saturday Night Live, this scholarship will provide tuition-free training to diverse comedic talent from varying levels of experience.\n\nIn addition to receiving performance and writing training at The Second City Training Center, recipients will be connected to SNL talent executives and be able to submit an audition tape or sketch packet to SNL for the landmark show.\n\nThe following recipients were awarded scholarships and will begin their training with The Second City this March:\n\nMagdalena AL-Ghraibawi (she/her) “I’ll explain my name if I get the chance to, but for now you can just call Maggie! I’m a Muslim, Arab, woman of color who was born and raised in Vienna, Austria, a country that dislikes all of what I’ve just listed. Even though Vienna is a safe and affordable city that I both love and hate, I’m very excited to leave and move to the US. Currently, I’m studying to become a teacher, but I hope I’ll manage to make a living with comedy before I must face the responsibility of writing a bachelor’s thesis. With my comedy, I want to create a safe space for marginalized people; I want us to laugh and heal together while simultaneously educating people about social issues and I think the SNL DEI Scholarship offers me the perfect platform to do exactly that. I can’t put in words how thankful and honored I am about receiving this great opportunity and I’m excited to see what this journey has in store for me!”\n\nCaia Cammie (she/her) is 21 years old, raised between Kansas and Louisiana.

Liam’s love for television comedy, specifically sitcoms of the 1960’s, fuel his motivation to honor this frivolity in his work as well as in his overall approach to life. He is incredibly excited and sends a huge thank you to The Second City and Saturday Night Live for trusting him with this terrific opportunity. In his free time, an ideal day would include an iced coffee while browsing the “showbiz memoir” section of a used bookstore.\n\nVictoria Franso (she/her) is an Assyrian-American comedian and proud daughter of Iraqi immigrants. Shuffling between Chicago and Detroit, she has completed the improv programs at The Second City training center Chicago and Go Comedy! Improv Theater in Metro Detroit. Currently, she’s enrolled in Second City’s Conservatory and Go Comedy’s advanced improv program. She is also an understudy at Go Comedy. As a Saturday Night Live fan of about 15 years (ask her anything!), she considers this an opportunity of a lifetime and is incredibly grateful to The Second City. Victoria’s hope is to provide more leading roles for Middle Eastern women in comedy, as well as highlight the Assyrian experience both in the United States and in the homeland.\n\nAbout The Second City\n\nThe Second City opened as a small comedy cabaret in 1959 and has since become one of the most influential names in comedy.
