SILENT HILL: REVELATIONS started shooting in Toronto today with Adelaide Clemens (Pictured)(X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE) playing "Heather" and Kit Harington (GAME OF THRONES).

Word is that Sean Bean is circling the project too and is close to signing on to return, this time as "Harry".

Here is the movie's storyline:

For years, Heather Mason (Clemmons) and her father have been on the run, always one step ahead of dangerous forces that she doesnâ€™t fully understand. Now on the eve of her 18th birthday, plagued by terrifying nightmares and the disappearance of her father, Heather discovers she's not who she thinks she is. The revelation leads her deeper into a demonic world that threatens to trap her in Silent Hill forever.

Michael J. Bassett (SOLOMON KANE) is directing.

I simply loved the first movie - well the first two acts anyway. I think they lost the trail for the third act but the first two ensured I would add the movie to my collection for repeat viewings! The atmosphere is so very intense. I thought it was an outstanding video game adaptation.

I am hoping for more. Sean Bean returning means at least the script is half decent as he generally has good eyes for that. Follow all of our SILENT HILL coverage right here.
