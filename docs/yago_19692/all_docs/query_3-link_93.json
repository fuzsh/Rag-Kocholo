        "text": "The Beginning\n\nCorsicana was established in 1848 to serve as the seat of government for Navarro County, which the first Texas legislature had created two years earlier. The county was named after Jose Antonio Navarro, a Texas patriot. When asked what the new town should be called, Navarro replied, \"Call it Corsicana after the island of Corsica, the birthplace of my father.\" Corsicana was a typical post-Civil War cotton town in the black lands of northeast central Texas. The city first adopted its Home Rule Charter in 1917 and last amended in May 2007.\n\nOil Fields\n\nIn 1894, oil was discovered by accident only blocks from Corsicana's business district as drillers were completing an artisan well to expand the city's water supply. Within six years, 500 oil wells operating within the city limits were producing 800,000 barrels of crude annually, making Corsicana the site of the first commercial oil field in Texas. Today the more than 26,000 residents of Corsicana take great pride in their rich history.\n\n\"Firsts\" of Corsicana\n\nOther historic information concerning the many \"firsts\" taking place in Corsicana include:"
