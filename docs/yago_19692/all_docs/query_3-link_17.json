        "text": "Texas is home to many private and public colleges that appeal to students.\n\nA relatively low cost of living makes Texas a cheaper place to study and live.\n\nTexas is famous for its college athletics, food scene, and cultural diversity.\n\nA mild year-round climate makes Texas a great state for students who love the outdoors.\n\nChoosing the right college is an important decision for any student pursuing higher education. For certain learners, the location of a school is just as important as an institution's cost, academic offerings, and size. Certain places just feel right for certain people.\n\nFor many incoming college students, that place is Texas. Texas' vast size means that the state houses a variety of colleges, including large public university systems, historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), prestigious private institutions, and community colleges.\n\nAccording to the Education Data Initiative, more than 1.6 million students were enrolled in Texas colleges as of January 2021. Read on to find out why the state of Texas is such a popular place to live, work, and study.\n\nWhy Should I Study in Texas?\n\nClimate and Geography\n\nMany college students prefer to attend a school in a location with a mild climate. Colleges with year-round temperate weather allow students to explore the outdoors, participate in sports, and attend parties and concerts during every season. Students that attend schools that offer nice weather and shorter, milder winters may also be able to avoid seasonal affective disorder.\n\nAcross the state, Texas features a mild-to-warm climate, allowing students year-round access to outdoor activities. Texas has many geographical features, including mountains, prairies, beaches, deserts, and lakes. The diversity of Texas's natural beauty appeals to many students.\n\nAcademic Opportunities\n\nTexas features a variety of academic opportunities for students, including several large public university systems (the University of Texas, Texas A&M University, Texas State), prestigious private schools (Rice University), and HBCUs (Prairie View A&M University).\n\nThe state also houses several prominent community colleges that offer excellent academics and athletics. For example, Navarro College in Corsicana and Trinity Valley Community College in Athens were recently featured on Netflix's hit docuseries \"Cheer.\"\n\nNo matter what type of school they seek, students are likely to find a good academic fit somewhere in Texas.\n\nAffordable Living\n\nSeveral cities in Texas offer a lower cost of living that students can take advantage of after they graduate. For example, Houston's cost of living is 3.5 points below the national average, while San Antonio ranks 10.3 points below the national average. It is rare to have the opportunity to live in major cities at such low costs of living. As such, many graduates from Texas schools remain in the Lone Star State after college.\n\nDallas ranks 1.6 points above the national average for cost of living, while Austin ranks 19.3 points above the national average. These cities compensate for higher costs with plenty of job opportunities and cultural offerings. Austin is among the nation's best college towns.\n\nCultural Diversity\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Texas ranks as the fifth-most diverse state in the nation. This diversity allows students who attend college in Texas to benefit from a variety of perspectives and opportunities to share their culture with their peers. Because of this diversity, large universities throughout Texas also typically offer a variety of unique majors.\n\nTexas' proximity to Mexico means that many people in the state speak Spanish, and Mexican culture is a major influence throughout the state.\n\nOutdoor Recreation Activities\n\nBecause of the breadth of Texas' natural beauty, students throughout the state have the opportunity to pursue various outdoor recreational activities. Texas is home to beaches, mountains, lakes, and state and national parks, all of which are conducive to spending time outside.\n\nStudents in Texas can hike through mountains and parks, climb natural rock faces, wake surf along the coast, or raft down rivers. These areas also offer numerous opportunities for camping and backpacking.\n\nArts and History\n\nTexas maintains a deep, rich historical and artistic tradition. Major cities like Houston, Austin, Dallas, and San Antonio house public art museums, forts, and historic parks. Smaller towns also maintain unique traditions and historic landmarks for students to explore.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known piece of Texas history is the story of the Alamo, a pivotal event in the Texas Revolution. You can still visit the Alamo in San Antonio.\n\nFood Culture\n\nTexas's food culture is legendary across the nation. The state is famous for its barbecue, brought to the region by German and Czech immigrants during the 19th century. Today, different regions of Texas have their own distinct barbecue styles.\n\nMexican and Southwestern influences also lead to outstanding dishes like breakfast tacos, fajitas, and enchiladas. From Austin's food trucks to San Antonio's River Walk, Texas has a mouthwatering food destination for every student.\n\nSports\n\nTexas has a reputation for being obsessed with football, and indeed, many students passionate about supporting college athletics choose Texas for their numerous highly-ranked football programs. The Dallas Cowboys, college teams, and major high school teams throughout the state receive fervent support from their fan bases.\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University feature college football teams that draw tens of thousands of fans every fall Saturday.
