        "text": "What else do I need to create PDF documents using LaTeX? In addition to above style files you need the following components:\n\nA LaTeX distribution for your platform, e.g. MikTeX 2.3 or higher (for Windows), TeTeX 1.0.7 or higher (for Linux and other *nix flavors) and OzTeX 5.1 or higher (for Mac). Make sure that your installation uses Type 1 fonts. Earlier versions of LaTeX used Type 3 or Bitmapped fonts. These are not scalable (i.e. render well on screen as well as print). The paper submission system checks for fonts used and if it detects Type 3 fonts, the paper cannot be uploaded. We cannot assist with installation of these packages on your system, however, they all come with extensive installation notes.\n\nOne of the following\n\nGhostscript 7.0.4 or higher (Windows and Linux/Unix)\n\nGSview 4.6 or higher together with the recommended version of Ghostscript (Windows)\n\nAdobe Distiller 6 or higher (Windows). This comes with Adobe Acrobat Standard or Professional 6 or higher.\n\nOzTeX (Mac)\n\nOptions 1 and 2 are high quality open source software and widely in use. Adobe Distiller is a commercial product. There are several other products (free or commercial) in the market that can produce compatible PDF files. However, there is no support available for them through these pages.\n\nSome distributions of LaTeX (e.g. MikTeX) come bundled with pdfTeX that can directly create PDF files from TeX source. However, this will require that you have all graphics/images of your document available in PDF format. It cannot convert encapsulated postscript to PDF. Its use requires minor modifications to the LaTeX source file and the details for that appear in pdfTeX documentation and are not repeated here.\n\nHow do I create compliant PDFs from LaTeX source? Assuming that you have a LaTeX distribution for your platform with \"Type 1\" fonts installed, use one of the following options:\n\nUse the command lines\n\nlatex sample dvips -Ppdf -G0 -tletter sample ps2pdf -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dMAxSubsetPct=100 -dSubsetFonts=true -dEmbedAllFonts=true -sPAPERSIZE=letter sample.ps sample.pdf\n\nThe ps2pdf command should go on a single line. To obtain A4 paper size output the commands are very similar\n\nlatex a4sample dvips -Ppdf -G0 -ta4 a4sample ps2pdf -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dMAxSubsetPct=100 -dSubsetFonts=true -dEmbedAllFonts=true -sPAPERSIZE=a4 a4sample.ps a4sample.pdf\n\nThese instructions have been tested under Linux with teTeX 1.0.7 and Ghostscript 7.0.4, and more recently with teTeX 3.0 and Ghostscript 8.15.\n\nWithout -d[options] listed above, ps2pdf will not embed and subset fonts as required by PDF compliance and your paper will not be ready for upload. Note that if you specify the Adobe Times, Helvetica and Courier font families (the so-called base 14 fonts) to be used but do not have them installed on your computer then they will not be embedded. Pdf files with these fonts missing may or may not be accepted depending on the conference settings; they often are.\n\nDo not omit the target paper size in each step as your system may have a default paper size setting that differs from the target paper size.\n\nUnder Windows with MikTeX and Ghostscript the third line\n\nps2pdf -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dMAxSubsetPct=100 -dSubsetFonts=true -dEmbedAllFonts=true -sPAPERSIZE=letter sample.ps sample.pdf\n\nfails while producing an incomprehensible error message. This is because under Windows ps2pdf is implemented as a batch file which does not allow the character = to be used. In this case modify the command to\n\nps2pdf -dCompatibilityLevel#1.4 -dMAxSubsetPct#100 -dSubsetFonts#true -dEmbedAllFonts#true -sPAPERSIZE#letter sample.ps sample.pdf\n\nand it will work like a charm.\n\nThis was tested with MiKTeX 2.3 and Ghostscript 7.04 and more recently wth MikTeK 2.8 and Ghostscript 8.6.\n\nIf you are using Windows, we strongly recommend using GSview, a graphical font end to Ghostscript, to convert your postscript file to pdf. It provides an easy interface for setting up the above parameters for ps2pdf.\n\nFollow the steps of the previous item to generate a postscript file from your LaTeX source file. Open the postscript file in GSView.\n\nThe first step is to set the media size to Letter. To do this, in the GSview menubar at the top click on \"Media\" and select Letter as shown below:\n\nNext, click on \"File | Convert\". In the ensuing window, in Options textbox type in \"-dMAxSubsetPct=100\", then follow screenshots below:\n\nThis option makes sure that the files will be viewable by readers with Acrobat Reader 5 and later.\n\nThese two settings, together with \"-dMAxSubsetPct=100\" will ensure that all fonts are embedded as required.\n\nTo produce PDF that will print well on paper as well as look sharp on the screen you must have Type 1 fonts installed with your LaTeX distribution. To create PDF, use the following steps\n\nlatex [a4]sample (if needed use also bibTeX and rerun LaTeX) dvips -Ppdf -G0 -tletter sample (for letter sized document) dvips -Ppdf -G0 -ta4 a4sample (for A4 sized document)\n\nThis generates the postscript file \"sample.ps\". Next, launch Adobe distiller. Here are the screen captures of settings in Distiller 5.0, similar settings also exist on other Distiller releases.\n\nIn the distiller select Settings | Job Options as shown in the first image -\n\nNext, under \"General\" tab, set paper size to Letter (8.5\"x11\") as shown in the circled part of the image\n\nNext, click on the \"Fonts\" tab and enable font embedding as shown in the third figure.\n\nYou may want to save this setting as (say) a joboption CSSconferences and you can reuse it for future conferences.\n\nAlternatively, you may load the IEEE joboptions and it will set up suitable options.\n\nImportant: If you are setting up joboptions on your own, make sure that the PDF compatibility is set to \"Acrobat 5.0 (PDF 1.4)\".\n\nIEEE will not accept papers with PDF 1.2 or 1.3 compatibility.\n\nPDFLaTeX is a special version of LaTeX by Han The Thanh which produces PDF output directly using Type-1 fonts instead of the standard dvi file. However, it is still in beta version and does not accept all of the LaTeX packages or postscript figures.\n\nFor this path you must convert all of your postscript figures to pdf. This can be done by \"epstopdf\" or Adobe's Acrobat distiller. In addition, you have to change your TeX-file, at minimum to include the .pdf-graphics.\n\nIf you start a new document from scratch, intended to get a PDF, this path is the first choice, although pdfLaTeX is still in \"beta-state\"\n\nLaTeX and pdfLaTeX behave by default differently concerning the character-spacing. As a result, the same TeX-File compiled with LaTeX and pdfLaTeX may show different line-breaks, paragraphs, page-breaks etc. Fortunately, there is a switch in pdfLaTeX to ensure LaTeX spacing.\n\npdfLaTeX uses per default Type-1 fonts.\n\nUsing OzTeX (Mac)\n\nIf you are using a Mac system with OS 8.6 or lower, you will need to use OzTeX 4.1 - then you have to make sure that you have Type 1 fonts installed since the installation comes with Type 3 fonts. Else, download and install the latest version OzTeX that comes standard with Type 1 CM and AMS fonts.\n\nDownload the Mac version of ieeeconf.cls with appropriate carriage returns. Some users have experienced difficulty converting the windows version to Mac leading to compilation problems.\n\nAdd the following lines to your \"Add Outline Fonts\" config file:\n\npaper_width = 8.5in paper_height = 11in\n\nIn Oztex 5.1, use the \"Add Outline Fonts\" config.\n\nFinally, when you dvips, the options -CMPS should automatically pop-up. Leave it alone.\n\nOzTeX hints and images courtesy of Brad Burchett."
