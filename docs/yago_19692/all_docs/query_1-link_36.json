If you are looking for the trailer featuring Tex, click here.\n\nTex the Robot (Tex for short), created and voiced by former Pixar employee John Lasseter, is the mascot of THX. First appearing with the premiere of Independence Day in 1996, he was originally seen exclusively in front of Pixar movies, but he has appeared on more recent trailers like Genesis.\n\nAppearance\n\nTex is a flying robot built to function and look like a handyman. He has:\n\nA silver head with two gray ears (the left one having a silver-balled antenna), a mustache, and no visible eyes.\n\nA red and silver body with an orange (or red) button and a vent that is either three lines or twelve dots, two gray claw-hands (or gray WALL-E-esque robotic hands sometimes), and conveyor belt-like feet.\n\nA jet-pack with a checkered pattern near the center of it, activated by the button on his body, which the jet-pack emits green dilating/contracting circles.\n\nOn top of all that, he usually sports a tool belt and a red hat (with the company's logo on said hat only being shown on their stress doll merchandise).\n\nHistory\n\nTex has been the mascot for THX since his first appearance in 1996. He has appears in a few of the company's logos throughout the years, usually featuring him repairing the logo.\n\nTex made his first appearance in the trailer of the same name, which debuted on July 3, 1996 with the original theatrical release of Independence Day.
