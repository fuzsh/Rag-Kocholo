        "text": "At Texas A&M, we have over 1300 active organizations. However, we always have room for more if you aren’t able to find an existing organization that fits your needs and interests. All new organizations must complete an application process before being officially recognized to operate on campus, so before you get started, please remember the following:\n\nWe receive many New Student Organization applications each semester. Because we want to thoroughly equip each organization’s leadership with the knowledge and skills they’ll need to be successful, the University-recognition process takes around 6-8 weeks.\n\nAll organizations must meet the following basic criteria to advance in the recognition process:\n\n– All recognized student organizations must have at least two student leaders and a university advisor. See pp. 9-14 of the Student Organization Manual for details on each role.\n\n– New student organizations must have a unique mission and vision that is distinct from those of other recognized student organizations. Use the MaroonLink Student Organization Search page to browse through existing recognized student organizations. If you see a similar organization, don’t hesitate to reach out to them to see if you can join their efforts!\n\nIf you have additional questions or want to learn more about recognized student organizations at Texas A&M, contact the Student Organization Leadership And Development area at (979) 458-4371 or [email protected].\n\nCLASSIFICATIONS\n\nEvery recognized A&M organization is given a classification which not only helps us organize you into areas of common mission or purpose, but it also makes finding you a lot easier for students who are looking to get involved. Our current classifications include:"
