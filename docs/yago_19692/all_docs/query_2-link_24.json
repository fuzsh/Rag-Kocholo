        "text": "Built for Texas: Creating a More Connected & Resourced Future for our Nonprofit Sector\n\nOctober 2023\n\nThe 2023 edition of Built for Texas: Creating a More Connected & Resourced Future for our Nonprofit Sector explores the continued growth of the state’s nonprofit sector and the importance of collaboration amid increasingly limited resources.\n\nWe believe that a robust nonprofit sector is essential for strong and vibrant communities. For all participants in the social impact ecosystem—whether donors, nonprofit professionals, lawmakers, or funders—we are asking the question, “How can I continue to help the communities I care about in an era of rapid change?”\n\nThis publication is our answer and, we hope, a guide for you. The report is presented in three parts: an executive summary featuring high-level insights, a deeper dive into findings, and tools and suggested actions by audience.\n\nCorrection: The data in the Where are Texas Nonprofits? graphic displayed in the Built For Texas report and toolkit were updated as of March 2024. Past versions of the report and toolkit contained a graphic with incorrect 2022 data.\n\nBuilt for Texas: The Impact and Opportunity of Our Nonprofit Sector\n\nNovember 2019\n\nThe report Built for Texas: The Impact and Opportunity of Our Nonprofit Sector serves as a vehicle to unite, rally, and strongly articulate the added value—as well as the capacity limitations—of the overall sector. The data and findings in Built for Texas contribute to a fuller, more informed understanding of the nonprofit sector in Texas and its contribution to the state’s economy. Built for Texas incorporates simple yet specific calls to action to magnify the contributions and potential of Texas nonprofits.\n\nSummarized below are key report findings, each paired with a case for underscoring why the said finding matters. This structure is intended to provoke discussion on the value and current capacity of Texas nonprofits."
