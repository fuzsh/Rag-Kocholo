        "text": "Just north of Dallas and slightly to the west of our own Sandbrock Ranch is the much-adored little town of Aubrey, Texas. Those who already call Sandbrock Ranch home are aware of everything this beloved little town has to offer, but if you’re unfamiliar with the area or if you’re doing research prior to making a move to Texas, you may be wondering about things to do in Aubrey Texas and what our favorite small town is known for. Since we consider ourselves to be unofficial experts on the subject, we thought we would help fill in a few details!\n\nWhat is Aubrey, Texas Known For?\n\nLocated in northeast Denton County, the city of Aubrey was officially founded in 1867. If that sounds like a long time ago, it was! For historical reference, that was the year that the United States agreed to purchase the territory of Alaska.\n\nSince then, Aubrey has been the quintessential small Texas town, and it’s one that everyone should get a chance to visit if they’re craving the true small-town experience. We’ve often said that Aubrey, Texas is one of the best kept secrets in the state, but the population is growing steadily, which means that people are definitely catching on to this hidden gem in northeast Texas.\n\nWhat is Aubrey, Texas known for? Aubrey, Texas, shining with Texas charm, is often referred to as “the horse capital of Texas” because of the town’s moderate climate, top-tier soil, and beautiful surroundings. It offers ideal conditions for horse breeding, making it a rancher’s slice of heaven.\n\nIt’s everyone’s favorite small town because it’s family friendly with plenty of public schools, affordable housing, and a close proximity to neighboring Texas towns such as Frisco, Prosper, and Denton. There’s always a lot to do in Aubrey, and folks around here like to stay active. In fact, the city topped a list of the 10 Healthiest Neighborhoods put together by the Dallas Morning News in both 2014 and 2015!\n\nThings to do in Aubrey Texas\n\nYour small-town adventure begins in historic downtown Aubrey, an iconic piece of Americana. Main Street is home to a host of unique local businesses, a city park, city hall, and a number of historically preserved churches and buildings, some of which date back nearly as far as the town’s founding. Driving down Aubrey’s Main Street feels like taking a trip back in time.\n\nIf you’re looking to grab a bite to eat while you’re in Aubrey, you’ll find plenty of delicious options. Locals will tell you that Aubrey, Texas is known for World Famous Moms, a hometown institution that has been cooking up tasty experiences for more than 15 years. World Famous Moms is known for some of the best chicken-fried steak you’ve ever tasted as well as world-famous chocolate cake. No trip to Aubrey, Texas is complete without a visit.\n\nIf you’re searching for a tasty treat, you can’t go wrong with Ruby Cates Bake Shop, formerly known as Nancy Cates Bake Shop. This is another local favorite, and it’s where you’ll find fresh-baked cookies that are out of this world alongside plenty of other unforgettable delights such as coffee and fresh-squeezed lemonade!\n\nIs wine-tasting more your thing? You’re in luck. You can sample some amazing local wines from right here in Texas at the Fortunata Winery. It’s a great place to relax and enjoy fine wine, wood-fired pizzas, live music, and more!\n\nWhile there’s plenty to do in Aubrey year-round, what small town would be complete without a small-town festival and some seasonal activities? In Aubrey, the first Saturday in October is the Aubrey Peanut Festival, a celebration of our locally grown peanuts and Aubrey’s fascinating history! The festival dates back to 1986 and is hosted by the non-profit organization Keep Aubrey Beautiful.\n\nThe Keep Aubrey Beautiful organization also hosts a free Music in the Park concert series in May where residents and visitors gather in the park on blankets and lawn chairs to listen to artists from all over the Texas music scene. When the holiday season rolls around, there’s the annual Aubrey Hometown Christmas Tree Lighting on the first Thursday in December. We light up the town’s Christmas tree on South Main, and a wide array of holiday-themed events accompany the big moment, including a visit from Santa Claus himself.\n\nThe adventure doesn’t have to stop at the city limits! Aubrey’s close proximity to Lake Ray Roberts, Lake Lewisville, and the Greenbelt makes it a great place to live for those who love the great outdoors. Any of those destinations make perfect weekend excursions, whether you want to take the boat out for a spin, toss a line in the water, or just hike around and look at some of our beautiful native wildflowers.\n\nIn fact, there’s so much to do in and around Aubrey that one trip is never going to be enough. Once you come visit, grab a bite at World Famous Moms or a cookie from Ruby Cates, take in a concert or just drive down Main Street, you’ll never want to leave. We know just how you feel!\n\nAubrey is a great little Texas town that’s becoming better known ever day, and we’re thrilled to be in close proximity to this unique Texas gem here at Sandbrock Ranch. All the things that make Ranch living so appealing are also traits that Aubrey, Texas shares, and we couldn’t ask for a better neighbor. Want to start enjoying the “Live True” lifestyle and see what Texas living is all about? Come visit Sandbrock Ranch today and, while you’re here, stop by Aubrey, too!"
