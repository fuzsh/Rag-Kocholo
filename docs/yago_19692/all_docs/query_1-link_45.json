        "text": "Nearly 140 years ago, The University of Texas at Austin opened with one building, eight professors, and 221 students. Today, UT ranks among the top 40 universities in the world. It is both a community — more than 51,000 students in 18 colleges and schools, their teachers, researchers and staff — and a nation, Longhorn Nation, with a global network of nearly half a million alumni.\n\nThe story of that transformation can be summed up in six turning points that made us who we are...\n\nIn September 1883, The University of Texas was officially opened in a ceremony inside an incomplete building on a grassy hill where the Tower now stands. Classes that semester were held in the temporary Capitol, a three-story building on Congress Avenue housing state government while the current Capitol was under construction. The following January, students reported to the campus and its one building, a ghost of history now known as Old Main.\n\nGiving further shape to this constitutional mandate, by 1905 the university had adopted a motto — the Latin words “Disciplina, Praesidium, Civitatis.” These were meant to capture a famous sentiment of Texian president Mirabeau B. Lamar: “A cultivated mind is the guardian genius of democracy.”\n\nTying education to the fortunes of our democracy was the premise of the university from the earliest years. Even the Texas Declaration of Independence in 1836 claimed “...it is an axiom in political science that, unless a People are educated and enlightened, it is idle to expect the continuance of civil liberty, or the capacity for self-government.”\n\nThis spirit of public service and leadership can be seen in the biographies of alumni like Sam Rayburn, the longest-serving speaker of the House in U.S. history, and numerous governors and cabinet officials. It is seen in the establishment of the LBJ School of Public Affairs, the Strauss Center for International Law, the Clements Center for National Security, and three ROTC programs.\n\nUT might have been built on high ideals and aspirations, but ideals don’t pay for professors or for buildings; money does. In 1882, at a ceremony to lay cornerstone for the university, Ashbel Smith, first chairman of the Board of Regents, said, “Smite the rocks with the rod of knowledge, and fountains of unstinted wealth will gush forth.”\n\nThose rocks were smitten May 28, 1923, when an oil rig named Santa Rita No. 1 “came in” on West Texas land the state had set aside to help fund education, spraying oil over a 250-yard area around the well. A new day had dawned for the university.\n\nBecause the fund treated oil profits as principal rather than income, the proceeds from Santa Rita and other wells were reinvested instead of being spent, and by 1925 the Permanent University Fund was growing by more than $2,000 a day. It is no coincidence that during the 1920s and 1930s, 23 buildings went up to create the core of the campus, including UT’s most famous, the Tower.\n\nUT’s earliest faculty leaders had gambled that a move to Texas, then little more than a wilderness, would be good. By the early-to-mid 20th century, the campus was roamed by intellectual giants like historian Walter Webb, folklorists J. Frank Dobie and Americo Paredes, and Nobel laureate biologist Hermann Muller.\n\nIn 1929, the Association of American Universities confirmed that UT was indeed a university of the first class when the AAU invited UT into membership. In Texas, only three universities are AAU members, and UT was the first by more than 50 years.\n\nSince then, Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, Maya scholar Linda Schele, and Nobel laureates physicist Steven Weinberg and chemist Ilya Prigogine have further burnished the UT faculty’s global reputation.\n\nToday, UT receives about $800 million a year for research, much of it from federal sources, led by the Department of Defense. UT does “big science.” It has built some of the world’s fastest computers and is a charter member of a consortium building the world’s largest telescope.\n\nIn 1950, no flagship university in the former Confederacy admitted black students. That year, the lawsuit of a postman who wanted to earn a law degree at Texas worked its way to the Supreme Court. UT fought integration, but Heman Sweatt prevailed and became the university’s first black student. Sweatt v. Painter became the critical precedent to the Brown case, which finally ended the fallacy of “separate but equal” and began in earnest the slow process of integration.\n\nTwice in the years since Sweatt, UT has gone to bat for the right of universities to affirmatively consider race in admissions. In both the Hopwood case in the 1990s and the Fisher case in the 2010s, the university argued that racial diversity benefited all students, and the Supreme Court agreed.\n\nBecause of this history of segregation, UT understands the profound benefits of creating an inclusive environment in which students can learn from one another. The educational benefits of learning on a diverse campus prepare all students to succeed in an increasingly diverse state and interconnected society.\n\nThe year 1963 marked the first time two very different men who made a gigantic impact on the university’s modern character both were in power: Harry Ransom and Frank Erwin.\n\nHarry Ransom came to UT in 1935 to teach English, rose through the ranks, and in 1960 was appointed president, then chancellor of the UT System.\n\nThe erudite Ransom had an audacious vision for what the university should be academically, including being a center for globally important cultural holdings like the Gutenberg Bible now housed in the humanities research center that bears his name.\n\nFrom the time Frank Erwin was named a regent in 1963 until his death in 1983, UT essentially became the university we see today.\n\nIts student population rose from 22,000 to 41,500. Its legislative appropriations rose from $16 million to $100 million, and the campus completed 55 major building projects. Erwin accomplished this transformation through ceaseless work but also powerful connections to the Governor’s Mansion and the White House.\n\nErwin was viewed by some as heavy handed and remains a polarizing figure to this day, but his influence on the university might never been matched."
