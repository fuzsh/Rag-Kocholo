They have been updated by him for his 2021 tune-up of TeX and Metafont. The dist/ subdirectory contains the files that he considers part of the official TeX system. The local/ subdirectory, on the other hand, contains some supplementary files written by him (which are mostly copied into the main TeX distributions), as well as old versions of files created by other people, parts of an old Unix TeX installation, derived files, and other miscellany. Don't take the conglomeration too seriously. For more links, see https://ctan.org/pkg/knuth-dist."
