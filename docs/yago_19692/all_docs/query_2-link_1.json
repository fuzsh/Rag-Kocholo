        "text": "Andries Lenstra: Why didn't you start from troff? It was completely inappropriate?\n\nDonald Knuth: Yes, yes. You see, troff was patched on top of ... I mean, there was a whole system, it was a fifth generation, each of which was a patch on another one. So it was time to scrap it and start all over again: \"Here's what the language should be, so let's design some good data structures for it.\" Not \"Let's try to be compatible.\" I had the advantage that I was not at Bell Labs, where I wouldn't be hurting anybody's feelings by saying, \"Let's throw it all away.\" [laughter] It was impossible for the people at Bell Labs to do such a thing -- it wouldn't be nice. But it occurred to me that now that we had proof that this goal was possible, I should start over, and rethink how I could get from input to output, so the program could be much more unified, much smaller, and would also work. I mean, troff was collapsing all the time. A lot of the earliest users of TeX had been frustrated by troff breaking over and over again, so it had gotten unwieldy. But it had also proved that there was light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nI also had to scrap TeX, you know, and start over again; after five years, I decided that it would be best to go back and re-do the program. But it would have been very hard to do that if my friend in the next office had done it. [laughter] So, I just have this philosophy that there will be always some people who are more interested in quality than others, and I wanted to make TeX good for them. I don't see any good way to make it impossible to make a bad document, unless you have only a system with a small menu of options; that's good for a large class of users, to make a system that's so simple that you can't possible do anything ugly in it."
