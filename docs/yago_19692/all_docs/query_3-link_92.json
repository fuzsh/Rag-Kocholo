        "text": "Located sixty-seven miles north of Austin and thirty-six miles south of Waco lies Temple, Texas. With a 2020 population of approximately 82,987, Temple is the 48th largest city in Texas, according to World Population Review. Temple has continued to experience economic prosperity on account of being a healthcare industry hub / medical center leader.\n\nIts central location in Texas not only is beneficial for the medical community, but goods distribution to nearby metropolitan areas like Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas-Fort Worth. While Temple has grown exponentially within the past 100 years, Temple was not always the booming corporate workforce it is today. By understanding the rich history of Temple, Texas, we can appreciate the hard work and growth it took as a community to become the city it is today.\n\nTemple Then\n\nIn 1881, Temple was founded as a railroad town, attracting a diverse population from all around. After being incorporated in 1882, the town was named Temple after the Santa Fe Railroad Official, Bernard Moore Temple. As railroad workers increased, post offices and railroad shops were established in the area. This development created opportunity for economic growth, therefore, bringing more people to Temple.\n\nWithin ten years of being founded, the Santa Fe Hospital was established, thus, creating more economic prosperity for the newly established city. The city of Temple underwent a rapid city expansion after more medical jobs were created through establishment of the King’s Daughters Hospital and Scott and White Hospital. While the city’s growth was shortly suspended during the Great Depression, Temple was able to recover through the addition of a new Veterans hospital.\n\nThis hospital was especially important to the city’s recovery since Temple was located close in proximity to Fort Worth. Temple, back then, grew in ways to not only create economic prosperity, but to provide prosperity for its community. The people of Temple have always been the main priority.\n\nTemple Today\n\nWhile the Temple economy may have started with the Santa Fe Hospital, it has not limited its economy to exclusively medicine. Though a diverse economy of agriculture, transportation, manufacturing, and medicine, Temple has managed to consistently grow economically and in population.\n\nOver 100 years of economic growth has allowed Temple to contribute to Texas’ high-speed rail operation and three major hospitals. Temple continues to prosper as it adds an impressive number of regional distribution centers and headquarters to the city. Companies like Wilsonart International and McLane Company, Temple Bottling Company, and Texas Hydraulics Inc. have contributed to maintaining the continual economic growth Temple keeps today. In the same manner of Temple 100 years ago, the city still maintains its determined and hard-working ethic that makes Temple successful.\n\nNotable People from Temple\n\nAlthough Temple, TX is not a large city, it still has birthed or been the home of many notable people who have contributed to U.S. society and culture.\n\nJ.
