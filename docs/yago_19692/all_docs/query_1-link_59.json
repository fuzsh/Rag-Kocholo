        "text": "Robert W. Gore invented a new form of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) widely known by the GORE-TEX® brand name. This highly porous yet very strong material is chemically inert, functions within a wide range of temperatures, and is weatherproof. Valued by outdoor enthusiasts as durable, wind-resistant, waterproof and breathable, GORE-TEX® materials have also found applications in hundreds of medical, industrial, electrical and textile products.\n\nBorn in Salt Lake City, Utah, Gore pursued his undergraduate degree at the University of Delaware. As a college sophomore in 1957, he discovered a way to use PTFE tape to insulate wires and cables. In a 1969 experiment, Gore rapidly stretched heated rods of PTFE and created expanded PTFE, which was given the GORE-TEX® brand name.\n\nGore completed his graduate studies at the University of Minnesota, earning an M.S. and a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering. He spent his career at W. L. Gore & Associates, the company founded by his parents to develop PTFE-insulated cable based upon his first invention. In his tenure as president from 1976 to 2000, he guided the company from a wire and cable manufacturer into a diverse billion-dollar enterprise. He also served as chairman of the company's board of directors."
