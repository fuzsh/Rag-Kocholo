        "text": "What is Texas known for?\n\nAre you a “born and raised” Texan? Have you lived here for so long that you feel like you are one of them?\n\nOr are you new and you feel like you wanted to be part of the club?\n\nWell, you can start by experiencing some uniquely Texan things, and we are here with a list of a few of them.\n\nMore: Which are the Best Places to Visit in Texas?\n\nTexas BBQ\n\nBarbecue (or BBQ) is a tradition that runs deep in the Lone Star State! Yes… you can’t visit Texas without trying some of the BBQ here, and honestly, you wouldn’t want to miss it either.\n\nTexas BBQ is more than just grilling, smoking or slow-cooking meat on charcoal or wood; it is about weekends hanging out with family and friends, a celebration of life that is passed down generations along with other family traditions.\n\nIt is a Texan pride as eateries compete to be known as the Best BBQ in Texas.\n\nWhataburger\n\nTexas is famous for Whataburger. Have you tried it yet? You better go and grab some.\n\nWhataburger is Texas’s very own burger chain and most of the local’s favorite. The doors of the first restaurant opened in 1950 in Corpus Christi, and the chain has expanded across the country.\n\nThe standard Texas Whataburger is made with mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, and diced onions on a toasted five-inch bun.\n\nHowever, the best thing about Whataburger is that you can order a burger any way you like it.\n\nBuccees\n\nRoad tripping in Texas can be fun, especially when you see a sign with the iconic cartoon beaver on it. It has to be Buc-ee’s!\n\nIt’s a great place to stop to stretch your legs and get some snacks, food, drinks, and trinkets while gassing up.\n\nBilly Bob’s Texas\n\nIt is iconic and the largest country music honky-tonk with 100,000 square feet of indoor space which has a rodeo arena, mechanical bulls, and dozens of bars.\n\nIt is a perfect place for a night out with family and friends.\n\nTexas Nachos\n\nIf you’re planning to try some Tex Mex food, you’ll be offered some Texas nachos.\n\nA Texas tradition of freshly fried chips evenly laid down, topped with a pickled jalapeño slice and cheese from Longhorns (Texas longhorn is a breed of cattle that are decendents from cattle brought over by Christopher Columbus and Spanish settlers in the late 1400’s).\n\nRound Rock Donuts at Round Rock, TX\n\nPeople around the world have been stopping by this donuts store in Round Rock, TX to try their famous orange donuts.\n\nWhile you are at it, why not try their Texas-sized donut that you can share or eat it all for yourself?!\n\nDrink Shiner Bock\n\nThis local beer has been brewed at the Spoetzl Brewery in Shiner, TX since 1909.\n\nState Fair of Texas\n\nYou must go to the State Fair of Texas even once in your life.\n\nIt’s the largest State Fair in the nation. It is for the whole family; there are many fun activities for kids and adults.\n\nThe food scene at the State Fair is the most interesting one, and you should be looking forward to it.\n\nEverything is deep fried!\n\nThe Schlitterbahn Water Park\n\nEverything is big in Texas, and so is the Schlitterbahn Waterpark.\n\nIf you’re looking for a weekend water fun getaway with the whole family, then look no further.\n\nThe Schlitterbahn’s New Braunfels location has been recognized as the world’s best water park for 21 straight years.\n\nFloating a River\n\nRiver floating in an inner tube is a popular outdoor adventure in Texas.\n\nWith its blazing heat during summer months, this is a great way to cool off.\n\nThere are many rivers around, but the most popular ones are the Guadalupe river, the Frio River, the Trinity River, the San Marcos, and the Komal River.\n\nBluebonnets\n\nThe Bluebonnet is Texas’ State flower, and it blooms during springtime all over the state. When they are in bloom, act fast because they don’t last long.\n\nIt’s most Texans’ favorite time of the year to do some annual family photo shoot with bluebonnets around, for sure. It is truly magical!\n\nThe Czech Stop\n\nThe best kolaches you could ever find outside of the Czech Republic can be found here.\n\nThis Little Czech Bakery has been promoting that Czech heritage and spirit in a small town of West, Texas. You HAVE to stop and try their kolaches!\n\nTexas Chili\n\nChili is the official State food of Texas. Authentic Texas chili doesn’t have beans in it; it should be made of meat and chilies.\n\nApparently, each year on the first Saturday of November, the Chili Appreciation Society International (CASI) holds the ultimate celebration of Chili.\n\nThis year’s 53rd renewal of the granddaddy of all chili cook-offs and food festivals will be held at Rancho CASI de los Chisos in Terlingua, Texas.\n\nRancho CASI is located on the north side of Highway 170, eleven miles west of Study Butte and seven miles east of Lajitas.\n\nChicken-Fried Steak\n\nWhat is Texas known for? There is zero chicken in this dish!\n\nIt is a cutlet of tenderized beef, battered and fried in a skillet until crisp (like would do with fried chicken, hence the name). It is a Texan staple and is typically served with mashed potatoes with cream gravy.\n\nBreakfast Tacos\n\nTacos for breakfast? Why not? It is a breakfast item found in most restaurants in Texas.\n\nHowever, it can also be easily made at home as it is basically tortillas filled with potatoes, crispy bacon, soft scrambled eggs, and all the toppings!\n\nBlue Bell Ice Cream\n\nNo Texas summer is complete without Blue Bell ice cream!\n\nThe Blue Bell Creamery started in Brenham, Texas in 1907 and has been a Texas pride and joy.\n\nTry their newest flavor, called Cookie Cake – it’s a sweet cream ice cream loaded with chocolate chip cookie crumbles, cake pieces, and swirls of chocolate and vanilla icing. Yum!\n\nFort Worth Stockyards\n\nThis place is truly a MUST when you visit the Fort Worth area.\n\nThe Fort Worth Stockyard is at Fort Worth’s National Historic District, and it offers an authentic glimpse of the American West and cowboy culture. You can start your day watching cattle drive by the Fort Worth Herd.\n\nYou will see Texas cowhands drive a herd of Texas longhorns down East Exchange Avenue.\n\nAlso, you can explore the city after and end your day watching a rodeo then have some fun line dancing at Billy Bob’s Texas.\n\nBats in Austin\n\nAustin is famous for the food scene, the University of Texas, outdoor activities, and musicians performing; but Downtown Austin is also known for its love of the winged nocturnal animals, the Mexican Free-Tailed Bats, which you see during sunset if you go Bat Watching.\n\nNorth America’s largest urban bat population comes to Austin in late March and continues through October. It is an exciting experience!\n\nFootball\n\nEverything is just a little different and bigger in Texas, and that includes high school football, college football and the Dallas Cowboys. The game is much more than a sport; it’s a culture, a lifestyle, and some even say it is a religion.\n\nFriday Night Lights is for real; it is a tradition, a time when families gather on bleachers to watch their children play ball, play in the band, cheer, and take the game in as spectators. If you head to the AT&T Stadium to watch the Dallas Cowboys, you can take in a football game at any school or college in the state.\n\nNot only that, but Homecoming Games and Dances are a huge thing in our High Schools, as well as the giving and receiving of huge Homecoming Mums.\n\nLive Music Capital of the World, Austin\n\nWhat is Texas known for? Austin’s official motto is the “Live Music Capital of the World”; you will see it on their website, at the airport, and around the city.\n\nMainly because on any given night, you can find over a hundred venues showcasing a wide variety of live music performances. It is entertaining!\n\nWe have 20 things to share when asked what Texas is known for, but here are some notable mentions that you should also know about.\n\nOne thing Texans do love is a drive to the Florida beaches at the Gulf Coast, or Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama area\n\nTexas has its own Space Coast – down in Houston our own NASA Lyndon B Johnson Space Center communicates directly with the International Space Station\n\nLook around you as you drive around and you’ll see signs of oil production. Texas Oil is and has always been a huge part of Texan history and revenue in the United States.\n\nThe Assassination of President John F Kennedy while on a visit to Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. The Sixth Floor Museum is a great place to visit to learn all about it.\n\nNow it’s your turn!\n\nWhat makes Texas unique for you? Share your suggestions with us!"
