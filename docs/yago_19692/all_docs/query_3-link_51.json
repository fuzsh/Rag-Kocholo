It may have been chosen to pay homage to the abundance of mesquite trees in the area or nearby Mesquite Creek. Mesquite officially became a city on December 3, 1887. The town had a population of 135 when the U.S. Census was taken in 1890.\n\nToday, Mesquite covers almost 50 square miles and is strategically situated at the crossroads of Interstates 20, 30 and 635, State Highway 352 and U.S. Highway 80.
