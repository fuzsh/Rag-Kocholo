(Tex 2023) It is part of a mature and established toolchain that has been around since 1980â€™s. (Knuth 1984) Originally written by Leslie Lamport, a computer scientist now working at Microsoft Research, its development has long been taken over by the open-source LaTeX community around the world. LaTeX is actually built on top of another system called TeX, a computer typesetting system designed by another influential Computer Scientist, Donald Knuth of Stanford University. Lamport and Knuth are shown in Figure 1.1.\n\nLaTeX is typically used for technical documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing, including writing CVs, letters, books, posters, presentations and much more. Whatever you create with LaTeX, one of its key strengths is making documents look professional in portable document format (pdf) using industrial-strength typesetting."
