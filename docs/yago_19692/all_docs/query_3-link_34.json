        "meta_description": "Texas - Culture, Music, Cuisine: The sense of the past and of the heroics of living in a frontier land have traditionally been strong in born-and-bred Texans. Throughout the state regional historical associations have helped restore striking examples of 19th-century homes. San Antonio has re-created the early 18th-century Mexican-Spanish flavour both in restoration and in public shopping and walking areas in the heart of the city. Fredericksburg, a former German settlement, preserves many 19th-century customs, and many of its inhabitants still speak German. Even Houston has found space adjacent to its downtown area for restored historical homes. Particularly evident are influences from Mexican culture. Laredo",

        "text": "The arts\n\nSeal of Texas\n\nThe state bird of Texas is the mockingbird.\n\nTexas' state flower is the bluebonnet.\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2020) 29,145,505; (2023 est.) 30,503,301\n\nGovernor:\n\nGreg Abbott (Republican)\n\nDate Of Admission:\n\nDec. 29, 1845\n\nArt, music, and literature occupy significant places in the lives of many communities in Texas. Mexican American folk arts and crafts have been prominent in border towns and rural South Texas since the mid-19th century and today are created and sold throughout the state, especially at fairs and festivals. Popular crafts produced are quilts, ceramics, shrines, wrought-iron crosses, piñatas, and saddles, all of which have been influenced by the Caddo, Spanish, and Tejano (Texans of Latin American heritage) cultures of Texas. The state has been a forerunner in contemporary art as well. The town of Marfa in the Trans-Peco region has become an artists’ community; there, sculptor Donald Judd founded the Chianti Foundation, a contemporary art museum exhibiting the works of national and international artists. The town of Round Top has also become an arts centre.\n\nThe music of Texas is as diverse as its population. The state is the birthplace of conjunto, a mix of traditional Mexican music and European polkas, and, along with Oklahoma, is the fulcrum of western swing, whose driving force was Texas music legend Bob Wills. Under the more-expansive label of Tejano, conjunto later evolved to incorporate brass and electronic instruments, bringing fame to such performers as Flaco Jiménez, Oscar Martínez, and Selena. Fiddling is another long-standing Texas musical tradition, and fiddle contests are held across the state. One of the best-known fiddlers was Eck Robertson from Amarillo, who made the first country recording with the fiddle in 1922. Texas also has an important legacy of blues music stretching from the country blues of Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lightnin’ Hopkins to the rhythm and blues of Bobby (“Blue”) Bland—who had his first success on Houston’s African American-owned Duke Records—and including the contributions of Johnny Winter and Stevie Ray Vaughan. An even-longer list of Texans who have been forces in country and rock music includes Willie Nelson, Janis Joplin, Buddy Holly, Waylon Jennings, Roy Orbison, Freddy Fender, Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earle, Doug Sahm (of the Sir Douglas Quintet), Guy Clark, Roky Erickson, and Alejandro Escovedo. Austin is known as the live-music capital of the world and hosts one of the largest live-music festivals in the country, South by Southwest.\n\nMany notable writers have depicted the frontier life of Texas. Among the most prominent are Larry McMurtry, who won a Pulitzer Prize for the novel Lonesome Dove (1986); J. Frank Dobie (1888–1964), who captured the essence of “old Texas” in stories of cowboys and gold mines as well as in folktales of the region’s unique physical features and animals; Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist and screenwriter Horton Foote of Wharton, who set dozens of plays in a fictional Texas town; Elmer Kelton, a novelist whose work treats the modern oil and ranching industries as well as the state’s frontier era; and Rolando Hinojosa of Mercedes, who has written extensively about Mexican American and Chicano culture in Texas.\n\nCultural institutions\n\nHouston’s Humble Civic Center and Arena nestles in 150 acres (60 hectares) amid the city’s tall downtown buildings. It serves as the home of the Houston Symphony Orchestra and the Houston Grand Opera. The Alley Theater, home of a renowned regional theatre company, is located nearby. In Dallas the Margo Jones Theatre and the Dallas Theater Center provide outlets for cultural and educational groups. The Dallas Symphony Orchestra is among the better-known classical ensembles in the country.\n\nThe Amon Carter Museum of Western Art in Fort Worth houses many paintings and bronzes of Western artists and maintains a microfilm collection of Western newspapers published before 1900. Also in the city are the Fort Worth Art Museum, the William Edrington Scott Theatre, the Kimbell Art Museum, and the Fort Worth Children’s Theater. The University of Texas at San Antonio’s Institute of Texan Cultures is a museum and an important centre of research on the many ethnic groups that have contributed to Texas history.\n\nCultural interests, however, are not restricted to large metropolitan areas. Odessa, for example, supports the unique Presidential Museum, showing extensive memorabilia of the U.S. presidents, as well as an accurate replica of London’s Globe Theatre, in which a summer program of Shakespearean and other Elizabethan plays is produced.\n\nThe Armstrong Browning Library at Baylor University houses thousands of books, manuscripts, and musical scores by and about Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. At the University of Texas at Austin, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library, operated as a branch of the Library of Congress, houses millions of documents on public affairs since the mid-1930s related to Johnson’s public career. Also at the university are a Latin American collection, the Michener Collection of Art, the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, and other special collections. The George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum at Texas A&M University and the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum at Southern Methodist University are devoted to research and exhibitions on the former presidents’ lives and families."
