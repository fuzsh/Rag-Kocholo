        "text": "Texas\n\nThese recipes showcase just some of the foods that Texas is famous for. “The Lone Star State” was the 28th state to join the U.S.A in 1845. Prior to that from 1836 to 1845 Texas actually ruled itself independently as its own country! It’s home to Big Bend National Park, Guadalupe Mountains National Park, Dr. Pepper, the Alamo, and Six Flags Amusement Park.\n\nWhen it comes to food, Texas just might be my favorite state. It is definitely known for its barbecue! Especially Texas Smoked Brisket, Ribs, and sausage. Finish the meal with Pecan Pie, Texas Sheet Cake, or Peach Cobbler which are all popular Texas desserts!\n\nTex-Mex is also hugely popular with dishes like Queso, Grilled Chicken and Steak Fajitas, Chicken Flautas, and Beef Enchiladas. And chili has been the official State Dish of Texas since 1977, although there is an ongoing debate as to whether it can have beans or not to really count.\n\nBreakfast tacos, migas, chicken fried steak, Blue Bell ice cream, and kolaches are also all popular foods you might enjoy on a visit to Texas!"
