The Texas Legislature provided the statutory authority for the creation of the Texas FAIR Plan Association in 1995. That statute was enacted in 2002 and TFPA was created.\n\nTexas FAIR Plan Association does not compete with the private market and applicants must have two declinations from other insurers in order to obtain coverage with TFPA."
