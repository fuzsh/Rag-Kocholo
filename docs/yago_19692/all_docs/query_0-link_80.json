        "text": "This is the question everyone asks me when I tell them that I am creating my resume using LaTeX. When they ask this question, I don’t answer them; I just change the topic because, to be honest, I didn’t know the answer. The only reason I started building my resume in LaTeX is that one of my seniors recommended it, and without questioning him, I just went for it. But later, after facing so many questions, it’s now my time to answer: What the heck is this?\n\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, here we go. To be honest, for the past few days, I have been eagerly searching for a topic, and today, one of my friends asked this question for the nth time. So, I thought it’s time to write and see how quickly I can create a blog post. Do you even care about all of this? I don’t think so. So, without wasting much time, let’s straight away move into the serious mode. Let’s begin.\n\nFirst of all, you read it wrong. It is not “Latex,” it’s “LaTeX”. Confused, huh? Let me explain how to pronounce it for you. So yeah, “lay-teks”; this is the way that most of you used to pronounce when following this. But the exact pronunciation is “LAY-tech” or “LAH-tech”. Well, why? Here is the story for you. Hold on, I am not that prepared to tell a story yet. Let me make a guess…\n\nIt should be some random Greek name for sure. Indeed it is!\n\nThe pronunciation of “LaTeX” as “LAY-tech” is derived from the way the term is constructed. “LaTeX” is actually a typesetting system developed by Leslie Lamport, based on Donald Knuth’s TeX system. The “La” in “LaTeX” comes from Lamport’s name, and “TeX” is derived from Knuth’s TeX system. In TeX, the “X” is pronounced as “k” (like the Greek letter “chi”). So, by analogy, “TeX” sounds like “tech.” That’s the simple story behind the name. I’m pretty sure that most of you didn’t get it. Don’t try to read it again. Ignore it. It’s just a typical history lesson that we don’t need.\n\nNow, let’s see what exactly LaTeX is… Start making notes from now on. LaTeX is a typesetting and document preparation program. Now, don’t ask, ‘who cares?’ because we all have to care. To be honest, outside of academia, I have found that most people have never heard of LaTeX, which I find disappointing. Even some of my fellow batchmates didn’t know about this, despite having LaTeX in the first-year syllabus.\n\nWhen I first learned how to use LaTeX, I suddenly realized why so many scientific papers have that certain style that sets them apart from other printed works. I believe that to fully understand and appreciate LaTeX, it’s essential to have some background on its history. So, let’s throw it back to another historical part. If you feel bored, you can just skip ahead… unfortunately, I can’t tell how long it will take to finish the history. It could be one paragraph or maybe three. So, go with your luck and skip the n number of paragraphs that your mind suggests. Sometimes the whole blog could be solely focused on history. Just saying…\n\nPrinting and Typography\n\nBefore the era of mass production, numerous great ideas were locked away in notebooks and handwritten manuscripts. Scribes were tasked with creating handwritten copies of important documents, but the process was expensive, slow, and unreliable. However, the invention of the printing press revolutionized the way we share knowledge and communicate ideas. Suddenly, books were everywhere, and the spread of information fueled the 15th-century Renaissance in Europe. The rapid production of books was not only due to the press mechanism but also the use of movable type. While methods of printing like stamps existed earlier, it was Gutenberg’s use of small interchangeable letters cast in metal that allowed for the rapid and reliable reproduction of printed works.\n\nThe printing industry continued to innovate over the years, progressively lowering costs and inventing new methods of production. One of the emerging concepts from the printing revolution was the art of arranging letters on the page, known as typography. All around us, there are fonts or typefaces that have a unique history. The form letters take can have a substantial effect on the reading experience and impart an additional flavor to the text.\n\nWhen designing a typeface, there are many things to consider, such as a letter’s shape, weight, spacing, and general readability. Companies that design and sell typefaces today are often still called foundries because of their roots in casting small letters out of molten metal.\n\nHow TeX was born\n\nAnother history lesson for you. On March 30, 1977, Donald Knuth received proofs for the second edition of his book “The Art of Computer Programming”. Looking over the pages, Knuth was disappointed with the results. You see, the first edition, released in 1968, was made using a method called hot metal printing, where molten lead was cast into a plate, which was later used for printing. By the 1970s, the printing industry had transitioned away from hot metal printing to a photo typesetting technique, where letters are projected onto the page, similar to how film is developed.\n\nThe classic look appreciated by Knuth was lost, which motivated him to create his own typesetting system, the one and only TeX. The name TeX is intended to be similar to the word ‘tech,’ with the final ‘ch’ sound. The letters of the name represent the capital Greek letters tau (Τ τ), epsilon (Ε ε), and chi (Χ χ), as TeX is an abbreviation for the Greek word ‘techne’, meaning both art and craft. Techne is the root of words like technique or technical. The name is specifically instructed to be typeset with the E below the baseline and reduced spacing between the letters.\n\nKnuth’s broad vision was to make the creation of high-quality publications more accessible and guarantee reproducible results on all computers. What started out as a small personal project turned into a decade-long deep dive into the world of typography.\n\nIn collaboration with the Stanford art department, Knuth developed Metafont, a programming language used to describe, manipulate, and create fonts. The mathematical foundations of Metafont allowed for precise definitions of fonts. Metafont was designed to be used alongside TeX in creating entirely reproducible documents. Metafont creates the letters, and TeX puts them on the page.\n\nFinally, Knuth used Metafont to create the Computer Modern typeface. Computer Modern captures the classic look he appreciated, which started this whole adventure. It is the default font for TeX documents and creates a certain aesthetic in mathematical writing. These three innovations (TeX, Metafont, and Computer Modern) revolutionized academic publishing. Most importantly, the sophistication of TeX made it easy for other users to extend the language and build their own systems.\n\nIn the 1980s, Leslie Lamport compiled a collection of TeX functions into a high-level language called LaTeX. Lamport was much more forgiving with respect to pronunciation: /lah-tech/, /lay-tech/, /lay-techs/. According to Lamport, anything goes, but typically I say /lay-tech/.\n\nThe set of macros Lamport defined finally made it easy to create high-quality documents. LaTeX has become the de facto standard for publishing scientific papers and continues to be widely used to this day. I know it may be getting a bit boring, but hang on, the history lesson is now over. Cheers! Now, let’s move on to the interesting part.\n\nI just had a realization about how engaged you all must be while reading. I must admit, I felt a bit bored while writing this, so I wonder how you managed to read this far. For those who skipped ahead and landed here, you are the luckiest. But as a writer, I don’t want my readers to get bored. So, I am making a few adjustments here and there to keep you engaged. Maybe while reading this, you might be thinking, “What the hell is this guy talking about? He’s referring to an interesting content as boring”. Well, trust me, when I typed it for the first time, it was actually boring. But now, if you’re not feeling that way, it’s Just Naveen Things. Okay then, let’s get back into the topic!\n\nWYSIWYG vs WYSIWYM\n\nYou might suddenly think, ‘What the heck is this?’ But keep calm; there’s a reason. Well, What’s the difference between these two? Don’t just say that the last letter of the first one is “G,” and the second one is “M.” Well, yes, that’s the difference, but what do they actually refer to? Any ideas? Here you go: WYSIWYG stands for “What You See Is What You Get,” and WYSIWYM stands for “What You See Is What You Mean”. Hope that clears it all up.\n\nOne common source of confusion when learning LaTeX is the separation of content writing from document formatting. Users add special commands to a plain text file to specify sections, make citations, and typeset mathematics. Then, LaTeX is run to compile the code into a PDF for viewing. This is in contrast to modern programs like Word, where you build a document using a point-and-click graphical interface.\n\nThe reason LaTeX is structured this way is that computers in the 1970s often didn’t have responsive high-resolution displays. Older software was frequently developed with the command line in mind. These two software paradigms are sometimes referred to as “What You See Is What You Get” for the graphical point-and-click method and “What You See Is What You Mean” for the code and compile method. As stated above, these paradigms give rise to the acronyms WYSIWYG and WYSIWYM, which can be a bit cumbersome to remember.\n\nA similar dichotomy shows up when creating websites. For example, there are services like WordPress where you can quickly build a website by dragging and dropping components. Alternatively, one can learn to build a website using the underlying code. Often, people start with a drag-and-drop approach and later transition to coding for more control and flexibility.\n\nIn the case of creating documents with LaTeX, I find the separation of content from form to be a benefit. It allows users to focus more on writing rather than battling with formatting. Once you are familiar with the common commands, there is no need to switch from typing to clicking, and the whole process becomes streamlined.\n\nThis is all I have to say about ‘What Is LaTeX?’ Oh, sorry, sorry, ‘WTF is LaTeX?’ How is the article?\n\nPersonally, I feel like my article may not be the most engaging or unique, as anyone can learn the history by watching a YouTube video instead of reading my messier blog. So, next time, instead of questioning what LaTeX is, I think the more appropriate question would be, ‘Why LaTeX?’ And, more specifically, if you’ve read the above article, you might ask, ‘Why can’t we just use Word or Google Docs?’ Well, that’s a fair question, but at this moment, I don’t feel educated enough to provide a solid answer. I’ll need some time to come up with a good justification.\n\nI’m back. It took me 2 hours to gather my thoughts and come up with a valid justification. So, here you go.\n\nI mean, I’m writing this blog in Google Docs right now, but when it comes to anything official, like a publication or something that I want to look particularly nice, I always turn to LaTeX. I haven’t fully transitioned yet, but I am definitely considering it. There must be some good reasons for doing so, right? So, these are the reasons I could consider in favor of LaTeX over others:\n\nPersonal Aesthetics\n\nI just think LaTeX documents look better than other formats. There’s a certain ineffable quality to a well-typeset document that I have come to appreciate. I think Knuth was onto something with his knack for precision and detail.\n\nLongevity\n\nSaving a document as plain text ensures longevity. I never have to worry about whether my document is compatible with future or past versions of Word. Plain text and PDFs are formats I’m confident will be around for a while.\n\nMathematics\n\nTeX was specifically designed to create beautiful mathematical documents. Typing out a mathematical formula is much easier than clicking through an equation editor. Also, since it’s all plain text, I can copy and paste equations easily.\n\nOpen Source\n\nAmazingly, all this software is open-source and free to use. Being an Open Source enthusiast, this is a very strong and valid reason for me. I have found that there are LaTeX style files for almost everything: presentation slides, cookbooks, screenplays, and many more. Having access to numerous LaTeX resources has truly provided a wide range of creative opportunities and exciting possibilities.\n\nSo that’s the story of how a stubborn professor revolutionized digital publishing, and that’s why I use LaTeX for my resume. But wait, where does the resume come into this? A justifiable reason to use LaTeX for resumes is that it offers more formatting and editing options than traditional word processors. This provides you with fine control and superior quality for your resume. Additionally, it’s easy to find free resume templates in LaTeX all over the internet.\n\nLeaving everything else aside, the actual reason why I am using LaTeX in my resume is to showcase that I am familiar with LaTeX, as I am into Research and Development. So, that could be an advantage for me. To be honest, other than that, there’s nothing else to justify from my end.\n\nDon’t make assumptions based on my article. I wholeheartedly recommend giving it a try. The best way to learn is by doing, so I encourage you to use LaTeX for your next lab report, essay, homework assignment, novel, article, or even your resume.\n\nFinally, I don’t believe this is the greatest conclusion. My apologies for that! See you in my next blog. Peace!"
