        "text": "Synonymous with the Wild West, wide open plains, barbecue, football and large urban living, Texas is nicknamed the Lone Star State. Texas was an independent republic before being admitted to the Union and is home to several important historic landmarks, none more so than the Alamo in San Antonio. Made up of a melting pot of different European, Spanish and Native American influences, cultures and traditions, Texas is defined by its three large urban centres in Dallas, Houston and San Antonio, which are some of the most populated cities in all of the United States.\n\nIn between the Lone Star State’s ever-expanding urban sprawls are the nation’s most productive oil fields, some of the largest cattle ranches in the nation and several prestigious universities, representing the Lone Star State in both academia and sport on both the national and international stage. A major player in American politics, the United States economy and shaping the nation’s culture, Texas is a truly iconic part of the United States that more than lives up to its larger-than-life reputation. What is Texas known for? Check it out.\n\nWhat Is Texas Known For?\n\n1- Large Cities\n\nWith its sheer size and ever-increasing urban population, it’s perhaps no surprise that the Lone Star State is home to several large cities and population centres, some of which are among the largest in the entire United States.\n\nDallas, Austin, Fort Worth, San Antonio and Houston are the largest cities in Texas and all boast populations of over 1 million residents across their metro sprawls.\n\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex alone is home to more than 6.5 million Texans, and let’s not forget about Houston, whose inner-city population of 2.2 million Texans ranks as one of the top 4 largest cities in the nation, only behind Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City.\n\nEach city has its own unique culture, speciality delicacies and riveting tourist attractions, yet each remains quintessentially Texan, making them interesting destinations to uncover and explore to get a sense of urban Texas, far removed from the Lone Star State’s oil fields and large cattle ranches.\n\nRecommended tours:\n\nBest of Austin Small-Group Driving Tour with Local Guide\n\nJFK Assassination and Museum Tour with Lee Harvey Oswald Rooming House\n\nSightseeing Tour of Dallas\n\nThe Haunted Ghost Bus Tour in San Antonio\n\n2- Ranching and Cowboy Culture\n\nPerhaps best known for its rugged Wild West past and large ranches, Texas is a state perhaps more synonymous with ranching and general cowboy culture than any other destination in the United States.\n\nTexas’ legacy as a frontier ranching hotspot stretches back to the 1690s when Spanish arrivals brought livestock to what is today Texas with their Entradas, with commercial cattle ranching a major economic boon for the Lone Star State for more than 300 years.\n\nCowboys and cowboy culture have seeped into all corners of Texan pop culture and history, such as with the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys, the Lone Star State’s most famous professional sports team who have been dubbed “America’s Team” due to their nationwide popularity and longstanding on-field success.\n\n3- The Alamo\n\nNo building or landmark site is as important to Texas and its people as the Alamo in San Antonio, the infamous setting of the Battle of the Alamo and the defining moment of the Texas Revolution.\n\nThe Alamo was founded as the “Misión San Antonio de Valero” by Spanish Roman Catholic missionaries in 1712 and became enshrined in American history when in 1836 frontiersmen Davy Crockett and James Bowie were slain at the Alamo while attempting a last stand against Mexican troops.\n\nFollowing the Battle of the Alamo, the venue was used mostly as a garrison for soldiers by both Texan and Mexican troops before being abandoned just 5 years after the battle took place.\n\nMeticulously restored and preserved as a Texan site of critical cultural and historic significance, the Alamo was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015 and remains the most visited attraction in San Antonio.\n\nRecommended tours:\n\nSan Antonio Missions UNESCO World Heritage Sites Tour\n\nBest of San Antonio Small Group Tour with Boat + Tower + Alamo\n\n4- Tex-Mex Cuisine\n\nInfluenced by its strong Spanish and Mexican connections and geographic setting as a Southern border state, Tex-Mex Cuisine and flavours are truly unique to the Lone Star State.\n\nTex-Mex Cuisine was first introduced to Texas by Tejanos, people with Coahuila and Tejas ancestry, and has morphed into a beloved culinary style that’s enjoyed throughout the American Southwest and beyond.\n\nSome popular Tex-Mex Culinary staples include dishes such as tacos, fajitas and tamales, with Tex-Mex food surpassing Italian food as the most widely enjoyed culinary style in the United States.\n\nBest enjoyed with a large group of friends and family members, Tex-Mex dishes are native to southern Texas and are renowned for their generous uses of flavours such as chilli peppers, beans and flour tortillas.\n\nRecommended tour: Austin Downtown Walking Food Tour With Secret Food Tours\n\n5- Space Exploration\n\nTexas was thrust into the international spotlight when the city of Houston began serving as the command centre for NASA space missions during the mid-20th century.\n\nThe Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center near downtown Houston has played an integral role in some of NASA’s largest space exploration efforts, most famously the Apollo program and the Space Shuttle program.\n\nApart from its key role in mission control duties, the Johnson Space Center has also been the long-time training hub for astronauts and was ground zero in orchestrating the first successful moon landing in 1969.\n\nThe centre was named in honour of former President Lyndon B. Johnson following his passing in 1973 and is now a fascinating museum which allows visitors to tour the original Apollo 11 mission control room as well as sneak a peek at several NASA artefacts. Skip the lines and buy your tickets here.\n\n6- The Texas State Fair\n\nTexas is a place known for doing things on a larger and grander stage, and the Texas State Fair is certainly no different.\n\nOrganised annually at Fair Park in downtown Dallas since 1886, the fair is a 24-day-long celebration of the Lone Star State’s people, cultures and traditions that regularly draws crowds of more than 2 million visitors.\n\nThe fair is one of the largest, longest and most-attended state fairs in the United States and is widely regarded as the premier state fair in the nation, with a litany of amusement rides, fairground festivities, food stalls and live entertainment on tap to keep visitors entertained all day long.\n\nUsually kicked off in the last week of September with an opening parade through the streets of downtown Dallas, the fair is among the biggest attractions in all of Texas and is always a must-see event whenever the fair comes rolling into town.\n\nNo sport is more popular in the state of Texas than football, with professional and amateur football reigning supreme in all major cities and urban hubs across the Lone Star State.\n\nThe state of Texas is home to two professional NFL franchises, the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans, with the Cowboys regularly ranking as one of the most valuable professional sports franchises and brands in the world due to the team’s large fan base and long history of on-field success.\n\nTexas has produced some of the biggest talents in professional football, thanks in large part to the state’s unrivalled high school football system and its more than a dozen NCAA Division I college football programs.\n\n8- The Lone Star State\n\nFew states boast a nickname so well-known throughout and beyond the United States than Texas, or the Lone Star State as it’s popularly referred to by both local Texans and those out of state.\n\nThe term “Lone Star State” is derived from Texas’ state flag which boasts a single star in its design, which was adopted following the territory’s independence from Mexico in 1836.\n\nTexas was a republic for almost a decade between 1836 and 1845, making it one of only 6 US states that can claim to have been an independent nation before Texas’ admission to the Union.\n\nTexans take great pride in their state and its nickname, so much so that the term “Lone Star State” also perfectly captures Texans’ affinity for being pioneers in their respective fields and having a reputation for doing things their own way.\n\n9- BBQ\n\nWhile Kansas City is widely regarded as the barbeque capital of the United States, few delicacies and culinary styles in the Lone Star State can rival the popularity of Texan-style Barbecue.\n\nTexan BBQ involves slow-cooking or smoking generous portions of pork or beef cuts such as ribs or brisket over a grill, paired with traditional BBQ side dishes such as potato salad, coleslaw, onion rings, or just more meat.\n\nEven though the art of Barbecuing meat is a tradition practised by countless cultures around the world, it’s the large portions, tasty side dishes and cultural significance that make Texan BBQ a treat to savour that’s simply unmatched elsewhere in the United States.\n\nRecommended tour: From Austin: Hill Country BBQ & Wine Shuttle\n\n10- Oil\n\nTexas might be better known for cattle and cowboys in pop culture, however, it is oil that’s the state’s biggest economic boon and one of the major reasons why Texas is the powerhouse it is today in modern-day America’s economy and politics.\n\nOil was first discovered in Texas around the turn of the 20th century near the city of Beaumont, which kickstarted an oil rush in the Southwest known as the Gusher Age.\n\nThe Gusher Age made Texas the largest petroleum producer in the United States by 1940 and helped the United States overtake Russia in terms of petroleum production.\n\nOil helped build Texan cities such as Dallas, Houston and San Antonio into the thriving modern-day metropolises they are today and would go on to fuel the state’s economic and population surge that’s still being experienced in the present day.\n\n11- The Rio Grande\n\nSnaking along the southern stretch of the state of Texas and serving as the natural border between the United States and Mexico, the Rio Grande is one of the Lone Star State’s most notable natural features and a critical water source for countless towns, cities and communities throughout southern Texas.\n\nRio Grande, which translates to grand or large river in Spanish, was first spotted and named by Spanish explorers around the mid-1500s, with conquistador Don Juan de Oñate y Salazar establishing a colony along the Rio Grande in 1598.\n\nSpanning a length of about 1,896 miles
