        "text": "Day of LaTeX\n\nSince there are no scheduled LaTeX or TeX meetings in the US this year, would you like to attend a Day of LaTeX?\n\nA Day of LaTeX is usually held in a meeting room equipped with a computer projector, and features several speakers who present hands-on tutorials on the use of LaTeX. Each presenter prepares a 60-90 minute tutorial on some aspect of LaTeX, such as LaTeX basics, LaTeX and graphics, typing math, and others. Each presenter also provides one or more sample documents which attendees will work on during the session. Attendees are typically new LaTeX users, or those who want to brush up on their skills. Some recent days of LaTeX were sponsored by UK TUG and PCTeX.\n\n(To be a presenter doesn't mean you have to be a LaTeX expert. Your job is to introduce a subject to beginners that you have some experience with. For example, if you have written documents that include bibliographies you can show how you do this.)\n\nIf you are interested in being a presenter or attendee, or if you would like to host a Day of LaTeX, please send a note to the editor. Some possible venues are San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Boston, Chicago, or your town or campus.\n\nIf you are in Europe, consider attending workshops at one of the scheduled conferences: TUG08 in Ireland, or BachoTeX in Poland."
