        "text": "Welcome to the UK List of\n\nTeX Frequently Asked Questions\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis is a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for English-speaking users of TeX.\n\nThe questions answered here cover a wide range of topics, but typesetting issues are mostly covered from the viewpoint of a LaTeX user. Some of the questions answered have little relevance to today’s users; this is inevitable — it’s easier to add information than it is to decide that information is no longer needed. The set of answered questions is therefore in a state of slow flux: new questions are answered, while old questions are deleted … but the whole process depends on the time available for FAQ maintenance.\n\nYou may use the FAQ\n\nby reading a printed document,\n\nby viewing a PDF file, with hyperlinks to assist browsing: copies are available formatted so that they could be printed on A4 paper or on North American “letter” paper, or\n\nvia Scott Pakin’s Visual FAQ, which shows LaTeX constructions with links to FAQ explanations of how they may be created.\n\nLicence of the FAQ\n\nThe source of the FAQ, available in the FAQ's CTAN directory, and its derived representations (currently, the HTML found at http://www.tex.ac.uk/faq and PDF copies, also in the FAQ's CTAN directory) are all placed in the public domain.\n\nFinding the Files\n\nAlmost all files suggested in any answer in these FAQs are available from CTAN archives, and may be reached via links in the file list at the end of the answer. In particular, documentation (when available) is linked from the CTAN Catalogue entry, which is also listed in the file list.\n\nUnless doing so is unavoidable, the answers do not mention things that are not on the CTAN archives. An obvious exception is web resources such as supplementary documents, etc."
