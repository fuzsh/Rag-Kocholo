LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is available as free software.\n\nYou don't have to pay for using LaTeX, i.e., there are no license fees, etc. But you are, of course, invited to support the maintenance and development efforts through a donation to the TeX Users Group (choose LaTeX Project contribution) if you are satisfied with LaTeX.\n\nYou can also sponsor the work of LaTeX team members through the GitHub sponsor program at the moment for Frank, David and Joseph. Your contribution goes without any reductions by GitHub to the developers in support of the project.\n\nThe volunteer efforts that provide you with LaTeX need financial support, so thanks for any contribution you are willing to make."
