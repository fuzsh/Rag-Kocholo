And not just because they say “y’all” or pull their car into the hard shoulder to let faster drivers pass.Texas is packed with traditions and many of them are unique to the Lone Star State. Texans usually welcome visitors, which makes sense considering the state’s motto is friendship. But catch the locals at certain times, and you may wonder where on Earth you’ve landed. And not just because they say “y’all” or pull their car into the hard shoulder to let faster drivers pass.\n\nTexas is cowboys and cowgirls, Tex-Mex, and southern hospitality, but it’s also much more. Let’s dive into some of the top Texas traditions, from the classic to the quirky, and understand more about this state and its people.\n\nWacky Texas Traditions\n\nOK, so we’re starting at the strange end of the scale when it comes to traditions in Texas. But why not? When it comes to memorable activities, Texas doesn’t disappoint.\n\nChicken Sh*t Bingo\n\nChicken Sh*t Bingo is a thing, and it’s popular around Austin. It’s similar to standard bingo. The difference here is contestants line up to pick one number. Instead of a bingo caller, there’s a chicken. This chicken, fed on chicken feed, will decide the winner.\n\nThe chicken struts around a large table on which all the players’ numbers reside. If the chicken poops on your number, you scoop a cash prize.\n\nThe Little Longhorn Saloon Bar near Austin started the craze more than 40 years ago. When not playing Chicken Sh*t Bingo, which is every Sunday, the bar hosts live music.\n\nPledging Allegiance to the United States and Texas\n\nTexas spent some time as an independent republic, from 1836-45, or 1846 if you follow its formal transfer date to the United States.\n\nProud Texans pledge their allegiance to the United States. However, some also swear allegiance to Texas afterward. People place their right hand over their heart and pledge:\n\n“Honor the Texas flag; I pledge allegiance to thee, Texas, one state under God, one and indivisible.”\n\nThis may happen at school or at any historical event or celebration. Flag wise, federal law dictates that the Texas flag, or indeed any flag, can never fly higher than the U.S. flag.\n\nCatching Catfish the Texas Noodling Way\n\nThe independent spirit of Texans means that, on occasion, their traditions have had to avoid the law. Noodling is a fishing technique to catch catfish by hand. The Texas tradition has been passed down for generations since before anyone can remember, but it only became legal in 2011.\n\nEssentially, fishers put their hands into breeding catfish’s riverside nests. The protective catfish attacks and the angler grabs its lower jaw. The angler pulls the catfish to the surface and wrestles it to the bank.\n\nWant a Soda in Texas? Ask for a Coke\n\nAnother peculiarity of Texans is that if you want a soda, you must first ask for a Coke. Why? Because Coke is Texan for soda. Once you’ve established that you’re asking for a sweet fizzy drink, choose your preferred brand, from Sprite to Diet Coke to even Pepsi.\n\nAsk for a Dr. Pepper to ingratiate yourself fully. Dr. Pepper was invented in Waco in 1885, and its secret formula is kept in two separate vaults in Dallas.\n\nTexas Traditions: The Importance of High School Football\n\nsource\n\nFootball is as popular in Texas as it is elsewhere. But what may surprise some visitors is that high school football is just as important, if not more so, than professional or college football.\n\nThe popular book and television series “Friday Night Lights” wasn’t far wrong with its depiction of football-loving Texans. And yes, many high school football games are played on Fridays under lights.\n\nHigh school football brings communities together and generates genuine love and excitement at games. That closeness of the fans and players is fundamental to high school football’s success.\n\nIt’s All About Football in Texas\n\nTexans might spend the whole weekend watching football. After Friday night high school football games, Saturdays are for watching college teams like Austin’s University of Texas and Texas A&M University.\n\nTexas is often home to famous bowl games like the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio, the Sun Bowl in El Paso, and the Cotton Bowl in Dallas.\n\nLocals follow professional games, of course, and those take place on Sunday during football season. The NFL’s Dallas Cowboys have been to eight Super Bowls, winning five, making them a football powerhouse, sometimes called “America’s team.”\n\nHouston Texans (previously the Oilers) are also popular, despite never reaching a Super Bowl. They’ve been in the playoffs six times, so surely it won’t be long before they lift the Vince Lombardi trophy.\n\nWhat Are Other Popular Texas Sports?\n\nBaseball is not far behind football in popularity. Texas boasts two Major League Baseball teams: the Houston Astros and the Texas Rangers.\n\nBasketball also features highly on many Texans’ radars. There are three Texan teams in the National Basketball Association (NBA): the Houston Rockets, San Antonio Spurs, and Dallas Mavericks, forming the Texas Triangle.\n\nSoccer fans can watch Major League Soccer franchises FC Dallas and the Houston Dynamos. Many Texas colleges and universities excel at athletics too.\n\nWe should also mention how much Texans love other sports, including Nascar, Formula One, golf, tennis, volleyball, and rodeos.\n\nTexas Traditions: Rodeos Still Going Strong\n\nTexans are rightly proud of the ranching, cowboy, and cowgirl history, from the enormous cattle drives to their survival skills.\n\nExpert horse riders, the vaqueros of Texas remain highly skilled workers and showstoppers. Modern cowboys and cowgirls still wrangle livestock, but many cattle drives are now helicopter-based. One of the best ways to see the classic Texas tradition of cowboys is to head to a rodeo.\n\nThe Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo is arguably the most well-known, with livestock exhibitions, concerts, bucking broncos, and a parade. There’s a horse show, carnival, and famous Texas barbecue.\n\nTexas Food Traditions: Tex-Mex, BBQ, and More\n\nsource\n\nTexas wouldn’t be Texas without its incredible culinary scene. From the 24-hour fast food chain Whataburger to fine dining, the Lone Star State has fantastic food for everyone. The state even invented its own genre, the world-famous Tex-Mex.\n\nIf eating in Texas isn’t enough, you can graze on Texas-shaped food. Choose from tortilla chips to chicken nuggets to waffles in a Texas-shaped waffle maker.\n\nBarbecue as a Texas Tradition\n\nTexan pitmasters are a sought-after breed. The sweltering Texas summers don’t stop these dedicated food artists from their trade. Texans have been known to wait in line for hours to get BBQ meat from their favorite joint (tailgating isn’t just for sports!).\n\nMany smokehouses cook their meat overnight, anywhere from six to 24 hours, and then sell out at lunchtime the next day. Don’t be surprised to see people eating with their hands. Brisket is popular and many Texans may choose this meat instead of the more traditional ham or turkey for holiday meals.\n\nA traditional Texas BBQ may include:\n\nSmoked or beef brisket\n\nPork ribs\n\nSausage\n\nSirloin\n\nSide dishes often include potato salad, creamed corn, and white bread. In fact, many meals throughout Texas come with lots of white bread served alongside them.\n\nRemember that people are big fans of cooking outdoors and are as likely to host BBQ parties as go to a smokehouse to eat. If you want something a little more Mexican, try a carne asada.\n\nDrive to a Gas Station to Get Great Grub\n\nTexans love to drive and aren’t afraid to travel many miles to their favorite restaurant or takeout spot. What may surprise visitors is that stopping at the gas station could offer a delish meal. Texas gas stations are renowned for their food, from tacos to fried chicken to homemade burgers.\n\nIf you order tea, remember that it’s sweet tea. You’ll have to order unsweetened tea if you want to avoid sugar. Or you can try sun tea, which is iced tea left to brew in sunlight for several hours.\n\nLook out for these delights as well:\n\nTexas toast: Extra thick slices of white bread are slathered on both sides in butter and garlic, then browned in a skillet or grilled to create a delicious Texan version of garlic bread.\n\nKolaches: This typical breakfast treat is a Czech sweet-dough pastry filled with sausage, cream cheese, or fruit.\n\nChicken-fried steak: Confusingly, there’s no chicken in a chicken-fried steak. This Texan version is tenderized beef that is battered and fried, then served with creamy gravy.\n\nTex-Mex as a Texas Tradition\n\nTex-Mex and Mexican food are as much a part of the Lone Star landscape as oil refineries and cacti.\n\nLook out for breakfast tacos and tamales; Christmas visitors may even be served tamales on Christmas Day. Texas chili—strictly without beans—is widespread, with chili cooking competitions all over the state.\n\nMany Tex-Mex restaurants serve classics like nachos con queso (nachos with cheese), which may be garnished with jalapenos or ground beef. There will be burritos, tasty tortillas, enchiladas, mole, and cochinita pibil (slow-roasted pork).\n\nOther Top Traditions in Texas: Fashion, Flowers, Dancing, and Fun\n\nsource\n\nWhen it comes to Texas fashion traditions, it doesn’t get more iconic than cowboy boots and cowboy hats. As it turns out, people do wear cowboy boots across the state, albeit many wear them for show or special occasions.\n\nFor example, spring brings a beautiful bloom of Texas’ state flower, bluebonnets, sparking a photographic Texas tradition. It’s not unusual to see people in bluebonnet fields taking photos of themselves, friends, and family, dressed up as cowgirls and cowboys. Others take pictures of the lovely landscapes.\n\nCowboy hats are popular, as is learning to ride a horse. You just need to decide if you want to ride the traditional local western or English saddle style.\n\nWhy Are Mums Popular in Texas?\n\nA mum is an often extravagant arrangement of faux chrysanthemums, ribbons, charms, and buttons sewn together and worn around a female’s neck. There may even be stuffed toys, glitter, and lights within a mum.\n\nPeople who leave high school in Texas receive elaborate homecoming mums, which vary depending on where you live.\n\nFor example, in North Texas, a large mum could reflect the school’s colors, while the Gulf Coast version is smaller. Houston also goes big and incorporates non-school colors. West Texas generally has trinket-heavy mums.\n\nThe Changing Face of Texas Traditions: Cotillion\n\nCotillion came from the 18th century and was used to describe a group dance. The modern twist, while harking back to a bygone age, has a few more layers.\n\nCotillion now covers social etiquette, dancing, how to shake hands, and table manners. Children usually attend a class series culminating in a final and formal dance. The modern equivalent would be a debutante ball.\n\nWhat Are Popular Dances in Texas?\n\nMusic and dance are integral to the frontier spirit of Texas. Western swing and conjunto were born in Texas, and blues and rock both have deep roots in the state. World-famous 1950s singer Buddy Holly was from Lubbock, Texas while Beyonce is from Houston.\n\nNot everyone can match Beyonce’s moves, but fret not. The most famous dance move you’ll see in dance halls and honky-tonks is the Texas two-step. Two slow steps follow two quick steps, and couples dance counterclockwise around the dance floor. It’s a simple base for dancers to add their flourishes and moves.\n\nWhat Is the Texas State Fair?\n\nOne of the country’s largest state fairs, the Texas State Fair attracts people from all over the country. Nothing says Texas as much as eating a corn dog and waving to the giant Big Tex cowboy figure that has come to symbolize the fair. There’s food, live music, agricultural exhibits, more than 70 rides, and entertainment showcasing everything Texas has to offer.\n\nVisit the Lone Star State to Enjoy Texas Traditions\n\nFrom alternative, chicken-based bingo to some of the best BBQ meat in the nation, Texas offers fun and diverse pastimes for everyone.\n\nThe Lone Star State loves its community causes, championing high school football as much as elite professional sports. There is the Texas Pledge of Allegiance, music, and surprisingly good food at gas stations.\n\nFor more culture, a trip around Texas’ historical sites adds another reason to visit. But just one thing: Don’t expect Texans to shovel snow from their driveways if it snows in winter. Apparently, the usually consistent good weather means most residents don’t know how to clear snow properly!\n\nBrought to you by amigoenergy"
