        "text": "Uncover 300 years of history at the Alamo, an awe-inspiring story that’s more intriguing than you might imagine. Established in 1718 as Mission San Antonio de Valero, the former mission now known as the Alamo has been a crossroads of history. Having existed under five flags of independent nations and served as a garrison for five different armies, the Alamo has a rich history and a heritage to inspire. Best known as the site of the 1836 Battle of the Alamo, the rest of the 300 year history is vital to understanding why the Battle happened and its importance.\n\nWhen Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda first explored and mapped the Texas coast in 1519, two worlds - European and indigenous American - became destined to collide. Instead of the fabled ocean passage between Spanish Mexico and the \"island of Florida,\" Álvarez de Pineda discovered land. For decades to come, European colonialists would attempt to explore its beautiful hills and plains, discover gold, control its life-giving springs and rivers, and conquer its many native peoples. During this time, the San Antonio area would become an important crossroads for European and indigenous American power.\n\n300 years ago, long before it was a fortress, the Alamo was a religious outpost of the Spanish empire named Mission San Antonio de Valero. First located on the spot it stands today in 1724, Valero's tale is about extraordinary lives at the frontier - a frontier both remote and at the center of world affairs. This is a story in which Spanish soldiers and men of God combined forces to control territory and its indigenous peoples; a story about cultures and art; monarchy and religion; politics and power; birth, survival, and death. It's a story that ultimately sets the stage for many battles to come.\n\nIn 1793, the Catholic Church relinquished control of Mission Valero, which became a self-governing community known as the Pueblo de Valero. But while eyes locally were focused on the distribution of mission lands, trouble was brewing both regionally and internationally. Threats on Tejas' borders with French Louisiana and America meant that by 1803, Valero had become a defensive fortress for the first time, occupied by a Spanish Army company known as La Segunda Compania Volante de San Carlos de Alamo de Parras - the Alamo Company for short. Then, in 1810, following the French invasion of Spain in 1808, years of unrest spilled over into war as Mexico sought independence from the Spanish crown. This was a violent time in San Antonio - of shifting allegiances and betrayal, but also of an emerging Texan identity.\n\nThe Battle of the Alamo in 1836 was part of the Texas Revolution in which the Mexican state of Tejas won independence and became a self-governing republic: Texas. What caused Tejas residents to forge their own path so soon after Mexico had won independence from Spain? Why were the Alamo and its famous Defenders in the thick of it? What was the “Texan Liberty” they were fighting for and was it for everyone? Their stories, famous and otherwise, tell us.\n\nFollowing the Texas Revolution, the Alamo's history mirrored that of the Republic of Texas and, after annexation, the United States. Having been left derelict for some years, the Alamo served as a staging post for the U.S. Army. It was during this expansion west that the Alamo’s famous parapet was added. During the Civil War, the Alamo was occupied by both the U.S. and Confederate armies. Control of the Alamo switched back to the U.S. Army when hostilities came to an end in 1865. This was a time of much upheaval and danger, which eventually led to an era of relative calm and peacefulness that allowed the City of San Antonio to grow.\n\nThe City of San Antonio was growing around the Alamo before the late 1800s. Chili Queens and small local businesses gave way to larger commercial developments, which began to take over Alamo Plaza and the Long Barrack. This commercial enterprise exploited the Alamo and its importance to the people of Texas and caused damage to the historic buildings of the old mission and fort. A few local women decided to take a stand and ensure the preservation of what remained of the Shrine of Texas Liberty. It is due to these efforts that the we are able to honor the history of the Alamo today."
