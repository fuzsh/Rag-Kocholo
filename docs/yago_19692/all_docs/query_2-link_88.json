        "text": "OEKO-TEX® MADE IN GREEN is a traceable product label that is issued for all kinds of textiles and leather that have been:\n\nTested for harmful substances\n\nProduced in environmentally friendly facilities\n\nManufactured in safe and socially responsible workplaces\n\nThe MADE IN GREEN label can be issued for articles at any stage of production. The specific product ID on each label offers a whole new level of transparency for companies and consumers by providing information about where a sales item was manufactured.\n\nThe label is awarded based on STeP certification of sustainable production facilities and STANDARD 100 certification of products tested for harmful substances. The central tool to manage these B2B data and communication is the myOEKO-TEX database.\n\nWith the MADE IN GREEN label, brands, retailers and manufacturers can transparently inform consumers that they and their suppliers act responsibly – by preserving the environment, respecting the health, safety and human rights of their workers, and ensuring high product safety.\n\nIn this sense, MADE IN GREEN offers highly credible proof of product stewardship and transparent supply chains which are increasingly demanded by consumers, NGOs and political initiatives.\n\nThe MADE IN GREEN label requires annual renewal.\n\nA purchaser of a MADE IN GREEN labeled product must be able to trace the information for five years. If there are any changes to the supply chain that relate to the label requirements, a new label must be issued.\n\nAny company within the textile and leather value chain can apply for the MADE IN GREEN label.\n\nThe product must be STANDARD 100 or LEATHER STANDARD certified and produced in a STeP certified facility.\n\nManufacturers, converters, wholesalers, retailers and brands that fulfill the criteria are allowed to use product label.\n\nNon-producers can obtain labels without their own certifications if their suppliers fulfil the MADE IN GREEN conditions. Brands and retailers can re-label MADE IN GREEN products from suppliers under their own company name."
