        "text": "Around 395,000 people relocate to the Lone Star State every year. So, if you’re considering moving to Texas, you’re in great company.\n\nBut, precisely, what are the benefits of living in Texas? What are the factors that make it such a great place to live, and are there any downsides? We’ve compiled this comprehensive list of pros and cons of living in Texas to help you prepare.\n\nPros of living in Texas\n\nTexas boasts excellent living conditions for a diverse range of households, from young singles to growing families and retirees. The most populous cities are Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, Austin, and Fort Worth. However, plenty of people find their slice of happiness away from the big cities in more rural areas, too.\n\nLet’s take a comprehensive look at the advantages of living in Texas, incorporating a broad spectrum of essential factors.\n\n1. Affordable housing\n\nLow housing costs are just one of the many financial benefits of living in Texas. From modern city apartments to spacious suburban homes and rural properties, the housing market is incredibly accessible. For example, the average home price in Texas is just $348,000, compared to $402,000 in East Coast states like Florida and $787,000 in West Coast states like California.\n\nAlthough it is worth pointing out, in some larger cities like Austin, the cost of housing is higher than other areas in the state which can make the city less accessible.\n\n2. No state income taxes\n\nTexas is one of the few states with no state income tax, meaning residents have more take home pay at the end of each month. The tax benefits of living in Texas also extend to retirees, as no income tax is deducted from Social Security, pensions, IRAs, and 401(k)s.\n\n3. Cultural diversity\n\nSouthern hospitality extends to everyone. The state is a melting pot of various cultures, including those from Hispanic, African American, Asian, Middle Eastern, and European backgrounds. Diversity is embraced and celebrated through various cultural events and festivals. A few examples include Fiesta San Antonio, Fiesta De La Flor in Corpus Christi, and Viva! El Paso.\n\n4. Job opportunities\n\nTexas is home to a booming economy and thriving job market fueled by powerhouse industries like technology, energy, aerospace, and healthcare. Whether you’re an experienced professional, recent graduate, or aspiring entrepreneur, there are myriad job opportunities to explore.\n\n5. Outdoor activities\n\nFrom high-octane rides at one of the state’s many theme parks to relaxing fishing trips on one of 150+ public lakes, Texas is home to a wealth of outdoor activities to suit every taste and budget. Fans of the great outdoors love the variety provided by the state’s 14 national parks, historic sites, and recreation areas and 89 state parks, many of which have campsites complete with modern facilities and amenities.\n\nRemember to plan ahead if you want to secure a campground. Texans particularly love camping during spring and fall, and for some, it can be too hot to camp during the summer. That means when the weather is mild, campsites are in high demand.\n\n6. Natural beauty and unique geography\n\nEasy access to impressive scenic landscapes is one of the most invigorating benefits of living in Texas. No matter where you base yourself in the Lone Star State, home will never be far from towering canyons, impressive rivers and lakes, expansive forests, or rolling prairies.\n\nBig Bend National Park: One of the greatest places to in Texas to enjoy the night sky without light pollution. During the day, explore huge canyons carved by the Rio Grande. Enjoy scenic views and diverse wildlife.\n\nPalo Duro Canyon: Did you know the second largest canyon in the United States is in Texas? This beautiful state park is just outside Amarillo. Take in the expansive views around the rim or hike (or drive) inside to find a campsite.\n\nMonahans Sandhill State Park: If you’ve ever wanted to go sledding down sand dunes in a park that will make you feel like you’ve traveled to another planet, Monahans is the place. Be prepared for pristine white sand and gorgeous views unlike any other.\n\nThere are many other unique places to visit in Texas such as Pedernales State Park, Enchanted Rock, and Caddo Lake.\n\n7. Haven for sports enthusiasts\n\nTexas is home to many professionals sports franchises. Baseball, basketball, American football, hockey, and soccer are firm favorites.\n\nIn Dallas-Fort Worth, the masses turn out to support the Rangers (MLB), Cowboys (NFL), Mavericks (NBA), Stars (NHL), and FC Dallas (MLS).\n\nIn San Antonio, crowds cheer on the Spurs (NBA).\n\nHoustonians love the Astros (MLB), Texans (NFL), Rockets (NBA), and Dynamo (MLS).\n\nAustin has the newest pro sports team in Texas, Austin FC (MLS).\n\nFor those who prefer active involvement, the state’s sprawling plains and impressive peaks offer cycling, hiking, and horseback riding opportunities. Meanwhile, the rivers running from north Texas down to the Gulf Coast are perfect for kayaking, rafting, tubing, and more.\n\n8. Relatively low cost of living\n\nBesides the favorable housing prices and state tax policies, everyday expenses also tend to be lower. It’s estimated the cost of living in Texas is 7% lower than the national average thanks to reasonable sales tax rates and affordable transportation, groceries, goods, and services. In some instances, public services are even free. For example, Dallas has a free trolley that connects the neighborhoods of Uptown and Downtown.\n\n9. Warmer winter weather\n\nThe warm weather year round is a major drawcard, as winter in Texas is characterized by a very amenable climate compared to many other states. That means fewer barriers to an active lifestyle as most Texans can get out and about and engage in activities throughout the year. The most amicable temperatures are found in south Texas. However, even in the coldest months, the average daily temperature statewide bottoms out at 58°F.\n\n10. Friendly people\n\nTexans are known for their southern charm and welcoming demeanor. The camaraderie creates a warm and inviting social environment for newcomers and longtime residents. Neighborhood get-togethers are common, and weekly farmers’ markets are a great place to mingle and try an array of seasonal fruits and vegetables, most of which are homegrown in central Texas.\n\n11. Great cuisine\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of living in Texas is easy access to incredible food! The influence of Mexican food and culture makes Tex-Mex a firm favorite, closely followed by traditional Texas BBQ, defined by its unique style and smoky flavor.\n\nHowever, the cuisine is also influenced by Native American, German, Czech, Asian, and Middle Eastern flavors. So, on any Texas table menu, you’re likely to find a wide variety of gastronomic options.\n\nCons of living in Texas\n\nWhile there are undoubtedly many positive aspects, it’s also essential to consider the drawbacks for a well-rounded and comprehensive perspective. So, let’s continue our exploration of the pros and cons of living in Texas with a few factors that necessitate a little caution and additional planning.\n\n1. Hot summers, extreme weather & natural disasters\n\nTexas is well known for its warm weather and hot and humid summers. However, the summer heat is typically easy to escape for households with affordable energy plans that allow for prolonged AC use. Hot weather aside, some areas are prone to more extreme summer weather patterns, including severe storms like hurricanes and tornados. Preparedness is essential in case you lose power or internet access.\n\nCheck out these helpful guides for more info:\n\nHow to Prepare for a Winter Storm\n\nHurricane Safety & Preparedness Guide\n\nFlood Safety Guide\n\n2. Heavy traffic and urban sprawl in major cities\n\nLike any other state with large metropolitan areas, congestion can be an issue. Rapid population growth and economic development have contributed to increased journey times, particularly during peak hours when the speed limit becomes irrelevant as traffic grinds to a halt.\n\nHowever, significant public transport planning initiatives are underway to improve infrastructure, and choosing a home close to your workplace can reduce commute times.\n\n3. Limited public transportation\n\nWhile the affordable cost of public transportation in Texas is not in question, the availability of services is less extensive and efficient than in many other states. That, and the state’s expansive nature, means it’s advisable that residents buy a car for maximum mobility and exploration opportunities.\n\n4. High property taxes\n\nBecause Texans don’t pay income tax, the state’s economy is supported by charging higher property taxes. Texan homes are subjected to the sixth highest property taxes nationwide, with an average property tax rate of 1.81%. However, lower taxes in other aspects of Texas living usually offset this outgoing. Plus, the property tax rate is lower if you choose a home in a rural location.\n\n5. Water scarcity and drought\n\nSevere weather caused by natural phenomena like the Pacific jet stream, Bermuda High, and El Niño cycles can make Texas prone to flooding and drought. Dry spells necessitate a mindful approach to water usage, as authorities sometimes impose water use restrictions. However, there are several effective ways to conserve water that can help you save money on utility bills.\n\n6. Political divides\n\nLike elsewhere in the US, Texas experiences political divides that sometimes impact civic discourse and community interaction. In particular, differences in political ideologies between urban and rural areas can lead to debates and disagreements. However, by fostering a respectful attitude and entering into open discussions, new residents can learn to understand differing views and perspectives.\n\n7. Issues with funding of public education\n\nFunding disparity across school districts can result in unequal access to educational resources and opportunities. This makes researching neighborhoods and schooling options essential for families with young children. That said, charter schools and private education are widely available. Plus, there are hundreds of public and independent colleges and universities to choose from at higher education levels.\n\n8. Struggles with healthcare access and quality\n\nOne of the most significant disadvantages of living in Texas is reduced access to affordable healthcare. Due to the high number of uninsured residents, the state chose not to expand the eligibility requirements for Medicaid. So, when you plan your move, it’s wise to allocate a generous healthcare budget or explore comprehensive employer-sponsored programs, especially if you or any of your family members have pre-existing conditions.\n\nAffordable energy plans from BKVE\n\nWhile it’s essential to acknowledge the nuanced aspects of living in Texas, pros and cons alike, one consistent factor influencing comfort and affordability is access to straightforward energy plans.\n\nWith a coverage area accounting for 90% of Texan residents, BKVE delivers simple, transparent electricity plans with easily-to-understand contracts and free cancellation within the first 30 days.\n\nSign up today and join the BKV Energy revolution!"
