        "text": "Loaded Nachos\n\nThis Tex-Mex favorite was invented in Piedras Negras, Mexico, in 1943. Are these the ultimate Mexican appetizer? Certainly not because of how it is being prepared in the United States.\n\nWhen you order nachos in the U.S., they are topping-loaded chip piles that contain lots of yellow cheese, pulled pork, sour cream, guacamole, and ground beef.\n\nThe original nachos are a far cry from this. The very first nachos were made with tortillas cut into triangles and fried, cheese that melted over the triangles, and pickled jalapeño peppers.\n\nNachos are a favorite snack that can even be turned into a dinner dish. It is considered by many as a Mexican dish, but they don’t really count because they were invented for the American wives of U.S. soldiers stationed at Fort Duncan.\n\nIt soon became a Tex-Mex staple that you could literally order at any Tex-Mex restaurant or fast food joint.\n\nFajitas\n\n“Fajita” means “little strip.” Despite the name, fajitas are as American as burgers and fries.\n\nFajitas were inspired by the ingredients of Mexico but would have seemed foreign to most people living south of the Rio Grande.\n\nThey were Americanized by using white flour instead of the original corn tortillas served alongside the meat and vegetables.\n\nGustavo Arellano writes in Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America that fajita, or the outside skirt steak of the cow, was considered a lower-class food for many years.\n\nFajitas turned the tide and became revolutionary in 1969 when it was served on a sizzling platter by a Laredo restaurant called Round-Up.\n\nChili Con Carne\n\nChili con Carne easily tops the list of Tex-Mex recipes. Raul Molina Jr. of Molina’s Restaurant in Houston said, “Spaghetti and chili was the original Tex-Mex dish.”\n\nThe name of the dish means “Chili with meat“, and although you might think it’s a traditional Mexican dish, this stew of ground beef, tomatoes, beans, spices, chili peppers, sour cream, and cheese is not 100% authentic.\n\nChili con carne was created by Texan settlers and the version you would be served in restaurants and diners are not authentically Mexican because they are overloaded with cheese.\n\nBurritos\n\nWhen you order burritos in the U.S., you can get a burrito approximately the size of a newborn baby. The filling you’d get for your burrito would literally be anything from rice, vegetables, beans, lots of cheese, sour cream, and anything else you can imagine.\n\nTraditionally though, burritos were made with just two or three simple ingredients: a meat or seafood base with rice, beans, white cheese, or chilies. It’s a far cry from the humongous burritos you would eat in the U.S. Tex-Mex restaurants today.\n\nThough not authentically Mexican, the Mexican version of this dish is called tacos de harina. They are thinner and smaller than the American version.\n\nAccording to Gerry Torres, owner of City Tacos in the San Diego area and born in Mexico City, “Tacos are a perfect size and have the right protein to tortilla ratio, whereas burritos are often made using giant tortillas and not as much filler,” he told Reader’s Digest.\n\nChimichangas\n\nIt is interesting to know that you won’t find chimichangas in Mexico today. The unproven story of this dish says that it originated from Arizona. It is a Mexican-American dish that is not actually eaten in Mexico although it is served in many Tex-Mex restaurants.\n\nWhen you order a chimichanga, you will literally get a deep-fried burrito served on a plate. The name of the dish is believed to be the Spanish equivalent of “thingamajig”. But in slang, chimichanga means deep-fried wet burrito."
