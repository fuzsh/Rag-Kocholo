The Caddos called the Spanish “tayshas,” meaning “friends” or “allies.”\n\nIn Spanish, this translated as “tejas,” and the United States eventually converted this name to Texas.\n\nDate admitted to the Union: Monday, December 29, 1845\n\nGeography\n\nSize: 268,597 sq. miles\n\nLowest point: Gulf of Mexico at sea level\n\nHighest point: Guadalupe Peak at 8,749 feet\n\nCounties: 254\n\nFamous locations: Big Bend National Park, San Antonio River Walk, Alamo Mission, Padre Island, the Alamo, NASA Space Center\n\nFamous Texans\n\nBeyoncé- singer\n\nLyndon B. Johnson– president\n\nHilary Duff- actress\n\nJennifer Garner- actress\n\nSelena Gomez- singer/actress\n\nJamie Foxx- actor/singer/comedian\n\nFun Facts\n\nTexas is the only state to have the flags of six different nations fly over it: Spain, France, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the Confederate States, and the United States.\n\nTexas was an independent nation from 1836 to 1845. When Texas joined the Union, it kept the right to fly its state flag at the same height as the national flag.\n\nTexas has more counties (254) than any other state in the U.S.\n\nUnder both Spanish and Mexican rule, Texas was divided into municipalities instead.\n\nThe saying, “Everything’s bigger in Texas,” certainly has some truth to it. Texas is the second largest U.S. state (behind Alaska).\n\nIt’s larger than every country in Europe, and King Ranch in Texas is bigger than the entire state of Rhode Island. It also has the second largest population in the nation (behind California).\n\nDr Pepper was invented in Waco, Texas in 1885 by a pharmacist named Charles Alderton. You may be surprised to learn that there’s no period after the “Dr” in Dr Pepper.\n\nOne of the most popular snacks in Texas is peanuts in Dr Pepper.\n\nTexas has more than 70,000 miles of highway. Each year, the state uses 1.6 million gallons of white and yellow paint to line its highways.\n\nAt 85 miles per hour, Texas also has the highest speed limit in the country.\n\nAthens, Texas claims to be the birthplace of the hamburger.\n\nTexas is also known for “Tex-Mex” food, a combination of Texan and Mexican cuisine that includes nachos, fajitas, burritos, and hard tacos."
