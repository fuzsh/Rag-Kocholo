        "text": "1982\n\nTHE ORIGINAL CHUY’S STARTED IN AUSTIN, TX\n\nChuy’s opened on April 16, 1982 in an old, aban­doned Texas Barbeque joint on iconic Barton Springs Road in Austin, TX. There was seating for about sixty, a women’s restroom the size of a broom closet and a men’s restroom that was, well, outside. Founders Mike Young and John Zapp had a vision of a fun and funky Tex-Mex restau­rant that served authen­tic and fresh food in an atmos­phere that appealed to everyone. From these humble begin­nings Chuy’s was born.\n\n“IF YOU’VE SEEN ONE CHUY’S, YOU’VE SEEN ONE CHUY’S”\n\nOur founders, Mike and John, along with their ​“dec­o­ra­tor” Jose Cuervo, made some inter­est­ing deci­sions on restau­rant décor. Mostly due to lack of money and the cre­ativ­i­ty of their ​“dec­o­ra­tor.” Those Chuy’s touches you love, like the hand-carved wooden fish ​“swimming” from the ceiling, hubcaps hanging bright and shiny above your booth and the Elvis shrine, are still alive and well in our restau­rants today. Although we have kept many of these original eclectic touches in our restau­rants, we want each Chuy’s to be unique to the com­mu­ni­ty they serve. Our ded­i­cat­ed team searches far and wide for those special pieces that will make your Chuy’s unlike any other.\n\nWE DON’T TAKE ANYTHING SERI­OUS­LY, EXCEPT OUR FOOD\n\nWhile we are Tex-Mex, our menu is made up of a com­bi­na­tion of flavors, with recipes and ingre­di­ents from across New Mexico, Mexican border towns, the Rio Grande Valley, South Texas and, of course, Austin. Wanna know a secret? Our fajita marinade is an old South Texas family recipe that has been used at some ​“infamous” South Padre Island beach parties. Our founders had a vision to bring FRESH to Tex-Mex, and that com­mit­ment to our food is still the core of every­thing we do today.\n\nBRINGING TEX-MEX TO THE PEOPLE\n\nIn the late 2000’s, with only fifteen restau­rants around Texas, we decided it was time to let the universe in on our little Tex-Mex secret. It just didn’t feel right to keep our made from scratch dishes and out of this world service and atmos­phere to our­selves anymore. With that desire to ​“spread the love,” we opened the first Chuy’s outside of Texas in the Nashville, TN suburb of Franklin in November of 2009. From there we have been spread­ing our vision of fresh, authen­tic Tex-Mex across the country and bringing what started ​“Deep in the Heart of Tex-Mex” to food and fun lovers everywhere."
