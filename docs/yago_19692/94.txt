TeX is a typesetting system created by Donald Knuth which finds a surprisingly high use ratio in the mathematics, science and engineering communities. We have TeX available on our UNIX, Linux and even our Windows environment.

TeX has an active user group, TUG, which is headquartered in Portland. Visit their website at: http://www.tug.org.

For help getting started with TeX/LaTeX and related topics, visit the TUG beginners link: http://www.tug.org/begin.html
