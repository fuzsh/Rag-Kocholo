TeX , by Donald E. Knuth, is a computer type-setting system and markup language that heralded a revolution in the quality of the vast majority of published mathematics.

The ideal is to be able to describe important classes of documents in terms of their components, without mentioning actual fonts or point sizes or details of spacing; a single style-independent document can then be set in many different styles.
