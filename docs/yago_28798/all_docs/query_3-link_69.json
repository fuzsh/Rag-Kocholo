        "text": "Comedy legend John Cleese has married for the fourth time – calling new bride Jennifer Wade “an extraordinary one off”.\n\nThe Monty Python and Fawlty Towers star, 72, fought tears as he wed Jennifer, 41, in Mustique, four years after his previous costly divorce.\n\nCleese said of his bride: “I knew from the first moment we met this could be very serious.”\n\nCleese’s jewellery designer bride wore a pearl-coloured gown and he turned up in a blue suit and white shoes for the Methodist ceremony at an exclusive villa.\n\nCleese added: “When people see us together, they immediately get it.”\n\nHis new wife is 31 years younger than Cleese, but the age difference “never bothers us” said Jennifer.\n\nCleese’s divorce from wife No3 Alyce Faye Eichelberger, cost an £8million lump sum and £612,000-a-year until 2016, despite having no children.\n\nWife No2 was Barbara Trentham.\n\nHis first wife was Fawlty Towers co-writer and star Connie Booth."
