        "text": "The news that Fawlty Towers is set to be revived by John Cleese came as a big shock to many TV fans when it was announced last week – and it appears that former star and co-writer Connie Booth was one of those surprised by the announcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBooth, who played Polly in the classic sitcom – which she wrote with her then-husband Cleese – has revealed that she found out about the reboot in the newspaper and hadn't been alerted to the news in advance.\n\nNever miss a thing.

People are a little sensitive nowadays, to put it lightly.\n\n\"If anything we’re making fun of the show’s characters and their idiosyncrasies.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nJohn Cleese's Fawlty Towers revival will be set abroad – won't be on BBC\n\nWhat happened to the cast of Fawlty Towers?\n\nFawlty Towers reboot confirmed with John Cleese and daughter Camilla\n\nThe iconic series originally aired for two seasons on BBC One in 1975 and 1979 respectively and went on to become one of the most revered shows in British TV history, winning a 2019 Radio Times poll to determine the greatest British sitcom of all time.\n\nLast week, John Cleese – who has repeatedly hit out at cancel culture – said that the Fawlty Towers revival would be set abroad and would not be airing on the BBC.\n\nThe new run will see Basil manage a boutique hotel with his daughter, who he has just realised is his, and will explore how the character navigates the modern world.\n\nNo further casting information has been revealed at this stage, but executive producers for the reboot will include actor and director Rob Reiner, his wife and actress Michele Reiner, director and producer Matthew George and Derrick Rossi.\n\nCheck out more of our Comedy coverage or visit our TV Guide and Streaming Guide to find out what's on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTry Radio Times magazine today and get 12 issues for only £1 with delivery to your home – subscribe now.
