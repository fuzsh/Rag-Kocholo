        "text": "Cleese has combined three of the best episodes (The Hotel Inspectors, Communication Problems and, of course, The Germans) to create a laugh-a-minute treat. All our favourite characters are back: reluctant hoteliers Basil and Sybil Fawlty, Spanish waiter Manuel, quick-thinking waitress Polly, eccentric resident guest The Major, and iconic guests such as the deaf and demanding Mrs Richards.\n\nIt’s a chance to revisit this brilliantly constructed comedy, with the hotel, the period fashions and the theme tune all faithfully recreated, and to bask once again in unforgettable lines such as “I know nothing” and “Don’t mention the war”. Fawlty Towers has checked in and it could well be about to enjoy a long stay in the West End.\n\nHow to buy tickets for John Cleese’s Fawlty Towers – The Play\n\nYou can find seats for the London production of John Cleese’s Fawlty Towers – The Play on Telegraph Tickets. Check the site for the latest prices.\n\nThe cast\n\nIt’s a big task to match the indelible performances of the original TV Fawlty Towers cast: Cleese as the irascible Basil Fawlty, Prunella Scales as the bouffant-haired Sybil, Andrew Sachs as the well-meaning but English-mangling Manuel, and Connie Booth as the canny straight woman Polly.\n\nBut this new West End company comes astonishingly close. They’re led by Adam Jackson-Smith (The 39 Steps), Anna-Jane Casey (Cabaret), Hemi Yeroham (La Cage aux Folles), Victoria Fox (singer with Victoria & The Foxes), Paul Nicholas (Just Good Friends), and Rachel Izen (Funny Girl).\n\nThe show is adapted by John Cleese, famous for his work with Monty Python’s Flying Circus and on movies such as A Fish Called Wanda, Clockwise plus the Shrek and Harry Potter series. It’s directed by Caroline Jay Ranger (Only Fools and Horses – The Musical).\n\nThe details\n\nWhere is John Cleese’s Fawlty Towers – The Play playing?\n\nJohn Cleese’s Fawlty Towers – The Play runs at the Apollo Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue, which is in the heart of London’s West End, near Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square.\n\nWhat is the running time of John Cleese’s Fawlty Towers – The Play?\n\nJohn Cleese’s Fawlty Towers – The Play is two hours, including an interval.\n\nHow long is John Cleese’s Fawlty Towers – The Play running for?\n\nJohn Cleese’s Fawlty Towers – The Play is currently booking to September 28, 2024.\n\nWhat is the minimum age for John Cleese’s Fawlty Towers – The Play?\n\nThere is no set age recommendation for John Cleese’s Fawlty Towers – The Play. The official theatre guidance is all ages. However, there are a few elements that might distress very young viewers, such as a gunshot.\n\nDoes John Cleese’s Fawlty Towers – The Play have accessible performances?\n\nYes, the show runs some captioned, signed and audio-described performances. Please head to the theatre website for more information about John Cleese’s Fawlty Towers – The Play access performances.\n\nThe review\n\n“Laughter, applause, delighted recognition… Directed at a spirited lick by Caroline Jay Ranger on a split-level 70s period set, with theme music intact, it’s wall-to-wall nostalgia and copper-bottomed mirth.” Read the full Telegraph review.\n\nWatch the trailer\n\nFAQs\n\nWill John Cleese be in the new Fawlty Towers?\n\nJohn Cleese doesn’t actually appear on stage in this new Fawlty Towers play. Instead, the brilliant Adam Jackson-Smith is uncanny in his performance as Basil Fawlty. However, this is very much Cleese’s baby: he adapted the show from his own scripts and has been heavily involved with the production.\n\nIs the Fawlty Towers play based on any episodes from the TV show?\n\nYes, this hilarious Fawlty Towers stage play combines three of the most iconic episodes: The Hotel Inspectors, Communication Problems and The Germans. That means you get Basil panicking about a surprise inspector, while also dealing with a formidable guest, hiding his gambling from Sybil and taunting the poor Germans.\n\nCan you take children to Fawlty Towers on stage?\n\nDefinitely, there’s no set age limit to the show. As this is mainly old-fashioned entertainment, in the best sense, it’s generally very family-friendly. There’s just a bit of shouting, some sharp insults, slapstick fainting and the Major shoots his gun once in the bar."
