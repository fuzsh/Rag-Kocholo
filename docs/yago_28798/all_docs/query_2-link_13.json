        "text": "Connie, 82, who played long-suffering maid Polly in the 1970s show, said: “I’d have appreciated learning about the project from John, rather than reading about it in the papers.\n\n“Because a previous American reboot of Fawlty Towers had failed some years ago, I was surprised that another was being planned.\n\n“I was even more surprised to read that John intends to write and to perform in it together with his daughter Camilla.”\n\nMeanwhile, John, 83, is bringing the slapstick sitcom, which ran from 1975 to 1979, back to life with Camilla.\n\nThe star, who played manic Torquay hotelier Basil Fawlty, is working on the new series, set in the Caribbean, with Spinal Tap film-maker Rob Reiner.\n\nBasil will be the show’s only returning character – Prunella Scales, 90, who played Basil’s wife Sybil, has dementia and Andrew Sachs, who was waiter Manuel, died in 2016.\n\nSpeaking about the reboot last week, John said: “Connie and I wrote the 12 episodes together and both felt we had done it. Then Connie retired from showbusiness and I moved on.”\n\nThe actor added: “If you put it in the Caribbean it becomes very multiracial.\n\n“People in the hotel business come from everywhere...so you can bring lots of different people together.”\n\nConnie and John were married for 10 years, from 1968 to 1978."
