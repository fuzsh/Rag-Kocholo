        "text": "When John Cleese emerged from an acrimonious third divorce which left him £12 million poorer, he joked that friends would “knee-cap” him if he ever married again.\n\nBut the comedian and actor has gone ahead and tied the knot once more, this time to a woman 31 years his junior.\n\nCleese, 72, married Jennifer Wade, 41, in a romantic ceremony on the Caribbean island of Mustique.\n\n“I knew from the first moment I met her that this could be something very serious,” Cleese said. “She is an extraordinary one-off.”\n\nMiss Wade, who wore a pale pink satin bridal gown, added: “We’re kindred spirits. When people see us together they immediately get it.”\n\nThe bride said that the age gap “never bothers us”.\n\nThe wedding was held in a private villa and conducted by a Methodist minister in the presence of Hello! magazine, which paid an undisclosed sum for the exclusive rights.\n\nThe fee will come in handy. Cleese’s third wife, Alyce Faye Eichelberger, was awarded a £12.2 million settlement when the couple divorced in 2008 after 16 years of marriage. A US court ruled that Miss Eichelberger, an American psychotherapist, should receive £8 million in cash and assets, plus £600,000 per year for seven years, despite the couple having no children.\n\nCleese was forced to go back on the road to meet the bill, in a one-man show he dubbed the ‘Alimony Tour’.\n\n“Basically, I have to find a million dollars a year until I’m 76. You don’t get that sort of money by sitting at home,” he said. “That I, at my age, would have to plan my life anew to pay her all the money she is to get for the next seven years - well, it irritates me.”\n\nYet Cleese told Hello! magazine that the divorce battle had not put him off marriage altogether.\n\n\"The truth is, I'm a romantic,\" he said.\n\nCleese was married to Connie Booth, his Fawlty Towers co-star, from 1968-1978. They had one daughter. His second marriage, to Barbara Trentham, also produced a daughter and lasted from 1981-1990. He married Miss Eichelberger two years later.\n\nCleese’s friends cautioned him against jumping into marriage number four. Asked in 2010 if he would consider marrying again, he replied: “Yes, I think so, but not until it would cease to shock and alarm my friends who’d form a little gang and say they’re going to come and knee-cap me if I mention the ‘M’ word.”\n\nOne of those friends was Terry Gilliam, the film director and fellow Python, who remarked: “If he does [marry], he is stupid. John has been married already three times and each time to the same woman. They always seem to be blonde, American; the only difference is that each time they get younger and younger.”\n\nMiss Wade is blonde and considerably younger than her new husband, but was born in Britain and raised in South Africa, New Zealand and Spain.\n\nShe is divorced from her first husband, Old Harrovian businessman Richard Norris, and told the Daily Telegraph last year: “My lawyer said he wanted to put up a photograph of me in his office with a sign above it saying, ‘The woman who took nothing’.”\n\nCleese has said: “One thing we know about Jenny is, she’s not after my money.” But he also conceded that he would consider protecting his finances for marriage number four, saying: “Maybe a pre-nup. I think so.”"
