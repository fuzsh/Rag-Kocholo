        "text": "Connie Booth is an American actress and writer best known for her work in the 1960s and 70s with her ex-husband, John Cleese, both on his show Monty Python's Flying Circus and on their sitcom, which they co-created, co-wrote, and co-starred in, Fawlty Towers.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n2 Roles\n\n2.1 Starring Roles\n\n2.2 Guest Starring Roles\n\n2.3 Specials and Made-for-TV Movies\n\n2.4 Talk, News and Game Show Appearances\n\n3 Writer\n\n3.1 Staff Writer\n\n3.2 Notable Films Written\n\n3.3 Creator\n\n4 Memorable Moments\n\nBiography\n\nConnie Booth was born in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1944 to a Wall Street mogul and an actress. She, too, began acting on stage and moved to New York to try her hand at Broadway. While a waitress in the 1960s, she met John Cleese, who had been travelling in America as part of a revue and had stayed on there. She and Cleese were married, and she moved with him back to England.\n\nWhile Cleese started work in Monty Python's Flying Circus, Booth was a constant fixture at the sets. She was well-liked by the other members of Monty Python, in part because, during the recording of the earliest episodes, her distinctive laugh was one of the few they heard from the studio audience. They later had her play several supporting roles, both in the series and in their first original film, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, as a witch accused of turning a man into a newt.\n\nFeeling that he wasn't spending enough time with her and with their daughter Cynthia—born in 1971—Cleese left the show before its fourth season. They collaborated on a film, Romance with a Double Bass. Cleese demanded that his next project also be in collaboration with Booth. The BBC agreed, and together they wrote and created Fawlty Towers. Besides writing every episode together, Cleese played hotel manager Basil Fawlty, and Booth played the waitress, Polly Sherman. The response to the show was at first underwhelming, but by the time of the rebroadcast of the first season, it had become a cult smash hit.\n\nIn 1978, Cleese and Booth suffered a painful divorce after ten years of marriage. Around the same time, vicious rumors were spreading regarding her pay for her work on Fawlty Towers. Despite this, Cleese and Booth would collaborate again on a second season of Fawlty Towers before going their separate ways.\n\nThroughout the 80s and 90s, she found other work in British films and TV, often playing an American. During this time, she avoided any association with Fawlty Towers and shunned interviews about it. She was also the victim of more rumors, which she denied—this time that she was a lesbian and had had an illicit affair with Cleese's sister.\n\nAt the start of the 21st century, she retired from acting and went into relative seclusion as a psychotherapist. She now lives in a small English town with her husband, theater critic John Lahr, and spends most of her time counselling new mothers—particularly those from foreign countries, just as she once was.\n\nRoles\n\nStarring Roles\n\nSeries Role Year(s) Season(s) Fawlty Towers Polly Sherman 1975–1979 1 2 Floodtide Isabel 1987 1 YuYu Hakusho Additional Voices (English version) 2002–2006 1 2 3 4\n\nGuest Starring Roles\n\nSeries Role Episode Airdate Monty Python's Flying Circus Lumberjack's Girl 1x09 - The Ant, an Introduction December 14, 1969 Monty Python's Flying Circus Rosamund 1x12 - The Naked Ant January 4, 1970 Monty Python's Flying Circus Petula Wilcox 2x05 - Live from the Grill-o-mat October 27, 1970 Monty Python's Flying Circus Second Mustachioed Juror 3x01 - Whicker's World October 19, 1972 Monty Python's Flying Circus \"No!
