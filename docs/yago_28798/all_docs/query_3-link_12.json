        "text": "John Cleese announces his new show with GB News\n\nJohn Cleese urged his Twitter followers not to get a “divorce in California” as he was in the middle of performing in a number of countries across the world during his tour last year.\n\nThe 84-year-old has been married four times with the comedy legend reportedly having forked out £25milllion in divorce settlements.\n\nJohn, who is now married to Jennifer Wade, took to the micro-blogging site last year and admitted he felt he had been living in hotels.\n\nThe Fawlty Towers actor said he goes \"wherever the work is\" as the stand-up star was on a comedy tour.\n\nIn view of his 5.7 million followers, John explained, at the time, that he was off to the United States in the coming days.\n\nREAD MORE Khloe Kardashian panics fans with 'confusing' Matthew Perry tribute\n\nThe veteran comic tweeted: \"I live in hotel rooms, wherever the work is.\n\n\"Just performed 36 shows in Canada, the US, Portugal, Hungary, Spain, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands.\n\n\"Off to the US again on Thursday.\"\n\nHe finished: \"Don't get divorced in California.\"\n\nDon't miss...\n\nStrictly's Amanda Abbington says 'we must look after each other' following loss [LATEST]\n\nJames Jordan fears Strictly star 'will go home' as he talks show exit [TV]\n\nBBC Strictly fans share concern for Giovanni Pernice as his parents speak out [UPDATES]\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. You can unsubscribe at any time. Read our Privacy Policy\n\nSocial media users flocked to comment on the post as his legion of fans reacted to the tweet.\n\nTwitter user, @‌Christhebuther said: \"You have to rest more, John. Spend more time on Twitter and with checking your emails... (I sent you what I promised, on Tuesday, I think). Okay, I know, tweeting and emailing won't pay your divorce.\"\n\n@‌Barrettpj62 quizzed: \"Incredible stamina in your 83rd year but I thought you'd finished paying your ex off from the alimony tour?\"\n\n@‌LynneVero asked: \"You really want to kick back in a tropical island paradise and never see us again?\"\n\n\"How much longer do you have to pay alimony, or will it never end? I worry about you overworking,\" wrote @‌Markrs75.\n\n@‌VeldPark added: \"John, your shows are good, but maybe you should retire now. Enjoy your life.\"\n\nJohn has previously opened up about his three divorces as he joked his ex-wives \"cause most of the misery in the world\".\n\nDuring an appearance on the US chat show Conan O'Brien alongside his comedy partner Eric Idle, he opened up on marriage back in 2016.\n\n\"I have been married for 34 years. To four different wives,\" he said before referring to his second wife Barbara Threntham, who died from complications with leukaemia in 2013.\n\n\"One of my ex-wives died. You know what? It was very sad because it was the wrong one.\"\n\nConan chuckled along with the actor and comedian before he asked: \"Do you have any real anger or hatred towards your ex-wives?\"\n\nJohn, who is currently married to his fourth wife Jennifer Wade - who is 32 years his junior, took the opportunity to hit out at his former wives who are still alive - Connie Booth and Alyce Cleese.\n\nHe remarked: \"No, I mean, I am quite happy if one or two of them would be dead. But I don't have anything against them as people.\"\n\nIt comes as John will launch his 10-part GB News show, The Dinosaur Hour, on Sunday evening.\n\nIt will see him hosting a series of intimate chats “aimed at the unfashionable and out-of-touch\" in a 12th century castle.\n\nGuests will include Stephen Fry, Caitlin Jenner, Trevor McDonald, Chris Tarrant and Rob Schneider.\n\nPromoting the series in an interview with Michelle Dewberry on GB News, John said: “I want to discuss woke issues on The Dinosaur Hour and we couldn’t get people on. One woman said: ‘It’s wrong even to discuss it.’ In other words, they just want us to accept all their ideas and they’re not prepared to discuss them.”\n\nAsked how he got the opportunity John added he received an \"extraordinary offer that’s ever been made to anyone in the history of television\".\n\nJohn Cleese's The Dinosaur Hour airs Sunday at 9pm on GB News."
