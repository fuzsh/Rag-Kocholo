        "text": "Fawlty Towers, the brainchild of comedy legend John Cleese and his former wife Connie Booth, first graced our TV screens back in 1975. Despite running for just 12 episodes, the sitcom, set in a chaotic hotel, propelled its cast to international fame, becoming a firm favourite among viewers.\n\nJohn's portrayal of the irritable hotelier Basil Fawlty, famed for his outbursts directed at the hapless Spanish waiter Manuel, solidified his place as a giant of British comedy, adding to his already stellar reputation from his Monty Python days and The Frost Report.\n\nAiring for two seasons, Fawlty Towers came to an end in 1979, ensuring its legacy as a timeless classic. Fast forward to 2023, and John, now 84, sent shockwaves through the entertainment world with the news that the beloved show was being resurrected after a 50-year hiatus, reports the Express.\n\nCollaborating with his daughter, Camilla Cleese, the comedy veteran is reportedly penning fresh episodes. With the highly anticipated return of Fawlty Towers on the horizon, let's take a look at where the original cast members are now...\n\nJohn Cleese (Basil Fawlty)\n\nJohn's portrayal of Basil Fawlty, prone to fits of rage, whether it was taking a \"damn good thrashing\" to his car or his notorious goose-stepping episode, was a masterclass in comedic timing. After Fawlty Towers, John shifted his focus to the big screen during the 80s and 90s, starring in a slew of films including Clockwise, A Fish Called Wanda and its sequel, Fierce Creatures, as well as two James Bond films as R's aide and later Q.\n\nIn 2016, he reprised his role as Basil for a Specsavers advert, which sparked rumours that it was a way for him to deal with a hefty divorce settlement. John, who has walked down the aisle four times, was reportedly asked to cough up a staggering £12 million to his third wife, Alyce Eichelberger, which allegedly included an annual payment of £600,000 over seven years.\n\nThe dad-of-two now lives with his wife Jennifer on the Caribbean island of Nevis, after leaving the UK due to his disillusionment with British politics.\n\nPrunella Scales (Sybil Fawlty)\n\nPrunella Scales, best known for her role as the sharp-tongued Sybil Fawlty, was always more skilled at running the hotel than her on-screen hubby Basil. Post-Fawlty Towers, Prunella appeared in numerous films, including The Boys From Brazil and Howard's End, but many will remember her most for the Tesco adverts where she played Dotty, alongside Jane Horrocks as her long-suffering daughter.\n\nPrunella tied the knot with fellow actor Timothy West in 1963 and the pair have two sons. Their eldest, Sam West, has recently been seen on our screens in the reboot of All Creatures Great And Small.\n\nNow 91, Prunella and her husband were the faces of Great Canal Journeys on Channel 4 from 2014 to 2019. The start of the series coincided with the announcement that she was fighting Alzheimer's, and by 2020, Prunella revealed that the disease had forced them to step away from the much-loved travel show and retire from TV.\n\nAndrew Sachs (Manuel)\n\nAndrew Sachs, best known as the clumsy waiter Manuel, often found himself at the receiving end of Basil's outbursts. A lesser-known fact about Andrew is that he released three singles in character, including Manuel's Good Food Guide in 1977.\n\nDuring his time on the sitcom, Andrew suffered second-degree burns during a fire stunt that went wrong. After hanging up his apron, he ventured into voiceover and radio work as well as TV, including a brief stint on Coronation Street.\n\nIn 2008, Andrew was thrust into the spotlight when Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross prank-called him, leaving messages about Russell's sexual encounter with his granddaughter Georgina Baillie. This incident caused a huge scandal, leading to the BBC issuing an apology, Russell resigning and Jonathan being suspended.\n\nIt was reported that Andrew had cut ties with his granddaughter following the scandal but managed to reconcile before his death. In 2012, Andrew was diagnosed with vascular dementia, which left him unable to speak and confined to a wheelchair.\n\nHe passed away in 2016, and his wife Melody followed him the next year. They had three children.\n\nConnie Booth (Polly Sherman)\n\nConnie Booth played sensible chambermaid Polly Sherman and co-wrote Fawlty Towers with her then-husband John Cleese. Connie and John met in the 1960s, got hitched in 1968 and welcomed their daughter Cynthia three years later.\n\nBy the time the second series of Fawlty Towers started filming, they were divorced but remained good pals. Connie continued to star in shows like The Tomorrow People and The Buccaneers but retired from acting in 1995.\n\nShe then switched careers and became a psychotherapist. Now 83, she lives in London with her author husband John Lahr.\n\nBallard Berkeley (Major Gowen)\n\nBallard Berkeley played Major Gowen, a slightly senile permanent resident at the hotel. However, the character's racist and bigoted views have been censored, with his most offensive lines cut out of repeats.\n\nIn real life, Ballard appeared in several TV series including Hi-de-Hi! and To The Manor Born, and his last role was a voiceover in the animated film The BFG before his death in 1988.\n\nBernard Cribbins (Mr Hutchinson)\n\nBernard Cribbins portrayed Mr Hutchinson, a spoons salesman whom Basil became convinced was a hotel inspector. The much-loved actor, whose career spanned over 70 years, was known for his roles in The Wombles, three Carry On films and Doctor Who.\n\nThe actor was married to his wife Gillian McBarnet from 1955 until her passing in 2021. He passed away at the age of 93 on July 27, 2022, with an outpouring of tributes from co-stars and fans alike.\n\nHis last TV appearance saw him return as Wilfred Mott on Doctor Who. David Tennant, in 2023, fondly remembered: \"Can we get Wilfred back? Can grandad be back on set? He was getting old and a little bit infirm but he was still full of beans and full of energy.\n\n\"And I am thrilled to say that although very sadly he wasn't in those episodes as much as we hoped, he was on set with us and Wilfred lives on.\n\n\"Bernard is much missed and much grieved for, but I am so excited that his final screen performance will be [one] I had the great honour of being part of and you'll see it all on your screens.\""
