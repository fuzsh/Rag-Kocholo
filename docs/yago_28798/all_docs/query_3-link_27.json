        "text": "Comedy legend John Cleese has married for the fourth time, saying of his beautiful new bride Jennifer Wade: “She is an extraordinary one off.”The Monty Python and Fawlty Towers star, who fought back tears as he wed Jennifer in Mustique, added:“I knew from the first moment I met her that this could be something very serious.”\n\nThe ceremony was conducted by a Methodist minister on the island’s most exclusive villa and HELLO! Magazine was present to capture all its emotional glory in its edition on sale today.Jennifer added of it: “We’re kindred spirits. When people see us together, they immediately get it.”The wedding comes four years after Cleese’s acrimonious divorce from his third wife Alyce Faye Eischelberger which cost him a huge chunk of his fortunes.John tells HELLO!, “I never felt there was anything wrong with the institution of marriage – the only thing wrong was my ability to chose the right person. I couldn’t imagine being with anyone other than Jenny now. And with my record, that’s a pretty remarkable thing to say.”At 41-years-old she is 31 years younger than the 72 year old comedian but the age difference “never bothers us” Jennifer tells HELLO!."
