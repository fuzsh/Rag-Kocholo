        "text": "I have recently become infatuated with Fawlty Towers the British sitcom made in the 70’s, written by John Cleese and his then wife Connie Booth and performed by them as well. The show was ranked number one on a list of the Greatest British Television Programs ever in 2000 and, in 2019, it was named the greatest ever British TV sitcom by a panel of British comedy experts. And yes it is that good.\n\nABOUT THE SHOW\n\nThe show is about a bickering couple Basil and Sybil Fawlty, played by Cleese and Prunella Scales, who own a modest bed and breakfast somewhere in the English country side.\n\nBetween language mixups, misunderstandings, and Basil’s flaws driving the plots, every episode is full of comic energy. Although it is scripted, it is a lot like a commedia dell’arte play. The characters are stock, the situations standard, and what makes it amusing is the genius of the acting (and the writing). Like commedia dell’arte, at the end of every episode, nothing has changed, and all of the stock characters are back to their normal state.\n\nFAWLTY TOWERS TO BECOME WEST END PLAY"
