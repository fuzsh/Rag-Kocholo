        "text": "Despite storms, Sevier County's burn ban still on 08/20/24\n\nDE QUEEN – Despite some rain in parts of the county Sunday night, a burn ban remains in effect across the entirety of Sevier County.\n\nMatt Webb, coordinator of Sevier County’s Office of Emergency Management, said the recent rainfall was too scattered and too light to impact the recent drought-like conditions.\n\n“We got some in parts of the county, but most of Sevier completely missed it,” said Webb. “It’s still very dry out there and the risk for fires is really high.”\n\nSevier County implemented its burn ban on Aug. 15. Howard County issued its own ban the following day, but Howard County Judge Brent Pinkerton recalled it on Monday. He reported that his county had received around two inches of rain from Sunday night’s storms. Montgomery County was able to lift its burn ban, as well.\n\nSevier County was not so lucky, and the burn ban will remain in effect until the area receives some significant rainfall. As of Tuesday morning, the National Weather Service’s seven-day forecast shows zero chances for precipitation.\n\nSevier County and Dallas County are the only two in Arkansas with active burn bans as of Tuesday morning.\n\nWebb said Sevier County firefighters were busy over the past weekend battling blazes across the county, from Gillham to Horatio. He reminds the public to call 911 immediately if they see suspect a fire is out of control. He stressed that all outdoor burning is prohibited at this time under the burn ban.\n\n“You can’t have any open fires,” he explained. “You can operate a charcoal grill but we can’t stress enough that everyone is mindful about the fire risk right now.”\n\nWebb said a truck accidentally dragging a chain from its trailer caused a couple of spot fires in the county, which were quickly put out. Throwing a lit cigarette from a window can also pose a tremendous risk for causing a fire under current conditions (and, of course, should never be done under any circumstance).\n\nCommunity-wide pep rally tonight at Leopard Stadium 08/20/24\n\nDE QUEEN – The Leopards Athletic Booster Club will host a community-wide pep rally this evening beginning at 7 p.m. at Leopard Stadium.\n\nEveryone is invited to come out and show their support for the De Queen Leopards football team as they mark the start of another season.\n\nThe cost of admission is just one bottle of Gatorade per person.\n\nDe Queen Schools hosts groundbreaking for new agri-science facility 08/20/24\n\nDE QUEEN – De Queen Public Schools hosted a groundbreaking ceremony Monday night to celebrate the start of construction of its new agri-science facility.\n\nDozens of people turned out at the new construction site, located just east of the schools' baseball and softball facility. The De Queen School Board approved the facility last month after years of planning. It will be used by the district's agriculture science department and will include animal facilities for use by students.\n\nSuperintendent Jason Sanders said he was thrilled by the turnout during Monday's event and said it was a testament to the excitement building for the new facility. He added that it'll be a tremendous feature for De Queen's students given the importance of agriculture to the economy of Southwest Arkansas.\n\n“We've probably got 50-60 community members and businesses associated with agriculture here today. We're thankful they can, this is an important day,” said Sanders. “Agriculture is very important to the state of Arkansas and very important to us here in Sevier County. This is a way we can invest in that and the students in those programs. This facility will open up a lot of opportunities. We've been working on this for six or seven years so it's an exciting day to see this come to fruition.”\n\nSanders said a good financial year for De Queen Schools will allow the district to cover most of the cost of the project with savings from the current fiscal year.\n\nThe district hopes to have the new facility constructed by the end of the current school year.\n\nCoach Bell previews Leopards football season at Rotary 08/20/24\n\nDE QUEEN – At the Aug. 19 De Queen Rotary Club meeting at Micah 6:8, De Queen Leopards head football coach Richard Bell previewed the upcoming season. It’s the second year for Bell to be the head coach at his alma mater, and his 17th year coaching in the De Queen School system.\n\nCoach Bell says the number of players participating in football has grown to 150 from the seventh grade through senior high. The Leopards will suit out 42 this season. The Cubs squad has about 60 members. The seventh-grade group is about 50 players strong.\n\nAfter a successful offseason program, Coach Bell told Rotarians that the 1,000-pound weight club has grown from zero to 16 members. The 1,000-pound weight club combines bench press, power lift, squat, and incline.\n\nThe Leopards started several sophomores last year. Coach Bell is pleased to report that those players have matured and grown for their junior year. Linebacker Jake Martin led the team in tackles last year as a sophomore, while Kyle Williamson led the team in sacks.\n\nOffensively, quarterback Cole Binkley and halfback Ulyces Coto return as three-year starters. Binkley, who has received a scholarship offer from Lyon College, is like a coach on the field, while Coto, a vital two-way player, rarely comes off the field.\n\nCoach Bell is particularly excited about offensive lineman Darion Henderson, a junior with college football potential, who has shed his baby fat and is now listed as a solid 6’5” 315-pound tackle.\n\nNewcomers John Maturino, a sophomore who played quarterback for the Cubs last year, and Cody Pickett, a transfer from Horatio, will help immediately at wide receiver and fullback respectively.\n\nThe Leopards will compete in a three-way preseason scrimmage on Friday, August 23 in Leopard Stadium at 7:00 against Waldron and Murfreesboro. De Queen will host Mena for the season opener on August 30.\n\n“The players are giving great effort with a positive attitude”, Coach Bell said. “And, I still get goosebumps when I head down to the field!”\n\nThe Leopards have dropped Ashdown and Nashville as non-conference opponents, while picking up Horatio and Lafayette County. Coach Bell says he hopes to tab the Horatio game as “The Sevier County Showdown”, with a trophy going to the winning team.\n\nAfter Mena, Horatio, Lafayette County, and a bye week, the Leopards will open up 5A-South Conference play against Hope for homecoming. Coach Bell says with a few breaks, he believes his team has a chance to start out 4-0.\n\nCoach Bell thanked Superintendent Jason Sanders and High School Principal Audrey Chandler for their tremendous support.\n\nIn response to questions from Rotarians, Coach Bell said the Leopards have worked hard on the passing game and will plan to throw the ball more, just not in the preseason scrimmage. “We have some receivers who can go get the ball and new offensive line coach Tristan Snider has done a tremendous job improving our pass blocking upfront”, Bell said.\n\nGuests at the Rotary Club meeting included Brittany Bell, Coach Bell’s wife, as well as Offensive Coordinator and Assistant Head Coach Phillip Binkley and junior high and seventh grade coach Drew Dykes.\n\nCoach Bell was introduced by Rotarian Greg Revels, who arranged the program.\n\nSCCA awards over $5,500 to youth livestock exhibitors 08/20/24\n\nSCCA awards over $5,500 to local youth livestock exhibitors\n\nDE QUEEN – The Sevier County Cattlemen’s Association is in its 31st year of providing additional premiums for youth who raise and show county bred commercial heifers at the Sevier County Fair and Livestock Show.\n\nThis year, with the continued support of area businesses and individuals, the Commercial Heifer Improvement Project provided $5,550.00 to the following exhibitors:\n\nCaselyn Van Voast, American Division – Class 4 First place, Grand Champion, and Overall Reserve\n\nKinnah Ferguson, American Division – Class 2 First place, Reserve Grand Champion\n\nKalee Simmons, English Division – Class 1 First place, and Reserve Grand Champion\n\nKatelyn Griffin, Exotic Division – Class 1 First place, and Grand Champion\n\nKix Lee, Exotic Division – Class 2 First place, and Reserve Grand Champion\n\nJake Sawyer, First place – Class 3 American Division\n\nMonica Rivas, Second place – Class 1 English Division\n\nSeely Adcock, First place – Class 2 English Division\n\nBraylee Reynolds, Second place – Class 2 English Division\n\nOlivia Frady, Second place – Class 3 English Division\n\n(See photos of these youth and their animals in the Aug. 22 edition of The De Queen Bee)\n\nLittle River County Rodeo is this Friday, Saturday in Foreman 08/20/24\n\nFOREMAN – The Wing Rodeo Company will present the annual Little River County Rodeo this Friday and Saturday, Aug. 23-24 at 8 p.m. both nights.\n\nThere will be a calf scramble with cash prizes for ages 6-10 and a money drop for youth five and under.

Inspired by Arkansas's “Land of Opportunity” slogan, he settled between Horatio and De Queen, embracing a dramatic lifestyle change from city to rural life.\n\nMartinez faced challenges, including establishing credit and credibility, but his perseverance led to significant achievements in agriculture. In 1987, his family was honored as the Sevier County Farm Family of the Year, and later that year, they won the district title.\n\nMartinez's success inspired many, and today, Sevier County boasts the highest number of Latino farmers in Arkansas. Martinez brings valuable insights into agriculture and regional industry to the many boards he has served and is currently serving such as Little Rock Federal Reserve Board of Directors, University of Arkansas Cossatot Board of Visitors, and Christus St. Michael Hospital to name a few.\n\nHis role includes economic research, policy input, and community development. Martinez also owns Rancho La Esperanza and serves on the Board of Visitors for Cossatot Community College, the Arkansas Farm Bureau, and the Sevier County Farm Service Agency. He played a key role in integrating Cossatot Community College into the University of Arkansas system.\n\nThe Arkansas Latino Hall of Fame, an initiative by the North Little Rock Chamber of Commerce, stands as a testament to Arkansas’ cultural richness and community engagement. This groundbreaking event will annually bring together leaders, visionaries, and community members to celebrate the remarkable achievements of Latinos who have significantly contributed to the cultural, economic, and social tapestry of Arkansas.\n\nThrough compelling storytelling, vibrant performances, and a shared sense of pride, this ceremony will not only honor individual accomplishments but also serve as a catalyst for building bridges, fostering understanding, and creating a more connected and vibrant community for all.\n\nFamed Arkansas sports broadcaster, Rex Nelson, visits De Queen 08/15/24\n\nDE QUEEN – At the August 12 De Queen Rotary Club meeting, popular statewide columnist and sports broadcaster Rex Nelson painted a positive economic picture for the future of Arkansas.\n\nStarting in the southern half of the state, Nelson says he’s convinced that the projected lithium boom in the Lafayette County area is for real. Standard Lithium, a Canadian-based company, has already invested tens of millions. Then about a year ago, Exxon Mobile announced in the Wall Street Journal that they were getting in the lithium business. In fact, Exxon predicted that 15% of the lithium produced in the world would be processed in Southwest Arkansas. Nelson estimated that would mean a six-billion-dollar industry in order to accomplish that 15% goal.\n\nNelson foresees the lithium boom being like a massive freight train in that it’s slow to get started but will gain momentum fast. He predicts that the processing plants will be in Lafayette County, but that most of the workers will reside in Texarkana and Magnolia.\n\nAlso in South Arkansas, Nelson told Rotarians that the defense industry in Camden now means about 3,000 jobs and they’re looking for more employees to fill additional jobs. Most of the defense weapons in Ukraine are made right here in South Arkansas.\n\nIn Northwest Arkansas, both Tyson Foods and Walmart have required many of their white-collar workers around country to relocate to Arkansas. Walmart is constructing a one-billion-dollar corporate campus. Alice Walton is adding 100,000 square feet to the Crystal Bridges Museum and is launching a Medical School in the region.\n\nIn Northeast Arkansas, Big River Steel will soon make Mississippi County the largest steel-producing county in the United States.\n\nIn Fort Smith, fighter pilots from U.S allies all over the world will come to train. That’s projected to have a one-billion-dollar annual economic impact.\n\nIn Central Arkansas, its estimated that Amazon now has grown to over 4,000 employees. And that has prompted companies like Tractor Supply, Dollar General, and Home Depot to open nearby distribution centers that employ another 2,000.\n\nAgriculture is still number one in Arkansas. The Delta in Southeast Arkansas continues to help feed the world.\n\nNelson says that this economic development statewide helps every Arkansan. Economic growth allows the legislature to continue to cut taxes.\n\nRecord numbers of people are relocating to Arkansas because they’re looking for low cost of living, less traffic, less crime, and friendly people. Nelson says newcomers are also looking for outdoor recreational opportunities and Arkansas delivers with world class cycling, hiking, float streams, rock climbing, clear water lake scuba diving, bird watching, and more.\n\nNelson, who’s served as the radio voice for Ouachita Baptist for the past 40 years and hosts the popular statewide high school football scoreboard show that airs on 70+ radio stations around the state, is a Senior Editor and columnist for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.\n\nNelson was introduced by Rotarian Jay Bunyard, who arranged the program.\n\nSevier County to implement burn ban beginning Thursday 08/14/24\n\nDE QUEEN – A burn ban will go into effect for the entirety of Sevier County beginning at midnight tonight. The announcement comes ahead of at least a week of dangerously high temperatures and after several weeks of little to no rain.\n\nSevier County has joined Montgomery County as one of two counties in Arkansas to implement a burn ban as of Wednesday morning.\n\nIn an order issued by Sevier County Judge Sandra Dunn, under the ban all outdoor burning will be prohibited without a written permit from the Sevier County Office of Emergency Management. Anyone who suspects they see an uncontrolled fire is asked to call 911 immediately.\n\nTypically these bans remain in effect until the affected county receives enough rain to remedy the fire threat.\n\nDaily highs have been in the upper 90s all week with index values well into the triple digits. Temperatures are expected to remain dangerously high through the middle of next week, according to the National Weather Service, and there is no chance for rain in the seven-day forecast.\n\nDangerous heat returns to listening area 08/14/24\n\nDE QUEEN – Dangerously hot weather has returned to the region after an all-to-brief “cool spell” this past weekend.\n\nHighs are expected to hover in the upper 90s and reach the triple-digit mark on Sunday – before factoring in the dreaded heat index. Today’s heat index is expected to reach 106. The heat wave comes at an incredibly inopportune time, given that this week is Fair Week in Sevier County.\n\nA heat advisory has been in effect each day since Tuesday and that’s expected to continue through the new week.\n\nDespite some rain on Sunday and Monday, it was hardly enough for the region after weeks of no precipitation whatsoever.\n\nThe main threat right now are the dangerously hot temperatures. The heat, coupled with high humidity, pose a significant risk for heat-related illnesses. People are advised to drink plenty of fluids, stay in air-conditioning if possible, stay out of the sun and check up on relatives and neighbors, especially the elderly.\n\nTake extra precautions when outside. Wear lightweight and loose fitting clothing. Try to limit strenuous activities to early morning or evening. Take action when you see symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\nTo reduce risk during outdoor work, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends scheduling frequent rest breaks in shaded or air conditioned environments. Anyone overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat stroke is an emergency and 911 should be called immediately.\n\nOwners of outside pets and livestock are also reminded to ensure they have access to clean drinking water and shade.\n\nSevier County Fair underway, results announced from Tuesday night livestock shows 08/14/24\n\nDE QUEEN – Fair week continues in Sevier County despite the brutal heat.\n\nTonight is the last night of livestock shows at the 87th annual Sevier County Fair and Rodeo, but many more activities are still planned and underway.

Lynn Helms Airport is set to receive more than $388,000 in federal grant funds to assist in constructing a new taxi lane.\n\nLast week, the Federal Aviation Administration announced it was distributing nearly $15 million to 20 airports across Arkansas. The funding comes from the newest round of 2024 Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation. The grants pay for various projects to improve runways, airfields and airport facilities.\n\nThis was the fourth round of AIP grants for the 2023-2024 fiscal year. The FAA has awarded $1.13 billion in AIP grants in the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. In total, the Sevier County Airport will receive $388,656 to aid in building a new, long-needed taxi lane.\n\nThe airport is also in the process of building and relocating a number of hangers due to their proximity to the runway. FAA officials said the current layout of the hangers is against the agency’s safety regulations. The project is being funded through a $500,000 grant awarded to the airport last year and included a $50,000 match from the county.\n\nThe airport is generally seeing more traffic in recent years, with the FAA reporting on its website that the facility averages 38 flights a day according to its most recent data (dating back to March, 2023). Aircraft operations at the airport are broken down into 80 percent local general aviation, 18 percent transient general aviation and one percent military.\n\nAnother regional airport set to receiving funding through this latest round of grants is the Bearce Airport near Mount Ida. That airport will receive just over $924,000 to rehabilitate its runway and reseal its taxiway pavement.\n\nJob Fair next week to assist Husqvarna employees 08/13/24\n\nNASHVILLE – A job fair will be held next week for Husqvarna workers to help them find new employment after the company announced it would shutter its Nashville facility by the end of the year.\n\nThe job fair will be held Aug. 22 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Husqvarna’s location in Nashville. Hosted by the Arkansas Workforce Connections Office of Employment & Training, the job fair hopes to help Husqvarna’s impacted employees find new jobs in the region.\n\nAround 700 people from around the region are expected to lose their jobs after Husqvarna announced the closure earlier this year.

Students at De Queen Public Schools return to class today. Horatio students return on Wednesday with their new four-day school week. Ashdown returns next Monday, Aug. 19. Cossatot River students return with their four-day schedule next Tuesday, Aug. 20.\n\nWhile the summer heat is very much still with us, this week marks the end of summer vacation for most students and time to get back at it.\n\nWith the start school comes the start of heavier morning and afternoon traffic. Educators and local law enforcement ask everyone to take extra caution while commuting, especially in the morning and afternoon, now that school is beginning start. The roads will see a lot more traffic and there willl be lots of kids traveling to and from school on foot. And remember, school speed zones will be back in effect so keep an eye out and slow down when nearing a school zone.\n\nCell phone use is also restricted within school zones and texting while driving is always illegal in Arkansas.\n\nArkansans are also reminded that it is illegal to pass a stopped school bus in Arkansas.\n\nEvery day during the school year, more than 350,000 Arkansas children depend on school buses to transport them safely to and from school. These buses make multiple stops in every community.\n\nThe law requires drivers to stop on 2-lane and 4-lane highways in both directions, even those with a middle lane. Drivers cannot attempt to pass in any direction until the school bus vehicle has finished receiving or discharging its passengers and is in motion again.\n\nWhen a school bus comes to a halt and activates its flashing lights and stop arm, it is an indication that children are entering or exiting the bus. Remember: Flashing Red means Kids Ahead.\n\n87th annual Sevier County Fair underway 08/12/24\n\nDE QUEEN – It’s fair week in Sevier County!\n\nThe 87th annual Sevier County Fair and Rodeo kicked off Saturday with the poultry and rabbit shows, the first of many livestock shows scheduled throughout the week.

Registration begins at 9:00 a.m.\n\n“Regional auctions proved popular among our buyers last year, and we are continuing that process this year,” Commissioner of State Lands Tommy Land said. “This allows bidders to attend the auction for multiple counties with the convenience of a single event.\n\nAuctions are conducted alphabetically by county. Prospective bidders can find the Public Auction Catalog on the Commissioner’s website at www.cosl.org. The catalog includes auction date, time and locations and a complete listing of parcels offered. Bidders should review the buyer’s guide and statutes governing sales before coming to auctions.\n\nThe website also includes an instructional video demonstrating how to research information about each parcel available for sale.\n\n“We are reminding owners of tax-delinquent parcels that the redemption period changed in 2023,” Land said. “Parcels must be redeemed by 4 p.m. on the last business day before the sale date. We must receive the petition to redeem and the payment by that time.”\n\nAuction sales are final, he emphasized. “Parcels sold at auction cannot be redeemed.”\n\nBidders must register for the auction before placing a bid. Purchases may be paid for with a business or personal check, or a credit or debit card. Cash is not accepted for purchase of tax-delinquent parcels.\n\n“Property taxes help fund schools, roads, libraries and public services including ambulances,” Land said. “Everyone benefits from paying those taxes — and the property owner benefits from paying on time, by avoiding interest and penalties on delinquent taxes.”\n\nProperties that do not sell at auction will appear on the COSL’s post-auction sales list 30 days after the auction date. From there, they can be purchased through an online auction system. Another instructional video on the COSL website demonstrates that process to bidders.\n\nOwners of delinquent parcels may redeem those delinquent taxes online at www.cosl.org using a credit or debit card. Those who prefer to pay by check or money order can print a Petition to Redeem from the website or call the office at 501-324-9422 to request the petition, which must accompany their payment.\n\nOwners seeking to redeem within 30 days before an auction must use certified funds or may redeem with cash in our office at 1020 W. 4th Street in Little Rock. Cash is only accepted for redemption, and only for in-person payments at 1020 W. 4th Street.\n\nBrief reprieve from the heat expected this weekend; fire caution still urged 08/08/24\n\nDE QUEEN – A brief reprieve from the recent triple-digit heat appears to be on its way.\n\nForecasters with the National Weather Service are expecting temperatures to fall relatively sharply over the coming weekend, with a high of 94 on Friday, 89 on Saturday and 84 on Sunday.\n\nThe “cool front” follows more than a week of triple-digit temperatures and near-daily heat advisories. Heat index values are expected to reach 106 today before things cool off. A heat advisory is in effect through 8 p.m.\n\nThe highs creep back up into the mid-90s by the middle of next week, so the reprieve is likely to be a brief one. Unfortunately, the National Weather Service’s seven-day forecast has only a 20 percent chance of rain on Sunday.\n\nLocal emergency response officials are reminding the public to be extremely cautious when burning. Although no burn ban is currently in effect in the region, the heat and dry conditions pose a significant risk for fires to become out of control. If you suspect a fire has gotten out of control, call 911 immediately.\n\nEducation Building exhibit entries for Fair accepted beginning Sunday 08/08/24\n\nDE QUEEN – “A Tradition Worth Keeping.”\n\nThat's the theme of the 2024 Sevier County Fair and Rodeo. The livestock shows and rodeo are among the most exciting elements of the Sevier County Fair and Rodeo, but the Educational Building is among the most steeped in tradition.\n\nAmanda Mangum is the chairperson for the Educational Building at this year's Sevier County Fair and Rodeo. She's encouraging everyone to participate by entering their art, crafts, baked goods, horticulture, canned foods and other items for judging.\n\n“It's kind of a common misconception that you have to be in 4-H or FFA to enter something in the Educational Building, but you don't,” she said. “Anyone that's a Sevier County resident ages five and up can enter. We have baked goods and canning, vegetables you grow, even a flower in your yard. Painting and photography. It's a little bit of everything and I want that building to be full of the best of Sevier County.”\n\nWinners will receive a ribbon for their items and even a little money, she explained. Mangum once won Best of Show for her 91-pound watermelon.\n\n“That's the kind of stuff I loved about the fair and want to bring back and make really cool,” Mangum said.\n\nItems can be entered this Sunday from 2-5 p.m. at the Educational Building and again on Monday, Aug. 12 from 6-8 p.m. Baked goods and horticulture can be entered on Tuesday from 8-9 a.m.\n\n“There's still plenty of time and you can do anything,” said Mangum. “Starting Wednesday, Aug. 14, you can come in and it will all be judged.

It was Paul David Willis’s first first day leading the Horatio Lions, but the 36th first day of practice in his career.\n\nHe described Horatio’s first day as typical.\n\n“It wasn’t bad. We’re kind of getting our feet on the ground. It was kind of a typical first day,” he said. “We had a few kids who showed up in the summer but were not here today. That’s kind of disappointing.”\n\nWillis noted that the Lions had a core group who did summer running so overall they are in decent shape. “Strength wise, we’re pretty good. The thing is to get the kids to be better athletes.”\n\nHe said pre-season practice is a time of learning. “Learning how to be athletes, how to make a commitment, how to go full speed. If you take care of that, football will follow,” he explained.\n\nGoing full speed is a priority. “Some kids have too good a governor,” he said. “They don’t know what it’s like to go full speed every play.”\n\nOver the summer he introduced his offense and defense. “We’re staying real basic and fundamental. We’re learning the Wing T. There is a whole lot to it; we’re making progress,” the coach said. “With the Wing T, you can blend it to take advantage of whatever talent you have.”\n\nAll in all, the Lions got off to good start. “The coaches are doing a great job. “The kids buying into what we’re doing,” Willis said. “I’m pleased with effort, but not satisfied. I expect a little bit more every day.”\n\nThe Lions will practice in morning until school starts. They are set to scrimmage the Hornets at Mineral Springs Aug. 20.\n\nWillis has an invitation to Lion supporters: “Come out and watch anytime.”\n\nBody of missing Iowa man found in Gillham Lake; no foul play suspected 08/07/24\n\nGILLHAM LAKE – An Iowa man reported missing more than six months ago was discovered inside a car submerged in Gillham Lake this past weekend.\n\nThe body of 25-year-old Joshua Aaron Graham Caskey was found Sunday, Aug. 4 by the Howard County Sheriff’s Office. Authorities began an investigation after receiving a report of a car found in Gillham Lake. According to a news release issued by the police department in Winterset, Iowa, Howard County deputies were able to match human remains found inside the vehicle to Caskey.\n\nCaskey was initially reported missing in January after a welfare check was requested. Neither he nor his vehicle were located at his home. He was last seen driving in Mena on Jan. 19.\n\nAuthorities said no foul play is suspected at this time.\n\nGrants help De Queen Lake trail project move forward 08/07/24\n\nDE QUEEN LAKE – Efforts to build a mountain bike and hiking trail complex at De Queen Lake are getting a boost thanks to some recent donations.\n\nThis past Tuesday, Walmart presented a $2,700 check to the Friends of the De Queen Lake Trail to assist with the ongoing construction project. Lorena Branson, one of the lead volunteers with the trail project, said the group is extremely thankful for Walmart and its recent donation.\n\n“Absolutely, Randy Stepp, manager of our local Walmart in De Queen, has been just a full supporter for the trail, everything from these community grants he backs to supplying water and snacks for our volunteers,” said Branson.\n\nRandy Stepp has been manager of De Queen's Walmart for the past nine years. A self-described amateur mountain biker, Stepp has a background in outdoors recreation and was thrilled when the opportunity appeared for Walmart to assist with the local trail project.\n\n“A lot of people don't know my background, but I went to college for Parks and Recreation, so deep down I'm a Parks and Recreation kind of guy. Anything outdoors I really love,” he said. “When you look at the community having things that help with health and fitness and tourism, it's just a great thing. We've been involved with the trail project since its inception and this is our second grant we've given them plus store donations.”\n\nBranson said this latest donation is one of many ways the community has come together over the last couple of years to see the trail project advance.\n\n“We could not do it without the help of community members, individuals, the county… any time we've asked for help, people just come out of the woodwork,” she said.\n\nThe group was recently awarded more than $8,000 from the Arkansas Parks and Tourism Department. Last year the project received a $200,000 grant from the Arkansas Department of Transportation to enhance the multi-use aspect of the trail and bring it up to the standards of the International Mountain Biking Association.\n\nThanks to these recent grants – with more potentially on the way – the project's biggest need at this time is more volunteers.\n\n“We are going to be needing more volunteers especially once we get it officially opened in the spring of 2025,” she explained. “It's going to be a stellar trail when we get done.”\n\nWork is mostly completed along four to five miles of the trail complex. Eventually, the group hopes to connect around 40 miles of trails around De Queen Lake. Anyone interested in donating their time is invited to come out for one of the monthly trail days. Volunteers can stay informed on when those take place by following the Friends of the De Queen Lake Trail group on Facebook.\n\n“We don't have specific Saturdays because there is so much going on so we usually set it a month in advance,” she said. “But anyone can volunteer. We can always use volunteers and encourage everyone to follow us on Facebook or get with me and I'll get them in the right direction.”\n\nBranson said the trail offers great volunteer opportunities for local high school students, who are now required under state guidelines to earn 75 hours of community service before they graduate.\n\nOrganizers hope the trail will eventually serve as a tourism draw for Sevier County while also helping with the overall health and well-being of local residents.\n\n“I can see this trail being a huge tourism boost for Sevier County as well as the health benefits for this community,” said Branson. “I have big visions for this trail. We have 40-plus miles that have already been established by the International Mountain Biking Association. It's a multi-use trail, not just for bikers. We have some ideas for a skills park for kids to use, little jumps and some other features. The possibilities are endless for all kinds of events for Sevier County to bring people in.”\n\nThe project’s trailhead, which has been open to the public since the beginning, is located behind the bathrooms at Pine Ridge Campground on De Queen Lake.

And thanks to a fun new idea, everyone in the community has the chance to show off their excitement and earn a chance to win $100 and free dinner at the fair.\n\nThe Sevier County Fair Association has launched a “Rodeo Banner Selfie” competition. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Take a selfie with one of the many Sevier County Fair & Rodeo sponsor banners that are hanging around the county and post it to the Sevier County Fair and Rodeo Facebook page.\n\n2. Make sure to include your name and what business you visited to get the picture.\n\n3. Once you submit your photo and information, your name goes into a basket to win $100 and a burger basket from the fairgrounds concession stand.\n\n4. You must be present at the fair to win.\n\nEntries are due by 6 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 16 for that night's drawing. The rest will roll over to Saturday night and additional entries will be accepted through 6 p.m. that evening.\n\nThe public is allowed to submit one entry for each different location they visit, so be sure to check out multiple locations. The more locations you visit, the more chances to win!\n\nThe banners aren't hard to find. Look for the banners that read “Proud Sponsor of the Sevier County Fair & Rodeo, A Tradition that's Worth Keeping.”\n\nThanks to generous support from so many businesses, groups and individuals in Sevier County and the surrounding region, the banners are everywhere and provide lots of chances to win.\n\n“We couldn't put the fair on without all of our local sponsors,” said Amanda Mangum, an organizer with the Sevier County Fair and Rodeo. “So, if you're driving around town and you see these Sevier County Fair and Rodeo signs, get out, thank them for helping us put on this great event, and get out and take a selfie. Post it on our Facebook page and you'll be entered to win.”\n\nFor those not on Facebook, selfies can be submitted by texting the picture to Stephanie Haarmeyer at (870) 784-0133, Beth Wishard at (870) 582-2191 or Richard Van Voast at (870) 584-6587.\n\nNaloxbox installed at Horatio City Hall 08/07/24\n\nHORATIO – A recently-installed feature at Horatio City Hall is a local effort to combat the nationwide increase in overdose deaths.\n\nEarlier this summer, the Arkansas Behavioral Health Integration Network (ABHIN) installed what it calls a Naloxbox at City Hall on Horatio's Main Street. The box features the anti-overdose medication Naloxone, which has been hailed by health professionals as a “miracle” treatment to reverse the effects of a narcotics overdose.\n\nMegan Copeland, an elite peer specialist and project coordinator for ABHIN, said the box was installed as part of a federally-funded effort to address the nation's opioid epidemic, which resulted in more than 100,000 deaths in 2022.\n\n“We're trying to fight against the opioid epidemic so we are placing Naloxboxes in rural communities where they're most accessible so people can access Narcan,” she explained. “Naloxone is the drug name, Narcan is the brand name, so you may hear those interchangeably. Any time there is an opioid overdose you can use Narcan to revive someone.”\n\nNaloxone can rapidly reverse an opioid overdose by blocking the effects of the drug. It can quickly restore normal breathing to a person whose breathing has slowed or stopped because of an opioid overdose. The drug has no effect on someone who does not have opioids in their system nor is it a treatment option for substance abuse. Examples of opioids include heroin, fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone and morphine.\n\nCopeland said the drug can mean the difference between life and death for someone experiecing an opioid overdose.\n\n“Absolutely. Sometimes it may take multiple doses, but usually one dose will at least bring them back enough to save their lives,” she said.\n\nCopeland said ABHIN is hoping to saturate the state with easily-accessible Narcan in hopes it will reduce overdose deaths. She's cautiously optimistic the effort is beginning to work.\n\n“There were recently new numbers released that the effort we're making to saturate the state with Narcan is making a difference,” she explained. “We're starting to see those numbers lower. It's through education and prevention that we're seeing a difference.”\n\nNarcan is available to the public and can be purchased for approximately $45-50 dollars from stores like Walmart. However, through federal grant programs, it's being made available for free to the public.\n\n“The more we can give out the better,” said Copeland.\n\nThe Naloxbox at Horatio City Hall is accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week. ABHIN has also provided the Sevier County Sheriff's Office with additional units to replenish the local supply. Copeland asks that anyone who uses Narcan to stop an overdose then call the number featured on the medication's box to report it.\n\n“We don't need your personal information or anything like that, we're just trying to track where we're making a difference,” she said.\n\nFor more information on Narcan, Arkansas' fight against the opioid epidemic and additional resources, visit the Arkansas Behavioral Health Integration Network's website at www.abhinetwork.org. The group is also on Facebook, X and other social media platforms.\n\nSevier County 4-H'ers earn awards at State O'Rama 08/07/24\n\nFAYETTEVILLE – Eight Sevier County 4-H’ers competed against 4-H’ers from across Arkansas at the State 4-H O’Rama at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville July 23-26, 2024.\n\nTo qualify for state level, they had to compete at District 4-H O’Rama.\n\nEach youth got to experience the “college” life by staying on campus in dorms.

The trooper reported that a passenger in the vehicle attempted to conceal something.\n\nThe passenger was identified as 45-year-old Brint Chancellor. The trooper determined Chancellor had a search waiver through his parole conditions. During a search of Chancellor's person, the trooper allegedly discovered a bag of fentanyl, a bag of methamphetamine and another bag of fentanyl designed to mimic an oxycodone pill. In all, authorities claim Chancellor was in possession of 15 grams of fentanyl.\n\nHe was placed into custody and transported to the Sevier County Jail where he was charged with trafficking of a controlled substance and two counts of possession of a controlled substance with purpose to deliver.\n\nThe Ninth West Judicial Drug Task Force is warning Arkansans against picking up or handling any blue pill they find in a public area. They warn that traffickers are attempting to conceal their fentanyl by making it appear as a prescription oxycodone pill. Authorities said this deception is becoming “more popular and more deadly.”\n\nAnyone who sees a blue pill in a public area is asked to contact their sheriff's office or police department.\n\nOne gram of fentanyl is trafficking in Arkansas and can carry a sentence of 25-60 years or life in prison.\n\nTonight is National Night Out in De Queen 08/06/24\n\nDE QUEEN – Tonight is NNO in De Queen and organizers are hoping to provide an evening of fun, food and free school supplies.\n\nNational Night Out culminates annually on the first Tuesday in August and seeks to enhance the relationship between communities and those tasked with serving and protecting them.\n\nThe event is back this year thanks to a partnership between the Sevier County Sheriff’s Office, the De Queen Police Department and the broader community.\n\nThe event will take place from 6-8 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 6 at the De Queen Sportsplex.\n\nLocal civic groups, businesses and churches are invited to set up a booth at the event.

The real estate investment firm’s purchase includes three manufacturing sites and a solar farm, totaling 815,000 square feet, as detailed in a press release.\n\nThe financial details of the transaction remain undisclosed, and as of Wednesday morning, the sale had not been recorded on the Howard County property records website.\n\nThis acquisition occurs one year after Husqvarna’s announcement to close these facilities, aiming to consolidate operations and minimize its carbon footprint. The company, known for producing outdoor power equipment such as chainsaws, trimmers, cultivators, and mowers, intends to cease operations in Nashville by the end of 2024, impacting approximately 700 jobs and additional roles in local businesses supplying parts and labor to Husqvarna.\n\nNashville’s Mayor, Larry Dunaway, expressed the city’s intent to collaborate with Phoenix in securing a new occupant for the premises. The company is set to initiate a capital improvement strategy to draw premium industrial tenants to the region.\n\nMayor Dunaway is optimistic about future prospects, stating, “The City of Nashville is dedicated to fostering new industry and employment opportunities in our community.”\n\nAndreas Rangert, President of Husqvarna North America’s Forest & Garden Division, commented on the partnership with Phoenix Investors, a firm committed to revitalizing manufacturing sites. He conveyed confidence in Phoenix’s ability to stimulate growth and bring new prospects to Nashville, Arkansas, and its residents.\n\nPhoenix Investors holds a diverse portfolio of industrial properties, encompassing roughly 78 million square feet across 29 states. The company’s objective is to provide cost-effective, nationwide solutions to meet the leasing requirements of various corporations.\n\nVanessa Weeks, the director of Howard County Economic Development, extended a warm welcome to Phoenix in Nashville.\n\n“Their acquisition of the Husqvarna facility signifies the addition of a robust partner as we persistently market and attract industries to our community,” she stated. “I am eager to collaborate with them in the forthcoming weeks.”\n\nDe Queen Schools to construct $700,000 agri facility 08/05/24\n\nDE QUEEN – After several years of planning and months of bidding, the De Queen School District finally has a company lined up to construct its new animal science and agriculture facility.\n\nDuring its July meeting, the De Queen School Board voted to approve a $700,000 bid for the new facility from Altech, a Texarkana, Texas-based construction company.\n\nDe Queen Superintendent Jason Sanders said the facility has been a goal since he first came to the district.\n\n“I'm going into my seventh year here at De Queen and right from the beginning there was interest from the board in building a school farm and animal science facility at De Queen,” said Sanders. “We're very excited because this is something we've been working on for years and everything finally came together to make it happen.”\n\nGiven the importance of agriculture to Southwest Arkansas, Sanders said the animal science and school farm will provide some great opportunities for De Queen's students.\n\n“Agriculture is big here,” he said. “We want a way to open up more opportunities for our students in agriculture. At the same time, if there are students who don't have land or acreage, they might now be able to get into animal science and have an animal project.”\n\nSanders said a good financial year for De Queen Schools will allow the district to cover most of the cost of the project with savings from the current fiscal year.\n\nThe district hopes to have the new facility constructed by the end of the year.\n\nClasses resume at De Queen Aug. 12 08/05/24\n\nDE QUEEN – De Queen student will be returning to class in less than two weeks.\n\nMonday, Aug. 12 marks the first day of school for the De Queen School District. The summer has been a busy one for school personnel and administrators as they worked once again to prepare campus facilities for the start of school.\n\nThe 2024-25 school year will mark Superintendent Jason Sanders' seventh year with De Queen Public Schools and his 25th year overall in education. His wife, Ashley, is a speech therapist for the district. Together they have two kids attending De Queen Schools (they graduated a third, Micah, in 2022).\n\nAfter a tumultuous couple of years in education during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sanders said his goal this school year is to keep things consistent. He said the district has a great foundation based on strong facilities and financials. He anticipates another good year for De Queen.\n\n“We're one of the few schools in Southwest Arkansas that is actually growing. We're one of the top academic schools in Arkansas,” he said. “Last year we were recognized across the state with numerous academic and professional awards. We're home to the 2024 Arkansas Teacher of the Year, Beau McCastlain. We provide the opportunity for your students to earn an associate's degree before they graduate through the Leopard Launch program. We offer the most concurrent classes of any school in our area with 22 concurrent credit classes for college/high school dual credit.”\n\nSanders also highlighted some of the other programs and opportunities available at De Queen.\n\n“We have an onsite school medical clinic for students and staff, the Leopard Care Clinic, which has been instrumental for our students and employees in keeping them well and in school,” he said. “We're on pace to serve over 17,000 meals to children in our community this summer, which is huge. We offer unique programs such as Leopard Medical, Intro-to-Teaching, Pre-Engineering and DQTV.”\n\nThe district also offers quality career and technical programs in multiple areas. Last month, after more than a year of work, the district approved construction of a new $700,00 animal science facility to provide multiple learning opportunities for De Queen students.\n\nRegarding his goal to keep things consistent, Sanders said De Queen's theme doesn't change from year to year.\n\n“Our focus is always on academics, conduct and success,” he said. “We strive to be one of the top 25 academic schools in Arkansas. We stress to our kids that they do the right thing because doing the right thing will carry them a long way in life. We also want to offer our kids all the opportunities for success. When De Queen busses pull up, we are here to have success. It's important to let kids taste success. Then they will want to have the drive to have it in life. Success is contagious when it gets going.”\n\nSanders took a moment to thank several entities for their continued support of the district. That includes the school board, comprising Skip Bell, Sandy Huntsberger, Dr. Kenny Martin, Barry Reed and Tony Soto.\n\nHe also praised Athletic Director Richard Bell; Misty Gentry, Asst. Superintendent/Director of Federal Programs and K-5 Education; Lance Pinkerton, Asst. Superintendent/Director of Support Services and 6-12 Education; Carrie Rivas, testing coordinator and ESL; and Brandi Sharp, special education director.\n\nSanders said the district is lucky to have tremendous leaders among its campus principals:\n\n-Audrey Chandler, Jarrod Fannin and Murray Neely at De Queen High School\n\n-Jeff Holcombe and Ryan Hanney at De Queen Junior High\n\n-Brandon Lindly and Jonathan Lindsey at De Queen Middle School\n\n-Terri Phillips and Rachelle Runnels at De Queen Elementary\n\n-Amy Barker and Kayla Morris at De Queen Primary\n\nSanders said the district is also lucky to have the teachers it does.\n\n“They are the heartbeat of our school,” he said. “We have quality people, great communicators who care about the kids. “We also have great support directors and the school couldn't run without them. They include Food Service Director Lisa Atkins, Migrant Director Monique Angeles, HVAC Director Gerry Batty, District Business Manager Kendra Icenhower, Technology Director Nena Land, Chartwells Chef Brad Pereira, Transportation Director Todd Pinkerton and Maintenance Director Joe Vallee.”\n\nSanders personally thanked De Queen Police Chief Scott Simmons, Mayor Jeff Brown and the De Queen City Council for helping the district provide safety and security for De Queen students.\n\n“Thanks to them, I feel our Emergency Response Team and school safety plan is one of the best in Arkansas,” he said.\n\nOverall, Sanders said the district is excited to welcome its students back on Aug. 12.\n\n“We're ready to welcome them back for the 2024-25 school year and look forward to seeing them soon. Leopard Pride!”\n\nEquine virus detected in Ouachita County 08/05/24\n\nOUACHITA COUNTY – A positive case of Eastern Equine Encephalomyelitis (EEE) has been confirmed in Ouachita County.\n\nNo other horses were exposed to the infected horse. The Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Division’s Animal Health Section communicated with the primary party and notified other officials of active equine venues within the area.\n\nEastern Equine Encephalomyelitis is an extremely rare but serious and fatal infection that causes encephalitis, an acute inflammation of the brain. The disease is spread by biting insects, primarily mosquitoes and flies, that have bitten birds infected with the EEE virus. Insect control and vaccination are the recommended preventative measures.\n\nThis disease can infect a wide range of animals other than horses, including other mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. While humans can also contract the disease through biting insects, they cannot get the disease through direct contact with an infected animal.\n\nThe Arkansas Department of Agriculture’s Livestock and Poultry Division is urging owners to closely monitor their equine for early clinical signs, which include loss of appetite, decreased activity, and depression. Clinical signs can be subtle and progress to tremors, paralysis, altered mental state, and stumbling (ataxia). Some affected horses die within a few days. Surviving animals may have residual nerve deficits.\n\nThe disease is preventable through regular vaccinations and by developing a good pest management program. Owners should contact their regular veterinarian for more information and to report any nervous system signs. Those without a regular veterinarian should call the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Division at 501-225-1598 if any horses show clinical signs.\n\nState Rep. DeAnn Vaught weekly update: School bus safety 08/05/24\n\nAs the new school year approaches, law enforcement agencies are reminding Arkansas driver of the need to take extra caution during their daily commutes. Particularly, they’re reminded that it is illegal to pass a stopped school bus in Arkansas.\n\nEvery day during the school year, more than 350,000 Arkansas children depend on school buses to transport them safely to and from school. These buses make multiple stops in every community.\n\nThe fines, penalties, and punishment for anyone found guilty of illegally passing a stopped school bus were increased dramatically by Act 2128 of 2005, also known as Isaac’s Law. The legislation was named in memory of Isaac Brian, an elementary school student in the Bryant School District who was struck and killed when a driver illegally passed his school bus while students were exiting the vehicle.\n\nThe law requires drivers to stop on 2-lane and 4-lane highways in both directions, even those with a middle lane. Drivers cannot attempt to pass in any direction until the school bus vehicle has finished receiving or discharging its passengers and is in motion again.\n\nIn the 2021 Regular Session, the General Assembly passed Act 264 to clarify the distance and areas where drivers must stop. It states drivers must come to a complete stop no less than 30 feet from the bus when it stops to load or unload passengers. This 30-foot perimeter would apply to public roads, private or public property open to the general public, and any driveway or parking lot belonging to a public school.\n\nArkansans should also remember that the use of handheld wireless phones is prohibited in a school zone. In 2019, the General Assembly passed legislation making the use of a handheld phone in school zones a primary offense.\n\nWhen a school bus comes to a halt and activates its flashing lights and stop arm, it is an indication that children are entering or exiting the bus. Remember: Flashing Red means Kids Ahead.\n\nCoach Bell talks upcoming Leopards football season, summer training 08/01/24\n\nWhen August arrives and football practice begins in earnest, there will be several changes from the De Queen summer program.\n\nWorkouts will be held five days a week instead of four. The time will be moved from mornings to afternoons. Attendance will be mandatory — not that it has been a problem through the summer.\n\nHead Leopard coach Richard Bell requires attendance at 80 percent of the summer sessions. “Most of starting group didn’t miss a day unless it was for vacations or family stuff,” he said.\n\nDe Queen hosted three team camps, attended one at Mena as well as a 7 on 7 competition. “We have 44 on the team,” the coach said. “We had 39-40 at every team camp and the 7 on 7.”\n\nAll the Leopard prospects were able to get playing time at camp. “We got in probably 80 live reps, 40 offense and 40 defense, at each camp,” Bell noted.\n\nThere will be some offensive changes this season. “We’ve been in this offense for two years,” Bell said. “We’ve gotten to the point where we can expand it. We can branch out into a spread, single wing, a double tight set. There are nine formations. We went to seven on seven for the passing.”\n\nSenior Cole Binkley has been quarterbacking this offense since the seventh grade. “Cole can run it by himself. He knows every lineman, every block, where everybody is supposed to be,” Bell said.\n\nLeading rusher Ulycess Coto is back at the left back. Sophomore Draeden Bennett has been working at the right back. Bennett was the junior high fullback last year. “He’s gotten slimmer, gotten taller and gotten faster,” said Bell.\n\nTransfer Ryland Pickett looks to be the fullback. “The best thing about him is that he is a very smart kid. The fullback and quarterback have to be on the same page. I think that will work a lot better for us this year,” the coach said.\n\nIn the offensive line Jeremiah Coto is at center, Estaban Alvarez and Julio Soto at guards and Darren Henderson and Carlos Hernandez at the tackles. “Having coach (Tristan) Snider here has helped a lot,” Bell said. “There was a lot of improvement at team camps.”\n\nTrent Matthews and Lance Wise return as receivers. Also at the position will be 6-2, 185 sophomore John Maturino. “He’s very, very athletic. He can go up and get it,” Bell said.\n\nA big question for the Leopard offense is the return of Juan Penaloza who had knee surgery after being injured last season. We’re waiting for his release. It would be a big thing for us to have him on the offensive line,” Bell said.\n\nOn defense senior end Macaden Smith is healthy. At the other end Kyle Williamson, the Leopards’ sack leader last year has bulked up. “He’s up to 195-200.” said the coach. In the 3-4 alignment he switches to linebacker.\n\n“I’m looking for really big things from Zaiden Decasez at interior D line,” Bell said. “He was unstoppable in team camps.”\n\nThe D line should be anchored by Darren Henderson. “He’s 6-4, 315. He dead lifts 465 and bench presses 325 and he’s lost baby fat,” Bell said.\n\nLast season’s leading tackle Jake Martin returns at linebacker. Martin tied the De Queen school record of 18 tackles in a game. The record was set by current head coach Bell.\n\nThe most likely candidates to join Martin at linebacker are Wise and Rusty Bermeo. Coto and Matthews are back in the secondary.\n\n“It’s all going in the right direction,” Bell said. “We’re trying to build a culture.”\n\nLeopard Stadium was closed for several days for work on the playing surface of Bill Blackwood Field. Some parts of the lines marking the out of bounds border had been damaged, but repairs are covered by the turf’s warranty.\n\nHoratio returns to class Aug. 14 08/01/24\n\nHORATIO – The 2024-25 school year is sure to be an interesting one for Horatio Public Schools.\n\nThe district will return Aug. 14 with a brand-new four-day school schedule (more on that below). The Lions' athletic programs will also see some new leadership with Head Coach Paul David Willis, Head Lions Basketball Coach Chris Turner and Head Lady Lions Basketball Coach Blake Alexander. Horatio is also welcoming a new band director, Jacob Stover.\n\nThe upcoming school year also marks the second as superintendent for Gayla Youngblood. She became superintendent in 2023 and looks forward to leading the district for a second year.\n\n“I'm very excited,” she said. “I was nervous the first year because it was a big change. I've been in the school business for over 30 years and I thought I knew everything. I knew a lot, but found out pretty quickly that there were a whole lot of things that I had never dealt with in my building-level role. Thank goodness that there were so many folks taking care of a lot behind the scenes. I so appreciate the opportunity to serve in this role and I feel blessed I had so much support.”\n\nShe pointed out her superintendent mentor Jerry Strasner of the Ouachita School District.\n\n“He was outstanding and I was lucky to have him as a mentor when I became superintendent,” Youngblood said. “He's a lifelong buddy now and we talk all the time. All the area superintendents were awesome and I'm so thankful for their help settling in.”\n\n“Of course, the community welcomed me and so did our staff, and I'm so thankful for them as well,” she added. “I've known these folks for a long time, I taught a lot of them or taught with them. It's good people that make our school so strong. Going into the second year, I'm not a rookie anymore but I'm sure there's plenty of things that will still be new to me that I'm learning. It's been a blessing and an honor.”\n\nYoungblood said this past summer focused on a lot of building and facility improvements.\n\n“This summer we've done a lot of just general upkeep, some things that had needed some attention over time. We did a lot of power washing. Our surfaces look so much brighter, fresher. We've also done a major painting project in the fifth and sixth grade building, as well as some upgrades with security features, control access, cameras, shatter-resistant film for added safety. We're super excited about how things are looking and progressing.”\n\nYoungblood said the district is also focusing on its Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs.\n\n“We're trying to make sure that we've got the adequate resources that our students need and deserve,” she explained. “CTE, Pathways for Graduation, is a huge thing, trying to make sure that we offer the pathways that will help our students in their post-secondary endeavors to be able to have the best jobs in the future. You know, for a small school, we've got five different CTE pathways. We've got FACS, Nutritional Science. We've got Marketing. We've got Animal Science, Plant Science, and Structures. For a small school, we have a lot going on with CTE pathways that our kids really seem to enjoy, pathways that will help them get that job and that career after graduation.”\n\nYoungblood said its vital students are engaged with their lesson plans and see the usefulness of what they're taught.\n\n“We're really excited about increasing our student engagement with our lessons. We've invested in some new curriculum that we're super excited about,and we just think the students are going to enjoy that and are going to be super engaged,” she explained. “We want our kids to be motivated and we want them to see the relevance of what they do in the classroom.”\n\nThe upcoming school year at Horatio will also include a focus on limiting screen time and a teacher-centered classroom environment.\n\n“We're really committed to a reduction in screen time,” she said. “Now, we love the fact that we're one-to-one with iPads, and we think it's a very helpful resource, a tool, but it's just that. It's a tool. And, you know, as far as students on their devices goes, if they're creating something, hey, we're here for that.\n\n“We want them to be creators, but as far as just being a consumer, we are going to very much limit their screen time. We just want to be real careful to make sure that we're using a lot of different formats for instruction. And we think our students are ready for a reduction of the screen time because, I'm just telling you, nothing will replace a good teacher at the board with direct instruction. Nothing can replace a great teacher.”\n\nYoungblood said she and the entire district are excited to welcome back students Aug. 14.\n\n“This is always such a fun time, making sure the campuses and teachers are ready to welcome the next group of students,” she said. “We all love this time of year even if it's a little scary at first, getting everyone used to new schedules and all that. But, you know, we've got a great little school, a great small town, and a great family atmosphere. We're really looking forward to the school year!”\n\nHoratio entering 2024-25 school year with new four-day schedule 08/01/24\n\nHORATIO – The Horatio School District is transitioning to a four-day school week this upcoming school year as part of a growing movement to redesign how education is provided to students in Arkansas.\n\nThe Horatio School Board voted to accept the recommendation earlier this year. Beginning with the 2024-25 school year, Horatio students will attend class Tuesday through Friday. The district has released a revised calendar detailing the four-day school week as well as scheduled breaks, holidays and staff professional development days. The first day of school under the new schedule is Aug. 14 with the last day May 16.\n\nThe new school day will begin at 7:50 a.m. on both the Horatio Elementary and Horatio High School campuses. The elementary school will dismiss at 4:08 p.m. and at 4:18 p.m. on the high school campus, under the new schedule.\n\nHoratio Superintendent Gayla Youngblood approached the school board earlier this year with information on other options Arkansas schools are using to shape their calendar. A 2021 Arkansas law gave school districts flexibility in choosing their calendars – ranging from the traditional format to hybrid, year-round models. Currently 38 of Arkansas' approximately 240 school districts utilize the four-day week calendar. Youngblood asked the board if it felt a similar change would be beneficial at Horatio.\n\n“Horatio to my knowledge has always had a traditional calendar,” said Youngblood. “But there are other options. We went through some of those and paired with that information, the board asked if there would be any support from students, staff and the community. It started purely as an investigative process. Then we realized it could be an option for us, the best choice for our district, if the community, students and staff were on board.”\n\nThe district began surveying students, families and staff. Youngblood said those survey results showed a strong interest in transitioning to the four-day calendar.\n\n“About 73 percent of staff were in support,” explained Youngblood. “After that, we started surveying parents and guardians. We know that a four-day calendar has a lot of considerations with child care, the length of the school day and food insecurity. But we felt the community would have the last word on whether this would work for their families, because that's why we're here. About 71 percent of parents and guardians that took the survey were in favor. We took it to the students and 81 percent of students surveyed were in favor.”\n\nYoungblood said her research into the four-day calendar, alongside discussions with superintendents of districts already using the nontraditional format, highlighted a number of benefits. Some of the key motivations are improving teaching and learning with longer lesson cycles per class session, incentivizing attendance for staff and students, retaining and recruiting staff members particularly in critical shortage areas such as upper-level math and science, and financial savings for the district given a decline in student enrollment following the COVID-19 pandemic. The day off will also allow students and staff time to schedule appointments and allow high school students to gain an extra day of employment. Similarly, professional development days for faculty members could be scheduled on Mondays without impacting the regular school week.\n\n“With all of that in mind, the board took our research, discussions with other schools and decided this was a good option for us,” said Youngblood. “What we found through our research is that it isn't just dependent on the calendar for academic and achievement scores. It's really what you do with the time that matters the most. The calendar doesn't make the school. It's important, but it's really what you do with that time.”\n\nYoungblood stressed that the change is not permanent. The district will review the new calendar next spring to determine how the four-day week is impacting student academics as well as staff and families at Horatio.\n\n“We will collect feedback in the spring to gauge the success of the four-day calendar and we'll make adjustments all the way through,” she explained. “We'll see how it fits Horatio's needs and really tailor this to our district. We'll reevaluate every year just like normal and if this isn't what's best for our school, we'll pivot to another option.”\n\nAlthough the week will run from Tuesday to Friday, several optional Mondays are scheduled throughout the year for tutoring, enrichment and other student activities.\n\nDe Queen's National Night Out is Aug. 6; donations still needed 08/01/24\n\nDE QUEEN – Law enforcement agencies are teaming up next week for what they hope is their biggest operation of the summer: feeding and donating backpacks full of school supplies to hundreds of local kids during National Night Out on Aug. 6.\n\nNational Night Out culminates annually on the first Tuesday in August and seeks to enhance the relationship between communities and those tasked with serving and protecting them.\n\nSevier County first participated in the nationwide event in 2016 under then-Sheriff Benny Simmons. No one at the time knew how it would turn out. Results greatly exceeded expectations. Around 3,000 people turned out.\n\nThe event is back this year thanks to a partnership between the Sevier County Sheriff’s Office, the De Queen Police Department and the broader community.\n\nThe event will take place from 6-8 p.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 6 at the De Queen Sportsplex.\n\nLocal civic groups, businesses and churches are invited to set up a booth at the event. Organizers stressed there is no cost for vendors. However, they’re asked not to sell anything and only provide free items or information.\n\nPilgrim's has already committed to providing hotdogs for the event while Dr. Randy Walker's Clinic will be offering health services to local kids ahead of the start of school. LifeShare will set up its mobile blood donation site at the event.\n\nThe main goal is to provide everything to attendees at absolutely no cost.\n\n“We want this to be completely free, the type of thing you can come to and leave your wallet behind,” said Sevier County Sheriff Robert Gentry.\n\nAs in previous years, organizers will focus on providing backpacks filled with school supplies to local children. Anyone wanting to donate items can drop them off at the Sevier County Sheriff's Office on Robinson Road or the De Queen Police Department at City Hall. Organizers said many items are still needed in the few days before National Night Out.\n\nFor more information on this year's National Night Out in Sevier County, call the sheriff's office at (870) 642-2125 or the DQPD at (870) 642-2213.\n\nDrop off locations for donations are featured at the sheriff’s office, police department, Simple Simon’s Pizza and Tri-Lakes Realty.\n\nDMS teacher Tammy Lites is regional finalist for Arkansas Teacher of the Year 07/31/24\n\nDE QUEEN – For the second year in a row, a De Queen educator has been recognized as one of the top in Arkansas.\n\nThe Arkansas Department of Education recently announced Tammy Lites, a math teacher at De Queen Middle School, is one of just 14 Arkansas educators selected as regional finalists for the 2025 Arkansas Teacher of the Year. Lites was recognized earlier this year as both the 2024 De Queen Middle School Teacher of the Year and overall De Queen School District Teacher of the Year.\n\nLites, as well as the 13 other regional finalists, will be recognized Aug. 5 at the Governor’s Mansion.\n\n“Each of these educators represents some of the best in teaching for Arkansas,” ADE Secretary Jacob Oliva said. “I congratulate each on achieving this honor and look forward to continued excellence from them both inside and outside the classroom.”\n\nThe regional finalists listed below will each receive a certificate and a $1,000 prize provided by the Walton Family Foundation.\n\nThe De Queen School District has been well represented recently within the Arkansas Teacher of the Year program. Beau McCastlain, communications director and DQTV Instructor at De Queen High School, was named the 2024 Arkansas Teacher of the Year. His selection included trips to the White House, the U.S. Space & Rocket Center, discussions at the state capitol and other special events. His tenure as Arkansas Teacher of the Year will continue through next summer.\n\nThe Arkansas Teacher of the Year program participates in the National Teacher of the Year program and recognizes Arkansas educators for their outstanding teaching and leadership skills. During the recognition event on August 5, the department will announce the four state semi-finalists from among the regional finalists. One will be named the 2025 Arkansas Teacher of the Year this fall.\n\nTo learn more about the program, visit dese.link/ATOY.\n\nSevier County Rodeo Royalty contest is Saturday 07/31/24\n\nDE QUEEN – The 87th annual Sevier County Fair and Rodeo is still a week and a half away, but some of the traditional activities are already in full swing.\n\nThat includes the 2024 annual Sevier County Rodeo Royalty competition. Orientation was held this past Saturday. The competition will be held this Saturday, Aug. 3 beginning at 7:30 p.m. at the Sevier County Fairgrounds. The public is invited to attend.\n\nThis year’s competitors include Braylee James, Bryndle James, Macie Icenhower, Addison Lamb, Faithlynn Sharp, Lola Mangum, Raegan Frachiseur, Kyleigh Midgett, Lilly Stivers and 2023 Sevier County Rodeo Princess Harper Young.\n\nThe Sevier County Fair and Rodeo will officially kick off Aug. 10 and continue through Aug. 17 at the Sevier County Fairgrounds. Check out the Aug. 8 edition of The De Queen Bee for lots more info on this year’s 87th annual Sevier County Fair and Rodeo.\n\nSevier County residents encouraged to take survey 07/31/24\n\nDE QUEEN – Local economic development officials are reminding residents there’s just a few days left to participate in a survey and share their thoughts on the needs of Sevier County.\n\nThe county has seen a lot of developments in recent years, from a new hospital to permitting alcohol sales to an encouraging growth in the county’s small business sector. The survey is asking Sevier County residents to share their thoughts on what’s needed in the county to continue to progress. Feedback is needed to help identify what priorities Sevier County can focus on to improve the community and contribute to long-term economic stability and prosperity.\n\nNeeds can range from more industry and entertainment to more opportunities to increase tourism to Sevier County.\n\nThe survey takes approximately eight to 10 minutes to complete. Responses will remain anonymous. Currently the survey is available in both English and Spanish. The deadline to submit responses is Aug. 6.\n\nThe survey is being hosted by the FRIENDS Foundation of Sevier County.\n\nTo participate, visit www.engage.atlascostudios.com/ and scroll down to the “What We’re Working On…” section. The link to the Sevier County survey should be listed in the second box. The direct link is also available here.\n\nAllen Road included for improvement project through state program 07/31/24\n\nDE QUEEN – A Sevier County road is scheduled to get some improvements this month thanks to funding from the Arkansas Unpaved Roads Program (AURP).\n\nAllen Road east of De Queen and north of Highway 70/71 is scheduled for work between Aug. 5-23. The road is one of nine projects across the state sharing a total of $558,756 in funding through the AURP.\n\nDrivers who commute on Allen Road are advised and recommended to take an alternate route during construction period.\n\nAccording to the AURP, the program’s goals are to fund safe, efficient and environmentally sound projects for the maintenance of dirt and gravel roads identified as sources of sediment or dust. The program also trains road maintenance professionals on techniques of dirt and gravel road maintenance that minimize negative impacts to water and air quality.\n\n“Nearly 50 percent of all public roads in Arkansas are unpaved and this program is an essential tool to fund safe, efficient improvement projets while training road maintenance professionals on best management practices,” said Wes Ward, Arkansas Secretary of Agriculture.\n\nThrough the program state crews will also conduct demonstrations of new and innovative techniques of dirt and gravel road construction and maintenance to assist in training road crews and more broadly share best management practices.\n\nEroding unpaved roads can channel rainfall-runoff, increasing erosion and sediment delivery to our streams, rivers, and lakes.\n\nThis sediment can have adverse effects on both people and nature. It can fill in gravel stream beds, causing the loss of in-stream habitat for game and non-game fish and other aquatic species alike, make freshwater sources more expensive to treat for drinking water, and ultimately contribute to the loss of lake capacity, further jeopardizing these drinking water sources. Economies that depend on recreational fishing and boating may also suffer from degraded water quality.\n\nEroding unpaved roads are expensive to maintain, requiring continual grading to smooth out the effects of concentrated drainage flowing across the road surface. Problem roads can also cause excessive wear and tear on vehicles and contribute to high levels of road dust, a significant issue in many rural areas.\n\nSince its inception in 2015, the program has provided nearly $9 million in county, state and federal funding for 64 projects in 25 Arkansas counties.\n\nSevier County Chamber board sets dates for events 07/31/24\n\nDE QUEEN – The Board of Directors of the Sevier County Chamber of Commerce met July 24 in the newly-remodeled offices in downtown De Queen.\n\nTreasurer Fernando Balderas reported the Chamber completed the building remodel at a cost of $103,172. The Chamber has received contributions from the FRIENDS organization, businesses, and individuals totaling $43,600 to help retire the loan for the renovations. Approximately $60,000 in contributions are still needed. Community businesses are encouraged to donate today by stopping by the Chamber offices on Stilwell Avenue.\n\nAnother $10,346 in furniture and equipment was also purchased for the building. Those monies came through the Community Navigator and Create Bridges grants.\n\nBoard member Ned Hendrix and Horatio State Bank have agreed to donate a printer for the Small Business Studios space. Board member Mike Branson contributed a storage building for use behind the Chamber offices.\n\nIn other business, Executive Director Suzanne Babb reported that the annual Denim and Diamonds event will be held October 12 at the Rocky Hill Event Center. Early Bird tickets will soon be available for $65. Tickets will cost $75 at the door. 250 tickets will be available.\n\nThe annual Christmas Parade is set for December 7 in downtown De Queen. Santa announced that the theme for this year’s parade will be: “Christmas Movies”.\n\nThe Chamber Board voted to print 8,000 City/County color maps, which will represent the first map update since 2018. Billy Ray McKelvy will coordinate the map project for the Chamber. Formax Company of Missouri was awarded the low bid for printing the maps at a cost of $4,854. Advertisements will be sold on the maps to help cover the costs.\n\nThe Chamber Board also voted to accept a $5,800 grant to organize a Civics Bee Fair, sponsored by the Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce. Students in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grades at county schools will have an opportunity to submit an essay on Civics. The top 20 essays will be chosen and those students will not only win a Tablet but also earn the opportunity to compete in a Civics Bee Fair, similar to a Spelling Bee, but with civics and government-related questions. The local winner advances to state and national competitions to compete for more prize money. The Chamber hopes to begin the essay process at county schools in August.\n\nExecutive Director Suzanne Babb reported that the Chamber is now 164 members strong, with 39 businesses signing up for the first time in 2024.\n\nMissing Mineral Springs teenager found safe 07/30/24\n\nMINERAL SPRINGS – Autumn Nicole Lyon, the Mineral Springs 16-year-old reported missing by statewide authorities on Monday, was found safe today shortly before noon.\n\nAutumn had been reported missing from Mineral Springs in Howard County on Saturday, July 27. She was last seen with 30-year-old Adrian Garces, who was taken into custody in Texas last night. He has been charged with Interference with Custody and is awaiting extradition back to Arkansas.\n\nDetails will be released as they become available.\n\nArkansas Sales Tax Holiday is this weekend 07/30/24\n\nSchool is just around the corner for most Arkansas kids and Arkansas’ annual sales tax holiday is this weekend to help their parents save some money on getting them ready.\n\nThis year, tax-free weekend in Arkansas is this Saturday, Aug. 3, and Sunday, Aug. 4.\n\nAccording to the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration, the weekend begins exactly at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 3 and ends at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday, Aug. 4.\n\nThe list of items eligible during tax-free weekend includes electronic devices used commonly by students like computer monitors, cell phones, laptops, and e-readers. Electronics that qualify don't have a price limit. As always, school supplies, clothes, and clothing items are also exempt.\n\nAnd there’s even more on the list, like diapers and briefcases.\n\nAlong with buying tax-free in local stores, this applies to online shopping, no matter what store or site as long as you are shipping the item to an Arkansas address.\n\nTax-free weekend in Arkansas began after a law was passed in 2011 calling for a sales tax holiday every year during the first weekend of August. This is a time when families can shop for school without the burden of paying taxes on items, particularly school supplies, clothing, and more things related to classes.\n\nBoth state and local sales taxes aren't collected or paid during that time.\n\nFor clothing and footwear, as long as the sales price is less than $100 per item, they would be considered to be eligible. Clothing accessories however have to be under $50. Most, if not all the school supply items you can imagine, qualify, along with electronic devices “commonly used by a student in the course of study,” the DFA says. Here's the full itemized list of tax-free items that qualify.\n\nA frequent question regards online purchases. If the item is purchased online during tax free weekend it will be tax-free if the shipping destination is in Arkansas (the item can arrive at any time).\n\nArkansas Senator Jimmy Hickey speaks to De Queen Rotary 07/30/24\n\nDE QUEEN – At the July 29 De Queen Rotary Club meeting, District Four State Senator Jimmy Hickey, Jr. rec"
