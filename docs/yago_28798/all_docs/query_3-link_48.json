        "meta_description": "Actor John Cleese has shocked people by joking during a chat show that he wishes \"one or two\" of his ex-wives were dead.\n\tThe 77-year-old comedian has been married four times and paid out over USD 30 million in divorce settlements. He now thinks that it would have been better if some of them had gotten strucked by a falling tree, reported Femalefirst.\n\t\"I have been married for 34 years. To four different wives. One of my ex-wives died, did you know that? It was very sad because it was the wrong one,\" he said.\n\tClarifying his statement, he further said, \"No, no (I have no anger toward them). I'd be quite happy if one or two of them were dead, but I have nothing against them. I don't have anything against them as people.\n\t\"You wish them dead in the nicest possible way. In the nicest possible way, yes. And not slow, agonising death, sort of drawn out over many many years or anything like that. Something quick like a tree falling on them.",
