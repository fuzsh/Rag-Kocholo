        "text": "\"I was even more surprised to read that John intends to write and to perform in it together with his daughter Camilla.\"\n\nShe added that she wished Cleese and his daughter well, despite having been taken aback by the way she found out about the project.\n\nLast week it was revealed that John is set to return to screens as Basil Fawlty, with a reboot of the star's famous comedy Fawlty Towers in the works.\n\nThe second and final series ended more than 40 years ago but Monty Python actor John, 83, is writing new episodes of the former BBC programme with his comedian daughter Camilla Cleese, 39.\n\nThe question overlooked the BBC’s celebration of the iconic comedy, including the broadcast of the first episode of Monty Python’s Flying Circus, to mark its 50th anniversary in 2019.\n\nJohn Hoare, a TV playout director, replied to John, reminding him of the night dedicated to Python on the BBC.\n\n“I sat in BBC Two’s press suite on the 7th of September 2019, prepped an episode of Monty Python for transmission as part of an evening of Python-related programmes, and then put it on air, if that helps,” Hoare said.\n\nJohn’s tweet also did not mention rights deals done for the Monty Python back catalogue.\n\nThe show and movies, including Monty Python and the Holy Grail, all stream on Netflix in the UK."
