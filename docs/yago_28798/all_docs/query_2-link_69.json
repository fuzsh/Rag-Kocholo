        "text": "Despite only running for two series, Fawlty Towers is immortalised in British culture with some iconic one-liners and even more iconic characters.\n\nThe plot is focused on the rude and stubborn owner of a poorly managed hotel, Basil Fawlty (John Cleese), his bossy wife Sybil (Prunella Scales), the sensible chambermaid Polly (Connie Booth) and the hapless Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs).\n\nThe first series aired 46 years ago in 1975, but chances are you'll have seen these famous faces of your screens more recently.\n\nCHECK OUT: Fawlty Towers cast - where are they now?\n\nGallery\n\nFawlty Towers cast - where are they now?\n\n1 of 4\n\nCREDIT: Getty\n\nJohn Cleese (Basil Fawlty)\n\nJohn Cleese became a household name with in the 1970s with Monty Python and Fawlty Towers. Not only did he star in Fawlty Towers, John also co-wrote the series with his wife Connie Booth. Since then he's starred in numerous films and TV shows including Harry Potter as Nearly Headless Nick and The Pink Panther 2 as Chief-Inspector Charles Dreyfus.\n\n2 of 4\n\nCREDIT: Getty\n\nPrunella Scales (Sybil Fawlty)\n\nSince starring on Fawlty Towers, Prunella Scales is now a BAFTA Award nominee after her star turn in Alan Bennett's A Question of Attribution. She's now 89 years old but Prunella regularly appears on our TV screens, most recently with her husband, actor Timothy West (Gentleman Jack), in the heart-warming show Great Canal Journeys.\n\n3 of 4\n\nCREDIT: Getty\n\nAndrew Sachs (Manuel)\n\nBefore Andrew Sachs sadly died at the age of 86 in 2016, he was best known for playing the hilarious butler in Fawlty Towers but you may also have seen him in Coronation Street as Ramsay Clegg or EastEnders as Cyril Bishop.\n\n4 of 4\n\nCREDIT: Getty\n\nConnie Booth (Polly Sherman)\n\nBefore retiring from acting in 1995, aged 55 in order to become a psychotherapist, Connie Booth worked alongside her then husband John Cleese in numerous shows including Fawlty Towers (which she co-wrote with him) and Monty Python.\n\nThey have been busy.\n\nWATCH: Emma Kennyâ€™s Mood Boosting Tips\n\nIn 2013, the BBC edited the Major's (played by Ballard Berkley) use of racial slurs from a repeat transmission of the episode, prompting some criticism by viewers. The BBC defended its decision, \"We are very proud of Fawlty Towers and its contribution to British television comedy.\n\nJohn Cleese was one of the individuals who wasn't impressed with the decision saying, \"I would have hoped that someone at the BBC would understand that there are two ways of making fun of human behaviour.\n\n\"One is to attack it directly. The other is to have someone who is patently a figure of fun, speak up on behalf of that behaviour. \""
