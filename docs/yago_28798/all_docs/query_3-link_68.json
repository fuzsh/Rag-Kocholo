        "text": "It’s been 46 years since Fawlty Towers first aired on TV, making legends of the cast – but where are John Cleese and Prunella Scales now?\n\nHow old are they? And will they ever be seen onscreen together again?\n\nHere’s everything you need to know!\n\nRead more: Caroline Aherne at the BBC viewers in tears as fans remember late ‘comedy genius’\n\nJohn Cleese and Prunella Scales now: What is John Cleese doing?\n\nComedian and actor John is still very much actively involved in the entertainment business.\n\nIn fact, he hasn’t stopped working since 1967.\n\nOn March 20, fans can listen to John and US comic Rob Schneider on a live stream full of “silliness, sketches and lots of laughs”.\n\nIn September 2020, he published a new book called Creativity: A Short and Cheerful Guide, which followed his 2015 autobiography So, Anyway…\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, John joined fellow Monty Python star Eric Idle for a tour of North America, Canada and the ANZUS nations.\n\nJohn wrote Bang Bang! in 2017, a new adaptation of Georges Feydeau’s French play Monsieur Chasse! for the Mercury Theatre, Colchester.\n\nHe’s still a prolific TV and film actor, too.\n\nIn 2021, John portrays Mr Bridwell in the upcoming family movie Clifford the Big Red Dog.\n\nHe’ll also appear as Dr. Auyeung in existential drama The Martini Shot, John Christmas in Father Christmas Is Back and Lionel in Wedding of the Year.\n\nHe is also filming One Night in Bath, and Let My Country Be!\n\nOn 2019, John joked he wasn’t planning to retire any time soon because “his former wives couldn’t afford it”.\n\nHow old is John Cleese now?\n\nJohn Marwood Cleese was born on October 27 1939 in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.\n\nHe is currently 81 years old.\n\nRead more: Line Of Duty new series: Martin Compston promises new episodes will ‘answer big questions’\n\nIs John Cleese married? Does he have kids?\n\nJohn Cleese has been married to fourth wife English jewellery designer and former model Jennifer Wade since 2012.\n\nHis first wife was Fawlty Towers co-star Connie Booth, to whom he was married between 1968 and 1978.\n\nIn 1971, Connie gave birth to their only child, Cynthia Cleese, who went on to appear with her father in his films A Fish Called Wanda and Fierce Creatures.\n\nConnie and John were actually divorced before the second series of Fawlty Towers was finished and aired.\n\nHe married US actress Barbara Trentham in 1981, but they divorced in 1990.\n\nJohn married his third wife Alyce Eichelberger in 1992, and it remains his longest marriage.\n\nHe and psychotherapist Alyce divorced in 2008.\n\nJohn has two children, Cynthia with Connie Booth, and Camilla was born in 1984 during his marriage to Barbara.\n\nHe also has two grandchildren, Evan and Olivia, through his eldest daughter’s marriage to the writer and director Ed Solomon.\n\nWhat does Prunella Scales do now? Does she have dementia?\n\nPrunella Scales has largely retired from public life.\n\nIn March 2014, Prunella’s husband Timothy West told The Guardian that she was living with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nThe couple discussed practical measures in a radio programme about age and dementia on BBC Radio 4 in December 2014.\n\nIn June 2018, her husband characterised her short-term memory as “no good at all”.\n\nHe admitted her condition “slowed them down”, but “not so it closes up opportunities”.\n\nThe pair appeared in Great Canal Journeys for Channel 4 from 2014 to 2019, charting her life with dementia.\n\nPrunella’s last acting role was as Madame in the 2014 short film Sub Rosa.\n\nHer last significant role was as Great Aunt Greta in Horrid Henry: The Movie in 2011.\n\nWho is Prunella Scales’ husband?\n\nPrunella has been married to Last Tango in Halifax actor Timothy West since 1963.\n\nTim and Prunella met on the set of a TV costume drama.\n\nHe had been briefly married before and had a daughter, Juliet.\n\nIn 1987, the married couple appeared together in the BBC production of What the Butler Saw.\n\nPrunella played Mrs Prentice, opposite Tim’s Doctor Rance.\n\nIn 2003, Prunella appeared as Hilda, “she who must be obeyed”, the wife of Horace Rumpole in four BBC Radio 4 plays, with Timothy West playing her fictional husband.\n\nIn January 2020, the pair were forced to quit TV show Great Canal Journeys due to her ailing health.\n\nTim’s career is still blooming.\n\nSoap fans might recognise him best for playing Albert Square patriarch Stan Carter in EastEnders until 2015.\n\nMore recently, he was landowner Jeremy Lister in BBC1’s period drama Gentleman Jack.\n\nJohn Cleese and Prunella Scales now: Who is Prunella Scales’ son?\n\nPrunella and Timothy have two sons together, including All Creatures Great and Small actor Samuel West.\n\nTheir younger son Joseph, a translator, took part in two episodes of Great Canal Journeys filmed in France.\n\nPrunella also has a step-daughter, Juliet, by Timothy West’s first marriage.\n\nJohn Cleese and Prunella Scales now: How old is Prunella Scales?\n\nPrunella Margaret Rumney Illingworth was born on June 22 1932 in Sutton Abinger, Surrey.\n\nShe is currently 88 years old.\n\nWhy was Fawlty Towers axed?\n\nActors and co-writers John Cleese and Connie Booth both quit the show before the third season – possibly because of their failed marriage.\n\nShe was said to be unwilling to be involved and practically retreated from public life after the first series finished.\n\nShe was initially unwilling to collaborate on a second series, which explains the four-year gap between productions.\n\nFor 30 years, Connie Booth declined to talk about Fawlty Towers until she agreed to participate in a documentary about the series for the digital channel Gold in 2009.\n\nAndrew Sachs, who played Manuel in the series, sadly died in November 2016.\n\nFawlty Towers is repeated from Monday March 15 2021 on BBC One and 8.30pm"
