        "text": "John Cleese, 72, was born in Weston-super-Mare. At Cambridge University, he studied law and joined the Footlights, where he met Graham Chapman. In the late 60s, he formed the Monty Python troupe with Chapman, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam. Cleese went on to further success as Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers, which he wrote with his then wife, Connie Booth. In 1988, Cleese wrote and starred in the hit movie, A Fish Called Wanda. His latest film, Spud, is out on DVD. Cleese recently married for the fourth time and lives in Monaco.\n\nWhen were you happiest?\n\nThere are different kinds of happiness, but the simplest was when I was 13 because what one had to do was so obvious.\n\nWhat is your greatest fear?\n\nLack of meaning.\n\nWhich living person do you most admire, and why?\n\nMichael Frayn – such modesty, talent, kindness and bottomless curiosity.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in yourself?\n\nCowardice. I have several times made a poor choice by avoiding a necessary confrontation.\n\nWhat is the trait you most deplore in others?\n\nLack of kindness.\n\nProperty aside, what's the most expensive thing you've bought?\n\nA trip down the Nile for 45 friends.\n\nWhat is your most treasured possession?\n\nA teddy bear that belonged to Genghis Khan.\n\nWhat do you most dislike about your appearance?\n\nThe signs of the approach of death.\n\nIf you could bring something extinct back to life, what would you choose?\n\nDad, Peter Cook, David Hatch and Harry Secombe.\n\nWhat is your favourite book?\n\nConfessions Of A Philosopher, by Bryan Magee.\n\nWhere would you like to live?\n\nI'm still trying to work that out.\n\nWhat would be your fancy dress costume of choice?\n\nJeans and a cotton polo shirt, or a Hungarian Hussar's uniform.\n\nWhat is the worst thing anyone's ever said to you?\n\nAre you Michael Palin?\n\nCat or dog?\n\nI'm a vegetarian (according to Wikipedia, which is wrong) so… cat.\n\nWhat is your guiltiest pleasure?\n\nAssisting at major surgeries.\n\nWhat do you owe your parents?\n\n£182.07.\n\nTo whom would you most like to say sorry, and why?\n\nMy dad. I was once very unkind to him. Sorry, Dad.\n\nWhat was the best kiss of your life?\n\nMYOB. Anyway, it's dead now.\n\nHave you ever said 'I love you' and not meant it?\n\nOnly once (to Jeffrey Archer).\n\nWhich living person do you most despise, and why?\n\nMurdoch. He did irreparable damage to English culture.\n\nWhich words or phrases do you most overuse?\n\nGynaecological ones.\n\nWhat single thing would improve the quality of your life?\n\nMore energy.\n\nWhat song would you like played at your funeral?\n\nTchaikovsky's 1812, sung by Barry Manilow.\n\nHow would you like to be remembered?\n\nAs John Cleese.\n\nTell us a joke.\n\nA grasshopper hops into a bar and on to a stool. The bartender says, \"We've got a drink named after you.\" The grasshopper says, \"What, Norman?\""
