        "text": "Monty Python legend John Cleese has tied the knot for the fourth time following an acrimonious divorce from his last wife.\n\nDespite once joking that his friends would \"knee-cap\" him if he tried to walk down the aisle again, the 72-year-old wed Jennifer Wade, who at the age of 41 is three decades his junior, on the island of Mustique.\n\nCleese, who signed a deal with Hello! magazine, said: \"I couldn't imagine being with anyone but Jenny. And with my record that's a remarkable thing to say.\"\n\nHis new wife is a former model and jewellery designer from Bath. She wore a pale pink satin gown while he wore a grey suit and white shoes.\n\nThe comedian is said to have \"fought back tears\" during the vows.\n\nCleese has previously been married to his Fawlty Towers co-star and co-writer Connie Booth, Barbara Trentham and Alice Faye Eichelberger who are all from the US.\n\nHis divorce from Eichelberger was a famously expensive one, costing him Â£12m. He subsequently launched his first solo comedy shows, which he named the Alimony Tour.\n\nThe comic and actor, who starred in movies such as A Fish Called Wanda, told Hello!: \"I never felt there was anything wrong with the institution of marriage - it was my ability to choose the right person.\"\n\nHis bride insisted their age gap was not a problem and said: \"We're kindred spirits. When people see us together, they immediately get it.\""
