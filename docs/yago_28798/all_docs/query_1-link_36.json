She played Ginny in the former and the Lady from Delaware in the latter.\n\n[on Das verrückte Hotel - Fawlty Towers (1975)] People say that nobody but [John Cleese] could have played Basil; it's just as true that nobody but [Andrew Sachs] could have played Manuel, even though there was a time when Andrew, who was German by birth, wanted to play the character in German. The character became iconic."
