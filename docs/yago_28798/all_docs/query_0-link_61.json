        "text": "About Polly\n\nPolly the waitress (played by Connie Booth) is really an art student, working to supplement her grant. She is the only sane member of the team. With an impressive ability to think on her feet, she is always on hand to help Basil out of his worse scrapes. Whether it's impersonating a poorly Sybil, or explaining away dead bodies hidden in laundry baskets, Basil definitely couldn't cope without her.\n\nJohn Cleese on Polly:\n\n\"Getting Connie's character right was not too difficult because she is the sensible one, but she's also Basil's confidante. When he gets in terrible trouble, he will go to Polly and say: \"This has happened and this is what I have to achieve\" and it's terribly useful as a writing device. Someone once described her as Horatio to Hamlet.\""
