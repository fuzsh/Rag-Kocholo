The couple first met in 2009 through mutual friends and tied the knot in an intimate ceremony on the Caribbean island of Mustique three years later.\n\nKnown for their playful personalities, Cleese and Wade enjoy surprising each other with pranks, as Cleese recounted a memorable moment when Wade hid under their bed to scare him.\n\nThe couple made their first public appearance in 2010 at the ATP World Tour Finals in London and have been inseparable since. Wade, a talented jewelry designer, creates imaginative pieces for her brand, Jennifer Wade Jewellery. Her designs, influenced by her extensive travels, blend classic and modern styles.\n\nDespite their 31-year age difference, Cleese and Wade share a deep connection. On their wedding day, Cleese expressed his admiration for Wade, calling her “an extraordinary one-off.” Wade echoed his sentiments, stating that they are kindred spirits and that their age difference never bothers them.\n\nIn 2016, the couple hosted a fundraising event for the Born Free Foundation, an animal welfare charity, at La Perla in London.\n\nThe event was a success, showcasing their playful side with Cleese donning a bra over his eyes for photos. Wade has also been active in fundraising, raising significant funds for Macmillan Cancer Support through a sponsored swim.\n\nThe couple shares their home with several beloved cats, often featured on their social media accounts. Cleese humorously noted that Wade sometimes worries about offending their feline companions. Their joyful, supportive relationship continues to thrive, delighting fans and friends alike."
