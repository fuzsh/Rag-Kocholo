        "text": "John Cleese: ‘He left me weak with laughter’\n\nThe first time I set eyes on Andy Sachs was at the Lyric Theatre, London, in the autumn of 1973. Andy was appearing with Alec Guinness in Alan Bennett’s Habeas Corpus, an exquisitely crafted sex-farce about a respectable family in Brighton in the 1960s. Andy was playing a piano tuner, but the magnificent Margaret Courtenay mistook him for the man who was coming to measure her for a custom-made bra. When Andy started on the standard pianist’s hand-and-finger stretching routine, she began to register anticipation of nameless carnal delights, producing one of the funniest farcical moments I have ever seen. Weak with laughter, I managed to open my programme and underline his name.\n\nA few weeks later, I was casting a short film called Romance with a Double Bass, and I asked Andy to join us for a few days’ shooting. It turned out to be a very happy collaboration, and I observed what a wonderfully inventive comic actor I was working with. Luckily, Connie Booth and I were already writing the pilot episode of Fawlty Towers, so I had the inspired idea of casting Andy as Manuel.\n\nInspired? Let me explain something. If you met Andy socially it would never have occurred to you for one moment that he was an actor. You would have guessed a senior civil servant, or a physician, or an academic, or perhaps a research scientist. He was quiet, thoughtful, beautifully mannered, well informed, observant and extremely kind. But once you put that moustache on him … Ole! Manuel appeared, as if from nowhere.\n\nI salute you, Andy. You created one of the great comic characters.\n\nConnie Booth: ‘Andrew had wit that could sting’\n\nIt’s been 50 years since the cast of Fawlty Towers met at the BBC to begin work. Andrew Sachs was unknown to me, but not to John. He had watched him play one of the funniest pieces of farce business he’d ever seen in Alan Bennett’s Habeas Corpus.\n\nLooking back, the choice of Andrew was a stroke of enormous good luck. Like Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy, he and John at first glance were a droll study in comic contrast. Basil was tall and dogmatic, Manuel small and confused. People say that nobody but John could have played Basil; it’s just as true that nobody but Andrew could have played Manuel, even though there was a time when Andrew, who was German by birth, wanted to play the character in German. The character became iconic.\n\nIn person, Andrew had none of the manic bravado associated with comedians. He wasn’t showy or noisy; he was a good listener; he had wit that could sting. There was a certain detachment about him, magnified in the last years by the onset of Alzheimer’s.\n\nThat same detachment was apparent on stage when some of the great comic set-pieces backfired. For instance, during a fire drill at the hotel, Basil assembles everyone in the lobby, but Manuel is in the kitchen with a frying pan and his sleeve catches fire. Manuel runs out yelling: “Fire! Fire!” But Basil, insisting that there is no fire, pushes him back in, which sets the whole kitchen ablaze.\n\nIn the playing, although Andrew had on a protective jacket, he was badly burned. In that moment of panic and pain, Andrew remained calm. (He later sued the BBC). And again, in another scene when John whacked him on the head with a frying pan, he ended up slightly concussed but showed no pain.\n\nIt reminds me of my first question to Andrew about what makes something funny. He used the example of slipping on a banana peel. If an actual person slips on a banana peel, he said, we’re concerned for him. To be comic, the audience must instinctively know he’s hasn’t been hurt, that he’s OK. Off-stage or on, I never saw pain in Andrew.\n\nJohn Cleese’s words are from his foreword to I Know Nothing!, Andrew Sachs’s autobiography."
