        "text": "Considered one of the greatest British sitcoms, Fawlty Towers remains as popular today as it was during its run from 1975 until 1979. The classic comedy frequently reappears on the TV schedule, drawing in die-hard fans and now it's been announced that the show is heading to London's West End.\n\nThe play, which premieres at The Apollo Theatre on 4 May, has been adapted by writer, creator and star John Cleese using material from three episodes of the series: 'The Hotel Inspectors', 'The Germans' and 'Communication Problems'.\n\nAnd speaking of popular BBC shows, Death in Paradise's 13th series kicks off later this week. Watch the trailer below.\n\nFawlty Towers' charm was undoubtedly the writing and cast – from John Cleese to Connie Booth, the stars brought the characters to life, creating memorable gags and plenty of one-liners. If you've ever wondered what the actors are up to nowadays, look no further. Here's the main cast of the comedy and where they are now...\n\nJohn Cleese as Basil Fawlty\n\nAs well as his ground-breaking work in Monty Python, Fawlty Towers was one of John Cleese's earlier projects. The actor starred as the lead, Basil Fawlty, and wrote the sitcom alongside fellow cast member Connie Booth.\n\nIn later years, John went on to work in numerous films and TV shows including A Fish Called Wanda, James Bond (as Q), and the Shrek franchise. More recently, he's appeared in the films The Very Excellent Mr Dundee and Clifford the Big Red Dog.\n\nSpeaking about the upcoming stage play, John said: \"We've been involved in the casting process for some time, being constantly reminded of what a wealth of acting talent we have in Britain - sorting the very, very, very good from the merely very, very good.\n\n\"Finally, we assembled a top-class group of comedy actors.\"\n\nPrunella Scales as Sybil Fawlty\n\nPrunella Scales played Basil's long-suffering wife, Sybil. Also a manager at the hotel, it was Sybil that often stepped in to do the authoritative roles and handling of difficult guests.\n\nPrunella's part in the comedy was a defining role for the actress, but she also appeared in Alan Bennett's A Question of Attribution as Queen Elizabeth II – for which she was awarded the BAFTA for Best Actress. In recent years, she is known for appearing on TV programme Great Canal Journeys for Channel 4.\n\nPrunella was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2014. In an interview with the BBC to mark Prunella and her husband Timothy West's diamond wedding anniversary, Timothy said: \"It has been something which we bear in mind all of the time, really. It's just something you have to think of. People understand and are very helpful and sympathetic about it. Somehow we have coped with it and Pru doesn't really think about it.\"\n\nConnie Booth as Polly Sherman\n\nConnie Booth played waitress Polly Sherman in the sitcom and also wrote the episodes alongside John Cleese. She and John were married from 1968 until 1978 and welcomed a daughter together, Cynthia. In 1995, Connie retired from acting and embarked on a new career in psychotherapy.\n\nAndrew Sachs as Manuel\n\nAndrew Sachs' part as Spanish waiter Manuel became an iconic part of the show. Manuel was perhaps his best-known role, but Andrew went on to appear in a number of other films and TV shows like Terry Pratchett's Going Postal, Run for Your Wife and, in 2015, EastEnders. In 2012, Andrew was diagnosed with vascular dementia which left him unable to speak.\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Andrew passed away aged 86 at his nursing home in North London. His co-star, John Cleese, described him as a \"sweet, sweet man.\"\n\nBrian Hall as Terry Hugh\n\nBrian Hall appeared in the second series of the comedy as hotel chef Terry Hugh. He had appeared in other shows like Break in the Sun and The Grass Arena. In 1997, aged 59, Brian died after a three-year battle with cancer.\n\nBallard Berkeley as Major Gowen\n\nMajor Gowen was a permanent resident at the hotel and frequently came to blows with Basil. He was portrayed by the actor Ballard Berkeley, who appeared in many films and shows throughout his lengthy career including The BFG. In 1988, Ballard died aged 83."
