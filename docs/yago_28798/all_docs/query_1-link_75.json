        "text": "JOHN Cleese is a household name thanks to his career on TV and movies.\n\nThe star is best known for being in Fawlty Towers, but who is he?\n\nWho is John Cleese?\n\nJohn Cleese is an actor, comedian and producer.\n\nBorn in Somerset in October 1939, John studied at Cambridge where he perfected his skills as an entertainer.\n\nIt's been reported that his family surname was originally Cheese but John's father changed it due to embarrassment when enlisting for the British Army during the First World War.\n\nWhat has John Cleese starred in?\n\nJohn Cleese is best known for his comedy work in Monty Python and Fawlty Towers.\n\nHe won a Best Entertainment Performance Bafta for his performance as Basil Fawlty in the popular sitcom.\n\nJohn reunited with surviving members of the Monty Python clan for a sold-out reunion tour in 2014.\n\nHe first came to prominence in The Frost Report in the sixties before the start of Monty Python.\n\nThe actor also landed roles in several high-profile sequels including Shrek 2, The Pink Panther 2 and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.\n\nHe's also known for A Fish Called Wanda, Clockwise and the James Bond films The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day.\n\nWhat is John Cleese's net worth?\n\nAccording to National Today, it is thought John is worth an estimated $20million.\n\nIs John Cleese married?\n\nJohn married Connie Booth in 1968, three years before they welcomed Cynthia, their only child but they divorced in 1978.\n\nHe later became a father for a second time upon the birth of Camilla to second wife Barbara Trentham (1981-1990).\n\nJohn has since remarried a further two times, first to Alyce Eichelberger from 1992 until 2008, and now with jewellery designer and fourth wife Jennifer Wade.\n\nHow many episodes of Fawlty Towers did John Cleese write?\n\nJohn co-wrote all twelve episodes of the show with his then wife and co-star Connie Booth.\n\nDespite winning three Baftas in it's time and topping the British Film Institute's list of 100 Greatest British Television Programmes in 2000, the show only ran for two series.\n\nBoth seasons contained only six episodes each, which both Cleese and Booth maintained was to preserve the quality of the script.\n\nBetween the first series in 1975 and the second in 1979 the couple's marriage had ended, though they continued to collaborate together on the follow-up season.\n\nWhat does John Cleese do now?\n\nAlthough John has had a very long and extensive film career, most recently he has been predominantly lending his voice to animated movies.\n\nFor example in 2018's Charming in which he voiced the role of The Fairy Godmother.\n\nThat same year he starred in BBC's Hold the Sunset as Phil as well as the ABC sitcom Speechless in which he had a special guest role as Martin, the father of Minnie Driver's character Maya.\n\nIn 2019 he took on the role of Otto Von Walrus in Arctic Justice: Thunder Squad.\n\nIn April 2022, he was cast in Roman Polanski's drama film The Palace.\n\nIn October, it was announced that Cleese will present a news show on GB News in 2023, alongside Andrew Doyle.\n\nHe said he wanted to promote \"proper argument\"\n\nIt has also been confirmed that Fawlty Towers will be making a return.\n\nJohn will be writing the show alongside his daughter."
