        "text": "Here’s what we know so far...\n\nMore than 40 years after Fawlty Towers became a huge hit TV show, it is set for a reboot! Despite only having two series made, it's become widely regarded as one of the best sitcoms of all time, being named by a panel of TV experts for Radio Times magazine in 2019.\n\nAs fans will know, the show followed the infamous hotelier Basil Fawlty (played by John Cleese) and was shown on BBC2 in 1975 and 1979, with several reruns.\n\nWho will star in the reboot of Fawlty Towers?\n\nThe reboot is set to feature John Cleese and his daughter Camilla Cleese. No further cast have been announced, but John is very excited to be involved.\n\nSpeaking about the new series, John Cleese said: \"When we first met, he (Matthew George - exec producer) offered an excellent first idea, and then Matt, my daughter Camilla, and I had one of the best creative sessions I can remember.\n\n\"By dessert, we had an overall concept so good that, a few days later, it won the approval of Rob and Michele Reiner. Camilla and I look forward enormously to expanding it into a series.\"\n\nWhat will the reboot be about?\n\nCastle Rock Entertainment announced they have closed a deal with the lead actor to bring back the series, and which will 'explore how the cynical and sarcastic Basil navigates the modern world.'\n\nThe series will follow Basil and his long-lost daughter, who has recently returned, as they work together to run a boutique hotel.\n\nWho is producing the new series of Fawlty Towers?\n\nThe new series will also see actors Rob and Michelle Reiner, along with director and producer Matthew George and Derrick Rossi all acting as executive producers.\n\nMatthew then added: \"I’m obsessed with Fawlty Towers and the legendary characters he (John Cleese) created. I’ve watched the first two seasons so many times I have lost count. I dreamed of one day being involved in a continuation of the story. Now it’s come true.\"\n\nExecutive producer Rob Reiner also said of the series: \"John Cleese is a comedy legend. Just the idea of working with him makes me laugh.\n\n\"The original show, written by Cleese and Connie Booth, ran on BBC Two for two series in 1975 and 1979. In 2019, it was named the greatest British sitcom of all time by a panel of television experts for Radio Times magazine.\n\n\"However, despite its success, Cleese has previously pushed back on the idea of reviving Fawlty Towers. In a 2009 interview, the comedian, then aged 69, said the cast would never make another episode because they are 'too old and tired'.\"\n\nThere is no word yet on when the series will shown on TV.\n\nNow take a look at TV shows we wish would make a comeback:\n\nNow read:\n\nIconic Neighbours episodes to be released ahead of new series\n\nNeighbours SAVED with new series announced for 2023\n\nNostalgic TV shows we really miss on the box\n\nHow to listen to Greatest Hits Radio:\n\nListen to Greatest Hits Radio on the free Rayo app, online or on your DAB digital radio.
