        "text": "The 83-year-old actress starred opposite her ex-husband John Cleese in the classic 1970s sitcom, but almost 50 years after the pair wrote the short-lived series, it will launch as a West End play on Saturday (04.05.24).\n\nConnie's second husband John Lahr has claimed she will see it at some point, but will keep a low profile.\n\nHe told the MailOnline: \"She’ll be going to see it - probably not on opening night but she’ll be there.\"\n\nThe actress has become something of a recluse in the last few decades and has not acted since she starred in a 1995 adaptation of Edith Wharton's 'The Buccaneers'.\n\nHer theatre critic husband - who is the son of late 'Wizard of Oz' star Bert Lahr - insisted his wife will not be giving any interviews, but he can \"understand\" why people would be interested.\n\nHe said: \"I understand people are interested - why wouldn’t they be? Connie is not giving interviews. She doesn’t generally do it anymore.\"\n\nA source added that Connie - who played Polly Sherman in the 12-episode series that was all set in Torquay's most calamitous, fictional hotel - will in no way be using the opening of the play to return to the limelight.\n\nThe insider said: \"She is looking forward to seeing it, but she likes to keep a low profile these days and stay very much out of the limelight!\"\n\nJust days ago, it was announced that the show would be making its way to the stage.\n\nJohn, 82, said: \"What a thrill to be bringing 'Fawlty Towers' to the West End for the first time - nearly 50 years since the show was first recorded, in December 1974.\n\n\"We’ve been involved in the casting process for some time, being constantly reminded of what a wealth of acting talent we have in Britain – sorting the very, very, very good from the merely very, very good.\n\n\"Finally, we assembled a top-class group of comedy actors who will bring the show to the Apollo Theatre on Shaftesbury Avenue.\""
