        "text": "Aloys (Butch) Knecht was born in Batesville, Indiana on January 29, 1953, the son of Stanley and Margaret (Vogelsang) Knecht. After a courageous 6-year battle with intestinal cancer and heart disease he passed away on Sunday, August 4th at Hospice of Cincinnati.\n\nButch was a 1967 graduate of St. Peter’s grade school and a 1971 Sunman High School graduate. He also attended Indiana University in Bloomington. He worked many years at Cincinnati Gas and Electric and operated his own contracting business for 41 years.\n\nOn August 22, 1981, he married Cathy Schuman at St Joseph Church, St. Leon. Butch was a lifetime member of St. Peter’s Catholic Church where he served as a mass server, usher, several terms on parish council, 21 years on the Administrative and Finance Committee, and worked part time as the maintenance man. Butch was a mass lector for approximately 50 years, something he really enjoyed doing. He was also a\n\nEucharistic minister to the sick for several years.\n\nButch was the charter commander of St. Joseph Post 464 Sons of The American Legion in St. Leon. After he retired, he volunteered at Dynamic Catholic in Erlanger Kentucky and worked around his farm, which included cutting wood. Butch also worked at the St. Leon Fireman’s Festival for 50 years selling beer tickets. The fire chief, who later became his father-in-law, put him to work selling tickets when he needed help in the beer booth.\n\nButch liked anything history, especially in the industrial revolution. He loved antique tractors and cars and collected quite a few; Cathy would say a few too many. He enjoyed going to antique tractor shows where he could see them in person. He also loved pies and when asked what his favorite pie was, he would say a round one.\n\nButch is survived by Cathy, his wife of nearly 43 years; sisters Bertie (Larry) Bauman, Connie (Bill) Wintz, Cindy (Ralph) Ross, and brothers Gary (Beverly) Knecht and Mark (Melanie) Knecht, and brother in-laws, Melvin Dunbar and Andrew Weller. He is also survived by his mother-in -law, Mary Schuman, and Cathy’s seven brothers Don (Mary), Ron, Mike (Anita), Patrick, Steve (Donna), Jim, and Mark (Dawn) Schuman and Cathy’s sister Julie Baker. Butch is also survived by many nieces and nephews on both sides of the family. He will also be missed by his 3 fur babies, Daisy, Lilly, and Rosie.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents Stanley and Margaret Knecht; his sisters Betty Dunbar, Rita Kramer, and Marilyn Weller; father-in-law, Walter Schuman; brother-in-law Al Kramer; sister-in-law Angie Schuman; nephew Dustin Schuman; great niece Erika Daily; and great nephew Carter Bond.\n\nServices for Butch will be held on Sunday, August 11 Andres-Wuestefeld Funeral Home. Rosary will begin at 2:45pm followed by visitation from 3:00pm – 7:00pm. Mass of Christian Burial will be held on Monday, August 12 at 10am at St. Peter’s Catholic Church immediately followed by burial in the church cemetery. Memorials can be made to St. Peter’s Catholic Church Cemetery, Mercy Ships, or Franklin County Right to Life. Family and friends are encouraged to leave condolences at www.andres-wuestefeldfh.com."
