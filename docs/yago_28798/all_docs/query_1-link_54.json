        "text": "Actress Connie Booth's acting career began via high school theater productions, before she relocated to New York City to further pursue acting. Booth would go on to meet actor/writer John Cleese, and the two would marry in 1968 (just before Cleese went on to worldwide fame as one of the main components of the Monty Python comedy troupe). As a result of their union, Booth went on to appear in the hit television show \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" as well as such Python-related movies as \"And Now for Something Completely Different\" and \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail.\" But perhaps what Booth will be forever best known for is that she co-created, starred in, and wrote (with Cleese) one of England's most beloved television comedies of all time, \"Fawlty Towers,\" which ran for two seasons (1975 and 1979), despite the pair's divorce in 1978. Booth would go on to appear in further movies and television shows sporadically, before all but retiring from acting in the mid 1990s. Booth is a psychotherapist in London, and has since remarried, to author and senior drama critic of The New Yorker, John Lahr."
