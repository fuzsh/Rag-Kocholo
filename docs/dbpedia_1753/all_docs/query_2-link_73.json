        "text": "It took him six attempts, spanning a decade, to get elected in 1987. He was the first openly gay parliamentarian on the island of Ireland at a time when the state viewed him as a criminal.\n\nThis was a country that was struggling to accommodate its sexual minorities. A country where lesbian mothers were forcibly separated from their children in custody cases; where men were routinely beaten up and murdered for ‘looking gay’. Where it was legal to refuse you service in a bar or hotel and being openly gay could damage your employment prospects. And where the word ‘transgender’ had barely entered our lexicon.\n\nDavid’s election also dovetailed with his constitutional action to remove the British Victorian legislation that criminalised homosexual acts, a process he began in 1976 when he co-founded the Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform.\n\nHis activist roots can be traced to the beginning of that decade, when he attended a meeting of the Sexual Liberation Movement (SLM) at Trinity College Dublin in November 1973. While not specifically gay, SLM was the first group in the Republic to campaign on gay law reform, along with other social justice issues such as contraception, divorce and abortion. The small, ad hoc group also scored a historic first in organising a symposium on homosexuality in February 1974 that had a profound impact on the 30-year-old university lecturer.\n\nNot long after, David left SLM to co-found the Irish Gay Rights Movement (IGRM), a mainstream lesbian and gay advocacy organisation with structures in Dublin and Cork, a community resource — the first of its kind in Ireland — on Parnell Square in Dublin and a telephone counselling service, The Switchboard, that continues to operate to this day.\n\nAs national chairman of IGRM, David became the first openly gay person to appear on Irish television in 1975, challenging the stereotype of the day with some witty repartee: “We are neither sick, ill or pathological… I don’t feel ill and I hope I don’t look it.” The Last House programme achieved the second highest viewer ratings that week but was later found to be in breach of the broadcasting code, given that homosexuality was considered a criminal offence. An acrimonious split in IGRM led David to establish a rival organisation, the National Gay Federation (NGF) in 1978. Tasked with opening a new community centre, it acquired an old warehouse in a rundown part of Dublin behind the Central Bank and to great fanfare on St Patrick’s Day 1979 opened one of the world’s earliest full-time queer community centres, the Hirschfeld Centre. At a time when statutory and commercial funding was simply inconceivable, the centre’s acquisition was consolidated by a personal loan from David and a mortgage on his house in Dublin’s inner city.\n\nNamed after an early 20th century German sexologist, the Hirschfeld Centre contained a cinema club, disco, archives, café and meeting rooms, all run by volunteers.\n\nIt was here that I first met David, who is 15 years my senior. He encouraged me to join the NGF board and take an active role in furthering media representation, at a time when media and pop culture were wholly lacking in diverse and positive LGBT role models. Moreover, any consideration by Irish society of the fears and needs of LGBT youth — I was 19 at the time — was hugely problematic and taboo.\n\nThus began a lifelong friendship and political collaboration that has enriched me over and again; whether it was trotting to the continent for meetings of the International Lesbian and Gay Association, staying up until all hours in the Hirschfeld Centre to research and process papers for his court case or devising ways to preserve the Irish Queer Archive. And just being silly and gossipy, a glass of wine or cup of tea in hand, being louche in the Middle Eastern-themed room at the top of his lovingly restored Georgian home.\n\nI look back on my time at the Hirschfeld Centre, before it was destroyed by fire, with enormous affection. It was the making of me, as a young man and a civil rights activist. The centre had its flaws but in its nine-year history it allowed a generation of Irish LGBT people to find their collective voice and take their rightful place at the centre of Irish society, the results of which are all around us today.\n\nThe Strasbourg decision in 1988, which ruled that the Irish ban on homosexual acts was a violation of human rights, was such a big deal. We were confident of winning, after Belfast activist and treasured friend Jeff Dudgeon set a precedent challenging the same British legislation in the European Court of Human Rights.\n\n“What will you do if you don’t win?,” I mockingly asked David, a few days before the announcement. “I’ll bloody well march over to Strasbourg and throw a f**king brick through their window,” he thundered in faux outrage, before we fell about laughing.\n\nWhen the decision was made in his favour, we hooked up with Mary Robinson, his senior counsel, for lunch at Leinster House. I’m happy to say the stubby Schefflera (umbrella tree) I gave David in gratitude for that momentous decision now extends over three floors of the stairwell of his home.\n\nDavid’s tenure as senator, the longest of any in Irish history, unquestionably helped him shape a more intersectional approach to issues in Ireland and abroad. And for those of us looking on, imagining our own political and activist careers, our doughty senator was forever determined to apply fun and conviction in equal measure to whatever project was in hand.\n\nHe was an early advocate for an underground railway in Dublin and campaigned vociferously for inner-city renewal along with the preservation of our capital’s built heritage. He was one of the first parliamentarians to call for the decriminalisation of recreational drug use, at a time when doing so was considered political suicide and risked inviting all sorts of prurient media intrusion into his private life.\n\nIn the early Noughties, his attempt to introduce civil partnership legislation was rebuffed by the government, leading him to throw everything at getting full marriage equality over the line.\n\nThe old Civil War parties may have thwarted his attempts to reform the Upper House but, as an independent of 37 years’ standing, David Norris became the living embodiment of the Seanad’s role as a place for robust debate and conscience of the Oireachtas; following in a line that included some of Ireland’s other political titans like Noel Browne, Joe O’Toole, Mary Robinson and Michael D Higgins.\n\nAs a member of the Oireachtas Foreign Affairs Committee, he has been a long-time critic of human rights violations by the Israeli government. An extraordinary speech he gave in the Seanad in 2014 concerning the conflict in Gaza, “Israel bombs first and weeps later”, is required viewing, now more than ever.\n\nI’m politically seasoned enough to know the price you pay for devoting a lifetime to public service, for taking uncomfortable yet necessary positions that can cost you friendships and political connections. It can even cost you your life, as we have seen in jurisdictions not that far away.\n\nAnd yet, to the end of his political career, David Norris has been an unswerving champion of the unrepresented and dispossessed. For this and so much more, I thank you, old friend.\n\nTonie Walsh is an LBGT+ rights activist, and one of the founders of ‘Gay Community News’ (GCN) magazine"
