        "text": "ACT Supreme Court grants bail on the basis that people on remand must be imprisoned separately\n\nDPP v Alexander (a pseudonym) [2024] ACTSC 161\n\nJustice Mossop of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory has found that an accused person, Alexander (a pseudonym), was imprisoned in contravention of section 19 of the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT) (HRA) in circumstances where they were on remand and imprisoned with people who had been convicted. Alexander’s right to be separated from convicted prisoners was not restricted by the operation of section 44 of the Corrections Management Act 2007 (ACT) (CMA). Accordingly, his Honour found that the requirements for “special or exceptional circumstances” favouring a grant of bail under section 9D of the Bail Act 1992 (ACT) (Bail Act) were satisfied.\n\nRead More\n\nMelbourne public housing tower resident's claim summarily dismissed for having \"no real prospect of success\", plaintiff given chance to reformulate claim\n\nBerih v State of Victoria (No 2) [2024] VSC 230\n\nThe Victorian Supreme Court upheld the defendants' application for summary dismissal but granted leave for the plaintiff to reformulate his claim, in a representative proceeding (class action) challenging the validity of the decision to demolish three public housing towers in Melbourne. Justice Richards held the plaintiff's claim had no real prospect of success because the claim did not identify a decision that the plaintiff had standing to seek judicial review remedies for. The lack of justiciability of the decision was fatal to both the jurisdictional error ground and the Charter grounds in this matter.\n\nRead More\n\nCourt finds no unlawful interference with accused's rights to privacy and reputation in Department's investigation into historical child sexual abuse\n\nBZN v Chief Executive, the Department of Children, Youth Justice and Multicultural Affairs [2023] QSC 266\n\nOn 30 November 2023, the Supreme Court of Queensland ruled that the plaintiff, BZN, had not proven that the final review decision, which affirmed the findings of an investigation into his alleged sexual assault of a child, was: legally invalid; or unlawful under section 59 of the Human Rights Act 2019 (Qld) ('HRA').\n\nThe judgment offers insights into how the HRA applies to public authorities and the standards they must meet in making decisions that adequately consider human rights.\n\nRead More\n\nQLD Court of Appeal finds that legislation prohibiting Sikhs from wearing ceremonial knives in schools is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth)\n\nAthwal v State of Queensland [2023] QCA 156\n\nKamaljit Kaur Athwal successfully brought an action against the State of Queensland seeking a declaration that the restriction on possessing a knife for religious reasons inside a school was inconsistent with the federal Racial Discrimination Act 1975 (Cth) (‘RDA’).\n\nRead More\n\nPowers of Online Safety Act tested in Federal Court case\n\neSafety Commissioner v X Corp [2024] FCA 499\n\nThe high-profile dispute between the Office of the eSafety (‘eSafety’) Commissioner and X Corp (formerly known as Twitter) has tested key powers of Australia’s Online Safety Act and stimulated spirited debate on the interplay between online safety laws and rights to freedom of expression. eSafety sought enforcement of a removal notice pertaining to a bundle of content showing the high-profile stabbing in Sydney of Bishop Mar Mari Emmanuel. The Federal Court refused to extend an ex parte interim injunction against X Corp, and held that geo-blocking is a reasonable step for removing content pursuant to a removal notice under section 109 of the Online Safety Act. The judgment suggests Parliament should clarify the meaning of ‘all reasonable steps’ in the context of the Online Safety Act.\n\nRead More\n\nSwitzerland found to have contravened European Convention on Human Rights through response to climate change\n\nOn 9 April 2024, the European Court of Human Rights ('ECHR') handed down rulings in three important matters concerning the human rights impacts of climate change. These rulings highlight the ECHR's stance on the human rights implications of national climate policies.\n\nRead More\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination directions issued to Queensland police and ambulance services ruled unlawful\n\nThe Supreme Court of Queensland has found that directions issued by the Commissioner of the Queensland Police Service and the Director General of Queensland Health to their employees were unlawful under section 58 of the Human Rights Act 2019 (Qld) ('HRA') or of no effect. Injunctions were granted to restrain the enforcement of the directions. In a separate proceeding, applicants who challenged the validity of directions issued by the Chief Health Officer were found to not have standing and the application was consequently dismissed.\n\nThis summary focuses on the aspects of the judgments that relate to the HRA.\n\nRead More\n\nACT Supreme Court considers the availability of damages under the Human Rights Act\n\nMcIver v Australian Capital Territory; Williams v Australian Capital Territory [2024] ACTSC 112\n\nCurtin AJ of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Supreme Court has refused to grant an extension of time to bring claims for compensation or damages under the Human Rights Act 2004 (ACT) (HRA) to persons who allege their human rights were infringed by a public authority, being the Australian Capital Territory (Territory), because of the finding that the claims were futile. The case contains helpful discussion of the operation of the HRA.\n\nRead More\n\nIndefinite detention continues for people who cannot be forcibly deported\n\nHigh Court ruling in ASF17 v Commonwealth of Australia [2024] HCA 19\n\nOn 10 May 2024, the High Court handed down its judgment in the case of ASF17. The decision followed the High Court’s ruling in NZYQ in November 2023, in which the Court held it was unlawful for the Australian Government to continue detaining a person in immigration detention where there was no real prospect of the person’s removal from Australia becoming practicable in the reasonably foreseeable future.\n\nThat case was brought by a plaintiff who was both stateless and engaged Australia’s international protection obligations. In ASF17, the Court considered whether the same limitation on detention applied to a person who did not have a formal protection finding, but could not be removed because his country of origin refuses to accept the forced return of its citizens and he had not consented to return.\n\nRead More\n\nUK High Court rules amendments to Public Order Act unlawful and upholds protest rights\n\nNational Council for Civil Liberties v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2024] EWHC 1181\n\nIn an important decision on protest rights in England, the High Court of Justice has found that amendments made by the Secretary of State to the Public Order Act 1986 (‘POA Act’) were unlawful. The amended regulations had the effect of lowering the threshold of police intervention in protests. In its decision, the Court considered four grounds of challenges and accepted two of them. The decision is useful in understanding what is considered to be unlawful and the limitations in circumventing legislative processes.\n\nRead More\n\nLandmark New Zealand decision on tort liability for greenhouse gas emissions\n\nSmith v Fonterra [2024] NZSC 5\n\nThe New Zealand Supreme Court has delivered a landmark decision on a case brought by Māori elder, Mike Smith, against seven of New Zealand's largest greenhouse gas emitters.\n\nPrior to this decision, the common law had entrenched the prevailing orthodoxy that tort claims could not be used to challenge or address climate change and that the regulation of greenhouse gas emitters was best left to the other branches of government through statutory regulation.\n\nThis case is significant as it marks one of the first decisions where a court has recognised that tort law can be used to challenge the greenhouse gas emissions of a private entity.\n\nRead More\n\nThe Federal Court awards increased damages on appeal for employee discriminated against due to his age.\n\nMr Gutierrez v MUR Shipping Australia Pty Limited [2023] FCA 399\n\nAlex Gutierrez successfully brought proceedings against MUR Shipping (‘MUR’) for breaches of the Age Discrimination Act 2004 (Cth). On 4 May 2023, the Australian Federal Court allowed an appeal challenging the damages awarded to Mr Gutierrez by the Federal Circuit and Family Court. The Court found in favour of Mr Gutierrez, substantially increasing his general damages and awarding him damages for economic loss.\n\nRead More\n\nCourt finds that complainant was subject to systemic discrimination on the basis of her age and sex, acknowledging the role of unconscious bias.\n\nAustin Health v Tsikos [2023] VSCA 82\n\nOn 17 April 2023, the Victorian Court of Appeal overruled the decision of the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (‘VCAT’) in favour of the respondent, Ms Tsikos, and dismissed the appeal by Austin Health. Although the Court of Appeal granted leave to appeal, none of the grounds were successful, instead agreeing with the single instance judgment and finding that VCAT had erred in its original decision.\n\nRead More\n\nUS Supreme Court Unanimously Rules in Favour of Whistleblower Protection in Murray v UBS Securities LLC: Landmark Decision Sets Precedent for Contributing Factor Test\n\nMurray v UBS Securities LLC, 601 US 22 (2024)\n\nThis matter relates to a decision pursuant to §1514A(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which allows whistleblower employees to seek relief against an employer that makes an adverse personnel decision against the employee because of their whistleblowing activity.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court unanimously held that a whistleblower who invokes §1514A must prove that their protected activity was a contributing factor in the employer’s unfavourable personnel action but need not prove that their employer acted with “retaliatory intent”.\n\nRead More\n\nThe Federal Court dismisses judicial review challenges brought by the Environment Council of Central QLD Incs in relation to the Ministerial approvals for two coal mining expansion projects in NSW\n\nECoCeQ v Minister for the Environment and Water (No 2) [2023] FCA 1208\n\nThe Federal Court dismissed two judicial review proceedings brought by the by the Environment Council of Central Queensland (‘ECoCeQ’) regarding the climate change effects of scope 3 coal mining emissions to Matters of National Environmental Significance under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (‘the Act’).\n\nRead More\n\nFederal Court rejects application relating to the repatriation of 34 women and children from North-East Syria\n\nThe Federal Court dismissed an application made by Save the Children Australia for habeas corpus of 34 women and children held in camps in North-East Syria finding that the Minister for Home Affairs and the Commonwealth of Australia did not have control over their detainment. However, the Court in a separate decision made no order as to costs, in an important decision on costs in public interest litigation.\n\nRead More\n\nBelgium found to be in breach of European human rights obligations by failing to take substantive climate change mitigation action\n\nVZW Klimaatzaak v Kingdom of Belgium & Others (30 November 2023)\n\nIn VZW Klimaatzaak v Kingdom of Belgium & Others (Klimaatzaak), the Brussels Court of Appeal ordered that Belgium and the Flemish and Brussels-Capital Regions reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.\n\nRead More\n\nSupreme Court strikes down parts of new NSW anti-protest laws for impermissibly burdening the Commonwealth Constitution’s implied freedom of political communication\n\nKvelde v State of New South Wales [2023] NSWSC 1560\n\nTwo environmental activists who challenged New South Wales’ recently reformed anti-protest laws have been in-part successful. The Supreme Court declared parts of section 214A of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) (Crimes Act) invalid for impermissibly burdening the Commonwealth Constitution’s implied freedom of political communication.\n\nRead More\n\nCompensation awarded to tenant who experienced psychological inconvenience caused by premises’ lack of security\n\nYoung v Chief Executive Officer (Housing) [2023] HCA 31\n\nIn the case of Young v Chief Executive Officer (Housing) [2023] HCA 31, the High Court allowed an appeal from the Court of Appeal of the Northern Territory Supreme Court, which concerned the Civil and Administrative Tribunal of the Northern Territory’s power under section 122 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1999 (NT) (Act).\n\nRead More\n\nMagistrate failed to consider minor's right to privacy under the Victorian Charter\n\nMB (a pseudonym) v Children’s Court of Victoria & Anor [2023] VSC 666\n\nThis case raises important human rights considerations of privacy and the State acting in the best interests of the child, in relation to the State’s retention of a child’s DNA information. Without the Victorian Charter, these fundamental considerations would not have been taken into account.\n\nRead More\n\nA Queensland non-profit has successfully applied for an exemption to employ only women\n\nChildren by Choice Association Incorporated [2023] QIRC 293\n\nA Queensland non-profit organisation has successfully applied to the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission (the Commission) for an exemption to employ only women.\n\nRead More\n\nState of Victoria was found vicariously liable for a school principal’s failure to adequately respond to antisemitic bullying by students\n\nKaplan v State of Victoria (No 8) [2023] FCA 1092\n\nIn Kaplan v State of Victoria (No 8) [2023] FCA 1092 (14 September 2023), the State of Victoria was found vicariously liable for a school principal’s failure to adequately respond to antisemitic bullying by students.\n\nRead More\n\nVictorian Tribunal upholds importance of the Human Rights Charter in planning decision\n\nBespoke Development Group Pty Ltd v Merri-bek CC [2023] VCAT 758\n\nVictorian Tribunal refuses to strike out use of the Human Rights Charter ground in planning decision.\n\nRead More\n\nSydney Trains had unlawfully discriminated against potential employee\n\nAnnovazzi v State of New South Wales - Sydney Trains [2023] FedFamC2G 542\n\nOn 23 June 2023, the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (FCFCA) found that Sydney Trains had unlawfully discriminated against Ms Renee Annovazzi (Ms Annovazzi) by dismissing her, prohibiting her participation in the trainee drivers course and requesting a medical note regarding her disabilities.\n\nRead More\n\nLandmark recognition of human rights and environmental impacts as grounds for a recommendation against the grant of a mining lease\n\nWaratah Coal Pty Ltd v Youth Verdict Ltd & Ors (No 6) [2022] QLC 21\n\nWaratah Coal Pty Ltd v Youth Verdict Ltd & Ors (No 6) [2022] QLC 21 (25 November 2022) involved the Land Court of Queensland making recommendations to the [Queensland] Minister for Resources (Minister) and the Chief Executive of the Department of Environment and Science (Chief Executive) on Waratah Coal Pty Ltd's (Waratah) applications for a mining lease and environmental authority to mine thermal coal in the Galilee Basin.\n\nRead More\n\nVictory for whistleblowers - the ECHR reaffirms corporate whistleblowers’ right to freedom of expression\n\nHalet v Luxembourg Application No.21884/18\n\nThe applicant, Mr Raphael Halet, argued that his criminal convictions arising from disclosure of confidential corporate information constituted an infringement of Article 10 of the Convention, being his right to freedom of expression.\n\nRead More\n\nHigh Court finds that electoral expenditure caps in NSW legislation impermissibly burden the implied freedom of political communication\n\nUnions NSW v New South Wales [2023] HCA 4\n\nAfter “an urgent hearing of what became a non-urgent case”,1 the High Court found that a provision of NSW legislation did in fact burden the implied freedom of political communication.
