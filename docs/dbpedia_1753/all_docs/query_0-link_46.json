        "text": "The institutional design of the Strasbourg system that has evolved over the last decades is an expression of contemporary debates surrounding the system's very nature and purpose. The current debate primarily bears on the range of choices that the Council of Europe faces in adapting to the changes in Europe, which largely have been caused by its expansion to cover nearly all post-Communist States of Central and Eastern Europe since the 1990s. This expansion, and with it the extension of the scope of the European Convention on Human Rights (the Convention) to now more than 800 million people in forty seven countries, has confronted the European Court of Human Rights (the Court) with a far broader range of human rights problems than had previously existed. By 2010, the number of pending cases had risen to 139,650 but the Court's adjudicative capacity remains limited.\n\n23 In order to adapt its legislation to the requirements of the Convention for cases, which are merely parallel as they are normatively not pre-determined by law at the national level, the State Party is obligated to do legal “comparisons” because cases have to be tested whether they are truly in parallel to the case decided by the Court or whether they can for some reason be distinguished, Hans-Joachim Cremer, Human Rights and the Protection of Privacy in Tort Law 12 (2010).Google Scholar\n\n54 Art. 46 of the Convention reads: “(1) The High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the final judgment of the Court in any case to which they are parties. (2) The final judgment of the Court shall be transmitted to the Committee of Ministers, which shall supervise its execution. (3) If the Committee of Ministers considers that the supervision of the execution of a final judgment is hindered by a problem of interpretation of the judgment, it may refer the matter to the Court for a ruling on the question of interpretation. A referral decision shall require a majority vote of two thirds of the representatives entitled to sit on the Committee. (4) If the Committee of Ministers considers that a High Contracting Party refuses to abide by a final judgment in a case to which it is a party, it may, after serving formal notice on that Party and by decision adopted by a majority vote of two thirds of the representatives entitled to sit on the Committee, refer to the Court the question whether that Party has failed to fulfil its obligation under paragraph 1. (5) If the Court finds a violation of paragraph 1, it shall refer the case to the Committee of Ministers for consideration of the measures to be taken. If the Court finds no violation of paragraph 1, it shall refer the case to the Committee of Ministers, which shall close its examination of the case.”Google Scholar\n\n63 Art. 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention reads: “(1) Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law. (2) The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties.” See Garlicki (note 27), 178.Google Scholar\n\n65 The relocation that took place at the end of the 1940s remains – rationae temporis – outside the jurisdiction of the Convention and the Court. The situation is different when a State Party enacts new legislation or maintains old legislation providing compensation for loss property confiscated under a previous regime. Once such a entitlement has been provided for by legislation post-dating the ratification of the Convention and of its Protocol No. 1, the compensation claim for the loss of property enjoy full protection under the Convention, Garlicki (note 27), 179, 181. See Eur. Court H.R., Broniowski v. Poland (GC) (note 60), para. 125.Google Scholar\n\n146 Art. 36 of the Convention reads: “(1) In all cases before a Chamber or the Grand Chamber, a High Contracting Party one of whose nationals is an applicant shall have the right to submit written comments and to take part in hearings. (2) The President of the Court may, in the interest of the proper administration of justice, invite any High Contracting Party which is not a party to the proceedings or any person concerned who is not the applicant to submit written comments or take part in hearings.”Google Scholar\n\n153 Helfer (note 79), 154; citing Andreas von Staden, Assessing the Impact of the Judgment of the European Court of Human Rights on Domestic Human Rights Policies, paper prepared for delivery at the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, noting that a “state may prefer to simply pay just satisfaction without taking substantive steps to remedy the situation and fully remove the consequences of the violation and suggesting that many governments enter into friendly settlements for that reason.” Helfer points out that the Court “may not approve a friendly settlement unless it manifests a “respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and the Protocols thereto” in accordance to Art. 37 of the Convention.”Google Scholar"
