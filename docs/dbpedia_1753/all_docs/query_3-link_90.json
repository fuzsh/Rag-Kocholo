        "text": "Introduction\n\n1The approaching centenary of the Irish state has, unsurprisingly, prompted a great deal of reflection as to its republican character and credentials, and particularly as to the legacy of the republican ideas and rhetoric that motivated much of the political revolution from which the independent polity emerged. Much of this analysis has focused on the political culture of the State, and particularly its alleged pathologies of clientelism and corruption. However, relatively little has been said about the republican character, or otherwise, of the Irish Constitution. On the one hand, the Constitution of 1937 was seemingly influenced by Catholic social thought and characterised by a bellicose Gaelic-Christian nationalism that seemed rather bereft of republican potential. On the other hand, there are clear imprints of traditional republican ideas in constitutional provisions and principles relating to the structure and ethos of state institutions – some of which differentiated the new state from the parliamentary-centred model of the British constitution.\n\n2Accordingly, in this article I will consider to what extent republican ideas have influenced the Irish Constitution both in its historical and contemporary form. On the one hand, I will argue that the Constitution embraces many rather generic, non-specific republican ideas – like the rule of law, equality before the law and even the separation of church and state – that seem unremarkable with reference to the wider landscape of European liberal democracies. Equally, more distinctively “republican” concepts – such as civic participation and civic virtue – are either conspicuously absent or at least muted in the wider landscape of Irish constitutional thought. However, I will also argue that many of the central devices and institutions of the Irish Constitution may be interpreted in a specifically republican light.\n\n3I will make this argument with reference to two particular areas of constitutional doctrine: popular sovereignty and constitutional rights. I will argue that while the ideology of popular sovereignty seems to enshrine a plebiscitary concept of democracy that keeps the people at “arm’s length” in constituted governance, it can equally be understood as a means of checking executive dominance in the area of constitutional change, and ultimately as a safeguard against arbitrary governance. Similarly, while the acceptance of judicial supremacy in relation to constitutional rights seems to stem from an American-influenced liberalism – one that has a depoliticizing and decidedly unrepublican character – equally rights can be interpreted not simply as a guarantee of non-interference for individuals against the state, but rather as safeguards to ensure the primacy of the common good in the context of legislative process. Thus, my argument neither assumes any authentic, true version of the republican tradition, nor does it claim the Constitution itself has a singular or even a distinctive ideological or philosophical character. Rather the argument is a more modest one: it is that while the existing, amorphous precepts of constitutional doctrine have most often been understood in relation to liberal or communitarian ways of thinking, they are amenable to being reinterpreted in light of distinctively republican values.\n\n4In the first section, I will discuss the transposition of republican themes in different constitutional traditions, and give a brief assessment of their applications in the Irish context. In the second and third sections, I will consider how two of the central doctrines of the Irish Constitution – popular sovereignty and “natural” individual rights – may be reconceptualised in a distinctively republican sense.\n\nRepublican constitutionalism: an overview\n\nPopular sovereignty\n\n13Popular sovereignty has been understood as the definitive and overarching principle of the Irish constitutional order. Article 6 proclaims that all “powers of Government” are derived – albeit “under God” – from “the people”. In more practical terms, the idea of popular sovereignty served as a legitimating principle for the enactment of the Constitution in the post-independence context as well as something approximating a constitutional doctrine that differentiated the new state from the British constitutional tradition.\n\n16Therefore, from the outset, popular sovereignty was associated with the expression of the popular voice in referendum exercises. One of the distinctive, and unusual, features of the Constitution was the fact that it could only be amended through a referendum process. In turn, this has been understood as the primary, if not the exclusive mechanism for giving expression to popular sovereignty.\n\n22Thus, the people’s power is far more modest than what constitutional mythology suggests. In political-theory terms, the constitutional referendum mechanism affords the people (limited) influence, but not control of the kind that “sovereignty” implies. Being couched within a limiting initiative procedure, the people can never be seen as engaged in a freestanding act of creation or control. In the context of the amendment process, the people are very much a constituted, rather than a constituent authority, as part of an interaction of different mutually constraining assemblies and authorities and with a procedurally couched role.\n\n25Nonetheless, the plebiscitary characteristics of the Irish Constitution, and the accompanying rhetoric of popular sovereignty, can be re-interpreted in distinctly republican terms.\n\n31While many republicans view direct democracy apprehensively, as a source of potential tyranny or domination, I have argued that the constitutional referendum does not in fact constitute “direct democracy” in a meaningful sense. An alternative understanding of the constitutional referendum – assigning the people a contestatory rather than an authorial or constituent role – reconciles it with the historical republican concern for “mixed” government.\n\nConstitutional rights and non-domination\n\n77 McGee v Attorney General [1974] IR 284, 310.\n\nArticles 41, 42, and 43 emphatically reject the theory that there are no rights without laws, no rights contrary to the law and no rights anterior to the law. They indicate that justice is placed above the law and acknowledge that natural rights or human rights are not created by law but that the Constitution confirms their existence and gives them protection. The individual has natural and human rights over which the State has no authority .\n\n39Since freedom, in the republican tradition, consists of non-domination in the sense of non-arbitrary rule – and since domination is based on asymmetric power relationships rather than interference per se – it is arguable, in one sense, that judicially enforced constitutional rights are alien to the republican way of thinking about freedom and rights.\n\nConclusion\n\n45The Irish Constitution has not traditionally been understood and discussed using a specifically republican discourse, of the kind that prevails in other constitutional cultures such as that of France, or perhaps the United States. Instead, Irish constitutional culture has been informed either by rather generic, almost platitudinous doctrines such as that of popular sovereignty – or an elusive notion of rule by the popular “will” – or, indeed, by distinctly un-republican concepts such as Christian values and natural law. While the democratic doctrine of the Constitution seems politically naïve, the philosophy of natural law has not meaningfully survived the processes of secularisation that Ireland has undergone since independence. As a result, contemporary Irish constitutional culture lacks a definite philosophical identity. I have not argued that historically, the 1937 Bunreacht can be understood as a quintessentially or authentically “republican” charter. However, I have argued that despite the absence of a republican discourse in Irish constitutional culture, its existing devices and institutions can be reconceptualised in a republican light, or at least in a manner that is consistent with republican ways of thinking about political freedom and individual rights. In turn, the Constitution provides a fruitful avenue for republican thinking in the context of a revived interest in civic-republican thought in contemporary Ireland."
