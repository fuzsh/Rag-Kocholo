        "text": "In 1993, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 1993 was introduced, the enactment of which would result in the decriminalisation of sexual acts between men. This was the culmination of decades of gay rights activism and lobbying, including a famous legal case taken by Senator David Norris. The legislation was sponsored by then-Fianna Fáil Deputy and Minister for Justice, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn.\n\nBród 93/23 heard from key players who contributed to delivering this landmark legislation, with Senator Norris, Máire Geoghegan-Quinn and equality and human rights activist Kieran Rose participating in a panel conversation moderated by disability rights activist Suzy Byrne.\n\nSpeaking at the event, the Cathaoirleach stated:\n\nDecriminalisation was a huge step in Ireland’s ability to progress towards equality for the LGBTQIA+ community. Thirty years ago, an important step was taken which changed the lives of many people in Ireland. We have come a long way over the last 30 years through a combination of efforts that have advanced equality for the LGBTQIA+ community to the point where we can proudly gather in Leinster House.\n\nThe Cathaoirleach also thanked Senator David Norris for his “leadership, courage and determination” on the issue. Senator Norris is to retire from the Seanad in 2024.\n\nThe reception following the panel discussion featured a performance from the Dublin Gay Men’s Chorus. An exhibition entitled Living with Pride, featuring the photographs of Christopher Robson, which was created by the National Library of Ireland, was also on display during the event."
