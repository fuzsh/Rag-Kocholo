But what you might not know is: The letter G is quite rare as a first letter for girls' names: only 2.1% of all common girls' names in the US begin with a G. The most common first letters for girls' names are A and S, while U and X are the least common first letters of girls' names.\n\nWith nine letters, the name Gabriella is relatively long compared to other names. In fact, 5.6% of all common first names in the US consist of exactly nine letters. 92% of all first names are shorter, while not even 2.5% of all boys’ and girls’ names use ten or more letters. On average, first names in the US (not counting hyphenated names) are 6.5 letters long with no significant differences between boys' and girls' names."
