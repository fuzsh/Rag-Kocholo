        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfession Actress\n\nBirth name Gabriella Zanna Vanessa Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe\n\nBritish nationality\n\nBirth April 8, 1989\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nComing from an aristocratic British family, Gabriella took art classes at the City and Guilds of London Art School but dropped out before graduating to pursue her career as a model. She then lent her image to major brands such as Burberry or Lacoste and posed for Vogue and Cosmopolitan.\n\nIt was in 2009 that she debuted on screen and chose an artist name: Wilde, with the film St. Trinian’s 2 . Versatile, Gabriella Wilde enjoyed success on the stage at the Royal National Theater and in the musical “Dirty Dancing” where she played Bébé’s sister. She then returned to the sets but this time on the small screen, making appearances in the series Trinity and Doctor Who in 2010.\n\nThe same year, Gabriella played alongside Milla Jovovich and Orlando Bloom in the action film The Three Musketeers by Paul W. S. Anderson . Starring in Carrie in 2013, alongside Julianne Moore and the very fashionable Chloë Moretz , her character Sue Snell allowed her to prove herself and placed her among the promising actresses of her generation. As proof: in 2014, she played one of the two main roles in the romance Un Amour sans fin alongside Alex Pettyfer ."
