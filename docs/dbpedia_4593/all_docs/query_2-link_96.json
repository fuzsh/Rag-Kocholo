        "text": "Milton Glaser Inc. , a luminary ray of light in the graphic design realm, stands as an iconic figure whose influence has rippled through decades of creative expression. Glaser left an indelible mark and reshaped the visual landscape with his innovative and eclectic design sensibilities. As a co-founder of Push Pin Studios, Glaser played a pivotal role in bringing forth a new era of design that embraced vibrant colors, intricate illustrations, and a fusion of artistic styles. His crowning achievement, the universally recognised \"I Love NY\" logo, became an emblem of pop culture and showcased Glaser's ability to distil complex concepts into visually striking and memorable designs. Central to Glaser's philosophy was the belief that design could transcend cultural and linguistic barriers, creating a visual language that resonates universally. In his words, \"The work is important, not the person who did it,\" emphasizing the enduring power of design to communicate across boundaries. Today, Milton Glaser's artistic legacy continues to cast a vibrant and enduring influence on contemporary graphic design, a testament to his ability to deftly marry artistic expression with commercial design and leave an everlasting imprint on the visual storytelling landscape.

But I have to mention that I am pursuing two tracks. One track is for my interdisciplinary and multimedia art including collaboration and intercultural projects. The other track is more focused on so-called decorative art and design. Prints, illustrations and design drafts that serve as templates for postcards, home and office furnishings, scarves, mugs, T-shirts and many other things. That is why I have now set up an onlineshop under \"Joh-Images\" for my decorative art on Redbubble. Redbubble acts as an intermediary between creator and customer. Their service allows artists to post and retail their designs, and will produce their products on demand and send them directly to customers. This makes the process of manufacturing easier on the artist, and the process of browsing friendlier to the customer. Redbubble lets you shop thousands of artist-created products, from classic art prints, new stickers or mugs, phone cases, fan tees, home decor, and fun gift ideas, all searchable by intuitive, well-organized categories. However, I have a very wait-and-see attitude towards the newly established online shop. It simply remains to be seen how the new shop develops and if it brings any kind of progress in the long term. https://lnkd.in/e2hWpJ39"
