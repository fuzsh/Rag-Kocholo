        "text": "Buried among the film credits on Gabriella Wilde’s IMDB Web page is an item that seems appropriate more for Burke’s Peerage than for a film-trade site: “Paternal granddaughter of the 2nd Baronet Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe and a descendant of Charles II, King of England, Ireland and Scotland, in turn twice great-great-great grandson of Margaret Tudor, sister of Henry VIII, and of Joan the Mad, sister of Catherine of Aragon,” it reads, just below the 24-year-old actress and model’s birth name, Gabriella Zanna Vanessa Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe. Wilde is the daughter of the British businessman John Austen Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, and her luminous blonde-ingénue looks have helped her land a string of high-profile roles that are reprises of parts played by some of the most accomplished stars of the past. Her breakout was as Constance in the 2011 remake of The Three Musketeers, the role played by June Allyson in the 1948, Gene Kelly version. In last year’s remake of Carrie, she re-created the part of Sue Snell, Carrie’s tormentor—Amy Irving in the 1976, Brian De Palma version. This month, in a new rendering of Franco Zeffirelli’s 1981 Endless Love, she walks in the footsteps of Brooke Shields as Jade Butterfield, playing opposite Alex Pettyfer. Wilde, who was discovered at 14 by Naomi Campbell, says that the explicit sex sequences in Endless Love don’t push the envelope quite the way they did in Zeffirelli’s version. “This film is tamer,” she says. “Still, it is an intimidating thing. The fact that the director is a woman”—Shana Feste, who previously directed Country Strong—“helped calm me down for the big moments.” Wilde, who is expecting a baby with her fiancé, Alan Pownall, of the band Pale, says she wants to get away from playing American teenage roles. “My only experience with American things is through movies,” she says. “I had to pick up the nuances from the other actors, so after two studio films I’d like to graduate from high-school parts, and maybe even try an independent film.”\n\nStyle\n\nJustin Timberlake Loses New York Driving Privileges in DUI Hearing\n\nThe judge also scolded the singer's defense attorney for making “irresponsible” comments about Timberlake's level of intoxication.\n\nMovies\n\nIs a Britney Spears Biopic Officially in the Works?\n\nWicked producer and director duo Marc Platt and Jon M.
