        "text": "SNOOTY beauty Caroline Penvenen is the latest addition to TV’s Poldark – and the actress who plays the blue-blooded heiress is just as posh as she is.\n\nFor while she appears in the BBC1 drama’s credits simply as Gabriella Wilde, she was actually born Gabriella Zanna Vanessa Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe.\n\nAnd that wasn’t just too much of a mouthful for her acting career — even her family have shortened her cumbersome moniker to Bumpy, short for her childhood nickname, Bumble Bee.\n\nGabriella said: “I was going to change my name for obvious reasons and I couldn’t think of a name to change it to.\n\n“I was with my agent and she just suggested Wilde because we were looking through her bookcases and an Oscar Wilde was there. So that became the name.”\n\nThe 27-year-old actress can trace her lineage back to Charles II, Henry III’s sister Margaret Tudor and Joanna the Mad, the unfortunately-dubbed sister of Catherine of Aragon.\n\nHer father is super-wealthy businessman John Anstruther-Gough- Calthorpe and there are baronets and baronesses throughout her family tree.\n\nOn top of that, she is the “unofficial stepsister” of Prince Harry’s ex, Cressida Bonas, who she describes as her best friend.\n\nShe said: “There are just two months between Cressida and me and although we’re not officially stepsisters, she was my best friend when we were little and we grew up together, so she kind of is anyway.”\n\nFor Gabriella, stardom was on the cards from an early age. At 14 she was “spotted” at a dinner party by Naomi Campbell, who saw her potential as a catwalk star and introduced her to top modelling agency Premier.\n\nIt signed her immediately and Gabriella has gone on to model for LK Bennett, Burberry, Topshop and Vogue.\n\nIn 2007 she was named the second-most-eligible girl in Britain by high-society magazine Tatler, but she fiercely rejected the “It girl” label.\n\nShe said at the time: “I don’t understand why I got anywhere near such a list because I have done nothing to help it.\n\n“It’s the same with my sister Isabella. We both avoid the society thing, we never go to parties, we never hang out in the clubs associated with all that. We are incredibly private.\n\n“I have never had the ambition to be famous for nothing.\n\n“You have to do something with your life.”\n\nEven so, Gabriella was a bit of a rebel in her early years.\n\nShe grew up in Hampshire and went to posh all-girls school Heathfield, in Ascot, Berks — where Sienna Miller and fashion designer Tamara Mellon were also educated.\n\nBut when she was caught smuggling vodka into school she was suspended and transferred to St Swithun’s, in Winchester, Hants.\n\nShe said: “In boarding school everyone’s thing is to get out, so I would just sneak out a lot and go to London.\n\n“We would go to someone’s house and sit there, but it was just the fact that you were kind of taking your life into your own hands a little bit and it was fun.”\n\nDrinking wasn’t the only way Gabriella rebelled — she also became obsessed with escaping the confines of her all-girls school to meet boys.\n\nShe said: “At that age — 13 until I was 16 — anything you are told you can’t have, you want, and you sort of rebel against that. Having boys entirely removed is bizarre, so all you think about is boys!\n\n“The point of being at an all-girls school is to remove that distraction so you are more focused on school. But it makes you more focused on the boys.”\n\nHer acting debut came in 2009 with a role in the film St Trinian’s 2 alongside Rupert Everett and Colin Firth. She also appeared in Doctor Who before landing her first major screen role, in the 2011 adaptation of The Three Musketeers, starring Matthew Macfadyen and Luke Evans.\n\nRoles followed in remakes of the classic movies Carrie and Endless Love, in which she had to film an explicit sex scene with co-star Alex Pettyfer. She said: “It is an intimidating thing. The fact that the director is a woman (Shana Feste) helped to calm me down for the big moments.”\n\nIn Poldark, which continues this Sunday at 9pm on BBC1, Gabriella’s character Caroline finds herself pursued by prospective MP Unwin Trevaunance (Hugh Skinner).\n\nAt the same time she has also caught the eye of Dr Dwight Enys (Luke Norris), and they develop a volatile love-hate relationship.\n\nGabriella said: “Her interest is originally piqued by Dr Enys because he is the one man who doesn’t fall at her feet and try to impress her.\n\n“He is quite rude to her and that’s the first time anyone has stood up to her usual games. The cards she holds don’t necessarily work with him.\n\n“Also, he’s inappropriate for her, which is exciting — she’s not meant to spend time with someone like that and I think she relishes that.”\n\nGabriella’s own love life is far more straightforward — she is married to Alan Pownall, lead singer in cult electro band Pale. They have two sons — Sasha Blue was born in February 2014 and Shiloh Silva was born just after filming finished on Poldark earlier this year.\n\nIn fact the reason that Caroline’s pug Horace appears in almost every Poldark scene was to hide Gabriella’s growing baby bump.\n\nExecutive producer Damien Timmer said: “Caroline has to come in with such power and make such a splash, and that’s hard.\n\n“It was a bit like casting Scarlett O’Hara. We looked and looked and then discovered Gabriella and offered it to her. Then two days later we discovered she was pregnant.\n\n“We persuaded ourselves that we could work around it, which we did, and Gabriella was amazing at coping with our manic schedule and her growing bump.”\n\nJoining such an established cast as Poldark’s was nerve-racking for Gabriella, who has never had such a major TV role before.\n\nShe said: “It was quite worrying because I had never been in that situation where you know you will be filming with an already established cast whose characters you know, having watched them in series one.\n\n“But they couldn’t have been more welcoming.”\n\nAs for her character, Gabriella added: “Caroline is a very young heiress who is quite badly behaved — she enjoys causing a bit of concern. She is very much a London girl so she stands out quite a lot as soon as she arrives and I think she initially turns her nose up at the people and the way of life down in Cornwall. But slowly she warms to it.”\n\nGabriella admitted finding working on set exhausting.\n\nShe said: “When you film period dramas it is quite physically demanding because of the costumes. Also, a lot of the locations were in these houses in the woods.\n\n“And being in England, it’s not warm. So that side of it was exhausting, and you have to find the stamina for it. The pace of it and the amount of material was all new to me, especially as we were filming ten episodes simultaneously.\n\n“Having to hold all of that in your head, plus I was pregnant and had terrible baby brain — I was probably the worst at remembering my lines!”"
