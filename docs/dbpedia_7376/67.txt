BIO

This tall, rugged and extremely prolific character actor broke through in the early 70s doing serious, honest youthful roles in critically acclaimed films like The Last Picture Show and The Last Detail. Quaid then gradually went on to more comedic turns, almost getting himself stuck in dimwitted unchallenging roles (notably National Lampoon's) during the 80s, before reviving himself with a serious of fine parts - both dramatic and comedic in the 90s.
