In 2012, he created his own YouTube channel where he does rant vlogs on various topics. His channel grew to popularity from 2015 onward when he voiced his support for President Elect, and later on President of the United States, Donald Trump. Some of his videos (albeit not all of them), involves him on camera, with an extreme close up, and the screen flashing many different colors, as he rants about random topics.

He hasn't starred in many TV shows and movies in a long time, and it's unknown if this is because of the time he's focused on his channel or if he's just mostly retired, but since he opened his channel he's only been in Tosh.0 as the announcer, which he's done from 2017 to present, and All You Can Eat as Gordon in 2018.
