        "text": "Last week's Noises off looked at theatrical productions so disastrous that they ended up in the Zero Stars Hall of Fame. But some of the most legendary missteps in theatre never even had a chance to make it into that hallowed hall, because they closed before they reached the critics.\n\nOn the other side of the ocean, Lone Star Love is the latest high-profile, Broadway-bound musical to crash and burn in spectacular style on its way to the Great White Way. This musical adaptation of The Merry Wives of Windsor has its origins in a 1970s play, and presented a starring role for a medium-calibre film star with a penchant for codpieces: Randy Quaid.\n\nNoises off must thank our favourite New York theatre blog Playgoer for continuing to keep us informed of the bizarre tale of how the Brokeback Mountain star broke the back of the musical's mounting (sorry). It was there that we learned the latest, startling development: \"In response to complaints of various outlandish bits of offensive behavior, [Quaid]'s been banned from Equity!\" Yes, he has been given a lifetime ban from the actor's union - and been fined $81,572 - for the antics that led to the $6.5m musical closing in Seattle last year.\n\nWhat did Quaid do to cause so much consternation among his fellow thesps? According to the always bloggable Michael Riedel in the New York Post, the Equity complaint assembled by the entire cast of Lone Star Love made these allegations:\n\n· \"Quaid hit an actor on the back of the head four times during performances. When the stage manager told him to stop, he smacked the actor again.\"\n\n· \"Another actor was warned that if he made direct eye contact with Quaid onstage, he'd be fired.\"\n\n· \"Quaid made 'sexually inappropriate' comments onstage, repeatedly referring to an actress' musical instruments as her 'gynecological instruments.'\"\n\n· \"[Quaid and his wife] tried to rewrite the script, to eliminate characters.\"\n\n· \"Randy 'felt free' to change blocking, lyrics and lines during performances, and repeatedly failed to show up for note sessions and rehearsals.\"\n\nAs blogger Culturebot puts it: \"Okay so this is the craziest thing I've ever heard. We've all been involved in productions that were rocky or even totally horrible. But this is really something.\"\n\nBut Ephemerist believes Quaid ultimately did a service to New York audiences: \"I think even the most devout theatregoer might be thankful they were spared the sight of Randy Quaid's codpiece-accented, magenta-haired interpretation of Falstaff.\" Yee-ha.\n\n· Meanwhile, Noises off has discovered the best-named theatre blogger in the 'sphere. He lives in Chicago, his blog is called Tynan's Anger, and his real-life moniker is ... Ethan Stanislawski. He wrote a post this week about the pros and cons of being a theatrical type and almost sharing a surname with the Russian who changed acting forever with his \"system\" and a little book called An Actor Prepares:\n\n\"One of the constant annoyances I face when I am introduced to people is that they automatically assume my name is spelled Stanislavsky ... Still, it's not a bad name to have for theater circles, and I was once even given free tickets to a show desperate to fill its house based on my name alone. So all in all, I'm about even with my last name.\"\n\nIn addition to having a great name for a theatre writer, Stanislawski also has a great nickname, Method Man, which will only be funny to people familiar with both Lee Strasberg and rap icons."
