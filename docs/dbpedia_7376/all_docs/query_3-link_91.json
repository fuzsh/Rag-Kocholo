        "text": "Actor Dennis Quaid became visibly distressed while sharing an intimate struggle within his family as it relates to his brother Randy, a former actor who has largely disappeared from Hollywood.\n\nThe Daily Caller noted a recent interview where the Academy Award-nominated star reminisced on his large extended family and especially his brother who he suggested is facing a difficult trial since attempting to flee Los Angeles for Canada in 2020, telling friends that he believed there was a plot to murder him. Randy Quaid also drew attention from former President Donald Trump after raising questions about the presidential election that year. “Randy doesn’t like me to talk about … what’s going on with him. All I can say is that I really love my brother, and I miss my brother,” Quaid told podcast host Patrick Bet-David on Friday.\n\n(VOTE: Are You Supporting TRUMP Or KAMALA In November?)\n\nRandy, 73, also earned an Oscar nomination for his role opposite Jack Nicholson in 1973’s The Last Detail and appeared in over 90 films throughout his two decades in moviemaking. To leave that level of fame behind, his brother said, left a void in the profession that can’t be filled. “And I will say this, you know, Randy could have like a great third act,” Quaid continued, prompting Bed-David to reply, ” … in the movies, and I would love to see that. He’s one of the best actors [that we’ve] produced in this country.” Quaid compared his brother to some of Hollywood’s greats including Nicholson and Marlon Brando, choking up as he all but pleaded for Randy to come home.\n\nThe inseparable brothers rose in unison, earning stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame just two years apart in 2003 and 2005. Randy brandished his comedic chops for all to see in the National Lampoon’s “Vacation” series as Cousin Eddie, the boisterous in-law to Chevy Chase’s Clark Griswold. He mentored his younger brother Dennis from their early years in Texas onward, making other notable appearances in movies “Kingpin,” “Brokeback Mountain,” “Days of Thunder” the 1996 hit “Independence Day” starring Will Smith.\n\nWATCH:\n\nHowever, Randy Quaid’s legal troubles began to set his career back. In 2009, he and his second wife, model Evi Quaid, were arrested for allegedly defrauding an innkeeper during a stay in Santa Barbara, California when they used an invalid credit card to foot a $10,000 bill, according to the Independent. The actor was ultimately given a three-year suspended sentence. Just one year later, both were charged with burglary after illegally staying in a guest house they once owned in the city. The incident led both to request asylum in Canada, claiming they feared for their lives and that a shadowy network they termed the “Hollywood star whackers” was plotting an assassination attempt against them. In 2015, Evi Quaid wore a mask of Fox News founder Rupert Murdoch while the couple posted a simulated sex video, a bizarre episode from which Randy’s image never recovered. The couple later fled to Vermont after being threatened with deportation by Canadian officials.\n\nSeveral weeks after the 2020 election, President Trump singled out Randy Quaid for supporting his claims that President Joe Biden stole the election. “Thank you Randy, working hard to clean up the stench of the 2020 Election Hoax!” he wrote in November of that year."
