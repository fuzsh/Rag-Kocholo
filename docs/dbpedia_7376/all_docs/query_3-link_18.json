        "text": "Meg Ryan is not having the debate over nepo babies.\n\nIn fact, the When Harry Met Sally star recently shared her perspective on the conversation surrounding nepotism in Hollywood, explaining that she feels reducing her son Jack Quaid—whom she shares with ex Dennis Quaid—to who his movie star parents are is more reductive than anything.\n\n\"You don't wish it [on anyone]. It's too hard and it's too weird,\" Meg told Glamour in an interview published Nov. 30, referring to the onslaught of scrutiny that comes with working in the limelight. \"Jack is really talented. He's more of a natural than I'll ever be. That nepo stuff is so dismissive of his work ethic, his gifts, and how sensitive he is to the idea of his privilege.\"\n\nBut the Sleepless in Seattle actress knew The Boys star had a gift long before he stepped in front of the camera.\n\nAs for the Oppenheimer actor, who made his movie debut in 2012's The Hunger Games, he's spoken about his decision to follow in his parents' footsteps.\n\nBut as he's navigated the industry, he's tried to forge his own path, with him initially toying with changing his last name and later declining his dad's offer to share his agent.\n\n\"I knew that people would constantly say, 'Oh, I know how he got that job,'\" Jack told Thrillist in June 2022. \"And they're still going to say that. It's fine. But as long as I knew how I got there, that would be enough.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old even recalled a casting director at one of his earlier auditions telling him they were shocked that he was \"actually really good\" since she expected him to rely solely on his nepotism, adding they thought he would \"be a real a--hole.\""
