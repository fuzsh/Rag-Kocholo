His channel grew to popularity from 2015 onward when he voiced his support for President Elect, and later on President of the United States, Donald Trump. Some of his videos (albeit not all of them), involves him on camera, with an extreme close up, and the screen flashing many different colors, as he rants about random topics.\n\nHe hasn't starred in many TV shows and movies in a long time, and it's unknown if this is because of the time he's focused on his channel or if he's just mostly retired, but since he opened his channel he's only been in Tosh.0 as the announcer, which he's done from 2017 to present, and All You Can Eat as Gordon in 2018.\n\nHistory[]\n\nRandy Quaid was born on October 1st, 1950. Quaid would start acting in the early 70s, he first rose to success with The Last Detail in 1973. In 1983 Quaid would appear in National Lampoons Vacation, as the main character Clark Griswald's southern cousin. Quaid would continue to star in the movies through the 80s and 90s.\n\nQuaid was arrested for not paying hotel bills. In 2010 Quaid would start to become paranoid and his mental health would decline and would appear in less and less movies. Quaid would start to make up conspiracy theories.\n\nQuaid would not appear in the 2015 Vacation movie, which was a reboot of the National Lampoons Vacation films.\n\nChannel[]\n\nOn January 11, 2012, Quaid would create his channel.[2][3] On his channel Quaid would often make ranting videos, where he would rant and do random things, with lights flashing in the backgrounds with his face close up to the camera.
