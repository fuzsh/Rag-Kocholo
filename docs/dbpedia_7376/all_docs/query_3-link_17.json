        "text": "Randy Quaid is a Golden Globe-winner and an Oscar and Bafta nominee who was discovered by Peter Bogdanovich. But perhaps the single most celebrated moments of his career involves him hurtling up the glowing urethra of an alien attack saucer poised over Area 51.\n\nThe scene appears in Roland Emmerich’s 1996 blockbuster Independence Day – and it was Quaid’s triumphant battle cry of “Hello boys, I’m ba-aack!”, with just the right yoo-hoo! inflection on the last word, that made a very silly action-movie moment immediately iconic.\n\nIn February this year, Quaid posted a video on Twitter in which he gave the beloved “I’m ba-aack” catchphrase another airing. The context was rather different, though: he said it while pretending to have rough sex with his wife Evi, who was wearing a bikini and a Rupert Murdoch mask, while an unseen dog barked in the background.\n\nThrow in his supporting part alongside Brando and Nicholson in The Missouri Breaks, a memorable turn as Cousin Eddie in the National Lampoon Vacation comedies, and major character roles in everything from Days of Thunder to Brokeback Mountain, and it’s an unusual career arc to say the least. But Quaid is an unusual case.\n\nOver the last few years this funny, talented actor has gone through one of the saddest, strangest declines Hollywood has ever seen. Aside from Will Smith, he’s the only major cast member of Independence Day not to appear in this summer’s belated sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence – and though yes, that’s partly because his character died in the first one, another favourite supporting player left for dead in that film makes a comeback.\n\nIf it had been at all feasible to have him burst through an airlock and roar that catchphrase again, you can bet 20th Century Fox would have had him do it.\n\nNow 65 years old, with a bushy white mountain man’s beard, Quaid has spent most of his time since his last credited screen role in 2009 on the run from US law enforcement. The trouble began in September of that year, when Quaid and his wife were arrested in Texas: they’d left a hotel in California with an outstanding tab of around $10,000 on their room. (Further unpaid hotel bills have since come to light.)\n\nA year later, they were arrested again, this time for squatting in the guest house of a home they’d owned some years ago. Various court dates for both arrests were set and missed, and well into six figures of bail money was forfeited. The first case was eventually dismissed against Randy for lack of evidence, while Evi was sentenced to 240 hours of community service. Four days after warrants were issued for their arrest over the second, the Quaids popped up in Canada, where they until last year, just out of the clutches of US law enforcement.\n\n“I’ve had eight friends of mine who have either died mysteriously or had scandals surrounding them in recent years,” Quaid said in a television interview in 2010, before explaining that the Star Whackers m.o. involves manipulating the banking and criminal justice systems from within, in order to creating “a scandal or a mystery around a celebrity that discredits them.”\n\nAccording to the Quaids, Heath Ledger, David Carradine and Chris Penn were three such victims, and were convinced they, along with Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan, were next on the list.\n\nQuaid’s career certainly made sense for a while. In the 1970s, he worked with New Hollywood auteurs like Bogdanovich and Hal Ashby – whose film The Last Detail secured him Oscar, Golden Globe and Bafta nominations – until the success of the Vacation films in the 1980s gave him a profile as a comic character actor that led to higher profile work the following decade, including in Kingpin and (of course) Independence Day.\n\nThis was exactly the point at which Quaid’s now relatively high profile as a character should have secured him a steady stream of worthwhile work. Instead, the late 1990s and early 2000s are a wasteland of bad choices: disposable TV films, yet more Vacation sequels, and roles in some of the most notable bombs of the late 20th century, including Pluto Nash and The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle.\n\nThings looked momentarily rosier in 2007 when Quaid was cast in the Falstaff role in Lone Star Love, an American Civil War-set reinterpretation of Shakespeare’s The Merry Wives of Windsor.\n\nLast October, the couple were arrested in Vermont while crossing the border after being ordered by Canada to return to the US. They were later released, and now appear to be touring Vermont, which is Evi's home state - although they remain wanted elsewhere in other parts of the US.\n\nIn an interview at the time of his arrest, Quaid said he hoped to eventually return to acting, either in film or television, although hope may be about as far as it gets. Flaming out in a blaze of eccentricity rarely works out as well as the movies make it seem."
