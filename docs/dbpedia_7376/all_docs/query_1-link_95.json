        "text": "Actor Randy Quaid, recognizable for his movie roles including as a heroic kamikaze pilot in the blockbuster action film \"Independence Day,\" is in a Vermont jail held on $500,000 bail.\n\nQuaid and his wife, Evi, who is also jailed in Vermont with a high bail amount, are accused of being fugitives from justice in California after being charged with felony vandalism there.\n\nFriday evening, the Quaids were detained at the border of Canada and Vermont while trying to re-enter the United States after Canadian officials granted Evi Quaid citizenship but denied Randy Quaid permanent residence and said he would be deported.\n\nThey're wanted in Santa Barbara, California, to face felony charges filed in 2010 after they were found squatting in a guesthouse of a home they previously owned.\n\nCourt papers said the Quaids damaged or destroyed furniture, a fireplace and a mirror in the guesthouse. They're charged with occupying the property illegally and failure to appear for court dates. Evi Quaid also is charged with impeding Santa Barbara sheriff's deputies.\n\nRandy Quaid's defense attorney, Peter Langrock, said his client believed he could lawfully stay in the pool house of the property.\n\nThe Quaids had separate court appearances Monday -- she in Burlington, near the state women's prison where she is being held, and he 28 miles north in St. Albans, near the men's prison where he is locked up.\n\nIn St. Albans, the actor argued unsuccessfully for lower bail, saying his legal woes were the fault of a bail bondsman who failed to notify him of a scheduled court appearance.\n\n\"We heard about it through the Internet that we had missed this court appearance that we didn't know anything about,\" Quaid told Judge Alison Arms of the criminal division of the Franklin Superior Court. \"Our names never appeared on the [California] court docket.\"\n\nThe judge repeatedly said that $500,000 was unusually high bail for property crimes, but added she was not persuaded to \"undermine\" a California court's decision and lower it.\n\nJudge Arms asked Langrock if he could validate his client's claims about the bail bondsman. The lawyer said he had a document from a California state agency that regulates bail bondsmen, but the judge was not satisfied.\n\n\"The court has nothing that validates anything that [Quaid] is saying,\" Arms said. \"What the court has right now is a $500,000 warrant from a judge in California.\"\n\nFranklin County State's Attorney Jim Hughes asked for a three-day continuance of the case, saying that because California's courts were closed for the Columbus Day holiday, he had been unable to obtain some needed paperwork to flesh out the legal case against the Quaids in California.\n\nHughes asked that in the meantime, the Vermont court defer to the bail set in California.\n\n\"For Vermont, it's just a matter of holding him until he voluntarily goes to California or is taken there under a governor's warrant,\" Hughes told necn after the court hearing.\n\nHughes said his office, as well as Vermont State Police and federal law enforcement agents, handled Quaid they would anyone else, regardless of celebrity status."
