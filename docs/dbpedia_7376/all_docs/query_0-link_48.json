        "text": "Canadian immigration officials have denied U.S. actor Randy Quaid's request for permanent resident status, despite claims from the fugitive actor that a cabal of assassins called the \"Hollywood star-whackers\" have targeted him and his wife.\n\nA Canadian government official confirmed late Saturday his request for permanent status has been denied. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Quaid can appeal the decision to the federal court.\n\nU.S. officials last year refused to seek extradition of the actor and his wife, Evi, from Canada to face felony vandalism charges in Santa Barbara, Calif., but authorities in the coastal town say they'll still have the couple arrested if they return to the U.S.\n\nQuaid has sought to stay in Canada, claiming he was being hunted by \"Hollywood star-whackers\" who had killed his friends David Carradine and Heath Ledger. The couple claimed other stars such as Mel Gibson, Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan also could be in danger.\n\nQuaid's trouble began in 2010 when he and his wife were arrested for causing more than $5,000 damage at a hillside home they were renting.\n\n_____\n\nAbrams excited about 'Star Wars' project\n\nJ.J. Abrams calls getting assigned to direct the seventh live-action \"Star Wars\" film \"as surreal as it is exciting.\"\n\nThe director-producer-writer spoke with a handful of media outlets on the red carpet before darting into the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday night. Abrams was there to accept the Norman Lear Achievement Award for such television works as \"Felicity\" (1998-2002), \"Alias\" (2001-2006), \"Lost\" (2004-2010), \"Fringe\" (2008-2013) as well as the current series \"Person of Interest\" and \"Revolution.\"\n\nAbrams also is proving to be a go-to director of successful new films for long-established franchises, such as \"Star Trek\" and \"Mission: Impossible.\"\n\nLast week, Lucasfilm officially announced Abrams' hiring for \"Star Wars: Episode VII,\" which has a tentative release date of 2015. \"Star Wars\" creator George Lucas personally endorsed Abrams in a statement: \"I've consistently been impressed with J.J. as a filmmaker and storyteller. He's an ideal choice to direct the new Star Wars film and the legacy couldn't be in better hands.\"\n\nAs for Abrams' plans for \"Episode VII\"?\n\n\"You know, obviously, it's so early,\" he replied. \"I can just say what I want to do: I want to do the fans proud. I want to make sure the story is something that touches people. And we're just getting started. I'm very excited.\"\n\n_____\n\nHarry's Afghan downtime: movies, candy trades\n\nPrince Harry's off-duty time in Afghanistan appeared to be full of war movies, board games and elaborate candy trades.\n\nThe 28-year-old helicopter pilot and fellow members of his squad swapped Kit Kats and Rice Krispies Squares for American soldiers' M&Ms, according to a British media pool report released Sunday.\n\nHarry himself outlined one of his less-prestigious duties. The third-in-line to the U.K. throne said anyone who lost at Uckers -- a military game similar to Ludo or Parcheesi -- had to then wait on his comrades like a Buckingham Palace butler, ready with a fresh cup of tea whenever anyone rang their bell.\n\n\"Whoever loses ... then you have to make brews for everybody all day,\" Harry told journalists ahead of his return to Britain this past week.\n\nHe also denied rumors that he was far better at PlayStation than at traditional board games.\n\n\"I don't know who told you that,\" he told reporters. \"I lost two days ago, and yesterday, so since you guys have been here I've only lost.\"\n\nHarry returned to Britain on Wednesday after a 20-week deployment in Afghanistan in which he acknowledged that he had targeted Taliban fighters from the cockpit of his Apache attack helicopter.\n\nAsked in an earlier round of interviews whether he had killed anyone, Harry said: \"Yeah, so, lots of people have.\" That admission disturbed some Britons and led to front-page headlines like the one in The Daily Mail that read: \"Harry: I Have Killed.\"\n\nThis latest round of interviews, focusing on Harry's daily life at Britain's Camp Bastion military base in Afghanistan, is not likely to draw the same kind of headlines.\n\nThe report mainly carried glimpses of the prince's daily routine, including his favorite foods -- chicken and broccoli -- and his favorite movies -- \"Full Metal Jacket,\" \"Apocalypse Now,\" and \"Platoon.\"\n\nIn an interesting twist for an Apache pilot, \"Black Hawk Down,\" the Ridley Scott film about a helicopter raid gone wrong in Somalia, was among the movies spotted in Harry's communal tent.\n\n_____\n\nToday's birthdays: Actor Alan Alda is 77.
