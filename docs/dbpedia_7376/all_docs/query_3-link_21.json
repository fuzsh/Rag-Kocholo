        "text": "First of all, he’s called Randy, which already puts him among the elect: Randy Brown, soul singer extraordinaire, and Randy California, late guitarist with LA band Spirit, are others worthy of their own posts. He has appeared in over 90 films, a couple of which are among the finest Hollywood has ever produced. But it is Randy Quaid’s bizarre post-millennial behaviour that really redefines his career, blurring the lines between the actor and the man, fiction and fact, as hilariously and satisfyingly as Martin Scorsese’s lame Dylan mockumentary Rolling Thunder doesn’t.\n\nIt’s odd that Randy never worked with Scorsese. He’s worked with some of the almost-greats (Hal Ashby, Peter Bogdanovich, Walter Hill, Arthur Penn) and some of the not-so-greats (Alan Parker). Time was, he could have written his next role for himself and picked his director, But he wasn’t (isn’t) Italian American, so never got the nod from Marty, and maybe that’s why Randy went off the rails and started imagining shit.\n\nBut back to the beginning, and Texas. Peter Bogdanovich, flush from the success of Targets, plucked Randy from the University of Houston, and put him in The Last Picture Show, where he slipped effortlessly and naturally into the role of a mentally retarded hick, albeit a rich hick, who escorts equally rich bitch Jacy Farrow (Cybill Shepherd) to a skinny-dipping party.\n\nRandy then shifted up a gear and won major acclaim, including an Oscar nomination, for his role in Hal Ashby’s The Last Detail (1973) playing another young simpleton, this time a sailor on a charge being accompanied to prison by Jack Nicholson and Otis Young, who try to show the boy a good time before he goes behind bars. Again Randy had the knack of being in the right film at the right time – Hal Ashby would never better The Last Detail any more than Peter Bogdanovich would recapture the perfection of The Last Picture Show.\n\nIt’s a wonder, really, given his later behaviour, that Randy didn’t get the gig as one of the nutjobs in Cuckoo’s Nest, but he was at least reunited with Nicholson in Arthur Penn’s genuinely weird western The Missouri Breaks, and two years later turned in another notable performance, chewing the scenery in Midnight Express, Alan Parker’s best film (which isn’t saying much). He then appeared alongside his much better-looking brother Dennis in The Long Riders (1980). Walter Hill’s classy and ultra-violent western was notable for the inspired decision to cast four sets of acting brothers: apart from Randy and Dennis, there were James and Stacy Keach as the James brothers; David, Keith and Robert Carradine as the Youngers, and Christopher and Nicholas Guest as the Fords. Though not quite as good as Phillip Kaufman’s Great Northfield Minnesota Raid, this is still a decent addition to the Walter Hill oeuvre, made between The Warriors and Southern Comfort, to my mind Walt’s two best films (though neither star Randy Quaid, more’s the pity – he might not have made much of a Noo Yawk gang member but he woulda been a shoe-in for a Cajun hillbilly, huh huh huh!)\n\nAlas, The Long Riders and the start of the 80s mark the beginning of a downward spiral in Randy’s career, although things perked up briefly with Parents (1989) a black (very black) comedy set in 1950s America. It was around this time that Randy also met and married a Los Angeles model, Evi, with whom he would later have so many run-ins with the law. The problems really started with Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain (2005) when Randy sued the producers for misrepresenting the film as “a low-budget, art house film with no prospect of making money” in order to secure his services at a bargain-basement price. Then, in 2008, The Actors’ Equity Association banned Quaid for life after all 26 cast members of a Broadway musical brought charges that he had “physically and verbally abused his fellow performers” and that the show closed because of Quaid’s “oddball behaviour”. As if to confirm this, Randy and wife were arrested for defrauding an innkeeper in Santa Barbara by using an invalid credit card to pay their bill.\n\nTo make matters worse, or weirder, in 2010 they were charged with burglary after they spent five days occupying the guest house of a home they had once owned, claiming that the deeds had been transferred by means of a forged signature. In October that year they moved to Vancouver, where they sought asylum under the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, stating that they feared for their lives at the hands of the Hollywood Star Whackers, a shadowy cabal who had engineered the deaths of various Hollywood celebrities including Heath Ledger, David Carradine and Chris Penn. The Quaids were convinced that they were next on the list. This was not the first time that crazy movie stars have alleged they are on a death list, of course. Mia Farrow – prior to marrying Woody Allen – was convinced that she was next on Charles Manson’s hit list (she wasn’t, but unlike the Hollywood Star Whackers, the Manson list did at least exist).\n\nBy 2015, Quaid’s legal appeals in Canada were exhausted, as were Canadians, and he was notified of his imminent deportation. One week prior to the deportation date, the couple drove across the border into Vermont and were detained pending an extradition order from the State of California. In an interview at the time of his arrest, Quaid said he hoped to return to acting, but few could have predicted the manner in which it would happen. After a Vermont judge found irregularities in the extradition order, the Quaids were released and allowed to post a video on Twitter in 2017 which must rank among Randy’s very finest work (i.e. Last Picture Show, Last Detail, Long Riders). Echoing the astonishing Richard-Nixon-mask-as-sex-aid scene in Ang Lee’s The Ice Storm, Randy pretends to have sex with Evi, who is wearing a Rupert Murdoch mask, while an unseen dog barks in the background. It has to be seen to be believed, and it has to be seen in full!\n\nThat probably isn’t all folks! This, after all, is a man who has played the King of Spain, Lyndon Baines Johnson AND Frankenstein’s Monster, and not many actors can say that. Actually, no other actors can. Sure, he also appears in a bunch of National Lampoon movies and shit like Days of Thunder and Independence Day, but we’ll gloss over that, because, to quote Travis Bickle ( a part Randy was born to play, but Scorsese preferred that De Niro guy), this is a man who stood up against the scum, the cunts, the dogs, the filth, the shit. This is a man who stood up. Randy Quaid, I salute you. But you need help…"
