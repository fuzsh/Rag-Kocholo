        "text": "Jack Quaid's fans are leaping to his defense after he was dragged by some on social media for having famous parents.\n\nDespite being a successful actor in his own right, known for his roles in The Boys, The Hunger Games and Scream, it's being pointed out that because he has famous parents, he might be benefiting from nepotism. Quaid's parents are Dennis Quaid (Far From Heaven) and Meg Ryan (When Harry Met Sally), while his uncle is actor Randy Quaid.\n\nThe term \"nepo baby\" is used as an insult by many online when they deem someone to have success only as a result of receiving help from famous or successful family members.\n\nNepo babies have become a talking point on social media, Twitter especially, after a Vulture article highlighted a number of entertainers today with influential parents who may have helped their career. The list included Lily-Rose Depp, ZoÃ« Kravitz, Tracee Ellis Ross and Ben Platt, to name just a few.\n\nJack Quaid was included on the list, but the reaction to his inclusion was batted away by many of his fans.\n\n\"I love how literally everyones takeaway from that nepo baby article is 'we love Jack Quaid though,'\" wrote @meatprison_, summarizing the mood of the internet. \"Like yes we very much do.\"\n\n\"Know that when I'm talking about how nepo babies are ruining the industry I am never ever talking about Jack Quaid,\" wrote @Ashwaysunny.\n\nJournalist Samantha Grindell also acknowledged Quaid's famous background, but suggested his popularity has outweighed the nepo baby tag. \"Jack Quaid is the people's nepo baby,\" she joked.\n\nTwitter user Ashley Reese claimed to be an ex-classmate of Quaid's and gave a glowing character reference. \"I think I only spoke with him a total of two times in high school but by my observation he was a chill, sweet dude. Doesn't mean he's not a nepo baby but hey, good for him, hope he has a rewarding career,\" she wrote.\n\nNot everyone thought that the collection of nepo babies in the article were totally deserving of their success though. Popular writer Meech suggested Quaid was one of the more fun ones though, writing: \"A lot of these nepo babies aren't talented, but they ARE fun! Like I would absolutely get drinks with Jack Quaid and Dakota Johnson.\"\n\nFilmmaker Tara Ansley also weighed in with her personal experience of working with Quaid. \"Jack Quaid is by far one of the most kind and normal actors I have ever worked with. He is a gem of a human,\" Ansley, who was an additional production assistant on The Hunger Games (according to IMDb), said. \"There is not an ounce of Hollywood nepo in the man. Just a nerd like the rest of us lol.\"\n\nAuthor Bolu Babalola suggested the most secure people listed on the Vulture nepo baby article will brush it off. \"I know all the coolest nepo babies laughed at the piece. Like I said if you're good at your job and chic and acknowledge your connection, no one [cares].\"\n\nQuaid reached a new level of fame when he starred in The Boys, which is due to continue with Season 4 in 2023. He was also revealed to be in Christopher Nolan's next movie, Oppenheimer, after the recent trailer dropped. \"Still can't believe I'm in a single frame of this thing,\" Quaid wrote after sharing the trailer on Twitter."
