        "text": "For five years, actor Randy Quaid’s life seemed as zany as some of the characters he plays in movies.\n\nQuaid and his wife, Evi, were living on the run in Canada. Not anymore. They were both arrested as he tried to cross the border into Vermont, according to the Vermont State Police.\n\nScott Waterman, Vermont State Police’s public information officer, told the Sun that U.S. Border Patrol agents detained Quaid and his wife as they crossed into the Highgate Port of Entry in Highgate, Vt., on Oct. 9.\n\nThey were apprehended at 8 p.m. and promptly handed over to the state police, who notified the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office.\n\nAccording to Sheriff’s Office Public Information Officer Kelly Hoover, the Quaids are each being held on a $500,000 bail and wanted on warrants for felony vandalism and misdemeanor trespassing. Evi faces an additional charge of resisting arrest.\n\nBoth Quaids were arrested in September of 2010 when they were found squatting in and damaging a Montecito home they once owned.\n\nThey were released on bail and didn’t show up for the subsequent court hearings. They later turned up in Canada.\n\nAccording to a story published by Vanity Fair in 2011, the Quaids were on the run from a group they called “the Hollywood Star Whackers,” whom they accuse of murdering other movie stars such as Heath Ledger and David Carradine.\n\nWhile in Canada, the Quaids applied for permanent residency, but only Evi was able to receive it because her father was born in Canada.\n\nWaterman said the process to extradite the Quaids has already begun. Both appeared in Vermont State Court on Oct. 12.\n\n“It is the intent of the Sheriff’s Office and District Attorney’s Office that Mr. and Mrs. Quaid, either voluntarily or if necessary by a warrant from the governor, go through the judicial process,” Hoover said.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Quaid just wants to “move on” with his life and resolve his legal problems."
