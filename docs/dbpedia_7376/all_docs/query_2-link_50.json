        "text": "Quaid History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nIreland\n\nThe original Gaelic form of Quaid was Mac Uaid, which means son of Wat.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Quaid family\n\nThe surname Quaid was first found in County Monaghan (Irish: Muineach√°n) located in the Northern part of the Republic of Ireland in the province of Ulster.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Quaid family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Quaid research. Another 65 words (5 lines of text) covering the year 1750 is included under the topic Early Quaid History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nQuaid Spelling Variations\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, a standardized literary language known by the general population of Ireland was a thing of fiction. When a person's name was recorded by one of the few literate scribes, it was up that particular scribe to decide how to spell an individual's name. So a person could have several spelling variations of his name recorded during a single lifetime. Research into the name Quaid revealed many variations, including McQuaid, McQuade, McWade, McQuid, McQuoid, McQuaide and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Quaid family\n\nNotable amongst the family name at this time was\n\nBernard John McQuaid, First Bishop of Rochester, U.S.A\n\nRev. John Charles McQuaid, present Archbishop of Dublin\n\nLoading...\n\nQuaid migration to the United States +\n\nThe 18th century saw the slow yet steady emigration of Irish families to British North America and the United States. Those early Irish settlers that left their homeland were typically moderately well off: they were enticed by the promise of a sizable plot of land. However, by the 1840s, this pattern of immigration was gone: immigrants to North America were seeking refuge from the starvation and disease that the Great Potato Famine of that decade brought. The great numbers of Irish that arrived to the United States and the soon to be Canada were instrumental in their quick development as powerful industrial nations. An examination of early immigration and passenger lists uncovered many early immigrants bearing the name Quaid:\n\nQuaid Settlers in United States in the 18th Century\n\nMorris Quaid, aged 18, who landed in New Jersey in 1776 1\n\nQuaid Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nEdward Quaid, who landed in New York, NY in 1811 1\n\nMichael R.

By 1838, the British New Zealand Company had begun buying land from the Maori tribes, and selling it to settlers, and, after the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, many British families set out on the arduous six month journey from Britain to Aotearoa to start a new life.
