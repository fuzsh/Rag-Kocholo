        "text": "Actor Randy Quaid and his wife Evi speak out about the \"Hollywood Star Whackers,\" a shadowy group they claim wants to kill them.\n\n\"They follow us. They tail us. They tag our cell phones. They hack our computer,\" Randy said during an interview with Good Morning America.\n\n\"It's the Mafia. It's organized crime,\" Evi added.\n\nThe Quaids also added three new names to the \"Star Whackers\" hit list: Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, and Mel Gibson.\n\nEvi says Gibson's infamous phone rant at girlfriend Oksana was a setup job.\n\n\"I think he was drugged, I think he was slipped a mickey. That's my personal opinion,\" she said.\n\nRandy says he also fears for his younger brother, actor Dennis Quaid.\n\n\"I love my brother very much. We have had our differences, but I'm concerned about him,\" he said.\n\nDennis Quaid had no comment about his older brother's bizarre behavior.\n\nMeanwhile, Randy told reporters he and his wife Evi are sane: \"We are not criminals nor are we fugitives from justice, nor are we crazy,\" he read from a prepared statement.\n\nRandy, who is seeking asylum in Canada, became choked up when reading the part of the statement referring to actor friends he claims were murdered:\n\n\"Eight actors, all of whom...all of whom I have worked with and was close to.\"\n\nHe also got worked up during the GMA appearance because his wife was hogging the interview\n\n\"Evi will you shut up for a minute, please!\" he shouted.\n\nBut Randy says despite the squabble, their struggles have only brought them closer."
