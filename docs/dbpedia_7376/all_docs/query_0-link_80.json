        "text": "For the second time this year, Hollywood actor Randy Quaid has been arrested in Montreal by Canada Border Services Agency agents.\n\nIn an interview with CBC News, Quaid's wife Evi said her husband was detained Tuesday morning after attending a regular check-in with CBSA officials in downtown Montreal.\n\nActor Randy Quaid to be released on bond after Montreal arrest\n\n​Robert Gervais, an official with the Immigration and Refugee Board, confirmed in an email to CBC News that a detention review hearing for Quaid has been scheduled for Thursday afternoon in Montreal.\n\nThe reasons for Quaid's arrest were not immediately clear. His lawyer, Mark Gruszczynski, refused to comment, and CBSA officials were not available.\n\nEvi Quaid said the arrest was a surprise, and CBSA officials did not clearly explain to her why her partner was being detained.\n\nShe said Quaid is being held at a detention centre in Laval.\n\n2nd arrest this year\n\nQuaid, 64, was arrested in Montreal in April.\n\nAn arrest warrant had been issued in January 2013 after the actor missed an appointment for an IRB interview.\n\nThe Quaids had applied for refugee status in 2010, claiming they were being persecuted in the U.S. and were possible targets of so-called \"Hollywood star-whackers\" who were bent on killing actors.\n\nEvi Quaid's father was born in Canada, and she was granted Canadian citizenship in 2012.\n\nRandy Quaid later withdrew his refugee claim and applied for permanent resident status. His immigration application, however, was denied in 2013 because, according to Federal Court documents, he had been accused of defrauding an innkeeper in California — an act that would be considered a Criminal Code offence in Canada.\n\nUntil last April, the Canadian government had no idea of Quaid's whereabouts after he failed to show up for the 2013 IRB interview.\n\nAs it turned out, the Quaids had been living in Montreal since February 2013.\n\nFreed in April with conditions\n\nIn April, IRB member Dianne Tordorf ordered Quaid released from detention in Montreal after his father-in-law agreed to post a $10,000 bond.\n\nHe was freed under certain conditions, which included regularly checking in with CBSA officials.\n\nEvi Quaid said her husband has been doing that, as required, since the IRB's April ruling.\n\nRandy Quaid is still technically under a removal order from Canada and could be ordered to leave the country at any time.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated actor has appeared in dozens of films dating back to 1971, including The Last Picture Show, Midnight Express, Brokeback Mountain, National Lampoon's Vacation and The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, which was shot in Montreal. He is the brother of actor Dennis Quaid.\n\nCheck out other top Montreal stories here:"
