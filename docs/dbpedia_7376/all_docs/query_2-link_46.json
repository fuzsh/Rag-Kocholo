        "text": "01 of 14\n\nChevy Chase (Clark Griswold)\n\nChevy Chase led the Griswold clan as patriarch Clark. The comedian picked up the role after previously appearing as the father figure in 1983's National Lampoon's Vacation and 1985's National Lampoon's European Vacation. Before attempting to get his fictional family in the holiday spirit in Christmas Vacation, Chase also earned credits for Foul Play (1978), Caddyshack (1980), and ¡Three Amigos! (1986), and rose to fame with an Emmy-winning gig on Saturday Night Live.\n\nChristmas Vacation was hardly the last time Chase played Clark Griswold. He revisited the part in 1997's Vegas Vacation, a 2007 episode of Family Guy, and 2015's Vacation. He expanded his résumé beyond the famed role, however, hitting the big screen in Snow Day (2000), Orange County (2002), Hot Tub Time Machine (2010), The Last Laugh (2019), and Zombie Town (2023). One of Chase's most notable characters, however, was that of Pierce Hawthorne on NBC's Community from 2009 to 2014.\n\n02 of 14\n\nBeverly D'Angelo (Ellen Griswold)\n\nAfter making a name for herself with appearances in Annie Hall (1977), Coal Miner's Daughter (1980), and Finders Keepers (1984), Beverly D'Angelo joined National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation as Ellen Griswold. This was her third time playing the wife to Chase's Clark and the mother of the Griswold family, after previous turns in National Lampoon's Vacation and National Lampoon's European Vacation.\n\nD'Angelo joined Chase in Vegas Vacation, the aforementioned episode of Family Guy, and Vacation. She expanded her range with Man Trouble (1992), Eye for an Eye (1996), American History X (1998), The House Bunny (2008), and Violent Night (2022). She also hit the small screen with roles on Rude Awakening in 1999, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Entourage in the 2000s, and Mom in 2015, as well as featured in recurring roles on Shooter, Insatiable, and True Lies, and appeared as a different character in a 2022 episode of Law & Order: SVU.\n\n03 of 14\n\nRandy Quaid (Eddie Johnson)\n\nThe older brother to actor Dennis Quaid, Randy Quaid picked up a familial role in Christmas Vacation as Ellen's relative, the famed Cousin Eddie. The gig was hardly his first, as his filmography was filled with movies like The Last Detail (1973) — for which he received an Oscar nomination — Midnight Express (1978), and The Long Riders (1980) long before the comedy hit theaters in 1989.\n\nFollowing National Lampoon's Vacation, Christmas Vacation, and Vegas Vacation, Quaid got his own spinoff with the 2003 made-for-TV movie, Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie's Island Adventure. He continued to act throughout the 2000s, booking parts in The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (2000), The Adventures of Pluto Nash (2002), and Brokeback Mountain (2005). In later years, however, Quaid has been famous more for his widespread legal troubles than his career.\n\n04 of 14\n\nJuliette Lewis (Audrey Griswold)\n\nJuliette Lewis picked up one of her earliest gigs as daughter Audrey of Christmas Vacation's Griswold family. She came into the role after a 1987 turn on the short-lived ABC series I Married Dora, a two-episode arc on The Facts of Life in 1988, and big-screen parts in 1988's My Stepmother Is an Alien and 1989's Meet the Hollowheads.\n\nFollowing Christmas Vacation, Lewis turned to television jobs on The Wonder Years and A Family for Joe before earning an Oscar nomination for the 1991 movie Cape Fear. One of the holiday comedy's most famous alumni, Lewis has stayed busy, booking movies such as What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), The Basketball Diaries (1995), From Dusk Till Dawn (1996), Old School (2003), Starsky & Hutch (2004), Whip It (2009), August: Osage County (2013), and Ma (2019).
