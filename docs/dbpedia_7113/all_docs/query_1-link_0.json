        "text": "Town in Kassala, Sudan\n\nKhashm el-Girba (Arabic: خشم القربة) is a town in Kassala (state), north-eastern Sudan, located on the Atbarah River. The Khashm el-Girba Dam is located about 4 km (2 mi) south of the town.\n\nThe name Khashm al-Qirbah is made up of two syllables \"Khashm\", meaning \"mouth\" in the Sudanese dialect, and \"Qarbah\", which is a container usually made of animal skin to carry water specifically during travel. Some have a number of Arabs nomads came to the water resource in the Setit River, one of the tributaries of the Atbara River, and drove their animals and took some water with them to continue their journeys and in the Khashm al-Qirba area before a group of the Hambata (bandits in the Sudanese deserts) met them and asked them to give it the water they carried, and when the Arabs refused that One of the bandits grabbed a calabash (a container to carry water) from what they were carrying and cut its mouth (meaning its mouth) with a knife, and the two teams clashed, and when people asked about the causes of the fighting, they were told that it was because of “the kharba blade”, and the battle site was later called Khashm al-Qirba.\n\nThere are those who cite another reason for calling the place this name, which is that the shape of the river and its curves give a shape similar to the shape of the gourd.\n\nKhashm al-Qirba is located on the dry savannah belt at a latitude of 14 degrees north, within the region of the Butana Plain, and the region is characterized by black clay soil and is split from the southeast side by the Atbara River, which stems from the Ethiopian and Eritrean highlands towards the eastern plains of Sudan, where it meets the two tributaries of the Setit River south of the city of Shawak. Which lies about 82 kilometers west of Khashm al-Qirba, and descends towards the northwest, where the large rocks continue to flow into the main Nile River at the city of Atbara. The river in the Khashm al-Qirba region is characterized by its steep slope and speed of flow, and it carries large quantities of silt and logs at its source and its course areas."
