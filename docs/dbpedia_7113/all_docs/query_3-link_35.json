        "text": "The study area lies in the Atmour Desert in the Northern State, Sudan, at about 50Km west of Karima city.The sedimentary Nubian Sandstone Formations are the main lithological unit crop out in the study area. These sedimentary rocks are a part of the sedimentary Nubian Saharan Basins (NSB) that represents an important groundwater aquifer in northern Sudan and the adjacent country. This study aims to investigate the potentialities of the groundwater for agricultural purposes. The investigations based on the remote sensing / GIS techniques, electrical geophysical survey in addition to the hydrogeological investigations. Remote sensing studies utilized the optical satellite imageries of Landsat 7ETM+ in addition to the Radar Interferometery SRTM for the elevation data. The main aimsare to reveal the geological, topographical aspects of the area, as well as to decipher the main lineaments and paleodrainage pattern. Geophysical geo-electrical survey applied in this study using Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) with Schlumberger array. A number of 100 VES's were carried along ten profiles lines perpendicular to the main fractures system in NW-SE direction. The acquired resistivity data were manipulated to construct the 2D & 3D lithological model. The satellite imageries disclosed two main fracture trends dominated by the NE-SW and NW-SE directions. A NW-SE trending phenomena indicates a depression that may mastering a configuration of a paleao-lake. The geophysical survey evident that there are two water bearing formations; the upper one lies at depth 80 to 130m below surface, while the lower one lies below the depth of 250 m from earth surface. From the hydrogeological investigations, Wells depths are dominantly range from 100 to 130m deep from surface. The measured water tables in the values range from 16 to 40 m from the surface. The water flow map revealed that the water levelsrange from 235m to 228m above mean sea level (a.m.s.l.), with a hydraulic gradient of 0.00014.\n\nRemote Sensing technology in this century is widely used in survey and very effective in identification of potential zones for groundwater exploration. In the study area the main rock types are schist, gneisses and quartzite Precambrian terrain of Khor Al Alabyad, Sudan. The main landform units in this area are valley fills lower and upper relief. Occurrence of groundwater in hard rock terrain is mainly controlled by structures, landforms, lithology and recharge conditions. The subsurface column consists of three resistivity layers, which obtained from upper to lower are composed of very dry superficial deposits, followed by an intercalation layer of weathered and fractured basement, then an impermeable hard basement complex respectively. Spectral resolution and geo-electrical resistivity survey has the potential to infer structures as well as lineaments and faults in this hard rock area. It&#39;s essential to identify the location of interconnected lineaments below buried channel p...\n\nAbstract: Lagawa and the surrounding area are suffering from shortage of drinking water, in particular during the dry season. Pre-Cambrian Basement Complex rocks underlain the study area. The basement rocks including Precambrian basement and younger anorogenic intrusive complexes. The older basement is represented by granitic gneisses and schists. The groundwater occurs in the Wadi alluvial deposits and weathered and fractured basement in the area. Six (6) horizontal electrical profiles (HEP) and six (6) spontaneous potential profiles (SPP) were conducting across the area, where as seven (7) vertical electrical soundings (VES) were carried along the profiles at the sites of detected anomalies by (HEP) and (SPP) methods. OYO MCHOM model 2119 Tetrameter applying Schlumberger configuration for all methods. The field data (VES) were processed and interpreted using standard curve matching approach and iterative vertical electrical sounding interpretation software IX1D version 2.07. The HEP & SPP show many anomalies that indicate fault line or fracture zones. The (VES) interpretation results show a subsurface of three zones, which are topsoil (alluvial deposits), weathered basement and fresh basement. So the final interpretation results detect that the best points for locating wells in the study area are VESs ; VES1, VES2, VES5 and 6. Keywords: Horizontal Electrical Profiling (HEP), Spontaneous Potential (SP), Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES), Groundwater exploration.\n\nRemote sensing and GIS studies have been utilized and aimed to reveal the geological, topographical aspects, as well as to decipher the main lineaments, structural and paleo-drainage patterns. Electrical Resistivity measurements have been carried out in form of Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) to show water bearing formations and the aquifer thickness. Remote sensing data revealed general elevation range between 154–588 m (a.m.s.l.), general slope is from North to the south and several primary paleo-drainage systems are clear depicted, the drainage system runs from the south-east to north-west. Resistivity data showed that aquifers are of good permeability and of regional recharge. The recommended depths of the boreholes to be drilled are ranging from 180 m to 240 m. Keywords – Resistivity, Remote sensing, GIS, Aquifer, Borehole.\n\nThis research involved the use of electrical resistivity technique which is considered most appropriate for subsurface investigation of structures and/or lithologies associated with the occurrence of groundwater; to investigate the geo-electric characteristics of the subsurface formations that underlie the study area. The aim was to provide a data base for sustainable groundwater development in the study area. The geophysical investigation involved the acquisition of twenty two (22) vertical electrical sounding (VES) data via the ABEM terrameter SAS 300C model using the Schlumberger configuration. These were quantitatively and qualitatively analysed using partial curve matching and computer iteration to obtain subsurface information in the study area. The results obtained from the interpretation of the VES data show earth models with geo electric layers ranging from three (3) to four (4). The representative type curves are H, A, HA, QH, HK and KH types. The subsurface is made up o...\n\nThis study includes application of (VES) Vertical Electrical Sounding for delineation of aquifers in the area located south and southwest of Samawa City, southern Iraq. The VES was carried out by using Schlumberger array in the 16 sounding points distributed along three profiles trending NW – SE, except one point that is not located within any profile. The field curves of apparent resistivity are interpreted by the application of forward calculation and inverse modeling. The results of the inverse modeling are used to construct three geo-electrical sections along electrical profiles, and then converted to geological sections by including the lithological well sections and all available geological and hydro-geological information. The results indicate the presence of three aquifers. The first is the Euphrates aquifer which is located at depths ranging between 1 and 7 m. This aquifer overlaps with the Ghar aquifer in the southeast area, and thus forming one hydro-geological unit. The thickness of this aquifer varies from 8 to 30 m. The second is the Ghar aquifer which appears at depths (1 – 3) m. The thickness of this aquifer ranges between 12 and 40 m. The third is Dammam aquifer, which occurs below the Euphrates aquifer in the north and southeast of the Al-Emaed spring. It also occurs below the Euphrates and the Ghar aquifers in the southeast end of the studied area; its depths ranges between 13 and 43 m, in most locations, but to the south and southwest of Al-Emaed spring, near the ground surface. Its thickness ranges between 100 and 120 m, and it splits into two parts in the area located north and southeast of Al-Emaed spring. The lower part is characterized by increased fractures in comparison with the upper part. The presence of hydraulic connection between these aquifers is observed and this agrees with previous studies."
