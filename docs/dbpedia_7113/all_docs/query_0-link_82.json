        "text": "Cyprinus carpio (Linnaeus, 1758) is a wide-world freshwater fish, and is among the top important aquaculture species of the world. Since there are no available data on the growth pattern of this species in Foum El-Khanga Dam Souk-Ahras, Algeria, this study was carried out to determine the condition factor, length-weight relationship, age and growth. A total of 347 specimens of C. carpio were collected from Foum El-Khanga Dam (Souk-Ahras, Algeria) by monthly sampling from March 2015 to February 2016. Significant differences were noticed between the mean length of females (33.44±0.38) and males (30.88±0.31). The age of the examined fishes ranged from 2to 7-year-old, meanwhile the dominant age group was 3-year-old. The size frequency distributions and the growth parameters were analyzed according to ELEFAN method, using FISAT II software. The Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were found as asymptotic length, L∞ = 58.28 cm, asymptotic weight, W∞ = 2019.76 g, growth coefficient, K = 0.30...\n\nThe adaptability status and reproductive success of the introduced fish Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio L., 1758) in Fincha reservoir, Ethiopia were studied on monthly basis from July 2006 to August 2007. Gill nets of different mesh size (60 mm, 80 mm, 100 mm, 120 mm and 140 mm, stretched mesh size) and beich sein (50 m long) were used to harvest the fish (a total of 645 fishes). Total length (L) and body weight (W) of both species were measured to the nearest 0.1 cm and 1g respectively. The results of the study showed that both fish species are adapted and have established successful breeding population in the reservoir. The size at first sexual maturity (L50) for Oreochromis niloticus in Fincha reservoir was 21.8 cm for female and 24.5 cm for the male while L50 was 37.5cm and 24.5cm for female and male Cyprinus carpio respectively. It was found that Oreochromis niloticus breeds throughout the year showing a peak breeding season in January and July in Fincha reservoir while Cyprinus carpio showed a peak breeding season between March and June. The length-weight relationships, total length (L) in cm; total weight (W) in g were calculated for O. niloticus (W=0.8×10-2L3.20; n=87; r2= 0.96) and C. carpio (W=1.4×10-2L2.97; n=558; r2=0.99) and showed a curvilinear relationship signifying the fish grow nearly isometrically. A significant seasonal variation (ANOVA, P < 0.05) was observed in the condition (K) of the fish coupled with the peak breeding season in Fincha reservoir. The relatively low values in the condition of the fish during January, March and July seems to coincide with the peak breeding season of the fish, which probably drains high energy for spawning. However, no significant difference was observed between sexes (ANOVA, P>0.05). Apparently, length frequency distribution of both species indicated that the fish population is normal fish population with no apparent problems of over exploitation."
