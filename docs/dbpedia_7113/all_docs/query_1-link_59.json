Cooperative adaptive management of the Nile can help alleviate some of these stressors and tensions. Here we present a planning framework for adaptive management of the Nile infrastructure system, combining climate projections; hydrological, river system and economy-wide simulators; and artificial intelligence multi-objective design and machine learning algorithms. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by designing a cooperative adaptive management policy for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam that balances the transboundary economic and biophysical interests of Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt. This shows that if the three countries compromise cooperatively and adaptively in managing the dam, the national-level economic and resilience benefits are substantial, especially under climate projections with the most extreme streamflow changes. The Nile River system is faced with challenges including increasing water demands, political tensions, and future climate and socio-economic uncertainties. Cooperative adaptive management can help increase synergies, balance trade-offs and bring various benefits to riparian countries.",

        "text": "Human activities have increased the atmospheric concentration of GHGs, leading to warming of the Earth’s land, atmosphere and ocean1,2,3,4. Global initiatives such as the Paris Agreement5 and the Sustainable Development Goals6 aim to reduce the impacts of climate change by limiting the rise in global temperature and stepping up adaptation efforts. However, the global mean temperature continued to rise over the past two decades, from 0.89 °C in 2001–2010 to 1.09 °C in 2011–2020 above pre-industrial conditions1. The Nile Basin (Fig. 1) faces the threat of climate change alongside water scarcity, rapidly rising pressures on water resources due to population and economic growth, and a politically complex transboundary water management system. The Nile Basin is located in northeastern Africa, occupies around 10% of the continent’s area and extends over 11 countries. Supplementary Section 1 provides further information on the Nile geography.\n\nSince the beginning of the twentieth century, several large water infrastructure projects have been constructed on the Nile River to reduce the spatial and temporal variabilities of the river flow and to facilitate water supply, flood control and hydropower generation. Most of these infrastructures are in Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia. Currently, most of the consumptive usage of the Nile streamflow, measured at Aswan, is located in Sudan and Egypt7,8. Over the past two decades, Ethiopia has been increasing its use of the Nile, primarily for hydropower generation. The construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the Nile near the Ethiopian–Sudanese border (Fig. 1) flared up political tensions between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt on Nile water use9,10,11,12. The construction of the GERD started in 2011, and when completed, the dam will have a total storage capacity of 74 billion cubic meters (bcm) and an installed power capacity of 5,150 MW. The total storage capacity of the GERD is equivalent to 1.5 times the historical mean annual river flow at the dam location. The dam is expected to result in a range of opportunities and risks to Sudan and Egypt. Subject to coordination and data sharing, hydropower generation, irrigation water supply reliability and flood control in Sudan could improve because of the dam13,14,15,16. Still, the dam will probably produce adverse environmental impacts and losses to recession agriculture in Sudan17. For Egypt, the GERD is expected to reduce hydropower generation and impose irrigation water deficits if there is no coordination on managing multi-year droughts7,12.\n\nDespite over a decade of negotiations, there is still disagreement and political tension between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt on the GERD’s initial filling and long-term operation. A milestone in the tripartite GERD negotiations was a series of meetings held from November 2019 to February 2020, with the United States administration and the World Bank as observers18. These meetings produced a proposal for the dam’s initial filling and long-term operation (hereon referred to as the Washington draft proposal)19, but the proposal was unacceptable to Ethiopia, which opined that the proposal would limit power generation from the dam and restrain future development20.\n\nAlongside this changing political landscape, the quantity and intensity of rainfall and streamflow in the Nile Basin have changed over the past two decades and are expected to continue to change due to climate change. However, the direction and magnitude of future changes to the Nile climate are uncertain, stemming from different scenarios, modelling and downscaling choices21,22. In the Nile context, these inconsistencies in climate projections diminish the value of using one projection or a multi-model ensemble mean in climate adaptation planning22,23.\n\nThe large uncertainties associated with the water resource implications of changes in socio-economic and climate systems motivate adaptive infrastructure development plans24,25,26,27,28,29. Several approaches have been proposed to enable planning under deep uncertainty26,30; these allow designing robust and flexible plans that maximize resilience and minimize investment costs on the basis of, for example, adaptation tipping points31, dynamic adaptive planning32 and dynamic adaptive policy pathways24,33. Several recent studies have applied such adaptive methods to planning water resource systems in various contexts25,34,35,36,37,38. For instance, a reservoir adaptive planning framework has been developed to explicitly consider learning about climate uncertainty over time35, and other studies have optimized the indicators, actions and/or thresholds in the design process of adaptive plans for water resource systems33,36,39,40. However, none of the previous studies considered engineering performance alongside economy-wide performance in the design process of climate adaptation plans for large water infrastructure systems, even though the ultimate goal of building and operating infrastructure is typically to stimulate economic development and generate economy-wide gains.\n\nHere we introduce a planning framework for adaptive management of river infrastructure systems to consider both the socio-economic and hydrological uncertainties of climate change and policy. The framework uses climate and socio-economic data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6)41 to drive integrated hydrological, economy-wide and river system simulators of the Nile Basin. Our adaptive planning framework uses artificial-intelligence-based algorithms to design efficient adaptive plans for climate change on the basis of thousands of iterations between the algorithms and the integrated simulators. We use the framework to design a cooperative adaptive management policy for the GERD (for 2020–2045) that considers economic and river system interests of Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt. The results demonstrate that if the GERD is adaptively managed, the economic and resilience benefits to individual countries (especially under extreme climate projections) are substantially larger than with less adaptive responses such as the Washington draft proposal.\n\nHere we introduce an adaptive planning framework for the Nile Basin that combines climate change projections; integrated hydrological, economy-wide and river system simulators; and multi-objective evolutionary and machine learning algorithms. Below is a description of the components and data of the framework.\n\nClimate projections\n\nTwenty climate projections were selected from CMIP6 Tier 1 GCMs on the basis of uniform sampling to cover the full range of available SSPs, radiative forcing and the joint distribution of EOC change in precipitation and temperature over the Nile Basin. Processing, downscaling and bias correction of the GCM simulations were driven by the requirement for transient (2017–2100) three-hourly forcing data across seven climate variables that govern the surface mass and energy balances in the hydrological model (described in the next section). The seven variables are precipitation, temperature, incoming shortwave radiation, incoming longwave radiation, humidity, wind speed and surface pressure. Given the large spatial domain, the low availability of subdaily model output for all of the relevant variables in CMIP6 and challenges of multivariate bias correction51, we derived bias-corrected transient projections by (1) resampling the 0.25° historical baseline climate dataset to match the (detrended) relative variability of the selected GCM projections and then (2) applying perturbation factors to reintroduce the change signal extracted from the GCMs following a quantile delta mapping approach52.\n\nIn more detail, we first detrended the basin-average monthly future precipitation series for 2017–2100 in each GCM run on a month-wise basis using smoothed 37-year moving averages. Second, we ranked the detrended future series month-wise and matched the ranks to their equivalents in the historical baseline precipitation dataset of 1981–2016, allowing us to construct synthetic climate series for 2017–2100 at the three-hour temporal resolution of the historical climate datasets by inserting the relevant month of data from the historical dataset at the right place in the future series. The synthesized series thus have the same overall sequencing of relative intra-annual (seasonal), interannual and multi-annual variability as the original GCM projections in rank terms, while preserving the statistical properties (including spatial, temporal and intervariable consistency53,54) and resolution of the historical baseline dataset (that is, without GCM bias). The historical baseline climate datasets used are the Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP)55 for precipitation and the Princeton Global Forcing (PGF)56 for the other climate variables. The 0.1° MSWEP data were regridded to the 0.25° PGF grid before the climate series was synthesized.\n\nFor each of the 20 climate projections, we then reintroduced the climate change signal to the synthesized 2017–2100 climate series, producing bias-corrected and perturbed projections. The transient climate change signal was reintroduced on a month-wise basis using a 37-year moving window of quantile-based perturbations52. Smoothing was applied to the perturbation factors via a moving average to avoid any jumps between successive windows. We note that this method does not adjust the frequency of wet periods/days within a month, and it is not designed to focus on projected changes in precipitation extremes, given the study’s focus on water resources management on a monthly scale rather than flood frequency.\n\nSeveral previous studies have highlighted how the wetting trend in climate projections for eastern Africa stands in contrast to the observed decline in precipitation from the 1980s to the late 2000s42. This contradiction, known as the Eastern African Paradox, represents a challenge for climate adaptation planning42,43. While the literature shows a growing understanding of how this issue is linked with regional circulation dynamics and their representation in models57,58, there is not yet a consensus on how the projections might be constrained. Yet, if the projections are taken at face value, there is a risk that adaptation measures are designed for a highly uncertain wetter climate that might not materialize, with potentially severe socio-economic consequences.\n\nTo address this issue, we synthesized nine additional scenarios based on 9 of the 20 initial projections by removing the overall wetting tendency in the CMIP6 ensemble for the East Africa region. The magnitude of the tendency was estimated by quantifying the mean increase in EOC mean precipitation for a unit increase in mean temperature according to the full GCM ensemble, given their strong relationship in this context. The relationship was then used to adjust individual GCM precipitation trends downwards, allowing us to select the nine projections representing the most pessimistic scenarios in terms of precipitation decreases, which enables stress-testing adaptation policies across a wide range of plausible futures (Fig. 3a). Supplementary Table 1 lists the 29 projections and their main features. Daily PET was calculated for the 29 projections using the FAO56 Penman–Monteith method59.\n\nHydrological simulator\n\nTo generate time series of historical and projected naturalized streamflow for the Nile Basin, we used and calibrated the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC version 5) land surface model60 and the Routing Application for Parallel Computation of Discharge (RAPID)61. The VIC and RAPID models were originally developed in a previous study to reconstruct vector-based global naturalized streamflow62. The hydrological model has a spatial resolution of 0.25° and a three-hourly temporal resolution. The historical streamflow time series was driven by MSWEP55 and temperature, incoming shortwave radiation, incoming longwave radiation, humidity, wind speed and surface pressure data from the PGF56. The 29 projected streamflow time series were driven by similar climate variables obtained from the climate projections described in the previous section. The VIC and RAPID models were calibrated against a historical naturalized streamflow dataset of the Nile previously developed for the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office63. The hydrological model was calibrated using baseflow parameters, depth of soil layers, variable infiltration curve and maximum soil moisture. Supplementary Table 5 shows the ranges of the values of the calibration parameters for all grid cells in the hydrological model. The RAPID model routes streamflow using the Muskingum method64 and requires a river network to determine Muskingum parameters (that is, the gradient coefficient and the weighting factor). The river network was obtained from the Hydrological data and maps on the basis of SHuttle Elevation Derivatives at multiple Scales (HydroSHEDS)65. The hydrological model was calibrated over the period 1982–1992 and validated over 1993–2002 at four locations where naturalized flow data are available. Supplementary Table 6 shows the performance of the hydrological model in the calibration and validation periods, and Supplementary Table 7 summarizes the model performance ranking criteria adopted. As elaborated in the next section, the combined hydrological and river system simulator was calibrated at additional locations.\n\nRiver system simulator\n\nTo simulate the performance of the Nile River system infrastructure under climate change and various adaptive management options, we developed a monthly river system model for the basin using Python Water Resources (Pywr)66. A river system model is a network representation of the supplies, demands and infrastructures of water resources in a river system67. Pywr is an open-source Python library that simulates resource networks. It enables representing water resources system infrastructure (for example, dams, lakes, aquifer-based water supply and water abstraction locations) in a network structure driven by water supplies (for example, hydrological inflows) and demands (for example, irrigation, municipal and industrial water demands and hydropower) and system operating rules. Pywr uses a linear programming approach to simulate water allocations at each time step (monthly in this study) subject to constraints imposed by system operation rules. Supplementary Fig. 3 shows a schematic of the Nile River system model and its elements, and Supplementary Table 8 shows the main features of the dams included in the model. The model uses the naturalized streamflow time series of the Nile generated using the hydrological model described in the previous section. Data for dams, lakes, reservoirs, and irrigation and municipal water demands were collected from different sources, including the Nile Basin Initiative and previous studies14,15,68,69,70,71.\n\nIn simulating future scenarios, the water demands of irrigation schemes and the net evaporation rates of lakes, reservoirs and swamps were modified (increased or decreased) on the basis of the annual change ratio of PET at their locations relative to the historical annual mean. Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4 show the projected annual change in PET relative to the historical mean at some selected dams and irrigation schemes in the Nile River system. Future municipal water demands were calculated by applying the population growth rates projected under different climate change scenarios (that is, SSPs). The population growth projections under different SSPs were obtained from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) database44,45. Supplementary Section 3 describes the initial water demand assumptions for Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt.\n\nThe Nile River system simulator was calibrated and validated at ten locations over 1995–2010 using historical river flow observations and reservoir and lake water levels. This calibration period was chosen on the basis of the availability of common and continuous historical observed data for the ten selected locations. Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 9 show the performance of the Nile River system model over the calibration and validation periods, Supplementary Table 10 reports the calibration parameters and their values, and Supplementary Table 7 reports the performance ranking criteria. Total non-hydro (for example, thermal) generation for each country was represented as a super generator used to fill the gap between hydropower generation and national electricity demand subject to generation capacity. The non-hydro generation capacity and national electricity demands are updated annually on the basis of an iterative process between the river system and the economy-wide simulators, as described in a later section.\n\nEconomy-wide simulator\n\nThe standard open-source CGE model of the International Food Policy Research Institute72 was modified and used to develop economy-wide models for Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt. The production and consumption specifications in the CGE models are shown in Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6. The CGE models were set up to run dynamically over multi-year periods (that is, dynamic-recursive) following endogenous investment behaviour, exogenous total and sectoral factor productivities, labour growth, and energy use efficiency trends.\n\nThe CGE models of Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt include five agent types: households, the government, enterprises, industries (or economic activities) and the rest of the world. Households are disaggregated into rural and urban groups. Ethiopia’s, Sudan’s and Egypt’s CGE models include 12, 15 and 14 economic activities, respectively. Economic activities use the following factors of production: labour, general capital, land, hydropower capital, non-hydro capital, renewables capital, water supply capital, oil capital and gas capital. Labour and general capital are assumed mobile between sectors, whereas the other factors are sector-specific. All capital types, except water supply and hydropower capitals, grow or shrink over time on the basis of investment behaviour according to relative rates of return. Water supply and hydropower capitals were not included in the year-to-year investment behaviour, as expansion in these infrastructures typically requires abrupt investment in the Nile context.\n\nWe assume that commodity prices on the international market are exogenous, following the small open-economy assumption73. The government is assumed to spend a fixed share of total absorption. Saving propensities are fixed, and the exchange rate is variable. The CGE models were calibrated to social accounting matrices for 2011 obtained from the International Food Policy Research Institute74,75,76. We then used the GTAP-Power 10 database for the year 201477 to disaggregate the electricity sectors of the social accounting matrices. Five dynamic baselines were calibrated for the CGE models of Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt, with each baseline corresponding to an SSP. The baseline total factor productivity values were set up such that the baseline models follow projected economic growth (obtained from the IIASA database) for each SSP scenario46. After that, the total factor productivity values were fixed and applied exogenously. Labour growth (16–64 age group)45, urbanization78 and population growth45 projections for each of the three countries were obtained from the IIASA database and applied exogenously to the CGE models. Also, projections for national-level sectoral productivity under each SSP were obtained from the Centre d’Études Prospectives et d’Informations Internationales79 and applied exogenously to the CGE models. Sectoral future energy use efficiency values were calibrated such that the baseline simulated country-level carbon dioxide emissions in the baselines follow the growth pattern of the regional emission values of the Middle East and North Africa projected by IIASA for each SSP80. Carbon dioxide emissions were calculated in the CGE models by applying emission factors (tons of carbon per terajoule) to the use of petroleum, gas and coal commodities in the economies.\n\nBecause the CGE models were calibrated on the basis of 2011 social accounting matrices, they were first run dynamically over 2011–2019 to bring the economies to the first year of the GERD’s initial filling before scenarios for 2020–2045 were assessed. The temporal evolution of the values of some of the key driving parameters and baseline outputs of the CGE models are shown in Supplementary Fig. 7.\n\nEconomy and river system coupling\n\nThe river system infrastructure and economy-wide simulators were connected using a generic co-evolutionary framework developed in a previous study7. The framework enables linking river system simulation models (with daily or monthly time steps) with dynamic-recursive annual CGE models. At each annual time step, the coupling framework performs an iterative bidirectional communication between the river system and the CGE simulators to ensure coherence in the annual national-scale irrigation water supply and demand, municipal water supply and demand, hydropower generation, non-hydro generation and capacity, and electricity demand. In each iteration over an annual time step, the river system model quantifies and spatially aggregates national-scale irrigation and municipal water supplies and hydro and non-hydro generation on the basis of the river system’s spatial and temporal constraints, infrastructure, and external drivers. This information is then passed to the CGE models as an external shock on the basis of which changes to the economy’s municipal and irrigation water demands, electricity demand, and non-hydro capacity are determined and passed back to the river system model for the next iteration. Iterations over each annual time step can be terminated by a maximum number of iterations and/or a convergence error. In this work, we specified a maximum of three iterations between the river system and the economy-wide simulators for each annual time step and a convergence error of US$5 million measured using the Ethiopian real GDP. The coupling framework is implemented using the open-source Python Network Simulation framework81. The reader is referred to Basheer et al.7 for further details about the co-evolutionary coupling framework used in this study.\n\nMulti-method artificial-intelligence-based design and learning\n\nIn the Nile adaptive planning framework, an artificial-intelligence-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) provides the ability to identify efficient adaptive management policies for river system infrastructure. Supplementary Fig. 8 shows the interaction between the integrated economy-wide and river system simulators and the MOEA. The MOEA generates a design (that is, a set of decision variable values) for the adaptive management policy (the yellow box in Supplementary Fig. 8), which is then passed to the integrated economy-wide and river system simulators. The integrated model performs a dynamic multi-year multi-scenario simulation considering socio-economic and hydrological uncertainties related to climate change, resulting in aggregated performance metrics (over time and projections) that are indicated as objectives. The adaptive management design and objective values are then stored before proceeding to the next iteration, in which the MOEA suggests new adaptive management designs. The iteration between the MOEA and the integrated simulators continues until a stopping criterion is met. In this study, we use a maximum number of iterations as a criterion to terminate iteration between the integrated simulators and the MOEA. A maximum of 6,000 iterations (or function evaluations) was specified as a stopping criterion for the search process of adaptive GERD management. With every iteration, the MOEA learns from the previous generations of iterations and attempts to suggest an adaptive infrastructure management design that improves performance as measured by the objectives. Once the stopping criterion is met, a non-dominated sorting process is performed to filter efficient adaptive management policies. We used the open-source Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III)82 as an MOEA for adaptive design. Platypus, an open-source Python-based framework for evolutionary computing83, was used, which supports NSGA-III.\n\nThe multi-objective search was performed for the adaptive management formulation for the GERD with five random seeds. Each seed represents a unique starting condition for the search algorithm. The use of multiple seeds allows checking that the search has converged to a global, approximately optimal set of solutions. A total of 30,000 iterations were therefore performed during the search process (that is, five seeds multiplied by 6,000 iterations). Optimization convergence was tested by calculating the evolution of the hypervolume84 for each random seed (Supplementary Fig. 9).\n\nWe used machine learning as a post-processing step for understanding the relative influence of adaptive policy variables on economy-wide and river system performance, on the basis of a similar approach to a previous study on economy systems85. The values of the adaptive policy variables and the objectives generated during the search iterations between the MOEA and the integrated simulators are used to train a machine learning model for each objective. Accordingly, the features of each machine learning model are the variables of the adaptive policy, and the target is each of the objectives. The Random Forest Regression Machine Learning Algorithm86 was used. After the machine learning models were trained, feature importance was calculated, which, for each model, represents the relative influence of features on an objective. The Random Forest Regression Algorithm was used through the open-source Scikit-learn Python library87.\n\nFor the GERD application, 80% of the data on the objectives and decision variables were used to train 100 tree predictors for each machine learning model, and 20% of the data were used to test performance. Maximum tree depth values from 1 to 30 were tested for each machine learning model. The lowest tree depth that provided a good prediction ability while avoiding overfitting or underfitting the data was selected for each machine learning model. Supplementary Fig. 10 shows the performance of the machine learning models with the training and testing data with different maximum tree depths and the chosen maximum tree depth values.\n\nImplementation of the GERD adaptive management formulation\n\nThe GERD adaptive management formulation optimized in this study includes nine objectives and seven decision variables. The objectives maximize the following aggregate metrics over 2020–2045:\n\n1.\n\nThe mean (over projections) accumulated (discounted over time) Ethiopian real GDP\n\n2.\n\nThe mean (over projections) accumulated (discounted over time) Sudanese real GDP\n\n3.\n\nThe mean (over projections) accumulated (discounted over time) Egyptian real GDP\n\n4.\n\nThe mean (over projections) 90% firm (over time) power generation of the GERD\n\n5.\n\nThe mean (over projections and time) annual energy generation of the GERD\n\n6.\n\nThe mean (over projections and time) annual energy from hydropower in Sudan\n\n7.\n\nThe mean (over projections and time) annual energy from hydropower in Egypt\n\n8.\n\nThe mean (over projections and time) annual irrigation water supply in Sudan\n\n9.\n\nThe mean (over projections and time) annual irrigation water supply in Egypt\n\nThe seven decision variables are (see Extended Data Fig. 5 for the details):\n\n1.\n\nInterim additional filling water release\n\n2.\n\nPower reduction storage\n\n3.\n\nRegular power target\n\n4.\n\nInterim reduced power target\n\n5.\n\nDrought trigger\n\n6.\n\nDrought outflow storage threshold\n\n7.\n\nInterim minimum drought mitigation water release\n\nThe upper and lower bounds of the seven decision variables are reported in Supplementary Table 3. Long-term adaptation measures are applied to the regular power target, the interim reduced power target, the drought trigger and the interim minimum drought mitigation water release. The adaptation measures involve increasing or decreasing these four GERD operation variables dynamically on a five-year interval on the basis of how the mean annual inflow to the GERD over the past five years changed in relation to the historical mean annual inflow over 1980–2019.\n\nReporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article."
