        "text": "(2 of 3)\n\nBRUCE L. HELLER Baltimore\n\nBlowing the Horn\n\nSir: Let us quickly assure Chairman Kappel [May 29] that we do not want to change our phone company. A.T. & T. is capitalism's proudest product: remarkable service, polite personnel, steady profit for investors, and a credit to our nation throughout the world. If the U.S. Post Office and all the American railroads were promptly turned over to the capable hands of A.T. & T., we could shortly expect two mail deliveries a day, clean post offices, well-mannered clerks, trains on time. And, whoopee, none of those dismal deficits!\n\nARTHUR HORNBLOW JR. New York City\n\nSir: Anyone who has dealings with the Bell System finds that he can only talk with computers, which have been programmed with few responses. It does no good to talk with supervisory personnel, as they have been programmed with the same responses. If there is a more impersonal and less cooperative corporation, then show it to me!\n\nJIM PILES Hillcrest Heights, Md.\n\nSir: If the long-nosed engineers at A.T. & T. would devise a method to quickly trace anonymous telephone calls of an obscene or annoying nature, the need for unlisted numbers and requests for number changes would decrease materially.\n\nBERTRAM J. ZOSLAW Abington, Pa.\n\nEthnics All Around\n\nSir: Your proud reputation for accuracy is going to pot in a hurry unless you hire some researchers more wide-awake. You state that Candidate William Haddad [May 22] was a World War II Merchant Marine officer. You also state that he is 35. That means that when the war ended, he was only 16. I think your readers are entitled to an explanation.\n\nREID JORGENSEN St. Thomas, V.I.\n\n> At the age of 14, Haddad enlisted in the Army Air Forces, had advanced to cadet squadron commander before discovery and discharge. He tried unsuccessfully to enlist in the Army and Marine Corps before signing up in the Merchant Marine, which commissioned him an ensign at 16.ED.\n\nSir: As a Jew, I was shocked to read of the scandalous stories being spread by Congressman Farbstein about Democratic Candidate William Haddad. Farbstein obviously thinks that any man who is born in an anti-Semitic country is an anti-Semite. If this were true, what stories should we start telling about Moses?\n\nI. STEVEN SIMON Lawrence, N.Y.\n\nRally Round\n\nSir: If Quebec \"gives\" Canada that new heraldic nonentity that is being waved aroundmostly by the Prime Minister [May 29], at least the problem (if there is one) of a new national anthem will be solved automatically: why, the Maple Leaf Rag, naturally! They will make the perfect couple.\n\nROY S. CUYLER Ottawa\n\nNasser's Dam\n\nSir: I would like to bring up to date your Nile map [May 22]. Khashm el Girba dam is not any more \"abuilding\" but is \"existing.\" On April 13, the bottom gates were closed and storage was started. On May 20, water impounded in the reservoir went for the first time into the main irrigation canal. The new lake will be full next August.\n\nSAVERIO C. FABOZZI Project Manager of the Main Contractor Giuseppe Torno & Co., Sudan Branch Khartoum, Egypt"
