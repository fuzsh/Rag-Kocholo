The dam is equipped with canal headworks, located on its left bank, which divert water into a canal. When water levels in the reservoir are low, three pumps move water into the canal.

The main portion of the dam is an earthen embankment; the spillway and irrigation headworks sections are concrete gravity. The dam has a small hydroelectric power station, which was upgraded during the period 2002-04 to its current installed capacity of 10 megawatts (13,000 hp).
