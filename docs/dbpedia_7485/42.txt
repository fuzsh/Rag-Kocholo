The Cay Building, located on Ellis Square in downtown Savannah, is a six-story, 72,000 sf Class A office building and the new home to the U.S. Attorneys Office. The ground floor and second floor (27,000 sf) are speculative office and retail spaces for lease. This provides a high quality option for custom office spaces in a true Class A building in the heart of Downtown Savannah.
