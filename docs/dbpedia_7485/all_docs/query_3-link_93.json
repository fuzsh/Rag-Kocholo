        "text": "I stood shoulder-deep in the cool turquoise water and could see clear to my bare feet on the soft sand. The glowing descriptions I’d heard of Caribbean beaches weren’t poetic exaggerations after all; they were true.\n\nThis post contains affiliate links. For more information, click here.\n\nHalf Moon Cay is one of about 700 islands that comprise The Bahamas, the most popular destination country for premium cruisers, according to the cruising Web site CruiseCompete.\n\nHolland America acquired Little San Salvador Island in 1996 and renamed it Half Moon Cay. Its spectacular beach has the shape of an acute crescent. A cay is a small tropical island atop a coral reef. But the name really comes from the Halve Maen, a flyboat captained by Henry Hudson, who explored northeastern North America for the Dutch East India Company during the 16th and 17th centuries.\n\nWhat to Do on Half Moon Cay\n\nMy family and I spent most of our time enjoying the beautiful beach, with its crystal-clear water and powder-soft sand. It made for a relaxing day after the stressful weeks before our Caribbean cruise on HAL’s Nieuw Statendam.\n\nWe’d reserved a two-storey beach villa. It featured a kitchen, a hot tub, and a 3/4 bathroom. It also came supplied with snorkel fins and floating mats for everyone in our group. Throughout the day, pleasant and polite staffers came to check on us. They frequently replenished our bottled water and soft drinks and brought snacks including fresh fruit, plantain chips, and shrimp cocktail.\n\nA call at Half Moon Cay also includes a complimentary barbecue buffet with Caribbean staples like jerk chicken, guava-braised short rib, Jamaican rice, and tropical fruits. There are also a Lobster Shack, an ice-cream parlor, and several bars, including “Captain Morgan on the Rocks”, which resembles a shipwrecked three-masted schooner and flies the Jolly Roger. The Bahamas were an enclave for pirates, as well as privateers, during the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThere are also souvenir shops, including a Bahamian straw market. Active excursions include snorkelling with stingrays and horseback riding through the surf. Some of my family spent time bird-watching.\n\nAs for me, I was happy alternating among reading on our villa’s porch, soaking in the hot tub, and wading in that crystal turquoise water."
