        "text": "I had to make a diorama for this movie/book in grade 8. At first my teacher said I got a 90 or 95. I asked why. She said the sand wasn't quite mixed in with my plasticine water, the water was only one colour, and some other BS. So I go and fix it. She bumps my score to 99. I ask why again. I want to put in the effort and fix it. She can't give me a reason, just says I should be happy with a 99. Asshole. Since when did the English teacher become such a meticulous art critic? What did her marking rubric look like? Not enough individual grains of sand mixed in with the water? The water shouldn't be one shade of blue? Fuck you man.\n\n“Has there ever been a movie that you have watched that was just incredibly inspiring? It had impeccable quality, untouchable acting, and smooth, flowing dialogue? It was just so good, it sent chills down your spine? Well, the 1974 movie ‘The Cay’ made me feel the exact opposite way. With its poor acting, shaky camerawork, awful quality, and clipping soundtrack, this movie is easily the worst movie I have ever seen in all of my 29 years on this earth. This movie is so bad that they should change it from ‘Breaking Bad’ to ‘Breaking The Cay’.”\n\n- my grade 7 review of this movie\n\nAfter having my grade seven copy of the book for almost 7 years now, it was time to revisit this masterpiece. The Cay is a low-budget, poorly acted and unintentionally creepy due to the how close Timothy (old dude) gets to Phillip (blind little boy). This is honestly the oddest thing I've seen published by a mega corporation and it bewilders me to this day"
