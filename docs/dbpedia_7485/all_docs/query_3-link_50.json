        "text": "The Cay House located in tranquil Grants, Mangrove Cay, Andros, The Bahamas, is a charming small hotel. The air conditioned rooms are well appointed, each with its own ensuite bathroom, fine furnishing, and hardwood floors. Prefer to indulge in the outdoor natural air? Choose from two outdoor terraces where you can enjoy morning coffee, afternoon tea, or simply soak up the sun and take in the fresh island breeze. Unwind with a drink under the stars, or at one of the local spots. For beach lovers, the beach is just a short walk.\n\nMangrove Cay, surrounded by beautiful clear blue waters, known for its spectacular coral reefs, sponging, protected marine park, blue holes, and bonefishing, is nestled towards the south of Andros between the northern and southern parts of the island."
