        "meta_description": "26 reviews and 64 photos of HOTEL ON THE CAY \"Before you come here, do ask yourself how you want to spend your vacation in the beautiful island of St. Croix. If you want to be pampered in luxury, play golf, chill at the spa, or hang out in the hotel room all day and order room service, go somewhere else. But if you are looking for the calm blue water and some awesome snorkeling, do, do come here. They are only steps away from your room!!!\n\nThere are two main towns on St. Croix: Fredericksted and Christiansted. Fredericksted is where all the cruise ships dock. All the way on the opposite end of the island is Christiansted. I decided to come here to avoid the cruise ship tourist mob that tend to ruin the small island ambiance and jack prices up. Christiansted is a nice little town, if you can even call it that. It has 3 streets total, a couple of souvenir shops, some dive shops, some restaurants and bars. Very quiet and most places are closed by sundown. Quick tip: make sure to have all your essentials in your carry-on. Unfortunately the airline lost my luggage and apparently there are only 1-2 stores tops on this side of the island that carry a toothbrush.\n\nHotel on the Cay, as the name suggests, is in its own island. There's a reliable ferry service free of charge taking you to and from Christiansted, and it only takes about 2 minutes. The hotel has a pool and its own private beach. Free beach chairs and fresh beach towels you can get from the lobby all day long. The hotel bar is by the beach and they serve delicious food and all sorts of tropical drinks. Also on the beach was a small hut where you can rent all sorts of gears, kayak, sailboats, jetskis, etc. \n\nThis lodging arrangement I think is the best for its convenience. By the time you walk out of your room, you're already at the beach, and now if you swim about 50 yards out to the right towards the open ocean, Voila!!! You will find yourself surrounded in the abundance of marine life. I was out there for hours everyday and saw a lot of fish, corals, cucumbers, urchins, an octopus, a sting ray, and check this,... a sea turtle!!! Too bad I was only there for 3 days otherwise I'm sure a shark would've made it on the list as well. I was there during Thanksgiving, paid about $100 per night, got 2 double beds in spacious room with ocean view. The accommodation was basic, there's AC (very important), fridge, microwave, a little kitchenette. The room was clean but the decor was so 70's and showed signs of wear and tear. The TV only had 6 channels max depending where the antenna is pointing, but I was just there to put my head on the pillow after a long exhausting day under the sun. Under a \"better\" management, they could easily renovate, turn this place into a 5-star mega resort and charge three times as much. I love this place just the way it is. Can't wait to go back there for my next vacation.\"",
