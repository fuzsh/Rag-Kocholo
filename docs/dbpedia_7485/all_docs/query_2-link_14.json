It was released on October 21, 1974.\n\nA young boy named Phillip is aboard the S.S. Hato when it is torpedoed during World War II. It soon sinks and Phillip awakens on a raft with Timothy, an older black man, and Stew Cat, a stray cat belonging to a crew member on the Hato. Phillip soon becomes blind from a head injury he suffered during the torpedoing. After days at sea, they notice a cay in the distance. They all reach the island, but Timothy, worried about what would happen to Phillip if he should die, prepares Phillip to fish and find food and be more self-reliant. When a hurricane hits the cay, Timothy ties their meager supplies to a tree and shields Phillip from the strong winds and rain that flay his whole body. When Phillip regains consciousness after the storm he finds Timothy very weak. Timothy manages to get out his last words: \"Phill-eep... you.. all right... be true? Terrible tempis'....\"\n\nAfter Timothy's death, Phillip remains confident until a plane flies over the island without stopping for him. Phillip, who is still blind, is discouraged. But when he hears another plane, he manages to build up and ignite the signal fire that Timothy had built, throwing green branches on it to make more smoke. It becomes visible to the plane, and a boat arrives to rescue Phillip and Stew Cat. Phillip is reunited with his mother and father, and receives surgery to restore his vision. He reminisces and thinks about revisiting the cay one day, knowing he will recognize it not by sight but by sound.\n\nUniversal TV, NBC and Russell Thacher-Walter Seltzer Productions produced and distributed this film.\n\nThe Cay was filmed on location in Belize.\n\nJames Earl Jones as Timothy\n\nAlfred Lutter as Phillip\n\nGretchen Corbett as Grace – Phillip's Mother\n\nIn the film (unlike the book), Phillip's father did not appear.\n\nYear Award Show Category Result Recipient(s) 1975 Humanitas Prize 60 Minutes Nominated Russell Thacher\n\nList of American films of 1974\n\nTimothy of the Cay"
