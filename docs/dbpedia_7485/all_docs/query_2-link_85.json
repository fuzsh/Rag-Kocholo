        "text": "On one of my first strolls along the boardwalk in downtown Christiansted, I couldn’t help but notice a picturesque little island on the horizon amidst the many moored boats in Christiansted Harbor. It was none other than the charming Protestant Cay, with a stunning hotel aptly named “Hotel on the Cay” perched on its shores. My curiosity got the better of me, so I decided to go check out firsthand.\n\nAccessible by a quick two-minute ferry ride from the boardwalk near Fort Christiansvaern, I found Protestant Cay’s sandy beach to be a convenient choice for downtown hotel guests. And once you step foot on the island, you’ll find that it has so much more to offer.\n\nOne of the main attractions on the Cay is the aptly named “Hotel on the Cay.” This beautiful hotel provides guests with a relaxing tropical getaway experience, complete with a bar and restaurant located right on the beach. I highly recommend indulging in the delicious beach bar food menu and grabbing a refreshing drink while taking in the stunning scenery.\n\nBut there’s more to see and do beyond the hotel grounds. If you’re looking for a bit of adventure, try out some of the exciting water sports activities available on the Cay. From snorkeling to kayaking, there’s something for everyone to enjoy.\n\nSo, why is it called Protestant Cay?\n\nAccording to local legend, during the French colonial control of St. Croix, the Catholics outnumbered the Protestants on the island. As Danish settlers also inhabited Christiansted around that time, the Protestant religion likely originated from that fact. Sadly, many religions of the day didn’t coexist very well, even in death. Supposedly only Catholics were allowed to be buried on Saint Croix, while people of other faiths were buried on Protestant Cay.\n\nWhile local legends and stories may not always be supported by official historical records or documentation, they contribute to the local folklore and add depth to our understanding of a location’s past. I am always fascinated by places with interesting facets of history behind them. But regardless of the origin of its name, Protestant Cay remains a captivating destination for visitors.\n\nSaint Croix Ground Lizard\n\nAnother interesting tidbit about Protestant Cay is the presence of an endangered species of lizard called the St Croix Ground Lizard. The lizard once in abundance on St Croix, saw its population dwindle due to habitat loss when mongoose were introduced in the 1880s. Efforts to save the lizards took place with wildlife translocation projects to four offshore islands around St Croix. Protestant Cay being one of those islands.\n\nConclusion:\n\nProtestant Cay offers visitors a unique blend of history and natural beauty. Its proximity to Christiansted, the closest beach, nearby Buck Island, and the opportunity to see the rare St. Croix Ground Lizard make it an enticing destination for adventure and exploration. If you’re seeking a tropical paradise with a touch of history and natural wonders, be sure to add Protestant Cay to your travel itinerary.\n\nNOTE: The hotel has recently changed hands and is undergoing renovation and expansion per local news outlets. It is still open and worth the experience, but I can wait to see its full potential when finished."
