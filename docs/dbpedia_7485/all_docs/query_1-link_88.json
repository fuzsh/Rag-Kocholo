        "text": "Pros\n\nHotel is situated on its own island in Christiansted Harbor\n\nNice views of Christiansted and free ferry to waterfront shops, restaurants, and bars\n\nSmall, pretty beach on-site\n\nMost rooms have lovely views of the water, plus air-conditioning and flat-screen TVs\n\nOn-site swimming pool and water sports gear available to rent\n\nRestaurant on-site offers breakfast and lunch\n\nFree Wi-Fi throughout\n\nSee More Pros\n\nCons\n\nRooms have outdated decor and design\n\nUpkeep issues throughout the resort\n\nHidden check-in and service fees\n\nFood at the restaurant is subpar\n\nSee More Cons\n\nBottom Line\n\nAt first glance, the two-and-a-half-pearl Hotel on the Cay sounds idyllic -- it's on its own private island just minutes from downtown Christiansted. The concept is charming, but this is a simple, outdated hotel. The 53 rooms are lifted straight out of the '90s, though they are large and most have lovely views of the harbor. There is a wide and sandy beach on the island, but the on-site pool and water features throughout are unattractive. This is one of the few hotels that does not require a car to access Christiansted tourist sites and restaurants, unlike the Tamarind Reef Resort, Spa & Marina. It’s also one of the cheaper places to stay in St. Croix, making it a decent option for tourists on a budget.\n\nSee More Bottom Line\n\nAmenities\n\nInternet\n\nPool\n\nOyster Hotel Review\n\nHotel on the Cay\n\nScene\n\nRelaxed private island, removed from the bustle of downtown Christiansted\n\nThe brief, pleasant experience of riding the ferry to get to Hotel on the Cay reflects the vibe of the hotel -- it’s relaxed and slow-paced, and removed from the bustle of downtown Christiansted. However, most aspects of this hotel are extremely basic and a bit run down. Consisting of villa-style buildings arranged around lovely tropical courtyards, public areas here are set with mismatched, cheap furniture, and an unattractive, bright blue water feature runs throughout the property. The hotel attracts couples, budget travelers, and families looking for bargain rates in St. Croix along with features like the hotel's on-site beach, which is a lovely place to relax underneath towering palm trees. While the hotel does have a mediocre restaurant on-site that hosts all-you-can-eat beach barbecues (among other events), there isn't any lively nightlife here -- that's at the bars and restaurants located just across the water from the Cay.\n\nSee More Scene\n\nLocation\n\nConvenient to shops and restaurants at downtown Christiansted waterfront\n\nHotel on the Cay has a unique location on its own little island, Protestant Cay, in Christiansted Harbor, directly facing the downtown Christiansted waterfront. Its beach and restaurant offer great panoramic views of the town. Ferry service to and from the hotel runs frequently until late, and the captain can be called for service after hours. The hotel's proximity to the shops and restaurants in downtown Christiansted is convenient, and boat trips to Buck Island, or sunset sails, depart from the town's marina. Trips to Point Udall -- the easternmost point in the U.S. -- bioluminescent kayak excursions, and most other tours are convenient to organize from the marina as well. To get to Rainbow Beach or other beaches in Frederiksted requires a 35-minute car trip. From the airport it’s a 20-minute taxi ride to the hotel. A bit of trivia: Protestant Cay is home to the St. Croix Ground Lizard, and the island is one of two designated protected areas for the species, a delightful detail for nature lovers.\n\nSee More Location\n\nRooms\n\nSimple, dated rooms, many with lovely water views\n\nTo be frank, the 53 rooms here are clean and spacious, but they are outdated. Tan-tile floors, cream walls, token soft-hued and sea-inspired wall art, and flowery curtains that match late-'90s bedspreads all look similar to decor in budget motels found throughout the U.S. There are kitchenettes in every room, including coffeemakers, toasters, and mini-fridges, plus large flat-screen TVs. All rooms also have balconies and most feature lovely views of Christiansted Harbor (particularly the third-floor rooms), but mid-tone wood headboards, whitewashed dressers and nightstands, and green wicker chairs inside of guest rooms look mismatched. Rooms are air-conditioned and have ceiling fans, and in-room Wi-Fi is free. The bathrooms are small but clean, and they offer plenty of counter space as well as large showers. It’s worth noting that there is no elevator in this hotel, so anyone with mobility issues might want to request a ground-level room. Suites are available for small groups and families, and there is a private villa on the island for rent as well.\n\nSee More Rooms\n\nFeatures\n\nSmall sandy beach, on-site pool and restaurant, free Wi-Fi\n\nThe hotel has a mid-size pool surrounded by a concrete deck that overlooks the property and harbor. There are a few lounge chairs in the area, but it's a pretty spare setting and there is no bar. The beach at the hotel is far nicer. It's dotted with palm trees and abuts clear, shallow waters (though it can be a little rocky). The on-site Harbormaster Restaurant is not quite up to par, with below-average food, though luckily a few nicer restaurants are just across the harbor by ferry. The restaurant does offer lovely views of the beach, but breakfast is not included with room rates. Snorkel gear and watersports equipment is available for rent and the hotel runs activities during the week, including tours and beachfront barbecues. There is also a computer in the lobby and free Wi-Fi in the rooms. Guests should be aware that there are hidden fees at check-in and service fees as well -- ask ahead.\n\nSee More Features\n\nOyster Hotel Review\n\nHotel on the Cay\n\nScene\n\nRelaxed private island, removed from the bustle of downtown Christiansted\n\nThe brief, pleasant experience of riding the ferry to get to Hotel on the Cay reflects the vibe of the hotel -- it’s relaxed and slow-paced, and removed from the bustle of downtown Christiansted.
