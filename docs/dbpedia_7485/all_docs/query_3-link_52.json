It encomposes about 75 hectares and is approximately one and a half hours by boat from Abraham's Bay, Mayaguana. The northwestern shoreline is comprised of sandy beach, dips in the centre of the cay forms lakes which shrink and grow in water level and salinity according to rainfall and the extreme southeast portion has inpenetrable vegetation.\n\nKey biodiversity\n\nIn 1997, Sprunt confirmed that Brown Boobies were nesting on Booby Cay. There are reports of a non-breeding resident flock of Greater Flamingos also residing on this cay. During December 1997, Bendon while on an Iguana research trip saw a flock of about 80 flamingos on a beach and in the shallow water at Booby Cay.\n\nNon-bird biodiversity: There is an endemic race of Rock Iguana on Booby Cay. In March 1997, Bendon visited this site and reported a healthy population of about 200 of these iguanas surviving in wild."
