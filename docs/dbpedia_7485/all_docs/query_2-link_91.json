        "text": "Experience “ALL INCLUSIVE” world-class accommodations and exceptional service on a private cay while fishing pristine Bahamas bonefish flats, diving the warm, azure Caribbean Sea, or relaxing on your villa’s private verandah.\n\nThe remote north and northwest Andros Island flats and the seldom-fished Joulter Cays can be explored with professional, knowledgeable and personable Kamalame Cay fishing guides. Staff naturalists will also take you snorkeling, scuba diving, hiking or sea-kayaking to reveal an unspoiled Andros Island.\n\nOn the Cay, a freshwater swimming pool, directly looking over a pristine, white sand beach is at your disposal. The palm covered Tiki Bar with fully stocked “top shelf” bar is located right at the pool. A tennis court rounds out the on-site activities.\n\nWe are able to offer you an all-inclusive, luxurious package at a price that reflects absolute quality. Discover the complete comfort of Kamalame.\n\nFish the abundant water close by the villa, venture to the fabled Joulter Cays just 30 minutes (by car) north of Andros, or even explore the untouched northwest side of Andros Island. And, who would want to miss the angler-tested, guide-approved North Bight?\n\nIf you choose, each day, you will be taken by an air-conditioned vehicle to meet your guide and boat (Maverick skiff with poling platform) at one of these fishing locations so that every angler will have an opportunity to access the different available areas.\n\nIf you favor a more relaxed pace, or if you just can’t stop fishing at the end of the day, wander onto Staniard Creek’s expansive flat out the backdoor of the Cay. Andros is well known for its large bonefisd, and our visits to the Joulters with Kamalame have confirmed this. Fish averaging a solid 4 pounds, and many in the 9-pound-plus class, are encountered while even larger bones work the flats’ edges. There have been some permit caught in the Joulters; however, these fish should be considered a bonus. It is a very impressive fishery.\n\nThe fully-equipped, center console 24 foot sportfishing boat sits at Kamalame’s dock ready to take you to the nearby reef and beyond to explore a vibrant fishery. Combine this exciting offshore action, Kamalame’s extraordinary facility, and the opportunity to be one of the lucky few to stalk Andros’ famed bonefish in rarely touched water, and you have all the makings for the trip-of-a-lifetime.\n\nAccommodations\n\nExtraordinary attention to every detail is a hallmark of the accommodations at Kamalame Cay. Several accommodation selections are available. From private villas, to duplex cottages with private entrances and common living area, to the quaint Angler’s Nest cottages, Kamalame has many lodging options to choose from.All of the villas at Kamalame Cay have private patio areas off the bedrooms, huge closets, fully stocked fridges with cold Kaliks, water and juices. All of the accommodations have ceiling fans and air conditioning and the use of a golf cart to explore the Cay at your leisure. Some of the villas or cottages offer an over-sized soaking tub for relaxing which will allow you to relax in your Kamalame Cay Turkish bath robe.\n\nMiles of beautiful exclusive beach directly in front of the villas beckon the beachcomber. It is not uncommon to walk the beach and find sand dollars and exotic shells.\n\nFor larger groups wanting more deluxe and private accommodations, the owners home at Kamalame Cove sits on 4 acres and offers 7,500 square feet of living space with 4 exquisite waterfront bedrooms, a secluded fresh water pool set among palm trees, private access and your own chef at your disposal. The private open air “Great Room” overlooks the sea on three sides.\n\nThe “Great House” on the Cay serves as a perfect gathering place for meals, cocktails and fish tales. It is decorated with art and antiques from the owner’s collection, filled with comfortable oversized furniture, and wrapped with an inviting verandah that offers a tranquilizing panoramic view of the sea.\n\nOutstanding candlelight dinners are served with elegance and feature delicious soups, salads, fresh fruits and vegetables, succulent lobster, fresh fish and other delightful main dishes. Meals are accompanied by fine wines and topped off with amazing desserts.
