        "text": "about the cay\n\nPhillip is excited when the Germans invade the small island of Curaçao. War has always been a game to him, and he’s eager to glimpse it firsthand–until the freighter he and his mother are traveling to the United States on is torpedoed.\n\nWhen Phillip comes to, he is on a small raft in the middle of the sea. Besides Stew Cat, his only companion is an old West Indian, Timothy. Phillip remembers his mother’s warning about black people: “They are different, and they live differently.”\n\nBut by the time the castaways arrive on a small island, Phillip’s head injury has made him blind and dependent on Timothy.\n\nbook theme\n\nThe Cay's theme primarily focuses on discovery. Discovery requires experience and reflection.\n\nEssential Questions:\n\n· What is available to learn?\n\n· How do I discover new knowledge?\n\n· What are the avenues for learning?\n\n· How do I find what I want to know?\n\n· How do I manage all that I am learning?\n\nUnit Focus Question:\n\n· What types of experiences and reflections are necessary for a person to discover, understand, or change?\n\nPRE-LESSON QUick Write\n\nDescribe an important experience in your life that caused you to discover, explore, and even change your attitude toward a person who was different from you.\n\nexample of a great focus question answer from the cay\n\nFOCUS QUESTION #1\n\nCLASS A\n\nFor my character, I chose Timothy. He is a wise, experienced old man. He likes to think ahead and have a plan to keep himself and Philip alive. He puts Philip's needs before himself. For instance, on p. 35, he says, \"D'large kag 'ave a way o' losin' its veree size.\" He is explaining to Philip that water is useful. That's why I think that Timothy is a wise, experienced old man.\n\nCLASS B\n\nThe character I chose is Timothy. Timothy's character traits are helpful, caring, and thoughtful. He is helpful because he let Philip have the warm side of the raft. He is caring because on p. 46 it says, \"I began hitting him and I remember him saying, 'If dat will make you bettah, go 'ead.\" Timothy is also thoughtful because he cares about Philip's feelings. He asks him how his head is feeling. This is how Timothy is helpful, caring, and thoughtful.\n\nactivity files\n\nthe_cay_character_analysis_chapters_1-3.pdfFile Size: 1356 kbFile Type: pdf\n\nDownload File\n\nfocus questions by chapters"
