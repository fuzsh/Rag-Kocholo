        "text": "There was once a time where Joseph Charles Hanisch had kittens. These weren’t just normal kittens either they were the type where you say, “Awwww,” at first glance. The type of kittens they are so fluffy that they trip over their own feet. Joe lived on a small farm just outside of Hartford with plenty of animals around. He would always joke around when I would pull into his driveway and say, “Please run over Jimbo! Please I beg you Brendan! I hate that cat so much.” When he would say that I would fake it and drive towards the cat, pulling away at the last moment. Jimbo was a tom-cat that wasn’t very friendly to their actual kittens. Each day at school Joe would come up to me saying how he tried to kill that stupid cat. Always with no success. Then there was another older cat. This one was named Prince. He was the friendliest cat in the world, always cuddling up to everybody. Prince would join Joe and I when we were playing American Ninja Warrior on the hay-bales. Throughout the year the kittens were given away. Jimbo had vanished from the area. All that was left was the\n\nThis journal explains in thorough detail the impact that wild canids have within Australia, and have effectively represented this through multiple graphical and image depictions. The journal elaborates on the number of management and control techniques that have been put into practice as well as the development in these controls. This journal is specifically related to the video assessment topic as it covers the impact that wild canids have on Australia as well as a number of management schemes that’s been put in place. It will specifically help in the production and planning of the ‘impact and management’ section within the video. The journal is clearly reliable as it has a number of credible authors, is a successfully published journal and\n\nIf you were to take a midnight stroll through New Zealand wilderness, you would more than likely run into a brushtail possum. This Australian marsupial has large pointed ears, grey fur, and a bushy tail, hence its name. Though appearing cute and fluffy, be forewarned, for this little critter is one of the most voracious predators in all of New Zealand. Today, many New Zealanders consider possums to be public enemy #1. Now nearing a population of 30 million in a country similar in size of the state of Colorado, possums munch on extensive regions of forest, massacre millions of birds and chicks a year, and spread diseases such as the bovine tuberculosis to cows and other livestock (Groves, 2005).\n\nThomas Holmes was the best cat that ever lived; however, his life was cut short and finally ended with the deadly point of piercing needles and sharp dissecting scissors. Little Tommy, as only his closest friends knew him as, was first introduced into the world on the sidewalk of a busy New York street. As the smallest kitten in his litter, Tommy was bullied by his bigger siblings and was never appropriately fed. Severely malnourished, at age three days, Tommy was on the verge of death, and every sibling knew this. Sadly, they continued to fight Tommy and push him away when receiving their daily meals. Even his mother would move whenever Tommy had an opportunity to drink her nutritious milk. One day Tommy gave up, he laid himself on the bottom of their cardboard home and accepted his fate. He slowly drifted away from this world and ventured to the home he resides in now, but it wasn’t his time. With the power from the cat gods, he awoke on the table of a vet’s office.\n\nBrendan Smith (2012), focused on the harm and the negative impacts of parents spanking their children. Internationally it is viewed as a violation of children’s rights, and has even been banned in 30 different countries (Smith, 2012). Elizabeth Gershoff, a researcher on physical punishment suggests that physical punishment does not work because you have to make it stronger and harder every time in order to have the kids comply (Smith, 2012). It has been found that children who were physically punished are more likely to believe\n\nImplementing physical punishment is a topic that many people and even professionals seem to have some disagreement on it. Some believe that spanking should be used to discipline children, but others believe that spanking brings more damage than results. In this paper I will define what physical punishment is and where I stand in regards of this matter. In addition, I will explain the advice I would give to a parent who asks if spanking is a correct way of disciplining their children.\n\nThroughout the beginning of the novel Philip was very prejudiced and disrespectful towards Timothy. As shown in chapter nine when he stated “ I tried again, but it didn’t work. I stood up, threw the palm fibers at him, and screamed, “You ugly black man! I won’t do it! You’re stupid, you can’t even spell” (Taylor 70-71). Although Phillip was once disrespectful towards Timothy he later appreciates him, “ With his great back to the storm, taking its full punishment, he made it possible for me to live” (Taylor 114). Another example of his gratitude towards Timothy is, “ But now, for the first time, I fully understand why Timothy had so carefully trained me to move around the island, and reef” (Taylor 115). These quotes from Phillip introduce a new admiration of Timothy that was not present in the beginning of the\n\nCorporal punishment in these days has been becoming a topic in many old timers talks. Many believe that it helps and is definitely the way to go. The older generations still seem to believe that society would be better off if kids still got punished the way they did. They refuse to ignore data that has not supported the clams they bring up about making children better behaved or as they call it “Straightening them up”. Many believe that our liberal democracy population has views that are not valid and that the old ways need to come back to help us grow."
