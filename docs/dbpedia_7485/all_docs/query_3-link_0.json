        "text": "Small island formed on the surface of a coral reef\n\n\"Sand cay\" and \"Cayes\" redirect here. For the South China Sea island, see Sand Cay. For the city in Haiti, see Les Cayes.\n\nNot to be confused with Quay.\n\nFor other uses, see Cay (disambiguation).\n\nA cay ( KEE, KAY), also spelled caye or key, is a small, low-elevation, sandy island on the surface of a coral reef. Cays occur in tropical environments throughout the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans, including in the Caribbean and on the Great Barrier Reef and Belize Barrier Reef.\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Taíno word for \"island\", cairi, became cayo in Spanish and \"cay\" in English (spelled \"key\" in American English).[1][2][3]\n\nFormation and composition\n\n[edit]\n\nA cay forms when ocean currents transport loose sediment across the surface of a reef to where the current slows or converges with another current, releasing its sediment load. Gradually, layers of deposited sediment build up on the reef surface – a depositional node.[4][5] Such nodes occur in windward or leeward areas of reefs, where flat surfaces sometimes rise around an emergent outcrop of old reef or beach rock.\n\nThe island resulting from sediment accumulation is made up almost entirely of the skeletal remains of plants and animals – biogenic sediment – from the surrounding reef ecosystems.[6] If the accumulated sediments are predominantly sand, then the island is called a cay; if they are predominantly gravel, the island is called a motu.\n\nCay sediments are largely composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), primarily of aragonite, calcite, and high-magnesium calcite. They are produced by myriad plants (e.g., coralline algae, species of the green algae Halimeda) and animals (e.g., coral, molluscs, foraminifera). Small amounts of silicate sediment are also contributed by sponges and other creatures.[7][8][9][10] Over time, soil and vegetation may develop on a cay surface, assisted by the deposition of sea bird guano.\n\nDevelopment and stability\n\n[edit]\n\nA range of physical, biological and chemical influences determines the ongoing development or erosion of cay environments. These influences include:\n\nthe extent of reef surface sand accumulations,\n\nchanges in ocean waves, currents, tides, sea levels, and weather conditions,\n\nthe shape of the underlying reef,\n\nthe types and abundance of carbonate producing biota and other organisms such as binders, bioeroders, and bioturbators (creatures that bind, erode, and mix sediments) living in surrounding reef ecosystems.[11][12]\n\nSignificant changes in cays and their surrounding ecosystems can result from natural phenomena such as severe El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles. Also, tropical cyclones can either help build up or tear down these islands.[13][14]\n\nThere is much debate and concern over the future stability of cays in the face of growing human populations and pressures on reef ecosystems, and predicted climate changes and sea level rise.[15][16] There is also debate around whether these islands are relict features that effectively stopped expanding two thousand years ago during the late Holocene or, as recent research suggests, they are still growing, with significant new accumulation of reef sediments.[17]\n\nUnderstanding the potential for change in the sediment sources and supply of cay beaches with environmental change is an important key to predicting their stability. Despite, or perhaps because of, all the debate around the future of cays there is consensus that these island environments are very complex and fairly fragile.\n\nExamples\n\n[edit]\n\nExamples of cays include:\n\nA few of the Florida Keys, such as Sand Key, are \"cays\" as defined above. (Most of the Florida Keys are exposed ancient coral reefs, and the oolite beds that formed behind reefs.)\n\nHeron Island, Australia, a coral cay on the southern Great Barrier Reef\n\nPrickly Pear Cays, Anguilla\n\nRama Cay, Nicaragua\n\nTobacco Caye, Dangriga, Belize\n\nWarraber Island in central Torres Strait ( ), Australia, a small \"vegetated sand cay\" according to McLean and Stoddart (1978)[18] and Hopley (1982).[6] Approximately 750 m × 1,500 m (2,460 ft × 4,920 ft), this island is situated on the leeward surface of a large 11 km2 (4.2 sq mi) emergent reef platform. This cay and the surrounding reef flat formed in the Holocene, over a prior Pleistocene platform.[19]\n\nElbow Cays, Bahamas\n\nGreat Goat Island, Jamaica\n\nOcean Cay\n\nThe Cays of Morrocoy, Venezuela\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nIslands portal\n\nArchipelago"
