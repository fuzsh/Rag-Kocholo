        "text": "The Cayman Islands National Olympic Committee was constituted in 1973, but it was not until 1975 that an Executive Board was formed, and so was only recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on 19 July 1976, at the IOC session in Montréal. The Cayman Islands first competed at the 1976 Olympic Games and have been represented at every Olympics since, with the exception of 1980.\n\nIt has not yet won an Olympic medal. The best performance by a Caymanian Olympian occurred in 2008, when Cydonie Mothersill placed eighth in the women’s 200 metres in athletics. In 2010, Dow Travers competed in Alpine skiing for the Cayman Islands, in the nation’s first Olympic Winter Games appearance, finishing 69th in the men’s giant slalom. He competed again in 2014, but did not finish his two events, the slalom and giant slalom."
