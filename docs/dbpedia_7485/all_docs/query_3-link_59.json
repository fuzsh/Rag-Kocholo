        "text": "Bitter Guana Cay: The stunning tropical oasis, home to an endangered species of Bahamian Rock Iguanas in the Exumas. Discover this unique wildlife on our Bahamas Day Trips by Plane to Staniel Cay.\n\nBitter Guana Cay (otherwise known as the Iguana Island in the Bahamas) lies on the northern half of a semi-straight line of pristine islands and cays known as the Exuma Cays in the Bahamas.\n\nThe Exumas are made up of 365 islands, islets, and cays to the south of the Florida peninsula and is known to be the most beautiful region of the country.\n\nIguana Island Bahamas (Bitter Guana Cay) sits just 86 miles south of the country’s capital city of Nassau, making it an attractive day trip for many Bahamas tourists. It can also be accessed on a day trip from Miami.\n\nBahamian Rock Iguanas\n\nNorthern Bahamian Rock Iguanas (the scientific name being Cyclura deriving from Greek words cyclos oura meaning “circular tail”) are known for their distinctive thick-ringed tail.\n\nIt is estimated their species has evolved for the past three million years, branching into three sub-species: the Andros Island iguana, the Allen’s Cay iguana, and the Exuma Island iguana.\n\nThe iguanas on Iguana Island Bahamas are mostly about two feet in length, however, they can grow up to four feet from head to tail. They are brown with a distinctive pink color.\n\nThe population of Northern Bahamian Rock Iguanas is, for the most part, herbivorous — making its diet a plant-based itinerary. However, that is not to say it is not supplemented with the occasional dead crab or bird. They do not require any liquids in their diet especially if the plants they feed on are succulent.\n\nNorthern Rock Iguanas can live up to forty years.\n\nReproduction on Bitter Guana Cay\n\nSexual maturity in the male iguanas happens between six to nine years old. During spring breeding, males tend to get lighter in color.\n\nAround early summer (early to mid-June) female iguanas will lay up to a dozen eggs which feel like leather in texture. The eggs are buried in shallow burrows in the sand and left there for three months until they hatch and claw their way to the surface.\n\nBecause of their isolation on the island, they are indigenous and not found anywhere else in the world. Because of this, scientists have traveled the world over to study the Bahamian Rock Iguanas and their prehistoric features which resemble their dinosaur ancestors.\n\nWhat to do at Iguana Island Bahamas\n\nThough the island is small and at points narrow, the rocks which the iguanas call home make for great hiking opportunities.\n\nThere are numerous beaches on the island and snorkeling is a very popular activity among tourists. The shallow pools filled with beautiful coral and marine life are particularly interesting. On the east shore, one can witness crashing waves. With a good eye, you may be able to see Nicholas Cage’s private island.\n\nWhat to remember on Iguana Island Bahamas\n\nThe iguanas on Iguana Island Bahamas are fairly domesticated just as wildlife on any of the Exuma Cays. They are used to human interaction and, generally, pretty friendly. However, they will only let you get so close.\n\nRespect their boundary on their protected island and don’t make them feel threatened.\n\nThis species is a dying breed and they are in danger of becoming extinct. It is estimated there are only 5,000 left of its kind and the population has decreased over 50% over the course of the past 60 years.\n\nThe biggest threat posed on Bahamian Rock Iguanas is hunting as the Caribbean iguana is still regularly sought-after for human consumption. As an endangered and protected species, hunting still takes place illegally.\n\nThough, humans are not the only threat to this species. Non-domesticated dogs, wild pigs, and goats have all known to either prey on young iguanas or dig up the nesting eggs.\n\nNot only that, but the Northern Rock Iguana’s habitat is in major decline due to tourism development and increased logging.\n\nNearby Iguana Island Bahamas\n\nStaniel Cay: one of the Exumas most popular islands with an airport landing strip and several shops and restaurants. About three miles north of Iguana Island Bahamas.\n\nStaniel Cay Yacht Club: the most often visited destination on Staniel Cay and one of the most popular yachting points in the Bahamas.\n\nPigs Beach: Big Major Cay (Pig Island) is known for the Bahamas swimming pigs of Exuma and only five miles north of Bitter Guana Cay.\n\nBlack Point: a popular district in the Exumas with a central location to many top Bahamas attractions.\n\nGreat Guana Cay: 7-mile-long islet home to just over 100 people with great beaches, inspiring snorkeling, and easy boating.\n\nThunderball Grotto: underwater cave system featured in the James Bond 007 Hollywood hit, Thunderball. Popular diving and snorkeling point in the Exuma Cays. Less than four miles north of Bitter Guana Cay.\n\nCompass Cay — known for Compass Cay Marina and its population of habituated Nurse Sharks. One of the most popular spots in the Exuma Cays. Just over ten miles north of Bitter Guana Cay.\n\nHow to get to Bitter Guana Cay (Iguana Island)\n\nVisit Iguana Island in the Bahamas from Nassau or Miami / Fort Lauderdale, Florida with Bahamas Air Tours.
