        "text": "Dr. Maslanka is a professional writer of computer language compilers and run-time systems. He is retired from Hewlett Packard Company/Compaq Computer Corporation/ Digital Equipment Corporation, having worked in their Marlboro, MA, and Nashua, NH, facilities from 1975 to 1984 and from 1991 until his retirement from HP in 2002. Also, he has been a Lecturer in the BU Metropolitan College Department of Computer Science since September 1973.\n\nHe received his BS degree from MIT in Mathematics and Humanities. His MA in Classical Languages and his Ph.D. in Philosophy are both from Boston College. His Doctoral Dissertation was in the field of the nature of human language.\n\nWith the arrival of Object-Oriented Design and Programming, his interests turned to the structures of computer languages and the manner in which they are used so that programmers are able to express themselves concisely and cogently in the description of the processes which they are describing."
