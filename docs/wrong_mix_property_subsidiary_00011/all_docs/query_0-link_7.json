        "text": "American businessman\n\nFor other people named Robert Palmer, see Robert Palmer (disambiguation).\n\nRobert B. Palmer (born September 11, 1940) is an American businessman in the computer industry.\n\nPalmer was the final Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Digital Equipment Corporation.\n\nPalmer majored in Math and Physics at Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas.[1]\n\nPalmer was a founder of Mostek Corporation, founded in 1969 by former employees of Texas Instruments. Mostek manufactured logic, memory, and microprocessor chips. In 1980, United Technologies Corporation (UTC) acquired Mostek Corporation, and Palmer became executive vice president of semiconductor operations.\n\nIn 1985, Palmer joined Digital, and in 1992, he was appointed president and chief executive officer (CEO).[2][3]\n\nFrom 1995 to 1998, Palmer served as chairman of the board until Digital was sold to Compaq.[4]\n\nFrom 1993 to 1998, Palmer undertook numerous restructurings, massive layoffs of more than 60,000 people, and plant closings, in an effort to remain competitive.[5][6]\n\nIn 1993, Mitsubishi agreed to manufacture Digital's new Alpha 21066.\n\nIn 1994, Digital sold its Rdb database software operations to Oracle Corporation.\n\nIn 1995, Digital and Raytheon formed a multiyear, multimillion-dollar agreement to upgrade the onboard computer of the US Navy's E-2C Hawkeye aircraft.\n\nIn 1997, Digital sold its printing systems business to Virginia-based GENICOM.\n\nIn 1997, Digital sued Intel, accusing it of using some of Digital's patented technology to develop the Pentium microprocessor. Intel countersued, accusing Digital of violating 14 Intel patents. To settle the litigation, Digital sold its semiconductor production operations to Intel in 1998.[7]\n\nIn 1997, Digital sold its networking business to Cabletron.\n\nOn 13 November 1997, Palmer announced that the corporate strategy would focus on the Internet in Enterprise Computing.[8]\n\nIn June 1998, Compaq paid approximately $9 billion to acquire Digital, and Palmer stepped down after negotiating the merger.[9][10]\n\nPalmer has served on the boards of a number of companies, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD),[11] SEMATECH, the Semiconductor Industry Association, the Semiconductor Research Corporation, Cicada Semiconductor Inc., and NLine Corporation.[12]\n\nPalmer is on the board of trustees of the Cooper Institute for Aerobic Research, a non-profit preventive medicine research and education organization."
