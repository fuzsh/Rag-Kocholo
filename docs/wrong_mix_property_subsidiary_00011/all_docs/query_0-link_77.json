        "text": "(IDG) -- Compaq has been awarded the right to build what is claimed to be the world's fastest supercomputer for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The almost 12,000-processor machine is nearly the size of five basketball courts, the U.S. government announced Tuesday.\n\nThe $200 million-plus contract will require Compaq to provide a 30 trillion operations-per-second (30 teraops) system codenamed \"Q.\" The computer will be used by the DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to test the reliability of nuclear weapons without the use of underground nuclear testing.\n\nThe supercomputer is part of the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI) within the NNSA's Stockpile Stewardship Program. The new computer will be housed at the new Strategic Computing Complex at the NNSA's Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico.\n\nASCI Q will consist of 375 AlphaServer GS320 systems that will hold 11,968 Alpha processors. The processors will have EV68 CPUs (central processing units) running in excess of 1,250MHz on Compaq's Tru64 Unix operating system.\n\nThe computer will require more than 21,000 square feet of space and will be coupled together with more than 6,000 fiber and copper cables. ASCI Q will offer in excess of 600T bytes of hard disk storage -- enough to store the U.S. Library of Congress 20 times over -- 12T bytes of main memory, and will receive round-the-clock service and support, according to Compaq.\n\nMORE COMPUTING INTELLIGENCE IDG.net home page Make your PC work better with these tips ITWorld.com E-BusinessWorld TechInformer: The Thinking Internaut's Guide to the Tech Industry Reviews & in-depth info at IDG.net How-to and advice from IDG.net Download free PC software from PCWorld.com Questions about computers?

Compaq is contracted to be able to upgrade the system to 100 trillion floating operations per second (100 teraops) by 2004.\n\nIf you put every man, woman and child on earth together and ask them to conduct 5,000 calculations per second, that would be equivalent to ASCI Q's computation power, Lipcon said. Compaq has been focusing its whole high-performance computing program on working on U.S. government supercomputing initiatives and such a strategy has paid off, he added.\n\nIBM's ASCI White supercomputer held the speed record prior to Compaq's announcement. The IBM computer, which will be fully operational later this year, is capable of 12.3 trillion operations per second. Lipcon suggested that Compaq's ASCI Q will be two to three times faster at theoretical teraflops than ASCI White.\n\nThrough its acquisition of Digital Equipment Corp. in June 1998, Compaq netted Digital's Alpha server unit and the Digital Unix operating system, which Compaq later renamed Tru64 Unix. Compaq also bought Tandem Computers Inc., a company in Cupertino, California, for $3 billion, which gave Compaq greater access to the enterprise computing market.\n\nCompaq has said recently that it wants to be viewed a full-computer provider from home computers to supercomputers, Lipcon said. Compaq has sold approximately a dozen supercomputers, such as a recently awarded contract to build a $36 million supercomputer with 2,728 Alpha processors for the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. Three of Compaq's supercomputers are being used for work on the human genome project.\n\nAccording to figures from market research company International Data Corp. (IDC), Compaq ranked second in the technical systems and server market in 1999, in second position behind Hewlett-Packard. The market consists of sales of systems that cost more than $10,000. Compaq held a 19.6 percent share in revenue terms of the $5.6 billion market compared to 20.8 percent for HP, IDC found.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nAnalysis: Can Compaq's iPaq thrive?\n\nAugust 21, 2000\n\nHow to gently force your Compaq to run Linux\n\nJuly 11, 2000\n\nAre cheap notebooks finally here?\n\nMay 26, 2000\n\nIntel launches 933-MHz Pentium III\n\nMay 25, 2000\n\nA supercomputer in every garage?\n\nJanuary 20, 2000\n\nRELATED IDG.net STORIES:\n\nCompaq supercomputer to feature 2,728 Alpha chips\n\n(IDG.net)\n\nNSF ups scale of supercomputing\n\n(Federal Computer Week)\n\nIBM commercializes supercomputer\n\n(InfoWorld.com)\n\nIBM creates fastest supercomputer\n\n(IDG.net)\n\nU.S. Dept. of Energy awaits IBM 12.3-teraflop supercomputer\n\n(IDG.net)\n\nIBM claims Europe's fastest supercomputer\n\n(IDG.net)\n\nBuilding supercomputers with off-the-shelf hardware\n\n(LinuxWorld)\n\nToyota acquires world's most advanced supercomputer\n\n(IDG.net)\n\nRELATED SITES:"
