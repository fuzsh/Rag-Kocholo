Just eleven years later, DEC led the minicomputer market.The company made test equipment logic circuits for its first three years, not creating a computer, the PDP-1, until 1960. In 1965, the PDP-8 helped DEC become the market leader. A roster of successful products followed in the 1970s. In 1981, DEC’s revenues reached $3.2 billion.With no strategy for confronting the rise of personal computers in the 1990s, however, DEC’s fortunes faded. Compaq bought the company in 1998.",

        "text": "General Doriot (l.) and Ken Olsen\n\nGeneral Georges Doriot and his pioneering venture capital firm, American Research and Development, invested $70,000 for 70% of DEC’s stock to launch the company in 1957.\n\nDoriot believed in Ken Olsen’s vision, once stating “Ken Olsen had a product that he could make the next day and that was important. But Ken also had a view of the future. He had a family of products in mind. Ken was taking a risk, but it was a thought-out risk, the kind of risk I favor. I was impressed Ken had the ability to sense the evolution of the market. He re-developed or re-invented products in some cases, always following the market. Ken had the desire to do something useful, constructive, and imaginative.”\n\nView Artifact Detail\n\nDEC – The Mill\n\nIn 1957, Ken Olsen and Harlan Anderson started Digital Equipment Corporation in Maynard, Massachusetts. The new company, Digital Equipment Corporation, took over 8,680 square foot leased space in a nineteenth century mill that once produced blankets and uniforms for soldiers who fought in the Civil War. The mill is still in use today as an office park (Clock Tower Place) and among its tenants is the online employment website, Monster.com.\n\nView Artifact Detail"
