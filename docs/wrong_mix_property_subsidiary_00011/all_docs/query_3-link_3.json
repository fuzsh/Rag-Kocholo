        "text": "MIT Lincoln Laboratory memoranda and reports, Sub-subseries 1.1.3, 1947-1967\n\nSub-subseries Scope and Content\n\nThis sub-subseries contains the records that Olsen created and collected during the time he was a student at MIT through the founding of DEC up until 1967. The Lincoln Laboratory was a predecessor group for DEC, since Olsen worked there immediately prior to founding DEC, and because many of DEC's early employees were also alumni of MIT, the Lincoln Laboratory, and MIT's School for Industrial Management. Most of the material in this sub-subseries consists of memoranda, technical papers, and reports published by MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. MIT's Servomechanisms Laboratory and Digital Computer Laboratory, which were eventually absorbed by the Lincoln Laboratory, also published material in this sub-subseries. Aside from memoranda and technical papers, this sub-subseries also contains engineering drawings, schematic diagrams, engineering notes, drafts of books on circuit theory and thermodynamics, articles, Lincoln Laboratory administrative records, and one promotional booklet published by Lincoln Laboratory introducing some of its projects and functions. There is also a significant amount of material documenting Project Whirlwind and the development of the Whirlwind I computer at MIT's Servomechanisms Laboratory. Other systems represented in this sub-subseries include the TX-0 and TX-2 computers, which were designed and developed under Olsen's supervision. Lastly, this sub-subseries contains writings authored by Olsen, including multiple printings of Olsen's thesis, \"A Magnetic Matrix Switch and its Incorporation into a Coincident-Current Memory,\" submitted to MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Electrical Engineering. This sub-subseries is arranged alphabetically by folder title.\n\nPresident's Science and Advisory Committee, Sub-subseries 1.1.5, 1967-1974\n\nSub-subseries Scope and Content\n\nThis sub-subseries contains memoranda, correspondence, press releases, and reports from Olsen's participation in the President's Science and Advisory Committee (PSAC). PSAC was created in 1951 under Harry S. Truman's administration to provide advisory opinions on science and technology to the executive branch of the federal government and to influence government agencies. Olsen participated in PSAC's final years under the Nixon administration, before Nixon eliminated the program in 1973. Some of the records in this sub-subseries document the context behind the end of PSAC and includes a letter from Olsen to the Office of the President resigning from his position in PSAC. During Olsen's participation, PSAC was divided into panels, with four to six members with special expertise in each panel's subject focus advising the Science Adviser to the President, which in Olsen's time was Edward E. David Jr. Olsen mainly worked on panels relating to “civilian technology” and programs that promoted research and development in science and technology. However, this sub-subseries also contains records relating to other PSAC initiatives, including health care, environmental health, energy, education, population control, urban planning, and unemployment.

In 1967, the Works Committee was renamed to the Executive Committee and then renamed again to the Operations Committee, but all three held the same functions and responsibilities. Most of the material in this subseries was created under the names Works Committee and Operations Committee, though a smaller amount of records came out of the 1967 Executive Committee. Other meetings and committees that are mentioned in this subseries include the Product Line Managers meetings and the Marketing Committee. These committees had budgetary control over all of the separate product lines at DEC. Product line managers, group managers, and vice presidents had to go through the Works and Operations committees to gain support for the products they managed. Committee meetings documented in this subseries cover budgeting and financial forecasts for all of DEC's departments, executive responsibilities, product plans, personnel compensation, business plans, and monthly reports by vice presidents and group managers. One of the meetings from 1964 included planning material for the implementation of DEC's restructuring into groups based on products with product line managers \"who would feel responsible for all of the details of each computer system.\" This subseries also contains the 1965 Works Committee ballot, which were filled out by all Works Committee members projecting sales volumes for different products from 1965 to 1967. This ballot also contains responses from committee members regarding forecasts for estimated numbers of people at DEC, new products to be introduced, \"industry position desired,\" and \"rent or not rent.\" Ballots in this subseries were filled out by DEC's early leaders, including Ken Olsen, Win Hindle, Gordon Bell, Dick Best, Maynard Sandler, and Richard Mills. In 1983, the Operations Committee was replaced by three new committees: the Product Strategy Committee, the Marketing/Sales Strategy Committee, and the Management Committee. For more material from the Works and Operations committees, see “Sub-subseries 1.1.4, Ken Olsen papers: Internal committees.” This subseries is arranged chronologically.\n\nCustomer accounts and bookings, Subseries 9.4, 1969-1988\n\nSubseries Scope and Content\n\nThis subseries contains material relating to DEC's customers and clients, primarily created within the Corporate Accounts department.
