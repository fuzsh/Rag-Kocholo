        "text": "Images\n\nActivities\n\nMotivational Activity:\n\n1. Play the trailer for Blackboard Jungle (1955). Students should take notes on any words and phrases the narrator uses to describe the onscreen action and music. Discuss as a class:\n\nWhat is this movie about? How does the film depict teenagers?\n\nBy playing “Rock Around the Clock” over the image of “teenage savages,” what does the film seem to suggest about Rock and Roll music?\n\n2. Explain that Blackboard Jungle was the first movie to feature a Rock and Roll song on its soundtrack. After the film’s release, “Rock Around the Clock” went to number one on Billboard’s Pop charts, where it remained for eight weeks. However, due to some people’s concerns over the content of the film, Blackboard Jungle was banned in several American cities.\n\n3. Display June 4, 1955 New York Times article reporting the ban on Blackboard Jungle in Atlanta. Invite a student to read the article aloud. Discuss as a class:\n\nWhat are some of the reasons the Atlanta board of censors cite for banning the film? Based on your observations from watching the trailer, do you think the ban was warranted?\n\nDo you think the controversy over the film helped or hurt the popularity of the song “Rock Around the Clock?” Explain your answer.\n\nProcedure:\n\n1. Explain that the class will view three trailers for movies released soon after Blackboard Jungle: Rebel Without a Cause (1955), Rock Around the Clock (1956), and Jailhouse Rock (1957). Each of these films addressed concerns about teenagers in the mid-1950s, particularly the perceived threat of juvenile delinquency and the rising influence of Rock and Roll culture.\n\n2. Divide class into four teams and distribute Handouts 1-4 (links below) to the respective teams. Explain that each team will represent a group of 1950s entertainment industry professionals. Before playing the first trailer, each team should review their handout which explains the role of their organization and a set of criteria which the team will use to review the movies. Each team will have a different final report to share with the class. Check for understanding before playing the first trailer.\n\nTeam 1: The Film Studio (Handout 1 – Movie Posters)\n\nTeam 2: The Record Label (Handout 2 – Soundtrack Credits)\n\nTeam 3: The Motion Picture Association of America (Handout 3 – The Production Code)\n\nTeam 4: The Theater Owners of America (Handout 4 – Harrison’s Reports)\n\n3. Play trailer for Rebel Without A Cause (1955). Allow teams a few minutes to review their handouts and discuss the trailer as a group. Repeat the same process for Rock Around the Clock (1956) and Jailhouse Rock (1957).\n\n4. Once you have screened each trailer, allow teams a few minutes to discuss and reach their final conclusions about the films.\n\n5. Have each team present their findings to the class. For presentations, teams should elect several representatives to introduce their professional organization, explain their assigned task, and describe their methodology to determine which movie to promote or restrict.\n\nSummary Activity:\n\nTo check for understanding, students will submit to the teacher an “exit ticket” on a blank piece of paper. On the paper, students will write 3-4 sentences in which they pick one of the four trailers viewed during the lesson (including Blackboard Jungle) and discuss why they would most want to see that movie in its entirety. Students may base their decision on the film’s subject matter, music featured, star actors, the reviews it received upon first release, or any combination of these factors.\n\nExtension:\n\nAsk students to read Handout 5 – “Intelligent Handling of a Touchy Problem” — an article from the April 9, 1955 issue of Harrison’s Reviews. (Explain that Harrison’s Reviews was a motion picture trade journal for independent theater owners that published film reviews and professional advice for theater owners.)\n\nWrite a short op-ed to Harrison’s Reviews responding to the RKO Theatre in New Brunswick, New Jersey’s decision to run a special trailer at the conclusion of each screening of Blackboard Jungle. Do you agree with the management’s decision? If yes, explain why you think the strategy helped the community, and if no, explain what you might have done differently to address people’s concerns about the film.\n\nHandouts\n\nHandout 1 – Movie Posters Handout 2 – Soundtrack Credits Handout 3 – The Production Code Handout 4 – Harrison’s Reports Handout 5 – Intelligent Handling of a Touchy Problem\n\nStandards\n\nNew Jersey State Standards\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts: Reading\n\nNJSLSA.R1:Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts: Speaking and Listening\n\nNJSLSA.SL1: Prepare for and participate effectively in a range of conversations and collaborations with diverse partners, building on others’ ideas and expressing their own clearly and persuasively.\n\nNJSLSA.SL2: Integrate and evaluate information presented in diverse media and formats, including visually, quantitatively, and orally.\n\nNJSLSA.SL5: Make strategic use of digital media and visual displays of data to express information and enhance understanding of presentations.\n\nNew York State Standards\n\nNew York State Next Generation English Language Arts Learning Standards\n\nReading Anchor Standards\n\nKey Ideas and Details\n\nStandard 1: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly/implicitly and make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.\n\nSpeaking and Listening\n\nComprehension and Collaboration\n\nStandard 1: Prepare for and participate effectively in a range of conversations and collaborations with diverse partners; express ideas clearly and persuasively, and build on those of others.\n\nStandard 2: Integrate and evaluate information presented in diverse media and formats (including visual, quantitative, and oral).\n\nPresentation of Knowledge and Ideas\n\nStandard 5: Make strategic use of digital media and visual displays to express information and enhance understanding of presentations.\n\nTexas State Standards\n\nTexas Essential Knowledge and Skills for ELA & Reading\n\nMake inference about text and use textual evidence to support understanding.\n\nSummarize, paraphrase, and synthesize texts in ways that maintain meaning and logical order within a text and across texts.\n\nMake intertextual links among and across texts, including other media (e.g. film, play, music) and provide textual evidence.\n\nMake complex inference about text and use textual evidence to support understanding.\n\nTexas Essential Knowledge and Skills for Social Studies\n\nCulture: The student understands the relationship that exists between the arts and the societies in which they are produced.
