        "text": "The first films released in the United States at the turn of the 20th century had no sound, dialogue or music. The advancement of film technology only included a moving picture without the accompanying sound of the scenes or the actors speaking. These films would often include dialogue cards interspersed through the scenes for the audience to understand what was happening through narration or quotes from the characters. This was essentially an early form of subtitling but with the titles between film shots rather than subtitled at the bottom of the shot.\n\nTo provide sound, was up to each movie theater to supply music by PHONOGRAPH or live musicians. Organists, pianists, or small ensembles of musicians were hired to play classical music or IMPROVISE to the scenes of the film. When improvising, the musician (usually one - as multiple musicians improvising on the spot could create clashing ideas) would have an idea of what mood the film scene was trying to convey and then make up music on the spot to accompany the scenes. A better improvisor would give the audience a more satisfying film experience.\n\nEventually, CUE SHEETS were developed to help musicians make better musical selections to accompany the films. Cue sheets were books of sheet music with public domain or copyrighted classical music arranged in categories that the publisher felt would best match scenes and moods in the movies. The cue sheets would be organized into categories like “love songs” or “death scenes” or “danger” so that the musician could easily flip to a section based on a scene and select a piece to play that would most likely match the action on screen.\n\nFinally, PHOTOPLAY music began to be used. This is when the movie studio would decide ahead of time what precise music they wanted performed for each scene of their film. This was music specifically composed for the film (and often sounded like the classical music from earlier cue sheets).\n\nTHE GOLDEN AGE (1930 - 1950)\n\nThe “Golden Age” of Hollywood lasted from roughly 1930 - 1950 and this was the time when America was most transfixed with movies, movie studios, and the film star. A huge breakthrough in this time period was for sound to finally synchronize to film meaning that audiences could now hear sound effects, the characters speaking, and even music! The first film with synchronized sound was The Jazz Singer (1927) with Al Jolson. Films with dialogue were called “talkies” because of the added ability to hear spoken voice.\n\nFollowing the advent of talking motion pictures, movie musicals became very popular. Some classics from this time period included The Wizard of Oz (1939), Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), Singin’ in the Rain (1952).\n\nAt the same time, Hollywood was starting to contract with classical music composers to write original scores for their films. In 1933, Max Steiner composes the first full soundtrack score to King Kong in what would come to be known as the CLASSICAL SCORING TECHNIQUE. This was music composed and exactly timed to scenes in the movies. Usually the film would be recorded and edited first, then passed off to the composer who would compose musical themes that precisely fit the mood and timing of each scene. In addition, the use of LEITMOTIFS (“theme music” that represents characters, objects, places in the film) saw a resurgence in film music which had previously been in fashion during the second half of the 19th century in the Romantic Era of classical music (in Europe and the USA). Other classically-trained composers were signed to studios and wrote for hundreds of movies. At this time, actors, directors, and composers were all contracted with specific studios and it was very unusual for a composer to write music for a film outside the studio they were contracted with.\n\nBRANCHING OUT (1950s)\n\nIn the 1950’s, composers stopped contracting with studios and went freelance. This meant that they were contracting per film with many different studios rather than just always working with a same studio or director. For the first time, non-classical and popular music began to find its way into film soundtrack - so there was less original classical-style music in a film and more radio hits or other popular-sounding tunes to fit the mood of the scenes. In some ways, this may have connected audiences to the characters better because they were connecting over a shared understanding of popular music from the time. On the other hand, without the specific original music written by composers, there was less of an immersive, special quality to films.\n\nFilm producers started the trend of hiring popular musicians to write marketable, radio-worthy songs for release in the film to help with promotion. The first time an audience member would hear the song was in the movie, but then it would be out on the radio following the film debut and remind the audience of the film. Some notable songs in this category include:\n\n“Moon River” by Henry Mancini – Breakfast at Tiffany’s (1961)\n\n“Don’t You Forget About Me” by Keith Forsey – The Breakfast Club (1985)\n\n“Happy” by Pharrell Williams – Despicable Me 2 (2014)\n\n“Temp Tracks” and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)\n\nTEMP TRACKS are temporary music tracks that a director will place over scenes to show the composer the mood or feeling the director wants the scene to have while the film is still in development. The temp track is designed to help with communication between director and composer and might save time by the composer writing something for the director that is closer to what they want.\n\nHowever, in order to appease the directors, composers’ original music can come out sounding too similar to the temp tracks. In fact, certain composers and studios have been sued for producing music that is too similar to another composer’s work.\n\nFor the film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Director Stanley Kubrick fell in “temp love” and discarded Alex North’s entire score for 2001: A Space Odyssey in exchange for his temp track of classical music.\n\nEven though the composer had written a complete film score of music for the film, Kubrick could not give up the classical “placeholder” works he had been listening to while developing the film and opted to keep them instead. The clip below utilizes Also Sprach Zarathustra from Richard Strauss’s 1896 classical tone poem.\n\nFrom the 1980’s through the 1990’s pop culture and consumerism shaped how film studios produced music. The pop song soundtrack overtook orchestral film scoring to a large extent at this time.\n\nSomething to note:\n\nWhen a character in the film can hear the music, this is called DIAGETIC MUSIC (like if it is on the radio in the scene or on a record or being performed live - or the characters are singing it) vs. NON-DIAGETIC MUSIC (when only the audience can hear it in the soundtrack).\n\nAs electronic music developed, composers blended orchestral and synthesized sound during this period. Many films had pop “theme song” by a major pop artist released along with the movie:\n\n“Ghostbusters” by Ray Parker Jr. – Ghostbusters (1984)\n\n“Power of Love” by Huey Lewis & The News – Back to the Future (1985)\n\n“(I’ve Had) The Time of My Life” by Mickey & Sylvia – Dirty Dancing (1987)"
