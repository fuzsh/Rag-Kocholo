        "text": "For a while, the musical was strictly limited to the the stage. However, with sound starting to emerge in film, the movie musical was born. Filmmakers knew right away that musicals were a great way to take advantage of the new innovation that was sound, with the first feature length movie with talking The Jazz Singer (1927) including music. And as sound became mainstream, the popularity of movie musicals arose.\n\nThere were multiple people during this time that helped to shape the movie musical. One of these people was choreographer and director Busby Berkley, who started off on Broadway before doing a string of musicals for Warner Brothers. His style of direction and choreography was innovative, with movement in the dancers and the camera in a time when most cameras were fixed. These moving cameras lead to more effective choreography. Many of his numbers were also elaborate fantasy numbers with, “sweeping views of geometrically arranged dancers moving in unison [becoming] a Berkeley trademark, including kaleidoscopic patterns of uniformly costumed chorus girls. He would literally cut through the roof of a soundstage to get the right distance for an overhead shot.” (Kenrick). The most famous of the movies he worked on was the 1933 movie musical 42nd Street about a down on his luck musical director staging one last extravagant show before his retirement.\n\nAlong with Busby Berkley, the duo of Broadway veteran Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers were also highly influential in the world of movie musicals during this time. The duo were highly successful and made several movie musicals for RKO in this era. The first movie they did together was The Gay Divorcee (1934), a movie based on the Cole Porter musical The Gay Divorce. In it, they invented what would become their standard formula, “in a high society setting, a charming playboy and a sweet girl with spunk get into a tangle of mistaken identities, fall in love on the dance floor (…), resolve their misunderstandings in the nick of time, and foxtrot their way to a black and white ‘happily ever after’ ending.” (Kenrick). Astaire and Rogers made many more movie musicals with this formula, cementing their place in movie musical history.\n\nMany other studios also created movie musicals with their own stars, including Paramount with Bing Crosby, 20th Century Fox with Shirley Temple, and more. Arguably the most successful of these was MGM with star Judy Garland, who starred in 16 MGM musicals including classic The Wizard of Oz (1939), For Me and My Gal (1942), The Pirate (1948) and many more. Some of the other famous movie musicals that came out during this time are Singin’ in the Rain (1952), An American in Paris (1951), High Society (1956) and more.\n\nLastly (I know, this is a long one), one of the pioneers of the movie musical was Disney. Disney created not only the first feature length animated film with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), but also the first animated movie musical. They created many more classic animated musicals with Oscar winning songs including Pinocchio (1940), Fantasia (1940), Cinderella (1950), Sleeping Beauty (1959), and many more.\n\nMovie musicals and their popularity during this time helped to move forward the American musical and showed that musicals were not just for Broadway anymore."
