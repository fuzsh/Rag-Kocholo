        "text": "Ajax · September 6, 2014 at 6:31 pm\n\nI’m rather stunned that Tarzan and his mate is left out of the list of essential pre-code films in as much as it is the only film of that era that I know of that presents Maureen O’Sullivan’s vagina. Watch the scene in the cave where she attempts to keep the lions at bay by making a firewall between herself and the lions. She kneels down to light and maintain the fire and clearly has no undergarment on beneath her loincloth. Surprise! Unlike the underwater scenes, in the cave it is definitely not Josephine McKim.\n\nLacy · September 22, 2016 at 1:51 am\n\nI just discovered this site via TCM’s “Painfully Funny: Exploring Slapstick in the Movies” course and I LOVE it! One of my fave’s is not yet listed, though, and I’d love to read your review of it. 1931’s “Man in Possession” with Robert Montgomery.\n\nEd Young · May 12, 2017 at 2:06 pm\n\nAs I was reading some of the pre code stuff I was also flipping through the cable channels and noticed a movie from 1938, four years after the Hayes Code was considered.\n\n“The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse” starring Edward G. Robinson.\n\nSeeing it was billed as a comedy, could this be one of those movies they tried to slip through the cracks? After all, the word “clitoris” wasn’t exactly a common word back then….except perhaps to a gynecologist.\n\nJust sayin’……"
