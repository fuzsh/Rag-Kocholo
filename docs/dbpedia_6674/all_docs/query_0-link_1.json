        "text": "Nell Gwyn (AKAÂ Gwynn or Gwynne) (1650-1687) was one of the first English actresses — in other words, one of the first actors to be a woman. She had the proverbial rags to riches story: she began as an orange girl (selling oranges at the theater), became a comedic actress and a star, and eventually mistress to King Charles II. The couple had two children. She’s become a folk heroine, and as such has made it to the screen a number of times. I have a particular affinity for Nell, both because she’s a fellow redhead, and who doesn’t love the idea of the bawdy girl gone upscale?\n\nLet’s take a look at the major representations of Nell Gwyn on screen:\n\nEnglish Nell (1900)\n\nWho played her? Marie Tempest, an English actress.\n\nWhatâs it about? Filmed scene from a play, which was in turn based on a novel.\n\nNell Gwynne (1911)\n\nAKAÂ Sweet Nell of Old Drury\n\nWho played her? Nellie Stewart, an Australian actress (this was an Australian production).\n\nWhatâs it about?Â AnotherÂ based on a play, about Nell and Charles II. The film is now lost.\n\nMistress Nell (1915)\n\nWho played her?Â Mary Pickford, probably the most popular actress of the silent era.\n\nWhatâs it about? The relationship between Nell and Charles II.\n\nNell Gwyn (1926)\n\nWho played her?Â Dorothy Gish, sister of Lillian and major star of the silent era.\n\nWhatâs it about? Nell and Charles, naturally, this time based on a 1926 novel.\n\nLove, Life, & Laughter (1934)\n\nWho played her?Â Gracie Fields, English actress and singer.\n\nWhatâs it about? A comedy in which Nell falls in love with the “Prince of Granau.”\n\nNell Gwyn (1934)\n\nWho played her? Anna Neagle, English actress who would later play Queen Victoria.\n\nWhatâs it about? Nell and Chuck, baby!\n\nHudson’s Bay (1941)\n\nWho played her? Virginia Field, an actress who was semi-successful in filmÂ but more successful on Broadway.\n\nWhatâs it about? Fictionalized story about a Canadian explorer who convinces Charles II to fund an expedition of conquest.\n\nCardboard Cavalier (1949)\n\nWho played her? Margaret Lockwood, English actress who starred in many of the 1940s Gainsborough Studios costume movies (including the lead in the 1945 version ofÂ The Wicked Lady).\n\nWhatâs it about? Comedy about a tradesmanÂ who, along with Nell, becomes enmeshed in the English Civil War (on the Royalist side).\n\nLet’s Make Up (1954)\n\nAKAÂ Lilacs in the Spring\n\nWho played her? Anna Neagle, who played Nell in the 1934 film (above).\n\nWhatâs it about? A modern-day actress must choose between two lovers. She has extended dream sequences in which she is Nell Gwyn and then Queen Victoria.\n\nThe Wicked Lady (1983)\n\nApparently Teresa Codling played Nell in what must be a bit part in the film, because I have no memory of her being a character and I can’t find any images! It is, however, a great film if you like the late 17th century and a hilarious film if you like cheese, so I recommend it.\n\nEngland, My England (1995)\n\nWho played her? Lucy Speed, an English actress known for soap EastEnders, and who had small parts inÂ Shakespeare in LoveÂ andÂ Impromptu.\n\nWhatâs it about?Â The life of composer Henry Purcell, with Simon Callow as Charles II, seen through the eyes of a 1960s playwright.\n\nThe Last King: The Power and the Passion of Charles II (2003)\n\nAKAÂ Charles II: The Power & the Passion or The Last King\n\nWho played her?Â Emma Pierson, English actress who was also inÂ Little DorritÂ (2008) and Suffragist comedyÂ Up the Women (2013-15).\n\nWhatâs it about? Four-part miniseries about Charles II, focusing on his various mistresses, including Nell. Rufus Sewell plays Chuck, Rupert Graves is the Duke of Buckingham, Helen McCrory is Barbara Villiers…\n\nIs it any good? YES, YES, YES.\n\nStage Beauty (2004)\n\nWho played her?Â ZoÃ« Tapper, English actress who has also been inÂ Mr. Selfridge,Â Cheerful Weather for the Wedding,Â Desperate Romantics,Â Affinity, andÂ A Harlot’s Progress.\n\nWhatâs it about? A female dresser who becomes the first actress once the ban on women actors is lifted, and the male actor who became a star for playing female roles. Charles II and Nell are smallerÂ characters.\n\nIs it any good? YES, YES, YES.\n\nWhat’s your favorite representation of Nell Gwyn on screen?"
