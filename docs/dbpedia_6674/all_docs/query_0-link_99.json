It enters intimately into the lives of men and women and affects them closely; it occupies their minds and affections during leisure hours; and ultimately touches the whole of their lives. A man may be judged by his standard of entertainment as easily as by the standard of his work.\n\nSo correct entertainment raises the whole standard of a nation.\n\nWrong entertainment lowers the whole living conditions and moral ideals of a race.\n\nNote, for example, the healthy reactions to healthful sports, like baseball, golf; the unhealthy reactions to sports like cockfighting, bullfighting, bear baiting, etc.\n\nNote, too, the effect on ancient nations of gladiatorial combats, the obscene plays of Roman times, etc.\n\nMotion pictures are very important as ART.\n\nThough a new art, possibly a combination art, it has the same object as the other arts, the presentation of human thought, emotion, and experience, in terms of an appeal to the soul through the senses.\n\nHere, as in entertainment, Art enters intimately into the lives of human beings.\n\nArt can be morally good, lifting men to higher levels. This has been done through good music, great painting, authentic fiction, poetry, drama.\n\nArt can be morally evil in its effects. This is the case clearly enough with unclean art, indecent books, suggestive drama. The effect on the lives of men and women is obvious.\n\nNote: It has often been argued that art in itself is unmoral, neither good nor bad. This is perhaps true of the THING which is music, painting, poetry, etc. But the thing is the PRODUCT of some person’s mind, and the intention of that mind was either good or bad morally when it produced the thing. Besides, the thing has its EFFECT upon those who come into contact with it. In both these ways, that is, as a product of a mind and as the cause of definite effects, it has a deep moral significance and an unmistakable moral quality.\n\nHence: The motion pictures, which are the most popular of modem arts for the masses, have their moral quality from the intention of the minds which produce them and from their effects on the moral lives and reactions of their audiences. This gives them a most important morality.\n\nThey reproduce the morality of the men who use the pictures as a medium for the expression of their ideas and ideals.\n\nThey affect the moral standards of those who, through the screen, take in these ideas and ideals.\n\nIn the case of the motion pictures, this effect may be particularly emphasized because no art has so quick and so widespread an appeal to the masses. It has become in an incredibly short period the art of the multitudes.\n\nThe motion picture, because of its importance as entertainment and because of the trust placed in it by the peoples of the world, has special MORAL OBLIGATIONS:\n\nMost arts appeal to the mature. This art appeals at once to every class, mature, immature, developed, undeveloped, law abiding, criminal. Music has its grades for different classes; so has literature and drama. This art of the motion picture, combining as it does the two fundamental appeals of looking at a picture and listening to a story, at once reaches every class of society.\n\nBy reason of the mobility of a film and the ease of picture distribution, and because of the possibility of duplicating positives in large quantities, this art reaches places unpenetrated by other forms of art.\n\nBecause of these two facts, it is difficult to produce filmsintended for only certain classes of people. The exhibitors’ theatres are built for the masses, for the cultivated and the rude, the mature and the immature, the self-respecting and the criminal. Films, unlike books and music, can with difficulty be confined to certain selected groups.\n\nThe latitude given to film material cannot, in consequence, be as wide as the latitude given to book material. In addition:\n\na. A book describes; a film vividly presents. One presents on a cold page; the other by apparently\n\nliving people.\n\nb. A book reaches the mind through words merely; a film reaches the eyes and ears through the reproduction of actual events.\n\nc. The reaction of a reader to a book depends largely on the keenness of the reader’s imagination; the reaction to a film depends on the vividness of presentation.\n\nHence many things which might be described or suggested in a book could not possibly be\n\npresented in a film.\n\nThis is also true when comparing the film with the newspaper\n\na. Newspapers present by description, films by actual presentation.\n\nb. Newspapers are after the fact and present things as having taken place; the film gives the events in the process of enactment and with apparent reality of life.\n\nEverything possible in a play is not possible in a film:\n\na. Because of the larger audience of the film, and its consequential mixed character. Psychologically, the larger the audience, the lower the moral mass resistance to suggestion.\n\nb. Because through light, enlargement of character, presentation, scenic emphasis, etc., the screen story is brought closer to the audience than the play.\n\nc. The enthusiasm for and interest in the film actors and actresses, developed beyond anything of the sort in history, makes the audience largely sympathetic toward the characters they portray and the stories in which they figure. Hence the audience is more ready to confuse actor and actress and the characters they portray, and it is most receptive of the emotions and ideals presented by their favorite stars.\n\nSmall communities, remote from sophistication and from the hardening process which often takes\n\nplace in the ethical and moral standards of groups in larger cities, are easily and readily reached by\n\nany sort of film.\n\nThe grandeur of mass settings, large action, spectacular features, etc., affects and arouses more\n\nintensely the emotional side of the audience.\n\nIn general, the mobility, popularity, accessibility, emotional appeal, vividness, straightforward presentation of fact in the film make for more intimate contact with a larger audience and\n\nfor greater emotional appeal. Hence the larger moral responsibilities of the motion pictures.\n\n- I -\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\n- II -\n\n- III -\n\n1.\n\n2.\n\nNo picture shall be produced which will lower the moral standards of those who see it. Hence the sympathy of the audience should never be thrown to the side of crime, wrong-doing, evil or sin.\n\nThis is done:\n\nWhen evil is made to appear attractive or alluring, and good is made to appear unattractive.\n\nWhen the sympathy of the audience is thrown on the side of crime, wrong-doing, evil, sin. The same thing is true of a film that would throw sympathy against goodness, honor, innocence, purity or honesty.\n\nNote: Sympathy with a person who sins is not the same as sympathy with the sin or crime of which he is guilty. We may feel sorry for the plight of the murderer or even understand the circumstances which led him to his crime: We may not feel sympathy with the wrong which he has done. The presentation of evil is often essential for art or fiction or drama. This in itself is not wrong provided:\n\na. That evil is not presented alluringly. Even if later in the film the evil is condemned or punished, it must not be allowed to appear so attractive that the audience’s emotions are drawn to desire or approve so strongly that later the condemnation is forgotten and only the apparent joy of the sin remembered.\n\nb. That throughout, the audience feels sure that evil is wrong and good is right.\n\nCorrect standards of life shall, as far as possible, be presented.\n\nA wide knowledge of life and of living is made possible through the film. When right standards are consistently presented, the motion picture exercises the most powerful influences. It builds character, develops right ideals, inculcates correct principles, and all this in attractive story form.\n\nIf motion pictures consistently hold up for admiration high types of characters and present stories that will affect lives for the better, they can become the most powerful natural force for the improvement of mankind.\n\nLaw, natural or human, shall not be ridiculed, nor shall sympathy be created for its violation.\n\nBy natural law is understood the law which is written in the hearts of all mankind, the great underlying principles of right and justice dictated by conscience.\n\nBy human law is understood the law written by civilized nations.\n\nThe presentation of crimes against the law is often necessary for the carrying out of the plot. But the presentation must not throw sympathy with the crime as against the law nor with the criminal as against those who punish him.\n\nThe courts of the land should not be presented as unjust. This does not mean that a single court may not be represented as unjust, much less that a single court official must not be presented this way. But the court system of the country must not suffer as a result of this presentation."
