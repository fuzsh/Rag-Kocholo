        "text": "Roy Del Ruth\n\nAmerican filmmaker\n\nRoy Del Ruth (born October 18, 1893, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S.—died April 27, 1961, Sherman Oaks, California) was an American filmmaker who worked with various stars, notably James Cagney, and directed a number of popular musicals in the 1930s.\n\n(Read Martin Scorsese’s Britannica essay on film preservation.)\n\nEarly films\n\nDel Ruth was a newspaperman in Philadelphia before moving to Hollywood in 1915 to become a gag writer for Mack Sennett. He soon was directing comedy shorts, including a number that featured Harry Langdon. In 1925 Del Ruth began directing feature films at Warner Brothers, and over the next four years he helmed more than 15 movies, including The Terror (1928), a horror film that included some spoken dialogue. In 1929 he directed the first all-talking, all-singing operetta, The Desert Song, as well as Gold Diggers of Broadway, which established the studio’s cottage industry of “Gold Diggers” pictures and also unveiled the pop standard “Tiptoe Through the Tulips.”\n\nDel Ruth directed five features in 1930, the most memorable of which was the boxing comedy Hold Everything, which starred Joe E. Brown. He made a bigger impact a year later with The Maltese Falcon, the first film adaptation of Dashiell Hammett’s famed novel, with Ricardo Cortez as Sam Spade. Although initially praised, the movie was largely forgotten after John Huston’s classic version (1941) rendered it obsolete. Del Ruth’s success continued with Blonde Crazy (1931), an enjoyable crime comedy that starred James Cagney at his quickest as a bellhop who teams with a chambermaid sidekick (played by Joan Blondell) to con a con artist (Louis Calhern); the film also featured the notable tune “When Your Lover Has Gone.” In 1932 Del Ruth directed Cagney in both Taxi! (1932), in which the actor played a pugnacious taxi driver trying to keep his wife (Loretta Young) happy in between confrontations with his union, and the boxing drama Winner Take All.\n\nBlessed Event (1932) was a crackling comedy, with Lee Tracy at arguably his best as a gossip columnist willing to do anything to increase circulation, and Employees’ Entrance (1933) starred Warren William as an unscrupulous department-store manager who wreaks havoc on the lives of those around him. Del Ruth handled five more films in 1933: The Little Giant, with Edward G. Robinson in good comic form as a beer baron who, after the repeal of Prohibition, tries to enter society and falls in love with a struggling socialite (Mary Astor); The Mind Reader, with William as a con man who pretends to be clairvoyant; Bureau of Missing Persons, a slight comedy featuring Bette Davis and Pat O’Brien; Captured!, with Leslie Howard suffering in a World War I POW camp; and perhaps best of the lot, Lady Killer, with Cagney in one of his finest comic roles as a gangster on the lam who draws on his experience as a movie theatre usher to become a Hollywood star. After making the drama Upper World (1934), his first under the Production Code, Del Ruth left Warner Brothers.\n\nMiddle years\n\nDel Ruth subsequently worked for various studios. In 1934 he helmed Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back, which had Ronald Colman reprising his role as London’s foremost amateur detective. Later that year he directed the popular Kid Millions (1934). The comedy musical starred Eddie Cantor as a Brooklynite who travels to Egypt to claim an inheritance and encounters a con artist (Ethel Merman) who is after his newfound wealth. Folies Bergère de Paris (1935) was a successful musical featuring Maurice Chevalier, Ann Sothern, and Merle Oberon; dance director Dave Gould won an Academy Award for the “Straw Hat” finale. Del Ruth was paired with Gould again for Broadway Melody of 1936, a typically lavish MGM production that featured Jack Benny, Robert Taylor, Eleanor Powell, and a set of Arthur Freed–Nacio Herb Brown tunes.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

He then directed the more serious political drama It Had to Happen (1936), although George Raft and Rosalind Russell made for an unlikely pairing. Private Number (1936) was a sodden soap opera, with Robert Taylor as the scion of a wealthy family; he secretly marries a housemaid (Loretta Young), to the displeasure of the nefarious butler (Basil Rathbone). In 1936 Del Ruth returned to musicals with Born to Dance, an elaborate showcase that paired Powell with an endearingly awkward Jimmy Stewart amid such notable Cole Porter songs as “I’ve Got You Under My Skin” and “Easy to Love.” The film was a huge success, as were two musicals from 1937: On the Avenue and Broadway Melody of 1938. The former featured a number of Irving Berlin tunes, including “The Girl on the Police Gazette,” and the latter was especially noted for Judy Garland’s rendition of “Dear Mr. Gable (You Made Me Love You).”\n\nIn 1938 Del Ruth directed figure skater Sonja Henie in the musicals Happy Landing, which also starred Don Ameche and Ethel Merman, and My Lucky Star, with Henie as a college undergraduate and Richard Greene as her professor. Del Ruth closed out the decade with Tail Spin (1939), an offbeat yarn featuring Alice Faye and Constance Bennett as aviators; the biopic The Star Maker, starring Bing Crosby as vaudeville impresario Gus Edwards; and Here I Am a Stranger (all 1939), a moving drama with Richard Greene as a son looking for his estranged father (Richard Dix).\n\nDel Ruth remained busy in the 1940s, though his films met with mixed success. After the tepid screwball romance He Married His Wife (1940), Del Ruth directed Topper Returns (1941), a popular sequel to the 1937 classic Topper. He then helmed the musical The Chocolate Soldier (1941), with Nelson Eddy and Rise Stevens, and Maisie Gets Her Man (1942), the fifth installment in the Maisie series starring Sothern. Du Barry Was a Lady (1943), with Lucille Ball and Red Skelton, had great potential—the original stage version was a huge success on Broadway—but Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cut most of Cole Porter’s score, limiting the film’s appeal. Del Ruth’s two films from 1944, Broadway Rhythm and Barbary Coast Gent, were largely forgettable.\n\nLater work\n\nIn 1947 Del Ruth directed the holiday comedy It Happened on Fifth Avenue, with Don DeFore and Charles Ruggles. Then came The Babe Ruth Story (1948), starring a miscast William Bendix in the title role. The biopic was rife with inaccuracies and clichés, and some critics consider it the worst sports biopic of all time. Red Light (1949), a standard crime yarn with George Raft and Virginia Mayo, was better received, and Always Leave Them Laughing (1949) was a fairly interesting story about a comedian’s rise and fall, with Milton Berle a canny casting choice. In 1950 Del Ruth reunited with Cagney for The West Point Story, a lively musical that was popular with audiences. Rather better was On Moonlight Bay (1951), with Doris Day and Gordon MacRae starring in a musical version of Booth Tarkington’s Penrod novels.\n\nDel Ruth then made a series of musicals, notably the patriotic Starlift (1951), which included cameos of Gary Cooper, Cagney, Day, and Mayo entertaining Korea-bound troops. About Face (1952) and Stop, You’re Killing Me (1952) were remakes of Brother Rat (1938) and A Slight Case of Murder (1938), respectively. In 1954 Del Ruth directed Phantom of the Rue Morgue, which was shot in 3-D but released “flat.” Del Ruth’s horror film paled in comparison with the 1932 version, The Murders in the Rue Morgue, with Karl Malden miscast in the Bela Lugosi role.\n\nDel Ruth was absent from the screen for several years, working in television. He returned to film in 1959 for the well-done low-budget horror picture The Alligator People, with Lon Chaney, Jr., and Beverly Garland. His final film was Why Must I Die? (1960), an account of Barbara Graham, a party girl convicted and executed for murder; it was an alternate treatment to director Robert Wise’s I Want to Live! (1958).\n\nMichael Barson"
