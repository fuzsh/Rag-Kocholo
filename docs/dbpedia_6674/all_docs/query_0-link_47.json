        "text": "At the very start of my career, more than three decades ago, I taught.a class on the comedian comedy tradition at the University of California-Santa Barbara, and I began the class with a screening and discussion of Laurel and Hardy’s The Music Box. This term, I am returning to this terrain with a class on the American Film Comedy, which again, out of nostalgia, I am beginning with The Music Box. So much has changed in my understanding of film comedy between the two that I thought have The Music Box as a constant might keep me somewhat grounded. It occurs to me as I am about to post this that my first two books, Textual Poachers: Television Fans and Participatory Culture and What Made Pistachio Nuts?: Early Sound Comedy and the Vaudeville Aesthetic are mirrored by the two classes I am teaching this term. Everything old is new again\n\nWhat motivates me to get back into film comedy is the sheer range of film texts which are available now that were impossible to access three decades ago. These new discoveries are surfacing as a consequence of archival restorations, silent film festivals, small dvd publishers, and the writings of film buffs and collectors. As a consequence, I am trying to introduce students to canonical works (Chaplin, Keaton, Langdon, and Lloyd still structure the opening weeks of the class) but also to disrupt that canon by showing how those performers are connected, existed alongside, and drew upon many performers who are today much less well known. For example, generations and generations of women as comedians, as directors, have been written out of the classical accounts of film comedy, but we now can see many of their works if we care to focus our attention in their direction. Similarly, we can start to locate today’s minority comics in a larger historical context and thus to reappraise the range of radicalized representations within the film comedy tradition with a greater engagement with Black creative agency.\n\nAs a consequence, the class places much greater attention onto screening works of comedy from all periods and writing responses to what you see than it places on film scholarship per se. I plan to tell my students that given the necessary choice to either watch films or do the readings, they should watch the films. And I am including many films, accessible online, to watch outside the class time, even as I am cramming the class period with clips, shorts, and features which we will watch together, hopefully with some collective laughter, despite the fact that we will all be wearing masks.\n\nMy book, What Made Pistachio Nuts? explores the intersection between film comedy and comic performance in other media. I plan to extend this work by showing connections between film comedy and comic expression in circus and popular theater, radio, television, recorded sound, standup, printed comics. and other related media practices. I will similarly be putting American film comedy into conversation with other international traditions and I am going to look for points where I can connect historic film comedy with contemporary comic texts.\n\nIf there’s a weak point here, it is that I give disproportionate attention to comedian-centered comedy at the expense of the romance comedy tradition — this reflects my interest in performance and my own knowledge and investments as a film scholar. I need. to figure out how to integrate that romantic tradition more fully into the course the next time I teach it, but I opted to follow my passion this go around.\n\nCTCS 688: Moving Image Histories: Methods and Approaches\n\nThe American Film Comedy\n\nFall 2021 | 4.0 Units\n\nCOURSE DESCRIPTION AND LEARNING OBJECTIVES\n\nAcross the semester, we will explore the American film comedy tradition -- from the role of slapstick in early cinema to the role that contemporary screen comedies play in fostering debates around gender, race, and sexuality. My approach is decisively revisionist with canonical figures and text read alongside those that history has tended to forget -- for example, what happens when we re-center silent film comedy from Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, and Langdon, to incorporate a broader range of recently rediscovered silent performers, including a number of women who had their own followings at the time? Performance is a recurring focus here, in speaking not only about comedian-centered comedies but also romantic and social comedies. Performance is understood in relation to a broader range of media traditions -- particularly those associated with popular theater (the circus, Vaudeville, music hall, Commedia Dell'arte) but also radio, records, nightclubs, and television. Through this focus on performance, we gain core insights into bodies, pleasure, and emotions, but also disruption and transgression, as central attractions of the cinema. Along the way, we will be asking what it means to write the history of a film genre as pervasive as comedy.\n\nNote: As we will discuss across the course, I do not guarantee that any given film will make you laugh. Comedy as a genre is only partially defined through laughter. Laughter, like comedy, has a history. Comedies may be especially interesting when they confront us with things that once made people laugh -- in specific cultural contexts -- but challenge us to understand why they were meaningful in the past. I also am pretty sure at some point in this class, you will find something you will find offensive. These films deal with stereotypes and show us more directly than many other genres do attitudes about race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender, class, etc., which are problematic. There is a power in confronting these moments directly and understanding how they fit into the larger history of American film comedy rather than avoiding them and simplifying our understanding of the past. Performers of color often struggled to nuance or disrupt these stereotypes through their staging of them, and we do them a disservice if we ignore these important sites of struggle.\n\nREQUIRED BOOKS AND SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS\n\nHenry Jenkins and Kristina B, Karnick, Classical Hollywood Comedy\n\nRob King, Slapstick Comedy\n\nAdditional readings will be accessed via Blackboard or online. In addition to viewings via the SCA Viewing Portal, many viewings will be accessed online. See the Media Resources List attached to this syllabus for a full listing of required viewing/listening for the semester.\n\nGRADING BREAKDOWN\n\nCollaborative Writing Round 1 20%\n\nCollaborative Writing Round 2 30%\n\nCollaborative Writing Round 3 30%\n\nFinal Paper 20%\n\nDESCRIPTION AND ASSESSMENT OF EACH ASSIGNMENT\n\nCollaborative Writing: Students will be paired and asked to engage in a written conversation each week around the class materials. This is your space to frame questions, offer reflections on what you have read and seen, and help to set the class agenda. I will write feedback intended to further push your thinking. Each student should right at least 500 words per week. Ideally, each group will go back and forth twice each week so you want to allow time in your course preparation to do this. This will be the primary means you demonstrate mastery over the course material. I will give grades three times across the term (Round 1 20 percent, Round 2 30 percent, Round 3 30 percent)\n\nFinal Paper -- Students will write a 10-page paper on a topic of their choosing related to the course content. They should consult with me as your plans are taking shape.\n\nWEEKLY SCHEDULE\n\nThe following weekly schedule is subject to change. Please consult the Blackboard site for the most current information, assignments, and due dates.\n\nEach week, we will be watching (and listening to) a range of different media artifacts—short and long—which help us to explore diverse aspects of that week’s topic. Many weeks, we will be watching films prior to class as part of the assigned homework. We will be providing information about the best way to access this material. If you have to make a choice between watching the films and reading assignments, focus on watching the films. But where possible, do both and incorporate reflections on each into your collaborative writing. I will be assuming familiarity with video/audio material assigned prior to class as we discuss each week’s material. You should be asking questions as you watch and you should bring those questions to bear on our discussions, in class and on Blackboard.\n\nWeek 1 Rethinking the History of American Film Comedy (Thursday, August 26th)\n\nReadings:\n\nJames Agee, “Comedy’s Greatest Era,” Life, 1949, https://scrapsfromtheloft.com/2019/11/17/comedys-greatest-era-james-agee/.\n\nHenry Jenkins and Kristine Brunovska Karnack, “Introduction: Golden Eras and Blind Spots -- Genre, History, and Comedy,” Classical Hollywood Comedy.\n\nLouise Peacock, “Clowns and Clown Play,” in Peta Tait and Katie Lavers (eds.), The Routledge Circus Studies Reader (London: Routledge, 2016).\n\nRob King, “Historiography and Humorlects,” Journal of Cinema and Media Studies 58(3), Spring 2019.\n\nMaggie Hennefeld, “Looking for Leontine: My Obsession with a Forgotten Film Queen,” Los Angeles Review of Books, 24 September 2019, https://www.lareviewofbooks.org/article/looking-for-leontine-my-obsession-with-a-forgotten-screen-queen/.\n\nRecommended Reading:\n\nJohn Rudlin, “Playing Commedia,” Commedia Dell’Arte: An Actor’s Handbook (London: Routledge, 1994).\n\nHenry Jenkins, “How Is It Possible for a Civilized Man to Live Among a People Who are Constantly Joking,” What Made Pistachio Nuts?: Early Sound Comedy and the Vaudeville Aesthetic (New York: Columbia University Press, 1992).\n\nIn Class Screening:\n\nThe Music Box (James Parrot, 1932) (27:42)\n\nThe Sprinkler Sprinkled (Louis Lumiere, 1895) (1:12)\n\nUne Histoire Roulante (Alice Guy Blache, 1906) (2:35)\n\nThe ?
