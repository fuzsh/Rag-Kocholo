        "text": "If you’re a classic movie fan who has never seen “Just Imagine,” I’m confident you could never have imagined anything like this 1930 film.\n\nIt’s a pre-Code sci-fi musical comedy with Busby Berkley-like dance numbers, vaudevillian humor, a trip to Mars and a man brought back to life after 50 years.\n\nOf course, you’re curious – how can you not be? I was too, and that’s why it’s my choice for the Futurethon blogathon hosted by Barry from Cinematic Catharsis and Gill from Realweegiemidgetreviews.\n\nYou’ll find stories by many talented writers about movies set in the future on the two host websites, so please check them out.\n\nSet in 1980, personal little airplanes have replaced cars, pills have replaced food and people have numbers instead of names. Oh, and Mars is inhabited by twins – a good and bad version of each Martian.\n\nImagining a future\n\nIt was only minutes into “Just Imagine” that it was clear the film was going to be as wild and strange and perhaps even as inventive as it sounds. Time to suspend your disbelief and let your imagination fly.\n\nThe title is the set up for the film: A narrator asks viewers to “just imagine” various scenarios and if you can’t imagine what he’s saying, you’ll be helped by intertitles that spell it out.\n\n“Just Imagine what a difference 50 years can make!,” the narrator exclaims. Take a look at New York in 1880. It’s so quiet you can even hear the rustle of a bustle.”\n\nKeep imagining.\n\n“Just Imagine! The people in 1880 thought they were the last word in speed! Take a look at the same spot today,” the narrator continues as the setting changes to a busy Fifth Avenue filled with 1930s-era cars and people scurrying about.\n\nWe’re not done. Now imagine New York in 1980 where “everyone has a number instead of a name, and the government tells you whom you should marry!” And they aren’t kidding.\n\nThis 1980, as imagined by filmmakers in the 1930s, is a doozy. It’s a world of shiny 250-story skyscrapers, the sky is filled with small planes flying in orderly lanes, a new Prohibition is in effect, a spotlight turns on in your home when the doorbell rings and newborns are cheerfully ordered from vending machines.\n\nAnd as the narrator warned us, the government decides your love life and name. However, the number-names are shorted to letters alone that mostly sound like a name. For example, our two main characters are LN-18, said as Ellen, and J-23 is shortened to Jay.\n\nWe meet Ellen (played by lovely young Maureen O’Sullivan) and Jay (played by John Garrick) as they pull their planes together and hover in the air for a moment of privacy. (They’re in a zone which only allows hovering for 3 minutes, so a traffic copy yells at them to move along.)\n\nWatch in disbelief – or awe depending on your point of view – as Jay steps out of his tiny cockpit, walks on the wing of his plane and jumps over to Ellen’s aircraft and sits next to her. He’s got news that the government tribunal will decide the next day whether they can marry or if Ellen will be forced to wed accomplished businessman MT-3 (Kenneth Thomson). Sure enough, Jay’s lack of achievement causes the tribunal to match Ellen with MT (pronounce it “Empty,” which is a fitting name for the dull suitor).\n\nThough they have four months to appeal, our two young lovers are bereft. Jay is a pilot who has reached his job ceiling and fears he can never match MT’s accomplishments. (If only someone needed a pilot for a trip to Mars! Whoops – spoiler alert.)\n\nSo Jay does what people do in musicals– he sings. It’s the first of many songs that slow down the film and you may wonder, as I did, why there are so many songs anyhow. Here’s the answer.\n\nThe names above the title for “Just Imagine” are Buddy G. DeSylva, Lew Brown and Ray Henderson, a trio of well-known songwriters who had huge success in 1929 with the musical “Sunny Side Up.” They were then brought in to write the screenplay for what has been considered a musical version of the great 1927 film “Metropolis” (just look at the skylines and you’ll see the connection).\n\nOur musical trio may not have been great as screenwriters, but as songwriters they were important enough to not only have a 1956 biopic made about them, but it was with an A-List team of director Michael Curtiz and actors Ernest Borgnine, Gordon MacRae and Dan Dailey for the film “The Best Things in Life are Free,” the title of one of their most famous songs.\n\nThis is a good time to mention that while the film looks ahead to 1980, it is stuck in the ‘30s – if not earlier – as characters bemoan in song and words the modern world’s loss of innocence. “I like a girl like my grandmother used to be. That why I like Ellen, she’s an old-fashioned girl. I should have lived back in 1930,” Jay says and sings.\n\nJay is sharing this with his best friend RT-42 (Artie is played by Frank Albertson) who is also dating Ellen’s best friend and nurse D-6 (or Dee as played by Marjorie White, who gives the film much-needed comic relief).\n\nTo cheer Jay up, Artie takes him to watch an experiment where a doctor works to revive a man who was killed by lightning 50 years earlier on a golf course. (I can’t explain this strange turn in the story.) This Frankenstein-like experiment is a success as the dead man awakens to finish his swing and yell “Four!” The doctors cheer and then leave as if bringing someone to life is something they do every day.\n\nOur golfer Peterson (played by vaudeville star El Brendel, who gets top billing and is known for speaking with a strange Swedish accent) is upset. They just can’t leave him there – can they?\n\nOh yes, they can. “I’m through with you,” the doctor says. “To me you were just an experiment. If you’re unhappy, I’ll kill you again,” to which all the other doctors laugh.\n\nBystanders Jay and Artie take pity on him. They explain he needs a new name which becomes Single-O and they help him get used to his modern surroundings. First up is lunch. The cafe is a wall-sized mural with buttons. Put in a coin, push a button and out comes a pill that tastes like clam chowder, roast beef, beets, asparagus, pie ala mode and coffee.\n\n“The roast beef was a little bit tough,” Single-O says after taking the pill.\n\nNow, remember Jay yearning for a good old-fashioned girl from 1930? A similar refrain comes from Single-O who just wants the good old days back.\n\n“Back in 1930 a meal was a meal. You could see the thick steak with a jus running down … I don’t know boys, give me the good old days,” Single-O laments.\n\nHe’s given another pill that substitutes for alcohol, and it brings about more memories.\n\n“A big stein of beer with the foam on the top … there was something to drinking then. I don’t know boys, give me the good old days.”\n\nThat’s when a couple at a nearby vending machine decides it’s time for a baby and viola! Here it comes down the chute, all cute and cuddly and a few months old.\n\nBut wait, there’s more: We still have to get Mars and that is truly crazy town.\n\nScientist Z-4 (Hobart Bosworth) needs a pilot to take his new plane to Mars and wants Jay who resists until he realizes this would be his big accomplishment that would allow him to marry Ellen. The round-trip journey takes just under four months and will get him back to Earth in time for the tribunal meeting that will decide his fate with Ellen.\n\nThis miraculous space ship is Z-4’s works through the “absurdly simple” science of his greatest invention: the gravity neutralizer, the only thing that makes the trip possible. “With the speed of the earth’s motion and the rocket attachment, the plane will have sufficient momentum to make the journey.”\n\nThough Jay is warned about the dangers, he takes on the challenge and is joined by his best friend (“We’ve gone through everything together, there’s no reason we should stop now,” says Artie) and stowaway Single-O.\n\nThis big moment is anti-climatic as the tiny rocket takes off in a large puff of smoke that covers everything. On the trip, the trio of men do not need extra oxygen, special equipment or a place to sit as all the action takes place in one spot where they stand around a lot.\n\nOnce on Mars, we see that Martians wear scanty two-piece outfits (even the men who look like a cross between a gladiator and Fred Flintstone), they speak in grunts and other sounds, and use silly broad gestures with their arms and faces. And don’t forget about the twin factor which we’ll first witness during a large dance number with Martians dressed as apes.\n\nWill our hapless trio be able to figure out the good Martian twin from the evil one? Can they ever get back to their spaceship and in time for Jay to make the meeting with the tribunal? Or will poor Ellen get stuck marrying the lame MT guy? Just imagine the possibilities.\n\nBackground on the film\n\nIn this futuristic film, we never fully leave 1930 behind and that’s OK. The set design is bit minimalistic at times, but is inspired by art deco and the styles of 1930. The cityscape is a nod to “Metropolis” and was built as a giant miniature over five months by more than 200 people in a former Army balloon hangar at a cost of $168,000. The film received an Oscar nomination for best art direction by Stephen Goosson and Ralph Hammeras.\n\nIf you feel a familiar twinge watching “Just Imagine,” that’s because sets and scenes like the dancing girls on Mars, a large Martian idol with moveable parts, the planes/spaceship and futuristic sets were reused in “Flash Gordon” and “Buck Rogers,” among other films.\n\nThen there’s the laboratory scene where the doctor is reviving the dead golfer. It gives off strong “Frankenstein” vibes because it’s the first on-screen appearance for some of the equipment created by set designer and electrical effects expert Kenneth Strickfaden that was later used in multiple films including “Frankenstein” (1931).\n\nThe wardrobe is also reminiscent of 1930 as many of the gowns are in the gorgeous, figure-hugging style of the time, but there are a few interesting things to note. In 1980, men’s suits don’t have lapels. Plus, one side wraps across the body and is buttoned low on the hip and waist (you can see this in the lobby card above).\n\nThe nurse uniform has long slits that bare the leg up to the panties (pre-Code alert!). My favorite fashion is the “stay out” dress: Multiple pieces of a demure black dress with a white Peter Pan collar are unzipped and turned inside out to create a low-cut slinky white party outfit. Even the hat is transformed into a small purse.\n\nPredictions\n\nSo how did the film do with predicting the future circa 1980 (and even beyond)?\n\nIt did predict the air hand dryer and it’s much quieter than the industrial strength ones we use today. In the film, it’s a small circle on a wall above a sink that is activated with a foot pedal that will also fold up the sink and cleverly hide it behind a door when you’re done. That’s a pretty cool move.\n\nPeople can talk to each via a large video screen in their homes that’s like a supersized Facetime.\n\nYet even though we’re close to 50 years beyond the 1980 future setting of the film, we still haven’t hit some of its grandest moments and ideas – and that’s not necessarily bad.\n\nWe still drive cars, though now they’re starting to drive themselves. We haven’t had a manned trip to Mars and when we do, I’m sure the astronauts will need oxygen in some way. I’m happy that we still eat full meals instead of a taking a pill (that would be awful). And we still have babies the traditional way instead of ordering through a vending machine. Call me old-fashioned, but the only thing I want from a vending machine is candy.\n\nCast extras\n\nThe most recognizable face and name – by far – is Maureen O’Sullivan who is only 19 in this movie. Two years later, she would start her decade-long film appearances as Jane in the “Tarzan” movies, beginning with “Tarzan the Ape Man.”\n\nFrank Albertson is notable for roles in “Alice Adams” (1935) and “Room Service” (1938). He later guest starred in television westerns. In “Psycho,” he was the rancher whose $40,000 is later stolen by Janet Leigh’s character and was the mayor in the 1963 musical “Bye Bye Birdie.”"
