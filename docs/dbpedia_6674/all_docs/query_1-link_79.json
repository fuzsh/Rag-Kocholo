        "text": "01 of 10\n\n1930: The Broadway Melody\n\nThe first \"talkie\" to win the Oscar for Best Picture was 1929's The Broadway Melody — marking a huge step forward in the industry and for movie musicals. As MGM's first musical, its success would pave a path for some of the big screen's best movie musicals like The Wizard of Oz (1939), Meet Me in St. Louis (1944) and Singin' in the Rain.\n\nFeaturing music by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown, The Broadway Melody starred Anita Page, Bessie Love and Charles King as vaudeville performers and songwriters trying to get their big break on the Great White Way.\n\nIt beat out dramas like Alibi (1929), In Old Arizona (1928) and The Patriot (1928) — and one musical, The Hollywood Revue (1929) — in what was only the Academy's second annual awards.\n\n02 of 10\n\n1937: The Great Ziegfeld\n\nBased on the life and career of Ziegfeld Follies creator Florenz \"Flo\" Ziegfeld Jr., the extravagant The Great Ziegfeld (1936) took home Best Picture at the ninth annual Oscars — beating a whopping nine nominees, including Anthony Adverse (1936), Dodsworth (1936), Libeled Lady (1936), Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), Romeo and Juliet (1936), The Story of Louis Pasteur (1936), A Tale of Two Cities (1935), and fellow musicals San Francisco (1936) and Three Smart Girls (1936).\n\nStarring William Powell, Myrna Loy and Best Actress winner Luise Rainer, the film is packed with grand musical numbers and extravagant costumes. It spawned two sequels — 1941's Ziegfeld Girl, with James Stewart and Judy Garland, and 1945's Ziegfeld Follies, directed by Garland's husband and Liza Minnelli's father, Vincente Minnelli.\n\n03 of 10\n\n1945: Going My Way\n\nThe movie musical hit its stride in the 1940s. However, 1945 saw only one movie musical nominated for Best Picture: Going My Way (1944), which went up against dramas Double Indemnity (1944), Gaslight (1944), Since You Went Away (1944) and Wilson (1944).\n\nIt was the year's highest-grossing film and launched a musical career for its star, Bing Crosby — who played a priest in a troubled New York City parish. The film was such a success that Paramount Pictures followed it up with a sequel the next year called The Bells of St. Mary's (1945).\n\nIn addition to being one of the 10 movie musicals to claim the Oscars' biggest prize, Going My Way is also considered one of the few comedic films to earn the Academy's highest honor.\n\n04 of 10\n\n1952: An American in Paris\n\nThe '50s were a decade of the classic Hollywood musical, and there was no bigger star than Gene Kelly — who took home an honorary statuette for his triple-threat talents in 1952.\n\nThe musical masterpiece, about two friends who fall for the same Parisian woman, features a score by George Gershwin with classic songs like \"Embraceable You,\" \"Nice Work If You Can Get It,\" \"I Got Rhythm\" and \"'S' Wonderful.\" It's best known for its breathtaking 17-minute final ballet sequence that reportedly cost half a million dollars to produce.\n\nNominated alongside A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), A Place in the Sun (1951), Decision Before Dawn (1951) and Quo Vadis (1951), the film took home six Academy Awards but lost two.\n\nIt was adapted for the stage in a 2015 Broadway musical.\n\n05 of 10\n\n1959: Gigi\n\nVincente may have lost for An American in Paris, but he made up for it with an Oscar for directing 1958's Gigi — which would set records with nine overall wins, including Best Picture. It beat out Auntie Mame (1958), Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), The Defiant Ones (1958) and Separate Tables (1958).\n\nBilled as \"A New Fair Lady,\" the film brought Broadway songwriters Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe to the big screen after their 1956 musical My Fair Lady had swept the Tony Awards. The 14 original Gigi songs spurred hits like \"Thank Heaven for Little Girls\" and \"The Night They Invented Champagne.\"\n\nBased on Colette's 1944 novella of the same name, Gigi tells the story of an unlikely courtship between a young girl, played by Leslie Caron, and a wealthy Parisian playboy, played by Louis Jourdan.\n\nIt was adapted for the stage in 1973 and again in 2015 in a production starring Vanessa Hudgens.\n\n06 of 10\n\n1962: West Side Story\n\nMusicals were big business in the '60s and resulted in four Best Picture winners, including 1961's West Side Story, which took home 10 Oscars and beat out Fanny (1961), The Guns of Navarone (1961), The Hustler (1961) and Judgment at Nuremberg (1961).\n\nAdapted from Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim's 1957 Broadway musical based on William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, the film tells the tale of two star-crossed New York City lovers from opposite sides of their neighborhood. Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer and Rita Moreno starred, with Jerome Robbins co-directing (and recreating his iconic finger-snapping choreography from the stage).\n\nEarning 10 of the 11 awards for which it was nominated — the most of any movie musical until then — West Side Story received high praise from critics and audiences alike, becoming the year's second-highest-grossing film. It is still considered one of the gold standards in stage-to-screen transfers.\n\nIn 2021, West Side Story returned to theaters in Steven Spielberg's adaptation, starring Rachel Zegler and Ansel Elgort. It garnered seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, with Ariana DeBose earning Best Supporting Actress in 2022 for her performance as Anita, originated by Moreno.\n\n07 of 10\n\n1965: My Fair Lady\n\nIt took less than 10 years for Lerner and Loewe's hit 1956 stage musical My Fair Lady to make the jump to the big screen in 1964. Based on George Bernard Shaw's 1913 stage play Pygmalion, it tells the story of arrogant phonetics professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) who sets out to turn a poor Cockney flower seller named Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) into a proper English high-society woman.\n\nThe film won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, triumphing over Becket (1964), Dr. Strangelove (1964), Mary Poppins (1964) and Zorba the Greek (1964).\n\nHarrison also picked up the Best Actor trophy for the film, reprising his role from the original Broadway show. Hepburn famously wasn't nominated for Best Actress — the award went to Julie Andrews for Mary Poppins. Considering Andrews originated Eliza Doolittle on Broadway opposite Harrison, it was a controversial win.\n\n08 of 10\n\n1966: The Sound of Music\n\nAndrews may have missed out on My Fair Lady, but she later scored one of the most iconic roles of her career in The Sound of Music — the 1965 film adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's 1959 Tony-winning stage musical.\n\nShe played Maria, a young Austrian nun-in-training who becomes the governess to the seven children of a retired naval officer (Christopher Plummer).\n\nThe film was the highest-grossing of the year, and despite mixed critical reviews, it would take home five Oscars, including Best Picture. The competition? Darling (1965), Doctor Zhivago (1965), Ship of Fools (1965) and A Thousand Clowns (1965).\n\nAndrews would lose Best Actress to Darling's Julie Christie.\n\n09 of 10\n\n1969: Oliver!\n\nOliver! was the last of the '60s big-screen musicals to nab the Best Picture honor in 1969. The coming-of-age musical would take home six awards at the 41st Academy Awards, including one for director Carol Reed and an honorary one for choreographer Onna White.\n\nAn adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic novel Oliver Twist, Lionel Bart's stage musical originally premiered in London in 1960 and on Broadway in 1963. The film starred Mark Lester as the titular orphan, Jack Wild as the Artful Dodger and Ron Moody as experienced thief Fagin (Wild and Moody were both nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Best Actor, respectively).\n\nOliver! beat The Lion in Winter (1968), Romeo and Juliet (1968), Rachel, Rachel (1968) and Funny Girl (1968).\n\n10 of 10\n\n2003: Chicago\n\nA movie musical wouldn't take home another Oscar until Chicago in 2003. The art form all but vanished from cinemas after a string of box-office flops in the '70s and '80s. Though Hello, Dolly! (1969), Fiddler on the Roof (1971), Cabaret (1972), Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Moulin Rouge! (2001) all received Best Picture nominations.\n\nDirected by Rob Marshall, the film is an adaptation of John Kander and Fred Ebb's 1975 stage musical about two murderous women in the 1920s whose crimes lead to their celebrity (its 1996 Tony-winning revival is still playing on Broadway).\n\nChicago won six Oscars, including Best Supporting Actress for star Catherine-Zeta Jones. Renée Zellweger, John C. Reilly and Queen Latifah were all nominated for their performances — while star Richard Gere, who won the Golden Globe for his role, was one of the year's biggest snubs.\n\nIt beat Gangs of New York (2002), The Hours (2002), The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) and The Pianist (2002)."
