FILE - In this June 10, 2011 file photo, NBA Sacramento Kings basketball player Samuel Dalembert, top, from Haiti, plays with children at the Athletique Club sport center in Port-au-prince, Haiti.Dalembert lost a cousin and several close friends among the estimated 300,000 killed when a magnitude-7.0 earthquake rumbled across his native Haiti on Jan. 12, 2010. Two years later, the NBA's only Haitian-born player prays for progress, while tempering his frustration that more hasn't been done to rebuild his crippled country. (AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa, File)
