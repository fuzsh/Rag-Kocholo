        "text": "CHAPTER FIVE\n\nApprenticeship and Marriage\n\nIn May 1766, Jean-Samuel De Pont, Intendant of the Generality of Bourbonnais, married Marie-Madeleine-Françoise l’Escureul de la Touche. Depont père was informed that his new daughter-in-law was “the most beautiful intendante in the kingdom.”1 Her other more solid assets notwithstanding, Paul-François found it necessary to temper his son’s “natural vivacity.” “It is only fair that you pay for the luxury of satisfying your vanity. For example, I understand that it will cost 50 louis [1,150 livres] to have the marriage contract signed by the King. If this is so, you might avoid this expense. After all, you seem indifferent to this honor, which really does not amount to much since it is so common nowadays.”2\n\nIt was already too late. The contract had been signed ten days earlier before an assembly of the most distinguished representatives of Parisian haute société. Perhaps that is why Depont père did not attend in person. The month before he had drawn up a contract making Jacques Flesselles, new intendant of Lyon and colleague of Jean-Samuel, his legal representative at the official signing of the marriage contract.3 For Jean-Samuel, surely 50 louis d’or was a small sacrifice indeed for the éclat of this moment.\n\nAlthough a systematic listing of forty-three witnesses does not do justice to the pomp of the occasion, it tells us something about the social milieu Jean-Samuel frequented, or at least approached. Thirteen members of the royal family signed the contract, although they did not gather in person at the Châtelet Court to witness the transaction or attend the church ceremony on the following day. But they added no small luster to the contract. Immediately after the signatures of the King and the Queen are the names of Louis, Dauphin of France, the Comte de Provence, the Comte d’Artois, followed by five Princesses of the Blood and the four Princes—Condé, Bourbon-Condé, Conti, and Bourbon-Conti. These were followed by high functionaries of the crown in actual attendance; the vice-chancellor and garde des sceaux, Le Vue, the ministers of state, Saint-Florentin, Choiseul, Praslin, Bertin, the new controller-general, L’Averdy, and three members of the royal household, the dukes de La Vauguyon, d’Aumont, and de Villeguier. Jean-Samuel and his friend, Jacques Flesselles, could not have wished for a more elite audience, one that blended the highest royalty with the most distinguished civil servants, and included their own immediate superiors and potential patrons in an increasingly complex royal administration.\n\nThe remaining twenty-one “guests” at the signing tell us more about the “mixed society” through which Jean-Samuel had made his way since law school some twenty years before. They included three bankers or sons of bankers, a secretaire du roi, a conseiller au parlement, a conseiller du roi, a dean of a cathedral chapter, the chamberlain of the Elector of Bavaria, the Princess d’Armagnac, the Marquise de Montesson, Intendant Flesselles’s brother, and two Durforts, relatives by marriage into the Lescure branch of the Depont family, on this occasion demonstrating none of the social diffidence they exhibited toward Paul-François in La Rochelle. But perhaps more important to the advancement of Jean-Samuel’s career even before the marriage was the father of the bride, Charles-Francois-Joseph L’Escureul de la Touche. Immediately below the distinguished ranks of ministers and courtiers one senses a level of society where office, finance, and salon easily mingled.4\n\nWho was M. L’Escureul de la Touche? He was the son of a receiver-general of the royal domain and wood in Normandy. François de la Touche the elder had lived in the provincial town of Alençon most of his life. His modest inheritance consisted of diversified investments in land, wood, forges, rural textiles, and a score of loans to local residents ranging from the widow Gamier (75 livres) to the intendant of the province (1,146 livres). The elder La Touche does not fit the stereotype of the parvenu financier growing fat on the windfall profits of public finance.5 One must not overestimate the wealth of a rural “receiver,” whose accounts were subject to periodic inspection. After his death in 1748, François’s fortune of 76,690 livres was further pared down, by a series of audits that found his books “wanting,” to 42,429 livres. But perhaps the real balance sheet was not quite so modest as the death inventory suggested. La Touche père had furnishings and silverware worth 11,310 livres and 15,000 more in specie, sums inordinately large compared to his modest assets in land and rentes. And where had he found 80,000 livres to pay his son’s marriage portion in 1745, three years before? Presumably, he had chosen his son’s marriage as the moment to transfer the bulk of his liquid assets to the next generation. The effort was reciprocated by the bride’s family. The Cromots, also officiers de finance, had mobilized another 40,000 livres for the dowry en espèces. Beginning with this capital—probably raised at some sacrifice for both families—the next generation transformed a modest provincial fortune into a substantial Parisian one.6\n\nCharles-Francois-Joseph L’Escureul de la Touche—his name somewhat lengthened—increased the family capital by a wide variety of enterprises, most of them originating in government contracts. In 1755 he bought the office of Intendant et controlleur général de l’argenterie, menus plaisirs et affaires de la chambre du Roi. In this post, he was in charge of the royal theaters, their construction and maintenance, the purchase and leasing of stage properties, and the preparation of state pageants. The accounts of his “department” refer to sums owed for “various constructions,” to roofers, painters, ironworkers, and other artisans in the building trades, suggesting extensive subcontracting. La Touche dealt regularly with a host of royal suppliers (fournisseurs) of clothing, draperies, horses, hunting gear, and other luxury goods, stocked in the royal warehouses and placed at the disposition of the First Chamberlain of the Royal Household. Louis XV’s well-known passion for the hunt—and other needs for distraction from routine—often led him to leave Paris suddenly for Marly or Fontainebleau. His garde robe, a convoy of wagons and equipage, had to be ready at a moment’s notice.7\n\nThe office drew a salary of 10,000 livres in 1756, 12,000 after 1771. But the cost of the office—236,000 livres—was an indication that it was an entree to much greater rewards. First, there were royal gifts. La Touche’s colleague, Papillon de la Ferté, refers to the très belle tabatière du Roi received by both men in 1768 “because the king loved the theater” and to the jewel boxes from the young princess, Marie Antoinette.8 More important were the opportunities for profits from subcontracting. Papillon noted that all of the building expenses could not be accounted for on the états and warned La Touche of potential “difficulties” if there was a change of ministers.9 It is well known that royal procurement was an open door to supplementing one’s income. It also provided valuable contacts in high court circles. La Touche and his two colleagues were in a position to lend or “circulate” the stocks in their warehouses. In January 1769, for example, La Touche lent the foreign minister, Marquis de Choiseul, curtains, cords, and tassels, no doubt for a stage production at court.10 But the impression should not be only that of royal haberdasher or theater manager. Jean-Samuel’s father-in-law had invested in countless enterprises in the twenty years since his marriage in 1745.\n\nIn contrast to the clear balance sheets of Paul-François Depont, made “cleaner” by the uniform mass of five percent rentes, the inventory of L’Escureul de la Touche appears, at first glance, fragmentary and obscure. True, there is an aggregate total at the end of the twenty-nine articles of his partage of 1766 when he transferred half of his assets to his only child, but the precise composition of his fortune and the returns of individual investments are not quickly grasped. The reasons for this go beyond the vagaries of recording; French notaries were not careless. Uncertainty and complexity characterized the world of finance in which La Touche lived, and secrecy was one condition of its successful operation.11 Not only were the rates of return on these investments variable, but there also was a continuous reinvestment of capital which the inventory does not always clearly indicate and which is further obscured by a certain number of financial failures or partial failures; nor does the final bilan ever appear. But however unsure one is of the long-run profitability of certain placements, one thing becomes immediately clear: La Touche was no rentier. He was an active participant in the risky ventures of French “court capitalism.”12 His inventory reveals a series of temporary partnerships involving substantial capital sums, a network, not of rentes, but of notes (billets), shares (actions) and treasury claims (rescriptions). Consider the summary of the La Touche fortune in 1766 presented in table 5.1.\n\nInferring economic behavior from a single balance sheet has obvious risks, but the La Touche fortune undeniably reveals economic activities and investments strikingly different from those of the Depont family of La Rochelle. Only 10 percent of the La Touche fortune was in land, and it was not highly prized as an economic asset. In fact, an “observation” attached to the inventory said that the “fief of Rancy is more agréable than useful.”13 Having bought it from the Brunet family, tax farmers, and “other co-proprietors” in 1757,14 La Touche had no interest in living in the country, at least not after his wife’s death in 1761. The lease on the land returned only 1,750 livres, less than 3 percent on the purchase price, and 1,577 of this was absorbed in taxes, maintenance costs, and an annual mortgage payment of 1,000 livres. Rancy with its château, park, fountains, and “dependencies” had been on the market for four years (since 1762), but “no one had offered a price that Sieur de la Touche considered large enough.” The family’s lack of attachment to real estate of any kind is also indicated by the habit of renting a town house in Paris—at 1,500 per annum—in the parish of Saint-Germain de l’Auxerois.15 La Touche’s investments were clearly elsewhere.\n\nThe office, to be sure, represented a very large investment, almost 40 percent of the total fortune, though it bore a mortgage of 71,000 ten years after its purchase in 1755. But it was worth a good deal more than the gage (4 percent of the purchase price) in opportunities for subcontracting and other “arrangements” emerging from the custodianship of government warehouses of luxury goods. Indeed, regarded closely, the office was as much an enterprise as a bureaucratic function and reflected the skills La Touche employed in his other business ventures.\n\nL’Escureul de la Touche was a financier, not of the wealth and importance of a Pâris-Duverney or an Antoine Crozat, but one of those lesser creditors of the state without whom the entire system of public finance would have broken down. The Company of Farmers-General had to keep about 20 to 30 million livres in notes constantly in circulation in order to bridge the chronic deficit in royal revenues after 1750. The great financiers and bankers of the crown had to depend on a much larger network of creditors who were willing to lend substantial sums on relatively short term (two or three years) to fill out the huge advances promised to the Royal Treasury. Their credit, of course, depended in large measure on the secrecy surrounding the anticipated receipts from royal taxes.16 La Touche’s account indicates his loans to well-known farmers-general such as Richard, Mezières, and Augeard with whom he shared the risks of deficient tax receipts and also the potential profits of a surplus, and a return above the usual 5 percent on regular public and private rentes.\n\nConsider an operation in 1756. La Touche and his partner Boisneuf advanced 70,000 livres to Richard, farmer-general, “who was obliged to pay interest at the same rate (sur le même pied) that is agreed in the contract between (all) the investors and the General Farm.”17 Richard agreed to pay the interest quarterly to La Touche and Boisneuf. Apparently the returns were above the legal rate for a time since we read “the interest has been reduced to 5 percent.” Another investment in the tax farms during the Seven Year’s War was less fortunate. In 1757, La Touche lent 50,000 to the “Lachy Lease,” representing one-fiftieth of the total capital raised and was reimbursed two years later with an added “dividend” of 5,044 livres. He immediately reinvested the same capital in the “Augeard Lease.” But 1759 was a year of military defeat and excessive strains on public finance.18 The account reads: “The capital has not been refunded. There is even reason to fear that there has been a loss on this capital.” La Touche lost 12,600 livres of the 50,000 “without hope of being reimbursed,” along with the interest on the total capital during the two-year lease. Nevertheless, he did receive a partial indemnification from the crown so that his overall losses in the four years were reduced to about 3,000.19\n\nNot all of the investments were so risky. Each of La Touche’s thirty shares of the Fermes Générales of 1,000 livres had coupons attached with fixed dividends payable at stipulated dates, like modern U.S. treasury notes; on these he received assured returns, though less than 4 percent on a 30,000 investment in 1760. If the war played havoc with public finance, it had some benefits for investors in army supplies. In 1756 La Touche joined a “société of investors” along with his brother-in-law, Cromot, for 45,000, and received dividends of 6,400 livres over three years, about 5 percent per annum. The war was of course disastrous for overseas trade. La Touche’s foray into shipping ventures at Boulogne in 1757 was a “pure loss”; fortunately, the investment was small.20\n\nAltogether, La Touche’s commercial ventures were limited, but his range of investments still substantiate a close relationship between office, public finance, and large-scale enterprise.21 La Touche was willing to take risks with his capital, move in and out of short-term leases on the tax farms, enter temporary partnerships in army supply, and dabble in shipping ventures. He kept almost no specie in the strongbox, despite the large capital sums at his disposal; he was uninterested in real estate as an investment and even as a source of status or pleasure; he did not invest in perpetual rentes, preferring more speculative lifetime annuities, and very few of these.\n\nReading this article in La Touche’s inventory, one might share some of the popular prejudices against financiers: “The said M. Duttion de Boissy [notary] declares that he was given 15,000 livres by an unknown person who did not wish to give his name, to be employed for the acquisition of a lifetime annuity of 1,500 livres [10 percent] in favor of Sr. de la Touche, transferable in case of his death to Madame de la Touche, in case of her death, to his daughter, and thereafter to her children.”22 That the notary was able to buy such an advantageous rente in 1761 is a reminder of the crown’s increasingly desperate need for money. It also makes one wonder how long L’Escureul de la Touche would continue to prefer risky short-term loans to the tax farms to high yield government annuities even if the capital was permanently alienated. The year 1760 was a kind of turning point for financiers and gens de finance.23\n\nIn any case, La Touche decided to divest himself of his entire estate only one year after his daughter’s marriage to Jean-Samuel Depont. Most likely, La Touche had accumulated enough money in the twenty years since his marriage in 1745 that he could now think of social promotion. His father had died in 1748, his mother in 1756; his wife in 1761; his only daughter was a young and beautiful heiress. An “alliance” between “finance” and “high administration” was common enough in the second half of the eighteenth century.24\n\nCharles-François L’Escureul de la Touche and his son-in-law Jean-Samuel Depont must have been about the same age. In some ways their careers had been parallel. Both born in the provinces in the 1720s, they had made their way in Paris with little parental help or patronage. La Touche’s father had died in 1748 and Paul-François Depont, though never short of advice to his son, was far away in space and mentalité. Both men bought their key offices in 1755 at considerable cost and had borrowed heavily to acquire them. But while La Touche was pyramiding his fortune in the tax farms and in royal procurement services, Jean-Samuel had entered those long, lean years as a maître des requêtes. Living on modest gages and his father’s tight pension, deprived of the dowry and influence of a “good alliance,” he must have despaired at times of ever attaining the coveted post of Intendant and the security and status it would provide. He could not know in 1760 that two fortunes-in-the-making—one by the patient discipline of a rentier and the other by the risky ventures of a “capitaliste”—would one day be his. Still, in statistical terms, his years of “internship” were not exceptional; his labors at the royal council and in the demanding salons of Paris were the lot of most men of his état or profession.\n\nIn fact, regarded from the perspective of the collective careers of a generation of intendants, Jean-Samuel did well.25 He became a conseiller at the Parlement of Paris at the age of twenty-three, two years below the required age. Like so many of his colleagues, he obtained a dispensation for his age with the proviso that he would not have a “deliberative voice,” the right to speak and vote, until he reached twenty-five.26 Successively, he had attended a Parisian collège and law school to become an advocate attached to the Parlement—all before twenty-three. Etienne Pasquier, who later became chancellor of France under Louis XVIII, commented about the youth of the magistrates in the eighteenth century: “One entered the magistracy at twenty; at twenty-five one had a voice in its deliberations. There was (in practice) no rule governing the age of admission in the parlements.” Contrasting these young men to magistrates of his own time, he said they knew they had to learn from experience and from the great city in which they lived. They could have no illusions that their formal education before the age of twenty was sufficient.27 It seems they had none of the intellectual smugness associated with the graduates of the Grandes Ecoles of more recent times.\n\nThe “long years” extended from the moment one entered the Parlement to the day one obtained an intendancy. Jean-Samuel spent seven years as a conseiller and ten years as a maître des requêtes before obtaining his commission as intendant at the age of forty. But this long apprenticeship was not exceptional. Even Turgot, Jean-Samuel’s brilliant contemporary, spent eight years as a maître des requêtes before becoming intendant at thirty-four. Depont’s “professional minority” was only slightly longer than the average for his generation of future intendants.28\n\nAll sixty-seven maîtres des requêtes served three months of the year (par quartier) as judges at the Requêtes de L’Hôtel du Roi, a court that processed petitions from individuals or from corporations requesting royal letters patent. The maîtres studied these petitions, attempted to determine to which courts or jurisdictions they pertained, and then submitted them, properly annotated, to the chancellor, the chief judicial officer of the crown. The chancellor also named one maître des requêtes to serve as rapporteur (committee chairman and spokesman) for each case brought before the Conseil d’Etat Privé, which acted as a high court judging the legal competence of the lower courts, settling conflicts of jurisdiction, and annulling judgments that had been improperly made. Here again, the maître studied the entire dossier (those bundles of factums and mémoires, so much a part of this litigious century) and submitted it to the Conseil with his recommendations. Finally, the maîtres served in the Direction des Finances, a division attached to the Conseil du Roi. This department had jurisdiction over litigation arising from royal finances. The maîtres were called upon either to participate directly in the deliberations of the Direction or to serve on one of its commissions or bureaux. The bureaux prepared the work of the councils. There were six “ordinary” bureaux des finances and sixteen “extraordinary” ones, each composed of about two councilors of state and eight maîtres des requêtes.29\n\nThere is no doubt that this training provided an exposure to a wide variety of litigation and not only instructed the maître in the fine points of the law, but also familiarized him with the various problems involved in local administration. For these petitions and procès were not limited to tax cases. The cases reported by Depont to the Conseil Privé dealt with a whole range of issues, including contested inheritances, wardships, ennoblements, privileges and communal rights; they touched all levels of society, from cathedral chapters and municipalities to artisans and villagers.30\n\nIn addition, this training taught a young magistrate to synthesize disparate factual material and to present reports with clarity and precision. Even so promising a young man as Turgot was treated as an apprentice by the councilors of state when he reported to the Conseil Privé: “You have spoken very well, but a little too long. Next time, please be more brief.” In his subsequent reports to the Conseil, Turgot was careful to summarize each section of his discours and to present a general résumé at the end. “You have greatly improved. You have said a great deal, and you have been brief.”31 The incident indicates that the work of the commissions was intended as an authentic apprenticeship. However valid may be the criticism of favoritism and privilege in government, it would be difficult to accuse the Conseil d’Etat Privé of a lack of professionalism. It conscientiously inculcated an administrative expertise and a sense of service in its future intendants.\n\nDepont was named rapporteur before the Conseil Privé thirty-seven times in nine years, somewhat below the average but not markedly so.32 Work for the Conseil gave the maîtres des requêtes an excellent opportunity to display their legal and administrative acumen to the councilors of state, professional undersecretaries such as Ormesson, Trudaine, and Bertin, and to compete for posts in the high administration. It was a demanding forcing ground, not unlike the Grandes Ecoles in France today. The pressure was not relieved by a very modest stipend of 1,000 livres.33 Given the style of life prescribed for a royal administrator in Paris and the reluctance of his father to sustain it, Jean-Samuel must have been eager to apply for service on the committees in the finance department which offered supplementary emoluments. Depont had to wait five years before being named to one of the sixteen “extraordinary bureaux.” By 1765 he was serving on five of them in the company of such councilors of state as Moreau de Beaumont and Feydeau de Marville as well as such distinguished prelates as Cardinal de Luynes and the Archbishop of Albi.34 The subjects treated by these committees ranged from the administration of the property of “religious fugitives” and religious communities to the liquidation of the debts of the craft guilds and the reimbursement of certain venal offices abolished by the crown. Bureau VIII was concerned with “litigation involving shares of the Compagnie des Indes and concessions of lands in Louisiana,” a reminder to Jean-Samuel that his grandfather had been director of the royal company at La Rochelle forty years before.35\n\nIn the performance of his duties as maître des requêtes Jean-Samuel appears competent without being exceptional. Like his colleagues and contemporaries—Flesselles, Le Peletier de Morfontaine, Taboureau des Réaux, and Perrin de Cypierre—names that do not evoke the prestige of a Calonne, Turgot, Joly de Fleury, or Bertier de Sauvigny—Depont served his internship to be rewarded finally with an intendancy by the controller-general, L’Averdy. What is exceptional was Depont’s move as a youth directly from the provinces into the Paris Parlement to become an intendant all in one generation. Of the ninety intendants studied by Vivian Gruder, “only four and possibly five ‘new Parisians’ succeeded in transplanting themselves from their province and becoming Paris magistrates and then royal intendants.”36 Jean-Samuel was one of these five.\n\nThis statistic tells us something about the man’s speed and agility of adaptation to the imperatives of Parisian society, one for which his background at La Rochelle had not prepared him. Lacking outstanding administrative talent, with limited financial means and local patronage—at least at the outset of his career—how did he do it? “To become an intendant,” writes Roland Mousnier, “it was necessary not only to be a good maître des requêtes, but also to have a protector in the Conseil d’Etat.”37 To reach the ear of the minister, as even Paul-François in La Rochelle knew, one needed connections, contacts, and influence. The evidence available suggests that Jean-Samuel’s chief skill was knowing how to cultivate patrons. To “Birth, Talent, and Wealth,” his father had once ascribed the success of the intendant of La Rochelle.38 Perhaps he had underestimated “Protection”; it might compensate for modest endowments of the other three virtues.\n\nAnne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, descendant of an old robe family, spent much of his “term” as maître des requêtes in the 1750s frequenting some of the most distinguished salons of Paris. Here he met d’Alembert, Condorcet, Grimm, Holbach among philosophes, Quesnay, Dupont, Baudeau, and Gournay among physiocrats and économistes.39 Jean-Samuel’s Parisian connections were quite different. Intellectually less distinguished, they represented another part of the complex social world of the capital, one where affability and wit played a larger role than sustained intellectual discourse. For evidence of what Depont’s “society” was, let us consider again the guests at the wedding of Jean-Samuel to Marie-Madeleine-Françoise 1’ Escureul de la Touche in 1766.\n\nAmong the ministers of state was Monseigneur le Duc de la Vauguyon, tutor to the Dauphin, and correspondent of Paul-François in La Rochelle. One also finds “on the side of the groom” Princesse d’Armagnac, another dévote and correspondent of the trésorier de France. Jean-Samuel had not ignored his father’s advice entirely; he had “paid his respects” to the duke and the princess. Yet one wonders what influence they had with the controller-general or other members of the Conseil d’Etat Privé. The Dauphin was notoriously lethargic and little help could be expected from that quarter.40 Perhaps La Vauguyon did “speak to the minister,” but his influence was clearly declining as indicated by his loss of the post of tutor to the future Louis XVI. Directly after the name of Princesse d’Armagnac comes that of Marquise de Montesson. This “friend” was surely much more important to Jean-Samuel’s career advancement.\n\nMadame de Montesson was a member of the inner circle of the Duc d’Orleans, a much more politically active branch of the royal family.41 She later became the morganatic spouse of the duke. Fortunately, her niece, Comtesse de Genlis, the well-known novelist and educator, gives us a glimpse of the “intimate circle” of the Palais Royal in the early 1760s. Among the many roles created by this society was that of “confidant.” “At that time,” wrote the countess, “many men who were not attractive enough to have many conquests among the women assumed the more modest role of “confidant,” which in this society was not negligible in helping many of them make their way.” Among the names on her list was Jean-Samuel’s. “M. de Pont, the intendant of Moulins, also a very amiable man who a few years later married a charming person, the mother of the present Madame de Fontanges.”42 Madame de Genlis was not a superficial person; she did not use adjectives like aimable and charmant indiscriminately; they were virtues.\n\nThat Jean-Samuel cultivated his role of “confidant”—and even overstepped its bounds on occasion—is indicated by the following story. It is worth quoting at length because it reveals a great deal about the norms and milieu of Parisian high society.\n\nM. de Pont, the intendant of Moulins, was in love with my aunt, Madame de Montesson, who was unaware of this; he had been her friend for several years and he had never given her any hint of his feelings. One evening, finding himself alone with her, he was no longer able to constrain himself and, without any warning, he threw himself at her feet and began to speak to her in the most passionate manner. This sudden declaration seemed ridiculous to Madame de Montesson; she preferred to laugh about it rather than get angry with a friend whom she respected. She was holding a fan and playfully tapped M. de Pont’s face with it; but the little hook by which the handle of the fan was attached to the cardboard came off and caught M. de Pont’s nose, so that the fan was stuck to his face like a mask, for Madame de Montesson had let it slip from her hand amidst peals of laughter. At that moment, someone entered the room; Madame de Montesson laughed even harder, and M. de Pont, taking advantage of his misfortune, quickly rose to his feet without being seen, since the fan covered his face; he fled and carried it with him, only taking it off in the vestibule. The third party who had interrupted this tête-à-tête had not seen the face of M. de Pont and did not learn his name that day because Madame de Montesson did not want to reveal it; but M. de Pont was betrayed by the deep scratch on his nose which remained for several days.43\n\nAt first glance, this may seem like a trivial story about a social mishap. There may be more to it. It is curious that in this intimate and vocal society Madame de Montesson was unaware of Depont’s feelings “for several years.” Was this because it was unthinkable to the marquise that this “new Parisian” could aspire to be her lover? Was Depont’s “declaration of love” a calculated move intended—even if it failed—to make the marquise take notice of him and recommend him to the duke and other influential people? Was the move a reflection of Jean-Samuel’s self-confidence, a conviction that the marquise and her world were not too good for him? All of these explanations are possible. Montesson’s social power and influence were legend. She had a Talleyrand-like talent for survival, later salvaging her entire fortune through her contact with Madame Bonaparte.44 She commanded the respect of any careerist in Paris after 1760.\n\nThe fan incident did not hurt Jean-Samuel. He met his future wife probably in the private theater of Madame de Montesson. An anonymous gossip wrote later in the century that “M. de Pont” became intendant of Metz “because his wife plays on the stage of M. de Montesson,” an obvious slander, but not without a grain of truth.45 Jean-Samuel’s wife also played the role of “matchmaker.” Madame de Genlis ascribed the “brilliant marriage” of her own daughter to the suggestion of Madame Depont and to the dowry provided by Madame de Montesson. The young groom had been the marquise’s lover.46 Surely this was not the well-regulated world of Jean-Samuel’s father; Paul-François could not possibly imagine half of its “sins” or half its corridors. One may doubt the comment of Madame de Genlis that Montesson’s salon was “the most brilliant and witty” in all of Paris.47 Compared to the salons of Mesdames Goeffrin and Lespinasse, the circle of the Duc d’Orléans that emerges from the Genlis mémoires was cynical, sordid, and intrigant, and not very intellectual. Yet social assimilation was essential to Jean-Samuel’s career. In its own way the Montesson-Orléans circle was a training ground as well.\n\nThe tissue of influence that Jean-Samuel had woven was a varied one. At least four distinct coteries of influential people can be identified: the dévots with whom Paul-François had corresponded; the Orléans circle which Jean-Samuel had cultivated alone; Escureul de la Touche and other financiers; colleagues in the corps of maîtres des requêtes. He even gained acceptance from the Lescure-Durfort branch of the family who, although they might snub Paul-François at La Rochelle, were present in force at the wedding of the new intendant of Moulins.48 The list of wedding invitations had not been assembled at whim. It was a reflection of Jean-Samuel’s social and professional ascent. Duc de la Vauguyon, Marquise de Montesson, L’Escureul de la Touche, Jacques Flesselles, and even Duchesse de Durfort, wife of the ambassador to the Two Sicilies had been, in varying degrees, his patrons. For a moment, there was more unity in their world of Paris than their separate functions and social origins would lead us to think.\n\nThe marriage contract was signed 11 May 1766. Jean-Samuel’s financial problems were over. The dowry of his young wife—she was a minor under the law—totaled 240,000 livres, equal to the dowry of a duke’s daughter. Moreover, she was an heiress through whom Depont could one day expect to receive the entire fortune of Escureul de la Touche. In addition, his father in La Rochelle promised him an advance of 180,000 livres on his inheritance. In one ceremonial moment debts on his office were liquidated, 20,000 livres paid in coin by La Touche, and 5 percent annuities from both sides of the new “alliance” made legal obligations of the parents of the couple. That Jean-Samuel needed the money is indicated by his own small capital—public rentes yielding only 1,645 livres per annum. He had depended heavily on his father’s pension of 8,000, earning only a few thousand livres from his work in the commissions of the Conseil Privé. However, his “movables” suggest an ample style of life about which his father’s letters had given some hint. He had amassed furnishings, silverware, horses and equipage evaluated at 50,000 livres, over eight times the value of his father’s “movables” at La Rochelle.49 The “house in the country,” which had so upset his father, was representative of Jean-Samuel’s acquired Parisian tastes and the necessary mise en scène for his professional advance.\n\nAlthough Jean-Samuel was not altogether happy with the arrangement whereby both his father and father-in-law “guaranteed” his income rather than transferred much capital, he could hardly complain about his revenues beginning in 1766 (table 5.2).\n\nRoland Mousnier has argued that the intendants and the noblesse administrative in general were a group distinct from other nobilities of robe or sword. One aspect of that distinctness was their source of income. “The essential part of their resources came from their gages, pensions, and indemnities, that is, from remuneration from the king for their services to the State, above all, remuneration for their fidelity.”50 There is no question that Depont’s traitement was no perfunctory gage, similar to the almost symbolic remuneration of a parlementary magistrate. It represented 46 percent of his income in 1766. But it would be too easy to conclude from this that the royal government had “bought” Jean-Samuel’s loyalty. His years of training as a maître des requêtes had surely been a more powerful influence in shaping his attitudes and loyalties. A professional administrator was in the making.\n\nIf one considers the fortune as a whole, it may well be a result, more than a cause, of Jean-Samuel’s outlook. Like many wealthy Parisians, the intendant was master of a fortune composed of constituted rentes, public rentes, treasury notes, and shares in the tax farms. Land and seigneurial rights were almost absent. A moment’s reflection is enough to see why a Parisian would prefer such assets; they were readily transferable and divisible and, above all, easily managed, requiring none of the administrative skills the land demanded.51 Fortunately, Jean-Samuel had a father and older brother who could manage his land in Aunis and even collect his rentes from private parties “out there.” It was not by accident that Paul-François gave Jean-Samuel most of the public rentes, which, like La Touche’s treasury notes, were most easily collected in the capital. Only the grande noblesse with titled ancestral lands at their disposal placed status above convenience of administration and even above rate of return—at least until landed rents began to rise rapidly in the 1770s.52\n\nIn other words, a portfolio of diversified loans, easily managed, was the main feature of a Parisian fortune; land was the largest component of a provincial one. Perhaps this difference—and it was never quite this stark a contrast—was not only a question of practicality and a rationing of time, but also a matter of temperament. Was there some relationship between Jean-Samuel’s frenetic pace of life from Council of State to drawing room and his convenient package of loan contracts? As he approached the threshold of his professional career in Paris, Jean-Samuel did not want to be tied down to rural property. A generation later, he would have reason to appreciate the land more.\n\nTwenty years in Paris had made Jean-Samuel over in more ways than one. He had not only divorced himself from provincial mores and religious asceticism; he had developed a new set of values and skills of his own. Without the direct evidence of personal letters, one cannot be so precise and certain as in the case of his father. But we can go beyond stereotypes. Rubrics such as “noble” and “bourgeois” are not helpful here. It would be entirely misleading, for example, to characterize the deportment and outlook of Jean-Samuel Depont as “noble.” Nor can he be placed neatly into categories, such as “robe” or “sword,” with either the magistrates of the parlements or the old lineage nobles.53 Of course, he knew and used these families; he assumed the outer trappings of their social behavior, copied their dress and demeanor, but this did not mean that he shared a common outlook with them.\n\nTwo major influences had played on Jean-Samuel in these years in the capital. First, he had learned to be a royal administrator at the highest echelon. As a maître des requêtes he had been carefully trained as a professional who understood the business of government, the range and complexity of its functons, and the responsibilities of power. More than a parlementary magistrate, local trésorier, or municipal official, a future intendant and councilor of state had to take the “larger view” of public service. Second, Jean-Samuel had learned to negotiate the social corridors of Paris. This meant adapting to a fluid, complex high society that is not easily understood by modern schemes of social classification. The group that gathered for the Depont-La Touche wedding was a social amalgam. Jean-Samuel had to come to terms with a wide variety of “social types” ranging from salon lionesses and haughty dukes to royal procurement officers and quasi-public financiers. If all were not parvenus by social origin, all shared some of the traits of the parvenu—improvisation, quick-wittedness, charm, a capacity to manipulate others’ interests, and perhaps, above all, resilience, a thick skin in the face of a hundred slights, real or imagined.\n\nIn this society that gave no quarter—indeed gave nothing without the promise of something in return—what did Jean-Samuel offer to a Montesson or a La Vauguyon? La Vauguyon and the dévots might well have considered whatever service they rendered as a favor to Jean-Samuel’s father, an obligation among “brothers in the faith.” But why the Marquise de Montesson and her circle would have an interest in furthering the career of a man well in his thirties is harder to surmise. Montesson had a sufficient number of friends in high places already. Again, this points to the sheer charm of the man. Here was a “society” where women played a major role. Jean-Samuel had learned his skills as a confidant from scratch, and much more besides. In modern terms, he had become an “outer-directed” man. He was at home in “society.”\n\nThe agility and adaptation he exhibited in the drawing room was also reflected in his attitude toward novel means of accumulating wealth. Jean-Samuel had learned something about the importance—even public usefulness—of the tax farmer and creditor of the state. As an administrator-in-training, he had appreciated the role of the bankers of the crown; as a friend and kinsman of L’Escureul de la Touche, he must have learned its risks and perhaps its excitement as well. Public finance, like administration, was a technical profession. One historian argues that it was the very “scientific” aspect of public administration that most angered the magistrates of the parlements who only dimly understood high finance and public administration.54 In any event there was nothing incompatible between the professional expertise of Depont and that of La Touche. Their alliance reflects a wider community of interests than simply shared ambition.\n\nIn the final analysis Jean-Samuel Depont was a professional administrator with a respect for the levers of power and for the “experts”—financiers, intendants, councilors of state, court nobles, and salon hostesses—who helped make the “machine” work. Despite certain activities that appeared frivolous and wasteful to his father, Jean-Samuel was not an undirected person. The gambling, the house in the country, the équipage, the extra louis for the king’s signature on the marriage contract—these were not idle self-indulgences; they were the necessary means of social ascent in the capital. But the goal was not an idle existence. Jean-Samuel had become an agent of the Crown of France. Any appraisal of his outlook and deportment must begin here."
