        "text": "In March 1756, when smallpox threatened Wotton-under-Edge in Gloucestershire, residents gave thought to inoculating their children and using parish funds to offer the procedure to the poor, including newcomers in the textile mill. At a vestry meeting, fifteen of seventeen vestrymen agreed to hire a local surgeon to inoculate the poor at 5s. per head. Over a couple of weeks, the surgeon prepared, inoculated and attended to 336 patients, two of whom died. The record of this ‘general inoculation’ only survives because one ratepayer took the overseers of the poor to court, unsuccessfully, for using parish funds for this purpose . There is other evidence that the small town took smallpox prophylaxis seriously. In the following year, an eight-year-old orphan attending the town school was inoculated with his schoolmates. It was the full deal, with bloodletting, purgative medicine and a deep incision. ‘After this barbarism of human-veterinary practice,’ as the episode was recalled half a century later, ‘he was removed to one of the then usual inoculation stables, and haltered up with others in a terrible state of the disease, although none died.’ It was just as well: the little boy was Edward Jenner.\n\nThe coming of spring in 1756 also raised concerns about smallpox in Paris. The Duke of Orleans resolved to have his son and daughter inoculated. When asked for permission, Louis XV would neither approve nor prohibit his cousin’s plan of action. Dr Théodore Tronchin came from Geneva to perform the operation. More experienced than any Frenchman in the practice, he had developed a gentler procedure than was standard in England. His arrival in Paris caused a great stir. On 25 March, he inoculated the eight-year-old Philippe. The announcement of the happy outcome occasioned great rejoicing. The audience at the Opera was entranced by the sight of the Duke and Duchess taking their box with their children in their arms, and loudly cheered them. For the young boy, later Duke of Orleans, it was a formative experience. Always hungry for public acclaim, he led the liberal nobles in support of the French Revolution, under the name Philippe Égalité. However, security from smallpox did not save him from the guillotine.\n\nThe inoculations in Gloucestershire and Paris in 1756–7 reflect significant developments in the history of the practice. The initiative at Wotton-under-Edge is testimony to increasing popular interest in inoculation in the English-speaking world. For its part, Tronchin’s success in introducing inoculation in the house of Orleans made it fashionable in aristocratic and liberal circles in France, helping to establish its credibility and prompting emulation elsewhere in Europe. The two developments, at either end of the social spectrum, were mutually supportive. Prior to accepting the procedure, European princes and nobles often sponsored trials among children in charitable institutions under their patronage. Enlightened self-interest likewise led them to promote the practice among their servants and tenants. The widening demand for prophylaxis made it possible for more medical men to build expertise and introduce improvements, most notably a simplification of the procedure that made it more affordable and less traumatic for patients. The growing body of experience of inoculation challenged and transformed understandings of disease and inspired new thinking about public health. Furthermore, the expansion of smallpox inoculation in the late eighteenth century not only made possible Jenner’s cowpox discovery but also created the conditions for its rapid appraisal and adoption in many parts of the world."
