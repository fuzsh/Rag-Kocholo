        "text": "Less than a year ago, Kris Humphries fired Dan Fegan of Lagardre Unlimited and hired Marc Cornstein of Pinnacle Management. At the time that I wrote the On To The Next One piece about Humphries’ switch in representation, I wrote, “Cornstein is tasked with helping Humphries earn enough money to support himself in case he divorces Kardashian.” Call me Nostradamus…I, and most of the rest of the world, saw that divorce coming. No matter whether you are in the public eye, celebrities still go through the same things that everyone else does. So you can be as famous as Kim Kardashian or Brad Pitt, but still require the services that someone like a chicago divorce lawyer could provide, in the hopes of going through this process with as little stress as possible. However, in cases such as this, accusations can fly back and forth. There are many reasons why people break up, and unfortunately so many do not get closure on the subject or the answers they truly want from the other person, there are way that this can be rectified though. Some people may turn to lie detector tests to see just what actually happened with their ex-partner/ex-spouse, however, the lie detector test cost must be checked out first to see how much it will be before embarking on this course of action.\n\nBut one thing I did not predict was that Humphries would also be divorcing Cornstein within a year of signing him as his new agent. Cornstein, who represents Samuel Dalembert, Darko Milicic, Beno Udrih, and Nenad Krstic, seemed to have a solid game plan with Humphries. Cornstein hired Humphries’ best friend, Josh Ketroser, who had experience in the industry based on formerly working at Priority Sports & Entertainment. The Pinnacle Hoops website listed Ketroser as the companys East Coast Director and also posted information about Humphries. Those two names are no longer found on Cornstein’s agency’s website. That is because Humphries released Cornstein from his duties, and in the process, Ketroser left Pinnacle Hoops.\n\nKris Humphries is back with his original agent, Dan Fegan, who also negotiated Humphries’ 1-year contract worth roughly $8 million."
