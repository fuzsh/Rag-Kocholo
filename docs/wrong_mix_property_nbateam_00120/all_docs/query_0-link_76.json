        "text": "After his first season with the Indiana Pacers, Malcolm Brogdon has been voted the 2019-20 J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award winner, given by the Professional Basketball Writers Association, on Thursday.\n\nThe annual honor, named after the NBA’s second commissioner, is presented to a player, coach or athletic trainer who shows outstanding service and dedication to the community.\n\n\"I'm extremely honored to receive this award,\" Brogdon said. \"It comes as a surprise, for sure.\"\n\nBrogdon was selected from finalists that included Jrue Holiday (Pelicans), Kevin Love (Cavs), Josh Okogie (Timberwolves) and coach Lloyd Pierce (Hawks). Damian Lillard (Blazers) won the 2018-19 award.\n\n\"I was just looking at this list (of finalists). It had Kevin Love, LeBron (James), Damian Lillard,\" Brogdon said. \"I mean, it had some high-profile names. And not just on the court, guys who are doing tremendous things to give others great opportunities.\n\n\"I think (James and other NBA players' efforts off the court) opens the door, it breaks the glass ceiling for players to know that, look, I have this money. Keeping it and spending it isn't the only way I can use it,\" he continued. \"I can use it for good. I can use it to help other people transform other people's lives. So I think it's becoming more of the norm for guys.\"\n\nThe Brogdon Family Foundation was launched in July as the push for social justice reform heated up nationally after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Brogdon was at the forefront, leading marches in his hometown of Atlanta and spearheading the Pacers' own efforts.\n\nBrogdon worked with the team to increase voting access and partner with city and state leaders for criminal justice reform. He also is engaged with the JHA Education Project for literacy and mentoring and does Tuesday Talks with Malcolm for at-risk Black children in Indianapolis.\n\nThere's also his well-known Hoops2O and Hoops4Humanity partnership with the Chris Long Foundation that delivers clean water to east Africa by building water wells. In less than 2 years, he has helped raise almost $700,000 with other NBA and WNBA players.\n\n\"I'd like to just continue to expand it,\" Brogdon said. \"There are hundreds of millions of people who don't have access to clean water across the globe.\"\n\nThe winner was determined by a vote of the entire PBWA, which is composed of more than 200 writers and editors who cover the NBA regularly for newspapers, magazines and online news outlets.\n\n“The depth and breadth of Malcolm Brogdon’s commitment to making a positive difference is inspiring,” said PBWA President Josh Robbins of The Athletic. “Members of the Professional Basketball Writers Association salute him and commend his fellow finalists and nominees for their exemplary work.”\n\nReggie Miller is the only other player to honored as a Pacer, winning the award for the 2003-04 season. New Castle's Kent Benson won it in 1981-82.\n\nFollow Pacers insider J.Michael on Twitter @ThisIsJMichael\n\nPrevious J.
