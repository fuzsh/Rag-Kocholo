        "text": "Beat writer Eddie Sefko answered questions in a chat Tuesday. Here are some highlights.\n\nQuestion: Any idea of hope in the draft this early? Are we gonna keep our pick or is it going to okc?\n\nEddie Sefko: Still too early to tell on the draft pick. Toronto has a fluffy soft schedule the rest of the way, although they do have games against Indiana, Houston and Miami left. Chicago has a soft schedule, too. If either of those teams finishes ahead of the Mavericks, they likely will be picking no lower than 20th and that would allow them to keep their pick. Of course, that might also mean they are missing the playoffs. It's possible they could have it both ways -- make the playoffs and still keep the pick. But it still seems more likely that it's going to be one or the other.\n\nQuestion: where are the mavs planning on taking vacation at since it will be another long long offseason?\n\nEddie Sefko: I hear Cabo is nice in late April. Wait, Cabo is nice anytime.\n\nQuestion: I know a lot of questions have been asked over and over again, but who in this league looks at the mavs and dirk and say that this team can be a real contender?\n\nEddie Sefko: Nobody looks at them and says that this season. What they can hope to be is a dangerous team that produces an entertaining and competitive first-round playoff series against one of the big boys. That would constitute a solid advancement over last season. Then if they can add a couple more quality pieces this summer, maybe they have enough to take the next step and contend for a home-court advantage in the first round. That's the blueprint. Executing it is never as easy as drawing it up, however.\n\nQuestion: Hello, who might the Mavs target for the starting C job in FA this offseason? Dalembert seems too inconsistent to be a starter but is decent enough that we should exercise his option and keep him as a backup. Gortat and Hawes are interesting, Okafor might be a worthwhile reclamation project, and we could trade for Chandler but he's injury-prone having missed 60-plus games over the last 3 seasons. Do you think maybe we should settle the spot for the long-term once and for all and throw enough dough at Monroe that DET won't be able to match? Thanks!\n\nEddie Sefko: I have a general rule that my answer has to be longer than the question, but I will break that rule on this occasion. Center is not a real deep position in the free-agent market. Gortat obviously is someone the Mavericks like. They signed him to an offer sheet a few years back, which Orlando matched. Hawes is a solid player, too. Neither one is worth maximum money, but for the right price, I'd take either one of them. Probably prefer Gortat, but you could do worse than Hawes."
