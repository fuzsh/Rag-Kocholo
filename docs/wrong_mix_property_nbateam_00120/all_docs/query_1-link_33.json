        "text": "The LeBron vs. the Spurs narrative will drive much of the interest in this game, but frankly, this could be a 2015 Finals preview. It will serve as one of the new-look Cavs' best litmus tests before the start of the postseason, as the Spurs should be cruising their way to yet another 50-win season and top-three seed in the Western Conference playoff bracket by this point in the year.\n\nThis will be the fifth of a six-game homestand for San Antonio, which should reduce the incentive for San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich to rest his older starters. Depend on both teams' records at the time, it could also have major implications for home-court advantage in the NBA Finals, should the two teams cross paths there.\n\nHonestly, I was offended by the whole process. [The Rockets] publicly said that they were going out looking for a third star when I thought they had one right in front of them. I guess that's just how they viewed me as a player. I don't think I've scratched the surface of where I can be as a player and I think I'm ready for that role."
