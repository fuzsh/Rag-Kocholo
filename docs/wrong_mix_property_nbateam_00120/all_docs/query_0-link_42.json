        "text": "Kings fans and Kings fanettes:\n\nAnnouncing...A Big Ole Board Project\n\nI have decided its time to go public and get serious about an ambitious project that has been in the works in the background for several months now, for and by the Kingsfans board, in honor of the team the board is here to support.\n\nSo what is the Kingsfans Sacramento Kings Wiki Project? Well...its an effort to basically record everything that has shaped this franchise and this fanbase. Every player, every coach, every major media member, front office person, events, jerseys, honors, scandals, the fight to keep the team, arena specs, rivalries, playoff runs, draft picks...whatever, you name it, and we have been in the process of trying to document it. Some of you have already been contacted about the project, I have been recruiting in smaller groups and individually. Even as I'm typing this longtime members like Bajaden (the first and most enthusiastic of the recruits who has been there from the beginning), NoBonus, King Baller, Capt. Factorial, Warhawk and others are putting together various pages of this thing, but of course there is a lot left to do.\n\nThat's where you come in. Trying to get something of this scope organized and recruited, while I chipped in 100 pages myself in August, while trying to run an All Time Draft, ended up scuttling my flash movie project, and delaying both my annual scouting reports and the production of the annual Kingsfans Kickoff video. At this rate I'm going to be looking forward to the season getting started so I can finally have a vacation. But this was never supposed to be my project. This was supposed to be a Kingfans project. We have thousands of members on this board. Some more active than others. But after 8 straight years of losing, just about anybody here is a pretty diehard fan. We have fans who have had season tickets since the team's first season in Sacramento. We have people who knew the franchise even before then, in Kansas City and Cincinatti. We have fans who have met and known various figures in Kings history. We have fans on this board from around the world. People rarely stop to think about it, but this is a pretty elite group of Kings fans here. In the entire universe of fans of the Sacramento Kings, rarely are you going to come across a group this large and with this much combined knowledge about the franchise. That's what we are trying to capture and put down for posterity here.\n\nSometime here in the not forever future, the worm is going to turn, and the Kings are going to be back in the spotlight. There will be a rush of new fans who barely know what came before. If Vivek succeeds in bringing the Kings to Indian fans, there are 1.5 billion people there who might not even know who Chris Webber is, let alone the rest. For all those poor na√Øve newbie Kings fans to be, for anybody looking to bone up on what has been, who hears a name, or a reference to an event or year, we're looking to build a Kingsfans' monument to the team and everything it has been. We have the numbers and knowledge here on this site to do it. Even just a little contribution from enough people could turn this big project into a completed project. And so I'm looking for volunteers. The more the merrier, but every single volunteer and every single page completed brings us that much closer to completing a pretty special project. If you don't feel confident in your basketball knowledge, do a bio on one the beat reporters who have covered the team, contribute a page about the $6million dollar burger scandal, do a page on Slamson, add pictures of the various jerseys, whatever. Lots of ways to contribute and bring this project a step closer to completion. Of course everybody who does contribute will get their name on the project, as well as on any pages they chipped in to.\n\nI'm going to include a full outline of everything we are working on below, and then include several sample pages of the format we are using. The intention is to host the project on this site for the time being, in a special forum as a knowledge base/encyclopedia for Kings fans everywhere. Every day I'll post another page that has been completed by one of our members. My original estimate was that about 500 pages would be needed in the end, we're already about 30% to that number. With enough of your help, we could be well over half done by the time the season started.\n\nThanks ahead of time for everyone who takes some time out of their schedules to help make this happen.\n\nSample Player page:\n\nJason Hart\n\nBorn: April 29, 1978\n\nNumber: 5\n\nHeight: 6'3\"\n\nWeight: 185\n\nPosition: PG\n\nYrs w/Kings: 2005-07 (2 years)\n\nHow Acquired: traded (CHA/SAC) Aug. 2005 for a 2nd round pick (became Ryan Hollins)\n\nHow Departed: waived Mar. 2007\n\nDefensive minded journeyman point guard who lacked creativity and shooting ability, Hart's career had been on the upswing before coming to Sacramento, and he was not always content with the lesser role the Kings wanted him to play. A limited minute reserve in his first season with the Kings, he only played in 13 games in his second before being waived midseason.\n\nCollege & Pre Kings Career\n\nHart was a 4 year roleplaying starter at Syracuse who showed limited improvement through his college career, averaging 9.6pts and 5.8ast as a freshman, and 3 years later still averaging only 11.9pts 6.5ast as a senior.\n\nHe was drafted by the Bucks in the 2nd round (#49 overall) of the 2000 draft but played in only a single game for them in 2000-01, and was waived at the end of training camp for the 2001-02 season. San Antonio would pick him up, drop him, and pick him up again. The expansion Charlotte Bobcats gave him the biggest opportunity of his career in 2004-05 as they picked him up and used him as a platoon starter. After that season it was back to the bench and the struggle when Hart was traded to the Kings before the 2005-06 season.\n\nPost Kings Career\n\nAfter being waived by the Kings Hart resumed his journeyman career. The Clippers would give him a few more months of low level starter work for the remainder of the 2006-07 season, but from that point on he would play for 5 teams in the final three years of his career in smaller and smaller roles.\n\nPost NBA Career\n\nAfter his playing days were over, Hart has begun a college coaching career, starting out as a high school coach, then catching on as an assistant at Pepperdine, and most recently, USC.\n\nStatistics With the Kings\n\n2005-06: 66gms 0GS 12.4min 3.3pts (.389 .290 .661) 1.1reb 1.1ast 0.5stl 0.1blk 0.7TO 1.3FL\n\n2006-07: 13gms 0GS 7.7min 3.3pts (.500 .500 .909) 1.2reb 0.8ast 0.2stl 0.0blk 0.3TO 1.8FL\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTOTALS: 79gms 0GS 11.6min 3.3pts (.402 .324 .701) 1.1reb 1.0ast 0.4stl 0.1blk 0.6TO 1.4FL\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Hart_(basketball)\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hartja01.html"
