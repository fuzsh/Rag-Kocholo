        "text": "Truly meaningful NBA games are hard to come by in November, but the Mavericks on Wednesday had one of those rare nights that can define a season, or at least a month.\n\nIn one of those games that if you were there, you won’t soon forget it, Monta Ellis matched Dwight Howard blow for blow, then relied on his passing ability to find Shawn Marion for two ultra-critical buckets to power the Mavericks to a 123-120 victory over the Houston Rockets at American Airlines Center.\n\nIt was a finish that was nothing short of mesmerizing and kept the Mavericks undefeated at AAC (6-0). It also proved that they can handle a team that had them on the ropes all night and is regarded as a legitimate championship contender.\n\n“I know we got a tough-minded team,” coach Rick Carlisle said. “We cut it to three and then they went on a run. It would have been easy to drop our heads and stop playing, but these guys aren’t going to do that.\n\n“It had to be a very entertaining game to watch.”\n\nNo kidding. Multiple players threw down big efforts and gigantic numbers. Ellis was a beast with 37 points, but it was the last two of his eight assists that secured the victory.\n\nThe Mavericks trailed by as many as 18 points, rallied and finally found themselves themselves within 119-118 with 1:20 to go when Ellis fed Shawn Marion on the break for a dunk. After Harden missed, Ellis again found Marion, this time in the left corner for a 3-ball that was perfect for a 121-119 Mavericks lead.\n\n“They were smart basketball plays,” Ellis said. “Even my pass to Trix (Marion) on the break. It was an easy basketball play. And on the last one when I was going to the basket and hit Trix in the corner, it was another easy basketball play. Coach always tells me when I attack to look for the guy in the corner. Usually it’s Jose (Calderon).”\n\nSpeaking of Calderon, he had seven fourth-quarter points, including the two free throws with 6.7 seconds left that gave the Mavericks some breathing room.\n\nJames Harden, who had 23 points for the Rockets, missed the second of two free throws with 9 seconds left, leaving the Mavericks ahead by one. On the following inbounds play, Vince Carter got the ball to Calderon.\n\n“I’m not going to miss those,” Calderon said of the free throws. “I wasn’t having one of my best games, but at the end when Rick called my name, I was ready.\n\n“I wanted the ball. Vince got me the ball and I was like, ‘foul me.’ I felt like they were in, for sure.”\n\nThat meant the Rockets needed a 3-pointer to tie, which Harden missed. Patrick Beverley got the rebound, but couldn’t get another try off as the buzzer sounded, the Rockets griped about a foul and the Mavericks did a celebratory dance off the court.\n\nAll this on a night when Dirk Nowitzki eased past Reggie Miller for 14 place on the NBA’s all-time scoring list.\n\nNowitzki had 35 points in support of Ellis. They became the first set of Mavericks to score 35 or more points since Jamal Mashburn and Jason Kidd did it in 1995, oddly enough against Houston in a double-overtime Dallas win.\n\n“Dirk and Ellis were great all night,” coach Rick Carlisle said. “Both guys were attacking, they were playing well off each other and were getting other people the ball.”\n\nAnd so, the Mavericks were able to win their third in a row overall and get past the Rockets in the Southwest Division standings. They also avenged their loss in Houston in the second game of the season.\n\nAbout the only downer was the fact that the Mavericks never got a handle on the Rockets defensively. Howard was a monster, scoring 33 points to go with 11 rebounds. He made his first 11 shots from the field.\n\n“This was a pillow fight defensively all night long,” coach Rick Carlisle said. “This is not going to be anybody's blueprint for how to stop anybody.”\n\nPerhaps not. And Howard showed everybody in the house why the Mavericks pursued him so hotly in free agency during the summer.\n\nHe ended up on the south end of Interstate 45 and used his first visit to AAC as a Rocket to remind fans and the Mavericks just what they missed out on. He even made his free throws when the Mavericks fouled him intentionally.\n\nBut every time, Ellis had a response, which was good enough for the Mavericks who were more than happy to pocket the victory and not worry about Howard’s exploits."
