        "text": "BEIJING — Yao Ming married his long-term girlfriend Monday at a swanky hotel in his hometown of Shanghai.\n\nYao, the Houston Rockets' star center, tied the knot with Ye Li, a 6-foot-2 player on the Chinese women's basketball team, in a ceremony at the Shangri-La Hotel, sina.com reported.\n\nAbout 70 friends and relatives attended the ceremony and banquet.\n\nAround 100 reporters staked out the riverside hotel's lobby, but Yao sent a message that he would give no interviews. However, reporters received a compact disc of studio wedding photos, along with celebratory candy, the Web site said.\n\nYao told Houston television station KRIV in an interview the station agreed to hold until Monday that he was slightly scared about the prospect of marriage and was in awe of it.\n\n\"I don't how the U.S. culture thinks about marriage, but in China we know each other from 18-19 years old, maybe not too late in U.S. But it's pretty early in China,\" he said.\n\n\"The first couple of years, we both don't let parents know. I have a lot of fun times. After so many years we have so many good memories together, we think this is the time right now. We can stay together forever and build a new family.\"\n\nThe 7-foot-6 Yao said he would keep his feelings about his bride to himself.\n\nKNICK CHARGED: New York Knicks center Randolph Morris was arrested early Tuesday and charged with reckless driving.\n\nMorris, who was released from jail on $100 bond, didn't appear in court Tuesday for his arraignment. Attorney Chad Butcher entered a not-guilty plea on his behalf. The judge set a preliminary hearing for Aug. 31.\n\nAccording to the arrest report, Morris smelled of alcohol and had bloodshot eyes. He acknowledged he had been drinking 30 minutes earlier and was given a preliminary breath test at the scene, with his blood alcohol level showing .069, below Kentucky's legal limit of .08.\n\nPolice say Morris took a wide turn onto New Circle Road, just a few miles from the University of Kentucky campus where he played his college basketball. The officer reported Morris accelerated to 62 mph — 17 mph over the speed limit — and didn't use a turn signal as he sped down the exit ramp.\n\nKINGS KEEP WILLIAMS: Center Justin Williams accepted a qualifying offer from the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday.\n\nThe 6-foot-10 Williams averaged 5 points and 4.4 rebounds in 26 games with the Kings last season as an undrafted rookie from Wyoming, impressing fans with his hustle and shot-blocking ability. He was among the Kings' final cuts in training camp, playing a stint in the NBA Development League before returning to Sacramento in January.\n\nDALEMBERT NOW CANADIAN: Philadelphia 76ers center Samuel Dalembert was sworn in as a Canadian citizen on Tuesday, clearing the way for him to join the Canadian national team.\n\nThe 6-foot-11 Dalembert, who averaged 10.7 points and 8.9 rebounds for the Sixers last season, moved to Canada as a teenager. He won a Quebec High School championship and played on Quebec's provincial basketball team.\n\nDalembert, who lived in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, until his early teens, still has family in the Montreal area.\n\n\"I wanted to join the Canadian team in 2003 but had a surgery and was out for their season and so it didn't work out,\" Dalembert said. \"But in the back of my mind I knew I always wanted to play for Canada, and this time it worked out and just seemed to fit. To have the chance to play in the Olympics is really something special.\"\n\nALSTON ARRESTED: Rockets guard Rafer Alston said Monday he was innocent of misdemeanor assault and public intoxication charges filed against him a day earlier.\n\nAlston was accused of grabbing a parking attendant's arm, shaking him and spitting on him after Alston's vehicle was towed from a lot early Sunday. The attendant said Alston parked illegally and did not pay.\n\nAlston told Houston television station KRIV that he didn't do anything to the attendant."
