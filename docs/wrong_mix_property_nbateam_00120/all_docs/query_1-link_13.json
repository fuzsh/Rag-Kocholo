        "text": "And Here Comes the Drama in the Cutié Marriage\n\nMiami Herald\n\nJune 19, 2009\n\nhttp://www.miamiherald.com/358/story/1104305.html\n\nNow that ex-priest Alberto Cutié is a married man, a honeymoon should be in the making for him and his bride Ruhama Buni Canellis.\n\nInstead, the couple will battle in court with the bride's ex-boyfriend, who says they owe him $15,000 and that the newlyweds conspired with Biscayne Park cops to kick him out of the picture.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, Maxi Paulus Ratunuman, 44, says Biscayne Park police arrested him without cause on June 6 while he was installing floor tiles in a customer's house on Griffing Boulevard.\n\nRatunuman says Canellis and he lived together in Biscayne Park for three years, and that he helped raise her son and paid her mortgage before he caught her cheating with Cutié.\n\nCanellis, a Miami Beach resident, bought a two-bedroom house at 10951 NE Third Ave., near\n\nBiscayne Park, in 2003\n\nand sold it in 2007 for $180,000.\n\nRobert J. Fiore, a Miami attorney representing Cutié and Canellis, said in an e-mail\n\nThursday that\n\nRatunuman's allegations are \"absurd\" and the suit is \"baseless and completely without merit.\"\n\nRecords show Biscayne Park police officer Antonio Sanchez, named in the suit with officer Raimundo Atesiano, arrested Ratunuman on trespassing charges.\n\nRatunuman's attorneys at Fort Lauderdale law office Goldman and Hellman did not return a phone call Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, Ratunuman sits in the Metro West Detention Center on an immigration charge, awaiting a July 15 trial. He also faces charges of driving with an expired license.\n\nA source says Cutié and Canellis are preparing for a formal Episcopal church wedding and then, yes, perhaps that honeymoon.\n\nJAWEED KALEEM\n\nSome NBA stars come to Miami and hit South Beach. But for Haiti-born Samuel Dalembert of the Philadelphia 76ers, the party is all about konpa music in Miami. The center was spotted at 90 Degrees in downtown Miami, where Haitian konpa star Sweet Micky helped T-Vice singer Roberto Martino celebrate his birthday. Prodded onto the stage by Sweet Micky, Dalembert told the crowd that his grandmother used to beat him for listening to the artist's suggestive lyrics.\n\nJACQUELINE CHARLES"
