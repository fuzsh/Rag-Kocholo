However, for a real rarity, try this on for size: A player getting 20 points and 20 rebounds in an NBA game, only to have his team lose. And now for the kicker: The guy with the 20-20 is Sam Dalembert. You might not want to look directly at it. You might go blind. Dalembert registered the eighth 20-plus-point, 20-plus-rebound game in the NBA Tuesday night when the 76ers somehow managed to spoil that performance by squandering an 18-point, second-half lead against the Wizards. Orlando center Dwight Howard has three of the other seven 20-20 performances this season, and none of them came in a loss. “That,” Dalembert said Wednesday after practice at PCOM, “is tough to swallow.” Since the Sixers (10-24) have been so maddeningly adept a blowing big leads late in games, Dalembert’s return to respectability at center has been lost in the misery. Of course, his resurgence is due in large part to the rediscovery of a 6-foot security blanket. The Sixers have won four of the 10 games in which Allen Iverson has played since his return to Philly, and while Iverson had his worst performance of the bunch in the 104-97 loss to Washington, the most obvious change that the veteran guard has brought is this: He makes Dalembert a better player. In the 10 games with Iverson, Dalembert has averaged 9.4 points and 11 rebounds. In 24 games without Iverson, Dalembert averaged 5.9 points and 7.5 rebounds. “Since Allen has been here, Sam has been playing well,” Andre Iguodala said. “He’s been focused in, and they have a really good relationship. Sam responds well to Allen, whether’s it good or bad criticism.” It is a strange dynamic, considering the biography of Iverson’s career isn’t going to contain a chapter that speaks glowingly about what a terrific teammate he was. Yet, for whatever reason, Iverson’s tough love doesn’t bruise Dalembert’s ego. “I always tell him, ‘Shoot as many jumpers as you want; I’ll get the rebound for you,'” Dalembert said of Iverson. “He makes me better offensively and gets me involved so much more on the other side of the court, so I just feel that sometimes he gets mad at me because he expects that. I told him that I haven’t been used to that since he left.” The irony about Iverson’s ability to bring out the best in Dalembert is that it could create a situation where a playoff-bound team desperate for a center who can offer defensive resistance against the league’s elite centers — Houston, Phoenix, San Antonio and Atlanta all fit that bill — could decide that Dalembert’s contract has wound down far enough to make him a palatable option at the trade deadline. It also helps that each of those teams have point guards (Aaron Brooks, Steve Nash, Anthony Park and Mike Bibby) with the skills and smarts to decipher what Iverson does to maximize Dalembert’s abilities. Dalembert would make $14 million next season in the final year of his contract if he’s traded (thanks to a 15 percent salary kicker). Ironically, after spending much of last year grousing about feeling unwanted in Philly and hinting about wanting a trade, Dalembert is less restless personally. However, if he has another 20-20 performance, he’d prefer it come in a win. He’s one of seven players (Howard, Al Jefferson, Chris Kaman, Brad Miller, Emeka Okafor and Amare Stoudemire) to have multiple 20-point, 20-rebound performances over the last three seasons, yet he’s the only one of those players who hasn’t had a chance to celebrate a victory after that effort. “It’s crazy. Next time, if I get to 19 (points),” Dalembert said. “I’m going to kick the ball out.”\n\nOriginally Published: January 7, 2010 at 2:14 a.m."
