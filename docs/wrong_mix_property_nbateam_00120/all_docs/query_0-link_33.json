Vote below and help decide the greatest Sacramento Kings center of all time!\n\nBirthplace : Mobile, Alabama\n\nNationality : American\n\nTeam : Los Angeles Clippers\n\nPosition : Center\n\nSacramento Kings: 2010–2017\n\nAcquired by the Sacramento Kings in the 2010 NBA Draft, DeMarcus Cousins quickly became one of the league's most dominant centers. Known for his aggressive style of play and incredible ability to score both inside and outside the arc, Cousins was a force to be reckoned with during his time with the Kings. The four-time All-Star was not only a scoring threat but also an impressive rebounder, constantly putting up double-doubles throughout his tenure with the team. Although he never won a championship with Sacramento, Cousins' impact on the squad cannot be understated.\n\nBirthplace : Prijepolje, Serbia\n\nNationality : Serbian\n\nTeam : Sacramento Kings, Charlotte Hornets, Los Angeles Lakers\n\nPosition : Center\n\nSacramento Kings: 1998–2004\n\nHaving been drafted in 1989, Vlade Divac quickly established himself as one of the most versatile centers in the league during his seven seasons with the Sacramento Kings. Known for his exceptional passing skills and ability to stretch the floor, he was integral in transforming the Kings into playoff contenders. Apart from his offensive prowess, Divac was also a pesky defender, averaging 1.7 blocks per game throughout his career. The two-time Olympic silver medalist and FIBA Hall of Fame inductee certainly left an indelible mark on the franchise.\n\nBirthplace : Kaunas, Lithuania\n\nNationality : Lithuania\n\nTeam : Sacramento Kings\n\nPosition : Power forward\n\nSacramento Kings: 2022-ongoing\n\nHolding court as one of the best centers for the Sacramento Kings, Domantas Sabonis commands attention with a winning blend of size, strength, and skill. With his towering stature and physicality, Sabonis is a rebounding machine, tirelessly securing the ball for his team and effortlessly outmuscling opponents in the paint. Even more compelling is his offensive skillset; he's an absolute dynamo, boasting a diverse range of scoring options that include powerful dunks, soft hook shots, and even an adept mid-range game – truly a centerpiece in the Kings' offense.\n\nDomantas Sabonis (born May 3, 1996) is a Lithuanian professional basketball player for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He previously played in Spain for Unicaja Málaga's junior and senior teams before playing two seasons of college basketball for Gonzaga. He is the son of the Basketball Hall of Famer Arvydas Sabonis, and was born in Portland, while his father was playing for the Portland Trail Blazers. On September 26, 2018, the Pacers picked up the team option on Sabonis' contract. On October 31, he was 12-for-12 shooting while matching his career high with 30 points in a 107–101 win over the New York Knicks. On November 19, he had 19 points, nine rebounds and a career-high nine assists in a 121–94 win over the Utah Jazz. In December 2018, he was chosen as the Lithuanian Player of the Year by the Lithuanian Basketball Federation.\n\nBirthplace : Kendallville, Wayne Township, Indiana\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Chicago Bulls, Minnesota Timberwolves, Sacramento Kings, Indiana Pacers, Houston Rockets\n\nPosition : Center\n\nSacramento Kings: 2003–2009\n\nTraded to the Kings in 2003, Brad Miller was known for his grit and tenacity on the court. His physical style of play allowed him to be a solid rebounder and tough defender, making a name for himself as one of the NBA's best centers during his time in Sacramento. With two All-Star appearances under his belt while playing with the Kings, Miller provided a strong presence in both the post and from long-range. Though he never captured an individual award during his tenure with the team, his contributions were undoubtedly crucial to the franchise's success.\n\nBirthplace : Middletown, Ohio\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : New York Knicks, Sacramento Kings, San Francisco Warriors, Cincinnati Royals\n\nPosition : Power forward\n\nSacramento Kings: 1963–1970\n\nJerry Lucas made a significant impact on the Sacramento Kings during his tenure with the team, after being acquired in a trade in 1971. Known for his incredible rebounding ability and deft shooting touch, Lucas was a dual-threat that helped lead the Kings to success. The six-time All-Star and NBA 50 Greatest Players honoree not only excelled on the court but also off it, earning the NBA's Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award in 1971 for his philanthropic efforts. With a Hall of Fame career under his belt, Lucas undoubtedly stands as one of the best centers in Kings' history.\n\nBirthplace : Boynton Beach, Florida\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Power forward, Center\n\nSacramento Kings: 1984–1988, 1997–1998\n\nOtis Thorpe joined the Sacramento Kings via trade in 1997, bringing with him an enforcer mentality that helped solidify the team's interior defense. His imposing presence in the paint made it difficult for opponents to score, while his ability to contribute offensively was equally important. Although his time with the Kings was relatively short, Thorpe consistently showcased grit and determination that endeared him to fans and teammates alike. While he did not win any major awards during his tenure with Sacramento, his impact on the team's success is certainly worthy of recognition."
