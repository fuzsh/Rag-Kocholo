        "text": "DeMarcus Cousins had 27 points and 10 rebounds, Omri Casspi added 20 points and the visiting Sacramento Kings snapped an eight-game losing streak to the Los Angeles Lakers with a stunning 100-95 victory over the two-time defending champions on Friday night.\n\nKobe Bryant passed Hakeem Olajuwon for eighth place on the NBA’s career scoring list while scoring 21 of his 38 points in the first quarter, but the Lakers apparently got caught looking ahead to Sunday’s NBA finals rematch with Boston.\n\nSamuel Dalembert scored 18 points as the Kings (11-33) jumped to a 20-point lead in the third quarter against the Lakers’ disinterested defense.\n\nThe Kings earned their third impressive road win in the past three weeks. Sacramento also won at New York and Portland before posting its first road victory over the Lakers since March 2008.\n\nHeat 88, Pistons 87 : Eddie House hit two deciding free throws with 6.5 seconds left, LeBron James led all scorers with 39 points and Miami rallied late to beat Detroit. James finished with nine assists and eight rebounds for the Heat, which played without Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade.\n\nNuggets 117, Cavaliers 103: Carmelo Anthony scored 33 points, Arron Afflalo added 23, and visiting Denver avoided any embarrassment by handing pathetic Cleveland its team record-tying 19th straight loss. The Cavs are now just five losses away from breaking the NBA record of 23 consecutive defeats in one season.\n\nThunder 124, Wizards 117: Kevin Durant scored 10 of his 40 points in the second overtime, Russell Westbrook added his third triple-double of the season, and Oklahoma City kept Washington winless on the road. Washington fell to 0-22 on the road.\n\nHawks 111, Knicks 102: Joe Johnson scored 34 points and host Atlanta turned back New York’s late comeback. Forward Marvin Williams made his first start since Dec. 29, but he may soon face an NBA suspension. With 43.7 seconds remaining, Williams pushed New York’s Shawne Williams in the back, starting a brief altercation, and appeared to throw a punch.\n\nBulls 99, Magic 90: Derrick Rose scored 22 points despite two painful stomach ulcers, Luol Deng added 26, and host Chicago beat Orlando.\n\nJazz 108, Timberwolves 100: Paul Millsap scored 30 points, Earl Watson had a season-high 13 assists in place of injured Deron Williams, and Utah beat visiting Minnesota to halt a six-game losing streak. Andrei Kirilenko added a season-high 27 points and had a key steal in the final minute for the Jazz.\n\nThe Timberwolves fell to 10-36 and have lost six straight despite Kevin Love’s 32nd consecutive double-double. He had 22 points and 15 rebounds. The Jazz was without leading scorer Williams for the first time this season because of a hyperextended right wrist.\n\nSuns 88, Celtics 71: Marcin Gortat had career highs of 19 points and 17 rebounds, Vince Carter added 17 points, and host Phoenix ran over Boston. Kevin Garnett had 18 points and nine rebounds but was ejected in the fourth quarter after a below-the-belt shot on Channing Frye."
