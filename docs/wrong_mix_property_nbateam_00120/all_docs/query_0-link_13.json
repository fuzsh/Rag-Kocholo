        "text": "PHILADELPHIA — Everywhere Philadelphia 76ers center Samuel Dalembert looked, he saw pain he can`t forget.\n\nThe NBA`s only Haitian-born player arrived in his home country Tuesday with former NBA star Alonzo Mourning as part of Project MediShare. He watched a leg amputation and people having operations on flimsy kitchen tables. Flies and filth were everywhere.\n\nMostly, he`ll remember the children, many recently orphaned, with desperate looks on their faces. The 6-foot-11, 250-pound Dalembert wept.\n\n“I tried to be strong,” said Dalembert, who returned to Philadelphia for Thursday`s 98-90 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. “But that was enough for me. There are a lot of homeless children looking for families, and the situation is so critical there. So many people lost everything. I know people are doing their best to help, but it`s crazy over there.”\n\nThough he planned to leave Thursday morning, air traffic issues forced him to push the return trip to 1 a.m. Wednesday, when he flew out on a cargo plane. Hours later, a massive aftershock shook the island. Arriving in Miami at 4 a.m., his father phoned a few hours later with the news and to tell him he was OK.\n\nDalembert has a brother, sister and grandmother, all of whom have left the island and are in Miami. His father is staying.\n\n“He`s going to do whatever he can to help down there,” Dalembert said. “We need to work together to make this thing happen. I do my best. I can try and raise as much money as possible and make sure it`s going to the right place.”\n\nWorking on almost no sleep, Dalembert arrived at the Wachovia Center 15 minutes before the game, joining his teammates for the final minute of warm-ups. He had 10 points and 15 rebounds before fouling out with 1:18 left.\n\n“He`s a great person. He`s a doing a lot for his country and a lot for his teammates,” teammate Allen Iverson said. “He`s got a lot on his shoulders, but he`s carrying the load. We all feel for what he`s going through.”\n\nDalembert is not sure when he may sleep well again, something he hasn`t done since the quake struck on Jan. 12. He won`t stop helping until he feels there`s nothing more he can do. He`s already donated more than $130,000, and said he plans to donate $250,000.\n\nHe urged others to donate.\n\n“I know I`m not going to save the whole country, but I know deep inside that we need to do more,” he said. “Maybe we can save some lives, and make others just a little bit better.\n\n“There`s no recovery room (after surgery), forget about that. You hear screaming. They`re numbing people down. There`s not enough alcohol. There`s glass (from broken windows) everywhere. People haven`t had water for days. The people there are so strong. I salute them all. God is watching over us, and will help us get through this.”"
