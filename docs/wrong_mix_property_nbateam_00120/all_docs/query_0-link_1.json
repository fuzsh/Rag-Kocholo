        "text": "Haitian-Canadian basketball player\n\nSamuel Davis Dalembert (born May 10, 1981) is a Haitian-Canadian former professional basketball player who played 13 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for Seton Hall University. During his active NBA career, Dalembert was known for his rebounding as well as his shot blocking ability.\n\nDalembert was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti and lived there for fourteen years before moving to Montreal, where he attended Lucien-Pagé (High School). He also attended St. Patrick High School in Elizabeth, New Jersey. He then went on to play college basketball at Seton Hall from 1999 to 2001.\n\nDalembert was selected with the 26th overall pick by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2001 NBA draft. After playing 8 seasons with the 76ers, he was traded to the Sacramento Kings for Andrés Nocioni and Spencer Hawes on June 17, 2010.[1]\n\nOn December 26, 2011, he signed a multi-year deal with the Houston Rockets.[2]\n\nOn June 27, 2012, Dalembert was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, along with John Henson, the 14th pick in the 2012 NBA draft, for Jon Brockman, Jon Leuer, Shaun Livingston, and Jeremy Lamb, the 12th pick in the 2012 NBA draft.[3]\n\nOn July 19, 2013, Dalembert signed with the Dallas Mavericks.[4]\n\nOn June 25, 2014, Dalembert, along with Shane Larkin, Wayne Ellington, José Calderón and two 2014 second-round picks, was traded to the New York Knicks in exchange for Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton.[5] On January 5, 2015, he was waived by the Knicks.[6]\n\nDalembert's final NBA game was played on December 27, 2014, in a 129–135 loss to the Sacramento Kings. In his final game, Dalembert recorded 11 points, 4 rebounds and 4 blocks.\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Dalembert signed with the Dallas Mavericks, returning to the franchise for a second stint.[7] However, he was later waived by the Mavericks on October 24 prior to the start of the regular season. He appeared in four preseason games for the team, but a left leg injury forced him to miss the final three games of the preseason schedule.[8] On December 17, 2015, he signed with Shanxi Zhongyu of the Chinese Basketball Association.[9] He returned to Shanxi for the 2016–17 season.\n\nAfter much anticipation, Dalembert became a Canadian citizen on August 7, 2007, and joined the Canadian national team in hopes of qualifying for the Olympics.[10] He made his national team debut during the 2007 FIBA Americas Championship, leading the tournament with 2.4 blocks per game.[11] He also participated in Canada's pre-Olympic qualifying training camp, taking part in games in both Toronto and Hamilton during the 2008 Jack Donohue International Classic, with wins over both Lebanon and New Zealand. However, Dalembert was later dismissed from the team during the World Olympic Qualifying Tournament due to a rift between him and coach Leo Rautins.[12]\n\nDalembert decided to travel to Haiti to help with relief efforts following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He also pledged $100,000 to UNICEF.[13]\n\nHe won the 2009–10 J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award for his contributions to Haitian people after the earthquake.[14] Since the disaster, Dalembert has continued to be involved in the Haitian recovery.\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high * Led the league\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2001–02 Philadelphia 34 0 5.2 .440 – .389 2.0 .1 .2 .4 1.5 2003–04 Philadelphia 82 53 26.8 .541 .000 .644 7.6 .3 .5 2.3 8.0 2004–05 Philadelphia 72 60 24.8 .524 – .601 7.5 .5 .6 1.7 8.2 2005–06 Philadelphia 66 52 26.7 .531 .000 .705 8.2 .4 .5 2.4 7.3 2006–07 Philadelphia 82* 82* 30.9 .541 .000 .746 8.9 .8 .6 1.9 10.7 2007–08 Philadelphia 82* 82* 33.2 .513 .000 .707 10.4 .5 .5 2.3 10.5 2008–09 Philadelphia 82* 82* 24.8 .498 .000 .734 8.5 .2 .4 1.8 6.4 2009–10 Philadelphia 82* 80 25.9 .545 – .729 9.6 .8 .5 1.8 8.1 2010–11 Sacramento 80 46 24.2 .473 .000 .730 8.2 .8 .5 1.5 8.1 2011–12 Houston 65 45 22.2 .506 .000 .796 7.0 .5 .6 1.7 7.5 2012–13 Milwaukee 47 23 16.3 .542 1.000 .691 5.9 .4 .4 1.1 6.7 2013–14 Dallas 80 68 20.2 .568 .000 .737 6.8 .5 .5 1.2 6.6 2014–15 New York 32 21 17.0 .438 – .700 5.3 .9 .4 1.3 4.0 Career 886 694 24.4 .521 .083 .706 7.8 .5 .5 1.7 7.7\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2005 Philadelphia 5 5 38.4 .553 – .400 12.8 .4 .4 1.4 11.6 2008 Philadelphia 6 6 32.2 .422 – .842 9.5 .5 .3 1.7 9.0 2009 Philadelphia 6 6 22.2 .615 – .750 7.8 .5 .3 1.5 5.8 2013 Milwaukee 1 0 9.0 .000 – .250 3.0 .0 1.0 .0 1.0 2014 Dallas 7 7 19.3 .458 – .667 8.4 .0 .3 1.4 4.6 Career 25 24 26.5 .503 – .632 9.2 .3 .4 1.4 7.2\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1999–00 Seton Hall 30 21 21.4 .503 – .518 6.0 0.3 0.3 3.6 6.0 2000–01 Seton Hall 29 27 21.4 .565 – .556 5.7 0.3 0.5 2.1 8.3 Career 59 48 21.4 .537 – .539 5.8 0.3 0.4 2.8 7.1\n\nList of National Basketball Association career blocks leaders\n\nList of Canadians in the National Basketball Association"
