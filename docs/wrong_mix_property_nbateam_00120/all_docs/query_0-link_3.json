        "text": "BOCA RATON, Fla. — Former Knicks center Samuel Dalembert is facing battery charges after authorities say he hit his girlfriend and her cousin.\n\nA Boca Raton police report says police responded to Dalembert’s home Sunday evening after a 911 hang-up. The woman and her cousin initially told officers nothing was wrong, but eventually said the 7-foot, 270-pound Dalembert became upset after finding out that his girlfriend was leaving for Orlando with their two children.\n\nThe cousin told police Dalembert pushed the girlfriend down and then choked the cousin when he tried to intervene. Dalembert was arrested on two counts of battery and released from jail.\n\nDalembert was part of the infamous June 2014 trade between the Knicks and Mavericks, in which the Knicks sent Tyson Chandler and Raymond Felton packing. In return, they received Dalembert, Jose Calderon, Shane Larkin, Wayne Ellington and two second-round draft picks.\n\nThe new-look Knicks failed immediately, and Dalembert was released amid their January 2015 fire sale.\n\nIn addition to the Knicks, Dalembert played with the Philadelphia 76ers, Sacramento Kings, Houston Rockets, Milwaukee Bucks and Dallas Mavericks during a 13-year NBA career."
