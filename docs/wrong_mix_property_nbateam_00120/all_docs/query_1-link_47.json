        "text": "What was New France’s society like? Did it reflect French society under the Ancien Régime? Or was it different? If so, why was it not identical to the society from which it originated? In this article on social groups, Arnaud Bessière answers these questions and many others.\n\nThe author paints a portrait of the colony’s population at different points in time and covers each social category: seigneurs, merchants, artisans, peasants and servants. He reminds us of their importance and examines their way of life, duties and responsibilities. We discover that there were significant disparities within each social category, as was the case in France. For example, some of the seigneurs tried to reproduce seigneurial practices found in France, while others barely survived on their lands. As for the merchants, some made great fortunes, while the majority scraped a living from small businesses.\n\nArnaud Bessière’s article offers insight into the hierarchical structure of New France’s society and of the various social groups. It highlights the way a new society — distinct from that of France — progressively took shape.\n\nThe Seigneurs (show)\n\nMiddle-Class Merchants and Traders (show)\n\nShopkeepers and Tradespeople (show)\n\nThe Habitants (show)\n\nEngagés and Servants (show)"
