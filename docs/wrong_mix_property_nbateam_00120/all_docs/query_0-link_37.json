        "text": "SACRAMENTO — There was Vladimir Radmanovic’s buzzer-beating 3-pointer in December, sending the game into overtime. The Warriors, after trailing by 16 in the fourth quarter, pulled out the victory.\n\nThere was Baron Davis’ 25 points and five steals on his birthday in April 2007. The victory was part of the late-season run that sneaked the Warriors into the playoffs, setting up “We Believe” mania.\n\nThere was the double-overtime 148-136 win in March 1992, when Chris Mullin (34 points) outdueled old friend Mitch Richmond (33 points).\n\nWarriors fans had better savor their memories at Arco Arena, because Golden State likely won’t be creating any new ones. Certainly, the current squad didn’t create any good ones Monday night, losing to the Sacramento Kings 129-119 in what is now called Power Balance Pavilion.\n\nThe blowout loss, in which the Warriors trailed by as much as 23 points, could very well be Golden State’s last in Sacramento. For those familiar with the rivalry, its possible end is perhaps worthy of a tear.\n\n“We like coming down here,” Monta Ellis said after his 15-point, nine-assist game. “Walking in the arena and we’ve got just as many fans as they have here. … The competitive nature of it, only being right down the road. The competition, the excitement, you’re definitely going to miss that.”\n\nThe Warriors had little fun Monday as they had their two-game winning streak snapped by the worst team in the Western Conference. On top of that, the Kings were without their best player, guard Tyreke Evans (plantar fasciitis).\n\nThat’s possibly how the Warriors signed off on their rivalry with Sacramento. By allowing Kings center Samuel Dalembert to set a career-high with 27 points to go with 16 rebounds. By allowing guard Marcus Thornton to drop a career-high 42, the first Warriors foe to go 40 or better against them since Kevin Durant did it last season.\n\nThe Kings were obviously up for the game, a winnable affair against an area rival. But that rivalry is expected to become history soon.\n\nThe expectation is the Kings are headed to Anaheim, where they will co-occupy the Honda Center with the NHL’s Ducks. Even Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson, after meeting with Kings owners Joe and Gavin Maloof earlier this month, said the franchise was more likely to move to Anaheim than stay in Sacramento.\n\nThe Kings have an April 19 deadline to apply for a franchise move. According to the Los Angeles Times, the Maloofs were granted an extension by the NBA board of governors on their relocation application so they could present their options in a league meeting in mid-April.\n\nFor years, the Maloofs have been looking for an upgrade over rundown, 17,000-seat Arco Arena. But unwilling to finance their own arena, and with the city refusing to foot the bill, it has become increasingly obvious over the years the Kings’ days in Sacramento were numbered. With the opportunity to play in the Pond, a move could come as soon as next season.\n\nUndoubtedly, the rest of the league won’t miss the rivalry, as neither team has been a real contender since the Kings’ Chris Webber-Vlade Divac years in the early 2000s.\n\n“The problem is they were never good at the same time,” said Warriors radio broadcaster Tim Roye, who spent six years with the Kings before working the last 16 with the Warriors. “Always one team was significantly better than the other. … I always thought it would be so cool for the league and the franchises themselves if they could’ve gotten into a playoffs together.”\n\nNever happened. But that hasn’t always hurt their matchups. Even when both teams were struggling, the chance to get a win seemed to add intensity to the rivalry.\n\nSuch was the case Monday night."
