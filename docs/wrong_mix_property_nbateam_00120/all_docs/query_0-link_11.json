        "text": "He went and paid a visit last month to a malnutrition center in Haiti that's still rebuilding after last year's earthquake, UNICEF reports. Dalembert left Haiti at the age of 13 and has played in the NBA for 10 years. He visited in hopes of creating awareness and laying the groundwork for providing aid.\n\nHe brought with him Nykesha Sales, a six-time WNBA All-Star. The two met with children, their families and staff.\n\nMalnutrition is the number one cause of death among children under five in Haiti and other developing countries, according to UNICEF representative Francoise Gruloos-Ackermans."
