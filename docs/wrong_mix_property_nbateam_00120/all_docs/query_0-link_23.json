        "text": "It wasn’t a matter of if the 76ers were going to trade Samuel Dalembert before his contract expired, but when.\n\nDespite that, there was something rather surprising when the Sixers on Thursday confirmed that the veteran center was shipped to Sacramento for small forward Andres Nocioni and young center Spencer Hawes.\n\n“We are excited to add two players in Spencer Hawes and Andres Nocioni who will help us immediately and provide us with additional front-court depth,” general manager Ed Stefanski said in a statement. “Spencer is a young 7-footer who will provide us with versatility at the center position, while Andres will provide us with a tough veteran presence.”\n\nThe deal came a week before the draft, and for an organization that already was motivated to make some changes by a disastrous 2009-10 season the trade made it crystal clear that the Sixers have more maneuvering in mind.\n\nWhereas the Sixers seemed to be all but assured of using the No. 2 overall pick in the draft to select Ohio State shooting guard Evan Turner — who, coincidentally, was working out for the Sixers literally as the trade was becoming finalized — this trade seemed to create a little intrigue as to what will happen after Kentucky’s John Wall is taken with the first overall selection. Today the Sixers invite a pair of low-post players with one year of college under their belts to work out — Georgia Tech forward/center Derrick Favors, and Kentucky center DeMarcus Cous\n\nins. Although Favors is considered the only true option other than Turner at No. 2, the Sixers are making it clear to other organizations that they are willing to entertain not only the Favors option, but also overtures from teams that would like to move into the top three slots in the draft to grab Turner or Favors.\n\nWhat the trade has done is further crowded the Sixers with ‘tweeners at the shooting guard/small forward positions. Nocioni is a classic long-range shooter who works best as a swingman (although he plays better defense than Jason Kapono). However, between him, Kapono, Andre Iguodala, Thaddeus Young, Willie Green and even smallish shooting guards like Jodie Meeks and Lou Williams, the Sixers have a glut of players who fit in the Nos. 2 and 3 positions — and if you were to throw Turner into that mix, at least one of those players would have to go, and more likely two of them.\n\nThe other option would be for the Sixers to trade back a bit and opt for someone like Cousins, who might have the most raw talent of anyone in this draft, including Wall, although his drive and smarts have come into serious question. There are several teams down the list in the draft who have expressed interest in Favors, who is drawing comparisons to Orlando center Dwight Howard from some. Among those said to be receptive to making a bold move up the ladder to get Favors are the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nAs for Dalembert, he is being welcomed with open arms by the Kings and their G.M., Delaware County native Geoff Petrie. By Wednesday evening the main page on the team’s website had Dalembert pictured in a Kings jersey with “Welcome to Sacramento, Samuel!” emblazoned in large font at the top of the page. Dalembert averaged 8.1 points, 9.5 rebounds and 1.8 blocks and played every game for the Sixers last season, despite the fact that a tragic earthquake rattled his native country of Haiti and killed tens of thousands, prompting him to take the lead in providing humanitarian aid.\n\nDalembert leaves the Sixers second on their career list in blocked shots with 1,131.\n\n“We’re excited about the acquisition of Samuel Dalembert,” said Petrie, a Springfield High product who drafted Chester native and 2009-10 Rookie of the Year Tyreke Evans with the fourth overall pick in last year’s draft. “He will certainly bring a defensive presence and increase our ability to defend around the basket with his rebounding, shot-blocking and athleticism. I think he’ll add a very different look to our team defensively and we’re really excited about having him.”\n\nThe Sixers did get two legitimate NBA players for Dalembert, but there was a cost. Whereas they were one season away from seeing the center’s six-year, $64 million contract conclude, the Sixers inherited the final two seasons of Nocioni’s five-year, $37.5 million deal — and the 30-year-old is coming off his worst season since he was a rookie in 2004-05. Nocioni averaged 8.5 points and three rebounds in 75 games (28 starts) while shooting a career-low 39.9 percent from the floor. There were multiple reports from Sacramento since the Kings acquired him in a 2009 trade-deadline deal that the Argentinian wanted out and had requested a trade.\n\nThe Sixers will find out whether Philadelphia assuages Nocioni’s discontent, or if he still can be the player who averaged 13 points per game in his final 3 1/2 seasons with the Chicago Bulls and raised his visibility by averaging 22.3 points and 8.8 boards for the Bulls in a breakout 2006 playoff performance against the Miami Heat, who went on to win the NBA title.\n\nHawes is the guy who will take the place of Dalembert at center, although the 22-year-old is a far different player than the guy who manned the middle for the Sixers the last seven seasons. Hawes, the 10th overall selection in the 2007 draft after one season at the University of Washington, is the player the Sixers hoped Jason Smith might develop into, but didn’t. While blessed with 7-footer length, Hawes is better offensively away from the hoop and doesn’t have anything close to the defensive tools that Dalembert possesses.\n\nThat said, he was 21 years old all of last season and averaged 10 points, 6.1 boards and 1.2 blocks in 72 games (59 starts). Dawes also has the type of skills at the offensive that seem to mesh better with power forward Elton Brand, who struggled at times to find space on the low-post because of Dalembert’s limited range and effectiveness at that end. Dawes will make a shade less than $3 million next season, and the Sixers will have an option on him for 2011-12 at slightly more than $4 million."
