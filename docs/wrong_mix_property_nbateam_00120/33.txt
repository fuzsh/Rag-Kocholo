BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) Former NBA player Samuel Dalembert is facing battery charges after authorities say he hit his girlfriend and her cousin.

A Boca Raton police report says police responded to Dalembertâ€™s home Sunday evening after a 911 hang-up. The woman and her cousin initially told officers nothing was wrong but eventually said the 7-foot, 270-pound Dalembert became upset after finding out that his girlfriend was leaving for Orlando with their two children.

The cousin told police Dalembert pushed the girlfriend down and then choked the cousin when he tried to intervene. Dalembert was arrested on two counts of battery and released from jail.

Dalembert played with the Philadelphia 76ers, Sacramento Kings, Houston Rockets, Milwaukee Bucks, Dallas Mavericks and New York Knicks during a 13-year NBA career.
