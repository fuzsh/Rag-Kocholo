(93 cds listed, 1046 lines, 28 101 bytes). ================ 3. Introduction ================ This database will be a complete database of every games and demos released for Sega Saturn around the world. I have already collected related informations for more than two years. This is a long work and is still in progress. Each information I provide herein comes from my own experience: I personaly have handled every of these games and demos that are listed in the database. So, you could easily imagine how difficult is to get each of these games and demos releases. Now, I build this database alone but, in the future, I will ask your help for the missing information. Also, as English is not my native tongue, please be kind enough for misspelling I may done. ======================================== 4. Information provided in the database ======================================== For each entry, the following information is provided: a) Title b) Country c) Japanase Title d) Serial Number e) Version f) Internal Date g) Total Tracks h) Data tracks i) Audio Tracks j) Country Code k) Peripheral Code l) Creation Date m) Creation Time n) Modification Date o) Modification Time p) Comments ++++++++++ 4a. Title ++++++++++ The title provided is the real title of the game (or demo) as it appears in the game (or demo), on the covers or on the spincard. For japanese games, in most case the title is written in japanese with Kanas and/or Kanji and in Romaji. I do not use the Romaji \"translation\" (found on the edge) as there is sometimes some mistakes, I translate myself in Romaji the title found on the cover, on the spincard or inside the game. ++++++++++++ 4b. Country ++++++++++++ The country is, in fact, the territory from where the game has been released. Commonly, there are three main areas : Japan, the USA and Europe which are marked respectively as JPN, USA and EUR. USA gathers the USA and Canada (namely the North America territories). EUR gathers countries in Europe and in Oceania. Other countries could be put into these main areas. The \"country\" is determined by the Serial Number. Some european releases are specific to one or several countries, but not for all the european countries. For these games, the information is also provided. (Examples: French only release: EUR FR, German: EUR GER,etc.) Also, CHI is for Chinese releases & KOR for Korean releases. +++++++++++++++++++ 4c. Japanese Title +++++++++++++++++++ For japanese games and demos, I write the title in japanese as it appears on the covers and/or on the spincard. ++++++++++++++++++++++++ 4d. Serial Number (S/N) ++++++++++++++++++++++++ The S/N is the identification number of a game or demo cd. But, unlike some other FAQs, the S/N provided in this database is NOT the one written on the cover, BUT the one found in the header of the cd. Why? Because some games have been released more than one time with different S/N, but in fact, it is exactly the same copy burnt on the cd (so the same S/N is in the header). Example: Angelique Special has been released alone with the S/N T-7615G on the cover and also in a limited edition called Premium Box with the S/N T-7622G on the cover. In fact, it is the same copy on the cds with the S/N T-7615G. It is the same for some games but not for all. If you want a full list of japanese games released with the S/N found on the cover, check out the fabulous work of KinsukeJP \"The List of All Japanese Sega Saturn Game Products\". His FAQ can be easily found at gameFAQs. Now, I explain how the S/N is built. There are four categories : Games released by Sega Games released by a third party Utilities Demos -> Games released by Sega These games have the following types of S/N : GS-XXXX = Games for the japanese market (Asia not PAL market) MK-XXXXX = Games for markets outside Japan, not included european countries MK-XXXXX-XX = Games for the european market (and equivalent) and for specific countries. The last two digits indicate the country: -50 = General, stand for 50 Hz -09 = for French market only -18 = for Germany market only -05 = for U.K. market only -06 = for Spain market only -51 = for Italian market only -45 = for Brazilian market only -10 = for China market only -11 = for Hong Kong market only (games distributed by FREETRON CO.) -16 = for Taiwan market only (games distributed by ACER TWP CORP.) -08 = for Korean market only Other numbers exist for other different countries but I don't know them at the moment. Most of the european games don't have those last two digits in the S/N found in the header of the cd, so most of the S/N I provide for european games (and equivalent) are formatted such as MK-XXXXX. -> Games released by a third party T-XXXXG or T-XXXXXG = Games for the japanese market (Asia not PAL market) T-XXXXH or T-XXXXXH = Games for markets outside Japan, not included european countries T-XXXXH-XX or T-XXXXXH-XX = Games for the european market (and equivalent) and for specific countries. What I have explained for the games released by Sega is also true for the games released by a third party. Chinese Saturn games do not have the rating typo (Green, Yellow, Red) on the front cover, except that, in most case it is the same cover as japanese releases. Korean Saturn games have been released by Samsung instead of Sega. They are known as SamsungSaturn games instead of SegaSaturn games. -> Utilities Some utilities do not have a S/N alone in the header but a S/N followed by text. Example: The european photoCD operating system has \"MK-81681 SEGAVIEWER\" The japanese one has \"HSS-0121 SEGAVIEWER\" where \"HSS-0121\" is another type of S/N (found on all the japanese accessories and hardware packaging). -> Demos The S/N for the demos cd is formatted as 610-XXXX, 610-XXXXY or 610-XXXX-XX If you want extra information about japanese serial numbers (also known as Tags), please check out the \"Japanese Games Tag Reference TOOL\" by CHAZumaru. ++++++++++++ 4e. Version ++++++++++++ The version number is the one found in the header of the cd. Sometimes, a game could have more than one version. This is due to a re-released of this game with the same S/N. In this case, the game has just been updated with small fixes and improvements but there is no modification of the packaging. It is impossible, in most case, to know if there are more than one version of this game except if you look at the header and you already own another copy. Here are some games in this case: Grandia Digital Museum, Soukyu Gurentai, Albert Odyssey: Legend of Eldean USA, etc. ++++++++++++++++++ 4f. Internal date ++++++++++++++++++ It is the date found in the header of the cd. +++++++++++++++++ 4g. Total Tracks +++++++++++++++++ It is the number of tracks for each cd. +++++++++++++++++ 4h. Data Tracks +++++++++++++++++ It is the number of data tracks for each cd. +++++++++++++++++ 4i. Audio Tracks +++++++++++++++++ It is the number of audio tracks for each cd. +++++++++++++++++ 4j. Country Code +++++++++++++++++ It is the country code found in the header of each cd. ++++++++++++++++++++ 4k. Peripheral Code ++++++++++++++++++++ It is the peripheral code found in the header of each cd. ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 4m.-o. Creation Date & Time, Modification Date & Time ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Each CD (not only Saturn cd) contains information about eight type of data : Creation Date & Time, Modification Date & Time, Effective Date & Time and Expiration Date & Time. For Saturn CD, in most case, only the first four data are present. I provide them here. +++++++++++++ 4p. Comments +++++++++++++ Some comments have been added to provide extra information about the games or the demos. Some of my games are still sealed. For these entries, I cannot provide the information found in the header (as I do not want to open them). I fill the comments with the words \"Original Sealed\". For the first release of my database, all the comments are empty. I will put them in a future release. ================ 5. The Database ================ My working database is formatted under a spreadsheet and could be easily converted into Html format. But due to restrictions for posting this work on websites, I have to convert it into plain text format.
