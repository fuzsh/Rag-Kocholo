It's why last time I posited the question to those who cared about whether my next run should be stage-only or gatcha only.\n\nPlaying SRC as much as I have lately makes me think there's some merit to the concept as an actual SRW game, perhaps an alternative to OE's attempt at being a DLC-only SRW, but it would need to be careful about handling it, if only to avoid being thought of as worse.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>13714931\n\n>...I also wonder why even with all the RNG, I can't seem to shake certain series.\n\nI don't think there's any way to conclusively prove RNG shenanigans... but yeah, for my game, I seem to consistently be able to roll Linebarrel amongst other units\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\nDoes the +5 Shot Down skill item work for secrets?\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>13715002\n\nReferring to UX for clarification.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>13715002\n\n>>13715009\n\nNope.

Despite the small movement range, he has Teleport, which doesn't give a shit about terrain, and I've even given him double action skill part.

The latest version came only a day or two ago, adding a few bugfixes and whatnot, and even added the upgrade to stick Marvel in the Dunbine and Luna in the Impulse (provided you've already gotten said machines and upgraded so their normal pilots are removed, anyway).\n\nI wonder if it'll update with new series and units anytime soon, there's still plenty he could put in, like some more Zoids some more modern stuff, Sentai, SD Gundam and other side Gundam materials...Heck, he uses most of the obscure RPGs from back then, why doesn't he let Gilliam's Gespenst become the XN Geist?\n\nHonestly, I'd like to see him put in recruitable versions of villains, too, for the ultimate in dream-team creation, so we can have our teams with Burn and his Zwarth, Master Asia, or even take a leaf from D and use the OVA version of Godmars with Marg in it\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>13714647\n\nits in the OP\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>13715530\n\n>>13715573\n\nDefeated Neo Granzon with Shu in Plus mode extra final stage, still no upgrade available.\n\nMaybe I should do the other way.\n\n>>\n\nMattman324 (ID: !C9UNU3S59A)\n\n[Report]\n\nMattman324 (ID: !C9UNU3S59A) Post No.13715632 [Report]\n\n>>13715611\n\n>should I use the partner system or not\n\nDefinitely, much like L (and BX) the Partner System actually is functional and useful.\n\nAs for the runs, there's a few ways to do it, but the maximum in terms of efficiency is getting all the secrets in four runs, because of a glitch that causes Yllbora to only unlock if you do his route on the first route split on the run you unlock him in (like it was a kill based flag or something.) As far as that goes, there's two routes to my knowledge:\n\n>Route 1: The normal one, would be the 3 route way if Yllbora worked.\n\nRun 1, get Master Therion, the Dunbine/WoR guys, and the Fafner guys.\n\nRun 2, get... uh, pretty much everything else that isn't Yllbora or Brera. This means Will, Karen, Ishigami, Ryofu/Lu Bu and Chousen/Diaochan, Patrick and Andrei, Graham, and Ishigami.\n\nRuns 3/4: Get either Brera or Yllbora, then get the other. Lament that if Yllbora worked right, or if he didn't have his third requirement, you could still do this in three runs.\n\n>Route 2: What I'm doing on my file, the JUSTICE ROUTE.\n\nRun 1: Get Ishigami and Lu Bu FIRST. Michio and Kurusu (Cross? Still haven't gotten a shot at HaE, will get a chance after work later) are still obtainable of the Fafner secrets, but Goubain and Female Aura Battler aren't.\n\nRun 2: Get everything from Run 2 of the first one, as well as everything else from Run 1 of the first one, except Karen.\n\nRun 3/4: See Route 1 for details, add Karen to the third run.\n\n>>\n\nBring Stabity\n\n[Report]\n\nBring Stabity Post No.13715654 [Report]\n\n>>13715632\n\nThanks.

I think all it is is five more Mobility? and Lux in another shitty Wings of Rean grunt on one side, a cosmetic change for Romina on the other side).\n\nOn top of that, excepting the odd Yllbora issue I mentioned, all flags for routes carry over - so, say you go the America route after 13, and then next run you go the Japan route. You're still eligible to get people like Will on that route, the flag for taking that carries over. However, do be warned that if there are actual REQUIREMENTS on that route, it won't work - Master Therion and Lu Bu are BIG on this, but Yllbora, Sakomizu, Karen, and Ishigami all do too. (I think Will doesn't, since his is just \"Heroman needs X kills at the end of this stage\" and you can get those before the split, but I'm not going to automatically assume.)\n\nSkill parts carry over, and you can choose to keep them on the characters they're loaded on OR move them all off so you can reapply them on NG+. (BX does the same thing, and I'm pretty sure both have parts you only ever can get one copy of, so that's a thing too.)\n\nKills apparently go completely fucking insane on NG+ and skyrocket, so no idea on that one. All kill count based things are required to be gotten in the run you get them on - so, if you get Will, Heroman needs to get 200 kills IN THAT RUNTHROUGH - but you can Game Over and any kill you get is retained. For anyone not named Graham Aker, THE SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH is apparently good, for him I have no idea what you do. (He only needs 50, maybe just get him all the kills normally.) If you ever play BX, note that this is reversed.\n\nMoney... fuck if I know, man. It carries over 100% first run on BX, but no idea if UX does the same thing.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>13715660\n\n>>13715662\n\nEh, to save some time, how about I teach you how to edit the file to remove the criteria instead?\n\nOpen up eve/アップグレード.eve in a text editor, backing it up first\n\nFind this huge chunk of text:\n\nCase プラス\n\nIf 設定[シュウ=シラカワP撃墜] > 0 or ネオグラ解禁フラグ = 1 Then\n\nCall UGリスト作成 4 仲間[シュウ=シラカワ(味方)] 1 ネオ・グランゾン 0 ネオ・グランゾン(味方) 1\n\nElse\n\nCall UGリスト作成 4 仲間[シュウ=シラカワ(味方)] 1 ??? 0 ネオ・グランゾン(味方) 1\n\nEndif\n\nChange it to\n\nCase プラス\n\nCall UGリスト作成 4 仲間[シュウ=シラカワ(味方)] 1 ネオ・グランゾン 0 ネオ・グランゾン(味方) 1\n\nSave file, Neo Granzon should be available for upgrade in the final slot (he costs a bomb)\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\nGiven how the Alpha tetralogy's usage of Macross Plus has Guld spared, who gets Myung, him or Isamu?\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>13715721\n\nGuld and Isamu get each other.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report] Image search: [Google]\n\nFile: 2255.png (1 KB, 120x120) Image search: [Google]\n\n1 KB, 120x120\n\n>>13715738\n\nthe only canon ending in SRW\n\n>>\n\nMattphone324\n\n[Report]\n\n>Fever Time in Gunbuster event: totally random, on a timer, spend a lot of money to increase it when it happens\n\n>Fever time in 3G event: \"Here, have a free SR as a login bonus, with another free one if you spend some money (or have saved Omega Crystals) to run the Gatcha.
