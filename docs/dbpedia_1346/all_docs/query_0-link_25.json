It uses the data it gathered to recreate duplicates, be the originals from other dimensionals or the past. And that include LIVING BEINGS. It's not quite cloning since it can't, say, summon a army of Gundam Physalis, since there was only one, and it was piloted by one notable pilot (Gato). The copies can maintain their existence as long as Mother Duplicator is active.\n\nYou do the math.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report] Image search: [Google]\n\nFile: V.png (1MB, 1368x768px) Image search: [Google]\n\n1MB, 1368x768px\n\n>Tatsu Shinguji\n\n>tfw he will become Tasuku's dad once V gets into OG\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>15681889\n\nWould be neat to see them flesh out the Alphas not the Exbeins and RKO users a bit more.\n\n>>\n\nMattman324 (ID: !C9UNU3S59A)\n\n[Report]\n\nMattman324 (ID: !C9UNU3S59A) Post No.15682037 [Report]\n\n>>15681814\n\n>Banpreios\n\n>DaiRaiOh\n\n>Excellence Eternal\n\n>Excellence Lightning\n\n>Shin Ryukooh/Kouryuoh\n\nThose won't be taking up any new deployment slots, also seriously OG has some of the best final deployment slots to final unit count in the series.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>15681857\n\nKind of feel I should note regarding the W Originals.\n\nBut 'The Database' is a Earth coined name for that faction of Originals much like how Feddies called Ze Balmary Empire 'Aerogaters' and Zuvorg Alliance 'Inspectors/Guests'.\n\nThey had a official name they called themselves as such and that some of the other alien factions used too. Nobody in game except the humans used the Database name.\n\nI think it was 'Scribes of Knowledge' or 'Knowledge Recorder' I'm a bit fuzzy since it's been a long time since I played W and I don't remember exactly how it was written, one of those names might've been a theme song name which isn't helping.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>15681814\n\nThe majority of the units that you listed there are straight upgrades for units that we already have or in Banpreios' case, shaves off two deployment slots because we no longer need to deploy R-2 and R-3 individually.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>15681796\n\nSweet as hell (if you get the joke)\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>15682040\n\nYeah I think it was the scribes of knowledge, Knowledge Recorder is just the name of their theme\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAiip6htBp0\n\n>>\n\nAxia Delta (ID: !!SuH5TLtysNd)\n\n[Report] Image search: [Google]\n\nAxia Delta (ID: !!SuH5TLtysNd) Post No.15682461 [Report]\n\nFile: Obscures.png (3MB, 2801x2200px) Image search: [Google]\n\n3MB, 2801x2200px\n\nNow, for a little test.

Answers not on pic. Now, some observations:\n\nGB V: Dunno if a group of cowboys would count as the Battle Force. Anyway, Gardras and Crystal Dragoon have nothing to do with each other.\n\nGBVI: Powered is the player Ultraman of that game. The other OG is a fairy that guide the Opthical Three against Inferios. Tallgeese, Shadow Moon and Alien Battan also pilot a weird fusion mecha. And Epyon get devored by Inferios.\n\nRetsuden: a SNES game where the only OGs where the ships, and that's the best image I could find of the CENTAUR, the player's ship.\n\nShooting: Prometheus is a girl.\n\nLost Heroes 2: The first Lost Heroes actually has this same OG as the final boss, but there, he's just a Palette Swap of Ultraman Belial, Kamen Rider Poseidon, and Reborn Gundam.\n\nGaia Saver: The Killer Trio is a mutated Kamen Rider 2 and Zoffy, and a Brainwashed Amuro Ray piloting a heavy Zeonified Nu Gundam.\n\nDaidal: His backstory is that he tries to gather power in order to have the means to find his master, who he has no memory of. Sounds familiar?\n\nFinal Attack: Ana Stacia is voiced by the same VA as Mai. And she has clones.\n\n1 HD: Yes, God Noah is a direct rip from brainwashed Battle Commander Roar.\n\n>>15682572\n\nI been searching for that. So, basically, Dagubul is Dark Brain.
