The Masou Kishin part is so numerous, I had to divide them into FOUR parts, and now I need a FIFTH part for the Giants.

Valsione, Granzon, and Valsionga are in the Armored Module part. Mainline OG sprites take priority over non-SD ones.

>>15681172

Who are the new characters? They represent any robots?

>>15681726

I actually did a double check on 'Seicrifice', and yes, that's how it is too. The Shura names has a similar issue, complicated by the various pronuciations to the Ars Goetia around.

I'm glad you asked...

So, from what I gathered from Real Robot Battle Line info, Duplicators were devices created by a ancient civilization in order to survive a solar flare. It uses the data it gathered to recreate duplicates, be the originals from other dimensionals or the past. And that include LIVING BEINGS. It's not quite cloning since it can't, say, summon a army of Gundam Physalis, since there was only one, and it was piloted by one notable pilot (Gato). The copies can maintain their existence as long as Mother Duplicator is active.

You do the math.

Kind of feel I should note regarding the W Originals.

But 'The Database' is a Earth coined name for that faction of Originals much like how Feddies called Ze Balmary Empire 'Aerogaters' and Zuvorg Alliance 'Inspectors/Guests'.

They had a official name they called themselves as such and that some of the other alien factions used too. Nobody in game except the humans used the Database name.

I think it was 'Scribes of Knowledge' or 'Knowledge Recorder' I'm a bit fuzzy since it's been a long time since I played W and I don't remember exactly how it was written, one of those names might've been a theme song name which isn't helping.

The majority of the units that you listed there are straight upgrades for units that we already have or in Banpreios' case, shaves off two deployment slots because we no longer need to deploy R-2 and R-3 individually.

The ending of @1 caused a gigantic shockwave, and Earth was going to hotwire all the robots ever together and use them to make a shield to keep Earth from getting wiped out by that shockwave.

It failed miserably because somebody decided to try to end the world to get back to the original timeline, and then it succeeded because the PCs who got thrown into the future got back in time to get super glued.

Trivia: the main group in GB6 (Ultraman, RX and Wing) are called Optical Three, not Battle Force. That's why Roa is not in that game. The Battle Force is actually only in 4 and 5.

>>15682545

Good, very good, but not all. Answers not on pic. Now, some observations:

GB V: Dunno if a group of cowboys would count as the Battle Force. Anyway, Gardras and Crystal Dragoon have nothing to do with each other.

GBVI: Powered is the player Ultraman of that game. The other OG is a fairy that guide the Opthical Three against Inferios. Tallgeese, Shadow Moon and Alien Battan also pilot a weird fusion mecha. And Epyon get devored by Inferios.

Retsuden: a SNES game where the only OGs where the ships, and that's the best image I could find of the CENTAUR, the player's ship.

Shooting: Prometheus is a girl.

Lost Heroes 2: The first Lost Heroes actually has this same OG as the final boss, but there, he's just a Palette Swap of Ultraman Belial, Kamen Rider Poseidon, and Reborn Gundam.

Gaia Saver: The Killer Trio is a mutated Kamen Rider 2 and Zoffy, and a Brainwashed Amuro Ray piloting a heavy Zeonified Nu Gundam.

Daidal: His backstory is that he tries to gather power in order to have the means to find his master, who he has no memory of. Sounds familiar?

Final Attack: Ana Stacia is voiced by the same VA as Mai. And she has clones.

1 HD: Yes, God Noah is a direct rip from brainwashed Battle Commander Roar.

Remember, Z was the odd game in that it WASN'T planned with OG in mind. Every other game has been planned with their OG inclusions mostly thought up.

So if the Ionia happens to look like some other, older battleships Banpresto made in some game, you can bet that's why.

It still makes me roll my eyes that that battleship's only goddamn moves are basically just summon attacks - and even worse, summon attacks which are literally just regular attacks if you field that unit, and if you do field that unit the battleship is still totally useless.

And they also cost WAY TOO FUCKING MUCH EN, like jesus fuck things that cost 60+ EN should be illegal in Neo and are outside of that ship.

Basically any "translated information" about SRW from before around 2012 is super fucky and just as likely to be fake as real. I know making fun of the GameFAQs SRW community is a horse so beaten that we don't even bring it up anymore - and to be clear, they're absolutely full of shit over there and deserve every bit of mockery they get - but until around when 2ndOG came out things really weren't any better over here.

Lots of ways to go about it 'Scribes of Knowledge' would be the most generally straightforward. 'Chroniclers of Knowledge' would be more accurate considering the context and what they do.

Knowledge Recorder (the name of the BGM) is actually what you would get if you were to plug that name into a dictionary so it counts too but it's awkward.

The Super Hero Generation originals really don't belong here they're not really part of the same group of SRW license games nor even the Compatti Heroes.

In fact if you've ever played the game you'll instantly know the thing is basically a re-skinned G-Gen game by completely different dev team belonging to a different series, it's even in the name. It is pretty much part of the Generation series rather than SRW/Compatti Heroes.

Search "帝王ダイダス" (Teioh Daidas) and you'll find a lot of references to it.

Like someone said above, Battle Force was only in Great Battle 4 (and not 5). The name of the main group changed in almost every Great Battle game. I'll boot up the games and look for the names.

Play that free event unit they gave you.

Get a friend who has a Taiki event unit.

Have a few solid units who can take hits while the event units blow the fuck out of enemies. Taikis, Blasters, and insane Defender walls usually preferred, those are great at stalling and getting kills most of the time.

And then just manually make the Taiki kill literally everything, if it's backed up properly it shouldn't have an issue.

Ran is the better unit to use in this event IMO. Her hissatsu costs only 2 cores and can tear through grunt waves pretty quick, the other two can't do that. When this event ends I think Muginami should be the better one.

Also unrelated but somehow I feel the Lagrange units are made to go through the color cycle in reverse. May sounds a bit weird but my friend Muginami always one-shot Attacker grunts (her supposed weakness) while taking a lot longer to kill Shooters and Defenders.

I Just finished stage 49 and managed to get the SR Point and destroy dessler. the battle against gardim was so damn satisfying fighting Ghuli and getting Chitose was great and ghulis a cool dude. all in all this stage was so satisfying to play through killing 2 big bads and feeling sorry for ghuli. Now onto the home stretch The normal route

Speaking of X-O, the cast list updated with a new series for permanent.

We don't know what it is, but it's between the two Evangelion movies and Gurren Lagann. Now, that's not automatically a sign that it's Rebuild Q - there was a year between Rebuild 1 and Gurren-Hen, which is what is in this game, so anything between September 2007 and September 2008 is valid - but, well, it's probably Eva Q.

Not GL, unless they suddenly added the series for some fucking reason.

It's between 2.0 and Gurren-hen, which means either something from late 2007, early 2008, or Eva Q.

Also on the docket - another Betraida, Taiki Dancouga Nova MAXGOD, something from Sora Kake Girl, and OGs, in this year's (first?) swimsuit event.

It's obviously Eva 3.0. Don't expect much from these lazy faggots.

Just finished Stage 50 and it was by far the most satisfying End to embryo ever. Just ruining him in one turn was amazing hearing him scream and bitch to the end and go crazy, I didnt kill leonard first because I wasnt sure I would be able to kill him and have enough time to kill embryo so I just focused on him and im wondering what item I missed out on from just killing embryo? two more stages and I am done with the game I am so hyped for this and also is it preffered to keep my units in my ships for the first couple of turns to build up sp because I had to do that a few times during stage 50 and I heard 51 is much easier, what are you're guys advice?

Yeah in the source material Kouji still used Mazinger Z in the final fight with ZERO.

But if they've already marketed ZERO like that then the sequel manga will most likely be unit-only in order for Kouji to pilot the ZERO as a heroic being.

Gotta keep the toy sales and those marketing quotes consistent.

Decided to translate some SRW K 4koma from SRW K 4koma Kings books. I'm slowly doing it 2-3 comics per day. And skipping some where I don't understand either grammar or jokes/references. Will return to them later.

Also, English is not my native language, so some translations may be awkward. Hope you'll have fun.
