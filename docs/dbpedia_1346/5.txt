-Angel: "In the final episode, it was revealed that (Angel) herself was the Memories. Once she found out the truth, Angel used the Big Venus to try to erase everything and return it to how it was forty years ago. However she was persuaded by Roger's negotation which spoke of the purpose of the Memories, and allowed the world to continue."

-Gordon: "His incomplete book, Metropolis, seemingly records what happened forty years ago. After he saw Angel off to the mysterious place in the depths of Paradigm City, he asked the true writer of Metropolis to record the Memories, and disappeared."

-Big Venus: "The Big Venus awoke when Paradigm City's creator*, Angel, realised that she herself was the Memories, and tried to return to where she once was."

So would you play it, Matt? Or is there anything among it that's salvageable as a decent cast list, or just that might mesh decently?

I find it amusing how I was close to ending up with three different Getters in the game, since after completing Shin Getter/Dragon, I was close to forming the Getter Robo Ah team and the New Getter Robo as well. Would have liked to see that combo attack made into a thing.

...I also wonder why even with all the RNG, I can't seem to shake certain series. Tri-Zenon and X Astray just keep showing up, and the Gravion and Pelsedia teams just keep trying to show up in my runs.

Yeah, between stage recruitment and Gatcha, the lists tend to be rather bloated inside with no way to counter that, save for limiting which type of recruitment you do. It's why last time I posited the question to those who cared about whether my next run should be stage-only or gatcha only.

Playing SRC as much as I have lately makes me think there's some merit to the concept as an actual SRW game, perhaps an alternative to OE's attempt at being a DLC-only SRW, but it would need to be careful about handling it, if only to avoid being thought of as worse.

Final team at the end of SRC Plus mode 2nd run, and Neo Granzon upgrade is still nowhere to be seen. Where is SRC guy when I need him?

Losses include Buriki-Daioh from LIVE A LIVE and Armageddon Shin Getter (being one-shoted by that fire fucker from SRW D for fuck sake), but in return, got some nice units to compensate for that like pic related.

Also, pic related is a very well-worth unit to use in several runs. Despite the small movement range, he has Teleport, which doesn't give a shit about terrain, and I've even given him double action skill part. His Buster Launcher upgrade requirement is at Lvl 65, even higher than Demonbane's last upgrade, which is an Heavyarms-like MAP but absurdly powerful.

His sub-pilot Lachesis even has a seishin that REVIVES a dead unit

For Plus Mode, according to the code, the requirement for Neo Granzon upgrade seems to be "Defeat Shuu in Neo Granzon"

I have no idea whether it has to be specifically 30F's boss Shuu or any other Shuu counts but you can test it out if you want - you can summon him on any other floor by repeatedly skipping a lot of turns - eventually you'll get a warning countdown and then Shuu will appear on the map.

I kinda realized that after I posted it, though I'd consider those guys more MC than, say, that green Giant Robo support gal I've gotten a few times, at least.

I'm still calling shenanigans on the RNG somehow. As my list above shows, I just can't escape the Gatchaman somehow. Even if I don't complete the machine and unlock the entry, I still end up getting at least one component.

For that matter, Golion is the same way, I always get at least one lion. Meanwhile, I've still yet to find all the components for Baldios in a single run...hell, even in that save file where I'd upped my cap to over five hundred and was just Gatcha-ing the hell out of things, I still couldn't piece it together.

I'm not sure. When I rolled it, it just came up green and support-ish, and had no upgrades to speak of, so it was just there.

I like how the game still seems to be getting some regular attention by whoever's behind it, even as long as the game's technically existed. The latest version came only a day or two ago, adding a few bugfixes and whatnot, and even added the upgrade to stick Marvel in the Dunbine and Luna in the Impulse (provided you've already gotten said machines and upgraded so their normal pilots are removed, anyway).

I wonder if it'll update with new series and units anytime soon, there's still plenty he could put in, like some more Zoids some more modern stuff, Sentai, SD Gundam and other side Gundam materials...Heck, he uses most of the obscure RPGs from back then, why doesn't he let Gilliam's Gespenst become the XN Geist?

Honestly, I'd like to see him put in recruitable versions of villains, too, for the ultimate in dream-team creation, so we can have our teams with Burn and his Zwarth, Master Asia, or even take a leaf from D and use the OVA version of Godmars with Marg in it

>should I use the partner system or not

Definitely, much like L (and BX) the Partner System actually is functional and useful.

As for the runs, there's a few ways to do it, but the maximum in terms of efficiency is getting all the secrets in four runs, because of a glitch that causes Yllbora to only unlock if you do his route on the first route split on the run you unlock him in (like it was a kill based flag or something.) As far as that goes, there's two routes to my knowledge:

>Route 1: The normal one, would be the 3 route way if Yllbora worked.

Run 1, get Master Therion, the Dunbine/WoR guys, and the Fafner guys.

Run 2, get... uh, pretty much everything else that isn't Yllbora or Brera. This means Will, Karen, Ishigami, Ryofu/Lu Bu and Chousen/Diaochan, Patrick and Andrei, Graham, and Ishigami.

Runs 3/4: Get either Brera or Yllbora, then get the other. Lament that if Yllbora worked right, or if he didn't have his third requirement, you could still do this in three runs.

>Route 2: What I'm doing on my file, the JUSTICE ROUTE.

Run 1: Get Ishigami and Lu Bu FIRST. Michio and Kurusu (Cross? Still haven't gotten a shot at HaE, will get a chance after work later) are still obtainable of the Fafner secrets, but Goubain and Female Aura Battler aren't.

Run 2: Get everything from Run 2 of the first one, as well as everything else from Run 1 of the first one, except Karen.

Run 3/4: See Route 1 for details, add Karen to the third run.

>How's NG+ work in UX?

Any secret you manage to obtain carries over, except for a few minor ones involving a route split in the late 20s (Bilbine upgrading to Night Camo and getting... I think all it is is five more Mobility? and Lux in another shitty Wings of Rean grunt on one side, a cosmetic change for Romina on the other side).

On top of that, excepting the odd Yllbora issue I mentioned, all flags for routes carry over - so, say you go the America route after 13, and then next run you go the Japan route. You're still eligible to get people like Will on that route, the flag for taking that carries over. However, do be warned that if there are actual REQUIREMENTS on that route, it won't work - Master Therion and Lu Bu are BIG on this, but Yllbora, Sakomizu, Karen, and Ishigami all do too. (I think Will doesn't, since his is just "Heroman needs X kills at the end of this stage" and you can get those before the split, but I'm not going to automatically assume.)

Skill parts carry over, and you can choose to keep them on the characters they're loaded on OR move them all off so you can reapply them on NG+. (BX does the same thing, and I'm pretty sure both have parts you only ever can get one copy of, so that's a thing too.)

Kills apparently go completely fucking insane on NG+ and skyrocket, so no idea on that one. All kill count based things are required to be gotten in the run you get them on - so, if you get Will, Heroman needs to get 200 kills IN THAT RUNTHROUGH - but you can Game Over and any kill you get is retained. For anyone not named Graham Aker, THE SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH is apparently good, for him I have no idea what you do. (He only needs 50, maybe just get him all the kills normally.) If you ever play BX, note that this is reversed.

Money... fuck if I know, man. It carries over 100% first run on BX, but no idea if UX does the same thing.

Unless you're running Defender/Shooter for some reason, I can't see why you wouldn't, it's a pretty solid SR.

That said, enemy lineup seems to be 100% Defender/Shooter, so maybe Attacker/Defender is the best build to run. I dunno. I can't personally maintain a team like that because all my usable defenders are SSRs, and my weight limit is way too small for that. (Seriously, my only SR defender's fucking Getter 3)

I've been using SR Gunbuster on the team and I have yet to see any Fever Time. Hell, I've had SR GaoGaiGar and SSR King J-Der (who doesn't get any bonus in this) on the team, and still no luck.

On the other hand, I was surprised that the difficulty caps at 52 or so in the final stage of the event. Considering that Story Mode is handing my ass on a platter every time I try to take on it, this is beyond weird.

Also, without Fever Time, all I can get is 918 thingie points per stage if I use a friend with the event SSRs. Currently around 40000 thingie points, so reaching 70000 is going to be a major pain in the ass.

>inb4 they add a Primeval event stage in a few days.

Ah, right, I'm also the emu-testing anon from last thread: no, UX doesn't work in Citra yet. I managed to get a decrypted one, but it doesn't boot. The only one that supposedly boots it is pretty much dead, too.

You heard right. That stage throws 48 really shitty MP Destruction Robos at you; anyone halfway competent can slaughter their way through the horde without much difficulty and pick up a ton of kills.

It comes right before the first notable killcount-based secret requirement, too.

I figured out the those items similar to "黒の絆" are used to limit the unit recruited in one stage to one category such as Super, Real, Combiners, Gundam, Suparobo, or Support. When placed on the leader, at the start of the stage the game give you a choice to use it to get units you want.

By that logic, that one distinct item "Bonds of Black", with '???' description should enable you to change the recruit unit in that stage to Neo Granzon.

Yet when I used it in my third run the choice notification didn't appear, and when I tried to manually activate the item, an error popped up.

I DID check. But it's just kind of annoying. Hell, if drop complete was money I'd be fine with that. Out of all the things they copied from Chain Chronicle, "+100 to all stats every time you limit break" and "2000 friend coins for 1 rare" were not. So Friend Coins are just an accumulated resource of uselessness.

Duly noted. I'm making it a point now on playthroughs to have my main objective be to always complete incomplete mecha if possible, so it and Dancouga will be filled out fairly soon before I let the RNG decide what my next recruit is.

>>13716845

Not to mention the game goes by more classic SRW in style, and anything above a range of 3 was/is a serious luxury then. A bit less so here, but back then, most everything was low-range. Short range is one of the reasons Wataru was a bit hard to use when I first started playing the game.

So guys, what's your opinion on R?

I'm currently playing it, and it's kinda refreshing to have RR bosses without over-bloated HP, also the story seems kinda nice so far, what with the time warp and stuff like Boazanians trying to drop Axis when Haman fails, Banjou figuring out MCs identity, W Gundam plot integrated kinda smoothly or Relena trying to negotiate with Butcher.

I've never finished R, but I think it seemed like a solid game and all. I keep saying that they really dropped the ball by missing their chance to do what they did to A, and make an "R Portable."

After all, they could copy-paste from OG Gaiden, do pretty much minimal effort on the unused Excellence frames, very few stuff in R wasn't already used in A Portable, and those that weren't wouldn't be that much effort. I would have only expected them to put in effort/budget towards animations like Plasma Thunder, Getter Final Crash, and the Satellite Cannon and maybe G-Bit moves.

It's alright, I'm always a fan of stories with time travel.

The only problem I found is that you don't spent a lot of time in the "bad future" (i.e the start of the game). You only do a few stages of it, and so only get to see a small glimpse of how messed up it is.

It would have been nice if they stretched it out longer.

It doesn't actually seem that bad when you have aliens gangbanging Earth and stuff after the timeslip.

Improving past like saving those Nergal colonists feels really good though. The story generally feels kinda lighthearted. I've laughed my ass off at Puru persuasion event (it's Judau trying to talk some sense into her, as he mentions chocolate parfait she starts to crack but that's not enough so everyone else starts describing how delicious sweets are that makes her switch sides; after the mission she starts to flip out cause it turns out Ra Cailum, unlike Nadesico, has only space rations and noodles and they also are forced to make furo bath out of an oil drum for her to calm her).

This is probably the least bizarre cast list I've received so far. I'd play it.

It came at a point where I was really burnt out on SRW. Didn't help that I'd only just wrapped up the last Jigoku run that counted for carryover.

Keep meaning to get back to it (I was on like... 32? I know I'd just gotten Geminion Ray/Rei/what-have-you) but every time other games caught my attention and off I was again.

Yeah, that seems worthy of a portable Nintendo entry. Especially since Mazinkaiser, LODM and a Tatsunoko show are tossed in here.

Would be interesting to see the 3DS take on the Dancouga/Nova combo attack, plus the return of the combo attacks from W between Getter and Mazinkaiser.

As long as they actually use more Toei Getter songs for once.

I just checked, and you don't need someone with the "extra points during the event" ability on the field in order to get the bonus. You can just leave them in the ship if you want.

Still laugh at that animation, making the Sazabi looking like a baby/little kid throwing a temper tantrum.

It would make sense if it wasn't for the fact that this Char is a good guy through and through.

I've noticed Chiyoko tends to not draw nearly as much boobage as SRW's other designers. It's especially hilarious when you start comparing Marguerite's character art and her in-game cut-ins where they're like twice the size and bouncing everywhere.

Titties in SRW tend to be big but it's not like they're so big they can't exist in real life

"Actual breasts" come in a lot of shapes and sizes you know

You know, that looks like a rather playable cast list. 16 series, too, it's like what the Nintendo Handheld team might do if they ever decided to go back to a more basic SRW.

That said, what are "Garubion", Xevious, and SOME-LINE?

I dunno what Galvion and SOME-LINE really are, but Xevious is an old SHMUP game, similar to how Gradius and Thunder Force are potential units in here. I was hoping to see something from R-Type show up in my Gatcha one day.

SOME-LINE is a combiner, I know, though. Five base components, and then the resulting machine can combine with one more piece for an upgraded version.

Adding to >>13718264, it's a neat cop show about former convicts hired to bust crime. However, it came out during Kokusai Eigasha's waning days, so the show got suddenly cancelled outright in the middle of its run (as in "pull the plug out of the socket" sudden), to the point that it took decades before it even got a home video DVD release.

Galvion needs whichever item lets it fly, though. Most stages in the game aren't kind to land-locked units, so its movement got hurt a lot, no matter how otherwise decent it might have been.

OG1, OG2, Alpha Gaiden, J. All but Alpha Gaiden are for the GBA, Alpha Gaiden and J are fan translations.

Take your pick.

Same with OG2. Kyosuke is sort of the MC, but you can easily avoid him on the route splits.

OG1 and J have selectable protagonists. Which is "best" is really a matter of debate. If you like having female mains, J has your only English-language heroine.
