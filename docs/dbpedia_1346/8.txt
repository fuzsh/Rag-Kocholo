Erice Utsumi (宇津見エリセ, Utsumi Erise?) is the main protagonist of Fate/Requiem. She is the Master of Voyager "After" the Holy Grail War‎‎.

Profile[]

Background[]

Erice is a 14-year-old girl who lives in the seaside town of Akihabara, part of Mosaic City. In a world in which each person has a Holy Grail in their hearts that can summon a Servant, she is the only person without one.[3][1] She meets Voyager, the last Servant summoned in the world.[4][1] Her best friend is Karin, who she has known since she was 9 and who calls her Eri-pie (エリち, Erichi?). She doesn't have any other friends since people her age are rare.[5]

Erice's parents were a human man, Mr. Utsumi, and a Servant woman, Izanami. How a Servant was able to have a child has yet to be explained. When Erice was young she lived with her parents in Mosaic City's Shinjuku, until they died. After that she was raised by her grandmother Chitose Manazuru, but now lives on her own.[4][5] She does not get along well with Chitose at all, and after moving out she turned an abandoned maid café in Akihabara into her apartment.[3]

Erice's job is killing Servants who step outside the rules established by the Holy Grail. She is known as the Grim Reaper (死神, Shinigami?) and is a part of Mosaic City's Nightwatch.[4][1] Her information brokers for this job are the Borgia Siblings,[6] and her boss is Caren Fujimura.[4]

For her whole life, evil spirits called Dread Spirits have inhabited Erice's body.[7][1] While they give her the power to fight Servants, they also torment her. On nights after she's killed a Servant she can feel them writhing beneath her skin, clamoring with impatience, and she has to wrap herself in bandages while sleeping to prevent having her sheets soaked with blood.[7] If the Dread Spirits are not satisfied by Erice's killing, they open wounds across her body and cause external and internal bleeding.[8]

Erice is technically a middle schooler, but she does not often attend class, saying she has more important things to do but secretly because she just doesn't want to. She is still passing her academic evaluations and getting the credits she needs from extracurricular courses. However she does attend public history classes taught by Caren Fujimura that people of all ages can sign up for.[3]

Circe wonders if Erice's name is derived from ElysiumWP (エリュシオン, Eryushion?), a Greek afterlife for heroes. When Erice responds that her father liked French literature and didn't know Greek, Euclid adds that the French Élise (エリゼ, Erize?) is synonymous with Elysium, such as with the Champs-ÉlyséesWP (エリセの園, Erise no En?).[5]

Appearance[]

As she lives in a resort town, she sometimes wears a silver swimsuit and black windbreaker while going around town.[3][9] With Akihabara being converted into a coastal resort town, swimsuits are casual wear.[10]

Erice has a scar from when she was a child, her grandmother gave her a haircut but accidentally cut her ear with the scissors, making her bleed.[4]

Personality[]

She's focused on efficiency. She likes functional and practical tools and clothes, preferring the simple but effective. Her favorite foods are the spicy and highly nutritional ones. She pretty much doesn't care about flavor.[1] She loves finding a quiet place to read books, and she will not tolerate the mockery of Heroic Spirits.[11] Her favorite place to relax is Bookshop Café Borges in Akihabara.[6] She does not like Mages (likely due to her experiences with her grandmother Chitose) and says she is just a "Magecraft user", but that's debatable.[1]

Erice greatly dislikes the Holy Grail Tournament, as she sees it as simply exploiting the great heroes of human history.[7] She dedicates all of her free time to checking books and documentaries related to Heroic Spirits.[1] She also loves going to museums.[12] While she does leverage this knowledge to ruthlessly erase them as the "Reaper", she also pays a deep respect and regard for their previous lives. The ones she esteems the most are the voyager and adventurer Heroic Spirits who discovered worlds unknown.[1] Of all explorers in history, she most admires Francis Drake. She thinks the rumors of Drake being a woman are impossible to believe, but also thinks that Drake's gender wouldn't matter anyway and being a woman wouldn't change what she did.[3] Erice laments how humans in her time have no desire to explore space anymore.[3]

Erice secretly harbors resentment toward Masters and Servants, since she is the only person in the world who does not have a Servant. She compares living in her world without a Servant to being like if you had poor eyesight but were told you were not allowed to wear glasses, or being told you had to travel somewhere on foot while everyone else got to use trains or buses. When she spoke with Voyager while bathing him on the night they first met, she broke down wishing he could have been her Servant.[3] After contracting with Voyager Erice becomes very protective of him and can't quite believe it really happened, referring to him with "My… He’s my… he’s a person like me’s… he’s my very own…".[13] In Fate/Grand Order, she becomes angry and upset when she thinks Ritsuka Fujimaru stole Voyager from her.[14]

Erice has trouble trusting little boy Servants because of an encounter she had with Avenger Louis XVII when she was younger, who used her trust and friendship and turned it against her.[3]

Her best friend Karin is irreplaceable to her, and Erice feels that if one of them ever lost the other, that would be the end. Often Karin's emotions will flare which will lead to a fight with Erice, but neither girl ever lets it stay that way.[7]

To Erice, the idea of romance is an unexplored continent that lies beyond her understanding, and something that could be even more dangerous than a Servant gone insane if one was not careful. She is surprised when Karin starts flirting with Kuchime, as she thought that Karin felt the same way regarding romance.[7]

The French children's book The Little Prince is important to her, with her referring to it as a comforting presence like an old friend always by her side.[3] She owns both a pair of aviator goggles and a replica toy of the airplane which its author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry flew.[7] The model was a gift from her father.[15]

She thinks her teacher Caren Fujimura having her underwear exposed instead of wearing a skirt or pants is cool. She greatly admires Caren and refers to her as her master, having known her for as long as she could walk.[3] She takes after her teacher in her fashion and food tastes.[1]

Erice doesn't think highly of otaku culture, although in her world that is not nearly as common in Akihabara as it used to be.[7] When she entered a hobby shop to try and figure out what kind of things Voyager enjoys, she describes herself as almost sick of looking at all the merchandise and the figurines of buxom women.[9]

Erice is unable to cry. She can still feel sadness and fear and other emotions one normally associates with crying, but says that she "doesn't know how to cry." Even the incident with Louis XVII and the death of Caren didn't prompt tears.[16] When Erice was younger her grandmother accidentally clipped her ear while cutting her hair, but Erice didn't react at all and Chitose didn't realize what had happened until she saw the blood streaking down Erice's neck. After treating the wound Chitose told Erice that she has to tell her when it hurts. Young Erice only gave a silent nod in reply.[4]

Role[]

Fate/Requiem[]

Five years before the events of Fate/Requiem, a nine-year-old Erice met Louis XVII and his Master at a therapy session which Erice was forced to attend. Erice befriended the two of them and would visit the Master's workshop, where he made things like children's school bags and shoes. Aware that Louis's Master was somewhat mentally disturbed, Erice took it upon herself to help him. Erice thought that, by giving support and with Louis on his side, the Master would be able to live in the drastically changed society "After" the Holy Grail War and help him get used to and blend into the lifestyle.[16]

Shortly after Erice befriended Louis and his Master, people began to go missing across Mosaic City without a trace, with their mutilated corpses found later in different locations. One day while visiting Louis's Master, Erice was told to no longer visit his workshop as he would be going somewhere far away, and let out a huge rant about the Holy Grail system and his absolute dissatisfaction about how the people's free will had been taken away due to the inclusion of Holy Grails and Servants into their lives. This was the last time Erice had a proper conversation with him.[16]

Some days later Erice ran into Louis on the street and learned that his Master had not in fact left the city. She returned to his workshop to find her Dread Spirit abilities activating automatically. The further into the Master's workshop Erice went the more dead bodies she found, accompanied by the sound of Louis humming. Erice's memories after that are blank, but she awoke to find that she had killed Louis's Master in self defense.[16]

Erice fell into Louis' Noble Phantasm La Grosse Tour, a recreation of his prison from life. Louis stood motionlessly and collapsed in her arms, fading away without his Master alive to supply Magical Energy. With his last words he called out for his mother.[16]

During this time, Karin was one of Louis's kidnapped victims, and one of the few who survived. It was due to this that she and Erice first met. Louis' death released Karin and saw Louis dying under Erice's arms. This was the first time they met and have been friends ever since.[16]

The Boy Among the Stars[]

As a defender of Akihabara who hunts Servants that break the rules of the Holy Grail, Erice recognized Kundry who arrived pursuing Hendrik van der Decken, a Servant whom she had decided was her lover, as a threat because if left alone she would begin to feed on the life energy of innocent people in order to sustain herself. A fight between Erice and Kundry deprived Kundry of her mount.[4]

Erice escorted Hendrik and his Master Ahasuerus out of Akihabara in an attempt to get Kundry to leave as well. Kundry had pursued them with her summoned Gremlin Familiars and fallen into despair when they left. Unwilling to leave the city herself, she pierced Erice with the Holy Spear and then fled. With the spear pierced through her body Erice fell into the water, and as her consciousness was fading a strange boy appeared and asked if she was worthy to be his Master.[4] Erice brings him to her home and starts looking out for him, while also trying to figure out his identity. She also starts to hope that he was her Servant, but no Command Spells ever appear on her hand. Caren Fujimura charges Erice with watching over the boy and hopefully figuring out his True Name.[3]

Soon after bringing the boy to her home, Erice receives a visit from her grandmother Chitose Manazuru and Chitose's Servant Lucius. Chitose speaks to Erice about having Erice stop her job as Nightwatch for a few months, to which Erice is vehemently opposed. But when she looks to Lucius for help, he only responds with a pained smile.[7]

While out in town one day, Erice and Karin meet Kuchime, a street musician.[7] Erice later befriends Koharu F Riedenflaus and Galahad Alter, the rising stars of the Holy Grail Tournament.[6] Despite her distaste for the tournament she, Karin, Kijyo Koyo, and the boy attend it to see Galahad and Koharu's match.[9] The tournament then gets interrupted by Nzambi and her zombies, causing chaos in the Colosseum. Erice fights off several zombified Servants, and clashes with Nzambi.[17]

After Nzambi's attack, Erice finds her mentor Caren Fujimura being killed by Anubis and his companion. They are chased off by Chitose, but before he leaves Anubis tells Erice that she belongs on their side.[18] As Caren dies she tells Erice that the Holy Grail War is not yet over, and if Erice wished to fight, she must go to Fuyuki.[19]

In the aftermath of Nzambi's attack Chitose demands that Erice hand the boy over to her, and when Erice refuses Chitose has Lucius attack him. When Galahad deflects Lucius's attack, Chitose leaves without a word.[20]

After Chitose leaves, Command Spells form on Erice's hand and the boy once again asks her if she is his Master. As the two of them make their contract, Erice declares his True Name of Voyager with tears in her eyes, and Voyager pledges that together they will end the Holy Grail War and destroy the world.[20]

Shinjuku the Nostalgic City[]

When Erice tells Caren Himuro that she intends to go to Fuyuki, Himuro advises that she visit the Yushima Tenmangū to find a replacement Nightwatch while she's gone. Erice thinks she means the chief priest, but Himuro actually means the chief priest's daughter, Rurihime.[21]

Before traveling to Fuyuki, Erice stops in her hometown, Mosaic City's Shinjuku. She says she needs something that Caren Fujimura left behind: the Shroud of Magdalene. Karin playfully accuses her of trying to find an excuse not to leave. In Shinjuku's red light district the group runs into Kuchime again, only for him to be detained by a woman named Makki using the very Shroud that Erice is searching for. Makki being given the Shroud of Magdalene had been Himuro's request and approved by Chitose, and so Erice's request to Himuro to take it for herself is denied.[22]

With their trip to Shinjuku yielding no results, Erice and her group meaninglessly wander the city with Erice in a funk. At a fruit parlor in front of Shinjuku Central Station, they run into Circe and Euclid, the latter of whom somehow knows who Voyager is and that he was summoned exactly twelve days ago. Euclid and Circe explain to Erice's group that ever since Voyager was summoned, no new Servants have been able to be summoned in Mosaic City, whether that be for newborn babies receiving their partners, or for people whose Servants died in Nzambi's attack and need replacements. Voyager is the Final Servant, the last Servant summoned in the world.[22]

Fate/Grand Order[]

Abilities[]

Erice is a miracle child of a Human male and a female Servant, an entity known as a "Quasi-Servant" (準サーヴァント, Jun-Saavanto?, also translated as "Semi-Servant").[1] Currently it is unknown how a Servant was capable of having a child. Makki reassures that even if mixed, she is still completely human. According to Makki, due to the unique nature of her body, if Erice leaves Mosaic City she will die within days.

After making her contract with Voyager, Erice finally received Command Spells of her own. Currently she does not know if hers are gone forever on use like her grandmother Chitose's, or if they will regenerate over time like everyone else's in Mosaic City.[5] As of her battle with Ammit, she has used two Command Spells.

Erice's red lock of hair is a Mystic Code with apps loaded onto it, such as one that lets her try to translate Berserker Servants' roaring and body language (including Kijyo Koyo).[7] By touching that red lock she can use her Magic Circuits to "send calls" and communicate remotely by magically causing vibrations in her inner ear, primarily with her mentor Caren Fujimura. It's possible for her to use this to add a video feed too, or indeed to simulate any of the five senses, but she doesn't want to open her privacy that much.[4]

Combat[]

Since her childhood, Erice has been trained in self-defense and killing techniques by Lucius, her grandmother's Servant.[7] Nzambi states that Erice is a Spellcaster.[8] She prepares magical charms ahead of time before a fight, trinkets from the Akihabara Department Store that she had poured her Magical Energy into.[7] The charms augment her body, such as improved eyesight and cardiopulmonary functions. She also keeps a barrier on her skin that helps defend against Servants' superhuman strength. Both the charms and the barrier disappear if she is weakened enough.[4]

Erice's most common form of attack is a magical bullet called Freischütz: Magic Bullet (魔弾(フライシュッツ)Madan(Furaishuttsu)?).[4][23] Freischütz is an upgraded form of Gandr that reproduces the legend of Der FreischützWP for a higher performance as a curse.[23] It is an imitation of the magical bullets wielded by the Demon Hunter Samiel of Bohemian legend.[1] Erice fires seven bullets, the first of which is just a normal Gandr but each one gets progressively stronger. The core of the curse is the seventh bullet which, as in the legend of Der Freischütz, takes the enemy to the grave along with her. Erice can avoid the curse's effect on her by simply reloading her bullets, resetting their power back to a basic Gandr. Only one time has she been forced to use the seventh bullet, and it resulted in her being in a near-death state for a month.[23]

Dread Spirits[]

Erice was born without a Holy Grail,[3] instead her body is inhabited by a number of Evil Spirits known as Dread Spirits (邪霊, Jarei?).[1] Her blood is poisonous to Servants and making contact with it is dangerous for them.[17][1] Her grandmother Chitose Manazuru taught her how to control these spirits and use them as weapons.[17] The Evil Spirits that lurk within her blood are especially effective as a weapon against Spiritual Bodies.[1] Using their power causes wounds to open all over Erice's body and coagulate her blood that she can shape into various weapons called branches, taking various shapes such as an axe, sword, or whip, among others.[17][8] The forms she uses most are Hallebarde (アルバード?) the battle axe, Vail (ベイル?) the hatchet, then Flail (フレイル?) the multi-nunchuk, and Räte (レーテ?) the net.[2]

She can use this ability to rip out a Servant's Spiritual Core from their Saint Graph, killing them. The Spiritual Core blackens and becomes one with Erice's branch, and Servants killed in this way do not return to the Throne of Heroes, so if a new copy of them is summoned they will not remember the experiences of the version that was killed.[1][17] Nzambi initially mistakes it for Imaginary Numbers Magecraft.[17] The drawback of using her spirits is that if they are not satisfied, wounds will open all over her body and cause external and internal bleeding.[8][1]

Erice describes her Dread Spirits as the souls of the dead, steeped in hatred and loathing. Nothing more or less than evil in its purest form, misbegotten creatures that the Throne of Heroes spat upon.[17] In Fate/Grand Order, Marie Antoinette wonders if they are similar to the black mud of the Holy Grail: pure human evil, contagious to the touch.[24]

Two of the Spirits, in particular, taught Erice how to survive the curse within her and control the Dread Spirits. They taught her to become "mother" and to give all the Evil Spirits the name Erlkönig: Demon King (魔王(エルケーニッヒ), Maō(Erukēnihhi)?). The name comes from the ErlkingWP of German folklore, a fairy who kills with a single touch.[17][1] Erlkönig will automatically activate the moment a threat is detected, even if Erice herself is unaware of it.[16][1] She can easily detect the servant girl and Anubis thanks to that ability. Nzambi is amazed that even with a disguise it still couldn't completely fool Erice.

Makki theorizes that the reason why Voyager cannot enter spiritual form is due to Erice's nature as a "Grim Reaper" and the evil spirits residing inside her.

She does not want Voyager to go near her when fighting because Erlkönig will also end up harming him, due to its poisonous nature to Servants, so it is highly dangerous for them to stick close together during combat. However, she can use a Command Spell to allow Voyager to resist the blood's poison for a short time, such as when she needed him to fly her to Ammit.[25]
