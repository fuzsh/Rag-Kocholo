Opener Any Killer Instinct attack that triggers KI's unique combo (and combo breaker) system. Every jumping normal and every special move are openers; in KI, hitting with a special move is usually the key point that transitions between "regular" unbreakable Street Fighter-style attacks to combo breakable, KI-specific techniques. After openers, you can usually transition into autodoubles, linkers, or manuals, do a combo that cycles between normal attacks and special attacks, then finish off with an ender.

オープナー (ōpunā) — Lit. opener DHC Glitch A bug in the original version of Marvel vs. Capcom 3 that let players ignore damage scaling and led to pretty easy touch of death combos. The goal was to perform a combo that puts the opponent in a certain "capture" state, then DHC in a particular way which would cause the opponent to spiral up in the air. The game would incorrectly remove damage scaling and hit stun deterioration and let you just absolutely smoke the character for free. The bug was short lived; it was patched out in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 less than a year later, but it was extremely powerful while it was in the game and defined a lot of top tier teams. There are two ways to learn more about this bug — either read my blog post on famous FG bugs , or learn everything in just 16 seconds from the master himself, Chris Hu . See video

The Fighting Game Glossary | infil.net

A combo that avoids the hitbox of a burst attack, making it safe to perform even if the opponent wanted to try and escape it. How easy it is to make your combo safe from bursts depends on the character. Sometimes your highest damage, best combo option is just naturally very burst safe, while other characters need to do a much lower damage version or change their combo path considerably. Against characters that are good at this, you'll need to have good game knowledge and burst only at very specific points in the combo, or else you will just waste your burst and get hit for even more damage than you were trying to avoid. Sometimes that means not being able to burst at all, and the damage is just guaranteed.

バースト対策コンボ (bāsuto taisaku konbo) — Lit. burst countermeasure combo See video

Matchup The strategy and game knowledge that applies for one specific character against another specific character. You can use the term generally, such as "I struggle in the Ryu vs. Guile matchup" or "in the Sagat matchup, try not to jump very often". It's also quite common to try to measure one character's advantage over another by stating how many games out of 10 they should win if two high-level players of equal skill played against each other. Opinions differ on exactly how to interpret the numbers, but here's a generally accepted meaning: 5-5: An equal matchup. 6-4: A favorable matchup, but the disadvantaged character can still win without huge difficulty. 7-3: A quite favorable matchup, the winning character does not have to take many risks to win, but can still lose with a few key reads by the opponent. Most modern games have a few 7-3s but not much worse. 8-2: A very favorable matchup, the winning character almost wins by default with one or two dominating strategies. 9-1: The matchup is so favorable that there is almost literally nothing the opponent can do to stand any chance of winning. These basically don't exist in modern fighting games. 10-0: The worst matchup in fighting game history. An incredibly easy strategy dominates the match with absolutely zero counter-play possible. Matchup numbers are often up for debate, especially since people of different skill and knowledge are discussing it, but there is real value in the discussion nonetheless. You can make matchup charts this way, which might give insight into a game's balance.

組み合わせ (kumi awase) — Lit. matching / pairing Just Defend A mechanic, originally popularized by Garou: Mark of the Wolves, where you press back to block immediately before an attack is going to hit you. It's also present in some other SNK-published https://glossary.infil.net

games, like Samurai Shodown and some modern King of Fighters titles. The input is pretty similar to a parry, except if you miss the timing, you'll often just safely block, so it's not nearly as risky to try. As a result, the reward usually isn't nearly as good as a parry either; usually you just build a little bit of extra meter and perhaps avoid taking any chip damage. There are similar mechanics in other games too, like instant blocking in the Guilty Gear series.

ジャストディフェンス (jasuto difensu) — Lit. just defense Plink An input trick where you press two different buttons on two consecutive frames. If you use an arcade stick, the best way to do this is to "drum" two different fingers across the two buttons extremely quickly. It will kind of feel a bit like a piano input. It's often notated with a ~, so pressing MP and then LP right after would be MP~LP. This technique was especially common in Street Fighter IV, where the buttons you'd pick would descend in strength (for example, HP and then MP). A quirk in SFIV's input handling system would treat these two separate button presses as the same button (that is, the second input would "copy" the first). Giving you the same button on two consecutive frames was a very important way to double your chances at hitting your 1-frame link, and it became a near-mandatory skill to learn to improve past the beginner ranks in SFIV. You could even use the select button to do this! "Plink" is pronounced as one syllable, but it is short for "priority link" (or "P-link"), since it makes use of how SFIV prioritizes your button presses when they are exactly one frame apart. While the term originated in SFIV, it's now the common phrase for this type of input across several other games. You'll use it for techniques like FD Canceling in Guilty Gear, and it even finds its way into the name of other important mechanics, like plink dashing in Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

辻式入力 (tsujishiki nyūryoku) — Lit. crossing technique input 辻式 (tsujishiki) — Lit. crossing technique See video

Main The character you're the best with and play the most. Sometimes you might be forced to switch off this character if they have a bad matchup, but it's the character you'll hope to ride with most of the way in a tournament. People switch mains all the time as the game's meta changes, or as new patches come out that nerf or buff your favorite move. If you never switch mains, maybe you're a character loyalist.

メインキャラ (mein kyara) — Lit. main character Guard An alternate term for blocking. Japanese players will always refer to blocking as guarding. https://glossary.infil.net

Mishima A character archetype in the Tekken series, most notable for their ability to wavedash and perform Electric Wind God Fists and Hellsweeps. Usually, the character will share the last name Mishima, or be related to the Mishima family in some way. Kazuya, Heihachi, and Devil Jin are all Mishimas, and sometimes Jin is included in the list depending on who you ask. They're typically known for being high execution characters that are fun to watch when controlled by experts.

三島 (mishima) — Lit. mishima Mercy A way to extend a Mortal Kombat match after you have already won it. Instead of performing a Fatality or accepting your win by doing nothing, you can instead input a command which will give the opponent a small percentage of their life back and let them keep fighting. If you're looking to humiliate your opponent, this is a quick way to do it, but be sure to not lose the round after showing mercy!

マーシー (māshī) — Lit. mercy Variation A system in some Mortal Kombat games that gives multiple ways to play a character. Each variation for a character will have some common moves that are always available, and then add some unique moves you can't find in other variations, such as new attacks, movement options, or changes to the properties of existing moves. There are preset variations built by the developers, and some MK games even let you customize your own variation from a collection of all the character's possible moves.

バリエーション (bariēshon) — Lit. variation Route The specific choice of moves you use in a combo. Really, it's mostly a synonym for "combo". It's more common to use the term "route" or "combo route" in an anime game or other titles with a bigger reliance on air combos. You might say something like "that combo doesn't work on Sol, you need to use a different route" to imply that some moves in the combo need to change. You might have a few different routes for your BnBs depending on which character you're facing and whether you're midscreen or in the corner.

ルート (rūto) — Lit. route https://glossary.infil.net

Defensive Meter A meter in Mortal Kombat 11 that can only be used for defensive techniques. You can hold a maximum of 2 bars of defensive meter, and it gradually regrows over time at a fixed rate, just like your Offensive Meter. Performing a breakaway costs you both defensive bars, while performing a Getup will cost you one bar. You'll have to decide whether you want to attack as a reversal or escape an air combo after being hit, since once you do one, you won't be able to do the other for a while.

ディフェンスゲージ (difensu gēji) — Lit. defense gauge Counter Breaker A Killer Instinct technique that is designed to directly counter the combo breaker mechanic and get massive, game-changing damage. Trying a counter breaker is risky; you have to stop your combo right in your opponent's face and enter a parry-like stance that tries to catch any break attempt. If you're correct and the opponent did try to break, you'll blow right through it, lock them out for 4 seconds, and earn huge damage with any combo you want. If they didn't try to break, though, you'll be left vulnerable right in their face and they can punish you heavily. Counter breakers are the juice that make the combo breaker system sing in Killer Instinct. They feel amazing to land and feel terrible to get hit by, which is all you want out of such an emotional system. The shout the announcer gives on a successful counter breaker will never grow old.

カウンターブレイカー (kauntā bureikā) — Lit. counter breaker See video

Character Specific A strategy (usually a combo) that will work only if your opponent is playing certain characters. There are many reasons for this, including hurtbox differences between characters of varying sizes, characters that fall at different rates while being juggled, characters that reel back in an awkward way after being hit which dodges future attacks, and much more. Some games try to standardize hurtboxes as much as they can so there is not as much character specific jank, while in other games, it can feel like the wild west and you'll have to remember multiple combo routes depending on your opponent's character. But no matter the game, there will always be at least some character specific stuff to learn.

キャラ限 (kyara gen) — Lit. limited character See video

Macro https://glossary.infil.net

5/259

6/20/23, 6:05 PM

The Fighting Game Glossary | infil.net

Assigning a single button to act as pressing multiple buttons. For example, if you have a hard time pressing all three punch buttons in a Street Fighter game, you can assign a spare button to be a 3 punch macro, making it a lot easier to do EX moves or similar attacks. Most games will let you macro several common multi-button commands, like throw, in your controller settings. Note that "macro" can also mean a long series of pre-programmed inputs automatically played by the computer. With special software, you could program a macro to do a complicated combo that will never fail, and then just press one button to watch it all happen. Using macros in this sense is extremely illegal in tournaments, and I'd better not catch you doing it online either. The general rule is to stick to what the in-game controller options allow.

マクロ (makuro) — Lit. macro Uppercut Yet another blanket term that almost always means a dragon punch or shoryuken. It's probably more common than those other terms if the move's official name has Uppercut in it (like, for example, Sagat's Tiger Uppercut), but really, it's all the same thing.

アッパーカット (appā katto) — Lit. Uppercut Skill Ceiling The absolute peak of skill possible by a human in a game, assuming basically unlimited time and knowledge. If a game's interactions are pretty straightforward and easy to understand, or if there aren't a lot of interesting options that require practice, the skill ceiling will be pretty low. If a game is filled with tons of esoteric character knowledge, there are many interlocking system mechanics, and you'll have to make difficult snap decisions quickly, these things will give a skilled player a huge edge and the skill ceiling will be pretty high. We hope most games have a huge skill ceiling, or else they tend to stop being interesting much faster. You can also discuss a game's skill floor.

V-Trigger A central comeback mechanic in Street Fighter V. Your "V-Gauge" fills up as you take damage or successfully use your V-Skill, and when it's full, you can activate your V-Trigger, which usually powers up your character in a unique way for a good length of time (or, for some fighters, it is just simply a strong one-time use move with no powerup). At the character select screen, you can choose between two unique V-Triggers to bring into battle — some characters may switch up their V-Trigger depending on the matchup, while others tend to find the most success just sticking with the same one, no matter who they're fighting. V-Triggers are strong tools that can drastically turn the tide of battle, but to use them, you can't spend your gauge on V-Reversals or V-Shifts, so it's a trade-off.

トリガー (V torigā) — Lit. V-trigger

Loop Any sequence of moves (or maybe even just one move) that repeats itself several times in a row, usually in a combo. Some famous fighting game combos are based on loops, like the Dust Loop in Guilty Gear, Daipan Loop in 3rd Strike, Paint the Fence in Capcom vs. SNK 2, and Run Stop Fierce in Street Fighter IV. If you're playing kusoge, you'll probably run into lots of infinite combos that use loops to sneak past certain game rules and keep the combo going forever.

ループ (rūpu) — Lit. loop Shortcut An alternate motion for inputting special moves that is often shorter and sometimes easier than the default motion. A common shortcut in modern games for the DP motion, normally 623 in numpad notation, is 323. This lets you "rub the corners" and can let you do a dragon punch from a crouching pose, without needing to stand up. Shortcuts are common in pretty much every game in order to give input leniency and improve playability, so be sure to look into whatever shortcuts are possible in your favorite game and see if they help you out.

Reversal (3D) What some 3D series like Tekken and Virtua Fighter call a counter. Basically, you catch an incoming attack, then perform an automatic strike for some small damage. In Tekken, the type of attack you're allowed to catch is usually restricted to just straight punches and kicks; if your opponent does a move that's animated as a knee, or a headbutt, or a shoulder charge, these usually aren't counterable. In Virtua Fighter, the possible "classes" of move a reversal can catch is different for each reversal, so you'll have to check your favorite move's properties. If you get caught by a counter in Tekken, you have a second chance to escape damage! The game gives you a way out with a mechanic called a Chicken, which lets you reverse the reversal and push the opponent away. Note that this way of using the term "reversal" is very different from a reversal in a 2D game like Street Fighter. You might also want to read up on the sabaki and the inashi, which are a little similar.

返し技 (kaeshi waza) — Lit. return technique See video

Button Buffering Pressing a button while another button is being held down. Tekken will register the single button press as if you had pressed both the new button and the held button together, which can be useful for consistency in certain multi-button inputs. https://glossary.infil.net

Download Figuring out your opponent's strategy in the middle of a match and then using that information to beat them. Maybe you'll notice a certain pattern they always do and exploit that, or maybe you play in a certain way just to get information on how your opponent plays before turning it around (e.g., jumping a lot to find out whether they can anti-air properly). When a player starts a match poorly but begins to turn it around with several dominating rounds, you might say "the download is complete".

Low Attack An attack that must be blocked in a crouching position. Since most games don't let you block both low and high at the same time, low attacks (usually crouching kick normals) are intended to beat a standing guard. In most fighting games, this means you need to hold both down and away from your opponent on the analog stick, which means you cannot walk backwards while trying to block a low attack. Low attacks are good! You use them to catch people who try to walk backwards out of your pressure, or who expect to be hit by an overhead instead. See also mid attacks and overhead attacks.

下段攻撃 (gedan kougeki) — Lit. low level attack See video

Utility Super A super that gives you some sort of setup or positional advantage rather than pure, raw damage. The goal is not simply to add more hits to a combo like many supers, but rather to put yourself in a strong favorable position. This might mean more damage later (via some mixup) or just letting you safely control the screen so you can, for example, run away and start zoning again. Classic examples of utility supers include Urien's Aegis Reflector (3rd Strike), Dhalsim's Yoga Catastrophe ultra (Street Fighter IV), and Faust's Item Toss (Guilty Gear). See video

Impact Frame A specific way to talk about a move's startup. If a move has 7 frames of non-hitting startup, and then has its first active frame on frame 8, you'll often see this notated as "i8" to indicate that the move can first make impact with its opponent on frame 8. This notation is common in Tekken, but you'll also hear "impact frame" used in Super Smash Bros. from time to time.

発生 (hassei) — Lit. to occur/to generate Set Play https://glossary.infil.net

8/259

6/20/23, 6:05 PM

The Fighting Game Glossary | infil.net

Performing a pre-planned, calculated setup after you've knocked your opponent down. There's no winging it by the seat of your pants here; set play often involves some frame kills to set up very specific timing that will make your mixups extremely ambiguous and often avoid reversals. Think of it like drawing up a "set play" in a sport like American football. The plan of attack is well thought out and all possible outcomes are computed in advance. A "set play character" is a character that thrives on knocking you down and putting you in super gross set play situations. The best part about set play is, unless you're a training mode monster and enjoy the challenge, you typically don't have to find these mixups yourself! The kind folks on Youtube and Twitter will find them for you and tell you how to use them for maximum effect. People sometimes confuse this term with vortex; a good vortex is usually set play, but set play doesn't have to loop into itself.

セットプレイ (setto purei) — Lit. set play ハメ、ハメる (hame, hameru) — Lit. fit snugly into position, to entrap/set someone up, to screw someone over (used for set play that is basically inescapable)

Wavebounce Doing both a B-Reverse and a Turnaround-B during the same special move. If your eyes rolled back in your head while reading that sentence, you're not alone. Let's break it down a little bit. B-Reverses let you perform a special move in the opposite direction, while also reversing your momentum. Turnaround-Bs will do a special move in the opposite direction, but not reverse your momentum. The combination of these techniques means your character will reverse their direction, but not the direction they're facing. So, the character is pointing at you, drifting backwards, and then suddenly they're pointing at you, coming forwards while attacking. To do this, you need to tap away with the analog stick, then do your special move, then tap forward quickly. It's harder than doing either technique individually, and the benefits of the movement aren't quite as nice, so you tend to not see it too much.

ベクトル反転 (bekutoru hanten) — Lit. vector invert 空中ダッシュ (kūchū dasshu) — Lit. aerial dash 空ダ (kūda) — Lit. abbreviation of 空中ダッシュ 地ダ (chida) — Lit. ground dash (abbreviation of ground version of 空中ダッシュ) See video

Jump Install An advanced Guilty Gear technique that lets you access air mobility options, usually double jumping, after doing a move that is supposed to prevent you from doing them. This is common particularly in GG Accent Core and GG Xrd. One way to do this is to cancel a grounded normal into a jump, but then before you leave the https://glossary.infil.net

ground, do another grounded attack. You've now tricked the game into thinking you have the normal air options you'd get after a jump, even though you haven't actually jumped yet. Later in your combo, if you do something that would restrict your air options (like a super jump or a special move like Chipp's teleport), your earlier "jump install" takes precedence and you can now double jump! It takes a bit of practice to get used to, but jump installs can unlock cool new combo opportunities and more damage.

ジャンプ仕込み (janpu shikomi) — Lit. jump stocking/preparation See video

Spinning Piledriver A classic Zangief command throw in the Street Fighter series, executed with a 360 motion. Zangief grabs you, jumps high in the air while spinning, and then slams you into the ground. Commonly abbreviated to SPD. It also is a catch-all term for any grappler's command throw executed with a 360, across virtually any game. SPDs tend to be very fast, do tons of damage, and have long range, making them extremely scary up-close threats. The best way to deal with them? Don't be close enough in the first place. Keep those grapplers zoned out.

スクリューパイルドライバー (sukuryū pairu doraibā) — Lit. Screw Piledriver Catch Throw A special class of throw in Virtua Fighter that can't be teched and will also beat attacks that are in their startup. This last point is important, since Virtua Fighter's RPS system means attacks will always beat normal throws, so catch throws kind of break a cardinal interaction rule in VF. CTs aren't perfectly analogous to command throws in other fighting games, but they share some similar DNA in that they behave just differently enough from a regular throw to force your defense against them to change.

キャッチ投げ (kyacchi nage) — Lit. catch throw Hard-to-Blockable A nonsensical combination of words meant to convey a situation that is almost an unblockable, but can be defended through extremely precise blocking (often changing your blocking direction as a just frame input). For example, in games with unblockable protection, instead of overlapping an overhead and a low attack on the same frame, you might try to offset one or the other by a frame or two, forcing the defender to guess which attack is coming first and then rapidly switch their blocking direction to cover the other. While these sequences are "technically" humanly blockable, they are so difficult that they are often effectively unblockable, hence this hodgepodge word soup of a term.

Phantom Hit A strange phenomenon that can occur in Super Smash Bros. where an attack kind of "half hits". The move will do either half damage or zero damage (depending on which version of Smash you're playing), you might hear some small half-hearted sound cue, and the attack will not cause any knockback or hitstop. Like the name implies, it's kind of like you were hit by a ghost. This happens when the hitbox of an attack baaaarely makes contact with an opponent's hurtbox; we're talking like a millimeter of overlap in game units here. The precision is so strict that is more or less impossible to do on purpose, which makes phantom hits almost always an accident and a surprise when they happen. In later versions of Smash Bros., this may also be called a Glancing Blow.

チップ (chippu) — Lit. chip かすり当て (kasuri ate) — Lit. glancing hit See video

Infinite Worth A powerful super attack in the Under Night In-Birth series. Usually abbreviated to IW, they take your entire EXS gauge to use, and the command is universally half circle forward + D for all characters. There's also a more powerful version called Infinite Worth EXS.

インフィニットワース (infinitto wāsu) — Lit. infinite worth Plus When you are able to freely act, but your opponent cannot (usually because they are still trapped in block stun from your attack). Being plus (or "positive") in a fighting game is quite strong; it means you always have a headstart on your next attack, even if it's only by a very slim margin. Being plus and being minus are two sides of the same coin — when you are plus, your opponent is minus, and vice versa. You'll commonly use it in tandem with "on block", as in, "my medium kick is +1 on block". This means you will fully recover 1 frame before your opponent leaves block stun. That doesn't sound like a lot, but just think about it as a relative value. If you and your opponent attack with moves that have the same startup, your headstart means you will always hit first, and that's great.

有利 (yūri) — Lit. advantage See video

Auto-Cancel https://glossary.infil.net

11/259

6/20/23, 6:06 PM

The Fighting Game Glossary | infil.net

Automatically skipping the landing recovery of an aerial attack entirely, as long as you land on the ground during a specific time during the aerial. It's very similar to L-canceling, except the game does it for you without pressing a button and each aerial has unique, move-specific windows where it applies; the good auto-cancelable moves will have a window right after the active frames so you can let the move finish attacking and then recover quickly. Auto-canceling is in every version of Smash, even in Melee where L-canceling is common (since not every move has a useful auto-cancel window). In versions after Melee, where L-canceling was removed, your only choice to dodge landing recovery is to find aerials with good auto-cancel windows, or let the aerial fully complete before you land.

オートキャンセル (ōto kyanseru) Shield How you block in Super Smash Bros. Holding one of your shield buttons will put a round bubble around your character, blocking any attack that hits it. If you hold it too long or take too many hits, your shield will decrease in size; if it gets too small, it will shatter and leave you stunned for several seconds. Shielding is not foolproof; like most fighting games, you can still be thrown while shielding, and even attacked by a shield poke. Shield is also a special form of blocking in the Under Night In-Birth series. While blocking, press or hold the D button to eliminate chip damage and decrease block stun from incoming attacks slightly; you might even be able to punish some attacks you couldn't before by shielding them. Successful shields even gain you GRD. But the kicker is, if you get hit or thrown while shielding, you will be GRD broken, which is often super devastating. If you try to shield while in block stun, you'll get a Green Shield, which works a bit differently. Shield is also a concept in Melty Blood, but I've moved that definition over to its own term because this one's getting pretty long already.

シールド (shīrudo) — Lit. shield Shield Poke Poking at the outer extremities of a character's hurtbox that is sticking out of their shield. As the shield gets smaller due to prolonged use, it won't cover your entire body anymore. This gives a small area for certain attacks to hit you, even though you are trying to block. If you're unlucky, your character's default hurtbox might be so big that it extends outside your shield a bit, even at full power.

ガード漏れ (gādo more) — Lit. guard leakage (this term refers to what happens to the shield, not the attack that hits you)

Floor Break https://glossary.infil.net

12/259

6/20/23, 6:06 PM

The Fighting Game Glossary | infil.net

Punching someone through the floor, falling to the level below. Only a few Tekken stages will have destructible floors, so this is less common than the wall break or the balcony break, but if you do land one, you'll be able to continue the combo when you both land on the stage below. As with all Tekken "breaks", only certain moves can trigger a floor break.

床破壊 (yuka hakai) — Lit. floor break Sweep Usually crouching heavy kick, but typically refers to any normal that knocks the opponent down by sweeping their legs out from under them. Watch your toes.

足払い (ashi barai) — Lit. sweeping leg (general term for crouching kick) 大足 (dai ashi) — Lit. abbreviation of heavy (大) + 足払い Hit Stun The period of time when your character cannot perform any action after getting hit by an attack. Instead, you have to wait for your character to stop reeling from the hit and recover before you can take new actions. If the offensive player manages to land another hit before their opponent leaves hit stun, then that's how combos get formed! It's rare and super game-specific, but sometimes you can take actions during hit stun. Examples include combo breaking in Killer Instinct and bursting in Guilty Gear — it usually takes the form of some sort of risky combo escape. If you're not playing a game like this, then you just gotta sit there and hold the damage.

のけぞり (nokezori) — Lit. to bend/lean backwards See video

Punish Attacking someone when they are unable to block, making the damage guaranteed. Maybe you made them whiff an attack and then hit them before they could recover. Or maybe you blocked a very unsafe move and earned some big damage on a free counter-attack. In any case, the opponent made their mistake and now have to own up to the receiving end of some pain.

確定反撃 (kakutei hangeki) — Lit. confirmed counter attack 確反 (kakuhan) — Lit. abbreviation of 確定反撃 See video

Microwalk Walking for an incredibly short amount of time, usually 1 or 2 frames. This will reposition your character by a few pixels and sometimes allow certain combos to work where they normally would not (because the hitboxes and hurtboxes would otherwise miss each other by a millimeter). https://glossary.infil.net

13/259

6/20/23, 6:06 PM

The Fighting Game Glossary | infil.net

Microwalk combos are often incredibly difficult; if you don't walk at all, or walk slightly too much, the combo won't work and they can often trigger unwanted input shortcuts because of the added forward input. Fortunately, they are rarely mandatory to learn and are usually reserved for combo video fare.

微歩き (bi aruki) — Lit. microwalk See video

Crouch Tech A technique in some games where you try to tech a throw while you are crouching, and if a throw never comes, your tech attempt becomes a relatively low risk crouching normal instead. This only works in a few games though, since many modern games will simply force you to whiff a throw if you try to tech, even if you are crouching. Street Fighter IV is the most famous example of a game where crouch teching (and other throw tech option selects, like four finger teching) is a very common defensive strategy.

しゃがみグラップ (shagami gurappu) — Lit. crouch grab ("grab defense" is the official term for throw tech in SFIII, so people just say grab for throw tech)

しゃがグラ (shaga gura) — Lit. abbreviation of しゃがみグラップ Arcade Stick A common controller used to play fighting games. The left side has a joystick (with a certain top and gate), while the right side has a set of 8 buttons. Arcade machines will have input devices like this, although versions that plug into consoles and sit on your lap have been popular for a long time now. You'll probably also hear this called a "fight stick", or even just a "stick" (as in, "I prefer playing on stick"). There are often debates about whether playing on an arcade stick will improve your performance. Some people largely prefer them, since they have muscle memory finely tuned to it, while others prefer to use a standard controller or other input device. I think tournament results have shown over the years that it's really just down to preference. Use what you feel most comfortable with.

Force Roman Cancel A type of Roman Cancel in the Guilty Gear XX series of games, commonly abbreviated to FRC. The good side: FRCs only cost 25% of your Tension gauge instead of the normal 50%, making them a very economical and powerful use of meter. The bad side: FRCs can't be performed on https://glossary.infil.net

just any old move. It's only possible on a small subset of moves (often on projectiles), and the timing is notoriously tight, often just a couple frames of leeway during a very specific part of the move's animation. But when you get used to the precision needed, you can generate some pretty effective pressure at a very low meter cost. FRCs generate a blue circle around your character.

Hit Confirm Performing an attack, seeing that your attack successfully hit, and then reacting to this information by continuing the combo. That is to say, you "confirm" that your first attack hit before you launch further attacks, and if the attack was blocked instead, you stop and don't follow through with anything else. This is important because, usually, you will be canceling into a move that would be unsafe if it was blocked, so you only want to do it if it won't get you killed. In some games this can be a pretty advanced skill, since you might not have a ton of time to recognize if your attack hit or not. In really fast cases, good players may even employ special tricks, like looking at the opponent's health bar or using special audio cues, to help them react as fast as they can.

ヒット確認 (hitto kakunin) — Lit. hit confirm See video

Assault A short hop towards your opponent, input with forward + D. It's pretty reminiscent of a King of Fighters short hop or hyper hop, although it can also be done in the air. Grounded Assaults will always try to land in front of your opponent (up to a maximum distance traveled), so if you do it from point blank, you'll basically just hop straight up. You'll also gain a bit of GRD for doing one. If you are GRD broken, you can't do Assault at all.

アサルト (asaruto) — Lit. assault See video

High Profile A move that shifts your hurtbox high up so that you can't get hit by moves that attack close to the ground (usually low attacks). This term is really rare, and most people just use the much more common low crush, which means the same thing in the vast majority of instances. Why is low https://glossary.infil.net

profile a super common fighting game term but high profile isn't? It's just the way it worked out, I guess.

Spot Dodge A defensive dodge in platform fighters like Super Smash Bros that keeps your character in place as they lean into the background. Performed by pressing down while you are shielding. While you are spot dodging, you are briefly invincible to all attacks, but you can be hit during your recovery, so you won't be able to abuse it against a smart opponent. While it's known mostly as a Smash mechanic, other games have implemented this as well, from classics like Capcom vs. SNK 2, to Melty Blood (where it's just called "Dodge"), to Kilgore in Killer Instinct.

その場回避 (sonoba kaihi) — Lit. dodge on the spot (for Smash Bros.) 避け (yoke) — Lit. avoid (for Samurai Shodown) Solid A playstyle that involves lots of good decisions rooted in strong game knowledge, without taking lots of unnecessary risks. A solid player will be hard to crack open on defense, and their offense will be safe and stable. Their gameplan is to wait for you to make all the mistakes, and then capitalize with high damage punishes. It takes quite a bit of experience to play solid and win; you have to be good at slowing the game down to the right pace and forcing the opponent into errors, while making few errors yourself.

Astral Heat A special super attack in BlazBlue that instantly kills the opposing character if it lands. You need to be one round away from winning the match, have full super meter, and the opponent has to have less than 35% health remaining in order to use this technique. In BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle, you need to be in Resonance Blaze and meet some other conditions to use this. It shares similarities with Guilty Gear's Instant Kill.

アストラルヒート (asutoraru hīto) — Lit. astral heat See video

Shoto Kill Old school slang for Guile using his forward+HP command normal to punish a shoto after they both do a close-range projectile. From long range, Ryu's Hadouken, a motion input move, tends to slowly overpower Guile's Sonic Boom, since it takes time to charge. But from close range, if both players do a projectile at the same time, Guile will recover much faster than Ryu, and he can always smack him. Forward+HP is usually chosen for its strong damage and long range. See video

Downplayer Someone who constantly says the character they play isn't very good, even though there is plenty of evidence to the contrary. Downplayers tend to focus primarily on all the ways their character might lose, and tend to brush off where their character is strong, often insisting that people can easily avoid or react to all their offensive choices, even when it's not true. The heart of the matter usually comes down to ownership. If players admit they are playing a strong character, they might have to start admitting that when they lose, it's their own fault, and nobody likes that.

Magic Pixel A term used to describe an opponent who has no visible health remaining on their health bar, but are somehow still alive and fighting. It's normally only a big deal if someone is making a huge, unlikely comeback with no life remaining. Especially in games with chip damage, these usually end up being pretty exciting.

ドット (dotto) — Lit. dot (only have a single dot, or pixel, of health left) Gap How long your character has returned to neutral in between blocking (or getting hit by) two attacks. Like all discussions of time in fighting games, it's measured in frames. While you're in neutral, you can take any action, but be careful! If you are only in neutral for a few brief frames, there are some actions you won't want to take, especially if your opponent is looking to do a frame trap. If your character blocks two attacks and there is no gap at all, we'll call that a true block string or say the offense is tight (it's also quite related to the Tekken concept of jailing). Sometimes players will just ask "is there a gap in that string?" just so they know whether they even have the option to do anything except block. Maybe if there's a gap they'll sometimes try a reversal to escape.

隙間 (sukima) — Lit. gap See video

Shadow Counter A defensive technique in Killer Instinct that lets you parry an attack during block stun and launch your own counter-attacking shadow move. It costs one bar of shadow meter to try, and if successful, is always a very strong reversal of offense and defense. You can read more about the mechanic on ki.infil.net if you'd like.

Tech Trap The act of hitting someone trying to air tech during an air combo in an anime game or team game. If you intentionally leave a bit of a gap in your air combo, you can maybe trick someone to air tech at a poor time, and then hit them. It's a bit of an advanced strategy though; as a beginner I'd just focus on trying to not drop your combos. Tech trap is also used in Tekken for situations where you knock your opponent down, and then trick them into getting hit by an unblockable of some sort. You could, for example, simply do a raw unblockable that tracks them in case they try to roll while standing up. Or, you could move in such a way that they will stand up with their back to you, which means they cannot block or tech throws. These situations take some practice and knowledge to set up, but will certainly trick people who don't recognize the situation.

受身狩り, 受け身狩り (ukemi kari) — Lit. receiving body hunting めくりネタ (mekuri neta) — Lit. cross-up trick (Tekken) 壁めくりネタ (kabe mekuri neta) — Lit. wall cross-up trick (Tekken) Neo Max A super in King of Fighters XIII that costs 3 bars to use (as well as all of your Drive Gauge). Depending on the situation, you can cancel regular special moves or supers (in KoF games, they're often called Desperation moves) into a Neo Max attack; when you do this, it's called a "Max Cancel". Throughout the years, King of Fighters' level 3 supers have had many different names, from "Dream Canceling" into a "Super Special Leader Move", to "Climax Canceling" into a "Climax Super Special Move". The particulars of how you can use them in each game differ slightly, but the overall idea is the same; spend 3 bars to do a ton of damage, often by canceling other attacks into it. Like all fighting games, they try to throw as many variations on the term as possible at you, just to see if you can keep up.

Untech Time The amount of hit stun you inflict on an airborne character in an anime game. Often in these games, you will have to manually tech in the air (that is, recover and be able to take actions) once your hit stun runs out. If you don't tech, your opponent can keep comboing you, even though you could have prevented it (Guilty Gear players will call this a Black Beat combo). Untech time, therefore, is the amount of time where your opponent can't manually tech, and follow-up hits are https://glossary.infil.net

guaranteed. In some games, the game automatically forces you to tech whenever hit stun runs out, so there can be no "fake" combos because you didn't tech correctly. In these games, untech time and hit stun are identical.

受身不能時間 (ukemi funou jikan) — Lit. untechable time 2-in-1 Old-school slang for canceling a normal into a special move. The name comes from the fact that you turned 1 hit into 2 hits. I think it's more common to just use the term "cancel" or "special cancel" these days, but you'll come across this term often when reading discussion on older games.

Incoming When your opponent's character in a team game is forced to come on screen while you are free to act. This happens in one of two main ways: from a snapback, or when your opponent's point character dies and the next character in line must jump into the fight. In games like Marvel vs. Capcom, the mixups you can generate "on incoming" are some of the strongest, most difficult to block sequences in all of fighting games. It's a very scary part of the fight and if you can survive the incoming, you'll be in good shape. Some games try to remove the incoming mixup, like Dragon Ball FighterZ, which resets to a "round start" position each time a character is defeated. But you still have to worry about being snapped, so no matter how hard you try, people will find ways to make incoming scary.

出現 (shutsugen) — Lit. appearance Medium Punch One of the six attack buttons in a 6-button fighter. Commonly abbreviated as MP or called strong. Medium punches are often excellent at controlling space in front of your character without taking much risk, and they also tend to be good during close-range offense. Basically, they're usually very good buttons.

中パン or 中P (chū pan) — Lit. medium punch Max Rage The state you enter in Samurai Shodown when your Rage meter fills up from taking damage or Just Defending. During Max Rage, your attacks gain additional damage, one of your special moves gains additional properties (similar to an EX move), and you gain access to a super move called Weapon Flipping Technique, which will empty your rage if you hit with it. Otherwise, your Rage meter will slowly drain over time.

Fast-Faller A character that has high falling speed and just naturally falls faster towards the stage than other characters. The space animals are common examples of fast-fallers. How fast you fall greatly impacts every aspect of the character; on offense, fast-fallers can quickly throw out aerial attacks and land on the stage, and on defense, opponents can often perform unique combos on them (like chain grabs), since they will fall back into range more quickly than other characters. The opposite of a fast-faller is being floaty. Note that this term is distinct from a fast fall.

Turnaround-B A technique in Smash Bros. that causes you to face the other way as soon as you perform a special move. To do this, tap the direction opposite your character's momentum first, then immediately perform your B special move. You will keep your momentum traveling the same way, but you'll point in the new direction before doing the move. Turnaround-Bs have existed in all versions of Smash Bros., and you'll commonly see it on retreating characters, like Melee's Falco doing lasers pointed at your face while moving backwards. The unfortunately named B-Reverse is a very similar technique, except you change the direction you're facing and your momentum. You can even do both at the same time, which is called a wavebounce.

振り向き必殺ワザ (furimuki hissatsu waza) — Lit. turnaround killing technique See video

Salt Intense frustration, typically after losing a game. Fighting game salt is quite pronounced, since its nature as a 1v1 game means you have no one to blame for your loss than yourself. Of course, this doesn't stop most players from blaming the game, their opponent, or their dog for losing anyway.

イライラ (iraira) — Lit. irritation / upset Dust One of the five attack buttons in Guilty Gear. Dust is kind of a multi-purpose button; on the ground, it is used as a universal overhead which can launch the opponent up for an air combo. If you hold down while pressing it, you'll get a sweep attack that hits low. In Guilty Gear Strive, it is also used as part of the throw command. Some famous combos in Guilty Gear use this button, like Sol's dust loop.

8 Way Run The governing method of movement in the Soulcalibur series that lets you freely and easily move in all 8 directions. You can hold any direction and start to run that way; left and right move you closer to or further from your opponent, down and up move you toward and away from the camera respectively (you can also Quick Step vertically), and the diagonals will do both at once. You can freely change your direction while you are moving. Some commands can only be performed out of certain directions in an 8WR, so check your move list carefully. Because there is a brief bit of startup on the movement, if you want to quickly access these 8WR moves from a standstill, you will typically double-tap (and then hold) the direction before pressing your button. 8WAY-RUN (written in English) See video

Jump Cancel Canceling a move with a jump. You'll just stop right in the middle of your normal or special move and immediately leave the ground. Not every game lets you do this; the ones that do tend to be high-octane team games or anime games where aerial combat is much more common than, say, Tekken or Street Fighter. Another common application of this term is when you cancel a jump into something else before you leave the ground, usually in your pre-jump. As long as the game lets you do something during your pre-jump, your attempt to jump will stop and you'll get the grounded action instead. This is commonly how you'll do 360 motions, for instance, but depending on the game you might also transfer the throw invincibility property of your pre-jump to the new move. For example, in SFIII: 3rd Strike, you can use a "high jump cancel" to phase through throws while doing grounded normals or special moves.

ジャンプキャンセル (janpu kyanseru) — Lit. jump cancel ジャンキャン (jankyan) — Lit. abbreviation of ジャンプキャンセル See video

Quick Step A movement option starting in Soulcalibur V that lets you quickly dodge a vertical attack by pressing up or down twice in a row. Unlike 8 Way Run, the standard way of moving in the SC series, this lets you do what is basically a Tekken sidestep, a quick burst of speed in a direction to dodge an attack. It only works in the up or down directions though, so you can't do stuff like Tekken's Korean backdash to put horizontal space between you and your opponent.

Low Profile A move that shifts your hurtbox very low to the ground... so low, in fact, that you can use it to dodge many moves that try to target the middle of a character's body. You can also use this as a verb, like "I can't believe that move low profiles my jab". It's pretty related to a high crush.

低姿勢 (teishisei) — Lit. low pose See video

Snowball Character A character that becomes more deadly the more often they hit you. These characters tend to start the match at their weakest, and once they get their momentum going, they will just get more powerful, like the proverbial snowball rolling down a hill. This is sometimes tied to a specific resource; for example, Killer Instinct's Spinal starts the match without any of his unique "skull" resource, and earns skulls as he hits you. He can then use these skulls to make his offense safer, open up new mixups, and deny you precious resources to fight back, all while continuing to build more skulls. If you can't stem the tide early and let Spinal build up, you might just get totally flattened.

Lockout What happens when you fail a combo breaker in Killer Instinct. You'll get a giant X over your head and you can't try to combo break again until 3 seconds have passed. Meanwhile, your opponent can see that you've locked out and pummel you for huge damage, knowing you can't break. You can get locked out in three ways. If you input a breaker that doesn't match the strength of your opponent's attack, the X will be either blue, yellow, or red with a giant L, M, or H letter inside to indicate the strength you should have used. If you try to break when there is no allowable break window, you'll get a gray X with a clock icon (this is usually called a "timing lockout", since you mistimed the input). And lastly, if you get counter broken, you'll get a purple X over your head. This lockout lasts 4 seconds instead of 3 and you're in for some serious pain.

ロックアウト (rokku auto) — Lit. lockout See video

Reverse Beat Being able to cancel normal attacks into each other in decreasing strength (for example, a medium attack into a light attack). In most games that allow universal canceling of normal attacks into each other, like Magic Series or Gatlings, you can usually only go up in strength, never down. The Under Night and Melty Blood franchises let you also go in reverse order, but https://glossary.infil.net

you can only use a given normal once per string, so you can't loop it infinitely (and in Melty Blood, your combo gets a "Reverse Beat Penalty" and does slightly less damage). It allows for a bit more freeform offense and canceling a riskier heavy attack into a safer light attack; in Under Night, this whole system is called Passing Link.

リバースビート (ribāsu bīto) — Lit. reverse beat Crosscast Veil Off A more powerful version of Veil Off, often shortened to CVO. To activate this, you need to be in Vorpal and you must cancel an attack by pressing A+B+C; if you try to just press these buttons in neutral or while blocking, you'll just get a regular Veil Off instead. In addition to all the normal benefits of Veil Off (such as increased damage and being able to use meter more liberally), the main bonus of CVO is that it will launch the opponent into the air on hit, giving you a nice combo extension that is only possible because you won Vorpal.

クロスキャストヴェールオフ (kurosukyasuto vēru ofu) — Lit. crosscast veil off See video

Daipan Loop An advanced combo for Yun in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike. While in Genei Jin, Yun rapidly performs several heavy punch attacks (or "daipan"s) in a row, each of them kara'ed from a standing medium punch in order to keep Yun moving forward. This combo loop requires very precise timing and spacing, which changes depending on which character you're hitting and whether they are standing or crouching. The damage is massive though, especially on crouching characters, and very advanced Yun players will nuke health bars with this whenever they can. It's similar to another Yun combo called Keeper Jin, but this one does more damage and tends to be the go-to for more situations, if you've practiced the timing.

大Pループ (dai pan rūpu) — Lit. heavy punch loop See video

Timer Scam A strategy where you intentionally bleed time off the clock by activating a super. In some games, a super's screen freeze will not stop the timer, so all you have to do is get a life lead, wait until 3 or 4 seconds are left in the round, then launch your super. The timer will run out while both characters are frozen in place, and you win. Just make sure you know how the timer works in your game of choice, since some games pause the timer during all screen freezes, so this strategy wouldn't work.

Anchor Your final character in a team game. In games with assists, your anchor is often a character that can fight well on their own, or perhaps make the best use of the game's comeback factor, like XFactor. In a game like King of Fighters, your anchor is likely just the character you are most skilled with, giving you the best chance to close out the fight, or the character that can do the most damage with all the super meter that's gone unused from the rest of your team.

大将 (taishou) — Lit. general Stubby How you might describe an attack, usually a normal, that has very short range. Not every shortrange attack is stubby though... it's more about the expectation of the move. Usually it's because you intuitively feel like the move should have longer range — maybe because other characters have similar moves that reach farther than yours, or because the move's hitbox doesn't seem to quite line up with the animation, making it whiff when you think it should hit.

短い (mijikai) — Lit short Secondary An alternate character that isn't as well-practiced as your main, but you've still put in a fair bit of time to learning them. Maybe your main character has some bad matchups so you learn a new character to help deal with those in tournament. Or maybe you just think the character is really cool and you want to learn them. Either one works. You might also hear this called a "pocket"; it's just a character you've got stored away in your pocket for a rainy day.

サブキャラ (sabu kyara) — Lit. sub character Undizzy A Skullgirls system that is designed to prevent long, touch of death combos. After a brief opening section of the combo where you are allowed to do what you want, the game will begin to fill a green bar located under your health bar (called the Drama Meter) for each hit in your combo. Once the bar gets full, the opponent can burst for free, ending your combo. The bar goes down slowly when a combo is not happening, so you cannot do long combos and then land a reset to bypass the Undizzy system. It's the second system in Skullgirls designed to protect against infinite combos, the first being the appropriately-named Infinite Prevention System. While that did a good job preventing true infinites by forcing variation, characters still died to one combo anyway. These two systems put together ensure that combos need to be varied and that they can't be too long. Undizzy was https://glossary.infil.net

アンディジー (andijī) — Lit. undizzy Air Dodge A Smash Bros. mechanic that lets you turn yourself invincible in the air, dodging attacks. The specifics change depending on which version of Smash you're playing, with each game having its own flavor of air dodging which allows for various offensive and defensive strategies. In some games, you can air dodge as many times as you want in the same jump, while in others, you can only air dodge once and must touch the ground before you can do it again. Sometimes you can do other actions in the air after an air dodge, while other times you will start to freefall. In some games, you just air dodge in place, while in others (notably Melee), you can steer your air dodge in a direction. This is the primary mechanic that allows wavedashing to work. The mechanic really takes a unique identity in each game. Melty Blood also uses an Air Dodge system. It makes you briefly invincible like you'd expect, but it's fast and also shifts your aerial momentum slightly, which is a powerful tool for adjusting your angle of approach in an aerial-based fighter like Melty.

空中回避 (kūchū kaihi) — Lit. air evade Burst A mechanic in the Guilty Gear and BlazBlue series that lets you escape a combo. In Guilty Gear, each character will have a Burst Gauge that starts the match full. Once used, it fills up as you get hit, and also slowly over time. You can activate your burst at (almost) any time by pressing the Dust button and one other attack, even while being hit! It's an invincible attack that does 0 damage but will send the opponent away. Bursts come in two flavors, Blue and Gold, indicated by the color of the blast your character emits. Blue bursts happen during those defensive situations (like blocking, during a combo, etc) and if your opponent stops their combo and blocks your burst, you're in for a world of hurt. Gold bursts are done any time you are in neutral, and hitting with it will fill your Tension Gauge to max immediately. Even if your gold burst is blocked, you will be safe, although you'll have wasted your burst and have to wait for it to refill before using it again. Some combos will just naturally avoid the hitbox of a burst attack, which makes them great choices for when you think your opponent might try to burst. These are called, predictably, burst safe combos.

An advanced blocking technique in Mortal Kombat 11. By pressing the block button right before you are attacked, you will briefly flash white and reduce the chip damage you take. Once you've successfully done a Flawless Block, you can spend 1 Defensive Meter and 1 Offensive Meter by inputting up+2 or up+3 to immediately counter-attack, much like you would do as one of your Getup options. This can let you punish certain attacks that you normally wouldn't be able to. This mechanic is similar to Just Defend and Instant Blocking in other games.

フローレスブロック (furōresu burokku) — Lit. flawless block Bat Top A style of joystick used in an arcade stick that looks like a mini baseball bat. Most old joysticks in United States arcades used bat tops, although they still find favor on modern day sticks, especially among Koreans who play Tekken. You may even hear this called a "Korean stick" for this reason. You'll probably grip the stick near the base and use your thumb and fingers to push and pull it as you play.

Kubota Escape A bug in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 that tries to tag your character for a dead character. For this to work, you need to have exactly one dead character on your team and be in neutral. Then, during the screen freeze of an opponent's super, press and hold your first assist button, then perform a QCF followed by pressing and holding your second assist button. Your point character will try to tag out, and then after a few seconds, they will come back into the fight as if they were tagged in. The Kubota Escape was named after Kubo, a Japanese player who found the technique. You can use it to avoid having to block certain supers or team supers which would normally cause a ton of chip damage or setup a gross mixup, and your character might even be able to punish the opponent when they come back in. It's a pretty niche technique not often seen at high-level play, but it can be situationally useful.

It mainly applies to combos for Sol Badguy, but some other characters, like GG Xrd Baiken, can share in the fun too. The execution is different depending on the game, but it usually involves Sol trying to hit with j.D immediately after jumping, and then later again as he is descending. The combo only works in the corner, but it does a lot of damage and looks pretty stylish. The name has been used for the most popular anime game website resource, dustloop.com .

Broken A strategy or character that is so utterly dominant and wins so easily that there is little or no reason to play the game in any other way. Describing a strategy as broken is an extremely strong statement about the balance of the game. Usually, frustrated beginners will throw the word around referring to any time any character hits them with any move, but truly broken strategies or characters are becoming less common in modern games as developers get more experience (and are able to patch any brutal mistakes they do make).

クソ (kuso) — Lit. shitty 壊れ技 (koware waza) — Lit. broken technique Neutral The stage of a fight where neither player is blocking or getting hit by anything, and you are trying to figure out the best way to start or continue your gameplan. There's also a bit of an implicit assumption that the characters are not point blank from each other, so there is some wiggle room to move around and use a wide assortment of attacks. Footsies is one important aspect of playing the neutral game, and you'll often hear people talk about "the neutral". For example, "Ryu loses the neutral in that matchup" means that Ryu has a hard time finding a place on screen where he can start his gameplan without putting himself at risk. Another common use of "neutral" is just any time your character is not blocking, being hit, or knocked down (even if you're point blank), and your character is able to take any action. If your opponent attacks you with a string, you might say "I return to neutral in the middle of that https://glossary.infil.net

string". This implies there's a gap, so you have a chance to try evading or attacking (maybe with a dragon punch). As if that's not enough, neutral can also mean an attack that is neither plus or minus when it's blocked. You'll hear the terms "0 on block", "even on block", and "neutral on block" for this. Both characters will recover at the same time and can attack at the same time, which might lead to trades.

ニュートラル (nyūtoraru) — Lit. neutral 立ち回り (tachi mawari) — Lit. walking around Puppet Character A character that also controls a secondary entity (their "puppet" or "doll") alongside them. Puppet characters tend to be rather advanced, since learning how to separate commands and strategy for two different characters at once can be a little overwhelming at first. Commanding the puppet is often done by holding down or negative edging buttons, so it's often not only a strategic challenge, but difficult execution as well. Examples of puppet characters include Zato in Guilty Gear, Carl in BlazBlue, Chaos in Under Night, and Pom in Them's Fightin' Herds. Characters that summon other entities and mostly let them walk around and do their own thing, like Gargos in Killer Instinct or Jack-O in Guilty Gear, are usually not considered puppet characters, although the distinction isn't that big of a deal.

Tatsu The name of a shoto special move where the character travels forward with their foot extended, usually spinning like a top while doing so. It is sometimes called "Hurricane Kick" in English, but many in the community call it "tatsu", a shortened version of the Japanese name. Tatsus are often briefly projectile invincible which can help you win fireball wars, and they're often good combo enders too. You can use the generic term "tatsu" to refer to a move in any fighting game where the character leads with their foot, flying forward; bonus points if they're spinning and if the command is mapped to quarter circle back. Also, like the term "fireball", you can also just use "tatsu" as a shorthand for "quarter circle back" itself, if you're trying to describe an input quickly (even if the resulting move is not a spinning kick thing).

A state where a character can absorb a hit without entering hit stun, which lets them continue to attack or move. Armor isn't quite as good as being invincible; usually, armor can be thrown, and often a game will also have a set of moves that can break armor directly. And depending on how many hits of armor you have, sometimes super fast multi-hitting moves can get through too. But armor is usually still a powerful property, since for most attacks, it will plow through without trouble. It's often called "super armor" or, if you can take unlimited hits without flinching, "hyper armor".

アーマー (āmā) — Lit. armor See video

Balcony Break Punching someone through a wall that acts as an overhang to a new part of the stage below. It is effectively a combination of a wall break and a floor break, and only possible on a select few stages. Like the other "breaks", you need to use a specific move to break the wall and you'll get to continue the combo afterward. A lot of these stage destruction abilities have extremely similar uses in matches, just different aesthetics to match the various stage locales.

バルコニーブレイク (barukonī bureiku) — Lit. balcony break Shoto An archetype in the Street Fighter series for a character that has a fireball, a shoryuken, and a tatsu. Their main gameplan is to play solid footsies with fireballs and pokes, and then uppercut you when you jump at them. Ryu, Ken, and Akuma are the quintessential shotos that appear in virtually every Street Fighter title, and the subtle variations in their moves make a big difference in how they play. The term is an abbreviation of Shotokan, a style of karate, since it was the main inspiration behind the costume and moves for Ryu in the original Street Fighter title. Outside the most obvious examples, asking whether a given character is a shoto is a common question. Sagat is usually not considered a shoto, since he has multiple fireballs and is focused more on zoning. Sakura is... maybe a shoto? She has all the tools necessary on paper, but her shoryuken is not often used for anti-air. You can ask whether non-Street Fighter characters are shotos, too. For example, Killer Instinct's Jago and Under Night's Hyde fit the shoto archetype well.

道着 (dougi) — Lit. Japanese martial arts uniform Fuzzy Guard A technique where you try to change your block very precisely in order to cover multiple directions (like high/low, or left/right). One of a few possible definitions of the term fuzzy. Let's take a theoretical example; suppose there's a character with a special move that has a high https://glossary.infil.net

and low option at the end. If we check out the frame data, we find that the low attack starts in 20 frames, and the high attack starts in 23 frames. Rather than try to pull off some unlikely reaction to the high/low part, you instead block low for 20 frames, then switch to a high block between frames 21 and 23. If you were successful, this will block both options and you didn't have to think! It does require some pretty precise timing though, and if your opponent can delay the attacks at all, it'll throw everything off and you'll probably get smoked. You also can't fuzzy two options if they can hit at the same time, since there is no window in between the attacks to do the switch. But a fuzzy guard is a player trying to hit this narrow window, where switching your blocking direction will catch multiple possibilities.

ファジーガード (fajī gādo) — Lit. fuzzy guard See video

Pokemon Style A format used in team tournaments where a player must keep playing until they lose. It's possible for a single player to win multiple games in a row and eliminate multiple players from the opposing team. Once a player loses, the team will discuss among themselves at that time who to send up next — since the other team's player and character are known from the previous match, you might want to try and counter pick them. If a single player beats the entire team without losing, they've performed an OCV. This style is typically used in American tournaments (and Smash Bros. Crew Battles), while its alternate format, Waseda style, is used more often in Japanese tournaments.

勝ち抜き (kachinuki) — Lit. tournament, winner stays Challenge To attack your opponent as they are trying to attack you. The most common way this is used is when you attack after you leave block stun, trying to remind your opponent that you're still playing. This isn't always a good idea, but if it works, you might hear "oh, nice challenge". You can also try to intercept someone who's moving in while you're playing neutral. So if your opponent starts dashing in, or if they do some full screen special move like a gorilla, you can press a button to try and hit them before they reach you. In this case, you're "challenging" their approach.

暴れ (abare) — Lit. to rage/act violently (see abare) Plink Dash Pressing two different buttons on nearly consecutive frames (like a plink) to dash around the screen super fast in Marvel vs. Capcom 3. You're allowed to press two buttons at the same time to https://glossary.infil.net

dash in Marvel, and you are also allowed to cancel your dash's animation into a normal attack, which will stop your movement. So to plink dash, you dash, then cancel your movement with a normal (the first button in your plink), then immediately kara cancel this normal into a dash again with the second button of your plink. Plink dashing is usually much faster than a wavedash and you'll see it used at high level a lot.

ずらし押しダッシュ (zurashi oshi dasshu) — Lit. shifting press dash See video

Roll Cancel A famous game-defining bug in Capcom vs. SNK 2 that allowed all special moves to be strike invincible (and in some cases, fully invincible). It only worked in 3 of the 6 Grooves (the ones that allowed a roll), but it was so powerful that it largely defined how the game was played at the tournament level. It worked because rolls have invincibility, but if you were fast, you could kara cancel a roll into any special move of your choice, and it kept the invincibility. Oops.

Tournament Combo An easy, nearly risk-free version of a BnB combo that you will always feel comfortable executing, even when you're playing in a tournament and your nerves are high. Tournament combos will probably do less damage or needlessly spend more resources than your optimal combo, but the value of never dropping it in the clutch means they are great backup plans when you feel your heart racing. Similarly, a "tournament character" is a character that has many safe, relatively low-risk attacks and options so you can maintain stability in a long tournament run. In contrast to this, characters like glass cannons can succeed in tournaments as well, but you might get a few more gray hairs along the way.

Shine A slang term for the down+B Reflector move given to space animals like Fox and Falco in Super Smash Bros. While the move's original intent was reflecting projectiles back at your opponent, people found that shines could be used for way more things. They are incredibly fast, sometimes invincible attacks that can be jump canceled and knock opponents away at difficult angles. This means you can use them for combos, pressure, to gimp an https://glossary.infil.net

opponent, and everything in between. In Melee, if you jump cancel a shine and then wavedash out of it, that's called a "waveshine" and is a common staple of Fox's oppressive rushdown. See video

Ninja A slang term used to refer to any of the male Mortal Kombat characters that dress up in ninja garb of a solid color. This includes Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Ermac, Smoke, and others across the franchise. While it's not really accurate to call it a gameplay archetype like the shoto or the Mishima, they do often share hurtbox similarities which means certain combo paths tend to work on all male ninjas equally well.

忍者 (ninja) — Lit. ninja SHFFL A Smash Bros. Melee technique that lets you perform multiple extremely rapid-fire aerial attacks in a row. SHFFL stands for Short Hop Fast Fall L-Cancel and is pronounced "shuffle". The acronym kinda explains how it works; you do a short hop and input your aerial attack quickly. Then, you fast fall back to the stage so you spend as little time in the air as possible, and L-cancel the recovery so you can act again immediately. Being able to perform this technique flawlessly, multiple times in a row while still moving your character around the stage takes a lot of practice, but you can't break into competitive Melee without learning it.

Passing Link Canceling normals into each other in the Under Night series. These cancels can be extremely freeform, as long as you don't use the same normal more than once in the sequence. You can go from standing to crouching, and unlike Gatlings from Guilty Gear, you can even go in descending order of strength if you want (often called Reverse Beat). Whenever you press a normal in UNI, you're pretty likely to use this system in some way.

パッシングリンク (passhingu rinku) — Lit. passing link See video

Increase The Under Night In-Birth term for charging up certain specific attacks by holding the button down. You'll add extra properties to the move, like more damage, extra frame advantage, or many other move-specific quirks. A lot of heavy normals and Force Functions in UNI have Increase versions, and you'll find them denoted with square brackets, like 5[C]. Melty Blood has a very similar mechanic to this called "Blowback Edge".

Desync The ability to separate the two Ice Climbers characters and control them independently in a round of Super Smash Bros. Normally, the backup Ice Climber will follow the attacks of the main Ice Climber on a short delay, but there are several ways to mess up this delay in order to issue commands to only one climber. It's needed to do stuff like wobbling and will be used for many advanced Ice Climber strategies. You may also hear this term used to talk about similar techniques for other characters, like Rosalina and Olimar. In netcode parlance, a desync happens when two machines playing an online match against each other can't agree on the state of the game, often due to network trouble or other internal engine difficulties. Desyncs will make each player see a different match until, eventually, the games give up and force a disconnect.

切り離し (kiri hanashi) — Lit. tear-off, separate Starter The first hit in a combo. Depending on the game, which attack you use to start a combo can make a pretty big difference in how much damage your combo does! The first hit is not affected by damage scaling and it might change the proration of future hits, so you want to make sure you start with the juiciest, highest damage starter you can whenever possible. The term is most commonly used in anime games or team games like Dragon Ball FighterZ. If you hear a phrase like "this 2M starter is really going to hurt" and you don't know why numbers are getting involved, you'll want to check out numpad notation.

始動技 (shidou waza) — Lit. starting technique [move] スタート ([move] sutāto) — Lit. [move] start Backdash Inputting the back direction twice to dash backwards. In many modern fighting games, you are briefly invincible while backdashing, which can let you escape your opponent's pressure. But even if that's not the case, backdashing is often very useful to suddenly create a good amount of space between you and your opponent. If they attack at the right time, you can make attacks whiff and maybe even score a punish.

The Fighting Game Glossary | infil.net

A mechanic in BlazBlue that lets you cancel any attack (as long as it hits or is blocked) back to a neutral state. It costs 50% of your super meter and is performed by pressing A+B+C. The mechanic is incredibly similar to Guilty Gear's Roman Cancel, and they even have the same "RC" abbreviation! BlazBlue, however, does not have any colored versions that have reduced meter costs or can be performed outside of an attack that makes contact. So it's always analogous to just a regular red Roman Cancel, which lets you extend combos, get creative with your pressure, or keep reversals safe.

ラピッド​キャンセル (rapiddo kyanseru) — Lit. rapid cancel Trade When two opposing attacks hit each other on the same frame. Typically, both characters will animate getting hit at the same time and then the fight continues, although in games with a priority system, some attacks may be programmed to simply beat other attacks in these situations. Super clever fighting game players may even find a way to continue a combo after some trades, if they pressed a heavy attack with a lot of hit stun.

相打ち (aiuchi) — Lit. simultaneously striking one another Pad A console controller. People might say "I play on pad" to indicate they use a PlayStation or Xbox controller instead of an arcade stick or other device like a Hitbox.

パッド (paddo) — Lit. pad Gouki The Japanese name for Akuma. Like with Vega, M. Bison and Balrog, there are some naming differences between some characters in the Japanese and English versions.

豪鬼 (gouki) — Lit. great demon Block String A series of multiple attacks that work well against a blocking opponent. Generally, a block string will be composed of several plus on block or cancelable attacks performed in quick sequence. When blocked, these will slowly push your character out of range and prevent the opponent from counter-attacking, which makes them a very good default, low-risk option when trying to apply offense. Good block strings may even let you hit confirm into more damage if the opponent flinches and stops blocking! Some people think a block string must leave no gaps; that is to say, you will be able to keep attacking your opponent trapped in block stun with multiple attacks until you get pushed too far away. Not everyone uses the term in this way, though — some people are okay using the term even if there are small gaps between some attacks that might frame trap your opponent, as long https://glossary.infil.net

as the gap isn't very big. Because of this, you might hear "true block string" used to refer to a block string that has no gaps, to avoid confusion.

Recapture Any attack that brings the opponent from an airborne state to a grounded state. Recapture is Killer Instinct's version of the restand, and because the KI combo system only lets you perform auto-doubles and linkers against grounded opponents, recaptures are an important way to transition from a juggle combo into these elements.

リキャプチャー (rikyapuchā) — Lit. recapture Concentration A move in Under Night In-Birth where your character focuses in place, rapidly charging up their GRD meter while stealing GRD from their opponent. While you are using Concentration, you won't be fighting, but you can start and stop it quickly, letting you slightly increase your GRD here and there (maybe after a combo ends, or during a knockdown). These small gains might just be enough for you to win the GRD cycle and earn Vorpal!

コンセントレーション (konsentorēshon) — Lit. concentration Hitfall A Rivals of Aether mechanic that lets you fast fall to the ground as soon as you hit your opponent. Specifically, you have the duration of hitstop to tap down on your analog stick to immediately start falling, even if you haven't reached the apex of your jump yet. This is different from how fast falling works in Smash Bros. titles (for example, SHFFLing), and it lets you string together some pretty freeform combos, as long as you keep hitting your opponent and reading their DI. See video

Pushblock An action you can take while blocking which pushes the offensive character away from you. It's largely used in team games with extremely oppressive offense, so that you can turn a successful block into "please get the heck away from me".

character's attack and they will be pushed back about half screen away. In Vampire Savior, you still press buttons to pushblock, but the result is random; you have to press several buttons each time you block to increase your chances of the pushblock happening. And in Blazblue: Cross Tag Battle, pushblocking is strong enough that it costs meter to perform. Pushblocking is not as powerful as it might seem on the surface, since these are games where characters can be anywhere on the screen in one second flat. So while it might briefly stop Magneto from tri-jumping on your head, it won't be long until he's back for more.

アドバンシングガード (adobanshingu gādo) — Lit. advancing guard Half Circle A motion used to input many common special moves that starts with the joystick at left or right, and moves in a semi-circle motion to the other side. The version towards your opponent is 41236 in numpad notation and is commonly abbreviated HCF for "half circle forward". Similarly, 63214 is called HCB for "half circle back". Half circles are somewhat common as inputs in fighting games, but there is no famous half circle move that is often used as a shortcut name, like "fireball" might be for the quarter circle. It's also common for games to have a shortcut for the motion which lets you start at down-back or down-forward, just to make it easier to do from a crouching position. You might think this is getting awfully close to a quarter circle input, so why not just use that command instead? And, well... lots of games would agree with you, as the half circle is falling out of favor in several modern titles.

Input Lag When your button presses happen on screen after a delay, rather than immediately. Input lag can come from a variety of sources, including limitations of the game engine, your big screen TV processing the image before showing it, or even netcode solutions intentionally delaying inputs to compensate for network problems. All games suffer from some inherent input delay, but as long as the delay for all factors combined is around 3 to 5 frames, this is considered acceptable performance by fighting game standards. When the input delay fluctuates during matches, though, that's when it really starts to feel awful.

Heat A powered-up state you can enter in Melty Blood. While in Heat, your super meter will turn into a timer and tick down to zero and you'll be able to perform EX moves at a reduced cost (similar to Under Night's Veil Off mechanic). Importantly, you'll also start healing the recoverable life accrued from past attacks, making it an important method to prolong your health bar. There's also a slightly more powerful version called Blood Heat. In Melty Blood: Type Lumina, you can activate Heat manually by pressing A+B+C any time after you've earned 1 gauge of super meter. The game officially calls activating Heat "Forced Release", but don't worry about this, since everybody will just say Heat instead. You can turn Heat on in neutral, or while you're blocking as a sort of "get off me" move. This activation is both invincible and unblockable (although you can shield it), but it's got short range and if it whiffs, you're going to get punished. You can use your Arc Drive any time while Heat is active, but you'll drain the rest of your time. In Melty Blood: AACC, Heat changes depending on what Moon you've selected. Crescent Moon works largely the same as Type Lumina's Heat mode; it is the only Moon that can manually activate Heat without needing full super meter. The other two Moons must fill their super gauge all the way before Heat is an option. In Half Moon, you'll automatically enter Heat at this time (sometimes called "Auto-Heat"). In Full Moon, you'll first enter MAX mode at full gauge, which starts to drain your super meter. You can now enter Heat by performing a powerful Roman Cancel-like technique called Initiative Heat, or just pop your Blood Heat raw instead.

ヒート (hīto) — Lit. heat ヒート状態 (hīto joutai) — Lit. heat status See video

Juggle The act of comboing an airborne opponent while you are on the ground. Moves that work well in juggles tend to launch the opponent high into the air and keep them close to the offensive player, so they can be hit again as they fall to the ground. As with a lot of fighting game terminology, the line between a juggle and an air combo is sometimes up for debate, so you may see the term used to describe any situation where you're comboing someone in the air.

空中コンボ (kūchū konbo) — Lit. air combo See video

Staircase Combo An air combo that either steadily increases or decreases in height, like you were bounding up or down a set of stairs. Usually you end up repeating the same sequence of attacks in order to bring them up or down the staircase. They exist largely in team games or anime games, since those are https://glossary.infil.net

Fireball A specific type of projectile that travels horizontally and is traditionally input using a quarter circle command. Ryu, Sagat, Jago and Sol all throw fireballs, and they are perhaps the most iconic special moves in all of fighting games. Beams that travel the whole screen instantly and Sonic Booms that require a charge motion aren't usually called fireballs. "Fireball" can even be used as shorthand for "quarter circle forward", if you're trying to quickly describe a special move input. "The input for your command dash is fireball + kick" would be a valid sentence, for example.

波動拳 (hadouken) — Lit. wave motion fist See video

Limit Break A comeback mechanic in Dragon Ball FighterZ that increases your damage by 20% when you have only one character left. This damage boost is automatically applied and doesn't have a time limit; you get it as soon as you're on your last character, and you keep it until you die. This can even be amplified a bit further if you still have access to Sparking. Because comebacks in DBFZ are pretty hard to make normally, this added juice is supposed to make your last character a bit scarier and help the match not be a foregone conclusion.

リミットブレイク (rimitto bureiku) — Lit. limit break K.O. Draining a character's health bar to zero, causing a knockout and ending the round. Pretty much every fighting game round will end in someone getting KOed, although you will occasionally see some time out or ring out victories as well. K.O. (kē ō) — Lit. k.o.

Custom Combo A mechanic that lets players repeatedly cancel normals and specials into each other with no limitation. The mode will also give you unlimited juggle potential so you can bounce the opponent around as much as you like. Usually custom combos are possible when you activate a super, and then you get a limited time to perform your creative combo of choice. They aren't so common in modern games, but Street Fighter Alpha, Capcom vs. SNK 2, and Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike all had powerful custom combo options.

Historically, custom combos have been pretty broken in almost every game they've been in. They usually lead to extremely high damage, guaranteed guard crush moments, and turn the activating character into an offensive powerhouse that is brutal to try and stop. Some custom combos even get cool names, like Paint the Fence.

Faultless Defense Cancel Kara canceling the startup of a Guilty Gear move directly into Faultless Defense. There are a few reasons you'd want to do this, but one common use is to change your air trajectory and try to trick your opponent with a different angle of approach. For example, Faust in Guilty Gear Xrd can FDC his air drill attack. This attack would normally send him back towards the ground, but when FDCed, it stops the upward momentum of his jump he can immediately attack with an air normal. This is such a common strategy for Faust that people call this a "Drill Cancel". You can also FD Cancel while running forward; you might hear this called FD Brake, since it stops your run momentum immediately. In Guilty Gear Strive, you can use FDC after air dashing at your opponent as a method to fall towards the ground without attacking. While air dashing, press your two FD buttons normally; the game will apply a normal attack for one frame, which forces your character to start descending, and then you'll begin FDing like normal on the next frame. You can then attack again later while you're falling, except now you'll be closer to the ground and can hit your opponent with new moves that would otherwise be too high to reach. It's a good way to change your air trajectory while still letting you choose another attack later on.

Hellsweep A Tekken attack typically belonging to Mishimas that hits low and is so fast that it's unreactable, but is big time punishable if it gets blocked. Some Hellsweeps knock down and maybe lead to a combo, while others leave the opponent standing but lead to more mixups, but either way, they are powerful threats and a core part of a Mishima's gameplan. In the English move list, you'll see this called Spinning Demon and it's an option you can do out of a Crouch Dash, the move that https://glossary.infil.net

lets Mishimas wavedash and perform electrics, so it's kind of extra scary. Because players tend to default to a standing block in Tekken, these fast lows really add a huge wrinkle to the offense, even if they don't do a ton of damage. While Mishimas are the source of the namesake, you can use it to refer to any low move that is super fast and dangerous. This is in contrast to the Snake Edge, which is also an unsafe low, but is slow and always leads to huge damage.

Falling Speed How fast your character moves downward while in mid-air. Every Smash Bros. character has an inherent falling speed, from the super quick fast-fallers to the slower floaty characters, and by pressing down while in the air, you will fast fall and accelerate your falling speed instantly to its character-specific maximum value.

落下速度 (rakka sokudo) — Lit. falling speed Cross-up Attacking your opponent immediately after changing which horizontal side you are facing, usually by jumping over them. Because blocking requires holding the direction away from your opponent in most fighting games, cross-up attacks will force players to quickly switch their blocking direction from left to right or vice versa, or else they will get hit. It most commonly describes jumping attacks that will hit on top of the opponent's head, sometimes so ambiguously that the defender must guess which direction to block. You might also find other ways to get on the other side of your opponent, like walking under them while they are above you in the air, which we call a cross-under. These are all variations on the standard twooption mixup called the 50/50.

Distortion Drive What BlazBlue calls its supers. Like Guilty Gear's Overdrives, they're fairly standard as far as supers go, taking 50% of your super meter and usable in a wide variety of situations. Games just love to make sure they reinvent terminology for basic concepts each time.

ディストーションドライブ (disutōshon doraibu) — Lit. distortion drive Party Starter A specific move a character wants to land that lets them start scary offensive pressure or a nasty vortex. It might be something as innocent as a sweep or a throw, where that specific knockdown gives the character a whole bunch of scary mixups. Usually, people will try to fish for this move, since the reward for hitting it is just so incredibly high. Most snowball characters will have a party starter that you want to avoid at all costs. You don't want to let them nudge that snowball over the cliff.

Numpad Notation A way to describe joystick inputs using numbers instead of letters or words. Each direction is mapped to a number, following the same layout as a keyboard's numpad. For example, holding down is "2", and if you wanted to talk about a crouching medium kick, you'd call it "2MK". Or, holding forward and pressing punch would be "6P" (a common Guilty Gear anti-air). You can also describe special move inputs this way. For example, a standard quarter circle forward would be 236, and a DP motion would be 623. Note that numpad notation always assumes you are facing right; QCF is always 236, no matter which way your character is pointing. Numpad notation can be used for pretty much every game, although the Mortal Kombat and English-speaking Tekken communities use numbers for attack buttons (rather than directions) in their notation, so be careful of that. In particular, it is preferred among fans of anime games since it is language independent, letting people share combo notation and strategies between cultures in ways that "qcf " can struggle to do. It also lets you describe moves or techniques with wacky inputs very precisely, which makes it versatile and succinct. While some people find it easier to parse notation when English abbreviations are used, there's no denying that numpad notation has some strong advantages. You should be comfortable understanding both methods, especially since it only takes a few minutes to learn.
