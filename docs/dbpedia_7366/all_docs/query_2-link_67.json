For bicycles, see Outline of bicycles.\n\nThe following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to cycling:\n\nCycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the activity of using / riding bicycles, (at least partially) human-powered, wheeled vehicles (typically by foot pedalling),[1] for purposes including transport, recreation, social interaction, exercise, sport, therapy, other purposes,[2] or any combination thereof.[3]\n\nPersons engaged in cycling are called cyclists,[4] bikers, or sometimes bicyclists.[5] They typically either dress for where they are going, or for the cycling, sometimes having another set of clothing with them, or arranged.\n\nApart from regular two-wheeled bicycles, cycling also includes riding unicycles, tricycles, quadricycles, balance bikes, and other similar human-powered wheeled vehicles (HPVs).\n\nSome bicycles are sold with (electric) motors (e-bikes), or other motor assistance.\n\nCycling is practiced either solo on the vehicle, or with company, including passengers, riding in front,[6] or sitting on the cycle's luggage carrier, or little children and/or pet animals in appropriate seats or such fixed to the bike, or occasionally actually riding with more than one person, cooperatively, on anything from a simple twin / tandem bicycle, to a multi-person party bike."
