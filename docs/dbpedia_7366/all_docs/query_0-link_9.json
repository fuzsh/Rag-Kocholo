        "text": "Newcomers and Youngsters\n\nBaseball debuted as a full medal discipline having appeared as an exhibition (or demonstration) sport at six previous Games. Badminton and women’s judo were also added to the Olympic programme, and Spain’s coxswain in the eights, 11-year-old Carlos Front, became the youngest Olympic competitor since 1900.\n\nMemorable Champions\n\nMen's basketball became open to all professionals and the U.S. sent a \"Dream Team\" of superstars, including Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and Larry Bird. Needless to say, they dominated the event and won gold. Another impressive performer was gymnast Vitaly Scherbo, who won six golds, including four in one day.\n\nAfrican Hope\n\nIn the last lap of the 10,000m final, Derartu Tulu of Ethiopia darted into the lead and went on to win. At the finishing line, she waited for her opponent Elana Meyer, a white South African. They set off hand-in-hand for a victory lap that symbolised hope for a new Africa.\n\nNOCs: 169\n\nAthletes: 9,356 (2,704 women, 6,652 men)\n\nEvents: 257\n\nVolunteers: 34,548\n\nMedia: 13,082 media (5,131 written press, 7,951 broadcasters)\n\nHockey\n\nAndreas Keller of the gold medal-winning German field hockey team was the third generation of his family to win a medal in the event. His grandfather, Erwin, earned a silver medal in 1936 and his father, Carsten, a gold in 1972.\n\nYugoslavia\n\nThe only controversy concerned Yugoslavia, which was the subject of United Nations sanctions because of its military aggression against Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the end, Yugoslavia was banned from taking part in any team sports, but individual Yugoslav athletes were allowed to compete as \"independent Olympic participants\". Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina competed as separate nations for the first time.\n\nRowing\n\nIn the men's coxed eights rowing final, Canada beat Romania by less than 30 centimetres—one of the closest rowing final in Olympic history.\n\nAthletics\n\nAnother close contest was the women's 100m sprint. Merlene Ottey (JAM) finished only six-hundredths of a second behind the winner, Gail Devers (USA), and yet she ended up in only fifth place.\n\nThe Truce\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) launched an appeal for the observance of the Olympic Truce for the first time.\n\nBaseball\n\nBaseball, which had appeared as an exhibition (or demonstration) sport at six Olympic Games, finally achieves medal status. During the 95th Session of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), held in Puerto Rico in 1989, it was decided that demonstration sports would be eliminated definitively from the 1996 Atlanta Games onwards.\n\nUp until the 1992, Olympic Games (Barcelona and Albertville), the Organising Committees for the Olympic Games (OCOGs) could integrate demonstration sports into the Olympic programme. However, the organisation of these demonstrations created a lot of extra work for the OCOGs, which had to provide services that were almost identical to those for the sports on the Olympic programme.\n\nNew on the Programme\n\nBadminton and women's judo are also added to the Olympic programme.\n\nRowing\n\nSpain's coxswain in the eights, 11-year-old Carlos Front, was the youngest competitor in the Olympic Games since 1900.\n\nCeremonies\n\n25 July 1992, Barcelona. Acts at the Opening Ceremony. Puppets with the colours of the Games' logo.\n\nOfficial Opening of the Games by:\n\nHis Majesty King Juan Carlos I\n\nLighting the Olympic Flame by:\n\nAntonio Rebollo (paralympic archer)\n\nOlympic Oath by:\n\nLuis Doreste Blanco (sailing)\n\nOfficials' Oath by:\n\nEugeni Asencio (water polo)"
