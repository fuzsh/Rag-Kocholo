        "text": "The road cycling program was the same as in 1960 and 1964 with an individual road race and a team time trial. The individual road race in Mexico was a mass start race of 196.2 km. over the Satellite Circuit. The team time trial was 104 km., with four-man teams, also on the Satellite Circuit. Italy’s Pierfranco Vianelli won the individual gold medal while the Netherlands defended their Olympic title in the team time trial.\n\nBoxing had been a men-only sport at the Olympics since 1904, but the first women finally competed in the sport at the 2012 Olympics in London."
