        "text": "Para cycling is cycling for people with impairments resulting from a health condition (disability). Para athletes with physical impairments either compete on handcycles, tricycles or bicycles, while those with a visual impairment compete on tandems with a sighted ‘pilot’.\n\nPara cycling is divided into track and road events, with seven events in total.\n\nRoad Events\n\nPara cycling road events are held for men and women and for all functional classes:\n\nRoad race (men and women)\n\nIndividual time trial (men and women)\n\nHandcycling relay\n\nTrack Events\n\nPara cycling track events are held for men and women, but only for the functional classes within the Standard Bicycle ‘C1 – 5’ and Tandem ‘B’ classifications:\n\nTeam sprint (men and women, mixed event)\n\n500m time trial (men and women) or kilometre time trial (men and women)\n\nIndividual pursuit (men and women)\n\nThe track events are divided into time trial, pursuit and sprint events. The race format and distances vary according to the event.\n\nThe International Federation governing Para cycling is the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI).\n\nPara cycling was developed in the 1980s, starting with visually impaired riders who competed on a tandem with a sighted partner.\n\nThe sport had its Paralympic debut in the New York 1984 Paralympic Games. There were only 22 Para cyclists (including just 2 women) in 7 events. Over the next four Paralympic Games organisers added further events and participation grew fast.\n\nIn Atlanta 1996 track cycling was included, and additional impairments in various functional categories were allowed. Handcycling was included for the first time in the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games as an exhibition event, becoming a medal event 4 years later in Athens 2004. That year, there were more than 200 Para cyclists at the Paralympics."
