        "text": "Sir Christopher Andrew Hoy, MBE (born 23 March 1976) is a British racing driver and former track cyclist who represented Great Britain at the Olympics and World Championships and Scotland at the Commonwealth Games. Hoy is eleven-times a world champion and six-times an Olympic champion. With a total of seven Olympic medals, six gold and one silver, Hoy is the second most decorated Olympic cyclist of all time. With his three gold medals in 2008 Summer Olympics, Hoy became Scotland's most successful Olympian, the first British athlete to win three gold medals in a single Olympic Games since Henry Taylor in 1908, and the most successful Olympic cyclist of all time. After winning a further two gold medals (in the keirin and team sprint) at the 2012 Summer Olympics, Hoy has won more Olympic gold medals (six) than any other British athlete along with Jason Kenny, and more total medals (seven) than any except fellow cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins.\n\nLaura Trott, OBE is an English track and road cyclist who specialises in the team pursuit and omnium disciplines. She is the inaugural Olympic champion in both events. Representing Great Britain, Trott is the reigning Olympic and European champion in both events, as well as the reigning four-time world champion in the team pursuit, and a former world champion in the omnium. She is the most successful rider, male or female, in the history of the European Track Championships, with seven titles as of October 2014. A rider for the Wiggle Honda professional cycling team, in 2014 Trott won the British championship in the road race, winning the senior and under-23 titles simultaneously.\n\nJason Francis Kenny, (born 23 March 1988) is a British track cyclist, specialising in the individual and team sprints. After winning multiple World and European Junior titles in 2006 and achieving medals in the under 23 European championships in 2007, Kenny was selected ahead of Ross Edgar to compete for Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Along with Chris Hoy and Jamie Staff, he won a gold medal in the team sprint, breaking the world record in the qualifying round. He finished behind team-mate Chris Hoy in the final of the individual sprint, gaining a silver medal. In January 2012, he gained his first world championship title, after Grégory Baugé's results were nullified after a backdated 12-month ban for missing a drugs test, and the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) promoted Kenny to the gold medal. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, he won gold medals in both the team sprint and in the individual sprint, beating Baugé in the final. At the 2016 Summer Olympics Kenny repeated his 2012 wins in the Team Sprint and the Individual Sprint, and also won a Gold Medal the Keirin, Kenny is the joint holder of the highest number of Olympic Golds for a British athlete (6) alongside fellow track cyclist Chris Hoy. Kenny's six Olympic gold medals place him the joint 25th in terms of gold medals won in the modern Summer Olympic games since 1896 with only Michael Phelps (23) and Usain Bolt (8) winning more since the Games of the new millennium in 2000.\n\nLutz Heßlich (born 17 January 1959) is a former racing cyclist from East Germany.He competed for East Germany in the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow, Soviet Union in the individual sprint event where he finished in first place. He missed the 1984 Summer Olympics due to the Soviet led boycott but returned to the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea where he won a second gold medal in the individual sprint. In October 1986, he was awarded a Star of People's Friendship in gold (second class) for his sporting success."
