        "text": "Away from the day-to-day, and year-to-year grind of the racing circuit, it’s above all the quadrennial aspect of competing in the Olympic Games that makes a gold medal so highly prized.\n\nA world champion is made every season, but the opportunity to become Olympic or Paralympic champion might only come about once in a career.\n\nThe stars must align: the rider arriving in their peak years and form, with the course a fit for their skillset.\n\nWhile some riders on this list, such as Tom Pidcock and Katie Archibald, are going for gold again, others have yet to have their moment.\n\nWe profile 9 riders, across all disciplines, whose performances you shouldn’t miss at the Paris Olympics, including Lotte Kopecky, the Belgian favourite for the women’s road race, and Mathieu van der Poel.\n\nLotte Kopecky\n\nExcelling on the road and the track, Belgium’s stellar talent Lotte Kopecky is destined for a big Olympic summer.\n\nThe 28-year-old Team SD Worx-Protime rider is the 2023 World road race champion, and a six-time World track champion across the Madison, points race and elimination events.\n\nKopecky missed out on a medal at Tokyo 2020 after finishing fourth in the road race, but she means business in Paris, even skipping the Tour de France Femmes in August to prioritise Olympic glory.\n\n“The Tour is every year, while the Olympic Games are only once every four years,” she said earlier this year.\n\nKopecky – a thrill-seeker who enjoyed a skydive before the UAE Tour this year – could compete in the omnium, Madison, road race and time trial, but she is likely to refine her plans as the Olympics draws closer.\n\nShe is a gold-medal hope for the multi-event omnium, but she believes the road race is her best shot: as the 2023 Tour of Flanders winner, she knows that Paris’ Belgian-style course will suit her.\n\nAnd the small team sizes in Paris (four riders) will level the playing field against strong cycling nations such as the Netherlands.\n\nAfter wins at Paris-Roubaix and Strade Bianche in 2024, Kopecky heads to Paris at the top of the world rankings.\n\nMathieu van der Poel\n\nAt the prime age of 29, and in dazzling race-winning form, the ‘Flying Dutchman’ van der Poel is a hot favourite for the men’s road race in Paris.\n\nLast year, he won the World Championships road-race title in Glasgow, only 14 days after the end of the Tour, and he hopes for a similarly successful summer.\n\n“The Olympic road race falls two weeks after the Tour and that is actually ideal,” he said.\n\n“You can compare that with the World Championships in Glasgow, where I also achieved a very good level by riding the Tour earlier.”\n\nVan der Poel has backed up his glorious 2023 season with victories in the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix in 2024.\n\nThe ultra-versatile rider has also sensibly withdrawn from the Olympic mountain bike event to focus on the road.\n\nWith key rival Wout van Aert fighting back to form following injury in the spring, 2024 could be van der Poel’s summer.\n\nAnd as the fiery Classics-style course in Paris features explosive climbs and cobbled ascents, the Dutchman has the perfect skillset to attack.\n\nSarah Storey\n\nNow 46, Dame Sarah Storey is Britain’s most successful Paralympian of all time.\n\nAmazingly, Paris 2024 will be the ninth Paralympics for the Cheshire-born rider, who appeared in her first Games as a swimmer in 1992, aged 14 – back in the era when CDs were starting to overtake cassette tapes in popularity.\n\nShe is heading to Paris 2024 four years shy of her 50th birthday.\n\nStorey was born without a functioning left hand after her arm became entangled in the umbilical cord in the womb.\n\nAs a child, she excelled at swimming and went on to win five Paralympic gold medals in the pool.\n\nShe switched to cycling in 2005 and has amassed 12 Paralympic gold medals and 27 world titles across the road and track.\n\nThe 46-year-old mother of two is aiming to retain the three gold medals she won in the pursuit C5, road race C5 and time trial C5 in Tokyo.\n\n“It would be amazing to win again and say I have won medals at nine consecutive summer Games,” she admitted this year.\n\n“I don’t think anyone in any sport has ever done that.”\n\nTom Pidcock\n\nParis 2024 will give road cycling fans a rare chance to witness the punchy, powerful off-road alter ego of multi-talented Ineos Grenadiers roadie Tom Pidcock.\n\nStraight after his scheduled appearance at the Tour de France, the Yorkshire star, aged 24, is bidding to defend the Olympic cross-country mountain bike gold medal he won at Tokyo 2020 – Britain’s first gold in this discipline.\n\nAn outrageously talented rider who competes in road, cyclo-cross and mountain bike events, the 5ft 7in pocket rocket has the sort of compact but powerful physique that suits cross-country MTB races on twisty, obstacle-riddled courses.\n\nDespite committing to ride the Tour, which finished only eight days before the MTB event starts on 29 July, Pidcock has made the defence of his gold a priority.\n\n“The Olympics transcends cycling,” he said this year.\n\n“After Tokyo, people and press were turning up at my parents’ house and I was on the front page of every newspaper.”\n\nAlthough now best known as a road racer, Pidcock won the MTB XCO (cross-country) World Championships in Scotland last year. He then secured a dominant victory in his first UCI MTB XC World Cup race of 2024 in the Czech Republic in May.\n\nPidcock will attack the tricky Olympic course at Elancourt Hill with his usual fearlessness and flair.\n\nKatie Archibald\n\nKatie Archibald is thinking bigger. The Scottish track queen earned a team pursuit gold at Rio 2016, followed by a Madison gold and a team pursuit silver at Tokyo 2020.\n\nHowever, at Paris 2024, the 30-year-old former swimmer has a chance of a golden hat-trick in the team pursuit, Madison and omnium.\n\nShe has already proven it is possible, having won all three events at the 2023 European Championships, then again at the Track Nations Cup in Canada in April this year – the last competitive track event before Paris.\n\n“I’m the only person to have been world champion in all three of those disciplines,” she says.\n\nA successful summer would be particularly poignant for Archibald after a traumatic few years.\n\nHer partner, the Scottish cyclist Rab Wardell, died tragically aged 37, following a sudden cardiac arrest in bed in August 2022.\n\n“I can’t describe this pain,” Archibald tweeted at the time.\n\nA hat-trick of golds would also be an historic sporting achievement. Archibald would become the first British woman to win three gold medals at a single Games.\n\nChris Hoy (2008), Jason Kenny (2016) and swimmer Henry Taylor (1908) are the only Brits to have won three gold medals at one Olympics. As Archibald has said: “I have every opportunity to achieve something great.”\n\nDemi Vollering\n\nThere aren’t many things the all-conquering Dutch rider Demi Vollering hasn’t won, but an Olympic gold medal is one of them.\n\nLast year, the Team SD Worx-Protime rider’s race victories included the Tour de France Femmes, Liège-Bastogne-Liège, Amstel Gold Race, La Flèche Wallonne and Strade Bianche.\n\nAnd although the 27-year-old has had to settle for some second and third places in 2024, she won the La Vuelta Feminina, Vuelta a Burgos and Itzulia races in May, finding her form just in time for Paris.\n\n“After a difficult spring, this is confirmation that the form is good,” Vollering declared after the races.\n\nVollering, who used to work as a florist and relaxes by taking her dog Flo for a bike ride in a backpack, will be a serious contender in Paris.\n\nShe is part of a talented Dutch squad, which includes lead road-race rider Lorena Wiebes, Ellen van Dijk and Marianne Vos.\n\nVollering’s first shot will come in the time trial on 27 July, but she will get another crack in the road race on 4 August.\n\nFew would bet against the 2023 Vélo d’Or winner following in the tyre marks of other Dutch Olympic champions, including Anna van der Breggen (2016) and Vos (2012) on the road and Annemiek van Vleuten (2020) in the time trial.\n\nRemco Evenepoel\n\nBelgian speed machine Remco Evenepoel, 24, is planning to hit the Paris 2024 time trial in the fastest form of his life.\n\n“I need to perform at the highest level that I’ve ever done,” he said earlier this year.\n\nIn 2023, the Flanders-born racer became the youngest-ever World time trial champion, aged 23.\n\nNow he fancies his chances on a fast, flat Paris time trial course that's built for purists.\n\nHaving won a World road race title in 2022, Liège-Bastogne-Liège (2022, 2023) and the Vuelta (2022), he will be a threat in the Paris road race, too.\n\nLook out for aero innovations. The Soudal Quick-Step rider sported a Specialized TT5 helmet with an aero ‘head sock’, until the feature was banned in April.\n\nAnd the Belgian cycling federation has built a life-sized Evenepoel ‘doll’ to help refine his skinsuit in wind tunnel tests.\n\nThe Belgian suffered a broken collar bone and scapula at April’s Itzulia Basque Country, but claims he didn’t lose much fitness. He also looks in good form having finished third at the Tour de France, claiming the best young rider's white jersey in the process.\n\nRivals such as Britain’s Josh Tarling, Italy’s Filippo Ganna and reigning Olympic TT champion Primož Roglič of Slovenia will hope he’s wrong.\n\n“It’s a dream to leave Paris with two medals,” said Evenepoel.\n\nBethany Shriever\n\nWatching British BMX racing star Bethany Shriever storm to gold on the chaotic 400m-long BMX track in Tokyo was one of the golden moments of the last Olympics.\n\nThe Leytonstone-born racer, who took up BMX when she was eight, had to fund her own qualification campaign to reach Tokyo 2020, relying on family support and crowdfunding.\n\nShe then had to overcome Mariana Pajón of Colombia in the final, who was gunning for a third Olympic title.\n\nBut after an electrifying dash over the jumps and banked corners of the track, she won gold, finishing only 0.9 seconds ahead of Pajon, before almost collapsing from the leg-flaming effort.\n\nOn the road to Paris 2024, the 25-year-old has received Lottery funding, and she confirmed her form with a second World BMX racing title in 2023.\n\nBut she suffered a fractured collar bone at the BMX Racing World Championships in Rock Hill, South Carolina, in May, two months before the Olympics.\n\nShe faces major competition in Paris from former world champion Laura Smulders of the Netherlands and reigning world champion Alise Willoughby of America.\n\nBut Shriever knows what it takes to win an Olympic final. “I’ve got one more opportunity,” she posted after her recent crash. “And it’s a big one.”\n\nHarrie Lavreysen\n\nWith his muscular physique and raw power, Dutch track sprinter Harrie Lavreysen is the Incredible Hulk on wheels.\n\nThe 27-year-old is a serious watt monster, with a mind-blowing peak output of 2,680 watts.\n\n“I was born with strong legs,” Lavreysen once declared, and he can squat over 200kg – more than double his 92kg bodyweight.\n\nA former BMX racer who switched to track in his junior career, he will be a fan favourite at Paris 2024.\n\nLavreysen is the dominant force in world sprinting, having won gold in the individual and team sprints at Tokyo 2020 and bronze in the keirin.\n\nIn Paris, he is gunning for a hat-trick of golds to match the three golds he won at the European Championships in January.\n\nHis imperious form makes him the best men’s track sprinter since Britain’s Jason Kenny.\n\nLavreysen is the Usain Bolt of the velodrome and his Paris races will be a thrill to watch."
