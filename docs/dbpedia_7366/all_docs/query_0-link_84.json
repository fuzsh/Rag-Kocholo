        "text": "Editor's note: This story was originally published in 2016. It's been updated and edited with new information ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.\n\nVermonters have left tracks in the Winter Olympics snow for decades.\n\nThe state’s outsized influence on the Games is long-standing and well-documented. The history of Vermonters in the Summer Olympics, though lacking the depth of the quadrennial cold-weather competition, is rich and varied as well.\n\nSince 1900, 27 Vermonters have participated in the Summer Games, according to research by the Free Press and Burlington resident Matt Moore, who has compiled his own list on a google doc.\n\nAcross more than a dozen sports, they have collected 14 medals, including six golds. The haul includes University of Vermont legend Albert Gutterson’s record-setting long jump in Stockholm 1912, equestrian Tad Coffin’s double-gold performance in Montreal and, most recently, equestrian Laura Graves’ team dressage bronze in Rio.\n\nWhile thorough, the following list is a work in progress. The defining credential for Vermonters is to have spent a significant time in Vermont during youth.
