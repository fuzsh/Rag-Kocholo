        "text": "\"LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN!!\"\n\n\"I have been thinking about this for years! Oregon should absolutely host the games. I have thought that one way to do it would be to partner with Seattle and Eugene giving impetus to (finally) building a high-speed rail corridor from Vancouver BC to Eugene. This would be a regional and international economic game changer, creating a socio-economic \"\"state\"\" on par with California. Seattle of course would host the water based sports but swimming and diving would be hosted in Portland in The Schollander Aquatic Center. Â We could absolutely build the world class stadium that we need for our MLS team. I'd place that on the site of Lincoln Â High School. But the waterfront would be great too. Too many ideas to communicate here. Â An all Oregon Olympics would be amazing.\"\n\n-Rick Potestio\n\nI believe in your vision for bringing the Olympics to PDX. I think it will be great for the city and community.\n\n-Kate Lowe\n\n\"Love it! Portland could be a great location for the Olympics, and we have so many amazing things to share with the world!\"\n\n-Sundi Musnicki\n\n\"This is called thinking big and yeah it might sound a little crazy, but this is how transformative change happens. I love the vision and would love to see this amazing place we call home take center stage in 2028!\"\n\n-Shaun Fagen\n\n\"I, as a Portland native (NE 18th & Fremont) am on board with this initiative. As a native, I've lost track of my city's identity, this is a focus we all can get on board with. And I believe the leadership and inspiration behind this wide-angle thinking is a perfect focus for us a community of various backgrounds. And I know for a fact this is not something that was thought up as a response to the Rio 2016 game and all that goes with that. This idea is from someone who could actually lead this effort. Oregon as a state has every venue needed. Â While I am a bigger fan of the winter O's. Oregon is best suited for Summer, take a look out your door it's a beautiful time of year. And as a life long Sailor, Cascade Locks is already a world class Sailing venue, check out CGRA.org. Don't forget about Track and Field and the born heritage behind that.\"-Brian Manske\n\n\"The ideas is awesome. The website is great. Â The only issue I see (and you guys surely see as well), is if L.A. gets the 2024 games, then it's over...\"\n\n\"I would love for Portland to have a grand vision and goal for once.\"\n\n\"Great idea! Â\n\n2 small problems:\n\n1.) The Olympic Stadium will (hopefully) built way after a baseball stadium is built and team has started playing in Portland. An Olympic Stadium as an upgrade for the Timbers might be a better angle.\n\n2.) The movement infrastructure is horrible in Portland. I know the pitch will be public transportation and the plethora of biking options, but the truth is visitors don't share that value. They will want auto-transportation...and Portland's infrastructure is massively behind in capacity improvements.\n\nThe positive points far out weigh these two negatives...like connecting the 3 major universities to the games. That is a very good idea. Maybe I haven't gotten to it yet (I've pursued the site for a couple minutes), but do you have suggestions where the new Olympic venues would be located?\"\n\n-Greg Baker\n\n\"I love the ideas of learning from past Olympics mistakes and successes. And I love the idea of improving Portland public transit, airport, and increasing the lower income housing.\"\n\n\"Fantastic idea - Oregon has so many incredible venues, it would be a tremendous success.\"\n\n\"I love the idea of making the 2028 Olympics a Portland/Oregon Olympic games. In fact, while building new facilities will be required for some thing, I honestly believe most of the infrastructure is already in place and I would love to talk more about this! Oregon is perfect for the Summer Games, and being a part of this would be amazing.\"\n\n\"Love it, would love to help you guys share your vision.\"\n\n\"I was thinking almost the exact same thing as I watched the Olympic trials, what can we do to make a competitive bid for the Olympics to be brought here?\"\n\n\"Sounds great!\"\n\n\"I do worry a bit that the infrastructure (roads, public transit, etc.) might not be able to support that amount of influx over the Olympics by today's level development -- but I would hope that 10 years is enough time to develop the infrastructure necessary to do so. It would also provide a much needed benefit to Portland that is already beginning to experience infrastructural problems due to increase residency.\"\n\n\"I think it can help to transform Oregon.\"\n\n\"Keep the Olympic stadium at 75,000 and bring the NFL instead. I'm a fan of the idea either way, I love baseball too. I support this plan based on the stadium alone, the Olympics would be nice, but I want to go to football or baseball games long after they are a memory.\"\n\n\"Yes please!\"\n\n\"I think that it is a great plan, Oregon is very driven by the few professional sports that we have so I can imagine a very large support in bringing the Olympics in upcoming years.\"\n\n\"Amazing idea! This website maps out everything!\"\n\n\"I think this would be amazing.\"\n\n\"All for it!\"\n\n\"Very Â well planned out\"\n\n\"I think that you have a great idea and using all of Western Oregon is a fantastic way to show Oregon to the world.\"\n\n\"I like it.\"\n\n\"Good idea, however, taxing the entire state to only benefit the northern I5 corridor makes this seem less feasible. People of southern and eastern Oregon already feel neglected by local government. The Rogue River could host the white water rapids portion of the Olympics and has been exploring the creation of an Olympic training course in the river. Wouldn't Bend be a great place for some events too? If the whole state is to be taxed, bring events to the whole state. Medford and Bend both have airports capable of large aircraft so travel wouldn't be difficult to plan.\"\n\n\"I think it can help to transform Oregon.\"\n\nWell thought out. Where in Portland do you envision development?\n\n\"Very unrealistic assumptions about venue requirements, existing infrastructure to support and Oregon's ability to financially back the olympic games. Love the enthusiasm! Would be a huge statement for a small state.\"\n\n\"Great idea.\""
