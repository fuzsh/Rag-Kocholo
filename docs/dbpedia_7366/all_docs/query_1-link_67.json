        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nMore than 10,000 athletes will compete in Athens. The events are as varied as ever, despite the absence of croquet, motor boating and tug of war, which have been tried and discontinued since the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. On Friday, the Olympics go back to their roots, and that is how we look at the 28 sports and 37 disciplines that will be contested in Greece. Compiled by Joe Drape, Damon Hack, Tyler Kepner, Frank Litsky, Juliet Macur, Liz Robbins, Selena Roberts, George Vecsey and Lynn Zinser.\n\nArchery\n\nIndividual events, men and women; team events, men and women.\n\nThis sport has an illustrious tradition of hunting and warfare dating to ancient Egyptian and Greek times. The first records of competition date to the late Renaissance in England. The sport was sporadic in the Olympics, with national competitions in only 1900, 1904, and 1908, until it officially joined the Games in 1972. The South Korean women's team, which swept all medals in Sydney, has won every gold medal in women's individual competition since 1984 and all four team titles since 1988. Australia is the favorite in the men's competition, featuring the defending gold medalist Simon Fairweather and the 17-year-old newcomer Tim Cuddihy. The venue in Panathinaiko Stadium, in the center of Athens, is a stunning open-air stone stadium built into a hillside with a narrow infield. Other than the finish of the marathon, archery is the only competition that will be held there.\n\nBadminton\n\nMen's and women's singles, men's and women's doubles and mixed doubles.\n\nThis favorite backyard sport is probably rooted in ancient Greece, dating almost 2,000 years to games of battledore (paddles) and shuttlecock (feathered cork). In India, the game called Poona evolved into a version closer to modern badminton in the mid-19th century. Badminton made its Olympic debut in 1992 at Barcelona. The Atlanta Olympics in 1996 not only raised the sport's profile in the United States, but also internationally, as corporations scrambled to tap into markets in Asia, where the sport is wildly popular.\n\nBadminton has been dominated by Indonesia, China and Korea. China could win as many as three gold medals, with the colorful Lin Dan leading the way. For the women, Camilla Martin of Denmark, who won silver in Sydney and is one of only two non-Asian women to earn an Olympic medal in the sport, is in line to add to her medal count.\n\nBaseball\n\nEight teams will compete in the tournament, with 24 players on each team.\n\nIt most likely came from the British game of rounders. For years, Abner Doubleday was credited with inventing baseball in Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1839. Later, that belief was refined and the date and place of baseball's origin shifted to 1846 and Hoboken, N.J. In May of this year, the city of Pittsfield, Mass., laid its claim as the birthplace of baseball after a document turned up from 1791 indicating that the game had become a nuisance in Pittsfield. Baseball's Olympic roots are much easier to pin down -- it became a medal sport in 1992 in Barcelona, Spain. The United States team won gold in Sydney in 2000, but failed to qualify for Athens. The Olympic field this time consists of Australia, Canada, Cuba, Greece, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands and Taiwan. On the Greek team, 22 of the roster spots went to players from the United States or Canada who are of Greek heritage.\n\nBasketball\n\nTwelve teams will compete for the men and 12 for the women.\n\nDr. James A. Naismith invented basketball in Springfield, Mass., in 1891. Naismith, a physical education teacher, had been ordered by his boss to invent a game to provide a wintertime distraction for students. It was first played with a soccer ball, with peach baskets as goals. In 1936, the United States won the first Olympic gold medal in basketball, 19-8 over Canada, on a muddy outdoor court. Naismith awarded the medal. The United States won every gold medal until the Soviet Union prevailed on a controversial call during the 1972 Games. Olympic basketball changed radically at the 1992 Games, the first allowing N.B.A. players to take part. Twelve years later, the Dream Team concept has lost some of its luster. The American team tried to revamp after its 58-game winning streak in international competition was broken at the world championships in 2002, when it finished a humiliating sixth. The United States qualified for the Athens Games last summer in Puerto Rico, but all but three N.B.A. stars from that team -- the exceptions being the co-captains Tim Duncan and Allen Iverson along with Richard Jefferson -- have opted not to play in the Olympics, citing injury, court cases, family commitments or security concerns. Larry Brown, fresh off an N.B.A. championship, is the coach. The squad is a ''Who's New'' in the N.B.A., with players like LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade and Emeka Okafor. Thirteen other N.B.A. players will be on teams representing their home countries, including Yao Ming of China, Pau Gasol of Spain and Manu Gin√≥bili , who will lead a dangerous Argentine team. Women's basketball was first played in the 1976 Games. The United States team, winner of the past two gold medals, will include the three-time Olympians Lisa Leslie, Dawn Staley and Sheryl Swoopes, along with the rookie Diana Taurasi. Lauren Jackson and Penny Taylor lead a talented Australian team, while Elena Baranova, the Liberty center, will play for Russia.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
