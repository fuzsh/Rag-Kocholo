        "text": "The three road cyclists who will represent Team Ireland at the Olympic Games in Paris this summer have been officially named by the Irish Olympic Association. Megan Armitage (Offaly), Ben Healy (Cork/Stourbridge, UK) and Ryan Mullen (Meath/Birkenhead, UK) will join the four-strong track cycling team to represent Ireland in cycling.\n\nThis announcement confirms the final number of athletes to represent Ireland at Paris 2024 at 133. This is the largest team Ireland has ever fielded at the Olympic Games.\n\nMullen and Healy will compete in the men's road race on 3 August, with Mullen also competing in the time trial on 27 July, the day after the opening of the Olympic Games. Armitage will compete in the women's road race on 4 August, becoming the first Irish woman to compete at the Olympic Games in thirty years. All three cyclists will be making their Olympic debut.\n\nHealy is in the best form of his career. He is currently riding in the Tour de France, which will give him exceptional form for the Olympic event. The course could suit him well. It is not overly demanding and suits the characteristics of a bold and adventurous cyclist like the Education First rider.\n\nIn a Games that promotes gender equality, men and women will share the same time trial course for the first time in history. The 32.4km course, which includes a 150m climb, starts at the Esplanade des Invalides and finishes at the Pont Alexandre III.\n\nMullen is Ireland's only competitor in the time trial and said: \"It is a huge privilege and the greatest honour of my career to date to represent Ireland at the Paris Olympics. I've worn the green and blue of Ireland for fifteen years so this opportunity has been long awaited and I'm more than ready to take it.\n\nOffaly's Megan Armitage has been a dominant force on the Irish road cycling scene in recent years and will be competing in the road race on 4 August. Both the men's and women's road races start and finish at the Trocadero, with the men's race covering 273km, including 2,800m of climbing. The women's race is 158km with 1,700m of climbing.\n\nArmitage is looking forward to the event, \"When I started cycling four years ago I never thought I would have the opportunity to represent Ireland at the Olympic Games. This is truly a dream come true. I'm incredibly proud of the journey I've taken to get here and the people who have supported me from the start. I hope to do them and myself proud in Paris\"\n\nGavin Noble, Chef de Mission of the Olympic Association of Ireland for Paris 2024, said, \"The road cycling events in Paris will be spectacular, set against the backdrop of one of the most beautiful cities in the world! They are a key event in the 'Games Wide Open' theme of the Olympic Games.\"\n\n\"They give spectators the opportunity to watch Olympic action without having to buy a ticket. Ben, Ryan and Megan will be making their Olympic debut, but they are highly accomplished cyclists and we look forward to supporting them over the coming weeks,\" he said.\n\nNeill Delahaye, Cycling Ireland's National Head Coach, added, \"The road races will be relentless, with a reduced peloton compared to most professional races, smaller team sizes and no radios, creating a different dynamic to most championship races. We believe this will play to the strengths and racing instincts of our riders.\""
