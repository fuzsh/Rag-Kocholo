        "text": "The Paris Olympics 2024 has captivated audiences globally, but for Indian fans and Vinesh Phogat, the excitement was short-lived. The talented wrestler's Olympic journey came to an abrupt end with her disqualification from the competition. This unfortunate turn of events adds to the list of countries facing Olympic bans and athletes stripped of their medals, leaving fans and competitors alike reeling from the consequences of rule violations.\n\nALSO READ| List of Indian Athletes Qualified for Paris Olympics 2024\n\nDisqualified Athletes and Countries from the Olympics till 2024\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has officially rescinded the following Olympic medals, upholding the principles of fairness and integrity in the Olympic Games. Notably, team medals are counted singularly, irrespective of team size or the number of disqualified members.\n\nThe revocation of a team medal typically entails the return of multiple physical medals, with each team member required to surrender their medal. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, a revoked team medal signifies the entire team's disqualification from the event due to infractions committed by one or more team members. This list underscores the IOC's commitment to enforcing rules and regulations in competitive sports, serving as a reminder of the importance of ethical conduct in Olympic competitions.
