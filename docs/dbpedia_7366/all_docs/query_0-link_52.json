        "text": "Olympic Games host cities\n\nWhat do Paris, Helsinki, Atlanta, Beijing, and Tokyo have in common? They all have hosted the Olympics. As the foremost international sporting event, the Olympic Games have been held in cities around the world—though certain regions, notably Africa, have yet to play host. In years past, the bidding process was highly competitive, as numerous cities campaigned to stage the Summer and Winter Games. However, fewer cities have vied for the honor in recent years. While the Games can increase tourism, boost local economies, and enhance a host country’s stature, critics have noted that the Olympics are hugely expensive, requiring cities to create costly infrastructure and buildings that later may fall into disuse. These and other challenges have led some to suggest permanent host sites.\n\n(Discover seven ways that hosting the Olympics has an impact on a city.)\n\nThe table provides a list of the cities that have been selected to host the Olympic Games.\n\nSites of the modern Olympic Games year Summer Games Winter Games\n\n*The Winter Games were not held until 1924. **Games were not held during World War I and World War II. ***Beginning in 1994, the Summer and Winter Games were held on a staggered two-year schedule.\n\n1896 Athens * 1900 Paris * 1904 St. Louis, Mo., U.S. * 1908 London * 1912 Stockholm * 1916 ** * 1920 Antwerp, Belg. * 1924 Paris Chamonix, France 1928 Amsterdam St. Moritz, Switz. 1932 Los Angeles Lake Placid, N.Y., U.S. 1936 Berlin Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Ger. 1940 ** ** 1944 ** ** 1948 London St. Moritz, Switz. 1952 Helsinki, Fin.
