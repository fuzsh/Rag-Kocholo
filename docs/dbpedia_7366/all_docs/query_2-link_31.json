        "text": "US #3068e\n\n1996 Men’s Cycling\n\nPart of Souvenir Sheet of 20\n\nSheet commemorates 100th anniversary of Olympics\n\nFourth sheet in Classic Collections series\n\nCategory of Stamp: Commemorative\n\nSet: Olympic Games\n\nValue: 32¢, First-Class mail rate\n\nFirst Day of Issue: May 2, 1996\n\nFirst Day City: Washington, DC\n\nQuantity Issued: 324,150,000\n\nPrinted by: J. W. Fergusson and Sons, for Stamp Venturers\n\nPrinting Method: Photogravure\n\nFormat: Panes of 20 (5 across, 4 down) from cylinders of 120 (8 across, 15 down)\n\nPerforations: 10.1\n\nReason the stamp was issued: The sheet of 20 stamps was issued in honor of the 100th anniversary of the moder Olympic Games. The Olympics were held in Atlanta, Georgia two months later.\n\nAbout the stamp design: Artist Richard Waldrep created the paintings used for the stamp images using photographs of athletes performing each sport. He chose sports that America was likely to do well in and those that were the most watched on TV.\n\nWaldrep had previously designed the set of five stamps for the 1992 Summer Olympics and the four Country and Western Music stamps the following year.\n\nSpecial design details: In some of his designs, Waldrep had to alter the faces and uniforms of the athletes he depicted so they wouldn’t resemble the athlete in the original photos he used for reference.\n\nFirst Day City: Though the First Day of Issue ceremony was originally supposed to be held in Atlanta, it was changed to Washington, DC, just weeks before the stamp was issued. This was in response to a disagreement between the US Postal Service and the US Olympic Committee over the sale of T-shirts picturing the stamps. The Olympic Committee saw the merchandise as a violation of the marketing agreement between the committee and the USPS.\n\nAbout the Classic Collections Series: The Atlanta 1996 sheet was the fourth issue in the Classic Collections series. This series began in 1994 with the Legends of the West issue. The idea originated from Carl Burcham, manager of stamp and product marketing for USPS at the time. Each Classic Collections set consists of a pane of 20 different semi-jumbo stamps with descriptive selvage at the top (header) and informational text on the back of each stamp beneath the gum. The stamps are “broadly defined, Americana-themed subjects.”\n\nThe first four Classic Collections sets were accompanied by matching sets of picture postal cards showcasing the stamp designs.\n\nHistory the Souvenir Sheet represents: The 1996 Olympic Games marked an important anniversary – 100 years since the start of the modern Olympic Games. The Ancient Olympic Games were held between 776 BC and 394 AD, when Theodosius I abolished them.\n\nMore than 1,500 years later, Pierre de Coubertin arranged for the first modern Olympics to be held in 1896. He believed that friendly athletic competition could promote world peace. Those first games consisted of 285 athletes, representing 13 nations, competing in 42 events. The games were a success and became an international tradition.\n\nOne hundred years later, the world excitedly prepared for the 1996 Olympic Games. The games opened on July 19, 1996, in Atlanta, Georgia. Some 11,000 athletes from 197 nations competed in hundreds of events.\n\nThe US issued two items for the occasion. One was a sheet of 20 stamps (#3068), released in May, that depicted modern athletes. The other was issued on the opening day of the show and honored the games’ centennial. This stamp (#3086) pictures the “Discus Thrower” – the king of athletes among ancient Greeks – whose purposeful action is captured in Myron’s 5th-century B.C. statue Discobolus."
