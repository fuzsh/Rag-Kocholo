        "text": "Since the first modern Games in 1896, 10 sports have disappeared completely from the Olympic schedule. These are croquet, cricket, Jeu de Paume, pelota, polo, roque, rackets, tug-of-war, lacrosse, and motor boating. Four sports that were previously listed here as discontinued have made a surprising comeback: golf and rugby were voted back in as official sports for Rio 2016, and baseball and softball returned for Tokyo 2020.\n\nIn addition to the discontinued sports listed above, there is a large number of discontinued events from sports that remain on the program, for example swimming events of plunge for distance and underwater swimming, the track and field events of the standing highjump and tug-of-war, and the shooting events of running deer shooting and dueling pistol.\n\nBelow is a list of all known discontinued Olympic Games sports and events. Every one of these sports have once been part of the official Olympic Games program at some stage.\n\nIt is not a complete list, all the main sports are here but there are many more sporting events to be added. There are a lot more discontinued sports and events than most people realize. See also the list of previous Olympic Games demonstration sports.\n\nFollow the links for more information about some of these sports or sporting events.\n\nRelated Pages"
