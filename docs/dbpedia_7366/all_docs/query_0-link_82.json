        "text": "3 THE CATEGORIZATION OF SPORT BRANCHES\n\nThe simplest and most used approach is viewing sports as Olympic and non-Olympic sports. People with various physical or mental impairments compete in Paralympic sports. There is a list of so-called recognised sports, which means sports recognised by the IOC. When focusing on particular cultures, nations, regions or countries, we can mention national sports. There is an increasing number of sports that are called extreme sports.\n\nOLYMPIC SPORTS\n\nThe Olympic sport is defined by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as follows:\n\nAn Olympic sport must be widely practised by men in at least 75 countries and on four continents, and by women in at least 40 countries and on three continents.\n\nA discipline is a branch of an Olympic sport including one or more events. For example, Aquatics is an Olympic sport comprising four Olympic disciplines: swimming, diving, water polo, and synchronised swimming. One of swimming events is 100m breaststroke.\n\nThe events programme for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games held in Beijing (China) will list 28 sports (35 Olympic disciplines), and the Olympics will stage 302 events (165 men’s events, 127 women’s events, and 10 mixed events), which is one more than in Athens 2004. Nine new events will be held (e.g. two events from the new cycling discipline of BMX, women will compete in 3000m steeplechase, both men and women will compete in swimming marathon over 10km), some former events will be removed and some replaced or alternated.\n\nThe 2006 Winter Olympics held in Turin (Italy) featured 84 medal events in 15 disciplines grouped over 7 sports. Events that made Olympic debut in Turin included Mass start biathlon, Team sprint cross-country skiing, Snowboard cross and Team pursuit speed skating.\n\nSo called demonstration sports or events, which used to be introduced at the Olympics in the past, have not been held at any Olympics since 1992.\n\nThe Summer Paralympic Games currently stage 20 sports including four unique sports designed only for the disabled.\n\nThe Winter Paralympics include 4 sports. Some rules of common sports are modified and adjusted for the needs of athletes with disabilities.\n\nZalomit\n\nTHE LIST OF OLYMPIC SPORTS HELD AT THE 2008 SUMMER OG\n\n(the number of events to be contested in each sport is indicated in brackets)\n\nAquatics (46): Diving (8), Swimming (34), Synchronised swimming (2), Water polo (2)\n\nArchery (4)\n\nAthletics (track and field) (47)\n\nBadminton (5)\n\nBaseball (1)\n\nBasketball (2)\n\nBoxing (11)\n\nCanoeing (16) (Whitewater Canoeing and Kayaking, Flat Water Canoeing and Kayaking)\n\nCycling (18) (Road Cycling, Track Cycling, Mountain Biking, BMX Cycling)\n\nEquestrian (6) (Show Jumping, Military Equestrian, Dressage)\n\nFencing (10)\n\nFootball (Soccer) (2)\n\nGymnastics (18) (Artistic Gymnastics, Rhythmic Gymnastics, Trampoline)\n\nHandball (2)\n\nHockey (field) (2)\n\nJudo (14)\n\nModern Pentathlon (2)\n\nRowing (14) (Rowing and Sculling)\n\nSailing (11)\n\nShooting (15)\n\nSoftball (1)\n\nTable Tennis (4)\n\nTaekwondo (8)\n\nTennis (4)\n\nTriathlon (2)\n\nVolleyball (4) (Volleyball, Beach Volleyball)\n\nWeightlifting (15)\n\nWrestling (18) (Greco-Roman Wrestling)\n\nTHE LIST OF OLYMPIC SPORTS HELD AT THE 2006 WINTER OG\n\n15 disciplines grouped over 7 sports (Skiing, Skating, Ice Hockey, Bobsleigh, Luge, Curling, Snowboarding)\n\n(the number of events to be contested in each discipline is indicated in brackets)\n\nAlpine Skiing (10) (Slalom, Giant Slalom, Super-G, Downhill Race, Combined Event)\n\nBiathlon (10)\n\nBobsleigh (3)\n\nCross-country Skiing (12)\n\nCurling (2)\n\nFigure Skating (4) (Men’s Singles, Women’s Singles, Pairs, Ice Dancing)\n\nFreestyle Skiing (4) (Moguls, Aerials, Ski Cross)\n\nIce Hockey (2)\n\nLuge (3)\n\nNordic Combined Event (3)\n\nShort Track Speed Skating (8)\n\nSkeleton (2)\n\nSki Jumping (3)\n\nSnowboarding (6) (Half-pipe, Dual Slalom, Snowboard Cross)\n\nSpeed Skating (12)\n\nSPORTS AT SUMMER PARALYMPIC GAMES\n\nspecial sports for the disabled: Boccia, Goalball, Powerlifting, Wheelchair Rugby\n\nArchery, Athletics (track and field), Cycling, Equestrian, Football 5-a-side, Football 7-a-side, Judo, Rowing, Sailing, Shooting, Swimming, Table Tennis, Volleyball (sitting), Wheelchair Basketball, Wheelchair Fencing, Wheelchair Tennis\n\nSPORTS AT WINTER PARALYMPIC GAMES\n\nAlpine Skiing (Downhill Race, Slalom, Giant Slalom, Super-G)\n\nIce Sledge Hockey\n\nNordic Skiing (Cross-country Skiing, Biathlon)\n\nWheelchair Curling\n\nRECOGNIZED SPORTS\n\nIn order to promote the Olympic Movement, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) may recognise as International Sports Federations (IFS) international non-governmental organisations administering one or several sports at world level and encompassing organisations administering such sports at national level. The current list includes:\n\nAir Sports, Bandy, Billiard Sports, Boules, Bowling, Bridge, Chess, Dance Sport, Golf, Karate, Korfball, Life Saving, Motorcycle Racing, Mountaineering and Climbing, Netball, Orienteering, Pelote Basque, Polo, Power-boating, Racquetball, Roller Sports, Rugby, Squash, Surfing, Sumo, Tug of War, Underwater Sports, Water Skiing, Wushu.\n\nEXTREME SPORTS\n\nAn extreme sport (also called action sport, adventure sport, or adventurous sport) is any sport featuring speed, height, danger, a high level of physical exertion, highly specialized gear, or spectacular stunts. “True” extreme sports are referred to as leisure or recreation activities where the most likely outcome of a mismanaged accident or mistake is death. Another characteristic of activities so labelled is the fact that they tend to be individual rather than team sports. Extreme sports can include both competitive and non-competitive activities.\n\nExtreme sports include e.g. aggressive skating, BMX freestyle, bodyboarding, bossaball, bouldering, buildering, bungee jumping, canyoning, cave diving, drag racing, extreme skiing (Flying Kilometer, Ski Alpinism), freediving, freestyle motocross, hang gliding, ice climbing, mountain biking, kite surfing, mountaineering, parachuting, rally, rock climbing, scuba diving, skateboarding, skydiving, slamball, spearfishing, street luge, stunt pogo, wakeboarding, water skiing, whitewater rafting, zorbing, etc.\n\nThe event called the X Games is an annual multi-sport event with a focus on action sports. Competitors perform in many different categories and styles, trying to win medals as well as prize money. The competitions often feature never-before-seen tricks. There is also the X Fest – ultimate action sports and music festival, and other events.\n\nNATIONAL SPORTS\n\nA national sport is a sport or game that is considered to be a popularly intrinsic part of the culture of a country or nation. In American English the term “national pastime” is often used. Although there are no official parameters towards defining what a national sport is, there are some general characteristics that most national sports share:\n\nThe rules and objectives of the sport or game are known in fairly great detail in the country or nation\n\nThe game or sport is widely played or watched in the country or nation\n\nIn some countries, a sport or game can become the official national sport by mandate of the Government, such as with Canada and lacrosse in 1995. In other countries, where a sport or game has a very long history or tradition, and often its origin as well, such as with baseball in the USA or sumo wrestling in Japan, the sport or game is often considered a de facto official national sport (pastime).\n\nExamples of national sports in English speaking countries and in other countries\n\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: In England football is the most popular sport followed by cricket and rugby. In Scotland the native sport is shinty, but football attracts much larger crowds, Scotland was the birthplace of golf and curling as well. In Wales it is traditionally rugby union, but football is played by more people and attracts much higher attendances.\n\nUnited States of America: baseball has historically been considered America’s national pastime and a significant aspect of American culture. However, American football currently enjoys greater popularity nationwide than baseball, while basketball is played by a lot of people.\n\nCanada: lacrosse and ice hockey are the official national sports. Among other very popular sports there is basketball, baseball, golf, tennis, female soccer, or curling.\n\nAustralia: Cricket is the traditional summer sport. Football and rugby are the most popular winter sports in different parts of the country.\n\nNew Zealand: rugby union is most widely performed and most closely linked to national pride, netball is a very popular female sport, cricket is the national summer sport, yachting and sailing are also popular.\n\nCzech Republic: ice hockey and football (soccer) are considered national sports, football tennis originated in the Czech land, hiking, canoe touring, cycling and skiing are very popular pastimes.\n\nIreland: soccer, golf, India: field hockey, cricket, Japan: sumo wrestling, karate, judo, Belgium: cycling, Ethiopia and Kenya: athletics, Argentina and Brazil: soccer, Spain: soccer, bullfighting, the Netherlands: speed skating, cycling, China: table tennis, Finland: ice hockey, ski jumping, Norway: skiing, Austria: Alpine skiing, Norway: cross-country skiing, France: soccer, pétanque, Hawaii: surfing, windsurfing, Alaska: dog-sledging, etc.\n\nNational sport number one in majority of countries worldwide is football (soccer).\n\nSPORT BRANCHES\n\nDifferent sports can be grouped according to the use of similar physical activity, technique, equipment, environment or sport facility, highly specialized gear, etc.\n\nTrack and Field Athletics:\n\nTrack events: sprints, middle-distance runs, long-distance runs, relays, hurdles, steeplechase\n\nField events: throwing events (javelin throw, discus throw, hammer throw, shot put), jumping events (long jump, high jump, triple jump, pole vault)\n\nRoad events: Marathon, walks\n\nCombined events: decathlon, heptathlon\n\nGymnastics: general gymnastics, artistic gymnastics (apparatus gymnastics), rhythmic gymnastics, acrobatics, trampoline\n\nGames:\n\nBall games (e.g. football, handball, rugby, basketball, volleyball)\n\nGoal games (e.g. football, handball, basketball, hockey, ice hockey)\n\nRacquet games (e.g. tennis, table tennis, badminton, squash, baseball, softball, golf)\n\nAquatics: swimming, diving, synchronised swimming, water polo\n\nWater sports:\n\nCanoeing and kayaking (whitewater events and flat water events), rafting\n\nSurfing, windsurfing, sailing and yachting\n\nRowing and sculling\n\nCycling sports: road cycling, track cycling, cyclo-cross, mountain biking, cyclo-trial, BMX, indoor cycling (artistic cycling, cycleball)\n\nSki sports: Alpine skiing, Nordic skiing (cross-country skiing, ski jumping, biathlon, Nordic combined), Freestyle skiing, Snowboarding\n\nSports on the ice: figure skating, speed skating, short track, ice hockey, curling, bobsleigh, luge, skeleton\n\nTechnical sports:\n\nAir sports: parachuting, paragliding, hang gliding, aerobatics\n\nMotor racing, motorcycle racing, rally, motor-cross,\n\nScuba diving, water skiing, power-boating\n\nShooting, archery\n\nCombat sports and Martial Arts: wrestling, boxing, judo, karate, taekwondo, kung fu, aikido, fencing, sumo\n\nOutdoor sports: skiing, snowboarding, cycling, canoeing, rafting, windsurfing, climbing, orienteering, hiking\n\nEquestrian: horse racing/ the turf, steeplechase, chariot races, show jumping, dressage, military\n\nCombined sports: Modern Pentathlon (shooting, fencing, swimming, show jumping, cross-country run), Triathlon (swimming, cycling, cross-country run), Biathlon (cross-country skiing, shooting), Nordic Combined (cross-country skiing, ski jumping), etc.\n\nZalomit\n\nREADING (Authentic text)\n\nACTIVE AEROBICS, SPORTS, AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES\n\nActive aerobics, sports, and recreational activities are physical activity categories at the second level of the physical activity pyramid. They are effective in promoting health benefits, as well as developing fitness and enhancing performance.\n\nActive Aerobics: Physical activities of enough intensity to produce improvements in cardiovascular fitness. They are more intense than aerobic lifestyle activities.\n\nActive Recreational Activities: Activities done during leisure time that do not meet the characteristics of sports. Many types of active aerobics are recreational activities.\n\nSports: Typically considered to be competitive physical activities that have an organized set of rules along with winners and losers.\n\nActive aerobics are placed at the second level of the physical activity pyramid because, next to lifestyle physical activities, they are among the most popular activities among adults. They are more vigorous than lifestyle physical activities, at the base of the pyramid, and this is why they are generally not performed as frequently as lifestyle physical activities. Aerobic activities, such as walking, swimming, exercising with machines, cycling and jogging, are among the top fifteen participation activities in the United States. For many of the aerobic activities, the ranks for males and females are quite similar. There are some differences, however. Aerobic exercise (dance) is sixth for females but not ranked for males, and golf is sixth for males but not ranked for females.\n\nActive recreational activities and sports done at moderate to vigorous intensity are included in the second level of the pyramid. Experts classify activities such as hiking, boating, fishing, horseback riding, and other outdoor activities as recreational. Recreational activities performed in the target zone for building cardiovascular fitness are considered to be active recreational activities and are appropriately included in the second level of the pyramid. Camping is an example and is among the top fifteen participation activities. It is equally popular among males and females. Other examples of popular active recreational activities are backpacking, kayaking, and canoeing.\n\nActive sports can also be included in level 2 of the pyramid because they are vigorous. Basketball is the only active sport in the top fifteen participation activities. It is typically anaerobic and intermittent. Other aerobic sports include racquetball, tennis, soccer, and hockey. When done consistently with the FIT formula for cardiovascular fitness, these sports can provide benefits similar to those of active aerobics. Swimming and cycling are popular activities that can be considered sports. However, most people do these activities noncompetitively, so they are considered as active aerobics in this book.\n\nSports such as golf, bowling, and billiards/pool are aerobic but are light to moderate in intensity. For this reason, they are classified as lifestyle physical activities.\n\nTable 1: Most Popular Participation Activities\n\n(Source: National Sporting Goods Association)\n\nReference:\n\nCORBIN, CH., CORBIN, W., WELK, G., WELK, K.: Concepts of Physical Fitness.
