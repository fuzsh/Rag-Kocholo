        "text": "Tallahassee's Lily Williams will return from the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris with the ultimate reward.\n\nA gold medal.\n\nWilliams, 30, a former running star at Chiles High and one of four cyclist on the American women's pursuit team, helped the United States soar to an early lead on New Zealand and then held on for gold Wednesday night at the Olympic velodrome.\n\nThe team featured road race champion Kristen Faulkner, time trial bronze medalist Chloe Dygert, Jennifer Valente and Williams, a former seven-time state champion at Chiles and accomplished runner at Vanderbilt.\n\n\"So stoked,\" Williams told the Democrat in a text message following the race.\n\nThe Americans led by more than a second a quarter of the way through the 4,000-meter race. They stretched the gap to nearly two seconds, but held off a furious finish by New Zealand to clinch their first gold in team pursuit.\n\nThe winners clocked a time of 4:04.306, finishing just a fraction of a second off the World Record time. Lily and her team's race was featured as the opener in Olympics Primetime Wednesday night.\n\nWilliams' parents, Cris and Sarah – a former Olympian in speed skating – traveled to France to cheer on their daughter and Team USA.\n\n\"The qualifying and Round 1 races were very stressful for us parents as those rounds determine if you get a shot at gold,\" Cris told the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\n\"Once Team USA got to the gold medal round today (Wednesday), the stress level was reduced a bit. Lily told us before the gold medal final that all the work prior to the final was done, and all that was left was to have fun.\n\n\"And I think her winning a gold medal is sort of the absolute definition of fun.\"\n\nSeminoles in Paris: FSU sends over a two dozen athletes to 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nScott Gowan, who coached Williams at Chiles, said he is proud of the 2012 graduate. Gowan sent Williams a text last week wishing her good luck and telling her \"she was ready for the Paris Olympics and to go for the Gold.\"\n\n\"It's still hard to believe that Lily is now a Gold medalist but after coaching her during her four years in high school and seeing how hard she worked, I can't say that I am surprised,\" Gowan said. \"She was driven in high school both academically and athletically and left her mark on the state of Florida as one of the all-time best to ever do it.\"\n\nIn Wednesday's first round, the United States clocked in at 4:04.629, narrowly edging out Team Great Britain by just 0.29 seconds to advance to the gold medal round.\n\nTeam USA finished second behind New Zealand in qualifying Tuesday.\n\nWith an impressive qualifying time under their belts, USA Coach Gary Sutton, according to USA Cycling, encouraged the team to “believe in themselves.”\n\nWilliams and Co. did.\n\nWilliams, who trains in Colorado Springs, Colorado, raced again Friday with Valente in the women's Madison.\n\nThe team event for two riders is a relay race held over 50km for men and 30km for women, with a succession of intermediate sprints every 10 laps. The Americans won several sprint laps, but it wasn't enough as they finished just off the podium at fourth overall behind Italy, Great Britain and the Netherlands.\n\nAlthough a newcomer to cycling, Williams has quickly developed into an elite performer.\n\nShe was a member of Team USA that captured an Olympic bronze medal in the Women's Team Pursuit in Tokyo in 2022.\n\nTeam pursuit is an endurance event that includes four riders on a team racing 16 laps against another team, with the four riders completing the 16 laps in a quicker time winning.\n\nThe Women’s Team Pursuit squad has had a storied history of dominance over the past decade. This marks their fourth consecutive Olympic Team Pursuit medal, having medaled in every Women’s Team Pursuit.\n\nThe Olympics are part of the Williams family, too.\n\nWilliams’ mother – Sarah Docter Williams – is a former Olympian in speed skating. Sarah placed 10th in the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, in the 3,000-meters.\n\nSarah’s sister Mary also competed in four Olympic Games (1980, 1984, 1988, 1992) in speed skating. Her best finish was sixth in 3,000 meters.\n\nResults:\n\nUnited States of America – 4:04.306\n\nNew Zealand – 4:04.927\n\nGreat Britain – 4:06.382\n\nWho is Lily Williams, Olympic gold medalist?\n\nLily started a professional career on the road in 2018 after transitioning from collegiate running in 2016. She got on the podium at criterium nationals and won the 2018 Winston Salem Cycling Classic. She started racing on the track in 2019 and had found her new home. Lily quickly excelled on the track and joined the team pursuit squad that went on to win the World Championships in 2020 and qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. Lily and her teammates rode to a bronze medal at the Games. After the Olympics, she started taking on other track events and podiumed at the Nations Cups in the Individual Pursuit and Madison."
