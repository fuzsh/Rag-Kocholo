        "text": "(Rio, BRA – August 16, 2016) Allison Beveridge overcame her injuries from a crash to finish 11th in the Women’s Omnium on the final day of track competition at the Rio Games on Tuesday. Beveridge was taken down in a crash on Monday in the first of the six events that make up the Omnium, injuring her hip and suffering numerous contusions. Great Britain’s Laura Trott repeated as Olympic champion.\n\nAt the end of the first day of competition, Beveridge was 13th in the standings. She and the team had hoped that a night of recovery might help, but Beveridge was still in pain and lacking power when she started the first event on the second day, the 500 metre Time Trial. Despite that, she finished ninth, and moved up to 12th in the overall standings. In the Flying Lap event, Beveridge was a strong sixth, to move up to tenth overall.\n\nThe final 25 kilometre Points Race proved to be too much, with Beveridge attempting to gain points but unable to sprint effectively. She managed to avoid getting dropped by the field, but lost one position to finish 11th overall.\n\n“That was one of the toughest race of my life to get through mentally,” admitted Beveridge. “I didn’t know how much the crash had taken out of me until today, and when I saw the sprint time that I was able to produce [in the Flying Lap], I had a pretty good idea that it just wasn’t there for me in the Points Race. But it turned into a mental battle just to get through this and finish it off. In the circumstances I did what I could, as disappointed as I am with it.”\n\n“I have a pretty good contusion on my hip, and pedaling and pulling up, it just feels like that leg isn’t following the other one. When everyone else is flying here, that’s not a way to go. I’m pretty disappointed with the result. Coming into this Olympics I was in physically better shape than I was able to show. Things happen in bike racing, and I have to accept that, but I would like to come back and have a different experience than this event.”\n\n“I’m very thankful for that Team Pursuit [bronze medal]. That was our focus, and this is why – anything can happen out there. The Olympics is definitely a bike race where everyone steps up, and as much as you want to be on top, there is only so much in your control, so you just have to race your bike and see what happens.”\n\n“The Olympics is just another bike race, but it is different in that everyone brings out their best equipment and their best form. It’s a bike race in that you go out there and show what you have, but at the Olympics you have to be in the best form and have the best equipment and show what you have.”\n\nJacques Landry, High Performance Director at Cycling Canada, discussed Beveridge’s performance and the overall performance of the track team. “It was painful for Allison, for sure, and she was not firing on all cylinders. She fought it out, it was a good race and she is tough. I respect her because any other rider probably would have just not started [the second day]. It was good to see her fight through it, but it was definitely not the Allison we are used to seeing.”\n\n“Coming in to the track events, we were hoping to see something from Hugo [Barrette] in the Keirin [who finished 13th]. He’s disappointed because he came in with very good fitness, really good form and everything was in line from a physiological standpoint, but he just made some mistakes in both of his races. That being said, it was a really tough field and the cards didn’t play in his favour.”\n\n“With regards to other medal chances, Allie [Beveridge] could have been up there in the Omnium, based on her fitness and how we saw her ride in New Zealand [where she won a World Cup]. So to wrap up the track competition … we came in expecting a medal in the Team Pursuit and accomplished that. We were able to breath a bit better after that medal.”\n\n“With the sprint program we been on our heels for the last two years just trying to qualify [for the Olympics]. So there was no rest, we had to go to all the World Cups around the world, guns a blazing to try and qualify, and we accomplished that. So that’s a good accomplishment from the sprint program. Now it’s a matter of building the sprint program to 2020.”\n\n“We prepared really well, the Town of Milton and the velodrome were really good to us, so that we could optimize our preparation. We’ll have to go back and see where we might have done a bit better, but everyone comes here with their A game. So now it’s time to start focussing on BMX and Mountain Bike.”\n\n(Rio, BRA – August 16, 2016) Hugo Barrette, Canada’s entrant in the Men’s Keirin at the Rio Games, was eliminated after the first round of competition on Tuesday, finishing 13th overall.\n\nBarrette faced a tough draw in his first race, going up against five-time Olympic gold medalist Jason Kenny of Great Britain and former world champion Maximilian Levy of Germany. Barrette was fourth, with only the top two moving on to the next round.\n\nIn the last chance Repechage race, Barrette finished second to Azizulhasni Awang of Malaysia, and was eliminated from the competition.\n\n“It is disappointing,” admitted Barrette. “I had the legs and some amazing training going into this. At the end of the day, I had two hard rides, but I can’t attribute my defeat to the draw. It came down to bad decisions, or more correctly, the lack of decisiveness by me. I didn’t race like I should have.”\n\n“It’s a big disappointment, but knowing where I came from [injury]; it’s been a hard season. So I need to remind myself of that. I was so close to not even being here, so at least I had a chance to go for a medal. I cherish that and I’m proud of myself for making it here.”\n\n“I should have won the second ride, but [Awang] did really good, and I think he is in contention to win a medal. He was just a better rider in this race.”\n\n“It’s a mix of emotions being here, for sure. I really thought that I had a shot at winning, and then I finish 13th. It’s a hard blow, but it’s something to cherish; being part of Team Canada for the first time at the Olympics. It gives me some experience for what’s to come in the future.””\n\nCanadian sprint coach, Erin Hartwell, said, “What people need to understand is that there is nothing harder than qualifying out of the first round of the Keirin. It’s similar to Nascar, in that you have 27 riders and any one of them can win. Hugo put out a valiant effort, but that’s the nature of the beast. Knowing the effort he has put in since his crash at the Cali [Colombia] World Cup, I want to see him back for the next four years, and I’m confident that he is going to be a world champion, an Olympic champion, at some point.”\n\nHartwell also talked about the sprint program results in Rio, “I can’t call our results disappointing. I believe we brought our strongest sprint team to the Olympics in history. We all want more, but I have to commend the athletes for the last two years since we started this program, and obviously there is still work to do.”\n\n(Rio, BRA – August 15, 2016) Allison Beveridge had a disappointing start to the Women’s Omnium in track cycling at the Rio Olympics on Monday, when she was taken down in a crash, in the Scratch Race, the first of six events.\n\nTwo days after winning a bronze medal as part of the Women’s Team Pursuit squad, Beveridge lined up for the first of two days of competition in the Omnium. With eight laps to go, Beveridge was taken down by the German rider, Anna Knauer, who did not hold her line going into a corner.\n\nBeveridge was quickly back up and in the race, but could only manage 14th in the event, a serious blow to her medal chances, since riders accumulate points for the overall standings based on their results in each race.\n\nThe Calgary rider suffered contusions to her hip and shoulder, and was only able to finished ninth in the second event, the Individual Pursuit, which is normally one of her stronger events. In the final event of the first day, the Elimination race, Beveridge was 15th, putting her in 14th place overall. Laura Trott of Great Britain, the defending Olympic champion, leads the standings with 118 points at the halfway mark, while Beveridge has 50 points.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Omnium concludes with the final three events, and Beveridge will try to recover some positions after rest and support for her injuries.\n\n“There was a bit of a crash,” explained Beveridge, “my front wheel got clipped as [Knauer] came down track. It was pretty bad timing, because by the time I got going it was three laps to go, so it was a bit of a challenge to contest the finish and I just didn’t really have it. It’s bothering me more then I’d like. You try to bounce back, but sometimes physically it takes a toll. I’ve been trying to put it aside, but my legs aren’t responding too well, so that’s disappointing. It’s the Games, so you’ve got to go down fighting.”\n\n“I’m definitely hoping to move up a bit tomorrow, this reminds me of the disappointing first day at the world championships [where she eventually finished fourth]. The timed events tomorrow are just ‘go as fast as you can’, so that simplifies things, so I’m hoping I can gain back some spots there. I just want to give it my best and climb as high as possible.”\n\n“Obviously, the German coming down on her and causing the crash was very unfortunate,” said Jacques Landry, Director of High Performance at Cycling Canada. “She was well positioned and she has been riding well. In the Team Pursuit she definitely lifted the team up. She’s a bit beaten up and bruised, and that had an impact on her for the next races. It’s a question now of going home and licking her wounds, and seeing what she’s got for tomorrow. We’ll see how she is feeling in the morning and make a decision at that point on her riding strategy.”\n\n“You never know with the Points Race at the end of the Omnium; since she won’t be factored by the leaders, a move could go and she could gain some points and move up some positions. But mathematically, a podium is not likely. It’s just unfortunate, because she is riding really well.”\n\n(Rio, BRA – August 14, 2016) The Women’s Sprint competition got underway on Sunday at the Rio Olympics, with Canadians Kate O’Brien and Monique Sullivan participating.\n\nBoth riders qualified in the top-18 out of 27 starters, with O’Brien 12th at 11.020 seconds for 200 metres and Sullivan 17th at 11.143 seconds. By qualifying they moved on to the head-to-head competition. In the first round, Sullivan faced the number two qualifier, Katy Marchand of Great Britain, and was beaten, while O’Brien was similarly defeated by Natasha Hansen of New Zealand. In the last chance Repechage race, O’Brien was second and Sullivan third, so neither moved on to the next round, on Monday.\n\n“Around 11 seconds is what I rode at Worlds,” said O’Brien, “but I wasn’t comfortable on this track so it’s more than I expected, to be honest. In the Repechage I was hoping to snag the front, but the chance didn’t come. Miriam [Welte, of Germany] is a savvy rider who has been around for a long time, so you can’t just sneak by her.”\n\n“I was so disappointed from yesterday [in the Keirin, when she exited after the first round],” said Sullivan. “It was a big disappointment not to deliver in the Keirin, so this morning it was hard to turn it around. I got some help from the staff, who told me to enjoy it and to be grateful to be here. I’ve heard people say that in interviews before and I kind of thought it was a cop out, but I’m realizing that it’s not a cop out. It’s the hardest thing in the world when you are disappointed to still be grateful to be here and appreciate the opportunity. So I got that help, and my 200 did turn around. I would have liked more, but I did the best I could for the day and sometimes that’s all you can do.”\n\n“My first ride was actually a pretty decent ride. I qualified second last, so I went up against the second fastest, and it’s hard to convince yourself when it’s one-on-one that you can win this race. I really tried and went in with the attitude that I could win, but she just had more horsepower. But I raced a good race.”\n\n(Rio, BRA – August 13, 2016) Canada won its first cycling medal of the Rio Olympics on Saturday, with a bronze medal in the Women’s Team Pursuit. The team of Allison Beveridge, Jasmin Glaesser, Kirsti Lay and Georgia Simmerling beat New Zealand with a time of four minutes and 14.627 seconds for 4000 metres, which is a new Canadian record. Great Britain won the gold ahead of the United States in a world record time.\n\nThe Canadian team faced the defending Olympic champions, Great Britain, in the semi-final round in the morning session and lost when the British team set a new world record. However, the Canadians set the third fastest time of the session at four minutes and 15.636 seconds, to qualify for the bronze medal race.\n\nIn the medal final, Canada took control of the race from the start and were over six-tenths of a second ahead after the first 1000 metres. By the mid-point of the race the lead was above one second, and at the end the Canadian squad finished nearly four seconds in front of their opponents. The fifth member of the team, Laura Brown, rode in the qualifying round and also received the bronze medal.\n\nJasmin Glaesser, the only returning member of the bronze medal-winning team from the London Olympics, said “It was a great ride. Four years ago, it was a little bit of a surprise, but this time around [a medal] was our goal and focus, and this is the result of four years of hard work. To put it together on the day, when it matters, is an incredible feeling. Qualifying was a disappointment because we knew we had a lot more, but every ride since then we’ve taken seconds off of our time, including setting two national records today. the ride this evening was really incredible, and it felt like every one of us left it all out there and didn’t hold back. You can’t ask for more than that when you are riding at the Olympics.”\n\n“This isn’t that fastest track out there, but this is the highest level of competition since this event changed from three riders to four after London. I think that trend is just going to continue through the next four years; the depth in the sport is really growing, and you can see that with the riders we’ve been able to ride in the last couple of years. I fully expect that the time is going to keep dropping, and it’s great to be at a race like this when everyone brings their A game.”\n\nAdditional Quotes\n\nKirsti Lay: “We switched a few things up from the first day, but mostly we stuck to what we knew and I think that’s what got us faster. We stayed with our game plan and went back to the basics. You tell yourself it’s another bike race, but there’s a lot more emotions on that start line. But we tried to stick to what we knew, and be calm and focus on the process, and then the outcome would be there.”\n\nGeorgia Simmerling: “We had to come together really quickly, and we did that. We rode faster every single ride, and put it all on the line. I’m so, so, so proud to be a part of this team and to finish that ride with the girls that I rode with. I never thought it was possible.”\n\nAllison Beveridge: “We were definitely disappointed with our first ride [on Thursday]; we knew that we had more. So we cleaned up technically and executed much better both in this morning and in the medal ride. We left it all out there and we have to be happy with what we did. Hats off to GB and the U.S., but I think we can take satisfaction with what we accomplished. we knew that it would be fast and that the world record was going to fall. It’s true what they say: the Games atmosphere really brings out best of people and everything comes together.”\n\nLaura Brown: “I got to ride in qualifying, and it was an honour. It does feel special to participate; I’ve been looking forward to this moment for a long time; to be on the track and ride at the Olympics, and I couldn’t think of a better team to do it with. I love these girls and it is such an honour to line up with them.”\n\nNational coach Craig Griffin: “I knew the first ride wasn’t a great ride because there were some nerves, but the first ride was more about understanding the track, because we didn’t have a test event here and didn’t have any race data. There’s two great teams out there in Great Britain and the U.S. – we’ve seen that the last few years – and I knew it was going to be tough. You’re never confident, but you hope you’ve done your homework and put everything together. But to get everyone here and race, and break the national record twice and get it down to 4:14 says a lot about the program and the athletes and the staff behind the athletes.”\n\nJacques Landry, High Performance Director: “It’s a bit of a monkey off our back, to get that first medal, so we can start breathing and focus on what we do best, which is performing. Really happy about the medal; the girls executed really well, and the results speak for themselves. We demonstrated repeatedly with the women’s team pursuit program that we can consistently deliver results, whether it is world championships or World Cups, and now with two bronze medals. But I think it is also important to show that we have a system behind these athletes and also building up other athletes behind these ones, so we can continue building champions towards 2020.”\n\nWomen’s Keirin takes place in Rio\n\n(Rio, BRA – August 13, 2016) Canada will race for Olympic bronze against New Zealand on Saturday evening in the Women’s Team Pursuit at the Rio velodrome. The Canadian team of Allison Beveridge, Jasmin Glaesser, Kirsti Lay and Georgia Simmerling, faced the defending Olympic champions, Great Britain, in the semi-final round and lost when the British team set a new world record. However, the Canadians set the third fastest time of the session at four minutes and 15.636 seconds, to qualify for the bronze medal race. The time was a new Canadian record. Great Britain will face the United States for gold.\n\nIn the Women’s Keirin, neither Kate O’Brien or Monique Sullivan advanced past the first round. Sullivan – who was in the toughest heat of the first round, facing multiple world and Olympic champions – finished sixth, as did O’Brien in her heat. In the last chance Repechage races (winner moves on to the next round), O’Brien finished second, while Sullivan was fifth.\n\n“The first ride I wasn’t super happy with,” admitted O’Brien. “I kind of got into a situation where I had no idea what I was doing. But the second ride I went out and executed the way I wanted to; I rode from the front. I was a bit delayed when the Russian [Anastasiia Voinova] jumped, and after that she just out rode me. The Keirin is still a bit daunting to me, to be honest, but I just rode the best that I could, and unfortunately I didn’t come out on top.”\n\nO’Brien is looking forward more to the Sprint competition, where she was sixth at the world championships earlier in the season. “The Sprint went well for me at Worlds, and I have some confidence there. So, hopefully, I can try to recreate my Worlds rides. I’ll try and qualify the best I can, and race how I want to race, and we’ll see how that stacks me up.”\n\nSullivan, who was sixth in the Keirin at the London Olympics, and fourth at this year’s world championships, was disappointed with her performance. “I really wish I could have done better. The team has been so good all year, and we all wanted to do more and show the work we’ve been doing. But it wasn’t enough today.”\n\n“I saw my first heat this morning, and I went ‘Oh my God’. It was a mental battle, and I really fought to get into the headspace where I could fight for the win or second [to move on to the next round]. The race started out okay, and I was in position to get on the rush that I knew was coming, but it just wasn’t enough. In the second ride, I tried to avoid getting boxed in, but I just couldn’t get around the other riders to the front.”\n\n“We’ve got 24 hours to recover and refocus for the Sprint, and that’s enough. Kate and I will be gunning to have the best times that we can in qualifying, and hopefully make it up to the team tomorrow.”\n\n(Rio, BRA – August 12, 2016) Canada finished eighth in the Women’s Team Sprint on the second day of track competition at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Friday. The Canadian duo of Kate O’Brien and Monique Sullivan (both of Calgary), qualified seventh with a time of 33.735 seconds, to advance to the next round of competition. China won the gold medal in a world record time.\n\nThey were matched with Russia, the eventual silver medalists in the next round and, although they knocked 0.051 seconds off their previous time, did not advance to the medal rounds.\n\n“We wanted a faster ride for our second run, and we got it,” said O’Brien. “But we were hoping for a bit faster. We’re both overwhelmed and underwhelmed at the same time, to be here. It’s amazing to be at the Olympic Games, but it’s also just another bike race; we see all the same people and do the same races. So we’ve been trying to keep the Olympic part in the back of our minds and focus on the racing. The nerves showed up a bit today, but not so much that I was obsessing.”\n\n“I think we were both really hoping for more,” admitted Sullivan, “and I’m not exactly sure why the time wasn’t there. We’ve been showing really good form in training, and tried a bigger gear in the second ride, but I didn’t get on [Kate’s wheel], so I’m pretty bummed about that. I think Kate really did a good job today. I’m really excited for the Keirin tomorrow; it’s a completely different race and a different day, so I’m going to go out there fighting and hopefully it works out.”\n\nNational Sprint coach Erin Hartwell said, “I think it’s important to get that first race of the Games out of the way, and get those Olympic jitters behind us. Realistically, I was targeting sixth place as possible, maybe even fifth, but I also knew it was going to be a dogfight for those last few spots. We qualified well – ahead of Spain, a team we haven’t beaten before – and just behind France. Both girls were firing well, but sometimes a technical issue amplifies, and there was just too big of a gap with a lap to go, and we were just over a tenth [of a second] off that sixth place. So I’m pretty confident going forward to the Keirin, and we are looking forward to being competitive in the next couple of days.”\n\n(Rio, BRA – August 11, 2016) Canada qualified fourth in the Women’s Team Pursuit on Thursday, at the opening night of track competition at the Rio Games. The team of Allison Beveridge, Jasmin Glaesser, Laura Brown and Georgia Simmerling, finished the 4000 metre race with a time of four minutes and 19.599 seconds. Great Britain, the defending Olympic champions, qualified first with a world record time of four minutes and 13.260 seconds.\n\nBy qualifying fourth, Canada is still in a position to challenge for the gold medal, however, to do so they will have to beat the British team in the next round, on Saturday. If they do not beat Great Britain but finish with a top-4 time, they will race for bronze.\n\n“It’s the Olympic Games, so you know everyone is going to come out swinging,” said Beveridge. “The Brits got it right today, for sure, and they have been strong for the past eight years. It’s going to be a big task to take them on in the next round, but getting to the gold medal final has always been our goal, so there’s no reason to back down now. We know that we have more than what we rode today, and we just have to go out there and execute. Anything can happen in the next head-to-head race, and we can’t be afraid to go after it.”\n\nNational coach Craig Griffin said, “the first ride is always a nervous one, we’ve been waiting for quite a few days just to get on the bikes and race. It was an okay outing, but we have a lot more than showed. We’ll change a few things, probably change our lineup; we’ve got two days to sort it out.”\n\n“I think it was a little bit of a disappointment,” admitted Glaesser about the Canadian ride. “It’s always a bit of a guessing game about how fast the track is going to be on race day. We expected every team to bring their A game, and that’s what we’re seeing out there. Obviously, Great Britain’s done a great time, so it is possible to go fast here. We need to put it together a bit better and execute better. definitely we can go faster; we didn’t get the pacing we were shooting for, and that just comes back to better execution.”"
