        "text": "For athletes and sports fans alike, the Olympic Games are the pinnacle of sporting events. Every four years, more than 10,000 athletes from nearly every country come together for the Summer Olympics and compete in dozens of sports. With over 3 billion people watching, it’s arguably the most popular sporting event in the world, showcasing sports and countries both large and small on the global stage.\n\nEvery Olympics has great competitions, but upsets are the most memorable. Underdogs take the drive and determination that got them to the Games and flip the script to take down the front-runners. ATS.io compiled a list of five of the biggest upsets in Summer Olympics history, using research from the International Olympic Committee, Olympedia, NBC, and other news sources.\n\nOlympic upsets have happened all throughout the Games’ history. The very first Olympic champion, triple jumper James Connolly, was somewhat of an underdog. Despite nearly missing his competition due to a mix-up involving Greek calendars, he ended up in the top spot due to a last-minute change in approach.\n\nSome surprise wins come from favorites. In 1952, the great Czechoslovakian runner Emil Zátopek had won two long-distance gold medals and on a whim decided to enter the marathon—his first ever—and shocked the field by winning gold.\n\nOther underdogs put their country on the map. Ethiopian Abebe Bikila—a surprise addition to the team—shone a spotlight on East Africa as a hotbed of talent for distance runners when he won the marathon at Rome in 1960, running barefoot.\n\nHowever, not every upset story is a happy one. At the 1972 Munich Olympics, controversy erupted during the gold medal basketball match between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The last three seconds of the game were put back on the clock twice for unclear reasons. The final time, the Soviets scored a basket to win by one. To this day, the Americans have never accepted their silver medals. Four years later, a strong U.S. women’s swim team brought home just one gold, which was deemed an upset of the dominant East German team—an upper hand that years later was found to have been due to doping.\n\nThankfully, not every upset is shrouded in controversy. Most, like the ones on this list, captured the hearts and imaginations of millions, proving that underdogs can also achieve greatness.\n\nAs runners lined up on the starting line for the 10,000-meter race, all eyes were on Australian world record holder Ron Clarke, who was expected to win the gold. Nobody paid any attention to American Billy Mills, whose best time in this race was nearly a minute slower. Born on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Mills was a member of the Oglala Lakota Tribe and grew up in poverty. By age 12, both of his parents had died, but Mills managed to go to college on an athletic scholarship and, by the Olympics, was an officer in the Marines.\n\nDuring the race, Mills hung in the mix near the front of the pack, but no one thought much of him—even the commentators on the highlight reel described Mills as “a man no one expects to win this particular event.” Yet, at the halfway point, Mills was in the lead, with Clarke and Tunisian runner Mahomed Gammoudi there with him.\n\nThe trio got into traffic as they started lapping runners, which caused them to shove each other for position to make their move at the end of the race, pushing Mills out of the way. However, Mills spotted a hole on the inside of the track, took advantage of it, and sprinted to the finish line. To this day, Mills remains the first and only American to win Olympic gold at this distance."
