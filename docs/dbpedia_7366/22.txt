time trial, (“race against the watch”), in bicycle racing, a form of competition in which individual cyclists or teams are sent out at intervals to cover a specified distance on a road course. The contestant with the fastest time for the distance wins.

The individual time trial is distinctive in that its participants ride alone and widely separated from one another, and any of the cooperative activities used by two or more riders in other kinds of bicycle racing are forbidden. However, in team time trials, members of a team of two to four riders may pace, or assist, each other. Two-person teams start at two-minute intervals, and the time is taken on the second person to cross the finish line; three- and four-person teams start at three-minute intervals, and the third person’s time is recorded. In world championships, teams of four compete over a distance of 100 km (60 miles).

Time trials are part of most stage races—i.e., series of races at which the riders begin at a new destination each day—on the European continent and are featured as self-contained events in the Grand Prix des Nations, an amateur and professional cycling event. British cycle clubs promote time trials as an amateur spring and summer sport. National men’s championships are held for 25-, 50-, and 100-mile (40-, 80-, and 160-kilometre) courses and for 12- and 24-hour contests; for women, the races are held over 25, 50, and 100 miles and for 12 hours. Tandem riders are occasionally allowed to compete. The Road Time Trials Council has controlled and promoted the sport in England and Wales since 1922.
