Rentrak has teamed with MovieTickets.com and will develop marketing and data measurement tools for TV and movies, the two companies announced Thursday. One of the main aims is to more precisely measure the effectiveness of the film studios’ TV commercials.

Rentrak will link its merged TV viewing and box office information with MovieTickets.com’s individual-level ticket purchasing information to help studios and TV programmers better target advertising and interpret the effectiveness of their ad campaigns.

The products will include a combination of movie data and demographic household information that will allow film distributors, theater owners, movie studios, advertising agencies and television programmers to more precisely target audiences.

“As MovieTickets.com continues to build out and focus on research initiatives, Rentrak is a perfect fit for us,” Joel Cohen, MovieTickets.com chief executive officer, said. “We’re combining our strengths to deliver authoritative solutions that will contribute to an improved media planning process.”

“Rentrak is delighted to partner with MovieTickets.com to launch technology that combines our expertise with theirs,” Rentrak CEO and vice chairman Bill Livek added.

The partnership could help both firms, who are in competitive sectors of the industry. MovieTickets.com and rival advance ticket retailer Fandango are both aiming to broaden their consumer bases via initiatives beyond their core offerings, while Rentrak has seen its box office and TV ratings efforts challenged by several digitally focused new firms.
