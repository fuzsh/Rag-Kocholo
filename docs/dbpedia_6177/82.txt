Rentrak and its Box Office Essentials division is acquiring Nielsen EDI, a service that collects box office information for the United States and Canada as well as a number of overseas territories including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Spain, and the UK. These fourteen markets cover 90% of the global box office. The deal allows Nielsen’s continued access to the data, the company said.

“This strategic transaction will provide Rentrak with a substantial global platform, further enabling our ability to provide robust measurement capabilities and analytics to entertainment, media and advertising companies throughout the world, and from which to pursue new business opportunities,“ said Bill Livek, Rentrak’s Chief Executive Officer in a prepared statement.

Eric Weinberg, President, Nielsen Entertainment commented, “While EDI has been an important part of the Nielsen portfolio, this transaction allows our entertainment group to focus on its core businesses and those parts of the company that are most aligned with our long-term strategy. Nielsen remains committed to increasing its understanding of the connected consumer, with a special focus on the relationship between media consumption and consumer purchase behavior.”
