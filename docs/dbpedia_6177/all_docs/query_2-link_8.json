        "text": "In the US, long-time Rentrak exec Amir Yazdani has joined Comscore in the role of Strategic Adviser to the CEO.\n\nComscore acquired film and TV measurement firm Rentrak in 2015, in an all stock deal valued at around $732m. At the time, Comscore was led by Serge Matta, who later resigned, and has since been forced to pay the company a 'clawback' totalling $2.1m, and the SEC $0.7m for his part in a scandal that alleged the firm had inflated revenue by approximately $50m.\n\nCo-founder Gian Fulgoni took over as CEO in 2017 then retired a year later, when he was replaced by Board Director Bryan Wiener, who also resigned after less than a year. More recently, the post has been held by Bill Livek, who was previously CEO of Rentrak. Yazdani (pictured) joins to support Livek after a 30 year career at Rentrak, where he previously served as Chief Technology Officer, and then EVP and Chief Strategy Officer. For more than 25 years, he led the company's engineering team to deliver solutions for media clients, earning multiple patents in media measurement and analytics.\n\nIn his new role, Yazdani, who is credited as being the original 'visionary' and chief architect of Comscore's Television and Movies measurement platforms, will now partner with Chief Product Officer David Algranati and Chief Commercial Officer Chris Wilson. Livek comments: 'During my 40-year career in the information business, Amir has been one of a very few elite technologists I know to have made an enormous impact on the industry. I am thrilled to join forces once again with Amir as we lead the industry with our world class solutions.'\n\nWeb site: www.comscore.com .\n\nAll articles 2006-23 written and edited by Mel Crowther and/or Nick Thomas, 2024- by Nick Thomas, unless otherwise stated."
