        "text": "PORTLAND, Ore., June 5, 2013 /PRNewswire/ — Rentrak (NASDAQ: RENT), the leader in multi-screen measurement serving the advertising, television and movie industries, today announced that it has successfully completed its role in the Dynamic Ad Insertion (DAI) interoperability event (Interop) sponsored by the Entertainment ID Registry (EIDR) and hosted by CableLabs, which demonstrated start-to-finish execution of DAI transactions for Video on Demand (VOD).\n\nDuring the project, which included participation from NBC, BlackArrow, Canoe Ventures, Vubiquity (formerly Avail TVN), EIDR and Ad-ID, Rentrak provided third-party confirmation of accuracy and timeliness of the DAI transactions for Video on Demand by using its Ad Essentials service.\n\n“We sponsored the Interop and Rentrak’s contribution was a crucial component,” said Don Dulchinos, who serves as EIDR’s executive director and CableLabs Interop Director. “Advanced forms of media advertising delivery have little value unless they can be measured, and Rentrak is an expert in precise measurement, and a long time active member of the EIDR ecosystem.”\n\n“Our participation in this project once again shows what an asset Rentrak’s independent third party OnDemand Essentials measurement service can be in providing vital and timely information to the VOD industry,” said Cathy Hetzel, Corporate President and President of Advanced Media & Information at Rentrak. “We tracked participants as they moved data from one system to another and in doing so demonstrated the viability of DAI as a valuable and measurable on demand sales asset.”\n\n“This project proves yet again the value of incorporating industry-standard coding mechanisms so that the buyers, sellers and facilitators of electronic media can speak and trade in a common language,” Harold Geller, Chief Growth Officer for Ad-ID, added. “The reports Rentrak produced during this project provided the impartial proof that what the participants said they could do, did work.”\n\nRentrak’s OnDemand Essentials is the leader in Video on Demand measurement, processing daily, census-level on demand information from over 107 million TVs from 40 cable, telco and satellite providers, as well as from all of the top 25 TV operators offering VOD.
