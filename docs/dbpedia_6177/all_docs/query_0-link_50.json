        "text": "Cross-Platform Ratings Based on World’s Largest Single-Source Dataset Combining TV and Digital\n\nKey Milestone Occurs Just Two Months After Merger of Comscore and Rentrak\n\nRESTON, VA, April 19, 2016 – Comscore (NASDAQ: SCOR) announced today that it has completed the first round of development of its cross-platform ratings, and is now delivering those results to clients for private preview.\n\nThis first release of ratings following the merger of Comscore and Rentrak is based on fully integrated panel and census-based datasets, spanning linear and time-shifted TV, Video on Demand (VOD), and digital viewing. Post-merger, Comscore now has the world’s largest single-source dataset combining TV and digital behavior. This fuels granular insights into media usage across screens at a show, network and website level in a manner not previously possible.\n\nComscore is engaging with its key national clients to share the initial release of the information, which dates back to September 2014. This includes cross-platform person-level reporting based on a U.S. data footprint of 37 million televisions for linear viewing, 117 million televisions for VOD and currency standard digital data. The results will be shared directly with clients on a monthly reporting cadence for the first few months while clients acclimate to the data. This fall, Comscore expects to introduce its syndicated cross-platform measurement product.\n\n“At the time of our merger, we made it clear to the industry that we intended to move incredibly fast to bring to market the cross-platform audience data that our clients have been clamoring for,” said Caroline Horner, senior vice president at Comscore. “People are consuming content in smaller and smaller slices, and our clients want to know every opportunity they have to reach those individuals regardless of where, when and how they’re watching. By producing cross-platform ratings based on massive sample sizes and the de-duplicated audience metrics that media planners need, we’re now able to deliver insights to the market that are far more granular than what has been provided to-date by existing measurement services.”\n\n“We will continue to evolve the offering on our way to a syndicated release of the product this coming fall, but we believe our clients already have much to be excited about from the progress to-date,” Horner continued.\n\n“It’s great to see the newly merged Comscore move rapidly in this direction and I look forward to seeing their preliminary data,” said Colleen Fahey-Rush, executive vice president and chief research officer at Viacom.\n\n“CIMM has been waiting a long time for the industry to innovate where cross-platform measurement is concerned, and the delivery of Comscore’s new data marks a significant milestone,” said Jane Clarke, CEO and managing director of the Coalition for Innovative Media Measurement (CIMM). “We are excited to see continued progress to introduce a measurement system that includes precise viewing behavior at scale across all screens.”\n\nAbout Comscore\n\nComscore, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCOR) is a leading cross-platform measurement company that precisely measures audiences, brands and consumer behavior everywhere. Comscore completed its merger with Rentrak Corporation in January 2016, to create the new model for a dynamic, cross-platform world. Built on precision and innovation, our unmatched data footprint combines proprietary digital, TV and movie intelligence with vast demographic details to quantify consumers’ multiscreen behavior at massive scale. This approach helps media companies monetize their complete audiences and allows marketers to reach these audiences more effectively. With more than 3,200 clients and global footprint in more than 75 countries, Comscore is delivering the future of measurement.
