        "text": "Comscore has moved David Algranati into the role of Chief Innovation Officer, while former Shareablee execs Greg Dale and Jon Lieberman have been named Chief Operating Officer and Chief Technology Officer respectively. Meanwhile Chief Commercial Officer Chris Wilson is leaving the firm.\n\nAlgranati joined Rentrak in 2011 as SVP Product Innovation and Custom Research, prior to the firm's acquisition by Comscore in 2016, and he most recently served as Comscore's Chief Product Officer. Prior to this, he worked for consumer and media firm Simmons Market Research Bureau (later acquired by Experian Information Solutions) as Senior Statistician, and latterly served as the company's Director of Integrated Marketing Solutions. In his new role, Algranati will lead the company's efforts to deliver cross-platform products across ad measurement, content measurement, and planning solutions.\n\nDale and Lieberman take up their new positions, after Comscore's acquisition of social media marketing analytics and measurement company Shareablee, where Dale served as COO and Lieberman was CTO. Dale earlier spent seven years at Comscore, where he held various leadership roles including COO, CTO and EVO for International Sales; and Lieberman's previous experience includes roles at Advanced Motion Technologies, OpenSlate, RapidRatings, InfiniteAgent and others. In their new positions, Dale will report to CEO Jon Carpenter and Lieberman will report to Dale and lead Comscore's Engineering, Infrastructure, and Development teams.\n\nCarpenter comments: 'The changes we are announcing today are reflective of the way we intend to operate going forward, driving discipline, focus, and innovation. David, Greg and Jon have significant experience leading through periods of growth and innovation and have a deep understanding of our industry and the needs of our clients. I am looking forward to working alongside them, and the rest of the leadership team, to deliver success for our employees, customers and shareholders.'\n\nSeparately, Wilson, who joined Rentrak in 2011 from LogicLab, is leaving the business, as he prepares for his as yet unannounced 'next endeavour'. After his departure, Chief Revenue Officer Carol Hinnant will report to Carpenter, along with Shareablee founder Tania Yuki, who now serves as EVP, Digital and Chief Marketing Officer.\n\nWeb site: www.comscore.com .\n\nAll articles 2006-23 written and edited by Mel Crowther and/or Nick Thomas, 2024- by Nick Thomas, unless otherwise stated."
