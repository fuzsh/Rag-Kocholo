        "text": "Campaign Leads to Nearly 25% Tune-in and Time Spent Lifts for a Major TV Network.\n\nNew York, NY – PlaceIQ, the company building more accurate audiences with location, time, and real world behavior, and Media Storm, the second largest independent media agency in the U.S., announced today a first-of-its-kind campaign with a major sports network. The unique campaign, first to use new PIQ PrimeTime Measurement, was designed to drive viewership of Major League Baseball (MLB) on the network. Leveraging a cross-section of location-based insights and television set-top box data to successfully deploy mobile ads, resulted in significant increases in tune-in and time spent watching MLB on the network.\n\nTo create the optimal advertising audience, Media Storm partnered with PlaceIQ to – for the first time – analyze Rentrak television ratings currency of U.S. households that frequently watch MLB across FOX Sports 1, FOX, MLB Network, ESPN, and TBS and identified mobile devices connected to each household using its location intelligence platform. From April 6 to May 3, 2014, those selected mobile users received targeted advertisements prompting users to tune into target network to watch MLB.\n\n“We’re breaking new ground with this campaign by examining the cross-section between mobile devices, location and television viewing habits,” said Chris Wilson, president of national television at Rentrak. “This marks the first time our massive and passive TV viewing information has been used for attribution with a location-based mobile marketing campaign and opens the door for future innovative uses of our unique data set.”\n\nWith new PIQ PrimeTime measurement, the campaign was determined to have driven a 24.4 percent increase in viewership within target demographics as measured vs. control. Furthermore, MLB viewers who were exposed to an ad spent an incremental nine minutes watching on the sports network.\n\n“This is an innovative form of understanding audiences and helps us provide a laser-focused mobile campaign that enables brands to be smarter about the way they advertise to consumers on the go,” said Duncan McCall, CEO and co-founder of PlaceIQ. “Rentrak’s set-top box data served as a critical part of pinpointing the right form of media to reach users and serve them the right ads.”\n\nIn addition to the highly targeted mobile advertising campaign, the sports network gained a greater understanding of its target viewers’ demographics and lifestyle behaviors, allowing the network to intelligently activate future media campaigns across all channels. Findings demonstrated that MLB viewers are most likely to be age 34 and above, middle income, family households. They tend to be on-the-go, visiting quick service restaurants over other dining establishments, strongly prefer Costco to other big box retailers, and prefer general or discount grocery stores to high-end locations such as Whole Foods. MLB viewers are more likely to be active and prefer to spend leisure time outdoors, especially at the beach.\n\n“There are hundreds of new technologies and companies that emerge in the adtech media space every year. At Media Storm, we are dedicated to identifying the most promising and crafting impactful, new approaches for our clients that drive real results,” said Charlie Fiordalis, Managing Director of Digital at Media Storm. “We worked with PlaceIQ and Rentrak to develop a unique application of their technology to drive real, measurable results in tune-in and are looking forward to employing this technology for all of our entertainment clients.”\n\nFor more information about PlaceIQ, please visit www.placeiq.com/products/piq-primetime/.\n\nAbout PlaceIQ\n\nLeading CPG, retail, automotive, entertainment, consumer electronics, and other national brands and their agencies rely on PlaceIQ’s patented technology and suite of consumer discovery, engagement and activation solutions to engage with the right consumers and lead them to desired brand actions and destinations at unbeatable scale.
