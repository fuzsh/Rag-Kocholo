        "meta_description": "Reprint: R0411F Most companies don’t worry about the behavior of their supply chain partners. Instead, they expect the supply chain to work efficiently without interference, as if guided by Adam Smith’s famed invisible hand. In their study of more than 50 supply networks, V.G. Narayanan and Ananth Raman found that companies often looked out for their own interests and ignored those of their network partners. Consequently, supply chains performed poorly. Those results aren’t shocking when you consider that supply chains extend across several functions and many companies, each with its own priorities and goals. Yet all those functions and firms must pull in the same direction for a chain to deliver goods and services to consumers quickly and cost-effectively. According to the authors, a supply chain works well only if the risks, costs, and rewards of doing business are distributed fairly across the network. In fact, misaligned incentives are often the cause of excess inventory, stock-outs, incorrect forecasts, inadequate sales efforts, and even poor customer service. The fates of all supply chain partners are interlinked: If the firms work together to serve consumers, they will all win. However, they can do that only if incentives are aligned. Companies must acknowledge that the problem of incentive misalignment exists and then determine its root cause and align or redesign incentives. They can improve alignment by, for instance, adopting revenue-sharing contracts, using technology to track previously hidden information, or working with intermediaries to build trust among network partners. It’s also important to periodically reassess incentives, because even top-performing networks find that changes in technology or business conditions alter the alignment of incentives.",

        "text": "Excess inventory. Stock-outs. Wildly off-base demand forecasts. Are you plagued by these supply-chain headaches? If so, you may be unwittingly rewarding your supply-chain partners for advancing their own interests—not yours or those of the entire supply chain. Cisco did this when it rewarded its contract manufacturers for delivering supplies quickly. So manufacturers built buffer stocks to ensure speedy deliveries. But when a recession slashed demand, these vendors stuck Cisco with $2.5 billion worth of surplus raw materials.\n\nA supply chain works well only when its players equally share the risks, costs, and rewards of doing business together. How to encourage that sharing? Ensure that all supply-chain partners’ incentives are aligned. First, acknowledge that incentive problems exist. Second, determine their causes. For example, do your retailers benefit more from pushing another company’s products instead of yours? Third, realign incentives so that everyone’s pulling in the same direction. For instance, write contracts enabling you to track retailers’ efforts on your behalf and reward them for enhanced sales.\n\nWhen each firm in your supply chain acts in the overall chain’s best interests, everyone benefits. Like Whirlpool, Campbell Soup, and other leading firms, you can align incentives to create wins for every organization in your supply chain.\n\nThe Idea in Practice\n\nHow to Realign Incentives in Your Supply Chain\n\nAcknowledge incentive problems. Facilitate discussions among managers about how incentive misalignments affect your company’s supply chains. Educate managers about your supply-chain partners’ operations, so they understand how incentives can get out of whack.\n\nIdentify root causes. Incentive misalignment has three causes:\n\nHidden actions:\n\nYou can’t see what your partners are doing, so you can’t create incentives that induce them to do what’s best for the entire supply chain.\n\nHidden information:\n\nOne partner has information that other partners don’t. For example, automotive parts suppliers fear that if they share their cost data, the “Big Three” U.S. auto manufacturers will use that information to squeeze their margins. So they don’t participate in improvement initiatives that require such data. Result? Because of information hoarding, the Big Three’s supply chains function inefficiently.\n\nBadly designed incentive schemes:\n\nIncentives intended to spur supply-chain efficiency don’t have the expected impact.\n\nAlign or redesign incentives. Select one or more of these solutions:\n\nChange contracts.\n\nCreate contracts that reward or penalize partners based on measurable outcomes. A Canadian bread maker altered its contracts with deliverymen to prevent them from overstocking shelves during rivals’ promotions. It introduced penalties for stale loaves as well as commissions based on sales. The combination motivated deliverymen to keep the shelves full—except on days when rivals offered shoppers deep discounts on competing products.\n\nUncover hidden information.\n\nTrack more business variables that affect supply-chain effectiveness. Campbell Soup realized that 40% of its chicken noodle soup manufactured one year was sold to distributors during a six-week period when Campbell offered discounts on the product. The uptick had strained the company’s supply chain. Campbell began gathering data on distributors’ sales to retailers and gave distributors discounts based on their sales—eliminating the incentive to forward-buy.\n\nPromote trust."
