        "text": "Rentrak Corp., whose technology tracks how consumers watch movies and TV shows, is shaping up as a takeover target for companies including Google Inc. seeking more data as viewers shift to smartphones and the Internet.\n\nRentrak, which counts billionaire investor Mark Cuban as its second-largest shareholder, is poised to double sales over the next three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, as companies demand more precise ratings analysis of mobile and digital content. Rentrakâ€™s technology and growth prospects could appeal to Google, offering the Internet search giant a means to bolster its share of the online and mobile-ad market, BWS Financial Inc. said."
